1
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,050
Ethan?

2
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:30,189
Quiet, prince.

3
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,240
That's your uncle Ethan.

4
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:58,086
Welcome home, Ethan.

5
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:17,204
Lucy. You ain't much bigger
than when I last saw you.

6
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:20,781
I'm Deborah.
There's Lucy over there.

7
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,620
Deborah. Debbie.

8
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:27,615
- And you're Lucy?
- Yeah, I'm Lucy.

9
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:29,868
I'm mighty glad to see you,
uncle Ethan.

10
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,421
She's got a fella. Kisses him too.

11
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:34,295
- Ben, would you...?
- That's enough.

12
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:36,302
Go on with Lucy
and help with supper.

13
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:41,046
Deborah, you too. Ben.

14
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:44,759
I was just gonna ask uncle Ethan
what he's gonna do with his saber.

15
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,931
Well, I kind of figured to give it to you.

16
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,270
Thanks. Thanks, uncle Ethan.

17
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:57,784
- How was California?
- California? How should I know?

18
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,114
- Well, mose Harper told us...
- Mose Harper?

19
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:03,159
Is that old goat still creaking around?

20
00:04:03,324 --> 00:04:05,664
Why ain't somebody bury him?

21
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:08,496
No, I ain't been to California.

22
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:10,583
Don't intend to go either.

23
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:13,128
Supper will be ready
as soon as you wash up.

24
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:16,172
Let me take your coat for you, Ethan.

25
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:28,183
Welcome home, Ethan.

26
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:31,637
Thanks, Aaron.

27
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:46,534
Marty, here's uncle Ethan.

28
00:04:47,076 --> 00:04:49,446
Debbie, sit down.

29
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:55,962
Evening, uncle Ethan.
Welcome home, sir.

30
00:04:56,711 --> 00:05:00,171
Martin. Martin pawley.

31
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:04,093
I'm sorry for being late, aunt Martha.

32
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:09,098
Uncle Aaron.

33
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:17,566
Fella could mistake you
for a half-breed.

34
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:21,652
Not quite. I'm eighth cherokee.
And the rest is welsh and English.

35
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:24,906
- At least that's what they tell me.
- Grown some.

36
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:27,994
It was Ethan who found you,
squalling under a Sage clump...

37
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,039
...after your folks had been massacred.

38
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:34,332
It just happened to be me.
No need to make more of it.

39
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:41,256
Thank you, Lucy.

40
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:06,862
Good night, aunt Martha.

41
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:09,737
Good night, Martin.

42
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:12,579
- Uncle Aaron.
- Good night, Martin.

43
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:15,543
- Good night, uncle Ethan.
- Good night.

44
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:17,376
Come on, Ben.

45
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,422
Night, ma. Night, pa.

46
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,745
Uncle Ethan,
will you tell us about the war?

47
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:23,961
The war ended three years ago, boy.

48
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:26,881
It did? Then why didn't you
come home before now?

49
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:31,391
Ben, go on with Martin. March.

50
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:37,311
Uncle Ethan, Lucy's wearing
the gold locket you gave her...

51
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:40,058
...when she was a little girl.

52
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:43,151
She don't wear it much on account
of it makes her neck green.

53
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:46,397
- Deborah.
- Well, it does.

54
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,410
But I wouldn't care
if you gave me a gold locket...

55
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,583
...if it made my neck green or not.

56
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:53,582
- A gold locket.
- Debbie.

57
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,754
Lucy, where are my saddlebags?

58
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:18,015
Look at my gold locket!

59
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:20,595
Oh, it is pretty.

60
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:24,975
- Ethan, I think she's too young...
- Oh, let her have it.

61
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:28,201
- It doesn't amount to much.
- Bed, young lady.

62
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:30,202
- Yes, daddy.
- Thank you, uncle Ethan.

63
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:32,874
Come along to bed.

64
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:40,706
Passed the Todd place coming in.
What happened?

65
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,041
Gave up, quit,
went back to chopping cotton.

66
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:46,263
So did the jamisons.

67
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:49,383
Without Martha...

68
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:53,545
She just wouldn't let a man quit.

69
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:57,021
Ethan, I saw it in you before the war.

70
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,733
You wanted to clear out.

71
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:01,193
You stayed beyond any real reason.
Why?

72
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:05,072
- Aaron, please...
- You asking me to clear out now?

73
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:07,652
You're my brother, Ethan.
You're welcome to stay...

74
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:10,398
...as long as you have a mind to.
That right, Martha?

75
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:13,911
- Of course it is.
- I expect to pay my way.

76
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:16,834
There's 60 double eagles in there.

77
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:21,004
And twice that much here.
Yankee dollars.

78
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,253
That's fresh minted.

79
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:28,799
- There ain't a mark on it.
- So?

80
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,810
Aaron, open up! It's Sam Clayton.

81
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:26,899
Aaron.

82
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:36,568
- Reverend. Come on in!
- Good morning, Aaron.

83
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,490
- Good morning, sister Edwards.
- Good morning, reverend.

84
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,000
- Morning, Ben and Debbie.
- Good morning, Charlie.

85
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:44,292
- What is it, reverend?
- Lars says somebody...

86
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:47,326
...busted in his corral last night
and run off his best cows.

87
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:50,091
Yeah. Next time I raise pigs, by golly!

88
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:53,764
You never hear anyone
running off pigs, I bet you.

89
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:57,684
- Coffee's ready if you'd like some.
- Coffee will be just fine. Morning, Lucy.

90
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:00,255
- Morning, reverend.
- Debbie, you been baptized yet?

91
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,141
- No, sir. No.
- Aaron, get Martin.

92
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:05,518
- Martin!
- Oh, thank you, sister.

93
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:09,186
I can sure use that coffee.
Pass the sugar, son.

94
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:12,025
Fine, fine. Wait a minute, sister.

95
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:15,862
I didn't get any coffee yet. Just...
Oh, doughnuts. Thank you, sister.

96
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,280
I'm sure fond of them doughnuts.

97
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,290
Aaron! Martin, come on up here.

98
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,873
Come on. Raise your right hand...
Martin.

99
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,629
- Yes, sir.
- Raise your right hand.

100
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,841
You are hereby voluntary privates
in company a of the Texas rangers.

101
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:34,214
- You will faithfully...
- Sir, can I go with you?

102
00:10:34,423 --> 00:10:36,973
- Go get my shirt, boy.
- Quiet!

103
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:39,144
- Where was I?
- "Faithfully fulfill."

104
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:41,563
- You will faithfully discharge...
- Mrs. Edwards...

105
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:43,852
Shut up!

106
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:47,394
You will faithfully discharge
your duties as such...

107
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,561
...without a recompense
or monetary consideration.

108
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,401
Amen. That means "no pay."
Better get a shirt on, Aaron.

109
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,567
I ain't volunteering
till I've had coffee.

110
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:58,156
- Drink your own, reverend.
- Just call me "captain."

111
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:01,832
Captain. The reverend
Samuel Johnson Clayton.

112
00:11:01,992 --> 00:11:04,082
Mighty impressive.

113
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:07,834
Well, the prodigal brother.

114
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:11,918
When did you get back?
I ain't seen you since the surrender.

115
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:14,756
Come to think of it,
I didn't see you at the surrender.

116
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:19,552
Don't believe in surrenders.
Nope, I still got my saber, reverend.

117
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:22,218
Didn't turn it into
no plowshare neither.

118
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:24,599
The lnjuns did it, Mrs. Edwards.

119
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:28,385
Caddos or kiowas.
Old mose knows. Yes, sir.

120
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,690
- Oh, shut up, mose.
- Thank you.

121
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:33,234
- My cattle's been...
- Ethan, I'm counting on you...

122
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,229
...to look after things
while I'm gone.

123
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,111
- You're not going.
- He sure is going.

124
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:39,777
- I already swore him in.
- Well, swear him out again.

125
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:42,069
<i>- I'll</i> go with you.
- I don't think I should...

126
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,581
Stay close, Aaron.
It might be this is rustlers.

127
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:48,865
Might be that this doddering
old idiot ain't so far wrong.

128
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,369
Could be comanche.

129
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,711
Kind words, Ethan.
Thank you kindly.

130
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:55,554
Children, go with Lucy.

131
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:57,053
- Oh, ma, I want...
- Ben.

132
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:59,134
Comanche, huh?

133
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,969
All right. I'll swear you in.

134
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:04,296
No need to.
Wouldn't be legal anyway.

135
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:08,773
Why not? You wanted
for a crime, Ethan?

136
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,729
- Coffee, Ethan.
- Thank you, Martha.

137
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:17,396
You asking me as a captain
or a preacher, Sam?

138
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:20,488
I'm asking you as a ranger
of the sovereign state of Texas.

139
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:23,824
- You got a warrant?
- You fit a lot of descriptions.

140
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:28,156
Figure a man's only good
for one oath at a time.

141
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:31,828
I took mine
to the confederate states of America.

142
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,792
So did you, Sam.

143
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,340
Stay close, Aaron.

144
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:40,168
Well, thank you, Mrs. Edwards.
We have to be going.

145
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,300
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.

146
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:47,178
Grateful to the hospitality
of your rocking chair, ma'am.

147
00:12:56,315 --> 00:13:00,185
<i>- Brad and Lucy, Lucy and Brad!
- Brad and Lucy, Lucy and Brad!</i>

148
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,950
Debbie and Ben Edwards,
I'm gonna tell ma on you!

149
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:40,964
Brad! Right ahead!

150
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:51,104
Uncle Ethan.

151
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:55,733
Something mighty fishy
about this trail, uncle Ethan.

152
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:58,943
Don't call me "uncle."
I ain't your uncle.

153
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,444
Yes, sir.

154
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:03,396
No need to call me "sir" either.

155
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,397
Nor "grandpa," nor "methuselah."

156
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,820
I can whup you to a frazzle.

157
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:12,159
- What do you want me to call you?
- Name's Ethan.

158
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:15,576
Now, what's so mighty fishy
about this trail?

159
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:18,996
- Well, first off...
- Look! Look!

160
00:15:36,683 --> 00:15:38,523
Reverend!

161
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:41,863
Look!

162
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,370
Caddos or kiowas, huh?

163
00:16:01,124 --> 00:16:04,044
Ain't but one tribe uses a Lance like that.

164
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:07,341
Hey, pa, your prize bull.

165
00:16:07,506 --> 00:16:08,836
Killed every one of them.

166
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:12,798
Not for food either.
Why'd they do a thing like that?

167
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,850
Stealing the cattle
was just to pull us out.

168
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:17,724
This is a murder raid.

169
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:22,401
Shapes up to scald out either
your place or my brother's.

170
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:25,192
Mama! Laurie!

171
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:28,067
Oh, please, god, please, no!

172
00:16:28,235 --> 00:16:30,565
Brad! Brad! Son!

173
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:36,082
Jorgensen's place is the closest, Ethan.

174
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:40,373
If they're not there, we'll come
straight on to you. Come on, Charlie.

175
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,369
You do that.

176
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,711
Well, are you coming or ain't you?

177
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:50,546
That farm's 40 miles from here, boy,
and these horses need rest and grain.

178
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,939
Ain't caddos, ain't kiowas.
Comanches, sure!

179
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:18,543
- Break out the grain.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

180
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:47,357
Quiet, boy.

181
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,639
Think I'll see if I can't take off
a couple of Sage hens before supper.

182
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:22,385
Yes, you do that, Aaron.

183
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:33,032
- My, the days are getting shorter.
- Lucy, we don't need a lamp yet.

184
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:36,283
Let's just enjoy the dusk.

185
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:48,503
It's all right, ma. I been watching.

186
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,377
- Only...
- What, Ben?

187
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:53,884
I wish uncle Ethan was here.
Don't you, ma?

188
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:10,556
Close that shutter, Ben, like...
Good boy.

189
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:25,371
- Ma, I can't...
- Lucy!

190
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,686
We are going to play
the sleep-out game.

191
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:50,852
Remember? Where you hide out
with grandma?

192
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:53,941
- Where she's buried?
- And you creep along the ditch...

193
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:57,187
- ...very quietly, like...
- Like a little mouse.

194
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,450
Hurry up, Martha.
The moon's fixing to rise.

195
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:03,283
You won't make a sound or come back,
no matter what you hear.

196
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,080
- Promise?
- I promise.

197
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:09,535
Wait. Can't I have topsy?

198
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:12,706
- There's no time. There's no time.
- Here she is, baby.

199
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:17,125
Here.

200
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:20,431
Now, down low. Run!

201
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:22,512
Baby!

202
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:35,612
Prince, go back. Go back, prince.

203
00:20:35,774 --> 00:20:39,074
Go back. Prince! Go back.
Go back, prince!

204
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:43,816
Prince, go back. Go back, prince!
Prince!

205
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,563
Uncle Ethan!

206
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:18,533
Uncle Ethan.

207
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,645
Wait a minute, uncle Ethan.

208
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:23,359
Next time, you'll mind
your uncle Ethan.

209
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,530
- Thank you kindly.
- Wait, mose! We can ride double, mose!

210
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,290
Mose, wait!

211
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,825
Mose!

212
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:10,575
Martha! Martha!

213
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,786
Aunt Martha.

214
00:22:52,702 --> 00:22:54,042
Aunt Martha.

215
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,960
- Let me in.
- Don't go in there, boy.

216
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:02,667
- I wanna see them. Let me in, I wanna...
- Don't go in.

217
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:08,086
Don't let him look in there, mose.

218
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,759
Won't do him any good.

219
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,730
Lucy! Debbie!

220
00:23:54,347 --> 00:23:57,017
- Put an "amen" to it!
- I'm not finished yet.

221
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:59,765
There's no more time
for praying. Amen!

222
00:23:59,936 --> 00:24:01,936
Brad, Martin!

223
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:04,015
Amen.

224
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:29,297
Ethan, those girls mean as much to me
as though they were my own.

225
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:33,216
Maybe you don't know that my Brad's
been sitting up with Lucy. My Laurie's...

226
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:36,056
I'd be obliged
if you'd come to the point, ma'am.

227
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:38,392
Just that I know
that Martha would want you...

228
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:40,978
...to take care of her boys
as well as her girls.

229
00:24:41,144 --> 00:24:46,324
And if the girls are dead, don't let
the boys waste their lives in vengeance.

230
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:49,029
Promise me, Ethan!

231
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:51,574
Well, come on, if you're going with us.

232
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:21,177
Captain! Captain Clayton!

233
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,880
Another one, huh?
Gimme a hand, Charlie.

234
00:25:57,554 --> 00:26:00,144
This one come a long way
before he died, captain.

235
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:03,976
Well, Ethan, there's another one
you can score up for your brother.

236
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:08,477
- I don't like it!
- What don't you like?

237
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:11,228
Injuns on a raid
generally hide their dead.

238
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,821
And if they don't care anything
about us knowing...

239
00:26:13,987 --> 00:26:15,987
...it only spells one thing:

240
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:19,945
They ain't afeard of us following
or of us catching up with them either.

241
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:23,908
You can back out
any time you want, nesby.

242
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:26,672
Ethan, I didn't say that!

243
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,165
Didn't say such!

244
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:30,996
Easy, nesby, easy.

245
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:36,683
Jorgensen!

246
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:39,845
Why don't you finish the job?

247
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,941
- What good did that do you?
- By what you preach, none.

248
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:53,938
But what that comanche believes...

249
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,610
...ain't got no eyes,
he can't enter the spirit land.

250
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,159
Has to wander forever
between the winds.

251
00:26:59,324 --> 00:27:03,334
You get it, reverend.
Come on, blanket head.

252
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:11,714
All right, boys. Let's mount up.

253
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:26,562
They're camped by the river,
about 20 miles from here.

254
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:33,941
We'll wait till dark, then circle out
so we can jump them before daylight.

255
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:37,067
You right sure you wanna
jump them, Ethan?

256
00:27:39,697 --> 00:27:41,567
That's what we came for, ain't it?

257
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:45,751
I thought we were trying
to get them girls out. Alive.

258
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:48,924
We jump them comanche,
they'll kill them. You know that.

259
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:53,882
Well, what are we doing, then, reverend?
What are we supposed to do, Ethan?

260
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:58,925
Well, what I had in mind
was maybe running off their pony herd.

261
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:01,592
A comanche on foot's more apt
to be willing to listen.

262
00:28:01,761 --> 00:28:03,891
I think the reverend's right,
don't you?

263
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:06,555
You think the reverend's...

264
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:10,604
What does a quarter-breed cherokee
know about the old comanche trick...

265
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,610
...of sleeping with his best pony
tied right by his side?

266
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:19,195
You got about as much chance
of stampeding that herd as...

267
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:23,282
As you have of finding them girls alive
by raiding into them.

268
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:27,039
I say we do it my way, Ethan.
And that's an order.

269
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:28,873
Yes, sir.

270
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:30,618
But if you're wrong...

271
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:34,289
...don't ever give me another!

272
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:19,838
- Well, they was here.
- Sure. They was here.

273
00:29:20,006 --> 00:29:23,926
And now they're out there,
waiting to jump us.

274
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:26,353
Any more orders, captain?

275
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:29,772
Yes. We'll keep on going.

276
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:41,532
Well?

277
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:43,954
You wanna quit, Ethan?

278
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:46,703
That'll be the day.

279
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
- Horses.
- Horses.

280
00:30:01,214 --> 00:30:03,384
Keep ofi going-

281
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,510
keep moving. Keep moving.

282
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:28,587
Well, reverend, looks
like you got yourself surrounded.

283
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,799
Yeah, and I figure on getting myself
un-surrounded.

284
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:34,311
Mose, how far is the river?

285
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:39,563
I've been baptized, reverend.
I've been baptized.

286
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:43,439
- Shut up, you old fool.
- Thank you kindly. Thank you.

287
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:46,108
You better get yourself
set for another one...

288
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:51,817
...because when I holler, I want you
to move out of here like Billy b. Jigger.

289
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:58,115
Let's go!

290
00:32:34,742 --> 00:32:37,122
- Take it easy, nesby.
- You'll be all right, nesby.

291
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:40,666
- Keep them on the other side of the river.
<i>- I'll</i> do the telling, Ethan!

292
00:32:40,831 --> 00:32:42,671
Well, then tell them!

293
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:46,496
- Take it easy, nesby.
- You'll be all right, nesby.

294
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:49,673
Come on, come on.

295
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,083
There.

296
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,750
Here's my Bible. Hold it.

297
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:22,292
Make you feel good.

298
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:25,584
Thank you, reverend.
Thank you very kindly.

299
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:33,512
Ethan, you figure they'll charge us?

300
00:33:33,884 --> 00:33:36,224
- Are you asking me?
- I am.

301
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:38,007
Thank you.

302
00:33:38,347 --> 00:33:41,017
Yep. Death song.

303
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:44,313
War chief, he's gotta, to save face.

304
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:48,944
Yes, sir. He'll be right in your lap
in a minute, Sonny.

305
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,910
For that which we are about to receive,
we thank thee, o lord.

306
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,990
You got him, Marty!

307
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:54,798
Hallelujah!

308
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:57,843
Dag blast it!

309
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,430
Watch it. It's loaded.

310
00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:34,298
No, Ethan. Leave them
carry off their hurt and dead.

311
00:35:34,463 --> 00:35:36,883
Well, reverend, that tears it!

312
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:39,799
From now on,
you stay out of this, all of you.

313
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:41,889
I don't want you with me.

314
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:44,934
I don't need you
for what I gotta do.

315
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:57,403
Well, Edwards, l...

316
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,030
I guess you're right.
We gotta get nesby back.

317
00:36:01,198 --> 00:36:03,238
It's a job for a whole company
of rangers...

318
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:06,081
...or it's a job for one or two men.

319
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:09,535
Right now, we're too many
and not enough.

320
00:36:09,707 --> 00:36:12,497
Me, I'm going on alone.

321
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:16,924
- Any objections?
- Good luck.

322
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:22,601
There's only one way you can stop me
from looking for Lucy, mister.

323
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:24,761
And that's kill me!

324
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:27,682
That's the way I feel, uncle Ethan.

325
00:36:28,225 --> 00:36:30,595
Ethan, sir.

326
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:33,939
All right.
But I'm giving the orders, hear?

327
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:35,936
I'm giving the orders.

328
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:39,108
And you'll follow them
or we're splitting up right here and now.

329
00:36:39,278 --> 00:36:41,198
Well, sure, Ethan.

330
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:46,123
Just one reason we're here, ain't it?
That's to find Debbie and Lucy?

331
00:36:50,206 --> 00:36:52,706
If they're still alive.

332
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:58,919
Mount up.

333
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:27,583
They gotta stop sometime.

334
00:37:27,743 --> 00:37:30,663
If they're human men at all,
they gotta stop!

335
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:36,249
No. Human rides a horse until it dies,
then he goes on afoot.

336
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:41,838
Comanche comes along, gets that
horse up, rides him 20 more miles...

337
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:44,179
...then eats him.

338
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:46,506
Easy on that.

339
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:48,349
Sorry.

340
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:51,524
We don't even know
if Debbie and Lucy's in this bunch.

341
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:54,194
- Maybe they split up.
- They're with them, all right...

342
00:37:54,353 --> 00:37:57,363
- ...if they're still alive.
- You've said that enough!

343
00:37:57,523 --> 00:38:00,693
Maybe Lucy's dead.
Maybe they're both dead.

344
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:04,199
But if I hear that from you again,
I'll fight you, Mr. Edwards!

345
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:06,783
That'll be the day.

346
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:14,209
Spread out.

347
00:38:23,382 --> 00:38:25,682
Found a main trail...

348
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:30,183
...but four of them cut out right here and
they rode on up through the pass there.

349
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:32,637
How come they do that, Ethan?

350
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,190
I'll take a look.
Keep after the others.

351
00:38:36,353 --> 00:38:41,233
- You want us to fire a shot, just in...?
- No. Nor build bonfires, nor beat drums.

352
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,740
I'll meet you on the far side.

353
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:46,485
Move!

354
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:24,903
You want some water, Ethan?

355
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:39,785
Trail leads over there.

356
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:42,292
Why'd they break off?

357
00:39:44,129 --> 00:39:46,799
Was there water in that canyon?

358
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:50,933
No water.

359
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:53,474
Are you all right, Ethan?

360
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:56,103
I'm all right.

361
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:01,145
Hey.

362
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:04,977
What happened to your
Johnny reb coat? Did you lose it?

363
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:07,489
Must have.

364
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:10,323
But I'm not going back for it.

365
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:30,683
I found them!

366
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:32,803
I found Lucy!

367
00:40:33,762 --> 00:40:35,602
They're camped about a half-mile over.

368
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:38,524
I was just swinging back
and I seen their smoke.

369
00:40:38,684 --> 00:40:42,354
Bellied up a Ridge, and there they was,
right below me.

370
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:47,861
- Did you see Debbie?
- No. No, but I saw Lucy, all right.

371
00:40:48,026 --> 00:40:51,196
- She was wearing that blue dress...
- What you saw wasn't Lucy.

372
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:54,953
- Oh, but it... it was, I tell you.
- What you saw was a buck...

373
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:57,657
...wearing Lucy's dress.

374
00:40:57,995 --> 00:41:01,285
I found Lucy back in the canyon.

375
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:05,746
Wrapped her in my coat.

376
00:41:06,378 --> 00:41:08,548
Buried her with my own hands.

377
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:12,836
Thought it best to keep it from you.

378
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:16,813
Did they...?

379
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:19,219
- Was she...?
- What do you want me to do?

380
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:22,561
Draw you a picture?
Spell it out?

381
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:24,728
Don't ever ask me!

382
00:41:24,897 --> 00:41:28,147
Long as you live,
don't ever ask me more.

383
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:53,932
Brad. I'm awful sorry, Brad.

384
00:41:54,092 --> 00:41:58,352
Hey, Brad...
Brad, wait a minute! Brad!

385
00:41:59,264 --> 00:42:01,774
Wait! Come back here, Brad!

386
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,600
Brad, come back here!

387
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,610
Well, why don't you say it?

388
00:42:57,656 --> 00:42:59,986
We're beat, and you know it.

389
00:43:00,742 --> 00:43:02,622
Nope.

390
00:43:02,995 --> 00:43:06,075
Our turning back don't mean nothing.

391
00:43:06,248 --> 00:43:08,498
Not in the long run.

392
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:11,342
If she's alive, she's safe.

393
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:13,843
For a while. They'll keep her...

394
00:43:14,006 --> 00:43:17,176
...they'll raise her
as one of their own until...

395
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:20,513
Till she's of an age to...

396
00:43:20,971 --> 00:43:25,431
Well, do you think maybe there's
a chance we still might find her?

397
00:43:25,601 --> 00:43:30,651
Injun will chase a thing
till he thinks he's chased it enough.

398
00:43:30,898 --> 00:43:32,608
Then he quits.

399
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:35,034
Same way when he runs.

400
00:43:35,193 --> 00:43:38,823
Seems like he never learns
there's such a thing as...

401
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:42,159
...a critter who'll just keep coming on.

402
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:45,664
So we'll find them in the end,
I promise you.

403
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:47,999
We'll find them.

404
00:43:48,165 --> 00:43:52,455
Just as sure as the turning
of the earth.

405
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:45,849
- Hi, Ethan.
- Hello, sir.

406
00:44:46,014 --> 00:44:48,604
- Hi, Marty.
- How are you, sir?

407
00:44:52,104 --> 00:44:53,944
Many

408
00:44:59,027 --> 00:45:02,107
you got my letter
about your son Brad?

409
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,790
Yeah. Just about this time a year ago.

410
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:13,791
Oh, Ethan, this country...

411
00:45:19,464 --> 00:45:21,304
Marty?

412
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:26,099
Martin pawley!

413
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:32,982
Him probably forgetting all about you.

414
00:45:33,145 --> 00:45:35,645
Probably can't even
call your name to mind.

415
00:45:35,814 --> 00:45:38,074
Her name's Laurie.

416
00:45:39,943 --> 00:45:43,163
But I fairly forgot
just how pretty she was.

417
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:57,671
Ethan.

418
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,590
What about Debbie?

419
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,770
Hey, what are you doing anyway?

420
00:46:16,146 --> 00:46:17,976
Hey, don't go taking that stuff!

421
00:46:18,857 --> 00:46:20,937
Well, it ain't worth the mending.

422
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:23,859
What are you getting so red
in the face about? I got brothers.

423
00:46:24,071 --> 00:46:26,321
Yeah, well, I ain't one of them.

424
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,950
Now, lookie here, Martin pawley,
I'm a woman.

425
00:46:29,117 --> 00:46:32,197
We women wash and mend
your dirty clothes all your lives.

426
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,040
When you're little,
we even wash you.

427
00:46:34,206 --> 00:46:37,706
How you can make out to be bashful
in front of a woman, I'll never know.

428
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:40,706
You talk like a feller
just might as well run around naked.

429
00:46:40,879 --> 00:46:42,879
Wouldn't bother me none.

430
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,510
Sure wouldn't try it
in front of pa, though, if I was you.

431
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:06,399
We kept tracking them
till the blizzards hit.

432
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:09,031
Then we lost their trail.

433
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:11,703
No need to tell you where we went.

434
00:47:11,868 --> 00:47:14,328
Fort Richardson, wingate, Cobb.

435
00:47:14,496 --> 00:47:16,866
Anadarko agency.

436
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,040
Trouble is, we don't know which band
the war party belonged to.

437
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,420
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

438
00:47:22,587 --> 00:47:26,087
- I got your boy killed.
- Don't go blaming yourself for that.

439
00:47:26,258 --> 00:47:28,338
It's this country killed my boy.

440
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:31,760
- Yes, by golly, I tell you, Ethan...
- Now, Lars...

441
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:34,890
...it just so happens we be texicans.

442
00:47:35,058 --> 00:47:40,768
Texican is nothing but a human man
way out on a limb. This year and next...

443
00:47:40,939 --> 00:47:45,239
...and maybe for a hundred more.
But I don't think it'll be forever.

444
00:47:45,402 --> 00:47:49,282
Someday this country's gonna be
a fine, good place to be.

445
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:53,407
Maybe it needs our bones in the ground
before that time can come.

446
00:47:53,577 --> 00:47:55,407
Bedtime.

447
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,210
She was a schoolteacher, you know.

448
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,750
Ma, Marty's drawers is a sight. Could
we give him some of Brad's things?

449
00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:04,709
Of course.
They're in grandma's chest.

450
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,800
- Ethan, you'll sleep in the bunkhouse.
- By golly, the letter!

451
00:48:07,966 --> 00:48:09,126
In the Sweden chest.

452
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:13,761
It come for you, Ethan. Last winter.
Charlie maccorry brought it.

453
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,640
I'm looking for that letter
Charlie maccorry...

454
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,480
Byjiminy.

455
00:48:27,277 --> 00:48:31,197
Here it is. By golly, I forgot.

456
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,000
Excuse me.

457
00:48:48,465 --> 00:48:53,135
Mrs. jorgensen, take a look at this.

458
00:48:53,303 --> 00:48:55,683
- Just a snip of calico.
- Ever see it before?

459
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:59,137
Maybe on a dress Debbie wore?

460
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:02,935
Why, yes. Yes, it was an apron.

461
00:49:03,104 --> 00:49:06,364
Ethan, have they found her yet?

462
00:49:07,525 --> 00:49:09,485
Not yet.

463
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:14,531
Not yet.

464
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:19,542
You might at least
have left me my britches!

465
00:49:19,704 --> 00:49:21,044
It's time for bed anyway.

466
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:24,376
- Here, try these on.
- I ain't gonna.

467
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:27,174
Well, likely they'll need some taking in.

468
00:49:27,337 --> 00:49:31,047
Marty, you're that gaunted. Ma's having
a Turkey for dinner tomorrow...

469
00:49:31,216 --> 00:49:35,046
Laurie? Laurie, come.
Let the boys get to bed.

470
00:49:35,262 --> 00:49:37,312
All right, pa.

471
00:49:42,185 --> 00:49:44,895
- Good night, Marty.
- Good night, Laurie.

472
00:49:45,063 --> 00:49:48,823
- Night, Mr. Edwards.
- Night, miss jorgensen.

473
00:49:54,656 --> 00:49:57,826
Jorgensen's been running
my cattle with his own.

474
00:49:58,743 --> 00:50:00,703
Your cattle?

475
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,410
You mean Debbie's cattle.

476
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,250
He's agreed to take you on and split
the increase in my herd while I'm gone.

477
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,090
I'm pushing on tomorrow.

478
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:14,052
Well, I sure ain't gonna stay here.
I started out looking for Debbie...

479
00:50:14,217 --> 00:50:16,007
- ...I intend to keep on.
- Why?

480
00:50:16,177 --> 00:50:17,507
Why?

481
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,059
- Well, because she's my...
- She's your nothing.

482
00:50:21,224 --> 00:50:23,064
She's no kin to you at all.

483
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,730
Well, I always
kind of thought she was.

484
00:50:26,896 --> 00:50:29,066
The way her folks took me in,
they raised me...

485
00:50:29,232 --> 00:50:31,942
- That don't make you no kin.
- All right, maybe it don't.

486
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,240
- But I intend to keep on looking anyway.
- How?

487
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:37,615
You got any horses
or money to buy them?

488
00:50:37,824 --> 00:50:39,954
You ain't even got money
for cartridges.

489
00:50:40,535 --> 00:50:43,955
Jorgensen's offering you
a good living here.

490
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:49,879
Martin, there's something
I want you to know...

491
00:50:50,045 --> 00:50:51,915
Yeah, I know
what you want me to know.

492
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:54,878
That I got no kin,
I got no money, no horses!

493
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,760
All I got here is a bunch
of dead man's clothes to wear!

494
00:50:58,928 --> 00:51:02,268
Well, you told me that already,
so shut your mouth!

495
00:51:14,277 --> 00:51:18,487
- Morning, Laurie.
- Morning, Martin. Did you sleep well?

496
00:51:18,656 --> 00:51:21,486
Well, no, l...

497
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:25,959
I kind of tossed and turned...

498
00:51:26,122 --> 00:51:28,002
...and dreamed.

499
00:51:40,595 --> 00:51:42,885
I'll get your coffee.

500
00:51:44,682 --> 00:51:46,522
You know, Laurie, l...

501
00:51:46,684 --> 00:51:48,314
I was just thinking that...

502
00:51:48,478 --> 00:51:52,018
...maybe it's about time you and me
started going steady, huh?

503
00:51:52,982 --> 00:51:56,822
Martin pawley, you and me been
going steady since we was 3 years old.

504
00:51:56,986 --> 00:52:00,616
- We have?
- About time you found out about it.

505
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:03,872
Well, gosh, Laurie,
I've always been fond of you...

506
00:52:04,035 --> 00:52:07,865
...but, well, with all this trouble
with Debbie and Ethan, I...

507
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:10,539
Ethan rode on an hour ago.

508
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:14,502
Martin, I don't know what you can
do about finding Debbie that he can't.

509
00:52:14,671 --> 00:52:16,841
He'll find her now, Martin.
Honest, he will!

510
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:19,839
That's what I'm afraid of, Laurie.

511
00:52:20,009 --> 00:52:22,139
Him finding her.

512
00:52:22,512 --> 00:52:26,182
Oh, I've seen his eyes
at the very word "comanche."

513
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:29,059
I've seen him take his knife and...

514
00:52:30,228 --> 00:52:32,398
Never mind.
He's a man that can go crazy wild...

515
00:52:32,564 --> 00:52:35,574
...and I intend to be there
to stop him in case he does.

516
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,740
I was hoping I could hold you here,
but I guess I knew better.

517
00:52:41,197 --> 00:52:42,567
Here.

518
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,580
I stole that for you.

519
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:56,251
"I bought a..."

520
00:52:56,421 --> 00:52:59,091
oh, here, let me read it for you.

521
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:02,509
"I bought a small-sized dress
off a lnjun."

522
00:53:02,677 --> 00:53:06,217
If this here's a piece of your
child's dress, bring reward.

523
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:07,889
I know where they gone.

524
00:53:08,057 --> 00:53:11,267
- "Jerem futterman."
- Jerem futterman?

525
00:53:11,478 --> 00:53:15,108
Well, Laurie, he's got a small trading
post on the south fork of the brazos.

526
00:53:15,273 --> 00:53:17,733
I just gotta get a horse!
Do you think your pa...?

527
00:53:17,901 --> 00:53:21,031
- Finish your breakfast!
- But, Laurie, I gotta find him!

528
00:53:21,196 --> 00:53:26,526
- All right, go on and find him!
- Oh, Laurie, don't you understand?

529
00:53:36,294 --> 00:53:38,804
Laurie, that's your own good horse.
That's sweetface.

530
00:53:38,963 --> 00:53:40,723
You take him, and welcome!

531
00:53:40,882 --> 00:53:44,052
But don't you count on
finding me here when you get back.

532
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:46,759
I been hanging around
this godforsaken windscour...

533
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:51,480
...for two long years waiting for you.
I ain't cut out to be no old maid.

534
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:56,230
Well, I'm sorry, Laurie.
But I just gotta catch up with Ethan.

535
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:59,187
Well, go ahead
and catch up with him, then!

536
00:54:16,334 --> 00:54:18,174
- Futterman?
- Yeah?

537
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:20,206
Let's talk.

538
00:54:25,176 --> 00:54:28,846
- You sent me a letter.
- Yeah?

539
00:54:29,013 --> 00:54:31,103
About a dress.

540
00:54:44,153 --> 00:54:45,493
How'd you come by it?

541
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:48,615
- You said there'd be a $1000 reward.
- That's what I said.

542
00:54:48,783 --> 00:54:50,623
Got it with you?

543
00:54:50,827 --> 00:54:53,997
You'll get the reward when
I find her and if she's still alive.

544
00:54:54,163 --> 00:54:56,583
A man's got a right to expect
some kind of payment.

545
00:54:56,749 --> 00:54:59,629
I laid out for that dress
and sending you that writing.

546
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:05,968
- Twenty yankee dollars.
- And a man's time is worth something.

547
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:07,759
Talk.

548
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:12,561
A young buck fetched it in
late last summer.

549
00:55:12,724 --> 00:55:15,184
Said it belonged to a captive child
of chief scar.

550
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:18,651
Scar? We ain't never heard of him,
have we?

551
00:55:18,813 --> 00:55:21,903
Me neither. But this buck
claimed he was a big war chief...

552
00:55:22,066 --> 00:55:24,276
- ...with the nawyecky comanches.
- Keep talking.

553
00:55:24,444 --> 00:55:28,244
Scar's band was headed north to winter
in at fort wingate, eating agency beef.

554
00:55:28,406 --> 00:55:30,696
That's what this buck said.
Maybe he lied.

555
00:55:31,784 --> 00:55:33,414
Maybe you lie.

556
00:55:33,578 --> 00:55:35,958
In that case, my friend,
you won't find her...

557
00:55:36,122 --> 00:55:38,372
...and I won't get my $1000.

558
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:41,091
Look, you can spend the night.

559
00:55:41,252 --> 00:55:45,052
- Cards, a jug. And if you'd like to...
- No, thanks.

560
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:48,219
Don't forget to come back
with my $1000.

561
00:55:48,384 --> 00:55:50,604
It ain't yours yet.

562
00:55:52,055 --> 00:55:54,175
Hey, Ethan?

563
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:58,901
Do you have a feeling
that maybe we're being followed?

564
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:01,442
That's the lnjun in you.
Go to sleep.

565
00:56:01,606 --> 00:56:04,276
Them horses there,
they sure act mighty nervous.

566
00:56:04,442 --> 00:56:07,702
Well, they smell
a change in the weather.

567
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,039
Oh, now, come on, Ethan!
Don't put any more wood on the fire.

568
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:20,826
- I'm burning up.
- We might get a frost before morning.

569
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,210
Anyway, I'm getting like
old mose Harper.

570
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,340
My bones is cold tonight.

571
00:56:29,592 --> 00:56:33,392
You know, it's funny...

572
00:56:33,554 --> 00:56:36,814
...but last winter,
when we passed through fort wingate...

573
00:56:36,974 --> 00:56:41,194
...I don't have any recollection
of a mention of nawyecky comanche.

574
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:44,774
Not so funny when you recollect
what "nawyecky" means.

575
00:56:44,941 --> 00:56:47,861
- What's that?
- Sort of like "roundabout."

576
00:56:48,027 --> 00:56:52,617
Man says he's going one place,
means to go tother.

577
00:57:03,876 --> 00:57:06,796
Oh, come on, now, Ethan,
don't put any more wood on the fire!

578
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:08,843
I'm burning up.

579
00:57:16,556 --> 00:57:19,306
- Comfortable?
- Ethan, are you all right?

580
00:57:19,684 --> 00:57:22,024
Well, I'm just saying
good night to you.

581
00:57:22,186 --> 00:57:24,766
Well, good night.

582
00:57:46,836 --> 00:57:50,756
- Good night.
- Well, good night.

583
00:58:20,495 --> 00:58:22,455
Futterman.

584
00:58:37,011 --> 00:58:40,101
Thanks. You did fine.

585
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:44,851
Why, that's Mr. futterman.

586
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:46,979
Ethan, what are you doing anyway?

587
00:58:47,146 --> 00:58:51,106
Getting my money back, you idiot.
What do you suppose?

588
00:58:51,526 --> 00:58:52,896
We did all right.

589
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,330
"We"? Why, you just staked me
out there like a piece of bait!

590
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:06,214
You went and built up the fire, you fixed
it so I could get my brains blowed out!

591
00:59:06,374 --> 00:59:08,754
What if you had missed?

592
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,380
Never occurred to me.

593
00:59:14,173 --> 00:59:16,843
Come on, let's get out of here.

594
00:59:24,851 --> 00:59:27,651
Howdy, Mr. jorgensen.

595
00:59:27,812 --> 00:59:31,232
- Charlie!
- Got me a letter here.

596
00:59:31,399 --> 00:59:34,399
By qolly, a letter?

597
00:59:34,569 --> 00:59:36,199
It's for miss Laurie.

598
00:59:36,362 --> 00:59:39,912
Two letters in one year, by golly!

599
00:59:40,074 --> 00:59:43,164
Mama! Mama! It's Charlie maccorry.

600
00:59:43,327 --> 00:59:47,287
He's come with a letter and
he's come a-courting too, by golly!

601
00:59:47,456 --> 00:59:49,536
Come on.

602
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:53,501
- Good morning, Charlie.
- Howdy, Mrs. jorgensen.

603
00:59:53,671 --> 00:59:56,511
Laurie, here's a letter for you.
Charlie brought it.

604
00:59:56,674 --> 01:00:00,474
I figured it might be the news
you been waiting for, so I...

605
01:00:00,636 --> 01:00:02,636
- Well, thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

606
01:00:02,805 --> 01:00:05,975
- Say, I brung you some boiled sweets.
- Why, thank you, Charlie.

607
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:09,692
Come on, let's sit down and get
comfortable while Laurie reads the letter.

608
01:00:09,854 --> 01:00:11,694
I reckon I really ought to be going...

609
01:00:11,856 --> 01:00:15,396
- No, sit down, Charlie.
- No, no, you stay, Charlie. After all...

610
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:18,948
...Charlie brought the letter, Laurie.
He's got a right to listen too.

611
01:00:19,113 --> 01:00:23,083
- I'll sit a spell.
- Come on, Laurie, read the letter.

612
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,250
- Oh, ma, it's my letter.
- Of course it is, dear. But read it.

613
01:00:27,413 --> 01:00:30,123
Go ahead. Read it.

614
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:39,547
Please.

615
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:42,887
"Dear miss laury..."

616
01:00:43,054 --> 01:00:45,064
spelled it with a y
instead of an I-e.

617
01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:47,732
- You'd think he'd know better.
- Oh, spelling, please.

618
01:00:47,892 --> 01:00:50,652
What's the difference?
Read the letter.

619
01:00:52,021 --> 01:00:56,941
"Dear miss laury,
I take pencil in hand to let you know..."

620
01:00:57,109 --> 01:01:01,069
...Ethan and me still are trying
to catch up with them comanches...

621
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:04,698
"...the late Mr. futterman
told us about."

622
01:01:05,201 --> 01:01:06,621
The late Mr. futterman.

623
01:01:06,786 --> 01:01:09,536
That means Mr. futterman is dead,
by golly.

624
01:01:09,705 --> 01:01:13,325
- Oh, the poor man. Go ahead, Laurie.
- Yeah.

625
01:01:14,085 --> 01:01:20,465
"We out north through Indian
territory and did not have no trouble..."

626
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:23,723
...finding kiowas and wichitas...

627
01:01:23,886 --> 01:01:26,306
...and even some comanches...

628
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:29,022
...camped by one of the agencies.

629
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:32,142
But none of them was nawyeckys...

630
01:01:32,311 --> 01:01:36,981
"...nor claimed to know
a war chief called scar."

631
01:01:37,233 --> 01:01:38,863
Scar.

632
01:01:41,028 --> 01:01:47,118
"He's the one the late
Mr. futterman said had Debbie."

633
01:01:47,952 --> 01:01:51,292
At one of the agencies, we outfitted...

634
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:54,625
<i>...with all kind and manner
of trade goods...</i>

635
01:01:54,792 --> 01:02:00,672
<i>...figuring that'd make it easier
for us to come and go.</i>

636
01:02:02,883 --> 01:02:08,973
<i>"You'd laugh if I told you
what was our biggest seller."</i>

637
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:00,730
Let's go. I think I stumbled
onto something.

638
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,230
Scar? You found him?

639
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:04,901
When are you gonna learn
to keep your big mouth shut?

640
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:06,911
Get your horse. Let's get out of here.

641
01:03:07,073 --> 01:03:10,333
- I just bought me a good blanket...
- Forget it. Move!

642
01:03:15,247 --> 01:03:18,997
What I heard back there was
that a band of hostile comanche...

643
01:03:19,168 --> 01:03:21,338
...came through less than a week ago.

644
01:03:21,504 --> 01:03:24,514
I asked if there was
a white girl with them.

645
01:03:24,673 --> 01:03:26,683
They got sullen and suspicious.

646
01:03:26,842 --> 01:03:30,512
- Do you...? Think it might have been...?
- I don't know.

647
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:38,349
What's she following us for?

648
01:03:39,146 --> 01:03:43,276
Oh, you... you go on back now. Go on.

649
01:03:43,734 --> 01:03:46,784
Oh, look, I changed my mind.
You can keep your blanket.

650
01:03:51,158 --> 01:03:54,408
Oh, look, you don't understand.
I don't want it!

651
01:03:54,578 --> 01:03:57,538
You don't understand, you chunk head.

652
01:03:57,706 --> 01:03:59,826
You didn't buy any blanket.

653
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,380
You bought her.

654
01:04:01,544 --> 01:04:03,634
You got yourself a wife, Sonny.

655
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:07,376
Oh, no. Ethan, you tell her
to get on back there.

656
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:10,760
What? And have her whole family
after our scalps...

657
01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:14,678
...for flaunting one of
their womenfolk? No, sir.

658
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:17,099
Come on, Mrs. pawley.

659
01:04:17,268 --> 01:04:20,938
Come on, Mrs. pawley.
Join our merry crew.

660
01:04:21,105 --> 01:04:23,685
"Mrs. pawley"?

661
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:26,688
Oh, no.

662
01:04:26,902 --> 01:04:30,952
"There is one other thing
I got to tell you..."

663
01:04:31,115 --> 01:04:34,405
...before you hear it from Ethan.

664
01:04:35,703 --> 01:04:38,793
How I got myself...

665
01:04:39,123 --> 01:04:40,463
"...a wife."

666
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:44,587
- He did?
- Good!

667
01:04:44,753 --> 01:04:48,593
A young man should get married
early in life. Right, mama?

668
01:04:52,595 --> 01:04:56,135
- Go ahead and read the letter, Laurie.
- Yeah.

669
01:04:58,225 --> 01:05:03,225
"A little comanche squaw..."

670
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:05,901
squaw!

671
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:10,738
- Laurie, you ought to be spanked!
- Laurie, you come back...

672
01:05:10,905 --> 01:05:13,565
- ...and read the letter. Come on, now.
- This is a shame.

673
01:05:13,741 --> 01:05:16,081
Come on back and read it. Please.

674
01:05:17,203 --> 01:05:20,963
Mama, here. You read the letter.

675
01:05:21,707 --> 01:05:26,457
Charlie, my wife, she was
a schoolteacher. She reads good.

676
01:05:27,922 --> 01:05:29,262
I'll read it.

677
01:05:29,423 --> 01:05:33,223
So he married a comanche squaw.

678
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:38,218
By golly.

679
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:47,401
"She wasn't near as old as you."

680
01:05:47,733 --> 01:05:51,073
How old does he think I am?!

681
01:05:52,029 --> 01:05:56,619
Hey, look, coffee. Me, coffee.

682
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:06,252
Could I have a little, Mrs. pawley?

683
01:06:07,378 --> 01:06:09,338
Yes, sir.

684
01:06:09,505 --> 01:06:13,255
Looks like Mrs. pawley's
gonna make you a fine, dutiful wife.

685
01:06:13,425 --> 01:06:16,255
Oh, cut it out, will you?

686
01:06:18,847 --> 01:06:24,517
Oh, look. I sure do wish
I could make you understand.

687
01:06:26,146 --> 01:06:27,856
Look?

688
01:06:32,027 --> 01:06:33,357
Look.

689
01:06:33,529 --> 01:06:38,739
She says her name is
wild goose flying in the night sky.

690
01:06:38,909 --> 01:06:43,119
But she'll answer to "look"
if that pleases you.

691
01:07:15,529 --> 01:07:19,579
You know, that's grounds
for divorce in Texas.

692
01:07:21,285 --> 01:07:22,945
You're really rough!

693
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,670
Well, I don't think
it's so dadburn funny.

694
01:07:26,832 --> 01:07:31,092
Look, if you really wanna do some good,
why don't you ask her where soar is?

695
01:07:36,383 --> 01:07:38,343
She heard you.

696
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:49,103
- You ask her.
- Look, scar?

697
01:07:49,271 --> 01:07:50,981
Do you know where he went?

698
01:07:51,148 --> 01:07:54,148
Did he have a girl with him?
A white girl?

699
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,655
No. No, not a woman. It's...

700
01:08:04,244 --> 01:08:06,084
Sister.

701
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:22,761
Martin!

702
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:33,979
Look's gone.

703
01:08:34,608 --> 01:08:36,608
Pulled out in the night.

704
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:42,370
Well, she ain't going back to her family,
that's for certain.

705
01:08:42,533 --> 01:08:45,453
She took off the way
that arrow's pointing.

706
01:08:45,619 --> 01:08:48,249
Well, think maybe
we ought to follow her?

707
01:08:48,414 --> 01:08:50,294
How should I know?

708
01:08:50,457 --> 01:08:52,747
She's your wife.

709
01:08:55,587 --> 01:08:57,707
<i>Maybe she left other signs
for us to follow...</i>

710
01:08:58,132 --> 01:08:59,722
"... But we'll never know...

711
01:08:59,883 --> 01:09:04,223
...because it snowed that day
and all the next week."

712
01:09:07,433 --> 01:09:09,773
<i>We were heading north
through buffalo country...</i>

713
01:09:09,935 --> 01:09:13,685
<i>...when something happened that
I ain't got straight in my own mind yet.</i>

714
01:09:13,856 --> 01:09:16,526
<i>But on this day
we sighted a small herd.</i>

715
01:09:16,692 --> 01:09:18,032
<i>See, we needed some meat...</i>

716
01:09:18,193 --> 01:09:21,703
<i>...so we circled round
and come up on them afoot.</i>

717
01:09:58,358 --> 01:10:00,898
- Ethan, don't make no sense.
- Hunger! Empty bellies!

718
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:03,659
That's the sense it makes,
you blanket head!

719
01:10:03,822 --> 01:10:05,912
You need to stop it!

720
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:16,843
At least they won't feed
any comanche this winter.

721
01:10:18,462 --> 01:10:21,722
- Ethan, listen! Listen!
- Killing buffaloes is like killing lnjuns.

722
01:10:21,882 --> 01:10:23,762
- You just gotta...
- Listen!

723
01:10:36,438 --> 01:10:38,188
Come on!

724
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,239
<i>It was the nawyecky comanche,
all right.</i>

725
01:11:31,451 --> 01:11:34,541
<i>The ones we'd been looking for
all this time.</i>

726
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,050
Many

727
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:08,855
it's look.

728
01:12:10,365 --> 01:12:11,985
Look?

729
01:12:13,535 --> 01:12:17,115
What did them soldiers have to kill
her for? She never done nobody harm.

730
01:12:17,289 --> 01:12:19,919
We gotta catch up with them.
Maybe they've got Debbie.

731
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:23,883
Maybe they got that chief
they call scar.

732
01:12:24,046 --> 01:12:26,716
<i>So we figured Debbie had been
in the village.</i>

733
01:12:26,882 --> 01:12:29,722
<i>What look was doing there,
whether she'd come to warn him...</i>

734
01:12:29,885 --> 01:12:34,215
<i>...or maybe to find Debbie for me,
there's no way of knowing.</i>

735
01:13:18,058 --> 01:13:22,518
- Come on, move along, move along.
- Go on there. Go on up there.

736
01:13:22,938 --> 01:13:25,568
Come on, move along there.
Hurry up, move along now.

737
01:13:36,618 --> 01:13:41,538
Come on, hurry up, get along.
Go on, get up. Hurry up.

738
01:13:42,082 --> 01:13:44,672
- Evening.
- Yes?

739
01:13:44,835 --> 01:13:47,205
We're looking for a girl.
White girl, captive.

740
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:49,379
Should be about 14 now.

741
01:13:49,548 --> 01:13:51,378
Fourteen? We've got two
about that age.

742
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:52,880
- Where?
- Sergeant?

743
01:13:53,051 --> 01:13:54,851
All the white women
are in the chapel.

744
01:13:55,011 --> 01:13:56,351
What's this girl to you?

745
01:13:56,513 --> 01:13:58,473
- She's my niece.
- She's my...

746
01:13:59,766 --> 01:14:01,636
One moment.

747
01:14:04,146 --> 01:14:06,266
- White women?
- Yes, sir.

748
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:34,470
Could you stand up?

749
01:14:34,926 --> 01:14:36,296
Stand up, please.

750
01:14:42,017 --> 01:14:43,687
Debbie?

751
01:14:59,534 --> 01:15:01,914
It's hard to believe they're white.

752
01:15:02,412 --> 01:15:04,502
They ain't white...

753
01:15:04,664 --> 01:15:06,044
...anymore.

754
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,038
They're comanche.

755
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:11,000
Where are your casualties?

756
01:15:29,648 --> 01:15:33,188
Maybe you can help us identify them.
All white. All captives.

757
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,740
There's the white girl there.

758
01:15:45,831 --> 01:15:47,421
No.

759
01:15:50,669 --> 01:15:56,799
"So we're setting out for new Mexico
territory in the morning."

760
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:00,350
I am sorry I won't be back...

761
01:16:00,512 --> 01:16:03,722
...for Christmas again this year.

762
01:16:06,393 --> 01:16:09,983
I set pencil aside in the hope
you are enjoying good health...

763
01:16:10,146 --> 01:16:12,686
...and your folks the same.

764
01:16:12,858 --> 01:16:15,858
I remain, respectfully...

765
01:16:16,236 --> 01:16:19,736
"...yours truly, Martin pawley."

766
01:16:21,324 --> 01:16:24,294
They never find that girl.

767
01:16:24,452 --> 01:16:27,042
Nope, never.

768
01:16:34,963 --> 01:16:37,673
"Yours truly."

769
01:16:39,301 --> 01:16:42,851
Ma, he had to sign his whole name,
"Martin pawley."

770
01:16:43,013 --> 01:16:45,813
He couldn't write just "Marty."

771
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,690
- I don't care if he never comes back!
- Laurie, Laurie!

772
01:16:50,854 --> 01:16:54,444
Charlie, you stay for supper.
I won't take no for an answer.

773
01:16:54,608 --> 01:16:59,448
The thought of saying no never
entered my head, Mrs. jorgensen.

774
01:16:59,821 --> 01:17:02,951
Ain't no place I'd rather be
than right here...

775
01:17:03,617 --> 01:17:05,617
...right now.

776
01:17:49,037 --> 01:17:51,667
- Recognize it?
- That?

777
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:55,631
Couldn't be two like that
in the whole world. Mose!

778
01:17:56,086 --> 01:17:58,546
Mose Harper!

779
01:18:01,466 --> 01:18:03,886
- Hey, mose!
- Sure is good to see you!

780
01:18:04,052 --> 01:18:06,262
Mose, you look mangier than ever.

781
01:18:06,763 --> 01:18:09,063
- How about a drink?
- Yes, sir. Thank you kindly.

782
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:11,394
- Tequila.
- Ain't been too good.

783
01:18:11,559 --> 01:18:13,729
No, sir. Not too good.

784
01:18:13,895 --> 01:18:16,685
- Getting old.
- You were born old.

785
01:18:16,856 --> 01:18:20,066
Been helping you, Ethan.
Been looking all the time.

786
01:18:20,235 --> 01:18:23,275
Well, reward still stands.

787
01:18:24,531 --> 01:18:28,491
Don't want no money, Ethan.
No money, Marty.

788
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:33,250
Just a roof over old mose's head...

789
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:35,955
...and a rocking chair by the fire.

790
01:18:36,126 --> 01:18:39,796
My own rocking chair
by the fire, Marty.

791
01:18:39,963 --> 01:18:43,013
You help us find that girl,
you got your rocking chair.

792
01:18:43,174 --> 01:18:45,304
Swear it, Ethan? Given word?

793
01:18:45,468 --> 01:18:47,968
I told you, didn't I?

794
01:18:48,263 --> 01:18:51,683
Ethan, I found a man who's seen her.

795
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:54,140
Knows where little Debbie is.

796
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:56,730
Where is he? Who is this man?

797
01:18:56,896 --> 01:18:59,606
- Promise?
- Who is this man?

798
01:19:00,025 --> 01:19:02,355
I am this man, sefior.

799
01:19:02,902 --> 01:19:06,072
Emilio Gabriel Fernandez y figueroa.

800
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,949
At your service. For a price.

801
01:19:09,117 --> 01:19:11,367
Always for a price.

802
01:19:23,923 --> 01:19:27,473
- Say, I think I'd like just...
- Wait till you grow up.

803
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:56,709
Let's talk a little business.

804
01:19:58,249 --> 01:19:59,959
Why not.

805
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:16,180
<i>Mamacita, més frijo/es, please.</i>

806
01:20:31,825 --> 01:20:33,155
Let's go.

807
01:20:33,326 --> 01:20:36,156
- But I'm hungry.
- Well, while you're filling your belly...

808
01:20:36,329 --> 01:20:39,209
...I'm going out to meet
a comanche named cicatriz.

809
01:20:39,374 --> 01:20:41,424
Never heard of him.

810
01:20:41,584 --> 01:20:45,714
Cicatriz is Mexican for "scar."

811
01:22:07,045 --> 01:22:09,255
Medicine country, huh?

812
01:22:09,422 --> 01:22:11,882
Bad medicine, I think.

813
01:22:35,031 --> 01:22:40,501
- This is the great cicatriz, war chief...
- Scar, huh?

814
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:47,670
Plain to see how you got your name.

815
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:51,130
You, big shoulders.

816
01:22:51,297 --> 01:22:55,507
Young one, he who follows.

817
01:22:55,718 --> 01:23:00,348
You speak pretty good American
for a comanche.

818
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:02,725
Someone teach you?

819
01:23:11,025 --> 01:23:14,645
Right. We come to trade.
Only, not out here.

820
01:23:14,821 --> 01:23:17,821
I don't stand talking in the wind.

821
01:23:42,932 --> 01:23:47,022
You speak good comanche.
Someone teach you?

822
01:23:47,937 --> 01:23:51,357
- You stay out of here.
- Not likely.

823
01:23:56,904 --> 01:24:01,744
His sons are dead, so his wives
sit on the honor side of his lodge.

824
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,830
Are all those his wives?

825
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:12,921
Two sons killed by white men.

826
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:18,128
For each son, I take many...

827
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:20,301
Scalps.

828
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:56,205
We've seen scalps before.

829
01:24:58,216 --> 01:25:00,586
This before?

830
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,440
I came to trade,
not to admire his collection.

831
01:25:09,602 --> 01:25:12,612
Tell him we'll pitch camp
the other side of the creek.

832
01:25:12,814 --> 01:25:16,284
- Talk tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

833
01:25:30,415 --> 01:25:35,085
- It is not that I am afraid.
- Don't apologize. You got well-paid.

834
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:40,840
But he knows who you are. And why
you're here. This I did not know.

835
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,390
Take it. I do not want blood money.

836
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,580
You think old scar means to kill us?

837
01:26:07,743 --> 01:26:09,623
He's got to.

838
01:26:09,787 --> 01:26:12,917
We've been asking for it for five years.

839
01:26:13,082 --> 01:26:17,302
Well, why didn't he make his move
back there?

840
01:26:18,254 --> 01:26:22,844
Hospitality, I guess.
Comanche hospitality.

841
01:26:25,178 --> 01:26:28,258
Why? Do you wanna pull out too'?

842
01:26:32,518 --> 01:26:34,938
"Big shoulders."

843
01:26:46,574 --> 01:26:48,244
Debbie?

844
01:26:50,369 --> 01:26:55,079
Debbie. Debbie, don't you remember?
I'm Martin. I'm Martin, your brother.

845
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:57,788
Remember?

846
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,380
Debbie, remember back.

847
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:06,013
Do you remember how I used
to let you ride my horse?

848
01:27:06,511 --> 01:27:08,971
And tell you stories?

849
01:27:10,223 --> 01:27:12,233
Don't you remember me, Debbie?

850
01:27:12,683 --> 01:27:14,733
I remember.

851
01:27:15,186 --> 01:27:17,306
From always.

852
01:27:18,314 --> 01:27:20,324
At first, I prayed to you:

853
01:27:20,733 --> 01:27:22,783
"Come and get me...

854
01:27:22,944 --> 01:27:24,284
...take me home."

855
01:27:24,737 --> 01:27:26,697
You didn't come.

856
01:27:28,032 --> 01:27:29,952
But I've come now, Debbie.

857
01:27:30,576 --> 01:27:32,656
These are my people.

858
01:27:34,247 --> 01:27:37,497
Go. Go, Martin. Please.

859
01:27:38,501 --> 01:27:40,131
Stand aside, Martin.

860
01:27:44,298 --> 01:27:46,508
No, you don't, Ethan.

861
01:27:46,676 --> 01:27:49,346
Ethan! No, you don't!

862
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:53,018
Stand aside!

863
01:28:11,492 --> 01:28:14,622
Debbie. Debbie.

864
01:30:17,326 --> 01:30:19,076
Well...

865
01:30:19,328 --> 01:30:23,498
...looks as though I'm gonna
have to open that shoulder again...

866
01:30:23,666 --> 01:30:26,166
...get the poison out.

867
01:30:26,335 --> 01:30:28,955
Beats me how you could have
stayed alive this long.

868
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,460
I want you to...

869
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:32,681
To read this.

870
01:30:44,562 --> 01:30:46,062
I

871
01:30:46,939 --> 01:30:50,109
...Ethan Edwards...

872
01:30:50,276 --> 01:30:54,906
...being of a sound mind...

873
01:30:55,197 --> 01:30:56,697
...and...

874
01:30:56,866 --> 01:31:01,616
...without any blood kin...

875
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:10,165
"...do hereby..."

876
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:14,550
"Bequeath." Means "leave."

877
01:31:15,217 --> 01:31:17,547
"Bequeath..."

878
01:31:18,095 --> 01:31:22,345
...all my property...

879
01:31:22,516 --> 01:31:25,016
...of any kind...

880
01:31:25,186 --> 01:31:27,266
...to...

881
01:31:27,897 --> 01:31:30,187
"...Martin pawley."

882
01:31:32,693 --> 01:31:35,863
What do you mean,
you don't have any blood kin?

883
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:39,660
- Why, Debbie's your blood kin!
- Not no more, she ain't.

884
01:31:40,075 --> 01:31:42,405
Well, you can keep your will!

885
01:31:42,578 --> 01:31:44,368
I don't want any of your property!

886
01:31:44,997 --> 01:31:48,287
I ain't forgetting you was getting
all set to shoot her yourself.

887
01:31:48,501 --> 01:31:51,461
- What kind of a man are you?
- She's been living with a buck!

888
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:54,130
- She's nothing but a...
- Shut your dirty mouth!

889
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:02,351
I hope you die.

890
01:32:03,057 --> 01:32:05,477
That'll be the day.

891
01:32:14,068 --> 01:32:15,898
One, two, three, four!

892
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:07,290
Evening, everybody!
Evening, sister. We made it!

893
01:33:07,454 --> 01:33:08,964
- Hello!
- Hello. Where's Charlie?

894
01:33:09,123 --> 01:33:13,463
Well, sister, here he is! All curried and
combed and washed behind the ears.

895
01:33:13,627 --> 01:33:16,547
Charlie, you look right handsome!
I'd hardly know you.

896
01:33:16,714 --> 01:33:20,304
Yes, ma'am. I can't hardly
recognize myself.

897
01:33:20,467 --> 01:33:22,847
Let it on, Luther!

898
01:33:23,929 --> 01:33:25,929
- Hiya, partner.
- Well, howdy, Charlie.

899
01:33:26,098 --> 01:33:28,308
How's your guitar?

900
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,610
- Won't you have a drink, reverend?
- No, nesby...

901
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:45,620
...not till I'm finished my clergying.
Bar's closed. Right, sister jorgensen?

902
01:33:45,784 --> 01:33:48,754
- Right.
- All right, let's go! Let's get her going!

903
01:33:48,913 --> 01:33:50,873
Charlie!

904
01:34:00,466 --> 01:34:02,376
Go ahead, Lars.

905
01:34:04,678 --> 01:34:06,348
Bible.

906
01:34:09,016 --> 01:34:12,476
- Get them spurs off.
- Yes, sir.

907
01:34:15,481 --> 01:34:17,861
All right, line up to the side, boys.

908
01:34:28,786 --> 01:34:30,246
Music.

909
01:35:09,326 --> 01:35:12,156
You don't suppose they're
throwing a party for us, do you?

910
01:35:12,329 --> 01:35:14,619
That'll be the day.

911
01:35:20,212 --> 01:35:22,342
I'm all right.

912
01:35:27,261 --> 01:35:30,221
Ethan, Marty!
No, no, you can't come in!

913
01:35:30,389 --> 01:35:33,099
- The rangers is in there.
- What's that got to do with us?

914
01:35:33,267 --> 01:35:35,347
You been posted for murder,
the both of you!

915
01:35:35,519 --> 01:35:38,109
That trader fella,
the late Mr. futterman.

916
01:35:38,272 --> 01:35:41,072
The reverend and the rangers
are in there now, waiting.

917
01:35:41,233 --> 01:35:43,993
- Well, what's going on anyway?
- Well, the...

918
01:35:52,453 --> 01:35:55,213
Looks like you two will have
a lot to talk about. Come on.

919
01:35:55,372 --> 01:35:59,082
- But, Ethan, hide in the barn...
- What for?

920
01:35:59,752 --> 01:36:01,252
Martin.

921
01:36:04,298 --> 01:36:07,428
Please! Look, everybody!

922
01:36:07,634 --> 01:36:12,264
Look, mama. Look who's here.

923
01:36:12,848 --> 01:36:14,638
Evening.

924
01:36:17,352 --> 01:36:19,772
- Bar open?
- Ethan...

925
01:36:19,938 --> 01:36:22,358
...any news of our little girl?

926
01:36:22,524 --> 01:36:24,824
She's not a little girl anymore.

927
01:36:24,985 --> 01:36:30,275
- You've seen her? She's alive?
- I've seen her. She's alive.

928
01:36:31,075 --> 01:36:32,985
Evening, reverend.

929
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,330
Or should I call you "captain"?

930
01:36:35,496 --> 01:36:37,496
I came here for a wedding, Ethan.

931
01:36:37,664 --> 01:36:40,044
Till that's over, I reckon
"reverend" will do.

932
01:36:40,209 --> 01:36:43,299
- Afterwards, we'll talk.
- Marty with you?

933
01:36:43,462 --> 01:36:45,262
Yep.

934
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:47,930
- Charlie, please.
- Charlie!

935
01:36:48,092 --> 01:36:49,432
Mama! Mama, no!

936
01:36:49,593 --> 01:36:52,603
Good to see you back, Ethan.
We'll join you.

937
01:36:53,972 --> 01:36:56,432
But I wrote you one letter.

938
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,650
One letter in five years.

939
01:36:59,812 --> 01:37:04,272
I read it till the paper dried up
and the writing faded out.

940
01:37:04,775 --> 01:37:08,195
Yeah, guess it wasn't
much of a letter, was it?

941
01:37:08,362 --> 01:37:10,612
No, it wasn't.

942
01:37:11,406 --> 01:37:13,906
You might've at least
said you loved me.

943
01:37:14,076 --> 01:37:18,246
You might've asked me to wait for you.
At least that would've been something.

944
01:37:20,165 --> 01:37:22,495
But I always loved you.

945
01:37:23,085 --> 01:37:26,415
I thought you knew that
without me having to say it.

946
01:37:27,214 --> 01:37:29,974
It isn't fair, Martin pawley.

947
01:37:30,634 --> 01:37:32,304
It isn't fair, and you know it!

948
01:37:32,469 --> 01:37:36,469
- I wish you wouldn't cry, Laurie.
- Who's crying?

949
01:37:42,688 --> 01:37:48,898
Well, I just reckon the best thing
for me to do is go away.

950
01:37:50,028 --> 01:37:54,198
You do, Martin pawley,
and I'll just die!

951
01:38:05,586 --> 01:38:10,046
I'll thank you to unhand my fiancée.

952
01:38:12,968 --> 01:38:16,598
You don't mean you're
gonna be marrying him?

953
01:38:16,763 --> 01:38:20,183
- Charlie maccorry?
- She sure is!

954
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:24,190
And don't think your coming back
is gonna change it either.

955
01:38:24,354 --> 01:38:26,984
Well, now, as to that,
I just don't know, Charlie.

956
01:38:27,149 --> 01:38:29,529
We hadn't gotten around
to talking about marriage.

957
01:38:29,693 --> 01:38:33,073
What right have you got to be talking
marriage to any decent woman?

958
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:35,238
If you're referring to
that murder charge...

959
01:38:35,407 --> 01:38:37,657
And other things.

960
01:38:37,826 --> 01:38:40,616
Maybe you think you was
getting away with being smart...

961
01:38:40,787 --> 01:38:44,077
...about that Indian wife you took.

962
01:38:45,876 --> 01:38:48,126
I'll bet she ain't
the first squaw you ever...

963
01:38:48,295 --> 01:38:51,875
Why, you ornery, no-good son of a...

964
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:55,470
Oh, Marty, you've done it again!

965
01:38:57,888 --> 01:39:00,098
Get out of my way!

966
01:39:00,307 --> 01:39:02,977
Marty, Charlie! I ain't gonna
have fighting in my house.

967
01:39:03,143 --> 01:39:05,983
Well, then we're just gonna
fight outside, doggone it.

968
01:39:06,146 --> 01:39:07,726
I ain't toting no firearms.

969
01:39:07,898 --> 01:39:09,898
Well, that sure ain't
gonna be no problem.

970
01:39:10,067 --> 01:39:12,187
Ma! Pa! Reverend Clayton!

971
01:39:12,361 --> 01:39:15,491
- After you, Marty.
- After you, Charlie.

972
01:39:15,697 --> 01:39:19,657
Pa! Reverend Clayton! Pa!

973
01:39:21,995 --> 01:39:23,745
Well, here.

974
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:28,673
Thank you.

975
01:39:36,551 --> 01:39:39,601
Spit over that piece of firewood.

976
01:39:56,488 --> 01:39:59,988
Quit that, Marty! That ain't fair!

977
01:40:03,954 --> 01:40:07,674
Martin! Martin! Charlie!

978
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:11,955
- Marty, now you stop that. Marty!
- Marty! Charlie!

979
01:40:12,129 --> 01:40:14,209
- Marty!
"Stop it!"

980
01:40:15,465 --> 01:40:19,795
- Sergeant maccorry! Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?

981
01:40:19,970 --> 01:40:22,600
Is this here altercation
in the line of duty?

982
01:40:23,056 --> 01:40:26,226
No, sir. It's more in the nature
of a private fight.

983
01:40:26,393 --> 01:40:31,483
Well, all right, then. Go ahead.
But fight fair. No biting or gouging.

984
01:40:31,648 --> 01:40:34,028
And no kicking either!

985
01:40:35,152 --> 01:40:37,532
Get them up, get them up.
Make them fight fair.

986
01:40:37,696 --> 01:40:39,356
All right. You fight fair, Martin!

987
01:40:39,531 --> 01:40:41,201
Hey, wait a minute, Marty.

988
01:40:41,366 --> 01:40:45,866
- Somebody's fiddle.
- Hey, Seth.

989
01:40:46,538 --> 01:40:49,618
- No choking. No gouging.
- Come on, Charlie. Give it to him.

990
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,840
Pa! Mr. Edwards, make them stop!

991
01:40:53,003 --> 01:40:58,383
- Why? You started it.
- Marty, watch his feet!

992
01:40:58,925 --> 01:41:03,255
- Oh, Ethan, no!
- Don't forget you're a lady.

993
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:05,350
- Come on!
- Fight fair now.

994
01:41:05,515 --> 01:41:07,385
Fight fair!

995
01:41:08,769 --> 01:41:10,599
- Don't let Charlie...
- Come on, Charlie!

996
01:41:10,812 --> 01:41:13,902
- That's it, Charlie.
- Thattaboy, Charlie!

997
01:41:17,611 --> 01:41:21,161
Charlie, Charlie!
Come on, Charlie, get up here.

998
01:41:21,323 --> 01:41:23,623
- Charlie, you all right?
- Marty, Marty, come on.

999
01:41:23,784 --> 01:41:25,954
I reckon so.

1000
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:29,960
Now, come on. I want you boys
to shake hands and make friends.

1001
01:41:31,541 --> 01:41:34,421
Sorry I bit your ear, Marty.

1002
01:41:34,586 --> 01:41:38,006
Oh, it... it don't hurt none, Charlie.

1003
01:41:38,173 --> 01:41:42,183
Now, you boys get cleaned up
and we'll proceed with the wedding.

1004
01:41:42,344 --> 01:41:46,314
- Oh, where's my Bible?
- There ain't gonna be no wedding.

1005
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:57,820
Not till we get a few things
cleared up around here.

1006
01:42:01,488 --> 01:42:04,908
Well, sister jorgensen,
it was a nice wedding party...

1007
01:42:05,075 --> 01:42:07,945
...considering nobody got married.

1008
01:42:10,914 --> 01:42:15,844
Ethan, I gotta ask you and Martin to take
a ride with me down to the state capital.

1009
01:42:16,253 --> 01:42:19,633
Is this an invite
to a necktie party, reverend?

1010
01:42:19,798 --> 01:42:22,378
No, I wouldn't say that.

1011
01:42:22,551 --> 01:42:26,261
Likely you had your reasons
for killing futterman.

1012
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:28,560
Probably needed killing.

1013
01:42:28,723 --> 01:42:33,233
I'm talking to you now as a ranger,
not as a preacher.

1014
01:42:33,395 --> 01:42:36,185
The fact that all three of them
was shot in the back...

1015
01:42:36,356 --> 01:42:39,476
...was the only thing that
raised some question.

1016
01:42:39,651 --> 01:42:41,571
That“

1017
01:42:41,736 --> 01:42:45,616
...and a missing gold piece that was
known to have been on him...

1018
01:42:46,116 --> 01:42:49,156
...just prior to his demise.

1019
01:42:50,287 --> 01:42:54,247
Ethan, I have to ask you for your gun.

1020
01:43:06,386 --> 01:43:09,216
Well, if it's all the same
to you, reverend...

1021
01:43:09,473 --> 01:43:12,683
- ...I ain't going to Austin.
- You're going if the captain says so.

1022
01:43:12,851 --> 01:43:14,981
- Boys! Charlie!
- Stop it! Stop it!

1023
01:43:15,145 --> 01:43:17,555
I'll put both of you in
the smokehouse to cool off!

1024
01:43:17,731 --> 01:43:20,441
- Marty, sit down!
- Sergeant!

1025
01:43:21,651 --> 01:43:24,701
Good evening, ma'am.
Captain Clayton.

1026
01:43:25,489 --> 01:43:26,869
Excuse me, ma'am.

1027
01:43:27,866 --> 01:43:31,406
- Captain Clayton, sir.
- No.

1028
01:43:31,828 --> 01:43:33,538
I'm captain Clayton.

1029
01:43:33,705 --> 01:43:36,205
- You're captain Clayton?
- Yes, I'm captain Clayton.

1030
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,590
Colonel greenhill's compliments, sir.

1031
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,752
- The colonel wants to...
- Ls your head cold?

1032
01:43:40,921 --> 01:43:42,671
No, sir.

1033
01:43:42,881 --> 01:43:44,801
I'm sorry, sir.
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

1034
01:43:44,966 --> 01:43:46,636
All right, start at the beginning.

1035
01:43:46,801 --> 01:43:49,431
Colonel greenhill's compliments.
The colonel wishes...

1036
01:43:49,596 --> 01:43:51,966
Hold on. Who is this colonel
you're talking about?

1037
01:43:52,140 --> 01:43:54,640
Colonel greenhill is colonel greenhill.
Commanding...

1038
01:43:54,809 --> 01:43:57,689
- And who are you?
- I'm lieutenant greenhill, sir.

1039
01:43:57,854 --> 01:44:00,194
What is it your pa wants to know?

1040
01:44:00,815 --> 01:44:02,685
Well, go ahead.

1041
01:44:02,859 --> 01:44:05,569
My pa wants to know...
Colonel greenhill wants to know...

1042
01:44:05,737 --> 01:44:08,817
- ...how soon you can put a company...
- Turn around, Sonny.

1043
01:44:09,282 --> 01:44:12,332
Yeah, he's a yankee cavalryman.

1044
01:44:12,494 --> 01:44:15,004
Colonel greenhill wants to know
how soon you could...

1045
01:44:15,163 --> 01:44:19,043
- I resent that, sir.
- Just funning, son, just funning.

1046
01:44:19,209 --> 01:44:21,749
He wants to know how soon
you can put men in the field...

1047
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,170
...for joint punitive action
against the comanche.

1048
01:44:24,339 --> 01:44:26,799
- Joint what?
- Joint punitive action.

1049
01:44:26,967 --> 01:44:30,887
We received information about a band
of comanches under a chief named scar.

1050
01:44:31,054 --> 01:44:33,434
- What information?
- That he's not far from here...

1051
01:44:33,598 --> 01:44:36,428
- ...holed up somewhere.
- What makes you think he's not far?

1052
01:44:36,601 --> 01:44:38,521
Yesterday, a patrol
picked up a man...

1053
01:44:38,687 --> 01:44:41,017
...claims he was scar's prisoner
two days ago.

1054
01:44:41,189 --> 01:44:43,359
Talks kind of crazy,
but we brought him along.

1055
01:44:43,525 --> 01:44:46,025
Says he lives here.
Keeps mentioning a rocking chair.

1056
01:44:46,194 --> 01:44:48,364
Mose. Mose!

1057
01:44:49,906 --> 01:44:51,776
Mose!

1058
01:44:52,576 --> 01:44:54,866
Take his arms, Sam.

1059
01:44:56,621 --> 01:44:58,961
- Old mose.
- It's mose!

1060
01:44:59,124 --> 01:45:02,594
Evening, ma'am.
Come for my rocking chair.

1061
01:45:02,752 --> 01:45:04,052
Bring him to the fire.

1062
01:45:04,212 --> 01:45:06,342
- Watch him!
- Grab him!

1063
01:45:07,299 --> 01:45:08,969
Get him up.

1064
01:45:09,342 --> 01:45:12,142
- Here, get him a chair.
- Charlie.

1065
01:45:12,304 --> 01:45:14,474
Bring him a drink.

1066
01:45:14,973 --> 01:45:17,433
- Watch his head.
- Here you are, mose.

1067
01:45:17,601 --> 01:45:19,271
- Take a big swallow.
- Take a drink.

1068
01:45:19,436 --> 01:45:21,976
- Drink that down. Make you feel better.
- That's it.

1069
01:45:25,275 --> 01:45:28,235
Mose. Scar, where is he?

1070
01:45:28,403 --> 01:45:31,913
My rocking chair.
You promised me my rocking chair.

1071
01:45:32,073 --> 01:45:33,873
- Where is scar?
- Ask him about Debbie.

1072
01:45:34,034 --> 01:45:36,374
Is Debbie all right, mose?

1073
01:45:37,787 --> 01:45:40,957
Made out I was crazy.

1074
01:45:43,376 --> 01:45:45,796
You don't think I'm crazy,
do you, ma'am?

1075
01:45:45,962 --> 01:45:49,512
- No, mose, you're just sick and hurt.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1076
01:45:49,674 --> 01:45:53,054
Mose, try and remember.
You were at scar's camp.

1077
01:45:53,345 --> 01:45:56,215
Ate dirt, chewed grass.
I fooled them...

1078
01:45:56,389 --> 01:45:58,729
Where's scar holed up?

1079
01:45:58,892 --> 01:46:01,022
Won't tell you.

1080
01:46:02,145 --> 01:46:03,935
Tell Marty.

1081
01:46:04,105 --> 01:46:06,565
Seven fingers, Marty.

1082
01:46:06,775 --> 01:46:09,275
- Seven fingers.
- That's enough. Let's get him to bed.

1083
01:46:09,444 --> 01:46:11,324
Wait a minute. Seven fingers?

1084
01:46:12,072 --> 01:46:14,202
Beg to report, sir.
That's what he told us...

1085
01:46:14,366 --> 01:46:16,276
...but there's no such place
on the maps.

1086
01:46:16,493 --> 01:46:18,293
Say...

1087
01:46:18,453 --> 01:46:22,543
Say, isn't it the caddo name for where
all them canyons join under the malpais?

1088
01:46:22,707 --> 01:46:25,417
- Seven fingers. Seven fingers of brazos!
- Caddo or kiowa.

1089
01:46:25,585 --> 01:46:28,585
- Boy!
- Come on. Let's get him up to his room.

1090
01:46:28,755 --> 01:46:30,755
My rocking chair.
I want my rocking chair.

1091
01:46:30,924 --> 01:46:33,224
- We'll bring it.
- We'll bring it.

1092
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:35,800
You go tell your pa that
a company of rangers...

1093
01:46:35,970 --> 01:46:39,930
...all 14 of them, fully armed and
equipped, will be in the field by daylight.

1094
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:42,480
We'll be heading for the south end
of the malpais.

1095
01:46:42,644 --> 01:46:44,854
If he can catch up with us,
all well and good.

1096
01:46:45,021 --> 01:46:49,071
But, captain, we can't possibly take the
field tomorrow. For your own protection.

1097
01:46:49,234 --> 01:46:53,614
Our protect...?! Sonny, out yonder is
a passel of murderers...

1098
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:56,910
...complete with texican scalps
and a white-girl captive.

1099
01:46:57,075 --> 01:46:59,905
You wanna protect us,
just keep out of our way.

1100
01:47:00,078 --> 01:47:02,248
Now you skedaddle back to your pa!

1101
01:47:02,414 --> 01:47:07,044
Ethan, you and Martin are hereby
appointed civilian scouts. Without pay.

1102
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:11,670
Charlie, take the boys and get back to
headquarters and pick up the company.

1103
01:47:14,259 --> 01:47:16,009
Martin?

1104
01:47:21,307 --> 01:47:24,187
You're not going. Not this time.

1105
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:27,441
- You crazy?
- It's too late.

1106
01:47:27,605 --> 01:47:29,435
She's a woman grown now.

1107
01:47:29,607 --> 01:47:32,277
But I gotta go, Laurie.
I gotta fetch her home.

1108
01:47:32,444 --> 01:47:34,074
Fetch what home?

1109
01:47:34,237 --> 01:47:37,157
The leavings of comanche bucks,
sold to the highest bidder...

1110
01:47:37,323 --> 01:47:39,413
- ...with savage brats of her own?
- Shut your mouth!

1111
01:47:39,576 --> 01:47:41,996
Do you know what Ethan will do
if he has a chance?

1112
01:47:42,162 --> 01:47:44,792
He'll put a bullet in her brain.

1113
01:47:44,998 --> 01:47:47,458
I tell you, Martha would want him to.

1114
01:47:47,625 --> 01:47:49,955
Only if I'm dead.

1115
01:48:38,009 --> 01:48:40,929
We can get within
a couple of hundred yards of them.

1116
01:48:41,095 --> 01:48:44,095
There's a hub back off the left.

1117
01:48:44,724 --> 01:48:46,814
How many you figure?

1118
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:49,306
About a dozen each.

1119
01:48:49,479 --> 01:48:51,979
Enough to go around.

1120
01:48:55,568 --> 01:48:58,778
I'll see you later.

1121
01:48:59,864 --> 01:49:03,414
Well, we found them.

1122
01:49:03,576 --> 01:49:04,946
Now, men...

1123
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:10,499
...the state of Texas is paying you
12 yankee dollars a month.

1124
01:49:10,667 --> 01:49:12,707
Now's your chance to earn it.

1125
01:49:13,044 --> 01:49:16,714
Tighten up your cinches.
We go charging in about sunup.

1126
01:49:16,881 --> 01:49:20,391
- Now, make sure that...
- Just a minute, reverend!

1127
01:49:25,932 --> 01:49:28,602
We go charging in, they'll kill her,
and you know it!

1128
01:49:28,768 --> 01:49:31,598
- That's what I'm counting on.
- I know you are!

1129
01:49:31,771 --> 01:49:34,821
It ain't gonna be that way.
She's alive. She's gonna stay alive.

1130
01:49:34,983 --> 01:49:39,653
- Living with comanches ain't being alive.
- Better that than her brains bashed out!

1131
01:49:39,821 --> 01:49:44,201
Now, son, I know this is a bitter thing
to say, but there's more at stake here...

1132
01:49:44,367 --> 01:49:46,907
- ...than your sister.
- There sure is.

1133
01:49:47,078 --> 01:49:48,828
I'm gonna tell you something.

1134
01:49:48,997 --> 01:49:52,417
Didn't mean to speak of it,
but I'm gonna tell you now.

1135
01:49:52,584 --> 01:49:56,054
You remember that scalp strung
on scar's Lance?

1136
01:49:56,212 --> 01:49:57,422
- Long and wavy?
- I saw it.

1137
01:49:57,589 --> 01:49:59,839
Don't try to tell me
it was Martha's or Lucy's!

1138
01:50:00,008 --> 01:50:02,138
It was your mother's.

1139
01:50:06,097 --> 01:50:08,517
- Come on, son.
- But that don't change it.

1140
01:50:08,683 --> 01:50:10,983
That don't change nothing!

1141
01:50:13,146 --> 01:50:16,476
Give me a chance to sneak in and get
her before you come charging in.

1142
01:50:16,649 --> 01:50:19,279
- What if you get caught?
- That don't tell them nothing.

1143
01:50:19,444 --> 01:50:21,454
- Just one man alone.
- I say no.

1144
01:50:21,988 --> 01:50:24,238
You go right ahead, son.

1145
01:50:24,407 --> 01:50:27,787
But at the first sign of an alarm,
we're coming in.

1146
01:50:28,328 --> 01:50:32,538
And we ain't gonna have no time to pick
and choose our targets when we do.

1147
01:50:35,001 --> 01:50:36,961
It's your funeral.

1148
01:51:42,902 --> 01:51:45,532
Captain Clayton! Captain!

1149
01:51:45,863 --> 01:51:49,783
- Captain Clayton!
- What the Sam hill?

1150
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:55,960
- Captain Clayton, sir.
- Damn... go ahead!

1151
01:51:56,124 --> 01:51:59,294
Why don't you have your bugler
blow the charge while you're at it?

1152
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,500
- Sir?
- Oh, never mind.

1153
01:52:01,671 --> 01:52:06,431
- Does your pa know you're out here?
- Yes, sir. Troop's about 10 miles back.

1154
01:52:06,592 --> 01:52:09,852
- The colonel sent me out looking for you.
- You found me. Good work.

1155
01:52:10,013 --> 01:52:13,063
- Good work. Goodbye.
- If there's anything I can do, sir...

1156
01:52:13,224 --> 01:52:17,354
God forbid. You just flog on back
and tell you pa where we're at.

1157
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,820
- And where he's at.
- But he knows that, sir.

1158
01:52:20,982 --> 01:52:24,692
Can't I stay? Please?

1159
01:52:24,986 --> 01:52:27,906
Oh, all right. But you watch me, boy.

1160
01:52:28,072 --> 01:52:32,122
I'm the hard case you're up against
out here, not them childish savages.

1161
01:52:32,285 --> 01:52:36,115
And if you don't hear my first holler,
you better read my mind...

1162
01:52:36,289 --> 01:52:39,999
...because I don't aim to raise no
two hollers on any subject at hand!

1163
01:52:40,168 --> 01:52:42,498
- Yes, sir.
- Boy!

1164
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:46,510
- Watch that knife!
- Sorry, sir.

1165
01:53:05,985 --> 01:53:07,525
Halt!

1166
01:53:09,113 --> 01:53:10,743
Mount!

1167
01:53:14,786 --> 01:53:18,536
Mount. Mount! M-o-n-t-e, mount!

1168
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:46,110
Debbie.

1169
01:53:46,567 --> 01:53:48,277
Debbie.

1170
01:53:50,279 --> 01:53:54,159
Debbie. Don't say anything, Debbie!
It's your brother Marty, Debbie.

1171
01:53:54,325 --> 01:53:57,325
I'm gonna take you away.
I'm gonna get you out of here, Debbie.

1172
01:53:57,495 --> 01:54:01,205
Yes, Marty. Oh, yes, Marty.

1173
01:54:08,756 --> 01:54:11,676
Brethren, leave us go amongst them!

1174
01:54:11,884 --> 01:54:13,894
Bugler!

1175
01:54:34,282 --> 01:54:35,622
Get in there!

1176
01:54:51,215 --> 01:54:54,045
Charlie, nesby, run off that pony herd...

1177
01:54:54,218 --> 01:54:56,428
- Boy, you watch out for that knife!
- Yes, sir.

1178
01:54:56,596 --> 01:54:58,426
Let's go!

1179
01:55:30,922 --> 01:55:34,472
Oh, no, Ethan! No, Ethan!

1180
01:55:35,384 --> 01:55:37,394
No, Ethan!

1181
01:55:52,068 --> 01:55:53,898
Debbie!

1182
01:55:59,075 --> 01:56:01,575
No, Ethan! No!

1183
01:56:13,339 --> 01:56:15,719
Let's go home, Debbie.

1184
01:56:24,392 --> 01:56:27,352
- Does that hurt, reverend?
- Shut up!

1185
01:56:33,192 --> 01:56:34,942
Come on.

1186
01:56:41,575 --> 01:56:44,495
Good work, captain. Good work, son.

1187
01:56:44,662 --> 01:56:46,542
You wounded?

1188
01:56:46,914 --> 01:56:50,634
- Bullet? An arrow?
- No.
