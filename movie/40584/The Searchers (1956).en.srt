1
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Ethan?

2
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,297
That's your Uncle Ethan!

3
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,812
Welcome home, Ethan.

4
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,653
You ain't much bigger
than when I last saw you, Lucy!

5
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:10,932
I'm Deborah.

6
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:12,815
There's Lucy over there.

7
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,016
And you're Lucy?

8
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:21,453
Yeah, I'm Lucy. I'm mighty glad
to see you, Uncle Ethan.

9
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:24,206
She's got a fella. Kisses him, too!

10
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,933
Go on with Lucy and
help with supper, Ben.

11
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:29,655
Deborah, you too!

12
00:03:32,616 --> 00:03:35,972
I was just gonna ask Uncle Ethan
what he's gonna do with his saber.

13
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:38,615
Well, I kind of figured to give it to you.

14
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:41,053
Thanks. Thanks, Uncle Ethan.

15
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:47,887
- How was California?
- California? How should I know?

16
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,607
- Well, Mose Harper told us-
- Mose Harper?

17
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:53,004
Is that old goat still creekin' around?

18
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:55,606
Why doesn't somebody bury him?

19
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:58,450
No, I ain't been to California.

20
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:00,692
I don't intend to go either.

21
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:03,245
Supper will be ready
as soon as you wash up.

22
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:05,006
Let me take your coat.

23
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:17,286
Welcome home, Ethan.

24
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:20,407
Thanks, Aaron.

25
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,250
Marty, it's Uncle Ethan!

26
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:37,126
Debbie, sit down.

27
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,164
Good evening, Uncle Ethan.

28
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,765
Welcome home, sir.

29
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:47,242
It's Martin. Martin Pawley.

30
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:51,566
I'm sorry for bein' late, Aunt Martha.

31
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:04,609
A fella could mistake you for a half-breed.

32
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,720
Not quite, I'm an eighth Cherokee
and the rest Welsh and English.

33
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:11,082
Least that's what they tell me.

34
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,205
Go on, son.

35
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,089
It was Ethan who found you
squallin' under a sage clump...

36
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:17,047
...after your folks had been massacred.

37
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,486
It just happened to be me.
No need to make more of it.

38
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:28,008
Thank you, Lucy.

39
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,119
Good night, Aunt Martha.

40
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,047
Good night, Martin.

41
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:57,198
- Uncle Aaron.
- Good night, Martin.

42
00:05:58,127 --> 00:05:59,765
Good night, Uncle Ethan.

43
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,157
Good night.

44
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:04,359
Good night, Ma. 'Night, Pa.

45
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,677
Uncle Ethan, will you tell us
about the war?

46
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,723
The war ended three years ago, boy.

47
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:11,479
It did? So why didn't you come home
before now?

48
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:13,922
Ben, go on with Martin. March!

49
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:23,798
Lucy's wearing the gold locket
you gave her when she was a little girl.

50
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:27,756
She doesn't wear it much
on account of it makes her neck green.

51
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:29,834
Well, it does!

52
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:33,157
But, I wouldn't care
if you gave me a gold locket...

53
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:35,440
...if it made my neck green or not.

54
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:38,923
A gold locket!
Lucy, where are my saddlebags?

55
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:59,674
Look at my gold locket!

56
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:02,202
Oh, it is pretty.

57
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:06,554
- Ethan, I think she's too young-
- Oh, let her have it.

58
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:09,201
It doesn't amount to much.

59
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:11,273
- To bed, young lady!
- Yes, Daddy.

60
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:21,873
I passed the Todd place comin' in.
What happened?

61
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:25,480
He gave up, quit,
went back to chopping cotton.

62
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:27,354
So did the Jamisons.

63
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,041
Without Martha...

64
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:34,232
She just wouldn't let a man quit.

65
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,360
Ethan, I saw it in you before the war.

66
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,599
You wanted to clear out.

67
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:42,196
You stayed beyond any real reason. Why?

68
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:44,916
Are you asking me to clear out now?

69
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,874
You're my brother, Ethan.

70
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,521
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you have a mind to.

71
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:50,750
Ain't that right, Martha?

72
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:53,673
- Of course, it is.
- I expect to pay my way.

73
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,471
There are 60 double eagles in there.

74
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,753
And twice that much here. Yankee dollars.

75
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,551
That's fresh minted.

76
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,553
There ain't a mark on it.

77
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,675
So?

78
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:01,234
Open up! It's Sam Clayton.

79
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:12,992
Reverend, come on in!

80
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:15,393
Good morning, Sister Edwards.

81
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,350
What is it, Reverend?

82
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:22,074
Lars just said somebody
busted into his corral last night...

83
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:23,874
...and ran off with his best cows.

84
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:26,423
Yeah, next time I'll raise pigs, by golly!

85
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:29,348
You never hear of anyone runnin' off pigs,
I bet you!

86
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,471
- Bumblebees, by golly!
- Coffee'll be just fine, Sister.

87
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:34,073
Good morning, Lucy.

88
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:35,746
Debbie, you been baptized yet?

89
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:38,826
- No, sir, I haven't. No.
- Aaron, get Martin, will you?

90
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:44,113
I can sure use that coffee.
Pass the sugar, son.

91
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:49,061
Wait a minute, Sister.
I didn't get any coffee yet.

92
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:52,907
Just hold on a second, Sister.
I'm sure fond of them doughnuts.

93
00:09:54,313 --> 00:09:56,383
Aaron! Martin! Come on up here.

94
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:58,182
Come on.

95
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,581
- Raise your right hand. Martin?
- Yes, sir.

96
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:02,152
Raise your right hand.

97
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:05,986
You're hereby voluntary privates
in Company A of the Texas Rangers...

98
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:09,509
- ... and you will faithfully discharge-
- Can I go with you?

99
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:12,550
- Quiet! Where was I?
- Faithfully fulfill.

100
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:14,945
You will faithfully discharge your-

101
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,588
Mrs. Edwards?

102
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:16,900
Shut up!

103
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:21,108
You will faithfully discharge your duties,
as such...

104
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,070
...without a recompense
or monetary consideration.

105
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:27,030
Amen. That means no pay.
Better get a shirt on, Aaron.

106
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:29,989
I ain't goin' volunteering till
I've had my coffee. Drink your own.

107
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:31,504
Just call me "Captain."

108
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,548
Captain.
The Reverend Samuel Johnson Clayton!

109
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,430
Mighty impressive.

110
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,827
Well... the "Prodigal Brother"!

111
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,464
When did you get back?
I ain't seen you since the surrender.

112
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,349
Come to think of it,
I didn't see you at the surrender.

113
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,341
I don't believe in surrenders.

114
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,065
I still got my saber, Reverend.

115
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,538
Didn't turn it into no plowshare neither.

116
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,859
The Indians did it, Mrs. Edwards.

117
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,827
Caddos or Kiowas.
Old Mose knows. Yes, sir.

118
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,539
- Oh, shut up, Mose.
- Thank you.

119
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:06,503
Ethan, I'm countin' on you
to look after things while I'm gone.

120
00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:10,024
- You're not goin'.
- He is going. I already swore him in.

121
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:13,106
- Swear him out! I'll go with you.
- Ethan, I don't think I should-

122
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:14,541
Stay close, Aaron.

123
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,100
It might be, this is rustlers.

124
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:20,145
Might be this dodderin' ol' idiot
ain't so far wrong.

125
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:21,580
Could be Comanches.

126
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:24,261
Kind words, Ethan. Thank you kindly.

127
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:26,858
Children, go with Lucy.

128
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,578
All right. I'll swear you in.

129
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,977
No need to. It wouldn't be legal anyway.

130
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,819
Why not? You wanted for a crime, Ethan?

131
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,941
Coffee, Ethan.

132
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:42,626
Thank you, Martha.

133
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:46,343
Are you asking me as a captain
or a preacher, Sam?

134
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:50,459
I'm asking you as a ranger
of the sovereign state of Texas.

135
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:51,773
You got a warrant?

136
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:53,776
You fit a lot of descriptions.

137
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:57,422
I figure a man's only good
for one oath at a time.

138
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:01,017
I took mine
to the Confederate States of America.

139
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,145
So did you, Sam.

140
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:05,658
Stay close, Aaron.

141
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,540
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.
We have to be going.

142
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,262
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.

143
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:14,781
Grateful to the hospitality
of your rocking chair, ma'am.

144
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:27,093
"Brad and Lucy, Lucy and Brad"

145
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:31,296
Debbie and Ben Edwards,
I'm gonna tell Ma on you!

146
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:19,052
Somethin' mighty fishy
about this trail, Uncle Ethan.

147
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:22,014
Don't call me "Uncle." I ain't your uncle.

148
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:23,612
Yes, sir.

149
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:26,285
No need to call me "sir" either.

150
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:30,644
Nor "grandpa," nor "Methuselah."
I can whip you to a frazzle.

151
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:33,648
What do you want me to call you?

152
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:37,648
My name is Ethan. Now what's
so mighty fishy about this trail?

153
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:40,485
- Well, first-
- Look! Look!

154
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:00,168
Reverend!

155
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:03,163
Look!

156
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,283
Caddos or Kiowas, huh?

157
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:24,647
Ain't but one tribe uses a lance like that.

158
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:28,248
Hey, Pa, your prize bull.
Killed every one of them!

159
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:33,203
And not for food either.
Why'd they do a thing like that?

160
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:35,886
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out.

161
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:37,850
This is a murder raid.

162
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:41,681
Shapes up to burn down either your place,
or my brother's.

163
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,050
Mama! Laurie!

164
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:47,286
Oh, please, God! Please, no!

165
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,283
Jorgensen's place is the closest, Ethan.

166
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,282
If they're not there,
we'll come straight on to you.

167
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,885
You do that.

168
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:03,801
Well, are you coming, or ain't you?

169
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,202
That farm's 40 miles from here, boy.
And these horses need rest and grain.

170
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:21,648
Ain't Caddos. Ain't Kiowas.

171
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:34,401
- Break out the grain.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

172
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:03,122
Quiet, boy.

173
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:34,599
I'll see if I can shoot a couple of sage hens
before supper.

174
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,876
Yes, you do that, Aaron.

175
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:44,883
Ma, the days are getting shorter.

176
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,955
Lucy, we don't need a lamp yet.

177
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:50,160
Let's just enjoy the dusk.

178
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:03,081
It's all right, Ma,
I've been watching. Only-

179
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,921
- What, Ben?
- I wish Uncle Ethan was here.

180
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,277
Don't you, Ma?

181
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:22,755
Close that shutter, Ben, like a good boy.

182
00:18:58,479 --> 00:19:00,834
We're gonna play the "sleep-out" game.
Remember?

183
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:02,069
Where you hide out with Grandma?

184
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,751
Where she is buried?

185
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,672
And you creep along the ditch
very quietly, like-

186
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,433
Like a little mouse.

187
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,350
Hurry up! The moon's fixin' to rise!

188
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:13,909
You won't make a sound or come back,
no matter what you hear!

189
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:16,151
- Promise?
- I promise.

190
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:21,313
- Wait. Can't I have my doll?
- There's no time. There's no time.

191
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:29,751
Now, down low. Run!

192
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:45,915
Chris, go back. Go back, Chris! Go back!

193
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:27,989
Wait a minute, Uncle Ethan.

194
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,746
Next time you'll mind your Uncle Ethan.

195
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:34,503
- Thank you kindly...
- Wait, Mose! We can ride double, Mose!

196
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:55,547
Aunt Martha!

197
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:01,747
Let me in.

198
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,337
- Don't go in there, boy.
- I know she's in there!

199
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:05,576
Don't go in!

200
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:10,424
Don't let him look in there.

201
00:22:11,468 --> 00:22:13,458
It won't do him any good.

202
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:57,342
Put an "Amen" to it!

203
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,974
There's no more time for praying. Amen!

204
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:29,415
Those girls mean as much to me
as though they were my own.

205
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:32,812
Maybe you don't know that my Brad
has been keeping company with Lucy.

206
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:35,656
I'd be obliged
if you'd come to the point, ma'am.

207
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,859
It's just that I know
Martha would want you...

208
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:40,172
...to take care of her boys,
as well as her girls.

209
00:23:40,262 --> 00:23:44,653
If the girls are dead, don't let
the boys waste their lives in vengeance.

210
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,774
Promise me, Ethan!

211
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:50,411
Come on, if you're going with us!

212
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,372
Captain Clayton!

213
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,373
Another one, huh?
Give me a hand, Charlie.

214
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:56,412
This one came a long way
before he died, Captain.

215
00:24:56,497 --> 00:25:00,126
Well, Ethan, there's another one
you can score up for your brother.

216
00:25:02,297 --> 00:25:04,446
- I don't like it!
- What don't you like?

217
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:07,050
Indians on a raid generally hide their dead.

218
00:25:07,177 --> 00:25:09,532
If they don't care anything
about us knowin'...

219
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:11,493
...it only spells one thing:

220
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:15,450
They ain't afraid of us following,
or of us catchin' up with them either.

221
00:25:15,536 --> 00:25:18,334
You can back out
any time you want, Nesby.

222
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:22,848
Ethan, I didn't say that! I didn't say such!

223
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:25,174
Easy, Nesby, easy.

224
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:33,771
Why don't you finish the job?

225
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,087
What good did that do you?

226
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,689
By what you preach, none.
But what that Comanche believes...

227
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:50,483
...ain't got no eyes,
he can't enter the Spirit Land.

228
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:52,963
Has to wander forever between the winds.

229
00:25:53,174 --> 00:25:56,007
You get it, Reverend.
Come on, Blankethead!

230
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:04,803
All right, boys. Let's mount up.

231
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:18,764
They're camped by the river,
about 20 miles from here.

232
00:26:20,972 --> 00:26:25,408
We'll wait till dark, then circle out
so we can jump 'em before daylight.

233
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:29,241
You're sure you want to jump 'em, Ethan?

234
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:33,569
That's what we came for, ain't it?

235
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:37,006
I thought we were tryin'
to get them girls out... alive.

236
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:41,207
If we jump them Comanches,
they'll kill 'em. You know that.

237
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:43,600
What are we doing then, Reverend?

238
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,482
What are we supposed to do, Ethan?

239
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:49,359
Well, what I had in mind was
maybe runnin' off their pony herd.

240
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,049
A Comanche on foot
is more apt to be willin' to listen.

241
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,122
Yeah, I think the Reverend's right.
Don't you?

242
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:57,360
You think the Reverend's...

243
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,882
What does a quarter-breed Cherokee
know about the old Comanche trick...

244
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,925
...of sleepin' with his best pony
tied right by his side?

245
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,527
You've got about as much chance
of stampeding that herd as-

246
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,158
As you have of finding them girls alive
by raidin' into 'em!

247
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:16,641
I say we do it my way.
And that's an order!

248
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,404
Yes, sir.

249
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,767
But if you're wrong...

250
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,719
...don't ever give me another!

251
00:28:03,886 --> 00:28:05,364
Well, they were here.

252
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,476
Sure. They were here.

253
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:10,958
And now they're out there,
waiting to jump us.

254
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:13,797
Any more orders, "Captain"?

255
00:28:14,365 --> 00:28:16,321
Yes. We'll keep on going.

256
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,194
Well?

257
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:30,562
You want to quit, Ethan?

258
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:32,836
That'll be the day!

259
00:28:34,164 --> 00:28:35,756
- Horses!
- Horses!

260
00:28:47,723 --> 00:28:49,076
Keep on going.

261
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,917
Keep moving! Keep moving!

262
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:10,907
Well, Reverend, it looks like
you got yourself surrounded.

263
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:14,311
Yeah, and I figure
I can get myself un-surrounded.

264
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:16,669
Mose, how far is the river?

265
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:21,109
I've been baptized, Reverend.
I've been baptized.

266
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:25,229
- Shut up, you fool.
- Thank you, kindly. Thank you.

267
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,352
You'd better get yourself set
for another one...

268
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:32,191
...because when I holler,
I want you to move out in a hurry!

269
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:38,831
Let's go!

270
00:31:23,914 --> 00:31:26,711
- Take it easy, Nesby.
- You'll be all right, Nesby.

271
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:59,187
Here is my Bible. Hold it.
It'll make you feel good.

272
00:32:01,512 --> 00:32:03,978
Thank you, Reverend.
Thank you very kindly.

273
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:10,186
Do you think they'll charge us?

274
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,461
- Are you asking me?
- I am.

275
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,469
Well, thank you.

276
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:17,707
Yep. The Death Song.

277
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,059
The War Chief. He's got to, to save face.

278
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,501
Yes, sir. He'll be right in your lap
in a minute, sonny.

279
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,424
For that which we're about to receive,
we thank Thee, O Lord.

280
00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:11,305
You got him, Marty!

281
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:28,099
Hallelujah!

282
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:31,545
Dang! Blast it!

283
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:33,823
Watch it, it's loaded!

284
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:07,172
Leave them to carry off their hurt
and dead.

285
00:34:07,263 --> 00:34:09,459
Well, Reverend, that does it!

286
00:34:09,823 --> 00:34:13,703
From now on, you stay out of this,
all of you! I don't want you with me.

287
00:34:14,463 --> 00:34:16,852
I don't need you for what I've gotta do!

288
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:29,935
Well, Edwards, I guess you're right.

289
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:32,414
We gotta get Nesby back.

290
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:34,859
This is a job for a whole company
of rangers...

291
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:37,092
...or it's a job for one or two men.

292
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:40,171
Right now, we're too many
and not enough.

293
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:42,932
Me, I'm going on alone.

294
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:45,976
Any objections?

295
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:47,256
Good luck.

296
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,450
There's only one way you can stop me
from looking for Lucy, mister...

297
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,099
...and that's kill me!

298
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:57,856
That's the way I feel, Uncle Ethan.

299
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,257
All right. But I'm giving the orders,
you hear?

300
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:06,211
I'm givin' the orders...

301
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,178
...and you'll follow 'em
or we're splittin' up right here and now.

302
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:10,658
Sure, Ethan.

303
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,492
There's just one reason we're here, ain't it?
It's to find Debbie and Lucy.

304
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:21,617
If they're still alive.

305
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,773
Mount up.

306
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:55,049
They gotta stop sometime.

307
00:35:56,017 --> 00:35:58,577
If they're human men at all,
they gotta stop!

308
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:02,407
No, a human rides a horse until it dies,
then he goes on afoot.

309
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:08,414
A Comanche comes along, gets that
horse up, rides him 20 more miles...

310
00:36:09,496 --> 00:36:11,248
...and then he eats him.

311
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,369
Easy on that!

312
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,245
Sorry.

313
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:18,695
We don't even know if Debbie
and Lucy are in this bunch.

314
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:19,844
Maybe they split up.

315
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:22,210
They're with 'em, all right.
If they're still alive.

316
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:24,126
You've said that enough!

317
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,088
Maybe Lucy's dead.
Maybe they're both dead.

318
00:36:27,655 --> 00:36:30,852
But, if I hear that from you again,
I'll fight you, Mr. Edwards!

319
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:32,652
That'll be the day!

320
00:36:38,734 --> 00:36:39,849
Spread out!

321
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:50,925
Found a main trail, but...

322
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:55,044
...four of them cut out here
and rode on up through that pass.

323
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:57,929
How come they'd do that, Ethan?

324
00:36:58,573 --> 00:37:01,326
I'll take a look. Keep after the others.

325
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,165
If you want us to fire-

326
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:05,925
No, nor build bonfires, nor beat drums.

327
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:08,529
I'll meet you on the far side.

328
00:37:09,692 --> 00:37:10,568
Move!

329
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,002
Do you want some water, Ethan?

330
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:02,362
The trail leads over there.

331
00:38:02,729 --> 00:38:04,241
Why'd they break off?

332
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:08,560
Was there water in that canyon?

333
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:09,679
Huh?

334
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:12,844
No water.

335
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:15,960
Are you all right, Ethan?

336
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:17,442
I'm all right.

337
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,046
What happened to your coat?
Did you lose it?

338
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:28,567
I must have.

339
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,318
But I'm not going back for it!

340
00:38:49,966 --> 00:38:52,036
I found 'em! I found Lucy!

341
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:58,404
They're camped a half-mile over. I was
swinging back and I saw their smoke.

342
00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:02,076
Bellied up a ridge,
and there they were, right below me.

343
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:04,078
Did you see Debbie?

344
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:08,921
No, but I saw Lucy all right.
She was wearing that blue dress-

345
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:11,156
What you saw wasn't Lucy.

346
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:12,438
Oh, but it was-

347
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:14,277
What you saw was a buck...

348
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:16,161
...wearin' Lucy's dress.

349
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:19,673
I found Lucy back in the canyon.

350
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:23,435
I wrapped her in my coat.

351
00:39:25,484 --> 00:39:27,475
Buried her with my own hands.

352
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:31,082
I thought it best to keep it from you.

353
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:35,163
Did they...

354
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:36,911
Was she...?

355
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:40,518
What do you want me to do?
Draw you a picture? Spell it out?

356
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:45,152
Don't ever ask me! As long as you live,
don't ever ask me more!

357
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,032
I'm awful sorry, Brad.

358
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:14,435
Wait a minute!

359
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,634
Get back here, Brad! Get back here!

360
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:11,234
Why don't you say it?

361
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:14,228
We're beaten, and you know it.

362
00:41:17,037 --> 00:41:19,550
Our turnin' back don't mean nothin'.

363
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:21,950
Not in the long run.

364
00:41:22,956 --> 00:41:26,426
If she's alive, she's safe.
For a while, they'll keep her...

365
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:30,234
...and they'll raise her
as one of their own until...

366
00:41:31,436 --> 00:41:33,427
...she's of an age to...

367
00:41:35,477 --> 00:41:38,786
Do you think maybe there's a chance
we still might find her?

368
00:41:39,115 --> 00:41:42,710
An Indian will chase a thing
till he thinks he's chased it enough.

369
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:45,394
Then he quits.

370
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:47,473
Same way when he runs.

371
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:51,271
Seems like he never learns
there's such a thing as...

372
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:54,264
...a critter who'll just keep coming on.

373
00:41:55,275 --> 00:41:57,868
So we'll find 'em in the end. I promise you.

374
00:41:58,554 --> 00:41:59,954
We'll find 'em...

375
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:03,471
...just as sure as the turnin' of the earth!

376
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:54,549
- Hi, Ethan.
- Hello, sir.

377
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,268
- Hi, Marty.
- How are you, sir?

378
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,188
You got my letter about your son, Brad?

379
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,265
Just about this time a year ago.

380
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:21,060
Oh, Ethan, this country...

381
00:43:38,988 --> 00:43:43,106
Him? Probably forgotten all about you,
can't even call your name to mind!

382
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:45,341
Her name is Laurie.

383
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:50,422
But I fairly forgot just how pretty she was.

384
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:07,019
What about Debbie?

385
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:20,462
Hey, what are you doin' anyway?

386
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,378
Don't go taking that stuff!

387
00:44:25,225 --> 00:44:27,181
Well, it ain't worth the mending.

388
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:30,143
What are you gettin' so red in the face
about? I got brothers, ain't I?

389
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:32,216
Yeah, well, I ain't one of them.

390
00:44:32,585 --> 00:44:34,815
Look here, Martin Pawley, I'm a woman.

391
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:37,942
We women wash and mend
your dirty clothes all your lives.

392
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:39,856
When you're little, we even wash you!

393
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:43,016
How you can ever make out to be bashful
in front of a woman, I'll never know.

394
00:44:43,104 --> 00:44:45,823
You talk like a fella just
might as well run around naked.

395
00:44:45,904 --> 00:44:47,623
It wouldn't bother me none.

396
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:53,375
Sure wouldn't try it in front of Pa, though,
if I was you!

397
00:44:59,023 --> 00:45:01,458
"Oh, I got a gal prettier than you"

398
00:45:08,303 --> 00:45:12,375
We kept trackin' 'em till the blizzards hit.
Then we lost their trail.

399
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:17,815
Don't need to tell you where we went:
Fort Richardson, Wingate, Cobb...

400
00:45:20,863 --> 00:45:23,819
Trouble is, we don't know which band
the war party belonged to.

401
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:26,051
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

402
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:27,655
I got your boy killed.

403
00:45:28,022 --> 00:45:29,579
Don't go blamin' yourself for that.

404
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:33,495
It's this country that killed my boy.
Yes, by golly, I tell you Ethan-

405
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:36,858
Now, Lars, it just so happens
we'd be Texicans.

406
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,333
A Texican is nothing but a human man
way out on a limb.

407
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:42,978
This year and next...

408
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,255
Maybe for a hundred more.
But I don't think it will be forever.

409
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:51,416
Some day this country's gonna be
a fine good place to be.

410
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,615
Maybe it needs our bones in the ground
before that time can come.

411
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:57,089
Bedtime.

412
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,890
She was a schoolteacher.

413
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,690
Ma, Marty's drawers is a sight.

414
00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:04,610
Would it be all right
if we give him some of Brad's things?

415
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:06,372
Of course. They're in Grandma's chest.

416
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,814
Ethan, you're going to sleep
in the bunkhouse.

417
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:12,448
The letter! In the chest!
It came for you, Ethan, last winter.

418
00:46:12,658 --> 00:46:14,490
Charlie McCorry brought it.

419
00:46:17,298 --> 00:46:21,372
I'm looking for that letter
Charlie McCorry... By Jiminy!

420
00:46:28,298 --> 00:46:30,606
Here it is. By golly, I forgot.

421
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:37,136
Excuse me.

422
00:46:51,216 --> 00:46:52,854
Take a look at this.

423
00:46:53,296 --> 00:46:54,285
Just a snip of calico.

424
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:57,527
Ever see it before?
Maybe on a dress Debbie wore?

425
00:47:00,897 --> 00:47:02,692
Yes, it was an apron.

426
00:47:03,735 --> 00:47:05,407
Have they found her yet?

427
00:47:06,976 --> 00:47:08,045
Not yet.

428
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,010
Not yet.

429
00:47:16,574 --> 00:47:18,486
You might at least have
left me my britches!

430
00:47:18,575 --> 00:47:20,929
It's time for bed anyway.
Here, try these on.

431
00:47:21,015 --> 00:47:22,164
I ain't gonna.

432
00:47:23,414 --> 00:47:25,770
Well, likely they'll need some takin' in.

433
00:47:25,855 --> 00:47:27,493
You're that gaunt.

434
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:30,170
Ma's having turkey for dinner tomorrow.

435
00:47:30,254 --> 00:47:32,688
Laurie, come. Let the boys get to bed.

436
00:47:33,574 --> 00:47:34,769
All right, Pa.

437
00:47:40,174 --> 00:47:42,448
- Good night, Marty.
- Good night, Laurie.

438
00:47:42,973 --> 00:47:45,533
- 'Night, Mr. Edwards.
- 'Night, Ms. Jorgensen.

439
00:47:52,052 --> 00:47:54,772
Jorgensen's been runnin'
my cattle with his own.

440
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:57,286
Your cattle?

441
00:47:58,093 --> 00:47:59,731
You mean Debbie's cattle.

442
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:04,483
He's agreed to take you on and split
the increase in my herd while I'm gone.

443
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:06,890
I'm pushin' on tomorrow.

444
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:09,481
Well, I sure ain't gonna stay here!

445
00:48:09,571 --> 00:48:11,847
I started out lookin' for Debbie,
I intend to keep on.

446
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:12,647
Why?

447
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:15,007
Why? Well, because she is my-

448
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:18,649
She's your nothing!
She's no kin to you at all!

449
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:22,207
I always kind of thought she was.

450
00:48:22,891 --> 00:48:24,960
The way her folks took me in
and raised me...

451
00:48:25,051 --> 00:48:26,689
That don't make you no kin.

452
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:29,842
All right, maybe it don't.
But I intend to keep on lookin' anyway.

453
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:30,999
How?

454
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:33,440
You got any horses, or money to buy 'em?

455
00:48:33,531 --> 00:48:35,918
You ain't even got money for cartridges.

456
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,604
Jorgensen's offerin' you a good livin' here.

457
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,800
Martin, I want you to know-

458
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:46,921
I know what you want me to know!

459
00:48:47,129 --> 00:48:49,518
I've got no kin, no money, no horses!

460
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:53,047
All I got here is a bunch
of dead-man's clothes to wear!

461
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:56,289
You told me that already,
so, shut your mouth!

462
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:10,081
Mornin', Laurie.

463
00:49:10,168 --> 00:49:12,318
Mornin', Marty. Did you sleep well?

464
00:49:12,768 --> 00:49:14,042
Well, no.

465
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:17,399
I kind of tossed and...

466
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:19,679
...turned and dreamed.

467
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:35,360
I'll get your coffee.

468
00:49:37,646 --> 00:49:39,477
You know, Laurie, I...

469
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:43,480
...I was thinking maybe it's time
you and me started goin' steady, huh?

470
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:49,001
You and me have been goin' steady
since we was three years old.

471
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:52,203
- We have?
- About time you found out about it!

472
00:49:54,446 --> 00:49:57,118
Gosh, Laurie, I've always been fond
of you, but...

473
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:59,958
...with all this trouble
with Debbie and Ethan, I...

474
00:50:00,045 --> 00:50:01,717
Ethan rode on an hour ago.

475
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:06,275
I don't know what you can do
about findin' Debbie that he can't.

476
00:50:06,364 --> 00:50:08,958
He'll find her now, Martin. Honest he will!

477
00:50:09,163 --> 00:50:12,441
That's what I'm afraid of, Laurie,
him finding her!

478
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:16,442
I've seen his eyes
at the very word "Comanche."

479
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:19,713
I've seen him take his knife and-

480
00:50:21,404 --> 00:50:23,041
Never mind. He's a man
that can go crazy wild!

481
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:26,081
And I intend to be there to stop him,
in case he does.

482
00:50:26,684 --> 00:50:30,073
I was hopin' I could hold you here,
but I guess I knew better.

483
00:50:33,203 --> 00:50:34,716
I stole that for you.

484
00:50:43,882 --> 00:50:45,474
"I... bought..."

485
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:48,193
Here, let me read it for you.

486
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,311
"I bought a small-sized dress
off of an Indian.

487
00:50:52,402 --> 00:50:55,837
"If this here's a piece of your child's dress,
bring the reward.

488
00:50:55,921 --> 00:50:58,482
"I know where they've gone.
Jerem Futterman."

489
00:51:00,881 --> 00:51:04,237
He's got a small trading post
on the south fork of the Brazos.

490
00:51:04,321 --> 00:51:06,835
Listen, I just gotta get me a horse!
Do you think your Pa-

491
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:07,592
Finish your breakfast!

492
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:09,193
I've got to find him!

493
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,995
- All right, go on and find him!
- Oh, Laurie, don't you understand?

494
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,796
But that's your own good horse!

495
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,718
You take him and welcome!

496
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:32,071
But don't you count on findin' me here
when you get back.

497
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:34,719
I've been hanging around
this Godforsaken place...

498
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:37,074
...for two long years waiting for you.

499
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:39,389
I ain't cut out to be no old maid!

500
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:43,429
I'm sorry, Laurie,
but I just gotta catch up with Ethan.

501
00:51:44,078 --> 00:51:46,308
Well, go ahead and catch up with him!

502
00:52:03,077 --> 00:52:04,557
- Futterman?
- Yeah.

503
00:52:05,037 --> 00:52:06,153
Let's talk.

504
00:52:11,597 --> 00:52:13,394
You sent me a letter.

505
00:52:13,877 --> 00:52:14,866
Yeah?

506
00:52:15,277 --> 00:52:16,470
About a dress.

507
00:52:29,715 --> 00:52:31,035
How'd you come by it?

508
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:34,188
- You said there was a $1,000 reward.
- That's what I said.

509
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,867
Got it with you?

510
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:39,193
You'll get the reward when I find her,
and if she's still alive.

511
00:52:39,275 --> 00:52:41,345
A man's got a right to expect
some kind of payment.

512
00:52:41,435 --> 00:52:44,472
I laid out for that dress
and sendin' you that writing.

513
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,070
Twenty Yankee dollars.

514
00:52:48,155 --> 00:52:50,145
A man's time is worth something.

515
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:51,784
Talk.

516
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:56,985
A young buck fetched it in
late last summer.

517
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:59,588
Said it belonged to a captive child
of Chief Scar.

518
00:52:59,674 --> 00:53:00,663
Scar?

519
00:53:01,314 --> 00:53:02,905
We ain't never heard of him, have we?

520
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:05,871
Me neither. But this buck claimed
he was a big war chief...

521
00:53:05,954 --> 00:53:08,149
- ... with the Nawyecky Comanches.
- Keep talkin'.

522
00:53:08,234 --> 00:53:11,942
Scar's band was headed north to winter
at Fort Wingate, eatin' agency beef.

523
00:53:12,033 --> 00:53:14,468
That's what this buck said. Maybe he lied.

524
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,587
Maybe you lie.

525
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:19,501
In that case, my friend,
you won't find her...

526
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:21,823
...and I won't get my $1,000 dollars.

527
00:53:23,232 --> 00:53:25,700
You can spend the night. Cards, a jug-

528
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,181
No thanks.

529
00:53:29,111 --> 00:53:31,023
Don't forget to come back with my $1,000!

530
00:53:31,112 --> 00:53:32,545
It ain't yours yet!

531
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:41,222
Do you have a feeling
that maybe we're being followed?

532
00:53:41,472 --> 00:53:43,780
That's the Indian in you. Go to sleep.

533
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:46,666
Them horses there...
they're sure actin' mighty nervous.

534
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:48,867
They smell a change in the weather.

535
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:00,068
Don't put any more wood on the fire.
I'm burning up.

536
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,379
We might get a frost before mornin'.

537
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:05,019
I'm getting to be like old Mose Harper.

538
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,468
My bones are cold tonight.

539
00:54:13,029 --> 00:54:16,942
It's funny, but last winter when
we passed through Fort Wingate...

540
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:21,783
...I didn't have any recollection of
a mention of Nawyecky Comanches.

541
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:25,301
Not so funny when you recollect
what "Nawyecky" means.

542
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:28,302
- What's that?
- Sort of like "roundabout."

543
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:31,785
A man says he's goin' one place,
means to go to the other.

544
00:54:43,828 --> 00:54:47,582
Come on, Ethan. Don't put any more wood
on the fire! I'm burning up.

545
00:54:55,987 --> 00:54:57,056
Comfortable?

546
00:54:57,147 --> 00:54:58,545
Are you all right?

547
00:54:58,986 --> 00:55:02,422
- I'm just saying good night to you.
- Well, good night!

548
00:55:25,024 --> 00:55:26,378
Good night!

549
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:28,259
Good night!

550
00:56:13,102 --> 00:56:14,855
Thanks, you did fine.

551
00:56:18,301 --> 00:56:20,133
Why, that's Futterman!

552
00:56:20,862 --> 00:56:22,738
Ethan, what are you doin' anyway?

553
00:56:22,821 --> 00:56:26,019
I'm getting my money back, you idiot!
What do you suppose!

554
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:28,374
We did all right.

555
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:36,055
We? Why you just staked me out there,
like a piece of bait!

556
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:40,415
You built up the fire. You fixed it
so I could get my brains blown out!

557
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,817
What if you had missed?

558
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,378
It never occurred to me.

559
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:50,332
Let's get out of here.

560
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:00,977
Howdy, Mr. Jorgensen.

561
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:04,134
- Charlie!
- Got me a letter here.

562
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,057
By golly, a letter?

563
00:57:08,218 --> 00:57:09,776
It's for Ms. Laurie.

564
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:12,607
Two letters in one year! By golly!

565
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:16,051
Mama! Mama! It's Charlie McCorry.

566
00:57:16,738 --> 00:57:20,174
He's come with a letter.
He's come a courtin' too, by golly!

567
00:57:24,097 --> 00:57:25,655
Good morning, Charlie.

568
00:57:26,057 --> 00:57:29,049
Laurie, here's a letter for you.
Charlie brought it.

569
00:57:29,617 --> 00:57:33,212
I figured it might be the news
you've been waiting for, so I-

570
00:57:33,297 --> 00:57:34,811
- Thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

571
00:57:34,897 --> 00:57:37,205
Say, I brought you some boiled sweets.

572
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,764
Why, thank you, Charlie!

573
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:41,576
Let's sit down
while Laurie reads the letter.

574
00:57:41,976 --> 00:57:44,252
I reckon, I really ought to be going-

575
00:57:44,736 --> 00:57:46,455
No. You'll stay, Charlie.

576
00:57:46,616 --> 00:57:50,894
After all, Charlie brought the letter.
He's got a right to listen too.

577
00:57:52,376 --> 00:57:54,128
Come on, read the letter.

578
00:57:55,735 --> 00:57:57,168
But, Ma, it's my letter!

579
00:57:57,255 --> 00:57:59,770
Why, sure, but...
Go ahead. Read it.

580
00:58:09,054 --> 00:58:10,043
Please.

581
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,493
"Dear Ms. Laury-"

582
00:58:13,695 --> 00:58:16,413
He spelled it with a "y" instead of an "ie."
You'd think he'd know better.

583
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:20,407
Oh, spelling... please!
What's the difference? Read the letter!

584
00:58:22,613 --> 00:58:26,243
"Dear Ms. Laury: I take pencil in hand
to let you know...

585
00:58:27,454 --> 00:58:31,333
"... Ethan and me are still trying
to catch up with them Comanches...

586
00:58:31,454 --> 00:58:33,968
"... the late Mr. Futterman told us about."

587
00:58:35,253 --> 00:58:36,606
The "late" Mr. Futterman?

588
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:39,161
That means Mr. Futterman is dead,
by golly.

589
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:41,683
Oh, the poor man! Go ahead, Laurie.

590
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:46,406
"We cut north through Indian territory...

591
00:58:47,132 --> 00:58:49,202
"... and did not have no trouble...

592
00:58:50,012 --> 00:58:52,401
"... finding Kiowas and Wichitas...

593
00:58:53,013 --> 00:58:54,968
"... and even some Comanches...

594
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:57,686
"... camped by one of the agencies.

595
00:58:58,652 --> 00:59:00,882
"But none of them was Nawyeckies...

596
00:59:01,172 --> 00:59:04,288
"... nor claimed to know
a war chief called Scar."

597
00:59:05,852 --> 00:59:06,841
Scar?

598
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:13,047
"He's the one the late Mr. Futterman said
had Debbie.

599
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,286
"At one of the agencies...

600
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,961
"... we outfitted with all kinds of
trade goods...

601
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,564
"... figuring that'd make it easier
for us to come and go...

602
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:32,564
"You'd laugh if I told you...

603
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,438
"... what was our biggest seller."

604
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:26,247
Let's go. I think I stumbled
onto something.

605
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:27,322
Scar... you found him?

606
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:29,760
When are you gonna learn
to keep your big mouth shut?

607
01:00:29,846 --> 01:00:31,484
Get your horse, and let's get out of here!

608
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:34,478
- I just bought me a good blanket.
- Forget it. Move!

609
01:00:40,006 --> 01:00:42,519
I heard that a band of hostile Comanches...

610
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:45,841
...came through less than a week ago.

611
01:00:45,925 --> 01:00:48,314
I asked if a white girl was with them.

612
01:00:49,085 --> 01:00:51,121
They got sullen and suspicious.

613
01:00:51,805 --> 01:00:54,399
- You think it might have been-
- I don't know!

614
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,514
What's she following us for?

615
01:01:03,043 --> 01:01:04,955
Hey, you! You go on back now!

616
01:01:05,724 --> 01:01:06,759
Go on!

617
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:10,042
Look, I changed my mind.
You can keep your blanket.

618
01:01:14,444 --> 01:01:17,162
Look, you don't understand.
I don't want it!

619
01:01:17,563 --> 01:01:20,077
You don't understand, you chunkhead!

620
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:23,476
You didn't buy any blanket,
you bought her!

621
01:01:24,403 --> 01:01:26,358
You got yourself a wife, sonny!

622
01:01:27,243 --> 01:01:29,756
Oh, no! Ethan, tell her to go back!

623
01:01:30,163 --> 01:01:33,234
What? And have her whole family
after our scalps...

624
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:36,553
...for flauntin' one of their womenfolk?
No, sir!

625
01:01:37,242 --> 01:01:39,039
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

626
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:40,955
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

627
01:01:41,122 --> 01:01:42,919
Join our merry group.

628
01:01:43,121 --> 01:01:44,270
Mrs. Pawley?

629
01:01:48,961 --> 01:01:51,998
"There is one other thing I got to tell you...

630
01:01:52,721 --> 01:01:55,155
"... before you hear it from Ethan.

631
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,793
"How I got myself...

632
01:02:00,361 --> 01:02:01,634
"... a wife-"

633
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,989
He did?

634
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,315
Good!

635
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,071
A young man should get married
early in life. Right, Mama?

636
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,509
Go ahead and read the letter, Laurie.

637
01:02:18,759 --> 01:02:20,829
"A little Comanche squaw-"

638
01:02:24,279 --> 01:02:25,428
Squaw!

639
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:32,277
Laurie, you come back
and read the letter, please!

640
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,029
Come back and read it, please!

641
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:39,267
Mama, here, you read the letter.

642
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:44,155
My wife was a schoolteacher.
She reads good.

643
01:02:47,078 --> 01:02:48,271
I'll read it.

644
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:50,872
So he married a Comanche squaw.

645
01:02:59,797 --> 01:03:01,515
"She wasn't near...

646
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:04,748
"... as old as you-"

647
01:03:06,117 --> 01:03:08,187
How old does he think I am?

648
01:03:10,436 --> 01:03:12,826
Hey, look! Coffee. Me. Coffee.

649
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,263
Could I have a little, Mrs. Pawley?

650
01:03:27,076 --> 01:03:30,784
Looks like Mrs. Pawley's
gonna make you a fine, dutiful wife.

651
01:03:30,995 --> 01:03:32,906
Oh, cut it out, will you?

652
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,548
Look... I sure wish
I could make you understand.

653
01:03:50,233 --> 01:03:53,749
She says her name is
Wild Goose Flying in The Night Sky.

654
01:03:55,153 --> 01:03:58,305
But she'll answer to "Look,"
if that pleases you.

655
01:04:30,351 --> 01:04:32,865
That's grounds for divorce in Texas!

656
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:37,429
You're really rough!

657
01:04:37,551 --> 01:04:40,019
Well, I don't think it's a dead-bird funny!

658
01:04:41,071 --> 01:04:45,143
Look, if you really wanna do some good,
why don't you ask her where Scar is?

659
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:51,943
She heard you.

660
01:04:59,509 --> 01:05:00,703
You ask her!

661
01:05:02,629 --> 01:05:06,508
Do you know where he went?
Did he have a girl with him? A white girl?

662
01:05:12,749 --> 01:05:14,467
No, not a woman. It's-

663
01:05:17,068 --> 01:05:18,023
Sister!

664
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:44,981
Look's gone!

665
01:05:46,107 --> 01:05:47,699
Pulled out in the night.

666
01:05:50,786 --> 01:05:53,779
She ain't goin' back to her family.
That's for certain.

667
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:56,380
She took off the way
that arrow is pointing.

668
01:05:58,146 --> 01:05:59,465
Think maybe we ought to follow her?

669
01:05:59,546 --> 01:06:02,059
How should I know? She's your wife.

670
01:06:06,426 --> 01:06:08,655
"Maybe she left other signs
for us to follow but...

671
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:10,383
"... we'll never know...

672
01:06:10,505 --> 01:06:13,497
"... because it snowed
that day and all the next week."

673
01:06:17,904 --> 01:06:20,180
We were headin' north
through buffalo country...

674
01:06:20,265 --> 01:06:23,860
...when somethin' happened that
I ain't got straight in my own mind yet.

675
01:06:23,944 --> 01:06:26,333
On this day we sighted a small herd.

676
01:06:26,664 --> 01:06:28,938
We needed meat, so we circled around...

677
01:06:29,224 --> 01:06:31,215
...and came up on them on foot.

678
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:08,090
That don't make no sense!

679
01:07:08,181 --> 01:07:10,980
Hunger! Empty bellies! That's the sense!

680
01:07:22,021 --> 01:07:24,933
At least they won't feed
any Comanches this winter!

681
01:07:27,141 --> 01:07:28,288
Listen!

682
01:08:33,617 --> 01:08:35,732
It was the Nawyecky Comanches, all right.

683
01:08:35,816 --> 01:08:38,455
The ones we'd been looking for
all this time.

684
01:09:10,094 --> 01:09:11,413
It's Look.

685
01:09:16,173 --> 01:09:18,085
What did them soldiers have
to go and kill her for?

686
01:09:18,174 --> 01:09:19,653
She never done nobody any harm.

687
01:09:19,734 --> 01:09:22,452
We've got to catch up with them,
maybe they've got Debbie with them!

688
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:25,491
Maybe they've got that chief they call Scar.

689
01:09:26,374 --> 01:09:28,886
So, we figured Debbie'd been in the village.

690
01:09:29,093 --> 01:09:31,448
What Look was doin' there...
whether she'd come to warn 'em...

691
01:09:31,532 --> 01:09:33,683
...or maybe to find Debbie for me...

692
01:09:33,973 --> 01:09:35,850
...there's no way of knowing.

693
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:20,287
Come on, move along! Come on!

694
01:10:42,648 --> 01:10:43,604
Yes?

695
01:10:43,688 --> 01:10:46,122
We're looking for a girl.
A white girl. A captive.

696
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,085
Should be about 14 now.

697
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:50,603
Fourteen? We have two about that age.

698
01:10:51,568 --> 01:10:54,366
- All the white women are in the chapel.
- What's this girl to you?

699
01:10:54,448 --> 01:10:56,404
- She's my-
- She's my niece.

700
01:10:58,167 --> 01:10:59,282
One moment.

701
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,078
- White women?
- Yes, sir.

702
01:11:29,445 --> 01:11:30,958
Will you stand up?

703
01:11:31,806 --> 01:11:33,158
Stand up, please.

704
01:11:55,483 --> 01:11:57,599
It's hard to believe they're white.

705
01:11:58,204 --> 01:11:59,842
They ain't white!

706
01:12:00,164 --> 01:12:02,597
Not any more. They are Comanches!

707
01:12:03,723 --> 01:12:05,441
Where are your casualties?

708
01:12:24,202 --> 01:12:27,592
Maybe you can help us identify them.
All white. All captives.

709
01:12:27,882 --> 01:12:29,758
There's the white girl there.

710
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:40,558
No.

711
01:12:44,441 --> 01:12:48,274
"So we're setting out for New Mexico
territory in the morning.

712
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:54,229
"I am sorry I won't be back
for Christmas again this year.

713
01:12:59,561 --> 01:13:03,074
"I set pencil aside and hope
you are enjoying good health.

714
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,872
"And your folks the same.

715
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,596
"I remain, respectfully...

716
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:11,075
"... yours truly, Martin Pawley."

717
01:13:12,599 --> 01:13:14,793
They'll never find that girl.

718
01:13:17,759 --> 01:13:18,908
Never!

719
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:28,391
"Yours truly."

720
01:13:32,118 --> 01:13:34,552
He had to sign his whole name,
"Martin Pawley."

721
01:13:34,637 --> 01:13:36,594
He couldn't write just "Marty"!

722
01:13:38,597 --> 01:13:40,747
I don't care if he never comes back!

723
01:13:42,197 --> 01:13:45,588
Charlie, you stay for supper.
I won't take "no" for an answer.

724
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:49,591
The thought of saying "no"
never entered my head, Mrs. Jorgensen.

725
01:13:50,836 --> 01:13:53,715
Ain't no place I'd rather be
than right here...

726
01:13:54,436 --> 01:13:55,631
...right now.

727
01:13:57,917 --> 01:13:59,987
"Gone again, skip to my Lou

728
01:14:02,716 --> 01:14:04,786
"Gone again, skip to my Lou

729
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:09,745
"Gone again, skip to my Lou

730
01:14:12,356 --> 01:14:14,505
"Skip to my Lou, my darling"

731
01:14:38,034 --> 01:14:39,513
- Recognize it?
- That?

732
01:14:40,675 --> 01:14:43,233
Couldn't be two like that
in the whole world!

733
01:14:44,753 --> 01:14:45,903
Mose Harper!

734
01:14:52,393 --> 01:14:54,429
Mose, you look shabbier than ever!

735
01:14:54,513 --> 01:14:56,026
How about a drink?

736
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:01,270
Ain't been too good.
No, sir. Not too good.

737
01:15:01,832 --> 01:15:04,141
- Getting old.
- You were born old.

738
01:15:04,712 --> 01:15:07,863
Been helpin' you, Ethan.
Been lookin' all the time.

739
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:09,903
The reward still stands.

740
01:15:12,072 --> 01:15:14,949
Don't want no money, Ethan.
No money, Marty.

741
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:18,381
Just a roof over old Mose's head.

742
01:15:20,552 --> 01:15:22,860
And a rocking chair by the fire.

743
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:25,711
My own rocking chair by the fire, Marty.

744
01:15:26,871 --> 01:15:29,943
You help us find the girl
and you've got your rocking chair.

745
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:31,907
Swear it, Ethan? Given word?

746
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,749
I told you, didn't I?

747
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:37,384
Ethan, I found a man who's seen her.

748
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,346
He knows where little Debbie is!

749
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,706
Where is he? Who is this man?

750
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,782
- Promise?
- Who is this man?

751
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,667
I am this man, Seor.

752
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:55,266
At your service. For a price.
Always for a price.

753
01:16:08,788 --> 01:16:09,982
Sir, I'd like to-

754
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:11,899
Wait till you grow up.

755
01:16:37,986 --> 01:16:39,864
Let's talk a little business.

756
01:16:41,906 --> 01:16:42,861
Why not?

757
01:17:14,184 --> 01:17:15,219
Let's go.

758
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:16,812
But I'm hungry!

759
01:17:17,024 --> 01:17:18,423
While you're fillin' your belly...

760
01:17:18,504 --> 01:17:21,381
...I'm goin' out to meet a Comanche
named Cicatriz.

761
01:17:21,544 --> 01:17:22,976
Never heard of him.

762
01:17:23,423 --> 01:17:25,813
"Cicatriz" is Mexican for "scar."

763
01:18:45,498 --> 01:18:47,057
Medicine country, huh?

764
01:18:47,738 --> 01:18:49,297
Bad medicine, I think.

765
01:19:12,297 --> 01:19:15,493
- This is the great Cicatriz, War Chief.
- Scar, huh?

766
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:23,486
Plain to see how you got your name.

767
01:19:25,337 --> 01:19:26,850
You, Big Shoulders.

768
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:30,206
The young one, He Who Follows.

769
01:19:32,136 --> 01:19:35,127
You speak pretty good American
for a Comanche.

770
01:19:36,615 --> 01:19:38,174
Did someone teach you?

771
01:19:45,976 --> 01:19:49,410
That's right. We've come to trade.
Only not out here.

772
01:19:50,454 --> 01:19:52,525
I don't stand talkin' in the wind.

773
01:20:17,453 --> 01:20:20,172
You speak good Comanche.
Did someone teach you?

774
01:20:22,252 --> 01:20:24,322
- You, stay out here.
- Not likely.

775
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:34,850
His sons are dead. So his wives sit
on the honor side of his lodge.

776
01:20:41,091 --> 01:20:42,729
Are all those his wives?

777
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,566
Two sons killed by white men.

778
01:20:46,732 --> 01:20:48,881
For each son, I take many...

779
01:20:51,331 --> 01:20:52,400
Scalps.

780
01:21:25,689 --> 01:21:27,360
We've seen scalps before.

781
01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:31,001
Seen this before?

782
01:21:38,168 --> 01:21:40,557
I came to trade,
not to admire his collection.

783
01:21:40,647 --> 01:21:44,799
Tell him we'll pitch camp on the other
side of the creek and talk tomorrow.

784
01:22:00,487 --> 01:22:02,044
It is not that I am afraid.

785
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,435
Don't apologize. You got well paid.

786
01:22:06,086 --> 01:22:10,079
But he knows who you are,
and why you're here. This, I did not know.

787
01:22:12,326 --> 01:22:14,839
Take it. I do not want blood money.

788
01:22:32,965 --> 01:22:35,274
Do you think old Scar means to kill us?

789
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:37,563
He's got to.

790
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:40,633
We've been asking for it for five years.

791
01:22:42,684 --> 01:22:44,993
Why didn't he make his move back there?

792
01:22:46,405 --> 01:22:49,361
Hospitality, I guess. Comanche hospitality.

793
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:55,199
Why? Do you want to pull out too?

794
01:23:00,084 --> 01:23:01,232
Big Shoulders!

795
01:23:18,962 --> 01:23:21,953
Debbie, don't you remember?
I'm Martin, your brother.

796
01:23:22,601 --> 01:23:23,876
Remember?

797
01:23:25,281 --> 01:23:26,953
Debbie, remember back...

798
01:23:28,321 --> 01:23:31,199
Do you remember how I used
to let you ride my horse?

799
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:34,313
And tell you stories?

800
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:38,192
Don't you remember me, Debbie?

801
01:23:38,721 --> 01:23:39,836
I remember.

802
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,274
For always.

803
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,873
First I prayed to you, to come and get me...

804
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,874
...to take me home. You didn't come.

805
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:54,877
I've come now, Debbie.

806
01:23:55,799 --> 01:23:57,279
These are my people.

807
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,310
Go! Go, Martin! Please!

808
01:24:03,399 --> 01:24:04,878
Stand aside, Martin!

809
01:24:08,919 --> 01:24:10,432
No, you don't, Ethan!

810
01:24:11,319 --> 01:24:12,877
Ethan! No, you don't!

811
01:24:15,038 --> 01:24:16,187
Stand aside!

812
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:40,979
Looks as though I'm gonna have
to open that shoulder again.

813
01:26:41,789 --> 01:26:43,461
To get the poison out.

814
01:26:44,309 --> 01:26:47,779
Sure beats me, Ethan...
how you could've stayed alive this long.

815
01:26:48,508 --> 01:26:49,828
Read this.

816
01:27:01,787 --> 01:27:02,777
"I...

817
01:27:04,028 --> 01:27:05,780
"... Ethan Edwards...

818
01:27:07,228 --> 01:27:09,378
"... being of a sound mind...

819
01:27:11,867 --> 01:27:12,983
"... and...

820
01:27:13,467 --> 01:27:15,618
"... without any blood kin...

821
01:27:22,346 --> 01:27:23,984
"... do hereby..."

822
01:27:27,466 --> 01:27:29,616
Bequeath. It means "leave."

823
01:27:31,147 --> 01:27:32,546
"... bequeath...

824
01:27:34,105 --> 01:27:35,937
"... all my property...

825
01:27:38,266 --> 01:27:39,938
"... of any kind...

826
01:27:43,226 --> 01:27:44,818
"... to Martin Pawley."

827
01:27:47,905 --> 01:27:50,658
What do you mean,
you don't have any "blood kin"?

828
01:27:51,185 --> 01:27:52,823
Debbie is your blood kin!

829
01:27:52,905 --> 01:27:54,542
Not no more, she ain't!

830
01:27:55,025 --> 01:27:56,902
Well, you can keep your will!

831
01:27:57,384 --> 01:27:59,455
I don't want any of your property!

832
01:27:59,745 --> 01:28:03,020
Besides, I ain't forgettin' you was gettin'
all set to shoot her yourself.

833
01:28:03,104 --> 01:28:04,503
What kind of man are you anyway?

834
01:28:04,584 --> 01:28:07,621
- She's been livin' with a buck!
- Shut your dirty mouth!

835
01:28:14,384 --> 01:28:15,782
I hope you die!

836
01:28:16,943 --> 01:28:18,662
That'll be the day!

837
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:17,896
Good evening, everybody!

838
01:29:20,339 --> 01:29:24,093
Here he is! All curried,
combed and washed behind the ears.

839
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:27,492
Charlie, you look right handsome!
I'd hardly know you.

840
01:29:27,579 --> 01:29:30,457
Yes, ma'am.
I can't hardly recognize myself.

841
01:29:31,339 --> 01:29:33,011
Get it on, Luther!

842
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:50,487
Why don't you have a drink?

843
01:29:50,577 --> 01:29:53,376
Oh, no, Nesby.
Not till I'm finished my clergyin'.

844
01:29:53,538 --> 01:29:55,767
Bar's closed. Right, Sister Jorgensen?

845
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:58,325
All right, let's go! Let's get it goin'!

846
01:30:09,616 --> 01:30:10,891
Go ahead.

847
01:30:13,736 --> 01:30:14,646
Bible.

848
01:30:17,936 --> 01:30:19,848
- Get them spurs off!
- Yes, sir.

849
01:30:24,056 --> 01:30:26,046
All right, line up inside, boys.

850
01:30:37,935 --> 01:30:40,323
"Yes, we will gather at the river

851
01:30:45,135 --> 01:30:47,602
"The beautiful, the beautiful river

852
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:55,328
"Gather with the saints at the river

853
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:02,242
"That flows by the throne of God"

854
01:31:16,052 --> 01:31:18,487
Hey, you don't suppose they're
throwin' a party for us, do you?

855
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:20,210
That'll be the day!

856
01:31:26,052 --> 01:31:27,245
I'm all right.

857
01:31:32,932 --> 01:31:36,685
Ethan, Martin! You can't come in!
The rangers are in there.

858
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:38,319
What's that got to do with us?

859
01:31:38,411 --> 01:31:40,686
You're both posted for murder.
The both of you!

860
01:31:40,771 --> 01:31:43,080
That trader, the late Futterman...

861
01:31:43,491 --> 01:31:46,085
The Reverend and the rangers
are in there now...

862
01:31:46,171 --> 01:31:48,081
Well, what's goin' on anyway?

863
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,961
Looks like you two will have
a lot to talk about.

864
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:01,405
- Come on, Lars.
- Ethan... hide in the barn!

865
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:02,525
What for?

866
01:32:08,409 --> 01:32:10,400
Please! Look, everybody!

867
01:32:11,089 --> 01:32:12,204
Look, Mama!

868
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:14,601
Look who's here!

869
01:32:16,648 --> 01:32:17,637
Evenin'.

870
01:32:20,848 --> 01:32:22,247
Is the bar open?

871
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:25,039
Any news of our little girl?

872
01:32:26,008 --> 01:32:28,078
She's not a little girl anymore.

873
01:32:28,328 --> 01:32:30,125
You've seen her? She's alive?

874
01:32:30,208 --> 01:32:32,438
I've seen her and she's alive.

875
01:32:33,967 --> 01:32:37,438
Good evening, Reverend.
Or should I call you "Captain"?

876
01:32:38,247 --> 01:32:40,283
I came here for a wedding, Ethan.

877
01:32:40,366 --> 01:32:44,121
Till that's over, "Reverend" will do.
Afterwards we'll talk.

878
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:46,118
- Is Marty with you?
- Yep.

879
01:32:52,007 --> 01:32:54,760
It's good to see you back, Ethan.
We'll join you.

880
01:32:55,926 --> 01:32:57,917
But I wrote you one letter.

881
01:32:58,527 --> 01:33:00,516
One letter in five years!

882
01:33:01,605 --> 01:33:05,121
I read it till the paper dried up
and the writin' faded out.

883
01:33:07,845 --> 01:33:09,723
It wasn't much of a letter, was it?

884
01:33:09,805 --> 01:33:10,999
No, it wasn't.

885
01:33:12,605 --> 01:33:14,755
Might've at least said you loved me.

886
01:33:15,285 --> 01:33:19,324
You might've asked me to wait for you.
At least that'd have been somethin'.

887
01:33:21,204 --> 01:33:22,923
But I always loved you!

888
01:33:24,085 --> 01:33:26,995
I thought you knew that
without me havin' to say it.

889
01:33:27,924 --> 01:33:30,119
It isn't fair, Martin Pawley!

890
01:33:31,325 --> 01:33:32,917
It isn't fair and you know it!

891
01:33:33,005 --> 01:33:35,723
- I wish you wouldn't cry, Laurie.
- Who's cryin'?

892
01:33:44,564 --> 01:33:47,839
I reckon the best thing for me to do
is to go away.

893
01:33:50,003 --> 01:33:52,597
You do, Martin Pawley, and I'll just die!

894
01:34:04,762 --> 01:34:07,276
I'll thank you to unhand my fiance.

895
01:34:11,802 --> 01:34:14,474
You don't mean you're
gonna be marryin' him?

896
01:34:16,882 --> 01:34:18,280
She sure is!

897
01:34:18,922 --> 01:34:22,231
And don't think your comin' back
is gonna change it either!

898
01:34:22,601 --> 01:34:25,241
Well, now, as to that,
I just don't know, Charlie.

899
01:34:25,321 --> 01:34:27,471
We hadn't gotten around
to talkin' about marriage.

900
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,836
What right have you to talk marriage
to any decent woman?

901
01:34:31,241 --> 01:34:33,311
If you're referrin' to
that crazy murder charge-

902
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,753
And other things.

903
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:40,429
You think you're gettin' away with
bein' smart about the Indian wife you took.

904
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,868
I'll bet she ain't the first squaw you ever-

905
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,631
Why, you are a no good-

906
01:34:49,959 --> 01:34:52,029
Oh, Marty, you've done it again!

907
01:34:55,239 --> 01:34:56,638
Get out of my way!

908
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,668
Marty! Charlie! I ain't gonna have
no fightin' in my house.

909
01:34:59,759 --> 01:35:02,716
Well, then we're just gonna fight outside,
doggone it!

910
01:35:02,799 --> 01:35:04,391
I ain't totin' no firearms.

911
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:06,912
Well, that sure ain't gonna be no problem.

912
01:35:08,597 --> 01:35:10,873
- After you, Marty.
- After you, Charlie.

913
01:35:18,077 --> 01:35:19,192
Look, here.

914
01:35:22,637 --> 01:35:23,706
Thank you.

915
01:35:31,877 --> 01:35:34,107
Spit over that piece of firewood.

916
01:35:51,116 --> 01:35:53,582
Quit that, Marty! That ain't fair!

917
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:04,466
Marty, now you stop that!

918
01:36:13,673 --> 01:36:16,472
Is this here altercation in the line of duty?

919
01:36:16,554 --> 01:36:19,864
No, sir. It's more in the nature
of a private fight.

920
01:36:19,953 --> 01:36:23,947
All right, then, go ahead.
But fight fair. No biting or gouging!

921
01:36:24,834 --> 01:36:26,552
And no kicking either!

922
01:36:28,233 --> 01:36:30,349
Get them up! Make them fight fair!

923
01:36:30,433 --> 01:36:31,912
Now you fight fair, Martin!

924
01:36:31,993 --> 01:36:33,426
Wait a minute!

925
01:36:34,112 --> 01:36:35,512
Somebody's fiddle.

926
01:36:39,233 --> 01:36:41,188
No choking! No gouging!

927
01:36:43,512 --> 01:36:45,105
Mr. Edwards, make 'em stop!

928
01:36:45,192 --> 01:36:46,705
Why? You started it.

929
01:36:47,391 --> 01:36:49,223
Marty, watch his feet!

930
01:36:52,592 --> 01:36:54,422
Don't forget, you're a lady.

931
01:37:11,071 --> 01:37:12,584
Come on, Charlie. Get up!

932
01:37:12,671 --> 01:37:14,342
Are you all right?

933
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:15,779
I reckon so.

934
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:20,906
Now, come on. I want you boys
to shake hands and make friends.

935
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:24,300
Sorry I bit your ear, Marty.

936
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:28,146
It don't hurt none, Charlie.

937
01:37:28,589 --> 01:37:32,026
Now you boys get cleaned up
and we'll proceed with the wedding.

938
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,220
Where's my Bible?

939
01:37:33,309 --> 01:37:35,539
There ain't gonna be no wedding.

940
01:37:43,229 --> 01:37:46,460
Not till we get a few things
cleared up around here.

941
01:37:52,908 --> 01:37:56,297
It was a nice wedding party,
considering nobody got married.

942
01:37:59,867 --> 01:38:02,381
Ethan, I gotta ask you and Martin
to take a ride with me...

943
01:38:02,467 --> 01:38:04,345
...down to the state capital.

944
01:38:05,068 --> 01:38:07,706
Is this an invite
to a necktie party, Reverend?

945
01:38:08,427 --> 01:38:10,304
No, I wouldn't say that.

946
01:38:11,067 --> 01:38:13,865
Likely you had your reasons
for killin' Futterman.

947
01:38:14,746 --> 01:38:16,384
Probably needed killin'.

948
01:38:17,027 --> 01:38:20,336
I'm talking to you now as a ranger,
not as a preacher.

949
01:38:21,466 --> 01:38:24,299
The fact that all three of 'em
was shot in the back was...

950
01:38:24,387 --> 01:38:26,899
...the only thing
that raised some questions.

951
01:38:27,465 --> 01:38:28,865
That, and...

952
01:38:29,466 --> 01:38:32,822
...a missin' gold piece that was
known to have been on him...

953
01:38:33,705 --> 01:38:35,696
...just prior to his demise.

954
01:38:37,585 --> 01:38:40,178
Ethan, I'll have to ask you for your gun.

955
01:38:52,825 --> 01:38:55,418
Well, if it's all the same to you, Reverend...

956
01:38:56,064 --> 01:38:57,463
...I ain't goin' to Austin!

957
01:38:57,544 --> 01:38:59,694
You're goin' if the captain says so.

958
01:39:00,263 --> 01:39:01,538
Stop it! Stop it!

959
01:39:01,624 --> 01:39:04,696
I'll put both of you boys
in the smokehouse to cool off.

960
01:39:07,503 --> 01:39:09,778
Good evening, ma'am. Captain Clayton?

961
01:39:11,263 --> 01:39:12,617
Excuse me, ma'am.

962
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:15,859
- Captain Clayton, sir?
- No.

963
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:19,175
I'm Captain Clayton.

964
01:39:19,383 --> 01:39:22,181
- You're Captain Clayton?
- Yes, I'm Captain Clayton.

965
01:39:22,262 --> 01:39:24,777
Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.
The colonel wants to know-

966
01:39:24,863 --> 01:39:26,853
- Is your head cold?
- No, sir.

967
01:39:28,102 --> 01:39:29,456
I'm sorry, sir.

968
01:39:30,102 --> 01:39:33,935
- All right, start at the beginning.
- Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.

969
01:39:34,061 --> 01:39:36,734
Hold on, son. Who is this Col. Greenhill
you're talking about?

970
01:39:36,821 --> 01:39:38,699
Why, Col. Greenhill is Col. Greenhill, sir.

971
01:39:38,782 --> 01:39:40,578
- Commanding officer of the 15th-
- And who are you?

972
01:39:40,661 --> 01:39:42,299
I'm Lt. Greenhill, sir.

973
01:39:42,381 --> 01:39:44,452
What is it your pa wants to know?

974
01:39:45,261 --> 01:39:46,489
Well, go ahead.

975
01:39:47,221 --> 01:39:49,177
My pa wants to know...
Col. Greenhill wants to know...

976
01:39:49,261 --> 01:39:52,412
- ... how soon you can put a company-
- Turn around, sonny.

977
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:55,735
Yeah, he's a Yankee cavalryman.

978
01:39:56,461 --> 01:40:00,294
Col. Greenhill wants to know how soon
you could... I resent that, sir!

979
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:02,371
Just funnin', son, just funnin'.

980
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:05,568
How soon you could put a company
of your men in the field...

981
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:07,651
...fully armed for joint-punitive action
against the Comanches?

982
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:09,970
- Joint what?
- Joint-punitive action.

983
01:40:10,460 --> 01:40:14,168
We received information about a band
of Comanches under a chief named Scar.

984
01:40:14,259 --> 01:40:15,612
What information?

985
01:40:15,979 --> 01:40:17,776
That maybe he's not far from here,
holed up somewhere.

986
01:40:17,859 --> 01:40:19,611
What makes you think
he's not far from here?

987
01:40:19,699 --> 01:40:21,451
One of our patrollers picked up a man...

988
01:40:21,539 --> 01:40:23,769
...claims he was a prisoner with Scar
till two days ago.

989
01:40:23,859 --> 01:40:26,054
Talks kind of crazy,
but we brought him along.

990
01:40:26,139 --> 01:40:29,096
Says he lives here.
Keeps mentioning a rocking chair.

991
01:40:34,898 --> 01:40:36,091
Take his arms.

992
01:40:39,379 --> 01:40:40,447
It's Mose!

993
01:40:41,137 --> 01:40:44,289
Good evening, ma'am.
I came for my rocking chair.

994
01:40:44,778 --> 01:40:46,847
- Bring him to the fire.
- Watch him!

995
01:40:48,857 --> 01:40:50,006
Get him up!

996
01:40:51,018 --> 01:40:52,848
Here, get him a chair.

997
01:40:53,697 --> 01:40:55,369
Bring him a drink!

998
01:40:56,537 --> 01:40:57,764
Watch his head!

999
01:40:59,657 --> 01:41:02,171
- Take a drink, Mose.
- Drink that down, Mose.

1000
01:41:06,256 --> 01:41:08,291
Mose. Scar... where is he?

1001
01:41:09,296 --> 01:41:12,572
My rocking chair.
You promised me my rocking chair.

1002
01:41:13,736 --> 01:41:16,455
Ask him about Debbie.
Is Debbie all right, Mose?

1003
01:41:18,295 --> 01:41:19,966
Made out I was crazy.

1004
01:41:23,735 --> 01:41:26,045
You don't think I'm crazy, do you, ma'am?

1005
01:41:26,135 --> 01:41:28,364
No, Mose, you're just sick and hurt.

1006
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:29,684
Thank you, ma'am.

1007
01:41:29,775 --> 01:41:32,687
Mose, try and remember.
You were at Scar's camp.

1008
01:41:33,174 --> 01:41:36,132
I ate dirt and chewed grass. I fooled them.

1009
01:41:36,254 --> 01:41:37,926
Where is Scar holed up?

1010
01:41:38,414 --> 01:41:39,733
I won't tell you.

1011
01:41:41,653 --> 01:41:43,246
I'll tell Marty.

1012
01:41:43,654 --> 01:41:45,452
Seven Fingers, Marty.

1013
01:41:47,293 --> 01:41:49,683
That's enough, Ethan.
Let's get him to bed.

1014
01:41:49,774 --> 01:41:52,241
- Seven Fingers?
- Beg to report, sir...

1015
01:41:52,654 --> 01:41:56,168
...that's what he told us,
but there's no such place on the maps.

1016
01:41:58,134 --> 01:42:02,126
Isn't it the Caddo name for where
all them canyons join under the Malapai?

1017
01:42:02,613 --> 01:42:04,524
Seven Fingers of Brazos!

1018
01:42:07,412 --> 01:42:08,481
My rocking chair?

1019
01:42:08,572 --> 01:42:09,801
We'll bring it.

1020
01:42:11,772 --> 01:42:14,047
You go tell your pa that
a company of rangers...

1021
01:42:14,132 --> 01:42:16,248
...all 14 of 'em, fully armed and equipped...

1022
01:42:16,332 --> 01:42:18,004
...will be in the field by daylight.

1023
01:42:18,092 --> 01:42:20,401
We'll be headin' for the south end
of the Malapai.

1024
01:42:20,491 --> 01:42:23,086
If he can catch up with us,
all well and good!

1025
01:42:23,732 --> 01:42:27,246
We can't take the field tomorrow.
For your own protection.

1026
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:30,965
Sonny. Out yonder is a pack
of murderers...

1027
01:42:31,251 --> 01:42:34,288
...complete with Texican scalps
and a white-girl captive!

1028
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:37,203
If you want to protect us,
just keep out of our way.

1029
01:42:37,291 --> 01:42:39,360
Now you skedaddle back to your pa!

1030
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:43,879
You and Martin are hereby appointed
civilian scouts. Without pay.

1031
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:47,724
Take the boys and get back
to headquarters and pick up my company.

1032
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:59,560
You're not going! Not this time.

1033
01:43:00,729 --> 01:43:01,923
Are you crazy?

1034
01:43:02,329 --> 01:43:05,002
It's too late. She is a woman grown now.

1035
01:43:05,649 --> 01:43:08,163
I gotta go, Laurie. I gotta fetch her home.

1036
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:09,602
Fetch what?

1037
01:43:09,888 --> 01:43:13,597
The leavings of Comanche bucks sold time
and again to the highest bidder with-

1038
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:15,007
Laurie, shut your mouth!

1039
01:43:15,088 --> 01:43:17,557
Do you know what Ethan
will do if he has a chance?

1040
01:43:17,648 --> 01:43:19,639
He'll put a bullet in her brain!

1041
01:43:20,288 --> 01:43:22,518
I tell you, Martha would want him to!

1042
01:43:22,968 --> 01:43:24,366
Only if I'm dead!

1043
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:13,479
We can get within 200 yards of them.

1044
01:44:14,125 --> 01:44:16,400
There's a hub back off to the left.

1045
01:44:17,485 --> 01:44:18,964
How many, you figure?

1046
01:44:19,724 --> 01:44:21,442
About a dozen each.

1047
01:44:22,044 --> 01:44:23,523
Enough to go around.

1048
01:44:32,043 --> 01:44:33,761
Well, we found 'em!

1049
01:44:35,563 --> 01:44:36,678
Now, men...

1050
01:44:37,003 --> 01:44:40,837
...the state of Texas is paying you
12 Yankee dollars a month.

1051
01:44:42,403 --> 01:44:44,314
Now is your chance to earn it!

1052
01:44:44,563 --> 01:44:47,872
Tighten up your cinches.
We'll go chargin' in about sunup.

1053
01:44:48,523 --> 01:44:51,162
- Now make sure that-
- Just a minute, Reverend!

1054
01:44:56,922 --> 01:44:59,594
If we go charging in, they'll kill her!
And you know it.

1055
01:44:59,682 --> 01:45:02,276
- That's what I'm countin' on.
- I know you are.

1056
01:45:02,641 --> 01:45:05,394
Well, it ain't gonna be that way!
She's alive and she's gonna stay alive!

1057
01:45:05,482 --> 01:45:07,073
Living with Comanches ain't bein' alive.

1058
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:10,234
It's better she's alive and livin' with
Comanches than her brains bashed out!

1059
01:45:10,321 --> 01:45:13,074
Now, son, I know
this is a bitter thing to say...

1060
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:15,556
...but there's more at stake here
than your sister.

1061
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:18,280
There sure is.
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

1062
01:45:19,001 --> 01:45:22,151
I didn't mean to speak of it,
but I'm gonna tell you now.

1063
01:45:22,441 --> 01:45:26,035
You remember that scalp strung
on Scar's lance? Long and wavy?

1064
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:29,597
Yeah, I saw it. And don't try to tell me
it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's!

1065
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:31,238
It was your mother's.

1066
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,716
That don't change it.
That don't change nothing!

1067
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:45,389
Give me a chance to sneak in and
get her out, before you come chargin' in.

1068
01:45:45,479 --> 01:45:46,467
What if you get caught?

1069
01:45:46,558 --> 01:45:49,755
- That don't tell them nothin', does it?
- I said no!

1070
01:45:50,759 --> 01:45:55,274
You go right ahead, son. But at the first
sign of an alarm, we're comin' in.

1071
01:45:56,839 --> 01:46:00,626
We ain't gonna have no time to pick
and choose our targets when we do!

1072
01:46:03,318 --> 01:46:04,717
It's your funeral.

1073
01:47:08,394 --> 01:47:09,712
Captain Clayton!

1074
01:47:11,274 --> 01:47:12,593
Captain Clayton!

1075
01:47:12,954 --> 01:47:14,466
What the Sam Hill...?

1076
01:47:19,712 --> 01:47:23,422
Go ahead! Why don't you have
your bugler blow the charge too?

1077
01:47:25,154 --> 01:47:28,030
Oh, never mind.
Does your pa know you're out here?

1078
01:47:28,272 --> 01:47:30,662
Yes, sir. The troops are 10 miles back.

1079
01:47:30,912 --> 01:47:32,551
The colonel sent me to find you.

1080
01:47:32,633 --> 01:47:35,226
You found me. Good work and goodbye.

1081
01:47:35,632 --> 01:47:37,305
Is there anything I can do, sir?

1082
01:47:37,393 --> 01:47:38,508
God forbid.

1083
01:47:38,592 --> 01:47:42,470
You just go back and tell your pa
where we are and where he is.

1084
01:47:42,952 --> 01:47:45,466
But he knows that, sir. Can't I stay?

1085
01:47:46,671 --> 01:47:47,660
Please?

1086
01:47:48,711 --> 01:47:51,350
Oh, all right. But you watch me, boy.

1087
01:47:51,672 --> 01:47:55,550
I'm the hard case you're up against
out here, not them childish savages.

1088
01:47:55,791 --> 01:47:58,066
If you don't hear my first holler...

1089
01:47:58,311 --> 01:47:59,629
...you better read my mind...

1090
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:03,386
...'cause I don't aim to raise no two hollers
on any subject at hand!

1091
01:48:03,471 --> 01:48:05,109
- Yes, sir.
- Boy...

1092
01:48:05,991 --> 01:48:07,469
...watch that knife!

1093
01:48:07,670 --> 01:48:08,785
Sorry, sir.

1094
01:48:28,028 --> 01:48:29,018
Halt!

1095
01:48:30,909 --> 01:48:31,898
Mount!

1096
01:48:36,589 --> 01:48:37,738
Mount!

1097
01:49:11,426 --> 01:49:12,654
Don't say anything!

1098
01:49:12,746 --> 01:49:14,384
It's your brother Marty!

1099
01:49:14,585 --> 01:49:18,022
I'm gonna take you away.
I'm gonna get you out of here, Debbie.

1100
01:49:18,907 --> 01:49:20,021
Yes, Marty!

1101
01:49:28,386 --> 01:49:30,502
Brethren, let us go amongst them!

1102
01:50:08,982 --> 01:50:11,338
Charlie, Nesby, run off that pony herd-

1103
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:14,092
Boy, you watch out for that knife!

1104
01:50:14,182 --> 01:50:15,456
Let's go!

1105
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:49,649
No, Ethan!

1106
01:51:13,899 --> 01:51:14,968
No, Ethan!

1107
01:51:27,857 --> 01:51:29,495
Let's go home, Debbie.

1108
01:51:38,457 --> 01:51:40,572
- Does that hurt, Reverend?
- Shut up!

1109
01:51:54,936 --> 01:51:57,052
Good work, Captain! Good work, Son.

1110
01:51:57,856 --> 01:51:59,255
You wounded?

1111
01:52:00,055 --> 01:52:02,047
- A bullet? An arrow?
- No!

1112
01:52:51,453 --> 01:52:53,124
"A man will search

1113
01:52:55,172 --> 01:52:56,891
"His heart and soul

1114
01:52:58,773 --> 01:53:00,842
"Go searching way out there

1115
01:53:05,692 --> 01:53:07,363
"His peace of mind

01:53:09,052 --> 01:53:10,804
"He knows he'll find

01:53:12,611 --> 01:53:14,283
"But where, O Lord

1118
01:53:16,091 --> 01:53:17,491
"Lord, where

1119
01:53:21,571 --> 01:53:22,890
"Ride away

01:53:28,731 --> 01:53:30,049
