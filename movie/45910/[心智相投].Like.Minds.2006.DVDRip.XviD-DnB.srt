2
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,852
来吧！
Come on!

3
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,516
呼！
Whooo!

4
00:00:58,588 --> 00:00:59,766
来吧！
Come on!

5
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:02,225
来吧！
Come on!

6
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,282
是啊！
Yeah!

7
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:04,436
喔！
Whoo!

8
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:20,945
看着他们
Keep an eye on them.

9
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:05,078
记不起什么时候，开始注意到这种改变
I can't remember when I first noticed the change.

10
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:08,157
并不是说我没有看到它
It's not that I didn't see it coming.

11
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:11,034
只是不愿意去相信
I just didn't want to believe it.

12
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:13,685
我猜这不是一个好借口
I guess that's not much of an excuse,

13
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,133
但却是事实
but it's the truth.

14
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:17,752
你这个邪恶的小鬼
You're an evil little fucker.

15
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:34,200
我想这看起来很糟糕
I guess it didn't look good.

16
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,533
但他不得不死
But he had to die.

17
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,989
为了达到目的，不得不这样
It was a necessary means to an end.

18
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,437
我只能说，当时，苍穹垂落
All I can tell you
is that the heavens were falling.

19
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,113
有声音，它...
And the sound, it...

20
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,539
那声音...令人难以置信 它...
The sound... it was incredible. It was..

21
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:59,579
它仿佛是众神的喜悦
It was like the gods were rejoicing

22
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:00,794
为那已尽之事
for what was done.

23
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:14,849



24
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,349


25
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:31,671
对不起，伙计们
Sorry, guys.

26
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,396


27
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:42,013
很高兴你能来
Glad you could make it.

28
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,384
好事总是给愿意等待的人的
Mmm. Good things come to those who wait.

29
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:46,491
哦，“你也好啊”，马丁
And "Hello" to you, too, Martin.

30
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:48,668
他是一个17岁的聪明的混蛋
He's a 17-year-old smart-ass

31
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:49,721
富二代
little rich kid.

32
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:50,907
有人施压让我放他走
I'm under pressure to let him go

33
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,473
因为都只是些间接证据
because the evidence is circumstantial,

34
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:53,757
我已经起诉了他
so I charged him.

35
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:57,276
需要你来证明他有罪。
I need you to find him culpable.

36
00:03:58,243 --> 00:03:59,672
还有别的吗？
Anything else?

37
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:01,307
祝你好运
Good luck.

38
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,801
幸运是给爱尔兰人的，麦肯齐
Luck's for the Irish, McKenzie.

39
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:13,371
你好，阿历克斯
Hello, Alex.

40
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,298
我叫莎莉・罗
My name's Sally Rowe.

41
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:17,251
我是法医心理学家
I'm a forensic psychologist.

42
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:18,429
我被指定来跟你谈谈
I've been asked to talk to you

43
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,961
看看究竟发生了什么事
to find out what happened.

44
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:22,403
这次审问中，你需要旁人在场吗？
Would you like someone
present during this interview?

45
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:25,058
你需要吗？
Would you?

46
00:04:27,044 --> 00:04:28,419
介意我录音吗？
You mind if I record?

47
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:39,459
给我讲讲你的朋友...奈杰尔
Tell me about your friend... Nigel.

48
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:41,248
哦，他不是我朋友
Oh, he wasn't my friend.

49
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,413
那当你说：“他的...
What did you mean when you said, "His...

50
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,340
死亡是，通往结局的必要手段？”
death was a necessary means to an end?"

51
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:47,867
你认为我杀了他吗？
Do you think that I did this?

52
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,646
我是来听你说的，阿历克斯。
I'm here to listen to you, Alex.

53
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:56,573
13世纪期间...
During the 13th century...

54
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,980
有一群人，被称为清教徒
there were these people known as Cathars.

55
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,180
他们坚信
And they insisted

56
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:03,937
只有上帝，是唯一至高权威
that God could only be experienced firsthand,

57
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:07,137
所以，他们驱逐所有的神父和主教
so they banished all the priests
and the bishops.

58
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,093
而这些，破坏了梵蒂冈的权威
Now, this undermined the power of the Vatican,

59
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:12,475
也使教皇失去了教区的宝贵收入
which caused the Pope
to lose precious revenues in the region.

60
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:16,349
你喜欢历史，阿历克斯
You like history, Alex.

61
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:20,581
在1209年...
In 1209...

62
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:23,614
一支梵蒂冈军队突袭了
清教徒的村庄
a Vatican army descended upon Cathar villages,

63
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:26,916
屠杀了每一个男人，女人，小孩
and every man, woman,
and child was slaughtered.

64
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,634
而当一个官员询问教皇
And when an officer inquired to the Pope

65
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:32,158
如何区分异教徒，和真正的信徒时
how to distinguish
between the heretics and the true believers,

66
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,857
你知道他的回答是什么吗？
you know what his response was?

67
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:35,007
“杀光所有人，
"Kill them all.

68
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,120
上帝本人自会区分”
God will recognize his own."

69
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,283
你为什么跟我说这个？
And why are you telling me this?

70
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:46,338
你信仰宗教吗，罗小姐？
Are you a religious woman, Ms. Rowe?

71
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:48,098
这很重要吗？
Is that important to you?

72
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,109
想不想知道我的信仰？
Well, do you want to know what I believe in?

73
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,421
这会是个好的开始。
It would be a good place to start.

74
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,244
{\a6\fs12\fn黑体}（又称完形心理学，认为整体不等于部分之和，意识不等于感觉元素的集合，行为不等于反射弧的循环）

74
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,244
格式塔理论
Gestalt.


75
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,621
格式塔
Gestalt

76
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,866
一个有组织的整体
An organized whole

77
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:59,686
其中每个独立的成分，
都牵连到其他成分，
in which each individual part affects every other,

78
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:02,021
但整体远远大于部分之和
but the whole being more important
than the sum of its parts.

79
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,903
是的，我很熟悉一年级心理学理论
Yeah, I'm familiar with first-year psychology theory.

80
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:06,397
我应该赞叹吗？
Should I be impressed?

81
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:08,512
重要的，不是它是什么
That's not what it is.

82
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:12,004
而是如何利用它
It's how you use it.

83
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,960
怎么做？
And how's that?

84
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,519
你才是心理学家
Well, you're the psychologist.

85
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,900
你看，奈杰尔的死
Look, Nigel's dead.

86
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,376
我已经被指控谋杀
I've been charged with murder.

87
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,329
现在，我的信仰并不重要，不是吗？
Doesn't really matter what I believe in, now, does it?

88
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,923
你不是让人第一印象良好的人嘛，
阿历克斯？
You're not one for making good first impressions, are you, Alex?

89
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:42,559


90
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,600


91
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,378


92
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,727
[全体]阿门。
[All]Amen.

93
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:58,247
新来的家伙是谁？
Who's the new guy?

94
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,301
我不知道
I don't know.

95
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:04,832
嗯，他搬到你的房间去了
Well, he was slipping up to your room.

96
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:06,052
什么？
Sorry?

97
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:08,262
我看到他们在你的房里加了张床
Well, I saw them put an extra bed in your room before.

98
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:09,378
胡说八道
That's bollocks.

99
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:10,728
他们加了
Well, they did.

100
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:17,951
先生？
Sir?

101
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:19,304
先生？
Sir?

102
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,833
先生，请问我能获准离席吗？
Sir, can I have permission to leave, please?

103
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,144
你要去哪里，福布斯先生？
Where do you need to go, Mr. Forbes?

104
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:24,258
去洗手间
To the bathroom.

105
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:25,858
不能等等吗，孩子？
Can't it wait, boy?

106
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:27,459
嗯，很难说，先生
Well, that's hard to say, sir.

107
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:28,874
这是相当紧迫的事
It's quite urgent business.

108
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:26,883
能让开吗？
Do you mind?

109
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:37,763
别太安逸了
Don't get too comfortable.

110
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:49,382
他什么样？
What's he like?

111
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:51,146
怪胎
Weird.

112
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:53,354
他收藏了一些动物标本
He's got this collection of stuffed animals.

113
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:55,311
现在玩那个是不是有点老了？
Isn't he a bit old for that?

114
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,837
真正的动物，你个傻瓜
Real animals, you dick.

115
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,860
酷
Cool.

116
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:00,652
你听说过他的事吗？
Have you heard anything about him?

117
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,956
嗯，很难找到他的污点
Well, it's been hard to get any dirt on him.

118
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,649
晚餐时我听到一些人
I heard some guys at dinner

119
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,608
说他曾经是圣爱德华中学的走读生
saying that he used to be
a day boy at St. Edward's.

120
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,620
真的
Really.

121
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:08,940
是啊
Yeah.

122
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:09,990
但是很显然，他有
But apparently, he had

123
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:11,493
一些家庭问题
some kind of family issues.

124
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:12,713
所以打发他来这里？
So they sent him here?

125
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,345
哦，那会治好他的
Oh, that'll fix him.

126
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,529


127
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,127
乔希相当疯狂
[Alex, narrating]Josh was pretty crazy.

128
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:20,267
他的父亲希望他成为一名政治家
His dad wanted him to be a politician.

129
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:24,078
天啊，对自己娃都做了些啥
Christ, what a pile of shite to put on your only child.

130
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:25,093
哦！
[Explosion]Ohh!

131
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,663
- 哈哈哈！   
- 妈的，伙计们
- Ha ha ha!  - For fuck's sake, guys.

132
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:28,559
你们在闹哪样？
What the fuck are you guys doing?

133
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:31,472
拉吉是乔希的室友
[Alex, narrating]Raj was Josh's roommate.

134
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:32,486
他只是跟在我们后面混
He just kind of hung out with us.

135
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:33,968
从来不喜欢过激
Never liked pushing the limit.

136
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:34,981


137
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,431
哦，那也无妨，我想
Oh, it was just as well, I guess.

138
00:09:36,497 --> 00:09:37,446
哦
Ooh.

139
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:39,561


140
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:49,675
他很特别
[Alex, narrating]He was different.

141
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:52,266
是的，我会这样评价他
Yeah, I'll give him that.

142
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:54,672
我想这就是为啥
我开始觉得他很有趣
I guess that's why I found him interesting at first.

143
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:56,364



144
00:09:56,434 --> 00:10:00,263
他有那种让所有事物死去的病态魅力
And he had this morbid fascination with all things dead.

145
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,135
那你呢，亚历克斯？
[Sally]And what about you, Alex?

146
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:11,373
我跟警察讲过所有事情
I told the police everything.

147
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:12,425
为什么不去问问他们？
Why don't you ask them?

148
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:14,538
我在问你，阿里克斯
I'm asking you, Alex.

149
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:17,389
你有孩子吗？
Do you have any children?

150
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,077
我的意思是，你长得不错
I mean, well, you're not bad-looking.

151
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:22,122
我想如果你想要孩子的话，
时间不多了吧？
I think you're running out of time, you know?

152
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:23,471
你的时间才不多了了
No, you're the one running out of time.

153
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,841
我曾经看到过，说，有三分之一的女人学习心理学
I read once
that a third of women study psychology

154
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:28,558
是用来解决私人问题，你怎么看？
to work out their own personal problems.
What do you think?

155
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,146
跟我讲讲奈杰尔
Tell me about Nigel.

156
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,042
奈杰尔得到了他想要的
Well, Nigel got what he wanted.

157
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:34,416
得到什么？
And what was that?

158
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:36,904
永恒
Eternity.

159
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,648


160
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,928
哦，你没懂，是吧？
Oh, you don't get it, do you?

161
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,529
你会的
You will.

162
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,475
你会的
You will.

163
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,897



164
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:23,690
怎么啦？
What's going on?

165
00:11:24,662 --> 00:11:26,188
没什么我搞不定的
Nothing I can't handle.

166
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:27,472
进展得怎样？
How did you get on?

167
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,298
这个案子简直乱七八糟，麦肯齐
Well, this case is bullshit, McKenzie.

168
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:30,314
你是什么意思？
What do you mean?

169
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,339
哦，你能搞定
Oh, you can afford me

170
00:11:31,413 --> 00:11:32,591
只需要一点点智慧
just a little intelligence.

171
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:35,215
这个孩子有罪，莎莉，相信我
This kid's guilty, Sally.
Trust me on this.

172
00:11:35,286 --> 00:11:37,042
你不能凭直觉来抓他
You can't hold him on a hunch.

173
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,427
他是个疯狂的，冷酷的神经病
He's a fucked-up, remorseless little psycho.

174
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:43,371
所以呢，这种人到处都是
So? Probably make a great match at bancor.

175
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:45,388
那些宗教狗屁呢？
And what about all this religious shit?

176
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:47,153
他说的没有一点能定案
None of what I've heard makes him a murderer.

177
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:48,880
你没有任何确凿的证据来指控他
You've charged him without any hard evidence.

178
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,569
你给自己挖了个坑，
又想让我拉你出来
You've dug yourself a hole,
and now you want me to get you out of it.

179
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:54,452
这事能让你的前途大有好处，萨尔
Could be good for the old career, Sal.

180
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,591
门上贴上你的名牌
Get your name on the door.

181
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:58,998
随意指使那些大男孩
You could be kicking around with the big boys.

182
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:01,452
而且肯定，会有大量的公众宣传
There'll be lots of publicity. Guarantee it.

183
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:02,574
我走了
I'm out.

184
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,101
那看在往日的情面上，
吃意大利菜怎么样？
How about some Italian, then, for old times' sake?

185
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:09,138
那是“不”
Take that as a no.

186
00:13:08,026 --> 00:13:08,974


187
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:12,113
那你想知道我的信仰吗？
[Alex on recording]Don't you want to know what I believe in?

188
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:14,096
这会是个好的开始
[Sally]It would be a good place to start.

189
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,283
格式塔
[Alex]Gestalt.

190
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:16,302
格式塔
[Sally]Gestalt.

191
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,687
一个有组织的整体
[Alex]An organized whole

192
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:19,315
其中每个独立的成分
in which each individual part

193
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:21,175
都牵连到其他成分，但整体
affects every other, but the whole

194
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:22,836
远远大于部分之和
being more important
than the sum of its parts.

195
00:13:22,907 --> 00:13:23,954
是的，我很熟悉
[Sally]Yeah, I'm familiar

196
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,336
一年级心理学理论
with first-year psychology theory.

197
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:26,809
我应该赞叹吗？
Should I be impressed?

198
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,663
重要的，不是它是什么
[Alex]That's not what it is.

199
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:31,568
而是如何利用它
It's how you use it.

200
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:32,591



201
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,616



202
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:34,868
我应该赞叹吗？
[Sally]Should I be impressed?

203
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,914
重要的，不是它是什么
[Alex]That's not what it is.

204
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:38,361
而是如何利用它
It's how you use it.

205
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:39,376



206
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:02,999



207
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:04,017



208
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,303
什么气味？
What is that smell?

209
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:13,562
恶...
Ohhh...

210
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,385
天啊，开什么玩笑
No. You gotta be kidding me.

211
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,865
你从哪弄的这玩意？
Where did you get that?

212
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,061
我在问你问题
I asked you a question.

213
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,507
你从哪弄的？
Where did you get it?

214
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,830
好吧，那就干脆利落点
All right, let's make this nice and clear.

215
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:30,040
我声明，我不是很喜欢你
I mean, I don't like you very much.

216
00:14:30,109 --> 00:14:31,898
事实上，我真的开始讨厌你了
In fact, I'm really beginning to dislike you.

217
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,721
但如果我们必须共处一室
But if I have to spend time in the same room with you,

218
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,862
那你至少应该讲点礼貌
you can at least show me some common courtesy.

219
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:38,746
还有别的吗？
Is there anything else?

220
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,019



221
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,597
他们一定很绝望
[Alex]They must be quite desperate,

222
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,131
才会又让你来
sending you in again.

223
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,642
他们没有定案，是吧？
They don't have a case, do they?

224
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,620
怎么这么说，亚历克斯？
What makes you say that, Alex?

225
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:03,801
如果他们有任何证据
Well, if they had any evidence,

226
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:05,497
我就不需要跟你谈话了吧？
I wouldn't be talking to you, would I?

227
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,821
不是吗？
Would I?

228
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:13,722
你能拘留我多久？
How long can you keep me here?

229
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,715
这些都取决于
你什么时候乐意跟我坦白
All that depends on how soon you're willing to talk to me.

230
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:21,627
你什么都不知道
You know nothing.[Snickers]

231
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:25,140
你一点都不知道
You know absolutely nothing.

232
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,906
你也是
That goes for you, too.

233
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,389



234
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:36,602
刚刚取证出来
This just came in from forensics.

235
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:39,127
枪击残留模式表明
Gunshot residue patterns indicate

236
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
当它开火时你正拿着枪
that you were holding
the gun when it was discharged.

237
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,182
你的衣服都是残留的火药
Your clothes were covered in the stuff.

238
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,614
我想见我父亲
I want to see my father.

239
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:49,536
我不认为他能帮你
I don't think he's gonna be able to help you.

240
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:51,740
我没做过  
是奈杰尔扳动了扳机
I did not do this. Nigel pulled that fucking trigger.

241
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:53,664
把你的手拿开！
Get your fucking hands off her!

242
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:55,158
- 住手！住手！  
- 哦！
- Stop! Stop!   - Ohh!

243
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,545
你他妈的疯了！
You're fucking insane!

244
00:15:59,617 --> 00:16:00,926
把他锁起来
Take him to lockup.

245
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,848
- 来吧！ 
- 你...你知道我没做！
- Come on!  - You... You know I did not do this!

246
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:05,663
你知道我没有...放开我！
You know I did not... Get off of me!

247
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:07,256
你带我去哪？！
Where are you taking me?!

248
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:09,402
你能不能放开我？！ 放开你的手！
Would you get off of me?! Get your fucking hands off me!

249
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:11,807
你想带我去哪？！
Where do you think you're taking me?!

250
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:14,208
放开我！把你的...
Get off me! Get your...

251
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,152



252
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,852


253
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:20,507
我们应该齐心协力
We are meant to be working together on this.

254
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:24,190
你胆敢再来打断我
Don't you ever interrupt me

255
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:25,535
当我和病人在一起时
when I'm in session with a patient.

256
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:26,584
等下
Just hold on a minute.

257
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:28,513
你刚攻击了一个17岁的孩子
You just assaulted a 17-year-old child.

258
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:29,788
这事能让你丢掉工作
I could have your job for that.

259
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:30,938
我是要保护你
I was tryin' to protect you.

260
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,504
少来这套
Don't bullshit me.

261
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:36,027
奈杰尔・科比手上有枪药残留吗？
Did Nigel Colbie have gunshot residue on his hands?

262
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:37,625
等下，萨尔，有一些东西我..
Look. Sal, there are some things l...

263
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:40,187
科比手上有残留火药吗？！
Did Colbie have gunpowder on his hands?!

264
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,207
是，有
Yes, he did.

265
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:43,105
所以可能是他开的枪
So he could've fired that gun.

266
00:16:44,163 --> 00:16:45,407
瞧瞧，他根本无所谓
Look, he was taking a piss.

267
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:46,849
我只是想加快点进度
I just wanted to speed things up a little.

268
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:48,703
是什么让你觉得自己有那个权利
What makes you think
you have the intelligence

269
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,488
来判断那个男孩是不是在糊弄我？
to determine whether or not
that boy was fucking with me?

270
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:52,831
只要他承认
Well, as long as he confesses,

271
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,274
那些都不重要，不是吗？
it doesn't matter, does it?

272
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:57,885
如果用我的方式让阿历克斯承认，
才能在法庭上站得住脚。
If Alex confesses my way, it'll stand up in court.

273
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:00,664
好吧
All right.

274
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:03,065
好吧
[Sighs]All right.

275
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:06,205
只是...我需要时间，所以别插嘴
Just... I need time, so just butt out.

276
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,901
你的强势根本吓不倒这孩子
Your strong-arm stuff
won't cut it with this boy.

277
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:09,882
- 他聪明得多
- 萨尔
- He's too smart for that. - Sal.

278
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,847
你不会上报这事吧？
You're not gonna report this, are you?

279
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:17,793
罗医生，我想你最好来一下
Dr. Rowe, I think you'd better come.

280
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:22,332
让我出去
Just let me out there.

281
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:23,387
不，得了，只是...只要
No. Come on. Just... Just

282
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,409
出去，这就是我的要求
out there. That's all I'm asking.

283
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:25,662
只要让我出去。 不，不，现在...
Just let me out. No. No. Now...

284
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,107
想都别想！
Don't you even think about that!

285
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,285
- 啊！
- 你他妈的...
- Aah!  - You fucking...

286
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:29,305
啊！哦！
Aah! Ohh!

287
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,329
- 放开我！
- Unhh！
- Get off me!  - Unhh!

288
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,387
Unhh！
Unhh!

289
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:32,574
啊！
Aahh!

290
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,818
放开！呃！
[Alex]Get off! Uhh!

291
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:37,441
你他妈的放开我！
Get the fuck off me!

292
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,444
- 你，靠后
- 放手！
- You stay back.  - Get off!

293
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,615
好吧，他都是你的
Fine. He's all yours.

294
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:44,863
噢！
Ow!

295
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:50,689
哦，天啊！拉他起来！
Oh, God!Let him up!

296
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,828
他们说你想谈谈
They say you want to talk.

297
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,325
先出去吧
Leave us.

298
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:04,511
我会没事的
I'll be fine.

299
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,057
奈杰尔陷害我
Nigel set me up.

300
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,129
你怎么想出来的？
How do you figure that?

301
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,475
你得相信我
You have to believe me.

302
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:28,477
他把所有事弄得都像是我干的
He set the whole thing up to make it look like I did it.

303
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,996
奈杰尔设了个圈套，
看起来像你杀了他
Nigel set it up to make it look like you killed him.

304
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,381
我以为你撒谎会撒得好些
I think you can do better than that.

305
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:37,797
我没杀他
I didn't kill him.

306
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:44,134
你并不像是案子的被害人，阿历克斯
You don't exactly come across
as the victim here, Alex.

307
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,389
感觉到了吗？
Feel that?

308
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,429
你能感觉到吗？
Can you feel that?

309
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,433
他在这里
He's here.

310
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,888
他在听，他在看
He's listening.He's watching.

311
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,487
谁，阿历克斯？
Who, Alex?

312
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,153
嘘！听听
Shh! Listening.

313
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:07,423
听听
Listen.

314
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,766



315
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:12,131



316
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:13,477



317
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:14,755
全体起立！
All rise!

318
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:19,390
《信徒如同精兵》
[Onward, Christian Soldiers]
(歌词来源网络，谢谢）

319
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,860
＃信徒如同精兵＃
# Onward, Christian soldiers #

320
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,640
＃奋勇向前行＃
# Marching as to war #

321
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:49,897
＃十字架为旗号＃
# With the cross of Jesus #

322
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:54,054
＃先路导我程＃
# Going on before #

323
00:19:54,122 --> 00:19:55,846
＃基督乃是君王＃
# Christ, the royal... #

324
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:56,930
你是否曾有过这种感觉
[Alex]Have you ever had that feeling

325
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,563
头脑里有一个人
that there was someone inside your head,

326
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:01,482
在聆听你的思想？
listening to your thoughts?

327
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,205
我读过一篇关于孪生的文章
I read this article on twinning

328
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:06,122
两个人如何在不同国度间交流
about how two people
can communicate across countries

329
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:07,649
仅仅通过心灵
through the mind.

330
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:10,025
现在，只要想象一下，如果那是真的
Now, just imagine if that were true.

331
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:13,539
你最黑暗的秘密
像无线电波一样漂浮在那里，
Your darkest secrets floating out there like radio waves,

332
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,554
等着被拾起
just waiting to be picked up on.

333
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,339
那个家伙身上有些秘密
There was something about this guy.

334
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:23,360
＃...先路＃
#... Jesus #

335
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:27,811
＃导我程＃
# Going on before #

336
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:32,456
[讲拉丁语]
[speaking Latin]

337
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,393
[回应拉丁语]
[Responding in Latin]

338
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:37,473
坐下
Be seated.

339
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:43,815
现在...
Now...

340
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:47,267
有些男孩引起了我的注意
it's come to my attention that some boys

341
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:48,289
来自，嗯...
from, um...

342
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:49,412
什么？
[whispering]What?

343
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:55,493
你们俩有什么重要的事情要分享吗？
Do you two have something important to contribute?

344
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:58,914
嗯？坎贝尔？福布斯？
Hmm? Campbell? Forbes?

345
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,615
站起来，与我们分享
Stand up and share with us

346
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:03,141
不管怎样，看起来它明显不能等到
whatever it is that obviously can't wait

347
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:04,937
大会之后
until after this assembly.

348
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:06,850
坎贝尔，你的领带
Campbell, do your tie

349
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:07,874
整理好
up properly.

350
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:11,177
怎么样？坎贝尔？
Well? Campbell?

351
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:12,740
没有，先生
Nothing, sir.

352
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:13,894
福布斯？
Forbes?

353
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:16,202
哦，没什么重要的，我想
Oh, nothing important, I suppose.

354
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:20,515
你们俩，大会后到我办公室
Both of you,
outside my office after assembly.

355
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,532
坐下
Be seated.

356
00:21:22,606 --> 00:21:23,588
现在，我注意到
Now, it's come to my attention

357
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:25,767
一些12年级的戏剧社男生
that some of the boys in year-12 drama

358
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:28,653
本学期要表演丁尼生的剧本《贝克特》
will be performing
the Tennyson play Beckett this term,

359
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:29,995
他们在寻找志愿者
and they're looking for volunteers

360
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:32,267
做道具和舞台建设
for props and stage building.

361
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:35,086
你能不能淡定点？
Will you calm down?

362
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:36,777
火车上的人不可能查到我们
Nobody on the train could've possibly
known where we're from.

363
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,024
放轻松，好不？
Will you just relax, please?

364
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:39,622



365
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,916
进来
Inside.

366
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,094
我承认你们的学术成果
I do recognize your academic achievements

367
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,142
你们俩今年都不错
this year, both of you,

368
00:21:51,216 --> 00:21:53,158
但为什么一定要违反规矩呢？
but why do you insist on bucking the system?

369
00:21:53,232 --> 00:21:54,214
嗯？
Hmm?

370
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,156
坐下
Be seated.

371
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:06,415
这之前，我一直
Till recently, I've always been able

372
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,520
靠着你们树立了良好的榜样
to rely on both of you to set a good example.

373
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:10,054
得了吧
[Softly]Come on.

374
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,405
你说什么？
I beg your pardon?

375
00:22:11,472 --> 00:22:12,749
好吧，如果是这样，
Well, if that was the case,

376
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:14,638
我就不会有个怪胎室友了吧？
then I wouldn't be having
a freak in my room, would I?

377
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:17,290
你的大多数同学都是三人一间
Most of your fellow students
have three boys to a room.

378
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:19,947
我不认为你受到不公平对待，福布斯
I don't think you're too hard done by, Forbes.

379
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,391
我的大多数同学都有真正的家
Most of my fellow students have a real home

380
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:23,344
来远离这鬼地方
away from this hellhole.

381
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:28,397
我把你们的名字写下来，去给
I'm putting your names down to help

382
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:30,440
12年级的戏剧帮助
with this year-12 play.

383
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:32,717
哦，不，我没有这个时间做这等屁事
Oh, no. I don't have time for this bullshit.

384
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:36,489
请问你在外面等着吗，坎贝尔？
Would you wait outside, Campbell, please?

385
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,656



386
00:22:47,729 --> 00:22:49,039
这一切又是为什么？
What's all this about?

387
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:51,789
我之前就告诉你我不和别人同住
I told you before I'm not sharing with anyone.

388
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:55,175
奈杰尔・科比是个很不错的年轻人
Nigel Colbie is a brilliant young man.

389
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,909
或许你会发现很荣幸与他相伴
You may find his company rewarding.

390
00:22:56,978 --> 00:22:58,603
比如说？
Like how?

391
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:01,096
比如说？
Like how?

392
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,756
因为合作也是学习的一个重要部分
Because collaboration is
an important part of learning.

393
00:23:03,827 --> 00:23:05,965
我把你和一个年轻人放在一起，相信他会让
I've put you with a young man whom I believe

394
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:08,304
你感受到学术上的挑战
you will find academically challenging.

395
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:09,745
这都是一窍不通的废话
This is such bollocks.

396
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,079
你在拿自己的将来冒险
Your future is what is at stake here.

397
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:17,649
不要忘记你的责任，阿历克斯
Don't lose sight of your obligations, Alex.

398
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:22,251
就这样
That'll be all.

399
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,343
我说，就这样！
I said that will be all!

400
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:44,681


401
00:23:47,732 --> 00:23:48,943
怎么啦？
What happened?

402
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:50,442
你说了什么没？
Did you say anything?

403
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:52,777
怎么样？说了吗？
Well? Did you?

404
00:23:52,853 --> 00:23:53,801
没
No.

405
00:23:54,996 --> 00:23:57,331
你父亲有时候真混蛋
Your father can be such an asshole sometimes.

406
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:04,363


407
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:07,531


408
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:14,349
纵观历史，人们牺牲自己
Throughout history,men have sacrificed themselves

409
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:16,210
为了他们的根本信念
for their fundamental beliefs.

410
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:19,955
或许这样并不明智，尽上帝之力来对抗人类的欲望
It may not be wise to pit the force of God against many human desires,

411
00:24:20,022 --> 00:24:21,931
但是...
but...

412
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,877
你没事吧，西姆斯先生？
Are you all right, Mr. Simms?

413
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:26,029
嗯...
Um...

414
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:27,215
我很好，先生
I'm fine, sir.

415
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:28,366
我只是从椅子上摔下来了，先生
I just fell off my chair, sir.

416
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:29,386


417
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:30,410
嗯
Well.

418
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:31,893
下次小心一点
Be more careful next time.

419
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:32,907
是，先生
Yes, sir.

420
00:24:34,294 --> 00:24:36,530
你们有些人在学习贝克特
Some of you are working on Beckett.

421
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:39,348
谁能讲讲它的主题... 托马斯・贝克特？
Who can tell me about its subject...
Thomas of Beckett?

422
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:40,909
好，韦兰先生？
Yes, Mr. Weyland?

423
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:43,535
托马斯・贝克特是坎特伯雷大主教
Thomas Beckett was the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury

424
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:45,549
12世纪初，先生
in the early 12th century, sir.

425
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:47,346
1170年，他被杀害于
In 1170, he was murdered

426
00:24:47,415 --> 00:24:48,789
自己教堂的高坛前
in front of at the high altar at his cathedral.

427
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,862
没错
Exactly.

428
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:52,757
他知道骑士们要来杀他
He knew that the knights were coming to slay him,

429
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,132
但他选择了等待他们
but he chose to wait for them

430
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,305
在上帝面前
unto the sight of God.

431
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,902
他被谋杀是一种亵渎
His murder was a sacrilegious act

432
00:24:57,975 --> 00:24:59,885
严重亵渎
of gross profanity.

433
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,545
然而，几乎就在他刚死不久
However, almost immediately after his death,

434
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:05,583
就有传言说，他的坟墓会展现出奇迹
there were whispers of miracles being performed at his grave.

435
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:07,761
来自全国各地的信徒
Believers from all over the country

436
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:10,254
日夜兼程的徒步在...
traveled day and night on foot in ord...

437
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:13,901
是的... 福布斯先生？
Yes... Mr. Forbes?

438
00:25:13,976 --> 00:25:15,569
他被害只是政治谋杀
His murder was simply political.

439
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,876
贝克特碍了事，教会就把他撂倒了
Beckett got in the way, so the Church had him put down.

440
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:19,919
信徒福布斯先生来了
Trust Mr. Forbes to come up

441
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:21,880
带着这些有趣的野史
with such an interesting slant on history.

442
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:23,154


443
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:25,166
但是，你不能改变历史
Well, you can't change history.

444
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:27,412
现在，如果你仔细看，你会认识到
Now, if you look at it, you'll see

445
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:28,691
这正像其他暴行一样
it's exactly like all the other atrocities

446
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,616
致力于反对教会的人
committed against the people by the Church.

447
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:33,496
哦，那你究竟是指哪些暴行？
Oh, and exactly what atrocities are you referring to?

448
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:34,706
清教徒
The Cathars.

449
00:25:34,776 --> 00:25:36,631
清教徒？
The Cathars？

450
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:39,085
他们是一群自己制定规则的异教徒
They were a bunch of heathens who created their own rules

451
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:40,950
仅仅为了自己舒服。教会无非是想
to suit themselves. The Church was simply trying to

452
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:42,610
在动荡的土地上保持秩序
retain order in a very volatile land.

453
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:44,372
好吧，那圣殿骑士团呢？
All right, what about the Knight Templars, then?

454
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:47,507
我看不出这跟我们说的有什么关系
I fail to see how this has got anything to do with what we're talking about.

455
00:25:47,577 --> 00:25:49,006
难道不是圣殿骑士团杀了托马斯・贝克特？
Weren't they the knights that killed Thomas Beckett?

456
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,448
- 荒谬！
- 是吗，先生？
- This is ludicrous!  - Sir, is it?

457
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:54,131
先生，那圣殿骑士团
是不是被称为耶稣的骑士？
Sir, weren't the Templars known as the Knights of Christ?

458
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:55,958
难道他们不是教会的走卒？
Weren't they the Church's foot soldiers?

459
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:58,131
- 什么？
- 那么，为什么杀死大主教？
- What? - So why kill the Archbishop?

460
00:25:58,202 --> 00:25:59,446
至少他们有先见之明
At least they had the foresight

461
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,750
预见了圣十字军东征毫无意义
to see the pointlessness of the Holy Crusades.

462
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:03,225
现在，为什么你不告诉我们
Now, why don't you tell the class

463
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,632
耶稣的骑士们如何
how the Knights of Christ


464
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:05,974
抛弃了梵蒂冈
turned their back on the Vatican

465
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:07,569
而接受了清教徒的信仰？
and adopted the Cathars' beliefs?

466
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:08,689
你最好现在停下
This better stop now.

467
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:10,257
摆脱教会，圣殿骑士团掌握主动
Free from the Church,the Templars took control.

468
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,502
他们比梵蒂冈的势力更大
They had more fingers in the pie than the Vatican,

469
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,196
事实上非常大
which is a lot of fingers.

470
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:16,306
- 坐下
- 难道这不正是他们被清剿
- Sit down. - Isn't that why they were hunted down

471
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:17,523
并烧死在火刑柱上？
and burned at the stake?

472
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:20,409
他们背叛了曾经的信仰
They had betrayed their original cause.

473
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:22,996
而那些信仰又是谁的？
And whose cause was that?

474
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,517
滚出我的课堂
Get out of my class.

475
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:29,683
去，出去！
Go on. Get out!

476
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:35,416
可怕的小鬼
Frightful little man.

477
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:43,576


478
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,152
现在你又想证明什么，嗯？
What are you trying to prove now, hmm?

479
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,609
跟唐纳森牧师捣蛋？
Trying to upset the Reverend Donaldson?

480
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:05,431
我想这样你可能会来这
I thought that might get you up here.

481
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,606
阿历克斯，他效忠于上帝
Alex, he's a man of the cloth.

482
00:27:07,677 --> 00:27:09,619
你必须学会对他表示尊重
You must learn to show him some respect.

483
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:11,351
不要
[Snickers]Don't walk

484
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,177
在我跟你说话的走开！
away from me when I'm talking to you!

485
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:17,814
天哪！
Good God!

486
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:19,893
他一直忙于这些事。
He's been busy.

487
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:30,906
而你让我跟他做室友
And you make me share a room with him.

488
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,330
但他很不错
But he was dox

489
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:35,479
去年在圣爱德华学院
at St. Edward's Academy last year.

490
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:37,175
那，为什么让他来这？
So why bring him here?

491
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:39,513
为什么，他的父亲觉得
Why, his father felt

492
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:41,785
在这里他将有更多的学习机会
there would be more opportunities for him here,

493
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:45,018
嗯...远离家里的干扰
um... away from the distractions at home.

494
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:47,508
拥有他我们非常幸运
We're very fortunate to have him.

495
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,175
你很幸运，我不是
You're fortunate, not me.

496
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:52,855
阿历克斯，我千辛万苦
Alex, I have worked extremely hard

497
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:55,195
给你你需要的
to give you what you need.

498
00:27:55,262 --> 00:27:57,651
这个男孩将得到我们的热情款待
This boy will have our hospitality.

499
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:01,015
爸，求你了
Dad, please.

500
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:02,931
求求你
Please.

501
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:07,063
你看，他父亲是非常重要的一员
Look, his father is a very important member

502
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:08,345
- 哦...
- 在我们的社交圈里
- Ohh...  - of our society.

503
00:28:08,415 --> 00:28:09,495
哦，这才像话
Oh, so that's more like it.

504
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:11,509
所以，他是你宝贵的俱乐部成员
So he's part of your precious club.

505
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:12,860
而其他人不收他
And nobody else wanted him,

506
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,870
因此，你做了件很哥们的事儿
and you're doing the brotherly thing.

507
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,504
好吧，我的未来取决于这吗？
Yeah, well, does my future depend on that?

508
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,004
- 够了
- 不，你根本不鸟
- That's enough.
- No. You don't give a fuck

509
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,542
我或者这家伙，你唯一
about me or this guy.The only thing

510
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,339
- 够了！
- 关心的，就是捞收入
- That's enough!
- You care about is the amount accrued

511
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,586
- 从他爹身上
- 我说，够了！
- off his father's head.
- I said enough!

512
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,030
不，这没事，
但不要给我说些
No, which is fine, but just don't give me

513
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:25,503
兄弟情谊的废话
the brotherhood bullshit.

514
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:30,461
这个男孩将受到欢迎
This boy will be made welcome.

515
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:09,371
他一直在研究我们，
好像我们跟那些臭虫收藏品一样
He's been studying us like we're part of his bug collection.

516
00:29:11,522 --> 00:29:12,951
他怎么评价我的？
What's he say about me?

517
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:19,161
伙计们，这很奇怪的好不
我们别看了
This is weird, guys. Let's just leave it alone.

518
00:29:19,234 --> 00:29:20,663
嘿，听听这个
[Chuckles]Hey, listen to this.

519
00:29:20,739 --> 00:29:23,040
“阿历克斯是一个自我中心的自大狂
"Alex is an egocentric megalomaniac

520
00:29:23,107 --> 00:29:24,633
和夸大妄想狂”
with delusions of grandeur."

521
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:26,299
给我
Give me that.

522
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,994
好吧，这个小混蛋需要好好上一课
Okay, this little shit
needs to be taught a lesson.

523
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:34,238
阿历克斯，那家伙是个怪物，我们把书放回去
The guy's a freak, Alex.
Let's put the book back

524
00:29:34,307 --> 00:29:36,860
在他发现之前
before he finds out it's gone.

525
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:39,484
[德语口音]你建议我们做什么，我的主人？？（听不清）
What do you propose we do, mein ??

526
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:41,824
你他妈能不能歇歇气？
Will you give it a fucking rest, please?

527
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:43,233
抱歉
Sorry.

528
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:44,925
不，不，真的很抱歉
No, no. I really am.

529
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:47,932
好吧，我加入
All right, I'm in.

530
00:29:52,164 --> 00:29:53,986
我要离开这里
I'm out of here.

531
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:19,555


532
00:30:54,182 --> 00:30:55,775
你好
Hello.

533
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:59,070
啊！！！
Aaaahhh！


534
00:30:59,142 --> 00:31:00,091
喜欢吗？
Enjoying it?

535
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,181
我听不到你说啥，伙计
I can't hear you, mate.

536
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:03,076
你得说出来
You're gonna have to speak up.

537
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:07,073
你他妈的爽不？
Are you fucking enjoying it?


538
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:09,697
谁能不激动呢？
Isn't it a fucking rush?

539
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:12,768


540
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:18,046
噢，糟糕！
Oh, crap!

541
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,126
闪开！
Get out of the way!

542
00:31:25,447 --> 00:31:27,334
你以为你他妈的能去哪儿？
So, where the fuck do you think you're going?

543
00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:33,863
- 你这个混蛋
- 够了！让他走
- You're a little shit. - That's enough! Let him go.

544
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:35,521
- 你必须学会尊重...
- 住手！
- You've got to learn to respect...
- Stop it!

545
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:37,348
不，他要学会尊重权威
No, he's gonna learn to respect authority.

546
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:40,133
你已经表达得很清楚了！让他走！天啊！
You made your point!Let him go! Christ!

547
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,956
阿历克斯！呀！
Alex! Uhh!

548
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,469


549
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:08,703
他的双眼
His eyes.

550
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,752
有种让人恐惧的东西
There was this terror in his eyes.

551
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,660
如果我有罪
If I am guilty,

552
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,185
那就是让奈杰尔靠得太近
then it's for letting Nigel get too close.

553
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:40,575


554
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:47,882


555
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,618


556
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:58,463


557
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:30,312
- 我能帮什么忙吗？
- 噢！
- Can I be of any assistance?
- Oh!

558
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:32,715
不，谢谢，只是，嗯...
No, thanks. It's just the, uh...

559
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,860
转轴钮而已
the rotor button.

560
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:36,105
好吧，那我先走了
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

561
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:37,121
不，等等
No, wait.

562
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:38,342
我们还没有正式的自我介绍过
We haven't been properly introduced.

563
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:39,428
我是莎莉・罗
I'm Sally Rowe.

564
00:33:41,965 --> 00:33:44,715
我从我爸那继承了
对难搞的车的热情
I inherited a passion for difficult cars from my dad.

565
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:49,639
对不起，您... 您是阿历克斯的父亲？
Sorry, you... You're Alex's father, aren't you?

566
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,716
我觉得这不是合适的时间地点，罗小姐
I don't think this is the time or the place, Miss Rowe.

567
00:33:51,789 --> 00:33:54,342
所以，请原谅，你还是通过学校来联系我
So, if you'll excuse me.
You can contact me through the school.

568
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:56,835
嗯，我已经跟您的秘书谈过了
Well, I've already spoken with your secretary.

569
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,917
我觉得很了不起，在这种情况下
I find it remarkable that, under the circumstances,

570
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,997
您竟然挤不出时间跟我聊一聊
you can't find the time to speak with me.

571
00:34:05,646 --> 00:34:08,101
那有何贵干，罗小姐？
What is it that you want, Miss Rowe?

572
00:34:08,174 --> 00:34:11,338
我想谈谈阿历克斯的情况，
和您还有您的妻子
I want to discuss Alex's situation
with you and your wife.

573
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:16,683
阿历克斯的母亲已经去世了
Alex's mother died

574
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,895
很久以前
a long time ago.

575
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:20,105
哦，抱歉，我不知道
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

576
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:23,687
阿历克斯的教养已经无可挑剔
Alex's upbringing has been impeccable.

577
00:34:23,758 --> 00:34:24,903
我的儿子达到了一项最高的
My son has one of the highest

578
00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:27,309
国家学业成绩
academic records in the country.

579
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:31,626
像阿历克斯这样的男孩，他们的能力需要...
Boys of Alex's ability need...

580
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,353
严律教导
regimented discipline.

581
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:37,163
我们不容许任何会导致分心的可能
We don't allow any distraction which might lead

582
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:40,298
让这些孩子偏离他们的真正潜能
these boys away from their true potential.

583
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:42,506
那瞧瞧他现在呆在哪
And look where he is now.

584
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,201


585
00:34:44,272 --> 00:34:45,581
你们这些人为什么就不能帮帮阿历克斯
Why can't you people help Alex

586
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:46,956
而不是试图给他定罪于
instead of trying to convict him

587
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:49,741
那些他没做过的事情，看在老天的份上？
of something he didn't do,
for the love of Christ?

588
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:51,880
他亲眼目睹了自己最好的朋友去世
He witnessed the death of his best friend,

589
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:53,447
现在有个男孩...
and now this boy...

590
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:55,854
在他面前打爆了自己的头
blows his head off in front of him.

591
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,902
他经历的还不够吗？
Hasn't he been through enough?

592
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:59,431
我是想帮您的儿子，福布斯博士
I am trying to help your son, Dr. Forbes.

593
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:05,581
我爱我儿子...
I love my son...

594
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,481
...我将百分百去确保
...and I'm gonna make very sure

595
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:13,197
你们这些人
让他遭受的屈辱将公之于众
that the humiliation you people have subjected him to is made public.

596
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,510
几乎每一个个案都可归属于
In almost every single case attributed

597
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:24,715
格式塔心理学
to gestalt psychology,

598
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:28,976
精神病患者和长辈的关系都很混乱
the psychopath's relationship
with parental figures has been troubled.

599
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,535
破碎的家庭，
Broken homes,

600
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:32,911
生理和心理上的虐待，
mental and physical abuse,

601
00:35:32,978 --> 00:35:35,214
被遗弃或父母一方死亡
abandonment by or death of a parent.

602
00:35:35,282 --> 00:35:38,795
都可以是精神病患者形成的影响因素
All can be influential factors
on the psychopath's makeup.

603
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,533


604
00:35:56,882 --> 00:35:58,704
和平礼物
Peace offering.

605
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,047
你的最爱
Your favorite.

606
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:01,424
昂贵
Expensive.

607
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,313
嗯...
Uh...

608
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:04,972
我是来向你道歉的
I came to apologize.

609
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:07,694
我确实很忙
I'm actually busy.

610
00:36:07,763 --> 00:36:09,835
我很抱歉，好吗？
I'm sorry. Okay?

611
00:36:11,347 --> 00:36:12,721
我知道我不应该打那娃
I know I shouldn't have hit the kid.

612
00:36:12,787 --> 00:36:16,268
真他妈的做了件愚事
It was a really fucking stupid thing to do.

613
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:17,549
淡定，马丁
No, relax, Martin.

614
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:19,114
我不会上报的
I'm not gonna make a report.

615
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:21,260
太好了
Cheers.

616
00:36:21,332 --> 00:36:22,958
顺便问一下，你知道那些孩子跟
By the way, do you know
what those kids were up to

617
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:24,337
那晚乔希・坎贝尔的被害有什么联系吗？
the night Josh Campbell was killed?

618
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:26,346
- 火车男孩？
- 是啊
- The train kid? - Yeah.

619
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,656
另一个阿历克斯的死去的好友
Another one of Alex's dead best friends.

620
00:36:28,724 --> 00:36:31,790
验尸官说是个意外，不是吗？
The coroner said it was an accident, didn't he?

621
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,616
怎么？那小坏蛋跟你说了什么？
Why? What's the little shit telling you?

622
00:36:33,684 --> 00:36:35,789
你到底想不想合作？
Do you want to work together on this or not?

623
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,315
- 嗯，它跟奈杰尔的死有神马关系？
- 关系？
- Well, how's it related to Nigel's murder? - How?

624
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:39,915
所有他经历过的都与之相关
Everything he's been through is related.

625
00:36:39,988 --> 00:36:41,297
- 你懂得
- 我简直不敢相信
- You know that. - I cannot believe

626
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:44,398
你竟然买他的帐
you're falling for his bullshit.

627
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,764
他正在试图摆脱掉你的怀疑，萨尔
He's trying to throw you off the scent, Sal.


628
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:49,105
我想跟科比一家谈谈
I want to talk to the Colbies

629
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,344
给奈杰尔做个侧写
and work up a profile on Nigel.

630
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:53,485
- 哦，那很棘手
- 点解？
- Well, that's gonna be tricky. - And why is that?

631
00:36:53,557 --> 00:36:55,444
因为我们找不到他们
Because we can't find them.

632
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:58,351


633
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:22,799


634
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,859
奈杰尔被换到其他房间
Nigel was moved to another room.

635
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,731
奇怪的是，我竟然有点想念他
It was strange.
I almost missed him.

636
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:23,383
“突然间，她抱起他的头
"With a sudden movement, she bowed his head


637
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:25,336
“和他唇对着唇
"and joined her lips to his.

638
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,059
“他读懂了她的暗示
"And he read the meaning of her movements

639
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:30,806
“从她惊恐的，抬起的双眼里
"in her frightened, uplifted eyes.

640
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:32,083
无法承受之重"
It was too much for him."

641
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:33,430
我们保持距离
We kept our distance.

642
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:34,741
“将自己臣服在她身前...”
"Surrendering himself to her body..."

643
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:38,104
但我觉得我的思想不再属于自己
But I felt that my thoughts were no longer my own.


644
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:42,446
“...她柔软炙热的双唇间那黑暗的压力
"...the dark pressure of her soft, hot lips.

645
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:45,074
- 他们压在他的...”
- 我多沉迷一点
- They pressed upon his..."
- The further I sank,

646
00:38:45,145 --> 00:38:46,967
他就更强一些
the stronger he became.

647
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,652
就好像他接管了我的灵魂
It was like he had taken my soul.

648
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:51,827


649
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,775
我开始为学校的戏剧搭布景
I started work on the set building
for the school play.

650
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,981
几乎让我不去想乔希的死亡
That mostly kept my mind off Josh's death.

651
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:23,604


652
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:34,232
是的，我是
So, I do.

653
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,405
路易九世深爱着我
Louis of France loved me.


654
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:39,226
我幻想自己爱着路易九世
And I dreamed that I loved Louis of France.

655
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:41,463
而我深爱英王亨利
And I loved Henry of England.

656
00:39:41,531 --> 00:39:44,314
英王亨利幻想自己爱着我
And Henry of England dreamed that he loved me.

657
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,828


658
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,609
...在婚后第一吻的呼吸中腐蚀
...rusts at the breath
of the first after-marriage kiss.

659
00:39:51,676 --> 00:39:53,946
我嘲笑这可笑世界中的自己...
I could laugh at this poor world myself...

660
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:02,681
对于你的朋友，我真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry about your friend.

661
00:40:04,797 --> 00:40:06,902
滚开，怪胎
Fuck off, freak.

662
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:08,402
但你不必担心
But you don't have to worry.

663
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,609
他现在很安详
He's at peace now.

664
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:16,023
满月是去收获成熟
The harvest moon is the ripening of the harvest.

665
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:17,554
而蜜月是爱的终点
And the honeymoon is the goal of love.

666
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:19,964
他死于他的...
He dies of his...

667
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,139
你喜欢它吗？
Does it please you?

668
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:28,378
拿去吧
Take it.

669
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:30,584
这女孩真不错，不是吗？
Girl's really something, isn't she?

670
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:36,021
那最后的离别之箭
The last parting shaft

671
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:38,004
被绝望的丘比特射向国王的左心房
of a forlorn cupid on the king's left breast.


672
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:39,987


673
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:57,045


674
00:41:32,704 --> 00:41:34,231


675
00:41:38,689 --> 00:41:40,794
我返回房间时，那只手不见了
And then when I got back, the hand was gone.

676
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,167
你告诉其他人了吗？
Did you tell anyone?

677
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,022
我能跟谁讲？
Who was I gonna tell?

678
00:41:46,497 --> 00:41:48,635
那你为什么认为那是乔希的手？
And why do you think it was Josh's hand?

679
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:52,221
我不知道，我又没仔细研究它
I don't know. I didn't exactly study it.

680
00:41:54,466 --> 00:41:56,375
他无处不在
He was everywhere.

681
00:41:57,505 --> 00:41:59,131
无处不在
Everywhere.

682
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:01,598
我想说的是
Look, all I'm saying is that

683
00:42:01,665 --> 00:42:03,324
奈杰尔可以很轻易拿走它
Nigel could have quite easily taken it.

684
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,345
那你现在如何看待奈杰尔？
And how do you feel about Nigel now?

685
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:11,232
他得到了他应有的报应
That he got what he deserved.

686
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:18,077
我怎么知道你说的是实话？
How do I know you're telling the truth?

687
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:21,114
你不知道
You don't.

688
00:42:23,523 --> 00:42:25,279


689
00:42:36,163 --> 00:42:37,723
你滚出我的房间
You get out of my room.

690
00:42:37,795 --> 00:42:39,137
- 你的论文写完了吗？
- 滚出去
- Have you finished your essay? - Get out.

691
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,583
看起来你需要帮忙
It looks like you need a hand.

692
00:42:43,651 --> 00:42:44,862
滚出去！
Get out!

693
00:42:47,172 --> 00:42:48,928
您可能会发现这些很有帮助
You might find these helpful.

694
00:42:59,428 --> 00:43:00,410
他是怎么知道
How did he know

695
00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:02,110
我在挣扎着写论文的？
I was struggling with my essay?

696
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:05,247
他怎么知道我的论题？
How did he know my topic?

697
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,421
我是说，他有所有问题的答案
I mean, he had answers to questions

698
00:43:07,492 --> 00:43:09,248
而我甚至还没想到
I hadn't even thought of yet.

699
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:12,474
但是，学习时间只剩下一个小时
But with only an hour left of study time,

700
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,207
我知道我没有别的选择
I knew I didn't have a choice.

701
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:18,109
这感觉就像在出卖自己的灵魂
It was like selling my soul.

702
00:43:20,676 --> 00:43:24,354
普尔，垃圾 西姆斯，垃圾
Poole, rubbish. Sims, rubbish.

703
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:27,745
- 有进步
- 谢谢，先生
- Better.  - Thank you, sir.

704
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:29,882
这是向
Well, this is a step

705
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:31,103
正确方面迈出的一步，林登先生
in the right direction, Mr. Linden.

706
00:43:31,174 --> 00:43:32,548
干得好
Well done.

707
00:43:35,014 --> 00:43:36,258
出色的工作，福布斯
Excellent work, Mr. Forbes.

708
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,418
我甚至都有点担心你了，小伙子
I was beginning to worry about you, lad.

709
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:46,240
我觉得一文不值
I felt worthless.

710
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:10,846
阿历克斯
Alex.

711
00:44:12,007 --> 00:44:12,990
阿历克斯，醒醒
Alex, wake up.

712
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:16,861
我晚上有个计划
I've got a night planned.

713
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:22,272
你在这作甚？
What are you doing here?

714
00:44:22,343 --> 00:44:23,969
我想给你看点东西
I want to show you something.

715
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:26,950
没兴趣
I'm not interested.

716
00:44:33,608 --> 00:44:35,680
别忘了我帮过你
Don't forget I helped you.

717
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:38,786
来吧，会很有趣
Come on. It'll be fun.

718
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:39,936
来吧
Come.

719
00:44:49,897 --> 00:44:51,424
我们快到了
We're nearly there.

720
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:55,679
你开心吗？
Are you having fun?

721
00:44:58,344 --> 00:44:59,871
哦，得了，亚历克斯，你大老远跑过来
Oh, come on, Alex,
you've come all this way.

722
00:44:59,945 --> 00:45:01,156
说些什么吧
Say something.

723
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:07,554
好吧
Fine.

724
00:45:23,626 --> 00:45:24,836
这是你家？
Is this your house?

725
00:45:26,218 --> 00:45:27,167
你父母在哪儿？
Where are your parents?

726
00:45:27,243 --> 00:45:29,763
他们可能离开了
They're probably away.

727
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,394
他们到处跑
They travel a lot.

728
00:45:55,595 --> 00:45:57,766


729
00:45:57,835 --> 00:45:59,079
嘿，路德
Hey. Luther.

730
00:46:02,156 --> 00:46:04,131
嘿，嘿，嘿
Hey, hey, hey.


731
00:46:04,204 --> 00:46:05,447
你的狗？
Is he yours?

732
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:06,760
邻居家的
He's next-door's.

733
00:46:06,828 --> 00:46:08,453
他很漂亮，不是吗？
He's beautiful, isn't he?

734
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,129


735
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:14,376


736
00:46:14,444 --> 00:46:15,905
他不喜欢你
He doesn't like you.

737
00:46:18,252 --> 00:46:20,041
我从来没有带任何人来过这里
I've never brought anybody here before.

738
00:46:21,164 --> 00:46:22,724
你是第一个
You're the first.

739
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:24,487
好吗？
Okay?

740
00:46:24,556 --> 00:46:25,898
第一个
The first.

741
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:32,385
来吧
Come on.

742
00:46:51,437 --> 00:46:53,347


743
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:55,364
嘘！
Shhh!

744
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:56,452
谁？

745
00:46:56,526 --> 00:46:57,606
关掉电筒 关掉电筒

746
00:46:57,678 --> 00:46:58,987


747
00:46:59,054 --> 00:47:00,396
我以为你说他们走了
I thought you said they were away.

748
00:47:00,462 --> 00:47:02,437


749
00:47:05,678 --> 00:47:07,085
他有枪
He's got the gun.

750
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:13,094


751
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,475


752
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,079
滚回去，傻X狗！
Go home, stupid dogs!

753
00:47:19,151 --> 00:47:20,296


754
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:21,480


755
00:47:21,551 --> 00:47:23,972


756
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,374
我要离开这里
I'm getting out of here.

757
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,170
等一下 等一下 等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

758
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:33,385
过来，给你看点东西
Come here. I want to show you something.

759
00:47:33,456 --> 00:47:35,049
就在这
It's just through here.

760
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,701
来吧
Come on.

761
00:47:54,992 --> 00:47:56,006
来吧
Come on.

762
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:09,637
到这里来
Come here.

763
00:48:12,241 --> 00:48:13,288
噢，我的上帝
Oh, my God.

764
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:22,058
你喜欢吗？
You like it?

765
00:48:29,682 --> 00:48:31,722
如果你是专家，告诉我这旗子的来历
If you're the expert, tell me the history of the flag.

766
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:34,128
{\a6\fs12\fn黑体}（铁钩船长和隆・约恩・西尔弗都是虚构的海盗头）

766
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:34,128
什么意思？铁钩船长和隆・约恩・西尔弗？
What do you mean?Captain Hook and Long John Silver?

767
00:48:35,634 --> 00:48:37,838
你对自己身边的事了解得真少
Know so little about the things that are closest to you.

768
00:48:37,906 --> 00:48:41,037
- 这是个谜语吗？
- 不
- Is that supposed to be a riddle? - No.

769
00:48:41,106 --> 00:48:42,251
这是关于你
It's about you.

770
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:43,784
你的未来
Your future.

771
00:48:46,962 --> 00:48:48,239
你知道我父亲是谁吗？
Do you know who my father is?

772
00:48:51,186 --> 00:48:53,291
- 他是你父亲规则下的大师
- 是吗？
- He's grandmaster of your father's order. - Yeah?

773
00:48:53,362 --> 00:48:54,889
那又怎样？
And so what?

774
00:48:56,499 --> 00:48:57,742
是啊
Yeah.

775
00:48:57,811 --> 00:49:00,298
现在那只不过是幼稚的男性团体而已
It's nothing more than puerile male-bonding now.

776
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:01,516
但它曾经很重要
But it was once something.

777
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:04,075
我的意思是，真的很重要
都是些伟大的人，
I mean, really something. These were great men,

778
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:06,930
那些曾经效力于国王的人
men who kings knelt before.

779
00:49:09,843 --> 00:49:11,436
他们迷了路
They lost their way.

780
00:49:14,356 --> 00:49:16,657
得靠我们来接过这旗子
It's up to us to take on that mantle.

781
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:19,507
阿历克斯
Alex.

782
00:49:20,947 --> 00:49:22,125
我们是选中之人
We've been chosen.

783
00:49:22,196 --> 00:49:24,531
我们被选中做什么，奈杰尔？
What have we been chosen for, Nigel?

784
00:49:29,781 --> 00:49:30,893
这
This.

785
00:49:30,964 --> 00:49:32,011
什么？
What?

786
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:35,661
你知道扑克牌最早什么时候出现？
Do you know when playing cards first appeared?

787
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,011
12世纪
The 12th century.

788
00:49:41,268 --> 00:49:42,610
那是兄弟会真正的开始
And that was the start of the real brotherhood.

789
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:44,237
我是说，想象它会是什么样子
I mean, imagine what it must have been like.

790
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:46,578
那些... 圣地的遗失
The... The loss of the Holy Land,

791
00:49:46,645 --> 00:49:49,296
圣殿骑士放弃教会...
the Templars abandoning the Church...

792
00:49:49,365 --> 00:49:50,445
贝克特之死
the death of Beckett.

793
00:49:50,517 --> 00:49:53,997
还有从中而来的简单的逻辑游戏
And out of it comes a simple, logical game.

794
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:55,280
我的意思是，这只是一个游戏
I mean, it's just a game,

795
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,324
但是它...
but it's...

796
00:49:57,397 --> 00:49:58,892
它是与...
it's a game born with...

797
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,591
不公正，苦难，
injustice, hardship,

798
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:01,610
痛苦...
suffering...

799
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,304
死亡共生的游戏
Death.

800
00:50:06,325 --> 00:50:08,529
那，是个真正值得敬仰的年代
Now, that is truly an age to revere.

801
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:10,485
你魔障了
You're fucked.

802
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,306
你不能否认这牌见证过的事实和
You can't deny the truths that this card has seen

803
00:50:12,374 --> 00:50:15,342
真理，我们可以再次展现它
and the truths we can show it again.

804
00:50:15,414 --> 00:50:17,519
那么，我为什么在这里，奈杰尔？
So, why am I here, Nigel?

805
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:28,783
- 找找“杰克”。
- 你说什么？
- Look up "Jack." - Sorry?

806
00:50:28,854 --> 00:50:30,065
看看“杰克”。
Look up "Jack."

807
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:48,342
上面写着“恶棍”，不是吗？
It says "knave," doesn't it?

808
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:53,263
你知道恶棍是什么吧？
Do you know what a knave is?

809
00:50:53,336 --> 00:50:55,540
当然
Yes.

810
00:50:55,608 --> 00:50:57,495
无原则的人
Unprincipled man.

811
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,926
盗贼
Rogue.

812
00:50:59,992 --> 00:51:01,748
这就是你，阿历克斯
That's what you are, Alex.

813
00:51:04,024 --> 00:51:05,398
你知道这是什么？
Do you know what this is?

814
00:51:05,464 --> 00:51:07,090
这是个黑桃 （双关义“铁锹”）
It's a spade.

815
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,127
黑桃表示长枪头
Spade represents a tip of a pike.

816
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,694
你知道长枪是什么吧？
Do you know what a pike is?

817
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,135
- 它是矛的一种
- 嗯
- It's a kind of spear. - Mmm.

818
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,143
一个杀戮的工具
An implement for killing.

819
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,064
那是我
That's what I am.

820
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:23,380
这是我们的时代... 杰克
This is our time... Jack.

821
00:51:24,505 --> 00:51:26,894
我们冥冥之中的相聚...
We've been brought together for a reason...

822
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:29,808
...早已被记载下来
...and it's written here.

823
00:51:32,154 --> 00:51:33,430
为了永恒
For eternity.

824
00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:39,185
谢谢，先生们，今天就到这
Thank you, gentlemen. That's all for today.

825
00:51:39,257 --> 00:51:40,784
《怪异故事集》
Tales of Mystery and lmagination

826
00:51:40,857 --> 00:51:42,134
埃德加・爱伦・坡 著
by Edgar Allen Poe.

827
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:45,301
希望你们都去看看，下周的要讲，谢谢
I want it read for next week. Thank you.

828
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,665
普尔先生，我希望你能更努力一点
Mr. Poole, I want better work from you, as well.

829
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:53,017
- 先生，我能问你一个问题吗？ - 当然可以
- Sir, can I ask you a question?
- Certainly.

830
00:51:53,082 --> 00:51:55,351
但能不能回答是另一个问题
Whether or not I can answer it
is another question.

831
00:51:55,418 --> 00:52:00,055
你认为进入人们的心灵可能吗？
Do you think it's possible
to get inside people's minds?

832
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:02,227
我只需要知道
你认为客观上可不可能
I just need to know whether you think
objectively that's possible.

833
00:52:02,298 --> 00:52:03,444
- 客观来讲  - 是啊
- Objectively.
- Yeah.

834
00:52:03,515 --> 00:52:05,271
我亲爱的孩子
My dear boy,

835
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,379
心灵的力量无边无际
the power of the mind has no boundaries.

836
00:52:08,891 --> 00:52:10,996
了解它能尽之事就像...
Understanding its capabilities is like...

837
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:14,296
就像是，探索宇宙的尽头
is like searching for the end of the universe.

838
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,501
或者，试图追溯时间的起源
Or trying to find the beginning of time.

839
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:21,979
好的
Okay.

840
00:52:22,043 --> 00:52:23,221
谢谢
Thank you.

841
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:42,710
嘿，对不...苏珊，对不起
Hey, Sor... Susan. Sorry.

842
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,438
你好，我..我只是...我只是想说
Hi. L... I just... I just wanted to say

843
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:46,003
我觉得你真的非常了不起
that I thought you were absolutely fantastic.

844
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:48,244
谢谢
Thanks.

845
00:52:48,316 --> 00:52:50,072
快点，苏，不然我们就赶不上公共汽车了
Come on, Sue, or we'll miss the bus.

846
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:51,701
抱歉，我得走了。
Sorry. I've got to go.

847
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:53,147
不，你能稍等一会吗？
No. Will you hang on for one second?

848
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:54,456
抱歉
Sorry.

849
00:52:54,524 --> 00:52:57,208
你先走，我会赶上来
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

850
00:52:57,277 --> 00:52:58,225
嗯...
Um...

851
00:52:59,324 --> 00:53:00,273
我不是很擅长这种事
I'm not particularly good at this.

852
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:03,251
我是...我只是...我想知道是否可能
I was... I was just...
I was wondering if maybe

853
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:06,292
你愿意，那个，放学后出去转转或者什么的
you wanted to, you know, hook up
or something after school sometime.

854
00:53:07,261 --> 00:53:08,275
我是说，完全...
I mean, it's completely...

855
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:09,560
完全没关系，如果你不愿意的话
It's completely fine if you don't.

856
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:10,874
这只是... 这是...
It was just... It was...

857
00:53:10,942 --> 00:53:12,349
当然，好的
Yeah. Okay.

858
00:53:13,629 --> 00:53:14,578
酷
Cool.

859
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:15,602
嗯，什么时候？
Um, when?

860
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,547
老阿斯特拉在放一些希区柯克的经典作品
They're running some Hitchcock classics
at the old Astra.

861
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:21,469
我想今天是《火车上的陌生人》
I think tonight it's Strangers on a Train.

862
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:22,482
哦，那是什么时候？
Oh, what time is that?

863
00:53:22,558 --> 00:53:24,446
我们7:30左右到那
We're getting there about 7:30.

864
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,525
“我们”？
"We"?

865
00:53:26,686 --> 00:53:29,239
哦，好吧，如果你不喜欢和我的朋友一起...
Oh, well, if you prefer
not to go with my friends...

866
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:30,357
- 不
- 那也没关系
- No. - That's all right.

867
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,797
不，不，不，那...那...那会...
No, no, no, that...
that... that would be...

868
00:53:32,862 --> 00:53:34,553
那会很好，很棒
That would be awesome. That would be great.

869
00:53:34,622 --> 00:53:36,532
那，到那见
So, I'll see you there, then.

870
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:38,516
好，一定会
Yeah, you bet.

871
00:53:52,735 --> 00:53:54,677
国王的叛徒在这
Here goes the triple traitor to the king.

872
00:53:55,647 --> 00:53:56,924


873
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:00,535
你觉得她是处女吗？
Do you think she's still a virgin?

874
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:01,556
你为什么不滚远点
Why don't you fuck off.

875
00:54:01,631 --> 00:54:03,387
哦...
Ohh...

00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:04,404
杰克
Jack.

877
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:07,644
汝深爱之女
Thou lovest the wench.

878
00:54:11,327 --> 00:54:13,083
我有东西给你
I've got something for you.

879
00:54:14,528 --> 00:54:16,699
我的名字是阿历克斯
My name is Alex.

880
00:54:16,768 --> 00:54:18,623
还有，你能离我远点吗？
And will you stay away from me, please?

881
00:54:27,872 --> 00:54:29,782


882
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,160
我已经吃完了，先生，请问我能离开吗？
I've finished, sir. Can I go, please?

883
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:45,814
校长？
Headmaster?

884
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,624
不，他可以等到晚餐结束
No. He can wait until dinner is over.

885
00:54:49,697 --> 00:54:50,712
但我..我得...
But l... I'm meant to be...

886
00:54:52,546 --> 00:54:53,626
求您
Please.

887
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,606
求求您了
Please.

888
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:19,134
我能买张票吗？
Can I get a ticket, please?

889
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,809


890
00:56:03,108 --> 00:56:05,443


891
00:56:16,613 --> 00:56:17,628


892
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:45,090
不用那么多，好了，够了
Not so much. Fine. That's enough.

893
00:56:45,158 --> 00:56:46,784
停
Stop.

894
00:56:46,854 --> 00:56:48,228
嗯
Hmm.

895
00:56:48,294 --> 00:56:49,821
那刀是做什么的？
What's with the knife?

896
00:56:49,894 --> 00:56:51,323
我不知道你在说些什么，杰克
I don't know what you're talking about, Jack.

897
00:56:51,399 --> 00:56:53,188
你我他妈能别再进我的房间吗，请问？
Will you stay out of my fucking room, please?

898
00:56:53,255 --> 00:56:55,743
嗯，你读过我的书没？
Mmm. Have you read my book?

899
00:56:55,814 --> 00:56:57,189
不，我没看你内本狗屁书
No, I haven't read your fucking book.

900
00:56:58,374 --> 00:56:59,651
你应该看看
You should.

901
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:46,462


902
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:08,712


903
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:10,184


904
00:58:11,786 --> 00:58:13,477
孩子们，
Boys,

905
00:58:13,546 --> 00:58:17,092
工作人员们...
members of staff...

906
00:58:17,162 --> 00:58:20,162
我得报告一些非常不幸的消息。
I have some very unfortunate news to report.

907
00:58:21,354 --> 00:58:23,209
今天一大早，
Early this morning,

苏珊米勒，Sansley学院的一位年轻女士
Susan Mueller, a young lady
from Sansley College,

909
00:58:28,555 --> 00:58:32,068
曾参与我们的毕业戏剧，
who was working with us on our final year play,


910
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:34,724
发现...被害了
was found... murdered.

911
00:58:35,691 --> 00:58:37,731
离这儿不远。
Not far from here.

912
00:58:38,955 --> 00:58:40,930
警方相信
The police believe

913
00:58:41,003 --> 00:58:44,897
这种邪恶的行为
that this vile act

914
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:47,427
发生在
took place

915
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:49,442
她结束排练后回家的路上
while she was on her way home from rehearsal

916
00:58:49,515 --> 00:58:51,523
在昨晚
last night.

917
00:58:51,596 --> 00:58:54,629
恐怕所有演员及工作人员
So I'm afraid that all members of the cast and crew

918
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:57,154
在会后都得留下来
will remain behind after assembly,

919
00:58:57,227 --> 00:58:59,911
看看是否有谁可能见过
together with anyone who may have seen

920
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,598
或和苏珊交谈过
or spoken with Susan

921
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:05,418
在昨天下午
during the course of yesterday afternoon.

922
00:59:07,308 --> 00:59:09,163
散会
That'll be all.

923
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:26,216


924
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:32,296
拉吉，拉吉，你看到奈杰尔没？
Raj. Raj.Have you seen Nigel?

925
00:59:33,421 --> 00:59:34,370
没
No.

926
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:48,557


927
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:58,571
注意
Pay attention.

928
00:59:58,638 --> 01:00:01,704
我的名字是探长麦肯齐
My name is Detective Inspector McKenzie.

929
01:00:01,774 --> 01:00:04,938
我想和你们每个人单独谈谈
I'd like to talk to all of you individually, please.

930
01:00:05,007 --> 01:00:08,302
所以，请向这位默里警员报上你们的姓名
So could you give your names to Constable Murray here.

931
01:00:08,366 --> 01:00:11,366
嗯，我们会尽快完成这件事
Uh, we're gonna try and get through this as quickly as possible,

932
01:00:11,439 --> 01:00:13,294
但请耐心等待
but please be patient.

933
01:00:29,776 --> 01:00:31,205
- 你看到过她了吗？
- 是的
- Did you see her? - Yes.

934
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,735
什么时候？

01:00:33,808 --> 01:00:35,783
大概在中午
Around noon.

936
01:00:35,855 --> 01:00:38,725
她那时在哪儿？

937
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,458
经过走廊
Passing by in the corridor.

938
01:00:40,528 --> 01:00:41,935
哪条走廊？
Which corridor?

01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,335
- 西面那条
- 就是这些？

940
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,375
- 是的

942

阿历克斯・福布斯

01:01:11,857 --> 01:01:14,313
- 你跟苏珊昨天说过话吗？
- 是的

944
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:17,222
什么时间？

945
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:19,914
我不记得
I can't remember.

946
01:01:19,986 --> 01:01:21,327
试试
Try.

947
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:27,409
大概5点左右
It was about 5.

948
01:01:27,474 --> 01:01:29,362
我只是在整理东西，所以...
I was just packing up, so...

949
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,421
你们都谈了什么？
What did you talk about?

950
01:01:34,994 --> 01:01:37,133
我觉得她真的很不错，所以我告诉她，她很不错
I thought that she was really good,
so I told her that she was really good.

951
01:01:37,202 --> 01:01:40,202
- 很不错？
- 戏剧方面
- Really good? - In the play.

952
01:01:40,274 --> 01:01:42,892
她戏剧真的演得很棒，先生
She was really good in the play, sir.

953
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:44,939
还有什么？
What else?

954
01:01:46,802 --> 01:01:48,112
就是这样
That was it.

955
01:01:49,778 --> 01:01:50,891
就这样？
That's it?

956
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:53,579
我想就是这样
I think that was it.

957
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:56,625
有点奇怪
That's weird.

958
01:01:59,475 --> 01:02:02,322
我这里有资料证明，你跟她约过见面
I have here that you were due to meet her

959
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:04,297
大约7:30在阿斯特拉
at about 7:30 at the Astra.

960
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:09,870
因为，根据她的朋友们说，她对你有点意思
Because, according to her friends she kind of fancied you.

961
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,435
你怎么看？
What do you think about that?

962
01:02:19,604 --> 01:02:21,971
嗯...
Well...

963
01:02:24,052 --> 01:02:26,321
看来你们俩都错过了这部电影
Looks like you both missed the film.

964
01:02:26,388 --> 01:02:28,396


965
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:45,609
好玩吗？
Was that fun?

966
01:02:45,685 --> 01:02:47,540
你用那把刀做了什么？
What'd you do with the knife?

967
01:02:47,605 --> 01:02:49,874
哦，我感到些敌意
Ooh. I sense some hostility.

968
01:02:49,942 --> 01:02:51,949
哦，你觉得呢？
Oh, do you reckon?

969
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:54,891
让我们叫它指纹保险吧
Let's just call it fingerprint insurance.

970
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:58,642
我要迟到了，你觉得我应该告诉他们吗？
I'm gonna be late. Do you think I should tell them?

971
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:02,354
我的意思是，你是最后一个看见她的人，杰克
I mean, you were the last person to see her, Jack.

972
01:03:02,422 --> 01:03:03,983
那可怜的，美丽的少女
That poor, fair maiden.

973
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,187
我简直不敢相信发生了什么
I can't believe what's happened.

974
01:03:08,662 --> 01:03:09,906
你做的，不是吗？
You did it, didn't you?

975
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:14,286
不，杰克，你做的
No, Jack. You did it.

976
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:22,163
你怎么能这样做？就这么杀了她
How could you do this? Fucking killed her.

977
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:27,092
发泄怒火感觉很棒吧，杰克？
Feels good to vent one's anger, doesn't it, Jack?

978
01:03:32,247 --> 01:03:34,548
我不希望参与这事
I don't want any part of this.

979
01:03:34,616 --> 01:03:36,274
你能不能别他妈的叫我杰克？
Will you stop fucking calling me Jack?

980
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:40,401
嗯，我很抱歉，杰克，
但你是那个跑到我脑海里的人
Well, I'm sorry, Jack, but you were
the one who got inside my head.

981
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:42,803
那就滚出去
Well, get out of mine.

982
01:03:42,871 --> 01:03:44,759
为时已晚
It's too late for that.

983
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:46,318
对很多事都太晚了
It's too late for a lot of things.

984
01:03:46,391 --> 01:03:50,647
我的意思是，在相识之前，
我们不能达到自己的真正潜能
I mean, before we met, we were incapable
of reaching our true potentials,

985
01:03:50,712 --> 01:03:55,382
但是... 但现在... 我知道你感觉得到
but... but now... I know you feel it.

986
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,793
它简直太畅快了
It's so invigorating.

987
01:04:02,744 --> 01:04:06,061
我们简直合作无间
We make such a wonderful team.

988
01:04:33,274 --> 01:04:34,703
探长麦肯齐
Inspector McKenzie.

989
01:04:36,538 --> 01:04:38,643
我想和你谈谈
I'd like a word with you.

990
01:04:38,714 --> 01:04:41,332
你不应该在这里，福布斯博士
You shouldn't be here, Dr. Forbes.

991
01:04:41,402 --> 01:04:43,639
如果你要讨论阿历克斯的情况，可以去我办公室
If you want to discuss Alex's case,
you can come to my office.

992
01:04:43,706 --> 01:04:45,495
我希望你能释放我儿子
I want you to release my son.

993
01:04:45,562 --> 01:04:47,056
先生，您的儿子被指控犯有谋杀罪
Sir, your son's been charged with murder.

994
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,788
我的儿子是无辜的
My son is innocent.

995
01:04:52,698 --> 01:04:55,764
我们当然希望你也这么想，马丁
We might have expected you to take that for granted, Martin.

996
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:58,071
他牵涉到多起死亡
He's implicated in the deaths

997
01:04:58,139 --> 01:05:02,929
乔希・坎贝尔、苏珊・米勒、还有奈杰尔・科比
of Josh Campbell, Susan Mueller, and Nigel Colbie.

998
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:04,377
我有工作得做
I have a job to do.

999
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:07,766
你的父亲会希望你帮助我们
Your father would have expected you to help us.

1000
01:05:13,979 --> 01:05:17,013
我父亲会希望我坚持法律
My father would have expected me to uphold the law.

1001
01:05:18,363 --> 01:05:20,752
别妄想说你了解我
Don't presume to know me

1002
01:05:20,828 --> 01:05:22,551
仅仅因为我们同属一个俱乐部
just because we belong to the same club.

1003
01:05:23,996 --> 01:05:25,108
晚安，福布斯博士
Good night, Dr. Forbes.

1004
01:05:34,844 --> 01:05:38,838
汽车锁在车库里，而且我们也搜查了房子
The car's locked in the garage,
and we've searched the house.

1005
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:40,632


1006
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,326
他们动过信用卡或银行帐户吗？
Have they used their credit cards or bank accounts?

1007
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,891
- 没有，先生
- 好
- No, sir. - All right.

1008
01:05:43,965 --> 01:05:45,426
及时通知我
Keep me informed.

1009
01:05:47,037 --> 01:05:49,371
还是没有奈杰尔父母的消息，嗯？
Still no sign of Nigel's parents, huh?

1010
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:52,795
奈杰尔・科比是不是
Was Nigel Colbie a suspect

1011
01:05:52,861 --> 01:05:54,749
苏珊・米勒被害案的嫌疑犯？
in the Susan Mueller killing?

1012
01:05:55,997 --> 01:05:58,298
我们正在调查奈杰尔・科比死亡
We're investigating the death of Nigel Colbie.

1013
01:05:58,365 --> 01:06:00,373
难道你不觉得很值得
关注下事情发生的根本？
Don't you think it's worth looking at
in the light of what's happening?

1014
01:06:00,445 --> 01:06:02,583
我去过那个现场
I've already been down that road.

1015
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:07,443
没有指纹，没有作案工具，没有合理的根据
No fingerprints. No murder weapon. No probable cause.

1016
01:06:07,517 --> 01:06:09,208
死路一条
End of story.

1017
01:06:14,622 --> 01:06:16,531
这里没有证据证实你说的话
There's no proof of what you're telling me.

1018
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:18,810
但有证据指明，你爆了那个声称有罪的男孩的头
And the evidence indicates you shot 
the head off the boy you're incriminating,

1019
01:06:18,878 --> 01:06:21,300
所以你究竟想让别人去相信什么？
so just what do you want anyone to believe?

1020
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:23,316
相信如果不是我
被奈杰尔弄昏了头脑
That if it wasn't for me messing with Nigel's head,

1021
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:25,779
那么苏珊和乔希都会活着
then both Susan and Josh would still be alive.

1022
01:06:25,855 --> 01:06:27,960
不要以为因为承担了过失，你就能得到救赎
Don't think you'll get some kind
of redemption by taking the blame.

1023
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:30,365
你以为我想得到什么救赎吗？
What makes you think I want
any kind of redemption?

1024
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:31,608
我告诉你，我没有做过
I told you, I didn't do it.

1025
01:06:35,551 --> 01:06:37,722
阿历克斯，我想相信你
Alex, I want to believe you.

1026
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,546
但是看看，看看事实
But come on, look at the facts.

1027
01:06:39,615 --> 01:06:40,760
事实
The facts.

1028
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:41,976
我想帮助你
I want to help you.

1029
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,152
但你先帮我，给我点什么
But you've got to help me.
Give me something to go on.

1030
01:06:44,223 --> 01:06:46,743
在他妈太晚之前弄点实证
Something concrete before it's too fucking late.

1031
01:06:48,544 --> 01:06:50,431
找到奈杰尔的红宝书
Find Nigel's red book.

1032
01:06:53,215 --> 01:06:54,557
那本奈杰尔给你的书？
The book Nigel gave you?

1033
01:06:54,623 --> 01:06:55,768
是啊，他的圣经
Yeah, his Bible.

1034
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,334
但是我会在书里面找到些什么？
And what would I expect to find in this Bible?

1035
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,310
- 大部分事实
- 阿历克斯
- Most things. - Alex.

1036
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:01,845
我最后一次看到它，是在我的房间里面
Last time I saw it, it was in my room.

1037
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,992
- 你的房间已被清查过
- 他们肯定把它拿走了
- Your room was stripped. - They must have taken it.

1038
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,590
“他们”又是谁？
Who might "they" be?

1039
01:07:05,664 --> 01:07:08,534
“他们”是那些不希望自己的秘密
被出卖的人们
"They" who don't wish to have their secrets betrayed.

1040
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,095
哦！ “他们的秘密！他们，它们，我们...”
Oh! "Their secrets! They, them, us..."

1041
01:07:11,168 --> 01:07:12,924
你听过自己说的话吗？
你知道自己在说啥吗？
Will you listen to you? What are you talking about?

1042
01:07:16,929 --> 01:07:19,547
你根本就不想告诉我到底发生了什么
You've no intention
of telling me what really happened.

1043
01:07:19,617 --> 01:07:22,584
我仍... 我.. 我在浪费自己的时间，不是吗？
I'm st... l...
I'm wasting my time, aren't I?

1044
01:07:22,656 --> 01:07:24,860
你不觉得有点奇怪吗，你的麦肯齐探长
Don't you think it's a little odd
that your Detective McKenzie

1045
01:07:24,928 --> 01:07:27,514
至今都没见到奈杰尔的父母？
hasn't spoken to Nigel's parents yet?

1046
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,657
你怎么知道没见到？
How do you know he hasn't?

1047
01:07:31,233 --> 01:07:33,121
去看看奈杰尔家的房子下面
Have a look at the run
underneath Nigel's house.

1048
01:07:35,265 --> 01:07:36,956
在其他东西消失之前
Before anything else goes missing.

1049
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:07,966


1050
01:08:11,778 --> 01:08:13,688


1051
01:08:13,763 --> 01:08:15,868


1052
01:08:17,443 --> 01:08:18,970


1053
01:08:20,643 --> 01:08:22,204


1054
01:08:23,459 --> 01:08:24,408


1055
01:08:27,043 --> 01:08:28,025


1056
01:09:23,013 --> 01:09:24,442
哦，上帝。
Oh, God.

1057
01:09:36,518 --> 01:09:37,466


1058
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:38,491


1059
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,699


1060
01:11:11,978 --> 01:11:13,669


1061
01:11:33,547 --> 01:11:35,816
哦，真让人抓狂
Oh, just get a grip.

1062
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:59,816


1063
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:07,269
哦！
Oh!

1064
01:13:07,343 --> 01:13:09,732
哦，他妈的
Oh, fuck.

1065
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:13,667


1066
01:13:13,743 --> 01:13:14,921
哦！
Oh!

1067
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:17,773


1068
01:13:17,839 --> 01:13:18,984


1069
01:13:19,055 --> 01:13:20,332
哦！
Ohh!

1070
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:25,130


1071
01:13:27,056 --> 01:13:29,609


1072
01:13:33,935 --> 01:13:35,790


1073
01:13:35,856 --> 01:13:37,961
哦...妈的
Oh... fuck.

1074
01:13:38,928 --> 01:13:41,067
哦...
Ohh...

1075
01:13:44,656 --> 01:13:45,933


1076
01:13:47,248 --> 01:13:48,710


1077
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,268
他们都经过防腐处理
They were both embalmed.

1078
01:13:56,337 --> 01:13:58,028
一个相当复杂的工作，真的
Quite an elaborate job, really.

1079
01:13:58,097 --> 01:14:00,552
无论谁做的这事，都很不怕麻烦
Whoever did this went to a lot of trouble.

1080
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:02,600
放血，移除所有主要器官
Blood drained, all the main organs removed,

1081
01:14:02,673 --> 01:14:04,462
甚至包括大脑
including the brain.

1082
01:14:05,777 --> 01:14:06,955
像动物标本
Like taxidermy.

1083
01:14:08,178 --> 01:14:09,704
也可以这么说
That's another way to look at it,

1084
01:14:09,777 --> 01:14:11,785
但我想程序应该差不多
but I guess it's a similar procedure.

1085
01:14:11,858 --> 01:14:13,167
那么，他们是怎么死的？
Well, how did they die?

1086
01:14:13,234 --> 01:14:14,728
都是枪杀
Both shotgun deaths.

1087
01:14:15,825 --> 01:14:16,774
对不起
Excuse me.

1088
01:14:18,482 --> 01:14:19,692
我不希望你在这里
I don't want you here.

1089
01:14:19,762 --> 01:14:20,907
你应该搜查过
You should've been looking.

1090
01:14:20,977 --> 01:14:22,570
或者说你不希望找到他们？
Or didn't you want them found?

1091
01:14:29,778 --> 01:14:32,429
我们是通过正常渠道搜查的
We were searching via normal channels.

1092
01:14:32,498 --> 01:14:34,702
或许，每次有人失踪，我都应该去
Or should I go around digging up vegetable patches

1093
01:14:34,771 --> 01:14:36,113
挖挖菜园子？
every time someone goes missing?

1094
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:38,797
哦，那得看是什么情况，不是吗？
Well, that depends on the circumstances, doesn't it?

1095
01:14:38,866 --> 01:14:40,622
还有，你他妈的
And what the fuck

1096
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:42,119
究竟在这做什么？
were you doing down here?

1097
01:14:42,195 --> 01:14:44,203
你的脏活！
Your dirty work!

1098
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:48,201
这是什么？
What's this?

1099
01:14:51,059 --> 01:14:52,269
什么？
What?

1100
01:14:52,339 --> 01:14:53,419
啥都不是
It's nothing.


1101
01:14:54,579 --> 01:14:56,488
对，我猜这也没啥
Then I suppose this is nothing as well.

1102
01:14:58,419 --> 01:15:00,077
有没有什么事你想告诉我的？
Is there something you want to tell me?

1103
01:15:01,044 --> 01:15:02,418
是的，我是一个成员
Yes. I'm a member.

1104
01:15:02,484 --> 01:15:04,371
我父亲是个成员
My father was a member.

1105
01:15:04,435 --> 01:15:05,712
就这么传下来了
It was passed on to me.

1106
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,187
这是一个商业网
It's a business network.

1107
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,201
而他们最不需要
And the last thing they need

1108
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:09,388
就是跟这种事儿连到一块
is to be connected to something like this.

1109
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,507
所以你现在说他们是相关的了
So you're saying they are connected.

1110
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,587
不要把你的话强加给我！
Don't put fucking words in my mouth!

1111
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,351
这里没有什么阴谋
There's no conspiracy here.

1112
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,941
规则就是要像狮子会一样狡猾
The order is about as insidious as the Lions Club.

1113
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,947
阿历克斯・福布斯扰乱了你的头脑
Alex Forbes is fucking with your mind.

1114
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,257
而你却任其为之，
还说自己是心理学家
And you're letting him, and you're the psychologist.

1115
01:15:22,324 --> 01:15:24,015
好吧，好吧，我很抱歉。我只是...
All right, all right, I'm sorry. I'm just...

1116
01:15:25,173 --> 01:15:26,995
...综观所有的角度
...looking at all the angles.

1117
01:15:27,061 --> 01:15:29,298
听着... 萨尔
Look... Sal.

1118
01:15:29,365 --> 01:15:31,437
我这边的时间不多了
I'm running out of time here.

1119
01:15:32,757 --> 01:15:34,284
我真的需要知道
I really need to know

1120
01:15:34,357 --> 01:15:36,113
如果我提交的指控坚持下去
if the charges I've laid are gonna stick.

1121
01:15:37,077 --> 01:15:38,091
以你的观点...
In your opinion...

1122
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:40,816
阿历克斯・福布斯有没有谋杀奈杰尔・科比？
did Alex Forbes murder Nigel Colbie?

1123
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:45,810
所以，你找到圣经了吗？
So, did you find the Bible?

1124
01:15:53,718 --> 01:15:55,540
你知道这是谁？
You know who this is?

1125
01:16:00,918 --> 01:16:02,828


1126
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,339


1127
01:16:13,143 --> 01:16:14,899
你好，很抱歉，
事实上，你们得转到
Hi. I'm sorry. Actually, you've gotta go around

1128
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:16,276
教堂前面去,入口在那
to the front of the church,
and you'll see the entrance.

1129
01:16:16,342 --> 01:16:18,546
杰克，这是我的父母
Jack. These are my parents.

1130
01:16:19,543 --> 01:16:20,558
海伦和约翰
Helen and John,

1131
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:21,613
这是我最好的朋友... 杰克
this is my best friend... Jack.

1132
01:16:21,687 --> 01:16:23,313
他在为这部戏剧工作
He's working on the play.

1133
01:16:24,983 --> 01:16:26,193
你好
Hi.

1134
01:16:26,263 --> 01:16:27,473
我听说过很多关于你的事，杰克
I've heard lots about you, Jack.

1135
01:16:27,543 --> 01:16:28,973
见到你真的很高兴
It's lovely to meet you.

1136
01:16:31,063 --> 01:16:35,406
嗯...抱歉 实际上
我得把这个拿到舞台去就位，但是，呃...
Um... sorry. I've actually got to head out with this to the stage, but, uh...

1137
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,262
我.. 希望你们喜欢这部戏剧
Oh, l... Well, I hope you enjoy the play.

1138
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:43,762
很高兴看到你这么快就交了朋友
It's nice to see you've made a friend so easily.

1139
01:16:48,504 --> 01:16:49,781
女士们，先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1140
01:16:49,848 --> 01:16:51,441
欢迎观看今晚的演出
Welcome to tonight's performance

1141
01:16:51,512 --> 01:16:53,967
丁尼生勋爵的戏剧《贝克特》
of Lord Tennyson's play Beckett.

1142
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,277
嗯...
Um...

1143
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,774
这部戏剧的表演
the presentation of this play

1144
01:16:57,849 --> 01:16:59,736
已经见证了它自身的变迁
has seen its own vicissitude

1145
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,062
伴随着上个月苏珊・米勒的不幸去世
with the tragic death last month of Susan Mueller.

1146
01:17:04,025 --> 01:17:05,618
作为对她的追忆
As a gesture to her memory,

1147
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:08,536
她的父母希望这出戏能继续进行
her parents asked that the play should proceed.

1148
01:17:08,601 --> 01:17:10,456
因此，我们用今晚的演出
So we dedicate tonight's performance

1149
01:17:10,521 --> 01:17:11,950
来追悼苏珊
to the memory of Susan.

1150
01:17:12,025 --> 01:17:13,170
谢谢
Thank you.

1151
01:17:13,241 --> 01:17:15,477


1152
01:17:15,545 --> 01:17:18,415


1153
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:23,152
那么，我们伟大的大主教...
So, then our good Archbishop...

1154
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:24,687


1155
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:29,135

1156
01:17:34,842 --> 01:17:36,850
...他们带到教堂庭前...
...and they brought before the courts of the Church...

1157
01:17:36,922 --> 01:17:38,810


1158
01:17:56,603 --> 01:17:57,780


1159
01:17:58,747 --> 01:18:00,176
停下来，奈杰尔
Stop it, Nigel.

1160
01:18:21,468 --> 01:18:23,410
读得越多，我就越沉迷于
And the more I read, the deeper I sank

1161
01:18:23,484 --> 01:18:24,826
字里行间
into the pages.

1162
01:18:25,916 --> 01:18:26,898
所有的都在这儿...
It was all there...

1163
01:18:26,972 --> 01:18:28,532
清教徒的大屠杀
the slaughter of the Cathars,

1164
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:31,288
圣殿骑士团对托马斯・贝克特的暗杀
the Templars' assassination of Thomas Beckett,

1165
01:18:31,356 --> 01:18:33,527
还有，罗马宗教法庭宣判圣殿骑士
and the Holy Inquisition
resulting in the Templars'

1166
01:18:33,596 --> 01:18:35,833
做为异教徒被逐出教会
excommunication as heretics.

1167
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:51,000
这些都让人惊叹无比...
It all made startling sense...

1168
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:54,997
{\a6\fs12\fn黑体}（埃舍尔，荷兰"图形艺术家"，多运用空间的弯曲做出让人“迷惑的图画”：
向二楼上去的楼梯不知为何返回到一楼，鸟儿在不断的变化中变成了鱼；
“旋转楼梯”：《盗梦空间》中出现过现实版埃舍尔楼梯，一直上台阶绕了一圈又回到起点）

1168
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:54,997
就像我见到埃舍尔的旋转楼梯的另一面
like I'd just seen the other side of Escher's staircase.

1169
01:18:55,069 --> 01:18:56,182
我渐渐明白过来
I'd woken up.

1170
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:03,157
奈杰尔相信自己是圣殿骑士团血系的
Nigel believed that he was a direct descendant

1171
01:19:03,229 --> 01:19:04,822
直系后裔
from the Templar bloodline.

1172
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:08,765
他是疯狂的个人
He was some fucked-up individual.

1173
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:13,819
他认为，中世纪的兄弟会的徽章
He thought that the medieval insignia of the brotherhood

1174
01:19:13,886 --> 01:19:17,236
预示了力量，我们的联盟将带来...
foretold the power that our union would bring...

1175
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:18,969
长枪做为武器
the pike being the weapon,

1176
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,243
在相互缠绕的环线中
harnessed by the interlinking loops.

1177
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:23,547
我们两个人
The two of us.

1178
01:19:40,191 --> 01:19:42,460
当我还是个孩子，我父亲曾和我站在
When I was a child, my father used to stand me

1179
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:44,600
这幅画前
in front of that painting.

1180
01:19:44,671 --> 01:19:47,835
他告诉了我勇气和勇敢的故事...
He told me stories of courage and bravery...

1181
01:19:47,903 --> 01:19:51,165
我的祖先如何为自由之权而战
how my ancestors had fought
to protect their free right.

1182
01:19:58,112 --> 01:20:01,243
直到那时我才明白过来，奈杰尔相信
It was only then that I realized what Nigel believed.

1183
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,726
我也拥有同样的圣殿骑士血统
I was of the same Templar bloodline.

1184
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,095
阿历克斯，我想知道真相
Alex, I want the truth.

1185
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,790
你做了吗？
Did you do this?

1186
01:20:15,232 --> 01:20:17,054
这就是你想要听的？
Is that what you want to hear?

1187
01:20:17,121 --> 01:20:18,582
阿历克斯，我们已经找到人来帮你了
Alex, we've got people that can help you.

1188
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:19,606
你得让他们帮忙
You must let them.

1189
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,022
你唯一关心的
The only thing that you care about

1190
01:20:21,089 --> 01:20:22,464
就是兄弟会，是不是？
is the brotherhood, isn't it?

1191
01:20:24,033 --> 01:20:25,789
奈杰尔说过，他是对的
Nigel said it, and he was right.

1192
01:20:25,857 --> 01:20:28,574
那什么都不是，只是些幼稚的男性情谊而已
There's nothing more than puerile male bonding.

1193
01:20:28,641 --> 01:20:31,641
不，你的朋友们自己都一团糟
No, your friends must be shitting themselves.

1194
01:20:31,713 --> 01:20:33,720
现在他们打算拿
那些高尔夫俱乐部会员资格怎么办？
Now what are they gonna do
about their golf club memberships?

1195
01:20:33,793 --> 01:20:35,735
听着，听着，请你，看着我
Listen. Listen.
Please. Look at me.

1196
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:52,729
我的母亲什么样子？
What was my mother like?

1197
01:20:56,674 --> 01:20:58,779
你是否后悔她的牺牲？
究竟值不值得？
Do you regret her sacrifice? Was it worth it?

1198
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:01,501
阿历克斯，你母亲的死不是你的错
Alex, your mother's death was not your fault.

1199
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:02,780
不
No.

1200
01:21:04,835 --> 01:21:06,526
不不不
No, no, no.

1201
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:08,089
你才是让她怀孕的人
You got her pregnant.

1202
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:10,681


1203
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:12,983
时间到了
It's time.

1204
01:21:24,003 --> 01:21:26,970
阿历克斯，我所想的就是你能好好的...
Alex, all I've ever wanted
was the best for you...

1205
01:21:27,043 --> 01:21:28,832
为了你母亲
for the sake of your mother.

1206
01:21:45,476 --> 01:21:46,905
进展不错嘛
Well, that went well.

1207
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:49,405
你有没有觉得
Do you ever get the feeling

1208
01:21:49,476 --> 01:21:51,931
貌似你应该为这一切负责？
you might be responsible for all this?

1209
01:21:52,997 --> 01:21:55,386


1210
01:21:55,461 --> 01:21:57,119
我再也不需要它了
Don't think I'll need that anymore.

1211
01:22:15,622 --> 01:22:17,410


1212
01:22:17,477 --> 01:22:18,426


1213
01:22:28,358 --> 01:22:30,049
你还好吗？
You all right?

1214
01:22:45,319 --> 01:22:47,261
马拉克利是谁，阿历克斯？
Who's Maraclea, Alex?

1215
01:22:53,799 --> 01:22:56,417
她是奈杰尔痴迷的工具
She was the instrument of Nigel's obsession.

1216
01:22:57,799 --> 01:22:58,748
杰克
Jack.

1217
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:02,851
我知道你无法抗拒秘密约会
I knew you couldn't resist a secret rendezvous.

1218
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,611
你想干什么？
What do you want?

1219
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,628
这边
This way.

1220
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,887
马拉克利是一个13世纪的
Maraclea was the lost love

1221
01:23:09,959 --> 01:23:12,294
圣殿骑士失去的爱人
of a 13th-century Templar.

1222
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,920
据说
As the story goes,

1223
01:23:13,992 --> 01:23:16,327
马拉克利被许配给一个圣殿骑士
Maraclea was betrothed to a Knight Templar,

1224
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,279
但在婚前就死去
but died before they could wed.

1225
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,949
而骑士被失去爱人的痛苦 深深的折磨
And the knight was so tormented by his loss

1226
01:23:22,025 --> 01:23:24,097
以至于掘开她的坟墓
that he opened her grave

1227
01:23:24,168 --> 01:23:25,794
与她做爱
and made love to her body.

1228
01:23:30,601 --> 01:23:31,549
来吧
Come on.

1229
01:23:42,505 --> 01:23:44,610
整整九个月后
Exactly nine months later,

1230
01:23:44,681 --> 01:23:46,852
他被召唤至她的墓前
he was summoned to her grave.

1231
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:48,099
打开她的棺木
On opening her coffin,

1232
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:50,690
并发现她的遗骸已被移动
he found that her remains had been moved.

1233
01:23:50,762 --> 01:23:53,958
她的头被放置于骨盆之下
Her head had been placed below her pelvis,

1234
01:23:54,025 --> 01:23:55,552
交叉的脚骨上面
sitting on top of her thigh bones,

1235
01:23:55,626 --> 01:23:57,000
（即骷髅与交叉的肢骨）
which had been crossed.

1236
01:23:58,921 --> 01:24:00,198
我们到底是在哪？
Where the hell are we?

1237
01:24:04,362 --> 01:24:07,046
一个声音告诉他保护好头骨
A voice told him to guard the skull,

1238
01:24:07,114 --> 01:24:09,318
因为这将是所有能量之源
as it would be the bringer of all power.

1239
01:24:35,244 --> 01:24:36,192
哦...
Oh...

1240
01:24:45,068 --> 01:24:46,278
她是你的了，杰克
She's yours, Jack.

1241
01:24:53,164 --> 01:24:54,408
她静静的躺在那里...
She was lying there...

1242
01:24:54,476 --> 01:24:55,556


1243
01:24:57,196 --> 01:24:58,145
而他说
And he said

1244
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:00,708
既然我是她唯一的爱人...
since I was her only love...

1245
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:03,879
那么就应该由我去... 付诸行动
it was up to me to... to do the deed.

1246
01:25:05,549 --> 01:25:07,818
当我拒绝时...
And when I refused...

1247
01:25:07,885 --> 01:25:10,984
他不停的说让血统失望...
he went on about letting down the bloodline...

1248
01:25:11,053 --> 01:25:13,868
有了头骨，我们将合二为一
and that with the skull, we would be complete.

1249
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:19,015
你不了解奈杰尔
You didn't know Nigel.

1250
01:25:21,485 --> 01:25:22,761
你不了解他
You didn't know him.

1251
01:25:26,605 --> 01:25:28,994
难道你真的认为你能帮到我？
Do you honestly think that you can help me?

1252
01:25:32,205 --> 01:25:33,896
你有没有扣动扳机？
Did you pull the trigger?

1253
01:25:35,085 --> 01:25:36,515


1254
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:17,701

1255
01:26:19,568 --> 01:26:22,470
[播音员]现在六台的晚祈时间
[Announcer] Now on Radio Six,
it's time for the evening prayer

1256
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:24,453
用阁下...
with the right honorable...

1257
01:26:24,528 --> 01:26:25,575
...你问我！
...you ask me!

1258
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,294
晚上好
Good evening.

1259
01:26:28,368 --> 01:26:30,441
一个天使说，直到撒迦利亚...
An angel said unto Zechariah...

1260
01:26:30,512 --> 01:26:32,170


1261
01:26:33,552 --> 01:26:35,308
[传教士]“你的妻子将要给你生一个儿子
[Clergyman]"Your wife will bear you a son,

1262
01:26:35,376 --> 01:26:36,870
而你将给他... ”
and you are to give him... "

1263
01:26:36,944 --> 01:26:38,221


1264
01:26:38,288 --> 01:26:40,655
这...是...什么！
What... is... this?!

1265
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,608


1266
01:26:43,569 --> 01:26:44,517
咦？！
Eh?!

1267
01:26:44,593 --> 01:26:46,087
嗯？！
Hmm?!

1268
01:26:48,529 --> 01:26:52,239
有没有人来告诉我这是怎么回事？！
Will someone tell me what's going on?!

1269
01:26:53,233 --> 01:26:54,760
看看
Look at them.

1270
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:56,077
看看...这些！
Look... at them!

1271
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:00,399
我不知道怎么回事，我没做过
I don't know about these. I didn't do this.

1272
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:02,124
是啊，你... 你可以想象我有多惊讶
Yes, well, you... you can imagine my surprise

1273
01:27:02,193 --> 01:27:04,430
当他们在旅馆里把这给我时！
when they handed this to me at the lodge!

1274
01:27:04,498 --> 01:27:06,189
结果我回来发现你们俩？我
And then I come home and find this? I

1275
01:27:06,258 --> 01:27:07,981
这太恶心了！
That is disgusting!

1276
01:27:09,009 --> 01:27:10,700
他又不能跟你谈！那他还能
He can't talk to you!Who is he

1277
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:11,980
- 跟谁说？
- 谈？！谈谈？！
- supposed to talk to? - Talk?! Talk?!

1278
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,122
你管这叫谈话？！
You call this talk?!

1279
01:27:14,194 --> 01:27:15,917
你在暗示些什么？
What are you implying?

1280
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:18,124
谁拍的照片？
Who took the photos?

1281
01:27:18,194 --> 01:27:19,405
我此前从未见过这些照片
I've never seen them before.

1282
01:27:19,474 --> 01:27:20,456
哦...
Oh...

1283
01:27:20,530 --> 01:27:21,577
奈杰尔
Nigel.

1284
01:27:22,899 --> 01:27:23,847
奈杰尔？
Nigel?

1285
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:27,018


1286
01:27:27,091 --> 01:27:28,400
- 他们觉得这样最好
- 哦，我的上帝
- They thought it would be best - Oh, my God.

1287
01:27:28,466 --> 01:27:31,336
如果我离开一阵子...
If I left for a while...

1288
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:33,647
来让我的家庭回到正轨
to get my family back on track.

1289
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:35,308
当然，你知道，我..我明白了
Well, sure. You know, l... I understand.

1290
01:27:35,379 --> 01:27:36,557
我是说，我们不能让这种事情
I mean, we can't have this sort of thing

1291
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:38,514
发生在主人自己的卧室，是吗？
happening in the master's own bedroom, can we?

1292
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:39,626
是吧？！啊！啊！
Can we?!Aah! Aah!

1293
01:27:39,699 --> 01:27:41,128
- 啊！啊！
- 是吗？！
- Aaahh! Aah! - Can we?!

1294
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:44,553
我真的... 非常抱歉
I'm so... very sorry.

1295
01:27:44,628 --> 01:27:45,740
告诉我为什么
Tell me why.

1296
01:27:45,811 --> 01:27:47,753
告诉我为什么！
Tell me why!

1297
01:27:47,827 --> 01:27:49,485
啊！ [吞吐]
Aah! 

1298
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:52,108
- 告诉我！告诉我！告诉我！
- 我不知道！
- Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! - I don't know why!

1299
01:27:52,179 --> 01:27:53,128


1300
01:27:53,204 --> 01:27:54,186


1301
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:55,208


1302
01:27:55,284 --> 01:27:57,193


1303
01:27:57,267 --> 01:27:58,576
哦，上帝
Oh, God.

1304
01:28:00,372 --> 01:28:02,379
哦，上帝，哦，上帝
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1305
01:28:02,452 --> 01:28:04,362


1306
01:28:11,572 --> 01:28:12,554
不
No.

1307
01:28:14,612 --> 01:28:15,660
杰克
Jack.

1308
01:28:15,732 --> 01:28:16,910
你来了
You made it.

1309
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:18,125
哦，不
Oh, no.

1310
01:28:19,797 --> 01:28:21,171
哦...
Oh...

1311
01:28:21,237 --> 01:28:23,059
你做了什么？
What have you done?

1312
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:25,001
她被选中了
She was chosen.

1313
01:28:25,077 --> 01:28:26,538
哦，不
Oh, no.

1314
01:28:26,613 --> 01:28:29,330
请你，只要把枪放下
Please. Just put the gun down.

1315
01:28:29,397 --> 01:28:31,088
- 只要给我
- 不要靠近... 别过...
- Just give it to me. - Don't come near... Don't come...

1316
01:28:31,157 --> 01:28:33,361
- 不要靠近我！呆在原地别动！ - 不！
- Don't come near me! Stay where you are! - No!

1317
01:28:39,253 --> 01:28:40,530


1318
01:28:57,814 --> 01:28:59,188

1319
01:29:21,975 --> 01:29:24,910
杀人的感觉真是非同寻常，不是吗？
Killing is such an extraordinary feeling, isn't it?

1320
01:29:31,576 --> 01:29:33,332
我将拥有自己的马拉克利
I'll have my Maraclea.

1321
01:29:35,256 --> 01:29:36,782
你感觉如何？
How do you feel?

1322
01:29:38,775 --> 01:29:39,724
杰克？
Jack?

1323
01:29:41,816 --> 01:29:42,928
你感觉如何？
How do you feel?

1324
01:29:48,376 --> 01:29:50,132
这些都是你一手策划的，不是吗？
You set the whole thing up, didn't you?

1325
01:29:52,953 --> 01:29:53,935


1326
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:56,947
来吧
Come on.

1327
01:29:57,016 --> 01:29:58,445
我们还有活要干
We've got work to do.

1328
01:30:12,377 --> 01:30:13,489


1329
01:30:23,801 --> 01:30:24,750


1330
01:30:43,098 --> 01:30:44,145
他们走了
They're gone.

1331
01:30:45,819 --> 01:30:47,063
我恨他
I hated him.

1332
01:30:48,379 --> 01:30:50,288
难道人们不会发现他们不见啦？
Don't you think they're gonna be missed?

1333
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:53,205
只要他们九个月还找不到她
Well, as long as
they don't find her for nine months,

1334
01:30:53,275 --> 01:30:54,769
其他的都无所谓了，不是吗？
it really doesn't matter, does it?

1335
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,347
你没有吧
You didn't.

1336
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:01,904
不，你没有
No. You didn't.

1337
01:31:03,739 --> 01:31:05,168
你觉得我们在这里干嘛？
What do you think we're here for?

1338
01:31:07,099 --> 01:31:08,528
你疯了
You're fucked.

1339
01:31:09,883 --> 01:31:11,258
你彻底疯了
You're absolutely fucked.

1340
01:31:11,324 --> 01:31:12,818
那么你和苏珊又怎样？
And what about you and Susan?

1341
01:31:12,892 --> 01:31:13,840
我又没做
I didn't do it.

1342
01:31:13,916 --> 01:31:15,160
噢，得了吧
Oh, come on.

1343
01:31:15,228 --> 01:31:16,690
我把她留给你
I left you with her.

1344
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:18,936
我能从你身上闻到她的气味
I could smell you on her.

1345
01:31:19,004 --> 01:31:20,149
不
No.

1346
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,431
你抚摸了她？
Did you touch her?

1347
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:22,841
然后你感觉到她
And then you felt her.

1348
01:31:22,909 --> 01:31:24,796
- 不不
- 现在没什么区别了
- No. No. - It doesn't make any difference now.

1349
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:26,453
- 你可以拥有你的马拉克利
- 不
- You can have your Maraclea. - No.

1350
01:31:26,524 --> 01:31:28,793
收获的寡妇在这恭候着我！
A harvest widow awaits me here!

1351
01:31:28,861 --> 01:31:30,617
我们将系在一起！
We will be united!

1352
01:31:36,381 --> 01:31:37,493
这是注定的
It's fated.

1353
01:31:58,462 --> 01:31:59,574
杰克！
Jack!

1354
01:32:06,622 --> 01:32:07,996
已经结束了，奈杰尔
It's over, Nigel.

1355
01:32:10,142 --> 01:32:12,509
它永远不会结束，你知道
It'll never be over. You know that.

1356
01:32:14,143 --> 01:32:15,091
开火啊
Do it.

1357
01:32:16,702 --> 01:32:17,880
来吧，开枪啊
Come on, do it.

1358
01:32:19,262 --> 01:32:20,277
够了，杰克
Stop it, Jack.

1359
01:32:20,351 --> 01:32:21,299
开枪
Do it.

1360
01:32:22,271 --> 01:32:23,897
别走开，杰克
Stop walking away, Jack.

1361
01:32:23,967 --> 01:32:24,915
开枪！
Do it!

1362
01:32:26,559 --> 01:32:27,606
离开铁轨
Stay off the track.

1363
01:32:29,823 --> 01:32:31,033
开枪！
Do it!

1364
01:32:31,103 --> 01:32:33,110
我给你看了那张牌，记住
I showed you the card, remember.

1365
01:32:33,183 --> 01:32:34,842
它写着永恒
It's written for eternity.

1366
01:32:34,912 --> 01:32:36,821
闭嘴！
Shut your face!

1367
01:32:36,895 --> 01:32:37,843


1368
01:32:39,104 --> 01:32:41,209
开枪！开枪！
Do it! Do it!

1369
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,709
不！别动！
No! Don't!

1370
01:32:42,784 --> 01:32:45,304
我们不是
拥有神赐之权的圣殿骑士！
Look, we're not Templars with God-given rights!

1371
01:32:45,376 --> 01:32:47,515
这里没有圣战可打，奈杰尔！
There are no Holy Wars to fight, Nigel!

1372
01:32:47,584 --> 01:32:49,493
哪来的敌人？
Who's the enemy now?

1373
01:32:49,568 --> 01:32:51,062
我们是...
We are...

1374
01:32:51,136 --> 01:32:52,151
因为...
because...

1375
01:32:53,504 --> 01:32:56,472
...我们需要的，
比生活本身所能给予的多得多
...because we wanted more
from life than it has to offer.

1376
01:32:56,544 --> 01:32:57,754
你在自欺欺人
You're deluded.

1377
01:32:57,824 --> 01:32:59,351
为什么？
Why?

1378
01:32:59,424 --> 01:33:01,977
我为什么骗人？这是我们的命运
Why am I deluded? This is our fate.

1379
01:33:02,049 --> 01:33:03,423
现在，不要说了！
Now, just shut the fuck up!

1380
01:33:06,304 --> 01:33:07,482
- 为我祈祷吧
- 你在干什么？
- Pray for me. - What are you doing?

1381
01:33:07,553 --> 01:33:09,047
为自己祈祷吧
Pray for yourself.

1382
01:33:09,121 --> 01:33:11,031
我们合二为一了
We're one now.

1383
01:33:11,104 --> 01:33:12,479
啊！
Aah!

1384
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:13,493


1385
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:40,694


1386
01:33:46,946 --> 01:33:48,856


1387
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:15,005


1388
01:34:47,429 --> 01:34:48,443
那些
What follows

1389
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:49,465
通过一系列的
through a system

1390
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:50,489
恐吓，
of either intimidation,

1391
01:34:50,565 --> 01:34:52,420
操纵，或胁迫，
manipulation, or coercion,

1392
01:34:52,485 --> 01:34:53,859
来使支配者
is the dominant individual


1393
01:34:53,925 --> 01:34:55,997
开始聚焦并影响
begins to focus and influence the thoughts

1394
01:34:56,069 --> 01:34:57,563
从属伙伴的思维
of the subordinate partner.

1395
01:34:57,637 --> 01:35:00,452
这个过程培育了
一个主观的格式塔形态
This process nurtures a subjective gestalt

1396
01:35:00,517 --> 01:35:04,194
在那些相似的思维，幻想，
还有其它的连锁因素之中
where similar thoughts, fantasies,
and other interlocking elements

1397
01:35:04,262 --> 01:35:07,328
协力共建一个更强大更不稳定的约束
conspire to form
a greater and more volatile hold,

1398
01:35:07,398 --> 01:35:10,562
从而，心智合一
therefore a merging of like minds.

1399
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:12,004
谢谢
Thank you.

1400
01:35:28,230 --> 01:35:29,342


1401
01:35:59,207 --> 01:36:00,549


1402
01:36:02,056 --> 01:36:03,332


1403
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:04,348


1404
01:36:04,424 --> 01:36:05,569
喂？
Hello?

1405
01:36:41,193 --> 01:36:42,403
头不见了
The head's missing.

1406
01:37:01,195 --> 01:37:02,885
奈杰尔得到了他想要的
Nigel got what he wanted.

1407
01:37:02,954 --> 01:37:04,515
那是什么？
And what was that?

1408
01:37:05,643 --> 01:37:06,690
永恒
Eternity.

1409
01:37:10,539 --> 01:37:12,066
你不懂，不是吗？
You don't get it, do you?

1410
01:37:15,915 --> 01:37:16,863
你会的
You will.

1411
