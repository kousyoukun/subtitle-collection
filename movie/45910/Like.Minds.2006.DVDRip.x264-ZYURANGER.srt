Keep an eye on them.

[Boy] I can't remember
when I first noticed the change.

10
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:26,666
It's not that I didn't see it coming.

11
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,667
I just didn't want to believe it.

12
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:32,431
I guess that's not much of an excuse,

13
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:33,941
but it's the truth.

14
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:36,670
You're an evil little fucker.

00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:53,820
[Boy]
I guess it didn't look good.

16
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:01,466
But he had to die.

17
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:04,028
It was a necessary means to an end.

18
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:09,708
All can tell you
is that the heavens were falling.

19
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,540
And the sound, it...

20
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:17,112
The sound-- it was incredible. It was...

21
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:20,282
It was like the gods were rejoicing

22
00:03:20,354 --> 00:03:21,549
for what was done.

Mmm. Good things come to those who wait.

29
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:09,196
And "Hello" to you, too, Martin.

30
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,466
He's a 17-year-old smart-ass

little rich kid.

32
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,801
I'm under pressure to let him go

33
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,434
because the evidence is circumstantial,

34
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,773
so I charged him.

35
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,441
I need you to find him culpable.

36
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,939
Anything else?

37
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:24,644
Good luck.

Luck's for the Irish, McKenzie.

39
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,222
Hello, Alex.

40
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:39,232
My name's Sally Rowe.

41
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,268
I'm a forensic psychologist.

42
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:42,496
I've been asked to talk to you

43
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,095
to find out what happened.

44
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:46,641
Would you like someone
present during this interview?

45
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,408
Would you?

46
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,913
You mind if I record?

47
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:04,424
Tell me about your friend-- Nigel.

48
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,290
Oh, he wasn't my friend.

49
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:09,590
What did you mean when you said, "His...

50
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:11,598
death was a necessary means to an end?"

51
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,191
Do you think that I did this?

52
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:17,130
I'm here to listen to you, Alex.

53
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:22,268
During the 13th century...

54
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:24,778
there were these people known as Cathars.

55
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:27,071
And they insisted

56
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:29,947
that God could only be experienced firsthand,

57
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:33,282
so they banished all the priests
and the bishops.

58
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:35,322
Now, this undermined the power of the Vatican,

59
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,848
which caused the Pope
to lose precious revenues in the region.

60
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,887
You like history, Alex.

61
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,301
In 1209...

62
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:50,463
a Vatican army descended
upon Cathar villages,

63
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:53,906
and every man, woman,
and child was slaughtered.

64
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:56,740
And when an officer inquired to the Pope

65
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:59,371
how to distinguish
between the heretics and the true believers,

66
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,142
you know what his response was?

67
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,341
"Kill them all.

68
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,544
God will recognize his own."

69
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:08,886
And why are you telling me this?

70
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:14,157
Are you a religious woman, Ms. Rowe?

71
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:15,992
Is that important to you?

72
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,088
Well, do you want to know what I believe in?

73
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:20,497
It would be a good place to start.

74
00:06:20,568 --> 00:06:22,400
Gestalt.

75
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,835
Gestalt.

76
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,134
An organized whole

77
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:28,073
in which each individual part
affects every other,

78
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:30,509
but the whole being more important
than the sum of its parts.

79
00:06:30,578 --> 00:06:33,513
Yeah, I'm familiar
with first-year psychology theory.

80
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:35,071
Should I be impressed?

81
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:37,277
That's not what it is.

82
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:40,918
It's how you use it.

83
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:42,956
And how's that?

84
00:06:43,024 --> 00:06:44,583
Well, you're the psychologist.

85
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,363
Look, Nigel's dead.

86
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:55,903
I've been charged with murder.

87
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,938
Doesn't really matter
what I believe in, now, does it?

88
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,771
You're not one for making
good first impressions, are you, Alex?

I don't know.

00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, he was slipping up to your room.

Sorry?

00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:39,575
Well, I saw them put an extra bed
in your room before.

That's bollocks.

Well, they did.

Sir, can I have
permission to leave, please?

Where do you need to go, Mr. Forbes?

104

To the bathroom.

Can't it wait, boy?

Well, that's hard to say, sir.

107
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,066
It's quite urgent business.

Do you mind?

00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:12,895
Don't get too comfortable.

Weird.

112
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:29,151
He's got this collection of stuffed animals.

113
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:31,191
Isn't he a bit old for that?

114

Real animals, you dick.

115
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,850
Cool.

116
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:36,761
Have you heard anything about him?

117
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:39,163
Well, it's been hard to get any dirt on him.

118
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,928
I heard some guys at dinner

119

saying that he used to be

Yeah.

122
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:46,497
But apparently, he had

123
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:48,064
some kind of family issues.

124
00:09:48,142 --> 00:09:49,337
So they sent him here?

Raj was Josh's roommate.

He just kind of hung out with us.

135

He was different.

00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:30,576
Yeah, I'll give him that.

142
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:33,086
I guess that's why
I found him interesting at first.

[glass clinking]

144
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:38,916
And he had this morbid fascination
with all things dead.

145
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:48,165
[Sally]
And what about you, Alex?

146
00:10:48,235 --> 00:10:50,499
I told the police everything.

147
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:51,595
Why don't you ask them?

148
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:53,800
I'm asking you, Alex.

149
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:56,772
Do you have any children?

150
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:59,575
I mean, well, you're not bad-looking.

151
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:01,706
I think you're running out of time, you know?

152
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:03,113
No, you're the one running out of time.

153
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,585
I read once
that a third of women study psychology

154
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:08,418
to work out their own personal problems.
What do you think?

155
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:11,116
Tell me about Nigel.

156
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:13,092
Well, Nigel got what he wanted.

157
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,525
And what was that?

158
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,120

Nothing I can't handle.

How did you get on?

167
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,749
Well, this case is bullshit, McKenzie.

00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:58,233
I'm really sorry about your friend.

661
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:02,635
Fuck off, freak.

662
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,198
But you don't have to worry.

663
00:42:06,211 --> 00:42:07,542
He's at peace now.

664
00:42:08,981 --> 00:42:12,144
The harvest moon
is the ripening of the harvest.

665
00:42:12,217 --> 00:42:13,742
And the honeymoon is the goal of love.

666
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:16,254
He dies of his...

667
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,649
Does it please you?

668
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:25,027
Take it.

669
00:42:25,097 --> 00:42:27,327
Girl's really something, isn't she?

670
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:32,994
The last parting shaft

671
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:35,063
of a forlorn cupid on the king's left breast.

[retching]

675
00:43:38,337 --> 00:43:40,533
And then when I got back,
the hand was gone.

676
00:43:40,606 --> 00:43:43,007
Did you tell anyone?

677
00:43:43,075 --> 00:43:44,941
Who was I gonna tell?

678
00:43:46,478 --> 00:43:48,708
And why do you think it was Josh's hand?

679
00:43:50,582 --> 00:43:52,448
I don't know.
I didn't exactly study it.

680
00:43:54,786 --> 00:43:56,777
He was everywhere.

681
00:43:57,956 --> 00:43:59,651
Everywhere.

682
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:02,224
Look, all I'm saying is that

683
00:44:02,294 --> 00:44:04,023
Nigel could have quite easily taken it.

684
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:09,258
And how do you feel about Nigel now?

685
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:12,269
That he got what he deserved.

686
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:19,406
How do I know you're telling the truth?

687
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,572
You don't.

688
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,915
[chattering]

689
00:44:38,263 --> 00:44:39,890
You get out of my room.

690
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:41,364
-Have you finished your essay?
-Get out.

691
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:46,001
It looks like you need a hand.

692
00:44:46,071 --> 00:44:47,334
Get out!

693
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:51,573
You might find these helpful.

[Alex narrating]
How did he know

695
00:45:03,622 --> 00:45:05,317
I was struggling with my essay?

696
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:08,588
How did he know my topic?

697
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,856
I mean, he had answers fo questions

698
00:45:10,929 --> 00:45:12,761
I hadn't even thought of yet.

699
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,124
But with only an hour left of study time,

700
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:17,930
I knew I didn't have a choice.

701
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:22,000
It was like selling my soul.

702
00:45:24,676 --> 00:45:28,510
Poole, rubbish.
Sims, rubbish.

703
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:32,047
-Better.
-Thank you, sir.

704
00:45:33,285 --> 00:45:34,275
Well, this is a step

705
00:45:34,353 --> 00:45:35,548
in the right direction, Mr. Linden.

706
00:45:35,621 --> 00:45:37,055
Well done.

707
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:40,922
Excellent work, Mr. Forbes.

708
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:45,261
I was beginning to worry about you, lad.

709
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:51,330
I felt worthless.

I've got a night planned.

713

What are you doing here?

714
00:46:28,974 --> 00:46:30,669
I want to show you something.

I'm not interested.

Don't forget I helped you.

Come on. It'll be fun.

Are you having fun?

Oh, come on, Alex,
you've come all this way.

Fine.

Is this your house?

Where are your parents?

726
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:39,269
They're probably away.

727
00:47:39,344 --> 00:47:40,971

tell me the history of the flag.

What do you mean?
Captain Hook and Long John Silver?

the things that are closest to you.

-Is that supposed to be a riddle?
-No.

It's about you.

Yeah.

775

It's nothing more than
puerile male-bonding now.

But it was once something.

This.

What?

786
00:51:53,531 --> 00:51:55,659
Do you know when
playing cards first appeared?

787
00:51:58,637 --> 00:52:00,196
The 12th century.

788
00:52:01,506 --> 00:52:02,905
And that was the start of the real brotherhood.

789
00:52:02,974 --> 00:52:04,601
I mean, imagine what it must have been like.

790
00:52:04,676 --> 00:52:07,043
The-- The loss of the Holy Land,

791

the Templars abandoning the Church...

792
00:52:09,948 --> 00:52:11,074
the death of Beckett.

793
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:14,779
And out of it comes a simple, logical game.

794
00:52:14,853 --> 00:52:16,116
I mean, it's just a game,

795
00:52:16,187 --> 00:52:18,246
but it's...

796
00:52:18,323 --> 00:52:19,882
it's a game born with...

797
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:21,653
injustice, hardship,

798
00:52:21,726 --> 00:52:22,716
suffering...

799
00:52:24,295 --> 00:52:25,524
Death.

800
00:52:27,632 --> 00:52:29,930
Now, that is truly an age to revere.

801
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:31,969
You're fucked.

802
00:52:32,037 --> 00:52:33,869
You can't deny the truths
that this card has seen

803
00:52:33,938 --> 00:52:37,033
and the truths we can show it again.

804
00:52:37,108 --> 00:52:39,304
So, why am I here, Nigel?

805
00:52:48,887 --> 00:52:51,049
-Look up "Jack."
-Sorry?

806
00:52:51,122 --> 00:52:52,385
Look up "Jack."

807
00:53:10,008 --> 00:53:11,442
It says "knave," doesn't it?

808
00:53:14,479 --> 00:53:16,573
Do you know what a knave is?

809
00:53:16,648 --> 00:53:18,946
Yes.

That's what you are, Alex.

813
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:29,226
Do you know what this is?

814
00:53:29,294 --> 00:53:30,989
It's a spade.

815
00:53:31,062 --> 00:53:34,157
Spade represents a tip of a pike.

816
00:53:34,232 --> 00:53:35,791
Do you know what a pike is?

817
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:38,336
-It's a kind of spear.
-Mmm.

818
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:40,428
An implement for killing.

819
00:53:42,006 --> 00:53:43,474
That's what I am.

820
00:53:45,744 --> 00:53:47,974
This is our time... Jack.

821
00:53:49,147 --> 00:53:51,639
We've been brought together for a reason...

822
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:54,677
...and it's written here.

823
00:53:57,122 --> 00:53:58,453
For eternity.

00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:14,338
Mr. Poole, I want
better work from you, as well.

829
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:18,876
-Sir, can I ask you a question?
-Certainly.

830
00:54:18,943 --> 00:54:21,310
Whether or not I can answer it
is another question.

831
00:54:21,379 --> 00:54:26,215
Do you think it's possible
to get inside people's minds?

832
00:54:26,284 --> 00:54:28,480
I just need to know whether you think
objectively that's possible.

833
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:29,748
-Objectively.
-Yeah.

834
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:31,653
My dear boy,

835
00:54:31,723 --> 00:54:33,851
the power of the mind has no boundaries.

836
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:37,622
Understanding its capabilities is like--

837
00:54:37,695 --> 00:54:41,063
is like searching for the end of the universe.

838
00:54:41,132 --> 00:54:43,362
Or trying to find the beginning of time.

839
00:54:47,105 --> 00:54:49,073
Okay.

840
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,369
Thank you.

841
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,689
Hey, Sor-- Susan.
Sorry.

842
00:55:10,762 --> 00:55:12,491
Hi. I-- I just--
I just wanted to say

843
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:14,123
that I thought you were absolutely fantastic.

844
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:16,458
Thanks.

845
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:18,366
Come on, Sue, or we'll miss the bus.

846
00:55:18,436 --> 00:55:20,063
Sorry. I've got to go.

847
00:55:20,138 --> 00:55:21,572
[stammering]
No. Will you hang on for one second?

848
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:22,936
Sorry.

849
00:55:23,007 --> 00:55:25,806
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

850
00:55:25,877 --> 00:55:26,867
um...

851
00:55:28,012 --> 00:55:29,002
I'm not particularly good at this.

852
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,106
I was-- I was just--
I was wondering if maybe

853
00:55:32,183 --> 00:55:35,278
you wanted to, you know, hook up
or something after school sometime.

854
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:37,345
I mean, it's completely--

855
00:55:37,422 --> 00:55:38,685
It's completely fine if you don't.

856
00:55:38,756 --> 00:55:40,053
It was just--
It was--

857
00:55:40,124 --> 00:55:41,592
Yeah. Okay.

858
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:43,917
Cool.

859
00:55:43,995 --> 00:55:44,985
Um, when?

860
00:55:46,731 --> 00:55:49,098
They're running some Hitchcock classics
at the old Astra.

861
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:51,101
I think tonight it's Strangers on a Train.

862
00:55:51,169 --> 00:55:52,159
Oh, what time is that?

863
00:55:52,237 --> 00:55:54,205
We're getting there about 7:30.

864
00:55:54,272 --> 00:55:55,330
"Ae"?

865
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:59,203
Oh, well, if you prefer
not to go with my friends--

866
00:55:59,277 --> 00:56:00,369
-No.
-that's all right.

867
00:56:00,445 --> 00:56:02,914
No, no, no, that--
that-- that would be--

868
00:56:02,981 --> 00:56:04,745
That would be awesome.
That would be great.

869
00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:06,807
So, I'll see you there, then.

870
00:56:06,885 --> 00:56:08,876
Yeah, you bet.

871
00:56:23,701 --> 00:56:25,726
Here goes the triple traitor to the king.

872
00:56:26,738 --> 00:56:28,069
[chuckles]

873
00:56:30,742 --> 00:56:31,834
Do you think she's still a virgin?

874
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:32,900
Why don't you fuck off.

875
00:56:32,977 --> 00:56:34,809
[chuckling]
Ohh...

876
00:56:34,879 --> 00:56:35,869
Jack.

877
00:56:37,415 --> 00:56:39,247
Thou lovest the wench.

878
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:44,919
I've got something for you.

879
00:56:46,424 --> 00:56:48,688
My name is Alex.

880
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,694
And will you stay away from me, please?

881
00:57:00,338 --> 00:57:02,329
[indistinct chatter]

882
00:57:14,185 --> 00:57:16,279
I've finished, sir.
Can I go, please?

883
00:57:18,056 --> 00:57:19,046
Headmaster?

884
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:23,018
No. He can wait until dinner is over.

885
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:24,152
But I--
I'm meant to be--

886
00:57:26,064 --> 00:57:27,190
Please.

887
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:29,256
Please.

888
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:53,787
Can I get a ticket, please?

889
00:58:28,993 --> 00:58:30,984
[wind blows, crow caws]

890
00:58:39,637 --> 00:58:42,072
[crow caws]

891
00:58:53,718 --> 00:58:54,776
[exhales sharply]

892
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:23,411
Not so much. Fine.
That's enough.

893
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:25,176
Stop.

894
00:59:25,249 --> 00:59:26,683
Hmm.

895
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:28,344
What's with the knife?

896
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:29,909
I don't know what you're talking about, Jack.

897
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:31,853
Will you stay out of my fucking room, please?

898
00:59:31,923 --> 00:59:34,517
Mmm. Have you read my book?

899
00:59:34,592 --> 00:59:36,026
No, I haven't read your fucking book.

900
00:59:37,261 --> 00:59:38,592
You should.

901
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:27,400
[coughs]

902
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:50,601
[inhales]

903
01:00:50,668 --> 01:00:52,136
[exhales]

904
01:00:53,804 --> 01:00:55,568
Boys,

905
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,338
members of staff...

906
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:02,539
I have some very unfortunate news to report.

907
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:05,715
Early this morning,

908
01:01:05,783 --> 01:01:11,222
Susan Mueller, a young lady
from Sansley College,

909
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:14,953
who was working with us on our final year play,

910
01:01:15,026 --> 01:01:17,723
was found...murdered.

911
01:01:18,729 --> 01:01:20,857
Not far from here.

912
01:01:22,133 --> 01:01:24,192
The police believe

913
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:28,330
that this vile act

914
01:01:28,406 --> 01:01:30,966
took place

915
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:33,067
while she was on her way home from rehearsal

916
01:01:33,144 --> 01:01:35,238
last night.

917
01:01:35,313 --> 01:01:38,476
So I'm afraid that all
members of the cast and crew

918
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:41,109
will remain behind after assembly,

919
01:01:41,185 --> 01:01:43,984
together with anyone who may have seen

920
01:01:44,055 --> 01:01:46,786
or spoken with Susan

921
01:01:46,857 --> 01:01:49,724
during the course of yesterday afternoon.

922
01:01:51,696 --> 01:01:53,630
That'll be all.

923
01:02:08,179 --> 01:02:11,410
[knocking]

924
01:02:14,518 --> 01:02:17,749
Raj. Raj.
Have you seen Nigel?

925
01:02:18,923 --> 01:02:19,913
No.

926
01:02:31,736 --> 01:02:34,706
[chattering]

927
01:02:41,779 --> 01:02:45,147
[clapping hands]
Pay attention.

928
01:02:45,216 --> 01:02:48,413
My name is Detective Inspector McKenzie.

929
01:02:48,486 --> 01:02:51,786
I'd like to talk to all of you individually, please.

930
01:02:51,856 --> 01:02:55,292
So could you give your names
to Constable Murray here.

931
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,488
Uh, we're gonna try and get through this
as quickly as possible,

932
01:02:58,562 --> 01:03:00,496
but please be patient.

933
01:03:17,682 --> 01:03:19,172
-Did you see her?
-Yes.

934
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,810
What time did you see her?

935
01:03:21,886 --> 01:03:23,945
Around noon.

936
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:27,013
And where was she in that time?

937
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:28,820
Passing by in the corridor.

938
01:03:28,893 --> 01:03:30,361
Which corridor?

939
01:03:30,428 --> 01:03:32,863
-The west side.
-And that was it?

940
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:34,989
-Yes.
-Okay. All right.

941
01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:36,397
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

942
01:03:39,637 --> 01:03:40,627
Alex Forbes.

943
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:04,119
-Did you talk to Susan yesterday?
-Yes.

944
01:04:06,163 --> 01:04:07,153
What time?

945
01:04:08,332 --> 01:04:09,959
I can't remember.

946
01:04:10,034 --> 01:04:11,433
Try.

947
01:04:14,805 --> 01:04:17,775
It was about 5.

948
01:04:17,842 --> 01:04:19,810
I was just packing up, so...

949
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:24,043
What did you talk about?

950
01:04:25,683 --> 01:04:27,913
I thought that she was really good,
so I told her that she was really good.

951
01:04:27,985 --> 01:04:31,114
-Really good?
-In the play.

952
01:04:31,188 --> 01:04:33,919
She was really good in the play, sir.

953
01:04:34,925 --> 01:04:36,051
What else?

954
01:04:37,995 --> 01:04:39,360
That was it.

955
01:04:41,098 --> 01:04:42,259
That's it?

956
01:04:43,434 --> 01:04:45,061
I think that was it.

957
01:04:46,804 --> 01:04:48,238
That's weird.

958
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:54,178
I have here that you were due to meet her

959
01:04:54,245 --> 01:04:56,236
at about 7:30 at the Astra.

960
01:04:57,815 --> 01:05:02,048
Because, according to her friends,
she kind of fancied you.

961
01:05:05,289 --> 01:05:07,849
What do you think about that?

962
01:05:12,196 --> 01:05:14,665
[sighs]
Well...

963
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:19,201
Looks like you both missed the film.

964
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,364
[pen scratching]

965
01:05:38,322 --> 01:05:39,312
Was that fun?

966
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,324
What'd you do with the knife?

967
01:05:41,392 --> 01:05:43,759
Ooh. I sense some hostility.

968
01:05:43,828 --> 01:05:45,922
Oh, do you reckon?

969
01:05:45,996 --> 01:05:48,988
Let's just call it fingerprint insurance.

970
01:05:49,066 --> 01:05:52,900
I'm gonna be late.
Do you think I should tell them?

971
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:56,770
I mean, you were
the last person to see her, Jack.

972
01:05:56,841 --> 01:05:58,468
That poor, fair maiden.

973
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:01,809
I can't believe what's happened.

974
01:06:03,347 --> 01:06:04,644
You did it, didn't you?

975
01:06:06,617 --> 01:06:09,211
No, Jack. You did it.

976
01:06:14,124 --> 01:06:17,424
How could you do this?
Fucking killed her.

977
01:06:18,762 --> 01:06:22,562
Feels good to vent one's anger,
doesn't it, Jack?

978
01:06:27,938 --> 01:06:30,339
I don't want any part of this.

979
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:32,136
Will you stop fucking calling me Jack?

980
01:06:33,777 --> 01:06:36,439
Well, I'm sorry, Jack, but you were
the one who got inside my head.

981
01:06:37,648 --> 01:06:38,945
Well, get out of mine.

982
01:06:39,016 --> 01:06:40,984
It's too late for that.

983
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:42,610
It's too late for a lot of things.

984
01:06:42,686 --> 01:06:47,123
I mean, before we met, we were incapable
of reaching our true potentials,

985
01:06:47,191 --> 01:06:52,061
but...but now...
I know you feel it.

986
01:06:54,999 --> 01:06:56,660
It's so invigorating.

987
01:06:59,737 --> 01:07:03,196
We make such a wonderful team.

988
01:07:31,569 --> 01:07:33,059
Inspector McKenzie.

989
01:07:34,972 --> 01:07:37,168
I'd like a word with you.

990
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:39,972
You shouldn't be here, Dr. Forbes.

991
01:07:40,044 --> 01:07:42,376
If you want to discuss Alex's case,
you can come to my office.

992

of a 13th-century Templar.

Her head had been placed below her pelvis,

01:32:28,964 --> 01:32:30,728
Just give it to me.
Don't come near-- Don't come--

1316
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,098
-Don't come near me! Stay where you are!
-No!

[breathes shakily]

1319
01:33:23,786 --> 01:33:26,847
Killing is such
an extraordinary feeling, isn't it?

1320
01:33:33,796 --> 01:33:35,628
I'll have my Maraclea.

1321
01:33:37,633 --> 01:33:39,226
How do you feel?

1322
01:33:41,303 --> 01:33:42,293
Jack?

1323
01:33:44,473 --> 01:33:45,634
How do you feel?

1324
01:33:51,313 --> 01:33:53,145
You set the whole thing up, didn't you?

1325
01:33:56,085 --> 01:33:57,109
[chuckles]

1326
01:33:58,521 --> 01:34:00,250
Come on.

1327
01:34:00,322 --> 01:34:01,812
We've got work to do.

1328

They're gone.

1331
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:52,504
I hated him.

1332
01:34:53,876 --> 01:34:55,867
Don't you think they're gonna be missed?

1333
01:34:57,213 --> 01:34:58,908
Well, as long as
they don't find her for nine months,

1334
01:34:58,981 --> 01:35:00,540
it really doesn't matter, does it?

1335
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:05,312
You didn't.

1336
01:35:06,989 --> 01:35:07,979
No. You didn't.

1337
01:35:09,892 --> 01:35:11,382
What do you think we're here for?

1338
01:35:13,395 --> 01:35:14,885
[whispering]
You're fucked.

1339
01:35:16,298 --> 01:35:17,732
You're absolutely fucked.

1340
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,359
And what about you and Susan?

1341
01:35:19,435 --> 01:35:20,425
I didn't do it.

1342
01:35:20,502 --> 01:35:21,799
Oh, come on.

1343
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:23,395
I left you with her.

1344
01:35:24,406 --> 01:35:25,737
I could smell you on her.

1345
01:35:25,808 --> 01:35:27,003
No.

1346
01:35:27,076 --> 01:35:28,339
Did you touch her?

1347
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:29,809
And then you felt her.

1348
01:35:29,878 --> 01:35:31,846
-No. No.
-It doesn't make any difference now.

1349
01:35:31,914 --> 01:35:33,575
-You can have your Maraclea.
-No.

1350
01:35:33,649 --> 01:35:36,016
A harvest widow awaits me here!

1351
01:35:36,085 --> 01:35:37,917
We will be united!

1352
01:35:43,926 --> 01:35:45,087
[quietly]
It's fated.

1353
01:36:06,949 --> 01:36:08,110
Jack!

1354
01:36:15,457 --> 01:36:16,891
It's over, Nigel.

1355
01:36:19,128 --> 01:36:21,597
It'll never be over.
You know that.

1356
01:36:23,299 --> 01:36:24,289
Do it.

1357
01:36:25,968 --> 01:36:27,197
Come on, do it.

1358
01:36:28,637 --> 01:36:29,695
Stop it, Jack.

1359
01:36:29,772 --> 01:36:30,762
Do it.

1360
01:36:31,774 --> 01:36:33,469
Stop walking away, Jack.

1361
01:36:33,542 --> 01:36:34,532
Do it!

1362
01:36:36,245 --> 01:36:37,337
Stay off the track.

1363
01:36:39,648 --> 01:36:40,911
Do it!

1364
01:36:40,983 --> 01:36:43,077
I showed you the card, remember.

1365
01:36:43,152 --> 01:36:44,881
It's written for eternity.

1366
01:36:44,953 --> 01:36:46,944
Shut your face!

[train whistle]

Do it! Do it!

01:36:51,593 --> 01:36:53,083
No! Don't!

1370
01:36:53,162 --> 01:36:55,790
Look, we're not Templars with God-given
rights!

1371
01:36:55,864 --> 01:36:58,094
There are no Holy Wars to fight, Nigel!

1372
01:36:58,167 --> 01:37:00,158
Who's the enemy now?

1373
01:37:00,235 --> 01:37:01,794
We are...

1374
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:02,928
because...

1375
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:07,435
...because we wanted more
from life than it has to offer.

1376
01:37:07,509 --> 01:37:08,772
You're deluded.

1377
01:37:08,844 --> 01:37:10,437
Why?

1378
01:37:10,512 --> 01:37:13,174
Why am I deluded?
This is our fate.

1379
01:37:13,248 --> 01:37:14,682
Now, just shut the fuck up!

1380
01:37:17,686 --> 01:37:18,915
-Pray for me.
-What are you doing?

1381
01:37:18,987 --> 01:37:20,546
Pray for yourself.

1382
01:37:20,622 --> 01:37:22,613
We're one now.

1383

What follows

1389
01:39:04,259 --> 01:39:05,249
through a system

1390
01:39:05,327 --> 01:39:06,317
of either intimidation,

1391
01:39:06,395 --> 01:39:08,329
manipulation, or coercion,

1392
01:39:08,397 --> 01:39:09,831
is the dominant individual

1393
01:39:09,898 --> 01:39:12,060
begins to focus and influence the thoughts

1394
01:39:12,134 --> 01:39:13,693
of the subordinate partner.

1395
01:39:13,769 --> 01:39:16,704
This process nurtures a subjective gestalt

1396
01:39:16,772 --> 01:39:20,606
where similar thoughts, fantasies,
and other interlocking elements

1397
01:39:20,676 --> 01:39:23,873
conspire to form
a greater and more volatile hold,

1398
01:39:23,946 --> 01:39:27,246
therefore a merging of like minds.

1399
01:39:27,316 --> 01:39:28,750
Thank you.

Eternity.

You will.

You will.
