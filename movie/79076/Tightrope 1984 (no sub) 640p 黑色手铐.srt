1
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,561
- Come on!
- You can blow better than that!

2
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:38,796
Blow it!

3
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,716
You all right, miss?

4
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,724
I thought someone was following me.

5
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:08,228
Would you like me
to walk you home?

6
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,970
I live right there.

7
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,983
Could you watch
to make sure I get in?

8
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:15,901
Sure.

9
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:03,098
Hey, Dad.

10
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:11,547
Is he all right?

11
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,082
Well, I don't know.
He hasn't got a collar.

12
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,418
Looks like he's kind of hungry.

13
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:21,306
Can we keep him?

14
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:25,013
I don't know, honey. Maybe we ought
to take him to the pound.

15
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:27,255
They'll find him a good home.

16
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:30,419
What happens if they don't?

17
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:41,395
<i>There's a big turnout for Monday Night
Football at the Superdome. New Orleans...</i>

18
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:43,953
Hey, you know who should
be quarterbacking tonight?

19
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,434
- Stabler.
- Me.

20
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:47,866
We'll be ready to go in two minutes.

21
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:52,592
<i>Stabler, still suffering from bruised
ribs and coming off a big game...</i>

22
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:56,179
<i>... in a losing effort against
the Buccaneers last week.</i>

23
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:59,642
<i>The Saints out-gained
Tampa Bay by 100 yards...</i>

24
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:02,290
Here you are, partner.

25
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:23,887
Damn it.

26
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,518
Yeah?

27
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:30,164
Right.

28
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,766
Sorry, girls.

29
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:22,440
- Any ID?
- A purse.

30
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:50,252
- What do you think?
- I think she died on the bed.

31
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:54,254
She couldn't have been killed
in here and dragged in there?

32
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,685
Possible, but not likely.

33
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:57,860
What time, about?

34
00:07:58,031 --> 00:08:03,148
Well, from the rigor mortis and body
temp, about 18 to 20 hours ago.

35
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:18,150
<i>Hi, honey. We just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.</i>

36
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:20,685
<i>Dad yelled
to say he loves you.</i>

37
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:24,522
<i>We're excited you'll be
home for the weekend. Bye, dear.</i>

38
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:32,971
He says she died 18 to 20 hours ago. That
would've made it no sooner than midnight.

39
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:34,179
So what?

40
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:38,439
That clock looked like it was broke
in the struggle. If it says 9:15...

41
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,801
...why wasn't she killed
until midnight?

42
00:08:42,283 --> 00:08:45,632
Maybe someone wanted
three hours with her first.

43
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:52,447
I want everybody on this block
interviewed. That's the neighbors...

44
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,724
...mailmen, garbage people.

45
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,592
In fact, I want every garbage can and every
sewer looked into for a five-block radius.

46
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:11,461
You think it brings the crazies out?

47
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,654
They're always out.

48
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,549
Good evening, Mrs. Holstein.
How are those kids?

49
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:26,534
Fine, they're asleep.

50
00:10:22,434 --> 00:10:24,321
Jesus.

51
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:31,129
Death came from strangulation.
Ligature marks on her throat...

52
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,053
...and hemorrhages around her neck.

53
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:36,217
There are also two parallel, slightly
indented marks on her wrists.

54
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,621
- From what?
- Handcuffs, possibly.

55
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:42,013
There are bruises on her arms and shoulder
blades from being pinned to the floor.

56
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,542
And what looks
like a knee-bruise on her chest.

57
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:48,729
Before she died, she was
penetrated both vaginally and anally.

58
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:51,486
- What time did she die?
- Close to midnight.

59
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:55,422
- You sure?
- She ate a piece of banana cake at 7:00.

60
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,844
Then, over the next hour and a half,
consumed eight ounces of white wine.

61
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,184
Chardonnay, I believe.

62
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,888
Then finished at 9:00 with a small amount
of Swiss vanilla almond ice cream.

63
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,022
Anything else, detective?

64
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:13,491
Take a look.

65
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,891
First one is a human scalp hair.

66
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:20,210
The bulbous portion of the root is still
attached, meaning it was wrenched out.

67
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,122
The next one, the tapered one,
is an eyebrow hair.

68
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,634
And the one
at the bottom is a pubic hair.

69
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:31,926
- All from the same person?
- Dark-haired Caucasian.

70
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,182
- Probably male, probably in his 40s.
- You're really nailing him down for me.

71
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:40,208
- What more do you want?
- His phone number and address.

72
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:42,069
His semen.

73
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:47,320
- What blood type?
- O. Just like the night before last.

74
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:51,126
This is a common, everyday rayon
and acetate fiber.

75
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:54,584
I found it sticking to the back
of Melanie Silber's neck.

76
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:58,607
And I found this one
under Yvonne Larkin's fingernail.

77
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,826
You know, the killer didn't leave
any prints this time either.

78
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:08,148
Every print in the bedroom matched Melanie
Silber's. But there's one thing I don't get.

79
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,456
What?

80
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:12,468
There was a cup on the dresser
with traces of coffee.

81
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:16,886
- There weren't any prints on it.
- I saw it. So what?

82
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:20,848
Why would he take the time
to drink a cup of coffee?

83
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,787
He was starting to enjoy himself.

84
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:33,198
Wes, Beryl Thibodeaux from the rape
something-or-other wants to see you.

85
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:35,372
- Where is she?
- The reception room.

86
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,257
- Tell her I'm out.
- I did. She said she'd wait.

87
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,809
Good. Tell her I'm out of town.

88
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,819
Welcome back.

89
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:48,909
Thanks.

90
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,528
I've tried calling you five times.

91
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:54,477
Sorry.

92
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:57,449
Look, I'm not particularly eager to...

93
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:00,269
...talk to women who go around
with chips on their shoulders...

94
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:04,046
...tell everybody I'm doing a lousy job
and get everybody pissed off at me.

95
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,117
I wouldn't be eager
to talk to them either.

96
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,366
I'm really not eager to talk to cops
who have a chip on their shoulders...

97
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:15,661
...stereotype women from rape centers
and then go to any length to avoid them.

98
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:18,760
I'm sure you don't care
for those kinds of cops either.

99
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:23,401
Another woman was strangled
last night.

100
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,990
Now, we're concerned
it could be the same killer.

101
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,615
- Why?
- Because she was killed in the same way.

102
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:32,078
And also because we heard a rumor
the murders might be connected.

103
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:36,554
- Well, you know how it is with rumors.
- But it could be the same person.

104
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,839
- That possibility always exists.
- Do you have any evidence?

105
00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:43,756
I'm not at liberty to discuss evidence
in this case.

106
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,115
Have you been able to establish
a link between the victims?

107
00:13:47,598 --> 00:13:49,802
I can't discuss that either.
I'm sorry.

108
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:54,602
Look, all I'm asking is to be involved
in the investigation, all right?

109
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,187
Maybe we could put
up some warning posters.

110
00:13:57,613 --> 00:14:01,126
That say what? That some nut's going
around the city strangling women?

111
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:04,162
- Yeah, why not?
- Because we're not sure it's true.

112
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,049
All it would do is terrify women
all over this city.

113
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:09,250
Well, maybe it should.

114
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,537
Did you brush your teeth?

115
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:50,758
Well, you better get going.

116
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,310
Give your dad a smack.

117
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,766
Bye-bye, baby.

118
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:13,222
Come on, kids.
We got a big day.

119
00:15:48,963 --> 00:15:52,574
- You want some honey?
- I don't eat sweets.

120
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,349
Do you eat drumsticks, mister?

121
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,475
- Need any help?
- Not on this one.

122
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:27,677
Who is it?

123
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:36,796
May I come in?

124
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:47,863
I heard you two worked together.

125
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,675
Doing what?

126
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:53,497
As a sandwich.

127
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,962
One on the top and the other
on the bottom.

128
00:16:56,221 --> 00:17:00,955
Well, what else did you hear?

129
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:04,534
That you liked it.

130
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,627
That you liked her,
but she split on you.

131
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:13,781
She developed a taste for cops.

132
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,916
She get close to any?

133
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:20,631
Cops don't get close to anybody.

134
00:17:23,513 --> 00:17:25,749
Any of them come on to her?

135
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,399
They kept coming...

136
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:39,029
...and coming.
That's the funny thing about cops.

137
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:47,887
You take a cop whose wife splits...

138
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,020
...sooner...

139
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,637
...or later...

140
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:02,323
...that cop...

141
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:08,370
...will react like anybody else.

142
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:15,888
He'll start doing things...

143
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:20,043
...he wouldn't have done before.

144
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:31,818
So, Block...

145
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:39,216
...what happened to the rest
of the sandwich?

146
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:56,969
Somebody ate it.

147
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:34,214
You're 10 minutes late.

148
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,164
Yeah. Ten minutes
after he's down there...

149
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:40,838
...he won't know the difference between
the big hand and the little hand.

150
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,017
Promise?

151
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,669
Trust me.

152
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,080
You're still awake.

153
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:25,025
- What's the matter?
- Can't sleep.

154
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:32,987
- Where did you go?
- To his house.

155
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:36,988
- What's it like?
- Big.

156
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:42,912
- She ask about me?
- No, but I told her about you anyway.

157
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:46,713
Where did you go tonight?

158
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:50,646
Out to look for something.

159
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,570
Did you find it?

160
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:57,561
I found out one thing.
You know what it is?

161
00:21:57,728 --> 00:22:00,695
That you should be in bed,
getting some sleep.

162
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:16,754
Hello?

163
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:34,739
- It looks like the same method.
- Go ahead.

164
00:22:34,908 --> 00:22:36,817
So how old is this one?

165
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:42,549
He found her.

166
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:46,064
- Do you filter on that drain?
- Yeah.

167
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:48,147
Empty it.

168
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,485
How long has she been in here?

169
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,616
About an hour.

170
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,185
- Anybody in here with her?
- Not that I saw.

171
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:39,504
From the hot tub's drain.

172
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,426
And this is the brownie found
in Melanie Silber's apartment.

173
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:47,117
This is the mold
I made from her teeth.

174
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:49,968
The mold doesn't match
the impression.

175
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:53,994
I'll coat the bite mark pattern
on the brownie and run it under the SEM.

176
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:57,197
We might get a reading
that'll match the killer's teeth.

177
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,889
Thirty calls already, three from
a Beryl Thibodeaux at the Rape Center.

178
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:08,144
Check on the specific days of the crimes,
meteorological reports, phases of the moon.

179
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:13,325
Would you check CID and find out for
similar m.o.'s? And check all 42s in the area.

180
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,239
Get a tail on that hot-tub guy,
would you?

181
00:24:16,882 --> 00:24:19,915
Check out all sexual arrests
in the town for the last two weeks.

182
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:24,337
That goes for somebody who's been humping
sheep to some guy who's swinging his dick.

183
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:26,985
- You got it.
- Here's the file.

184
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:30,032
Here he comes, Tim.

185
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,664
Detective Block,
are the murders connected?

186
00:24:35,088 --> 00:24:39,496
Yes, we believe that the murders
were committed by the same killer.

187
00:24:39,663 --> 00:24:45,359
So far, the victims have all been women
linked to unusual or aberrant sexual activity.

188
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,064
We recommend, however, that all
women exercise extreme caution...

189
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:51,686
...until this killer is apprehended.

190
00:24:52,623 --> 00:24:53,571
Thank you.

191
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,459
- Do you have any clues?
- I can't talk about it.

192
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:09,059
What's a hard-on, Daddy?

193
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:13,770
I heard Amanda say it,
and she won't tell me what it means.

194
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:21,313
Well, darling, it's...

195
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:23,044
It's...

196
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:26,953
When a man is attracted
to a woman...

197
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:29,254
...he likes her.

198
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,288
- Understand?
- No.

199
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:37,673
Well, he likes her in a certain way.

200
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:40,424
Why?

201
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:45,251
Well, sweetheart, male bears
like female bears and...

202
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:49,024
...male bees like female bees...

203
00:25:49,193 --> 00:25:51,364
...and occasionally they get together...

204
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:53,023
Dad...

205
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:56,071
...forget it.

206
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:31,421
You recognize this?

207
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:37,563
- Why should I?
- You drew it.

208
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:40,894
- So what?
- Well, tell me about it.

209
00:26:42,532 --> 00:26:46,939
Jamie Cory, she come here one day
saying this hot-tub guy beat her up.

210
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:50,622
She wanted a tattoo,
so I did it.

211
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:55,134
Well, the hot-tub guy says she came
down here and you beat her up.

212
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:58,810
Do I look like the kind of guy
who'd do something like that?

213
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,599
Yeah.

214
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:05,815
You ever heard of a girl
named Melanie Silber?

215
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:10,560
Yeah, I like to beat her up too.

216
00:27:11,201 --> 00:27:13,852
You know, everybody's looking
to get beat up.

217
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,551
- What's your name?
- Block.

218
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,168
You're hanging out
with the wrong kind of people, Block.

219
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:29,111
What kind would you suggest
I hang out with?

220
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:31,608
Someone who's more...

221
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:33,978
...up your alley.

222
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,403
Maybe I'll take you
up on that sometime.

223
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,417
And do what?

224
00:27:40,255 --> 00:27:42,840
Take you bowling?

225
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:46,071
I don't like bowling.

226
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,219
Neither do I.

227
00:28:18,618 --> 00:28:20,112
Tequila.

228
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:30,570
- How you doing, Shorty?
- Hello.

229
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,766
- You know Jamie Cory?
- Sure, she wrestled here last night.

230
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:37,164
You know much about her?

231
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:40,399
Not as much as I'd have liked to.

232
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:44,010
Try the blonde with the big bazookas.

233
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:24,554
- Ice?
- What for?

234
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,911
You didn't mention you knew her.

235
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,671
You didn't ask.

236
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:33,515
Besides, I thought you came here...

237
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:35,916
...to bowl.

238
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,149
You recall seeing her
with anyone last night?

239
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,986
- Yeah. There were a couple of guys.
- Who?

240
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:46,946
Customers.
You know, guys trying to hit on her.

241
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,285
She let any of them?

242
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,115
- No. She thought they were creeps.
- What about other nights?

243
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:59,234
If she liked someone,
she might've done something about it.

244
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:02,884
But by and large, just one-night stands?

245
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:05,506
Are there any other kind?

246
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,877
And you two knew each other very well?

247
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,758
Well enough.

248
00:31:16,778 --> 00:31:20,706
Did she ever mention anything
about anybody using handcuffs on her?

249
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:27,011
I think so.
She liked to get pretty kinky.

250
00:31:28,232 --> 00:31:30,785
Remember who it might've been?

251
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:35,167
I think it was a cop.

252
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:39,425
Who knows? Maybe it was you.

253
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:20,377
Can I help with anything?

254
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:34,810
Dad, how come you have to work
so late every night?

255
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:40,499
Well, there's been three murders, hon.

256
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:43,699
Couldn't you just work during the day?

257
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:49,076
Some people I can only see at night.

258
00:33:49,915 --> 00:33:51,922
What kind of people?

259
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,384
People that don't have day jobs.

260
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:04,981
Dad?

261
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,688
Could you get hurt?

262
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:20,053
Tell me, Wes, how's things at home?

263
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:22,893
What do you mean?

264
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:26,804
I mean, I'm not sure yet you're ready
to run this task force.

265
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:30,960
Beryl Thibodeaux talked to the mayor
about you, and he called me.

266
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:36,145
He said if I don't come up with something
soon, he's gonna start shitting all over me.

267
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:41,679
Shit runs downhill, Wes.

268
00:34:43,254 --> 00:34:44,977
Yeah.

269
00:34:45,973 --> 00:34:48,340
No! Louder.

270
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:51,316
No! Again.

271
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:52,938
No!

272
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:54,091
Stop!

273
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,515
- Again.
- Stop!

274
00:34:57,877 --> 00:34:59,786
- No!
- One more time.

275
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:02,346
- Stop!
- All right.

276
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:08,266
Now, in most of the situations
you'll encounter...

277
00:35:09,683 --> 00:35:14,800
...you will have several options.
Most important, don't stop thinking.

278
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:20,813
He's counting on you going catatonic and
being petrified with fear and surrendering.

279
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:22,439
Keep thinking.

280
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,472
First, you could try
and reason with him.

281
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:30,703
Now, if that doesn't work,
blow your whistle. Start yelling.

282
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:33,800
The yell we've just learned, yell it out.

283
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:38,191
I mean, don't forget he's got his adrenaline
going. You make sure you pump up yours.

284
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:43,751
At this point, our goal
is to disable your attacker.

285
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,011
Now, several ways of sending
him a message are:

286
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:51,303
Stomping on his toes.

287
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,118
Scratching his eyes.

288
00:35:55,311 --> 00:36:00,362
Hitting this vital point
here in the throat.

289
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:03,210
Kicking into his kneecaps.

290
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:06,374
Striking his solar plexus.

291
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:09,990
And if he still keeps on acting tacky...

292
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:13,289
...well then, you can always drop back...

293
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,591
...and punt.

294
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:23,626
Hi.

295
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:37,443
I'll bet you were just about to knock.

296
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:41,857
Actually, I was just gonna
hang out here and be tacky.

297
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:48,647
Tell me, Detective Blot...

298
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:51,075
Block.

299
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,518
Wes Block.

300
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:55,714
- How do you like the Rape Center?
- I love it.

301
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:59,143
Would you care to make
a charitable donation?

302
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:02,689
- Any reason I should?
- Yeah.

303
00:37:02,857 --> 00:37:04,450
Maybe...

304
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:06,307
Maybe I'll talk about the mayor.

305
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,125
Yeah, I hear you go out with him.

306
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:12,002
Once in a while.

307
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,532
I hear he's gay.

308
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,636
You like a date with him?

309
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:20,192
Well, I would like him off my back.

310
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,635
Oh, don't tell me he's interrupted
your busy schedule.

311
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:26,496
Awful, ain't it?

312
00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:30,687
Yeah, well maybe you should've told him
you were out of town.

313
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,211
Listen, I called him...

314
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:43,585
...because I'm playing by your rules.
Now, if you'd help me, I'd like to help you.

315
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:51,739
The killer's a Caucasian,
blood type o...

316
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:55,901
...about in his mid-40s. We found traces
of a red fiber on all the victims.

317
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,362
From what?

318
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:01,662
We don't know.

319
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:08,252
- Any suspects?
- About 120,000 of them.

320
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:11,969
Anything you'd like me to tell the mayor?

321
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:15,707
Yeah. He's one of them.

322
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,175
Daddy!

323
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,007
Hi, pumpkin!

324
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:40,630
- Am I heavy?
- Not to me, you're not.

325
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:43,220
I weigh 50 now.

326
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:47,228
- I missed you.
- Well, I missed you too, sweetheart.

327
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:51,995
I tried to call a lot, but the phone's been
busy. You and your sister sure are gabby.

328
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,900
Did your mother call?

329
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,396
- Hi.
- Hi.

330
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,468
Mind if I have one?

331
00:39:10,812 --> 00:39:13,048
I heard you had a phone call.

332
00:39:13,756 --> 00:39:16,025
She's getting married.

333
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:20,822
She wants us to come to the wedding.

334
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:25,072
She also said something
about having us come live with her.

335
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:29,209
- Could she do that?
- I don't know, baby.

336
00:39:30,683 --> 00:39:33,071
I used to make these for her.

337
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:37,689
- I know.
- But I like making them for you better.

338
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,062
Seen any of these?

339
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,715
No.

340
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:06,326
No. Too bad.

341
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:10,895
Yeah. I've seen her in here before.

342
00:40:11,447 --> 00:40:13,683
Anybody ever get violent
with her?

343
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:17,327
That's part of the turn-on, isn't it?

344
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:19,565
You know who it was?

345
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,674
No.

346
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:29,428
Hey, what about you?
You ever see her in here before?

347
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:32,496
No.

348
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,640
You recognize her?

349
00:41:14,832 --> 00:41:16,621
No.

350
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,032
Why don't you come on in?

351
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:35,243
Close the door.

352
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:45,973
- When did they find it?
- About 20 minutes ago.

353
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:01,839
What's up?

354
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:04,596
Smudge marks
from Melanie Silber's bedroom.

355
00:45:04,762 --> 00:45:08,340
- Can you tell anything?
- Yeah. It's mostly good old dirt.

356
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:12,117
- What about this morning?
- There were cuff marks on her wrists.

357
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,789
Anything else?

358
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,470
This.

359
00:45:31,352 --> 00:45:35,126
Struck out with the hot-tub guy.
Wrong blood type.

360
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:38,103
- Maybe we should...
- What was her name?

361
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:40,526
Who?

362
00:45:41,015 --> 00:45:43,252
The girl at the river.

363
00:45:43,927 --> 00:45:46,741
Judy Harper, a nurse.

364
00:45:55,477 --> 00:45:57,997
Every mass murderer has a motive, Wes.

365
00:45:58,165 --> 00:46:01,907
It could be as bizarre as voices
commanding him to kill.

366
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:05,298
The voices could come from God
or from the refrigerator.

367
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:09,617
Or it could be as simple as anger,
frustration, revenge.

368
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,325
That's why he uses handcuffs
on the women.

369
00:46:14,036 --> 00:46:16,523
- Has he contacted you?
- No.

370
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:20,107
- I wouldn't be surprised if he did.
- Why?

371
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:24,457
Once you started going after him,
you became closer to him than anyone else.

372
00:46:24,626 --> 00:46:28,238
Unless there's another psychopath
out doing the same thing.

373
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,940
I'm not sure how close I wanna get.

374
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,199
There's a darkness inside all of us, Wes.

375
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,184
You, me and the man
down the street.

376
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,409
Some have it under control.
Others act it out.

377
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:46,603
The rest of us try to walk a tightrope
between the two.

378
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:57,311
Wanna go hoist some oysters?

379
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:06,683
- I've never seen you work out there before.
- I came there looking for you.

380
00:49:07,492 --> 00:49:10,590
- They found another body.
- I know.

381
00:49:10,755 --> 00:49:14,137
- Sorry about it.
- Well, why tell me?

382
00:49:14,307 --> 00:49:16,762
I didn't know who else to tell.

383
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,489
You didn't have to bring me here
to tell me that.

384
00:49:34,657 --> 00:49:36,282
No.

385
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:41,340
- Thank you.
- So why did you?

386
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,797
Well, I saw you working out in that gym.

387
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,643
I was wondering what you'd be like.

388
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:52,602
Why the sudden interest?

389
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:58,520
I was wondering if you came alone.

390
00:49:59,294 --> 00:50:01,366
What else were you wondering?

391
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,885
You really wanna know?

392
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:08,061
Yeah.

393
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:11,705
What it would be like...

394
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:14,965
...to lick the sweat off your body.

395
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,535
Do you...?

396
00:50:24,892 --> 00:50:27,194
Do you always say
exactly what's on your mind?

397
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:29,684
You don't like it?

398
00:50:30,491 --> 00:50:32,728
It could be a little more subtle.

399
00:50:33,147 --> 00:50:35,034
What I said?

400
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:38,233
More the way you said it.

401
00:50:38,491 --> 00:50:40,346
How would you like me to say it?

402
00:50:40,698 --> 00:50:44,113
As if you're not saying it
to somebody every night.

403
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:47,093
What else would you like?

404
00:50:47,258 --> 00:50:51,218
I'd like to find out what's underneath
the front you put on.

405
00:50:55,929 --> 00:51:00,784
- Maybe you wouldn't like what you'd find.
- Maybe you're scared I would.

406
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,780
- You're not married, are you?
- What makes you say that?

407
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,772
Just a hunch.

408
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,414
You hear the one about the cop
whose wife left him a note...

409
00:51:26,582 --> 00:51:29,615
...saying she'd fallen in love
with anyone else?

410
00:51:30,806 --> 00:51:35,627
- Your wife leave you a note?
- No, she left me two kids.

411
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:40,396
- Where is she now?
- Still here in New orleans.

412
00:51:42,293 --> 00:51:44,016
You ever thought of moving away?

413
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:48,686
No. Twenty-eight years ago,
I borrowed $40 from my father...

414
00:51:48,852 --> 00:51:52,397
...packed up an old, beat-up suitcase,
took a bus and came here.

415
00:51:52,563 --> 00:51:55,018
I was 17 at the time.

416
00:51:55,315 --> 00:51:59,592
I walked down through the French quarter,
looked out over the Mississippi...

417
00:51:59,763 --> 00:52:01,356
...and swore I'd never leave.

418
00:52:01,523 --> 00:52:04,392
- Ever come close?
- Only once.

419
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:07,726
When I looked down
and saw that suitcase missing.

420
00:52:08,306 --> 00:52:10,477
Have you ever been married?

421
00:52:10,642 --> 00:52:13,489
- Nope.
- How come?

422
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:18,278
I guess I haven't met the right man.

423
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,796
Maybe I scared him away.

424
00:52:22,961 --> 00:52:25,579
Then he definitely wasn't the right man.

425
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:32,266
- My mother thinks it's my job.
- What do you think?

426
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:36,903
- Doesn't matter. I like what I do.
- Helping women?

427
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,748
Oh, men too.

428
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:42,727
What makes you so sure they need it?

429
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,259
We all need it.

430
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:58,851
Okay, gals, come on. Wake up. Come on.
We're gonna go back to our own beds now.

431
00:52:59,021 --> 00:53:00,908
- Hi, Dad.
- Where you been?

432
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:03,883
Get Dad. Come on. Get on my back.

433
00:53:05,037 --> 00:53:07,175
Your dad had a date tonight.

434
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,031
Who with?

435
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,267
Somebody he met.

436
00:53:11,436 --> 00:53:13,737
- Where'd you go?
- Out on the river.

437
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,103
- Is she nice?
- Oh, yeah.

438
00:53:16,268 --> 00:53:18,504
- Do you like her?
- Yeah, she's nice.

439
00:53:18,667 --> 00:53:21,962
- Did you kiss her?
- Hey, come on. Give me a break, will you?

440
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:24,966
I bet that's her right now.

441
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:30,662
And she wants to see you again. And you
can have a hard-on anytime you want.

442
00:53:41,577 --> 00:53:44,327
"Another one will soon be dead.

443
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,944
You could stop it
if you knew what was ahead."

444
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:50,271
Think it's from a crank?

445
00:53:52,168 --> 00:53:53,793
No.

446
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:59,874
Sam's. What's that?

447
00:54:05,415 --> 00:54:07,455
I'm Sam.

448
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,978
You're strong.

449
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:54,871
I love being punished by a strong man.

450
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:03,132
He said you'd want this.

451
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:07,321
- What for?
- Me.

452
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:09,206
He's wrong.

453
00:55:14,016 --> 00:55:16,220
He said you were just like him.

454
00:55:16,384 --> 00:55:18,239
Who's he?

455
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,247
Use the whip.

456
00:55:33,662 --> 00:55:35,320
You're...

457
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:38,236
You're to wear this to Praline's.

458
00:55:41,822 --> 00:55:43,927
I don't know who he is.

459
00:56:14,362 --> 00:56:16,085
Dixie.

460
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:20,053
Looking for something...

461
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:22,358
...Alice?

462
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:01,326
He said this was your first time.

463
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,401
- Who?
- You don't know?

464
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:09,651
- He bought me for you.
- You've seen him?

465
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:13,100
When was he supposed to pay you?

466
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:17,360
Right after this at the old warehouse
across the street.

467
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:25,322
Well, you go on over to that warehouse
and collect your money.

468
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,653
- You don't want it?
- No.

469
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,721
He said you did.
You just don't know it yet.

470
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:34,412
Well, he's wrong.

471
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:38,092
How do you know if you haven't tried it?

472
00:57:38,675 --> 00:57:40,431
Maybe I have.

473
00:57:45,906 --> 00:57:49,288
I'm at a warehouse at 1460 Water.

474
01:00:57,503 --> 01:01:00,350
We searched the whole warehouse.
He's gone.

475
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:04,027
- The saliva on the stamps tested...
- Blood type o.

476
01:01:04,191 --> 01:01:05,173
Right.

477
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:07,676
The notes are from...

478
01:01:08,158 --> 01:01:11,474
...a '72 olivetti. The letters E
and S are worn down.

479
01:01:11,646 --> 01:01:14,907
The K is misaligned.
That's all I can tell.

480
01:01:15,069 --> 01:01:18,681
- What about the red ribbon?
- Same as the fibers from the other victims.

481
01:01:25,276 --> 01:01:27,643
"...if you knew what's ahead."

482
01:02:55,924 --> 01:02:57,549
Becky?

483
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,851
Becky?

484
01:03:24,465 --> 01:03:26,156
Becky?

485
01:03:54,287 --> 01:03:56,196
She could still be alive.

486
01:03:58,574 --> 01:04:00,396
Couldn't she?

487
01:04:09,485 --> 01:04:11,307
Still no sign?

488
01:04:11,725 --> 01:04:13,612
It won't be long.

489
01:04:16,972 --> 01:04:18,565
Any luck with him?

490
01:04:18,892 --> 01:04:20,266
No.

491
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,827
You're letting him go?

492
01:04:23,756 --> 01:04:25,185
Yeah.

493
01:04:26,923 --> 01:04:29,160
I heard you knew her too.

494
01:04:30,891 --> 01:04:32,036
That's right.

495
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:37,828
Just out of curiosity, Wes, did you happen
to know any of the other victims?

496
01:04:43,082 --> 01:04:44,772
No.

497
01:05:03,336 --> 01:05:04,830
Alex?

498
01:05:05,863 --> 01:05:08,613
Do you have someone
who could drive by my house?

499
01:05:08,968 --> 01:05:10,342
Your kids?

500
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,662
- Yeah.
- Sure.

501
01:07:19,675 --> 01:07:22,806
You remember the smudge marks
in Melanie Silber's bedroom?

502
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:25,239
- The killer made them.
- How do you know?

503
01:07:25,402 --> 01:07:29,296
Because they have the same chemical
composition as particles on that doll.

504
01:07:29,466 --> 01:07:32,727
- Any idea what they are?
- Some kind of glass fragments...

505
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:35,061
...coated with a barley residue.

506
01:07:35,226 --> 01:07:39,382
- Where could they come from?
- Who knows? Maybe a grain storage bin.

507
01:07:39,545 --> 01:07:43,122
He must've picked up the fragments
in the treads of his tennis shoes.

508
01:07:43,288 --> 01:07:45,263
He wore tennis shoes?

509
01:07:45,816 --> 01:07:48,336
By tomorrow,
I might even know the make.

510
01:07:54,743 --> 01:07:58,420
- Hello?
- Hi. Can I see you tonight?

511
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:02,382
- I've got some work.
- Can it wait?

512
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:05,099
Are you okay?

513
01:08:07,828 --> 01:08:09,486
I don't know.

514
01:10:09,928 --> 01:10:12,481
They found one of the bodies
near here.

515
01:10:12,648 --> 01:10:14,240
I know.

516
01:10:14,696 --> 01:10:18,373
- They're getting closer.
- Closer to what?

517
01:10:18,536 --> 01:10:20,062
To me.

518
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:25,820
Boo!

519
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:31,101
Do you investigate
many sexual crimes?

520
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,797
Why?

521
01:10:34,213 --> 01:10:36,995
I was wondering
if they've had any effect on you.

522
01:10:38,502 --> 01:10:42,298
Well, they did make me want
to treat my wife a little more tenderly.

523
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,512
How did she respond?

524
01:10:45,957 --> 01:10:49,022
She said she wasn't
interested in tenderness.

525
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:57,689
They're nice kids.

526
01:10:57,859 --> 01:11:01,536
Yeah, they're about the only thing
in my life I haven't screwed up.

527
01:11:01,699 --> 01:11:04,186
Well, some people
don't even have that.

528
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:13,982
Why didn't your wife take them
when she left?

529
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:17,818
Because they're a part
of what she left.

530
01:11:19,329 --> 01:11:21,336
What did you tell them?

531
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:25,974
I didn't tell them anything.
They already knew.

532
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,331
Do they get jealous
when you bring a woman over?

533
01:11:36,736 --> 01:11:38,591
I don't bring a woman home.

534
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,338
How about that woman
you just bumped into?

535
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:45,397
She's just sort of a friend.

536
01:11:46,527 --> 01:11:51,644
That kind of friend have anything
to do with your wife leaving?

537
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:56,060
I made those kind of friends
after she left.

538
01:11:57,086 --> 01:11:59,573
Can we come back
tomorrow night, Daddy?

539
01:11:59,934 --> 01:12:02,421
We'll talk about that later.

540
01:12:06,397 --> 01:12:08,306
I want a balloon.

541
01:12:08,636 --> 01:12:10,425
Here, I got it.

542
01:12:11,005 --> 01:12:13,143
Here you are.

543
01:12:18,076 --> 01:12:19,832
Yeah.

544
01:12:31,003 --> 01:12:32,279
Come on.

545
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,100
Dad?

546
01:13:05,271 --> 01:13:07,954
Beryl's nice.
She's pretty too. Don't you think?

547
01:13:08,119 --> 01:13:09,679
Yeah.

548
01:13:09,847 --> 01:13:11,702
I can tell she wants
to see you again.

549
01:13:11,863 --> 01:13:13,805
You can, can you?

550
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:17,007
If I were you, I'd ask her out
this weekend.

551
01:13:17,174 --> 01:13:19,029
You would, would you?

552
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:21,163
Dad...

553
01:13:21,558 --> 01:13:25,551
...find out if she likes dogs.
- Oh, of course.

554
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:31,121
You'll have to excuse the mess.

555
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:36,275
Well, you should see
my place sometimes.

556
01:13:37,684 --> 01:13:40,718
I don't exactly have
a lot of help around here.

557
01:13:53,618 --> 01:13:57,774
Now, why do you think
he uses handcuffs?

558
01:13:58,034 --> 01:13:59,943
Control?

559
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:03,879
Do you use them very often?

560
01:14:06,673 --> 01:14:08,331
Well, that depends.

561
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:11,436
On what?

562
01:14:12,017 --> 01:14:13,991
The situation.

563
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,008
When you feel
you are threatened?

564
01:14:20,624 --> 01:14:22,511
Yeah, you could say that.

565
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:29,415
With these,
no one can get to you.

566
01:14:30,063 --> 01:14:32,648
They'll stop just about anyone.

567
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,693
From Jamie Cory's clothing.

568
01:16:27,748 --> 01:16:30,115
We traced the serial numbers.

569
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:33,184
It is...

570
01:16:33,475 --> 01:16:38,428
It's payroll money Louisiana Bank sent
to 2401 Tulane Avenue.

571
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:41,944
Even if the killer saw her earlier,
who's to say he gave her the money?

572
01:16:42,114 --> 01:16:43,870
It could've been some drunk.

573
01:16:44,034 --> 01:16:48,790
Luther said he found minute glass fragments
on them, just like the fragments on the doll.

574
01:16:48,962 --> 01:16:53,118
He also found a barley residue he says
resembles the smudge marks on the carpet.

575
01:16:54,689 --> 01:16:56,216
Barley?

576
01:16:57,185 --> 01:17:01,854
- What's at 2401 Tulane?
- Dixie Brewery.

577
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,512
- How many employees?
- Almost 1000.

578
01:19:11,476 --> 01:19:14,476
- All of them have medical files?
- Sure.

579
01:19:15,156 --> 01:19:18,800
Well, start checking the blood type o's,
and then we'll work our way from there.

580
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:21,931
Isn't it possible she could have
got them from someone else?

581
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:24,008
No.

582
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,257
Amanda's kitchen.

583
01:19:29,427 --> 01:19:32,623
- Hi. What's doing?
- Dinner.

584
01:19:32,786 --> 01:19:34,761
Sorry, I won't be there.
I've gotta work late.

585
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:37,003
<i>You save some for me.</i>

586
01:19:41,202 --> 01:19:43,471
There'll be plenty.
Don't worry.

587
01:19:43,793 --> 01:19:47,916
Tell Mrs. Holstein to lock up.
You look after your sister, will you?

588
01:19:48,849 --> 01:19:50,507
Got you, Dad.

589
01:19:50,864 --> 01:19:52,424
Bye.

590
01:19:55,664 --> 01:19:58,151
You'd like another car
to check on them?

591
01:19:59,951 --> 01:20:01,380
Yeah.

592
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:08,830
Ruth?

593
01:21:12,169 --> 01:21:14,023
Mrs. Holstein?

594
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,578
Mrs. Holstein?

595
01:21:49,445 --> 01:21:51,233
- Penny.
- Daddy.

596
01:21:51,397 --> 01:21:52,924
Wake up.

597
01:21:53,669 --> 01:21:58,044
I want you to get in the closet. Don't
come out until your dad says so, okay?

598
01:22:58,398 --> 01:23:00,308
Stay right there.

599
01:25:17,137 --> 01:25:19,046
Daddy.

600
01:25:35,536 --> 01:25:37,423
It's all right.

601
01:25:39,151 --> 01:25:41,060
She's ready, Wes.

602
01:25:44,143 --> 01:25:46,728
We checked everywhere,
no sign of him.

603
01:25:53,518 --> 01:25:54,925
- Joe?
- Yeah.

604
01:25:55,086 --> 01:25:57,474
- Was she...?
- No, no, no.

605
01:26:22,955 --> 01:26:25,191
<i>Squad 15, how do you read?</i>

606
01:26:25,355 --> 01:26:27,395
<i>Squad 15. You're loud and clear.</i>

607
01:26:32,714 --> 01:26:35,397
<i>Car 32, 17-50.</i>

608
01:28:30,622 --> 01:28:32,695
You...

609
01:28:51,132 --> 01:28:53,303
I'll get you, motherfucker.

610
01:28:53,468 --> 01:28:56,567
Then I'm going to break
your motherfucking head!

611
01:29:16,698 --> 01:29:18,356
We talked a bit.

612
01:29:18,522 --> 01:29:20,377
She felt better.

613
01:29:21,178 --> 01:29:23,512
She'll be able to rest now.

614
01:29:30,841 --> 01:29:33,229
It wasn't your fault.

615
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,717
No one could have known
what he'd do.

616
01:29:48,887 --> 01:29:50,959
No one but me.

617
01:30:29,267 --> 01:30:33,042
There are 255 male Caucasians
with blood type o at Dixie.

618
01:30:33,203 --> 01:30:36,519
Fifty of them were working
the night shift during the murders.

619
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:39,211
Check and see if any
of the others have records.

620
01:30:39,379 --> 01:30:42,095
And check the hair colors
of those samples...

621
01:30:42,258 --> 01:30:45,771
...that we've got, would you?
And the dental records along with...

622
01:30:51,089 --> 01:30:55,464
- Ask their personnel about a Leander Rolfe.
- Leander Rolfe?

623
01:31:05,232 --> 01:31:07,020
How is she today?

624
01:31:07,184 --> 01:31:08,493
Better.

625
01:31:08,655 --> 01:31:12,365
- Penny would like to spend the night.
- That's all right.

626
01:31:12,528 --> 01:31:14,632
You wait out here, sweetie.

627
01:31:51,692 --> 01:31:54,026
My mother used to wear this.

628
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:58,246
Maybe you'd like to wear it too.

629
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:42,054
Telephone.

630
01:32:52,998 --> 01:32:54,939
- Yeah?
- Bingo.

631
01:33:20,835 --> 01:33:24,315
Leander Rolfe just finished doing 11 years
at Angola State Prison...

632
01:33:24,483 --> 01:33:27,385
...for going nuts one night...
- And raping two teenagers.

633
01:33:27,554 --> 01:33:29,529
You remember him?

634
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:31,771
Yeah. He was a cop.

635
01:33:32,578 --> 01:33:34,171
You knew him?

636
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:36,728
I arrested him.

637
01:33:37,986 --> 01:33:40,407
He just left Dixie Brewery
a half-hour ago.

638
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:42,717
- What room is he in?
- 316.

639
01:33:42,881 --> 01:33:44,375
Let's go.

640
01:34:20,926 --> 01:34:22,780
You try in there.

641
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:26,289
I'm gonna tell you right now,
I could've just blown my stack.

642
01:36:04,051 --> 01:36:05,676
How long has it been?

643
01:36:06,035 --> 01:36:07,758
About an hour.

644
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:10,098
Do you think he saw us?

645
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:13,161
I don't know. Maybe.

646
01:36:52,623 --> 01:36:53,571
<i>Jake?</i>

647
01:36:53,743 --> 01:36:56,012
I just called
and no one answers.

648
01:36:56,398 --> 01:37:00,195
Well, she's in there,
and so is Restic.

649
01:37:01,678 --> 01:37:03,401
Vic, anything?

650
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:07,619
Vic?

651
01:37:09,933 --> 01:37:11,755
Jake, Vic's not answering.

652
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:16,034
Jake?

653
01:37:17,132 --> 01:37:18,659
Jake?

654
01:39:52,829 --> 01:39:54,771
I'm okay.

655
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:03,831
Get inside, will you, Joe?

656
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:48,187
You all right, Wes?
