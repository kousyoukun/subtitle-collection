1
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:17,005
You all right, miss?

2
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:22,594
- I thought someone was following me.
- Would you like me to walk you home?

3
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:25,722
I live right there.

4
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:28,516
Could you watch to make sure I get in?

5
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,602
Sure.

6
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:19,859
Hey, Dad.

7
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:28,742
Is he all right?

8
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,500
I don't know. He hasn't got a collar.
Looks like he's kind of hungry.

9
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:38,961
Can we keep him?

10
00:05:39,962 --> 00:05:41,463
I don't know, honey.

11
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,592
Maybe we ought to take him to the pound.
They'll find him a good home.

12
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:48,178
What happens if they don't?

13
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:59,857
<i>And there's a big turnout for
Monday Night Football at the Superdome.</i>

14
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:02,985
You know who should be
quarterbacking tonight?

15
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:05,904
- Stabler.
- Me. We'll be ready to go in two minutes.

16
00:06:05,988 --> 00:06:08,574
<i>...go with ailing quarterback,
Kenny Stabler.</i>

17
00:06:43,024 --> 00:06:44,276
Damn it!

18
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:45,861
Yeah?

19
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:50,574
Right.

20
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,582
Sorry, girls.

21
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,752
- Any ID?
- A purse.

22
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:14,365
- What do you think?
- I think she died on the bed.

23
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:18,869
She couldn't have been killed in here
and dragged in there?

24
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:21,038
Possible, but not likely.

25
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:23,165
What time, about?

26
00:08:23,249 --> 00:08:28,295
From the rigor mortis and body temp,
about 18 to 20 hours ago.

27
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:43,519
<i>Hi, honey. We just wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.</i>

28
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:46,105
<i>Daddy also says he loves you.</i>

29
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:49,733
<i>We're excited you'll be home
for the weekend. Bye, dear.</i>

30
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:56,657
He said she died 18 to 20 hours ago.

31
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,951
That would've made it
no sooner than midnight.

32
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:00,119
So what?

33
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:02,579
That clock looks like
it was broken in a struggle.

34
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:04,415
If it says 9:15...

35
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,669
why wasn't she killed until midnight?

36
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:12,256
Maybe someone wanted
three hours with her first.

37
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:18,136
I want everyone in this block interviewed.

38
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,807
The neighbors, delivery people,
mailmen, garbage people.

39
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,603
I want every garbage can and every sewer
looked into for a five-block radius.

40
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:39,533
You think it brings the crazies out?

41
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:43,036
They're always out.

42
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:51,211
- Good evening, Mrs. Holstein.
- How are you?

43
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:54,005
- How are those kids?
- Fine. They're asleep.

44
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:00,947
Death came from strangulation.

45
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,450
Ligature marks on the throat,
petechial hemorrhages around the neck.

46
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:07,870
There were also two parallel,
slightly indented marks on her wrists.

47
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:10,289
- From what?
- From handcuffs, possibly.

48
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:13,918
She had bruises on her arms
from being pinned to the floor...

49
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:16,504
and what looks like a knee bruise
on her chest.

50
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:20,675
Before she died, she was penetrated,
both vaginally and anally.

51
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:23,761
- What time did she die?
- Close to midnight.

52
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:25,137
You sure?

53
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:27,848
She ate a piece of banana cake at 7:00.

54
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:31,352
Then in the next hour-and-a-half
consumed eight ounces of white wine.

55
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:32,770
Chardonnay, I believe.

56
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:37,149
Then finished at 9:00 with a small amount
of Swiss vanilla almond ice cream.

57
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:40,277
Anything else, Detective?

58
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:46,408
Take a look.

59
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:49,370
First one is a human scalp hair.

60
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:51,914
The bulbous portion of the root
is still attached...

61
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:53,582
meaning it was wrenched out.

62
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,086
The next one, tapered one,
is an eyebrow hair.

63
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:02,257
And the one at the bottom is a pubic hair.

64
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:04,218
From the same person?

65
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:08,097
Dark-haired Caucasian,
probably male, probably in his 40s.

66
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:10,432
You're really nailing him down.

67
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:13,769
- What more do you want?
- His phone number and address.

68
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,021
His semen.

69
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:21,318
- What blood type?
- "O." Just like the night before last.

70
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:25,447
This is a common, everyday,
rayon and acetate fiber.

71
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:29,493
I found it sticking to the back
of Melanie Silber's neck.

72
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,455
I found this one
under Yvonne Larkin's fingernail.

73
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,211
The killer didn't leave prints
this time, either.

74
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:42,172
Every print in the bedroom
matched Melanie Silber's.

75
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:44,841
- But there's one thing I don't get.
- What?

76
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:48,178
There was a cup on the dresser
with traces of coffee.

77
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:52,057
- There weren't any prints on it.
- Yeah, I saw it. So what?

78
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,728
Why would he take the time
to drink a cup of coffee?

79
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,732
He was starting to enjoy himself.

80
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,366
Beryl Thibodeaux from the Rape
something or other wants to see you.

81
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:12,035
- Where is she?
- The reception room.

82
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:15,080
- Tell her I'm out.
- I did. She said she'd wait.

83
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:17,540
Good. Tell her I'm out of town.

84
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:21,795
Welcome back.

85
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:25,715
Thanks.

86
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:30,887
- I tried calling you five times.
- Sorry.

87
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,767
I'm not particularly eager
to talk to women...

88
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,102
who go around with chips
on their shoulder.

89
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:42,148
Tell everybody I'm doing a lousy job
and get everybody pissed off at me.

90
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:44,943
I wouldn't be eager to talk to them either.

91
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:49,656
I'm really not eager to talk to cops
who have a chip on their shoulder...

92
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:53,951
stereotype women from rape centers,
and then go to any length to avoid them.

93
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:57,622
I'm sure you don't care
for those kinds of cops either.

94
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:02,126
Another woman was strangled last night.

95
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,921
We're concerned
it could be the same killer.

96
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,465
- Why?
- Because she was killed in the same way.

97
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:11,135
Also because we heard a rumor
the murders might be connected.

98
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:15,723
- You know how it is with rumors.
- But it could be the same person?

99
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:19,936
- That possibility always exists.
- Do you have any evidence?

100
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:23,397
I'm not at liberty to discuss evidence
in this case.

101
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:26,817
Have you been able to establish a link
between the victims?

102
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:29,862
I can't discuss that either. I'm sorry.

103
00:14:30,363 --> 00:14:34,533
All I'm asking is to be involved
in the investigation, all right?

104
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:37,745
Maybe we could put up
some warning posters.

105
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:41,165
That say some nut's going around the city
strangling women?

106
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:42,875
Yeah. Why not?

107
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,668
'Cause we're not sure it's true.

108
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:47,671
All it would do is terrify women
all over the city.

109
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,298
Maybe it should.

110
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,920
Did you brush your teeth?

111
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,217
You better get going.

112
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,678
Give your dad a smack.

113
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:55,614
Come on, kids. We got a big day.

114
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:36,780
- You want some honey?
- I don't eat sweets.

115
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:40,742
Do you eat drumsticks, mister?

116
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:49,542
- You need any help?
- Not on this one.

117
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:13,691
Who is it?

118
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,451
May I come in?

119
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,462
I heard you two worked together.

120
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:37,631
Doing what?

121
00:17:38,716 --> 00:17:40,259
As a sandwich.

122
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:43,596
One on the top, the other on the bottom.

123
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,601
What else did you hear?

124
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,271
That you liked it.

125
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:56,066
That you liked her, but she split on you.

126
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:01,906
She developed a taste for cops.

127
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,035
Did she get close to any?

128
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,204
Cops don't get close to anybody.

129
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,543
Any of them come on to her?

130
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,592
They kept coming...

131
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,553
and coming.

132
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:28,140
That's the funny thing about cops.

133
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:37,274
You take a cop whose wife splits.

134
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:44,573
Sooner...

135
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:48,577
or later...

136
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:52,372
that cop...

137
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:58,712
will react like anybody else.

138
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,886
He'll start doing things...

139
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,724
he wouldn't have done before.

140
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:23,236
So, Block...

141
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:31,369
what happened
to the rest of the sandwich?

142
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,304
Somebody ate it.

143
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:28,593
You're 10 minutes late.

144
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:32,930
Ten minutes after he's down there,
he won't know the difference...

145
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,891
between the big hand and the little hand.

146
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,852
Promise?

147
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:40,313
Trust me.

148
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:23,498
- You're still awake. What's the matter?
- I can't sleep.

149
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,881
- Where did you go?
- To his house.

150
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:35,844
- What's it like?
- Big.

151
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:38,596
She ask about me?

152
00:22:39,556 --> 00:22:42,016
No. But I told her about you anyway.

153
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,855
Where did you go tonight?

154
00:22:49,023 --> 00:22:52,360
- Out to look for something.
- Did you find it?

155
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:57,907
I found out one thing. Know what it is?

156
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:01,578
That you should be in bed,
getting some sleep.

157
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:37,196
Looks like the same method. Go ahead.

158
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,531
How old is this one?

159
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:44,912
He found her.

160
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:48,416
- There's a filter on that drain?
- Yeah.

161
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,710
Empty it.

162
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:53,504
How long has she been in here?

163
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,590
About an hour.

164
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:07,726
- Anybody in here with her?
- Not that I saw.

165
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,346
From the hot tub's drain.

166
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:49,560
This is the brownie
found in Melanie Silber's apartment.

167
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:52,229
This is the mold I made from her teeth.

168
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:55,023
The mold doesn't match the impression.

169
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:59,528
I'll coat the bite pattern on the brownie
and run it under the SEM.

170
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:02,990
We might get a reading
that'll match the killer's teeth.

171
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:06,118
Thirty calls already.

172
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:08,787
Three from a Beryl Thibodeaux
at the Rape Center.

173
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,081
Check on the specific days of the crimes.

174
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:14,459
Meteorological reports,
phases of the moon, anything like that.

175
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:17,546
Would you check the CID
for any similar MOs?

176
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:19,756
Check all 42s in the area.

177
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:22,300
Get a tail on that hot tub guy, would you?

178
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:26,846
Check out all sexual arrests in the town
for the last two weeks.

179
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,641
That goes for somebody
who's been humping sheep...

180
00:25:29,724 --> 00:25:32,269
- to some guy who's swinging his dick.
- You got it.

181
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:33,561
Here's the file.

182
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,065
Here he comes, Tim.

183
00:25:40,026 --> 00:25:42,153
Are the murders connected?

184
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:46,699
Yes, we believe that the murders
were committed by the same killer.

185
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,536
So far, the victims have all been women...

186
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:53,164
linked to unusual
or aberrant sexual activity.

187
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:57,001
We recommend, however,
that all women exercise extreme caution...

188
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:59,212
until this killer is apprehended.

189
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:04,425
- Do you have any clues?
- I can't talk about it.

190
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:17,939
What's a hard-on, Daddy?

191
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:23,528
I heard Amanda say it,
and she won't tell me what it means.

192
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:30,368
Well, darling...

193
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:35,748
it's when a man is attracted to a woman...

194
00:26:36,624 --> 00:26:39,794
he likes her. Understand?

195
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:41,879
No.

196
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,426
Well, he likes her in a certain way.

197
00:26:48,678 --> 00:26:49,804
Why?

198
00:26:50,972 --> 00:26:55,643
Well, sweetheart,
male bears like female bears...

199
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,397
and male bees like female bees.

200
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:02,149
And occasionally they get together and...

201
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:03,359
Dad?

202
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:06,487
Forget it.

203
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:44,108
You recognize this?

204
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:49,947
- Why should I?
- You drew it.

205
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:52,908
- So what?
- Tell me about it.

206
00:27:55,994 --> 00:28:00,332
Jamie Cory came in here one day
saying this hot tub guy beat her up.

207
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:02,834
She wanted a tattoo, so I did it.

208
00:28:04,753 --> 00:28:08,674
The hot tub guy says she came down here
and you beat her up.

209
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,594
Do I look like the kind of guy
who would do something like that?

210
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:13,929
Yeah.

211
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:19,476
You ever heard of a girl
named Melanie Silber?

212
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:24,189
Yeah. I like to beat her up, too.

213
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:27,817
Everybody's looking to get beat up.

214
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:35,075
What's your name?

215
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:40,997
You're hanging out
with the wrong kind of people, Block.

216
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:44,084
What kind would you suggest
I hang out with?

217
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:48,380
Someone who's more up your alley.

218
00:28:50,382 --> 00:28:54,427
- Maybe I'll take you up on that sometime.
- And do what?

219
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:57,889
Take you bowling.

220
00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:03,061
- I don't like bowling.
- Neither do I.

221
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,665
How you doing, Shorty?

222
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,417
Hello.

223
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:54,755
- You know a Jamie Cory?
- Sure. She wrestled here last night.

224
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:57,382
You know much about her?

225
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,344
Not as much as I'd have liked to.

226
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:04,056
She fought the blonde
with the big bazookas.

227
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,805
- Ice?
- What for?

228
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:51,936
- You didn't mention you knew her.
- You didn't ask.

229
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:53,688
Besides...

230
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:57,692
I thought you came here to bowl.

231
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:02,197
You recall seeing her
with anyone last night?

232
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,407
Yeah. There were a couple of guys.

233
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:05,992
Who?

234
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:09,412
Customers, you know,
guys trying to hit on her.

235
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,498
She let any of them?

236
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,710
No. She thought they were creeps.

237
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:18,171
What about other nights?

238
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:22,258
If she liked someone,
she might have done something about it.

239
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:26,179
But, by and large, just one-night stands?

240
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:28,890
Are there any other kind?

241
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,396
And you two knew each other very well?

242
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,816
Well enough.

243
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:45,406
Did she ever mention anything
about anybody using handcuffs on her?

244
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:51,454
I think so. She liked to get pretty kinky.

245
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:55,458
Remember who it might have been?

246
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:59,378
I think it was a cop.

247
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:04,967
Who knows, maybe it was you.

248
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,988
Can I help with anything?

249
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:04,753
How come you have to work so late
every night?

250
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,259
There's been three murders, hon.

251
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:13,845
Couldn't you just work during the day?

252
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:20,226
There are some people
I can only see at night.

253
00:35:21,311 --> 00:35:23,146
What kind of people?

254
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,566
People that don't have day jobs.

255
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,371
Do you get hurt?

256
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,091
Tell me, Wes, how's things at home?

257
00:35:53,509 --> 00:35:54,927
What do you mean?

258
00:35:55,761 --> 00:35:59,265
I'm not sure yet
you're ready to run this task force.

259
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:02,268
Beryl Thibodeaux
talked to the Mayor about you.

260
00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:03,978
And he called me.

261
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,397
He said if I don't come up
with something soon...

262
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,899
he's gonna start shitting all over me.

263
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:13,946
Shit runs downhill, Wes.

264
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:17,783
Yeah.

265
00:36:19,535 --> 00:36:21,537
- No!
- Louder.

266
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:24,123
- No!
- Again.

267
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:27,960
Stop!

268
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:37,386
All right. Now...

269
00:36:38,554 --> 00:36:41,765
in most of the situations
you'll encounter...

270
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,731
you will have several options.
Most important, don't stop thinking.

271
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:53,360
He's counting on you going catatonic...

272
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:57,239
and being petrified with fear
and surrendering. Keep thinking.

273
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:01,076
First, you could try and reason with him.

274
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:05,956
If that doesn't work, blow your whistle.
Start yelling.

275
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,501
The yell we've just learned, yell it out.

276
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:14,006
Don't forget. He's got his adrenalin going.
Make sure you pump up yours.

277
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,383
At this point, our goal...

278
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:19,511
is to disable your attacker.

279
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:23,348
Now, several ways
of sending him a message are...

280
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:26,768
stomping on his toes...

281
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:30,939
scratching his eyes...

282
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:36,194
hitting this vital point,
here, in the throat...

283
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:39,322
kicking into his kneecaps...

284
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:42,576
striking his solar plexus...

285
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:46,746
and if he still keeps on acting tacky...

286
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:50,250
then you can always drop back...

287
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,168
and punt.

288
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,052
Hi.

289
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:15,150
I'll bet you were just about to knock.

290
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:19,779
Actually, I was just going to hang out here
and be tacky.

291
00:38:24,117 --> 00:38:26,369
Tell me, Detective Blot.

292
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:31,165
Block. Wes Block.

293
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:34,460
- How do you like the Rape Center?
- I love it.

294
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:37,672
Would you care
to make a charitable donation?

295
00:38:38,965 --> 00:38:41,426
- Any reason I should?
- Yeah.

296
00:38:44,053 --> 00:38:46,139
Maybe I'll talk about the Mayor.

297
00:38:46,472 --> 00:38:48,266
I hear you go out with him.

298
00:38:50,143 --> 00:38:51,477
Once in a while.

299
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:53,563
I hear he's gay.

300
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:57,191
Would you like a date with him?

301
00:38:58,484 --> 00:39:00,444
I would like him off my back.

302
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,657
Don't tell me he's interrupted
your busy schedule?

303
00:39:05,324 --> 00:39:06,742
Awful, ain't it?

304
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:10,913
Yeah. Maybe you should have told him
you were out of town.

305
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:18,379
Listen, I called him...

306
00:39:19,505 --> 00:39:24,009
because I'm playing by your rules.
If you'd help me, I'd like to help you.

307
00:39:29,723 --> 00:39:32,351
The killer is a Caucasian,
blood type "O"...

308
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:35,020
in his mid 40s.

309
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:38,065
We found traces of a red fiber
on all the victims.

310
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:39,275
From what?

311
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:42,987
We don't know.

312
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,572
Any suspects?

313
00:39:46,198 --> 00:39:49,576
About 120,000 of them.

314
00:39:51,495 --> 00:39:53,872
Anything you would like me
to tell the Mayor?

315
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:57,167
Yeah. He's one of them.

316
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:17,020
Daddy!

317
00:40:22,234 --> 00:40:24,403
- Am I heavy?
- Not to me, you're not.

318
00:40:24,486 --> 00:40:26,113
I weigh 50 now!

319
00:40:28,198 --> 00:40:30,951
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too, sweetheart.

320
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:35,706
I tried to call, but the phone's been busy.
You and your sister sure are gabby.

321
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:38,792
Did your mother call?

322
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:52,722
Mind if I have one?

323
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,811
I heard you had a phone call.

324
00:40:58,979 --> 00:41:00,647
She's getting married.

325
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:05,235
She wants us to come to the wedding.

326
00:41:06,611 --> 00:41:10,198
She also said something
about having us come live with her.

327
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:12,575
Could she do that?

328
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:14,702
I don't know, baby.

329
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:18,415
I used to make these for her.

330
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:20,458
I know.

331
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,211
But I like making them for you better.

332
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:44,399
Seen any of these?

333
00:41:51,114 --> 00:41:52,490
No. Too bad.

334
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,995
Yeah, I've seen her in here before.

335
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,165
Anybody ever get violent with her?

336
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:04,752
That's part of the turn-on, isn't it?

337
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:06,879
You know who it was?

338
00:42:08,714 --> 00:42:09,799
No.

339
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:14,595
What about you?

340
00:42:15,096 --> 00:42:17,181
You ever see her in here before?

341
00:42:19,141 --> 00:42:20,184
No.

342
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,060
You recognize her?

343
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:06,146
No.

344
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,322
Why don't you come on in?

345
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:25,791
Close the door.

346
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,404
- When did they find it?
- About 20 minutes ago.

347
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:01,755
What's up?

348
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:04,424
Smudge marks
from Melanie Silber's bedroom.

349
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:08,220
- Can you tell anything?
- Yeah. It's mostly good old dirt.

350
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:10,472
What about this morning?

351
00:47:10,555 --> 00:47:12,807
There were cuff marks on her wrists.

352
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:16,353
Anything else?

353
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:19,814
This.

354
00:47:32,452 --> 00:47:35,538
We struck out with the hot tub guy.
Wrong blood type.

355
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,001
- Maybe we should...
- What was her name?

356
00:47:40,084 --> 00:47:41,127
Who?

357
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,339
The girl at the river.

358
00:47:45,673 --> 00:47:47,467
Judy Harper. A nurse.

359
00:47:57,518 --> 00:47:59,937
Every mass murderer has a motive, Wes.

360
00:48:00,563 --> 00:48:04,567
It could be as bizarre
as voices commanding him to kill.

361
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,862
The voices could come from God
or from the refrigerator.

362
00:48:08,154 --> 00:48:11,782
Or it could be as simple as anger,
frustration, revenge.

363
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,495
That's why he uses handcuffs
on the women.

364
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:19,749
- Has he contacted you?
- No.

365
00:48:19,832 --> 00:48:22,585
- I wouldn't be surprised if he did.
- Why?

366
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,713
Once you started going after him...

367
00:48:25,796 --> 00:48:28,007
you became closer to him
than anyone else...

368
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,469
unless there's another psychopath
out doing the same thing.

369
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:36,307
I'm not sure how close I want to get.

370
00:48:37,224 --> 00:48:39,727
There's a darkness inside all of us, Wes.

371
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:42,688
You, me, and the man down the street.

372
00:48:43,522 --> 00:48:46,358
Some have it under control,
others act it out.

373
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:50,070
The rest of us try to walk a tightrope
between the two.

374
00:51:04,537 --> 00:51:06,539
Want to go hoist some oysters?

375
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:14,464
I've never seen you work out there before.

376
00:51:14,547 --> 00:51:16,507
I came there looking for you.

377
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,677
We found another body.

378
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,928
I know.

379
00:51:21,387 --> 00:51:22,889
I'm sorry about it.

380
00:51:23,139 --> 00:51:24,390
Why tell me?

381
00:51:24,932 --> 00:51:26,976
I didn't know who else to tell.

382
00:51:43,284 --> 00:51:46,120
You didn't have to bring me here
to tell me that.

383
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:47,246
No.

384
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:52,334
- Thank you.
- So why did you?

385
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,213
I saw you working out in that gym.

386
00:51:57,089 --> 00:51:59,300
I was wondering what you'd be like.

387
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,179
Why the sudden interest?

388
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:10,144
I was wondering if you came alone.

389
00:52:11,979 --> 00:52:13,939
What else were you wondering?

390
00:52:16,984 --> 00:52:18,694
You really want to know?

391
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:20,320
Yeah.

392
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:24,324
What it would be like...

393
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:27,327
to lick the sweat off your body.

394
00:52:38,505 --> 00:52:41,216
Do you always say exactly
what's on your mind?

395
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:42,885
You don't like it?

396
00:52:44,386 --> 00:52:46,555
It could be a little more subtle.

397
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:48,390
What I said?

398
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:51,393
More the way you said it.

399
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:54,604
How would you like me to say it?

400
00:52:55,022 --> 00:52:58,066
As if you're not saying it to somebody
every night.

401
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:01,278
What else would you like?

402
00:53:01,987 --> 00:53:05,490
I'd like to find out
what's underneath the front you put on.

403
00:53:11,037 --> 00:53:13,165
Maybe you wouldn't like what you'd find.

404
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:15,208
Maybe you're scared I would.

405
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,855
- You're not married.
- What makes you say that?

406
00:53:37,188 --> 00:53:38,440
Just a hunch.

407
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:43,069
Did you hear the one about the cop
whose wife left him a note...

408
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,822
saying she'd fallen in love
with anyone else?

409
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,200
Did your wife leave you a note?

410
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,744
No, she left me two kids.

411
00:53:53,746 --> 00:53:56,624
- Where is she now?
- Still here in New Orleans.

412
00:53:59,294 --> 00:54:01,629
Have you ever thought of moving away?

413
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:06,134
Twenty-eight years ago,
I borrowed $40 from my father...

414
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:09,679
packed up an old beat-up suitcase,
took a bus, and came here.

415
00:54:10,138 --> 00:54:11,723
I was 17 at the time.

416
00:54:13,015 --> 00:54:16,936
I walked through the French Quarter,
looked out over the Mississippi...

417
00:54:17,562 --> 00:54:19,355
and swore I'd never leave.

418
00:54:19,439 --> 00:54:21,941
- Ever come close?
- Only once.

419
00:54:22,567 --> 00:54:25,444
When I looked down
and saw that suitcase missing.

420
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:28,447
Have you ever been married?

421
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,783
- No.
- How come?

422
00:54:33,911 --> 00:54:36,247
I guess I haven't met the right man.

423
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:41,419
Maybe I scared him away.

424
00:54:41,794 --> 00:54:43,879
Definitely wasn't the right man.

425
00:54:47,258 --> 00:54:50,845
- My mother thinks it's my job.
- What do you think?

426
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,139
It doesn't matter.

427
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:55,850
- I like what I do.
- Helping women?

428
00:54:57,309 --> 00:54:58,436
Men, too.

429
00:54:59,603 --> 00:55:01,856
What makes you so sure they need it?

430
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:04,233
We all need it.

431
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:16,787
Okay, gals. Come on, wake up.

432
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:19,248
We gotta go back to our own beds.

433
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:21,083
- Hi, Dad.
- Where you been?

434
00:55:22,418 --> 00:55:24,128
Come on, get on my back.

435
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:27,589
Your dad had a date tonight.

436
00:55:28,006 --> 00:55:29,216
Who with?

437
00:55:30,509 --> 00:55:31,969
Somebody he met.

438
00:55:32,219 --> 00:55:34,596
- Where did you go?
- Out on the river.

439
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:37,141
- Is she nice?
- Yeah.

440
00:55:37,432 --> 00:55:39,935
- Do you like her?
- Yeah, she's nice.

441
00:55:40,018 --> 00:55:43,188
- Did you kiss her?
- Come on, give me a break, will you?

442
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:48,485
I bet that's her right now,
and she wants to see you again.

443
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:52,406
You can have a hard-on anytime you want.

444
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:05,752
"Another one will soon be dead.

445
00:56:07,379 --> 00:56:10,048
"You can stop it
if you knew what was ahead."

446
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,509
Think it's from a crank?

447
00:56:14,803 --> 00:56:16,012
No.

448
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,560
Sam's. What's that?

449
00:56:28,525 --> 00:56:29,776
I'm Sam.

450
00:57:14,237 --> 00:57:15,571
You're strong.

451
00:57:16,656 --> 00:57:19,659
I love being punished by a strong man.

452
00:57:25,581 --> 00:57:28,167
He said you'd want this.

453
00:57:30,044 --> 00:57:31,295
What for?

454
00:57:32,004 --> 00:57:33,089
Me.

455
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:34,882
He's wrong.

456
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:42,265
He said you were just like him.

457
00:57:42,556 --> 00:57:43,641
Who's "he"?

458
00:57:49,939 --> 00:57:51,232
Use the whip.

459
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:04,829
You're to wear this to Praline's.

460
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:10,876
I don't know who he is.

461
00:58:46,745 --> 00:58:48,455
Looking for something...

462
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,666
Alice?

463
00:59:29,412 --> 00:59:31,623
He said this was your first time.

464
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,668
- Who?
- You don't know?

465
00:59:36,836 --> 00:59:38,463
He bought me for you.

466
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:40,215
You've seen him?

467
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,344
When was he supposed to pay you?

468
00:59:44,427 --> 00:59:48,098
Right after this,
at that old warehouse across the street.

469
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,897
You go on over to that warehouse
and collect your money.

470
00:59:57,899 --> 00:59:59,984
- You don't want it?
- No.

471
01:00:00,693 --> 01:00:03,363
He said you did.
You just don't know it yet.

472
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:05,740
He's wrong.

473
01:00:07,784 --> 01:00:10,245
How do you know if you haven't tried it?

474
01:00:10,995 --> 01:00:12,372
Maybe I have.

475
01:00:18,586 --> 01:00:21,214
I'm at a warehouse at 1416 Water.

476
01:03:38,284 --> 01:03:40,870
We searched the whole warehouse.
He's gone.

477
01:03:41,746 --> 01:03:44,957
- The saliva on the stamps tested...
- Blood type "O."

478
01:03:45,249 --> 01:03:46,292
Right.

479
01:03:46,417 --> 01:03:48,085
The notes are from...

480
01:03:49,378 --> 01:03:50,713
a '72 Olivetti.

481
01:03:50,796 --> 01:03:54,634
The letters "e" and "s" are worn down,
the "k" is misaligned.

482
01:03:54,717 --> 01:03:56,344
That's all I can tell.

483
01:03:56,510 --> 01:04:00,348
- What about the red ribbon?
- Same as the fibers from other victims.

484
01:04:07,354 --> 01:04:09,148
"If you knew what's ahead."

485
01:05:41,823 --> 01:05:42,908
Becky?

486
01:06:42,675 --> 01:06:44,427
She could still be alive.

487
01:06:47,138 --> 01:06:48,389
Couldn't she?

488
01:06:58,399 --> 01:06:59,650
Still no sign?

489
01:07:00,818 --> 01:07:02,320
It won't be long.

490
01:07:06,365 --> 01:07:07,825
Any luck with him?

491
01:07:08,242 --> 01:07:09,327
No.

492
01:07:10,453 --> 01:07:12,038
You're letting him go?

493
01:07:16,709 --> 01:07:18,544
I heard you knew her, too.

494
01:07:20,754 --> 01:07:22,006
That's right.

495
01:07:22,882 --> 01:07:24,842
Just out of curiosity, Wes...

496
01:07:25,593 --> 01:07:28,304
did you happen to know
any of the other victims?

497
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:34,602
No.

498
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:59,751
You have someone
who could drive by my house?

499
01:08:00,461 --> 01:08:01,795
Your kids?

500
01:08:04,089 --> 01:08:05,132
Sure.

501
01:10:16,762 --> 01:10:19,932
Remember the smudge marks
in Melanie Silber's bedroom?

502
01:10:20,141 --> 01:10:22,768
- The killer made them.
- How do you know?

503
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:26,772
They have the same chemical composition
as particles on that doll.

504
01:10:26,981 --> 01:10:28,649
Any idea what they are?

505
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:32,069
Some kind of glass fragments
coated with a barley residue.

506
01:10:32,987 --> 01:10:35,197
- What could they come from?
- Who knows?

507
01:10:35,281 --> 01:10:37,074
Maybe a grain storage bin.

508
01:10:37,408 --> 01:10:41,078
He must have picked up the fragments
in the treads of his tennis shoes.

509
01:10:41,161 --> 01:10:42,830
He wore tennis shoes?

510
01:10:44,081 --> 01:10:46,500
By tomorrow,
I might even know the make.

511
01:10:53,424 --> 01:10:54,508
Hello.

512
01:10:55,092 --> 01:10:57,094
Hi, can I see you tonight?

513
01:10:58,137 --> 01:10:59,680
I've got some work.

514
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:01,432
Can it wait?

515
01:11:02,599 --> 01:11:03,892
Are you okay?

516
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:08,313
I don't know.

517
01:13:14,397 --> 01:13:16,816
They found one of the bodies near here.

518
01:13:17,149 --> 01:13:18,317
I know.

519
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,113
- They're getting closer.
- Closer to what?

520
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,448
To me.

521
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:35,918
Do you investigate many sexual crimes?

522
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:37,753
Why?

523
01:13:39,672 --> 01:13:42,550
I was wondering
if they've had any effect on you.

524
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:47,888
They did make me want
to treat my wife a little more tenderly.

525
01:13:48,722 --> 01:13:50,432
How did she respond?

526
01:13:51,934 --> 01:13:54,561
She said she wasn't interested
in tenderness.

527
01:14:02,152 --> 01:14:03,821
They're nice kids.

528
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:08,075
Yeah, they're about the only thing
in my life I haven't screwed up.

529
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:10,661
Some people don't even have that.

530
01:14:17,376 --> 01:14:20,504
Why didn't your wife take them
when she left?

531
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:25,008
Because they were part of what she left.

532
01:14:26,718 --> 01:14:28,428
What did you tell them?

533
01:14:30,138 --> 01:14:32,933
I didn't tell them anything.
They already knew.

534
01:14:39,106 --> 01:14:41,983
Do they get jealous
when you bring a woman over?

535
01:14:44,861 --> 01:14:46,696
I don't bring a woman home.

536
01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:50,075
What about that woman
you just bumped into?

537
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:53,119
She's just sort of a friend.

538
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,957
Would that kind of friend...

539
01:14:57,582 --> 01:15:00,252
have anything to do
with your wife leaving?

540
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,798
I made those kind of
friends after she left.

541
01:15:06,216 --> 01:15:08,593
Can we come back
tomorrow night, Daddy?

542
01:15:09,094 --> 01:15:11,096
We'll talk about that later.

543
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,519
I want a balloon.

544
01:15:18,144 --> 01:15:19,604
Here, I got it.

545
01:16:15,576 --> 01:16:16,786
Dad?

546
01:16:17,161 --> 01:16:20,081
Beryl's nice.
She's pretty, too, don't you think?

547
01:16:20,206 --> 01:16:21,332
Yeah.

548
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:25,378
- I can tell she wants to see you again.
- You can, can you?

549
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:28,798
If I were you, I'd ask
her out this weekend.

550
01:16:29,632 --> 01:16:31,467
You would, would you?

551
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:37,473
- Find out if she likes dogs.
- Of course.

552
01:16:41,936 --> 01:16:44,313
You'll have to excuse the mess.

553
01:16:46,649 --> 01:16:48,901
You should see my place sometimes.

554
01:16:51,237 --> 01:16:54,073
I don't exactly have
a lot of help around here.

555
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:11,465
Now, why do you think he uses handcuffs?

556
01:17:12,382 --> 01:17:13,509
Control?

557
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:17,888
Do you use them very often?

558
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:22,476
That depends.

559
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,812
On what?

560
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:28,357
The situation.

561
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:37,032
- When you feel you're threatened?
- Yeah, you could say that.

562
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:44,206
With these, no one can get to you?

563
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:48,126
They'll stop just about anyone.

564
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:45,493
From Jamie Cory's clothing.

565
01:19:48,412 --> 01:19:50,456
We traced the serial numbers.

566
01:19:54,084 --> 01:19:58,339
It's payroll money, Louisiana Bank,
sent to 2401 Tulane Avenue.

567
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:02,468
Even if the killer saw her
at the Body Shop, who's to say...

568
01:20:02,551 --> 01:20:05,346
he gave her the money?
It could have been some drunk.

569
01:20:05,429 --> 01:20:09,892
Luther found minute glass fragments
on them. Just like ones on the doll.

570
01:20:10,517 --> 01:20:12,311
He also found a barley residue...

571
01:20:12,394 --> 01:20:15,272
he says resembles the smudge marks
on the carpet.

572
01:20:16,273 --> 01:20:17,483
Barley?

573
01:20:19,151 --> 01:20:20,944
What's at 2401 Tulane?

574
01:20:21,904 --> 01:20:23,447
Dixie Brewery.

575
01:22:34,327 --> 01:22:37,121
- How many employees?
- Almost a thousand.

576
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,084
- All of them have medical files?
- Sure.

577
01:22:43,002 --> 01:22:46,839
Good. We'll start checking the blood type
"O"s and work our way from there.

578
01:22:46,922 --> 01:22:50,426
Look, isn't it possible she could
have got them from someone else?

579
01:22:50,509 --> 01:22:51,552
No.

580
01:22:56,223 --> 01:22:57,641
Amanda's kitchen.

581
01:22:57,766 --> 01:22:59,018
What's doing?

582
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:00,895
Dinner.

583
01:23:01,186 --> 01:23:03,564
Sorry, I won't be there.
I've got to work late.

584
01:23:03,647 --> 01:23:05,357
<i>You save some for me.</i>

585
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:12,239
There'll be plenty. Don't worry.

586
01:23:12,698 --> 01:23:14,700
Tell Mrs. Holstein to lock up.

587
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:17,411
You look after your sister, will you?

588
01:23:18,037 --> 01:23:19,496
Got you, Dad.

589
01:23:25,252 --> 01:23:27,754
You'd like another car to check on them?

590
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:30,799
Yeah.

591
01:24:45,248 --> 01:24:46,708
Mrs. Holstein?

592
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:25,413
- Penny.
- Daddy?

593
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:26,789
Yeah, wake up.

594
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:30,042
He could be back. I want you
to get in the closet, stay there...

595
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:33,087
and don't come out
until your dad says so, okay?

596
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,609
Stay right there.

597
01:29:19,603 --> 01:29:21,063
It's all right.

598
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,109
She's ready, Wes.

599
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,948
We checked everywhere. No sign of him.

600
01:29:38,288 --> 01:29:39,832
- Joe.
- Yeah?

601
01:29:39,998 --> 01:29:41,667
- Was she...
- No.

602
01:32:22,076 --> 01:32:24,161
I hate you, son of a bitch!

603
01:32:43,889 --> 01:32:48,143
I hate you, motherfucker!
I'm going to break your motherfucking ass.

604
01:33:10,248 --> 01:33:13,085
We talked a bit. She felt better.

605
01:33:14,252 --> 01:33:16,421
She'll be able to rest now.

606
01:33:25,222 --> 01:33:26,806
It wasn't your fault.

607
01:33:37,817 --> 01:33:40,153
No one could have known what he'd do.

608
01:33:44,074 --> 01:33:45,575
No one but me.

609
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,619
There are 255 male Caucasians
with blood type "O" at Dixie.

610
01:34:29,994 --> 01:34:33,414
Fifty of them were working the night shift
during the murders.

611
01:34:33,498 --> 01:34:36,334
Check and see
if any of the others have records.

612
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:40,922
Check the hair colors of those samples
we've got, would you...

613
01:34:41,172 --> 01:34:43,466
and the dental records along with it.

614
01:34:48,721 --> 01:34:51,307
Ask their Personnel about a Leander Rolfe.

615
01:35:03,444 --> 01:35:06,155
- How is she today?
- She's better.

616
01:35:06,781 --> 01:35:09,158
Penny wants to spend the night,
is that all right?

617
01:35:09,241 --> 01:35:10,951
Yeah, it's all right.

618
01:35:11,076 --> 01:35:12,620
You wait out here.

619
01:35:52,034 --> 01:35:54,203
My mother used to wear this.

620
01:35:56,371 --> 01:35:58,582
Maybe you'd like to wear it, too.

621
01:36:42,584 --> 01:36:43,710
Telephone.

622
01:36:55,722 --> 01:36:57,557
- Yeah?
- Bingo.

623
01:37:24,876 --> 01:37:28,254
Leander Rolfe just finished 11 years
at Angola State Prison...

624
01:37:28,338 --> 01:37:29,589
for going nuts one night.

625
01:37:29,672 --> 01:37:32,675
- And raping two teenagers.
- You remember him?

626
01:37:34,052 --> 01:37:35,720
Yeah. He was a cop.

627
01:37:37,013 --> 01:37:38,347
You knew him?

628
01:37:39,849 --> 01:37:41,392
I arrested him.

629
01:37:42,685 --> 01:37:45,271
He just left Dixie Brewery a half hour ago.

630
01:37:45,813 --> 01:37:47,732
- What room is he in?
- 316.

631
01:37:47,815 --> 01:37:49,150
Let's go.

632
01:38:27,479 --> 01:38:29,189
You try in there.

633
01:40:15,003 --> 01:40:16,546
How long has it been?

634
01:40:17,088 --> 01:40:18,423
About an hour.

635
01:40:19,841 --> 01:40:21,551
Do you think he saw us?

636
01:40:22,468 --> 01:40:24,137
I don't know. Maybe.

637
01:41:07,054 --> 01:41:09,181
I just called, and no one answered.

638
01:41:09,682 --> 01:41:12,852
Well, she's in there, and so is Restic.

639
01:41:15,146 --> 01:41:16,564
Vic, anything?

640
01:41:23,779 --> 01:41:25,614
Jake, Vic's not answering.

641
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:14,865
I'm okay.

642
01:44:22,748 --> 01:44:24,583
Get inside, will you, Joe?

643
01:50:22,229 --> 01:50:23,731
