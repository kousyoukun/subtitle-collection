1
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
Come on, Doc.

2
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,900
Check this out.

3
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,200
Prints are right here.

4
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,700
<i>We're reporting to you live
from the home...</i>

5
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,200
<i>...of Dr. Richard Kimble...</i>

6
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,500
<i>...a respected vascular surgeon
at Chicago Memorial Hospital.</i>

7
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,000
<i>Details are sketchy...</i>

8
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,500
<i>...but we understand Dr. Kimble's wife,
Helen, was found murdered this evening.</i>

9
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,800
<i>Right now, Area Six detectives
are bringing out Dr. Kimble.</i>

10
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,300
<i>We assume that they're going to be taking
him to a police station, probably Area Six...</i>

11
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,100
<i>...where they hope he can shed some light
on what happened here this evening.</i>

12
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,100
<i>Now, as I indicated,
she was found shortly before midnight.</i>

13
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,400
We know that she made, apparently,
a 911 call to police...

14
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,800
<i>...indicating an intruder in the house
and she was being assaulted.</i>

15
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,600
<i>Details are very sketchy.</i>

16
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
<i>We do know that he and his wife Helen...</i>

17
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,500
<i>...were at the Four Seasons Hotel
earlier this evening...</i>

18
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,600
<i>...a fundraiser for
the Children's Research Fund.</i>

19
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,200
Rich, remember Cara?

20
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,600
Nice to see you.

21
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,000
Straighten that arm or you're going to slice.

22
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
Golf pro teach you that?

23
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,300
My wife.

24
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,900
Before I forget...

25
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,800
...thanks for the loaner.
Keys are downstairs.

26
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
- Any gas in it?
- Yes. Enough.

27
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,400
Alec, Richard Kimble.

28
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,600
- How are you?
- Dr. Kimble!

29
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,900
Absolutely, anytime.

30
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,900
I think that's a great idea.

31
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,900
All right, you guys, knock it off!

32
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,000
There's nothing to see here.
And you, come with me.

33
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,600
Thank you.
I was just down to my last joke.

34
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,100
<i>You look really beautiful tonight.</i>

35
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,800
Thanks, honey.

36
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,400
I know you hate these things, but God,
I love looking at you in a tux.

37
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,200
I always feel I look like
a waiter or something.

38
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,200
Hello?

39
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,700
<i>- Dr. Kimble?
- Yes, it is.</i>

40
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,100
<i>Sorry to bother you, sir...</i>

41
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,800
<i>...but Dr. Stevens is in Emergency O.R.
and asked for your help.</i>

42
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,100
Call him back and tell him
I will be right there.

43
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,600
<i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>

44
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,300
Thank you. Good night.

45
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,200
I will wait up for you.

46
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,800
<i>I will wait up for you.</i>

47
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,900
<i>Talk to me. What have we got here?</i>

48
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,600
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

49
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,100
A 58-year-old guy.
Just pulled his gallbladder. Bleeding.

50
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Big time. It's all in the liver bed.

51
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,800
- What are his coags?
- They're all messed up.

52
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,200
PT's 36 and the rest are off the wall.

53
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,900
Where is he from?

54
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,500
Lentz's name is on the chart.
We paged him, but no answer.

55
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,600
Okay, you guys. Let me in there.
Give me some room.

56
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,600
Give me a clamp.

57
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,200
Give me some suction in there.

58
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,000
<i>Have you been getting
any threats at work?</i>

59
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,000
Co-workers, hospital staff,
anything like that at all?

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,900
Anything unusual going on as far as...

61
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,700
...phone calls, people hanging up?

62
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,100
Maybe people coming to the door?

63
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,600
Tradespeople?

64
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,500
Not that I know of.

65
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,600
Now back to this fight
with this guy with the one arm.

66
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?

67
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Upstairs.

68
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,500
Was it his right or left arm...

69
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
...that had that little gimmick on it?

70
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,900
Right arm.

71
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,600
Is it one of those with the hooks, or...

72
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,600
No, he had a cosmetic hand.

73
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,300
The security system in your house,
it's a pretty good system.

74
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,100
<i>Anyone have the coding
besides you and your wife?</i>

75
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,700
Our maid.

76
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,500
She knows the code
and has a key to the house.

77
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Those scratches on your neck...

78
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,900
...did the one-armed guy do that?

79
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,600
Helen scratched me
when I was trying to move her.

80
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,000
Before or after you had the fight
with the one-armed guy?

81
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,400
I told you.

82
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,200
You own a gun, Doc?

83
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,200
Do you own a gun?

84
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
Yes, we have a gun in the house.

85
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,700
Is it registered in your name?

86
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
Yes.

87
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,400
<i>Where do you usually keep that gun?</i>

88
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
<i>The one that you own.</i>

89
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,000
<i>It's in Helen's table.</i>

90
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,200
<i>Bedside table.</i>

91
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,400
<i>Do you keep much jewelry in the house?</i>

92
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,000
His fingerprints are all over the lamp...

93
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,400
...the gun and the bullets...

94
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,900
...and the good doctor's skin
is under her fingernails.

95
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
<i>She's got the money in the family,
hasn't she?</i>

96
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,800
Helen comes from a wealthy family, yes.

97
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,100
Is she insured?

98
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,100
Yes, she is.

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
Who's the beneficiary?

100
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,300
I am.

101
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,000
The sole beneficiary?

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
Yes.

103
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,300
Financially, you won't
be hurting after this, are you?

104
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,200
I mean,
she was worth quite a bit of money.

105
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,100
Are you suggesting that I killed my wife?

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you saying that I crushed her skull
and shot her?

107
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,000
How dare you!

108
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,100
When I came home,
there was a man in my house.

109
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900
I fought with this man.

110
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,200
- The one-armed man?
- He had a mechanical arm.

111
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,900
- Plastic? Rubber?
- You find this man!

112
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,700
You find this man!

113
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,700
How tall was he?

114
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
He took everything from me.

115
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,100
Oh, Jesus.

116
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,800
What did he weigh?

117
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,700
What color was his hair?

118
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,000
What color were his eyes?

119
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,000
<i>We can't help you until you help us.</i>

120
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,500
Book him.

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

122
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,200
...you will hear iron-clad proof
of Richard Kimble's guilt.

123
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,900
Indisputable scientific evidence...

124
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,600
...that on the night of January 20...

125
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,400
...Richard Kimble did in fact viciously...

126
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,800
...attack...

127
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,900
...and brutally murder his wife.

128
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
But you will hear more than that.

129
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,600
You will hear a voice from the grave.

130
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,100
The voice of Helen Kimble
identifying her killer...

131
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,500
...her husband, Richard Kimble.

132
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,300
Detective Kelly...

133
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,300
...tell us what you observed at the victim's
home on the night of the murder.

134
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,300
No forcible entry was found.

135
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,500
<i>From the beginning of the investigation,
it didn't appear to be a break-in.</i>

136
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,100
<i>Nothing was missing.</i>

137
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,800
Honey, I am home.

138
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
Who won the game?

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,500
The defendant's prints
were on the gun and bullets.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
<i>No other sets were found,
other than the housekeeper's...</i>

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,700
<i>...and the deceased's.</i>

142
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,200
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused
a massive hemorrhage to the brain.

143
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,900
It took less than five minutes
for her to die.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,900
Your Honor, we would ask to play
Helen Kimble's 911 emergency call...

145
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,100
...previously identified by
a Chicago Police Department dispatcher.

146
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,100
<i>Emergency 911.</i>

147
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,700
Please help me.

148
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,000
<i>What's the problem?</i>

149
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
<i>He's...</i>

150
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,100
<i>He's still in the house.</i>

151
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,900
<i>Did I hear you right?</i>

152
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,800
<i>Someone's in your house?</i>

153
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

154
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
<i>Could you repeat that, please?</i>

155
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,500
<i>Ma'am?</i>

156
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,500
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

157
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,800
<i>Is your attacker still in the house?</i>

158
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,800
<i>Richard...</i>

159
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,400
Richard...

160
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,800
He's trying to kill me.

161
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
Mr. Kimble...

162
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,100
...having considered all the facts,
aggravation and mitigation in this case...

163
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,000
...and found the offense was brutal
and indicative of wanton cruelty...

164
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,600
...it's the judgment of this court, that you
be remanded to illinois State Penitentiary...

165
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,500
...where you will await execution
by lethal injection...

166
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,900
...on a date to be set forth
by the Attorney General of this state.

167
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,700
May God have mercy on your soul.

168
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,000
- Carlson.
- Here.

169
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
- Partida.
- Yeah.

170
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
- Copeland.
- What?

171
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,900
Copeland, you be nice now.

172
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,000
Kimble.

173
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,300
Yeah.

174
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,100
Let's go, gentlemen.

175
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Four prisoners coming out.

176
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,600
Let's go, gentlemen.

177
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,600
Kimble, you're here.

178
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,000
Carlson, right over there.

179
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Partida, up front left.

180
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,600
Copeland, you're back here with me.

181
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,900
Come on, make yourselves comfortable.

182
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,000
You know the routine, gentlemen.

183
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,300
I am tired.

184
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,300
Twenty miles from Menard.

185
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,900
We should be there in about 40 minutes.

186
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,700
I will be glad to get rid of this load.
Let McKenzie take care of them.

187
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,800
I hope he's got something good
to eat there. I am starving.

188
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,400
Me, too.

189
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,100
I have had enough of that prison chow.

190
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,500
Old Ed, he don't care.
His old lady's got him on a diet.

191
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,000
Right, Ed?

192
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,100
Somebody get in here, quick!

193
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,700
He's getting sick! Let's go, move! Move!

194
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,900
- He's foaming at the mouth.
- We're almost at the prison.

195
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,800
He's choking! Come on!

196
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,300
Wait!

197
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,800
Oh, shit!

198
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,700
Kimble, get over here.
You're a doctor, do something!

199
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,300
Unlock me!

200
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
Hang in there. You will be okay.

201
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,900
What the hell is that?

202
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,600
Shit!

203
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
Give me a hand!

204
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,800
The hell with you.

205
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,700
Give me a hand with this man!

206
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,700
Kiss my ass, Doc.

207
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,700
Now, you listen.

208
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,500
I don't give a damn which way you go.

209
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,900
Just don't follow me. You got that?

210
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,700
Be good.

211
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,700
My, my!

212
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
What a mess.

213
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,400
It's a circus.

214
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,000
You got my bag?

215
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,900
Point of impact, right here.

216
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,700
The first engine uncoupled,
and the rest of the train jumped the track.

217
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,100
About 100 yards?

218
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,900
You must get new boots.

219
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,500
I told you not to wear the heels.

220
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,900
Wear two coats.

221
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,500
Next train wreck.

222
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,900
Why do we always mother her?

223
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,400
Because she loves us.

224
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,500
- How'd you have liked to be the driver?
- I bet he did a Casey Jones.

225
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,900
Hold it, sir.

226
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,600
Hi. Who's in charge?

227
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,900
Sheriff Rawlins.

228
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,900
Just follow the TV lights.

229
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,500
Sheriff Rogers.

230
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,800
Rawlins!

231
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,100
Look down there and take Newman.

232
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Come on. Time to go to work.

233
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,900
The bus rolled over several times before
settling down at the bottom of the hill.

234
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,300
I don't know if I passed out or what...

235
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,400
...but when I looked up,
the train was bearing down on us. Fast.

236
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,800
I don't know how. It's still kind of hazy.

237
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,700
Somehow I grabbed him and pushed him
out of the bus.

238
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,800
- You're brave, you could have been killed.
- I know.

239
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,600
He's my partner.
He would have done the same for me.

240
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,500
Excuse me, I am Deputy U.S. Marshal
Samuel Gerard, I'd like to--

241
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,900
I will be with you in just a minute.

242
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,500
One more time, just for the record.

243
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,700
These three are dead.

244
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,100
And this one?

245
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,300
Everything happened so fast.

246
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,300
I don't think he made it.

247
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,100
Looks like you came a long way
for nothing.

248
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
With all due respect, Sheriff Rawlins...

249
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,900
...I'd like to suggest checkpoints
on a 15-mile radius...

250
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,700
...at I-57, I-24 and over here on Route 13--

251
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,600
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.

252
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,300
Checkpoints will get a lot of people frantic
and they will flood my office with calls.

253
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,700
Well, shit, I'd hate to see that happen...

254
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,400
...so I guess I will take over
your investigation.

255
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,800
On what authority?

256
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,200
The Governor of illinois...

257
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
...the U.S. Marshal's Office...

258
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,500
...Fifth District, Northern illinois.

259
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,300
All right, you want jurisdiction
over this mess. You got it.

260
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,700
Okay, boys, gather around and listen up.

261
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,600
We're shutting it down.
Wyatt Earp's here to mop up...

262
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,900
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.

263
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,300
Wow. Gee whiz. Look here!

264
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,400
We're always fascinated when we find
leg irons with no legs in them.

265
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
Who held the key, sir?

266
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
Me.

267
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,200
Where are those keys at?

268
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,600
I don't know.

269
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,800
Care to revise your statement, sir?

270
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,700
What?

271
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,500
Do you want to change
your bullshit story, sir?

272
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,400
He might have got out.

273
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,900
You said he was part of the wreckage!

274
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,100
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen!

275
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,000
Our fugitive has been
on the run for 90 minutes.

276
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
Average foot speed over uneven ground,
barring injury, is four miles an hour.

277
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,800
That gives us a radius of six miles.

278
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,600
What I want out of each and every one
of you is a hard-target search...

279
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,000
...of every gas station...

280
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,900
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse,
hen house, outhouse...

281
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,800
<i>...and doghouse in that area.</i>

282
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,500
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.

283
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,600
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.

284
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,200
Go get him.

285
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,700
Please don't give me shit.

286
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,600
I got three very unhappy dead people.
Put him on.

287
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,800
Stevens, it's Cosmo.

288
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
I will have a satellite telephone hookup
in two seconds.

289
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,400
Chester Police just found a blood trail...

290
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
...two miles southwest.

291
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,900
Match that blood against all four prisoners.

292
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,800
Get a fax ID on Kimble
to every local hospital.

293
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,000
And follow that with troopers.

294
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,000
What are you doing?

295
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,700
I am thinking.

296
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,500
Think me up a coffee and a chocolate
doughnut with sprinkles on top...

297
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
...while you're thinking.

298
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,200
We got a live one!

299
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,600
A live one?

300
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,500
Come on. Hang in there, brother.
We will get you out of here.

301
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,200
Get that ambulance down here! Come on!

302
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,100
Is this what you're looking for?

303
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,800
That's it.

304
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,900
I am going to make some copies.

305
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,600
Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
I have your breakfast for you.

306
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,600
We're thirsty today, aren't we?

307
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,100
Eat up before this gets cold.

308
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,300
It really does get dry in here, doesn't it?

309
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,500
Here you are.

310
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,700
Now, you eat something, Mr. Johnson.

311
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,500
You need your strength.

312
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,900
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner
from that wreck. He might be hurt.

313
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,700
What does he look like?

314
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,600
Six-foot-one, 180, brown hair,
brown eyes, beard.

315
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,500
Seen anyone like that around?

316
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,800
Every time I look in the mirror, pal.

317
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,700
Except for the beard, of course.

318
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,800
Doc!

319
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,600
Thanks.

320
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,000
- I will give you a hand.
- Thanks, Doc.

321
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
It's...

322
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,900
How is he doing?

323
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,400
Good, considering we dug him out
from under a train.

324
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,300
Tell the attending he's got a puncture
in the upper gastric area.

325
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,000
How the hell could he tell that
by looking at his face?

326
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,600
Background just came in from Chicago.

327
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
About time. What have we got?

328
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,100
"Richard David Kimble, vascular surgeon."
What the hell is that?

329
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,800
Somebody that makes more money
than you.

330
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,900
"Convicted of first-degree murder
in the killing of his wife.

331
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,000
"Pleaded innocent."
Says a one-armed man did it.

332
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,600
Lots of friends.

333
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,100
Doctors, hospital staff.

334
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,700
We will start right there. I want phone-taps.
First, his lawyer.

335
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,100
You will never get that.

336
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Call Judge Rubin.
Tell him I want a load of phone-taps.

337
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
- Why are you yelling?
- I will call later...

338
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,400
...to tell him on who, if I am in a good mood.

339
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,200
Why not yell at her sometimes?

340
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,900
We got a call
from Harris Community Hospital.

341
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,800
The wounded guard swears
he saw Kimble outside E.R.

342
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,100
That's hot.

343
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,900
And an ambulance is missing.

344
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,200
Where the hell is he going
in an ambulance?

345
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Ambulance just spotted...

346
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,400
...two miles west of Dover Ville,
heading north, State Highway 53.

347
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,100
He's running out of luck!

348
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,500
<i>Get your maps out.</i>

349
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,300
<i>Check, sound check. Get your maps out.</i>

350
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,600
<i>I want to know all routes
in and out of that town.</i>

351
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,600
<i>We're headed north on Route 13,
in the direction of Barkley Dam.</i>

352
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,000
Son of a bitch!

353
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,000
<i>Don't lose that ambulance.</i>

354
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,500
<i>Visual location of an ambulance headed
north on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.</i>

355
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,700
<i>He will pass through a viaduct, right?</i>

356
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,200
<i>Get on the horn. Bring Biggs and Newman
in from the south side of the viaduct.</i>

357
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,700
<i>He's hauling ass.</i>

358
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,900
<i>Is there a tunnel between here and there?
We have Biggs and Newman?</i>

359
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,900
<i>Look on your map if you want to know
how to get there.</i>

360
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,400
<i>We got him!</i>

361
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,300
Watch out! Watch out!

362
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,400
- What the hell's going on?
- Get back in your car, sir!

363
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,200
Newman! Rock and roll!

364
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,200
Put a light in there!

365
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,300
What have you got?

366
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,100
I got nothing.

367
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,200
- What have you got?
- You got to be kidding me!

368
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,400
- You got to be kidding me!
- Shit!

369
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,700
Seal off the tunnel! Seal it off!

370
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,500
We got a gopher.

371
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,000
Shit! I just bought these shoes.

372
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,300
Shut up, Cosmo.

373
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,100
Which way, Sam?

374
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,800
I didn't kill my wife!

375
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,500
I don't care!

376
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,500
Put that gun down!

377
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,300
Put that gun down!

378
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,700
Now!

379
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,200
Hands up!

380
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,900
Over your head!

381
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,900
Turn around!

382
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,400
Do you want to get shot?

383
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,700
Pay attention!

384
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,900
Get down on your knees!

385
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,900
Right now!

386
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,700
What happened? Where'd he go?

387
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,400
He did a Peter Pan right here, off this dam!

388
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,900
Right here!

389
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,900
Down! Boom!

390
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,100
Holy shit!

391
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,100
Can we go home now?

392
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
No.

393
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,000
Holy shit!

394
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,500
There's no way out of here!

395
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,500
Go up the stairs! Up, up!

396
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,400
Poole! Get them down here now:
Helicopters, divers!

397
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,500
Have them turn that water off.
Come over here.

398
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,900
Put two patrol cars on that bridge
down there, four patrolmen.

399
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,800
Have them glass this river,
upstream and down.

400
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,800
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this river.
Make him aware of these wires.

401
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,000
Are you out of your mind? He's dead!

402
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,100
That will make him easy to catch.

403
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,600
I want hounds on both banks
of this river for two miles...

404
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,000
...upstream and downstream.

405
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,700
You have got a search-and-rescue team
in this county?

406
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,200
Get them down here
and drag the bottom of this spillway.

407
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,300
- Why can't they turn off the water?
- Somebody from County's working on it.

408
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,900
Bring in the helicopter now.

409
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,800
We're out of here!

410
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,400
I don't think there's anything to find.

411
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,200
Find it anyway. You have got lights
and generators coming tonight.

412
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,300
- I don't want to tell you your job...
- Put the helicopter on the bridge!

413
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,300
...but only one in a million could survive
that fall. The guy is fish food!

414
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,200
Get a cane pole.
Go catch the fish that ate him.

415
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,600
Get Stevens. Tell him we're on the way in.

416
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,200
<i>That man took everything from me!</i>

417
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,600
We can't find the guy.

418
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,300
<i>We can't find the guy.</i>

419
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,800
<i>You find that man!</i>

420
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,500
<i>You find that man!</i>

421
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,600
The generators and searchlights are there.

422
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,500
They will continue the body search
into the night.

423
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,600
Good. Call Kentucky
and thank them for the dogs.

424
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,400
Remember, opera ain't over
until the Big Dog howls.

425
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,500
Need a ride?

426
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,500
Check it again.

427
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,900
All right, we got him. He shacked up
with some babe over in Whiting.

428
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,600
She left work tonight and took him home.

429
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,100
- About two hours ago, her boss said.
- They spotted her car outside her house.

430
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,300
Does she run with anybody in the area?

431
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,300
Nothing that we could find.
No family either.

432
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,300
Tell the police not to move till we get
there. We will go first thing in the morning.

433
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,100
Your cousin still got his truck?

434
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,800
Call him. Tell him we need it.

435
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,400
Be drunk, Newman.

436
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,100
Stay close.

437
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,800
Right on your ass, buddy.

438
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,900
I don't want you getting lost.
You stick with me.

439
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
U.S. marshals! Everybody down!

440
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,100
Hold it right there! Show me those hands!

441
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,800
Keep them up!

442
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,600
Get your ass in there.

443
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,100
I got your man! I got your man,
you hear me?

444
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,700
I want out of here!

445
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,600
I got your man!

446
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,600
I am going to blow his brains out!
I want out of here!

447
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,100
Do you hear me?

448
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,100
Do you hear me?

449
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,800
I want out of here!

450
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,200
- Listen! We can work this out!
- Yes, we can.

451
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,400
Shut up! Shut up!

452
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,300
Do you hear me?

453
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,800
Listen, and I will tell you what I want.

454
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,900
I just want a car out front.

455
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,700
Don't shoot.

456
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,800
It's over.

457
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Shut up!

458
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,600
I can't hear anything. My ear is...

459
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,400
I can't believe you did that.

460
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,500
You think I should have bargained
with that guy.

461
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Yeah.

462
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I do.

463
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,400
You could have missed.

464
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,300
You could have killed me.

465
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,300
How bad is that ear?

466
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,500
Bad. I will have permanent hearing damage.

467
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,800
Let me see it.

468
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,300
Come here.

469
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,500
Can you hear what I am saying now?

470
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,700
Yeah.

471
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,300
I don't...

472
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,600
...bargain.

473
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,000
You hear that?

474
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,100
Yeah.

475
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,800
Okay.

476
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,300
Walter, this is Richard.

477
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,600
<i>Richard, Jesus! Why did you run?
Running only makes you look guilty.</i>

478
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,600
I wasn't worried about appearances,
Walter.

479
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,100
<i>Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.</i>

480
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,700
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

481
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,100
You're asking me to harbor and aid
a convicted felon. I can't do that.

482
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,500
<i>My advice both as your friend
and legal counselor is to give yourself up.</i>

483
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,800
<i>Now tell me, where are you?</i>

484
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,900
St. Louis.

485
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,100
<i>Give me an address.
I will get there as soon as I can.</i>

486
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,400
Mr. Copeland was a bad man.
He was going to kill one of my kids.

487
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,000
Well, sir, you can blame me.
I am the one that shot him.

488
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,700
<i>...give yourself up.
Now tell me, where are you?</i>

489
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,600
<i>St. Louis.</i>

490
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,600
So he showed up not dead.
Let that be a lesson to you.

491
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,100
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog.
Big Dog is always right.

492
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,700
Yeah, you have been right before.

493
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,300
<i>Walter, this is Richard.</i>

494
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,300
<i>Richard, Jesus! Why did you run?
Running only makes you look guilty.</i>

495
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,500
<i>I wasn't worried about appearances,
Walter.</i>

496
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,200
<i>Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.</i>

497
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,700
<i>I won't surrender. I need help, money.</i>

498
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,600
I might be crazy,
but that train sounds like an el.

499
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,700
St. Louis doesn't have an elevated train.

500
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,000
How do you know it's an elevated train?

501
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,200
I lived under an el for 20 years.

502
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:17,000
You can explain the difference in the sound of 
an elevated train and a train on the ground.

503
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,400
You have got ears of an eagle.

504
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,100
Play that back. I want to hear 
the sound of an elevated train.

505
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,800
What cities have el's?
New York has got an el.

506
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,300
- Philly.
- We do.

507
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,600
Milwaukee has got an el.

508
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,700
Stop! Where the lawyer says
he sounds guilty. There's bells.

509
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,600
There's a guy on a PA.
Can you drop everything but him?

510
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,700
I will try. Hold on.

511
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,100
Right there.

512
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,400
What's he saying?

513
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,600
Sounds like "Next stop." Do that again!

514
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,600
"Next stop"...

515
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,900
"Merchandise Mart."

516
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,300
Son of a bitch! Our boy came home.

517
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,000
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge,
it's six blocks away.

518
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,700
I knew that was an elevated train.

519
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,100
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.

520
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,400
- I will call the C.P.D.
- This is your Chicago file.

521
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,000
<i>Andiamo, bambini.</i>

522
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,700
Sammy, when I die,
I want to come back just like you.

523
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,300
Happy and handsome?

524
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,900
- I will notify the press.
- No press.

525
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,400
Right, no press.

526
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,200
- Hi, Billy.
- How's it going, sir?

527
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,100
- Good, and you?
- All right.

528
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,300
- Here you go, Billy.
- Have a good one, sir.

529
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,000
Spare change? Dollar, mister?

530
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,400
No, thank you very much. I don't want it.

531
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,500
Oh, my God. Richard!

532
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,700
How are you, Charlie?

533
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,300
Jesus, you're back.

534
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,700
I need some money.

535
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,300
Sure, sure. Get in.

536
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,000
No, I can't. Just whatever you got on you.

537
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,500
You're hot, pal. If not now, you will be.

538
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,800
Have you got a place to stay?
I mean, how can I help you?

539
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,300
<i>You have got a green light. Move on!</i>

540
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,200
I will call you.

541
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,200
<i>So why did Richard Kimble kill his wife?</i>

542
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,800
He did it for the money.

543
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,700
What do you mean? He's a doctor.
He's already rich.

544
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,200
She was more rich.

545
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,200
Is this the entire
Chicago Police Department file?

546
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,500
- That's everything.
- I want to do all these interviews again.

547
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,000
- The list of hospital staff, is it in the file?
- Sure is.

548
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,200
Thank you.

549
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,000
You don't want to use the media?

550
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,800
We want him to relax. Make himself
comfortable. Try to re-enter his life.

551
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,100
Here's the apartment.

552
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,400
You can see here is heater.
You will have warm.

553
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,900
Here is kitchen. Sink.

554
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,000
Over there is bathroom.
And here is the room.

555
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,700
Is nice bed.

556
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,300
Plenty space.

557
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,800
You can look at.

558
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,100
So you like the place?

559
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,900
It's okay with you?

560
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,900
It's perfect.

561
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,100
<i>All right, people.</i>

562
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:06,300
<i>As of this morning, we were notified
by the U.S. Marshal's Office...</i>

563
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,200
<i>...that our old friend Dr. Richard Kimble
is alive and well and back here in Chicago.</i>

564
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,800
<i>You all know in what high regard
we hold this scumbag.</i>

565
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,600
<i>So I am personally donating
a bottle of 12-year-old Scotch...</i>

566
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,300
<i>...to whoever puts the collar on this quack.</i>

567
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,800
<i>Rosetti is passing out bulletins.</i>

568
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,200
Gunshot wound to the left shoulder.

569
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,200
Help you?

570
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,800
<i>Gracias.</i>

571
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,800
You went to medical school together?

572
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,300
Yes, we did.

573
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,700
The class of '73.

574
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,100
You know Morton Feinberg?

575
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,100
- I do.
- He's a real nice guy.

576
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,300
When did you see him last?

577
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,700
Who, Richard?

578
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,300
I saw Richard this morning.

579
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,700
You saw him this morning?

580
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,300
He stopped me in my car.
I gave him some money.

581
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,200
Where was this?

582
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,900
Outside my tennis club.

583
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,300
Did he ask you for help?

584
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,400
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.

585
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,300
How much money did you give him?

586
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,800
Couple of bucks. Just what I had on me.

587
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,300
- He won't get far on that.
- Why'd he come back to Chicago?

588
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,800
He didn't tell me that, sir.

589
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,200
I am sure he's trying to protect you
from having to lie for him, but...

590
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,900
You really want to help him, be his friend?

591
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,200
Help us bring him in unharmed.

592
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,900
Why?

593
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,600
So he can go back to prison?

594
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,800
If you want help, gentlemen,
you have come to the wrong man.

595
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,200
Richard is innocent.

596
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,300
You will never find him. He's too smart.

597
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,800
We're some smart guys.

598
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,500
What about us? We're smart. We are.
How smart could he be, really?

599
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,100
Is he as smart as you are?

600
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,900
Smarter.

601
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,600
Peripheral vascular surgery. Fixing
the arteries as they come out of the heart.

602
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,400
- How long have you known Kimble?
- Ten years. Since I have been here.

603
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,900
What kind of medicine did he practice
here at the hospital?

604
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:42,300
I want you to know
that I believe Kimble to be innocent.

605
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,500
Would he come to you for help?

606
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,600
If he came to me, I would help.

607
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,900
But he wouldn't come to me.

608
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,500
That's not his style.

609
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:12,000
<i>A warrant remains outstanding
for Chicago surgeon, Richard Kimble.</i>

610
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:30,700
This is where the one-armed guy struggled,
fell down the stairs.

611
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,000
If I fell down these stairs, I'd be a goner.
I'd be dead.

612
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,000
What a waste!

613
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,500
<i>When I came home,
there was a man in my house.</i>

614
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,200
Richard.

615
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,400
You like stringing out
12-year-old girls, huh?

616
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,200
What are you doing to my baby?

617
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,400
Your baby's a drug dealer, lady.

618
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,100
Come on, ma'am.

619
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,200
What they doing to my baby?

620
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,400
It will be crazy here tonight.
Did they get a count?

621
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,200
There were a lot of kids.

622
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,400
They bring them all here?

623
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,500
They're all coming down here to County.

624
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I have come to do those blinds.

625
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,600
I will get the door.

626
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,700
- I will start in here, huh?
- Okay.

627
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,100
Let's go over it once more.

628
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,400
What time did he arrive at the house?

629
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,600
About 10:30 in the morning.

630
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,700
- And he was alone?
- Yeah, he was alone.

631
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,800
- You got a good look at him?
- Yeah, a real good look.

632
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,900
Be straight with me, kid.

633
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,000
This is the guy staying
in your mother's basement?

634
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,200
That's what I am telling you.

635
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,300
Is she stable?

636
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,100
Breathe. Just stay calm.

637
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,700
I need a doctor over here!

638
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,400
Watch the bag! Watch the bag!

639
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,100
Hello, Marshal. It's right there.

640
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,200
My chest hurts.

641
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,400
Check the film on that kid.

642
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,800
Take a deep breath.

643
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,300
Inhale, exhale. Again.

644
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:18,700
Slowly.

645
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,000
Check the film.

646
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,900
Take it easy.

647
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,700
What's the status on that kid?

648
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,300
Possible fractured sternum.

649
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,200
Get over here. I need you.

650
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,300
Can you help us?
Bring this kid to Observation Room 2.

651
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,900
Yeah, you. Come on, help us out, okay?

652
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,200
How are you, champ?

653
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,600
My chest hurts.

654
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,500
Does it hurt when you breathe?

655
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,600
Yes.

656
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,400
- What's your name?
- Joel.

657
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,500
Look at this.

658
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,600
We're eating oranges
and we're making IDs.

659
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,800
"C.C.H." What the hell is that?

660
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,200
Cook County Hospital.

661
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
Just hang on, okay?

662
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,000
You will be okay, pal.

663
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,300
You will be just fine.

664
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,100
Hold that elevator.

665
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,900
Thank you.

666
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,400
How are you doing?

667
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,100
My chest hurts.

668
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,400
Where's your mom, pal?

669
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,600
I don't know.

670
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,600
Is she at home?

671
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,800
I think she's with my brother.

672
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,600
Your brother? They're downstairs?

673
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,100
I don't know.

674
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,100
Don't worry.

675
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,000
We will find her for you.

676
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,700
What are you?
A football player? Baseball player?

677
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,100
Football.

678
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,200
Hold on, son.

679
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,300
Hey, Doctor.

680
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,600
They sent this one from downstairs.

681
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,900
Get this one into Room 4, stat.

682
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,200
Bye-bye, Joel.

683
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,600
Where's the boy I sent with the janitor?

684
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,800
- What boy?
- With the fractured sternum.

685
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,500
He never came through here.

686
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,900
He didn't?

687
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,200
No, he didn't.

688
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:00,000
Do you have a particular interest
in our patients' X-rays?

689
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,700
- What do you mean?
- I saw you looking at that boy's chest film.

690
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,900
- It's a hobby of mine.
- It's a hobby, really?

691
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:10,400
What are your other hobbies,
brain surgery?

692
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,200
- What do you want?
- To know how the boy got to surgery.

693
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,300
I am a janitor. I do what I am told.

694
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,500
That's bullshit!

695
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,300
Who changed those orders?

696
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,000
I don't know what you mean.

697
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,000
You stay right there.

698
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,600
Call Security!

699
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:01,700
Tell Stevens to get hold of that guy Kelly
over at C.P.D.

700
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,100
A guy disguised as a janitor orders
an emergency medical procedure...

701
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,000
...and all you did was
take away his ID card?

702
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,900
No, I called Security. He took off down
the hall. What was I supposed to do?

703
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,400
Listen, Mr...

704
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,800
Deputy.

705
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,300
Gerard.

706
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,300
I am really tired.

707
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,000
I'd like to go home now.

708
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,400
Okay. How's the boy doing?

709
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,900
He saved his life.

710
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,100
Thank you.

711
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,500
"Desmondo Jos Ruiz."

712
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,800
Where are you at, Desmondo?

713
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,100
All right, Sam, this is my problem.

714
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,400
The place is crawling with cops, right?

715
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,900
Everybody's looking for
Richard Kimble, right?

716
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,000
So why would a guy be stupid enough...

717
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,500
...to be in the trauma ward
and play Mother Teresa?

718
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,700
Excuse me.

719
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,500
- You guys have a problem?
- No.

720
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,300
No. No problem at all.

721
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,500
Excuse me,
could we have a word with you, please?

722
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,700
This is Dr. Elway at Cook County Hospital.

723
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:48,400
I am doing follow-up work
for the prosthetic clinic on Matthew Zelick.

724
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,700
Oh, he did?

725
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,400
I am terribly sorry.

726
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,700
Right or left?

727
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,100
Right.

728
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,200
- Age?
- Thirty-five to forty-five.

729
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,400
This is Ted Riley with the High School
Reunion Committee.

730
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,300
Twenty-five years are right
around the corner...

731
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,900
...and Clive is on our list
of "Missing in Action."

732
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,700
Information gave me a number,
but when I tried it--

733
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,900
No kidding.

734
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,100
Armed robbery?

735
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,200
He's where?

736
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,500
Point of attachment?

737
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,700
Mid-humerus.

738
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,100
That gives us 47 possibles.

739
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,300
Forty-seven?

740
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,800
Cross-check these people
for criminal records.

741
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,900
Wait a minute.

742
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,300
<i>Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.</i>

743
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,800
Driscoll, Clive R.

744
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,500
One-armed man, armed robbery.
That's funny.

745
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,700
Let me ask a question:

746
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,800
If they can dye this river green today...

747
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,500
...why can't they dye it blue
the other 364 days?

748
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,400
Do I know?

749
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,400
- So, what are you Irish, sir?
- Who, me? No.

750
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,900
Are you?

751
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,400
No, man!

752
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,200
Name of inmate?

753
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,800
Clive Driscoll.

754
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,600
Driscoll, Clive.

755
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,300
ID, please.

756
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,400
Driscoll, Clive R.

757
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,100
2-0-1-0.

758
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:32,700
Be advised that under federal court ruling,
your conversation can be recorded.

759
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,100
Sign here, please.

760
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:38,800
This is hinky. He is a college graduate.
He wouldn't go through all this security...

761
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,200
...go to the county lock-up to find someone
his own people say doesn't exist.

762
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,400
Hinky.

763
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,000
What does that mean, "hinky"?

764
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,300
- Strange.
- Weird.

765
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:50,000
Say "strange" or "weird."
"Hinky" has no meaning.

766
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,500
We say "hinky."

767
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:57,500
I don't want you using meaningless words
around me. I am taking the stairs.

768
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,600
How about "bullshit"?

769
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,900
Visitor for Driscoll.

770
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,600
Come on, let's go.

771
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,600
Over there.

772
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,200
Let's go, Driscoll.

773
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,300
You have got five minutes.

774
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,500
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

775
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,500
<i>Look, I am sorry. I made a mistake.</i>

776
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,400
<i>You got me down here...</i>

777
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,000
<i>...might as well talk.</i>

778
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,400
<i>There ain't no entertainment.
Ain't no cable in this damn place.</i>

779
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,300
<i>Listen, pal, I wish I could, but I can't.
Sorry.</i>

780
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,500
Richard!

781
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:03,000
There is a man in a blue coat
waving a gun and screaming at a woman.

782
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,300
Stop that man!

783
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,000
He's a U.S. marshal! Let him go!

784
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,600
Let him go!

785
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,300
Close the gates!

786
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,400
Hold it!

787
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,300
Open the door!

788
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,800
We're on the roof.

789
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,300
Take some men! Look down there!

790
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,600
Jesus, he's in the plaza, Sam!

791
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,200
He's heading east!

792
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,100
<i>He's going east toward the Picasso!</i>

793
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,900
<i>Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.</i>

794
01:23:55,500 --> 01:24:00,400
Deputy Gerard, why do you feel
that Dr. Kimble came back to Chicago?

795
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:02,200
I have no idea.

796
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,200
We understand your deputies
were at County Hospital today.

797
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,200
Was Dr. Kimble at County Hospital?

798
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,500
I don't have any comment on that one.

799
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,600
Let me get the chronology straight.

800
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,600
The suspect was tried,
convicted, incarcerated...

801
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,500
...escaped, presumed dead, and is now
at large in Chicago. Is that correct, sir?

802
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,800
Except for being presumed dead.

803
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,000
Do you believe
that Kimble's armed and dangerous?

804
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,200
I believe he's dangerous, yes.

805
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,600
He's taking chances, coming back.
Do you feel perhaps he might be innocent?

806
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:36,100
No, he's not innocent. He was convicted
in a court of law. He's guilty.

807
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,400
What are you going to do next
to catch him?

808
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,000
We have no further comments for now.

809
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,200
Alec, Richard Kimble.

810
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:32,400
- How are you?
- Dr. Kimble.

811
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,900
Lentz!

812
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,100
<i>Sorry, we have been trading phone calls
the last few days.</i>

813
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,300
A cruise sponsored by Devlin MacGregor...

814
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,500
- ...that could be fun.
- Hi.

815
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,700
<i>- Cancn, Richard.
- Sport fishing.</i>

816
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,300
Pia coladas.

817
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,700
What must the hospital buy?
What's the catch?

818
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:17,800
Sailfish.

819
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,600
No, there are no strings attached.

820
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,700
<i>So, what do you say?</i>

821
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,800
This guy is bleeding
from every needle puncture.

822
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:33,300
Lentz sent this guy in?
Is he on that wonder drug?

823
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,200
Yes, he's on the RDU-90 protocol, Provasic.

824
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,700
Drug of the future, boys.

825
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:40,900
Clean out those arteries
and put us out of business.

826
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,700
"Parade Master of Ceremonies,
Ed O'Flaherty, said...

827
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,800
"...he didn't recall a livelier parade
during the last 20 years.

828
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,300
"That Kimble," listen...

829
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:58,300
"...is some kind of lad to be running out--"

830
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,700
- "Lad"?
- Yeah, "lad."

831
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:05,000
Maybe he's a leprechaun.
I am quoting this guy.

832
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,600
Some guy on line three
claims he's Richard Kimble.

833
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,400
- Who is it?
- We got another Kimble on line three.

834
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,400
- Let me see that phone.
- Tell him he looks good in a beard.

835
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,100
- What line?
- Three.

836
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,500
Ask him if he enjoyed the parade.

837
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,600
This is Gerard.

838
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,500
Do you remember what I told you
in the tunnel?

839
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:27,800
It's him!

840
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,100
I remember it was noisy.

841
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,900
Well, I think you said something like...

842
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,600
...you didn't kill your wife.

843
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,400
Remember what you told me?

844
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,800
I remember you were pointing
my gun at me.

845
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,900
You said, "I don't care."

846
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,800
He's on the South Side.

847
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,500
Yeah, Richard, that's right, I don't care.

848
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,600
I am not trying to solve a puzzle, here.

849
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,500
Well, I am trying to solve a puzzle.

850
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,200
Five seconds to location.

851
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,800
And I just found a big piece.

852
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,300
<i>Hello, Richard?</i>

853
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,300
He didn't hang up the phone.

854
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,200
Where is he?

855
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:15,700
256 South, St. Lawrence.

856
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,100
Get the C.P.D. right the hell over there.

857
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:20,600
We got a car there now.

858
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,200
Get a couple of shots of that.

859
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,900
Fredrick Sykes...

860
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:01,900
...45, ex-cop, and quite a clotheshorse.

861
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,300
You want to look at this?

862
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,600
Kimble's prints.
They're all over the room...

863
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,500
...mainly on the desk.

864
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:13,900
He was very interested
in these photographs. Especially these.

865
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,200
Negatives in there?

866
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,700
Let me have those things.

867
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,500
<i>- Camera boy's on his way.
- We got you.</i>

868
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,100
How are you doing, Mr. Sykes?

869
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,500
- Fine, if you tell me what's happening.
- We had a problem.

870
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,500
- My place or the place upstairs?
- Your place.

871
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,300
Step right in, Mr. Sykes.

872
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:50,400
Everybody knows my name here.
Big happy family, huh?

873
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,400
What is this, a trench coat convention?
What the hell is going on?

874
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,100
Who are you guys? What's going on?

875
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:03,100
You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes.

876
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,400
I sure hope you're a cop.

877
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:08,900
I am Samuel Gerard, U.S. Marshal's Office.

878
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:14,400
This morning, a fugitive named Richard
Kimble made a phone call from here.

879
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,500
Why would he do that?

880
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:19,100
I don't know any Richard Kimble.

881
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,000
Okay, I got it.

882
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,800
The doctor who killed his wife, right?

883
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:34,100
Kept blaming somebody
with a prosthetic limb. Is he after me?

884
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:36,100
Does he have a reason to do so?

885
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:38,900
I have a prosthetic arm!
I must have murdered his wife!

886
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,900
Give me a break.
I went through all this a year ago.

887
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:45,800
They came here and questioned me
about the whole thing.

888
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:50,200
I will tell you what I said. I wasn't in Chicago
that night. I was on a business trip.

889
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,000
Fifteen people verified it.

890
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,200
What line of business are you in?

891
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,700
Security.

892
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:58,300
- Who do you work for?
- A pharmaceutical company.

893
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,300
Which one?

894
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,000
Devlin MacGregor.
I handle security for all the top executives.

895
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:09,000
Do you have any idea why Kimble
would be interested in these photographs?

896
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,100
No.

897
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,900
Where were they taken?

898
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,700
Gee, that's a big fish!

899
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,100
Cancn, Mexico.

900
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:20,100
It was a junket the company paid for,
for some doctors.

901
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:23,400
- Kimble go with you?
- You don't see him there, do you?

902
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:28,600
No. I told you I don't know him.

903
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Do you mind if I look around
to see if anything's missing?

904
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,500
No, I don't mind.

905
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,200
How did you lose that arm?

906
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,000
In the line of duty.

907
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,300
Cosmo, this guy's dirty.

908
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,500
Yes, he is.

909
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,900
- You want our people on him?
- Yes. Build a camp here.

910
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,700
I will take care of it.

911
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:08,000
See this picture? I want you to find out
who the guy is next to Sykes.

912
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,900
Find out his name, his age, his weight,
his Social Security number...

913
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:15,700
...his location, relatives, pets, everything.

914
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:38,800
I am so sorry, Doctor,
they said it was an emergency.

915
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:42,600
Excuse me.

916
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,800
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Bolton?</i>

917
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,200
Chuck.

918
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,400
<i>Richard.</i>

919
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:00,800
Yeah, can you talk?

920
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,900
Yes, I am on a hotel phone.
So, how are you? What's going on?

921
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,900
I found him, Chuck.
I found the man who killed Helen.

922
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:12,000
- What?
- It was me they were after.

923
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:13,900
Who are they?

924
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,900
Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.

925
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,400
Lentz was supervising
the protocol for RDU-90.

926
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,800
He knew I found out it was causing
liver damage. It was Lentz.

927
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,500
Richard, Lentz is dead.

928
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:31,900
- What? 
- How?

929
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,200
<i>He died in a car accident last summer.</i>

930
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,200
Can you prove this about the drug?

931
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,300
Yeah, I think so.

932
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,300
I need your help, Chuck.

933
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,100
Call Bones at the hospital.
Tell him to give me whatever help I need.

934
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,700
I will call him right away.

935
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:55,300
Okay. Thanks.

936
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:06,600
Dr. Nichols!

937
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,500
Can we ask you a few more questions?

938
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,100
Mr. Gerard.

939
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:13,800
You got a copy of that photograph?

940
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,600
U.S. Marshal Service.

941
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,000
Excuse us.

942
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,800
This is Fredrick Sykes.

943
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:26,000
He's a security specialist
at Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

944
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,500
Richard Kimble broke into his apartment.

945
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,100
Do you know this man?

946
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,700
I don't know him.

947
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:36,400
You're getting pretty desperate,
aren't you, Mr. Gerard?

948
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,000
Oh, yeah.

949
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,700
I told you, you wouldn't find Richard.

950
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:43,100
- Has he been to see you?
- No.

951
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,800
We have been over this ground before,
haven't we?

952
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,400
So, if you will excuse me.

953
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,600
Sure.

954
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,700
Thanks, Doc.

955
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:02,100
Sorry, I want to ask you
one more question about the photograph.

956
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:05,100
See the guy standing
on the right side of the fish?

957
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:06,900
- Ever see him before?
- No.

958
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,800
This guy right here?

959
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,000
I have never seen that person
in my life before.

960
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,100
I am sorry.

961
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,300
Thank you.

962
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:19,000
Thank you, Doctor.
Enjoy the rest of the convention.

963
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:28,700
"Alternatives to Cardio-Non-Invasive
Arterial Plaque-Reducing Therapy.

964
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:31,200
"Keynote speaker, Charles Nichols."

965
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,500
Bet you they line up to hear this one.

966
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:52,100
If you were Richard Kimble...

967
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:56,200
...why would you hunt for a one-armed
man you say killed your wife...

968
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,500
...break into his house,
call us up and then split?

969
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,100
- Doesn't make sense.
- I should have been a doctor.

970
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,500
Look at this blow-up. This guy
in the picture with Sykes. On his shirt.

971
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,000
"Chicago Memorial."

972
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,500
- Kimble's hospital. I want to go.
- Go!

973
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:12,000
Wait.

974
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,900
Devlin MacGregor...

975
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,900
...did 7.5 billion dollars net sales...

976
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:23,600
...last year alone.

977
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,400
That company is a monster.

978
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,300
Yeah, talk to me.

979
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,000
Absolutely.

980
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,700
It's a liver sample...

981
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:48,600
...from a patient on the RDU-90 drug study.

982
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,600
January 21?

983
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,200
The last one!

984
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,100
1-7-4-3-0?

985
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:58,600
1-7-4-3-0. You got it.

986
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:03,200
Thanks. I will make sure
all this stuff gets back to you.

987
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:10,200
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

988
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:13,200
Whatever happened to that thing
with your wife?

989
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,500
It's not over yet.

990
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,600
What's going on?

991
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:41,500
How should I know?

992
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:58,100
I think his name is Alec Lentz.
A pathologist.

993
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:01,300
I remember because he died last summer.

994
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:12,000
Oh, my God. Richard!

995
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,800
What are you doing here?

996
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,200
Hi, Kath.

997
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:33,100
Have a look.

998
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:37,700
- What do you think?
- Cold normal.

999
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:40,200
Clearly not the same tissue.

1000
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:44,000
And not only did they all come
from healthy livers...

1001
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,800
...they all came from the same liver.

1002
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:50,300
Kath, you beauty.

1003
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,000
Excuse me.

1004
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,200
Mr. Roosevelt?

1005
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:05,100
I am Deputy Biggs, this is Deputy Newman.
We're U.S. marshals.

1006
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:08,800
We need some information about
a Dr. Lentz who was on the staff here.

1007
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,500
I want to know if he knew or had
any contact with a Dr. Richard Kimble?

1008
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:15,800
I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.

1009
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,400
I didn't ask that.

1010
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,000
I wouldn't know.

1011
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:25,100
If you will excuse me,
I have prior obligations to attend to.

1012
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,900
I think you're lying to us.

1013
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:33,300
You think Lentz is the bad guy?

1014
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,900
Yeah, why not?

1015
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:41,100
He was one of the original
patent boys in RDU-90.

1016
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,700
I was sending in my tissue samples...

1017
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:49,100
...he was replacing them with
healthy samples, issuing the path reports...

1018
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:51,300
...and shit-canning my stuff. Piece of cake.

1019
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:52,400
Wait a minute.

1020
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:55,200
Lentz died August 21.

1021
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:01,700
Half the samples he approved
were signed the day he died.

1022
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,300
You're kidding.

1023
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,900
Someone else must have been
manipulating this.

1024
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,100
Someone with access.

1025
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,000
Thanks, Kath.

1026
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,900
Where are you going?

1027
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,700
To see a friend.

1028
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,900
This is giving me a headache.

1029
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:40,100
That's surprising. Where did
Roosevelt say Kimble was going?

1030
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,400
He says he doesn't know
where Kimble was going.

1031
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,800
<i>- Do you believe him?
- Yes, I believe him.</i>

1032
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,600
<i>He says he was here to pick up
some tissue samples...</i>

1033
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,200
<i>...for a drug study.</i>

1034
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,900
But listen, get this.

1035
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:54,100
The release was approved
by Dr. Charles Nichols.

1036
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:57,600
<i>Nichols also knew Lentz.</i>

1037
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,900
<i>He was Lentz's boss.</i>

1038
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,600
He was covering for Kimble.

1039
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,600
Send the C.P.D. over there right now.

1040
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:08,100
We're going to send a bunch of cops.
Make sure they turn that place inside out.

1041
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:11,600
Don't let them give you shit
about your ponytail either. Well done.

1042
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:13,300
My pleasure, Sam.

1043
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,100
Dr. Nichols lied to me.

1044
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:20,200
- Go find him.
- I am on it.

1045
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:29,600
It's gone by now.

1046
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,300
I looked every place you told me
to look and I didn't see him.

1047
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:34,700
I am telling you.

1048
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:37,800
If he was in the hospital,
I would have found him.

1049
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,900
So what do you want me to do?

1050
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,800
Hold on. Wait a minute.

1051
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,500
I marked him. I got him now.

1052
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,700
Dr. Alexander Lentz.

1053
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:20,300
"A noted pathologist
at Chicago Memorial Hospital...

1054
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:24,100
"...was walking to his daily tennis match
when an unidentified vehicle...

1055
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:25,700
"...slammed his body...

1056
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:29,600
"...into the barriers that separate
the drive from Lake Michigan."

1057
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,400
Sam, you're not going to believe this.

1058
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:38,000
Sykes' records for the past two years
show no calls to Kimble.

1059
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,500
It was a thought.

1060
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,200
But when I cross-checked
Kimble's phone records, one came up.

1061
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:45,000
Kimble called Sykes.

1062
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:48,500
Get Sykes in here now.

1063
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:50,400
On the night of his wife's murder...

1064
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:51,900
...7:30 p.m...

1065
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,600
...from his car phone.

1066
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,200
Do you have that arrest report on Kimble?

1067
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:03,800
- 7:30 p.m.
- 19:30 hours.

1068
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,100
They just went in. Sykes is gone.

1069
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:10,500
- He's nowhere to be found.
- What?

1070
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:11,900
He's gone.

1071
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:24,100
I got a possible sighting of Richard Kimble
on northbound el coming into Van Buren.

1072
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,500
Move to the door, Doc.

1073
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,700
This is my stop.

1074
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:45,800
This is my stop, too.

1075
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:47,600
You missed your stop.

1076
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:14,400
A transit cop spotted Kimble on the el,
he is heading toward Balbo.

1077
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,200
The C.P.D. is on the way.

1078
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:56,500
<i>Attention all units. Transit police
report officer down at Balbo Station.</i>

1079
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:59,400
<i>Kimble is suspect. Repeat, officer down.</i>

1080
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:01,300
What did he do, shoot a cop?

1081
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:03,500
Chicago P.D. will eat him alive.

1082
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:14,600
<i>It is a joy and a privilege
to introduce tonight's keynote speaker.</i>

1083
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:27,200
<i>For the past four years...</i>

1084
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,700
<i>...he has served
as the A. Jude Robinson Fellow...</i>

1085
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:34,100
<i>...and Administrative Chief of Pathology...</i>

1086
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:36,700
<i>...at Chicago Memorial Hospital.</i>

1087
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:43,700
Where are the emergency exits?

1088
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:48,800
<i>Suspect seen entering Hilton Tower Mall,
lower level. Repeat...</i>

1089
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,700
You don't think--

1090
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,400
I know where he's going.

1091
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:56,200
Biggs, Newman, come in, where are you?

1092
01:50:57,600 --> 01:51:00,200
<i>He's been appointed
to the Board of Directors...</i>

1093
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,700
<i>...of Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.</i>

1094
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:05,400
<i>Will you all please give a warm welcome...</i>

1095
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:08,000
<i>...to Dr. Charles Nichols.</i>

1096
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,100
<i>Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1097
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:19,200
<i>...my friends and colleagues.</i>

1098
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:22,000
<i>It's great you're all here tonight.</i>

1099
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:38,300
C.P.D. reported an officer down
and a guy with two guns--

1100
01:51:38,300 --> 01:51:40,600
- Kimble do it?
- Conflicting reports.

1101
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:42,600
He entered the hotel from the subway.

1102
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,400
- That's my man!
- Not anymore.

1103
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,700
He's going down.
You can help by staying out.

1104
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,100
Arrest us!

1105
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:50,600
Lock it up! Start at the lower level.

1106
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:55,900
<i>All units report when lower level is secure.</i>

1107
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:01,000
<i>All units secure all lower level exits.</i>

1108
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:06,000
Go and find the hotel security office.
Stay in touch with me on the radio.

1109
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:10,300
<i>Now, a new drug...</i>

1110
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:14,500
<i>...on the cusp of approval
by the Food and Drug Administration...</i>

1111
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:18,600
<i>...is poised to change
these old methods forever.</i>

1112
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,900
Deputy Newman, U.S. Marshal's Service.

1113
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,800
Sam, I am in.

1114
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:32,200
<i>...through the normal metabolic pathways
in the liver.</i>

1115
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,500
<i>The drug's name is...</i>

1116
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,100
<i>...Provasic.</i>

1117
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:40,800
<i>As I will show you tonight...</i>

1118
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,800
<i>...Provasic is remarkably effective...</i>

1119
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:47,100
<i>...and has no side effects whatsoever.</i>

1120
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:50,000
<i>It is also noteworthy that this drug...</i>

1121
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:57,500
<i>That this drug was developed...</i>

1122
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:01,000
<i>...in cooperation, not competition,
with Chicago Memorial Hospital...</i>

1123
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,900
<i>...in what we hope will be...</i>

1124
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:05,900
<i>...the model for a continued dishonest...</i>

1125
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,300
<i>...excuse me, honest...</i>

1126
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:13,300
<i>...open joint ventures...</i>

1127
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:15,900
<i>...between academic medicine...</i>

1128
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:18,200
<i>...and the pharmaceutical industry...</i>

1129
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,600
<i>Richard!</i>

1130
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,500
<i>I am sorry, I am in the middle of this speech.</i>

1131
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,900
You almost got away with it, didn't you?

1132
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:30,900
I know all about it.

1133
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:34,000
I can prove it.

1134
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:39,500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, my friend,
Richard Kimble doesn't feel well...</i>

1135
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:41,100
<i>...obviously...</i>

1136
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:44,900
<i>...so it you just go on
with your dessert and coffee...</i>

1137
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:48,600
<i>Richard, do you mind to step aside
and let's talk.</i>

1138
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:53,500
<i>So I will be back in just a second.</i>

1139
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:59,700
You changed the samples, didn't you?

1140
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:03,900
You switched the samples...

1141
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:05,700
...after Lentz died.

1142
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,900
<i>Let's stay calm, people.</i>

1143
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:14,700
After Lentz died,
you were the only one who had the access.

1144
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:18,000
You switched the samples...

1145
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:20,800
...and the pathology reports.

1146
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,400
You killed Lentz, too?

1147
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:23,900
<i>Can we get some Security?</i>

1148
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,100
Did you?

1149
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,500
He falsified his research...

1150
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:32,300
...so RDU-90 could be...

1151
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,900
...approved and...

1152
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:37,200
...Devlin MacGregor
could give you Provasic.

1153
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:40,900
<i>All right, it's all over, folks.</i>

1154
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:42,600
<i>Let's just stay calm.</i>

1155
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:02,200
You never give up, Richard, do you?
You never give up!

1156
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,400
Why Helen?

1157
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:30,400
Glad you're here.

1158
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,000
Which way did they go?

1159
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,200
- Toward the Presidential Suite.
- Where's that?

1160
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:37,200
- Southeast corner.
- How many exits are there from this room?

1161
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:40,600
We got a total of four:
Two on the east, two on the west.

1162
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:43,200
Kimble's on the roof!

1163
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,300
Cosmo, that way.

1164
01:55:58,100 --> 01:56:00,400
<i>Stop! Stay where you are!</i>

1165
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:02,400
<i>This is the Chicago police!</i>

1166
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
<i>Put your hands in the air!</i>

1167
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,500
<i>The building is totally secure.</i>

1168
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:10,200
<i>I repeat, do not move!</i>

1169
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:12,900
<i>Put your hands in the air!</i>

1170
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,800
<i>I repeat, stay where you are!</i>

1171
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:40,900
Talk to me.

1172
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:43,700
They're headed to the north end
of the roof.

1173
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:45,100
Newman!

1174
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:48,200
Get that helicopter out of here!

1175
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:54,000
As soon as you get a clean shot...

1176
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,800
...you take him out.

1177
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:16,100
Newman, get rid of the helicopter!

1178
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:18,600
<i>- Why?
- Because I don't want to get shot!</i>

1179
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:22,700
C.P.D., there's a U.S. marshal
out on the roof. Hold your fire!

1180
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:25,300
<i>Call off the helicopter!</i>

1181
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,200
Don't shoot.

1182
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:19,300
Does this guy ever quit?

1183
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:21,700
Find out where that elevator stops.

1184
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,400
Northwest elevator! Where does it stop?

1185
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:27,600
Where did they go?

1186
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:00,300
They have stopped at the fifth floor.

1187
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:03,000
- What's on the fifth floor?
- The laundry.

1188
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,500
<i>They stopped at the laundry.</i>

1189
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:53,300
We're on the fifth floor. What's your 20?

1190
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,900
We're right behind you.

1191
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:58,000
What the hell is going on here?

1192
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:01,500
You got to keep the C.P.D. out.
They're much too hot to suit me.

1193
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:03,800
I want you to get rid of all these people.

1194
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,300
Okay, people, stay calm.

1195
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,000
Cosmo, come with me.

1196
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,900
Dr. Richard Kimble!

1197
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:33,900
There's no way out of here, Richard!

1198
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:38,000
The entire building is locked down!

1199
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:42,800
Give it up, you don't have any time!

1200
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:46,000
Chicago Police Department thinks
you're a cop killer!

1201
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:49,500
They will shoot you on sight!

1202
02:01:53,100 --> 02:01:55,200
Richard, I know you're innocent!

1203
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:59,000
I know about Fredrick Sykes!

1204
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:04,600
I know about Dr. Charles Nichols!

1205
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:09,900
Richard, he borrowed your car
the night of your wife's murder!

1206
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:11,600
He had the keys!

1207
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,800
No forced entry, Richard.

1208
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:18,000
He telephoned Sykes
from your car, Richard!

1209
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:27,300
Give it up!

1210
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:32,700
I am either lying or I am going to shoot you!

1211
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,300
What do you think?

1212
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:58,000
Give it up! It's time to stop running!

1213
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:40,500
They killed my wife.

1214
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:42,800
I know it, Richard.

1215
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,500
I know it.

1216
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:49,000
But, it's over now.

1217
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:53,800
You know, I am glad.

1218
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,700
I need the rest.

1219
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:12,200
Who killed Kimble's wife?

1220
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,300
Kimble was convicted of it.

1221
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:17,200
You have got a one-armed man in custody.

1222
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,500
- Is that the guy?
- I have no idea.

1223
02:04:19,500 --> 02:04:21,200
How many one-armed men are there?

1224
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:23,200
At this point, there're a lot of them.

1225
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:25,200
Could you have made a mistake?

1226
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,600
You got a deadline?
Play the weather over again.

1227
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,400
Tell Samuel Gerard I am going home now.
I am taking my vacation.

1228
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:46,000
Clear this area. Everybody clear.

1229
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:05,000
Watch your head.

1230
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:18,000
Where is that thing?

1231
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:20,600
Let me see those hands, Doctor.

1232
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,700
I thought you didn't care.

1233
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:42,000
I don't.

1234
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,800
Don't tell anybody, okay?

1235
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:02,200
