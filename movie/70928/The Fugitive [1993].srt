1
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:49,748
Come on, Doc.

2
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,592
Check this out.

3
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,811
Prints are right here.

4
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,352
<i>We're reporting to you live
from the home...</i>

5
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:09,898
<i>...of Dr. Richard Kimble...</i>

6
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,103
<i>...a respected vascular surgeon
at Chicago Memorial Hospital.</i>

7
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:14,605
<i>Details are sketchy...</i>

8
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:19,192
<i>...but we understand Dr. Kimble's wife,
Helen, was found murdered this evening.</i>

9
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:22,410
<i>Right now, Area Six detectives
are bringing out Dr. Kimble.</i>

10
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,991
<i>We assume that they're going to be taking
him to a police station, probably Area Six...</i>

11
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:31,710
<i>...where they hope he can shed some light
on what happened here this evening.</i>

12
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,797
<i>Now, as I indicated,
she was found shortly before midnight.</i>

13
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,002
We know that she made, apparently,
a 911 call to police...

14
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:41,428
<i>...indicating an intruder in the house
and she was being assaulted.</i>

15
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:43,258
<i>Details are very sketchy.</i>

16
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:46,008
<i>We do know that he and his wife Helen...</i>

17
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:49,187
<i>...were at the Four Seasons Hotel
earlier this evening...</i>

18
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,273
<i>...a fundraiser for
the Children's Research Fund.</i>

19
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,895
Rich, remember Cara?

20
00:03:58,114 --> 00:04:00,237
Nice to see you.

21
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,658
Straighten that arm or you're going to slice.

22
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:13,461
Golf pro teach you that?

23
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,910
My wife.

24
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,545
Before I forget...

25
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:22,424
...thanks for the loaner.
Keys are downstairs.

26
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,130
- Any gas in it?
- Yes. Enough.

27
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,058
Alec, Richard Kimble.

28
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,266
- How are you?
- Dr. Kimble!

29
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,556
Absolutely, anytime.

30
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:37,567
I think that's a great idea.

31
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,525
All right, you guys, knock it off!

32
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:43,616
There's nothing to see here.
And you, come with me.

33
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:47,282
Thank you.
I was just down to my last joke.

34
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,798
<i>You look really beautiful tonight.</i>

35
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,459
Thanks, honey.

36
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:08,095
I know you hate these things, but God,
I love looking at you in a tux.

37
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,807
I always feel I look like
a waiter or something.

38
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:18,899
Hello?

39
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,398
<i>- Dr. Kimble?
- Yes, it is.</i>

40
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:21,733
<i>Sorry to bother you, sir...</i>

41
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:25,406
<i>...but Dr. Stevens is in Emergency O.R.
and asked for your help.</i>

42
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,741
Call him back and tell him
I will be right there.

43
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,206
<i>Thank you, Doctor.</i>

44
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,951
Thank you. Good night.

45
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,830
I will wait up for you.

46
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,498
<i>I will wait up for you.</i>

47
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:09,527
<i>Talk to me. What have we got here?</i>

48
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:11,240
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

49
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:15,741
A 58-year-old guy.
Just pulled his gallbladder. Bleeding.

50
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,078
Big time. It's all in the liver bed.

51
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,413
- What are his coags?
- They're all messed up.

52
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,879
PT's 36 and the rest are off the wall.

53
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,545
Where is he from?

54
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:28,177
Lentz's name is on the chart.
We paged him, but no answer.

55
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:31,265
Okay, you guys. Let me in there.
Give me some room.

56
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,268
Give me a clamp.

57
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,891
Give me some suction in there.

58
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:38,602
<i>Have you been getting
any threats at work?</i>

59
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,687
Co-workers, hospital staff,
anything like that at all?

60
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,523
Anything unusual going on as far as...

61
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:49,399
...phone calls, people hanging up?

62
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,784
Maybe people coming to the door?

63
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:53,201
Tradespeople?

64
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:55,116
Not that I know of.

65
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,284
Now back to this fight
with this guy with the one arm.

66
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:02,251
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?

67
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:04,288
Upstairs.

68
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:07,130
Was it his right or left arm...

69
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,506
...that had that little gimmick on it?

70
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:12,506
Right arm.

71
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:15,264
Is it one of those with the hooks, or...

72
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:19,270
No, he had a cosmetic hand.

73
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,940
The security system in your house,
it's a pretty good system.

74
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:25,774
<i>Anyone have the coding
besides you and your wife?</i>

75
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,316
Our maid.

76
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:31,157
She knows the code
and has a key to the house.

77
00:07:32,787 --> 00:07:34,780
Those scratches on your neck...

78
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,532
...did the one-armed guy do that?

79
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:41,243
Helen scratched me
when I was trying to move her.

80
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:44,623
Before or after you had the fight
with the one-armed guy?

81
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,051
I told you.

82
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:48,886
You own a gun, Doc?

83
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:51,805
Do you own a gun?

84
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,598
Yes, we have a gun in the house.

85
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:57,393
Is it registered in your name?

86
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,344
Yes.

87
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:01,014
<i>Where do you usually keep that gun?</i>

88
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,768
<i>The one that you own.</i>

89
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:04,686
<i>It's in Helen's table.</i>

90
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,862
<i>Bedside table.</i>

91
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:10,069
<i>Do you keep much jewelry in the house?</i>

92
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,663
His fingerprints are all over the lamp...

93
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:17,072
...the gun and the bullets...

94
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:20,576
...and the good doctor's skin
is under her fingernails.

95
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:24,087
<i>She's got the money in the family,
hasn't she?</i>

96
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,458
Helen comes from a wealthy family, yes.

97
00:08:29,386 --> 00:08:30,796
Is she insured?

98
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:33,799
Yes, she is.

99
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,219
Who's the beneficiary?

100
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:39,969
I am.

101
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,603
The sole beneficiary?

102
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,813
Yes.

103
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,902
Financially, you won't
be hurting after this, are you?

104
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:52,897
I mean,
she was worth quite a bit of money.

105
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,736
Are you suggesting that I killed my wife?

106
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,668
Are you saying that I crushed her skull
and shot her?

107
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,664
How dare you!

108
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:08,747
When I came home,
there was a man in my house.

109
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:10,585
I fought with this man.

110
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,846
- The one-armed man?
- He had a mechanical arm.

111
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,554
- Plastic? Rubber?
- You find this man!

112
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,349
You find this man!

113
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:20,348
How tall was he?

114
00:09:20,348 --> 00:09:22,347
He took everything from me.

115
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:23,767
Oh, Jesus.

116
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,434
What did he weigh?

117
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,358
What color was his hair?

118
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:29,687
What color were his eyes?

119
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,655
<i>We can't help you until you help us.</i>

120
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,156
Book him.

121
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:39,454
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

122
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:43,869
...you will hear iron-clad proof
of Richard Kimble's guilt.

123
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:48,536
Indisputable scientific evidence...

124
00:09:48,536 --> 00:09:51,288
...that on the night of January 20...

125
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:54,041
...Richard Kimble did in fact viciously...

126
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,462
...attack...

127
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,551
...and brutally murder his wife.

128
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,472
But you will hear more than that.

129
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,228
You will hear a voice from the grave.

130
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:11,735
The voice of Helen Kimble
identifying her killer...

131
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:15,195
...her husband, Richard Kimble.

132
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:17,988
Detective Kelly...

133
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:21,992
...tell us what you observed at the victim's
home on the night of the murder.

134
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:23,991
No forcible entry was found.

135
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,166
<i>From the beginning of the investigation,
it didn't appear to be a break-in.</i>

136
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,751
<i>Nothing was missing.</i>

137
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:36,423
Honey, I am home.

138
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:38,674
Who won the game?

139
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:41,137
The defendant's prints
were on the gun and bullets.

140
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:44,638
<i>No other sets were found,
other than the housekeeper's...</i>

141
00:10:44,638 --> 00:10:46,307
<i>...and the deceased's.</i>

142
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:52,817
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused
a massive hemorrhage to the brain.

143
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,567
It took less than five minutes
for her to die.

144
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:16,547
Your Honor, we would ask to play
Helen Kimble's 911 emergency call...

145
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:20,753
...previously identified by
a Chicago Police Department dispatcher.

146
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:22,760
<i>Emergency 911.</i>

147
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,388
Please help me.

148
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:27,640
<i>What's the problem?</i>

149
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:31,313
<i>He's...</i>

150
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:33,773
<i>He's still in the house.</i>

151
00:11:33,773 --> 00:11:35,564
<i>Did I hear you right?</i>

152
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,488
<i>Someone's in your house?</i>

153
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:41,277
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

154
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,452
<i>Could you repeat that, please?</i>

155
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,161
<i>Ma'am?</i>

156
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,164
<i>He's trying to kill me.</i>

157
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:54,418
<i>Is your attacker still in the house?</i>

158
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:01,425
<i>Richard...</i>

159
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,093
Richard...

160
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:08,434
He's trying to kill me.

161
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:18,812
Mr. Kimble...

162
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:22,781
...having considered all the facts,
aggravation and mitigation in this case...

163
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:27,615
...and found the offense was brutal
and indicative of wanton cruelty...

164
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:33,251
...it's the judgment of this court, that you
be remanded to illinois State Penitentiary...

165
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:37,122
...where you will await execution
by lethal injection...

166
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:41,548
...on a date to be set forth
by the Attorney General of this state.

167
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:44,344
May God have mercy on your soul.

168
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:11,664
- Carlson.
- Here.

169
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:13,127
- Partida.
- Yeah.

170
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,045
- Copeland.
- What?

171
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,582
Copeland, you be nice now.

172
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:19,670
Kimble.

173
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:21,965
Yeah.

174
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,761
Let's go, gentlemen.

175
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,263
Four prisoners coming out.

176
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:56,289
Let's go, gentlemen.

177
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:01,210
Kimble, you're here.

178
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,629
Carlson, right over there.

179
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:07,970
Partida, up front left.

180
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:11,228
Copeland, you're back here with me.

181
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,556
Come on, make yourselves comfortable.

182
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:19,642
You know the routine, gentlemen.

183
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:49,973
I am tired.

184
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:55,980
Twenty miles from Menard.

185
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:58,515
We should be there in about 40 minutes.

186
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:03,357
I will be glad to get rid of this load.
Let McKenzie take care of them.

187
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:07,484
I hope he's got something good
to eat there. I am starving.

188
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:09,028
Me, too.

189
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,702
I have had enough of that prison chow.

190
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:19,170
Old Ed, he don't care.
His old lady's got him on a diet.

191
00:15:19,463 --> 00:15:20,625
Right, Ed?

192
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,718
Somebody get in here, quick!

193
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:38,304
He's getting sick! Let's go, move! Move!

194
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,565
- He's foaming at the mouth.
- We're almost at the prison.

195
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,478
He's choking! Come on!

196
00:15:45,072 --> 00:15:45,985
Wait!

197
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:44,457
Oh, shit!

198
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:50,374
Kimble, get over here.
You're a doctor, do something!

199
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:51,965
Unlock me!

200
00:16:57,394 --> 00:16:59,303
Hang in there. You will be okay.

201
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:06,563
What the hell is that?

202
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:12,236
Shit!

203
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:16,824
Give me a hand!

204
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:18,408
The hell with you.

205
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:20,325
Give me a hand with this man!

206
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,328
Kiss my ass, Doc.

207
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:46,354
Now, you listen.

208
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:49,138
I don't give a damn which way you go.

209
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:51,516
Just don't follow me. You got that?

210
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,354
Be good.

211
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:38,316
My, my!

212
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:40,235
What a mess.

213
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:42,069
It's a circus.

214
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:47,657
You got my bag?

215
00:20:49,752 --> 00:20:51,578
Point of impact, right here.

216
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:57,379
The first engine uncoupled,
and the rest of the train jumped the track.

217
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:58,748
About 100 yards?

218
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:00,506
You must get new boots.

219
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,173
I told you not to wear the heels.

220
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,592
Wear two coats.

221
00:21:03,592 --> 00:21:05,176
Next train wreck.

222
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,512
Why do we always mother her?

223
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,096
Because she loves us.

224
00:21:08,096 --> 00:21:12,184
- How'd you have liked to be the driver?
- I bet he did a Casey Jones.

225
00:21:12,184 --> 00:21:13,519
Hold it, sir.

226
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,234
Hi. Who's in charge?

227
00:21:15,861 --> 00:21:17,521
Sheriff Rawlins.

228
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,571
Just follow the TV lights.

229
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,194
Sheriff Rogers.

230
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,447
Rawlins!

231
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,781
Look down there and take Newman.

232
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,453
Come on. Time to go to work.

233
00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:38,543
The bus rolled over several times before
settling down at the bottom of the hill.

234
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:40,959
I don't know if I passed out or what...

235
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:45,051
...but when I looked up,
the train was bearing down on us. Fast.

236
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:48,474
I don't know how. It's still kind of hazy.

237
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:52,311
Somehow I grabbed him and pushed him
out of the bus.

238
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,482
- You're brave, you could have been killed.
- I know.

239
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,224
He's my partner.
He would have done the same for me.

240
00:21:58,224 --> 00:22:02,104
Excuse me, I am Deputy U.S. Marshal
Samuel Gerard, I'd like to--

241
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:04,566
I will be with you in just a minute.

242
00:22:06,328 --> 00:22:08,155
One more time, just for the record.

243
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:10,323
These three are dead.

244
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,745
And this one?

245
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:15,911
Everything happened so fast.

246
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:18,999
I don't think he made it.

247
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:22,715
Looks like you came a long way
for nothing.

248
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:24,712
With all due respect, Sheriff Rawlins...

249
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:27,557
...I'd like to suggest checkpoints
on a 15-mile radius...

250
00:22:27,557 --> 00:22:30,346
...at I-57, I-24 and over here on Route 13--

251
00:22:31,937 --> 00:22:34,262
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.

252
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:38,983
Checkpoints will get a lot of people frantic
and they will flood my office with calls.

253
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,394
Well, shit, I'd hate to see that happen...

254
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:44,062
...so I guess I will take over
your investigation.

255
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:48,411
On what authority?

256
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:49,824
The Governor of illinois...

257
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:51,871
...the U.S. Marshal's Office...

258
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,116
...Fifth District, Northern illinois.

259
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:58,957
All right, you want jurisdiction
over this mess. You got it.

260
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,373
Okay, boys, gather around and listen up.

261
00:23:01,373 --> 00:23:04,218
We're shutting it down.
Wyatt Earp's here to mop up...

262
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,509
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.

263
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:09,967
Wow. Gee whiz. Look here!

264
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:18,018
We're always fascinated when we find
leg irons with no legs in them.

265
00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:19,852
Who held the key, sir?

266
00:23:19,852 --> 00:23:21,023
Me.

267
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:22,855
Where are those keys at?

268
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:24,270
I don't know.

269
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,404
Care to revise your statement, sir?

270
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,357
What?

271
00:23:27,357 --> 00:23:30,197
Do you want to change
your bullshit story, sir?

272
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:36,079
He might have got out.

273
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,540
You said he was part of the wreckage!

274
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,749
Listen up, ladies and gentlemen!

275
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:44,675
Our fugitive has been
on the run for 90 minutes.

276
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:49,090
Average foot speed over uneven ground,
barring injury, is four miles an hour.

277
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,423
That gives us a radius of six miles.

278
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:58,262
What I want out of each and every one
of you is a hard-target search...

279
00:23:58,262 --> 00:23:59,637
...of every gas station...

280
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:03,561
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse,
hen house, outhouse...

281
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:05,481
<i>...and doghouse in that area.</i>

282
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:08,194
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.

283
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:13,243
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.

284
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,870
Go get him.

285
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:34,368
Please don't give me shit.

286
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:37,288
I got three very unhappy dead people.
Put him on.

287
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:39,449
Stevens, it's Cosmo.

288
00:25:39,449 --> 00:25:42,412
I will have a satellite telephone hookup
in two seconds.

289
00:25:42,412 --> 00:25:45,076
Chester Police just found a blood trail...

290
00:25:45,297 --> 00:25:47,290
...two miles southwest.

291
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:50,510
Match that blood against all four prisoners.

292
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:55,467
Get a fax ID on Kimble
to every local hospital.

293
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:57,634
And follow that with troopers.

294
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:02,647
What are you doing?

295
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,352
I am thinking.

296
00:26:04,352 --> 00:26:08,190
Think me up a coffee and a chocolate
doughnut with sprinkles on top...

297
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,105
...while you're thinking.

298
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:11,857
We got a live one!

299
00:26:11,857 --> 00:26:13,229
A live one?

300
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:22,157
Come on. Hang in there, brother.
We will get you out of here.

301
00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:27,870
Get that ambulance down here! Come on!

302
00:27:35,115 --> 00:27:36,740
Is this what you're looking for?

303
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:38,404
That's it.

304
00:27:38,404 --> 00:27:40,570
I am going to make some copies.

305
00:28:03,936 --> 00:28:08,265
Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
I have your breakfast for you.

306
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:11,266
We're thirsty today, aren't we?

307
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:13,769
Eat up before this gets cold.

308
00:28:18,617 --> 00:28:21,951
It really does get dry in here, doesn't it?

309
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,161
Here you are.

310
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:30,376
Now, you eat something, Mr. Johnson.

311
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,170
You need your strength.

312
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:22,554
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner
from that wreck. He might be hurt.

313
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,383
What does he look like?

314
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:27,227
Six-foot-one, 180, brown hair,
brown eyes, beard.

315
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:29,138
Seen anyone like that around?

316
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:31,471
Every time I look in the mirror, pal.

317
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:33,392
Except for the beard, of course.

318
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:34,480
Doc!

319
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:42,237
Thanks.

320
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:58,664
- I will give you a hand.
- Thanks, Doc.

321
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:00,881
It's...

322
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:03,509
How is he doing?

323
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:06,088
Good, considering we dug him out
from under a train.

324
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:10,929
Tell the attending he's got a puncture
in the upper gastric area.

325
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:13,691
How the hell could he tell that
by looking at his face?

326
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:25,202
Background just came in from Chicago.

327
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:27,695
About time. What have we got?

328
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:31,705
"Richard David Kimble, vascular surgeon."
What the hell is that?

329
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,462
Somebody that makes more money
than you.

330
00:30:34,462 --> 00:30:37,546
"Convicted of first-degree murder
in the killing of his wife.

331
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:40,632
"Pleaded innocent."
Says a one-armed man did it.

332
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:42,212
Lots of friends.

333
00:30:42,212 --> 00:30:44,711
Doctors, hospital staff.

334
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:48,388
We will start right there. I want phone-taps.
First, his lawyer.

335
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,757
You will never get that.

336
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:52,723
Call Judge Rubin.
Tell him I want a load of phone-taps.

337
00:30:52,723 --> 00:30:54,770
- Why are you yelling?
- I will call later...

338
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,015
...to tell him on who, if I am in a good mood.

339
00:30:57,015 --> 00:30:58,853
Why not yell at her sometimes?

340
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:01,563
We got a call
from Harris Community Hospital.

341
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:04,408
The wounded guard swears
he saw Kimble outside E.R.

342
00:31:04,408 --> 00:31:05,738
That's hot.

343
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,570
And an ambulance is missing.

344
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,820
Where the hell is he going
in an ambulance?

345
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:30,675
Ambulance just spotted...

346
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:35,098
...two miles west of Dover Ville,
heading north, State Highway 53.

347
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:36,767
He's running out of luck!

348
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:52,115
<i>Get your maps out.</i>

349
00:31:52,115 --> 00:31:54,959
<i>Check, sound check. Get your maps out.</i>

350
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:03,289
<i>I want to know all routes
in and out of that town.</i>

351
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,229
<i>We're headed north on Route 13,
in the direction of Barkley Dam.</i>

352
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,645
Son of a bitch!

353
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:29,652
<i>Don't lose that ambulance.</i>

354
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:46,167
<i>Visual location of an ambulance headed
north on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.</i>

355
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,336
<i>He will pass through a viaduct, right?</i>

356
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:55,847
<i>Get on the horn. Bring Biggs and Newman
in from the south side of the viaduct.</i>

357
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:57,347
<i>He's hauling ass.</i>

358
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:06,525
<i>Is there a tunnel between here and there?
We have Biggs and Newman?</i>

359
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:11,534
<i>Look on your map if you want to know
how to get there.</i>

360
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:40,016
<i>We got him!</i>

361
00:33:58,499 --> 00:33:59,993
Watch out! Watch out!

362
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:07,043
- What the hell's going on?
- Get back in your car, sir!

363
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,835
Newman! Rock and roll!

364
00:34:21,188 --> 00:34:22,848
Put a light in there!

365
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:26,937
What have you got?

366
00:34:26,937 --> 00:34:28,771
I got nothing.

367
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:32,867
- What have you got?
- You got to be kidding me!

368
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:35,073
- You got to be kidding me!
- Shit!

369
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:43,375
Seal off the tunnel! Seal it off!

370
00:35:02,563 --> 00:35:04,141
We got a gopher.

371
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:21,699
Shit! I just bought these shoes.

372
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,910
Shut up, Cosmo.

373
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:25,746
Which way, Sam?

374
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:15,436
I didn't kill my wife!

375
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:18,107
I don't care!

376
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:12,162
Put that gun down!

377
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:15,998
Put that gun down!

378
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:18,337
Now!

379
00:38:19,594 --> 00:38:20,839
Hands up!

380
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:22,542
Over your head!

381
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:24,509
Turn around!

382
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:29,093
Do you want to get shot?

383
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:36,352
Pay attention!

384
00:38:36,352 --> 00:38:38,520
Get down on your knees!

385
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,523
Right now!

386
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:06,383
What happened? Where'd he go?

387
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:09,047
He did a Peter Pan right here, off this dam!

388
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,554
Right here!

389
00:39:10,554 --> 00:39:12,555
Down! Boom!

390
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:14,723
Holy shit!

391
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:17,766
Can we go home now?

392
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:18,774
No.

393
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:22,649
Holy shit!

394
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:31,117
There's no way out of here!

395
00:39:34,836 --> 00:39:37,161
Go up the stairs! Up, up!

396
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:40,042
Poole! Get them down here now:
Helicopters, divers!

397
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:46,132
Have them turn that water off.
Come over here.

398
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:49,556
Put two patrol cars on that bridge
down there, four patrolmen.

399
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:52,429
Have them glass this river,
upstream and down.

400
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:57,431
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this river.
Make him aware of these wires.

401
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:59,684
Are you out of your mind? He's dead!

402
00:39:59,684 --> 00:40:01,770
That will make him easy to catch.

403
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,232
I want hounds on both banks
of this river for two miles...

404
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:07,650
...upstream and downstream.

405
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:11,324
You have got a search-and-rescue team
in this county?

406
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:14,826
Get them down here
and drag the bottom of this spillway.

407
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:18,957
- Why can't they turn off the water?
- Somebody from County's working on it.

408
00:40:57,043 --> 00:40:59,534
Bring in the helicopter now.

409
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:01,497
We're out of here!

410
00:41:01,497 --> 00:41:04,080
I don't think there's anything to find.

411
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,840
Find it anyway. You have got lights
and generators coming tonight.

412
00:41:33,413 --> 00:41:36,947
- I don't want to tell you your job...
- Put the helicopter on the bridge!

413
00:41:36,947 --> 00:41:40,909
...but only one in a million could survive
that fall. The guy is fish food!

414
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:43,839
Get a cane pole.
Go catch the fish that ate him.

415
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:48,212
Get Stevens. Tell him we're on the way in.

416
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:30,811
<i>That man took everything from me!</i>

417
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,238
We can't find the guy.

418
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:41,909
<i>We can't find the guy.</i>

419
00:43:44,335 --> 00:43:46,494
<i>You find that man!</i>

420
00:43:55,054 --> 00:43:56,299
<i>You find that man!</i>

421
00:44:03,438 --> 00:44:05,395
The generators and searchlights are there.

422
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:08,233
They will continue the body search
into the night.

423
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:11,360
Good. Call Kentucky
and thank them for the dogs.

424
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:15,196
Remember, opera ain't over
until the Big Dog howls.

425
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:19,221
Need a ride?

426
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:40,242
Check it again.

427
00:45:40,952 --> 00:45:44,653
All right, we got him. He shacked up
with some babe over in Whiting.

428
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:47,369
She left work tonight and took him home.

429
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:51,871
- About two hours ago, her boss said.
- They spotted her car outside her house.

430
00:45:52,297 --> 00:45:54,040
Does she run with anybody in the area?

431
00:45:54,549 --> 00:45:57,040
Nothing that we could find.
No family either.

432
00:45:57,468 --> 00:46:02,047
Tell the police not to move till we get
there. We will go first thing in the morning.

433
00:46:02,047 --> 00:46:03,883
Your cousin still got his truck?

434
00:46:03,883 --> 00:46:05,553
Call him. Tell him we need it.

435
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:28,198
Be drunk, Newman.

436
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:30,829
Stay close.

437
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:33,580
Right on your ass, buddy.

438
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:43,680
I don't want you getting lost.
You stick with me.

439
00:46:57,237 --> 00:46:59,229
U.S. marshals! Everybody down!

440
00:47:05,203 --> 00:47:07,872
Hold it right there! Show me those hands!

441
00:47:12,335 --> 00:47:13,580
Keep them up!

442
00:47:18,216 --> 00:47:20,374
Get your ass in there.

443
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:23,838
I got your man! I got your man,
you hear me?

444
00:47:25,473 --> 00:47:27,466
I want out of here!

445
00:47:27,466 --> 00:47:29,350
I got your man!

446
00:47:32,355 --> 00:47:36,353
I am going to blow his brains out!
I want out of here!

447
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:38,813
Do you hear me?

448
00:47:39,237 --> 00:47:40,861
Do you hear me?

449
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,566
I want out of here!

450
00:47:43,908 --> 00:47:46,909
- Listen! We can work this out!
- Yes, we can.

451
00:47:47,412 --> 00:47:50,164
Shut up! Shut up!

452
00:47:50,665 --> 00:47:52,076
Do you hear me?

453
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:55,587
Listen, and I will tell you what I want.

454
00:47:55,587 --> 00:47:57,663
I just want a car out front.

455
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:02,423
Don't shoot.

456
00:48:02,423 --> 00:48:04,586
It's over.

457
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:27,989
Shut up!

458
00:49:02,654 --> 00:49:05,323
I can't hear anything. My ear is...

459
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:10,116
I can't believe you did that.

460
00:49:11,496 --> 00:49:14,201
You think I should have bargained
with that guy.

461
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,781
Yeah.

462
00:49:17,752 --> 00:49:18,783
I do.

463
00:49:19,587 --> 00:49:21,165
You could have missed.

464
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:24,082
You could have killed me.

465
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:28,089
How bad is that ear?

466
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:31,213
Bad. I will have permanent hearing damage.

467
00:49:31,213 --> 00:49:32,588
Let me see it.

468
00:49:32,976 --> 00:49:34,090
Come here.

469
00:49:35,103 --> 00:49:37,261
Can you hear what I am saying now?

470
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:38,470
Yeah.

471
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:42,018
I don't...

472
00:49:42,018 --> 00:49:43,314
...bargain.

473
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:46,775
You hear that?

474
00:49:47,866 --> 00:49:48,861
Yeah.

475
00:49:50,535 --> 00:49:51,531
Okay.

476
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:36,072
Walter, this is Richard.

477
00:50:36,072 --> 00:50:40,328
<i>Richard, Jesus! Why did you run?
Running only makes you look guilty.</i>

478
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:43,326
I wasn't worried about appearances,
Walter.

479
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:46,837
<i>Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.</i>

480
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:49,416
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

481
00:50:50,762 --> 00:50:54,890
You're asking me to harbor and aid
a convicted felon. I can't do that.

482
00:50:55,183 --> 00:50:59,263
<i>My advice both as your friend
and legal counselor is to give yourself up.</i>

483
00:50:59,263 --> 00:51:01,596
<i>Now tell me, where are you?</i>

484
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,601
St. Louis.

485
00:51:03,858 --> 00:51:06,895
<i>Give me an address.
I will get there as soon as I can.</i>

486
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,199
Mr. Copeland was a bad man.
He was going to kill one of my kids.

487
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:20,705
Well, sir, you can blame me.
I am the one that shot him.

488
00:51:29,718 --> 00:51:33,466
<i>...give yourself up.
Now tell me, where are you?</i>

489
00:51:34,222 --> 00:51:35,385
<i>St. Louis.</i>

490
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:38,308
So he showed up not dead.
Let that be a lesson to you.

491
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:41,845
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog.
Big Dog is always right.

492
00:51:42,314 --> 00:51:44,472
Yeah, you have been right before.

493
00:51:46,901 --> 00:51:48,016
<i>Walter, this is Richard.</i>

494
00:51:48,016 --> 00:51:52,025
<i>Richard, Jesus! Why did you run?
Running only makes you look guilty.</i>

495
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:55,233
<i>I wasn't worried about appearances,
Walter.</i>

496
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:58,993
<i>Tell me where you are,
so I can meet you and you can surrender.</i>

497
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:01,488
<i>I won't surrender. I need help, money.</i>

498
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:04,336
I might be crazy,
but that train sounds like an el.

499
00:52:04,336 --> 00:52:06,458
St. Louis doesn't have an elevated train.

500
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,704
How do you know it's an elevated train?

501
00:52:08,704 --> 00:52:10,957
I lived under an el for 20 years.

502
00:52:10,957 --> 00:52:15,754
You can explain the difference in the sound of 
an elevated train and a train on the ground.

503
00:52:15,754 --> 00:52:17,175
You have got ears of an eagle.

504
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:20,866
Play that back. I want to hear 
the sound of an elevated train.

505
00:52:21,102 --> 00:52:23,593
What cities have el's?
New York has got an el.

506
00:52:23,593 --> 00:52:25,017
- Philly.
- We do.

507
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,352
Milwaukee has got an el.

508
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:29,442
Stop! Where the lawyer says
he sounds guilty. There's bells.

509
00:52:29,442 --> 00:52:33,311
There's a guy on a PA.
Can you drop everything but him?

510
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:35,407
I will try. Hold on.

511
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:40,871
Right there.

512
00:52:41,706 --> 00:52:43,117
What's he saying?

513
00:52:43,117 --> 00:52:46,374
Sounds like "Next stop." Do that again!

514
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:51,375
"Next stop"...

515
00:52:52,133 --> 00:52:53,628
"Merchandise Mart."

516
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,044
Son of a bitch! Our boy came home.

517
00:52:56,471 --> 00:52:59,757
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge,
it's six blocks away.

518
00:53:00,892 --> 00:53:02,470
I knew that was an elevated train.

519
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,886
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.

520
00:53:05,146 --> 00:53:08,147
- I will call the C.P.D.
- This is your Chicago file.

521
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:09,727
<i>Andiamo, bambini.</i>

522
00:53:09,727 --> 00:53:12,487
Sammy, when I die,
I want to come back just like you.

523
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:14,029
Happy and handsome?

524
00:53:14,823 --> 00:53:16,650
- I will notify the press.
- No press.

525
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,117
Right, no press.

526
00:53:36,845 --> 00:53:38,921
- Hi, Billy.
- How's it going, sir?

527
00:53:38,921 --> 00:53:40,805
- Good, and you?
- All right.

528
00:53:44,477 --> 00:53:47,051
- Here you go, Billy.
- Have a good one, sir.

529
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:02,777
Spare change? Dollar, mister?

530
00:54:03,288 --> 00:54:06,123
No, thank you very much. I don't want it.

531
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:11,285
Oh, my God. Richard!

532
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:13,416
How are you, Charlie?

533
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,001
Jesus, you're back.

534
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,414
I need some money.

535
00:54:16,414 --> 00:54:18,004
Sure, sure. Get in.

536
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,709
No, I can't. Just whatever you got on you.

537
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:23,213
You're hot, pal. If not now, you will be.

538
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:26,594
Have you got a place to stay?
I mean, how can I help you?

539
00:54:27,854 --> 00:54:30,013
<i>You have got a green light. Move on!</i>

540
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:31,935
I will call you.

541
00:54:42,535 --> 00:54:44,991
<i>So why did Richard Kimble kill his wife?</i>

542
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,574
He did it for the money.

543
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,452
What do you mean? He's a doctor.
He's already rich.

544
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,953
She was more rich.

545
00:54:52,003 --> 00:54:54,921
Is this the entire
Chicago Police Department file?

546
00:54:54,921 --> 00:54:58,292
- That's everything.
- I want to do all these interviews again.

547
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:01,754
- The list of hospital staff, is it in the file?
- Sure is.

548
00:55:01,754 --> 00:55:02,926
Thank you.

549
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:04,758
You don't want to use the media?

550
00:55:04,758 --> 00:55:09,511
We want him to relax. Make himself
comfortable. Try to re-enter his life.

551
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:15,855
Here's the apartment.

552
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:19,194
You can see here is heater.
You will have warm.

553
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:21,689
Here is kitchen. Sink.

554
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:24,702
Over there is bathroom.
And here is the room.

555
00:55:24,911 --> 00:55:26,405
Is nice bed.

556
00:55:26,405 --> 00:55:28,038
Plenty space.

557
00:55:28,038 --> 00:55:29,582
You can look at.

558
00:55:53,106 --> 00:55:54,897
So you like the place?

559
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:56,692
It's okay with you?

560
00:55:57,402 --> 00:55:58,600
It's perfect.

561
00:55:59,404 --> 00:56:00,898
<i>All right, people.</i>

562
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:05,070
<i>As of this morning, we were notified
by the U.S. Marshal's Office...</i>

563
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:09,905
<i>...that our old friend Dr. Richard Kimble
is alive and well and back here in Chicago.</i>

564
00:56:10,415 --> 00:56:13,535
<i>You all know in what high regard
we hold this scumbag.</i>

565
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:17,337
<i>So I am personally donating
a bottle of 12-year-old Scotch...</i>

566
00:56:17,337 --> 00:56:20,043
<i>...to whoever puts the collar on this quack.</i>

567
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,589
<i>Rosetti is passing out bulletins.</i>

568
00:57:12,769 --> 00:57:14,928
Gunshot wound to the left shoulder.

569
00:57:44,342 --> 00:57:45,920
Help you?

570
00:57:46,428 --> 00:57:47,542
<i>Gracias.</i>

571
00:59:18,645 --> 00:59:20,519
You went to medical school together?

572
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:22,016
Yes, we did.

573
00:59:22,649 --> 00:59:24,440
The class of '73.

574
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:26,892
You know Morton Feinberg?

575
00:59:26,892 --> 00:59:28,896
- I do.
- He's a real nice guy.

576
00:59:29,823 --> 00:59:31,068
When did you see him last?

577
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,486
Who, Richard?

578
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:37,027
I saw Richard this morning.

579
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,450
You saw him this morning?

580
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,079
He stopped me in my car.
I gave him some money.

581
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:44,951
Where was this?

582
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,623
Outside my tennis club.

583
00:59:47,623 --> 00:59:49,044
Did he ask you for help?

584
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:52,170
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.

585
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,089
How much money did you give him?

586
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:56,597
Couple of bucks. Just what I had on me.

587
00:59:56,597 --> 01:00:00,017
- He won't get far on that.
- Why'd he come back to Chicago?

588
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:01,597
He didn't tell me that, sir.

589
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:05,982
I am sure he's trying to protect you
from having to lie for him, but...

590
01:00:09,821 --> 01:00:12,656
You really want to help him, be his friend?

591
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:14,983
Help us bring him in unharmed.

592
01:00:15,577 --> 01:00:16,692
Why?

593
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:19,321
So he can go back to prison?

594
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:25,501
If you want help, gentlemen,
you have come to the wrong man.

595
01:00:25,837 --> 01:00:27,996
Richard is innocent.

596
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,009
You will never find him. He's too smart.

597
01:00:31,009 --> 01:00:33,501
We're some smart guys.

598
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:38,222
What about us? We're smart. We are.
How smart could he be, really?

599
01:00:39,017 --> 01:00:40,809
Is he as smart as you are?

600
01:00:42,229 --> 01:00:43,604
Smarter.

601
01:01:02,249 --> 01:01:06,329
Peripheral vascular surgery. Fixing
the arteries as they come out of the heart.

602
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:10,168
- How long have you known Kimble?
- Ten years. Since I have been here.

603
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,629
What kind of medicine did he practice
here at the hospital?

604
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:41,034
I want you to know
that I believe Kimble to be innocent.

605
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,288
Would he come to you for help?

606
01:01:43,288 --> 01:01:45,366
If he came to me, I would help.

607
01:01:46,043 --> 01:01:47,620
But he wouldn't come to me.

608
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,253
That's not his style.

609
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:10,731
<i>A warrant remains outstanding
for Chicago surgeon, Richard Kimble.</i>

610
01:02:25,082 --> 01:02:29,494
This is where the one-armed guy struggled,
fell down the stairs.

611
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,709
If I fell down these stairs, I'd be a goner.
I'd be dead.

612
01:02:47,271 --> 01:02:48,765
What a waste!

613
01:02:57,614 --> 01:03:00,284
<i>When I came home,
there was a man in my house.</i>

614
01:03:25,893 --> 01:03:26,924
Richard.

615
01:04:20,697 --> 01:04:23,105
You like stringing out
12-year-old girls, huh?

616
01:04:23,105 --> 01:04:24,943
What are you doing to my baby?

617
01:04:24,943 --> 01:04:27,111
Your baby's a drug dealer, lady.

618
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:28,829
Come on, ma'am.

619
01:04:29,373 --> 01:04:31,946
What they doing to my baby?

620
01:04:58,777 --> 01:05:02,111
It will be crazy here tonight.
Did they get a count?

621
01:05:02,111 --> 01:05:03,941
There were a lot of kids.

622
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,108
They bring them all here?

623
01:05:06,108 --> 01:05:08,277
They're all coming down here to County.

624
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,720
I have come to do those blinds.

625
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,391
I will get the door.

626
01:05:46,992 --> 01:05:49,400
- I will start in here, huh?
- Okay.

627
01:07:18,584 --> 01:07:20,825
Let's go over it once more.

628
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:23,161
What time did he arrive at the house?

629
01:07:23,161 --> 01:07:25,331
About 10:30 in the morning.

630
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:29,415
- And he was alone?
- Yeah, he was alone.

631
01:07:29,415 --> 01:07:32,596
- You got a good look at him?
- Yeah, a real good look.

632
01:07:34,141 --> 01:07:35,600
Be straight with me, kid.

633
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,768
This is the guy staying
in your mother's basement?

634
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,930
That's what I am telling you.

635
01:07:55,996 --> 01:07:57,075
Is she stable?

636
01:07:59,124 --> 01:08:00,832
Breathe. Just stay calm.

637
01:08:00,832 --> 01:08:02,495
I need a doctor over here!

638
01:08:08,175 --> 01:08:10,168
Watch the bag! Watch the bag!

639
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:31,813
Hello, Marshal. It's right there.

640
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,931
My chest hurts.

641
01:09:07,067 --> 01:09:09,143
Check the film on that kid.

642
01:09:12,031 --> 01:09:13,525
Take a deep breath.

643
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,024
Inhale, exhale. Again.

644
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:17,447
Slowly.

645
01:09:19,204 --> 01:09:20,782
Check the film.

646
01:09:22,374 --> 01:09:23,619
Take it easy.

647
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:29,457
What's the status on that kid?

648
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,042
Possible fractured sternum.

649
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,924
Get over here. I need you.

650
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:37,051
Can you help us?
Bring this kid to Observation Room 2.

651
01:09:38,182 --> 01:09:40,673
Yeah, you. Come on, help us out, okay?

652
01:09:49,443 --> 01:09:50,902
How are you, champ?

653
01:09:50,902 --> 01:09:52,398
My chest hurts.

654
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,232
Does it hurt when you breathe?

655
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,320
Yes.

656
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:03,155
- What's your name?
- Joel.

657
01:10:08,921 --> 01:10:10,249
Look at this.

658
01:10:10,589 --> 01:10:13,341
We're eating oranges
and we're making IDs.

659
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:15,548
"C.C.H." What the hell is that?

660
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,920
Cook County Hospital.

661
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:23,259
Just hang on, okay?

662
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,763
You will be okay, pal.

663
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,052
You will be just fine.

664
01:10:27,052 --> 01:10:28,855
Hold that elevator.

665
01:10:29,608 --> 01:10:30,687
Thank you.

666
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,108
How are you doing?

667
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:37,858
My chest hurts.

668
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:40,111
Where's your mom, pal?

669
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,365
I don't know.

670
01:10:41,365 --> 01:10:43,363
Is she at home?

671
01:10:43,363 --> 01:10:45,531
I think she's with my brother.

672
01:10:45,531 --> 01:10:47,368
Your brother? They're downstairs?

673
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,870
I don't know.

674
01:10:49,295 --> 01:10:50,872
Don't worry.

675
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:52,706
We will find her for you.

676
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,467
What are you?
A football player? Baseball player?

677
01:10:56,467 --> 01:10:57,880
Football.

678
01:10:59,638 --> 01:11:00,967
Hold on, son.

679
01:11:12,818 --> 01:11:14,063
Hey, Doctor.

680
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,311
They sent this one from downstairs.

681
01:11:23,495 --> 01:11:26,615
Get this one into Room 4, stat.

682
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:28,953
Bye-bye, Joel.

683
01:11:42,514 --> 01:11:44,388
Where's the boy I sent with the janitor?

684
01:11:44,388 --> 01:11:46,551
- What boy?
- With the fractured sternum.

685
01:11:46,551 --> 01:11:48,221
He never came through here.

686
01:11:49,521 --> 01:11:50,601
He didn't?

687
01:11:50,601 --> 01:11:51,934
No, he didn't.

688
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:58,778
Do you have a particular interest
in our patients' X-rays?

689
01:11:58,778 --> 01:12:02,447
- What do you mean?
- I saw you looking at that boy's chest film.

690
01:12:04,203 --> 01:12:06,610
- It's a hobby of mine.
- It's a hobby, really?

691
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:09,113
What are your other hobbies,
brain surgery?

692
01:12:09,113 --> 01:12:11,995
- What do you want?
- To know how the boy got to surgery.

693
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:14,043
I am a janitor. I do what I am told.

694
01:12:14,043 --> 01:12:15,292
That's bullshit!

695
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:17,089
Who changed those orders?

696
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:19,758
I don't know what you mean.

697
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,722
You stay right there.

698
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:28,303
Call Security!

699
01:12:56,005 --> 01:13:00,417
Tell Stevens to get hold of that guy Kelly
over at C.P.D.

700
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:06,839
A guy disguised as a janitor orders
an emergency medical procedure...

701
01:13:06,839 --> 01:13:09,767
...and all you did was
take away his ID card?

702
01:13:10,769 --> 01:13:14,684
No, I called Security. He took off down
the hall. What was I supposed to do?

703
01:13:14,684 --> 01:13:16,184
Listen, Mr...

704
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:17,521
Deputy.

705
01:13:17,776 --> 01:13:19,021
Gerard.

706
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:22,023
I am really tired.

707
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:23,774
I'd like to go home now.

708
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,192
Okay. How's the boy doing?

709
01:13:26,593 --> 01:13:27,659
He saved his life.

710
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:33,870
Thank you.

711
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:41,204
"Desmondo Jos Ruiz."

712
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:47,597
Where are you at, Desmondo?

713
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,800
All right, Sam, this is my problem.

714
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:55,146
The place is crawling with cops, right?

715
01:13:55,146 --> 01:13:57,639
Everybody's looking for
Richard Kimble, right?

716
01:13:57,639 --> 01:13:59,726
So why would a guy be stupid enough...

717
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:02,226
...to be in the trauma ward
and play Mother Teresa?

718
01:14:02,226 --> 01:14:03,484
Excuse me.

719
01:14:22,341 --> 01:14:24,298
- You guys have a problem?
- No.

720
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,085
No. No problem at all.

721
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:36,229
Excuse me,
could we have a word with you, please?

722
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:42,439
This is Dr. Elway at Cook County Hospital.

723
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:47,154
I am doing follow-up work
for the prosthetic clinic on Matthew Zelick.

724
01:14:50,161 --> 01:14:51,489
Oh, he did?

725
01:14:51,489 --> 01:14:53,156
I am terribly sorry.

726
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:58,458
Right or left?

727
01:14:58,669 --> 01:14:59,832
Right.

728
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,919
- Age?
- Thirty-five to forty-five.

729
01:15:04,508 --> 01:15:08,173
This is Ted Riley with the High School
Reunion Committee.

730
01:15:08,173 --> 01:15:11,015
Twenty-five years are right
around the corner...

731
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:14,642
...and Clive is on our list
of "Missing in Action."

732
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:18,429
Information gave me a number,
but when I tried it--

733
01:15:22,276 --> 01:15:23,604
No kidding.

734
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:25,862
Armed robbery?

735
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:28,986
He's where?

736
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,279
Point of attachment?

737
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:31,447
Mid-humerus.

738
01:15:31,447 --> 01:15:33,860
That gives us 47 possibles.

739
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:35,034
Forty-seven?

740
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:38,536
Cross-check these people
for criminal records.

741
01:15:38,536 --> 01:15:39,663
Wait a minute.

742
01:15:50,721 --> 01:15:53,046
<i>Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.</i>

743
01:16:39,103 --> 01:16:40,514
Driscoll, Clive R.

744
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:44,230
One-armed man, armed robbery.
That's funny.

745
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:46,480
Let me ask a question:

746
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:53,530
If they can dye this river green today...

747
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:56,287
...why can't they dye it blue
the other 364 days?

748
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,157
Do I know?

749
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:03,127
- So, what are you Irish, sir?
- Who, me? No.

750
01:17:03,461 --> 01:17:04,623
Are you?

751
01:17:04,962 --> 01:17:06,125
No, man!

752
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,921
Name of inmate?

753
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:19,595
Clive Driscoll.

754
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,311
Driscoll, Clive.

755
01:17:21,645 --> 01:17:23,056
ID, please.

756
01:17:23,314 --> 01:17:25,141
Driscoll, Clive R.

757
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,810
2-0-1-0.

758
01:17:27,068 --> 01:17:31,445
Be advised that under federal court ruling,
your conversation can be recorded.

759
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:32,854
Sign here, please.

760
01:17:32,854 --> 01:17:37,575
This is hinky. He is a college graduate.
He wouldn't go through all this security...

761
01:17:37,575 --> 01:17:41,991
...go to the county lock-up to find someone
his own people say doesn't exist.

762
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:43,115
Hinky.

763
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:44,751
What does that mean, "hinky"?

764
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:46,033
- Strange.
- Weird.

765
01:17:46,033 --> 01:17:48,702
Say "strange" or "weird."
"Hinky" has no meaning.

766
01:17:48,702 --> 01:17:50,292
We say "hinky."

767
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:56,298
I don't want you using meaningless words
around me. I am taking the stairs.

768
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,305
How about "bullshit"?

769
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,687
Visitor for Driscoll.

770
01:18:05,356 --> 01:18:07,348
Come on, let's go.

771
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:12,362
Over there.

772
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:36,970
Let's go, Driscoll.

773
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:45,012
You have got five minutes.

774
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:47,272
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

775
01:18:47,732 --> 01:18:50,223
<i>Look, I am sorry. I made a mistake.</i>

776
01:18:50,223 --> 01:18:52,109
<i>You got me down here...</i>

777
01:18:52,109 --> 01:18:53,772
<i>...might as well talk.</i>

778
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:57,196
<i>There ain't no entertainment.
Ain't no cable in this damn place.</i>

779
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:02,036
<i>Listen, pal, I wish I could, but I can't.
Sorry.</i>

780
01:19:52,296 --> 01:19:53,292
Richard!

781
01:20:57,903 --> 01:21:01,735
There is a man in a blue coat
waving a gun and screaming at a woman.

782
01:21:01,735 --> 01:21:03,069
Stop that man!

783
01:21:03,069 --> 01:21:04,783
He's a U.S. marshal! Let him go!

784
01:21:04,783 --> 01:21:06,328
Let him go!

785
01:21:08,706 --> 01:21:10,081
Close the gates!

786
01:21:25,097 --> 01:21:26,129
Hold it!

787
01:21:44,742 --> 01:21:46,022
Open the door!

788
01:21:55,169 --> 01:21:56,580
We're on the roof.

789
01:21:58,422 --> 01:22:01,092
Take some men! Look down there!

790
01:22:01,842 --> 01:22:03,337
Jesus, he's in the plaza, Sam!

791
01:22:03,337 --> 01:22:04,922
He's heading east!

792
01:22:07,181 --> 01:22:09,850
<i>He's going east toward the Picasso!</i>

793
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,632
<i>Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.</i>

794
01:23:54,288 --> 01:23:59,116
Deputy Gerard, why do you feel
that Dr. Kimble came back to Chicago?

795
01:23:59,627 --> 01:24:00,955
I have no idea.

796
01:24:00,955 --> 01:24:03,964
We understand your deputies
were at County Hospital today.

797
01:24:03,964 --> 01:24:05,957
Was Dr. Kimble at County Hospital?

798
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:08,208
I don't have any comment on that one.

799
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:10,378
Let me get the chronology straight.

800
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:13,306
The suspect was tried,
convicted, incarcerated...

801
01:24:13,558 --> 01:24:18,220
...escaped, presumed dead, and is now
at large in Chicago. Is that correct, sir?

802
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,554
Except for being presumed dead.

803
01:24:20,554 --> 01:24:23,732
Do you believe
that Kimble's armed and dangerous?

804
01:24:23,985 --> 01:24:25,942
I believe he's dangerous, yes.

805
01:24:25,942 --> 01:24:30,317
He's taking chances, coming back.
Do you feel perhaps he might be innocent?

806
01:24:30,317 --> 01:24:34,821
No, he's not innocent. He was convicted
in a court of law. He's guilty.

807
01:24:34,821 --> 01:24:37,154
What are you going to do next
to catch him?

808
01:24:37,154 --> 01:24:39,739
We have no further comments for now.

809
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:28,016
Alec, Richard Kimble.

810
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:31,268
- How are you?
- Dr. Kimble.

811
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:33,729
Lentz!

812
01:28:34,485 --> 01:28:37,901
<i>Sorry, we have been trading phone calls
the last few days.</i>

813
01:28:58,676 --> 01:29:01,167
A cruise sponsored by Devlin MacGregor...

814
01:29:01,763 --> 01:29:03,340
- ...that could be fun.
- Hi.

815
01:29:09,354 --> 01:29:11,595
<i>- Cancn, Richard.
- Sport fishing.</i>

816
01:29:11,595 --> 01:29:13,101
Pia coladas.

817
01:29:13,101 --> 01:29:15,516
What must the hospital buy?
What's the catch?

818
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:16,689
Sailfish.

819
01:29:17,278 --> 01:29:19,401
No, there are no strings attached.

820
01:29:19,864 --> 01:29:22,533
<i>So, what do you say?</i>

821
01:29:25,286 --> 01:29:28,655
This guy is bleeding
from every needle puncture.

822
01:29:29,374 --> 01:29:32,161
Lentz sent this guy in?
Is he on that wonder drug?

823
01:29:32,161 --> 01:29:35,039
Yes, he's on the RDU-90 protocol, Provasic.

824
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:36,540
Drug of the future, boys.

825
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,715
Clean out those arteries
and put us out of business.

826
01:29:46,015 --> 01:29:48,589
"Parade Master of Ceremonies,
Ed O'Flaherty, said...

827
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:52,642
"...he didn't recall a livelier parade
during the last 20 years.

828
01:29:52,642 --> 01:29:54,142
"That Kimble," listen...

829
01:29:54,142 --> 01:29:57,149
"...is some kind of lad to be running out--"

830
01:29:57,149 --> 01:29:58,563
- "Lad"?
- Yeah, "lad."

831
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:03,815
Maybe he's a leprechaun.
I am quoting this guy.

832
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:06,482
Some guy on line three
claims he's Richard Kimble.

833
01:30:06,482 --> 01:30:09,247
- Who is it?
- We got another Kimble on line three.

834
01:30:09,247 --> 01:30:12,248
- Let me see that phone.
- Tell him he looks good in a beard.

835
01:30:12,542 --> 01:30:13,953
- What line?
- Three.

836
01:30:13,953 --> 01:30:16,369
Ask him if he enjoyed the parade.

837
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,423
This is Gerard.

838
01:30:20,633 --> 01:30:23,338
Do you remember what I told you
in the tunnel?

839
01:30:25,138 --> 01:30:26,632
It's him!

840
01:30:26,632 --> 01:30:28,964
I remember it was noisy.

841
01:30:29,225 --> 01:30:31,716
Well, I think you said something like...

842
01:30:31,716 --> 01:30:33,436
...you didn't kill your wife.

843
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:35,272
Remember what you told me?

844
01:30:36,065 --> 01:30:38,603
I remember you were pointing
my gun at me.

845
01:30:42,155 --> 01:30:44,728
You said, "I don't care."

846
01:30:44,991 --> 01:30:46,699
He's on the South Side.

847
01:30:47,327 --> 01:30:50,328
Yeah, Richard, that's right, I don't care.

848
01:30:50,328 --> 01:30:52,406
I am not trying to solve a puzzle, here.

849
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:54,372
Well, I am trying to solve a puzzle.

850
01:30:54,667 --> 01:30:56,078
Five seconds to location.

851
01:30:56,377 --> 01:30:58,619
And I just found a big piece.

852
01:31:07,931 --> 01:31:09,176
<i>Hello, Richard?</i>

853
01:31:09,176 --> 01:31:11,174
He didn't hang up the phone.

854
01:31:11,935 --> 01:31:13,097
Where is he?

855
01:31:13,097 --> 01:31:14,514
256 South, St. Lawrence.

856
01:31:14,514 --> 01:31:16,929
Get the C.P.D. right the hell over there.

857
01:31:16,929 --> 01:31:19,431
We got a car there now.

858
01:31:48,972 --> 01:31:51,048
Get a couple of shots of that.

859
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:55,721
Fredrick Sykes...

860
01:31:56,563 --> 01:32:00,763
...45, ex-cop, and quite a clotheshorse.

861
01:32:01,401 --> 01:32:03,109
You want to look at this?

862
01:32:05,113 --> 01:32:07,401
Kimble's prints.
They're all over the room...

863
01:32:07,401 --> 01:32:09,364
...mainly on the desk.

864
01:32:09,364 --> 01:32:12,736
He was very interested
in these photographs. Especially these.

865
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,074
Negatives in there?

866
01:32:14,074 --> 01:32:15,574
Let me have those things.

867
01:32:15,574 --> 01:32:18,334
<i>- Camera boy's on his way.
- We got you.</i>

868
01:32:35,351 --> 01:32:36,976
How are you doing, Mr. Sykes?

869
01:32:36,976 --> 01:32:40,312
- Fine, if you tell me what's happening.
- We had a problem.

870
01:32:40,312 --> 01:32:43,352
- My place or the place upstairs?
- Your place.

871
01:32:44,402 --> 01:32:46,145
Step right in, Mr. Sykes.

872
01:32:46,145 --> 01:32:49,238
Everybody knows my name here.
Big happy family, huh?

873
01:32:49,866 --> 01:32:53,282
What is this, a trench coat convention?
What the hell is going on?

874
01:32:53,282 --> 01:32:55,907
Who are you guys? What's going on?

875
01:32:59,751 --> 01:33:01,909
You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes.

876
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:04,211
I sure hope you're a cop.

877
01:33:04,589 --> 01:33:07,709
I am Samuel Gerard, U.S. Marshal's Office.

878
01:33:08,593 --> 01:33:13,255
This morning, a fugitive named Richard
Kimble made a phone call from here.

879
01:33:13,765 --> 01:33:15,307
Why would he do that?

880
01:33:15,767 --> 01:33:17,925
I don't know any Richard Kimble.

881
01:33:24,067 --> 01:33:25,894
Okay, I got it.

882
01:33:26,236 --> 01:33:28,608
The doctor who killed his wife, right?

883
01:33:28,947 --> 01:33:32,944
Kept blaming somebody
with a prosthetic limb. Is he after me?

884
01:33:32,944 --> 01:33:34,991
Does he have a reason to do so?

885
01:33:34,991 --> 01:33:37,783
I have a prosthetic arm!
I must have murdered his wife!

886
01:33:38,623 --> 01:33:41,743
Give me a break.
I went through all this a year ago.

887
01:33:41,743 --> 01:33:44,623
They came here and questioned me
about the whole thing.

888
01:33:44,623 --> 01:33:49,090
I will tell you what I said. I wasn't in Chicago
that night. I was on a business trip.

889
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:50,883
Fifteen people verified it.

890
01:33:50,883 --> 01:33:53,092
What line of business are you in?

891
01:33:53,471 --> 01:33:54,550
Security.

892
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:57,177
- Who do you work for?
- A pharmaceutical company.

893
01:33:57,177 --> 01:33:58,180
Which one?

894
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:01,850
Devlin MacGregor.
I handle security for all the top executives.

895
01:34:03,773 --> 01:34:07,853
Do you have any idea why Kimble
would be interested in these photographs?

896
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:09,935
No.

897
01:34:10,655 --> 01:34:12,778
Where were they taken?

898
01:34:12,778 --> 01:34:14,527
Gee, that's a big fish!

899
01:34:14,527 --> 01:34:15,946
Cancn, Mexico.

900
01:34:15,946 --> 01:34:18,989
It was a junket the company paid for,
for some doctors.

901
01:34:18,989 --> 01:34:22,283
- Kimble go with you?
- You don't see him there, do you?

902
01:34:24,794 --> 01:34:27,464
No. I told you I don't know him.

903
01:34:27,839 --> 01:34:30,875
Do you mind if I look around
to see if anything's missing?

904
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:32,378
No, I don't mind.

905
01:34:38,308 --> 01:34:40,016
How did you lose that arm?

906
01:34:40,016 --> 01:34:41,845
In the line of duty.

907
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:54,153
Cosmo, this guy's dirty.

908
01:34:54,491 --> 01:34:56,317
Yes, he is.

909
01:34:56,534 --> 01:34:59,701
- You want our people on him?
- Yes. Build a camp here.

910
01:35:00,038 --> 01:35:01,580
I will take care of it.

911
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:06,834
See this picture? I want you to find out
who the guy is next to Sykes.

912
01:35:07,212 --> 01:35:10,746
Find out his name, his age, his weight,
his Social Security number...

913
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:14,589
...his location, relatives, pets, everything.

914
01:35:34,572 --> 01:35:37,657
I am so sorry, Doctor,
they said it was an emergency.

915
01:35:40,578 --> 01:35:41,492
Excuse me.

916
01:35:53,133 --> 01:35:55,671
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Bolton?</i>

917
01:35:56,052 --> 01:35:57,048
Chuck.

918
01:35:57,048 --> 01:35:58,251
<i>Richard.</i>

919
01:35:58,251 --> 01:35:59,675
Yeah, can you talk?

920
01:35:59,675 --> 01:36:03,762
Yes, I am on a hotel phone.
So, how are you? What's going on?

921
01:36:04,602 --> 01:36:07,769
I found him, Chuck.
I found the man who killed Helen.

922
01:36:08,356 --> 01:36:10,847
- What?
- It was me they were after.

923
01:36:11,568 --> 01:36:12,766
Who are they?

924
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:16,740
Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.

925
01:36:17,282 --> 01:36:20,283
Lentz was supervising
the protocol for RDU-90.

926
01:36:20,283 --> 01:36:23,618
He knew I found out it was causing
liver damage. It was Lentz.

927
01:36:25,623 --> 01:36:28,328
Richard, Lentz is dead.

928
01:36:29,127 --> 01:36:30,742
- What? 
- How?

929
01:36:31,296 --> 01:36:34,083
<i>He died in a car accident last summer.</i>

930
01:36:38,928 --> 01:36:41,051
Can you prove this about the drug?

931
01:36:41,765 --> 01:36:43,175
Yeah, I think so.

932
01:36:44,434 --> 01:36:46,142
I need your help, Chuck.

933
01:36:46,436 --> 01:36:49,971
Call Bones at the hospital.
Tell him to give me whatever help I need.

934
01:36:51,316 --> 01:36:52,561
I will call him right away.

935
01:36:52,561 --> 01:36:54,145
Okay. Thanks.

936
01:37:04,162 --> 01:37:05,490
Dr. Nichols!

937
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:08,321
Can we ask you a few more questions?

938
01:37:08,321 --> 01:37:09,994
Mr. Gerard.

939
01:37:09,994 --> 01:37:12,659
You got a copy of that photograph?

940
01:37:13,004 --> 01:37:14,415
U.S. Marshal Service.

941
01:37:14,415 --> 01:37:15,834
Excuse us.

942
01:37:18,968 --> 01:37:20,628
This is Fredrick Sykes.

943
01:37:20,628 --> 01:37:24,801
He's a security specialist
at Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

944
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:27,382
Richard Kimble broke into his apartment.

945
01:37:27,382 --> 01:37:28,936
Do you know this man?

946
01:37:28,936 --> 01:37:30,562
I don't know him.

947
01:37:32,148 --> 01:37:35,268
You're getting pretty desperate,
aren't you, Mr. Gerard?

948
01:37:35,268 --> 01:37:36,819
Oh, yeah.

949
01:37:37,487 --> 01:37:39,563
I told you, you wouldn't find Richard.

950
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:41,981
- Has he been to see you?
- No.

951
01:37:43,702 --> 01:37:46,656
We have been over this ground before,
haven't we?

952
01:37:49,165 --> 01:37:51,241
So, if you will excuse me.

953
01:37:52,419 --> 01:37:53,450
Sure.

954
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:55,584
Thanks, Doc.

955
01:37:57,507 --> 01:38:00,923
Sorry, I want to ask you
one more question about the photograph.

956
01:38:00,923 --> 01:38:03,965
See the guy standing
on the right side of the fish?

957
01:38:03,965 --> 01:38:05,799
- Ever see him before?
- No.

958
01:38:05,799 --> 01:38:07,682
This guy right here?

959
01:38:08,226 --> 01:38:10,895
I have never seen that person
in my life before.

960
01:38:11,563 --> 01:38:12,938
I am sorry.

961
01:38:12,938 --> 01:38:14,185
Thank you.

962
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:17,898
Thank you, Doctor.
Enjoy the rest of the convention.

963
01:38:22,699 --> 01:38:27,575
"Alternatives to Cardio-Non-Invasive
Arterial Plaque-Reducing Therapy.

964
01:38:27,575 --> 01:38:30,071
"Keynote speaker, Charles Nichols."

965
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:32,371
Bet you they line up to hear this one.

966
01:38:48,558 --> 01:38:50,930
If you were Richard Kimble...

967
01:38:51,269 --> 01:38:55,018
...why would you hunt for a one-armed
man you say killed your wife...

968
01:38:55,018 --> 01:38:58,392
...break into his house,
call us up and then split?

969
01:38:58,392 --> 01:39:00,976
- Doesn't make sense.
- I should have been a doctor.

970
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:05,359
Look at this blow-up. This guy
in the picture with Sykes. On his shirt.

971
01:39:05,659 --> 01:39:06,821
"Chicago Memorial."

972
01:39:06,821 --> 01:39:09,365
- Kimble's hospital. I want to go.
- Go!

973
01:39:09,704 --> 01:39:10,867
Wait.

974
01:39:14,125 --> 01:39:15,785
Devlin MacGregor...

975
01:39:16,044 --> 01:39:19,709
...did 7.5 billion dollars net sales...

976
01:39:20,715 --> 01:39:22,459
...last year alone.

977
01:39:24,219 --> 01:39:26,211
That company is a monster.

978
01:39:34,729 --> 01:39:36,140
Yeah, talk to me.

979
01:39:40,485 --> 01:39:41,896
Absolutely.

980
01:39:43,071 --> 01:39:44,565
It's a liver sample...

981
01:39:44,565 --> 01:39:47,491
...from a patient on the RDU-90 drug study.

982
01:39:47,491 --> 01:39:49,486
January 21?

983
01:39:51,246 --> 01:39:53,073
The last one!

984
01:39:53,665 --> 01:39:54,993
1-7-4-3-0?

985
01:39:54,993 --> 01:39:57,492
1-7-4-3-0. You got it.

986
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:02,087
Thanks. I will make sure
all this stuff gets back to you.

987
01:40:06,595 --> 01:40:09,086
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

988
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:12,098
Whatever happened to that thing
with your wife?

989
01:40:14,686 --> 01:40:16,346
It's not over yet.

990
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:38,452
What's going on?

991
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,371
How should I know?

992
01:40:53,175 --> 01:40:56,974
I think his name is Alec Lentz.
A pathologist.

993
01:40:57,729 --> 01:41:00,101
I remember because he died last summer.

994
01:41:08,907 --> 01:41:10,899
Oh, my God. Richard!

995
01:41:11,868 --> 01:41:13,660
What are you doing here?

996
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:15,073
Hi, Kath.

997
01:41:30,595 --> 01:41:31,924
Have a look.

998
01:41:34,182 --> 01:41:36,590
- What do you think?
- Cold normal.

999
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:39,010
Clearly not the same tissue.

1000
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:42,852
And not only did they all come
from healthy livers...

1001
01:41:43,358 --> 01:41:45,647
...they all came from the same liver.

1002
01:41:47,529 --> 01:41:49,189
Kath, you beauty.

1003
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:56,865
Excuse me.

1004
01:41:57,622 --> 01:41:59,033
Mr. Roosevelt?

1005
01:42:00,375 --> 01:42:03,958
I am Deputy Biggs, this is Deputy Newman.
We're U.S. marshals.

1006
01:42:03,958 --> 01:42:07,628
We need some information about
a Dr. Lentz who was on the staff here.

1007
01:42:07,628 --> 01:42:12,378
I want to know if he knew or had
any contact with a Dr. Richard Kimble?

1008
01:42:12,721 --> 01:42:14,630
I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.

1009
01:42:15,807 --> 01:42:17,218
I didn't ask that.

1010
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:19,804
I wouldn't know.

1011
01:42:20,145 --> 01:42:23,977
If you will excuse me,
I have prior obligations to attend to.

1012
01:42:26,985 --> 01:42:28,776
I think you're lying to us.

1013
01:42:30,155 --> 01:42:32,147
You think Lentz is the bad guy?

1014
01:42:33,241 --> 01:42:34,735
Yeah, why not?

1015
01:42:36,328 --> 01:42:39,910
He was one of the original
patent boys in RDU-90.

1016
01:42:41,249 --> 01:42:43,538
I was sending in my tissue samples...

1017
01:42:44,085 --> 01:42:47,917
...he was replacing them with
healthy samples, issuing the path reports...

1018
01:42:47,917 --> 01:42:50,129
...and shit-canning my stuff. Piece of cake.

1019
01:42:50,129 --> 01:42:51,248
Wait a minute.

1020
01:42:51,593 --> 01:42:54,001
Lentz died August 21.

1021
01:42:56,097 --> 01:43:00,510
Half the samples he approved
were signed the day he died.

1022
01:43:01,853 --> 01:43:03,134
You're kidding.

1023
01:43:05,023 --> 01:43:07,775
Someone else must have been
manipulating this.

1024
01:43:08,443 --> 01:43:09,937
Someone with access.

1025
01:43:21,623 --> 01:43:22,868
Thanks, Kath.

1026
01:43:23,291 --> 01:43:24,750
Where are you going?

1027
01:43:26,128 --> 01:43:27,538
To see a friend.

1028
01:43:32,884 --> 01:43:34,793
This is giving me a headache.

1029
01:43:35,137 --> 01:43:38,968
That's surprising. Where did
Roosevelt say Kimble was going?

1030
01:43:38,968 --> 01:43:41,299
He says he doesn't know
where Kimble was going.

1031
01:43:41,726 --> 01:43:43,636
<i>- Do you believe him?
- Yes, I believe him.</i>

1032
01:43:43,636 --> 01:43:46,480
<i>He says he was here to pick up
some tissue samples...</i>

1033
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,059
<i>...for a drug study.</i>

1034
01:43:48,059 --> 01:43:49,775
But listen, get this.

1035
01:43:49,775 --> 01:43:52,986
The release was approved
by Dr. Charles Nichols.

1036
01:43:53,738 --> 01:43:56,408
<i>Nichols also knew Lentz.</i>

1037
01:43:57,242 --> 01:43:58,736
<i>He was Lentz's boss.</i>

1038
01:43:58,736 --> 01:44:00,405
He was covering for Kimble.

1039
01:44:00,405 --> 01:44:02,404
Send the C.P.D. over there right now.

1040
01:44:02,404 --> 01:44:06,910
We're going to send a bunch of cops.
Make sure they turn that place inside out.

1041
01:44:06,910 --> 01:44:10,453
Don't let them give you shit
about your ponytail either. Well done.

1042
01:44:10,755 --> 01:44:12,166
My pleasure, Sam.

1043
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:16,919
Dr. Nichols lied to me.

1044
01:44:16,919 --> 01:44:19,088
- Go find him.
- I am on it.

1045
01:44:26,938 --> 01:44:28,433
It's gone by now.

1046
01:44:28,433 --> 01:44:32,106
I looked every place you told me
to look and I didn't see him.

1047
01:44:32,106 --> 01:44:33,522
I am telling you.

1048
01:44:33,522 --> 01:44:36,613
If he was in the hospital,
I would have found him.

1049
01:44:36,865 --> 01:44:38,774
So what do you want me to do?

1050
01:44:39,785 --> 01:44:41,611
Hold on. Wait a minute.

1051
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:44,361
I marked him. I got him now.

1052
01:45:13,318 --> 01:45:15,560
Dr. Alexander Lentz.

1053
01:45:15,987 --> 01:45:19,154
"A noted pathologist
at Chicago Memorial Hospital...

1054
01:45:19,154 --> 01:45:22,989
"...was walking to his daily tennis match
when an unidentified vehicle...

1055
01:45:22,989 --> 01:45:24,572
"...slammed his body...

1056
01:45:24,572 --> 01:45:28,495
"...into the barriers that separate
the drive from Lake Michigan."

1057
01:45:31,169 --> 01:45:33,245
Sam, you're not going to believe this.

1058
01:45:33,245 --> 01:45:36,837
Sykes' records for the past two years
show no calls to Kimble.

1059
01:45:37,175 --> 01:45:38,338
It was a thought.

1060
01:45:38,338 --> 01:45:42,092
But when I cross-checked
Kimble's phone records, one came up.

1061
01:45:42,092 --> 01:45:43,888
Kimble called Sykes.

1062
01:45:45,934 --> 01:45:47,393
Get Sykes in here now.

1063
01:45:47,393 --> 01:45:49,269
On the night of his wife's murder...

1064
01:45:49,269 --> 01:45:50,765
...7:30 p.m...

1065
01:45:50,765 --> 01:45:52,433
...from his car phone.

1066
01:45:52,433 --> 01:45:55,015
Do you have that arrest report on Kimble?

1067
01:46:00,949 --> 01:46:02,609
- 7:30 p.m.
- 19:30 hours.

1068
01:46:04,619 --> 01:46:06,945
They just went in. Sykes is gone.

1069
01:46:06,945 --> 01:46:09,364
- He's nowhere to be found.
- What?

1070
01:46:09,364 --> 01:46:10,786
He's gone.

1071
01:47:15,873 --> 01:47:22,999
I got a possible sighting of Richard Kimble
on northbound el coming into Van Buren.

1072
01:47:26,451 --> 01:47:28,361
Move to the door, Doc.

1073
01:47:39,881 --> 01:47:41,541
This is my stop.

1074
01:47:42,968 --> 01:47:44,628
This is my stop, too.

1075
01:48:44,905 --> 01:48:46,482
You missed your stop.

1076
01:49:09,513 --> 01:49:13,261
A transit cop spotted Kimble on the el,
he is heading toward Balbo.

1077
01:49:13,261 --> 01:49:15,058
The C.P.D. is on the way.

1078
01:49:50,721 --> 01:49:55,383
<i>Attention all units. Transit police
report officer down at Balbo Station.</i>

1079
01:49:55,726 --> 01:49:58,217
<i>Kimble is suspect. Repeat, officer down.</i>

1080
01:49:58,604 --> 01:50:00,146
What did he do, shoot a cop?

1081
01:50:00,146 --> 01:50:02,306
Chicago P.D. will eat him alive.

1082
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:13,408
<i>It is a joy and a privilege
to introduce tonight's keynote speaker.</i>

1083
01:50:24,254 --> 01:50:26,081
<i>For the past four years...</i>

1084
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:29,590
<i>...he has served
as the A. Jude Robinson Fellow...</i>

1085
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:32,926
<i>...and Administrative Chief of Pathology...</i>

1086
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:35,504
<i>...at Chicago Memorial Hospital.</i>

1087
01:50:40,145 --> 01:50:42,517
Where are the emergency exits?

1088
01:50:43,523 --> 01:50:47,604
<i>Suspect seen entering Hilton Tower Mall,
lower level. Repeat...</i>

1089
01:50:48,403 --> 01:50:49,518
You don't think--

1090
01:50:49,518 --> 01:50:51,273
I know where he's going.

1091
01:50:53,116 --> 01:50:55,074
Biggs, Newman, come in, where are you?

1092
01:50:56,411 --> 01:50:59,033
<i>He's been appointed
to the Board of Directors...</i>

1093
01:50:59,033 --> 01:51:01,530
<i>...of Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.</i>

1094
01:51:02,167 --> 01:51:04,207
<i>Will you all please give a warm welcome...</i>

1095
01:51:04,670 --> 01:51:06,828
<i>...to Dr. Charles Nichols.</i>

1096
01:51:13,345 --> 01:51:15,966
<i>Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1097
01:51:15,966 --> 01:51:18,049
<i>...my friends and colleagues.</i>

1098
01:51:18,559 --> 01:51:20,800
<i>It's great you're all here tonight.</i>

1099
01:51:33,574 --> 01:51:37,156
C.P.D. reported an officer down
and a guy with two guns--

1100
01:51:37,156 --> 01:51:39,403
- Kimble do it?
- Conflicting reports.

1101
01:51:39,403 --> 01:51:41,405
He entered the hotel from the subway.

1102
01:51:41,405 --> 01:51:43,242
- That's my man!
- Not anymore.

1103
01:51:43,242 --> 01:51:45,575
He's going down.
You can help by staying out.

1104
01:51:45,575 --> 01:51:46,997
Arrest us!

1105
01:51:46,997 --> 01:51:49,496
Lock it up! Start at the lower level.

1106
01:51:52,176 --> 01:51:54,797
<i>All units report when lower level is secure.</i>

1107
01:51:57,097 --> 01:51:59,849
<i>All units secure all lower level exits.</i>

1108
01:52:00,684 --> 01:52:04,848
Go and find the hotel security office.
Stay in touch with me on the radio.

1109
01:52:07,524 --> 01:52:09,102
<i>Now, a new drug...</i>

1110
01:52:09,102 --> 01:52:13,362
<i>...on the cusp of approval
by the Food and Drug Administration...</i>

1111
01:52:13,362 --> 01:52:17,480
<i>...is poised to change
these old methods forever.</i>

1112
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:20,735
Deputy Newman, U.S. Marshal's Service.

1113
01:52:22,122 --> 01:52:23,616
Sam, I am in.

1114
01:52:27,377 --> 01:52:31,043
<i>...through the normal metabolic pathways
in the liver.</i>

1115
01:52:32,216 --> 01:52:34,374
<i>The drug's name is...</i>

1116
01:52:34,374 --> 01:52:35,927
<i>...Provasic.</i>

1117
01:52:37,429 --> 01:52:39,636
<i>As I will show you tonight...</i>

1118
01:52:39,636 --> 01:52:42,635
<i>...Provasic is remarkably effective...</i>

1119
01:52:42,635 --> 01:52:45,935
<i>...and has no side effects whatsoever.</i>

1120
01:52:46,230 --> 01:52:48,899
<i>It is also noteworthy that this drug...</i>

1121
01:52:54,154 --> 01:52:56,361
<i>That this drug was developed...</i>

1122
01:52:56,361 --> 01:52:59,865
<i>...in cooperation, not competition,
with Chicago Memorial Hospital...</i>

1123
01:52:59,865 --> 01:53:01,779
<i>...in what we hope will be...</i>

1124
01:53:01,779 --> 01:53:04,705
<i>...the model for a continued dishonest...</i>

1125
01:53:05,457 --> 01:53:07,165
<i>...excuse me, honest...</i>

1126
01:53:10,712 --> 01:53:12,123
<i>...open joint ventures...</i>

1127
01:53:12,123 --> 01:53:14,705
<i>...between academic medicine...</i>

1128
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:17,090
<i>...and the pharmaceutical industry...</i>

1129
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:18,458
<i>Richard!</i>

1130
01:53:19,888 --> 01:53:23,304
<i>I am sorry, I am in the middle of this speech.</i>

1131
01:53:23,809 --> 01:53:25,718
You almost got away with it, didn't you?

1132
01:53:28,188 --> 01:53:29,730
I know all about it.

1133
01:53:31,567 --> 01:53:32,895
I can prove it.

1134
01:53:34,403 --> 01:53:38,317
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, my friend,
Richard Kimble doesn't feel well...</i>

1135
01:53:38,574 --> 01:53:39,984
<i>...obviously...</i>

1136
01:53:40,409 --> 01:53:43,742
<i>...so it you just go on
with your dessert and coffee...</i>

1137
01:53:43,996 --> 01:53:47,495
<i>Richard, do you mind to step aside
and let's talk.</i>

1138
01:53:49,251 --> 01:53:52,335
<i>So I will be back in just a second.</i>

1139
01:53:56,216 --> 01:53:58,588
You changed the samples, didn't you?

1140
01:54:00,345 --> 01:54:02,718
You switched the samples...

1141
01:54:02,718 --> 01:54:04,508
...after Lentz died.

1142
01:54:06,351 --> 01:54:08,759
<i>Let's stay calm, people.</i>

1143
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:13,599
After Lentz died,
you were the only one who had the access.

1144
01:54:14,777 --> 01:54:16,853
You switched the samples...

1145
01:54:17,362 --> 01:54:19,604
...and the pathology reports.

1146
01:54:19,604 --> 01:54:21,276
You killed Lentz, too?

1147
01:54:21,276 --> 01:54:22,742
<i>Can we get some Security?</i>

1148
01:54:22,742 --> 01:54:23,947
Did you?

1149
01:54:24,787 --> 01:54:27,360
He falsified his research...

1150
01:54:28,749 --> 01:54:31,121
...so RDU-90 could be...

1151
01:54:31,121 --> 01:54:32,704
...approved and...

1152
01:54:32,704 --> 01:54:36,045
...Devlin MacGregor
could give you Provasic.

1153
01:54:38,258 --> 01:54:39,717
<i>All right, it's all over, folks.</i>

1154
01:54:39,717 --> 01:54:41,426
<i>Let's just stay calm.</i>

1155
01:54:57,903 --> 01:55:01,023
You never give up, Richard, do you?
You never give up!

1156
01:55:24,096 --> 01:55:25,294
Why Helen?

1157
01:55:28,183 --> 01:55:29,263
Glad you're here.

1158
01:55:29,263 --> 01:55:30,810
Which way did they go?

1159
01:55:30,810 --> 01:55:33,017
- Toward the Presidential Suite.
- Where's that?

1160
01:55:33,017 --> 01:55:36,022
- Southeast corner.
- How many exits are there from this room?

1161
01:55:36,022 --> 01:55:39,441
We got a total of four:
Two on the east, two on the west.

1162
01:55:40,696 --> 01:55:42,024
Kimble's on the roof!

1163
01:55:42,614 --> 01:55:44,192
Cosmo, that way.

1164
01:55:56,962 --> 01:55:59,204
<i>Stop! Stay where you are!</i>

1165
01:55:59,204 --> 01:56:01,208
<i>This is the Chicago police!</i>

1166
01:56:01,884 --> 01:56:03,876
<i>Put your hands in the air!</i>

1167
01:56:03,876 --> 01:56:06,341
<i>The building is totally secure.</i>

1168
01:56:06,638 --> 01:56:09,046
<i>I repeat, do not move!</i>

1169
01:56:09,975 --> 01:56:11,719
<i>Put your hands in the air!</i>

1170
01:56:12,644 --> 01:56:14,602
<i>I repeat, stay where you are!</i>

1171
01:56:38,504 --> 01:56:39,749
Talk to me.

1172
01:56:39,749 --> 01:56:42,591
They're headed to the north end
of the roof.

1173
01:56:42,591 --> 01:56:43,921
Newman!

1174
01:56:44,927 --> 01:56:47,003
Get that helicopter out of here!

1175
01:56:50,766 --> 01:56:52,889
As soon as you get a clean shot...

1176
01:56:52,889 --> 01:56:54,678
...you take him out.

1177
01:57:12,913 --> 01:57:14,953
Newman, get rid of the helicopter!

1178
01:57:14,953 --> 01:57:17,412
<i>- Why?
- Because I don't want to get shot!</i>

1179
01:57:17,412 --> 01:57:21,541
C.P.D., there's a U.S. marshal
out on the roof. Hold your fire!

1180
01:57:21,797 --> 01:57:24,122
<i>Call off the helicopter!</i>

1181
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:13,009
Don't shoot.

1182
01:58:16,352 --> 01:58:18,178
Does this guy ever quit?

1183
01:58:18,178 --> 01:58:20,512
Find out where that elevator stops.

1184
01:58:21,857 --> 01:58:24,229
Northwest elevator! Where does it stop?

1185
01:58:24,229 --> 01:58:26,476
Where did they go?

1186
01:58:57,142 --> 01:58:59,135
They have stopped at the fifth floor.

1187
01:58:59,135 --> 01:59:01,849
- What's on the fifth floor?
- The laundry.

1188
01:59:03,232 --> 01:59:05,308
<i>They stopped at the laundry.</i>

1189
01:59:49,194 --> 01:59:52,195
We're on the fifth floor. What's your 20?

1190
01:59:53,282 --> 01:59:54,776
We're right behind you.

1191
01:59:54,776 --> 01:59:56,859
What the hell is going on here?

1192
01:59:57,119 --> 02:00:00,369
You got to keep the C.P.D. out.
They're much too hot to suit me.

1193
02:00:00,369 --> 02:00:02,614
I want you to get rid of all these people.

1194
02:00:02,614 --> 02:00:04,119
Okay, people, stay calm.

1195
02:00:04,119 --> 02:00:05,870
Cosmo, come with me.

1196
02:01:27,209 --> 02:01:29,747
Dr. Richard Kimble!

1197
02:01:30,546 --> 02:01:32,752
There's no way out of here, Richard!

1198
02:01:34,133 --> 02:01:36,802
The entire building is locked down!

1199
02:01:39,472 --> 02:01:41,630
Give it up, you don't have any time!

1200
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:44,808
Chicago Police Department thinks
you're a cop killer!

1201
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:48,301
They will shoot you on sight!

1202
02:01:51,984 --> 02:01:54,060
Richard, I know you're innocent!

1203
02:01:55,488 --> 02:01:57,895
I know about Fredrick Sykes!

1204
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:03,411
I know about Dr. Charles Nichols!

1205
02:02:05,331 --> 02:02:08,747
Richard, he borrowed your car
the night of your wife's murder!

1206
02:02:08,747 --> 02:02:10,494
He had the keys!

1207
02:02:10,494 --> 02:02:12,662
No forced entry, Richard.

1208
02:02:13,923 --> 02:02:16,840
He telephoned Sykes
from your car, Richard!

1209
02:02:24,433 --> 02:02:26,177
Give it up!

1210
02:02:28,521 --> 02:02:31,522
I am either lying or I am going to shoot you!

1211
02:02:32,691 --> 02:02:34,186
What do you think?

1212
02:02:53,546 --> 02:02:56,879
Give it up! It's time to stop running!

1213
02:03:37,548 --> 02:03:39,339
They killed my wife.

1214
02:03:40,176 --> 02:03:41,634
I know it, Richard.

1215
02:03:43,179 --> 02:03:44,377
I know it.

1216
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:47,884
But, it's over now.

1217
02:03:50,686 --> 02:03:52,679
You know, I am glad.

1218
02:03:52,679 --> 02:03:54,515
I need the rest.

1219
02:04:09,205 --> 02:04:11,078
Who killed Kimble's wife?

1220
02:04:11,290 --> 02:04:13,199
Kimble was convicted of it.

1221
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:16,080
You have got a one-armed man in custody.

1222
02:04:16,295 --> 02:04:18,335
- Is that the guy?
- I have no idea.

1223
02:04:18,335 --> 02:04:20,000
How many one-armed men are there?

1224
02:04:20,257 --> 02:04:22,001
At this point, there're a lot of them.

1225
02:04:22,001 --> 02:04:24,085
Could you have made a mistake?

1226
02:04:31,894 --> 02:04:34,467
You got a deadline?
Play the weather over again.

1227
02:04:34,814 --> 02:04:39,226
Tell Samuel Gerard I am going home now.
I am taking my vacation.

1228
02:04:42,446 --> 02:04:44,818
Clear this area. Everybody clear.

1229
02:05:02,466 --> 02:05:03,842
Watch your head.

1230
02:05:14,979 --> 02:05:16,853
Where is that thing?

1231
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,432
Let me see those hands, Doctor.

1232
02:05:37,877 --> 02:05:39,537
I thought you didn't care.

1233
02:05:39,537 --> 02:05:40,873
I don't.

1234
02:05:43,883 --> 02:05:45,674
Don't tell anybody, okay?

1235
02:09:59,055 --> 02:10:01,131
