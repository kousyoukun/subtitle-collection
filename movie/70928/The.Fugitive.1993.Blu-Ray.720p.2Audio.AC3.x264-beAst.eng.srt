1
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,490


2
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,280
Come on, Doc.

3
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,560
Reporting live from the home...

4
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,040
...of Dr. Richard Kimble...

5
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,160
...a respected vascular surgeon at Chicago Memorial Hospital.

6
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,070
Details are sketchy...

7
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,080
...but we understand Dr. Kimble's wife, Helen, was found murdered this evening.

8
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,110
Area Six detectives are bringing Dr. Kimble out.

9
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,850
We assume that they're gonna be taking him to a police station, probably Area Six...

10
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,080
...where they hope he can shed some light on what happened here this evening.

11
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,900
Now, as I indicated, she was found shortly before midnight.

12
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,400
We know that she made apparently a 911 call to police...

13
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,870
...indicating that she was being assaulted by an intruder.

14
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,740
Details are very sketchy.

15
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,300
We do know that he and his wife Helen...

16
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,830
...were at the Four Seasons Hotel earlier tonight...

17
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,740
...a fundraiser for the Children's Research Fund.

18
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,450
Rich, remember Cara?

19
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,980
- Nice to see you. - Nice to see you.

20
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,390
Straighten that arm or you're gonna slice.

21
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,860
Golf pro teach you that?

22
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,270
My wife.

23
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,770
Before I forget...

24
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,300
...thanks for the loaner. Keys are downstairs.

25
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,640
- Any gas in it? - Yes. Enough.

26
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,510
Alec, Richard Kimble.

27
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,610
- How are you? - Dr. Kimble!

28
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,120
absolutely, any time

29
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,220
I think this is a good idea

30
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,890
Knock it off!

31
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,130
There's nothing to see here. And you, come with me.

32
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,700
Thank you. I was just down to my last joke.

33
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,340
You look really beautiful tonight.

34
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,880
Thanks, honey.

35
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,860
I know you hate these things, but God, I love looking at you in a tux.

36
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,220
I feel I look like a waiter or something.

37
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,060
Hello

38
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,860
- Dr. Kimble? - Yes, it is.

39
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,730
Sorry to bother you, sir...

40
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,770
...but Dr. Stevens is in Emergency Surgery and needs your help.

41
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,040
Call him back and tell him I'll be right there.

42
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,700
Thank you, Doctor.

43
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,440
Thank you. Good night.

44
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,350
I'll wait up for you.

45
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,010
I'll wait up for you.

46
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,450
Talk to me. What have we here?

47
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,010
Thanks for coming.

48
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,510
A 58- year - old. Just pulled his gallbladder. Bleeding.

49
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,150
Big time. It's in the liver bed.

50
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,630
- What are his coags? - They're all messed up.

51
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,060
PT's 36 and the rest are off the wall.

52
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,190
Where is he from?

53
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,670
Lentz's name is on the chart. We paged him, but no answer.

54
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,640
Here guys. Let me in there. Give me some room.

55
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,700
Give me a clamp.

56
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,270
Give me suction.

57
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,040
Have you been getting any threats at work?

58
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,110
Co workers, hospital staff, anyone?

59
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,780
No

60
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,980
Anything unusual going on...

61
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,480
...phone calls, people hanging up?

62
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,360
Maybe people coming to the door? Tradespeople?

63
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,090
Not that I know of.

64
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,500
Back to this fight with this guy with one arm.

65
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,530
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?

66
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,430
Upstairs.

67
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,330
And he had which? A right or a left arm?

68
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,800
With a gimmick on it?

69
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,600
Right arm.

70
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,210
Is it one of those with the hooks, or...

71
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,450
No, he had a cosmetic hand.

72
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,980
The security system in your house, it's a pretty good one.

73
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,880
Anyone else have the coding?

74
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,660
Our maid.

75
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,760
She knows the code and has a key.

76
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,130
Those scratches on your neck...

77
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,100
...did the one - armed guy do that?

78
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,540
Helen scratched me when I was trying to move her.

79
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,940
Before or after you had the fight with the one - armed man?

80
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,310
I told you.

81
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,250
You own a gun, Doc?

82
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,020
Do you own a gun?

83
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,820
Yes, we have a gun in the house.

84
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,520
Is it registered in your name?

85
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,460
Yes.

86
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,250
Where do you usually keep that gun?

87
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,950
The one that you own.

88
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,890
It's in Helen's table.

89
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,120
Bedside table.

90
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,100
Do you keep much jewelry in the house?

91
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,940
His fingerprints are all over the lamp...

92
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,110
...the gun and the bullets...

93
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,840
...and the good doctor's skin is under her fingernails.

94
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,640
She's got the money in the family, hasn't she?

95
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,890
- Helen comes from a wealthy family - yes.

96
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,750
Is she insured?

97
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,080
Yes, she is.

98
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,420
Who's the beneficiary?

99
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,670
I am.

100
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,930
The sole beneficiary?

101
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,100
Yes.

102
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,170
Financially, you won't be hurting after this, will you?

103
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,240
I mean, she was worth quite a bit of money.

104
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,010
Are you suggesting that I killed my wife?

105
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,420
You're saying that I crushed her skull and shot her.

106
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,950
How dare you!

107
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,490
When I came home, there was a man in my house.

108
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,720
I fought with this man.

109
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,780
The one-armed man.He had a mechanical arm.

110
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,760
- Plastic? Rubber? - You find this man!

111
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,570
You find this man!

112
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,610
How tall?

113
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,570
He took everything from me.

114
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,010
Oh, Jesus.

115
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,630
- What did he weigh? - Oh, Jesus.

116
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,440
What color was his hair?

117
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,020
What color were his eyes?

118
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,920
We can't help you if you don't help us.

119
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,480
Book him.

120
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,590
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

121
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:47,430
...you will hear iron-clad proof of Richard Kimble's guilt.

122
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,830
Indisputable scientific evidence...

123
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,460
...that on the night of January 20...

124
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,230
...Richard Kimble did in fact viciously...

125
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,640
...attack...

126
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,840
...and brutally murder his wife.

127
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,580
But you'll hear more than that.

128
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,450
You will hear a voice from the grave.

129
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,050
The voice of Helen Kimble identifying her killer...

130
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,290
...her husband, Richard Kimble.

131
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,120
Detective Kelly...

132
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,530
...tell us what you observed at the home of the victim on the night of the murder.

133
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,500
No forcible entry was found.

134
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,800
From the beginning of the investigation, it didn't appear to be a break - in.

135
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,070
Nothing was missing.

136
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,750
Honey, I'm home.

137
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,810
Who won the game?

138
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,790
His prints were on the gun and bullets.

139
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,790
No other sets were found, other than the housekeeper's...

140
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,260
...and the deceased's.

141
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:55,390
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused a massive hemorrhage to the brain.

142
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,730
It took less than 5 minutes for her to die.

143
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,220
Your Honor, we would ask to play Helen Kimble's 911 emergency call...

144
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,790
...previously identified by a Chicago Police Department dispatcher.

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,390
Emergency 911.

146
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,660
Please help me.

147
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,920
What's the problem?

148
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,630
He's...

149
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,940
He's still in the house.

150
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,840
Did I hear you right?

151
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,670
Someone's in your house?

152
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,540
He's trying to kill me.

153
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,650
Could you repeat that, please?

154
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,380
Ma'am?

155
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,480
He's trying to kill me.

156
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,920
Lady

157
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,590
Is your attacker still in the house?

158
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,430
Lady

159
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,660
Richard...

160
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,030
Lady

161
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,560
Richard...

162
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,630
Is he trying to kill me?

163
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,010
Mr. Kimble...

164
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,350
...having considered all the factors and aggravation and mitigation in this case...

165
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,020
...and found the offense was brutal and indicative of wanton cruelty...

166
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,770
...it's judgment of this court, you will be remanded to Illinois State Penitentiary...

167
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,670
...where you will await execution by lethal injection...

168
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,870
...on a date to be set forth by the Attorney General of the State.

169
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,710
May God have mercy on your soul.

170
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,060
- Carlson. - Here.

171
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,500
- Partida. - Yeah.

172
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,430
- Copeland. - What?

173
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,010
Copeland, you be nice now.

174
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,210
Kimble.

175
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,540
Yeah.

176
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,180
Let's go, gentlemen.

177
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,450
Four prisoners coming out.

178
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,360
Four prisoners coming out.

179
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,570
Let's go, gentlemen.

180
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,480
Kimble, you're here.

181
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,850
Carlson, right over there.

182
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,150
Partida, up front left.

183
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,490
Copeland, you're back here with me.

184
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,770
Come on, make yourselves comfortable.

185
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,970
You know the routine, gentlemen.

186
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,230
I'm tired.

187
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,300
20 miles from Menard.

188
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,770
We'll be there in about 40 minutes.

189
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,580
I'll be glad to get rid of this load. Let McKenzie take care of them.

190
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,080
Always got some good eating there. I'm starving.

191
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,490
Me, too.

192
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,950
Had enough prison chow.

193
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,960
Old Ed, he don't care. His old lady's got him on a diet.

194
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,090
Right, Ed?

195
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,010
Somebody get in here, quick!

196
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,450
He's getting sick! Let's go move! Move!

197
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,310
- He's foaming at the mouth. - We're almost at the prison.

198
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,580
He's choking!

199
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,590
Wait!

200
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,410
Oh, shit!

201
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,950
Kimble, get over here. You're a doctor, do something!

202
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,410
Unlock me!

203
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,760
Unlock me!

204
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,850
Catch

205
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,700
You'll be okay.

206
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,030
What the hell is that?

207
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,270
Shit!

208
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,810
- Help me! - The hell with you.

209
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,750
Help me with this man!

210
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,890
Fouck your doctor

211
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,520
Now you listen.

212
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,530
I don't give a damn which way you go.

213
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,930
Just don't follow me. You got that?

214
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,430
Yes

215
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,630
Kaplan

216
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,800
Be good.

217
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,740
My, my, my.

218
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,480
What a mess.

219
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,210
It's a circus.

220
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,260
You got my bag?

221
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,860
Point of impact right here.

222
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,200
The first engine uncoupled, and the train jumped the track.

223
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,760
About 100 yards?

224
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,500
Yes

225
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,800
You must get new boots.

226
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,270
I told you not to wear the heels.

227
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,900
Wear two coats.

228
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,270
Next train wreck.

229
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,710
Why do we always mother her?

230
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,340
Because she loves us.

231
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,810
- How'd you like to be the driver? - I bet he did a Casey Jones.

232
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,140
Hold it, sir.

233
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,950
Hi. Who's in charge?

234
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,960
Sheriff Rollins.

235
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,190
Just follow the TV lights.

236
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,290
Sheriff Rogers.

237
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,760
Rollins!

238
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,060
Look down there and take Newman.

239
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:32,700
Ok

240
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,730
Come on. Time to go to work.

241
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,840
The bus rolled over several times before settling down at the bottom of the hill.

242
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,310
I don't know if I passed out or what...

243
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,450
...but when I looked up, the train was bearing down on us. Fast.

244
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,220
I don't know how. It's still kind of hazy.

245
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,720
Somehow I grabbed him and pushed him out of the bus.

246
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,250
- You're brave, you could've been killed. - I know.

247
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,260
He's my partner. He would have done the same for me.

248
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,660
Excuse me, I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, I'd like to...

249
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,660
I'll be with you in just a minute.

250
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,570
sure

251
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,670
One more time, just for the record...

252
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,840
- these three are dead. - Yes

253
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,010
And this one?

254
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,380
Everything happened so fast.

255
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,320
I don't think he made it.

256
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,860
You came a long way for nothing.

257
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,890
With all due respect, Sheriff Rollins...

258
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,520
...I'd like to recommend checkpoints on a 15- mile radius...

259
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,130
...at I-57, I-24 and over here on Route 13...

260
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,560
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.

261
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,590
Checkpoints will get a lot of people frantic and they'll flood my office with calls.

262
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,640
Well, shit, I'd hate to see that happen...

263
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,540
...so I'll take over your investigation.

264
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,680
On what authority?

265
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,080
The governor...

266
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,380
...the U.S. Marshal's Office...

267
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,610
...5th District, Northern Illinois.

268
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,120
All right, you want jurisdiction over this mess. You got it.

269
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,590
Okay, boys, gather around and listen up.

270
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,920
We're shutting it down. Wyatt Earp is here to mop up...

271
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,860
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.

272
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,200
Sam.

273
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,470
Look here!

274
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,540
We're always fascinated when we find leg irons with no legs in them.

275
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,140
Who held the key, sir?

276
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,240
Me.

277
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,010
Where're those keys at?

278
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,280
I don't know.

279
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,510
Care to revise your statement, sir?

280
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,480
What?

281
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,280
Do you want to change your bullshit story, sir?

282
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,120
He might've got out.

283
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
- He might've got out. - You said he was part of the wreckage!

284
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,060
Set up operations by the fire truck. Listen, everyone!

285
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,770
A fugitive has been on the run for 90 minutes.

286
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,470
Average foot speed over uneven ground, barring injury, is four miles an hour.

287
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,800
That gives us a radius of six miles.

288
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:01,280
What I want out of each and everyone of you is a hard target search of every...

289
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,880
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse, hen house, outhouse...

290
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,390
...and doghouse in that area.

291
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,790
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.

292
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,420
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.

293
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,130
Go get him.

294
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,100


295
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,370
Please don't give me shit.

296
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,280
I got three very unhappy dead people. Put him on.

297
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,550
Stevens, it's Cosmo.

298
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,520
I'll have a satellite telephone hookup in two seconds.

299
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,050
Chester Police just found a blood trail...

300
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,850
...two miles southwest.

301
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,830
Match that blood against the prisoners'.

302
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,760
Renfer

303
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,730
Get a fax I.D. on Kimble to every local hospital.

304
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,890
And follow that with troopers.

305
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,440
Meiwen

306
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,940
What are you doing?

307
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,610
I'm thinking.

308
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,270
Think me up some coffee and a doughnut with sprinkles on top...

309
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,080
...while you're thinking.

310
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,970
We got a live body!

311
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,540
A live one?

312
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,210
To find a survivor

313
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,260
Come on. Hang in there, brother. We'll get you out of here.

314
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:24,920
Good access

315
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,050
Carefully on the ground

316
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,160
Get that ambulance down here! Come on!

317
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,430
Get that ambulance down here

318
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,430
Is this what you want?

319
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,500
That's it.

320
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,560
I'm going to make some copies.

321
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:10,520
Good morning, Mr. Johnson. I have your breakfast for you.

322
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,530
We're thirsty today, aren't we?

323
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,040
Eat up before this gets cold.

324
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,280
It really does get dry in here, doesn't it?

325
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,440
Here you are.

326
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,650
Now, you eat something, Mr. Johnson.

327
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,490
You need your strength.

328
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,020
Bad Luck

329
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,840
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner from that wreck.

330
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:23,970
He might be hurt.

331
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,600
What does he look like?

332
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,010
Six - one, 180, brown hair, brown eyes, beard.

333
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,310
Seen anyone like that around?

334
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,610
Every time I look in the mirror, pal.

335
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,610
Except for the beard, of course.

336
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,680
Doc!

337
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,810
What's wrong

338
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,450
Thanks.

339
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,540
- I'll give you a hand. - Thanks, Doc.

340
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,700
It's...

341
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,910
How is he doing?

342
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,010
Good, considering we dug him out from under a train.

343
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,350
Tell those attending he's got a puncture in the upper gastric area.

344
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,890
How could he tell that by looking at his face?

345
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,530
Background just came in from Chicago.

346
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,730
About time. What've we got?

347
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,570
"Richard Davis Kimble, vascular surgeon." What the hell is that?

348
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,710
Somebody that makes more money than you.

349
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,680
"Convicted of first - degree murder of his wife.

350
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,920
"Pleaded innocent." Says a one - armed man did it.

351
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,420
Lots of friends.

352
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,820
Doctors, hospital staff.

353
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,180
We'll start there. I want phone taps. First, his lawyer.

354
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,230
You'll never going to get that.

355
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,030
Call Judge Rubin. Tell him I want phone taps.

356
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,760
Why'd you yell at me?

357
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,000
I'll tell him who if I'm in a good mood.

358
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,000
Why not yell at her sometimes?

359
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,430
- sam - What's wrong

360
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,010
We got a call from the hospital.

361
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,010
The wounded guard swears he saw Kimble there.

362
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,900
That's hot.

363
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,810
And an ambulance is missing.

364
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,440
Where the hell is he going in an ambulance?

365
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,930
Gila

366
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,900
Ambulance just spotted...

367
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,430
...two miles west of Doverville, heading north, State Highway 53.

368
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,830
Running out of map!

369
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,310
Get your maps out.

370
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,980
Check, sound check. Get your maps out.

371
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,970
I want to know all routes in and out of that town.

372
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,650
We're headed north on Route 13, toward the Barkley Dam.

373
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,050
Son of a bitch!

374
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,930
Don't lose that ambulance.

375
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:47,810
Visual location of an ambulance headed north on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.

376
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,580
We'll pass through a viaduct.

377
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,220
Get on the horn. Bring Biggs and Newman in from the south side of the viaduct.

378
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,690
He's hauling ass.

379
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,130
Is there a tunnel between here and there? We have Biggs and Newman?

380
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,930
Look on your map to know how to get there.

381
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,560
We got him!

382
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,240
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

383
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,320
- What's going on? - Get back in your car, sir!

384
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,960
Newman! Rock and roll!

385
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,010
Put a light in there!

386
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,700
Put a light in there!

387
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,600
What do you got?

388
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,140
I got nothing.

389
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,820
- What do you got? - You gotta be kidding me!

390
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,580
- What - You gotta be kidding me!

391
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,410
shit!

392
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,120
shit!

393
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,590
Seal off the tunnel! Seal it off!

394
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,410
We got a gopher.

395
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,290
Shit! I just bought these shoes.

396
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,200
Shut up, Cosmo.

397
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,030
Which way, Sam?

398
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,710
I didn't kill my wife!

399
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,340
I don't care!

400
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,430
Put that gun down!

401
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,270
Put that gun down!

402
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,570
Now!

403
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,940
Hands up!

404
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,840
Over your head!

405
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,780
Turn around!

406
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,650
Richard, do you want to get shot?

407
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,620
Pay attention!

408
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,760
Get down on your knees!

409
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,660
Right now!

410
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,180
sam

411
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,580
What happened? Where'd he go?

412
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,320
He did a Peter Pan right here off this dam!

413
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,830
Right here!

414
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,800
Down! Boom! Holy shit!

415
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:16,490
Holy shit!

416
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,190
Can we go home now?

417
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,170
No.

418
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,070
Holy shit!

419
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,110
- There's no way out of here! - We must go up.

420
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,550
No

421
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:41,320
Go up the stairs! Up, up!

422
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,390
Have that water turned off. Come over here.

423
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,760
Put two patrol cars on that bridge down there, four patrolmen.

424
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,530
Have them glass this river upstream and down.

425
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:58,570
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this river. Make him aware of these wires.

426
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,900
Are you out of your mind? He's dead!

427
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,910
That'll make him easy to catch.

428
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,280
I want hounds on both banks of this river for two miles...

429
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,680
...upstream and downstream.

430
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,580
- You've got a search and rescue team? - yes we do

431
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,090
Get them down here and drag the bottom of this spillway.

432
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:21,560
- Why isn't the water turned off? - Somebody from County's working on it.

433
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,030
Bring in the helicopters now.

434
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,940
We're out of here!

435
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,030
I don't think there's anything to find.

436
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,810
Find it anyway. You've got lights and generators coming tonight.

437
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:38,260
- I won't tell you how to do your job... - Put the helicopter on the bridge!

438
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:43,240
...but only one person in a million could survive that fall. The guy is fish food!

439
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,740
Get a cane pole. Go catch the fish that ate him.

440
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,550
Get Stevens. Tell him we're on the way in.

441
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,080
That man took everything from me!

442
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,590
We can't find the guy.

443
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:47,730
You find that man!

444
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,570
You find that man!

445
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,620
The generators and searchlights are there now.

446
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,790
They'll continue the search into the night.

447
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,390
Good. Call Kentucky and thank them for the dogs.

448
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,460
Remember, opera ain't over until the Big Dog howls.

449
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,700
Need a ride?

450
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:41,680
Check it again.

451
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,190
All right, we got him. He shacked up with some babe over in Whiting.

452
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,810
She left work tonight and took him home.

453
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,030
- About two hours ago, her boss said. - They spotted her car outside her house.

454
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,860
Does she run with anyone?

455
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,420
No one we could find. No family either.

456
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:03,540
Tell the police not to move till we get there. We'll go first thing in the morning.

457
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,340
Your cousin still got his truck?

458
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,400
Call him. Tell him we need it.

459
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,730
- Be drunk, Newman. - Ok

460
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,260
Stay close.

461
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:35,030
Right on your ass, buddy.

462
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,110
I don't want you getting lost. You stick with me.

463
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,370
Ok

464
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,650
U.S. marshals! Everybody down!

465
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,000
Hold it right there! Show me those hands!

466
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,000
Keep them up!

467
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,950
Get your ass in there.

468
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:25,710
I got your man! I got your man, you hear me?

469
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,330
Please do not hurt him

470
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,910
I want out of here!

471
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,790
I got your man!

472
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,990
I got your man!

473
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:38,730
I'm going to blow his brains out! I want out of here!

474
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,260
Do you hear me, Cops?

475
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,400
Do you hear me?

476
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,030
I want out of here!

477
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:48,280
- Listen! We can work this out! - Yes, we can.

478
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,680
Shut up! Shut up!

479
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,550
Do you hear me?

480
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,150
Listen, and I'll tell you what I want.

481
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,150
I just want a car out front.

482
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,490
Don't shoot.

483
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,030
It's over.

484
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,380
Shut up!

485
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,480
I can't hear anything. My ear is...

486
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,730
I can't believe you did that.

487
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,690
You think I should've bargained with that guy.

488
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:18,460
Yeah.

489
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,600
I do.

490
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,860
You could have missed.

491
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,710
You could have killed me.

492
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,600
How bad is that ear?

493
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,470
Terrible. I'll have permanent damage.

494
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:33,850
Let me see it.

495
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,540
Come here.

496
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,710
Can you hear what I'm saying now?

497
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:39,910
Yeah.

498
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,490
I don't...

499
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,390
...bargain.

500
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,220
You hear that?

501
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,290
Yeah.

502
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:52,960
Good.

503
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,370
Walter, this is Richard.

504
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:42,290
Richard, Jesus! Why did you run? Running only makes you look guilty.

505
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,550
I wasn't worried about appearances, Walter.

506
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,270
Tell me where you are, so I can meet you and you can surrender.

507
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,850
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

508
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,320
Richard

509
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:56,680
You're asking me to harbor and aid a convicted felon. I can't help you that way.

510
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:01,010
My advice both as your friend and legal counselor is to give yourself up.

511
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,970
Now tell me, where are you?

512
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,000
St. Louis.

513
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,370
Give me an address. I'll get there as soon as I can.

514
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,940
Mr. Copeland was a bad man. He was going to kill one of my kids.

515
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,080
Well, sir, you can blame me. I'm the one that shot him.

516
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,650
Give yourself up. Now tell me, where are you?

517
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,300
St. Louis.

518
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:39,400
So he's not dead. Let that be a lesson to you.

519
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:43,670
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog. Big Dog is always right.

520
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,680
Yeah, you been right before.

521
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,740
Walter, this is Richard.

522
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:54,240
Why did you run? It only makes you look guilty.

523
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,860
I wasn't worried about appearances.

524
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,760
Tell me where you are, so I can meet you and you can surrender.

525
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,830
I won't surrender. I need help, money.

526
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,870
I might be crazy, but that train sounds like an El.

527
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,700
St. Louis doesn't have one.

528
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,400
How do you know it's an elevated train?

529
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:12,340
I lived under an El for 20 years.

530
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,180
Explain the difference between the sound of an El and a train on the ground.

531
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,540
You must have ears like an eagle.

532
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,950
Play that back. I want to hear the sound of an El.

533
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,930
What cities have Els? New York has got an El.

534
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,880
- Philly. - We do.Milwaukee has got an El.

535
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,930
Hold it! Where the lawyer says he's guilty. There's a bell in the background.

536
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:35,160
There's a guy on a P.A. Can you drop everything but him?

537
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,660
I'll try. Hold on.

538
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,940
Walter I'm Richard

539
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,100
Right there.

540
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,300
What's he saying?

541
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:49,120
Sounds like, "Next stop." Do that again!

542
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,870
"Next stop..."

543
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,070
"Merchandise Mart."

544
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,610
Son of a bitch! Our boy came home.

545
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:02,170
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge, six blocks away.

546
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,880
I knew it was an El.

547
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,190
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.

548
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:09,740
- I'll call the C.P.D. - This is his Chicago file.

549
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,820
Andiamo, bambini.

550
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,890
Sammy, when I die, I want to come back just like you.

551
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,440
Happy and handsome?

552
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,740
- I'll notify the press. - No press.

553
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,170
Right, no press.

554
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,390
- Hi, Billy. - How's it going, sir?

555
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,090
- Good, and you? - All right.

556
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,600
- Here you go, Billy. - Have a good one, sir.

557
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,580
Spare change? Dollar, mister?

558
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:04,740
No, thank you

559
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,610
No, thank you very much. I don't want it.

560
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,550
No

561
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,750
Oh, my God. Richard!

562
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:14,560
How are you, Charlie?

563
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:16,120
Jesus, you're back.

564
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,030
I need some money.

565
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,500
Sure, sure. Get in.

566
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,160
No, I can't. Just whatever you got on you.

567
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,570
You're hot, pal. If not now, you will be.

568
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,140
Have you got a place to stay? I mean, how can I help you?

569
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,540
You've got a green light. Move on!

570
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,640
I'll call you.

571
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,750
Charlie

572
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,530
So why did Richard Kimble kill his wife?

573
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,030
He did it for the money.

574
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,890
For the money? He's a doctor. He's already rich.

575
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,400
She was more rich.

576
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,300
Is this the entire Chicago Police Department file?

577
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:00,520
- That's everything. - I want to do all the interviews again.

578
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,680
The list of hospital staff is it in the file?

579
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,470
Sure is.

580
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,510
Thank you.

581
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,600
You don't want to use the media?

582
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:12,120
We want him to relax. Make himself comfortable. Try to re - enter his life.

583
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,350
Here's the apartment.

584
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:20,790
You can see here is heater. You will have warm.

585
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:23,190
Here is kitchen. Sink.

586
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,420
Over there is bathroom. And here is the room.

587
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:27,940
Is nice bed.

588
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,470
Plenty space.

589
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,070
You can look at.

590
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,430
So you like the place?

591
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,270
It's okay with you?

592
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,160
It's perfect.

593
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,360
All right, people.

594
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:06,410
As this morning we were notified by the U.S. Marshal's Office...

595
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:12,200
...that our old friend Dr. Richard Kimble is alive and well and back here in Chicago.

596
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,610
You all know in what high regard we hold this scumbag.

597
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,020
So I'm personally donating a bottle of 12- year - old Scotch...

598
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,620
...to whoever puts the collar on this quack.

599
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,190
Dick Rosetti is passing out bulletins.

600
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:40,530


601
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:32,310


602
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:50,830
- Help you? - Gracias.

603
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,870


604
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:19,800


605
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,930
You went to medical school together?

606
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,440
Yes, we did.

607
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,000
The class of '73.

608
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,770
You know Morton Feinberg?

609
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,850
- I do. - He's a real nice guy.

610
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:32,870
When did you see him last?

611
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,280
Who, Richard?

612
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,220
I saw Richard this morning.

613
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:40,710
You saw him this morning?

614
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:43,260
He stopped me in my car. I gave him money.

615
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,590
Where was this?

616
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,150
Outside my tennis club.

617
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,420
Did he ask for help?

618
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,520
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.

619
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,530
How much did you give him?

620
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,970
Couple of bucks. Just what I had on me.

621
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,660
- He won't get far on that. - Why'd he come back to Chicago?

622
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:02,940
He didn't tell me that, sir.

623
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:07,310
I'm sure he's trying to protect you from having to lie for him, but...

624
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,070
Dr. Nichols

625
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,850
You really want to be his friend and help him?

626
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,050
Help us bring him in unharmed.

627
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,150
Why?

628
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,820
So he can go back to prison?

629
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,320
If you want help, gentlemen, you've come to the wrong man.

630
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,500
Richard is innocent.

631
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,470
You'll never find him. He's too smart.

632
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,640
We're some smart guys.

633
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:40,440
What about us? We're smart. We are. How smart could he be, really?

634
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,380
Is he as smart as you are?

635
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,120
Smarter.

636
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,710
Peripheral vascular surgery. Fixing the arteries as they come out of the heart.

637
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:12,640
- How long have you known Kimble? - Ten years. Since I've been here.

638
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,680
What kind of medicine did he practice here at the hospital?

639
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,600
I want you to know that I believe Kimble to be innocent.

640
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,770
Would he come to you for help?

641
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:46,840
If he came to me, I would help.

642
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,950
But he wouldn't come to me.

643
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,540
That's not his style.

644
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,140
A warrant remains outstanding for Chicago surgeon, Richard Kimble.

645
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,120
This is where the one - armed guy he struggled fell down the stairs.

646
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:38,300
If I fell down these stairs, I'd be a goner. I'd be dead.

647
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,270
What a waste!

648
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:56,170


649
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,750
When I came home, there was a man in my house.

650
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,740
Richard.

651
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,440
We are the police

652
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,540
Where is he

653
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:11,460
Grabbed him... Do not let him run

654
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:15,570
Stopped and see you where to escape

655
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,700
You like stringing out 12- year - old girls, huh?

656
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,430
What are you doing with my baby?

657
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,570
Your baby's a drug dealer, lady.

658
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,440
Come on, ma'am.

659
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:36,090
What they doing to my baby?

660
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:03,310
It will be crazy here tonight. Did they get a count?

661
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,040
A lot of kids.

662
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,670
They bring them all here?

663
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,010
All coming down here to County.

664
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:36,370
I've come to do those blinds.

665
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,980
I'll get the door.

666
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,550
I'll start in here, huh?

667
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,890
Ok

668
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,880


669
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:37,780


670
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,960


671
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,050


672
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,400


673
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:58,580


674
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,080


675
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:04,020


676
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,340
Let's go over it once more.

677
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,680
What time did he arrive at the house?

678
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,840
About 10:30 in the morning.

679
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,890
- And he was alone? - Yeah, he was alone.

680
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,250
- You got a good look at him? - Yeah, a real good look.

681
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,950
You better be straight with me.

682
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:40,320
This is the guy staying in your mother's basement?

683
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,430
That's what I'm telling you.

684
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,260
Take a deep breath relax

685
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,090
I need a doctor over here!

686
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,890
Watch the bag! Watch the bag!

687
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,710
Notify the parents of young children

688
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,620
Thanks Doctors

689
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,150
It really hurts

690
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:35,260
Hello, Marshal. It's right there.

691
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:04,140
My chest hurts.

692
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,210
Check the film on that kid.

693
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:14,850
Take a deep breath.

694
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,210
Inhale, exhale. Again.

695
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,280
Slowly.

696
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:21,920
Check the film.

697
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:24,930
Take it easy.

698
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,220
X - ray inspection

699
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,540
What's the status on that kid?

700
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:32,070
Possible fractured sternum.

701
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:35,170
Get over here. I need you.

702
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:38,770
Can you help us? Bring this kid to Observation Room Two.

703
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:41,980
Yeah, you. Come on, help us out, okay?

704
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,230
How are you, champ?

705
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,630
My chest hurts.

706
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,330
Does it hurt when you breathe?

707
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:57,390
Yes.

708
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:05,340
- What's your name? - Joel.

709
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,950
Look at this.

710
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,480
We're eating oranges and we're making IDs.

711
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:16,750
"C.C.H." What the hell is that?

712
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,200
Cook County Hospital.

713
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:24,560
Just hang on, okay?

714
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,630
You'll be just fine.

715
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:28,740
Nothing

716
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,510
Hold that elevator.

717
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,010
Thank you.

718
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,480
How about?

719
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,190
My chest hurts.

720
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,460
Where's your mom, pal?

721
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,500
I don't know.

722
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,500
Is she at home?

723
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,390
I think she's with my brother.

724
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:48,920
Your brother? They're downstairs?

725
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,210
I don't know.

726
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,340
Don't worry.

727
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,040
We'll find her for you.

728
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,640
What are you? Football player? Baseball player?

729
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,050
Football.

730
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:02,290
Hold on, son.

731
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,400
Hey, Doctor.

732
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,640
They sent this one from downstairs.

733
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:27,950
Get this one into Room Four, stat.

734
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,450
Bye-bye, Joel.

735
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:45,810
Where's that boy I sent here?

736
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,560
- What boy? - The one with the fractured sternum.

737
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:50,810
He never came through here.

738
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:54,070
- He didn't? - No, he didn't.

739
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,120
Do you have a particular interest in our patient's X - rays?

740
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:05,820
- What do you mean? - I saw you looking at that boy's chest film.

741
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:08,390
- It's a hobby of mine. - It's a hobby, really?

742
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:10,220
What's your other hobby, brain surgery?

743
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:13,490
- What do you want? - To know how that boy got to surgery.

744
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,140
I'm a janitor. I do as I'm told.

745
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,440
That's bullshit!

746
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,210
Who changed those orders?

747
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:20,720
I don't know what you mean.

748
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:26,350
You stay right there.

749
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,650
Call Security!

750
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:40,120
Please

751
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:03,230
Tell Stevens to get hold of that guy Kelly over at C.P.D.

752
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:08,760
A guy disguised as a janitor orders an emergency medical procedure...

753
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:11,040
...and all you did was take away his I.D. card?

754
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:16,170
No, I called Security. He took off down the hall. What was I supposed to do?

755
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,560
Listen, Mr...

756
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:18,790
Deputy.

757
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:20,290
Gerard.

758
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:23,190
I'm really tired.

759
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:25,360
I'd like to go home now.

760
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,130
Okay. How's the boy doing?

761
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:31,120
He saved his life

762
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,080
Thank you.

763
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,280
"Desmondo, Jose Ruiz."

764
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,660
Where're you at, Desmondo?

765
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:53,460
Okay, Sam, this is my problem.

766
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,470
The place is crawling with cops, right?

767
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:59,420
Everybody's looking for Richard Kimble, right?

768
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:01,140
So why would a guy be stupid enough...

769
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:03,450
...to hang out in the trauma ward and play Mother Teresa?

770
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:09,030
Excuse me.

771
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,880
You, guys, have a problem?

772
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,160
No, no. No problem at all.

773
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:37,520
Excuse me, could we have a word with you, please?

774
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,620
This is Dr. Elway at Cook County Hospital.

775
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:51,920
I'm following-up for the prosthetic clinic on Matthew Zelick.

776
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:52,670
Oh, he did?

777
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:55,520
I'm terribly sorry.

778
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:00,130
Right or left?

779
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:00,950
Right.

780
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:05,760
- Age? - 35 to 45.

781
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,710
This is Ted Riley with the High School Reunion Committee.

782
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,030
25 years are right around the corner...

783
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:15,560
...and Clive is on our list of missing in action.

784
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:21,420
The information gave me a number, but when I tried it...

785
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:26,290
No kidding.

786
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:28,200
Armed robbery?

787
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,080
He's where?

788
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,350
Point of attachments?

789
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:32,620
Mid - humerus.

790
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:35,370
That gives us 47 possibles.

791
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,070
47?

792
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:40,280
Cross - check these people for criminal records.

793
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,770
Wait a minute.

794
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:54,190
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.

795
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:34,710
How are you?

796
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,110
How are you

797
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:41,610
Driscoll, Clive R.

798
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:46,360
One - armed man, armed robbery. That's funny.

799
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,580
Question:

800
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:54,790
If they can dye this river green today...

801
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:57,600
...why can't they dye it blue the other days?

802
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,230
How do I know?

803
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,370
- So, what are you Irish, sir? - Who, me? No.

804
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,150
No

805
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,480
Are you?

806
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:07,270
No, man!

807
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,260
Name of inmate?

808
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:20,760
Clive Driscoll.

809
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:22,500
Driscoll, Clive.

810
01:17:22,830 --> 01:17:24,230
I.D., please.

811
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,030
Driscoll, Clive R.

812
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,610
2- 0- 1- 0

813
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:32,880
Be advised that under federal court ruling, your conversation can be recorded.

814

Sign here, please!

815
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:37,650
This is hinky. He is a college graduate. He wouldn't go through all this security...

816
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:43,820
...go to the county lock - up to find someone his own people say doesn't exist.

817
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:44,390
Hinky.

818
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,790
What does that mean, "hinky"?

819
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:47,120
- Strange. - Weird.

820
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,860
Say "strange" or "weird." "Hinky" has no meaning.

821
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,820
Why not say "hinky"?

822
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:53,130
"Hinky" What is wrong?

823
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:56,510
I don't want you using meaningless words around me. I'm taking the stairs.

824
01:17:58,350 --> 01:17:59,110
bullshit!

825
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:02,350
How about "bullshit"?

826
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:05,880
Visitor for Driscoll.

827
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:10,560
Come on, let's go, let's go.

828
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,530
Over there.

829
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:38,130
Let's go, Driscoll.

830
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:46,200
You've got five minutes.

831
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,460
Who the hell are you?

832
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:52,310
Look, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

833
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,070
You got me down here...

834
01:18:54,110 --> 01:18:54,810
...might as well talk.

835
01:18:54,850 --> 01:19:00,820
Down here you got no entertainment. Ain't no cable here.

836
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:05,830
Listen, pal, I wish I could, but I can't. Sorry.

837
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:54,560
Richard!

838
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:03,440
There is a man in a blue coat waving a gun and screaming...at a woman.

839
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:04,140
Stop that man!

840
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:10,250
He's a U.S. marshal! Let him go! Let him go!

841
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:14,050
Close the gates!

842
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,660
Hold it!

843
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:47,590
Open the doors!

844
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,740
We're on the roof.

845
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:02,410
Take some men! Look down there!

846
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,200
Jesus, he's in the plaza, Sam!

847
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:07,250
He's heading east!

848
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,910
He's going east toward the Picasso!

849
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,260
Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you.

850
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:01,380
Deputy Gerard, why do you feel that Dr. Kimble came back to Chicago?

851
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:02,230
I have no idea.

852
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,000
We understand your deputies were at the hospital today.

853
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:07,650
Was Dr. Kimble at the hospital?

854
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:09,440
I don't have any comment on that one.

855
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,380
Let me get the chronology straight.

856
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:14,780
The subject was tried, convicted, incarcerated...

857
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:20,110
...escaped, presumed dead, and is now at large in Chicago. Is that correct, sir?

858
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,990
Except for being presumed dead.

859
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:25,090
Do you believe that Kimble's armed and dangerous?

860
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,260
I believe he's dangerous, yes.

861
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:32,190
He's taking chances, coming back. Do you feel that perhaps he might be innocent?

862
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:36,040
No, he's not innocent. He was convicted in a court of law. He's guilty.

863
01:24:36,110 --> 01:24:38,530
How will you try to catch him?

864
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,950
We have no further comments for now.

865
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,910


866
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,890


867
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:26,170
Alec.

868
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,170
Richard Kimble.

869
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:33,010
- Hi, how are you? - Good, Dr. Kimble.

870
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,140
Lentz!

871
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:39,350
Sorry, we've been trading phone calls the last few days.

872
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:55,410


873
01:28:56,950 --> 01:28:59,240


874
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:01,920
A cruise sponsored by Devlin MacGregor...that could be fun.

875
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:03,950
I wish a happy

876
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,460
- Cancun, Richard. - Sport fishing.

877
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:14,570
Pina coladas.

878
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:16,740
What must the hospital buy? What's the catch?

879
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:17,740
Sailfish.

880
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,540
No, there are no strings attached.

881
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:23,970
So what do you say? So what do you say?

882
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,950
This guy is bleeding from every needle puncture.

883
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:32,960
Lentz sent this guy in? Is he on that wonder drug?

884
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:36,290
Yes, he's on the RDU - 90 protocol, Provasic.

885
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,800
Drug of the future, boys.

886
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:41,160
Clean out those arteries and put us out of business.

887
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:48,900
"Parade Master of Ceremonies Ed O'Flaherty said...

888
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:54,710
"...he didn't recall a livelier parade during the last 20 years.

889
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:55,710
"That Kimble...

890
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,110
"...is some kind of lad..."

891
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:00,750
- "Lad? " - Yeah, "lad."

892
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:05,390
Maybe he's a leprechaun. I'm quoting this guy.

893
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:07,720
Some guy on line three claims he's Richard Kimble.

894
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:10,320
- Who is it? - We got another Kimble on line three.

895
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,100
Let me see that phone.

896
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,340
Tell him he looks good in a beard.

897
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:15,340
- What line? - Three.

898
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,810
"l hope he was able to wear a little green, sip some whiskey..."

899
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,040
This is Gerard.

900
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:24,890
Do you remember what I told you in the tunnel?

901
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,010
It's him!

902
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:29,690
I remember it was noisy.

903
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:32,720
Well, I think you said something like...

904
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,560
...you didn't kill your wife.

905
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:36,370
Remember what you told me?

906
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:39,600
I remember you were pointing my gun at me.

907
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:45,940
You said, "I don't care."

908
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:47,710
He's on the south side.

909
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,150
Yeah, Richard, that's right, I don't care.

910
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,450
I'm not trying to solve a puzzle, here.

911
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,290
Well, I am trying to solve a puzzle.

912
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,760
Five seconds to location.

913
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:59,360
And I just found a big piece.

914
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:01,490
Richard?

915
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,460
Richard?

916
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:08,570
Richard?

917
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,010
Hello, Richard?

918
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:11,740
He didn't hang up the phone.

919
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,350
Where is he?

920
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:15,580
256 South St. Lawrence.

921
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:17,710
Get the C.P.D. right the hell over there.

922
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:20,220
We got a car there now.

923
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:51,890
Get a couple of shots of that.

924
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,730
Fredrick Sykes...

925
01:31:57,310 --> 01:32:02,230
...45, ex-cop, and quite a clotheshorse.

926
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:04,040
You want to look at this?

927
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:08,150
Kimble's prints. They're all over...

928
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:10,120
...but mainly on the desk.

929
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:13,620
He sure had some interest in these photographs.

930
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,790
Negatives in there?

931
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,300
Let me have them.

932
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:20,580
- Camera boy's on his way. - We got you.

933
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,920
How're you doing, Mr. Sykes?

934
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:41,580
- Fine, if you tell me what's happening. - We had a problem.

935
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:45,680
- My place or the place upstairs? - Your place.

936
01:32:45,710 --> 01:32:47,030
Step right in, Mr. Sykes.

937
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:50,790
Everybody knows my name here. Big happy family, huh?

938
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:54,280
What is this, a trench coat convention? What the hell is going on?

939
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:57,310
Who are you guys? What's going on?

940
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,880
You had a break - in, Mr. Sykes.

941
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:05,190
I sure hope you're a cop.

942
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:08,650
No, I'm Samuel Gerard, United States Marshal's Office.

943
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:14,920
This morning a fugitive named Richard Kimble made a phone call from here.

944
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:16,360
Why would he do that?

945
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:18,900
I don't know any Richard Kimble.

946
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:26,850
Okay, I got it.

947
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:28,990
The doctor who killed his wife, right?

948
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:33,950
Keep blaming somebody with a prosthetic limb. Is he coming after me?

949
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,830
Does he have reason to do so?

950
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:39,390
I have a prosthetic arm! I must've done it!

951
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:43,540
Give me a break. I went through all this a year ago.

952
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,610
I was questioned here about the whole thing.

953
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:50,100
I told them I wasn't in Chicago on that night. I was on business trip.

954
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,610
15 people verified it.

955
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,780
What line of business are you in?

956
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:55,280
Security.

957
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:58,070
- Who do you work for? - A pharmaceutical company.

958
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,120
Which one?

959
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:04,670
Devlin MacGregor. I handle security for all the top executives.

960
01:34:04,830 --> 01:34:08,270
Do you have any idea why Kimble would be interested in these photographs?

961
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:10,900
No.

962
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:13,370
Where were they taken?

963
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,420
Gee, that's a big fish!

964
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:16,950
Cancun, Mexico.

965
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:19,920
It was a junket the company paid for some doctors.

966
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:25,600
- Kimble go with you? - You don't see him there, do you?

967
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,390
No. I told you I don't know him.

968
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,140
Do you mind if I look around to see if anything's missing?

969
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:32,830
No, I don't mind.

970
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:41,070
How'd you lose that arm?

971
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:42,770
In the line of duty.

972
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,150
Cosmo, this guy's dirty.

973
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:57,130
Yes, he is.

974
01:34:57,570 --> 01:35:00,980
- You want our people on him? - Yes. Build a camp here.

975
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,560
I'll take care of it.

976
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:08,150
See this picture? I want you to find out who's the guy next to Sykes.

977
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:11,760
Find out his name, his age, his weight, his social security number...

978
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:15,610
...his location, relatives, pets, everything.

979
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,680


980
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:38,470
I am so sorry, Doctor, they said it was an emergency.

981
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,980
Thank you. Excuse me.

982
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:56,140
Mr. Bolton.

983
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:57,840
Chuck.

984
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,170
Richard.

985
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,350
Convenience of the floor?

986
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:05,020
Yes, I'm on a hotel phone. So how are you? What's going on?

987
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:08,380
I found him, Chuck. I found the man who killed Helen.

988
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:10,060
What?

989
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,020
lt was me they were after.

990
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:14,770
Who are they?

991
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,630
Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.

992
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,500
Lentz was supervising the protocol for RDU - 90.

993
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:26,450
He knew I found out it was causing liver damage. It was Lentz.

994
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:29,240
Richard, Lentz is dead.

995
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,880
What? How?

996
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,680
He died in a car accident last summer.

997
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,700
Richard.

998
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,860
Can you prove this about the drug?

999
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:43,900
Yeah, I think so.

1000
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:46,960
I need your help, Chuck.

1001
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:52,080
Call Bones at the hospital. Tell him to give me whatever help I need.

1002
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:53,370
I'll call him now.

1003
01:36:53,550 --> 01:36:55,010
Okay. Thanks.

1004
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,030
Dr. Nichols!

1005
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,900
How are you?

1006
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:06,360
Dr. Nichols!

1007
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:09,100
Can we ask you a few more questions?

1008
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:10,630
Mr. Gerard.

1009
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,970
You got a copy of that photograph?

1010
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,800
U.S. Marshal Service.

1011
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:16,710
Excuse us.

1012
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:21,480
This is Fredrick Sykes.

1013
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,250
He's a security specialist at Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

1014
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:28,190
Richard Kimble broke into his apartment.

1015
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:28,850
Do you know this man?

1016
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,590
No, I don't know him.

1017
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:35,960
You're getting pretty desperate, aren't you, Mr. Gerard?

1018
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,670
Oh, yeah.

1019
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,360
I told you, you wouldn't find Richard.

1020
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:44,540
- Has he been to see you? - No.

1021
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:47,510
We've been over this ground before, haven't we?

1022
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:54,250
- So, if you'll excuse me. - Sure.

1023
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,410
- Thanks, Doc. - Thank you, Doctor.

1024
01:37:56,970 --> 01:38:00,680
Sorry, I want to ask you one more question about the photograph.

1025
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,400
See the guy standing on the right side of the fish?

1026
01:38:04,430 --> 01:38:05,960
Ever see him before?

1027
01:38:06,010 --> 01:38:06,670
No

1028
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,570
This guy right here?

1029
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:11,600
I've never seen that person in my life before.

1030
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:13,770
- Okay. - I'm sorry.

1031
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,010
Thank you.

1032
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:20,280
Thank you, Doctor. Enjoy the rest of the convention.

1033
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:28,340
"Alternatives to Cardio-Non-Invasive Arterial Plaque-Reducing Therapy.

1034
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:31,600
"Keynote speaker, Charles Nichols."

1035
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:34,840
Bet they line up to hear this one.

1036
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:51,830
If you were Richard Kimble...

1037
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:55,790
...why would you hunt for a one-armed man you say killed your wife...

1038
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:59,830
...break into his house, call us up and then split?

1039
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:01,970
I should have been a doctor.

1040
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:06,040
Look at this blow-up. This guy in the picture with Sykes. On his shirt.

1041
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:06,910
Chicago Memorial.

1042
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:09,350
I want to go there.

1043
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:09,940
Go!

1044
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:11,680
Wait.

1045
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:16,590
Devlin MacGregor...

1046
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:24,900
...did 7.5 billion dollars in net sales...last year alone.

1047
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:27,040
That company is a monster.

1048
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:36,980
Yeah, talk to me.

1049
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:42,690
Absolutely.

1050
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,050
It's a liver sample...

1051
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:48,390
...from a patient on the RDU-90 drug study.

1052
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:50,160
21. January 21st?

1053
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:54,240
The last one!

1054
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:55,770
1-7-4-3-0?

1055
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,280
1-7-4-3-0. You got it.

1056
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:02,880
Thanks. I'll make sure all this stuff gets back to you.

1057
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,260
- It's good to see you again. - Good to see you.

1058
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:12,230
So whatever happened to that thing with your wife?

1059
01:40:15,530 --> 01:40:16,970
It's not over yet.

1060
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:39,720
What's going on?

1061
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:41,090
How should I know?

1062
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:58,180
I think his name is Lentz. A pathologist.

1063
01:40:58,210 --> 01:41:00,490
I remember because he died last summer.

1064
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,590
Oh, my God. Richard!

1065
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:14,570
What are you doing here?

1066
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:16,010
Hi, Kath.

1067
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:32,860
Have a look.

1068
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:37,520
- What do you think? - Cold normal.

1069
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,730
Clearly not the same tissue.

1070
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:43,880
And not only did they all come from healthy livers...

1071
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:46,110
...they all came from the same liver.

1072
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,050
Kath, you beauty.

1073
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:58,060
Excuse me.

1074
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:59,520
Mr. Roosevelt?

1075
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:04,790
I am Deputy Biggs, this is Deputy Newman. We're U.S. marshals.

1076
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:08,170
Need some information about a Dr. Lentz who was on staff here.

1077
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:13,470
I want to know if he knew or have had any contact with a Dr. Richard Kimble?

1078
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:15,550
I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.

1079
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:18,150
I didn't ask that.

1080
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:20,720
I wouldn't know.

1081
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,790
If you'll excuse me, I have prior obligations to attend to.

1082
01:42:25,020 --> 01:42:27,510
- Mr. Roosevelt - please say

1083
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:29,500
I think you're lying to us.

1084
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:33,070
You think Lentz is the bad guy?

1085
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:35,610
Yeah, why not?

1086
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:40,710
He was one of the original patent boys in RDU - 90.

1087
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:43,970
I was sending in my tissue samples...

1088
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:48,320
...he was replacing them with healthy samples, issuing the path reports...

1089
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:50,700
...shit - canning my stuff. Easy.

1090
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:52,060
Wait a minute.

1091
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:54,900
Lentz died August 21st.

1092
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:02,820
Half the samples he approved were signed the day he died.

1093
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:04,070
You're kidding.

1094
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:08,640
Someone else must have been manipulating this.

1095
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:10,850
Someone with access.

1096
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,900
Thanks, Kath.

1097
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:25,670
Where're you going?

1098
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,480
To see a friend.

1099
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:35,750
This is giving me a headache.

1100
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:39,960
That's surprising. Where did Roosevelt say Kimble was going?

1101
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:42,150
He says he doesn't know.

1102
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,460
- Do you believe him? - Yes, I do.

1103
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:47,090
He says he was here to pick up some tissue samples...

1104
01:43:47,190 --> 01:43:48,960
...for a drug study.

1105
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:50,540
But listen, get this.

1106
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,870
The release was approved by Dr. Charles Nichols.

1107
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:57,270
Nichols also knew Lentz.

1108
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,340
He was Lentz's boss.

1109
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:01,040
He was covering for Kimble.

1110
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:03,320
Send the C.P.D. over there right now.

1111
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:07,840
We're going to send a bunch of cops. Make sure they turn that place inside out.

1112
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:11,810
Don't let them give you shit about your ponytail either. Well done.

1113
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:12,900
My pleasure, Sam.

1114
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:15,860
Henry

1115
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:17,840
Dr. Nichols lied to me.

1116
01:44:17,970 --> 01:44:19,940
- Go find him. - I'm on it.

1117
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:29,380
He's gone by now.

1118
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:32,990
I looked every place you told me to look and I didn't see him.

1119
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:34,520
I'm telling you.

1120
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,530
If he was in the hospital, I would have found him.

1121
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:39,320
So what do you want me to do?

1122
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:42,600
Hold on. Wait a minute.

1123
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,970
I marked him. I got him now.

1124
01:45:14,210 --> 01:45:16,610
Dr. Alexander Lentz.

1125
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:19,880
"A noted pathologist at Chicago Memorial Hospital...

1126
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:23,610
"...was walking to his daily tennis match when an unidentified vehicle...

1127
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:25,270
"...slammed his body...

1128
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:30,710
"...into the barriers that separate the Drive from Lake Michigan."

1129
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:33,790
Sam, you're not going to believe this.

1130
01:45:34,170 --> 01:45:38,250
Sykes' records for the past two years show no calls to Kimble.

1131
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:39,170
It was a thought.

1132
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:43,120
But when I cross - checked Kimble's phone records, one came up.

1133
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:44,440
Kimble called Sykes...

1134
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:48,350
Get Sykes in here now.

1135
01:45:48,450 --> 01:45:50,080
...on the night of the murder...

1136
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:51,590
...7:30 PM...

1137
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:53,290
...from his car phone.

1138
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:55,890
Do you have the arrest report on Kimble?

1139
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:05,480
- 7:30 PM. - 19:30 hours.19:30

1140
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:07,740
They just went in. Sykes is gone.

1141
01:46:07,810 --> 01:46:10,290
He's now here to be found.

1142
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:11,780
He's gone.

1143
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:26,810


1144
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,730
23 Group's report

1145

Possible sighting of Richard Kimble on northbound El coming into Van Buren.

1146
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:29,280
Move to the door, Doc.

1147
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:40,500
Next Babo Wa Street

1148
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,420
This is my stop.

1149
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:45,490
This is my stop too.

1150
01:47:46,780 --> 01:47:47,580
Richard Kimble

1151
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:47,340
You missed your stop.

1152
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,070
How the car parked in there?

1153
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:10,000
Sam

1154
01:49:10,370 --> 01:49:13,280
A transit cop spotted Kimble on the El, he is heading toward Balbo.

1155
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:14,050
The C.P.D. is on the way.

1156
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:16,080
Chicago Police Department sent to the

1157
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:56,190
Attention all units. Transit police report officer down at Balbo Station.

1158
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:59,330
Kimble is suspect. Repeat officer down.

1159
01:49:59,670 --> 01:50:00,830
What'd he do, shoot a cop?

1160
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:03,000
Chicago P.D. will eat him alive.

1161
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:15,590
It is a joy and a privilege... to introduce tonight's keynote speaker.

1162
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,930
For the past four years...

1163
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:30,400
...he has served as the A. Jude Robinson Fellow...

1164
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:33,610
...and Administrative Chief of Pathology...

1165
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:36,110
...at Chicago Memorial Hospital.

1166
01:50:41,090 --> 01:50:42,720
Where are the emergency exits?

1167
01:50:44,190 --> 01:50:49,130
Suspect seen entering Hilton Tower Mall, lower level. Repeat...

1168
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,920
You don't think...

1169
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:52,400
I know where he's going.

1170
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,060
Biggs, Newman, where are you?

1171
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,430
He was appointed to the Board of Directors...

1172
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:02,310
...of Devlin MacGregor Pharmaceuticals.

1173
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:05,140
You all please give a warm welcome...

1174
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:07,620
...to Dr. Charles Nichols.

1175
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:16,820
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen...

1176
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,970
...my friends and colleagues.

1177
01:51:19,670 --> 01:51:21,870
It's great you're all here tonight.

1178
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,490
C.P.D. reported an officer down and a guy with two guns...

1179
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:40,660
- Kimble do it? - Conflicting reports.

1180
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:42,290
He entered the hotel from the subway.

1181
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,160
- That's my man! - Not anymore.

1182
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,330
He's going down. You can help by staying out.

1183
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:47,740
Arrest us!

1184
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:49,930
Lock it up! Start at the lower level.

1185
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:55,670
All units report when lower level is secure.

1186
01:51:57,990 --> 01:52:00,720
All units, secure all lower level exits.

1187
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:06,790
Go and find the hotel security office. Stay in touch with me on the radio.

1188
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:10,360
Now, a new drug...

1189
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:14,910
...on the cusp of approval by the Food and Drug Administration...

1190
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:18,940
...is poised to change these old methods forever.

1191
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:22,140
Deputy Newman, U.S. Marshal's Service.

1192
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:22,610
Holle

1193
01:52:23,150 --> 01:52:24,450
Sam, I'm in.

1194
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:31,990
...through the normal metabolic pathways in the liver.

1195
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:35,360
The drug's name is...

1196
01:52:35,470 --> 01:52:36,860
...Provasic.

1197
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:40,800
As I will show you tonight...

1198
01:52:41,010 --> 01:52:44,070
...Provasic is remarkably effective...

1199
01:52:44,110 --> 01:52:47,140
...and has no side effects whatsoever.

1200
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:49,840
It is also noteworthy that this drug...

1201
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:56,990
...that this drug was developed...

1202
01:52:57,330 --> 01:53:01,260
...in cooperation, not competition with Chicago Memorial Hospital...

1203
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:02,330
...in what we hope will be...

1204
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,460
...the model for a continued dishonest...

1205
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,170
...excuse me, honest...

1206
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:13,070
...open joint venture...

1207
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:15,270
...between academic medicine...

1208
01:53:15,820 --> 01:53:18,250
...and the pharmaceutical industry...

1209
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:19,620
Richard!

1210
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:24,390
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of this speech.

1211
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,860
You almost got away with it.

1212
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,590
I know all about it.

1213
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:34,000
I can prove it.

1214
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:39,440
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend Richard Kimble doesn't feel well...

1215
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:40,140
...obviously...

1216
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:44,810
...so if you just go on with your dessert and coffee...

1217
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:48,510
Richard, would you step aside and let's talk.

1218
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:55,420
So I'll be back in just a second.

1219
01:53:57,340 --> 01:53:59,700
You changed the samples, didn't you?

1220
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:03,840
You switched the samples...

1221
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:05,600
...after Lentz died.

1222
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,450
Let's stay calm, people.

1223
01:54:11,290 --> 01:54:14,650
After Lentz died, you were the only one who had access.

1224
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:17,950
You switched the samples...

1225
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:20,690
...and the pathology reports.

1226
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:22,370
You killed Lentz too?

1227
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:23,870
Call Security.

1228
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:24,960
Did you?

1229
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:28,470
He falsified his research...

1230
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:32,110
...so RDU-90 could be...approved and...

1231
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:37,080
..Devlin MacGregor could give you Provasic.

1232
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:40,690
All right, it's all over, folks.

1233
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,620
Let's just stay calm.

1234
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:03,210
You never give up, Richard, do you? You never give up!

1235
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:26,340
Why Helen?

1236
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:30,380
Glad you're here.

1237
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:31,510
Which way'd they go?

1238
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:32,740
- Toward the Presidential Suite. - Where's that?

1239
01:55:32,780 --> 01:55:36,380
- Southeast corner. - How many exits are there in this room?

1240
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:41,340
We got a total of four: Two on the east, two on the west.

1241
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:42,930
Kimble's on the roof!

1242
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:45,170
Cosmo, that way.

1243
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:00,350
Stop! Stay where you are!

1244
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:02,720
This is the Chicago police!

1245
01:56:02,930 --> 01:56:04,890
Put your hands in the air!

1246
01:56:05,060 --> 01:56:07,360
The building is totally secure.

1247
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:10,200
I repeat, do not move!

1248
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,700
Put your hands in the air!

1249
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:16,210
I repeat, stay where you are!

1250
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:40,870
Talk to me.

1251
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:43,670
They're headed to the north end of the roof.

1252
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:44,900
Newman!

1253
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,140
Get that helicopter out of here!

1254
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:56,840
As soon as you get a clean shot...you take him out.

1255
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:15,910
Newman, get rid of the helicopter!

1256
01:57:15,950 --> 01:57:18,570
- Why? - Because I don't want to get shot!

1257
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:22,770
C.P.D., there's a U.S. marshal out on the roof. Hold your fire!

1258
01:57:22,930 --> 01:57:25,260
Call off the helicopter!

1259
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:12,460
sam

1260
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:14,190
Don't shoot.

1261
01:58:17,530 --> 01:58:19,330
This guy ever quit?

1262
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:21,420
Find out where that elevator stops.

1263
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:22,440
Newman

1264
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:25,400
Northwest elevator! Where does it stop?

1265
01:58:25,510 --> 01:58:27,630
Where did they go?

1266
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:28,360
Where did they go?

1267
01:58:58,280 --> 01:58:59,980
- Stopped on the 5th floor. - They're on the 5th floor.

1268
01:59:00,010 --> 01:59:02,990
- What's on the 5th floor? - It's the laundry.

1269
01:59:03,030 --> 01:59:06,900
They stopped at the laundry.

1270
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:54,080
We're on the 5th floor. What's your 20?

1271
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:55,790
It's right behind you.

1272
01:59:55,950 --> 01:59:57,920
What the hell is going on here?

1273
01:59:58,020 --> 02:00:01,560
You got to keep the C.P.D. out. They're much too hot to suit me.

1274
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:03,420
I want you to get rid of all these people.

1275
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:04,960
Okay, people, stay calm.

1276
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:07,210
Cosmo, come with me.

1277
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:09,400
Please leave quickly

1278
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:30,790
Dr. Richard Kimble!

1279
02:01:31,770 --> 02:01:33,940
There's no way out of here, Richard!

1280
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:38,010
The entire building is locked down!

1281
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:42,520
Give it up, you don't have any time!

1282
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:46,690
Chicago Police Department thinks you're a cop killer!

1283
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:49,520
They will shoot you on sight!

1284
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:55,090
Richard, I know you're innocent!

1285
02:01:56,740 --> 02:01:59,140
I know about Fredrick Sykes!

1286
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:04,580
I know about Dr. Charles Nichols!

1287
02:02:06,590 --> 02:02:09,750
Richard, he borrowed your car the night of your wife's murder!

1288
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:11,480
He had the keys!

1289
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,730
No forced entry, Richard.

1290
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,930
He telephoned Sykes from your car, Richard!

1291
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:27,440
Give it up!

1292
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:32,750
I'm either lying to you or I'm going to shoot you!

1293
02:02:33,950 --> 02:02:35,420
What do you think?

1294
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:57,800
Give it up! It's time to stop running!

1295
02:03:38,230 --> 02:03:41,130
They killed my wife.

1296
02:03:41,470 --> 02:03:42,940
I know it, Richard.

1297
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:45,570
I know it.

1298
02:03:47,650 --> 02:03:49,110
But, it's over now.

1299
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:53,850
You know, I'm glad.

1300
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:55,710
I need the rest.

1301
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,540
Who killed Kimble's wife?

1302
02:04:12,610 --> 02:04:14,510
Kimble was convicted of it.

1303
02:04:14,780 --> 02:04:17,370
You've got a one - armed man in custody.

1304
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:19,470
- Is that the guy? - I have no idea.

1305
02:04:19,690 --> 02:04:21,410
How many one-armed men are there?

1306
02:04:21,490 --> 02:04:23,120
There're a lot of them.

1307
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:25,220
Could you have made a mistake?

1308
02:04:26,990 --> 02:04:30,060
Armed man captured

1309
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:32,890
I have never worked on so complex case

1310
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:35,830
You got a deadline, play the weather again.

1311
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:36,110
Arrested the wrong person it?

1312
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:41,900
Tell Samuel Gerard I'm going home now. I'm taking my vacation.

1313
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:45,980
Clear this area. Everybody clear.

1314
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:56,020
Kimble

1315
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:05,040
Watch your head.

1316
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:13,270
How about the thing

1317
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:18,420
Where is that key?

1318
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:20,590
Let me see those hands, Doctor.

1319
02:05:39,190 --> 02:05:40,810
I thought you didn't care.

1320
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:42,180
I don't.

1321
02:05:45,190 --> 02:05:46,960
Don't tell anybody, okay?
