1
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,540
- It's already recording...
- Okay.

2
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,540
This is my home...

3
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,460
- You look blurry. I'll zoom out.
- Okay.

4
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,180
Good morning.

5
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,940
- Got it?
- Okay, I got it.

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,460
This is my home,...

7
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,900
...which I am leaving for the weekend...

8
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,660
...to investigate the Blair Witch.

9
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,780
Essential reading: "How to Stay
Alive in the Woods",...

10
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,540
...'cause you never know what's
gonna happen.

11
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,300
And this is an important book...

12
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,660
...because it has the article about what
happened at Coffin Rock.

13
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,540
It looks pretty old...

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,900
It's totally old.
And this is my field notebook.

15
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,580
It's Mr. Punctuality.

16
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,700
How are you this morning?

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,740
Tired.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,340
So I got the CP up.

19
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,180
Good.

20
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,820
That's what we're shooting on.

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,220
No one knows I took it,
but I got it.

22
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,820
Come into the house. Come on.

23
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,700
I can see you.

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,420
We're not gonna bump into shit,
I'm going backwards now.

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,460
We mustn't fuck up the cameras.

26
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,340
So where's Mikey?

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,220
- We have to go get him.
- Okay.

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,300
At 8:30.

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,300
Okay.

30
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,140
We're already behind schedule, but
it's important to have juice.

31
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,100
That's cool.

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,820
I guess you're Mike!

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,340
Wait. Stop.

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,180
Don't we get to meet your Mama?

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,900
See you later, Mom!

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,500
How are you, Mike?

37
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,780
I'm tired but I'm fine.

38
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,340
I'm real excited about this.
Thank you for the opportunity.

39
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,100
I'm very glad. Thanks for
getting the equipment together.

40
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,380
We've got enough
battery power to...

41
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,900
...fuel a small country for a month.

42
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,340
We've got rice, fruit punch...

43
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,620
Oatmeal Raisin, baby.

44
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,740
The ultimate campfood.

45
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,340
Feel how soft.

46
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,500
- Marshmallows...
- Hey, you weasel. Out of my cart!

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,180
Do you believe in ghosts?

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,460
Ever heard of the Blair Witch?

49
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,860
Sounds familiar.
My sister went to Blair High School.

50
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,180
The woods around Halloween
are creepy.

51
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,700
- Can you tell me a little more?
- I don't wanna go cheesy.

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,740
I want to present
this straightforward.

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,020
The legend is unsettling.

54
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,740
Wanna get the...

55
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,860
...ceremonial first slate?

56
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,300
Absolutely.

57
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,420
The first slate for our
first shot.

58
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,540
Should we get our fingers open
and bleed on it?

59
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,300
A little blood-letting?

60
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,820
No, we'll save that for later.

61
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,740
Kiss the slate.

62
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,460
It's the first slate.

63
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,420
Marked by my lipstick.

64
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,100
Mikey, kiss it, good luck.

65
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,220
- There we go.
- Oh, he licked it. Bless him.

66
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,220
Don't eat it. We're gonna need it.

67
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,900
This is Burkittsville,
formerly Blair.

68
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,220
A small quiet Maryland town.

69
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,180
Like a small, quiet town anywhere.

70
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,740
Some 20 families laid roots here
over 200 years ago.

71
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,260
Many remain, either on this hill...

72
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,500
...or in the town below.

73
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,100
An unusually high number of
children are buried here...

74
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,700
...most of whom passed
in the 1940's.

75
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,460
Yet no one here recalls anything
unusual about this time,...

76
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,500
...not to us, anyway.

77
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,700
Yet legend tells
A different story,...

78
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,140
...whose evidence is all around us.

79
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,380
Etched in stone.

80
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,340
We have shot the first scene,
the cemetery scene.

81
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,300
The opening is shot.

82
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,100
We're doing a documentary
about the Blair Witch.

83
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,860
- Have you heard of the Witch?
- That's an old, old story.

84
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,180
As I remember,...

85
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,340
...Mr. Parr was an old hermit,...

86
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,380
...and he lived up on a mountain.
He'd been there,...

87
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,860
...for a long, long, time.

88
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,140
- You heard of the Blair Witch?
- Several times.

89
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,500
What was the first incident?

90
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,180
I've heard stories about it
from people and neighbors,

91
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,420
I also saw a documentary on the
television...

92
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,780
...about her and legends
of Maryland,...

93
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,460
...my grandmother told us the story
to make us go to bed early.

94
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,900
They say if you stay up after dark
or walk around the house...

95
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,540
...the Blair witch will get you.

96
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,860
In the fall or winter of 1940,...

97
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,020
...some young kids
started disappearing.

98
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,860
Nobody knew...

99
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,660
...why they were disappearing.

100
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,860
- A kind of an omen, isn't it?
- The creepiest story about her...

101
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,700
...was that two men out hunting...

102
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,340
...camped near the cabin
she's supposed to haunt...

103
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,220
No. No.

104
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,540
...and they just disappeared
forever.

105
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,140
I'm just telling a scary story,
but it's not true.

106
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,140
It's not true.

107
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,500
One day, old Mr. Parr
came into the market...

108
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,860
...and said "I'm finally finished".

109
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,980
And what did he mean by that?

110
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,740
Nobody knew at first...

111
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,820
But the police finally...

112
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,500
went up the mountain...

113
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,260
...and found the bodies of seven
kids in his house.

114
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,900
He would take the kids down
to the basement in twos...

115
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,260
...and he'd make one
face the corner...

116
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,940
...and he'd kill the other one...

117
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,380
...then he'd kill the one in
the corner too.

118
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,260
Those were the seven kids
that were missing

119
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,300
They brought the kids out of
the woods one at a time...

120
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,580
...it was terrible, it upset
the whole community.

121
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,580
He said he couldn't take
the eyes watching him...

122
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,500
...that's why he made them
face the corner like that.

123
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,460
All my life I've believed...

124
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,220
...in witches and ghosts and
that kind of stuff

125
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,140
Do you believe there are some
in this area?

126
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:38,980
Oh, definitely.

127
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,060
- Do you believe in witchcraft?
- No.

128
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,100
- Are you religious?
- Yep.

129
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,180
Alrighty.

130
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,340
Creepy stuff, but I think
something's happening with her.

131
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,780
And do you think she could
still be up there now?

132
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,660
- I don't go up there.
- You don't?

133
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,140
I believe enough not to go.

134
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,540
They say the woods are haunted
and stuff like that.

135
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,420
What? How are they haunted?

136
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,540
Well there's not many people
who say that it's haunted...

137
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,980
...but there was this old woman,
Mary Brown, who...

138
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,140
Mary Brown?

139
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,340
Yeah, and she was kind of crazy.

140
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,340
How was she seen by the community?

141
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,140
Crazy.

142
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,220
There's the American flag,
it's Mary's house.

143
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,980
I'm gonna bring her out.

144
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,220
You look for the best light, okay?

145
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,980
Okay.

146
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,140
This is Mary's gate.

147
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,740
I'm not even sure how to open it.

148
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,660
And something interesting
happened to you once...

149
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,860
You met the Blair witch?

150
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,420
Yes.

151
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,780
That is really...

152
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,380
...kind of a scary story.

153
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,620
To make ends meet...

154
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,340
...my Dad and I

155
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,700
...used to fish at Tappy's Creek.

156
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,780
In Burkittsville.

157
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,060
I was laying on the leaves...

158
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,620
...watching my pole, and
looking at the sky...

159
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,900
...and suddenly I felt
something near me...

160
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,100
...an eerie feeling...

161
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,700
...It was a woman...

162
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,460
...only on her
arms and hands...

163
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,420
...and everything...

164
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,100
...she had hair...

165
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,060
...dark, almost black hair...

166
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,140
...like a horse...

167
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,660
...like a fur, horse fur.

168
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,140
Then on her arm...

169
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,180
...she had a shawl...

170
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,900
And she scared you,
or threatened you?

171
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,980
She didn't say anything,
she just stared...

172
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,980
...and then she opened her shawl...

173
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,700
What was under there?

174
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,740
She had hair on her
body like a horse.

175
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,140
Hairy from head to toe?

176
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,620
Yeah. And her legs...

177
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,820
- How about her face?
- You could see she was a female.

178
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,780
She was just strange looking.

179
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,860
Thank God she's
not in the film business.

180
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,100
She thinks she is.
She also says she's a ballerina.

181
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,340
Get out.

182
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,260
And she says she's a historian...

183
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,220
I heard that.

184
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,580
...and that she's a scientist
at the Department of Energy.

185
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,820
I fucked up on Mary
with the depth of field.

186
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,660
You measured it in meters?
We're not in Europe.

187
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,180
The fucking lens
has meters on it.

188
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,700
It also has our system.

189
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,060
Nah, it has meters. Look.

190
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,860
But it's an American camera.

191
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,340
All those are meters.

192
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,260
What about the brown ones?

193
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,460
They're feet.

194
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,340
The brown ones are on there, right?

195
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,060
Yeah, but the white
ones are obvious.

196
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,860
- Didn't you use this camera before?
- Yeah. Once before.

197
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,940
How was today, guys?

198
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,740
I learned a lot, man.

199
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,620
About Mary Brown?

200
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,340
No, I learned a lot about...

201
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,100
16 mill?

202
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,940
...about shooting, just
shooting documentaries.

203
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,900
- We kicked some ass today.
- Cheers.

204
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,380
Very good day.

205
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,220
Excellent day.

206
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,620
Very good first day.

207
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,180
Let's do an equipment check,
after I call my mom.

208
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,340
- I got a bag of Utz and a beer.
- We don't need that on film.

209
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,380
So I guess you're covered then.

210
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,020
Could you run it a little
to check it's okay?

211
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,340
Sure.

212
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,220
I just want to check it's loaded
properly so we can shoot...

213
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,100
Okay, that's good, that's good.

214
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,340
That's good, thank you.

215
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,460
Let's relax, because we've got
a long day tomorrow.

216
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,820
Today's been easy.

217
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,540
We're gonna have to do a lot
of hiking, carry a lot of weight.

218
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,100
We're preparing.

219
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,380
Shut up, smartass.
Pour me a shot, please.

220
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,060
- I'm freaking out.
- You can't, you're the director.

221
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,940
I fucking have to do this now,
okay? Do we have any weed?

222
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,300
Here I go.

223
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,700
Drink! Drink!

224
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,300
I hate fucking scotch.

225
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,940
There's my friend Josh.

226
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,580
How are you?

227
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,620
I'm hurtin'.

228
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,620
I'm not ready for that thing yet.

229
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,420
I know you don't like it.

230
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,660
Hello. Welcome to day two.

231
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,060
The trail is along here.

232
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,660
It should be pretty obvious.

233
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,900
You guys heard of
the Blair witch?

234
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,820
I heard the myth. I don't
really believe much in it.

235
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,900
The myth?

236
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,660
That's all I think it is.

237
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,900
What'd you say, sir?

238
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,340
- I said damn fool kids never learn.
- Shut up.

239
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,020
Damn fool kids never learn?

240
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,900
That's what I said.

241
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,340
Why do you say that?

242
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,740
First of all, can I
have your permission...

243
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,580
...to use your image on a
video documentary?

244
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,860
I don't care about that, but...

245
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,780
You have to say yes or no, sir,

246
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,260
- Watch it.
- I'm sorry.

247
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,140
Yeah, sure, okay.

248
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,860
Some girl, in the late 1800's...

249
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,540
...Robin Weaver, I
believe her name was,...

250
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,540
...supposedly wandered
off into the woods.

251
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,740
No "supposedly" about it.
She wandered off!

252
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,780
- Okay, wandered off.
- And got lost.

253
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,020
She got lost.

254
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,140
Wasn't no "supposedly".

255
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,300
Three days later...

256
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,620
...she appears back on her
grandmother's porch.

257
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,300
And everybody's mystified.

258
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,100
- She was babbling something...
- Her story.

259
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,420
Babbling something about...

260
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,100
...an old woman whose feet
never touched the ground.

261
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,420
I saw... just by that
tree up the creek...

262
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,820
...about a hundred yards,

263
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,100
I saw a white misty thing.
Can't tell you what it was.

264
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,340
Like grey vapor rising
out of the trees.

265
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,900
Right out of the water.

266
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,980
Right out of the water?

267
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,460
Up the side of the trees,
Then it disappeared.

268
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,060
You're full of it.

269
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,260
I'm not. And I wasn't
drinking that day, either.

270
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,260
Sure you weren't.

271
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,340
How is that related to the
story of Coffin Rock?

272
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,980
It all ties in to the
story of Coffin Rock.

273
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,780
How's that?

274
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,100
Anybody round here...

275
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,180
...knows that the old woman has
haunted this area for years.

276
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,740
That's bullshit.

277
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,300
These woods are thick.

278
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,100
You excited?

279
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,980
You got it.

280
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,500
I hope he's not shooting a
whole shitload of stock.

281
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,020
I could help, but I'd
rather record.

282
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,940
Okay.

283
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,860
Packs on, we're ready to go.

284
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,820
We gotta go up to the shack?

285
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,740
Yeah.

286
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,620
My God, this is a very heavy pack.

287
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,900
Off to Coffin Rock.

288
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,940
I know exactly where we are now.

289
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,060
Mikey, give me the video camera.

290
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,380
I wanna get her going across, man.

291
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,940
I see a dirty behind.

292
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,900
Good jump.

293
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,700
Thank you.

294
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,500
There it is. See?

295
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,780
That's Coffin Rock.

296
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,540
"They went into the woods
ready to find death...

297
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,660
...but what they found
was inhumane...

298
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,620
...at the site called Coffin Rock.

299
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,300
...up on the rock, the torture...

300
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,700
...suffered by these five
brave men was obvious...

301
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,700
...they were tied up, one man's
hands tied to the next man's feet...

302
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,780
...forming a solid
human structure...

303
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,780
...blood indicated that
it had happened...

304
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,580
...while they were
alive and resisting...

305
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,100
...their intestines had been
crudely torn out...

306
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,180
...and on each of their faces there
was indecipherable writing...

307
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,380
...cut into their flesh
with precision...

308
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,220
...the men, shocked by
what had happened...

309
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,140
...went to find the sheriff...

310
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,540
...without sketching the writing
or touching the bodies...

311
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,660
...they returned to see
vultures at the rock.

312
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,620
But the bodies had been
removed by persons unknown...

313
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,660
...the stench of death
was still thick...

314
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,140
...but the bodies had been
taken in a matter of hours... "

315
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,620
That happened here
at Coffin Rock.

316
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,900
Let's rush, because I want
to camp, and it's 4:52.

317
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,900
It's late. We're gonna be
losing light soon.

318
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,580
But I can use the shot
without me in it...

319
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,780
...because I recorded sound
while reading the whole thing,...

320
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,420
...so I'm sure I can edit
it together somehow.

321
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,940
It's starting to rain.

322
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,580
Did you rent this thing?

323
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,340
Yeah. I don't have a
tent for three people.

324
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,860
Just wondering...

325
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,060
I don't usually travel with two men.

326
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,900
It is pouring with rain.
Can't even light a fire.

327
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,260
Show us what the stick is for.

328
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,100
Look. We've got our
very own leaning post.

329
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,300
If it smells of farts
too much in the night...

330
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,860
Okay, so I can't have a
cigarette in the tent,...

331
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,180
...but he can fart as
much as he wants?

332
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,900
No, I never gave Mike
a fart allowance.

333
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,220
You heard noises last night?

334
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,780
- I did.
- Problem is, I sleep like a log.

335
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,300
There were two separate noises...

336
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,300
...coming from two
areas over here...

337
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,900
...one of them could
have been an owl...

338
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,220
...but the other was a cackling.

339
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,540
No way.

340
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,260
It was a cackling, man.

341
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,780
If I heard a cackling,
I would've shit myself.

342
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,100
Where did we start yesterday?

343
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,820
Off the map.

344
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,220
I knew where we were going.
There was some confusion, but today...

345
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,700
Wait,... say that again.

346
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,020
I said I knew where
we were going.

347
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,100
Wait,... was that a
full of shit statement?

348
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,900
No, it wasn't.

349
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,980
- So that wasn't bullshit?
- I knew where we were going.

350
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,260
You got us lost, man.

351
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,220
For a very short period of time.

352
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,300
Just don't get us lost today.

353
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,100
Yeah, seriously.

354
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,020
No. These places are
very well documented.

355
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,180
You happy with the documentary?

356
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,300
Yes, I am.

357
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,020
I'm very pleasantly surprised
by our little Mikey.

358
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,260
"Our Little Mikey?"

359
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,780
Our Little Mikey...

360
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,540
...a very spirited young man.

361
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,620
What do you think about the
witch? You think she exists?

362
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,540
I don't know.

363
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,300
Heather, I really hope
you find us a trail.

364
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,340
There's a trail up on
this hill. Don't worry.

365
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,420
We like shortcuts, don't we?

366
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,700
We like level shortcuts.

367
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,300
Not mountain shortcuts.

368
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,980
It's the first time we've
seen Mike's chest.

369
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,340
It's really hard to film on video.

370
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,260
He has really sporadic hair
patterns on his chest.

371
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,300
Like symbols.

372
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,900
It's like blank... hairy...

373
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,900
...blank... hairy.

374
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,980
You should see my ass.

375
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,940
Look, here's fucking Uruguay.

376
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,140
- And there's Paraguay.
- Yeah.

377
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,740
I think I see Bolivia.

378
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,540
What killed this
mouse? Witchcraft?

379
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,100
How 'bout God?

380
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,820
Is that the Blair Witch?

381
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,420
No. I think it's Heather,
taking a piss.

382
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,460
You know, I
really have to go.

383
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,060
Ohhh... go!

384
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,500
We're near the cemetery
trail. It should only be...

385
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,500
- What?
- Says who?

386
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,660
Says me, of course.

387
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,220
We should be there
in about ninety minutes.

388
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,660
You guys cool with that?

389
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,100
What?

390
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,300
Ninety minutes?

391
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,020
- If you know where we're going.
- Sure.

392
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,100
Josh wants to look at the map now.

393
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,100
Though I know
where we're going.

394
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,500
If you'd known where
we were, we wouldn't be...

395
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,740
We're in the middle
of the fucking woods.

396
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,380
- How could you possibly know?
- Because some is offtrail.

397
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,100
What, somebody told you
there's a cemetery back there?

398
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,660
If we're lost, admit that, because...

399
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,020
...I know we're not lost.

400
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,420
You knew that yesterday, too,
and twice again today.

401
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,460
Bullshit! We have
not been lost today.

402
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,540
Not once.

403
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,700
Okay, this is where we were.

404
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,340
You said that it was
two miles away.

405
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,380
Then it's two hours away,
three hours away...

406
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,020
- Okay, just chill!
- Maybe it's four hours away.

407
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,900
- You agreed to do this project.
- I agreed to a scouted-out project.

408
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,780
- Not to wander round the woods.
- I told you that...

409
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,260
...getting to the locations
wasn't gonna be easy.

410
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,220
Mike, Mike... Okay, guys!

411
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,500
Please, you're being a smart-ass.

412
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,900
We're looking at the map...

413
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,540
...we'll find this the best we can.

414
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,380
This is where we were. We're
going more or less this way.

415
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,700
Okay, what do you say? Where
do you think we're going?

416
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,580
To tell you the truth...

417
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,380
...this is Greek
to me. It's useless.

418
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,340
Exactly.

419
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,060
So I'm putting my trust in you...

420
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,060
...that you know where it is.

421
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,740
Good.

422
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,380
Though I gotta tell you,
I don't fully trust you...

423
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,420
...and I...

424
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,060
What?

425
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,100
I don't know why you tape
every conversation, man.

426
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,300
Well, we're making a documentary.

427
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,500
Not about us getting lost,
it's about a witch!

428
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,140
I have a camera.

429
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,500
We'll all look back on this
and laugh, believe me.

430
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,900
Baby steps, man, baby steps.

431
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,220
Just breathe and don't look down.
No, you gotta look down.

432
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,740
Are you gonna have to crawl?

433
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,460
I'm gonna crawl.

434
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,180
Cool.

435
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,780
Think how cool the fucking
cemetery is gonna be.

436
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,540
Think of the joy of being
in a really good film.

437
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,540
Okay, shut the fuck up.

438
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,900
Okay, I'm quiet.

439
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,180
Shit. How am I gonna do this?

440
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,420
Okay... Mikey?

441
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,180
Yeah.

442
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,980
Dude, don't come across
with the DAT on your belly.

443
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,060
No way, man.

444
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,460
There's no chance.

445
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,620
How do we get it
across?

446
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,660
It's really fucking hard.

447
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,020
How we gonna get
it across?

448
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,380
The moss this morning was easy.
This stuff's slippery as shit.

449
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,900
Well, how do we get
the DAT across?

450
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,300
I don't know. Let
me put my pack down...

451
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,140
I'll just go back and forth, man.

452
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,300
Can you do it that way?

453
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,900
It's the only thing I can do.

454
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,460
Okay, we'll do it like that.

455
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,700
Oh, Christ!

456
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,700
Oh, what'd you drop?

457
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,540
Nothing.
The tree just broke.

458
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,780
Oh, fuck.

459
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,940
We're very, very close now.

460
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,940
You guys excited?

461
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,940
Okay.

462
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,900
What's this?

463
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,740
What's this? Dude, guys.

464
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,820
Remember what Mary
Brown said the other day?

465
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,100
What story from the
Bible was she telling us?

466
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,500
Fuck, I wasn't listening, I
thought she was crazy.

467
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,780
It was Esau, something about a
pile of rocks.

468
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,980
She was talking
about her rocks, man.

469
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,260
Well, what about
the rocks?

470
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,380
Anybody remember?

471
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,860
To live your life.

472
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,340
Looks like an Indian
burial ground, man.

473
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,460
I don't know if this counts,
three...

474
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,340
...four...

475
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,660
...five...

476
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,660
...six...

477
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,940
...seven.

478
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,820
Years ago witches
were roasted...

479
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,980
...just like my Vienna sausage.

480
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,340
Flames are licking you
like the Devil, Josh.

481
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,820
Sit back and hear a tale,
a tale of a fateful trip...

482
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,220
...that started on
this desert isle...

483
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,220
...aboard this tiny ship...

484
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,420
Yeah, but this ship
has a good captain...

485
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,860
...not a beer-guzzling
guy in a blue shirt.

486
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,620
He wasn't beer-guzzling.

487
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,100
They had no beer on
the island, man.

488
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,140
If they had beer, they'd
have had big-ass orgies.

489
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,540
You're like the Captain,
and Mike's your Gilligan.

490
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,500
- No offense.
- That's all right.

491
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,060
It was a compliment...

492
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,020
...Gilligan was a funny guy...

493
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,340
...the Captain was fat, though.

494
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,700
Well okay, let's call
it a thin Captain.

495
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,380
It's not Captain...

496
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,940
It's the Skipper.

497
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,700
No more Captain.

498
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,140
Here we are back at
the rock again...

499
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,940
...the cemetery deal.

500
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,700
I just wanna be careful
not to get in the shot.

501
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,540
It certainly is odd.

502
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,580
Please tell me you didn't
just knock that over.

503
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,300
I didn't just knock that over.

504
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,380
That's not very nice.
Let me put it back.

505
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,020
You can't be too careful.

506
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,740
What'd you think?

507
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,860
It was the same, only darker.

508
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,020
Yeah, pretty much.

509
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,660
All right. Bag it up.

510
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,380
Hello?

511
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,420
Shit, no light.

512
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,420
We were sleeping.

513
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,500
Do you want this?

514
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,380
Put it by the tent door.

515
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,900
Listen.

516
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,420
Hello?

517
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,020
Hello!

518
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,820
It's all around us.
Fucking weird.

519
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,260
Michael, aren't you
coming down?

520
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,700
I ain't going down there.

521
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,100
Why not?

522
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,940
- Because I don't hear shit.
- You're fucking scared.

523
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,220
Because I don't
hear anything!

524
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,540
You cannot deny hearing it.

525
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,340
Get your ass out! Come on!

526
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,580
This rain fucking blows, man.

527
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,700
I know. It's raining heavily.

528
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,660
Thanks mom for giving me
rain gear for my birthday.

529
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,420
God bless her.

530
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,540
What do you think it
was last night?

531
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,300
Personally?

532
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,980
Yeah.

533
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,260
Someone fucking
with your head.

534
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,180
But nobody knows
we're here.

535
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,740
Yeah, but... you ever see
"Deliverance"?

536
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,580
Well, whatever it was,
I just wanted to...

537
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,860
You were freaking out.
You bugged me out.

538
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,940
I was. I woke up suddenly
and shit's going down...

539
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,660
...and all I can think is
"I want it all...

540
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,460
I want it on sound,
I want it on sixteen.

541
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,260
If we see anything,
I want it on sixteen. "

542
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,660
Sounded to me like a lot
of people running around...

543
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,740
...maybe they were locals
or whatever.

544
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,780
I don't know what
the hell they wanted.

545
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,860
We're deep in the woods, and
if people want to mess with us...

546
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,980
...then there's something
wrong with them...

547
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,540
...and I'm not gonna
get into that.

548
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,820
And if it wasn't people?

549
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,820
Well, I'm not gonna
get into that, either!

550
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,300
Fuck, man...

551
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,940
... it's been a very long day...

552
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,820
...a very wet, very long day.

553
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,980
Nobody's speaking to me
right now.

554
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,060
Dude, I don't remember
any of this.

555
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,020
What?

556
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,820
I don't remember any
of this coming from the car.

557
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,660
We have to go a different
route to get back...

558
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,860
...because we went
around in a curve.

559
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,340
Two more hours max, guys.

560
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,100
If we came by a short cut, why
are we going back a different way?

561
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,780
Because we have to go round...

562
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,740
It was the most direct way to
hit our two locations.

563
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,820
And this is the quickest
way back to the car.

564
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:01,900
Seriously?

565
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,460
Yes. Seriously.

566
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,380
- You know exactly what's going on?
- Yes. Let's just keep going.

567
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,620
All right.

568
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,660
Five minutes and we
do a map check.

569
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,140
All right.

570
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,540
We just did a map check,
and we're still on track.

571
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,780
That's not what I said.

572
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,780
We're all right. Come on,
just keep going.

573
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,260
Well the compass says...

574
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,620
...we go straight ahead,
that way.

575
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,340
We're in the middle of nowhere.

576
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,140
We've been in the middle
of nowhere for two days.

577
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,940
Just like the car.

578
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,660
Look at this shit, man!
This is nothing.

579
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,940
Let's just keep
going, all right?

580
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,220
I think we should camp.

581
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,420
Get the fuck out of here!

582
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,580
Why? 'Cause you don't know
where we are?

583
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,700
No, because we're still
A little way from the car...

584
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,180
...and it's gonna be dark soon.

585
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,740
- Look, I'm not sure...
- We don't camp. Stop the camera...

586
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,940
...and get us home.

587
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,380
Turn the camera off and give
me the fucking map.

588
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,980
Turn it off and get us home.

589
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,180
No, I'm filming. I want
to mark this occasion.

590
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,340
Give me the map.

591
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,340
The map is in my
pocket. Wait a second.

592
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,700
God damn!

593
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,340
If we keep our heads
together, we'll be just fine.

594
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,940
Fucking bullshit!

595
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,140
Mike, chill.

596
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,820
Just relax, Mike.

597
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,020
Don't fucking tell
me to relax!

598
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,500
Let's just sit down,
and check the map...

599
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,620
Yes. Let's do that, please.

600
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,220
Are you happy?

601
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,700
I'm not happy, no.

602
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,340
But the car isn't far. But we
can't find it in the dark.

603
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,180
Are you absolutely sure?

604
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,060
Yes. I'm so sorry. We can still
get the DAT back tomorrow.

605
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,380
We have to...

606
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,780
We will get the
DAT back on time.

607
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,340
And the camera.

608
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,900
We'll get it all
back tomorrow.

609
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,340
I start work tomorrow at nine.

610
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,500
I know.

611
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,620
It's fine. Let's go to sleep.

612
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,820
Let's just fucking camp, okay?

613
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,300
I wanna tape it from
inside the tent.

614
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,700
Whatever it is, it sounds the
same as last night.

615
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,540
Where's my boots? Fuck, it's cold...

616
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,180
Hello?

617
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,740
Shit, it's fucking freezing...

618
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,860
...there.

619
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,900
What?

620
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,140
I hear it.

621
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,100
I don't hear shit.

622
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,460
You hear that?

623
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,340
Shit...

624
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,340
Hello?

625
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,060
I think it's just a deer.

626
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,500
- Could be deer, I guess.
- It's just a deer.

627
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,220
I don't think so, man.

628
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,380
Sounds just like last night.
It's all around us.

629
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,780
It's gotta be just a deer.

630
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,300
It was a deer, man.

631
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,780
It wasn't like last night.

632
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,660
You say something?

633
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,260
Yes! Fucking listen! Let's
get it on DAT... be quiet...

634
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,820
Okay, it's on.

635
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,060
Jesus Christ! What the
fuck was that?

636
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,780
It's not scared by our yelling.

637
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,260
Sounds like footsteps.

638
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,420
I know! It's a fucking person!

639
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,060
I don't see shit on video.
We'll just use DAT, right?

640
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,060
But I'm staying out.

641
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,540
You stay out here with me.

642
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,740
I am. I am.

643
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,820
What time is it? Anywhere
near morning?

644
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,380
Let me see...

645
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,020
Tell me it's five
O'clock or something.

646
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,180
Three.

647
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,140
Fuck!

648
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,620
Bullshit. This is
fucking crazy.

649
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,860
I'm sorry, Mike. We should
be home already.

650
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,020
This has got nothing to do...

651
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,780
...with what we're here for.

652
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,780
This is just it's bullshit.

653
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,540
Woke up this morning,
two seconds ago...

654
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,740
...and there are piles of
rocks outside our tent.

655
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,140
There are three, actually.

656
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,580
Are you positive those
weren't there last night?

657
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,540
I am fucking positive
they weren't here!

658
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,060
How could we have
just camped...

659
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,420
...between three piles of rocks
just by coincidence?

660
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,740
You don't think this is strange?

661
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,660
It is fucking weird, but
I really don't care...

662
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,300
...because all I want to do
is get to the goddam car.

663
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,460
Whatever it is,
man, right now...

664
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,540
...we have to get back to the car.

665
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,500
They obviously don't want us
Here, so let's get out.

666
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,060
We have to get the DAT back.

667
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,540
- That's what I mean.
- Okay, let's go.

668
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Let's pack our shit up
and just walk.

669
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,860
Can we just walk?

670
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,940
Yes, we're out of here.

671
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,940
Okay, cool.

672
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,940
But we're leaving just
when it's all happening.

673
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,020
Put the fucking camera down.
Let's pack up the tent.

674
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,300
- Let's get out of the woods.
- Okay, hang on.

675
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,860
Come on!

676
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,900
No, I'm not scared!
I'm just tired and hungry...

677
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,100
I'm just fucking done, man.

678
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,180
All right.

679
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,220
Did you take it?

680
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,260
No, I didn't take the fucking map.

681
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,300
I'm not playing head games.

682
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,540
You're the one playing
head games.

683
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,100
But I'm not.

684
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,620
I don't have it. We have to go.
I'm serious, I don't have it.

685
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,780
Are you fucking serious?

686
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,900
Fucking serious. I don't have it.

687
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,060
Heather, that is not so cool, man.

688
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,900
I know it's not cool!

689
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,780
It's the fucking least
responsible thing...

690
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,300
...you could have done, man.

691
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,140
I know that.

692
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,900
You really don't have it?

693
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,300
One of you must have the map.

694
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,780
No, I don't have the map.
We gave it back to you...

695
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,940
...after map check yesterday.

696
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,940
I always keep it in the
same place...

697
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,020
...and if it's not there,
one of you must have it.

698
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,340
I did not get the goddam map
out of your fucking pants, man.

699
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,500
Well, I don't have it!

700
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,940
Look, why would I take it?

701
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,380
I just wanna get out
of here, man.

702
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,500
Me too.

703
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,500
Let's go!

704
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,940
No, you wanna stay and
film rocks, look around...

705
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,740
Let's go!

706
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,020
...you wanna film this and that...
Which way?

707
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,820
That way.

708
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,740
We're in the
middle of the woods!

709
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,100
We can walk any way!

710
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,420
This way! Because we've
been going this way all day.

711
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,300
We're going this way!
We gotta find something!

712
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,420
I gave you back the map!

713
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,260
I gave you the map.

714
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,580
I gave you back the map!

715
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,860
- Let's just go.
- We can move as fast as we want...

716
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,740
...but there's no point if we have
no idea where we're going.

717
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,140
We're following the creek.
Mike seems happy with that.

718
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,500
Would you guys stop it?

719
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,100
We are fucked, we are done...

720
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,580
...we are dead, we are fucked.

721
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,220
I'm staying here. When you
find someone...

722
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,540
...tell them I'm under the
tree with the vine.

723
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,180
All blame aside...

724
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,580
...this is really fucked up.

725
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,020
I know.

726
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,820
We really need to work together.

727
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,060
- I realize that.
- Exactly. Exactly.

728
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,300
So we accept the fact that my
camera's not gonna be back...

729
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,660
...or your DAT.

730
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,380
No blame from now
on about that shit.

731
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,540
Look, seriously...

732
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,860
...this area's not that fucking big.

733
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,740
Exactly. It's very hard to get
lost in America these days...

734
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,820
...and even harder to stay lost.

735
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,860
What?

736
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,060
Well, we're doin' a pretty good
job of being lost.

737
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,900
If you're not home today,
and I'm not home today...

738
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,660
...people are gonna notice...

739
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,580
...My girlfriend's definitely
gonna notice...

740
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,700
...and she'll notice that
I haven't called.

741
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,460
...that I didn't get back and
I didn't call...

742
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,260
...so if by tonight we
haven't found shit...

743
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,020
...someone's gonna be looking for us.

744
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,060
Oh, no!

745
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,940
Not down here, go another way...

746
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,180
...I just got my whole shit wet.

747
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,420
Shit. Well, let's try it this way.

748
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,980
No, not this way...

749
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,140
...better try the other way.

750
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,340
- If we didn't have these packs...
- I don't mean to laugh...

751
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,540
Your feet are wet!

752
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,340
Is Michael laughing?

753
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,460
Shut up and cross the stream.

754
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,300
He's laughing...

755
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,300
...that's the first time
you've laughed in days.

756
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,460
I'm happy you
find it amusing...

757
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,860
...that I'll be uncomfortable
for the rest of the day.

758
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,660
Dude, uncomfort does not even...

759
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,860
Can we keep going, please?

760
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,260
No, we're gonna chill out!

761
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,900
- Didn't you want to get to the car?
- Oh boy!!

762
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,860
Okay, come on... let's get up here.

763
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,060
Oh shit.

764
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,660
You weren't lying to me about
the map, were you?

765
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,540
'Cause to me it seems like you're
having a little too much fun.

766
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,500
- Oh, Heather...
- We're going a little stir crazy.

767
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,700
Heather! If you make me
yell at this point...

768
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,660
...don't make me
yell at you, man.

769
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,260
Seriously, if you got the map, I
just wanna know you have it!

770
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,700
That would make me happy,
just to know you have it.

771
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,660
If I knew that, and I could see
it, I'd feel much better.

772
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,460
We're just trying to
be cool with you.

773
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,900
So I get laughed at 'cause
my shoes got wet.

774
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,420
It's fucking hilarious.

775
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,260
All our shoes are wet...

776
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,780
...we were laughing
at the situation.

777
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,660
Fine.

778
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,740
We're fucking hungry
and fucking tired...

779
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,580
- ...what the hell else can we do?
- You know what?

780
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,100
I'm sorry, it's fucked up...

781
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,860
...but I kicked that map into the
creek yesterday.

782
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,860
It was useless and I kicked it
into the creek!

783
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,540
I fucking hope he's kidding.

784
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,780
Mike?

785
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,860
I really fucking hope he's kidding.

786
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,940
Mike, are you fucking kidding?

787
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,740
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

788
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,220
You're kidding me. You have
gotta be fucking kidding me!

789
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,260
- You think it's a game?
- Get off me!

790
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,380
What the fuck?
Are you out of your mind?

791
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,860
No, I'm not. That map
wasn't doing shit!

792
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,180
Not for you, but I knew what
the fuck the map said!!

793
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,180
I'm sorry!

794
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,100
You're a fucking asshole!

795
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,140
I'm sorry.

796
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,620
You're a fucking asshole!

797
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,020
That map was useless!

798
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,900
If we get hurt or die here,
it's your fucking fault!

799
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,340
You understand?

800
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,100
How could you be
such an asshole?

801
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,540
- What were you thinking?
- You are fucking me up here!

802
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,580
I am not! That map
was useless!

803
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,780
It was useless to you!

804
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,060
Okay...

805
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,540
I didn't bring you out
here for this, man.

806
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,100
Sorry about the map, man.
What can I say?

807
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,140
- The map wasn't doing shit.
- Just don't say sorry.

808
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,780
It wasn't worth
shit to you.

809
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,780
I knew exactly where
we were!

810
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,700
Listen! Yesterday I asked you what
fucking river we were on...

811
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,100
Shut up or else.

812
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,780
Turn the fucking camera off!

813
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,980
Give me the compass...

814
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,580
...you have betrayed us...

815
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,900
...way fucking beyond.
Give me the compass.

816
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,380
So have you for not getting
us out of the woods.

817
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,740
Yeah, thanks.

818
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,980
Can I have the fucking compass?

819
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,260
No. I bought the compass.
If you wanted one...

820
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,900
...you should've
bought your own.

821
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,820
You and he both fucked us up.

822
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,660
Why can't you admit that...

823
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,180
- ...you fucked up from the start.
- Let's just walk south.

824
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,500
Because I haven't!

825
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,340
Why are we stopped?

826
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,620
Why are we stopped?

827
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,580
Just don't.

828
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,780
I'm just asking
Why we stopped.

829
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,180
Weren't we going south?

830
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,180
We all seemed very
Happy with that.

831
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,740
Why don't we carry on like that?

832
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,660
What?

833
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,900
There's all sorts of
Stuff down here!

834
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,300
What kind of stuff?

835
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,100
Voodoo shit!

836
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,060
What?

837
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,140
- Hanging all over the place!
- No way...

838
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,140
It's all over.

839
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,180
Holy shit...

840
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,620
Come up quick! I need the CP!

841
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,460
There's all sorts
Here, man!

842
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,660
This is fucking crazy shit.

843
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,460
Please, I gotta film this!

844
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,820
Take the fucking camera.

845
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,620
What the fuck is this?

846
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,020
I have no idea.

847
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,660
Jesus Christ, that's fucking creepy.

848
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,460
This is no redneck.
No redneck is this creative.

849
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,660
Can we go now?

850
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,180
Yeah, please.

851
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,300
Okay, I got everything on video.

852
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,140
Oh, Jesus Christ, I didn't
Even see these!

853
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,460
Okay, Heather, you got
Enough, man. Let's go.

854
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,060
- That's enough! Stop taping!
- That's enough!

855
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,980
- Okay, we're going right now.
- Let's go!

856
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,740
Okay, we're out of here.
I'm leaving.

857
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,260
Come on, turn it off!

858
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,460
Help!

859
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,300
Please help us!

860
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,740
We won't get out of here like that.

861
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,900
Fuck!

862
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,860
Fuck!

863
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,860
I think I can say
that we're now lost.

864
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,260
I don't know what to do.

865
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,700
We should all get
Inside the tent.

866
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,900
All right.

867
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,060
Let's not light a fire tonight.

868
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,700
Yeah, that's my thinking.

869
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,940
- That's a good idea.
- We didn't light one the first night.

870
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:04,940
And nothing happened.

871
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,980
We light fires, and they know.
No one was following us.

872
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,740
We should turn that light off, too.

873
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,980
All right.

874
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,820
Seriously, anything
could attract them.

875
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,580
Let's just go to sleep.

876
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,500
Oh God.

877
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,220
Put this out.

878
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,860
Jesus Christ, little kids. Oh, God!

879
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,500
I'm gonna put my jeans on.

880
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,420
Take the video camera.
No, the DAT.

881
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,940
I'm gonna get this on video.

882
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,700
Oh, dear God, dear God!

883
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,540
Go, fucking go!

884
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,420
Oh God!

885
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,780
Oh God!

886
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,060
Hurry up!

887
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,020
I'm coming! My boots aren't laced!

888
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,980
Oh my God, what the fuck is that?

889
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,460
What the fuck is that?

890
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,660
Oh, shit!

891
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,100
Mike, where are you, man?

892
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,700
Turn the lights off...

893
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,580
...turn that light off.
turn it off, Josh.

894
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,300
All lights off,
all lights off.

895
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,580
I'm soaking.

896
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,780
That's okay.

897
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,540
What was that?

898
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,420
What the fuck is going on?

899
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,380
You hear that baby screaming?

900
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,020
Shut the fuck up. There's
no fucking baby.

901
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,060
- Yes there was.
- There was no fucking baby.

902
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,660
I haven't heard anything
since we ran away...

903
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,780
Oh my God, it's cold.

904
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,700
We should be quiet, okay?

905
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,420
I don't hear anything anymore.
Let's go back.

906
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,140
How long have we been here?

907
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,980
I don't know, man, an hour...?

908
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,100
The sun's up. We're okay now.

909
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,140
Let's just get back,
pack up, and go.

910
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,500
Okay.

911
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,860
What the fuck, man?

912
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,900
Where's my pack?

913
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,860
Right there. Where's mine?

914
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,900
What the fuck, man?

915
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,980
Why're they fucking
with us like this?

916
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,340
They just opened it up.

917
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,420
They spilled all my water!

918
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,220
Looks like slime, man.

919
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,180
It's just water, man.

920
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,100
It is slime. What the fuck is it?

921
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,900
Let's get out of here.

922
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,460
- Heather, turn that thing off!
- Let's go.

923
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,460
Okay.

924
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,540
I'm not interested
anymore! Let's go!

925
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,620
I know.

926
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,980
So turn it off.

927
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,980
Relax. Have we got everything here?

928
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,980
- Like I give a shit.
- Whose bag was opened?

929
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,300
It was mine!

930
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,700
Why you?

931
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,940
Are you not scared enough yet?

932
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,820
But why you?

933
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,060
Put it down. This is not funny.

934
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,620
Am I laughing at all?

935
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,940
No, but you're still doing
your documentary thing, man!

936
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,500
Still your fucking documentary!

937
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,380
- Don't touch it!
- Then turn the goddam thing off!

938
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,140
If you bite me again,
I'll throw you in river.

939
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,500
- Don't touch my camera.
- Turn it off!

940
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,580
I'm sorry.

941
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,180
I didn't mean it, okay?

942
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,220
You all right?

943
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,940
Yeah. I wanna go home...

944
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,940
...but I wanna get
what we can.

945
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,500
What the fuck...?

946
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,060
Is this possible?

947
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,500
All right.

948
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,460
Here I go.

949
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,020
I hate crossing streams on logs.

950
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,300
If I never cross another stream...

951
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,180
...on a log, I'll die happy.

952
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,420
I see why you like the
video camera so much.

953
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,700
You do?

954
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,660
It's not quite reality.

955
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,140
Reality says we gotta move.

956
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,340
But it's a totally filtered
reality, man.

957
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,180
As if everything's
not quite the way it is.

958
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,820
Just leave him alone awhile

959
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,100
We need to go.

960
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,660
Leave him for five minutes.

961
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,300
Leave him alone. Five minutes.

962
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,140
Come on, he's lost it.

963
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,620
I know, but we've all
nearly lost it.

964
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,700
I know, but we got
to look after each other.

965
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,900
And we're not looking after him...

966
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,020
...if we film him
while he's crying.

967
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:50,940
I know.

968
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,420
I know you know.

969
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,980
Let's try and keep our wits.

970
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,460
But we have to go.

971
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,900
Sure. Believe me, I know.

972
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,700
It's hard to stay calm.

973
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,900
- We need to get out.
- I know.

974
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,500
You're not telling me
anything new,

975
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,220
Just let him calm down.

976
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,740
Anybody got a cigarette?

977
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,700
No, man.

978
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,180
No, there's none left.

979
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,860
Nobody has any cigarettes?

980
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,060
We're out.

981
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,700
Why the fuck...

982
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,580
...was this blue jelly
shit on my shit?

983
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,860
Let's go.

984
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,660
Let's go.

985
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,780
If we keep going south,
we'll get out.

986
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,820
Please...

987
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,780
I don't wanna camp
another fucking night.

988
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,260
Josh, none of us do.

989
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,340
I know you don't.

990
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,660
Whoever it is, is gonna come
back, and that's a fact.

991
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,980
It's not a fact.

992
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,020
It came three nights running,
and it's worse every night.

993
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,700
Just what I need to
hear right now.

994
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,220
I'm just trying to
rationally say that...

995
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,740
...with our walking speed,
they might just go on forever...

996
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,820
Not possible in this country.

997
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,380
Why not?

998
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:06,060
Because we've destroyed most
of our woods in America.

999
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,420
- Let's just keep going.
- America, America...

1000
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,060
...God shed your grace on thee...

1001
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,860
...Once so proudly we hailed...

1002
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,940
...at twilight's last gleaming...

1003
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,820
That's the tree we crossed.

1004
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,980
That tree is down. Same one.

1005
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,940
Oh God!

1006
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,460
Oh no...

1007
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,220
You got to be kidding,
this is a joke!

1008
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,700
It's not funny!

1009
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,660
Mike, please stop...
please stop...

1010
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,860
Oh no!

1011
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,460
No, Mike, it's not the same log!

1012
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,980
- Same log!
- Look, it's not!

1013
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,940
Yes it is! Open your eyes!

1014
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,060
It's not the same log...

1015
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,140
It's the same log.

1016
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,180
Fuck you, God!!

1017
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,700
It's the same log.

1018
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,260
Okay, it's okay.

1019
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,820
Where do you wanna camp?

1020
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,580
Going south didn't work.
Tomorrow we go east.

1021
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,740
I don't know what to say, Josh.

1022
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,340
How the fuck did we wind
up in the same place?

1023
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,420
We walked south
all fucking day!

1024
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,580
I don't know how we
ended up here!

1025
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:07,460
Do you expect me to do,
or say something?

1026
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,700
What do you wanna do?

1027
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,020
Josh?

1028
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,620
I wanna make movies, Heather.

1029
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,860
Isn't that why we came?

1030
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,660
Let's make some movies.

1031
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,380
Fuck you.

1032
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,460
Fuck you.

1033
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,660
Let's not fight, please?

1034
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,420
...I can't take it.
I can't fight.

1035
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:55,300
We're screwed, and that's it.
Please stop fighting.

1036
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,860
I'll do the first watch.

1037
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,460
I got first watch.

1038
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,100
It's not the time or place, guys.

1039
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,020
We have things to prepare for.

1040
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,820
Okay, here's your motivation...

1041
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,220
...you're lost, you're angry and
no one's here to help you...

1042
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,700
...there's a fucking witch who
keeps leaving shit around...

1043
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,260
...no one can help you...

1044
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,820
...she left little trinkets, and
you fucking took one...

1045
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,500
...she's chasing us. And
no one can help you!

1046
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,380
We walked fifteen hours today...

1047
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,660
...and we ended up in the same place!

1048
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,140
There's no one to help you!
That's your motivation!

1049
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,260
Please stop.

1050
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,700
Josh, quit it. She's had enough.

1051
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,740
You got her back. Good one.

1052
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,340
No, she's still making movies!

1053
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,420
- Please stop.
- Still making movies.

1054
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,380
It's all I have left, okay?
Just please stop.

1055
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,420
Please stop yelling at me.

1056
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,900
I'm fucking tired of
crying all day.

1057
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,660
We gotta think like human beings.
We got things to do.

1058
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,380
We've gotta do shifts.
We got lots to do.

1059
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,540
You gonna write us a
happy ending, Heather?

1060
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,780
Come on, turn it off.

1061
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,580
You're getting like she was.

1062
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,260
I don't know how you can
sew at this point, man,

1063
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,220
Well, I'm cold.

1064
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,660
- I know.
- I hear you.

1065
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,220
The smallest comforts
we can get are good.

1066
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,940
Doesn't it seem absurd,
though, at this point?

1067
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,180
Yes, it does.

1068
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,540
Lots of things seem absurd.

1069
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,180
Like sleeping where we were
last night is freaking...

1070
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,460
It's just fucking me up, period.

1071
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,500
Really fucking me up, man.

1072
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,260
- I'm sorry, man.
- Me too. It's all right.

1073
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,020
I'm sorry, Heather.

1074
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,700
It's all right.

1075
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,180
Who wants a cheeseburger?

1076
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,100
I do, I do...

1077
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,260
I got a cheeseburger in my pocket.

1078
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,860
Do you? Can I have a
light to cut this?

1079
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,060
Know what I'd fucking love?

1080
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,340
What?

1081
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,820
Mashed potatoes.

1082
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,100
Me too.

1083
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,020
My mom's mashed potatoes.

1084
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,340
You'll have them again very soon.

1085
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,820
Mashed potatoes
and a piece of ass.

1086
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,500
Josh?

1087
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,700
Fuck, we never go out of earshot!

1088
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,620
Come on, calm down.

1089
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,420
How can I?

1090
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,100
He's probably at the river.

1091
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,540
If he was there,
he could hear me.

1092
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,860
Wait for him to respond.

1093
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,540
Remember what he said yesterday?

1094
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,940
What?

1095
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,700
About the shit on his bag.

1096
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,220
Let's go. We've gotta find
him. Come on.

1097
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,100
If we can't even find the car,
how are we gonna find Josh?

1098
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,260
Come on.

1099
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,060
No, I'm fine.

1100
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,900
Come on, come on, relax.

1101
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,540
All right, let's take
down the tent...

1102
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,380
...and when he's back, we'll go.

1103
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,420
I'm losing my mind, Mike.

1104
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,220
Josh hasn't come back.

1105
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,100
Heather?

1106
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,540
I'm here, Mike.

1107
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,340
I don't know if Josh ran off.

1108
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,220
All his shit's here.

1109
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,300
I've got the camera...

1110
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,780
...I don't know how I'm
gonna hike with the camera.

1111
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,300
Sure you wanna take it?

1112
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,580
We have to take the camera.

1113
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,220
How do you feel about east?

1114
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,660
How do you feel about east?

1115
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,500
Well, south didn't work.

1116
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,820
Which witch was worse, the one
from the east or from the south?

1117
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,220
The witch of the
west was the bad one.

1118
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,940
Let's go east.

1119
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,700
What the hell is that?

1120
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,060
Josh?

1121
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,780
We'll have to put up the tent.

1122
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,180
I'd like a meatball.

1123
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,780
Just one meatball?

1124
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,020
And a big glass of red wine.

1125
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,140
Yeah, I would like a whole
fucking bottle of Bordeaux.

1126
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,020
And a pack of smokes.

1127
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,820
That'd be good.
and a long, hot bath.

1128
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,420
And a big pumpkin pie.

1129
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,340
A pumpkin pie with ice cream?

1130
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,900
Warm with milky ice cream?

1131
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,300
Yeah, sounds good.

1132
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,020
What do you like
to do on a Sunday?

1133
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,020
I used to like to drive to the
woods and go hiking.

1134
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,420
But I think that might change now.

1135
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,660
I think you could scratch that.

1136
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,140
Should we open the door?

1137
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,900
Is it a trick?

1138
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,140
Josh!

1139
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,980
Josh!

1140
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,340
Where's it coming from?

1141
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,940
Josh, where are you?
Tell me where you are!

1142
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,420
Oh my God, no.

1143
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,580
Do you think that's them again?

1144
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,220
Is it over here?

1145
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,060
No, it's over here.

1146
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,500
We'll look for him.

1147
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:41,220
I don't know if it's really him.

1148
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,140
I don't even know where to look.

1149
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,220
Tell me where you are, Josh!

1150
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,100
Mike?

1151
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,380
- What?
- Please don't fall asleep.

1152
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:09,940
I can't fall asleep.

1153
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,940
Whatever it is, it
knows Josh has gone.

1154
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,100
If that was Josh, he would've
said where he was.

1155
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:31,620
Whatever it was, it
sounded like Josh.

1156
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,580
See?

1157
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,340
I just want to show you
that Mike's here.

1158
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,300
There. He's sleeping.

1159
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,140
Oh, shit.

1160
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,180
What the hell is that?

1161
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,140
- Mike.
- What?

1162
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,580
There's something out here.

1163
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,860
Okay,

1164
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,380
I'm gonna move it
from in front of the tent.

1165
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,420
- Get rid of it.
- Okay.

1166
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,620
I'm taking it away
from the tent.

1167
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,580
I'm just throwing it.

1168
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,700
We'll just keep walking, okay.

1169
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:34,940
Okay.

1170
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,500
I found some cigarettes
at the bottom of my pack...

1171
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:45,220
...so if we're smoking,
we're still alive.

1172
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,100
It's all full of blood.

1173
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:16,940
Shit, shit, shit!

1174
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,300
Oh my God!

1175
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,740
Okay, see...?

1176
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:40,980
Yeah?

1177
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,580
What are you doing?

1178
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,740
Just washing my hands!

1179
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:46,660
What?

1180
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,300
Just washing my hands!

1181
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,180
I'm fine.

1182
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,380
I'm gonna put my gloves on.

1183
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:02,700
You all right?

1184
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:06,540
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1185
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,980
You need help?

1186
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,180
No, I don't need any help.

1187
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,380
I'm okay.

1188
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,180
What happened?

1189
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:19,540
Nothing. I'm just very
hungry and very tired...

1190
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:22,140
...and very scared, and I just
wanna go home, okay?

1191
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,060
Okay.

1192
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,100
But I'm fine, and we're okay.

1193
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,180
Ow! My hair's caught.

1194
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,500
Thank you, thank you.

1195
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,940
Okay, okay.

1196
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,300
Two thousand one
hundred thirty games...

1197
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,460
...one more season and
Cal Ripken is king!

1198
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,740
And I won't see it...

1199
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:41,860
...because I'll be in the woods.

1200
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,740
Tell me you're not
eating a dry leaf.

1201
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,980
I just want to apologize...

1202
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,180
...to Mike's mom...

1203
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,860
...and Josh's mom...

1204
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,420
...and my mom...

1205
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,660
...and I'm sorry to everyone...

1206
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,820
...I was very nave.

1207
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,660
I am so, so, sorry...

1208
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:40,500
...for everything that's happened...

1209
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,540
...because in spite of
what Mike says now...

1210
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,900
...it was my fault...

1211
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,180
...because it was my project...

1212
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,740
...and I insisted...

1213
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,100
...insisted on everything.

1214
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:58,700
I insisted we weren't lost...

1215
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:02,660
...I insisted we keep going...

1216
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:05,900
...I insisted we walk south.

1217
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,060
Everything had
to be my way.

1218
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,500
And this is how we've ended up.

1219
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:16,780
And it's all because of me
that we're here now...

1220
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,380
...hungry and cold...

1221
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,220
...and hunted.

1222
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,820
I love you, mom...

1223
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,140
...dad...

1224
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,660
...I am so sorry.

1225
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,060
...what was that?

1226
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,540
I'm scared to close my eyes...

1227
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,300
...and scared to open them.

1228
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,580
Oh God...

1229
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,940
...we're gonna die here.

1230
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,340
- You got it?
- You ready?

1231
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,660
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1232
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:33,780
You ready?

1233
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,820
Here, take this light.

1234
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,300
That can't be him.

1235
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,180
Holy shit, it's a house.

1236
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:26,100
- Watch your step.
- Holy shit, Holy shit...

1237
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,180
Josh?

1238
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:03,660
Mike. Mike.

1239
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,140
Come on.

1240
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,740
Mike, where the fuck are you?

1241
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:10,820
Come on, I'm in the house!

1242
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,740
Mike, don't go in there, please!

1243
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:35,180
Mike, please!
Mike, where are you?

1244
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,420
I'm right here!

1245
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,420
Where is he?

1246
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,420
Mike, please don't.

1247
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:56,500
Is he in here?

1248
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:57,540
No.

1249
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,660
Oh, Jesus.

1250
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,020
Where is he?

1251
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,940
Are you gonna go upstairs?

1252
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:20,860
I hear him. I hear him.

1253
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,140
I hear you. Josh!

1254
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,860
I'm going upstairs.

1255
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:39,260
Oh, God, oh.

1256
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:44,780
Hear that?

1257
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,820
Where is he?

1258
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,780
Where are you?

1259
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:53,060
Come on!

1260
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,620
I'm getting downstairs.

1261
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:02,260
Come on, I hear him, downstairs!

1262
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:04,100
Mike!

1263
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,140
Come on!

1264
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:06,020
Mike!

1265
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:06,980
Josh!

1266
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:08,380
Wait!

1267
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,540
Josh, is that you down there?
