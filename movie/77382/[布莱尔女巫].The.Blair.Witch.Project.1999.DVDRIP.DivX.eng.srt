1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:10,000
 

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 

3
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,680
 

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,040
 

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,920
 

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,520
 

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,040
- It's already recording...
- Okay.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,040
This is my home...

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,960
- You look blurry. I'll zoom out.
- Okay.

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,680
Good morning.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,440
- Got it ?
- Okay, I got it.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,960
This is my home,...

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,400
...which I am leaving for the weekend...

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,160
...to investigate the Blair Witch.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,280
Essential reading: "How to Stay
Alive in the Woods",...

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,040
...'cause you never know what's
gonna happen.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,800
And this is an important book...

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,160
...because it has the article about what
happened at Coffin Rock.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,040
It looks pretty old...

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,400
It's totally old.
And this is my field notebook.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,080
It's Mr. Punctuality.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,200
How are you this morning ?

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,240
Tired.

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,840
So I got the CP up.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,680
Good.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,320
That's what we're shooting on.

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,720
No one knows I took it,
but I got it.

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,320
Come into the house. Come on.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,200
I can see you.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,920
We're not gonna bump into shit,
I'm going backwards now.

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,960
We mustn't fuck up the cameras.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,840
So where's Mikey ?

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,720
- We have to go get him.
- Okay.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,800
At 8:30.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,800
Okay.

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,640
We're already behind schedule, but
it's important to have juice.

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,600
That's cool.

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,320
I guess you're Mike !

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,840
Wait. Stop.

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,680
Don't we get to meet your Mama ?

41
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,400
See you later, Mom !

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,000
How are you, Mike ?

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,280
I'm tired but I'm fine.

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,840
I'm real excited about this.
Thank you for the opportunity.

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm very glad. Thanks for
getting the equipment together.

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,880
We've got enough
battery power to...

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,400
..fuel a small country for a month.

48
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,840
We've got rice, fruit punch...

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,120
Oatmeal Raisin, baby.

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,240
The ultimate campfood.

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,840
Feel how soft.

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,000
- Marshmallows...
- Hey, you weasel. Out of my cart !

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,680
Do you believe in ghosts ?

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,960
Ever heard of the Blair Witch ?

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,360
Sounds familiar.
My sister went to Blair High School.

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,680
The woods around Halloween
are creepy.

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,200
- Can you tell me a little more ?
- I don't wanna go cheesy.

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,240
I want to present
this straightforward.

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,520
The legend is unsettling.

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,240
Wanna get the...

61
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,360
...ceremonial first slate ?

62
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,800
Absolutely.

63
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,920
The first slate for our
first shot.

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,040
Should we get our fingers open
and bleed on it ?

65
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,800
A little blood-letting ?

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,320
No, we'll save that for later.

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,240
Kiss the slate.

68
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,960
It's the first slate.

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,920
Marked by my lipstick.

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,600
Mikey, kiss it, good luck.

71
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,720
- There we go.
- Oh, he licked it. Bless him.

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,720
Don't eat it. We're gonna need it.

73
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,400
This is Burkittsville,
formerly Blair.

74
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,720
A small quiet Maryland town.

75
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,680
Like a small, quiet town anywhere.

76
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,240
Some 20 families laid roots here
over 200 years ago.

77
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,760
Many remain, either on this hill...

78
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
...or in the town below.

79
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,600
An unusually high number of
children are buried here...

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,200
...most of whom passed
in the 1 940's.

81
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Yet no one here recalls anything
unusual about this time,...

82
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,000
...not to us, anyway.

83
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,200
Yet legend tells
A different story,...

84
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,640
...whose evidence is all around us.

85
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,880
Etched in stone.

86
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,840
We have shot the first scene,
the cemetery scene.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
The opening is shot.

88
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,600
We're doing a documentary
about the Blair Witch.

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
- Have you heard of the Witch ?
- That's an old, old story.

90
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,680
As I remember,...

91
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,840
...Mr. Parr was an old hermit,...

92
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,880
...and he lived up on a mountain.
He'd been there,...

93
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,360
...for a long, long, time.

94
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,640
- You heard of the Blair Witch ?
- Several times.

95
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,000
What was the first incident ?

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,680
I've heard stories about it
from people and neighbors,

97
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,920
I also saw a documentary on the
television...

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,280
...about her and legends
of Maryland,...

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,960
...my grandmother told us the story
to make us go to bed early.

100
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,400
They say if you stay up after dark
or walk around the house...

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,040
...the Blair witch will get you.

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,360
In the fall or winter of 1 940,...

103
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,520
...some young kids
started disappearing.

104
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,360
Nobody knew...

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,160
...why they were disappearing.

106
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,360
- A kind of an omen, isn't it ?
- The creepiest story about her...

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,200
...was that two men out hunting...

108
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,840
...camped near the cabin
she's supposed to haunt...

109
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,720
No. No.

110
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,040
...and they just disappeared
forever.

111
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm just telling a scary story,
but it's not true.

112
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,640
It's not true.

113
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
One day, old Mr. Parr
came into the market...

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,360
...and said "I'm finally finished".

115
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,480
And what did he mean by that ?

116
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,240
Nobody knew at first...

117
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,320
But the police finally...

118
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,000
went up the mountain...

119
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,760
...and found the bodies of seven
kids in his house.

120
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,400
He would take the kids down
to the basement in twos...

121
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,760
...and he'd make one
face the corner...

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,440
...and he'd kill the other one...

123
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,880
...then he'd kill the one in
the corner too.

124
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,760
Those were the seven kids
that were missing

125
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,800
They brought the kids out of
the woods one at a time...

126
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,080
...it was terrible, it upset
the whole community.

127
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,080
He said he couldn't take
the eyes watching him...

128
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,000
...that's why he made them
face the corner like that.

129
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,960
All my life I've believed...

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,720
...in witches and ghosts and
that kind of stuff

131
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,640
Do you believe there are some
in this area ?

132
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,480
Oh, definitely.

133
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,560
- Do you believe in witchcraft ?
- No.

134
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,600
- Are you religious ?
- Yep.

135
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,680
Alrighty.

136
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Creepy stuff, but I think
something's happening with her.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,280
And do you think she could
still be up there now ?

138
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,160
- I don't go up there.
- You don't ?

139
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,640
I believe enough not to go.

140
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,040
They say the woods are haunted
and stuff like that.

141
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,920
What ? How are they haunted ?

142
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Well there's not many people
who say that it's haunted...

143
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,480
...but there was this old woman,
Mary Brown, who...

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640
Mary Brown ?

145
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,840
Yeah, and she was kind of crazy.

146
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,840
How was she seen by the community ?

147
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,640
Crazy.

148
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,720
There's the American flag,
it's Mary's house.

149
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,480
I'm gonna bring her out.

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,720
You look for the best light, okay ?

151
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,480
Okay.

152
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,640
This is Mary's gate.

153
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,240
I'm not even sure how to open it.

154
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,160
And something interesting
happened to you once...

155
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,360
You met the Blair witch ?

156
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,920
Yes.

157
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,280
That is really...

158
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,880
...kind of a scary story.

159
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,120
To make ends meet...

160
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,840
...my Dad and I

161
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,200
...used to fish at Tappy's Creek.

162
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,280
In Burkittsville.

163
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,560
I was laying on the leaves...

164
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,120
...watching my pole, and
looking at the sky...

165
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,400
...and suddenly I felt
something near me...

166
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,600
...an eerie feeling...

167
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,200
...It was a woman...

168
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,960
...only on her
arms and hands...

169
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,920
...and everything...

170
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,600
...she had hair...

171
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,560
...dark, almost black hair...

172
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,640
...like a horse...

173
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,160
...like a fur, horse fur.

174
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,640
Then on her arm...

175
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,680
...she had a shawl...

176
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,400
And she scared you,
or threatened you ?

177
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,480
She didn't say anything,
she just stared...

178
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,480
...and then she opened her shawl...

179
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,200
What was under there ?

180
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,240
She had hair on her
body like a horse.

181
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
Hairy from head to toe ?

182
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,120
Yeah. And her legs...

183
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,320
- How about her face ?
- You could see she was a female.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
She was just strange looking.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,360
Thank God she's
not in the film business.

186
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
She thinks she is.
She also says she's a ballerina.

187
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,840
Get out.

188
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,760
And she says she's a historian...

189
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,720
I heard that.

190
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,080
...and that she's a scientist
at the Department of Energy.

191
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,320
I fucked up on Mary
with the depth of field.

192
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,160
You measured it in meters ?
We're not in Europe.

193
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,680
The fucking lens
has meters on it.

194
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,200
It also has our system.

195
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,560
Nah, it has meters. Look.

196
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,360
But it's an American camera.

197
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,840
All those are meters.

198
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,760
What about the brown ones ?

199
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,960
They're feet.

200
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,840
The brown ones are on there, right ?

201
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,560
Yeah, but the white
ones are obvious.

202
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
- Didn't you use this camera before ?
- Yeah. Once before.

203
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,440
How was today, guys ?

204
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,240
I learned a lot, man.

205
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,120
About Mary Brown ?

206
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,840
No, I learned a lot about...

207
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,600
1 6 mill ?

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,440
...about shooting, just
shooting documentaries.

209
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,400
- We kicked some ass today.
- Cheers.

210
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,880
Very good day.

211
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,720
Excellent day.

212
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,120
Very good first day.

213
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
Let's do an equipment check,
after I call my mom.

214
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,840
- I got a bag of Utz and a beer.
- We don't need that on film.

215
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,880
So I guess you're covered then.

216
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,520
Could you run it a little
to check it's okay ?

217
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,840
Sure.

218
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,720
I just want to check it's loaded
properly so we can shoot...

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,600
Okay, that's good, that's good.

220
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,840
That's good, thank you.

221
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,960
Let's relax, because we've got
a long day tomorrow.

222
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,320
Today's been easy.

223
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,040
We're gonna have to do a lot
of hiking, carry a lot of weight.

224
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,600
We're preparing.

225
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
Shut up, smartass.
Pour me a shot, please.

226
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
- I'm freaking out.
- You can't, you're the director.

227
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,440
I fucking have to do this now,
okay ? Do we have any weed ?

228
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,800
Here I go.

229
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,200
Drink ! Drink !

230
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,800
I hate fucking scotch.

231
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,440
There's my friend Josh.

232
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,080
How are you ?

233
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm hurtin'.

234
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,120
I'm not ready for that thing yet.

235
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,920
I know you don't like it.

236
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,160
Hello. Welcome to day two.

237
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,560
The trail is along here.

238
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,160
It should be pretty obvious.

239
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
You guys heard of
the Blair witch ?

240
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,320
I heard the myth. I don't
really believe much in it.

241
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,400
The myth ?

242
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,160
That's all I think it is.

243
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,400
What'd you say, sir ?

244
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,840
- I said damn fool kids never learn.
- Shut up.

245
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,520
Damn fool kids never learn ?

246
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,400
That's what I said.

247
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,840
Why do you say that ?

248
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,240
First of all, can I
have your permission...

249
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,080
...to use your image on a
video documentary ?

250
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,360
I don't care about that, but...

251
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,280
You have to say yes or no, sir,

252
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,760
- Watch it.
- I'm sorry.

253
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,640
Yeah, sure, okay.

254
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,360
Some girl, in the late 1 800's...

255
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,040
...Robin Weaver, I
believe her name was,...

256
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,040
...supposedly wandered
off into the woods.

257
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,240
No "supposedly" about it.
She wandered off !

258
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,280
- Okay, wandered off.
- And got lost.

259
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,520
She got lost.

260
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,640
Wasn't no "supposedly".

261
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,800
Three days later...

262
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,120
...she appears back on her
grandmother's porch.

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,800
And everybody's mystified.

264
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,600
- She was babbling something...
- Her story.

265
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,920
Babbling something about...

266
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,600
...an old woman whose feet
never touched the ground.

267
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,920
I saw.. just by that
tree up the creek...

268
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,320
...about a hundred yards,

269
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,600
I saw a white misty thing.
Can't tell you what it was.

270
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,840
Like grey vapor rising
out of the trees.

271
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,400
Right out of the water.

272
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,480
Right out of the water ?

273
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,960
Up the side of the trees,
Then it disappeared.

274
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,560
You're full of it.

275
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,760
I'm not. And I wasn't
drinking that day, either.

276
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,760
Sure you weren't.

277
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,840
How is that related to the
story of Coffin Rock ?

278
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,480
It all ties in to the
story of Coffin Rock.

279
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,280
How's that ?

280
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,600
Anybody round here...

281
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,680
...knows that the old woman has
haunted this area for years.

282
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,240
That's bullshit.

283
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,800
These woods are thick.

284
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,600
You excited ?

285
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,480
You got it.

286
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,000
I hope he's not shooting a
whole shitload of stock.

287
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,520
I could help, but I'd
rather record.

288
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,440
Okay.

289
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,360
Packs on, we're ready to go.

290
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,320
We gotta go up to the shack ?

291
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,240
Yeah.

292
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,120
My God, this is a very heavy pack.

293
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,400
Off to Coffin Rock.

294
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,440
I know exactly where we are now.

295
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,560
Mikey, give me the video camera.

296
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,880
I wanna get her going across, man.

297
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,440
I see a dirty behind.

298
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,400
Good jump.

299
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,200
Thank you.

300
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,000
There it is. See ?

301
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,280
That's Coffin Rock.

302
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,040
"They went into the woods
ready to find death...

303
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,160
...but what they found
was inhumane...

304
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,120
...at the site called Coffin Rock.

305
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,800
...up on the rock, the torture...

306
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,200
...suffered by these five
brave men was obvious...

307
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,200
...they were tied up, one man's
hands tied to the next man's feet...

308
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,280
...forming a solid
human structure...

309
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,280
...blood indicated that
it had happened...

310
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,080
...while they were
alive and resisting...

311
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,600
...their intestines had been
crudely torn out...

312
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,680
...and on each of their faces there
was indecipherable writing...

313
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,880
...cut into their flesh
with precision...

314
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,720
...the men, shocked by
what had happened...

315
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,640
...went to find the sheriff...

316
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,040
...without sketching the writing
or touching the bodies...

317
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,160
...they returned to see
vultures at the rock.

318
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,120
But the bodies had been
removed by persons unknown...

319
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,160
...the stench of death
was still thick...

320
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,640
...but the bodies had been
taken in a matter of hours..."

321
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,120
That happened here
at Coffin Rock.

322
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,400
Let's rush, because I want
to camp, and it's 4:52.

323
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,400
It's late. We're gonna be
losing light soon.

324
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,080
But I can use the shot
without me in it...

325
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,280
...because I recorded sound
while reading the whole thing,...

326
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,920
...so I'm sure I can edit
it together somehow.

327
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,440
It's starting to rain.

328
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,080
Did you rent this thing ?

329
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,840
Yeah. I don't have a
tent for three people.

330
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
Just wondering...

331
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,560
I don't usually travel with two men.

332
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,400
It is pouring with rain.
Can't even light a fire.

333
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,760
Show us what the stick is for.

334
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,600
Look. We've got our
very own leaning post.

335
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,800
If it smells of farts
too much in the night...

336
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,360
Okay, so I can't have a
cigarette in the tent,...

337
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,680
...but he can fart as
much as he wants ?

338
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,400
No, I never gave Mike
a fart allowance.

339
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,720
You heard noises last night ?

340
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,280
- I did.
- Problem is, I sleep like a log.

341
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,800
There were two separate noises...

342
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,800
...coming from two
areas over here...

343
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,400
...one of them could
have been an owl...

344
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,720
...but the other was a cackling.

345
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,040
No way.

346
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,760
It was a cackling, man.

347
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,280
If I heard a cackling,
I would've shit myself.

348
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,600
Where did we start yesterday ?

349
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,320
Off the map.

350
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,720
I knew where we were going.
There was some confusion, but today..

351
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,200
Wait,...say that again.

352
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,520
I said I knew where
we were going.

353
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,600
Wait,...was that a
full of shit statement ?

354
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,400
No, it wasn't.

355
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,480
- So that wasn't bullshit ?
- I knew where we were going.

356
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,760
You got us lost, man.

357
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,720
For a very short period of time.

358
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,800
Just don't get us lost today.

359
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,600
Yeah, seriously.

360
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,520
No. These places are
very well documented.

361
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,680
You happy with the documentary ?

362
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,800
Yes, I am.

363
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,520
I'm very pleasantly surprised
by our little Mikey.

364
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,760
"Our Little Mikey ?"

365
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,280
Our Little Mikey...

366
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,040
...a very spirited young man.

367
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,120
What do you think about the
witch ? You think she exists ?

368
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,040
I don't know.

369
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,800
Heather, I really hope
you find us a trail.

370
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,840
There's a trail up on
this hill. Don't worry.

371
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,920
We like shortcuts, don't we ?

372
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,200
We like level shortcuts.

373
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,800
Not mountain shortcuts.

374
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,480
It's the first time we've
seen Mike's chest.

375
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,840
It's really hard to film on video.

376
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,760
He has really sporadic hair
patterns on his chest.

377
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,800
Like symbols.

378
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,400
It's like blank...hairy..

379
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,400
...blank...hairy.

380
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,480
You should see my ass.

381
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,440
Look, here's fucking Uruguay.

382
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
- And there's Paraguay.
- Yeah.

383
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,240
I think I see Bolivia.

384
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,040
What killed this
mouse ? Witchcraft ?

385
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,600
How 'bout God ?

386
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,320
Is that the Blair Witch ?

387
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,920
No. I think it's Heather,
taking a piss.

388
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,960
You know, I
really have to go.

389
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,560
Ohhh...go !

390
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,000
We're near the cemetery
trail. It should only be...

391
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,000
- What ?
- Says who ?

392
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,160
Says me, of course.

393
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,720
We should be there
in about ninety minutes.

394
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
You guys cool with that ?

395
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,600
What ?

396
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,800
Ninety minutes ?

397
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,520
- If you know where we're going.
- Sure.

398
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,600
Josh wants to look at the map now.

399
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,600
Though I know
where we're going.

400
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,000
If you'd known where
we were, we wouldn't be...

401
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,240
We're in the middle
of the fucking woods.

402
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,880
- How could you possibly know ?
- Because some is offtrail.

403
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,600
What, somebody told you
there's a cemetery back there ?

404
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,160
If we're lost, admit that, because...

405
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,520
...I know we're not lost.

406
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,920
You knew that yesterday, too,
and twice again today.

407
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,960
Bullshit ! We have
not been lost today.

408
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,040
Not once.

409
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,200
Okay, this is where we were.

410
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,840
You said that it was
two miles away.

411
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,880
Then it's two hours away,
three hours away...

412
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,520
- Okay, just chill !
- Maybe it's four hours away.

413
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,400
- You agreed to do this project.
- I agreed to a scouted-out project.

414
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,280
- Not to wander round the woods.
- I told you that...

415
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,760
...getting to the locations
wasn't gonna be easy.

416
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,720
Mike, Mike...Okay, guys !

417
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,000
Please, you're being a smart-ass.

418
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,400
We're looking at the map...

419
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,040
...we'll find this the best we can.

420
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,880
This is where we were. We're
going more or less this way.

421
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,200
Okay, what do you say ? Where
do you think we're going ?

422
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,080
To tell you the truth...

423
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,880
...this is Greek
to me. It's useless.

424
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,840
Exactly.

425
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,560
So I'm putting my trust in you...

426
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,560
...that you know where it is.

427
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,240
Good.

428
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,880
Though I gotta tell you,
I don't fully trust you...

429
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,920
...and I...

430
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,560
What ?

431
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,600
I don't know why you tape
every conversation, man.

432
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,800
Well, we're making a documentary.

433
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,000
Not about us getting lost,
it's about a witch !

434
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,640
I have a camera.

435
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,000
We'll all look back on this
and laugh, believe me.

436
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,400
Baby steps, man, baby steps.

437
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,720
Just breathe and don't look down.
No, you gotta look down.

438
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,240
Are you gonna have to crawl ?

439
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:29,960
I'm gonna crawl.

440
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,680
Cool.

441
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,280
Think how cool the fucking
cemetery is gonna be.

442
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,040
Think of the joy of being
in a really good film.

443
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,040
Okay, shut the fuck up.

444
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,400
Okay, I'm quiet.

445
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,680
Shit. How am I gonna do this ?

446
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,920
Okay...Mikey ?

447
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,680
Yeah.

448
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,480
Dude, don't come across
with the DAT on your belly.

449
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,560
No way, man.

450
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,960
There's no chance.

451
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,120
How do we get it
across ?

452
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,160
It's really fucking hard.

453
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,520
How we gonna get
it across ?

454
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,880
The moss this morning was easy.
This stuff's slippery as shit.

455
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,400
Well, how do we get
the DAT across ?

456
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,800
I don't know. Let
me put my pack down...

457
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,640
I'll just go back and forth, man.

458
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,800
Can you do it that way ?

459
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,400
It's the only thing I can do.

460
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,960
Okay, we'll do it like that.

461
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,200
Oh, Christ !

462
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,200
Oh, what'd you drop ?

463
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,040
Nothing.
The tree just broke.

464
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,280
Oh, fuck.

465
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,440
We're very, very close now.

466
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,440
You guys excited ?

467
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,440
Okay.

468
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,400
What's this ?

469
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,240
What's this ? Dude, guys.

470
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,320
Remember what Mary
Brown said the other day ?

471
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,600
What story from the
Bible was she telling us ?

472
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,000
Fuck, I wasn't listening, I
thought she was crazy.

473
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,280
It was Esau, something about a
pile of rocks.

474
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,480
She was talking
about her rocks, man.

475
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,760
Well, what about
the rocks ?

476
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,880
Anybody remember ?

477
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,360
To live your life.

478
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,840
Looks like an Indian
burial ground, man.

479
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,960
I don't know if this counts,
three...

480
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,840
...four...

481
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,160
...five...

482
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,160
...six...

483
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,440
...seven.

484
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,320
Years ago witches
were roasted...

485
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,480
...just like my Vienna sausage.

486
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,840
Flames are licking you
like the Devil, Josh.

487
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,320
Sit back and hear a tale,
a tale of a fateful trip...

488
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,720
...that started on
this desert isle...

489
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,720
...aboard this tiny ship...

490
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,920
Yeah, but this ship
has a good captain...

491
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,360
...not a beer-guzzling
guy in a blue shirt.

492
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,120
He wasn't beer-guzzling.

493
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,600
They had no beer on
the island, man.

494
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,640
If they had beer, they'd
have had big-ass orgies.

495
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,040
You're like the Captain,
and Mike's your Gilligan.

496
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,000
- No offense.
- That's all right.

497
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,560
It was a compliment...

498
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,520
...Gilligan was a funny guy...

499
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,840
...the Captain was fat, though.

500
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,200
Well okay, let's call
it a thin Captain.

501
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,880
It's not Captain...

502
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,440
It's the Skipper.

503
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,200
No more Captain.

504
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,640
Here we are back at
the rock again...

505
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,440
...the cemetery deal.

506
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,200
I just wanna be careful
not to get in the shot.

507
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,040
It certainly is odd.

508
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,080
Please tell me you didn't
just knock that over.

509
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,800
I didn't just knock that over.

510
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,880
That's not very nice.
Let me put it back.

511
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,520
You can't be too careful.

512
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,240
What'd you think ?

513
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,360
It was the same, only darker.

514
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,520
Yeah, pretty much.

515
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,160
All right. Bag it up.

516
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
Hello ?

517
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,920
Shit, no light.

518
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,920
We were sleeping.

519
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,000
Do you want this ?

520
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,880
Put it by the tent door.

521
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,400
Listen.

522
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,920
Hello ?

523
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,520
Hello !

524
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,320
It's all around us.
Fucking weird.

525
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,760
Michael, aren't you
coming down ?

526
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,200
I ain't going down there.

527
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,600
Why not ?

528
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,440
- Because I don't hear shit.
- You're fucking scared.

529
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,720
Because I don't
hear anything !

530
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,040
You cannot deny hearing it.

531
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,840
Get your ass out ! Come on !

532
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,080
This rain fucking blows, man.

533
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,200
I know. It's raining heavily.

534
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,160
Thanks mom for giving me
rain gear for my birthday.

535
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,920
God bless her.

536
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,040
What do you think it
was last night ?

537
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,800
Personally ?

538
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,480
Yeah.

539
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,760
Someone fucking
with your head.

540
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,680
But nobody knows
we're here.

541
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,240
Yeah, but...you ever see
"Deliverance" ?

542
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,080
Well, whatever it was,
I just wanted to...

543
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,360
You were freaking out.
You bugged me out.

544
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,440
I was. I woke up suddenly
and shit's going down...

545
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,160
...and all I can think is
"I want it all...

546
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,960
I want it on sound,
I want it on sixteen.

547
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,760
If we see anything,
I want it on sixteen."

548
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,160
Sounded to me like a lot
of people running around...

549
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,240
...maybe they were locals
or whatever.

550
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,280
I don't know what
the hell they wanted.

551
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,360
We're deep in the woods, and
if people want to mess with us...

552
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,480
...then there's something
wrong with them...

553
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,040
...and I'm not gonna
get into that.

554
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,320
And if it wasn't people ?

555
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,320
Well, I'm not gonna
get into that, either !

556
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,800
Fuck, man..

557
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,440
..it's been a very long day...

558
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,320
...a very wet, very long day.

559
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
Nobody's speaking to me
right now.

560
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,560
Dude, I don't remember
any of this.

561
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
What ?

562
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,320
I don't remember any
of this coming from the car.

563
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,160
We have to go a different
route to get back...

564
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,360
...because we went
around in a curve.

565
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,840
Two more hours max, guys.

566
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,600
If we came by a short cut, why
are we going back a different way ?

567
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,280
Because we have to go round...

568
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,240
It was the most direct way to
hit our two locations.

569
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,320
And this is the quickest
way back to the car.

570
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,400
Seriously ?

571
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,960
Yes. Seriously.

572
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,880
- You know exactly what's going on ?
- Yes. Let's just keep going.

573
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,120
All right.

574
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,160
Five minutes and we
do a map check.

575
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,640
All right.

576
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,040
We just did a map check,
and we're still on track.

577
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,280
That's not what I said.

578
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,280
We're all right. Come on,
just keep going.

579
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,760
Well the compass says...

580
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,120
...we go straight ahead,
that way.

581
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,840
We're in the middle of nowhere.

582
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,640
We've been in the middle
of nowhere for two days.

583
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,440
Just like the car.

584
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,160
Look at this shit, man !
This is nothing.

585
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,440
Let's just keep
going, all right ?

586
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,720
I think we should camp.

587
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,920
Get the fuck out of here !

588
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,080
Why ? 'Cause you don't know
where we are ?

589
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,200
No, because we're still
A little way from the car...

590
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,680
...and it's gonna be dark soon.

591
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,240
- Look, I'm not sure...
- We don't camp. Stop the camera...

592
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,440
...and get us home.

593
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,880
Turn the camera off and give
me the fucking map.

594
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,480
Turn it off and get us home.

595
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,680
No, I'm filming. I want
to mark this occasion.

596
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,840
Give me the map.

597
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,840
The map is in my
pocket. Wait a second.

598
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,200
God damn !

599
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,840
If we keep our heads
together, we'll be just fine.

600
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,440
Fucking bullshit !

601
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,640
Mike, chill.

602
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,320
Just relax, Mike.

603
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,520
Don't fucking tell
me to relax !

604
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,000
Let's just sit down,
and check the map...

605
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,120
Yes. Let's do that, please.

606
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,720
Are you happy ?

607
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,200
I'm not happy, no.

608
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,840
But the car isn't far. But we
can't find it in the dark.

609
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,680
Are you absolutely sure ?

610
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,560
Yes. I'm so sorry. We can still
get the DAT back tomorrow.

611
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,880
We have to...

612
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,280
We will get the
DAT back on time.

613
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,840
And the camera.

614
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,400
We'll get it all
back tomorrow.

615
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,840
I start work tomorrow at nine.

616
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,000
I know.

617
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,120
It's fine. Let's go to sleep.

618
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,320
Let's just fucking camp, okay ?

619
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,800
I wanna tape it from
inside the tent.

620
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,200
Whatever it is, it sounds the
same as last night.

621
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,040
Where's my boots ? Fuck, it's cold...

622
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,680
Hello ?

623
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,240
Shit, it's fucking freezing...

624
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,360
...there.

625
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,400
What ?

626
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,640
I hear it.

627
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,600
I don't hear shit.

628
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,960
You hear that ?

629
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,840
Shit...

630
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,840
Hello ?

631
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,560
I think it's just a deer.

632
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,000
- Could be deer, I guess.
- It's just a deer.

633
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,720
I don't think so, man.

634
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,880
Sounds just like last night.
It's all around us.

635
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,280
It's gotta be just a deer.

636
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,800
It was a deer, man.

637
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,280
It wasn't like last night.

638
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,160
You say something ?

639
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,760
Yes ! Fucking listen ! Let's
get it on DAT...be quiet...

640
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,320
Okay, it's on.

641
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,560
Jesus Christ ! What the
fuck was that ?

642
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,280
It's not scared by our yelling.

643
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,760
Sounds like footsteps.

644
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,920
I know ! It's a fucking person !

645
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,560
I don't see shit on video.
We'll just use DAT, right ?

646
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,560
But I'm staying out.

647
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,040
You stay out here with me.

648
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,240
I am. I am.

649
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,320
What time is it ? Anywhere
near morning ?

650
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,880
Let me see...

651
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,520
Tell me it's five
O'clock or something.

652
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,680
Three.

653
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,640
Fuck !

654
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,120
Bullshit. This is
fucking crazy.

655
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,360
I'm sorry, Mike. We should
be home already.

656
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,520
This has got nothing to do...

657
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,280
...with what we're here for.

658
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,280
This is just it's bullshit.

659
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,040
Woke up this morning,
two seconds ago...

660
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,240
...and there are piles of
rocks outside our tent.

661
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,640
There are three, actually.

662
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,080
Are you positive those
weren't there last night ?

663
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,040
I am fucking positive
they weren't here !

664
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,560
How could we have
just camped...

665
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,920
...between three piles of rocks
just by coincidence ?

666
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,240
You don't think this is strange ?

667
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,160
It is fucking weird, but
I really don't care...

668
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,800
...because all I want to do
is get to the goddam car.

669
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,960
Whatever it is,
man, right now...

670
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,040
...we have to get back to the car.

671
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,000
They obviously don't want us
Here, so let's get out.

672
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,560
We have to get the DAT back.

673
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,040
- That's what I mean.
- Okay, let's go.

674
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Let's pack our shit up
and just walk.

675
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,360
Can we just walk ?

676
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,440
Yes, we're out of here.

677
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,440
Okay, cool.

678
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,440
But we're leaving just
when it's all happening.

679
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,520
Put the fucking camera down.
Let's pack up the tent.

680
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,800
- Let's get out of the woods.
- Okay, hang on.

681
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,360
Come on !

682
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,400
No, I'm not scared !
I'm just tired and hungry...

683
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,600
I'm just fucking done, man.

684
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,680
All right.

685
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,720
Did you take it ?

686
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,760
No, I didn't take the fucking map.

687
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,800
I'm not playing head games.

688
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,040
You're the one playing
head games.

689
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,600
But I'm not.

690
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,120
I don't have it. We have to go.
I'm serious, I don't have it.

691
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,280
Are you fucking serious ?

692
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,400
Fucking serious. I don't have it.

693
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,560
Heather, that is not so cool, man.

694
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,400
I know it's not cool !

695
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,280
It's the fucking least
responsible thing...

696
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,800
...you could have done, man.

697
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,640
I know that.

698
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,400
You really don't have it ?

699
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,800
One of you must have the map.

700
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,280
No, I don't have the map.
We gave it back to you...

701
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,440
...after map check yesterday.

702
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,440
I always keep it in the
same place...

703
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,520
...and if it's not there,
one of you must have it.

704
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,840
I did not get the goddam map
out of your fucking pants, man.

705
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,000
Well, I don't have it !

706
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,440
Look, why would I take it ?

707
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,880
I just wanna get out
of here, man.

708
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,000
Me too.

709
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's go !

710
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,440
No, you wanna stay and
film rocks, look around...

711
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,240
Let's go !

712
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,520
..you wanna film this and that...
Which way ?

713
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,320
That way.

714
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,240
We're in the
middle of the woods !

715
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,600
We can walk any way !

716
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,920
This way ! Because we've
been going this way all day.

717
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,800
We're going this way !
We gotta find something !

718
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,920
I gave you back the map !

719
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,760
I gave you the map.

720
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,080
I gave you back the map !

721
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,360
- Let's just go.
- We can move as fast as we want...

722
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,240
...but there's no point if we have
no idea where we're going.

723
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,640
We're following the creek.
Mike seems happy with that.

724
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,000
Would you guys stop it ?

725
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,600
We are fucked, we are done...

726
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,080
...we are dead, we are fucked.

727
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,720
I'm staying here. When you
find someone...

728
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,040
...tell them I'm under the
tree with the vine.

729
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,680
All blame aside...

730
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,080
...this is really fucked up.

731
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,520
I know.

732
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,320
We really need to work together.

733
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,560
- I realize that.
- Exactly. Exactly.

734
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,800
So we accept the fact that my
camera's not gonna be back...

735
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,160
...or your DAT.

736
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,880
No blame from now
on about that shit.

737
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,040
Look, seriously...

738
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,360
...this area's not that fucking big.

739
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,240
Exactly. It's very hard to get
lost in America these days...

740
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,320
...and even harder to stay lost.

741
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,360
What ?

742
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,560
Well, we're doin' a pretty good
job of being lost.

743
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,400
If you're not home today,
and I'm not home today...

744
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,160
...people are gonna notice...

745
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,080
...My girlfriend's definitely
gonna notice...

746
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,200
...and she'll notice that
I haven't called.

747
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,960
...that I didn't get back and
I didn't call...

748
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,760
...so if by tonight we
haven't found shit...

749
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,520
...someone's gonna be looking for us.

750
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,560
Oh, no !

751
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,440
Not down here, go another way...

752
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,680
...I just got my whole shit wet.

753
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,920
Shit. Well, let's try it this way.

754
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,480
No, not this way...

755
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,640
...better try the other way.

756
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,840
- If we didn't have these packs...
- I don't mean to laugh...

757
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,040
Your feet are wet !

758
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,840
Is Michael laughing ?

759
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,960
Shut up and cross the stream.

760
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,800
He's laughing...

761
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,800
...that's the first time
you've laughed in days.

762
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,960
I'm happy you
find it amusing...

763
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,360
...that I'll be uncomfortable
for the rest of the day.

764
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,160
Dude, uncomfort does not even...

765
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,360
Can we keep going, please ?

766
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,760
No, we're gonna chill out !

767
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,400
- Didn't you want to get to the car ?
- Oh boy ! !

768
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,360
Okay, come on...let's get up here.

769
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
Oh shit.

770
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,160
You weren't lying to me about
the map, were you ?

771
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,040
'Cause to me it seems like you're
having a little too much fun.

772
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,000
- Oh, Heather..
- We're going a little stir crazy.

773
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,200
Heather ! If you make me
yell at this point...

774
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,160
...don't make me
yell at you, man.

775
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,760
Seriously, if you got the map, I
just wanna know you have it !

776
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,200
That would make me happy,
just to know you have it.

777
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,160
If I knew that, and I could see
it, I'd feel much better.

778
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,960
We're just trying to
be cool with you.

779
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,400
So I get laughed at 'cause
my shoes got wet.

780
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,920
It's fucking hilarious.

781
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,760
All our shoes are wet...

782
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,280
...we were laughing
at the situation.

783
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,160
Fine.

784
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,240
We're fucking hungry
and fucking tired...

785
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,080
-...what the hell else can we do ?
- You know what ?

786
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,600
I'm sorry, it's fucked up...

787
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,360
...but I kicked that map into the
creek yesterday.

788
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,360
It was useless and I kicked it
into the creek !

789
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,040
I fucking hope he's kidding.

790
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,280
Mike ?

791
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,360
I really fucking hope he's kidding.

792
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,440
Mike, are you fucking kidding ?

793
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,240
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.

794
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,720
You're kidding me. You have
gotta be fucking kidding me !

795
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,760
- You think it's a game ?
- Get off me !

796
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,880
What the fuck ?
Are you out of your mind ?

797
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,360
No, I'm not. That map
wasn't doing shit !

798
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,680
Not for you, but I knew what
the fuck the map said ! !

799
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,680
I'm sorry !

800
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,600
You're a fucking asshole !

801
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,640
I'm sorry.

802
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,120
You're a fucking asshole !

803
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,520
That map was useless !

804
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,400
If we get hurt or die here,
it's your fucking fault !

805
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,840
You understand ?

806
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,600
How could you be
such an asshole ?

807
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,040
- What were you thinking ?
- You are fucking me up here !

808
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,080
I am not ! That map
was useless !

809
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,280
It was useless to you !

810
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,560
Okay...

811
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,040
I didn't bring you out
here for this, man.

812
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,600
Sorry about the map, man.
What can I say ?

813
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,640
- The map wasn't doing shit.
- Just don't say sorry.

814
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,280
It wasn't worth
shit to you.

815
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,280
I knew exactly where
we were !

816
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,200
Listen ! Yesterday I asked you what
fucking river we were on...

817
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,600
Shut up or else.

818
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,280
Turn the fucking camera off !

819
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,480
Give me the compass...

820
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,080
...you have betrayed us...

821
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,400
...way fucking beyond.
Give me the compass.

822
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,880
So have you for not getting
us out of the woods.

823
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,240
Yeah, thanks.

824
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,480
Can I have the fucking compass ?

825
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,760
No. I bought the compass.
If you wanted one...

826
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
...you should've
bought your own.

827
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,320
You and he both fucked us up.

828
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,160
Why can't you admit that...

829
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,680
-...you fucked up from the start.
- Let's just walk south.

830
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,000
Because I haven't !

831
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
Why are we stopped ?

832
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,120
Why are we stopped ?

833
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,080
Just don't.

834
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,280
I'm just asking
Why we stopped.

835
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,680
Weren't we going south ?

836
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,680
We all seemed very
Happy with that.

837
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,240
Why don't we carry on like that ?

838
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,160
What ?

839
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,400
There's all sorts of
Stuff down here !

840
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,800
What kind of stuff ?

841
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,600
Voodoo shit !

842
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,560
What ?

843
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,640
- Hanging all over the place !
- No way...

844
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,640
It's all over.

845
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,680
Holy shit...

846
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,120
Come up quick ! I need the CP !

847
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,960
There's all sorts
Here, man !

848
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,160
This is fucking crazy shit.

849
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,960
Please, I gotta film this !

850
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,320
Take the fucking camera.

851
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,120
What the fuck is this ?

852
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,520
I have no idea.

853
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,160
Jesus Christ, that's fucking creepy.

854
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,960
This is no redneck.
No redneck is this creative.

855
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,160
Can we go now ?

856
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,680
Yeah, please.

857
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,800
Okay, I got everything on video.

858
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,640
Oh, Jesus Christ, I didn't
Even see these !

859
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,960
Okay, Heather, you got
Enough, man. Let's go.

860
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,560
- That's enough ! Stop taping !
- That's enough !

861
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,480
- Okay, we're going right now.
- Let's go !

862
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,240
Okay, we're out of here.
I'm leaving.

863
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,760
Come on, turn it off !

864
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,960
Help !

865
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,800
Please help us !

866
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,240
We won't get out of here like that.

867
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,400
Fuck !

868
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,360
Fuck !

869
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,360
I think I can say
that we're now lost.

870
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,760
I don't know what to do.

871
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,200
We should all get
Inside the tent.

872
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,400
All right.

873
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,560
Let's not light a fire tonight.

874
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,200
Yeah, that's my thinking.

875
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,440
- That's a good idea.
- We didn't light one the first night.

876
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,440
And nothing happened.

877
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,480
We light fires, and they know.
No one was following us.

878
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,240
We should turn that light off, too.

879
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,480
All right.

880
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,320
Seriously, anything
could attract them.

881
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,080
Let's just go to sleep.

882
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,000
Oh God.

883
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,720
Put this out.

884
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,360
Jesus Christ, little kids. Oh, God !

885
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm gonna put my jeans on.

886
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,920
Take the video camera.
No, the DAT.

887
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,440
I'm gonna get this on video.

888
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,200
Oh, dear God, dear God !

889
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,040
Go, fucking go !

890
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:26,920
Oh God !

891
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,280
Oh God !

892
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,560
Hurry up !

893
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,520
I'm coming ! My boots aren't laced !

894
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,480
Oh my God, what the fuck is that ?

895
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,960
What the fuck is that ?

896
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,160
Oh, shit !

897
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,600
Mike, where are you, man ?

898
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,200
Turn the lights off...

899
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,080
...turn that light off.
turn it off, Josh.

900
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,800
All lights off,
all lights off.

901
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,080
I'm soaking.

902
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,280
That's okay.

903
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,040
What was that ?

904
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,920
What the fuck is going on ?

905
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,880
You hear that baby screaming ?

906
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,520
Shut the fuck up. There's
no fucking baby.

907
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,560
- Yes there was.
- There was no fucking baby.

908
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,160
I haven't heard anything
since we ran away...

909
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,280
Oh my God, it's cold.

910
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,200
We should be quiet, okay ?

911
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,920
I don't hear anything anymore.
Let's go back.

912
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,640
How long have we been here ?

913
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,480
I don't know, man, an hour...?

914
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,600
The sun's up. We're okay now.

915
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,640
Let's just get back,
pack up, and go.

916
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,000
Okay.

917
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,360
What the fuck, man ?

918
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,400
Where's my pack ?

919
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,360
Right there. Where's mine ?

920
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,400
What the fuck, man ?

921
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,480
Why're they fucking
with us like this ?

922
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,840
They just opened it up.

923
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,920
They spilled all my water !

924
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,720
Looks like slime, man.

925
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,680
It's just water, man.

926
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,600
It is slime. What the fuck is it ?

927
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,400
Let's get out of here.

928
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,960
- Heather, turn that thing off !
- Let's go.

929
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,960
Okay.

930
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,040
I'm not interested
anymore ! Let's go !

931
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,120
I know.

932
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,480
So turn it off.

933
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,480
Relax. Have we got everything here ?

934
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,480
- Like I give a shit.
- Whose bag was opened ?

935
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,800
It was mine !

936
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,200
Why you ?

937
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,440
Are you not scared enough yet ?

938
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,320
But why you ?

939
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,560
Put it down. This is not funny.

940
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,120
Am I laughing at all ?

941
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,440
No, but you're still doing
your documentary thing, man !

942
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,000
Still your fucking documentary !

943
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,880
- Don't touch it !
- Then turn the goddam thing off !

944
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,640
If you bite me again,
I'll throw you in river.

945
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,000
- Don't touch my camera.
- Turn it off !

946
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,080
I'm sorry.

947
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,680
I didn't mean it, okay ?

948
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,720
You all right ?

949
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,440
Yeah. I wanna go home...

950
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,440
...but I wanna get
what we can.

951
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,000
What the fuck.. ?

952
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,560
Is this possible ?

953
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,000
All right.

954
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,960
Here I go.

955
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,520
I hate crossing streams on logs.

956
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,800
If I never cross another stream...

957
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,680
...on a log, I'll die happy.

958
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,920
I see why you like the
video camera so much.

959
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,200
You do ?

960
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,160
It's not quite reality.

961
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,640
Reality says we gotta move.

962
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,840
But it's a totally filtered
reality, man.

963
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,680
As if everything's
not quite the way it is.

964
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,320
Just leave him alone awhile

965
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,600
We need to go.

966
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,160
Leave him for five minutes.

967
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,800
Leave him alone. Five minutes.

968
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,640
Come on, he's lost it.

969
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,120
I know, but we've all
nearly lost it.

970
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,200
I know, but we got
to look after each other.

971
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,400
And we're not looking after him...

972
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,520
...if we film him
while he's crying.

973
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,440
I know.

974
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,920
I know you know.

975
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,480
Let's try and keep our wits.

976
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,960
But we have to go.

977
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,400
Sure. Believe me, I know.

978
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,200
It's hard to stay calm.

979
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,400
- We need to get out.
- I know.

980
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,000
You're not telling me
anything new,

981
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,720
Just let him calm down.

982
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,240
Anybody got a cigarette ?

983
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,200
No, man.

984
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,680
No, there's none left.

985
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,360
Nobody has any cigarettes ?

986
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,560
We're out.

987
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,200
Why the fuck...

988
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,080
...was this blue jelly
shit on my shit ?

989
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,360
Let's go.

990
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,160
Let's go.

991
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,280
If we keep going south,
we'll get out.

992
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,320
Please...

993
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,280
I don't wanna camp
another fucking night.

994
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,760
Josh, none of us do.

995
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,840
I know you don't.

996
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,160
Whoever it is, is gonna come
back, and that's a fact.

997
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,480
It's not a fact.

998
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,520
It came three nights running,
and it's worse every night.

999
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,200
Just what I need to
hear right now.

1000
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,720
I'm just trying to
rationally say that...

1001
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,240
...with our walking speed,
they might just go on forever..

1002
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,320
Not possible in this country.

1003
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,880
Why not ?

1004
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,560
Because we've destroyed most
of our woods in America.

1005
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,920
- Let's just keep going.
- America, America...

1006
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,560
...God shed your grace on thee...

1007
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,360
...Once so proudly we hailed...

1008
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,440
...at twilight's last gleaming...

1009
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,320
That's the tree we crossed.

1010
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,480
That tree is down. Same one.

1011
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,440
Oh God !

1012
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:35,960
Oh no...

1013
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,720
You got to be kidding,
this is a joke !

1014
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,200
It's not funny !

1015
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,160
Mike, please stop...
please stop...

1016
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,360
Oh no !

1017
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,960
No, Mike, it's not the same log !

1018
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,480
- Same log !
- Look, it's not !

1019
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,440
Yes it is ! Open your eyes !

1020
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,560
It's not the same log...

1021
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,640
It's the same log.

1022
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,680
Fuck you, God ! !

1023
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,200
It's the same log.

1024
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,760
Okay, it's okay.

1025
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,320
Where do you wanna camp ?

1026
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,080
Going south didn't work.
Tomorrow we go east.

1027
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,240
I don't know what to say, Josh.

1028
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,840
How the fuck did we wind
up in the same place ?

1029
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,920
We walked south
all fucking day !

1030
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,080
I don't know how we
ended up here !

1031
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,960
Do you expect me to do,
or say something ?

1032
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,200
What do you wanna do ?

1033
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,520
Josh ?

1034
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,120
I wanna make movies, Heather.

1035
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,360
Isn't that why we came ?

1036
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,160
Let's make some movies.

1037
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,880
Fuck you.

1038
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,960
Fuck you.

1039
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,160
Let's not fight, please ?

1040
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,920
...I can't take it.
I can't fight.

1041
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,800
We're screwed, and that's it.
Please stop fighting.

1042
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,360
I'll do the first watch.

1043
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,960
I got first watch.

1044
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,600
It's not the time or place, guys.

1045
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,520
We have things to prepare for.

1046
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,320
Okay, here's your motivation...

1047
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,720
...you're lost, you're angry and
no one's here to help you...

1048
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,200
...there's a fucking witch who
keeps leaving shit around...

1049
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,760
...no one can help you...

1050
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,320
...she left little trinkets, and
you fucking took one...

1051
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,000
...she's chasing us. And
no one can help you !

1052
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,880
We walked fifteen hours today...

1053
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,160
...and we ended up in the same place !

1054
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,640
There's no one to help you !
That's your motivation !

1055
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,760
Please stop.

1056
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,200
Josh, quit it. She's had enough.

1057
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,240
You got her back. Good one.

1058
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,840
No, she's still making movies !

1059
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,920
- Please stop.
- Still making movies.

1060
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,880
It's all I have left, okay ?
Just please stop.

1061
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,920
Please stop yelling at me.

1062
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,400
I'm fucking tired of
crying all day.

1063
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,160
We gotta think like human beings.
We got things to do.

1064
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,880
We've gotta do shifts.
We got lots to do.

1065
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,040
You gonna write us a
happy ending, Heather ?

1066
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,280
Come on, turn it off.

1067
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,080
You're getting like she was.

1068
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,760
I don't know how you can
sew at this point, man,

1069
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,720
Well, I'm cold.

1070
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,160
- I know.
- I hear you.

1071
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,720
The smallest comforts
we can get are good.

1072
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,440
Doesn't it seem absurd,
though, at this point ?

1073
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,680
Yes, it does.

1074
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,040
Lots of things seem absurd.

1075
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,680
Like sleeping where we were
last night is freaking...

1076
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,960
It's just fucking me up, period.

1077
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,000
Really fucking me up, man.

1078
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,760
- I'm sorry, man.
- Me too. It's all right.

1079
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,520
I'm sorry, Heather.

1080
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,200
It's all right.

1081
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,680
Who wants a cheeseburger ?

1082
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,600
I do, I do...

1083
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,760
I got a cheeseburger in my pocket.

1084
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,360
Do you ? Can I have a
light to cut this ?

1085
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,560
Know what I'd fucking love ?

1086
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,840
What ?

1087
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,320
Mashed potatoes.

1088
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,600
Me too.

1089
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,520
My mom's mashed potatoes.

1090
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,840
You'll have them again very soon.

1091
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,320
Mashed potatoes
and a piece of ass.

1092
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,000
Josh ?

1093
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,200
Fuck, we never go out of earshot !

1094
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,120
Come on, calm down.

1095
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,920
How can I ?

1096
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,600
He's probably at the river.

1097
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,040
If he was there,
he could hear me.

1098
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,360
Wait for him to respond.

1099
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,040
Remember what he said yesterday ?

1100
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,440
What ?

1101
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,200
About the shit on his bag.

1102
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,720
Let's go. We've gotta find
him. Come on.

1103
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,600
If we can't even find the car,
how are we gonna find Josh ?

1104
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,760
Come on.

1105
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,560
No, I'm fine.

1106
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,400
Come on, come on, relax.

1107
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,040
All right, let's take
Down the tent...

1108
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,880
...and when he's back, we'll go.

1109
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,920
I'm losing my mind, Mike.

1110
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,720
Josh hasn't come back.

1111
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,600
Heather ?

1112
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,040
I'm here, Mike.

1113
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,840
I don't know if Josh ran off.

1114
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,720
All his shit's here.

1115
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,800
I've got the camera...

1116
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,280
...I don't know how I'm
gonna hike with the camera.

1117
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,800
Sure you wanna take it ?

1118
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,080
We have to take the camera.

1119
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,720
How do you feel about east ?

1120
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,160
How do you feel ?

1121
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,000
Well, south didn't work.

1122
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,320
Which witch was worse, the one
from the east or from the south ?

1123
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,720
The witch of the
west was the bad one.

1124
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,440
Let's go east.

1125
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,200
What the hell is that ?

1126
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,560
Josh ?

1127
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,280
We'll have to put up the tent.

1128
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,680
I'd like a meatball.

1129
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,280
Just one meatball ?

1130
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,520
And a big glass of red wine.

1131
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,640
Yeah, I would like a whole
fucking bottle of Bordeaux.

1132
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,520
And a pack of smokes.

1133
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,320
That'd be good.
and a long, hot bath.

1134
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,920
And a big pumpkin pie.

1135
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,840
A pumpkin pie with ice cream ?

1136
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,400
Warm with milky ice cream ?

1137
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,800
Yeah, sounds good.

1138
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,520
What do you like
to do on a Sunday ?

1139
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,520
I used to like to drive to the
woods and go hiking.

1140
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,920
But I think that might change now.

1141
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,160
I think you could scratch that.

1142
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,640
Should we open the door ?

1143
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,400
Is it a trick ?

1144
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,640
Josh !

1145
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,480
Josh !

1146
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,840
Where's it coming from ?

1147
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,440
Josh, where are you ?
Tell me where you are !

1148
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,920
Oh my God, no.

1149
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,080
Do you think that's them again ?

1150
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,720
Is it over here ?

1151
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,560
No, it's over here.

1152
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,000
We'll look for him.

1153
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,720
I don't know if it's really him.

1154
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,640
I don't even know where to look.

1155
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,720
Tell me where you are, Josh !

1156
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,600
Mike ?

1157
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,880
- What ?
- Please don't fall asleep.

1158
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,440
I can't fall asleep.

1159
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,440
Whatever it is, it
knows Josh has gone.

1160
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,600
If that was Josh, he would've
said where he was.

1161
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,120
Whatever it was, it
sounded like Josh.

1162
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,080
See ?

1163
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,840
I just want to show you
that Mike's here.

1164
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,800
There. He's sleeping.

1165
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,640
Oh, shit.

1166
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,680
What the hell is that ?

1167
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,640
- Mike.
- What ?

1168
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,080
There's something out here.

1169
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,360
Okay,

1170
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,880
I'm gonna move it
from in front of the tent.

1171
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,920
- Get rid of it.
- Okay.

1172
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,120
I'm taking it away
from the tent.

1173
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,080
I'm just throwing it.

1174
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,200
We'll just keep walking, okay.

1175
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,440
Okay.

1176
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:43,000
I found some cigarettes
at the bottom of my pack...

1177
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,720
...so if we're smoking,
we're still alive.

1178
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,600
It's all full of blood.

1179
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,440
Shit, shit, shit !

1180
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,800
Oh my God !

1181
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,240
Okay, see...?

1182
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,480
Yeah ?

1183
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,080
What are you doing ?

1184
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,240
Just washing my hands !

1185
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,160
What ?

1186
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,800
Just washing my hands !

1187
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,680
I'm fine.

1188
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,880
I'm gonna put my gloves on.

1189
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,200
You all right ?

1190
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,040
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1191
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,480
You need help ?

1192
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,680
No, I don't need any help.

1193
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,880
I'm okay.

1194
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:16,680
What happened ?

1195
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:20,040
Nothing. I'm just very
hungry and very tired...

1196
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,640
...and very scared, and I just
wanna go home, okay ?

1197
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,560
Okay.

1198
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,600
But I'm fine, and we're okay.

1199
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,680
Ow ! My hair's caught.

1200
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,000
Thank you, thank you.

1201
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,440
Okay, okay.

1202
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,800
Two thousand one
hundred thirty games...

1203
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,960
...one more season and
Cal Ripken is king !

1204
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,240
And I won't see it...

1205
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,360
...because I'll be in the woods.

1206
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,240
Tell me you're not
eating a dry leaf.

1207
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,480
I just want to apologize...

1208
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,680
...to Mike's mom...

1209
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,360
...and Josh's mom...

1210
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,920
...and my mom...

1211
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,160
...and I'm sorry to everyone...

1212
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,320
...I was very naive.

1213
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:38,160
I am so, so, sorry...

1214
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,000
...for everything that's happened...

1215
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,040
...because in spite of
what Mike says now...

1216
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,400
...it was my fault...

1217
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,680
...because it was my project...

1218
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,240
...and I insisted...

1219
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,600
...insisted on everything.

1220
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,200
I insisted we weren't lost...

1221
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,160
...I insisted we keep going...

1222
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:06,400
...I insisted we walk south.

1223
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,560
Everything had
to be my way.

1224
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,000
And this is how we've ended up.

1225
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,280
And it's all because of me
that we're here now...

1226
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,880
...hungry and cold...

1227
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,720
...and hunted.

1228
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,320
I love you, mom...

1229
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,640
...dad...

1230
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,160
...I am so sorry.

1231
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,560
...what was that ?

1232
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,040
I'm scared to close my eyes...

1233
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,800
...and scared to open them.

1234
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,080
Oh God...

1235
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,440
...we're gonna die here.

1236
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,840
- You got it ?
- You ready ?

1237
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,160
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1238
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,280
You ready ?

1239
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,320
Here, take this light.

1240
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,800
That can't be him.

1241
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,680
Holy shit, it's a house.

1242
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,600
- Watch your step.
- Holy shit, Holy shit...

1243
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,680
Josh ?

1244
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,160
Mike. Mike.

1245
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,640
Come on.

1246
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,240
Mike, where the fuck are you ?

1247
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,320
Come on, I'm in the house !

1248
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,240
Mike, don't go in there, please !

1249
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,680
Mike, please !
Mike, where are you ?

1250
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,920
I'm right here !

1251
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,920
Where is he ?

1252
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,920
Mike, please don't.

1253
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,000
Is he in here ?

1254
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,040
No.

1255
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,160
Oh, Jesus.

1256
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,520
Where is he ?

1257
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,440
Are you gonna go upstairs ?

1258
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,360
I hear him. I hear him.

1259
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,640
I hear you. Josh !

1260
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,360
I'm going upstairs.

1261
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,760
Oh, God, oh.

1262
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,280
Hear that ?

1263
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,320
Where is he ?

1264
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,280
Where are you ?

1265
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,560
Come on !

1266
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,120
I'm getting downstairs.

1267
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,760
Come on, I hear him, downstairs !

1268
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,600
Mike !

1269
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,640
Come on !

1270
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,520
Mike !

1271
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,480
Josh !

1272
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,880
Wait !

1273
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:17,040
Josh, is that you down there ?

1274
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,600
