1
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,057
Don't give up.

2
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,811
Oh, I never do.

3
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,942
May I?

4
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,455
You work with your
hands, don't you?

5
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,263
- Redhead.
- Luther.

6
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,192
Your life would be a
whole lot simpler

7
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,485
if you could learn
to operate a VCR.

8
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,197
True. Truer words
were never spoken.

9
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,566
What's that?

10
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,821
Here we go.

11
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,789
That is nice.

12
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,387
It's okay. He's not here.

13
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,141
Anyway, I told him
that I was sick.

14
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,811
So you can relax.

15
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,073
Cheers.

16
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,337
I'll be right back.

17
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,913
You like that? Do you?

18
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,040
Oh, yeah.

19
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,316
So you wanna play, huh?

20
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,870
You okay?

21
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,710
How would you like that?

22
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,588
- You slap...
- Don't slap me.

23
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,839
You little bitch.

24
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,758
Alan, what are you doing?

25
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,051
Alan.

26
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,095
Alan.

27
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,641
Alan, you're hurting me.

28
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,102
I'll hurt you, goddamn it.

29
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,940
Alan.

30
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,775
You're hurting me.

31
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,026
Goddamn you.

32
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,444
You wanna be hurt?

33
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,737
I'll hurt you.

34
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,490
Ow.

35
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,158
You like this?

36
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,618
- Let go.
- Do you?

37
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,869
You like that?

38
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,456
Goddamn you.

39
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,125
God...

40
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,878
- Son of a bitch.
- Get away.

41
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,755
Get back here.

42
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,258
Get back here.

43
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,301
Stop it.

44
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,096
Stop it. Alan.

45
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,140
What are you doing?

46
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,903
Bitch...

47
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,072
you wanna play? I'll show you how.

48
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,740
You fucking bastard.

49
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,202
You bastard.

50
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,250
You like that?

51
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,964
- Come back here.
- Don't. Let go of me.

52
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,126
Bitch, you cut me, goddamn it.

53
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,878
Fucking asshole.

54
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,546
I'm gonna kill you.

55
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,342
Help. Help.

56
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,020
Help.

57
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,209
Did you kill her?

58
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,712
No choice in the matter, sir.

59
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,800
What am I gonna do?

60
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,180
Jesus, Tim. What do we do?

61
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,723
No choice in the matter.

62
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,731
What the hell was that?

63
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,194
Oh, shit.

64
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,364
Oh, my God.

65
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,621
Oh, my God.

66
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,882
Do you realise what a
shitstorm we're in?

67
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,972
Go on, tell me.

68
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,058
Nothing to tell. He
screamed for help.

69
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,812
You heard no sounds of
violence till then?

70
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,939
Nothing we haven't heard before.

71
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,179
Maybe I should call
the police now.

72
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,701
Oh, Jesus. What?

73
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,912
Bill...

74
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,623
why don't you think about that?

75
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,500
Just take a second...

76
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,753
and think about that.

77
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,591
Think real...

78
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,092
fucking...

79
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,594
hard.

80
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,643
Probably not a good idea.

81
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,441
Okay.

82
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,029
Okay.

83
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,787
Okay.

84
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,498
Here's what happened.

85
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,876
Poor Christy...

86
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,797
came home alone and
interrupted a burglary.

87
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,465
Sound logical?

88
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,966
- Yeah.
- Sure.

89
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,474
We have to sanitise this place.

90
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,063
Alan. Did you have sex with her?

91
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,565
I don't know.

92
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:25,152
Bill, you're gonna
have to examine her.

93
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,239
- I'm no gynaecologist.
- I just made you one.

94
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,991
Christ.

95
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,819
I'll take that.

96
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,321
- It has both fingerprints.
- Thanks for sharing.

97
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,158
Gloria.

98
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,578
Gloria.

99
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,937
Did I kill her?

100
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:20,166
Everything's gonna be fine, Alan.

101
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,917
Just don't worry about it.

102
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,795
- Oh, God.
- Now be careful.

103
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,047
Just don't get blood on you.

104
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:33,220
I'll take care of everything,
okay? Just like I always do.

105
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,570
- Oh, shit.
- What?

106
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,324
Madame's purse.

107
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,260
- Miss Russell, let me get him.
- Thank you.

108
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,610
- I got him, Bill.
- All right.

109
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,321
Nice and easy, sir.

110
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,064
Oh, my God.

111
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,029
No knife.

112
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,655
- What?
- Where's the knife?

113
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,034
In the bedroom.

114
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,411
- Come on.
- Get up there.

115
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,790
- Shit.
- Shit.

116
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,735
Go.

117
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,616
Excuse me.

118
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,254
I got the number.

119
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,470
Gee, guys, maybe it
was the bogeyman.

120
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,600
Don't forget to check under the
bed. You may have buried us.

121
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,310
Look, I got his licence number.

122
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,229
You think he'll sit
around waiting for us?

123
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,731
Look, take it easy.

124
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,609
Everybody, shut up, all right?

125
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,201
What have you got?

126
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,121
Oh, boy.

127
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,097
Wow.

128
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,644
Two-way mirror.

129
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,980
We better get cracking
on that licence number.

130
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,483
That's all we've got.

131
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,777
He's got the letter opener.

132
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,445
Blood...

133
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,322
fingerprints.

134
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,075
Jesus.

135
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,118
Think what he can do.

136
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:39,289
The man's a thief. A thief
who witnessed a murder.

137
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,626
It looks like he stole a
whole bunch of money.

138
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,214
I'll tell you what he's gonna do.

139
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,133
He's gonna run like hell.

140
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,940
They beat us by seven.

141
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,817
By seven?

142
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,362
Who'd have thought that?

143
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,786
Oh, Kate.

144
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,246
Kate.

145
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,998
Kate.

146
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,723
I guess it'd be a
little late for me.

147
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,309
The jogging, I mean.

148
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,523
Kind of dumb way to
start, isn't it?

149
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,943
But I did want to talk to you.

150
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,445
About?

151
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,324
The weather, actually.

152
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,618
It's getting cool in the evenings.

153
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,788
That happens this time of year.

154
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,917
I was thinking...

155
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,296
of moving to a kinder,
more gentle climate.

156
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,883
I thought I'd talk with you, since
you're the only family I have.

157
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,886
Luther, you don't have me.

158
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,805
Kate...

159
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,057
You know what it's like
to be the only kid...

160
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,392
who got to talk
about visiting day?

161
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,734
This move, it would be a
permanent one, you understand.

162
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,988
We never see each other anyway.

163
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,783
We haven't since Mum
died. That's a year.

164
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,915
Look, you chose your life.
You had that right.

165
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,709
You were never
around for me. Fine.

166
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,379
I have no plans to
be around for you.

167
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,882
Kate...

168
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,218
Wait a minute. Wait.

169
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,804
You're lying, aren't you?

170
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,430
No.

171
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,976
Are you active again? Is
that why you're here now?

172
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,395
No.

173
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,273
I don't believe you.

174
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,570
Oh, Christ.

175
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,613
Father, what have you done?

176
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,299
Christy Sullivan?

177
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,550
Wife of Walter.

178
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,928
Most likely came home,
stumbled onto a burglary.

179
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,640
Some burglary. I wish my
carpets were this clean.

180
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,018
I couldn't find a single
decent fingerprint.

181
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,438
- Are you serious, Laura?
- It's like Mary Poppins was here.

182
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,856
Where's Mr Sullivan?

183
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,107
Sorry, Seth.

184
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,986
The entire Sullivan household
went to Barbados two days ago.

185
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,655
Thanks for your support.

186
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,866
Oh, no, wait. It gets worse.

187
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,576
The shots came from here.

188
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,621
If she stumbled on a burglary,
she should've been here.

189
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,956
But she was killed
exactly where she is.

190
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,876
See, the blood patterns
indicate that.

191
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,004
What is she doing here?

192
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:04,137
Looks like someone sat here, but
I couldn't find any prints.

193
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,558
So you think old man Sullivan
holed up in this chair...

194
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,810
and watched his wife perform?

195
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,730
God, I hope not.

196
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,858
For his sake. You know,
he's such a great man.

197
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,611
Be careful digging that out.

198
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,863
Looks like he tried
to strangle her.

199
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,408
Then he went to the door
to shoot her from behind?

200
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,662
He also inspected her vagina.

201
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,958
He did what?

202
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,417
Why?

203
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,087
Maybe he didn't remember
that he did her.

204
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,760
A strong burglar with a weak mind.

205
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,888
Obviously, it's another
open-and-shut case.

206
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,556
We can expect tomorrow's
temperatures...

207
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,893
to climb into the 70s
with lows around 50.

208
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,229
Turner will start things
off for the Cougars.

209
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,523
The kick... Nice kick.

210
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,443
Kirby, back to receive, takes
the ball at the 12-yard line.

211
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,445
He's got a wedge in front of him.

212
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,947
- One man to beat.
- He's going all the way.

213
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,950
Nothing but clear sailing now.

214
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,285
Six points.

215
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,355
Mr Sullivan.

216
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,690
Sorry to bother you.

217
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:06,236
I'm Seth Frank, senior homicide
detective, Middletown County.

218
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,322
My client is in no mood
for conversations.

219
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,199
It's all right, Sandy.

220
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,244
You're in charge of
the case, Mr Frank?

221
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,578
Yes, sir.

222
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,081
I've gotta ask you
a few questions.

223
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,250
What do you want?

224
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,294
Positive identification?

225
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,588
Yes...

226
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,091
that was my wife.

227
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:29,926
Anything else?

228
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,513
You'd been in Barbados
for two days.

229
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:36,349
I took the staff, always
do this time of year.

230
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,309
Your wife didn't come with you.

231
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,395
Well, she was.

232
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,230
Had it all planned.

233
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,566
But you know women.

234
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,860
She changed her mind.

235
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,907
I'd been married to my
Rebecca for 47 years.

236
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,618
When she died...

237
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,789
I decided I never
wanted that pain again.

238
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,751
One thing I knew about Christy...

239
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,463
she was going to outlive me.

240
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,340
I think that's enough for today.

241
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,719
Sir, I have to ask
you about the vault.

242
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,973
You mean, the contents
of the vault, of course.

243
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,812
Sandy, you go on.

244
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,272
- Walter.
- No, really.

245
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,900
I'm all right. You go
on to the reception.

246
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,445
Obviously, I can't make it.

247
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,739
I'm sure everyone will understand.

248
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,201
You don't mean the contents.

249
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,161
No.

250
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,537
You mean the chair.

251
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,249
You must ask about the chair.

252
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,793
Yes, sir. I do.

253
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,087
Why? Are they connected?

254
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,904
Someone may have been
sitting in it and

255
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:52,634
may have been involved
in the murder.

256
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:59,349
I have the deepest respect for
you. I'm sorry to have to do this.

257
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,977
I promise you, none of this
will make my highlight reel.

258
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,731
Well, I hoped I could satisfy her.

259
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,816
But, you know...

260
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,110
she had needs.

261
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,072
She didn't want to
go behind my back.

262
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,409
She suggested the chair.

263
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,163
She hoped I might get
to like sitting there.

264
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,040
I didn't.

265
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,088
For 80 years, I've
tried to live...

266
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,799
a decent life.

267
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,718
I've given a billion
dollars to charity.

268
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,804
If this comes to trial...

269
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,306
none of that will be remembered.

270
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,017
I'll just go out...

271
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,103
the joke of the world.

272
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,856
I understand, sir.
I'll do what I can.

273
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,359
Would you listen to me whine?

274
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,612
I apologise, Mr Frank.

275
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,074
Just do your job and
I'll try to do mine.

276
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,701
Yes, sir.

277
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,748
I'm sorry, sir.

278
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:38,156
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president.

279
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,118
Sandy.

280
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:43,870
Mr President.

281
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,916
- Take a walk with me.
- Certainly, sir.

282
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,962
Tell me about Walter. How is he?

283
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,883
Well, he's 80 and
alone, Mr President.

284
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:00,178
He understands that
officially my hands are tied.

285
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,514
Yes, but he's very moved
by your concern, sir.

286
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,476
- Any news of the killer?
- No.

287
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,145
Why isn't there? Who's
in charge of this?

288
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,730
The top man.

289
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,858
He spent eight years,
homicide work, in New York.

290
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,487
I understand how you feel.
It's hard to be patient.

291
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,656
No one understands how I feel.

292
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,533
I'm supposed to have
all this power...

293
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,411
and I can't even help
my oldest friend.

294
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,352
You and I know, more than any man

295
00:44:28,353 --> 00:44:30,458
alive, Walter
Sullivan put me here.

296
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,628
Now when he needs me most...

297
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,881
Well, he must feel abandoned.

298
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,514
I'll have a press conference.

299
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,601
I'll have Walter come and I'll
embrace him in front of the world.

300
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,188
He'll treasure that, Mr President.

301
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,693
What a generous gesture.

302
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,736
Thank you, sir.

303
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,288
Tennis elbow.

304
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,049
This thing is getting
worse, Gloria.

305
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,968
I need to see a doctor.

306
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,263
The country would have to
be informed, Mr President.

307
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,182
What happened to my
rights to privacy?

308
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,102
I think she nicked a tendon.

309
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,063
Bill says it's a flesh wound.

310
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,735
Since when did you
become an expert, Bill?

311
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,445
You ever been wounded?

312
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,363
Yes, sir. A few times.

313
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,413
You're serious about this
press conference, Alan?

314
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,165
Of course I am.

315
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,542
Walter's like a father to me.

316
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,670
Shall I bring Mrs
Richmond home for it?

317
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,174
I don't think Mrs
Richmond's mission...

318
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,177
to help the poor in Asia
needs to be interrupted.

319
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,430
What do we know so far?

320
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,142
We've checked his licence plates.

321
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:14,103
He stole the car from a
police impoundment lot.

322
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,232
We're not dealing with
a fool here, are we?

323
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,318
Has he initiated contact?

324
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,237
Burton doesn't think he will.

325
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,574
I agree.

326
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,660
I apologise for my behaviour.
Won't happen again.

327
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,413
Consider it a blip on the screen.

328
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:34,957
As far as I'm concerned,
that's all he is too.

329
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,503
He could be a little
more than that, Alan.

330
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,046
He saw.

331
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,319
He saw nothing. He
saw a drunk woman

332
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,383
who liked rough sex too much.

333
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,428
He's a burglar. Who's
gonna believe him?

334
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,765
After all, it's not as if he
has any evidence or anything.

335
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,380
He's a burglar. Who's
gonna believe him?

336
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,591
After all, it's not as if he
has any evidence or anything.

337
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,703
Boy, you always did
disappear good, Luther.

338
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,206
What you're trying to say is
I have a weak face, right?

339
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,292
No, I'm saying
you're lucky is all.

340
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,879
Some of my customers, no matter
what I do, they still stand out.

341
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,131
How many passports you want?

342
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,467
Four ought to do the trick.

343
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:53,429
You want different looks, matching
international driver's licences.

344
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,223
Since it's you, I'll throw
in some dummy credit cards.

345
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,601
How are the rugs I
made you holding up?

346
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,604
Good. The moustaches
and the beards also.

347
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,523
Well, we try to give
quality for our money.

348
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,777
You leaving the country
for permanent?

349
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,904
That could be, yeah.

350
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,637
Does it matter where
you've been? I

351
00:49:13,638 --> 00:49:15,701
hate doing Asian passport stamps.

352
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,286
No. Make it European.

353
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:21,707
Caribbean in the wintertime. How
long is all this gonna take?

354
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,670
It usually takes some time.
For you, I'll rush it.

355
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,340
You were always
dependable, Valerie.

356
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,759
Listen, Luther...

357
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,261
I don't wanna know
what you're into.

358
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,514
I do, but I'm not
gonna ask you. But

359
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,557
leaving the country forever...

360
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,351
What is it?

361
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,145
I just never figured
you for a runner.

362
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,983
Thirty percent of my runners kill
themselves within five years.

363
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,905
Right now, five years
doesn't sound too bad.

364
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,783
Take care.

365
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,661
See you.

366
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,998
Okay, see if this makes any sense.

367
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,291
I am Christy Sullivan.

368
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,253
I come in the bedroom and
I surprise a burglar.

369
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,839
Okay. Okay, now you're the burglar

370
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,216
coming out of the vault
being surprised.

371
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,552
Gold star. I draw my gun. Boom.

372
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:17,596
Then why bother to strangle her
when you could just shoot?

373
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,225
Why do I bother to strip her
and put her clothes back on?

374
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,102
There, I can help you out.

375
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,939
You used to be a dry cleaner and
you love beautiful clothes.

376
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,692
Thanks a lot. And you
dress her because...

377
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,111
She was a good customer
and you didn't

378
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,321
want her embarrassed
when police came.

379
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,992
She had a 0.21
blood-alcohol level.

380
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,743
Not that that makes
any difference.

381
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,536
She didn't drive.

382
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:44,123
The chauffeurs, they keep
exact mileage on these cars.

383
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,417
They haven't been driven
since they went to Barbados.

384
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,065
I checked every cab
and limo service

385
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:49,545
in the area. Nobody knows a thing.

386
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,007
Somebody drove her home. Who?

387
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,967
Why haven't they come forward?

388
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,845
Maybe because whoever drove
her home killed her.

389
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,684
Maybe. I love this case.

390
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,019
Lieutenant?

391
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,105
Sorry to bother you, but
the phone problems?

392
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,024
- I just took care of them.
- Thank you.

393
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,693
Just part of the job.

394
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,425
I hate people who
say that. It's not

395
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:17,281
part... It is your fucking job.

396
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,867
Remember the bullet
hole in the wall?

397
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,160
- Yeah.
- Guess what.

398
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,578
No slug.

399
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,664
Why take a slug out of the wall

400
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,582
when there's one
stuck in her head?

401
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,751
Different from the
one in her body?

402
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:32,505
Two different guns
means two burglars.

403
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,756
Two guys broke in?

404
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,217
They both went out the
window? Bullshit.

405
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,283
By the way, why did
he or they go out

406
00:51:39,284 --> 00:51:41,305
the window in the first place...

407
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,433
when he or they got in by breaking

408
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,351
a zillion-dollar security system?

409
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,977
- Hey, Seth.
- Yeah?

410
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,855
Bill Burton from the Secret
Service in the parking lot.

411
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,984
Thanks, Bob. What's he
doing in the parking lot?

412
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,702
Bill Burton. Hi.

413
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,705
Hi. Seth Frank. To what
do I owe the honour?

414
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,457
I know you must be going crazy...

415
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,544
but the boss is very interested
about your progress.

416
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,587
Maybe we could help
each other out.

417
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,464
What do you have in mind?

418
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,300
Well, you know how close
he and Sullivan are.

419
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,718
Right.

420
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:26,267
The minute anything breaks, if you
call me, I'd tell the president.

421
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,853
He'd be the first to
alert Mr Sullivan.

422
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,479
- It'd mean a lot to him.
- Okay.

423
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,816
Any red tape you want cut, done.

424
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,735
Here's my numbers.

425
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,363
Any leads?

426
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,740
We're still trying to
figure out what happened.

427
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,994
- I love playing Sherlock Holmes.
- You guys do that?

428
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,997
I was a state trooper before
the government got me.

429
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,207
Wait. You're that Bill Burton?

430
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,503
- I was younger and dumber then.
- I was younger. I'm dumber now.

431
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,338
Keep in touch.

432
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,576
My chef makes them
especially for me.

433
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,454
I promise you, they're sinful.

434
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,582
You're a salesman, Mr Sullivan.

435
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,336
This is a new arena for me.

436
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:39,590
But from what I'm told, you
have a flawless reputation.

437
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,010
Which is why I need to
employ you, Mr McCarty.

438
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,220
Understood.

439
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,473
I don't know who it
is I'm after yet.

440
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,225
Until I do...

441
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,936
you'll have to wait in
Washington for instructions.

442
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,398
Afraid that's out of the question.

443
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,360
Mine is not creative work.

444
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,238
I only do it because I enjoy
living beyond my means.

445
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,490
I can't afford to just sit around.

446
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,787
My father died when
I was 10 years old.

447
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:13,165
He was a miner. He
died of lung disease.

448
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,502
I became rich at 25.

449
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:20,172
The first thing I did was buy
that mine, close it down...

450
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:24,551
and give every miner
$50,000 to retire on.

451
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,432
You will wait in
Washington, Mr McCarty.

452
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,979
And I will put 1 million
dollars' expenses...

453
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,231
in a Swiss bank of your choosing.

454
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,858
And when the time comes...

455
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:42,528
2 million dollars a bullet.

456
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,782
You are a salesman, sir.

457
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,704
Selling sin is easy.

458
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,838
- Who is he?
- It's Luther Whitney...

459
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,549
one of the great
thieves of the world.

460
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,760
I've been going nuts.
I was up all night.

461
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,515
I remembered your notion how
maybe it was two burglars.

462
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:15,227
Around dawn, I thought, "What
if it's not two burglars...

463
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,605
but just one guy trying to
make it look like two?"

464
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,526
I called my buddy at the
Bureau. They keep track.

465
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,612
There's only half a
dozen guys alive who

466
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,488
could've pulled off
the Sullivan job.

467
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,365
I've been tracing all six.

468
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,617
Whitney's the only
guy that lives here.

469
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:33,329
So why is it I never heard of him?

470
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,372
He hasn't been
arrested in 30 years.

471
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,375
So, what's this? His graduation
picture from Harvard?

472
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,628
That's ancient history. He was
just a punk, part of a gang.

473
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,380
Three-time loser.

474
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,090
Since he got out last
the last time...

475
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,134
no one's touched him.

476
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,471
When something big comes up, they

477
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,306
question him, but
nothing ever sticks.

478
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:56,101
Oh, Seth. We can make this stick.

479
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,395
I bet you this is our guy.

480
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:01,357
He's a local. You can't
ask for anything more.

481
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,151
Yeah, well, we got a problem.

482
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,486
What?

483
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,697
He hasn't killed
anyone in 45 years.

484
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:10,991
Korea.

485
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,659
So what? He's a veteran.

486
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,121
Not just a veteran,
he's a wounded veteran.

487
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,207
I got his war record here.

488
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,586
Battles, commendations,
decorations up the kazoo.

489
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,589
He lives alone on his disability.

490
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,092
That's what he says anyway.

491
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,388
But I just don't see this guy as a
killer. He's just a great thief.

492
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,307
And besides, I don't
do war heroes.

493
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,272
Boy, you must be smart.

494
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,066
Pardon me?

495
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,154
It usually takes you guys
a week to get to me.

496
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,032
Oh, Seth Frank.

497
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:37,453
I recognise your picture
from the newspaper.

498
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,329
Luther Whitney.

499
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,623
Nice to meet you.

500
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,668
Would you like a signed
confession now...

501
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,212
or would you like to have
a little coffee first?

502
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,841
Before I send you away for life, I

503
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:52,259
should probably check
out your alibi.

504
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,387
I was watching a
football game with

505
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,263
an old friend of
mine, Red Bransford.

506
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,724
He owns a saloon here in town.

507
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,477
You can ask me about the game.

508
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,520
I could be lying.

509
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,231
You been following the case?

510
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,649
Yeah, I have.

511
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,776
I love true crime.

512
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:13,780
FBI says there's only a few guys
who could have handled this job.

513
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,450
I got a list here. You're on it.

514
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,535
How I wish it were true.

515
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,166
This person, they go
in the front door...

516
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,503
and out a window, and down a
rope in the middle of the night?

517
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,049
Now, if I could do
something like that,

518
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,759
I'd be the star of
my AARP meetings.

519
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:38,972
- What's that? The American...
- Association of Retired Persons.

520
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,769
Luther, why was this so difficult?

521
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:47,147
You want me to help
you solve your case?

522
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,024
Just looking for insight.

523
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,651
How would you?

524
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,029
Scratch that. How would
one go about it?

525
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,698
What kind of person
should I be looking for?

526
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,537
Well, except for the rope trick,
an older person, like me.

527
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,372
Because?

528
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,874
Well, you need patience.

529
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,419
The secret is research, research
and research. I've read that.

530
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,421
What kind of research?

531
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:16,718
Well, from what I saw on the tube,
this is a rather large home.

532
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,346
Must be an architectural office.

533
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,599
You'd go to the library, go
through public records...

534
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,581
find out where that architectural

535
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:26,311
office is and break in.

536
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,065
And then you Xerox the plans
and get them back by morning.

537
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,276
Why not just steal them?

538
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,112
Anyone can break into an
office, but breaking in...

539
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,615
without having people know you
were there, that's the trick.

540
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,326
Then there's the
general contractor.

541
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,037
And then there's the
security company.

542
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,812
Do you realise the
skill of breaking

543
00:59:46,813 --> 00:59:49,209
the security of a
security company?

544
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,170
I don't know how those guys do it.

545
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:56,341
Why go to all that
trouble, Luther?

546
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,032
There's a vault in
the house. There

547
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,929
must be a secret way into it.

548
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,181
Yeah, there was. That's
what I don't get.

549
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,142
How do you mean?

550
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,645
This guy obviously did the
research you're talking about.

551
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,731
So why does he take a crowbar...

552
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,566
to open up this vault when there's

553
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,192
a clicker sitting right there?

554
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,402
A clicker?

555
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,655
Well, a gizmo, like a VCR remote.

556
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,452
Sounds amazing to me.

557
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,623
Must've been a lot of
valuables in that vault.

558
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:34,087
Close to 5 million total value.

559
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,507
Is that funny?

560
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,968
Why do I feel like you're
trying to surprise me?

561
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,511
I was trying to surprise you.

562
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

563
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,434
There you go again.

564
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,774
Would the burglar use a disguise?

565
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,567
Yeah, he might.

566
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,029
You gotta get with the program
if you're gonna catch this guy.

567
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,075
It is a guy, we think, anyway.
Some sort of a loner? Weirdo?

568
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,618
Maybe like you.

569
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:09,331
Well, I'd be the perfect
prototype, actually.

570
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,333
Except you see a
person's face around

571
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,126
long enough and put
things together.

572
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:16,463
That's why these top
guys have disguises.

573
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,092
Some of them, I even understand,
become make-up experts...

574
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,302
hire wigmakers and
things like that.

575
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,013
Why don't you go on
about the wigmakers?

576
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,015
Well, I would.

577
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:29,559
I've gotta go have my
pacemaker checked.

578
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,229
It's been so exciting
talking to you.

579
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,400
A, you don't have a pacemaker.
And B, I'll be back tomorrow.

580
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,404
Tomorrow is promised to no one.

581
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,991
Goodbye.

582
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,082
Pacemaker, my ass.

583
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,895
Oh, Katie.

584
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,607
You gotta start eating
better than this, darling.

585
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,071
I'm having this press
conference here...

586
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,242
because it is here,
at this courthouse...

587
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,892
that Christine Sullivan's killer

588
01:03:11,893 --> 01:03:13,622
will be tried for his crime.

589
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:17,167
As you know, I came from
an impoverished family...

590
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,545
in an impoverished town.

591
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,423
We lived with our doors...

592
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,300
unlocked.

593
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,845
We all lock our doors now.

594
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,807
- That's not what concerns me.
- A ginger ale.

595
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,309
We are also locking our hearts.

596
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,977
And could you turn that off?

597
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,188
- That is the sadness.
- In a second.

598
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:39,606
That...

599
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,191
is the loss.

600
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,778
We are locking our hearts
to the cries of the weary.

601
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:47,447
We are locking our hearts...

602
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:50,116
to the poor and their pain.

603
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,452
Sisters and brothers...

604
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,372
we are locking our
hearts to ourselves.

605
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,127
Turn it back on.

606
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,922
- But you just said...
- I know, but turn it on.

607
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:11,138
We feel that savagery and violence

608
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,390
must be allowed a place at table.

609
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,559
That is wrong. That
is not America.

610
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,144
I shall fight that battle.

611
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,938
Dear friend...

612
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,023
old friend...

613
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,237
we shall fight that battle.

614
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,327
Who can explain the
ways of chance?

615
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,247
If we had not met...

616
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,749
I would not be president today.

617
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:43,211
If Christine had not taken ill...

618
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,423
she would be with you
in Barbados even now.

619
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,759
Walter, you've been
like a father to me.

620
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:56,433
I would give the world
to lessen your pain.

621
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,159
Thank you.

622
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,997
You heartless whore.

623
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,377
I'm not about to run from you.

624
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:31,593
Thomas Jefferson used the
Green Room as a dining room.

625
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,012
The walls are covered
with green silk...

626
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,140
just as they were when James
Monroe was president.

627
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,685
Many valuable objects and
paintings in this room.

628
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,812
We'll be moving on
to the Blue Room.

629
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:47,233
James Hoban built the
Blue Room as an oval...

630
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,819
to please President Washington.

631
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,989
During the holidays, the
chandelier is removed...

632
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,971
and the White House Christmas tree

633
01:05:54,972 --> 01:05:56,701
stands in the middle of the room.

634
01:05:56,953 --> 01:06:00,372
The view from the window
includes the Jefferson Memorial.

635
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,958
We'll be moving on
to the Red Room.

636
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:09,547
The walls of the Red Room
are covered with red silk.

637
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:13,343
Many musical gatherings took place
here back in the 19th century.

638
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:18,306
He was in the building.
He took a guided tour.

639
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,940
I've never dealt with
blackmail before.

640
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:29,047
He doesn't want money.

641
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:30,902
Oh, you're a mind reader too now.

642
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,613
No, I just looked on the back.

643
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,740
See?

644
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,659
"I don't want money."

645
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,537
This guy sure has the guts of
a burglar. Wish we had him.

646
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,580
Finished your recruiting speech?

647
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,918
Because I'd like to
know how I handle this.

648
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,462
Like you handled
the letter opener?

649
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:58,221
Gee, Bill...

650
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,102
that could be construed
as criticism.

651
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,064
You really want me for an enemy?

652
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,150
Ms Russell, I should've called the

653
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,776
police that night but I was weak.

654
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,779
You convinced me to stay
silent. I regret that.

655
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,827
Every time I see your face, I
wanna rip your throat out.

656
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,502
Fine.

657
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:34,090
You win the pissing contest.

658
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,687
What do I do?

659
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,147
Nothing.

660
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,108
Because he's making
a terrible mistake.

661
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,859
He thinks he has time. He doesn't.

662
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,862
Seth Frank's too good.
He'll bring him in.

663
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,781
Then what?

664
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,533
Then I kill him.

665
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:09,584
Miss Whitney?

666
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,211
Thanks.

667
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,347
Miss Whitney?

668
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:25,934
I'm Seth Frank. Excuse me.

669
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,602
Hi.

670
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,521
Hi.

671
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,359
Thanks.

672
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:41,866
For a tough prosecutor, you sure
don't resemble your reputation.

673
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,494
Is that good or bad?

674
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:49,791
I don't know.

675
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:55,004
Look, lieutenant, I
told you on the phone.

676
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:56,965
I'm not involved with my father.

677
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,676
So this may not be a waste of
time for you, but it is for me.

678
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,138
What do you expect me to do,
get up and walk out of here?

679
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:06,683
All right.

680
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,228
All right.

681
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,939
Your father disappeared.

682
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,194
- I need your help.
- Look.

683
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,697
Lieutenant, I don't know the man.

684
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:23,012
He was in jail.
When he got out, my

685
01:09:23,013 --> 01:09:25,076
mother and I went to
live by ourselves.

686
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,579
We don't make contact. He
doesn't care about me.

687
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,831
I've seen him all of
once this past year.

688
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:31,499
Yeah, when?

689
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,627
A couple days ago.

690
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,402
He said he might be leaving town.

691
01:09:37,403 --> 01:09:39,257
There, I helped you.
Can I work now?

692
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,178
- Any idea where he might've gone?
- Quit wasting my time.

693
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,471
He doesn't want you to
find him, you won't.

694
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,974
You're saying, what, he
skipped the country?

695
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,602
I'm saying you won't
recognise him.

696
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:53,521
He could be right
around the corner.

697
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,358
- He always had a safe house.
- Where?

698
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,278
- He never said.
- How do you know he had one?

699
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,865
My mother loved him, all right?

700
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:06,264
Even after she left
him, even when she

701
01:10:06,265 --> 01:10:08,453
was dying, he was all
she talked about.

702
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,748
"If only he hadn't done this.

703
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,667
- If only he hadn't done that."
- What else?

704
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,883
- How long has he lived here?
- Years.

705
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,426
Never been.

706
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,975
This is a strange place for
a thief to leave a key.

707
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,228
He always did that.

708
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,932
He sure left in a
hurry. I wonder what

709
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:54,142
scares a professional
thief like that.

710
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:08,114
He wasn't at these places.

711
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:12,493
My college graduation...

712
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,665
my law school graduation, the
night my mother and I...

713
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:22,086
we went out to celebrate because
I'd gotten my first job.

714
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,465
Me alone on the steps. I'd
just won my first case.

715
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,346
I used to think, sometimes...

716
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,874
Sometimes I'd come
home and I could

717
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:40,021
sense that he'd been
in the apartment.

718
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:42,732
Looking at my things,
checking the refrigerator...

719
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,526
shaking his head because he
never thought I ate right.

720
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:50,656
I mean, I know it sounds
crazy, but I've always...

721
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:53,576
I've always felt
that he was around.

722
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,621
You can do a good thing.
Help me bring him in.

723
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,998
Just leave a message
you're worried about him.

724
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,541
No.

725
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:03,628
It's true. You are worried.
This is not a normal case.

726
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,964
His life could be in danger. You
make the call, you can save him.

727
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,841
He won't come.

728
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,511
Of course he'll come.
You're all he has.

729
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,348
He's on the run and he's scared
because he's gonna get caught.

730
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:18,309
- You don't know the heat on this.
- He's not a murderer.

731
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,853
Maybe he is innocent.

732
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,232
If that's the case, I'll have
him home in a few hours.

733
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,007
What happens if
some hotshot trying

734
01:13:28,008 --> 01:13:29,821
to make a reputation
tracks him down?

735
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,784
I can guarantee his safety.

736
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,537
You make the call,
I'll make a promise.

737
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,580
You'll have your father back.

738
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:00,518
- Seth Frank.
- Hi.

739
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,646
I called. I left a
message on his machine.

740
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:05,982
He called me back
within the hour and

741
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:08,067
I'm meeting him
tomorrow afternoon.

742
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:09,861
Where?

743
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:14,031
Open-air place near my
office, Cafe Alonzo.

744
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:15,783
What time?

745
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,035
Four o'clock.

746
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,955
It'll be deserted then.

747
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:24,292
Sounds good. Thanks a lot.

748
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,377
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

749
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:17,428
Dad, hi.

750
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,764
It's Kate calling.

751
01:15:19,973 --> 01:15:23,976
I was wondering if you
could call me, please.

752
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:29,148
There's some things I'd like
to talk with you about...

753
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,818
and maybe even get together,
if that's possible.

754
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,362
Okay?

755
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:38,115
Thanks and talk to you soon. Bye.

756
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,746
Dad, hi.

757
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,082
It's Kate calling.

758
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:50,628
I was wondering if you
could call me, please.

759
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:55,424
There's some things I'd like
to talk with you about...

760
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,051
and maybe even get together.

761
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,745
You all know where
you're supposed to be

762
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,496
and when you're
supposed to be there.

763
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,582
This guy's slippery.
He's like an eel.

764
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:30,042
He gets a whiff of a cop,
he's gonna disappear.

765
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,169
Nobody moves until you
get the order from me.

766
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,255
Then we move in on him.

767
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:36,737
Expect Whitney to
show up at 4:00. His

768
01:16:36,738 --> 01:16:38,968
daughter will be waiting for him.

769
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:41,846
The important thing is to
stay in your positions...

770
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,890
until you hear the order
to move in on him.

771
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,343
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks. Could I have some cream?

772
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:39,695
Gather around, gentlemen.

773
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,282
Nobody makes a move till
the suspect's in place.

774
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:44,992
Any questions?

775
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,411
See you at the Alonzo.

776
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:49,080
Boss is grateful.

777
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,832
I figured he'd appreciate an
eyewitness at the capture.

778
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,085
This is our guy.

779
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:57,505
If he isn't, he sure disappeared
awful fast. See you over there.

780
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,298
All right.

781
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,966
Tums?

782
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,469
I got my own.

783
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:49,617
Come on, Kate.

784
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,536
- She gonna show?
- Yeah, she'll be here.

785
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:38,893
Miss?

786
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,604
What you want, please?

787
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:44,231
Nothing. Thank you.

788
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:45,858
Got to.

789
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,193
Pardon?

790
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,279
You sit, you eat, please.

791
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:54,325
Jeez, this guy wasn't
part of my master plan.

792
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:56,452
Unbelievable.

793
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,954
I'm waiting for someone.

794
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:01,707
Oh, he must eat too, please.

795
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,376
He will. We will. We're gonna...

796
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,046
We'll order half the
menu. Just not now.

797
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:13,093
Maybe that's him
disguised as a Chinaman.

798
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:11,443
Check out this guy in the hat.

799
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:16,281
I believe that's our man.

800
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,451
All units, suspect's approaching.

801
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,787
Stay in place. Wait for my signal.

802
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,593
Kate...

803
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:40,764
I did not kill that woman. I
want you to believe that.

804
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,187
Just hold on. Let him get settled.

805
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,900
You've gotta believe that.

806
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:56,905
- I think we're ready.
- Okay.

807
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:11,837
Damn it.

808
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,452
Almost.

809
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:51,919
You okay?

810
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:53,712
What was that?

811
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,049
Anybody see where those
shots came from?

812
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,843
- Did you do that?
- No, we didn't do it.

813
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:02,012
Anybody see where those
shots came from?

814
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,809
Where's Whitney?

815
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:09,728
Quit standing around
here. Go find him.

816
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,278
Take it easy.

817
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:19,738
Take it easy.

818
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,491
Take it easy, now.
Stay calm. Stay calm.

819
01:25:22,742 --> 01:25:24,743
There's no reason to panic.

820
01:25:25,036 --> 01:25:28,080
If everyone will just
kindly take it easy.

821
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:52,229
Messy.

822
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:54,356
I like that in a woman.

823
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:58,735
Here.

824
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:04,992
I got a few numbers here.

825
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,286
The top one's...

826
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:11,081
local police. That's my
office, my home, beeper.

827
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:14,710
I live alone too. You
can call anytime.

828
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,548
Want me to get somebody
to spend the night?

829
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,385
No, I wanna get some sleep.

830
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:25,888
Surveillance is outside
until this is over.

831
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:28,515
I've got a feeling he's
gonna try to contact you.

832
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:31,602
You're on a hot streak, I guess.

833
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,813
Listen, I'm sorry.

834
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:41,028
Anything unusual at all...

835
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:43,155
call right away.

836
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:44,907
It's not a bother.

837
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:48,285
I live alone.

838
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:51,914
You said.

839
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:54,833
Feeble, huh?

840
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,547
Listen, you want
something for the road?

841
01:27:02,508 --> 01:27:04,218
I got water and water.

842
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,429
Deal.

843
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,072
A Pellegrino would be great.

844
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,827
- What's so funny? I say it wrong?
- No. No, I'm...

845
01:27:30,995 --> 01:27:32,788
I'm tired.

846
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,290
I'm just tired.

847
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:47,594
Listen...

848
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:49,471
there's one thing...

849
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,182
I forgot to tell you.

850
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,936
I live alone.

851
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:02,651
Lock up behind me.

852
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:09,908
- How's that?
- Real good.

853
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,994
Now get some sleep.

854
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,288
Thank you.

855
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,923
I betrayed you twice, Luther.
You should know that.

856
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:27,009
You're not the first.

857
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:35,559
Why'd you come?

858
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:39,062
I couldn't have my daughter
thinking I was a murderer.

859
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:45,360
No, I mean this afternoon, to
the restaurant. Why'd you come?

860
01:28:45,611 --> 01:28:48,405
You suspected something or you
wouldn't have been prepared.

861
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:50,782
My daughter wanted to see me.

862
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:59,958
The robbery was going
fine until they came in.

863
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:01,668
They were drunk.

864
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:04,129
I was hidden in the vault.

865
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:06,673
And the sex had started
getting rough...

866
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:08,925
and he started beating her...

867
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:12,095
started strangling her. I
thought he was gonna kill her.

868
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:16,224
Then she somehow got
the upper hand.

869
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:18,686
She was gonna stab
him with a letter

870
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:20,687
opener and two guys
came in and shot her.

871
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,191
The same two guys who tried
for you this afternoon.

872
01:29:25,818 --> 01:29:27,152
Possibly. I don't know.

873
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,654
Unless Walter Sullivan
was taking a shot at me.

874
01:29:31,991 --> 01:29:33,992
It's a pretty powerful enemy.

875
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:36,036
That's very good going.

876
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:40,707
Not as powerful as the president
of the United States.

877
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:44,002
That's right.

878
01:29:44,253 --> 01:29:46,588
Alan Richmond, he was the drunk.

879
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:49,383
The two guys were Secret Service.

880
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:52,344
Chief of Staff Russell,
she handled the cover-up.

881
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:55,847
Well, then you go to the police.

882
01:29:56,140 --> 01:29:59,184
That's what innocent people
do. They go to the police.

883
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,852
Sure.

884
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,854
That young man who
was just here...

885
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:05,649
he'd believe me over the
president, wouldn't he?

886
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:08,652
Why should I believe you?

887
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:12,531
Because I swear to you, Kate.

888
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:14,950
I swear to you on Mattie's grave.

889
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:17,327
Yeah, that's right.

890
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:21,706
Your mother's grave. I'd kill
myself before I'd lie about that.

891
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:25,252
Oh, Jesus, Luther.

892
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:27,546
- Yeah. I know.
- They'll kill you.

893
01:30:30,049 --> 01:30:32,759
- I know.
- Can you run?

894
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:38,181
I was all set to. I was at
the airport ready to go.

895
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:41,101
Then there was that
press conference.

896
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:45,689
And there was Richmond
using old man Sullivan.

897
01:30:47,733 --> 01:30:50,277
You know, I might not
have been able to...

898
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,988
save Christy Sullivan...

899
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:55,574
but I didn't even try.

900
01:30:57,243 --> 01:30:58,827
What are you gonna do?

901
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,291
I don't know, but I'll
think of something.

902
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:16,178
I watched you argue
a case last year.

903
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:17,429
You won it.

904
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,224
Thank God you got
your mother's brains.

905
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:23,852
Dangerous outside.

906
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:28,190
It always is.

907
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,796
Excuse me.

908
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:54,382
Could you give this package
to Gloria Russell?

909
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:58,470
- Anything for me to sign?
- No, you have an honest face.

910
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:31,127
What?

911
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:39,553
Oh, my God.

912
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,368
Ms Russell, you're
a vision tonight.

913
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,871
Thank you, Mr President.

914
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:09,874
And thank you, Mr President.

915
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,502
For...? Come again.

916
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,010
You know.

917
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:26,266
You sent it to me this afternoon.

918
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:28,977
Of course.

919
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:34,024
Would you excuse me, all?

920
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:37,944
I'm overcome with a desire to
dance with my chief of staff.

921
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,864
Look after this for me, would you?

922
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,055
What is this nonsense?

923
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:07,349
I'm hoping there's an explanation.

924
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,602
Your gift, Alan. I was...

925
01:34:10,853 --> 01:34:12,354
overwhelmed.

926
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:16,107
And, you know, your
note was so gratifying.

927
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:22,656
I sent a note?

928
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:25,325
Yes, yes.

929
01:34:25,576 --> 01:34:27,869
You think I don't
know your writing?

930
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,955
I assumed you wanted
me to wear it tonight.

931
01:34:31,374 --> 01:34:34,042
- Gloria, it's lovely.
- Yes.

932
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:35,919
And you know what else?

933
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,421
What, Alan?

934
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,343
Christy Sullivan wore it
the night she was killed.

935
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:52,435
Know what this means?

936
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:53,895
No.

937
01:34:54,146 --> 01:34:55,939
Whitney's been heard from.

938
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:06,116
It's not precisely the
first time, Mr President.

939
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:12,038
You been keeping things from me?

940
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:17,877
Well, you know, it's just that
you have so much on your plate.

941
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,171
We wanted to spare you.

942
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:27,137
He sent me a Polaroid...

943
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,723
of the letter opener yesterday.

944
01:35:45,781 --> 01:35:47,866
I have to give this some thought.

945
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,122
Come to my office in the morning.

946
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:58,293
This'll make an interesting
chapter in my memoirs.

947
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:14,684
Do we know who the forger is?

948
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:17,041
I talked to Seth Frank,
sir. Apparently,

949
01:36:17,042 --> 01:36:19,147
Whitney learned how in prison.

950
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,360
A gifted man.

951
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:27,614
How close are we to stopping him?

952
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:30,366
We're working around the clock.

953
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:34,162
Well, that's good to know.

954
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:36,664
He'll make a mistake.

955
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,375
Well, that's good to know too.

956
01:36:47,259 --> 01:36:48,510
There is...

957
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:50,637
one other thing...

958
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:53,348
that we need to take care of.

959
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:57,936
He has a daughter, doesn't he?

960
01:36:59,855 --> 01:37:01,439
You sure you wanna do that?

961
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:05,401
Sir?

962
01:37:10,282 --> 01:37:14,285
She's a young prosecutor.
Prosecutors ask questions.

963
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:18,748
Maybe she knows what he knows.

964
01:37:23,879 --> 01:37:25,463
Let's get cracking, boys.

965
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,636
Show that you love your country.

966
01:37:56,453 --> 01:37:57,912
How's Kate doing?

967
01:37:58,330 --> 01:37:59,414
Where are you?

968
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:02,333
I won't hang around long enough
for you to trace the call.

969
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:03,960
Just answer the question.

970
01:38:04,336 --> 01:38:06,462
Well, she couldn't
be in better hands.

971
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:08,486
I got a call from
the Secret Service.

972
01:38:08,487 --> 01:38:10,300
They're taking over surveillance.

973
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:14,804
Hello?

974
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:19,809
Hello?

975
01:41:30,459 --> 01:41:32,293
It's entered in the chart.

976
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:36,464
We've upped her from
250 to 500 milligrams.

977
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:20,258
Nurse, I need you
right away, please.

978
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:22,343
He's having a seizure.

979
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:30,119
Dr Kevorkian, I presume.

980
01:43:31,246 --> 01:43:35,124
My guess is that this is right in
your carotid artery about now.

981
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:38,294
You're gonna get a little woozy.

982
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:40,588
But if I give you
the rest of this...

983
01:43:40,839 --> 01:43:44,091
it's gonna fry your brain
down to the size of a peanut.

984
01:43:44,509 --> 01:43:45,760
Drop that.

985
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:02,235
Luther...

986
01:44:03,278 --> 01:44:04,612
he was my president.

987
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:07,240
Right or wrong.

988
01:44:08,367 --> 01:44:10,201
Well, he made a mistake.

989
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:11,786
You made a mistake.

990
01:44:14,539 --> 01:44:16,312
When you went after
my little girl,

991
01:44:16,313 --> 01:44:18,084
that was entirely unacceptable.

992
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:21,879
Mercy.

993
01:44:25,050 --> 01:44:26,467
I'm fresh out.

994
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:38,020
Daddy?

995
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:43,401
Go to sleep, darling.

996
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:17,101
Oh, Jesus.

997
01:45:19,271 --> 01:45:20,771
Just one question.

998
01:45:21,023 --> 01:45:24,984
Did Walter Sullivan say why
Christy didn't go to Barbados?

999
01:45:26,028 --> 01:45:28,154
Just that she changed her mind.

1000
01:45:29,072 --> 01:45:31,032
You know who did it, don't you?

1001
01:45:32,909 --> 01:45:35,870
So will you. Check your phones.

1002
01:45:41,918 --> 01:45:43,586
Good night, Mr Sullivan.

1003
01:46:04,608 --> 01:46:06,692
You're taking a shortcut, Tommy?

1004
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:12,782
I'm your substitute driver
tonight, Mr Sullivan.

1005
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:16,494
Don't worry about
Tommy. He's just fine.

1006
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,038
Very unusual.

1007
01:46:19,831 --> 01:46:21,540
What do I call you?

1008
01:46:22,459 --> 01:46:24,043
Luther, sir.

1009
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:29,173
And are you familiar with how to
get to my town house, Luther?

1010
01:46:29,424 --> 01:46:31,133
Oh, yes, sir.

1011
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:33,386
I know where all your houses are.

1012
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:35,721
I'm the man who robbed you.

1013
01:46:39,142 --> 01:46:41,477
You're the man who
tried to kill me.

1014
01:46:43,438 --> 01:46:45,731
I'm sorry I missed.

1015
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:49,902
I believe in the Old
Testament, sir.

1016
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:52,863
There's nothing wrong
with an eye for an eye...

1017
01:46:53,031 --> 01:46:54,824
when a terrible
deed has been done.

1018
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,326
A deed such as yours.

1019
01:46:57,494 --> 01:47:00,538
Yeah. Well, you'd like to
believe that, wouldn't you?

1020
01:47:00,747 --> 01:47:03,249
That'd be simple for
you to believe that.

1021
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:05,751
What do you think I have
to gain by being here?

1022
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:08,087
I have no idea.

1023
01:47:08,338 --> 01:47:09,964
You going to rob me again?

1024
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:12,675
Oh, I don't need your
money, Mr Sullivan.

1025
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:15,344
Did you check your vault lately?

1026
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:18,055
I put everything back.

1027
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:23,060
I'm afraid we're a little late
for an attempt at leniency.

1028
01:47:27,315 --> 01:47:29,733
A lot of crap's coming
down tonight, sir.

1029
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:31,652
You wanna be a player or not?

1030
01:47:31,862 --> 01:47:34,447
You wanna know what happened
that night or don't you?

1031
01:47:34,656 --> 01:47:36,407
Because I was there.

1032
01:47:37,033 --> 01:47:38,451
I want to know.

1033
01:47:39,077 --> 01:47:41,454
You think you can stand
hearing about it?

1034
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:44,039
How he beat her, tried
to strangle her?

1035
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:46,000
You really wanna know about that?

1036
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:49,795
I could walk through fire.

1037
01:47:51,381 --> 01:47:53,507
I was in the vault
when they came in.

1038
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,384
They were drunk.

1039
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,052
He started knocking her around.

1040
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,138
She fought back.

1041
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:01,307
He started getting really rough.

1042
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:03,517
She tried to defend herself.

1043
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,603
Well, he started screaming...

1044
01:48:05,812 --> 01:48:08,481
snivelling simp he is.

1045
01:48:08,690 --> 01:48:10,316
Who else was in my house?

1046
01:48:10,525 --> 01:48:13,235
Secret Service. They're
the ones who shot her.

1047
01:48:14,029 --> 01:48:15,070
Nonsense.

1048
01:48:15,864 --> 01:48:18,032
Gloria Russell, she
handled the cover-up.

1049
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:19,325
Stop this.

1050
01:48:19,784 --> 01:48:21,410
Don't you wanna know who it was?

1051
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:22,786
It was you.

1052
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:27,041
Come on, Mr Sullivan. We're too
old to bullshit each other.

1053
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:28,876
Who was it, then?

1054
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:30,586
You know.

1055
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:34,757
Don't shake your head at me.

1056
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:41,931
When you're alone and your rage
takes over and you want revenge...

1057
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:44,600
what face do you put
with your enemy?

1058
01:48:58,532 --> 01:48:59,907
Stop the car.

1059
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:01,784
No, we're going straight ahead.

1060
01:49:02,452 --> 01:49:03,869
No.

1061
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:05,579
This is too terrible.

1062
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:07,540
Yes, it is.

1063
01:49:09,292 --> 01:49:14,004
I know about Alan's reputation
as a philanderer...

1064
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:17,049
but he'd never dream
of betraying me.

1065
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:22,346
I gave him the presidency.

1066
01:49:23,139 --> 01:49:24,765
Remember that press conference?

1067
01:49:25,016 --> 01:49:27,393
Where he put his arm
around you and said...

1068
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,583
if Christy hadn't been sick, she'd

1069
01:49:29,584 --> 01:49:31,522
have been in Barbados with you?

1070
01:49:31,731 --> 01:49:34,066
Well, how the hell did
he know she was sick?

1071
01:49:34,901 --> 01:49:36,569
You didn't tell anyone.

1072
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:39,154
It's because she told him
that night. I was there.

1073
01:49:39,322 --> 01:49:41,365
I was right there watching.

1074
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:44,660
That's not real proof.

1075
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:48,581
Well, maybe this is, then.

1076
01:49:54,713 --> 01:49:56,297
You could've stolen this.

1077
01:49:57,757 --> 01:49:59,091
I did steal it.

1078
01:49:59,342 --> 01:50:02,803
But that's not my blood on there
and that's not my prints.

1079
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,207
Mr Sullivan.

1080
01:50:48,016 --> 01:50:50,601
I did love her, you know.

1081
01:51:11,414 --> 01:51:13,290
Jeez, Burton.

1082
01:51:59,879 --> 01:52:01,818
Is he working late?
I don't have an

1083
01:52:01,819 --> 01:52:03,757
appointment but I would
like to see him.

1084
01:52:04,008 --> 01:52:06,260
You don't need an
appointment, Mr Sullivan.

1085
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:20,607
Let's go, Ms Russell.

1086
01:53:03,276 --> 01:53:04,568
Walter.

1087
01:53:04,736 --> 01:53:05,778
Come in.

1088
01:53:10,033 --> 01:53:12,701
We interrupt this program
with a breaking story...

1089
01:53:12,869 --> 01:53:15,204
one that is shocking the
nation and the world.

1090
01:53:15,371 --> 01:53:16,768
Information is just coming out of

1091
01:53:16,769 --> 01:53:18,165
the White House about a tragedy...

1092
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:20,000
that's taken place
within the hour.

1093
01:53:20,168 --> 01:53:22,085
We go now to our White
House correspondent.

1094
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:24,087
Diane, what can you tell us?

1095
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:28,717
Sources say Sullivan...

1096
01:53:28,885 --> 01:53:31,136
had seen President
Richmond tonight.

1097
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:34,473
That was for an unscheduled
private meeting.

1098
01:53:44,943 --> 01:53:46,777
You're still here.

1099
01:53:49,781 --> 01:53:51,114
I'm still here.

1100
01:54:01,376 --> 01:54:03,460
I would not be president.

1101
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:08,048
If Christine had not taken ill...

1102
01:54:08,716 --> 01:54:11,385
she would be with you
in Barbados even now.

1103
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:17,683
Walter, you've been
like a father to me.

1104
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:20,727
This is the president's most
recent news conference...

1105
01:54:20,937 --> 01:54:22,771
where he clearly outlined...

1106
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:25,816
his loyalty to philanthropist and
dear friend Walter Sullivan.

1107
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:27,589
Sullivan's wife was murdered. The

1108
01:54:27,590 --> 01:54:29,194
president vowed to
find the killer.

1109
01:54:29,362 --> 01:54:31,426
Again, Sullivan had
a meeting with the

1110
01:54:31,427 --> 01:54:33,490
president. Unknown
what they discussed.

1111
01:54:33,741 --> 01:54:36,118
We go now to the White House
for a live interview.

1112
01:54:36,578 --> 01:54:38,642
Mr Sullivan, have
you no idea why the

1113
01:54:38,643 --> 01:54:40,706
president would take his own life?

1114
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:44,043
I know he's been
feeling the pressure

1115
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:46,420
of office more than ever lately.

1116
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:48,964
He talked about it a great deal.

1117
01:54:49,215 --> 01:54:51,258
But why would he stab himself?

1118
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:57,681
That's a question that
will haunt me forever.

1119
01:55:00,685 --> 01:55:03,770
Of course I tried to stop him.

1120
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:06,690
Alan...

1121
01:55:06,941 --> 01:55:08,734
was like a son to me.

1122
01:55:53,237 --> 01:55:55,030
Was that Seth?

1123
01:55:58,201 --> 01:56:01,662
I think he'd like to come over
for supper when you get well.

1124
01:56:08,586 --> 01:56:10,462
You don't have to fuss.

1125
01:56:10,672 --> 01:56:11,922
I know.

1126
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:19,888
Am I gonna be all right?

1127
01:56:21,474 --> 01:56:22,766
Yeah.

1128
01:56:23,893 --> 01:56:26,019
We're gonna be just fine.
