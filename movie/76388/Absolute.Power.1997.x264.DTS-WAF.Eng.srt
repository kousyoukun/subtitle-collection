1
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:40,034
Don't give up.

2
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,788
Oh, I never do.

3
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:49,919
May l?

4
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:03,432
You work with your hands?

5
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:19,240
-Redhead.
-Luther.

6
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:33,462
Your life would be a whole lot simpler
if you could learn to operate a VCR.

7
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:37,174
True. Truer words were never spoken.

8
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:56,544
What's that?

9
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:01,799
Here we go.

10
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,766
That is nice.

11
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:26,365
It's okay. He's not here.

12
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:30,119
Anyway, I told him that I was sick.

13
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:32,788
So you can relax.

14
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,315
I'll be right back.

15
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,891
You like that? Do you?

16
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,018
Oh, yeah.

17
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,294
So you wanna play, huh?

18
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:00,848
You okay?

19
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:07,688
How would you like that?

20
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,441
-You slap--
-Don't slap me!

21
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:11,817
You little bitch!

22
00:18:12,068 --> 00:18:13,736
Alan, what are you doing?

23
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:15,029
Alan!

24
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:21,619
Alan, you're hurting me!

25
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:24,080
I'll hurt you, goddamn it.

26
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:30,753
You're hurting me!

27
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:32,004
Goddamn you!

28
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:33,422
You wanna be hurt?

29
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:34,715
I'll hurt you.

30
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:39,136
You like this?

31
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:40,596
-Let go!
-Do you?

32
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:41,847
You like that?

33
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:45,434
Goddamn you!

34
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,857
-Son of a bitch!
-Get away!

35
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:52,733
Get back here.

36
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,236
Get back here!

37
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:57,280
Stop it!

38
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,074
Stop it! Alan!

39
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:02,118
What are you doing?

40
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:15,840
Bitch. . .

41
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:17,967
. . .you wanna play?
I'll show you how.

42
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:19,760
You fucking bastard!

43
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,180
You bastard!

44
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:29,228
You like that?

45
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:33,858
-Come back.
-Don't!

46
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:34,942
Let go of me!

47
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:12,104
Bitch, you cut me, goddamn it!

48
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:13,856
Fucking asshole!

49
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,525
I'm gonna kill you!

50
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:19,320
Help! Help!

51
00:20:29,372 --> 00:20:30,998
Help!

52
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:53,187
Did you kill her?

53
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:56,691
No choice in the matter, sir.

54
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:00,778
What am I gonna do?

55
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:07,743
-Jesus, Tim. What do we do?
-No choice in the matter.

56
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,710
What the hell was that?

57
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:20,172
Oh, shit.

58
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:23,342
Oh, my God.

59
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:30,600
Oh, my God.

60
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:41,861
Do you realize
what a shitstorm we're in?

61
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:47,950
Go on, tell me.

62
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,037
Nothing to tell.
He screamed for help.

63
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:54,790
You heard no sounds
of violence till then?

64
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,918
Nothing we haven't heard before.

65
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:08,679
-Maybe I should call the police.
-Oh, Jesus. What?

66
00:22:10,723 --> 00:22:11,891
Bill. . .

67
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:14,602
. . .why don't you think about that.

68
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,479
Just take a second. . .

69
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,731
. . .and think about that.

70
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,569
Think real. . .

71
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:25,071
. . .fucking. . .

72
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:26,572
. . .hard.

73
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:34,622
Probably not a good idea.

74
00:22:53,683 --> 00:22:55,476
Here's what happened.

75
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:58,855
Poor Christy. . .

76
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:02,775
. . .came home alone
and interrupted a burglary.

77
00:23:03,025 --> 00:23:04,443
Sound logical?

78
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:05,945
Yeah, sure.

79
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:13,452
We have to sanitize this place.

80
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:16,789
Alan.

81
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,041
Did you have sex with her?

82
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,544
I don't know.

83
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,131
Bill, you're gonna have
to examine her.

84
00:23:25,381 --> 00:23:28,217
-I'm no gynecologist.
-I just made you one.

85
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:29,886
Christ!

86
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:06,631
I'll take that.

87
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:09,300
-It has both fingerprints.
-Thanks for sharing.

88
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,136
Gloria.

89
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,556
Gloria.

90
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:20,144
-Did I kill her?
-Everything's gonna be fine, Alan.

91
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:21,896
Don't worry about it.

92
00:24:22,313 --> 00:24:24,774
-Oh, God.
-Now be careful.

93
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:27,026
Just don't get blood on you.

94
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,199
I'll take care of everything, okay?
Just like I always do.

95
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,549
-Oh, shit.
-What?

96
00:24:51,467 --> 00:24:53,302
Madame's purse.

97
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:13,239
-Miss Russell, let me get him.
-Thank you.

98
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,589
-I got him.
-All right.

99
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:32,300
Nice and easy, sir.

100
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:49,043
Oh, my God!

101
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:55,007
No knife!

102
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:56,634
-What?
-Where's the knife?

103
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,012
In the bedroom.

104
00:27:00,388 --> 00:27:02,390
-Come on.
-Get up there!

105
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:28,142
Shit!

106
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:29,769
Shit!

107
00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:57,713
Go!

108
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:04,595
Excuse me.

109
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:22,233
I got the number.

110
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:30,449
Gee, guys, maybe it was the bogeyman.

111
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:34,579
Check under the bed.
You may have buried us!

112
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:36,289
I got his license number.

113
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,208
You think he'll sit around
waiting for us?

114
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:40,710
Look, take it easy.

115
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,588
Everybody, shut up, all right?

116
00:31:51,596 --> 00:31:53,180
What have you got?

117
00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:56,100
Oh, boy.

118
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:18,623
Two-way mirror.

119
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:21,959
We better get cracking
on that license number.

120
00:32:22,668 --> 00:32:24,462
That's all we've got.

121
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:26,756
He's got the letter opener.

122
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:28,424
Blood. . .

123
00:32:28,674 --> 00:32:30,301
. . .fingerprints.

124
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:33,054
Jesus!

125
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:35,097
Think what he can do.

126
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:39,268
The man's a thief.
A thief who witnessed a murder.

127
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:42,605
It looks like he stole
a whole bunch of money.

128
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:47,193
I'll tell you what he's gonna do.

129
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:50,112
He's gonna run like hell.

130
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,919
They beat us by seven.

131
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:06,796
By seven?

132
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:10,341
Who'd have thought that?

133
00:33:58,347 --> 00:33:59,765
Kate.

134
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:01,225
Kate.

135
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,702
I guess it'd be a little late for me.

136
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,288
The jogging, I mean.

137
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:28,502
Kind of dumb way to start.

138
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:31,923
But I did want to talk to you.

139
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:33,424
About?

140
00:34:35,843 --> 00:34:37,303
The weather, actually.

141
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:39,597
It's getting cool in the evenings.

142
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:42,767
That happens this time of year.

143
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,896
I was thinking. . .

144
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:51,275
. . .of moving to a kinder,
more gentle climate.

145
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:54,862
I thought I'd talk with you,
since you're the only family I have.

146
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,865
Luther, you don't have me.

147
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:02,036
You know what it's like
to be the only kid. . .

148
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:04,372
. . .who got to talk about visiting day?

149
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:12,713
This move, it would be
a permanent one, you understand.

150
00:35:14,924 --> 00:35:16,968
We never see each other anyway.

151
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:19,762
We haven't since Mom died.
That's a year.

152
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:26,894
Look, you chose your life.
You had that right.

153
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:29,689
You were never around for me. Fine.

154
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:32,358
I have no plans to be around for you.

155
00:35:36,362 --> 00:35:38,197
Wait a minute. Wait.

156
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:40,783
You're lying, aren't you?

157
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,955
Are you active again?
ls that why you're here now?

158
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:51,252
I don't believe you.

159
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:56,549
Oh, Christ!

160
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,634
Father, what have you done?

161
00:36:16,235 --> 00:36:17,236
Christy Sullivan?

162
00:36:17,445 --> 00:36:18,446
Wife of Walter.

163
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:21,908
Most likely came home,
stumbled onto a burglary.

164
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:25,620
Some burglary.
I wish my carpets were this clean.

165
00:36:25,828 --> 00:36:27,997
I couldn't find
a single fingerprint.

166
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:31,417
-Are you serious, Laura?
-It's like Mary Poppins was here.

167
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,835
Where's Mr. Sullivan?

168
00:36:33,044 --> 00:36:33,878
Sorry, Seth.

169
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:37,965
The entire Sullivan household went
to Barbados two days ago.

170
00:36:39,342 --> 00:36:40,635
Thanks for your support.

171
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:42,845
Oh, no, wait. It gets worse.

172
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:44,555
The shots came from here.

173
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:47,600
If she stumbled on a burglary,
she should've been here.

174
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:49,936
But she was killed
exactly where she is.

175
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:52,855
See, the blood patterns indicate that.

176
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,983
What is she doing here?

177
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:04,116
Looks like someone sat here,
but I couldn't find any prints.

178
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:08,538
So you think old man Sullivan
holed up in this chair. . .

179
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:10,790
. . .and watched his wife perform?

180
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:13,709
God, I hope not.

181
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,837
For his sake.
You know, he's such a great man.

182
00:37:17,964 --> 00:37:19,590
Be careful digging that out.

183
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:21,842
Looks like he tried to strangle her.

184
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:25,388
Then he went to the door
to shoot her from behind?

185
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:28,641
He also inspected her vagina.

186
00:37:31,644 --> 00:37:32,937
He did what?

187
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:34,397
Why?

188
00:37:34,605 --> 00:37:37,066
Maybe he didn't remember
that he did her.

189
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:43,739
A strong burglar with a weak mind.

190
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,868
Obviously, it's another
open-and-shut case.

191
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,536
We can expect
tomorrow's temperatures...

192
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:14,872
... to climb into the 70s
with lows around 50.

193
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:18,209
Turner will start things off
for the Cougars.

194
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:27,802
-One man to beat.
-He's going all the way!

195
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,930
Nothing but clear sailing now.

196
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,265
Six points!

197
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:00,334
Mr. Sullivan.

198
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:02,670
Sorry to bother you.

199
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,215
I'm Seth Frank, senior homicide
detective, Middletown County.

200
00:40:06,465 --> 00:40:09,302
My client is in no mood
for conversations.

201
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,178
It's all right, Sandy.

202
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:14,140
You're in charge of the case?

203
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,516
Yes, sir.

204
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:18,060
I've gotta ask you a few questions.

205
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:20,229
What do you want?

206
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,274
Positive identification?

207
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:25,568
Yes. . .

208
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:28,070
. . .that was my wife.

209
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:29,906
Anything else?

210
00:40:31,157 --> 00:40:33,492
You'd been in Barbados for two days.

211
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:36,329
I took the staff,
always do this time of year.

212
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:38,289
Your wife didn't come with you.

213
00:40:38,497 --> 00:40:40,374
Well, she was.

214
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,210
Had it all planned.

215
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,545
But you know women.

216
00:40:45,004 --> 00:40:46,839
She changed her mind.

217
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:52,887
I'd been married
to my Rebecca for 47 years.

218
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:55,598
When she died. . .

219
00:40:56,515 --> 00:40:59,769
. . .I decided I never wanted
that pain again.

220
00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:03,731
One thing I knew about Christy. . .

221
00:41:04,357 --> 00:41:06,442
. . .she was going to outlive me.

222
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:09,320
I think that's enough for today.

223
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:12,698
Sir, I have to ask you
about the vault.

224
00:41:14,283 --> 00:41:16,953
You mean, the contents
of the vault, of course.

225
00:41:21,707 --> 00:41:22,708
Sandy, you go on.

226
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,210
-Walter.
-No, really.

227
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:26,879
I'm all right.
You go on to the reception.

228
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:30,424
Obviously, I can't make it.

229
00:41:30,675 --> 00:41:32,718
I'm sure everyone will understand.

230
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,180
You don't mean the contents.

231
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:39,517
You mean the chair.

232
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:43,229
You must ask about the chair.

233
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:45,773
Yes, sir. I do.

234
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:48,067
Why? Are they connected?

235
00:41:49,151 --> 00:41:52,613
Someone sat in it and may have
been involved in the murder.

236
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:59,328
I have the deepest respect for you.
I'm sorry to have to do this.

237
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:02,957
I promise you, none of this
will make my highlight reel.

238
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:06,711
Well, I hoped I could satisfy her.

239
00:42:07,086 --> 00:42:08,796
But, you know. . .

240
00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:11,090
. . .she had needs.

241
00:42:11,757 --> 00:42:14,051
She didn't want to go
behind my back.

242
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:18,389
She suggested the chair.

243
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:22,143
She hoped I might get
to like sitting there.

244
00:42:22,602 --> 00:42:24,020
I didn't.

245
00:42:27,565 --> 00:42:30,067
For 80 years, I've tried to live. . .

246
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:32,778
. . .a decent life.

247
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:35,698
I've given a billion dollars
to charity.

248
00:42:35,948 --> 00:42:37,783
If this comes to trial. . .

249
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:40,286
. . .none of that will be remembered.

250
00:42:41,287 --> 00:42:42,997
I'll just go out. . .

251
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:45,082
. . .the joke of the world.

252
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,836
I understand, sir.
I'll do what I can.

253
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,339
Would you listen to me whine?

254
00:42:51,631 --> 00:42:54,592
I apologize, Mr. Frank.

255
00:42:55,718 --> 00:42:58,054
Just do your job
and I'll try to do mine.

256
00:42:58,262 --> 00:42:59,680
Yes, sir.

257
00:43:03,935 --> 00:43:05,728
I'm sorry, sir.

258
00:43:35,383 --> 00:43:38,135
Ladies and gentlemen, the President.

259
00:43:40,846 --> 00:43:42,098
Sandy.

260
00:43:42,682 --> 00:43:43,849
Mr. President.

261
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:48,896
-Take a walk with me.
-Certainly, sir.

262
00:43:51,023 --> 00:43:52,942
Tell me about Walter. How is he?

263
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:56,863
Well, he's 80 and alone, Mr. President.

264
00:43:57,113 --> 00:44:00,157
He understands that
officially my hands are tied.

265
00:44:00,366 --> 00:44:03,494
Yes, but he's very moved
by your concern, sir.

266
00:44:04,203 --> 00:44:06,455
Any news of the killer?

267
00:44:06,664 --> 00:44:09,125
Why isn't there?
Who's in charge of this?

268
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:10,710
The top man.

269
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,838
He spent eight years,
homicide work in New York.

270
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:17,466
I understand how you feel.
It's hard to be patient.

271
00:44:17,675 --> 00:44:19,635
No one understands how I feel.

272
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:22,513
I'm supposed to have all this power. . .

273
00:44:22,722 --> 00:44:25,391
. . .and I can't even help
my oldest friend.

274
00:44:26,225 --> 00:44:30,438
You and I know, more than any man alive,
Walter Sullivan put me here.

275
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,608
Now when he needs me most. . . .

276
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,861
Well, he must feel abandoned.

277
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:44,493
I'll have a press conference.

278
00:44:44,827 --> 00:44:48,581
I'll have Walter come and
I'll embrace him in front of the world.

279
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:52,168
He'll treasure that.

280
00:44:54,921 --> 00:44:56,672
What a generous gesture.

281
00:44:57,381 --> 00:44:59,675
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

282
00:45:07,767 --> 00:45:09,268
Tennis elbow.

283
00:45:17,944 --> 00:45:20,029
This is getting worse, Gloria.

284
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:21,948
I need to see a doctor.

285
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:25,243
The country would have
to be informed, Mr. President.

286
00:45:25,952 --> 00:45:28,162
What happened to my rights to privacy?

287
00:45:28,996 --> 00:45:31,082
I think she nicked a tendon.

288
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:34,043
Burton says it's a flesh wound.

289
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:38,714
Since when did you
become an expert, Bill?

290
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,424
You ever been wounded?

291
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:42,343
Yes, sir. A few times.

292
00:45:48,015 --> 00:45:50,393
You're serious about
this press conference?

293
00:45:50,768 --> 00:45:52,144
Of course I am.

294
00:45:52,645 --> 00:45:54,522
Walter's like a father to me.

295
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:57,650
Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home?

296
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:01,153
I don't think
Mrs. Richmond's mission. . .

297
00:46:01,404 --> 00:46:04,156
. . .to help the poor in Asia
needs to be interrupted.

298
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:07,410
What do we know so far?

299
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:11,122
We've checked his license plates.

300
00:46:11,372 --> 00:46:14,083
He stole the car from
a police impoundment lot.

301
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:18,212
We're not dealing
with a fool, are we?

302
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,298
Has he initiated contact?

303
00:46:21,215 --> 00:46:23,217
Burton doesn't think he will.

304
00:46:25,177 --> 00:46:26,554
I agree.

305
00:46:27,597 --> 00:46:29,640
I apologize for my behavior.

306
00:46:30,141 --> 00:46:32,393
Consider it a blip on the screen.

307
00:46:32,643 --> 00:46:34,937
As far as I'm concerned,
that's all he is.

308
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,482
He could be a little more
than that, Alan.

309
00:46:38,691 --> 00:46:40,026
He saw.

310
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:44,363
He saw nothing. He saw a drunk woman
who liked rough sex too much.

311
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:47,408
He's a burglar.
Who's gonna believe him?

312
00:46:47,658 --> 00:46:50,745
After all, it's not as if
he has any evidence.

313
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:22,235
He's a burglar.
Who 's gonna believe him?

314
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:25,571
After all, it's not as if
he has any evidence.

315
00:48:32,597 --> 00:48:35,683
Boy, you always did
disappear good, Luther.

316
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,187
You're trying to say
I have a weak face?

317
00:48:39,437 --> 00:48:41,272
No, I'm saying you're lucky.

318
00:48:41,522 --> 00:48:44,859
Some customers, no matter
what I do, still stand out.

319
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:47,111
How many passports you want?

320
00:48:47,778 --> 00:48:49,447
Four ought to do the trick.

321
00:48:49,655 --> 00:48:53,409
You want different looks, matching
international driver's licenses.

322
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:55,536
I'll throw in dummy credit cards.

323
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,581
How are the rugs I made you
holding up?

324
00:48:58,873 --> 00:49:01,584
Good. The mustaches
and the beards also.

325
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:04,503
We try to give quality
for our money.

326
00:49:05,546 --> 00:49:07,757
You leaving the country for permanent?

327
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:09,884
That could be.

328
00:49:11,552 --> 00:49:15,681
Does it matter where you've been?
I hate doing Asian passport stamps.

329
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,266
No. Make it European.

330
00:49:17,516 --> 00:49:21,687
Caribbean in the wintertime.
How long is all this gonna take?

331
00:49:22,813 --> 00:49:25,650
It usually takes time.
For you, I'll rush it.

332
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:29,320
You're always dependable, Valerie.

333
00:49:30,112 --> 00:49:31,739
Listen, Luther. . .

334
00:49:32,198 --> 00:49:34,242
. . .I don't wanna know
what you're into.

335
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,538
I do, but I'm not gonna ask you.
But leaving the country forever. . . .

336
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,331
What is it?

337
00:49:40,957 --> 00:49:43,125
I never figured you for a runner.

338
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:46,963
Thirty percent of my runners
kill themselves within five years.

339
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:52,885
Right now, five years
doesn't sound too bad.

340
00:49:54,595 --> 00:49:55,763
Take care.

341
00:49:57,431 --> 00:49:58,641
See you.

342
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,978
Okay, see if this makes any sense.

343
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,272
I am Christy Sullivan.

344
00:50:04,856 --> 00:50:07,233
I come in and I surprise a burglar.

345
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:12,196
Okay, now you're the surprised burglar
coming from the vault.

346
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:14,532
Gold star. I draw my gun. Boom.

347
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:17,577
Then why strangle her
when you could just shoot her?

348
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:21,205
Why do I bother to strip her
and put her clothes back on?

349
00:50:21,455 --> 00:50:23,082
There, I can help you out.

350
00:50:23,332 --> 00:50:26,919
You used to be a dry cleaner
and you love beautiful clothes.

351
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:29,672
Thanks a lot.
And you dress her because. . . .

352
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:34,302
She was a good customer and you didn't
want her embarrassed when police came.

353
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:38,723
She had a 0.21 blood-alcohol level.
Not that it matters.

354
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:40,516
She didn't drive.

355
00:50:40,725 --> 00:50:44,103
The chauffeurs, they keep
exact mileage on these cars.

356
00:50:44,312 --> 00:50:46,314
They haven't been driven
since they went to Barbados.

357
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:49,442
I checked every cab
and limo service in the area.

358
00:50:49,692 --> 00:50:52,987
Somebody drove her home. Who?

359
00:50:53,237 --> 00:50:54,947
Why haven't they come forward?

360
00:50:55,156 --> 00:50:57,825
Maybe because whoever drove her
home killed her.

361
00:51:00,453 --> 00:51:01,287
Maybe.

362
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:03,664
I love this case.

363
00:51:03,873 --> 00:51:04,999
Lieutenant?

364
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:08,085
Sorry to bother you,
but the phone problems?

365
00:51:08,294 --> 00:51:10,004
-I took care of them.
-Thanks.

366
00:51:11,005 --> 00:51:12,673
Just part of the job.

367
00:51:13,257 --> 00:51:17,261
I hate people who say that.
It is your fucking job.

368
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:19,847
Remember the bullet hole
in the wall?

369
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:21,057
Guess what?

370
00:51:21,307 --> 00:51:22,475
No slug.

371
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:26,562
Why take a slug out of the wall
when there's one stuck in her head?

372
00:51:26,812 --> 00:51:28,731
Different from the one in her body?

373
00:51:29,315 --> 00:51:32,485
Two different guns means two burglars.

374
00:51:32,693 --> 00:51:33,736
Two guys broke in?

375
00:51:33,945 --> 00:51:36,197
They both went out the window?
Bullshit.

376
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,074
By the way. . .

377
00:51:38,533 --> 00:51:41,285
. . .why did he or they
go out the window anyway. . .

378
00:51:41,494 --> 00:51:46,499
. . .when he or they got in by breaking
a zillion dollar security system?

379
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:49,835
Bill Burton from Secret Service
in the parking lot.

380
00:51:50,086 --> 00:51:53,965
Thanks, Bob.
What's he doing in the parking lot?

381
00:52:02,473 --> 00:52:03,683
Bill Burton. Hi.

382
00:52:03,933 --> 00:52:06,686
Hi. Seth Frank.
To what do I owe the honor?

383
00:52:06,894 --> 00:52:08,396
You must be going crazy. . .

384
00:52:08,604 --> 00:52:11,524
. . .but the boss is interested
about your progress.

385
00:52:11,774 --> 00:52:13,568
Maybe we could help each other.

386
00:52:13,776 --> 00:52:15,444
What do you have in mind?

387
00:52:16,028 --> 00:52:19,615
Well, you know how close
he and Sullivan are, right?

388
00:52:21,576 --> 00:52:23,786
The minute anything breaks. . .

389
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:26,247
. . .I'll tell the President.

390
00:52:26,455 --> 00:52:28,833
He'd be the first
to alert Mr. Sullivan.

391
00:52:29,083 --> 00:52:30,459
It'd mean a lot to him.

392
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:33,796
Any red tape you want cut, done.

393
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:36,716
Here's my numbers.

394
00:52:37,842 --> 00:52:38,676
Any leads?

395
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,679
We're still figuring out
what happened.

396
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:44,974
-I love playing Sherlock Holmes.
-You guys do that?

397
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:47,977
I was a state trooper
before the government got me.

398
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:50,188
Wait. You're that Bill Burton?

399
00:52:50,521 --> 00:52:54,483
-I was younger and dumber then.
-I was younger. I'm dumber now.

400
00:52:54,734 --> 00:52:56,319
Keep in touch.

401
00:53:22,637 --> 00:53:25,556
My chef makes them especially for me.

402
00:53:25,765 --> 00:53:28,434
I promise you, they're sinful.

403
00:53:29,435 --> 00:53:31,562
You're a salesman, Mr. Sullivan.

404
00:53:32,897 --> 00:53:35,316
This is a new arena for me.

405
00:53:35,942 --> 00:53:39,570
But from what I'm told,
you have a flawless reputation.

406
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:43,074
Which is why I need to employ you,
Mr. McCarty.

407
00:53:43,324 --> 00:53:44,200
Understood.

408
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,453
I don't know who it is I'm after yet.

409
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:49,205
Until I do. . .

410
00:53:49,455 --> 00:53:51,916
. . .you wait in Washington
for instructions.

411
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:56,379
That's out of the question.

412
00:53:57,713 --> 00:53:59,340
Mine is not creative work.

413
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:02,218
I do it because I enjoy
living beyond my means.

414
00:54:02,468 --> 00:54:04,470
I can't afford to sit around.

415
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:09,767
My father died
when I was 1 0 years old.

416
00:54:09,976 --> 00:54:13,145
He was a miner.
He died of lung disease.

417
00:54:14,146 --> 00:54:16,482
I became rich at 25.

418
00:54:16,691 --> 00:54:20,152
The first thing I did was buy
that mine, close it down. . .

419
00:54:20,361 --> 00:54:24,532
. . .and give every miner
$50,000 to retire on.

420
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:30,413
You will wait in Washington,
Mr. McCarty.

421
00:54:30,621 --> 00:54:34,959
And I will put
one million dollars' expenses. . .

422
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:37,211
. . .in a Swiss bank of your choosing.

423
00:54:37,545 --> 00:54:39,839
And when the time comes. . .

424
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:42,508
. . .2 million dollars a bullet.

425
00:54:45,136 --> 00:54:46,762
You are a salesman, sir.

426
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,684
Selling sin is easy.

427
00:54:58,649 --> 00:55:00,860
-Who is he?
-It's Luther Whitney. . .

428
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,571
. . .one of the great thieves
of the world.

429
00:55:04,363 --> 00:55:06,782
I've been going nuts.
I was up all night.

430
00:55:08,576 --> 00:55:11,537
I remembered your notion
how it was two burglars.

431
00:55:11,787 --> 00:55:15,249
Around dawn, I thought,
"What if it's not two burglars. . .

432
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:18,628
. . .but just one guy trying
to make it look like two?"

433
00:55:19,629 --> 00:55:22,548
I called my buddy at the Bureau.
They keep track.

434
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:26,510
There's only half a dozen guys
who could've done the Sullivan job.

435
00:55:26,761 --> 00:55:28,387
I've been tracing all six.

436
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:30,640
Whitney's the only guy
that lives here.

437
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:35,394
-Why haven't I ever heard of him?
-He hasn't been arrested in 20 years.

438
00:55:35,645 --> 00:55:38,397
What's this? His graduation
picture from Harvard?

439
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:41,651
That's history.
He was just a punk, part of a gang.

440
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:43,402
Three-time loser.

441
00:55:43,653 --> 00:55:45,112
Since he got out last. . .

442
00:55:45,863 --> 00:55:47,156
. . .no one's touched him.

443
00:55:48,658 --> 00:55:52,328
When something big comes up,
they question him, but nothing sticks.

444
00:55:52,537 --> 00:55:53,412
Oh, Seth.

445
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:56,123
We can make this stick.

446
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:58,417
I bet you he's our guy.

447
00:55:58,668 --> 00:56:01,379
He's a local.
You can't ask for anything more.

448
00:56:02,463 --> 00:56:04,090
Well, we got a problem.

449
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,508
What?

450
00:56:06,842 --> 00:56:08,719
He hasn't killed anyone in 45 years.

451
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:10,930
Korea.

452
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,682
So what? He's a veteran.

453
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:16,143
Not just a veteran,
he's a wounded veteran.

454
00:56:16,394 --> 00:56:18,229
I got his war record here.

455
00:56:18,563 --> 00:56:22,608
Battles, commendations,
decorations up the kazoo.

456
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,611
He lives alone on disability.

457
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,114
That's what he says anyway.

458
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:32,410
But I don't see him as a killer.
He's just a great thief.

459
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,329
And besides, I don't do war heroes.

460
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:23,294
Boy, you must be smart.

461
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:26,088
Pardon me?

462
00:57:27,298 --> 00:57:30,176
It usually takes you guys
a week to get to me.

463
00:57:32,428 --> 00:57:34,055
Oh, Seth Frank.

464
00:57:34,513 --> 00:57:37,475
I recognize your picture
from the newspaper.

465
00:57:37,725 --> 00:57:39,352
Luther Whitney.

466
00:57:40,228 --> 00:57:41,646
Nice to meet you.

467
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:47,235
Would you like a signed confession now
or do you want coffee first?

468
00:57:47,443 --> 00:57:52,281
Before I send you away for life,
I should probably check out your alibi.

469
00:57:52,532 --> 00:57:56,285
I was watching a football game
with an old friend, Red Bransford.

470
00:57:56,536 --> 00:57:58,746
He owns a saloon here in town.

471
00:57:59,622 --> 00:58:01,499
You can ask me about the game.

472
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:03,543
I could be lying.

473
00:58:04,669 --> 00:58:06,254
You been following the case?

474
00:58:06,462 --> 00:58:07,672
Yeah, I have.

475
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,799
I love true crime.

476
00:58:10,258 --> 00:58:13,803
FBI says there's only a few guys
who could have handled this job.

477
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:16,472
I got a list here.
You're on it.

478
00:58:17,056 --> 00:58:18,558
How I wish it were true.

479
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:24,188
This person,
they go in the front door. . .

480
00:58:24,397 --> 00:58:27,525
. . .and out a window, down a rope
in the middle of the night?

481
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:31,028
Now, if I could do
something like that. . .

482
00:58:31,237 --> 00:58:33,781
. . .I'd be the star
of my AARP meetings.

483
00:58:34,657 --> 00:58:38,995
-What's that? The American--
-Association of Retired Persons.

484
00:58:41,581 --> 00:58:43,791
Luther, why was this so difficult?

485
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:47,169
You want me to help you
solve your case?

486
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:49,046
Just looking for insight.

487
00:58:49,255 --> 00:58:50,673
How would you--?

488
00:58:51,257 --> 00:58:54,051
Scratch that.
How would one go about it?

489
00:58:54,302 --> 00:58:56,721
What kind of person
should I look for?

490
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,559
Except for the rope trick,
an older person, like me.

491
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:03,394
Because?

492
00:59:04,103 --> 00:59:05,897
Well, you need patience.

493
00:59:06,147 --> 00:59:09,442
The secret is research, research
and research. I've read that.

494
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,444
What kind of research?

495
00:59:13,154 --> 00:59:16,741
Well, from what I saw on the tube,
this is a rather large home.

496
00:59:16,949 --> 00:59:19,368
Must be an architectural office.

497
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:22,622
You'd go to the library,
go through public records. . .

498
00:59:22,872 --> 00:59:26,334
. . .find out where that architectural
office is and break in.

499
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:30,087
And then you xerox the plans
and get them back by morning.

500
00:59:30,338 --> 00:59:32,298
Why not just steal them?

501
00:59:32,882 --> 00:59:35,134
Anyone can break into
an office, but doing it. . .

502
00:59:35,384 --> 00:59:38,638
. . .without having people know
you were there is the trick.

503
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:41,349
Then there's the general contractor.

504
00:59:41,557 --> 00:59:44,060
And then there's the security company.

505
00:59:44,435 --> 00:59:49,232
Do you realize the skill of breaking
the security of a security company?

506
00:59:49,774 --> 00:59:52,193
I don't know how those guys do it.

507
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:56,364
Why go to all that trouble, Luther?

508
00:59:57,156 --> 01:00:00,952
There's a vault in the house.
There must be a secret way into it.

509
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,204
There was.
That's what I don't get.

510
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,164
How do you mean?

511
01:00:05,414 --> 01:00:08,668
This guy obviously did
the research you're talking about.

512
01:00:08,918 --> 01:00:10,753
So why does he take a crowbar. . .

513
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:14,215
. . .to open the vault when
there's a clicker right there?

514
01:00:14,465 --> 01:00:15,383
A clicker?

515
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:18,678
Well, a gizmo, like a VCR remote.

516
01:00:21,264 --> 01:00:23,474
Sounds amazing to me.

517
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:27,645
Must've been a lot
of valuables in that vault.

518
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:34,110
Close to 5 million total value.

519
01:00:36,112 --> 01:00:37,530
Is that funny?

520
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:39,991
I feel like you're trying
to surprise me.

521
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:41,534
I was trying to.

522
01:00:41,993 --> 01:00:43,703
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

523
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:47,456
There you go again.

524
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,796
Would the burglar use a disguise?

525
01:00:54,297 --> 01:00:55,590
Yeah, he might.

526
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:59,051
Get with the program
if you're gonna catch this guy.

527
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:03,097
It is a guy we think, anyway.
Some sort of a loner? Weirdo?

528
01:01:03,347 --> 01:01:04,640
Maybe like you.

529
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:09,353
Well, I'd be the perfect
prototype, actually.

530
01:01:09,562 --> 01:01:13,149
Except you see a face around
long enough and put things together.

531
01:01:13,399 --> 01:01:16,485
That's why these top guys
have disguises.

532
01:01:16,694 --> 01:01:20,114
Some of them, I even understand,
become makeup experts. . .

533
01:01:20,364 --> 01:01:22,325
. . .hire wigmakers
and things like that.

534
01:01:23,117 --> 01:01:25,036
Go on about the wigmakers.

535
01:01:25,286 --> 01:01:26,162
I would. . . .

536
01:01:27,246 --> 01:01:29,582
I've gotta go have
my pacemaker checked.

537
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,251
It's been so exciting talking to you.

538
01:01:32,877 --> 01:01:36,422
A: You don't have a pacemaker.
And B: I'll be back tomorrow.

539
01:01:37,882 --> 01:01:40,426
Tomorrow is promised to no one.

540
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:45,014
Goodbye.

541
01:01:50,019 --> 01:01:52,104
Pacemaker, my ass.

542
01:02:53,082 --> 01:02:54,917
Oh, Katie.

543
01:02:55,668 --> 01:02:58,629
You gotta start eating
better than this, darling.

544
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:05,094
I'm having this
press conference here. . .

545
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:09,265
. . .because it is here,
at this courthouse. . .

546
01:03:10,182 --> 01:03:13,644
. . .that Christine Sullivan's killer
will be tried.

547
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:17,190
As you know, I came from
an impoverished family. . .

548
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:20,568
...in an impoverished town.

549
01:03:21,861 --> 01:03:23,446
We lived with our doors...

550
01:03:23,821 --> 01:03:25,323
...unlocked.

551
01:03:26,365 --> 01:03:28,868
We all lock our doors now.

552
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:31,829
-That's not what concerns me.
-A ginger ale.

553
01:03:32,038 --> 01:03:34,332
We are also locking our hearts.

554
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,000
Could you turn that off?

555
01:03:36,209 --> 01:03:38,211
-That is the sadness.
-In a second.

556
01:03:38,544 --> 01:03:39,629
That. . .

557
01:03:39,879 --> 01:03:41,214
. . .is the loss.

558
01:03:42,423 --> 01:03:44,800
We are locking our hearts
to the weary.

559
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:47,470
We are locking our hearts...

560
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:50,139
... to the poor and their pain.

561
01:03:51,182 --> 01:03:52,475
Sisters and brothers...

562
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:55,394
... we are locking our hearts
to ourselves.

563
01:03:59,982 --> 01:04:01,150
Turn it back on.

564
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:02,735
-But you said--
-I know. . .

565
01:04:02,944 --> 01:04:03,945
. . .but turn it on.

566
01:04:08,908 --> 01:04:13,412
We feel that savagery and violence
must be allo wed a place at table.

567
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:15,581
That is wrong.
That is not America.

568
01:04:16,457 --> 01:04:18,167
I shall fight that battle.

569
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:19,961
Dear friend. . .

570
01:04:20,461 --> 01:04:22,046
. . .old friend. . .

571
01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:27,260
. . .we shall fight that battle.

572
01:04:32,557 --> 01:04:34,350
Who can explain chance?

573
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:37,270
If we had not met. . .

574
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,772
. . .I would not be President today.

575
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:43,234
If Christine had not taken ill. . .

576
01:04:43,568 --> 01:04:46,445
...she would be with you
in Barbados even now.

577
01:04:47,446 --> 01:04:49,782
Walter, you've been
like a father to me.

578
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,455
I would give the world
to lessen your pain.

579
01:05:12,805 --> 01:05:14,181
Thank you.

580
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:19,020
You heartless whore.

581
01:05:21,856 --> 01:05:24,400
I'm not about to run from you.

582
01:05:27,737 --> 01:05:31,616
Thomas Jefferson used
the Green Room as a dining room.

583
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:34,035
The walls are covered
with green silk. . .

584
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:37,163
. . .just as they were
when James Monroe was President.

585
01:05:37,413 --> 01:05:40,708
Many valuable objects
and paintings in this room.

586
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:42,835
We'll move on to the Blue Room.

587
01:05:44,378 --> 01:05:47,256
James Hoban built
the Blue Room as an oval. . .

588
01:05:47,506 --> 01:05:49,842
. . .to please President Washington.

589
01:05:50,885 --> 01:05:53,012
During the holiday season. . .

590
01:05:53,262 --> 01:05:56,724
. . .the White House Christmas tree
stands in the middle.

591
01:05:56,974 --> 01:06:00,394
The view from the window
includes the Jefferson Memorial.

592
01:06:00,645 --> 01:06:02,980
We'll be moving on to the Red Room.

593
01:06:06,567 --> 01:06:10,613
The walls of the Red Room
are covered with red silk.

594
01:06:14,825 --> 01:06:18,329
He was in the building.
He took a guided tour.

595
01:06:24,335 --> 01:06:26,963
I've never dealt
with blackmail before.

596
01:06:27,213 --> 01:06:30,925
-He doesn't want money.
-You're a mind reader too now.

597
01:06:31,175 --> 01:06:33,636
No, I just looked on the back.

598
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,555
See?

599
01:06:35,805 --> 01:06:37,598
"l don't want money. "

600
01:06:37,848 --> 01:06:40,560
He has the guts of a burglar.
Wish we had him.

601
01:06:40,768 --> 01:06:42,603
Finished your recruiting speech?

602
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:46,941
Because I'd like to know
how I handle this.

603
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:49,485
Like you handled the letter opener?

604
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:58,244
Gee, Bill. . .

605
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:04,125
. . .that could be construed
as criticism.

606
01:07:06,252 --> 01:07:08,087
You want me for an enemy?

607
01:07:08,546 --> 01:07:11,799
I should've called the police
that night but I was weak.

608
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:14,802
You convinced me to stay silent.
I regret that.

609
01:07:15,344 --> 01:07:16,846
Know this:

610
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:20,850
Every time I see your face,
I wanna rip your throat out.

611
01:07:28,232 --> 01:07:29,525
Fine.

612
01:07:31,986 --> 01:07:34,113
You win the pissing contest.

613
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,710
What do I do?

614
01:07:47,919 --> 01:07:49,170
Nothing.

615
01:07:49,378 --> 01:07:52,882
He's making a mistake.
He thinks he has time. He doesn't.

616
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,885
Seth Frank's too good.
He'll bring him in.

617
01:07:56,636 --> 01:07:57,803
Then what?

618
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,556
Then I kill him.

619
01:08:08,314 --> 01:08:09,607
Miss Whitney?

620
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:11,234
Thanks.

621
01:08:21,244 --> 01:08:22,370
Miss Whitney?

622
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:25,957
I'm Seth Frank. Excuse me.

623
01:08:33,172 --> 01:08:34,382
Thanks.

624
01:08:38,344 --> 01:08:41,889
For a tough prosecutor, you sure
don't resemble your reputation.

625
01:08:43,182 --> 01:08:44,517
Is that good or bad?

626
01:08:48,813 --> 01:08:49,814
I don't know.

627
01:08:52,358 --> 01:08:55,027
Look, lieutenant,
I told you on the phone.

628
01:08:55,444 --> 01:08:59,699
I'm not involved with my father.
So this is a waste of time.

629
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:03,160
Do you expect me to walk out of here?

630
01:09:05,621 --> 01:09:06,706
All right.

631
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,251
All right.

632
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:12,962
Your father disappeared.

633
01:09:16,173 --> 01:09:18,217
-I need your help.
-Look.

634
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:20,720
Lieutenant, I don't know the man.

635
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:25,099
He was in jail. When he got out,
my mom and I lived by ourselves.

636
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:27,602
He doesn't care about me.

637
01:09:27,852 --> 01:09:29,854
I've seen him once this past year.

638
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:31,522
Yeah, when?

639
01:09:32,857 --> 01:09:33,774
A few days ago.

640
01:09:35,568 --> 01:09:39,280
He said he might leave town.
I helped you. Can I work now?

641
01:09:40,448 --> 01:09:43,117
-Any idea where he went?
-Quit wasting my time.

642
01:09:43,367 --> 01:09:45,494
He doesn't want you to find him,
you won't.

643
01:09:45,745 --> 01:09:47,997
You're saying
he skipped the country?

644
01:09:48,206 --> 01:09:50,625
I'm saying you won't recognize him.

645
01:09:51,584 --> 01:09:53,544
He could be right around the corner.

646
01:09:55,463 --> 01:09:57,381
-He always had a safe house.
-Where?

647
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:58,424
He never said.

648
01:09:58,674 --> 01:10:00,301
How do you know he had one?

649
01:10:02,053 --> 01:10:03,888
My mother loved him, all right?

650
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:08,476
Even after she left him, when she was
dying, he was all she talked about.

651
01:10:09,518 --> 01:10:11,771
"lf only he hadn't done this.

652
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:14,690
-If only he hadn't done that. "
-What else?

653
01:10:19,612 --> 01:10:21,906
-How long has he lived here?
-Years.

654
01:10:22,156 --> 01:10:23,449
Never been.

655
01:10:27,912 --> 01:10:30,998
This is a strange place
for a thief to leave a key.

656
01:10:31,249 --> 01:10:33,251
He always did that.

657
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:54,165
He left in a hurry. I wonder what
scares a professional thief like that.

658
01:12:05,885 --> 01:12:08,137
He wasn't at these places.

659
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:12,516
My college graduation. . .

660
01:12:14,018 --> 01:12:17,688
. . .my law school graduation,
the night my mother and l. . .

661
01:12:17,897 --> 01:12:22,109
. . .we went out to celebrate
because I'd gotten my first job.

662
01:12:22,944 --> 01:12:25,488
Me alone on the steps.
I'd won my first case.

663
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:31,369
I used to think sometimes. . . .

664
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:40,044
Sometimes I'd come home and could sense
that he'd been in the apartment.

665
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:45,550
That he'd checked the fridge, shook
his head because I never ate right.

666
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:50,680
I mean, I know it sounds crazy,
but I've always. . . .

667
01:12:51,264 --> 01:12:53,599
I've always felt
that he was around.

668
01:12:54,183 --> 01:12:56,644
You can do a good thing.
Help me bring him in.

669
01:12:56,894 --> 01:12:59,021
Leave a message
you're worried about him.

670
01:12:59,522 --> 01:13:00,523
No.

671
01:13:00,731 --> 01:13:03,651
It's true. You're worried.
This is no normal case.

672
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:06,988
His life is in danger.
You call, you could save him.

673
01:13:07,613 --> 01:13:08,865
He won't come.

674
01:13:09,073 --> 01:13:11,534
Of course he'll come.
You're all he has.

675
01:13:11,993 --> 01:13:15,371
He's on the run and he's scared
because he'll get caught.

676
01:13:15,788 --> 01:13:18,332
-You don't know the heat.
-He's not a murderer.

677
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:20,877
Maybe he is innocent.

678
01:13:21,419 --> 01:13:24,255
If that's true, I'll have him
home in a few hours.

679
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:29,844
What if a hotshot trying to
make a reputation tracks him down?

680
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:34,807
I can guarantee his safety.

681
01:13:35,057 --> 01:13:37,560
You make the call,
I'll make a promise.

682
01:13:38,102 --> 01:13:39,604
You'll have him back.

683
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:00,541
-Seth Frank.
-Hi.

684
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:03,669
I left a message on his machine.

685
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,090
He called me back within the hour
and I'm meeting him tomorrow.

686
01:14:08,758 --> 01:14:09,884
Where?

687
01:14:11,469 --> 01:14:14,055
Open-air place near my office,
Cafe Alonzo.

688
01:14:14,847 --> 01:14:15,806
What time?

689
01:14:16,641 --> 01:14:18,059
Four o 'clock.

690
01:14:19,185 --> 01:14:20,978
It'll be deserted then.

691
01:14:22,522 --> 01:14:24,315
Sounds good. Thanks a lot.

692
01:14:24,524 --> 01:14:26,400
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

693
01:15:16,117 --> 01:15:17,451
Dad, hi.

694
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,787
It's Kate calling.

695
01:15:19,996 --> 01:15:24,000
I was wondering
if you could call me, please.

696
01:15:25,209 --> 01:15:29,171
There's some things I'd like
to talk with you about...

697
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,842
...and maybe even get together,
if that's possible.

698
01:15:33,092 --> 01:15:34,385
Okay?

699
01:15:34,969 --> 01:15:38,139
Thanks and talk to you soon. Bye.

700
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,769
Dad, hi.

701
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:46,105
It's Kate calling.

702
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:50,651
I was wondering
if you could call me, please.

703
01:15:51,569 --> 01:15:55,448
There's some things I'd like
to talk with you about...

704
01:15:55,698 --> 01:15:57,074
...and maybe even get together.

705
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:25,520
So you all know where and when
you're supposed to be there.

706
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:27,605
He's slippery. He's an eel.

707
01:16:27,855 --> 01:16:29,982
He gets a whiff of a cop,
he disappears.

708
01:16:30,233 --> 01:16:32,193
Nobody moves until I order you.

709
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:34,278
Then we move in on him.

710
01:16:34,529 --> 01:16:38,991
Expect Whitney to show up at 4.
His daughter will be waiting for him.

711
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,869
It's important to stay
in your positions. . .

712
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:44,914
. . .until you hear the order
to move in on him.

713
01:17:17,572 --> 01:17:18,447
Here you go.

714
01:17:18,656 --> 01:17:20,366
Could I have some cream?

715
01:17:37,592 --> 01:17:39,719
Gather around, gentlemen.

716
01:17:40,678 --> 01:17:43,306
Nobody moves till
the suspect's in place.

717
01:17:43,556 --> 01:17:45,016
Any questions?

718
01:17:45,558 --> 01:17:47,435
See you at the Alonzo.

719
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,103
Boss is grateful.

720
01:17:49,312 --> 01:17:51,856
He'd appreciate
an eyewitness at the capture.

721
01:17:52,106 --> 01:17:54,108
This is our guy.

722
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,528
If he isn't, he sure disappeared fast.
See you there.

723
01:19:22,613 --> 01:19:23,990
Tums?

724
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:26,492
I got my own.

725
01:19:48,014 --> 01:19:49,640
Come on, Kate.

726
01:19:50,057 --> 01:19:52,560
-She gonna show?
-Yeah, she'll be here.

727
01:21:37,748 --> 01:21:38,916
Miss?

728
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:41,627
What you want, please?

729
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,255
Nothing. Thank you.

730
01:21:44,463 --> 01:21:45,882
Got to.

731
01:21:46,924 --> 01:21:47,758
Pardon?

732
01:21:48,384 --> 01:21:50,303
You sit, you eat, please.

733
01:21:51,012 --> 01:21:54,348
Jeez, this guy wasn't part
of my master plan.

734
01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:56,475
Unbelievable.

735
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:58,978
I'm waiting for someone.

736
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:01,731
Oh, he must eat too, please.

737
01:22:01,939 --> 01:22:04,400
He will. We will.
We're gonna. . . .

738
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:07,069
We'll order half the menu.
Just not now.

739
01:22:10,364 --> 01:22:13,117
Maybe that's him disguised
as a Chinaman.

740
01:23:09,799 --> 01:23:11,467
Check out this guy in the hat.

741
01:23:14,095 --> 01:23:16,305
I believe that's our man.

742
01:23:17,098 --> 01:23:19,475
All units, suspect's approaching.

743
01:23:19,725 --> 01:23:21,811
Stay in place.
Wait for my signal.

744
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:40,788
I did not kill her.
I want you to believe that.

745
01:23:45,001 --> 01:23:47,211
Just hold on.
Let him get settled.

746
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:51,924
You've gotta believe that.

747
01:23:55,177 --> 01:23:56,929
I think we're ready.

748
01:24:11,027 --> 01:24:11,861
Damn it!

749
01:24:42,642 --> 01:24:43,476
Almost.

750
01:24:50,858 --> 01:24:51,943
You okay?

751
01:24:52,276 --> 01:24:53,736
What was that?

752
01:24:55,238 --> 01:24:57,073
Anyone see where those came from?

753
01:24:57,323 --> 01:24:59,867
-Did you do that?
-No, we didn't do it!

754
01:25:00,117 --> 01:25:02,036
Anyone see where
those shots came from?

755
01:25:05,623 --> 01:25:06,832
Where's Whitney?

756
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:09,752
Quit standing around here!
Go find him!

757
01:25:17,301 --> 01:25:18,135
Take it easy.

758
01:25:18,386 --> 01:25:19,679
Take it easy.

759
01:25:19,929 --> 01:25:22,515
Take it easy, now.
Stay calm. Stay calm.

760
01:25:22,765 --> 01:25:24,767
There's no reason to panic.

761
01:25:25,059 --> 01:25:28,104
If everyone will just
kindly take it easy.

762
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:52,253
Messy.

763
01:25:52,712 --> 01:25:54,380
I like that in a woman.

764
01:25:57,592 --> 01:25:58,759
Here.

765
01:26:03,014 --> 01:26:05,016
I got a few numbers here.

766
01:26:05,516 --> 01:26:07,310
The top one's. . .

767
01:26:08,019 --> 01:26:11,105
. . .local police. That's
my office, my home, beeper.

768
01:26:11,981 --> 01:26:14,734
I live alone too.
You can call anytime.

769
01:26:17,695 --> 01:26:19,572
Want me to get
someone to stay here?

770
01:26:20,907 --> 01:26:23,409
No, I wanna get some sleep.

771
01:26:23,659 --> 01:26:25,912
Surveillance is outside
until it's over.

772
01:26:26,162 --> 01:26:28,539
I've got a feeling he'll contact you.

773
01:26:29,707 --> 01:26:31,626
You're on a hot streak, I guess.

774
01:26:33,044 --> 01:26:34,837
Listen, I'm sorry.

775
01:26:39,008 --> 01:26:41,052
Anything unusual at all. . .

776
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:43,179
. . .call right away.

777
01:26:43,429 --> 01:26:44,931
It's not a bother.

778
01:26:47,016 --> 01:26:48,309
I live alone.

779
01:26:50,311 --> 01:26:51,938
You said.

780
01:26:53,356 --> 01:26:54,857
Feeble.

781
01:26:58,402 --> 01:27:00,571
You want something for the road?

782
01:27:02,532 --> 01:27:04,242
I got water and water.

783
01:27:06,577 --> 01:27:07,453
Deal.

784
01:27:23,094 --> 01:27:25,096
A Pellegrino would be great.

785
01:27:27,223 --> 01:27:29,475
What's so funny?
I say it wrong?

786
01:27:31,018 --> 01:27:32,812
I'm tired.

787
01:27:33,688 --> 01:27:35,314
I'm just tired.

788
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,618
Listen. . .

789
01:27:47,827 --> 01:27:49,495
. . .there's one thing. . .

790
01:27:50,371 --> 01:27:52,206
. . .I forgot to tell you.

791
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,960
I live alone.

792
01:28:01,215 --> 01:28:02,675
Lock up behind me.

793
01:28:08,347 --> 01:28:09,932
-How's that?
-Real good.

794
01:28:10,141 --> 01:28:12,018
Now get some sleep.

795
01:28:12,727 --> 01:28:14,312
Thank you.

796
01:28:21,986 --> 01:28:24,947
I betrayed you twice, Luther.
You should know that.

797
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:27,033
You're not the first.

798
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:35,583
Why'd you come?

799
01:28:36,459 --> 01:28:39,086
I can't have my daughter
thinking I was a murderer.

800
01:28:42,048 --> 01:28:45,384
No, I mean this afternoon.
Why'd you come?

801
01:28:45,635 --> 01:28:48,429
You suspected something
or you wouldn't have prepared.

802
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:50,806
My daughter wanted to see me.

803
01:28:56,812 --> 01:28:59,982
The robbery was going fine
until they came in.

804
01:29:00,441 --> 01:29:01,692
They were drunk.

805
01:29:01,943 --> 01:29:04,153
I was hidden in the vault.

806
01:29:04,362 --> 01:29:06,697
And the sex had started
getting rough. . .

807
01:29:06,906 --> 01:29:08,950
. . .and he started beating her. . .

808
01:29:09,242 --> 01:29:12,119
. . .started strangling her.
I thought he'd kill her.

809
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:16,249
Then she somehow got the upper hand.

810
01:29:16,707 --> 01:29:20,711
She was gonna stab him with
a letter opener and two guys shot her.

811
01:29:21,712 --> 01:29:24,215
The same two guys
who tried for you today.

812
01:29:25,841 --> 01:29:27,093
Possibly.

813
01:29:27,343 --> 01:29:29,679
Unless Walter Sullivan
was taking a shot.

814
01:29:32,014 --> 01:29:34,016
It's a pretty powerful enemy.

815
01:29:34,267 --> 01:29:36,060
That's very good going.

816
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:40,731
Not as powerful as
the President of the United States.

817
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,026
That's right.

818
01:29:44,277 --> 01:29:46,612
Alan Richmond, he was the drunk.

819
01:29:47,488 --> 01:29:49,407
The two guys were Secret Service.

820
01:29:49,657 --> 01:29:52,368
Chief of Staff Russell
handled the cover-up.

821
01:29:53,327 --> 01:29:55,872
Well, then you go to the police.

822
01:29:56,163 --> 01:29:59,208
That's what innocent people do.
They go to the police.

823
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:00,877
Sure.

824
01:30:01,085 --> 01:30:02,795
That young man who was here. . .

825
01:30:03,045 --> 01:30:05,673
. . .he'd believe me
over the President, right?

826
01:30:07,091 --> 01:30:08,676
Why should I believe you?

827
01:30:10,469 --> 01:30:12,555
Because I swear to you, Kate.

828
01:30:13,014 --> 01:30:14,974
I swear to you on Mattie's grave.

829
01:30:16,309 --> 01:30:17,351
That's right.

830
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:21,731
Your mother's grave. I'd kill myself
before I'd lie about that.

831
01:30:23,566 --> 01:30:25,276
Oh, Jesus, Luther.

832
01:30:25,526 --> 01:30:27,570
-Yeah. I know.
-They'll kill you.

833
01:30:30,072 --> 01:30:32,783
-I know.
-Can you run?

834
01:30:34,535 --> 01:30:38,206
I was all set to.
I was at the airport ready to go.

835
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,125
Then there was that press conference.

836
01:30:42,126 --> 01:30:45,713
And there was Richmond
using old man Sullivan.

837
01:30:47,757 --> 01:30:50,301
You know, I might not
have been able to. . .

838
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:53,012
. . .save Christy Sullivan. . .

839
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:55,598
. . .but I didn't even try.

840
01:30:57,266 --> 01:30:58,851
What are you gonna do?

841
01:31:02,271 --> 01:31:04,315
I'll think of something.

842
01:31:13,407 --> 01:31:16,202
I watched you argue a case last year.

843
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:17,453
You won it.

844
01:31:18,746 --> 01:31:21,249
Thank God you got
your mother's brains.

845
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:23,876
Dangerous outside.

846
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:28,214
It always is.

847
01:31:50,194 --> 01:31:51,821
Excuse me.

848
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:54,407
Could you give this
to Gloria Russell?

849
01:31:54,657 --> 01:31:58,494
-Anything for me to sign?
-No, you have an honest face.

850
01:32:37,742 --> 01:32:39,577
Oh, my God.

851
01:33:01,766 --> 01:33:03,392
You're a vision tonight.

852
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:06,896
Thank you, Mr. President.

853
01:33:07,396 --> 01:33:09,899
And thank you, Mr. President.

854
01:33:10,107 --> 01:33:12,527
For. . .?
Come again.

855
01:33:18,282 --> 01:33:19,116
You know.

856
01:33:23,454 --> 01:33:26,290
You sent it to me this afternoon.

857
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:29,001
Of course.

858
01:33:31,379 --> 01:33:34,048
Would you excuse me, all?

859
01:33:34,298 --> 01:33:37,969
I'm overcome with a desire
to dance with my chief of staff.

860
01:33:38,636 --> 01:33:40,888
Look after this for me, would you?

861
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,079
What is this nonsense?

862
01:34:05,371 --> 01:34:07,373
I'm hoping there's an explanation.

863
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:10,626
Your gift, Alan. I was. . .

864
01:34:10,877 --> 01:34:12,378
. . .overwhelmed.

865
01:34:12,628 --> 01:34:16,132
And, you know, your note
was so gratifying.

866
01:34:21,429 --> 01:34:22,680
I sent a note?

867
01:34:23,514 --> 01:34:25,349
Yes, yes.

868
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,894
You think I don't know your writing?

869
01:34:28,144 --> 01:34:30,980
I assumed you wanted me
to wear it tonight.

870
01:34:31,397 --> 01:34:34,066
-Gloria, it's lovely.
-Yes.

871
01:34:34,275 --> 01:34:35,943
And you know what else?

872
01:34:37,195 --> 01:34:38,446
What, Alan?

873
01:34:40,823 --> 01:34:43,367
Christy wore it the night
she was killed.

874
01:34:51,209 --> 01:34:52,460
Know what this means?

875
01:34:52,668 --> 01:34:53,920
No.

876
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:55,963
Whitney's been heard from.

877
01:35:03,554 --> 01:35:06,140
It's not precisely the first time.

878
01:35:09,977 --> 01:35:12,063
You been keeping things from me?

879
01:35:14,065 --> 01:35:17,902
Well, it's just that you have
so much on your plate.

880
01:35:18,152 --> 01:35:20,196
We wanted to spare you.

881
01:35:24,575 --> 01:35:27,161
He sent me a Polaroid. . .

882
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:29,747
. . .of the letter opener yesterday.

883
01:35:45,805 --> 01:35:47,890
I have to give this some thought.

884
01:35:52,019 --> 01:35:54,146
Come to my office in the morning.

885
01:35:55,273 --> 01:35:58,317
This'll make an interesting
chapter in my memoirs.

886
01:36:12,498 --> 01:36:14,709
Do we know who the forger is?

887
01:36:14,959 --> 01:36:19,171
I talked to Seth Frank. Apparently,
Whitney learned how in prison.

888
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,385
A gifted man.

889
01:36:26,137 --> 01:36:27,638
How close are we to him?

890
01:36:28,389 --> 01:36:30,391
We're working around the clock.

891
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:34,187
Well, that's good to know.

892
01:36:35,354 --> 01:36:36,689
He'll make a mistake.

893
01:36:37,481 --> 01:36:39,400
Well, that's good to know too.

894
01:36:47,283 --> 01:36:48,534
There is. . .

895
01:36:48,743 --> 01:36:50,661
. . .one other thing. . .

896
01:36:51,454 --> 01:36:53,372
. . .that we need to take care of.

897
01:36:55,958 --> 01:36:57,960
He has a daughter, doesn't he?

898
01:36:59,879 --> 01:37:01,464
You sure you wanna do that?

899
01:37:04,175 --> 01:37:05,426
Sir?

900
01:37:10,306 --> 01:37:14,310
She's a young prosecutor.
Prosecutors ask questions.

901
01:37:16,604 --> 01:37:18,773
Maybe she knows what he knows.

902
01:37:23,903 --> 01:37:25,488
Let's get cracking, boys.

903
01:37:29,534 --> 01:37:31,661
Show that you love your country.

904
01:37:56,477 --> 01:37:57,937
How's Kate doing?

905
01:37:58,354 --> 01:37:59,438
Where are you?

906
01:37:59,647 --> 01:38:02,358
I won't hang around for you
to trace the call.

907
01:38:02,567 --> 01:38:03,985
Just answer the question.

908
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:06,487
She couldn't be in better hands.

909
01:38:06,696 --> 01:38:10,032
Secret Service is
taking over surveillance.

910
01:38:13,578 --> 01:38:14,829
Hello?

911
01:38:18,457 --> 01:38:19,834
Hello?

912
01:41:30,483 --> 01:41:32,318
It's entered in the chart.

913
01:41:33,236 --> 01:41:36,489
We upped her from
250 to 500 milligrams.

914
01:42:17,947 --> 01:42:20,283
Nurse, I need you right away, please.

915
01:42:20,867 --> 01:42:22,368
He's having a seizure.

916
01:43:27,475 --> 01:43:30,144
Dr. Kevorkian, I presume.

917
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:35,149
My guess is that this is right
in your carotid artery about now.

918
01:43:36,067 --> 01:43:38,319
You're gonna get a little woozy.

919
01:43:38,778 --> 01:43:40,613
But if I give you the rest. . .

920
01:43:40,863 --> 01:43:44,116
. . .it'll fry your brain down
to the size of a peanut.

921
01:43:44,534 --> 01:43:45,785
Drop that.

922
01:44:00,883 --> 01:44:02,260
Luther. . .

923
01:44:03,302 --> 01:44:04,637
. . .he was my President.

924
01:44:05,555 --> 01:44:07,265
Right or wrong.

925
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:10,226
Well, he made a mistake.

926
01:44:10,434 --> 01:44:11,811
You made a mistake.

927
01:44:14,564 --> 01:44:18,109
When you went after my girl,
that was entirely unacceptable.

928
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:21,904
Mercy.

929
01:44:25,074 --> 01:44:26,492
I'm fresh out.

930
01:44:36,961 --> 01:44:38,045
Daddy?

931
01:44:41,883 --> 01:44:43,426
Go to sleep, darling.

932
01:45:15,416 --> 01:45:17,126
Oh, Jesus!

933
01:45:19,295 --> 01:45:20,796
Just one question.

934
01:45:21,047 --> 01:45:25,009
Did Walter Sullivan say
why Christy didn't go to Barbados?

935
01:45:26,052 --> 01:45:28,179
Just that she changed her mind.

936
01:45:29,096 --> 01:45:31,057
You know who did it, don't you?

937
01:45:32,934 --> 01:45:35,895
So will you.
Check your phones.

938
01:45:41,943 --> 01:45:43,611
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.

939
01:46:04,632 --> 01:46:06,717
You're taking a shortcut, Tommy?

940
01:46:10,096 --> 01:46:12,807
I'm your substitute driver tonight.

941
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:16,519
Don't worry about Tommy.
He's fine.

942
01:46:17,228 --> 01:46:19,063
Very unusual.

943
01:46:19,856 --> 01:46:21,566
What do I call you?

944
01:46:22,483 --> 01:46:24,068
Luther, sir.

945
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:29,198
And are you familiar with
how to get to my townhouse, Luther?

946
01:46:29,448 --> 01:46:31,158
Oh, yes, sir.

947
01:46:31,367 --> 01:46:33,411
I know where all your houses are.

948
01:46:33,619 --> 01:46:35,746
I'm the man who robbed you.

949
01:46:39,166 --> 01:46:41,502
You're the man who tried to kill me.

950
01:46:43,462 --> 01:46:45,756
I'm sorry I missed.

951
01:46:47,174 --> 01:46:49,927
I believe in the Old Testament, sir.

952
01:46:50,428 --> 01:46:52,889
There's nothing wrong with
an eye for an eye. . .

953
01:46:53,139 --> 01:46:54,849
. . .when a terrible deed is done.

954
01:46:55,683 --> 01:46:57,852
A deed such as yours.

955
01:46:58,728 --> 01:47:00,563
You'd like to believe that.

956
01:47:00,771 --> 01:47:03,274
That'd be simple for you
to believe that.

957
01:47:03,482 --> 01:47:05,776
What do I have to gain by being here?

958
01:47:06,611 --> 01:47:08,112
I have no idea.

959
01:47:08,362 --> 01:47:09,989
You going to rob me again?

960
01:47:10,364 --> 01:47:12,700
I don't need your money, Mr. Sullivan.

961
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:15,369
Did you check your vault lately?

962
01:47:16,037 --> 01:47:18,080
I put everything back.

963
01:47:19,624 --> 01:47:23,085
I'm afraid we're a little late
for an attempt at leniency.

964
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:29,759
A lot of crap's coming
down tonight, sir.

965
01:47:29,967 --> 01:47:31,677
You wanna be a player or not?

966
01:47:31,928 --> 01:47:34,472
You wanna know what happened
or don't you?

967
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:36,432
Because I was there.

968
01:47:37,058 --> 01:47:38,476
I want to know.

969
01:47:39,101 --> 01:47:41,479
You think you can stand
hearing about it?

970
01:47:41,729 --> 01:47:44,065
How he beat her,
tried to strangle her?

971
01:47:44,315 --> 01:47:46,025
You really wanna know?

972
01:47:47,276 --> 01:47:49,820
I could walk through fire.

973
01:47:51,405 --> 01:47:53,533
I was in the vault when they came in.

974
01:47:53,741 --> 01:47:55,409
They were drunk.

975
01:47:55,618 --> 01:47:57,036
He knocked her around.

976
01:47:57,245 --> 01:47:59,163
She fought back.

977
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,249
He got really rough.

978
01:48:01,499 --> 01:48:03,543
She tried to defend herself.

979
01:48:03,751 --> 01:48:05,628
Well, he started screaming. . .

980
01:48:05,836 --> 01:48:08,506
. . .sniveling simp he is.

981
01:48:08,714 --> 01:48:10,341
Who else was in my house?

982
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:13,261
Secret Service.
They're the ones who shot her.

983
01:48:14,053 --> 01:48:15,096
Nonsense.

984
01:48:15,888 --> 01:48:18,057
Gloria Russell handled the cover-up.

985
01:48:18,266 --> 01:48:19,350
Stop this!

986
01:48:19,809 --> 01:48:21,435
You wanna know who it was?

987
01:48:21,644 --> 01:48:22,812
It was you.

988
01:48:23,312 --> 01:48:27,066
Come on, Mr. Sullivan.
We're too old to bullshit each other.

989
01:48:27,692 --> 01:48:28,901
Who was it, then?

990
01:48:29,110 --> 01:48:30,611
You know.

991
01:48:33,364 --> 01:48:34,782
Don't shake your head.

992
01:48:38,661 --> 01:48:41,956
When you're alone and rage takes over
and you want revenge. . .

993
01:48:42,206 --> 01:48:44,625
. . .what face do you put
with your enemy?

994
01:48:58,556 --> 01:48:59,932
Stop the car!

995
01:49:00,141 --> 01:49:01,809
We're going straight ahead.

996
01:49:04,061 --> 01:49:05,605
This is too terrible.

997
01:49:05,855 --> 01:49:07,565
Yes, it is.

998
01:49:09,317 --> 01:49:14,030
I know about Alan's reputation
as a philanderer. . .

999
01:49:14,697 --> 01:49:17,074
. . .but he'd never dream
of betraying me.

1000
01:49:19,827 --> 01:49:22,371
I gave him the Presidency.

1001
01:49:23,164 --> 01:49:24,790
Remember that press conference?

1002
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:27,418
Where he put his arm
around you and said. . .

1003
01:49:27,668 --> 01:49:31,547
. . .if Christy hadn't been sick,
she'd have been in Barbados with you?

1004
01:49:31,756 --> 01:49:34,091
How the hell did he know
she was sick?

1005
01:49:34,926 --> 01:49:36,594
You didn't tell anyone.

1006
01:49:36,844 --> 01:49:39,055
It's because she told him that night.

1007
01:49:39,305 --> 01:49:41,390
I was right there watching.

1008
01:49:42,683 --> 01:49:44,685
That's not real proof.

1009
01:49:46,979 --> 01:49:48,606
Well, maybe this is, then.

1010
01:49:54,737 --> 01:49:56,322
You could've stolen this.

1011
01:49:57,782 --> 01:49:59,116
I did steal it.

1012
01:49:59,367 --> 01:50:02,828
But that's not my blood on there
and that's not my prints.

1013
01:50:30,481 --> 01:50:32,233
Mr. Sullivan.

1014
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,626
I did love her, you know.

1015
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:13,316
Jeez, Burton.

1016
01:51:59,904 --> 01:52:03,783
Is he working late? I don't have
an appointment but I want to see him.

1017
01:52:04,033 --> 01:52:06,285
You don't need an appointment.

1018
01:52:19,298 --> 01:52:20,633
Let's go, Miss Russell.

1019
01:53:03,301 --> 01:53:04,677
Walter.

1020
01:53:04,969 --> 01:53:05,803
Come in.

1021
01:53:10,141 --> 01:53:12,643
We interrupt with a breaking story...

1022
01:53:12,894 --> 01:53:15,146
... that's shocking
the nation and the world.

1023
01:53:15,396 --> 01:53:19,901
Information just came from the White
House about a tragedy within the hour.

1024
01:53:20,109 --> 01:53:22,028
We go now to our correspondent.

1025
01:53:22,278 --> 01:53:24,113
Diane, what can you tell us?

1026
01:53:26,115 --> 01:53:31,162
Sources tell us Walter Sullivan
had seen President Richmond tonight.

1027
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:34,498
That was for an unscheduled
private meeting.

1028
01:53:44,967 --> 01:53:46,802
You're still here.

1029
01:53:49,805 --> 01:53:51,140
I'm still here.

1030
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,486
--I would not be President.

1031
01:54:05,029 --> 01:54:08,074
If Christine had not taken ill. ..

1032
01:54:08,741 --> 01:54:11,410
...she would be with you
in Barbados even now.

1033
01:54:15,122 --> 01:54:17,917
Walter, you've been
like a father to me.

1034
01:54:18,167 --> 01:54:20,753
This is the President's
most recent news conference...

1035
01:54:20,962 --> 01:54:22,797
... where he clearly outlined...

1036
01:54:23,005 --> 01:54:25,800
...his loyalty to philanthropist
and friend, Sullivan.

1037
01:54:26,008 --> 01:54:29,136
The President vowed to find
Sullivan 's wife 's killer.

1038
01:54:29,387 --> 01:54:33,516
Sullivan had a meeting with the
President. Unknown what they discussed.

1039
01:54:33,766 --> 01:54:36,143
Now to the White House
for a live interview.

1040
01:54:36,602 --> 01:54:40,731
Have you no idea why the President
would take his own life?

1041
01:54:41,691 --> 01:54:46,445
I know he's been feeling the pressure
of office, more than ever, lately.

1042
01:54:46,946 --> 01:54:48,990
He talked about it a great deal.

1043
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:51,284
But why would he stab himself?

1044
01:54:54,912 --> 01:54:57,707
That's a question that will
haunt me forever.

1045
01:55:00,710 --> 01:55:03,796
Of course I tried to stop him.

1046
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:06,716
Alan...

1047
01:55:06,966 --> 01:55:08,759
... was like a son to me.

1048
01:55:53,262 --> 01:55:55,056
Was that Seth?

1049
01:55:58,226 --> 01:56:01,687
I think he'd like to come over
for supper when you get well.

1050
01:56:08,611 --> 01:56:10,488
You don't have to fuss.

1051
01:56:10,696 --> 01:56:11,948
I know.

1052
01:56:18,246 --> 01:56:19,914
Am I gonna be all right?

1053
01:56:21,499 --> 01:56:22,792
Yeah.

1054
01:56:23,918 --> 01:56:26,045
We're gonna be just fine.
