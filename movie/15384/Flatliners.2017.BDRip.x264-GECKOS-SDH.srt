Hello, Lauren.

How are you feeling?

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,310
You had a seizure tonight.

do you know that your heart stopped?

37
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
You were gone for several minutes,

38
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,270
but the trauma team brought you back.

39
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,030
Do you remember any of that?

40
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,350
If you felt anything, if you saw anything?

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,390
Did you lose someone, sweetheart?

Whatever is wrong is
in his spinal column, not his brain.

And what medical protocol are you citing?

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,150
The protocol of actually living
in the real world,

62
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,550
where guys with crappy HMOs
go undiagnosed for spinal injuries.

63

Actually, he's on seizure meds,

64

115

You use it to remember

A lumbar puncture, then MRI of the brain.

All of you.

You.

And we are not in the business of
training country club doctors,

151

nor do we waste our time
on students who think

of making new discoveries

on human knowledge.

And for those of you who think
that's too much,

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,350
Marlo, if I were to tell you

160
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,870
that the patient's family
background was Mediterranean,

161
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,350
i.e., Greek or Turkish,
what would the diagnosis be?

(PAGES TURNING)

163
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,510
I don't think you'll find it
in your notebook.

164
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,990
It's Behcet's disease.

165
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,750
Thank you, Ray.

166
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,510
Moving on.

You're a trust-fund kid.
You sleep on a sailboat.

Yeah, but there's this really hot caterer

- I've been trying to meet.
- Ah.

172
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,990
Look at all these stodgy
old docs with their white wine

173
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,870
and their golf games.

174

I don't think it's such a bad life.

(SCOFFS) I don't know about you,

but I'm certainly not gonna spend
the next 40 years doing prostate exams.

177

No one pays their dues anymore.

it's all about entrepreneurship.

I'm gonna be the Anderson Cooper

"Oh, hi, Mom. It's my afternoon check-in."

185

That's funny. Cool. Okay.

186
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,440
You know there's nothing
I can do about her right now.

187
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,630
Did she really move here
just to keep tabs on you?

You're so behind.

Okay, sir, got to give
you a testicular exam.

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,710
- Should just take a minute.
- What? No.

- Excuse the reach.
- Wait a... Wait a minute!

I don't enjoy it either.

I'm the candy-stripe girl.

He doesn't?

205
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,430
It says here the resident wanted a neural
test for that guy, not a testicular exam.

Let's go, people. No lunch break today.

First-years are having a wingding.

217
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,270
Dorm punch and a deejay,
but I'm not above it.

218

I can't wait for the anesthesia rotation.

Those guys have access to the best drugs.

Looking for this?

See you later.

(CHUCKLES) These second-years have no tact,

225
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,270
coming up to me like that
in front of my colleague.

Yeah, we're colleagues, aren't we?

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,270
I mean, we have fun together.

Yeah, kinda.

Do you want to have fun with me later?

230
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,550
Courtney Holmes, I am mildly surprised

231

to be having this conversation with you.

232
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,390
But offer accepted.

Midnight, basement, sub level C.

(CHUCKLES) You want
to meet me in the basement?

235

Sublevel C, underneath the old building.

236
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,310
And take the service elevator,

237
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,670
'cause it doesn't have
surveillance cameras.

Yeah. Good idea.

Come on, we don't have much time.

Okay, Courtney, what's going on?

247
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,750
It's past midnight. I should be studying.

COURTNEY: They put this in five years ago.

In case of a natural
disaster, loss of power.

253
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,350
It's a fully functioning hospital,

Whoa.

Um, Court, what exactly are you up to?

- Um...
- Wow.

257
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,990
Two of you.

258
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,320
Jamie, what are you doing here?

259
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,790
JAMIE: Uh, she didn't tell me
about you either, okay?

260
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,030
But, I'm open to a three-way.

261
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,190
Ew. Shut up.

262
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,600
(CHUCKLES) What?

263
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,950
Oh, I like it!

264
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,710
Scanners, cameras, our choice of beds.

265
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,630
- We can be as loud as we want.
- Courtney, what's going on?

266
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,870
I asked for his help, too.
He probably misinterpreted.

267
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,870
Oh. Oh, you mean we're not getting it on?

268
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,470
Wait, what are you talking about?

269
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,590
I've been searching
for the region of the brain

270
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,140
that is responsible
for near-death experiences.

271
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,550
And these are postmortem scans

272
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,870
of patients that have
died in this hospital.

273
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,070
JAMIE: Is there any
circumstance under which

274
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,640
- you'd have sex with me?
- God, stop.

275
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,590
Look, if the brain is just another organ,

276
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,150
why doesn't it just go dark
and... And shut off

277
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,390
at the moment of death?

278
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,240
You know, why the floating?

279
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,390
Why the white light?

280
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
Why the sense of well-being?

281
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,310
I mean, what is that experience?

282
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,110
Is it chemical, or is it something else?

283
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,630
Can we map that process
the way we map a seizure?

284
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,360
What if we could actually document
what happens to us after we die?

285
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,150
What do you mean?

286
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,190
Nothing happens. We're dead.

287
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,230
What if we could prove otherwise?

288
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,030
Can you imagine
the residency offers you would get?

289
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,830
And forget about Dr. Oz.

290
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,470
I mean, you would be the world's
first specialist in the afterlife.

291
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,470
Okay, you got my attention.

292
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,670
Oh, come on. This isn't science.

293
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,290
- (BEEPS, WHIRRING)
- This is pseudoscience.

294
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,880
Well, maybe. Maybe not.

295
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,270
But the only way to find out
is to see for ourselves.

296
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,830
So I would like you both to stop my heart.

297
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,230
Look, I'll be in the imaging scanner.

298
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,630
It will take real-time pictures
of my brain's hemodynamic activity.

299
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,890
- Um...
- You give it one minute,

300
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,190
and then you bring me back.

301
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,350
Wait, you're serious?

302
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,470
- Stop your heart?
- This is propofol.

303
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,310
Fifty milligrams will knock me out.

304
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,850
I'll be wrapped in a cooling blanket,

305
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,630
bringing my core body temperature
down to 86 degrees.

306
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,310
And once that happens, you administer
a defibrillator shock to stop my heart.

307
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,950
JAMIE: Wait a sec.

308
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,470
Look, I've signed a release.
It's in my bag.

309
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,060
It absolves you both of any responsibility.

310
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,870
Courtney, think about what
you're saying right now.

311
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,640
Hey. Look, if she's insane enough to
try it, who are we to stop her?

312
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,630
- Um...
- Look, I'm young, okay?

313
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
I'm in excellent health.

314
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,280
You're both trained in emergency medicine.

315
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,730
- So reviving me should be.

Died of shock, right?

996

No, he died because of
a mistake that I made.

997
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,110
I gave him epi and Benadryl.

But those two drugs don't cross-react.

999
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,190
He had metoprolol in his system.

1000
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,350
He basically suffocated to death.

1001

I... I'd been on duty for, like, 36 hours,

1002

and I must have screwed up
and forgotten to ask him

Alicia.

1332
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,830

- What? No.

1335
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,550
No, I did not kill anyone.

1336
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,150
I, uh...

1337
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,390
I... I...

1338
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,870
I got her pregnant.

1339
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,510
I wanted to help, you know?

Pay for the abortion, be...
Go with her for the procedure.

1341
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,270
Anyway, uh, the... The day came,

1342
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,710
and I... I couldn't deal with it.

1343
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,390
I... I drove right past.

1344
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,670
I left her to fend for herself.

1345
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,630
And she showed up in your flatline?

1346
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,630
I wish that was all.

1347
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,710
She showed up last night, too.

1348
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,920
So you're being haunted
by somebody that's alive.

Only it wasn't her.

1353
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,910
Just like it wasn't Courtney's sister.

1354
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,320

You could have stabbed yourself.

People on drugs hurt
themselves all the time.

1365
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,910
There has to be a logical explanation.

1366
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,230
I was 17.

1367
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,950
Her name was Irina Wong,
and she had a higher GPA than I did,

1368
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,630
so I hacked her text messages

1369
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,190
and I sent her naked photos
to the whole class.

1370
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,230
It destroyed her.

1371
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,510
What is the point in
confessing all of this?

1372
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,240
This is clearly just happening here.

1373
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,670
- That thing...
- Look, look, Courtney said to me

1374
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,110
she thinks maybe we opened a door.

1375
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,430
Wait, so you knew?

1376
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,230
You and Courtney knew there was
a downside to flatlining,

1377
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,010
and... And you still let
me and Marlo go in?

1378
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,890
Hey, look, I thought it was
just part of the experience.

1379
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,270
Side effects may include

1380
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,310
dry mouth, hallucinations,
existential dread.

1381
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,470
I did not know that
the side effects would show up

1382
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,150
and start hunting us down.

1383
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,150
There is a scientific explanation
to all of this.

1384
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,470
We're way beyond explanations.

1385
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,990
Okay.

1386
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,350
If Courtney was right,

1387
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,670
whatever's happening to us,

1388
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,910
these hallucinations, these hauntings,
whatever it is,

1389
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,230
it's only gonna get worse.

is gonna kill all of us, too.

01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,390
I pulled the autopsy report.

1440
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,430
It says nothing about metoprolol.

1441
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:07,870
So then I went back to the original
path lab notes of the blood test,

1442
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,990
and there it was.

1443
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,500
Metoprolol.

1444
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,240
I'm going inside.

1445
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,030
Why wouldn't the autopsy report
match with the notes, Marlo?

1446
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,710
Marlo?

1447
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,550
Marlo.

1448
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,270
Did you change that autopsy report?

1449
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,670
I had to protect myself.

1450
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:36,190
(SCOFFS)

1451
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,310
Protect yourself? Really?

1452
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,390
By making it look like he died from a sting

1453
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,030
and not a drug you administered?

1454
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,510
I know.

1455
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,310
- I know. It was wrong of me.
- You got to tell someone.

1456
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,390
- I am. I'm telling you.
- The dean, Marlo.

1457
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,510
You have to tell the dean
you changed that report.

1458
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,630
Why?

1459
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,750
- What good is that gonna do now?
- Really?

1460
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,230
You don't see it?

1461
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,910
It's your flatline, Cyrus Gudgeon.

1462
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:03,510
You know, it was so nice being with you

1463
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:07,750
and realizing, after all this time,
that you actually like me.

1464
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,750
And now you have to go and spoil it.

1465
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,440
- I am here because I like you.
- Yeah, well, it's easy for you.

1466
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,710
You don't have to sacrifice anything.

1467
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,070
I'm becoming a doctor
with a degree from a top medical school.

1468
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,590
I've worked my whole life for this.

1469
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,150
And now, I... I made one mistake.
I mean, admitting it

1470
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,830
is not gonna bring the guy back.

1471
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,350
All it's gonna do is end my career.

1472
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,030
That is the point here,

1473
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,910

1474
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:44,190
If you were willing to change
an autopsy report, then...

1475
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,630
Say it.

1476
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,030
Then maybe you shouldn't be a doctor.

1477

I was the one who sent your pictures
to the whole class.
