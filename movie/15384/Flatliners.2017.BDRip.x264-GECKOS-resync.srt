00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,751
Courtney!

3
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,071
<i>I had this sensation
of someone taking my hand, guiding me...</i>

4
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,591
<i>I looked up
and I saw this light.</i>

5
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,631
<i>The giant wall of light. Brighter...</i>

6
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,311
<i>All of a sudden,
I was in a different place.</i>

7
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,471
<i>Pure energy.</i>

8
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,800
<i>I fail to find words
that can describe what I experienced.</i>

9
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,960
<i>At that point,
I had that out-of-body experience.</i>

10
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,033
<i>I remember a feeling
of being sucked backwards,</i>

11
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,914
<i>like being pulled through water.</i>

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,912
<i>I wasn't having thoughts of my own.</i>

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,960
<i>Answers, uh, messages coming through me.</i>

14
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,556
<i>Colors were so vivid.
Colors I've never seen before.</i>

15
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,758
<i>Then I was pushed
right back into my body.</i>

16
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,879
<i>I could actually
see my body from above,</i>

17
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,872
<i>like it was lifeless.</i>

18
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,996
<i>And I was floating up...</i>

19
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,436
<i>Everything
I thought was important was</i>

20
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,070
<i>dwarfed by this sense of love.</i>

21
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,674
<i>And I could feel this pull,</i>

22
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,834
<i>a force trying to drag me down
this black tunnel.</i>

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,996
<i>Where is it taking me?</i>

24
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,114
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,839
<i>I think I'm going crazy.</i>

26
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,434
<i>I'm seeing things.</i>

27
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,240
<i>Something I did.</i>

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,352
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

29
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,999
Hello, Lauren.

30
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,879
How are you feeling?

31
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,913
You had a seizure tonight.

32
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,034
You're at Trinity Emmanuel Medical Center.

33
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,593
Lauren,

34
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,672
do you know that your heart stopped?

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
You were gone for several minutes,

36
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,872
but the trauma team brought you back.

37
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,631
Do you remember any of that?

38
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,958
If you felt anything, if you saw anything?

39
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,997
Did you lose someone, sweetheart?

40
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,880
She's in here.

41
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,274
We're taking you to Imaging.
You'll be okay.

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,719
One for transfer in five.

43
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,433
Ready? One, two, three.

44
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,635
Transfer from Holy Cross.

45
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,951
38-year-old construction
worker, fell off a beam.

46
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,952
Persistent coma. GCS 6.

47
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,680
- I'll page the resident.
- Mmm-hmm.

48
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,080
Already done. I got this.

49
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,696
Which one of you is in charge here?

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,836
It's my intake.

51
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,952
Actually, I'm the one on duty.

52
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,397
I got it. I got it. Thank you.

53
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,272
Standard procedure for a GCS 6 admit

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,114
calls for two large-bore IVs
and diazepam on standby.

55
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,440
Seizure meds won't do any good.

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,040
Whatever is wrong is
in his spinal column, not his brain.

57
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,032
And what medical protocol are you citing?

58
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,755
The protocol of actually living
in the real world,

59
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,151
where guys with crappy HMOs
go undiagnosed for spinal injuries.

60
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,834
Actually, he's on seizure meds,

61
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,719
which is the medical protocol
of reading his chart.

62
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,440
Oh, shit. No, no, no.

63
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,075
- Shit.
- Uh, uh...

64
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,230
What is it?

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,880
Respiratory failure.

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
He might be hemorrhaging.

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,754
Page Neurosurgery, call a code,
and get CT on standby.

68
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,876
Students, clear the room.

69
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,993
Hey. What is it? What's wrong?

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,878
Did you know that there's
12 pairs of nerves

71
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,792
just within the cranial area?

72
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,395
The, um... The oculomotor,

73
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,120
the trochlear, the glossopharyngeal, and...

74
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,915
Nine others whose names I cannot remember.

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,356
I cannot absorb any more terminology.

76
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,998
I have, like...
A rash on my arm. I can't sleep.

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,954
You know, my mother invested

78
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,999
her entire life savings into my education.

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,594
Come on.

80
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,831
Come on, that's enough suffering
for one night.

81
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,551
Let's get out of here. Yeah?

82
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,749
It's cold.

83
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,230
We used to be friends, right?

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,256
- What is...
- Like, our first year,

85
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,800
when we would sit together at lecture.

86
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,990
- Remember?
- Mmm.

87
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,840
And we'd, like, go running and get coffee.

88
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,639
Hang out. Do stuff.

89
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,154
We're still friends, though.

90
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,357
No, we don't talk.

91
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,274
We just work and... And compete.

92
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,159
Who's the fastest to make
a diagnosis of Bell's palsy?

93
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,800
Quick, what's the seven
side effects of Ativan?

94
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,909
You know, just last week,
a second-year committed suicide.

95
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,476
God, Court, you're gonna be
such a good doctor.

96
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,916
Medicine just, like, comes easy to you.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,834
You know, I think there's a way that
we could spend more time together.

98
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,616
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'm just wondering

99
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,406
if you'd help me on
this little, like,

100
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,516
extracurricular project
I've been working on.

101
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,116
Uh... We just...

102
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,271
We have neuro shelf exams
in, like, 10 days.

103
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,511
I don't really feel like I'm gonna make it.

104
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,471
Oh, Once One Takes The Anatomy Final,
Very Good Vacations Are Heavenly.

105
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,237
- What? Oh.
- It's a mnemonic phrase.

106
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,391
You use it to remember
the 12 cranial nerves.

107
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,392
- Yeah.
- Ah. Thank you.

108
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,233
You're welcome.

109
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,874
But, yeah, I'm...
I really would love your help.

110
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,354
Maybe.

111
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,310
Hey.

112
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,438
What's in those?

113
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,240
First one's Mountain Dew
laced with Adderall.

114
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,993
Other's a chaser of espressos.

115
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,635
- Together, it's a liquid heart attack.
- Hey, Jamie.

116
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,194
Oh, Jesus.

117
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,559
Hey.

118
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,393
"Hey, Jamie." Where were you last night?

119
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,077
Your eyes are still dilated.

120
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,517
25-year-old female,
admitted last night.

121
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,513
Complaining of numbness on left side,
nausea, vomiting.

122
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,310
Anything of note from the physical exam?

123
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,150
Sees the color red differently between
left and right eye, and oral ulcers.

124
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,034
Sophia, what test should we run?

125
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,235
A lumbar puncture, then MRI of the brain.

126
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,512
Fine, but reverse the order.
Images first, then procedure.

127
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,069
Preliminary diagnosis, Brad.

128
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,640
- Pituitary cyst?
- No.

129
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Jamie.

130
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,670
Uh...

131
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Jackie.

132
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,073
- Um, stroke?
- My God.

133
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,120
You need to do better than this.

134
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
All of you.

135
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,990
What do you think the largest
age demographic is in our society today?

136
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,876
You.

137
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,679
Young adults in their 20s, which means

138
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,031
that there are at least
1,000 people waiting

139
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,759
to take your spot.

140
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,360
And we are not in the business of
training country club doctors,

141
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,199
nor do we waste our time
on students who think

142
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,432
that they can skate by
doing the least work necessary.

143
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,673
We are here to educate students
who push themselves,

144
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,355
those who are capable
of making new discoveries

145
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,751
and actually move the dial
on human knowledge.

146
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,036
And for those of you who think
that's too much,

147
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,038
then you should leave.

148
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,629
And by that, I mean now.

149
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,959
Marlo, if I were to tell you

150
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,475
that the patient's family
background was Mediterranean,

151
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,951
i.e., Greek or Turkish,
what would the diagnosis be?

152
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,112
I don't think you'll find it
in your notebook.

153
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,595
It's Behcet's disease.

154
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,359
Thank you, Ray.

155
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,114
Moving on.

156
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,357
Why are you working this event?

157
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,797
You're a trust-fund kid.
You sleep on a sailboat.

158
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,957
Yeah, but there's this really hot caterer

159
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,520
- I've been trying to meet.
- Ah.

160
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,594
Look at all these stodgy
old docs with their white wine

161
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,473
and their golf games.

162
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,474
I don't think it's such a bad life.

163
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,216
I don't know about you,

164
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,359
but I'm certainly not gonna spend
the next 40 years doing prostate exams.

165
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,278
No one pays their dues anymore.

166
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,272
Our generation,
it's all about entrepreneurship.

167
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,959
Yeah, so what are you gonna do?

168
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,879
I'm going to LA.

169
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,076
Look at this face.

170
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,356
I'm gonna be the Anderson Cooper
of celebrity medicine.

171
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,319
Okay.

172
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,480
"Oh, hi, Mom. It's my afternoon check-in."

173
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,835
That's funny. Cool. Okay.

174
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,040
You know there's nothing
I can do about her right now.

175
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,233
Did she really move here
just to keep tabs on you?

176
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,595
Mmm-hmm.

177
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,909
Hey, come on, look.

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,356
- My station is full.
- Okay.

179
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,635
You're so behind.

180
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,476
Okay, sir, got to give
you a testicular exam.

181
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,319
- Should just take a minute.
- What? No.

182
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,480
- Excuse the reach.
- Wait a... Wait a minute!

183
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I don't enjoy it either.

184
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,798
Just close your eyes and pretend
I'm the candy-stripe girl.

185
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,360
What? Get... Get the hell off of me!

186
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Hold on.

187
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,400
- Candy-stripe girl.
- Whoa, whoa! Get...

188
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,432
- No, wait a minute.
- Stop! What are you doing?

189
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,273
He doesn't need a testicular exam.

190
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,350
He doesn't?

191
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,991
Come near me again, I'm killing you.

192
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,993
You know, I think I got mixed up.

193
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,031
It says here the resident wanted a neural
test for that guy, not a testicular exam.

194
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,431
I can't imagine how I passed
the wrong information to you.

195
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,319
Very funny.

196
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,280
Ray can be a real dick sometimes.
You guys notice that?

197
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,680
I think he's intriguing.

198
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,436
Let's go, people. No lunch break today.

199
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,399
Every bed in the unit is full,
and we got referrals waiting in the ER.

200
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,199
Get moving on afternoon rounds.

201
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,476
Excuse me.

202
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,073
Do you have plans tonight?

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,276
First-years are having a wingding.

204
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,876
Dorm punch and a deejay,
but I'm not above it.

205
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,952
I can't wait for the anesthesia rotation.

206
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,316
Those guys have access to the best drugs.

207
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,110
Looking for this?

208
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,035
Hell yeah.

209
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,312
I found it on my nightstand.

210
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,000
See you later.

211
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,914
These second-years have no tact,

212
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,879
coming up to me like that
in front of my colleague.

213
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,553
Yeah, we're colleagues, aren't we?

214
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,879
I mean, we have fun together.

215
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,636
Yeah, kinda.

216
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,317
Do you want to have fun with me later?

217
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,159
Courtney Holmes, I am mildly surprised

218
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,391
to be having this conversation with you.

219
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,999
But offer accepted.

220
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,437
Midnight, basement, sub level C.

221
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,354
You want
to meet me in the basement?

222
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,917
Sublevel C, underneath the old building.

223
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,912
And take the service elevator,

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,276
'cause it doesn't have
surveillance cameras.

225
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,791
Yeah. Good idea.

226
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,189
No.

227
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,870
Jesus!

228
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,519
You're late.

229
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,274
What are we doing down here?

230
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,432
Come on, we don't have much time.

231
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,599
Okay, Courtney, what's going on?

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,356
It's past midnight. I should be studying.

233
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,513
We're almost there, okay?

234
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,119
What is all of this?

235
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,080
They put this in five years ago.

236
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,635
In case of a natural
disaster, loss of power.

237
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,953
It's a fully functioning hospital,
and it never gets used.

238
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,600
Whoa.

239
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,639
Um, Court, what exactly are you up to?

240
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,240
- Um...
- Wow.

241
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,590
Two of you.

242
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,920
Jamie, what are you doing here?

243
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,390
Uh, she didn't tell me
about you either, okay?

244
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,631
But, I'm open to a three-way.

245
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,790
Ew. Shut up.

246
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,200
What?

247
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,559
Oh, I like it!

248
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,314
Scanners, cameras, our choice of beds.

249
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,234
- We can be as loud as we want.
- Courtney, what's going on?

250
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,472
I asked for his help, too.
He probably misinterpreted.

251
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,472
Oh. Oh, you mean we're not getting it on?

252
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,074
Wait, what are you talking about?

253
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,198
I've been searching
for the region of the brain

254
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,749
that is responsible
for near-death experiences.

255
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,154
And these are postmortem scans

256
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,471
of patients that have
died in this hospital.

257
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,678
Is there any
circumstance under which

258
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,240
- you'd have sex with me?
- God, stop.

259
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,194
Look, if the brain is just another organ,

260
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,755
why doesn't it just go dark
and... And shut off

261
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,990
at the moment of death?

262
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,840
You know, why the floating?

263
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,990
Why the white light?

264
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,440
Why the sense of well-being?

265
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,918
I mean, what is that experience?

266
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,711
Is it chemical, or is it something else?

267
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,237
Can we map that process
the way we map a seizure?

268
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,960
What if we could actually document
what happens to us after we die?

269
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,755
What do you mean?

270
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,793
Nothing happens. We're dead.

271
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,839
What if we could prove otherwise?

272
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,633
Can you imagine
the residency offers you would get?

273
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,434
And forget about Dr. Oz.

274
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,070
I mean, you would be the world's
first specialist in the afterlife.

275
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,076
Okay, you got my attention.

276
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,277
Oh, come on. This isn't science.

277
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,896
This is pseudoscience.

278
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,480
Well, maybe. Maybe not.

279
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,871
But the only way to find out
is to see for ourselves.

280
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,437
So I would like you both to stop my heart.

281
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,839
Look, I'll be in the imaging scanner.

282
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,231
It will take real-time pictures
of my brain's hemodynamic activity.

283
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,496
- Um...
- You give it one minute,

284
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,795
and then you bring me back.

285
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,950
Wait, you're serious?

286
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,074
- Stop your heart?
- This is propofol.

287
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,913
Fifty milligrams will knock me out.

288
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,456
I'll be wrapped in a cooling blanket,

289
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,234
bringing my core body temperature
down to 86 degrees.

290
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,912
And once that happens, you administer
a defibrillator shock to stop my heart.

291
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,550
Wait a sec.

292
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,072
Look, I've signed a release.
It's in my bag.

293
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,669
It absolves you both of any responsibility.

294
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,475
Courtney, think about what
you're saying right now.

295
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,240
Hey. Look, if she's insane enough to
try it, who are we to stop her?

296
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,232
- Um...
- Look, I'm young, okay?

297
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,800
I'm in excellent health.

298
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,880
You're both trained in emergency medicine.

299
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,336
So reviving me should be.

300
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,079
Very straightforward.

301
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,757
Look, it's 12:18 now.

302
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,514
I've checked the schedules
for security down here

303
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,109
and cleaning crews.

304
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,716
We have about 45 minutes,
so we should probably get going.

305
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,992
What? This is crazy.
No, count me out of this.

306
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,390
I am not helping you kill yourself.

307
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,839
Well, then you can stand by the door
and make sure nobody comes in.

308
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,976
Okay, remember,
there's a magnet in the scanner,

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,798
so no keys or metal in the room.

310
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,678
Look, we've got it.

311
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,831
Wait, Jamie,
what if you can't bring her back?

312
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,391
Then we burn her body, work out our alibi,

313
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,994
and pretend like nothing happened.

314
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,616
And make sure that the scanner's recording,

315
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,439
because if not,
then this whole exercise is pointless.

316
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,800
We're good to go.

317
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,270
Repeat back to me
the resuscitation procedure.

318
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,240
Uh, as soon as you're dead,
I'll run the scanner.

319
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,391
At 60 seconds, I'll start pulling you out

320
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,392
by switching to the heating blanket.

321
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,917
When your core temp's back up
to 93 degrees, I'll start CPR.

322
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,595
Crash cart is standing by
with the epi and the defib.

323
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,832
Wai... Hello? Brain damage.
You'll get brain damage.

324
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,354
Not if you resuscitate me in time.

325
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,712
Brain cells can survive without oxygen
for at least four minutes.

326
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,359
Okay.

327
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,716
Now is the point
where you say it's all a joke.

328
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,757
Okay, put the blanket on me.

329
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,394
Jamie, look at her. Come
on, she's terrified.

330
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,591
It's just my body's
natural survival instincts.

331
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,360
I anticipated this.
I'm trying to block it out.

332
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,551
Okay.

333
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,519
And now I kill you.

334
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,115
Come on, you'll both get expelled.
You'll go to prison.

335
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,714
Only if you blab about it.

336
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,553
Okay. We're really doing this.

337
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,835
Uh...

338
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,199
Uh, see you later.

339
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,793
She's out.

340
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,872
Uh, body temp's dropping.

341
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,160
Okay, look, Jamie,
we can stop right here, okay?

342
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,640
She sleeps it off, wakes up, and we just
pretend that we followed through with it.

343
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,397
If you can't handle this, then look away.

344
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,072
Fine. Yeah, Jamie, I'll just leave!

345
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,636
- Charging 200.
- Come on! This is wrong!

346
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,336
- Weren't you leaving?
- You're murdering somebody!

347
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,034
Yeah, I probably should've
stayed in tonight.

348
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,149
Clear!

349
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,079
Oh, my God.

350
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,676
- She's... She's...
- Dead.

351
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,154
I think.

352
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,031
Counting off 60 seconds.

353
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,358
Do you see any brain activity?

354
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,669
Um...

355
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,496
I mean, something's going on,
I'm not really sure what.

356
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,159
It's recording, isn't it?

357
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,475
Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,872
<i>- Fifty-one, 52...
- Fifty-three...</i>

359
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,951
<i>Fifty-four, 55, 56, 57,</i>

360
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,432
fifty-eight, 59,

361
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,193
- sixty seconds.
- Get her out.

362
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,752
Okay. Okay. Okay.

363
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,916
Blanket's warming.

364
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,376
- What's her temp need to get to again?
- Doesn't matter. Hurry up.

365
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,039
Calm down.

366
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,000
- Charge 200.
- Wait!

367
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,918
Clear!

368
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,754
It's... It's not working.

369
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,035
Of course it isn't.

370
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,873
Paddles are useless without a heart rhythm.

371
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,996
Didn't you listen to her?

372
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,656
Yeah, I was gonna write
down all the steps...

373
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,034
Move! Just move.

374
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,913
Move!

375
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,195
Did we order an MRI on... Hey.

376
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,954
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I...

377
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,793
No, she needs an epi.

378
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,990
Huh?

379
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,276
IV, you moron. God, it's already set up.

380
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,416
Just push the drug into the goddamn line!

381
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,840
Calm down! I got this.

382
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,672
God.

383
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,554
It's not working. Try something else!

384
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,080
There is nothing else.

385
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,714
Well, I...

386
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,350
What the fuck?

387
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,536
It was an experiment.

388
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,296
She had us stop her heart,
and we can't get her back.

389
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,456
- How long has she been out?
- I don't know, a couple of minutes.

390
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,720
Look, I say we try the paddles.

391
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,792
No, no! Wait! Put them down.

392
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,913
I... Stop, stop.

393
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,231
Take over for Sophia
on the chest compressions.

394
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,915
Do them much harder,
get on top of her if it helps.

395
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,392
Sophia, put that cooling blanket on.
She's too warm.

396
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,713
Then charge the defib
all the way to 360 and stand by.

397
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,536
As soon as Jamie and I get you a heartbeat,

398
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,552
however fluttering,
you put those paddles on her

399
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,074
and give her full power.

400
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,799
The blanket. Come on.

401
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,440
Got to push a lot more epi
than what you've been doing.

402
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,758
Don't stop. Don't stop. Keep going.

403
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,950
All right.

404
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,560
Come on, Courtney.

405
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,915
She's hypoxic.

406
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,434
We need to intubate.

407
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,039
All right? Go!

408
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,155
Let's get it off.

409
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,550
Help me.

410
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,400
All right.

411
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,519
Go, go, go, go.

412
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,594
Clear!

413
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,999
Courtney, can you hear me?

414
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,834
You're crazy, you know that?

415
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,516
- You called Ray?
- Were you getting it done?

416
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,400
Does somebody want to fill me in here?

417
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,480
Mmm, it happened very gently.

418
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,636
Like, almost like an untethering.

419
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,389
And... And I... I floated to the ceiling.

420
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,912
I could see my body.
I could see Sophia and Jamie.

421
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,875
And then I could see
the roof of the hospital.

422
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,999
And I've never been up there.

423
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,197
How do you explain that?

424
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,636
I can't explain it.

425
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,039
Are you mad at us?

426
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,512
I don't know what to think

427
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,435
other than you're all pretty stupid.

428
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,512
She's lucky to be alive.

429
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,839
She's alive because of you.

430
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,712
What else happened?

431
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,593
Did you... Did you see a white light?

432
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,189
I wouldn't call it that. It was...

433
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,153
It was more like...

434
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,037
Pure energy.

435
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,070
And honestly,
it was kind of sexual, actually.

436
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,916
It was kind of sexual.

437
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
Guys, playback's ready.

438
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,029
Hey. Check this out.

439
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,080
Okay, look. We're counting up
from zero at the moment of death.

440
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,674
Cognitive activity has ceased.

441
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,237
Your heart stopped. No breathing, no pulse.

442
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,317
We're 15 seconds in, and there.

443
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,040
Look at that.

444
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,591
Like a bolt of lightning
in your prefrontal cortex.

445
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,680
We might just be witnessing
the afterlife, people.

446
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,029
Okay.

447
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,873
Who knows what we're looking at?

448
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,235
We're not radiologists.

449
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,040
I mean, it could just be
residual electricity.

450
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,416
- You know, synapses shutting down.
- Okay, we're moving on.

451
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,319
So, you've been dead almost 40 seconds now,

452
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,790
and look.

453
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,750
This area lights up, the hippocampus.

454
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,309
- That's not the hippocampus.
- Uh, of course it is.

455
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,275
That is the ventral tegmental area.

456
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,075
It's the oldest part of the brain,
governs thirst, hunger, love.

457
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,551
Okay, doctors, I'm glad you're having fun.

458
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,000
Got to get out of here.

459
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,150
Hey, Ray, come on.

460
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,594
Hey, no. Just let him go.

461
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,750
<i>Adiós, adiós.</i>

462
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,629
It's over. Her brain's just dark now.

463
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,273
- No.
- Ah-ah. Look at that.

464
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,153
Wait. Amygdala.

465
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,155
Um, that's the amygdala. Rage.

466
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,033
Stress. Emotional memory.

467
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,834
Whatever you were seeing,

468
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,196
this is just before we pulled you out.

469
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,195
Is she okay?

470
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,237
She's been sitting there
for, like, 10 minutes.

471
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,039
- Really?
- Yeah.

472
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,876
What do you think
she's doing out there?

473
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,675
I hope she doesn't try to fly.

474
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,077
If there were brain chemicals released,

475
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,636
the aftereffects could still be
in her bloodstream.

476
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,152
I took LSD once.

477
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,638
I stayed awake for three days.

478
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,474
Oh, shit.

479
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,874
I'm gonna go check on her.

480
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,560
Let's leave.

481
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,710
Ooh. Whoa.

482
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,113
That's high.

483
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,869
Hey.

484
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,273
Are you okay?

485
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,438
I'm gonna bake some bread.

486
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,520
What's with the bread?

487
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,118
Courtney baked it. Six loaves, last night.

488
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,273
She remembered her grandmother's recipe.

489
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,552
Also, she ran 12 miles.

490
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,958
- Twelve miles?
- Let's begin.

491
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,496
We've been ramping up Michael Evergreen
with meds for ten hours,

492
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,352
and his epilepsy hasn't gotten any better.

493
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,794
Now he's developed a skin rash.

494
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,111
It's a mystery. The meds should be working.

495
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,876
Carbamazepine?

496
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
What?

497
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,034
Carbamazepine has an 11% chance
of reacting negatively

498
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,696
with lamotrigine, which is the other drug

499
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,598
- that Michael's on.
- Seriously?

500
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,280
Good catch, Courtney.

501
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,034
Sophia, next case.

502
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,439
Um... Adele Gunther. 44 years old.
Admitted with mild confusion.

503
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,640
Says her sister's an impostor,
she doesn't recognize her.

504
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,031
No history of trauma.
Too young for dementia.

505
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,536
We're gonna send it out
to Psychiatry for...

506
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,596
It's Capgras syndrome.

507
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,075
- Huh?
- Hmm?

508
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,750
- Go on.
- Capgras is an impairment

509
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,877
of the brain's facial recognition center.

510
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,799
And a very rare diagnosis.

511
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,995
V.S. Ramachandran, in his book,
<i>Phantoms of the Brain,</i>

512
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,950
links frontal cortex dichotomies,
like this, to Capgras.

513
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,474
That's not on this year's syllabus.

514
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,918
Optional reading in my first year.

515
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,358
Hmm. Well, that's more like it.

516
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,678
My sister loved this piece.

517
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,914
Drug warnings for carbamazepine
run 20 pages long.

518
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,310
How could she possibly
recall a detail like that?

519
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,313
How is she playing the piano again,
after 12 years?

520
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,473
She's not playing that well.

521
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,392
It's like her brain's been rewired,

522
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,075
accessing everything she's ever learned.

523
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,272
I don't care what happened to her.

524
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,670
This experiment needs to end right now.

525
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,151
I'm not gonna risk everything
for a morbid fascination you guys have.

526
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,199
You think you're all medical pioneers?

527
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,398
You're just a bunch of
rich kids screwing around,

528
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,711
before you become wealthy specialists

529
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,680
with your Ivy League bumper stickers
on your Mercedes.

530
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,514
I was with you until the end.

531
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,320
No one puts bumper stickers on a Mercedes.

532
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,590
I think we're way past parlor tricks here.

533
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,792
Uh, that does it. I'm going next.

534
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,759
- Okay.
- Tonight. I am.

535
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,513
And you're all gonna be there.

536
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,712
It's a good day to die.

537
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,512
No! No!

538
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,190
Jesus Christ.

539
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,234
Whoo!

540
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,600
Is that what I looked like?

541
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,512
Yep. Exactly like that.

542
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,991
- I knew you'd show up.
- How long has he been under?

543
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,197
Uh, 45 seconds.

544
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,318
I thought you'd had it
with all this foolishness.

545
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,200
Jamie asked me to be here.

546
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,233
He wanted me to pull him out.

547
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,056
- Pause compressions.
- One, two, three...

548
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,878
- Still no heartbeat.
- Pushing epi.

549
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,520
- Come on, Jamie, wake up.
- He can't hear you.

550
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,794
Sophia, get ready to intubate.

551
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,997
Oh, okay. Um, I've never done this before,

552
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,496
- so just give me a second...
- Just do it!

553
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,477
Ray, relax. There's no need to panic.

554
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,639
Let's give the epi a second to work.

555
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,159
<i>Jamie...</i>

556
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,953
Clear!

557
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,110
Take it out, take it out.

558
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,712
Hey...

559
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,274
Jesus, Jamie, Jamie.

560
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,032
Whoo! I need a drink.

561
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,316
Shots, shots, shots!

562
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,553
Yeah, come on!

563
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
Cheers!

564
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,120
<i>Salud!</i>

565
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,790
What do you guys think about
taking this wall down?

566
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,349
- No, no, no.
- I've always wanted a loft.

567
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,158
Oh! It's hailing! Courtney!

568
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,515
What?

569
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,996
- Oh! Oh!
- Watch it!

570
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,076
- Oh!
- This is crazy.

571
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,152
It's like they're on the same wavelength.

572
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,432
We should bottle flatlining,
sell it as a club drug.

573
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,557
Here. Use this.

574
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,070
Hey, no, no!

575
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,477
Oh, my God.

576
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,600
This has been the strangest
night of my life.

577
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,160
You going next, Ray?

578
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,312
- What, flatlining? No way.
- Uh-huh.

579
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,354
I'd bring you back out.

580
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,274
Maybe.

581
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,200
You have to admit, I was pretty good
with that defibrillator.

582
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,835
You were okay.

583
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,232
Would it kill you to admit that
I might be just as good a doctor as you?

584
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,675
I never said you were not.

585
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,752
Hey, Marlo, your brother's here.

586
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,751
You have no more experience
than the rest of us.

587
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,360
I do.

588
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,352
I was a firefighter in Houston.

589
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,999
Almost six years.

590
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,478
I'm going next.

591
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,072
<i>It... It was super fun.</i>

592
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,080
I was all-powerful.
I had the whole city to myself.

593
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,318
It's weird, isn't it?

594
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,792
I thought there'd be more people, like...

595
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,118
Aren't you supposed to see...

596
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,998
family members who've died, or...

597
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,194
Maybe there's no one there
because it wasn't really our time.

598
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,959
Was it all fun?

599
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,916
What do you mean?

600
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,074
I don't... I mean, like...
Was there anything disturbing or...

601
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,312
Not really.

602
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,514
Why?

603
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,276
Nothing.

604
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,273
She's stabilizing.

605
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,056
I don't understand.
The data shows her starting

606
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,276
into a massive seizure,
and then it just went away.

607
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,473
I gave her Ativan.

608
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,513
On whose authority?

609
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,509
I'm sorry. I'll get approval next time.

610
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,914
You saved her life.

611
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,874
Yes, I did.

612
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,315
I'm Jesus.

613
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,435
Everyone I touch today, I'm gonna heal.

614
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,349
You know, it's funny, because
you and Courtney both flat...

615
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,320
You both flatlined,

616
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,875
yet Courtney has focused on the past.

617
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,999
Memories, recipes.

618
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,632
Whereas you, you're... You're focused
on the present, using your intuition.

619
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,877
What does that have in
common with Courtney?

620
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,000
Sophia, Marlo,
you're needed in the ICU.

621
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,553
It's an awakening.

622
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,600
See you later, Jesus.

623
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,996
- An awakening?
- Yeah.

624
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,000
You here for the abortion?

625
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
Huh?

626
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,192
Should Ernesto La Paz get morphine?

627
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,239
Uh...

628
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,314
Oh. Uh, I'll, uh...
I'll check with the resident.

629
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
- Sophia?
- Hmm?

630
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,674
Where are you going?

631
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,876
It's 11:30 at night.

632
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,096
You're not on call,
and you don't have anything scheduled.

633
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,759
No, I'm... I'm going to the library.

634
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,136
I'm just gonna do some more studying.

635
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
No, no, no, no.

636
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,471
I'm making tea and we're gonna
start reviewing

637
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,400
all of the terminology
for the nervous system.

638
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,915
- But I...
- Now.

639
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,675
Okay.

640
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,870
<i>Where's Sophia?</i>

641
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,117
We need to start. It's already 12:15.

642
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,839
This isn't gonna hurt, is it?

643
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,800
The anesthesia
will take care of that.

644
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,636
Three minutes.

645
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,200
Well, Jamie only did two.

646
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,280
What can I say?

647
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,480
I'm competitive.

648
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,600
After my three minutes are done,

649
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,195
these are the interventions I want,
in their specific order.

650
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,081
If I don't come out right away,
I want you to intubate me.

651
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,953
Force the oxygen, okay?

652
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,077
Hey, I'm gonna bring you out of it, hmm?

653
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,116
Relax. Enjoy the experience.

654
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,395
Okay, okay.

655
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,520
Infusion's flowing.

656
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,156
She's out. Body temp's 94.

657
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,351
Charging 200.

658
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,276
Clear.

659
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,476
Asystole.

660
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,071
38-year-old male,
stung in the face by a jellyfish.

661
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,680
By a jellyfish.

662
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,873
That's it. Let's get her out.

663
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,720
Epi in.

664
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,233
<i>- Defib!
- Charge to 200.</i>

665
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,596
Clear.

666
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,992
- No pulse.
- Damn it, we just had it.

667
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,156
Juice her again.

668
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,598
I'm gonna push an epi and sodium bicarb.

669
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,839
<i>Defib. She's not stabilizing.</i>

670
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,629
<i>Charge 300.</i>

671
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,110
Clear. Come on.

672
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,716
No pulse.

673
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,077
This is not working. I need to intubate.

674
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,313
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

675
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,720
Calm down. I got this.

676
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,593
<i>360. Clear.</i>

677
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,110
Please.

678
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,589
She's back.

679
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,273
You good? You're all right.

680
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,158
- Yeah.
- There you go.

681
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,797
We're safe. No one ever comes up here.

682
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,272
- It's so beautiful.
- Isn't it?

683
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,909
Her temp's low.

684
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,635
Pulse still racing.

685
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,993
Well, I think three minutes is too long.

686
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,833
Oh, look, she had a bad trip. It happens.

687
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,116
What, you're an expert?

688
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,552
Uh, yeah, more than you.

689
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,952
- Is she okay?
- Where have you been?

690
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,038
- Marlo is fine.
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

691
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,675
I'm going next. Right now.

692
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,760
- Right now?
- Why not?

693
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,520
The cleaning crew is gonna be
down there in like 20 minutes.

694
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,479
- Okay.
- No, we've gone too far.

695
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,796
No more flatlining.

696
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,920
Okay, so you three get to
expand your consciousness

697
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,992
and get academic advantage, but I don't?

698
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,136
Advantage.

699
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,616
You think this makes you better, Sophia?

700
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,710
This makes you dead.

701
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,256
You have much more sense than that.

702
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,751
Ray, if this bothers you so much,
then just walk away.

703
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,880
- Well, maybe I should.
- You're not going anywhere.

704
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,917
You're in this as deep as the rest of us.

705
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,516
Okay, look,
I don't care how dangerous this is.

706
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,160
I need this more than any of you guys.

707
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,073
Ray, it's her decision.

708
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,958
Just like it was each of ours.

709
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,910
If Sophia wants to do this,
then we're doing it tonight.

710
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,794
Just don't stay in too long.

711
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,956
<i>A B-plus on a biology
exam is not acceptable.</i>

712
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,190
<i>Not acceptable.</i>

713
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,670
<i>That will not get you into
a top-10 medical school.</i>

714
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,776
Someone's coming down the elevator.

715
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,920
- What?
- Get her out!

716
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,638
Come on, come on, come on.

717
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,949
Let's go. Let's go!

718
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,440
Pushing an amp of epi.

719
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,869
Where the hell are you going?

720
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,754
Start compressions.

721
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,674
Please, God, bring her back.

722
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,230
Good thinking, Doctor.

723
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,549
I'm sure that's gonna help.

724
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Epi in.

725
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,070
Pause compressions.

726
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,873
Clear.

727
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,360
Irina.

728
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,918
<i>You are not the only
kid that is out there trying to get in.</i>

729
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,636
Shit.

730
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,919
One, two, three.

731
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,912
- V-tach.
- Charging 360.

732
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,470
Clear.

733
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,320
We got her, we got her.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

734
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,154
We're gonna get you out of here.

735
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,640
You're gonna be okay.

736
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,116
- Come on, you'll be okay. Come here.
- Come on.

737
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,873
- Come on!
- I got her, I got her.

738
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,616
- My jacket, my jacket.
- Got it.

739
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,710
Go, go.

740
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,520
Okay. To the right.

741
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,040
It's open. Just get in.

742
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,199
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

743
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,515
Should you really be driving?

744
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,800
- Wait!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

745
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Shit! Oh, shit!

746
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,833
You asshole! You left us.

747
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,953
- Are you okay?
- The hell I did.

748
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,350
- I saved your asses.
- Let's go!

749
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,896
- Here they come!
- Hold it right there!

750
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,070
We got to get out of here!

751
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,040
Hold on!

752
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,634
- Whoa!
- We're going too fast!

753
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,880
Oh, my God.

754
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,270
- Shit!
- Car!

755
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,635
Oh, God!

756
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,675
Oh, watch out!

757
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,070
Oh, my God!

758
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,870
It's not funny.

759
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,476
Whoa!

760
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,510
Here we go.

761
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,960
Whoa!

762
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,269
- Where are we going?
- Oh!

763
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,953
<i>So what, I'm a wild child.</i>

764
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,232
<i>Gunning for love.</i>

765
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,592
<i>It's what makes the world go round.</i>

766
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,080
Hell yeah.

767
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,077
<i>Feel the walls come crashing down.</i>

768
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,480
<i>Ain't no messiah.</i>

769
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,317
<i>Where you at, girl? Where
you, where you at?</i>

770
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,800
<i>Go home or go tough.</i>

771
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,280
<i>Oh</i> -

772
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,996
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.</i>

773
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,952
<i>Bum, bum, Imma bang that drum.</i>

774
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,231
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

775
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,198
<i>I blow up like bubble gum.</i>

776
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,277
<i>Oh.</i>

777
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,591
<i>They keep calling me a wild child.</i>

778
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,479
<i>Oh, they all know that I'm...</i>

779
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,152
<i>When faced with the darkest day.</i>

780
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,158
<i>With an endless night.</i>

781
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,072
<i>When I lay awake.</i>

782
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,839
<i>Only thought of you.</i>

783
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,200
<i>Can pull me through.</i>

784
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,234
<i>All I feel is you.</i>

785
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,516
<i>All I feel is you.</i>

786
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,399
<i>How can it be that.</i>

787
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,433
<i>All I feel is you.</i>

788
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,790
<i>Courtney!</i>

789
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,958
<i>But you've got to show me love.</i>

790
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,479
<i>Give me a reason.</i>

791
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,390
Come.

792
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,150
Look, I don't know if it's the experience
of dying and coming back again,

793
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,709
but I have got a really
intense craving right now.

794
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,713
For what, gelato?

795
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,871
No.

796
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,077
Oh, my God, this is crazy!

797
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,630
Sophia.

798
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,916
Sophia, open this door!

799
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,273
I... I, uh, I think there's
someone at the door.

800
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,279
- Sophia!
- I don't care.

801
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,079
Don't stop.

802
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,038
Sophia, I need you to open this door.

803
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,149
Sophia!

804
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,037
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Manning.

805
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,191
How dare you bring someone
back to my apartment.

806
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,509
I'm moving out.

807
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,600
- What did you say?
- I'm finding my own place.

808
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,240
You will do no such thing.

809
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,152
See, it doesn't matter what you say, Mom.

810
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,838
Whatever threats you make.
I'm 25 years old.

811
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,752
Succeed or fail...

812
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,920
I'm doing it on my own.

813
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,720
Good night.

814
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,392
All right.

815
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,634
Good night.

816
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,069
How are you getting home?

817
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,119
There's a metro stop nearby.

818
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,997
Look, there's something I need to tell you.

819
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,030
It's, um...

820
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,194
It's important.

821
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,240
So, you gonna tell me or what?

822
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,396
I killed someone.

823
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,756
What?

824
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,513
It was two months ago.

825
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,557
It was my ER rotation.

826
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,158
The patient's name was Cyrus Gudgeon.

827
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,197
He was admitted for a jellyfish sting.

828
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,993
Cyrus Gudgeon. Yeah, I remember.
He got stung in the face.

829
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,870
Died of shock, right?

830
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,112
No, he died because of
a mistake that I made.

831
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,717
I gave him epi and Benadryl.

832
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,952
But those two drugs don't cross-react.

833
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,793
He had metoprolol in his system.

834
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,959
He basically suffocated to death.

835
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,678
I... I'd been on duty for, like, 36 hours,

836
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,480
and I must have screwed up
and forgotten to ask him

837
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,597
if he was taking any medications.

838
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,197
He would be alive right now
if it wasn't for my mistake.

839
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,875
Why are you telling me this?

840
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,434
Because I saw him.

841
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,479
Cyrus. I saw him in my flatline.

842
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,473
And it must mean something, right?

843
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,150
Hey, mistakes happen to everybody.

844
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,114
Yeah, but I work so hard every single day.

845
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,472
- I do the right thing.
- I'm sure you do.

846
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,392
- I'm not a bad person.
- No, you're not.

847
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,880
I'm not a bad person. I...

848
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,236
- Everything's gonna be fine, Marlo.
- No, I'm scared.

849
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,959
I'm scared.

850
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,040
Wait, wait, wait.

851
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,357
You... You can't just...

852
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,999
I'm sor... I'm sorry.

853
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,256
Yeah, what am I doing with you?

854
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,840
- I got to go right now. I'm sorry. No...
- No. No, no, no, wait.

855
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,717
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

856
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,896
- Damn, you have so many.
- Just...

857
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,149
Okay, okay.

858
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,436
I got it, I got it.

859
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,393
Courtney!

860
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,272
Help!

861
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,879
Help! Tessa!

862
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,560
Tessa!

863
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,919
Help!

864
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,036
My sister!

865
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,674
Help!

866
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,840
My sister!

867
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,760
- My sister.
- Come on.

868
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,240
No! My sister!

869
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,438
Oh, Tessa! My... Oh. Tessa!

870
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,954
No!

871
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,874
I hope this doesn't become awkward.

872
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,355
Too late.

873
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,194
I can't imagine what you must think of me.

874
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,990
Why?

875
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,791
Well, first I tell you that I'm responsible

876
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,599
for the death of a patient,

877
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,673
and then I go and totally attack you.

878
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,594
I mean, seriously, what...

879
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,553
What do you see in me?

880
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,833
You're really hot.

881
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,874
Shut up.

882
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,194
- I got to go.
- Oh?

883
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,316
Yeah.

884
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,960
It was four months into our first year.

886
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,111
You were assisting at the oncology ward.

887
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,399
A breast cancer patient was there
for her first round of chemo.

888
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,679
She was anxious and scared,
but you sat down and calmed her

889
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,753
by asking about her kids, her job.

890
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,672
You were so kind.

891
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,320
You didn't think anyone was watching,

892
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,155
but I was watching you through the door.

893
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,914
Three hours later, I stopped by,

894
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,476
and you were there checking on her again.

895
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,240
That's what I see in you.

896
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,073
<i>Jamie?</i>

897
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,153
Courtney? What's going on?

898
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,833
I saw my sister.

899
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,360
Wh... What?

900
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,113
At the waterfront.

901
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,394
It was her.

902
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,997
I saw my dead sister.

903
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,799
Where... Where are you?

904
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,917
I'm home.

905
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,673
<i>I don't understand what's happening.</i>

906
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,114
Stay there.

907
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,600
I'm coming over.

908
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,516
<i>I just... I miss my sister.</i>

909
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,154
I should have told you all that

910
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,870
this wasn't about

911
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,680
science or discovery.

912
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,280
I think I'm going crazy.

913
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,793
Like I'm seeing things.

914
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,033
Something I did.

915
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,074
It was my fault.

916
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,433
I'm sorry.

917
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,920
<i>If you're happy.</i>

918
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,753
<i>And you know it, clap your hands.</i>

919
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,960
<i>If you're happy.</i>

920
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,236
<i>And you know it, clap your hands.</i>

921
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,199
If you're happy and you know it.

922
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,232
<i>If you're happy and you know it.</i>

923
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,436
<i>Clap your hands.</i>

924
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,800
<i>If you're happy.</i>

925
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,559
<i>And you know it, tap your toe</i>

926
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,877
Tessa?

927
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,633
<i>If you're happy and you know it.</i>

928
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,349
<i>If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it</i>

929
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,079
Tessa, is that really you?

930
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,720
<i>If you're happy and you
know it, tap your toe.</i>

931
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:11,920
<i>If you're happy.</i>

932
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,037
<i>And you know it, clap your hands.</i>

933
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,560
<i>If you're happy.</i>

934
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,360
Tessa, are you okay?

935
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,834
Tessa, are you okay?

936
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,957
<i>If you're happy and you know it.</i>

937
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,396
<i>Then your face will surely show it.</i>

938
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,597
<i>If you're happy and you know it.</i>

939
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,796
<i>Clap your hands.</i>

940
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:46,630
<i>- What are you?
- Courtney!</i>

941
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,871
<i>Courtney.</i>

942
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,456
Let's go!

943
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,960
Let's go!

944
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,276
Hi. An update on room four.

945
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,592
We've given the Lasix bolus,
and the output is limited.

946
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,512
Mmm-hmm.

947
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,759
It's been less than 50 cc's
in the last two hours.

948
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:05,875
All right.

949
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,632
They found her at
the bottom of a fire escape.

950
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,359
We'll know more after the autopsy,

951
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,397
but right now, it's
unclear whether she fell,

952
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:22,154
jumped, or God knows what.

953
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,870
I know you all liked her.

954
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,634
And I'm sorry, but for now, I need you

955
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,275
to pick up her patient load
and divide it amongst yourselves.

956
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,919
We still have a hospital to run.

957
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,958
Do any of you know what might
have been going on with her?

958
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,636
Is there something you're not telling me?

959
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,200
All right.

960
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:05,920
It just doesn't feel real.

961
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,320
I know.

962
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,717
You know,
I can't believe she's gone.

963
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,312
We need to talk.

964
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,952
Okay, something is happening to us,
and my mind is playing tricks on me.

965
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,816
This morning,
when I was swimming in the pool...

966
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,877
I can't talk, okay?

967
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,031
- I have rounds right now.
- Guys,

968
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,954
Wolfson already knows
we're holding something back.

969
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,396
The school is going to
investigate her death.

970
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,472
I don't believe it was a suicide.

971
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,597
Maybe she fell.

972
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,478
You were there.

973
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,279
What happened?

974
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,834
Uh, she never answered the door.

975
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,111
I figured... She went to bed.

976
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,429
Hey, killer party, huh?

977
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,237
You all look like shit.

978
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,720
Hey, listen,

979
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,680
if the school finds out
we have been flatlining,

980
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,155
we will be expelled.

981
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,755
And you can say goodbye to your future.

982
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,594
Any notes you've taken, destroy them.

983
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,720
I'm gonna get into Courtney's apartment,
get her phone, computer,

984
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,712
anything incriminating.

985
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,757
You know, you were right
this whole time, Ray.

986
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,116
We should've listened to you.

987
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,038
Yeah, that's true.

988
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,514
This isn't on you, man.

989
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,752
You should just walk away.

990
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,991
We'll keep your name out of it.

991
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,710
No.

992
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,800
I'm not going anywhere.

993
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,516
Whatever happens to all
of you happens to me.

994
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,955
- Yes?
<i>- Hey.</i>

995
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,191
Look, bad news.

996
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,953
<i>Ray and I checked her apartment.</i>

997
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,350
We found her computer and some notes,

998
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,113
- but not her phone.
- <i>Campus security</i>

999
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,776
- could have gotten there before you.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1000
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,838
<i>Assuming you're right
and it's not a criminal investigation,</i>

1001
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,520
then all that stuff stays with her body.

1002
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,671
Meaning you can go down there
and look for it.

1003
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,592
Go down where?

1004
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,354
Where do you think? The goddamn morgue.

1005
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,440
Okay.

1006
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,350
<i>Marlo.</i>

1007
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,029
<i>Marlo.</i>

1008
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,400
<i>Marlo?</i>

1009
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,360
Cyrus.

1010
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,111
<i>Jamie...</i>

1011
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,120
<i>Jamie.</i>

1012
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,236
<i>Like I'm seeing things.</i>

1013
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,033
<i>Something I did.</i>

1014
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,151
<i>It was my fault.</i>

1015
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,759
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1016
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,032
<i>Tessa?</i>

1017
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,157
<i>Tessa, is that really you?</i>

1018
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,632
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1019
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,039
<i>What are you?</i>

1020
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,352
Jesus Christ.

1021
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,959
What was that?

1022
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,515
She was talking to someone.

1023
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,512
Someone was there.

1024
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,239
You don't know that.

1025
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,079
She could've been hallucinating.

1026
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,913
It didn't sound like that to me.

1027
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,111
What if it was Tessa?

1028
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,840
What do you mean?

1029
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,276
She saw something. You heard her.

1030
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,800
She said that she did something.

1031
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,673
Something was her fault.

1032
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,678
What if that's it? What if...

1033
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,550
What if our sins are coming for us?

1034
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,909
Sins. That's ridiculous.

1035
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,992
So, what are we gonna do?

1036
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,674
What are we gonna do?

1037
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,600
We're gonna tell each other
the goddamn truth.

1038
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,558
That's what we're gonna do.

1039
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,556
Uh...

1040
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,838
There's a girl I... I used to know.

1041
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,229
Alicia.

1042
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,437
She was a waitress at
my dad's country club.

1043
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,590
Oh, my God.

1044
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:44,911
- You killed her?
- What? No.

1045
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,151
No, I did not kill anyone.

1046
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,756
I, uh...

1047
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,474
I got her pregnant.

1048
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,115
I wanted to help, you know?

1049
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:02,475
Pay for the abortion, be...
Go with her for the procedure.

1050
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,872
Anyway, uh, the... The day came,

1051
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,317
and I... I couldn't deal with it.

1052
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,997
I... I drove right past.

1053
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,272
I left her to fend for herself.

1054
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,232
And she showed up in your flatline?

1055
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,232
I wish that was all.

1056
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,312
She showed up last night, too.

1057
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,520
So you're being haunted
by somebody that's alive.

1058
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,070
- What are you talking about?
- This.

1059
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,793
I am talking about this.

1060
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,519
Alicia did this to me.

1061
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,597
Only it wasn't her.

1062
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,512
Just like it wasn't Courtney's sister.

1063
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,920
Then what was it?

1064
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,915
Jamie, what?

1065
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,232
I... I don't know.

1066
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:46,109
Something feeding off
our guilty conscience.

1067
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,000
What do you mean? Like...

1068
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,719
Something demonic?

1069
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,316
Maybe it's using our pasts, our sins.

1070
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:56,353
Wait, wait.

1071
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,755
We're rational people here.

1072
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,559
You could have stabbed yourself.

1073
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,552
People on drugs hurt
themselves all the time.

1074
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,512
There has to be a logical explanation.

1075
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,830
I was 17.

1076
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,556
Her name was Irina Wong,
and she had a higher GPA than I did,

1077
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,233
so I hacked her text messages

1078
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,797
and I sent her naked photos
to the whole class.

1079
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,833
It destroyed her.

1080
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,116
What is the point in
confessing all of this?

1081
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,840
This is clearly just happening here.

1082
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,277
- That thing...
- Look, look, Courtney said to me

1083
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,710
she thinks maybe we opened a door.

1084
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,036
Wait, so you knew?

1085
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,834
You and Courtney knew there was
a downside to flatlining,

1086
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,616
and... And you still let
me and Marlo go in?

1087
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,496
Hey, look, I thought it was
just part of the experience.

1088
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,874
Side effects may include

1089
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,912
dry mouth, hallucinations,
existential dread.

1090
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,071
I did not know that
the side effects would show up

1091
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,753
and start hunting us down.

1092
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:44,759
There is a scientific explanation
to all of this.

1093
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,076
We're way beyond explanations.

1094
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,594
Okay.

1095
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,958
If Courtney was right,

1096
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,278
whatever's happening to us,

1097
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,512
these hallucinations, these hauntings,
whatever it is,

1098
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,831
it's only gonna get worse.

1099
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,674
Until we figure it out,

1100
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,354
until we figure out what to do,

1101
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:09,076
whatever killed her
is gonna kill all of us, too.

1102
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,794
Note the negative mass effect
secondary to the encephalomalacia.

1103
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,197
There are multiple foci of high
T2 and FLAIR signal intensity

1104
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,959
in the supratentorial white matter.

1105
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,635
These findings are nonspecific,
but most in keeping with

1106
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,616
chronic microangiopathic changes.

1107
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,518
You'll note there's no hydrocephalus.

1108
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,355
There's no brain herniation.
The vessels are well seen.

1109
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,517
You'll note that the gray matter

1110
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,996
differentiation is completely maintained.

1111
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,391
You little slut.
I can't believe you slept with him.

1112
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,159
Not only are you a hopeless grind,

1113
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:51,631
but you're an immature,
whiney, crybaby bitch.

1114
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,355
- Okay, stop!
- Excuse me?

1115
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,190
Sorry. Sorry.

1116
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,600
No.

1117
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,200
No! No! No!

1118
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,640
No!

1119
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:08,996
No.

1120
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,874
No.

1121
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:31,316
No.

1122
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,280
No.

1123
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,552
Stop!

1124
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,632
Stop! No!

1125
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,680
No!

1126
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,632
Stop! No!

1127
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,710
Hey.

1128
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,510
Hey.

1129
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,436
What are you doing here?

1130
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:49,997
Have you seen Cyrus Gudgeon lately?

1131
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,136
If that's supposed to be a joke,

1132
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,833
- it's not funny.
- It's not a joke.

1133
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,514
Then what?

1134
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,990
I pulled the autopsy report.

1135
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,032
It says nothing about metoprolol.

1136
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,477
So then I went back to the original
path lab notes of the blood test,

1137
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,592
and there it was.

1138
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,109
Metoprolol.

1139
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,840
I'm going inside.

1140
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:18,631
Why wouldn't the autopsy report
match with the notes, Marlo?

1141
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,316
Marlo?

1142
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,153
Marlo.

1143
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,872
Did you change that autopsy report?

1144
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,272
I had to protect myself.

1145
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,918
Protect yourself? Really?

1146
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:39,997
By making it look like he died from a sting

1147
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,639
and not a drug you administered?

1148
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,114
I know.

1149
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,910
- I know. It was wrong of me.
- You got to tell someone.

1150
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,993
- I am. I'm telling you.
- The dean, Marlo.

1151
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,117
You have to tell the dean
you changed that report.

1152
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,236
Why?

1153
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,352
- What good is that gonna do now?
- Really?

1154
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,834
You don't see it?

1155
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,513
It's your flatline, Cyrus Gudgeon.

1156
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:03,112
You know, it was so nice being with you

1157
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:07,359
and realizing, after all this time,
that you actually like me.

1158
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,358
And now you have to go and spoil it.

1159
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,040
- I am here because I like you.
- Yeah, well, it's easy for you.

1160
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,316
You don't have to sacrifice anything.

1161
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:18,674
I'm becoming a doctor
with a degree from a top medical school.

1162
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,190
I've worked my whole life for this.

1163
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,753
And now, I... I made one mistake.
I mean, admitting it

1164
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,433
is not gonna bring the guy back.

1165
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,950
All it's gonna do is end my career.

1166
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,635
That is the point here,

1167
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,518
your career.

1168
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:43,791
If you were willing to change
an autopsy report, then...

1169
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,234
Say it.

1170
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,634
Then maybe you shouldn't be a doctor.

1171
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,877
Hi. Um, is this Beverly Wong?

1172
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,036
Beverly Wong from East Hadley?

1173
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:08,716
It is?

1174
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,117
Do you have a daughter named Irina?

1175
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,795
Hey.

1176
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,519
Thanks for coming with me.

1177
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,320
Could you have
rented a smaller car?

1178
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,280
You're sure it's the same Irina?

1179
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:33,396
Uh...

1180
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,075
Irina.

1181
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,350
Yes.

1182
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,880
It's Sophia.

1183
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,958
From East Hadley.

1184
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,236
We went to the same high school.

1185
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,631
I'm sorry. I know, it... It's...
It's been forever.

1186
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,796
I, um...

1187
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:59,230
I really needed to talk to you,
so I was hoping we could sit down...

1188
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,794
What is this about?

1189
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,596
You never knew this, but...

1190
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,958
I was the one who sent your pictures
to the whole class.

1191
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,240
That was me.

1192
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:23,678
I can't stand myself to think about it.

1193
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,952
Bottom line, it was
an awful thing to do. I know that.

1194
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,833
What do you want?

1195
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,120
I'd like you to accept my apology.

1196
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,919
It's not necessary.

1197
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,674
Okay? I've moved on.

1198
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,837
Irina... This is important, okay?

1199
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,673
I am so sorry.

1200
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,512
Irina, please.

1201
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,675
Sophia.

1202
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,835
I forgive you.

1203
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:15,839
Thank you.

1204
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,634
What'd she say?

1205
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,616
<i>Hey, Marlo, it's Jamie.</i>

1206
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:29,308
Hey.

1207
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,360
<i>Look, we're just
kind of riffing here,</i>

1208
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,160
but maybe you find whoever you've wronged,

1209
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:36,478
whatever you're feeling guilty about,
and you take responsibility.

1210
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,119
<i>I mean, look, who knows if it'll work?</i>

1211
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:41,079
<i>But what have we got to lose?</i>

1212
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,950
Alicia!

1213
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,920
Alicia.

1214
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,839
Hey. It's... It's me.

1215
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,912
It's Jamie.

1216
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,200
What are you doing here, Jamie?

1217
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,840
He's your son?

1218
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,840
Hey. Hey... I came to apologize.

1219
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:36,832
For taking off on you.

1220
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,032
I... I panicked. I was a coward.

1221
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,430
I should have been there for you.

1222
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,711
But you weren't.

1223
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,280
Look, I...

1224
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,835
I want to make amends.

1225
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,479
Do what's right.

1226
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,392
Help... Help you out.

1227
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,318
Whatever you need.

1228
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,160
Alicia.

1229
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,280
Who is that man, Mommy?

1230
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,309
What?

1231
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,830
What the hell?

1232
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,160
Sophia?

1233
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,680
<i>I just got a message from Marlo.</i>

1234
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:20,911
<i>Something's wrong. And her phone is off.</i>

1235
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,480
We need to find her.

1236
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,994
Okay. Uh, where are you?

1237
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,793
I'm... I'm gonna come to you.

1238
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,996
Marlo?

1239
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,480
Marlo!

1240
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,671
<i>She's not here, man.</i>

1241
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,035
Wait. Wait!

1242
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,190
Marlo?

1243
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,233
Forget it. She's here.

1244
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,879
<i>Come as fast as you can!</i>

1245
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,194
I'm nearly there.

1246
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,600
You got to hurry.

1247
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:46,915
Ray!

1248
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,794
She must be down there. Come.

1249
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,473
Okay.

1250
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,320
Oh, come on!

1251
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:07,710
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no!

1252
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,680
Oh, my God.
How long has she been under?

1253
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,029
It's been over four minutes.

1254
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,480
Sure.

1255
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,355
Come on. We need oxygen!

1256
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,920
Cyrus. I'm so sorry.

1257
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,394
Forgive me.

1258
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,632
Will you please forgive me?

1259
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:41,675
No pulse.

1260
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:44,912
Take over the compressions.

1261
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,992
Go, go, go!

1262
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,400
Ahhh!

1263
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,159
It's not working. Shit.

1264
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:16,870
Stop.

1265
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,353
Nothing.

1266
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,394
Ray.

1267
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:25,034
Marlo, don't you get it?

1268
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,837
I need you to come back.

1269
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,440
To me.

1270
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:42,156
<i>Marlo, Marlo...</i>

1271
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,359
<i>Marlo? Marlo.</i>

1272
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,669
No! No!

1273
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,040
<i>Marlo.</i>

1274
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:33,916
You have to forgive yourself.

1275
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:37,394
Forgive yourself, Marlo.

1276
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,520
No!

1277
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:42,515
Charge 360.

1278
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,555
Ray?

1279
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,314
Okay. Okay.

1280
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,834
Oh, my...

1281
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:19,550
It's okay. It's okay.

1282
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,835
Hey.

1283
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,280
Here.

1284
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,720
There you go.

1285
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:37,474
Thank you.

1286
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,875
You okay?

1287
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,955
Yeah.

1288
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,032
I found the girl.

1289
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:52,032
And, uh, a little boy.

1290
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,990
Yeah.

1291
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:57,474
The hell with going to I.A.

1292
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,876
I'm getting a residency right here.

1293
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,469
Be near them.

1294
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:06,032
I'm gonna try.

1295
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:13,237
<i>Courtney was right.</i>

1296
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,471
<i>It's not enough to apologize.</i>

1297
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,035
<i>We have to face up to what we've done,</i>

1298
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:20,800
<i>and then forgive ourselves.</i>

1299
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:24,514
<i>Some lines should not be crossed.</i>

1300
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:27,030
<i>We lost a friend.</i>

1301
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,751
<i>We will never be the same.</i>

1302
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:32,835
Where were you?

1303
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,559
I talked to the dean.

1304
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:36,279
How'd it go?

1305
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,079
I'm on probation.

1306
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,591
Did you bring it?

1307
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,000
Here.

1308
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,555
Only Courtney knows now.

1309
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:18,117
Feels so weird just being here
without Courtney.

1310
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,632
Anyone want to say something?

1311
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,318
Let's just get hammered.

1312
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,875
Why don't you say something?

1313
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,153
To Courtney.

1314
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,359
To Courtney.

1315
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:31,918
<i>You flipped the page And slipped away.</i>

1316
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,550
<i>Never thought that you were.</i>

1317
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:41,795
<i>Someone to say things that you didn't mean.</i>

1318
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:48,912
<i>You didn't even call to
wish me sweet dreams</i>

1319
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:53,592
<i>I really thought we made a sweet team.</i>

1320
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,239
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1321
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,231
<i>But don't cry.</i>

1322
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:04,194
<i>Consider this a lullaby.</i>

1323
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:11,838
<i>Sweet dreams...</i>

1324
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:30,440
<i>Ticking clocks on the wall.</i>

1325
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:34,153
<i>Waiting for your call.</i>

1326
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,920
<i>Mmm, but that cuckoo bird.</i>

1327
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,758
<i>Won't sing at all.</i>

1328
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,632
<i>Never thought that you would.</i>

1329
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:52,558
<i>Take everything we had and loved and leave.</i>

1330
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,200
<i>You didn't even call to
wish me sweet dreams.</i>

1331
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:04,272
<i>I really thought we made a sweet team.</i>

1332
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:05,919
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1333
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,757
<i>But don't cry.</i>

1334
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:14,274
<i>Can't you see that you're a love of mine?</i>

1335
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:20,200
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

1336
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:25,192
<i>Always thought you were the sweetest thing.</i>

1337
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,192
<i>Uh-huh...</i>

1338
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,638
<i>But don't cry.</i>

1339
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,355
<i>Consider this a lullaby.</i>

1340
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,752
<i>In sweet dreams.</i>

1341
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:46,359
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

1342
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:51,240
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

1343
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:56,632
<i>Oh, sweet dreams</i>

1344
01:47:56,656 --> 01:48:04,656
