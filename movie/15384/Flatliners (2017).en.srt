1
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,150
Courtney!

2
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,469
I had this sensation
of someone taking my hand, guiding me...

3
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,989
I looked up
and I saw this light.

4
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,030
The giant wall of light. Brighter...

5
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,709
All of a sudden,
I was in a different place.

6
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,870
Pure energy.

7
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:13,199
I fail to find words
that can describe what I experienced.

8
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,360
At that point,
I had that out-of-body experience.

9
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,430
I remember a feeling
of being sucked backwards,

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,310
like being pulled through water.

11
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,310
I wasn't having thoughts of my own.

12
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,360
Answers, uh, messages coming through me.

13
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,949
Colors were so vivid.
Colors I've never seen before.

14
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,150
Then I was pushed
right back into my body.

15
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,270
I could actually
see my body from above,

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,270
like it was lifeless.

17
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,389
And I was floating up...

18
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,829
Everything
I thought was important was

19
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,469
dwarfed by this sense of love.

20
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,069
And I could feel this pull,

21
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,229
a force trying to drag me down
this black tunnel.

22
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,389
Where is it taking me?

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,509
I don't know what's going on.

24
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,229
I think I'm going crazy.

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,830
I'm seeing things.

26
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,639
Something I did.

27
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,750
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,389
Hello, Lauren.

29
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,270
How are you feeling?

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,310
You had a seizure tonight.

31
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,430
You're at Trinity Emmanuel Medical Center.

32
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,990
Lauren,

33
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,069
do you know that your heart stopped?

34
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,199
You were gone for several minutes,

35
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,270
but the trauma team brought you back.

36
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,030
Do you remember any of that?

37
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,349
If you felt anything, if you saw anything?

38
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,389
Did you lose someone, sweetheart?

39
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,279
She's in here.

40
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,670
We're taking you to Imaging.
You'll be okay.

41
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,110
One for transfer in five.

42
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,829
Ready? One, two, three.

43
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,029
Transfer from Holy Cross.

44
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,350
38-year-old construction
worker, fell off a beam.

45
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,350
Persistent coma. GCS 6.

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,079
- I'll page the resident.
- Mmm-hmm.

47
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,480
Already done. I got this.

48
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,090
Which one of you is in charge here?

49
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,230
It's my intake.

50
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,350
Actually, I'm the one on duty.

51
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,790
I got it. I got it. Thank you.

52
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,670
Standard procedure for a GCS 6 admit

53
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,509
calls for two large-bore IVs
and diazepam on standby.

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,839
Seizure meds won't do any good.

55
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,439
Whatever is wrong is
in his spinal column, not his brain.

56
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,430
And what medical protocol are you citing?

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,149
The protocol of actually living
in the real world,

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,550
where guys with crappy HMOs
go undiagnosed for spinal injuries.

59
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,230
Actually, he's on seizure meds,

60
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,110
which is the medical protocol
of reading his chart.

61
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,839
Oh, shit. No, no, no.

62
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,470
- Shit.
- Uh, uh...

63
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,629
What is it?

64
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,279
Respiratory failure.

65
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,319
He might be hemorrhaging.

66
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,149
Page Neurosurgery, call a code,
and get CT on standby.

67
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,269
Students, clear the room.

68
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,389
Hey. What is it? What's wrong?

69
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,269
Did you know that there's
12 pairs of nerves

70
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,189
just within the cranial area?

71
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,790
The, um... The oculomotor,

72
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,519
the trochlear, the glossopharyngeal, and...

73
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,310
Nine others whose names I cannot remember.

74
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,750
I cannot absorb any more terminology.

75
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,389
I have, like...
A rash on my arm. I can't sleep.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,350
You know, my mother invested

77
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,389
her entire life savings into my education.

78
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,990
Come on.

79
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,230
Come on, that's enough suffering
for one night.

80
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,949
Let's get out of here. Yeah?

81
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,139
It's cold.

82
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,629
We used to be friends, right?

83
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,649
- What is...
- Like, our first year,

84
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,199
when we would sit together at lecture.

85
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,389
- Remember?
- Mmm.

86
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,240
And we'd, like, go running and get coffee.

87
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,029
Hang out. Do stuff.

88
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,550
We're still friends, though.

89
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,750
No, we don't talk.

90
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,670
We just work and... And compete.

91
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,550
Who's the fastest to make
a diagnosis of Bell's palsy?

92
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,199
Quick, what's the seven
side effects of Ativan?

93
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,300
You know, just last week,
a second-year committed suicide.

94
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,870
God, Court, you're gonna be
such a good doctor.

95
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,310
Medicine just, like, comes easy to you.

96
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,230
You know, I think there's a way that
we could spend more time together.

97
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,009
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'm just wondering

98
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,803
if you'd help me on
this little, like,

99
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:38,909
extracurricular project
I've been working on.

100
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,509
Uh... We just...

101
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,670
We have neuro shelf exams
in, like, 10 days.

102
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,909
I don't really feel like I'm gonna make it.

103
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,870
Oh, Once One Takes The Anatomy Final,
Very Good Vacations Are Heavenly.

104
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,629
- What? Oh.
- It's a mnemonic phrase.

105
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,790
You use it to remember
the 12 cranial nerves.

106
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,790
- Yeah.
- Ah. Thank you.

107
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,629
You're welcome.

108
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,269
But, yeah, I'm...
I really would love your help.

109
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,750
Maybe.

110
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,709
Hey.

111
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,829
What's in those?

112
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,639
First one's Mountain Dew
laced with Adderall.

113
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,389
Other's a chaser of espressos.

114
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,029
- Together, it's a liquid heart attack.
- Hey, Jamie.

115
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,589
Oh, Jesus.

116
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,949
Hey.

117
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,789
"Hey, Jamie." Where were you last night?

118
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,470
Your eyes are still dilated.

119
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,909
25-year-old female,
admitted last night.

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,909
Complaining of numbness on left side,
nausea, vomiting.

121
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,710
Anything of note from the physical exam?

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,679
Sees the color red differently

123
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,549
between left and right
eye, and oral ulcers.

124
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,429
Sophia, what test should we run?

125
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,629
A lumbar puncture, then MRI of the brain.

126
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,909
Fine, but reverse the order.
Images first, then procedure.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,460
Preliminary diagnosis, Brad.

128
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,039
- Pituitary cyst?
- No.

129
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,279
Jamie.

130
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,070
Uh...

131
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Jackie.

132
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,470
- Um, stroke?
- My God.

133
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,519
You need to do better than this.

134
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
All of you.

135
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,389
What do you think the largest
age demographic is in our society today?

136
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,269
You.

137
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,070
Young adults in their 20s, which means

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,429
that there are at least
1,000 people waiting

139
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,149
to take your spot.

140
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,759
And we are not in the business of
training country club doctors,

141
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,590
nor do we waste our time
on students who think

142
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,830
that they can skate by
doing the least work necessary.

143
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,070
We are here to educate students
who push themselves,

144
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,750
those who are capable
of making new discoveries

145
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,149
and actually move the dial
on human knowledge.

146
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,429
And for those of you who think
that's too much,

147
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,429
then you should leave.

148
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,019
And by that, I mean now.

149
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,350
Marlo, if I were to tell you

150
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,870
that the patient's family
background was Mediterranean,

151
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,350
i.e., Greek or Turkish,
what would the diagnosis be?

152
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,509
I don't think you'll find it
in your notebook.

153
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,990
It's Behcet's disease.

154
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,750
Thank you, Ray.

155
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,509
Moving on.

156
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,750
Why are you working this event?

157
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,190
You're a trust-fund kid.
You sleep on a sailboat.

158
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,350
Yeah, but there's this really hot caterer

159
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,919
- I've been trying to meet.
- Ah.

160
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,990
Look at all these stodgy
old docs with their white wine

161
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,870
and their golf games.

162
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,870
I don't think it's such a bad life.

163
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,610
I don't know about you,

164
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,750
but I'm certainly not gonna spend
the next 40 years doing prostate exams.

165
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,669
No one pays their dues anymore.

166
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,669
Our generation,
it's all about entrepreneurship.

167
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,350
Yeah, so what are you gonna do?

168
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,269
I'm going to LA.

169
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,470
Look at this face.

170
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,750
I'm gonna be the Anderson Cooper
of celebrity medicine.

171
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,710
Okay.

172
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,879
"Oh, hi, Mom. It's my afternoon check-in."

173
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,230
That's funny. Cool. Okay.

174
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,440
You know there's nothing
I can do about her right now.

175
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,629
Did she really move here
just to keep tabs on you?

176
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,990
Mmm-hmm.

177
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,299
Hey, come on, look.

178
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,750
- My station is full.
- Okay.

179
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,029
You're so behind.

180
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,870
Okay, sir, got to give
you a testicular exam.

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,710
- Should just take a minute.
- What? No.

182
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,879
- Excuse the reach.
- Wait a... Wait a minute!

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't enjoy it either.

184
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,190
Just close your eyes and pretend
I'm the candy-stripe girl.

185
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,759
What? Get... Get the hell off of me!

186
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Hold on.

187
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,799
- Candy-stripe girl.
- Whoa, whoa! Get...

188
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,830
- No, wait a minute.
- Stop! What are you doing?

189
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,669
He doesn't need a testicular exam.

190
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,750
He doesn't?

191
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,389
Come near me again, I'm killing you.

192
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,389
You know, I think I got mixed up.

193
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,429
It says here the resident wanted a neural
test for that guy, not a testicular exam.

194
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,830
I can't imagine how I passed
the wrong information to you.

195
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,710
Very funny.

196
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,679
Ray can be a real dick sometimes.
You guys notice that?

197
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,080
I think he's intriguing.

198
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,830
Let's go, people. No lunch break today.

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,789
Every bed in the unit is full,
and we got referrals waiting in the ER.

200
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,590
Get moving on afternoon rounds.

201
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,870
Excuse me.

202
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,470
Do you have plans tonight?

203
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,669
First-years are having a wingding.

204
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,269
Dorm punch and a deejay,
but I'm not above it.

205
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,350
I can't wait for the anesthesia rotation.

206
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,710
Those guys have access to the best drugs.

207
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,509
Looking for this?

208
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,429
Hell yeah.

209
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,710
I found it on my nightstand.

210
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,399
See you later.

211
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,309
These second-years have no tact,

212
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,269
coming up to me like that
in front of my colleague.

213
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,950
Yeah, we're colleagues, aren't we?

214
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,269
I mean, we have fun together.

215
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,029
Yeah, kinda.

216
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,710
Do you want to have fun with me later?

217
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,549
Courtney Holmes, I am mildly surprised

218
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,789
to be having this conversation with you.

219
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:26,389
But offer accepted.

220
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,830
Midnight, basement, sub level C.

221
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,750
You want
to meet me in the basement?

222
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:39,309
Sublevel C, underneath the old building.

223
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,309
And take the service elevator,

224
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,669
'cause it doesn't have
surveillance cameras.

225
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,190
Yeah. Good idea.

226
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,580
No.

227
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,269
Jesus!

228
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,909
You're late.

229
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,669
What are we doing down here?

230
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,830
Come on, we don't have much time.

231
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,990
Okay, Courtney, what's going on?

232
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,750
It's past midnight. I should be studying.

233
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,909
We're almost there, okay?

234
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,509
What is all of this?

235
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,480
They put this in five years ago.

236
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,029
In case of a natural
disaster, loss of power.

237
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,350
It's a fully functioning hospital,
and it never gets used.

238
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,000
Whoa.

239
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,029
Um, Court, what exactly are you up to?

240
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,639
- Um...
- Wow.

241
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,990
Two of you.

242
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,320
Jamie, what are you doing here?

243
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,789
Uh, she didn't tell me
about you either, okay?

244
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,029
But, I'm open to a three-way.

245
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,190
Ew. Shut up.

246
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,600
What?

247
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,950
Oh, I like it!

248
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,710
Scanners, cameras, our choice of beds.

249
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,629
- We can be as loud as we want.
- Courtney, what's going on?

250
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,870
I asked for his help, too.
He probably misinterpreted.

251
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,870
Oh. Oh, you mean we're not getting it on?

252
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,470
Wait, what are you talking about?

253
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,590
I've been searching
for the region of the brain

254
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,139
that is responsible
for near-death experiences.

255
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,549
And these are postmortem scans

256
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,870
of patients that have
died in this hospital.

257
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,070
Is there any
circumstance under which

258
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,639
- you'd have sex with me?
- God, stop.

259
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,590
Look, if the brain is just another organ,

260
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,149
why doesn't it just go dark
and... And shut off

261
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,389
at the moment of death?

262
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,240
You know, why the floating?

263
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,389
Why the white light?

264
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,840
Why the sense of well-being?

265
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,309
I mean, what is that experience?

266
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,110
Is it chemical, or is it something else?

267
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,629
Can we map that process
the way we map a seizure?

268
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,360
What if we could actually document
what happens to us after we die?

269
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,149
What do you mean?

270
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,190
Nothing happens. We're dead.

271
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,230
What if we could prove otherwise?

272
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,029
Can you imagine
the residency offers you would get?

273
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,830
And forget about Dr. Oz.

274
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,470
I mean, you would be the world's
first specialist in the afterlife.

275
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,470
Okay, you got my attention.

276
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,669
Oh, come on. This isn't science.

277
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,289
This is pseudoscience.

278
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,879
Well, maybe. Maybe not.

279
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,269
But the only way to find out
is to see for ourselves.

280
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,830
So I would like you both to stop my heart.

281
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,230
Look, I'll be in the imaging scanner.

282
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,629
It will take real-time pictures
of my brain's hemodynamic activity.

283
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,889
- Um...
- You give it one minute,

284
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,190
and then you bring me back.

285
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,350
Wait, you're serious?

286
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,470
- Stop your heart?
- This is propofol.

287
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,309
Fifty milligrams will knock me out.

288
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,849
I'll be wrapped in a cooling blanket,

289
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,630
bringing my core body temperature
down to 86 degrees.

290
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,309
And once that happens, you administer
a defibrillator shock to stop my heart.

291
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,950
Wait a sec.

292
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:19,470
Look, I've signed a release.
It's in my bag.

293
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,059
It absolves you both of any responsibility.

294
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,869
Courtney, think about what
you're saying right now.

295
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,640
Hey. Look, if she's insane enough to
try it, who are we to stop her?

296
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,630
- Um...
- Look, I'm young, okay?

297
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
I'm in excellent health.

298
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,279
You're both trained in emergency medicine.

299
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,730
So reviving me should be.

300
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,470
Very straightforward.

301
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,150
Look, it's 12:18 now.

302
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,910
I've checked the schedules
for security down here

303
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,500
and cleaning crews.

304
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,109
We have about 45 minutes,
so we should probably get going.

305
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,390
What? This is crazy.
No, count me out of this.

306
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,789
I am not helping you kill yourself.

307
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,230
Well, then you can stand by the door
and make sure nobody comes in.

308
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,369
Okay, remember,
there's a magnet in the scanner,

309
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,190
so no keys or metal in the room.

310
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,069
Look, we've got it.

311
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,230
Wait, Jamie,
what if you can't bring her back?

312
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,789
Then we burn her body, work out our alibi,

313
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,390
and pretend like nothing happened.

314
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,009
And make sure that the scanner's recording,

315
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,829
because if not,
then this whole exercise is pointless.

316
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,200
We're good to go.

317
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,670
Repeat back to me
the resuscitation procedure.

318
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,640
Uh, as soon as you're dead,
I'll run the scanner.

319
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,789
At 60 seconds, I'll start pulling you out

320
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,789
by switching to the heating blanket.

321
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,309
When your core temp's back up
to 93 degrees, I'll start CPR.

322
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,990
Crash cart is standing by
with the epi and the defib.

323
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,230
Wai... Hello? Brain damage.
You'll get brain damage.

324
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,750
Not if you resuscitate me in time.

325
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,109
Brain cells can survive without oxygen
for at least four minutes.

326
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,750
Okay.

327
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,109
Now is the point
where you say it's all a joke.

328
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,150
Okay, put the blanket on me.

329
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,789
Jamie, look at her. Come
on, she's terrified.

330
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,990
It's just my body's
natural survival instincts.

331
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,759
I anticipated this.
I'm trying to block it out.

332
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,950
Okay.

333
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,910
And now I kill you.

334
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,509
Come on, you'll both get expelled.
You'll go to prison.

335
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,109
Only if you blab about it.

336
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,950
Okay. We're really doing this.

337
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,230
Uh...

338
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,589
Uh, see you later.

339
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,190
She's out.

340
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,269
Uh, body temp's dropping.

341
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,559
Okay, look, Jamie,
we can stop right here, okay?

342
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,039
She sleeps it off, wakes up, and we just
pretend that we followed through with it.

343
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,789
If you can't handle this, then look away.

344
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,470
Fine. Yeah, Jamie, I'll just leave!

345
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,029
- Charging 200.
- Come on! This is wrong!

346
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,730
- Weren't you leaving?
- You're murdering somebody!

347
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,430
Yeah, I probably should've
stayed in tonight.

348
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,539
Clear!

349
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,470
Oh, my God.

350
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,069
- She's... She's...
- Dead.

351
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,549
I think.

352
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,430
Counting off 60 seconds.

353
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,750
Do you see any brain activity?

354
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,059
Um...

355
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,890
I mean, something's going on,
I'm not really sure what.

356
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,549
It's recording, isn't it?

357
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,869
Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,269
- Fifty-one, 52...
- Fifty-three...

359
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:06,349
Fifty-four, 55, 56, 57,

360
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,829
fifty-eight, 59,

361
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,589
- sixty seconds.
- Get her out.

362
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,150
Okay. Okay. Okay.

363
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,309
Blanket's warming.

364
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,769
- What's her temp need to get to again?
- Doesn't matter. Hurry up.

365
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,430
Calm down.

366
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,400
- Charge 200.
- Wait!

367
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,309
Clear!

368
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,150
It's... It's not working.

369
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,430
Of course it isn't.

370
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:38,269
Paddles are useless without a heart rhythm.

371
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,390
Didn't you listen to her?

372
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,049
Yeah, I was gonna write
down all the steps...

373
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,430
Move! Just move.

374
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,309
Move!

375
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,589
Did we order an MRI on... Hey.

376
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,349
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I...

377
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,190
No, she needs an epi.

378
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,390
Huh?

379
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,670
IV, you moron. God, it's already set up.

380
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,809
Just push the drug into the goddamn line!

381
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,240
Calm down! I got this.

382
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,069
God.

383
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,950
It's not working. Try something else!

384
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,480
There is nothing else.

385
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,109
Well, I...

386
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,750
What the fuck?

387
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,930
It was an experiment.

388
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,690
She had us stop her heart,
and we can't get her back.

389
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,849
- How long has she been out?
- I don't know, a couple of minutes.

390
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,119
Look, I say we try the paddles.

391
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,190
No, no! Wait! Put them down.

392
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,309
I... Stop, stop.

393
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,630
Take over for Sophia
on the chest compressions.

394
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,309
Do them much harder,
get on top of her if it helps.

395
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,789
Sophia, put that cooling blanket on.
She's too warm.

396
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,109
Then charge the defib
all the way to 360 and stand by.

397
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,930
As soon as Jamie and I get you a heartbeat,

398
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,950
however fluttering,
you put those paddles on her

399
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,470
and give her full power.

400
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,190
The blanket. Come on.

401
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,839
Got to push a lot more epi
than what you've been doing.

402
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,150
Don't stop. Don't stop. Keep going.

403
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,349
All right.

404
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,960
Come on, Courtney.

405
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,309
She's hypoxic.

406
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,829
We need to intubate.

407
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,430
All right? Go!

408
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:19,549
Let's get it off.

409
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,950
Help me.

410
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,829
BVM.

411
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,799
All right.

412
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,910
Go, go, go, go.

413
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,990
Clear!

414
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,390
Courtney, can you hear me?

415
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,230
You're crazy, you know that?

416
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,910
- You called Ray?
- Were you getting it done?

417
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,799
Does somebody want to fill me in here?

418
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,880
Mmm, it happened very gently.

419
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,029
Like, almost like an untethering.

420
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,779
And... And I... I floated to the ceiling.

421
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,309
I could see my body.
I could see Sophia and Jamie.

422
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,269
And then I could see
the roof of the hospital.

423
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,390
And I've never been up there.

424
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,589
How do you explain that?

425
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,029
I can't explain it.

426
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,430
Are you mad at us?

427
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,910
I don't know what to think

428
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,829
other than you're all pretty stupid.

429
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,910
She's lucky to be alive.

430
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,230
She's alive because of you.

431
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,109
What else happened?

432
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,990
Did you... Did you see a white light?

433
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,579
I wouldn't call it that. It was...

434
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,549
It was more like...

435
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,430
Pure energy.

436
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,470
And honestly,
it was kind of sexual, actually.

437
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,309
It was kind of sexual.

438
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,480
Guys, playback's ready.

439
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,420
Hey. Check this out.

440
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,480
Okay, look. We're counting up
from zero at the moment of death.

441
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,069
Cognitive activity has ceased.

442
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,630
Your heart stopped. No breathing, no pulse.

443
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,710
We're 15 seconds in, and there.

444
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,440
Look at that.

445
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,990
Like a bolt of lightning
in your prefrontal cortex.

446
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,079
We might just be witnessing
the afterlife, people.

447
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,420
Okay.

448
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,269
Who knows what we're looking at?

449
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,630
We're not radiologists.

450
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,440
I mean, it could just be
residual electricity.

451
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,809
- You know, synapses shutting down.
- Okay, we're moving on.

452
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,710
So, you've been dead almost 40 seconds now,

453
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,190
and look.

454
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,150
This area lights up, the hippocampus.

455
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,700
- That's not the hippocampus.
- Uh, of course it is.

456
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,670
That is the ventral tegmental area.

457
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,470
It's the oldest part of the brain,
governs thirst, hunger, love.

458
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,950
Okay, doctors, I'm glad you're having fun.

459
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,400
Got to get out of here.

460
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,549
Hey, Ray, come on.

461
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,990
Hey, no. Just let him go.

462
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,150
Adiós, adiós.

463
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,019
It's over. Her brain's just dark now.

464
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,670
- No.
- Ah-ah. Look at that.

465
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,549
Wait. Amygdala.

466
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,549
Um, that's the amygdala. Rage.

467
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,430
Stress. Emotional memory.

468
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,230
Whatever you were seeing,

469
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,589
this is just before we pulled you out.

470
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,589
Is she okay?

471
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,630
She's been sitting there
for, like, 10 minutes.

472
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,430
- Really?
- Yeah.

473
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,269
What do you think
she's doing out there?

474
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,069
I hope she doesn't try to fly.

475
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,470
If there were brain chemicals released,

476
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,029
the aftereffects could still be
in her bloodstream.

477
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,549
I took LSD once.

478
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,029
I stayed awake for three days.

479
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,869
Oh, shit.

480
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,269
I'm gonna go check on her.

481
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,960
Let's leave.

482
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,109
Ooh. Whoa.

483
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,509
That's high.

484
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,259
Hey.

485
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,670
Are you okay?

486
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,829
I'm gonna bake some bread.

487
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,920
What's with the bread?

488
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,509
Courtney baked it. Six loaves, last night.

489
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,670
She remembered her grandmother's recipe.

490
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,950
Also, she ran 12 miles.

491
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,349
- Twelve miles?
- Let's begin.

492
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:24,890
We've been ramping up Michael Evergreen
with meds for ten hours,

493
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,750
and his epilepsy hasn't gotten any better.

494
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,190
Now he's developed a skin rash.

495
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,509
It's a mystery. The meds should be working.

496
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,269
Carbamazepine?

497
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
What?

498
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,430
Carbamazepine has an 11% chance
of reacting negatively

499
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,089
with lamotrigine, which is the other drug

500
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,990
- that Michael's on.
- Seriously?

501
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,680
Good catch, Courtney.

502
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,430
Sophia, next case.

503
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,829
Um... Adele Gunther. 44 years old.
Admitted with mild confusion.

504
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,039
Says her sister's an impostor,
she doesn't recognize her.

505
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,430
No history of trauma.
Too young for dementia.

506
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,930
We're gonna send it out
to Psychiatry for...

507
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,990
It's Capgras syndrome.

508
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,470
- Huh?
- Hmm?

509
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:05,150
- Go on.
- Capgras is an impairment

510
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,269
of the brain's facial recognition center.

511
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,190
And a very rare diagnosis.

512
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:12,390
V.S. Ramachandran, in his book,
Phantoms of the Brain,

513
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,349
links frontal cortex dichotomies,
like this, to Capgras.

514
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,869
That's not on this year's syllabus.

515
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,309
Optional reading in my first year.

516
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,750
Hmm. Well, that's more like it.

517
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,069
My sister loved this piece.

518
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:48,309
Drug warnings for carbamazepine
run 20 pages long.

519
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,710
How could she possibly
recall a detail like that?

520
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,710
How is she playing the piano again,
after 12 years?

521
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,869
She's not playing that well.

522
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,789
It's like her brain's been rewired,

523
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,470
accessing everything she's ever learned.

524
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,670
I don't care what happened to her.

525
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,069
This experiment needs to end right now.

526
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,549
I'm not gonna risk everything
for a morbid fascination you guys have.

527
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,589
You think you're all medical pioneers?

528
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,789
You're just a bunch of
rich kids screwing around,

529
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,109
before you become wealthy specialists

530
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,079
with your Ivy League bumper stickers
on your Mercedes.

531
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,910
I was with you until the end.

532
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,720
No one puts bumper stickers on a Mercedes.

533
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,990
I think we're way past parlor tricks here.

534
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,190
Uh, that does it. I'm going next.

535
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,150
- Okay.
- Tonight. I am.

536
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,910
And you're all gonna be there.

537
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,109
It's a good day to die.

538
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,909
No! No!

539
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,590
Jesus Christ.

540
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,630
Whoo!

541
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,000
Is that what I looked like?

542
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,909
Yep. Exactly like that.

543
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,389
- I knew you'd show up.
- How long has he been under?

544
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,590
Uh, 45 seconds.

545
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:49,710
I thought you'd had it
with all this foolishness.

546
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,599
Jamie asked me to be here.

547
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,630
He wanted me to pull him out.

548
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,449
- Pause compressions.
- One, two, three...

549
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,269
- Still no heartbeat.
- Pushing epi.

550
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,920
- Come on, Jamie, wake up.
- He can't hear you.

551
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,190
Sophia, get ready to intubate.

552
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,389
Oh, okay. Um, I've never done this before,

553
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,889
- so just give me a second...
- Just do it!

554
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,869
Ray, relax. There's no need to panic.

555
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,030
Let's give the epi a second to work.

556
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,550
Jamie...

557
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,349
Clear!

558
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,510
Take it out, take it out.

559
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,110
Hey...

560
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,670
Jesus, Jamie, Jamie.

561
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,429
Whoo! I need a drink.

562
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,710
Shots, shots, shots!

563
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,949
Yeah, come on!

564
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,039
Cheers!

565
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,519
Salud!

566
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,190
What do you guys think about
taking this wall down?

567
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,739
- No, no, no.
- I've always wanted a loft.

568
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,550
Oh! It's hailing! Courtney!

569
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,909
What?

570
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,389
- Oh! Oh!
- Watch it!

571
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,469
- Oh!
- This is crazy.

572
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:48,550
It's like they're on the same wavelength.

573
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,829
We should bottle flatlining,
sell it as a club drug.

574
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,949
Here. Use this.

575
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,469
Hey, no, no!

576
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,869
Oh, my God.

577
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,000
This has been the strangest
night of my life.

578
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,559
You going next, Ray?

579
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,710
- What, flatlining? No way.
- Uh-huh.

580
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,750
I'd bring you back out.

581
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,670
Maybe.

582
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,599
You have to admit, I was pretty good
with that defibrillator.

583
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,230
You were okay.

584
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,630
Would it kill you to admit that
I might be just as good a doctor as you?

585
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,070
I never said you were not.

586
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,150
Hey, Marlo, your brother's here.

587
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,150
You have no more experience
than the rest of us.

588
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,760
I do.

589
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,750
I was a firefighter in Houston.

590
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,389
Almost six years.

591
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,869
I'm going next.

592
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:46,469
It... It was super fun.

593
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,480
I was all-powerful.
I had the whole city to myself.

594
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,710
It's weird, isn't it?

595
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,190
I thought there'd be more people, like...

596
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,510
Aren't you supposed to see...

597
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:04,389
family members who've died, or...

598
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,590
Maybe there's no one there
because it wasn't really our time.

599
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,349
Was it all fun?

600
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,309
What do you mean?

601
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,469
I don't... I mean, like...
Was there anything disturbing or...

602
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,710
Not really.

603
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,909
Why?

604
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,670
Nothing.

605
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,670
She's stabilizing.

606
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,449
I don't understand.
The data shows her starting

607
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,670
into a massive seizure,
and then it just went away.

608
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,869
I gave her Ativan.

609
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,909
On whose authority?

610
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,900
I'm sorry. I'll get approval next time.

611
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,309
You saved her life.

612
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,269
Yes, I did.

613
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,710
I'm Jesus.

614
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,829
Everyone I touch today, I'm gonna heal.

615
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,739
You know, it's funny, because
you and Courtney both flat...

616
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,719
You both flatlined,

617
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,269
yet Courtney has focused on the past.

618
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,389
Memories, recipes.

619
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,030
Whereas you, you're... You're focused
on the present, using your intuition.

620
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,269
What does that have in
common with Courtney?

621
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,400
Sophia, Marlo,
you're needed in the ICU.

622
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,949
It's an awakening.

623
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,000
See you later, Jesus.

624
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,389
- An awakening?
- Yeah.

625
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,400
You here for the abortion?

626
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Huh?

627
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,590
Should Ernesto La Paz get morphine?

628
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,630
Uh...

629
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,710
Oh. Uh, I'll, uh...
I'll check with the resident.

630
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:40,639
- Sophia?
- Hmm?

631
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,070
Where are you going?

632
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,269
It's 11:30 at night.

633
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,489
You're not on call,
and you don't have anything scheduled.

634
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,150
No, I'm... I'm going to the library.

635
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,530
I'm just gonna do some more studying.

636
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,559
No, no, no, no.

637
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,869
I'm making tea and we're gonna
start reviewing

638
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,800
all of the terminology
for the nervous system.

639
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,309
- But I...
- Now.

640
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,070
Okay.

641
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:03,269
Where's Sophia?

642
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,510
We need to start. It's already 12:15.

643
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,230
This isn't gonna hurt, is it?

644
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,199
The anesthesia
will take care of that.

645
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,030
Three minutes.

646
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,599
Well, Jamie only did two.

647
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:13,679
What can I say?

648
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
I'm competitive.

649
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,000
After my three minutes are done,

650
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:19,590
these are the interventions I want,
in their specific order.

651
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:22,480
If I don't come out right away,
I want you to intubate me.

652
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,349
Force the oxygen, okay?

653
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,469
Hey, I'm gonna bring you out of it, hmm?

654
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,510
Relax. Enjoy the experience.

655
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:31,789
Okay, okay.

656
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:35,920
Infusion's flowing.

657
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,550
She's out. Body temp's 94.

658
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,750
Charging 200.

659
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:57,670
Clear.

660
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,869
Asystole.

661
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,469
38-year-old male,
stung in the face by a jellyfish.

662
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:00,079
By a jellyfish.

663
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:06,269
That's it. Let's get her out.

664
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:11,119
Epi in.

665
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:13,630
- Defib!
- Charge to 200.

666
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,989
Clear.

667
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,389
- No pulse.
- Damn it, we just had it.

668
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,550
Juice her again.

669
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,989
I'm gonna push an epi and sodium bicarb.

670
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,230
Defib. She's not stabilizing.

671
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,019
Charge 300.

672
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,510
Clear. Come on.

673
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,110
No pulse.

674
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,469
This is not working. I need to intubate.

675
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:04,710
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

676
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,119
Calm down. I got this.

677
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,989
360. Clear.

678
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,510
Please.

679
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,980
She's back.

680
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,670
You good? You're all right.

681
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,550
- Yeah.
- There you go.

682
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:52,190
We're safe. No one ever comes up here.

683
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,670
- It's so beautiful.
- Isn't it?

684
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,300
Her temp's low.

685
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,030
Pulse still racing.

686
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:01,389
Well, I think three minutes is too long.

687
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,230
Oh, look, she had a bad trip. It happens.

688
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,510
What, you're an expert?

689
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,949
Uh, yeah, more than you.

690
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,349
- Is she okay?
- Where have you been?

691
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:11,429
- Marlo is fine.
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

692
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,070
I'm going next. Right now.

693
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,159
- Right now?
- Why not?

694
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:17,920
The cleaning crew is gonna be
down there in like 20 minutes.

695
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:19,869
- Okay.
- No, we've gone too far.

696
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:21,190
No more flatlining.

697
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,320
Okay, so you three get to
expand your consciousness

698
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,389
and get academic advantage, but I don't?

699
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,530
Advantage.

700
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,010
You think this makes you better, Sophia?

701
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:29,110
This makes you dead.

702
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,650
You have much more sense than that.

703
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:34,150
Ray, if this bothers you so much,
then just walk away.

704
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:36,280
- Well, maybe I should.
- You're not going anywhere.

705
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,309
You're in this as deep as the rest of us.

706
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,909
Okay, look,
I don't care how dangerous this is.

707
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,559
I need this more than any of you guys.

708
00:47:43,719 --> 00:47:45,469
Ray, it's her decision.

709
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:47,349
Just like it was each of ours.

710
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,309
If Sophia wants to do this,
then we're doing it tonight.

711
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:55,190
Just don't stay in too long.

712
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:20,349
A B-plus on a biology
exam is not acceptable.

713
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,590
Not acceptable.

714
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:24,070
That will not get you into
a top-10 medical school.

715
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,170
Someone's coming down the elevator.

716
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:37,320
- What?
- Get her out!

717
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:40,030
Come on, come on, come on.

718
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:41,340
Let's go. Let's go!

719
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:43,840
Pushing an amp of epi.

720
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:46,260
Where the hell are you going?

721
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,150
Start compressions.

722
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,070
Please, God, bring her back.

723
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:53,630
Good thinking, Doctor.

724
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:54,940
I'm sure that's gonna help.

725
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Epi in.

726
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,469
Pause compressions.

727
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,269
Clear.

728
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
Irina.

729
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,309
You are not the only
kid that is out there trying to get in.

730
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,030
Shit.

731
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,309
One, two, three.

732
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,309
V-tach.
- Charging 360.

733
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:06,869
Clear.

734
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,719
We got her, we got her.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

735
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:17,550
We're gonna get you out of here.

736
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,039
You're gonna be okay.

737
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,510
- Come on, you'll be okay. Come here.
- Come on.

738
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,269
- Come on!
- I got her, I got her.

739
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,010
- My jacket, my jacket.
- Got it.

740
00:50:26,039 --> 00:50:27,110
Go, go.

741
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,920
Okay. To the right.

742
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
It's open. Just get in.

743
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,590
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

744
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,909
Should you really be driving?

745
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:52,199
- Wait!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

746
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,400
Shit! Oh, shit!

747
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,230
You asshole! You left us.

748
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:00,349
- Are you okay?
- The hell I did.

749
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,750
- I saved your asses.
- Let's go!

750
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,289
- Here they come!
- Hold it right there!

751
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,469
We got to get out of here!

752
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
Hold on!

753
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:09,030
- Whoa!
- We're going too fast!

754
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,280
Oh, my God.

755
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:13,670
- Shit!
- Car!

756
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,030
Oh, God!

757
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,070
Oh, watch out!

758
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,469
Oh, my God!

759
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,269
It's not funny.

760
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,869
Whoa!

761
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,909
Here we go.

762
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,360
Whoa!

763
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,659
- Where are we going?
- Oh!

764
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,349
So what, I'm a wild child

765
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,630
Gunning for love.

766
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:52,989
It's what makes the world go round.

767
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,480
Hell yeah.

768
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,469
Feel the walls come crashing down.

769
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:58,880
Ain't no messiah.

770
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,710
Where you at, girl? Where
you, where you at?

771
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,199
Go home or go tough.

772
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,679
Oh -

773
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:08,389
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

774
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:10,349
Bum, bum, Imma bang that drum.

775
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,630
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

776
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:14,590
I blow up like bubble gum.

777
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,670
Oh.

778
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,989
They keep calling me a wild child.

779
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:21,869
Oh, they all know that I'm...

780
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,550
When faced with the darkest day.

781
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:28,550
With an endless night.

782
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:30,469
When I lay awake.

783
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:32,230
Only thought of you.

784
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:34,599
Can pull me through.

785
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:38,630
All I feel is you.

786
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,909
All I feel is you.

787
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,789
How can it be that.

788
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,829
All I feel is you

789
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:03,190
Courtney!

790
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:06,349
But you've got to show me love.

791
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,869
Give me a reason.

792
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:20,789
Come.

793
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,550
Look, I don't know if it's the experience
of dying and coming back again,

794
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:27,099
but I have got a really
intense craving right now.

795
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,110
For what, gelato?

796
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:32,269
No.

797
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,469
Oh, my God, this is crazy!

798
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,030
Sophia.

799
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,309
Sophia, open this door!

800
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:48,670
I... I, uh, I think there's
someone at the door.

801
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,670
- Sophia!
- I don't care.

802
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,469
Don't stop.

803
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:54,429
Sophia, I need you to open this door.

804
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,539
Sophia!

805
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,429
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Manning.

806
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:10,590
How dare you bring someone
back to my apartment.

807
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:11,900
I'm moving out.

808
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:15,000
- What did you say?
- I'm finding my own place.

809
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,639
You will do no such thing.

810
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:18,550
See, it doesn't matter what you say, Mom.

811
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,230
Whatever threats you make.
I'm 25 years old.

812
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,150
Succeed or fail...

813
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,320
I'm doing it on my own.

814
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,119
Good night.

815
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,789
All right.

816
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:49,030
Good night.

817
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:51,460
How are you getting home?

818
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,510
There's a metro stop nearby.

819
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,389
Look, there's something I need to tell you.

820
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,429
It's, um...

821
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:01,590
It's important.

822
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,639
So, you gonna tell me or what?

823
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,789
I killed someone.

824
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,150
What?

825
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,909
It was two months ago.

826
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,949
It was my ER rotation.

827
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,550
The patient's name was Cyrus Gudgeon.

828
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:24,590
He was admitted for a jellyfish sting.

829
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,389
Cyrus Gudgeon. Yeah, I remember.
He got stung in the face.

830
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:30,269
Died of shock, right?

831
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,510
No, he died because of
a mistake that I made.

832
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,110
I gave him epi and Benadryl.

833
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,349
But those two drugs don't cross-react.

834
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,190
He had metoprolol in his system.

835
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:42,349
He basically suffocated to death.

836
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,070
I... I'd been on duty for, like, 36 hours,

837
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:49,880
and I must have screwed up
and forgotten to ask him

838
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,989
if he was taking any medications.

839
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,590
He would be alive right now
if it wasn't for my mistake.

840
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,269
Why are you telling me this?

841
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,829
Because I saw him.

842
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:02,869
Cyrus. I saw him in my flatline.

843
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:04,869
And it must mean something, right?

844
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:07,550
Hey, mistakes happen to everybody.

845
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:10,510
Yeah, but I work so hard every single day.

846
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,869
- I do the right thing.
- I'm sure you do.

847
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,789
- I'm not a bad person.
- No, you're not.

848
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,280
I'm not a bad person. I...

849
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,630
- Everything's gonna be fine, Marlo.
- No, I'm scared.

850
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:21,349
I'm scared.

851
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:34,440
Wait, wait, wait.

852
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,750
You... You can't just...

853
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:39,389
I'm sor... I'm sorry.

854
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,650
Yeah, what am I doing with you?

855
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:43,239
- I got to go right now. I'm sorry. No...
- No. No, no, no, wait.

856
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,110
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

857
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,289
- Damn, you have so many.
- Just...

858
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,539
Okay, okay.

859
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:13,829
I got it, I got it.

860
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:16,789
Courtney!

861
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,670
Help!

862
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:37,269
Help! Tessa!

863
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,960
Tessa!

864
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,309
Help!

865
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,429
My sister!

866
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:49,070
Help!

867
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,239
My sister!

868
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,159
- My sister.
- Come on.

869
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:54,639
No! My sister!

870
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:57,829
Oh, Tessa! My... Oh. Tessa!

871
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,349
No!

872
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,269
I hope this doesn't become awkward.

873
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:14,750
Too late.

874
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,590
I can't imagine what you must think of me.

875
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,389
Why?

876
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:23,190
Well, first I tell you that I'm responsible

877
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,989
for the death of a patient,

878
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,070
and then I go and totally attack you.

879
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:30,989
I mean, seriously, what...

880
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,949
What do you see in me?

881
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:37,230
You're really hot.

882
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,269
Shut up.

883
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:48,590
- I got to go.
- Oh?

884
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:49,710
Yeah.

885
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

886
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:01,360
It was four months into our first year.

887
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,510
You were assisting at the oncology ward.

888
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,789
A breast cancer patient was there
for her first round of chemo.

889
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,070
She was anxious and scared,
but you sat down and calmed her

890
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,150
by asking about her kids, her job.

891
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:17,070
You were so kind.

892
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:19,719
You didn't think anyone was watching,

893
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,550
but I was watching you through the door.

894
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,309
Three hours later, I stopped by,

895
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:32,869
and you were there checking on her again.

896
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,639
That's what I see in you.

897
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,469
Jamie?

898
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,550
Courtney? What's going on?

899
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,230
I saw my sister.

900
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,760
Wh... What?

901
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,510
At the waterfront.

902
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,789
It was her.

903
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,389
I saw my dead sister.

904
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,190
Where... Where are you?

905
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,309
I'm home.

906
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,070
I don't understand what's happening.

907
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:47,510
Stay there.

908
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm coming over.

909
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,909
I just... I miss my sister.

910
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,550
I should have told you all that

911
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:41,269
this wasn't about

912
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,079
science or discovery.

913
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,679
I think I'm going crazy.

914
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,190
Like I'm seeing things.

915
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,429
Something I did.

916
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:03,469
It was my fault.

917
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:07,829
I'm sorry.

918
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:36,320
If you're happy.

919
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,150
And you know it, clap your hands

920
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,360
If you're happy.

921
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,630
And you know it, clap your hands

922
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,590
If you're happy and you know it

923
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:50,630
If you're happy and you know it.

924
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:51,829
Clap your hands

925
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:54,199
If you're happy.

926
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,949
And you know it, tap your toe

927
01:06:56,239 --> 01:06:58,269
Tessa?

928
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,030
If you're happy and you know it

929
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,739
If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it

930
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,469
Tessa, is that really you?

931
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:10,119
If you're happy and you
know it, tap your toe

932
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,320
If you're happy.

933
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,429
And you know it, clap your hands

934
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,960
If you're happy.

935
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:18,760
Tessa, are you okay?

936
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,230
Tessa, are you okay?

937
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,349
If you're happy and you know it.

938
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,789
Then your face will surely show it.

939
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,989
If you're happy and you know it.

940
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:28,190
Clap your hands

941
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,030
- What are you?
- Courtney!

942
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,269
Courtney.

943
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,850
Let's go!

944
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,359
Let's go!

945
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,670
Hi. An update on room four.

946
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,989
We've given the Lasix bolus,
and the output is limited.

947
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,909
Mmm-hmm.

948
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:01,149
It's been less than 50 cc's
in the last two hours.

949
01:10:05,079 --> 01:10:06,270
All right.

950
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,029
They found her at
the bottom of a fire escape.

951
01:10:16,119 --> 01:10:17,750
We'll know more after the autopsy,

952
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,789
but right now, it's
unclear whether she fell,

953
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,550
jumped, or God knows what.

954
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,270
I know you all liked her.

955
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:30,029
And I'm sorry, but for now, I need you

956
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,670
to pick up her patient load
and divide it amongst yourselves.

957
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,310
We still have a hospital to run.

958
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:44,350
Do any of you know what might
have been going on with her?

959
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:48,029
Is there something you're not telling me?

960
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:53,600
All right.

961
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,319
It just doesn't feel real.

962
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:07,720
I know.

963
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:12,109
You know,
I can't believe she's gone.

964
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,710
We need to talk.

965
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,350
Okay, something is happening to us,
and my mind is playing tricks on me.

966
01:11:22,439 --> 01:11:24,210
This morning,
when I was swimming in the pool...

967
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,270
I can't talk, okay?

968
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:28,430
- I have rounds right now.
- Guys,

969
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,350
Wolfson already knows
we're holding something back.

970
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:33,789
The school is going to
investigate her death.

971
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,869
I don't believe it was a suicide.

972
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,989
Maybe she fell.

973
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:39,869
You were there.

974
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,670
What happened?

975
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,229
Uh, she never answered the door.

976
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:46,510
I figured... She went to bed.

977
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,819
Hey, killer party, huh?

978
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,630
You all look like shit.

979
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,119
Hey, listen,

980
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:55,079
if the school finds out
we have been flatlining,

981
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:57,550
we will be expelled.

982
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,149
And you can say goodbye to your future.

983
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,989
Any notes you've taken, destroy them.

984
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,119
I'm gonna get into Courtney's apartment,
get her phone, computer,

985
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,109
anything incriminating.

986
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,149
You know, you were right
this whole time, Ray.

987
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:13,510
We should've listened to you.

988
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,430
Yeah, that's true.

989
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,909
This isn't on you, man.

990
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,149
You should just walk away.

991
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,390
We'll keep your name out of it.

992
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,109
No.

993
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,199
I'm not going anywhere.

994
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:29,909
Whatever happens to all
of you happens to me.

995
01:12:41,159 --> 01:12:42,350
- Yes?
- Hey.

996
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:44,590
Look, bad news.

997
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,350
Ray and I checked her apartment.

998
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:48,750
We found her computer and some notes,

999
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,510
- but not her phone.
- Campus security

1000
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,170
- could have gotten there before you.
- Okay.

1001
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:55,229
Assuming you're right
and it's not a criminal investigation,

1002
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:56,920
then all that stuff stays with her body.

1003
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,069
Meaning you can go down there
and look for it.

1004
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:00,989
Go down where?

1005
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:03,750
Where do you think? The goddamn morgue.

1006
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:53,840
Okay.

1007
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,750
Marlo.

1008
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,420
Marlo.

1009
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:16,800
Marlo?

1010
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:10,760
Cyrus.

1011
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:06,510
Jamie...

1012
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,520
Jamie.

1013
01:20:00,279 --> 01:20:02,630
Like I'm seeing things.

1014
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,430
Something I did.

1015
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,550
It was my fault.

1016
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:11,149
I'm sorry.

1017
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,430
Tessa?

1018
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,550
Tessa, is that really you?

1019
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:30,029
Are you okay?

1020
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,430
What are you?

1021
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,750
Jesus Christ.

1022
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,350
What was that?

1023
01:20:55,399 --> 01:20:57,909
She was talking to someone.

1024
01:20:58,079 --> 01:20:59,909
Someone was there.

1025
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:01,630
You don't know that.

1026
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,470
She could've been hallucinating.

1027
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,310
It didn't sound like that to me.

1028
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:08,510
What if it was Tessa?

1029
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,239
What do you mean?

1030
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:14,670
She saw something. You heard her.

1031
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,199
She said that she did something.

1032
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:18,069
Something was her fault.

1033
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:20,069
What if that's it? What if...

1034
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,949
What if our sins are coming for us?

1035
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:24,300
Sins. That's ridiculous.

1036
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,390
So, what are we gonna do?

1037
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,069
What are we gonna do?

1038
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:30,000
We're gonna tell each other
the goddamn truth.

1039
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:31,949
That's what we're gonna do.

1040
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:33,949
Uh...

1041
01:21:34,359 --> 01:21:36,229
There's a girl I... I used to know.

1042
01:21:37,399 --> 01:21:38,619
Alicia.

1043
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,829
She was a waitress at
my dad's country club.

1044
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,989
Oh, my God.

1045
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:45,310
- You killed her?
- What? No.

1046
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:47,550
No, I did not kill anyone.

1047
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:50,149
I, uh...

1048
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:53,390
I... I...

1049
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,869
I got her pregnant.

1050
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,510
I wanted to help, you know?

1051
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:02,869
Pay for the abortion, be...
Go with her for the procedure.

1052
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,270
Anyway, uh, the... The day came,

1053
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,710
and I... I couldn't deal with it.

1054
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:11,390
I... I drove right past.

1055
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,670
I left her to fend for herself.

1056
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,630
And she showed up in your flatline?

1057
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,630
I wish that was all.

1058
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,710
She showed up last night, too.

1059
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,920
So you're being haunted
by somebody that's alive.

1060
01:22:25,159 --> 01:22:27,470
- What are you talking about?
- This.

1061
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,189
I am talking about this.

1062
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:30,909
Alicia did this to me.

1063
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:32,989
Only it wasn't her.

1064
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:35,909
Just like it wasn't Courtney's sister.

1065
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,319
Then what was it?

1066
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:40,310
Jamie, what?

1067
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,630
I... I don't know.

1068
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,500
Something feeding off
our guilty conscience.

1069
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,399
What do you mean? Like...

1070
01:22:49,399 --> 01:22:51,109
Something demonic?

1071
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,710
Maybe it's using our pasts, our sins.

1072
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:56,750
Wait, wait.

1073
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,149
We're rational people here.

1074
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,949
You could have stabbed yourself.

1075
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:01,949
People on drugs hurt
themselves all the time.

1076
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:03,909
There has to be a logical explanation.

1077
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,229
I was 17.

1078
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:08,949
Her name was Irina Wong,
and she had a higher GPA than I did,

1079
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:10,630
so I hacked her text messages

1080
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,189
and I sent her naked photos
to the whole class.

1081
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:16,229
It destroyed her.

1082
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:18,510
What is the point in
confessing all of this?

1083
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,239
This is clearly just happening here.

1084
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:23,670
- That thing...
- Look, look, Courtney said to me

1085
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,109
she thinks maybe we opened a door.

1086
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,430
Wait, so you knew?

1087
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,229
You and Courtney knew there was
a downside to flatlining,

1088
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:33,010
and... And you still let
me and Marlo go in?

1089
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:34,890
Hey, look, I thought it was
just part of the experience.

1090
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,270
Side effects may include

1091
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:38,310
dry mouth, hallucinations,
existential dread.

1092
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:40,470
I did not know that
the side effects would show up

1093
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,149
and start hunting us down.

1094
01:23:42,279 --> 01:23:45,149
There is a scientific explanation
to all of this.

1095
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:47,470
We're way beyond explanations.

1096
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,989
Okay.

1097
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,350
If Courtney was right,

1098
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,670
whatever's happening to us,

1099
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,909
these hallucinations, these hauntings,
whatever it is,

1100
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,229
it's only gonna get worse.

1101
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,069
Until we figure it out,

1102
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,750
until we figure out what to do,

1103
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,470
whatever killed her
is gonna kill all of us, too.

1104
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:23,189
Note the negative mass effect
secondary to the encephalomalacia.

1105
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:26,590
There are multiple foci of high
T2 and FLAIR signal intensity

1106
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,350
in the supratentorial white matter.

1107
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:31,029
These findings are nonspecific,
but most in keeping with

1108
01:24:31,159 --> 01:24:33,010
chronic microangiopathic changes.

1109
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:34,909
You'll note there's no hydrocephalus.

1110
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,750
There's no brain herniation.
The vessels are well seen.

1111
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,909
You'll note that the gray matter

1112
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:43,390
differentiation is completely maintained.

1113
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:46,789
You little slut.
I can't believe you slept with him.

1114
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,550
Not only are you a hopeless grind,

1115
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,029
but you're an immature,
whiney, crybaby bitch.

1116
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,750
- Okay, stop!
- Excuse me?

1117
01:24:58,199 --> 01:25:00,590
Sorry. Sorry.

1118
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
No.

1119
01:26:04,119 --> 01:26:05,600
No! No! No!

1120
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,039
No!

1121
01:26:08,359 --> 01:26:09,390
No.

1122
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,270
No.

1123
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,710
No.

1124
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,680
No.

1125
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:46,949
Stop!

1126
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:49,029
Stop! No!

1127
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:51,079
No!

1128
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,029
Stop! No!

1129
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,109
Hey.

1130
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:43,909
Hey.

1131
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,829
What are you doing here?

1132
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:50,390
Have you seen Cyrus Gudgeon lately?

1133
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:52,529
If that's supposed to be a joke,

1134
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,229
- it's not funny.
- It's not a joke.

1135
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,909
Then what?

1136
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,390
I pulled the autopsy report.

1137
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,430
It says nothing about metoprolol.

1138
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:07,869
So then I went back to the original
path lab notes of the blood test,

1139
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,989
and there it was.

1140
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:12,500
Metoprolol.

1141
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,239
I'm going inside.

1142
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,029
Why wouldn't the autopsy report
match with the notes, Marlo?

1143
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,710
Marlo?

1144
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,550
Marlo.

1145
01:28:28,119 --> 01:28:31,270
Did you change that autopsy report?

1146
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,670
I had to protect myself.

1147
01:28:36,439 --> 01:28:38,310
Protect yourself? Really?

1148
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:40,390
By making it look like he died from a sting

1149
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:42,029
and not a drug you administered?

1150
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:43,510
I know.

1151
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,310
- I know. It was wrong of me.
- You got to tell someone.

1152
01:28:47,479 --> 01:28:50,390
- I am. I'm telling you.
- The dean, Marlo.

1153
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:52,510
You have to tell the dean
you changed that report.

1154
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,630
Why?

1155
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,750
- What good is that gonna do now?
- Really?

1156
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,229
You don't see it?

1157
01:28:57,319 --> 01:28:58,909
It's your flatline, Cyrus Gudgeon.

1158
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:03,510
You know, it was so nice being with you

1159
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:07,750
and realizing, after all this time,
that you actually like me.

1160
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,750
And now you have to go and spoil it.

1161
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,439
- I am here because I like you.
- Yeah, well, it's easy for you.

1162
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,710
You don't have to sacrifice anything.

1163
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,069
I'm becoming a doctor
with a degree from a top medical school.

1164
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,590
I've worked my whole life for this.

1165
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:25,149
And now, I... I made one mistake.
I mean, admitting it

1166
01:29:25,239 --> 01:29:26,829
is not gonna bring the guy back.

1167
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,350
All it's gonna do is end my career.

1168
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,029
That is the point here,

1169
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,909
your career.

1170
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:44,189
If you were willing to change
an autopsy report, then...

1171
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:46,630
Say it.

1172
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:52,029
Then maybe you shouldn't be a doctor.

1173
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:03,270
Hi. Um, is this Beverly Wong?

1174
01:30:05,079 --> 01:30:07,430
Beverly Wong from East Hadley?

1175
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:09,109
It is?

1176
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:13,510
Do you have a daughter named Irina?

1177
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,189
Hey.

1178
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:20,909
Thanks for coming with me.

1179
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,720
Could you have
rented a smaller car?

1180
01:30:30,039 --> 01:30:32,680
You're sure it's the same Irina?

1181
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,789
Uh...

1182
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:42,470
Irina.

1183
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,750
Yes.

1184
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,279
It's Sophia.

1185
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:48,350
From East Hadley.

1186
01:30:48,439 --> 01:30:50,630
We went to the same high school.

1187
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:54,029
I'm sorry. I know, it... It's...
It's been forever.

1188
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,189
I, um...

1189
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,630
I really needed to talk to you,
so I was hoping we could sit down...

1190
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,189
What is this about?

1191
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:07,989
You never knew this, but...

1192
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,350
I was the one who sent your pictures
to the whole class.

1193
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,640
That was me.

1194
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:24,069
I can't stand myself to think about it.

1195
01:31:24,199 --> 01:31:27,350
Bottom line, it was
an awful thing to do. I know that.

1196
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:29,229
What do you want?

1197
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,520
I'd like you to accept my apology.

1198
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,310
It's not necessary.

1199
01:31:37,399 --> 01:31:40,069
Okay? I've moved on.

1200
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:42,229
Irina... This is important, okay?

1201
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:44,069
I am so sorry.

1202
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:47,909
Irina, please.

1203
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,069
Sophia.

1204
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,229
I forgive you.

1205
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,229
Thank you.

1206
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,029
What'd she say?

1207
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,010
Hey, Marlo, it's Jamie.

1208
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:29,707
Hey.

1209
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,760
Look, we're just
kind of riffing here,

1210
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,560
but maybe you find whoever you've wronged,

1211
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,869
whatever you're feeling guilty about,
and you take responsibility.

1212
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,510
I mean, look, who knows if it'll work?

1213
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,470
But what have we got to lose?

1214
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:06,350
Alicia!

1215
01:33:07,319 --> 01:33:08,319
Alicia.

1216
01:33:08,439 --> 01:33:11,229
Hey. It's... It's me.

1217
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:13,310
It's Jamie.

1218
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:23,600
What are you doing here, Jamie?

1219
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,239
He's your son?

1220
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:35,239
Hey. Hey... I came to apologize.

1221
01:33:35,319 --> 01:33:37,229
For taking off on you.

1222
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:40,430
I... I panicked. I was a coward.

1223
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,829
I should have been there for you.

1224
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,109
But you weren't.

1225
01:33:46,359 --> 01:33:47,680
Look, I...

1226
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,229
I want to make amends.

1227
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:51,869
Do what's right.

1228
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,789
Help... Help you out.

1229
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,710
Whatever you need.

1230
01:33:57,239 --> 01:33:58,560
Alicia.

1231
01:34:00,039 --> 01:34:02,680
Who is that man, Mommy?

1232
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:28,699
What?

1233
01:35:57,079 --> 01:35:58,229
What the hell?

1234
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,560
Sophia?

1235
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,079
I just got a message from Marlo.

1236
01:36:19,159 --> 01:36:21,310
Something's wrong. And her phone is off.

1237
01:36:21,399 --> 01:36:22,880
We need to find her.

1238
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,390
Okay. Uh, where are you?

1239
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,189
I'm... I'm gonna come to you.

1240
01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:27,390
Marlo?

1241
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,880
Marlo!

1242
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,069
She's not here, man.

1243
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:33,430
Wait. Wait!

1244
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:36,590
Marlo?

1245
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,630
Forget it. She's here.

1246
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,270
Come as fast as you can!

1247
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:44,590
I'm nearly there.

1248
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,000
You got to hurry.

1249
01:36:46,119 --> 01:36:47,310
Ray!

1250
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:50,189
She must be down there. Come.

1251
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:51,869
Okay.

1252
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,720
Oh, come on!

1253
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,109
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no!

1254
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:10,079
Oh, my God.
How long has she been under?

1255
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:12,420
It's been over four minutes.

1256
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,880
- BVM?
- Sure.

1257
01:37:15,479 --> 01:37:16,750
Come on. We need oxygen!

1258
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,319
Cyrus. I'm so sorry.

1259
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:32,789
Forgive me.

1260
01:37:34,039 --> 01:37:36,029
Will you please forgive me?

1261
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,069
No pulse.

1262
01:37:43,319 --> 01:37:45,310
Take over the compressions.

1263
01:37:45,399 --> 01:37:47,390
Go, go, go!

1264
01:38:39,399 --> 01:38:40,800
Ahhh!

1265
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,550
It's not working. Shit.

1266
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:17,270
Stop.

1267
01:39:23,159 --> 01:39:24,750
Nothing.

1268
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:06,789
Ray.

1269
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:25,430
Marlo, don't you get it?

1270
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:29,229
I need you to come back.

1271
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:33,840
To me.

1272
01:40:40,279 --> 01:40:42,550
Marlo, Marlo...

1273
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,750
Marlo? Marlo.

1274
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,060
No! No!

1275
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:29,439
Marlo.

1276
01:41:32,039 --> 01:41:34,310
You have to forgive yourself.

1277
01:41:36,359 --> 01:41:37,789
Forgive yourself, Marlo.

1278
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,920
No!

1279
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,909
Charge 360.

1280
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:10,949
Ray?

1281
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:12,710
Okay. Okay.

1282
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,229
Oh, my...

1283
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,949
It's okay. It's okay.

1284
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,229
Hey.

1285
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,680
Here.

1286
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,119
There you go.

1287
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:37,869
Thank you.

1288
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,270
You okay?

1289
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:45,350
Yeah.

1290
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:47,430
I found the girl.

1291
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:52,430
And, uh, a little boy.

1292
01:42:53,239 --> 01:42:54,390
Yeah.

1293
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:57,869
The hell with going to I.A.

1294
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,270
I'm getting a residency right here.

1295
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:02,859
Be near them.

1296
01:43:04,439 --> 01:43:06,430
I'm gonna try.

1297
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,630
Courtney was right.

1298
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,869
It's not enough to apologize.

1299
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,430
We have to face up to what we've done,

1300
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,199
and then forgive ourselves.

1301
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:24,909
Some lines should not be crossed.

1302
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:27,430
We lost a friend.

1303
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,149
We will never be the same.

1304
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:33,229
Where were you?

1305
01:43:33,319 --> 01:43:34,949
I talked to the dean.

1306
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:36,670
How'd it go?

1307
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,470
I'm on probation.

1308
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,989
Did you bring it?

1309
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,399
Here.

1310
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:03,949
Only Courtney knows now.

1311
01:44:15,079 --> 01:44:18,510
Feels so weird just being here
without Courtney.

1312
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:25,029
Anyone want to say something?

1313
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,710
Let's just get hammered.

1314
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,270
Why don't you say something?

1315
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,550
To Courtney.

1316
01:45:12,199 --> 01:45:13,750
To Courtney.

1317
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:32,310
You flipped the page And slipped away.

1318
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,949
Never thought that you were.

1319
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:42,189
Someone to say things that you didn't mean.

1320
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:49,310
You didn't even call to
wish me sweet dreams

1321
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,989
I really thought we made a sweet team.

1322
01:45:54,079 --> 01:45:55,630
Uh-huh.

1323
01:45:56,319 --> 01:45:59,630
But don't cry.

1324
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:04,590
Consider this a lullaby.

1325
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:12,229
Sweet dreams...

1326
01:46:28,199 --> 01:46:30,840
Ticking clocks on the wall.

1327
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:34,550
Waiting for your call.

1328
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,319
Mmm, but that cuckoo bird.

1329
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:43,149
Won't sing at all.

1330
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:47,029
Never thought that you would.

1331
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:52,949
Take everything we had and loved and leave.

1332
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:59,600
You didn't even call to
wish me sweet dreams.

1333
01:47:00,199 --> 01:47:04,670
I really thought we made a sweet team.

1334
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,310
Uh-huh.

1335
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,149
But don't cry.

1336
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:14,670
Can't you see that you're a love of mine?

1337
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,600
Sweet dreams.

1338
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:25,590
Always thought you were the sweetest thing.

1339
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,590
Uh-huh...

1340
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,029
But don't cry.

1341
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,750
Consider this a lullaby.

1342
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:41,149
In sweet dreams.

1343
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,750
Sweet dreams.

1344
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:51,640
Sweet dreams.

1345
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,029
Oh, sweet dreams
