00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,151
Courtney!

3
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,471
<i>I had this sensation
of someone taking my hand, guiding me...</i>

4
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,991
<i>I looked up
and I saw this light.</i>

5
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,031
<i>The giant wall of light. Brighter...</i>

6
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,711
<i>All of a sudden,
I was in a different place.</i>

7
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,871
<i>Pure energy.</i>

8
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,200
<i>I fail to find words
that can describe what I experienced.</i>

9
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,360
<i>At that point,
I had that out-of-body experience.</i>

10
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,433
<i>I remember a feeling
of being sucked backwards,</i>

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,314
<i>like being pulled through water.</i>

12
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,312
<i>I wasn't having thoughts of my own.</i>

13
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,360
<i>Answers, uh, messages coming through me.</i>

14
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,956
<i>Colors were so vivid.
Colors I've never seen before.</i>

15
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,158
<i>Then I was pushed
right back into my body.</i>

16
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,279
<i>I could actually
see my body from above,</i>

17
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,272
<i>like it was lifeless.</i>

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,396
<i>And I was floating up...</i>

19
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,836
<i>Everything
I thought was important was</i>

20
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,470
<i>dwarfed by this sense of love.</i>

21
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,074
<i>And I could feel this pull,</i>

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,234
<i>a force trying to drag me down
this black tunnel.</i>

23
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,396
<i>Where is it taking me?</i>

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,514
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,239
<i>I think I'm going crazy.</i>

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,834
<i>I'm seeing things.</i>

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,640
<i>Something I did.</i>

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,752
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

29
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,399
Hello, Lauren.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,279
How are you feeling?

31
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,313
You had a seizure tonight.

32
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,434
You're at Trinity Emmanuel Medical Center.

33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,993
Lauren,

34
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,072
do you know that your heart stopped?

35
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
You were gone for several minutes,

36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,272
but the trauma team brought you back.

37
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,031
Do you remember any of that?

38
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,358
If you felt anything, if you saw anything?

39
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,397
Did you lose someone, sweetheart?

40
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,280
She's in here.

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,674
We're taking you to Imaging.
You'll be okay.

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,119
One for transfer in five.

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,833
Ready? One, two, three.

44
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,035
Transfer from Holy Cross.

45
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,351
38-year-old construction
worker, fell off a beam.

46
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,352
Persistent coma. GCS 6.

47
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080
- I'll page the resident.
- Mmm-hmm.

48
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,480
Already done. I got this.

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,096
Which one of you is in charge here?

50
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,236
It's my intake.

51
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,352
Actually, I'm the one on duty.

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,797
I got it. I got it. Thank you.

53
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,672
Standard procedure for a GCS 6 admit

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,514
calls for two large-bore IVs
and diazepam on standby.

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,840
Seizure meds won't do any good.

56
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,440
Whatever is wrong is
in his spinal column, not his brain.

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,432
And what medical protocol are you citing?

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,155
The protocol of actually living
in the real world,

59
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,551
where guys with crappy HMOs
go undiagnosed for spinal injuries.

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,234
Actually, he's on seizure meds,

61
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,119
which is the medical protocol
of reading his chart.

62
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,840
Oh, shit. No, no, no.

63
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,475
- Shit.
- Uh, uh...

64
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,630
What is it?

65
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,280
Respiratory failure.

66
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
He might be hemorrhaging.

67
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,154
Page Neurosurgery, call a code,
and get CT on standby.

68
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,276
Students, clear the room.

69
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,393
Hey. What is it? What's wrong?

70
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,278
Did you know that there's
12 pairs of nerves

71
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,192
just within the cranial area?

72
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,795
The, um... The oculomotor,

73
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,520
the trochlear, the glossopharyngeal, and...

74
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,315
Nine others whose names I cannot remember.

75
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,756
I cannot absorb any more terminology.

76
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,398
I have, like...
A rash on my arm. I can't sleep.

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,354
You know, my mother invested

78
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,399
her entire life savings into my education.

79
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,994
Come on.

80
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,231
Come on, that's enough suffering
for one night.

81
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,951
Let's get out of here. Yeah?

82
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,149
It's cold.

83
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,630
We used to be friends, right?

84
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,656
- What is...
- Like, our first year,

85
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,200
when we would sit together at lecture.

86
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,390
- Remember?
- Mmm.

87
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,240
And we'd, like, go running and get coffee.

88
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,039
Hang out. Do stuff.

89
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,554
We're still friends, though.

90
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,757
No, we don't talk.

91
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,674
We just work and... And compete.

92
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,559
Who's the fastest to make
a diagnosis of Bell's palsy?

93
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,200
Quick, what's the seven
side effects of Ativan?

94
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,309
You know, just last week,
a second-year committed suicide.

95
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,876
God, Court, you're gonna be
such a good doctor.

96
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,316
Medicine just, like, comes easy to you.

97
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,234
You know, I think there's a way that
we could spend more time together.

98
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,016
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'm just wondering

99
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,806
if you'd help me on
this little, like,

100
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:38,916
extracurricular project
I've been working on.

101
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,516
Uh... We just...

102
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,671
We have neuro shelf exams
in, like, 10 days.

103
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,911
I don't really feel like I'm gonna make it.

104
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,871
Oh, Once One Takes The Anatomy Final,
Very Good Vacations Are Heavenly.

105
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,637
- What? Oh.
- It's a mnemonic phrase.

106
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,791
You use it to remember
the 12 cranial nerves.

107
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,792
- Yeah.
- Ah. Thank you.

108
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,633
You're welcome.

109
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,274
But, yeah, I'm...
I really would love your help.

110
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,754
Maybe.

111
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,710
Hey.

112
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,838
What's in those?

113
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,640
First one's Mountain Dew
laced with Adderall.

114
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,393
Other's a chaser of espressos.

115
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,035
- Together, it's a liquid heart attack.
- Hey, Jamie.

116
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,594
Oh, Jesus.

117
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,959
Hey.

118
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,793
"Hey, Jamie." Where were you last night?

119
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,477
Your eyes are still dilated.

120
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,917
25-year-old female,
admitted last night.

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,913
Complaining of numbness on left side,
nausea, vomiting.

122
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,710
Anything of note from the physical exam?

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,550
Sees the color red differently between
left and right eye, and oral ulcers.

124
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,434
Sophia, what test should we run?

125
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,635
A lumbar puncture, then MRI of the brain.

126
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,912
Fine, but reverse the order.
Images first, then procedure.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,469
Preliminary diagnosis, Brad.

128
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,040
- Pituitary cyst?
- No.

129
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Jamie.

130
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,070
Uh...

131
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Jackie.

132
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,473
- Um, stroke?
- My God.

133
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,520
You need to do better than this.

134
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
All of you.

135
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,390
What do you think the largest
age demographic is in our society today?

136
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,276
You.

137
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,079
Young adults in their 20s, which means

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,431
that there are at least
1,000 people waiting

139
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,159
to take your spot.

140
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,760
And we are not in the business of
training country club doctors,

141
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,599
nor do we waste our time
on students who think

142
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,832
that they can skate by
doing the least work necessary.

143
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,073
We are here to educate students
who push themselves,

144
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,755
those who are capable
of making new discoveries

145
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,151
and actually move the dial
on human knowledge.

146
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,436
And for those of you who think
that's too much,

147
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,438
then you should leave.

148
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,029
And by that, I mean now.

149
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,359
Marlo, if I were to tell you

150
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,875
that the patient's family
background was Mediterranean,

151
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,351
i.e., Greek or Turkish,
what would the diagnosis be?

152
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,512
I don't think you'll find it
in your notebook.

153
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,995
It's Behcet's disease.

154
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,759
Thank you, Ray.

155
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,514
Moving on.

156
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,757
Why are you working this event?

157
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,197
You're a trust-fund kid.
You sleep on a sailboat.

158
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,357
Yeah, but there's this really hot caterer

159
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,920
- I've been trying to meet.
- Ah.

160
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,994
Look at all these stodgy
old docs with their white wine

161
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,873
and their golf games.

162
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,874
I don't think it's such a bad life.

163
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,616
I don't know about you,

164
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,759
but I'm certainly not gonna spend
the next 40 years doing prostate exams.

165
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,678
No one pays their dues anymore.

166
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,672
Our generation,
it's all about entrepreneurship.

167
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,359
Yeah, so what are you gonna do?

168
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,279
I'm going to LA.

169
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,476
Look at this face.

170
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,756
I'm gonna be the Anderson Cooper
of celebrity medicine.

171
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,719
Okay.

172
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,880
"Oh, hi, Mom. It's my afternoon check-in."

173
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,235
That's funny. Cool. Okay.

174
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,440
You know there's nothing
I can do about her right now.

175
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,633
Did she really move here
just to keep tabs on you?

176
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,995
Mmm-hmm.

177
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,309
Hey, come on, look.

178
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,756
- My station is full.
- Okay.

179
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,035
You're so behind.

180
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,876
Okay, sir, got to give
you a testicular exam.

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,719
- Should just take a minute.
- What? No.

182
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,880
- Excuse the reach.
- Wait a... Wait a minute!

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't enjoy it either.

184
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,198
Just close your eyes and pretend
I'm the candy-stripe girl.

185
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,760
What? Get... Get the hell off of me!

186
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Hold on.

187
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,800
- Candy-stripe girl.
- Whoa, whoa! Get...

188
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,832
- No, wait a minute.
- Stop! What are you doing?

189
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,673
He doesn't need a testicular exam.

190
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,750
He doesn't?

191
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,391
Come near me again, I'm killing you.

192
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,393
You know, I think I got mixed up.

193
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,431
It says here the resident wanted a neural
test for that guy, not a testicular exam.

194
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,831
I can't imagine how I passed
the wrong information to you.

195
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,719
Very funny.

196
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,680
Ray can be a real dick sometimes.
You guys notice that?

197
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,080
I think he's intriguing.

198
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,836
Let's go, people. No lunch break today.

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,799
Every bed in the unit is full,
and we got referrals waiting in the ER.

200
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,599
Get moving on afternoon rounds.

201
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,876
Excuse me.

202
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,473
Do you have plans tonight?

203
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,676
First-years are having a wingding.

204
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,276
Dorm punch and a deejay,
but I'm not above it.

205
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,352
I can't wait for the anesthesia rotation.

206
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,716
Those guys have access to the best drugs.

207
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,510
Looking for this?

208
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,435
Hell yeah.

209
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,712
I found it on my nightstand.

210
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,400
See you later.

211
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,314
These second-years have no tact,

212
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,279
coming up to me like that
in front of my colleague.

213
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,953
Yeah, we're colleagues, aren't we?

214
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,279
I mean, we have fun together.

215
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,036
Yeah, kinda.

216
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,717
Do you want to have fun with me later?

217
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,559
Courtney Holmes, I am mildly surprised

218
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,791
to be having this conversation with you.

219
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,399
But offer accepted.

220
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,837
Midnight, basement, sub level C.

221
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,754
You want
to meet me in the basement?

222
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,317
Sublevel C, underneath the old building.

223
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,312
And take the service elevator,

224
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,676
'cause it doesn't have
surveillance cameras.

225
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,191
Yeah. Good idea.

226
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,589
No.

227
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,270
Jesus!

228
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,919
You're late.

229
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,674
What are we doing down here?

230
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,832
Come on, we don't have much time.

231
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,999
Okay, Courtney, what's going on?

232
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,756
It's past midnight. I should be studying.

233
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,913
We're almost there, okay?

234
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,519
What is all of this?

235
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,480
They put this in five years ago.

236
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,035
In case of a natural
disaster, loss of power.

237
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,353
It's a fully functioning hospital,
and it never gets used.

238
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,000
Whoa.

239
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,039
Um, Court, what exactly are you up to?

240
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,640
- Um...
- Wow.

241
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,990
Two of you.

242
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,320
Jamie, what are you doing here?

243
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,790
Uh, she didn't tell me
about you either, okay?

244
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,031
But, I'm open to a three-way.

245
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,190
Ew. Shut up.

246
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,600
What?

247
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,959
Oh, I like it!

248
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,714
Scanners, cameras, our choice of beds.

249
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,634
- We can be as loud as we want.
- Courtney, what's going on?

250
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,872
I asked for his help, too.
He probably misinterpreted.

251
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,872
Oh. Oh, you mean we're not getting it on?

252
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,474
Wait, what are you talking about?

253
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,598
I've been searching
for the region of the brain

254
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,149
that is responsible
for near-death experiences.

255
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,554
And these are postmortem scans

256
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,871
of patients that have
died in this hospital.

257
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,078
Is there any
circumstance under which

258
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,640
- you'd have sex with me?
- God, stop.

259
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,594
Look, if the brain is just another organ,

260
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,155
why doesn't it just go dark
and... And shut off

261
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,390
at the moment of death?

262
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,240
You know, why the floating?

263
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,390
Why the white light?

264
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
Why the sense of well-being?

265
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,318
I mean, what is that experience?

266
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,111
Is it chemical, or is it something else?

267
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,637
Can we map that process
the way we map a seizure?

268
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,360
What if we could actually document
what happens to us after we die?

269
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,155
What do you mean?

270
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,193
Nothing happens. We're dead.

271
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,239
What if we could prove otherwise?

272
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,033
Can you imagine
the residency offers you would get?

273
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,834
And forget about Dr. Oz.

274
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,470
I mean, you would be the world's
first specialist in the afterlife.

275
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,476
Okay, you got my attention.

276
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,677
Oh, come on. This isn't science.

277
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,296
This is pseudoscience.

278
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,880
Well, maybe. Maybe not.

279
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,271
But the only way to find out
is to see for ourselves.

280
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,837
So I would like you both to stop my heart.

281
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,239
Look, I'll be in the imaging scanner.

282
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,631
It will take real-time pictures
of my brain's hemodynamic activity.

283
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,896
- Um...
- You give it one minute,

284
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,195
and then you bring me back.

285
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,350
Wait, you're serious?

286
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,474
- Stop your heart?
- This is propofol.

287
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,313
Fifty milligrams will knock me out.

288
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,856
I'll be wrapped in a cooling blanket,

289
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,634
bringing my core body temperature
down to 86 degrees.

290
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,312
And once that happens, you administer
a defibrillator shock to stop my heart.

291
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,950
Wait a sec.

292
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,472
Look, I've signed a release.
It's in my bag.

293
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,069
It absolves you both of any responsibility.

294
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,875
Courtney, think about what
you're saying right now.

295
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,640
Hey. Look, if she's insane enough to
try it, who are we to stop her?

296
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,632
- Um...
- Look, I'm young, okay?

297
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,200
I'm in excellent health.

298
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,280
You're both trained in emergency medicine.

299
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,736
So reviving me should be.

300
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,479
Very straightforward.

301
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,157
Look, it's 12:18 now.

302
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,914
I've checked the schedules
for security down here

303
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,509
and cleaning crews.

304
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,116
We have about 45 minutes,
so we should probably get going.

305
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,392
What? This is crazy.
No, count me out of this.

306
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,790
I am not helping you kill yourself.

307
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,239
Well, then you can stand by the door
and make sure nobody comes in.

308
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,376
Okay, remember,
there's a magnet in the scanner,

309
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,198
so no keys or metal in the room.

310
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,078
Look, we've got it.

311
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,231
Wait, Jamie,
what if you can't bring her back?

312
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,791
Then we burn her body, work out our alibi,

313
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,394
and pretend like nothing happened.

314
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,016
And make sure that the scanner's recording,

315
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,839
because if not,
then this whole exercise is pointless.

316
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,200
We're good to go.

317
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,670
Repeat back to me
the resuscitation procedure.

318
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,640
Uh, as soon as you're dead,
I'll run the scanner.

319
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,791
At 60 seconds, I'll start pulling you out

320
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,792
by switching to the heating blanket.

321
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,317
When your core temp's back up
to 93 degrees, I'll start CPR.

322
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,995
Crash cart is standing by
with the epi and the defib.

323
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,232
Wai... Hello? Brain damage.
You'll get brain damage.

324
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,754
Not if you resuscitate me in time.

325
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,112
Brain cells can survive without oxygen
for at least four minutes.

326
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,759
Okay.

327
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,116
Now is the point
where you say it's all a joke.

328
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,157
Okay, put the blanket on me.

329
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,794
Jamie, look at her. Come
on, she's terrified.

330
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,991
It's just my body's
natural survival instincts.

331
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,760
I anticipated this.
I'm trying to block it out.

332
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,951
Okay.

333
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,919
And now I kill you.

334
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,515
Come on, you'll both get expelled.
You'll go to prison.

335
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,114
Only if you blab about it.

336
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,953
Okay. We're really doing this.

337
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,235
Uh...

338
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,599
Uh, see you later.

339
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,193
She's out.

340
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,272
Uh, body temp's dropping.

341
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,560
Okay, look, Jamie,
we can stop right here, okay?

342
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,040
She sleeps it off, wakes up, and we just
pretend that we followed through with it.

343
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,797
If you can't handle this, then look away.

344
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,472
Fine. Yeah, Jamie, I'll just leave!

345
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,036
- Charging 200.
- Come on! This is wrong!

346
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,736
- Weren't you leaving?
- You're murdering somebody!

347
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,434
Yeah, I probably should've
stayed in tonight.

348
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,549
Clear!

349
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,479
Oh, my God.

350
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,076
- She's... She's...
- Dead.

351
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,554
I think.

352
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,431
Counting off 60 seconds.

353
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,758
Do you see any brain activity?

354
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,069
Um...

355
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,896
I mean, something's going on,
I'm not really sure what.

356
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,559
It's recording, isn't it?

357
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,875
Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,272
<i>- Fifty-one, 52...
- Fifty-three...</i>

359
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,351
<i>Fifty-four, 55, 56, 57,</i>

360
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,832
fifty-eight, 59,

361
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,593
- sixty seconds.
- Get her out.

362
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,152
Okay. Okay. Okay.

363
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,316
Blanket's warming.

364
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,776
- What's her temp need to get to again?
- Doesn't matter. Hurry up.

365
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,439
Calm down.

366
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,400
- Charge 200.
- Wait!

367
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,318
Clear!

368
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,154
It's... It's not working.

369
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,435
Of course it isn't.

370
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,273
Paddles are useless without a heart rhythm.

371
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,396
Didn't you listen to her?

372
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,056
Yeah, I was gonna write
down all the steps...

373
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,434
Move! Just move.

374
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,313
Move!

375
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,595
Did we order an MRI on... Hey.

376
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,354
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I...

377
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,193
No, she needs an epi.

378
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,390
Huh?

379
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,676
IV, you moron. God, it's already set up.

380
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,816
Just push the drug into the goddamn line!

381
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,240
Calm down! I got this.

382
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,072
God.

383
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,954
It's not working. Try something else!

384
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,480
There is nothing else.

385
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,114
Well, I...

386
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,750
What the fuck?

387
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,936
It was an experiment.

388
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,696
She had us stop her heart,
and we can't get her back.

389
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,856
- How long has she been out?
- I don't know, a couple of minutes.

390
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,120
Look, I say we try the paddles.

391
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,192
No, no! Wait! Put them down.

392
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,313
I... Stop, stop.

393
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,631
Take over for Sophia
on the chest compressions.

394
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,315
Do them much harder,
get on top of her if it helps.

395
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,792
Sophia, put that cooling blanket on.
She's too warm.

396
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,113
Then charge the defib
all the way to 360 and stand by.

397
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,936
As soon as Jamie and I get you a heartbeat,

398
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,952
however fluttering,
you put those paddles on her

399
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,474
and give her full power.

400
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,199
The blanket. Come on.

401
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,840
Got to push a lot more epi
than what you've been doing.

402
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,158
Don't stop. Don't stop. Keep going.

403
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,350
All right.

404
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,960
Come on, Courtney.

405
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,315
She's hypoxic.

406
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,834
We need to intubate.

407
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,439
All right? Go!

408
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,555
Let's get it off.

409
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,950
Help me.

410
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,800
All right.

411
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,919
Go, go, go, go.

412
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,994
Clear!

413
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,399
Courtney, can you hear me?

414
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,234
You're crazy, you know that?

415
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,916
- You called Ray?
- Were you getting it done?

416
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,800
Does somebody want to fill me in here?

417
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,880
Mmm, it happened very gently.

418
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,036
Like, almost like an untethering.

419
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,789
And... And I... I floated to the ceiling.

420
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,312
I could see my body.
I could see Sophia and Jamie.

421
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,275
And then I could see
the roof of the hospital.

422
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,399
And I've never been up there.

423
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,597
How do you explain that?

424
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,036
I can't explain it.

425
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,439
Are you mad at us?

426
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,912
I don't know what to think

427
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,835
other than you're all pretty stupid.

428
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,912
She's lucky to be alive.

429
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,239
She's alive because of you.

430
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,112
What else happened?

431
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,993
Did you... Did you see a white light?

432
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,589
I wouldn't call it that. It was...

433
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,553
It was more like...

434
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,437
Pure energy.

435
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,470
And honestly,
it was kind of sexual, actually.

436
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,316
It was kind of sexual.

437
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,480
Guys, playback's ready.

438
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,429
Hey. Check this out.

439
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,480
Okay, look. We're counting up
from zero at the moment of death.

440
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,074
Cognitive activity has ceased.

441
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,637
Your heart stopped. No breathing, no pulse.

442
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,717
We're 15 seconds in, and there.

443
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,440
Look at that.

444
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,991
Like a bolt of lightning
in your prefrontal cortex.

445
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,080
We might just be witnessing
the afterlife, people.

446
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,429
Okay.

447
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,273
Who knows what we're looking at?

448
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,635
We're not radiologists.

449
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,440
I mean, it could just be
residual electricity.

450
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,816
- You know, synapses shutting down.
- Okay, we're moving on.

451
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,719
So, you've been dead almost 40 seconds now,

452
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,190
and look.

453
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,150
This area lights up, the hippocampus.

454
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,709
- That's not the hippocampus.
- Uh, of course it is.

455
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,675
That is the ventral tegmental area.

456
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,475
It's the oldest part of the brain,
governs thirst, hunger, love.

457
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,951
Okay, doctors, I'm glad you're having fun.

458
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,400
Got to get out of here.

459
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,550
Hey, Ray, come on.

460
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,994
Hey, no. Just let him go.

461
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,150
<i>Adiós, adiós.</i>

462
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,029
It's over. Her brain's just dark now.

463
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,673
- No.
- Ah-ah. Look at that.

464
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,553
Wait. Amygdala.

465
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,555
Um, that's the amygdala. Rage.

466
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,433
Stress. Emotional memory.

467
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,234
Whatever you were seeing,

468
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,596
this is just before we pulled you out.

469
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,595
Is she okay?

470
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,637
She's been sitting there
for, like, 10 minutes.

471
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,439
- Really?
- Yeah.

472
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,276
What do you think
she's doing out there?

473
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,075
I hope she doesn't try to fly.

474
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,477
If there were brain chemicals released,

475
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,036
the aftereffects could still be
in her bloodstream.

476
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,552
I took LSD once.

477
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,038
I stayed awake for three days.

478
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,874
Oh, shit.

479
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,274
I'm gonna go check on her.

480
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,960
Let's leave.

481
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,110
Ooh. Whoa.

482
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,513
That's high.

483
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,269
Hey.

484
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,673
Are you okay?

485
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,838
I'm gonna bake some bread.

486
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,920
What's with the bread?

487
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,518
Courtney baked it. Six loaves, last night.

488
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,673
She remembered her grandmother's recipe.

489
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,952
Also, she ran 12 miles.

490
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,358
- Twelve miles?
- Let's begin.

491
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,896
We've been ramping up Michael Evergreen
with meds for ten hours,

492
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,752
and his epilepsy hasn't gotten any better.

493
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,194
Now he's developed a skin rash.

494
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,511
It's a mystery. The meds should be working.

495
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,276
Carbamazepine?

496
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
What?

497
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,434
Carbamazepine has an 11% chance
of reacting negatively

498
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,096
with lamotrigine, which is the other drug

499
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,998
- that Michael's on.
- Seriously?

500
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,680
Good catch, Courtney.

501
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,434
Sophia, next case.

502
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,839
Um... Adele Gunther. 44 years old.
Admitted with mild confusion.

503
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,040
Says her sister's an impostor,
she doesn't recognize her.

504
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,431
No history of trauma.
Too young for dementia.

505
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,936
We're gonna send it out
to Psychiatry for...

506
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,996
It's Capgras syndrome.

507
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,475
- Huh?
- Hmm?

508
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,150
- Go on.
- Capgras is an impairment

509
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,277
of the brain's facial recognition center.

510
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,199
And a very rare diagnosis.

511
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,395
V.S. Ramachandran, in his book,
<i>Phantoms of the Brain,</i>

512
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,350
links frontal cortex dichotomies,
like this, to Capgras.

513
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,874
That's not on this year's syllabus.

514
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,318
Optional reading in my first year.

515
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,758
Hmm. Well, that's more like it.

516
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,078
My sister loved this piece.

517
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,314
Drug warnings for carbamazepine
run 20 pages long.

518
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,710
How could she possibly
recall a detail like that?

519
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,713
How is she playing the piano again,
after 12 years?

520
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,873
She's not playing that well.

521
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,792
It's like her brain's been rewired,

522
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,475
accessing everything she's ever learned.

523
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,672
I don't care what happened to her.

524
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,070
This experiment needs to end right now.

525
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,551
I'm not gonna risk everything
for a morbid fascination you guys have.

526
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,599
You think you're all medical pioneers?

527
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,798
You're just a bunch of
rich kids screwing around,

528
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,111
before you become wealthy specialists

529
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,080
with your Ivy League bumper stickers
on your Mercedes.

530
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,914
I was with you until the end.

531
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,720
No one puts bumper stickers on a Mercedes.

532
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,990
I think we're way past parlor tricks here.

533
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,192
Uh, that does it. I'm going next.

534
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,159
- Okay.
- Tonight. I am.

535
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,913
And you're all gonna be there.

536
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,112
It's a good day to die.

537
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,912
No! No!

538
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,590
Jesus Christ.

539
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,634
Whoo!

540
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,000
Is that what I looked like?

541
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,912
Yep. Exactly like that.

542
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,391
- I knew you'd show up.
- How long has he been under?

543
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,597
Uh, 45 seconds.

544
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,718
I thought you'd had it
with all this foolishness.

545
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,600
Jamie asked me to be here.

546
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,633
He wanted me to pull him out.

547
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,456
- Pause compressions.
- One, two, three...

548
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,278
- Still no heartbeat.
- Pushing epi.

549
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,920
- Come on, Jamie, wake up.
- He can't hear you.

550
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,194
Sophia, get ready to intubate.

551
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,397
Oh, okay. Um, I've never done this before,

552
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,896
- so just give me a second...
- Just do it!

553
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,877
Ray, relax. There's no need to panic.

554
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,039
Let's give the epi a second to work.

555
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,559
<i>Jamie...</i>

556
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,353
Clear!

557
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,510
Take it out, take it out.

558
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,112
Hey...

559
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,674
Jesus, Jamie, Jamie.

560
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,432
Whoo! I need a drink.

561
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,716
Shots, shots, shots!

562
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,953
Yeah, come on!

563
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Cheers!

564
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,520
<i>Salud!</i>

565
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,190
What do you guys think about
taking this wall down?

566
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,749
- No, no, no.
- I've always wanted a loft.

567
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,558
Oh! It's hailing! Courtney!

568
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,915
What?

569
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,396
- Oh! Oh!
- Watch it!

570
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,476
- Oh!
- This is crazy.

571
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,552
It's like they're on the same wavelength.

572
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,832
We should bottle flatlining,
sell it as a club drug.

573
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,957
Here. Use this.

574
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,470
Hey, no, no!

575
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,877
Oh, my God.

576
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,000
This has been the strangest
night of my life.

577
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,560
You going next, Ray?

578
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,712
- What, flatlining? No way.
- Uh-huh.

579
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,754
I'd bring you back out.

580
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,674
Maybe.

581
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,600
You have to admit, I was pretty good
with that defibrillator.

582
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,235
You were okay.

583
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,632
Would it kill you to admit that
I might be just as good a doctor as you?

584
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,075
I never said you were not.

585
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,152
Hey, Marlo, your brother's here.

586
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,151
You have no more experience
than the rest of us.

587
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,760
I do.

588
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,752
I was a firefighter in Houston.

589
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,399
Almost six years.

590
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,878
I'm going next.

591
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,472
<i>It... It was super fun.</i>

592
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,480
I was all-powerful.
I had the whole city to myself.

593
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,718
It's weird, isn't it?

594
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,192
I thought there'd be more people, like...

595
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,518
Aren't you supposed to see...

596
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,398
family members who've died, or...

597
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,594
Maybe there's no one there
because it wasn't really our time.

598
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,359
Was it all fun?

599
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,316
What do you mean?

600
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,474
I don't... I mean, like...
Was there anything disturbing or...

601
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,712
Not really.

602
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,914
Why?

603
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,676
Nothing.

604
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,673
She's stabilizing.

605
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,456
I don't understand.
The data shows her starting

606
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,676
into a massive seizure,
and then it just went away.

607
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,873
I gave her Ativan.

608
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,913
On whose authority?

609
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,909
I'm sorry. I'll get approval next time.

610
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,314
You saved her life.

611
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,274
Yes, I did.

612
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,715
I'm Jesus.

613
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,835
Everyone I touch today, I'm gonna heal.

614
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,749
You know, it's funny, because
you and Courtney both flat...

615
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,720
You both flatlined,

616
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,275
yet Courtney has focused on the past.

617
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,399
Memories, recipes.

618
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,032
Whereas you, you're... You're focused
on the present, using your intuition.

619
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,277
What does that have in
common with Courtney?

620
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,400
Sophia, Marlo,
you're needed in the ICU.

621
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,953
It's an awakening.

622
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,000
See you later, Jesus.

623
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,396
- An awakening?
- Yeah.

624
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,400
You here for the abortion?

625
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Huh?

626
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,592
Should Ernesto La Paz get morphine?

627
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,639
Uh...

628
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,714
Oh. Uh, I'll, uh...
I'll check with the resident.

629
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,640
- Sophia?
- Hmm?

630
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,074
Where are you going?

631
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,276
It's 11:30 at night.

632
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,496
You're not on call,
and you don't have anything scheduled.

633
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,159
No, I'm... I'm going to the library.

634
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,536
I'm just gonna do some more studying.

635
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,560
No, no, no, no.

636
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,871
I'm making tea and we're gonna
start reviewing

637
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,800
all of the terminology
for the nervous system.

638
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,315
- But I...
- Now.

639
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,075
Okay.

640
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,270
<i>Where's Sophia?</i>

641
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,517
We need to start. It's already 12:15.

642
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,239
This isn't gonna hurt, is it?

643
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,200
The anesthesia
will take care of that.

644
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,036
Three minutes.

645
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,600
Well, Jamie only did two.

646
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,680
What can I say?

647
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
I'm competitive.

648
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,000
After my three minutes are done,

649
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,595
these are the interventions I want,
in their specific order.

650
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,481
If I don't come out right away,
I want you to intubate me.

651
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,353
Force the oxygen, okay?

652
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,477
Hey, I'm gonna bring you out of it, hmm?

653
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,516
Relax. Enjoy the experience.

654
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,795
Okay, okay.

655
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,920
Infusion's flowing.

656
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,556
She's out. Body temp's 94.

657
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,751
Charging 200.

658
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,676
Clear.

659
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,876
Asystole.

660
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,471
38-year-old male,
stung in the face by a jellyfish.

661
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,080
By a jellyfish.

662
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,273
That's it. Let's get her out.

663
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Epi in.

664
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,633
<i>- Defib!
- Charge to 200.</i>

665
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,996
Clear.

666
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,392
- No pulse.
- Damn it, we just had it.

667
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,556
Juice her again.

668
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,998
I'm gonna push an epi and sodium bicarb.

669
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,239
<i>Defib. She's not stabilizing.</i>

670
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,029
<i>Charge 300.</i>

671
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,510
Clear. Come on.

672
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,116
No pulse.

673
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,477
This is not working. I need to intubate.

674
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,713
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

675
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,120
Calm down. I got this.

676
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,993
<i>360. Clear.</i>

677
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,510
Please.

678
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,989
She's back.

679
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,673
You good? You're all right.

680
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,558
- Yeah.
- There you go.

681
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,197
We're safe. No one ever comes up here.

682
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,672
- It's so beautiful.
- Isn't it?

683
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,309
Her temp's low.

684
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,035
Pulse still racing.

685
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,393
Well, I think three minutes is too long.

686
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,233
Oh, look, she had a bad trip. It happens.

687
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,516
What, you're an expert?

688
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,952
Uh, yeah, more than you.

689
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,352
- Is she okay?
- Where have you been?

690
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,438
- Marlo is fine.
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

691
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,075
I'm going next. Right now.

692
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,160
- Right now?
- Why not?

693
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,920
The cleaning crew is gonna be
down there in like 20 minutes.

694
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,879
- Okay.
- No, we've gone too far.

695
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,196
No more flatlining.

696
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,320
Okay, so you three get to
expand your consciousness

697
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,392
and get academic advantage, but I don't?

698
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,536
Advantage.

699
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,016
You think this makes you better, Sophia?

700
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,110
This makes you dead.

701
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,656
You have much more sense than that.

702
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,151
Ray, if this bothers you so much,
then just walk away.

703
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,280
- Well, maybe I should.
- You're not going anywhere.

704
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,317
You're in this as deep as the rest of us.

705
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,916
Okay, look,
I don't care how dangerous this is.

706
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,560
I need this more than any of you guys.

707
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,473
Ray, it's her decision.

708
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,358
Just like it was each of ours.

709
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,310
If Sophia wants to do this,
then we're doing it tonight.

710
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,194
Just don't stay in too long.

711
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,356
<i>A B-plus on a biology
exam is not acceptable.</i>

712
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,590
<i>Not acceptable.</i>

713
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,070
<i>That will not get you into
a top-10 medical school.</i>

714
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,176
Someone's coming down the elevator.

715
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,320
- What?
- Get her out!

716
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,038
Come on, come on, come on.

717
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,349
Let's go. Let's go!

718
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,840
Pushing an amp of epi.

719
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,269
Where the hell are you going?

720
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,154
Start compressions.

721
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,074
Please, God, bring her back.

722
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,630
Good thinking, Doctor.

723
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,949
I'm sure that's gonna help.

724
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Epi in.

725
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,470
Pause compressions.

726
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,273
Clear.

727
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
Irina.

728
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,318
<i>You are not the only
kid that is out there trying to get in.</i>

729
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,036
Shit.

730
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,319
One, two, three.

731
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,312
- V-tach.
- Charging 360.

732
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,870
Clear.

733
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,720
We got her, we got her.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

734
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,554
We're gonna get you out of here.

735
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,040
You're gonna be okay.

736
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,516
- Come on, you'll be okay. Come here.
- Come on.

737
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,273
- Come on!
- I got her, I got her.

738
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,016
- My jacket, my jacket.
- Got it.

739
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,110
Go, go.

740
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,920
Okay. To the right.

741
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
It's open. Just get in.

742
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,599
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

743
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,915
Should you really be driving?

744
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,200
- Wait!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

745
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,400
Shit! Oh, shit!

746
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,233
You asshole! You left us.

747
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,353
- Are you okay?
- The hell I did.

748
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,750
- I saved your asses.
- Let's go!

749
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,296
- Here they come!
- Hold it right there!

750
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,470
We got to get out of here!

751
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
Hold on!

752
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,034
- Whoa!
- We're going too fast!

753
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,280
Oh, my God.

754
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,670
- Shit!
- Car!

755
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,035
Oh, God!

756
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,075
Oh, watch out!

757
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,470
Oh, my God!

758
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,270
It's not funny.

759
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,876
Whoa!

760
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,910
Here we go.

761
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,360
Whoa!

762
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,669
- Where are we going?
- Oh!

763
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,353
<i>So what, I'm a wild child.</i>

764
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,632
<i>Gunning for love.</i>

765
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,992
<i>It's what makes the world go round.</i>

766
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,480
Hell yeah.

767
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,477
<i>Feel the walls come crashing down.</i>

768
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,880
<i>Ain't no messiah.</i>

769
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,717
<i>Where you at, girl? Where
you, where you at?</i>

770
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,200
<i>Go home or go tough.</i>

771
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,680
<i>Oh</i> -

772
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,396
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.</i>

773
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,352
<i>Bum, bum, Imma bang that drum.</i>

774
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,631
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

775
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,598
<i>I blow up like bubble gum.</i>

776
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,677
<i>Oh.</i>

777
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,991
<i>They keep calling me a wild child.</i>

778
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,879
<i>Oh, they all know that I'm...</i>

779
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,552
<i>When faced with the darkest day.</i>

780
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,558
<i>With an endless night.</i>

781
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,472
<i>When I lay awake.</i>

782
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,239
<i>Only thought of you.</i>

783
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,600
<i>Can pull me through.</i>

784
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,634
<i>All I feel is you.</i>

785
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,916
<i>All I feel is you.</i>

786
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,799
<i>How can it be that.</i>

787
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,833
<i>All I feel is you.</i>

788
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,190
<i>Courtney!</i>

789
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,358
<i>But you've got to show me love.</i>

790
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,879
<i>Give me a reason.</i>

791
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,790
Come.

792
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,550
Look, I don't know if it's the experience
of dying and coming back again,

793
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,109
but I have got a really
intense craving right now.

794
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,113
For what, gelato?

795
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,271
No.

796
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,477
Oh, my God, this is crazy!

797
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,030
Sophia.

798
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,316
Sophia, open this door!

799
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,673
I... I, uh, I think there's
someone at the door.

800
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,679
- Sophia!
- I don't care.

801
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,479
Don't stop.

802
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,438
Sophia, I need you to open this door.

803
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,549
Sophia!

804
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,437
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Manning.

805
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,591
How dare you bring someone
back to my apartment.

806
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,909
I'm moving out.

807
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,000
- What did you say?
- I'm finding my own place.

808
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,640
You will do no such thing.

809
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,552
See, it doesn't matter what you say, Mom.

810
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,238
Whatever threats you make.
I'm 25 years old.

811
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,152
Succeed or fail...

812
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,320
I'm doing it on my own.

813
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,120
Good night.

814
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,792
All right.

815
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,034
Good night.

816
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,469
How are you getting home?

817
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,519
There's a metro stop nearby.

818
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,397
Look, there's something I need to tell you.

819
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,430
It's, um...

820
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,594
It's important.

821
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,640
So, you gonna tell me or what?

822
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,796
I killed someone.

823
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,156
What?

824
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,913
It was two months ago.

825
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,957
It was my ER rotation.

826
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,558
The patient's name was Cyrus Gudgeon.

827
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,597
He was admitted for a jellyfish sting.

828
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,393
Cyrus Gudgeon. Yeah, I remember.
He got stung in the face.

829
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,270
Died of shock, right?

830
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,512
No, he died because of
a mistake that I made.

831
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,117
I gave him epi and Benadryl.

832
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,352
But those two drugs don't cross-react.

833
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,193
He had metoprolol in his system.

834
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,359
He basically suffocated to death.

835
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,078
I... I'd been on duty for, like, 36 hours,

836
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,880
and I must have screwed up
and forgotten to ask him

837
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,997
if he was taking any medications.

838
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,597
He would be alive right now
if it wasn't for my mistake.

839
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,275
Why are you telling me this?

840
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,834
Because I saw him.

841
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,879
Cyrus. I saw him in my flatline.

842
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,873
And it must mean something, right?

843
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,550
Hey, mistakes happen to everybody.

844
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,514
Yeah, but I work so hard every single day.

845
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,872
- I do the right thing.
- I'm sure you do.

846
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,792
- I'm not a bad person.
- No, you're not.

847
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,280
I'm not a bad person. I...

848
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,636
- Everything's gonna be fine, Marlo.
- No, I'm scared.

849
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,359
I'm scared.

850
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,440
Wait, wait, wait.

851
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,757
You... You can't just...

852
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,399
I'm sor... I'm sorry.

853
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,656
Yeah, what am I doing with you?

854
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,240
- I got to go right now. I'm sorry. No...
- No. No, no, no, wait.

855
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,117
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

856
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,296
- Damn, you have so many.
- Just...

857
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,549
Okay, okay.

858
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,836
I got it, I got it.

859
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,793
Courtney!

860
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,672
Help!

861
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,279
Help! Tessa!

862
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,960
Tessa!

863
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,319
Help!

864
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,436
My sister!

865
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,074
Help!

866
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,240
My sister!

867
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,160
- My sister.
- Come on.

868
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,640
No! My sister!

869
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,838
Oh, Tessa! My... Oh. Tessa!

870
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,354
No!

871
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,274
I hope this doesn't become awkward.

872
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,755
Too late.

873
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,594
I can't imagine what you must think of me.

874
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,390
Why?

875
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,191
Well, first I tell you that I'm responsible

876
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,999
for the death of a patient,

877
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,073
and then I go and totally attack you.

878
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,994
I mean, seriously, what...

879
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,953
What do you see in me?

880
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,233
You're really hot.

881
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,274
Shut up.

882
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,594
- I got to go.
- Oh?

883
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,716
Yeah.

884
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,360
It was four months into our first year.

886
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,511
You were assisting at the oncology ward.

887
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,799
A breast cancer patient was there
for her first round of chemo.

888
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,079
She was anxious and scared,
but you sat down and calmed her

889
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,153
by asking about her kids, her job.

890
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,072
You were so kind.

891
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,720
You didn't think anyone was watching,

892
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,555
but I was watching you through the door.

893
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,314
Three hours later, I stopped by,

894
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,876
and you were there checking on her again.

895
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,640
That's what I see in you.

896
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,473
<i>Jamie?</i>

897
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,553
Courtney? What's going on?

898
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,233
I saw my sister.

899
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,760
Wh... What?

900
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,513
At the waterfront.

901
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,794
It was her.

902
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,397
I saw my dead sister.

903
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,199
Where... Where are you?

904
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,317
I'm home.

905
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,073
<i>I don't understand what's happening.</i>

906
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,514
Stay there.

907
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,000
I'm coming over.

908
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,916
<i>I just... I miss my sister.</i>

909
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,554
I should have told you all that

910
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,270
this wasn't about

911
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,080
science or discovery.

912
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,680
I think I'm going crazy.

913
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,193
Like I'm seeing things.

914
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,433
Something I did.

915
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,474
It was my fault.

916
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,833
I'm sorry.

917
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,320
<i>If you're happy.</i>

918
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,153
<i>And you know it, clap your hands.</i>

919
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,360
<i>If you're happy.</i>

920
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,636
<i>And you know it, clap your hands.</i>

921
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,599
If you're happy and you know it.

922
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,632
<i>If you're happy and you know it.</i>

923
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,836
<i>Clap your hands.</i>

924
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,200
<i>If you're happy.</i>

925
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,959
<i>And you know it, tap your toe</i>

926
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,277
Tessa?

927
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,033
<i>If you're happy and you know it.</i>

928
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:05,749
<i>If you're happy and you know it
Then your face will surely show it</i>

929
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,479
Tessa, is that really you?

930
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,120
<i>If you're happy and you
know it, tap your toe.</i>

931
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,320
<i>If you're happy.</i>

932
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,437
<i>And you know it, clap your hands.</i>

933
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,960
<i>If you're happy.</i>

934
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,760
Tessa, are you okay?

935
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,234
Tessa, are you okay?

936
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,357
<i>If you're happy and you know it.</i>

937
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,796
<i>Then your face will surely show it.</i>

938
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,997
<i>If you're happy and you know it.</i>

939
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,196
<i>Clap your hands.</i>

940
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,030
<i>- What are you?
- Courtney!</i>

941
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,271
<i>Courtney.</i>

942
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,856
Let's go!

943
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,360
Let's go!

944
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,676
Hi. An update on room four.

945
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,992
We've given the Lasix bolus,
and the output is limited.

946
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,912
Mmm-hmm.

947
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,159
It's been less than 50 cc's
in the last two hours.

948
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,275
All right.

949
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,032
They found her at
the bottom of a fire escape.

950
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,759
We'll know more after the autopsy,

951
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,797
but right now, it's
unclear whether she fell,

952
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,554
jumped, or God knows what.

953
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,270
I know you all liked her.

954
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,034
And I'm sorry, but for now, I need you

955
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,675
to pick up her patient load
and divide it amongst yourselves.

956
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,319
We still have a hospital to run.

957
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,358
Do any of you know what might
have been going on with her?

958
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,036
Is there something you're not telling me?

959
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,600
All right.

960
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,320
It just doesn't feel real.

961
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,720
I know.

962
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,117
You know,
I can't believe she's gone.

963
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,712
We need to talk.

964
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,352
Okay, something is happening to us,
and my mind is playing tricks on me.

965
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,216
This morning,
when I was swimming in the pool...

966
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,277
I can't talk, okay?

967
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,431
- I have rounds right now.
- Guys,

968
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,354
Wolfson already knows
we're holding something back.

969
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,796
The school is going to
investigate her death.

970
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,872
I don't believe it was a suicide.

971
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,997
Maybe she fell.

972
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,878
You were there.

973
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,679
What happened?

974
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,234
Uh, she never answered the door.

975
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,511
I figured... She went to bed.

976
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,829
Hey, killer party, huh?

977
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,637
You all look like shit.

978
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,120
Hey, listen,

979
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,080
if the school finds out
we have been flatlining,

980
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,555
we will be expelled.

981
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,155
And you can say goodbye to your future.

982
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,994
Any notes you've taken, destroy them.

983
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,120
I'm gonna get into Courtney's apartment,
get her phone, computer,

984
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,112
anything incriminating.

985
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,157
You know, you were right
this whole time, Ray.

986
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,516
We should've listened to you.

987
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,438
Yeah, that's true.

988
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,914
This isn't on you, man.

989
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,152
You should just walk away.

990
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,391
We'll keep your name out of it.

991
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,110
No.

992
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,200
I'm not going anywhere.

993
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,916
Whatever happens to all
of you happens to me.

994
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,355
- Yes?
<i>- Hey.</i>

995
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,591
Look, bad news.

996
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,353
<i>Ray and I checked her apartment.</i>

997
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,750
We found her computer and some notes,

998
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,513
- but not her phone.
- <i>Campus security</i>

999
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,176
- could have gotten there before you.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1000
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,238
<i>Assuming you're right
and it's not a criminal investigation,</i>

1001
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,920
then all that stuff stays with her body.

1002
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,071
Meaning you can go down there
and look for it.

1003
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,992
Go down where?

1004
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,754
Where do you think? The goddamn morgue.

1005
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,840
Okay.

1006
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,750
<i>Marlo.</i>

1007
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,429
<i>Marlo.</i>

1008
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,800
<i>Marlo?</i>

1009
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,760
Cyrus.

1010
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,511
<i>Jamie...</i>

1011
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,520
<i>Jamie.</i>

1012
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,636
<i>Like I'm seeing things.</i>

1013
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,433
<i>Something I did.</i>

1014
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,551
<i>It was my fault.</i>

1015
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,159
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1016
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,432
<i>Tessa?</i>

1017
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,557
<i>Tessa, is that really you?</i>

1018
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,032
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1019
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,439
<i>What are you?</i>

1020
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,752
Jesus Christ.

1021
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,359
What was that?

1022
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,915
She was talking to someone.

1023
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,912
Someone was there.

1024
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,639
You don't know that.

1025
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,479
She could've been hallucinating.

1026
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,313
It didn't sound like that to me.

1027
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,511
What if it was Tessa?

1028
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,240
What do you mean?

1029
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,676
She saw something. You heard her.

1030
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,200
She said that she did something.

1031
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,073
Something was her fault.

1032
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,078
What if that's it? What if...

1033
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,950
What if our sins are coming for us?

1034
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,309
Sins. That's ridiculous.

1035
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,392
So, what are we gonna do?

1036
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:28,074
What are we gonna do?

1037
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,000
We're gonna tell each other
the goddamn truth.

1038
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,958
That's what we're gonna do.

1039
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:33,956
Uh...

1040
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,238
There's a girl I... I used to know.

1041
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:38,629
Alicia.

1042
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,837
She was a waitress at
my dad's country club.

1043
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,990
Oh, my God.

1044
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,311
- You killed her?
- What? No.

1045
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,551
No, I did not kill anyone.

1046
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,156
I, uh...

1047
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,874
I got her pregnant.

1048
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,515
I wanted to help, you know?

1049
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,875
Pay for the abortion, be...
Go with her for the procedure.

1050
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:06,272
Anyway, uh, the... The day came,

1051
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:08,717
and I... I couldn't deal with it.

1052
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,397
I... I drove right past.

1053
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,672
I left her to fend for herself.

1054
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:18,632
And she showed up in your flatline?

1055
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,632
I wish that was all.

1056
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,712
She showed up last night, too.

1057
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,920
So you're being haunted
by somebody that's alive.

1058
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,470
- What are you talking about?
- This.

1059
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,193
I am talking about this.

1060
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,919
Alicia did this to me.

1061
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,997
Only it wasn't her.

1062
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,912
Just like it wasn't Courtney's sister.

1063
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,320
Then what was it?

1064
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,315
Jamie, what?

1065
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,632
I... I don't know.

1066
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,509
Something feeding off
our guilty conscience.

1067
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,400
What do you mean? Like...

1068
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,119
Something demonic?

1069
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,716
Maybe it's using our pasts, our sins.

1070
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,753
Wait, wait.

1071
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,155
We're rational people here.

1072
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:59,959
You could have stabbed yourself.

1073
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,952
People on drugs hurt
themselves all the time.

1074
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,912
There has to be a logical explanation.

1075
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,230
I was 17.

1076
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,956
Her name was Irina Wong,
and she had a higher GPA than I did,

1077
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,633
so I hacked her text messages

1078
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:14,197
and I sent her naked photos
to the whole class.

1079
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,233
It destroyed her.

1080
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,516
What is the point in
confessing all of this?

1081
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,240
This is clearly just happening here.

1082
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,677
- That thing...
- Look, look, Courtney said to me

1083
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,110
she thinks maybe we opened a door.

1084
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,436
Wait, so you knew?

1085
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,234
You and Courtney knew there was
a downside to flatlining,

1086
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,016
and... And you still let
me and Marlo go in?

1087
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,896
Hey, look, I thought it was
just part of the experience.

1088
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,274
Side effects may include

1089
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,312
dry mouth, hallucinations,
existential dread.

1090
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,471
I did not know that
the side effects would show up

1091
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,153
and start hunting us down.

1092
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,159
There is a scientific explanation
to all of this.

1093
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,476
We're way beyond explanations.

1094
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,994
Okay.

1095
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,358
If Courtney was right,

1096
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,678
whatever's happening to us,

1097
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,912
these hallucinations, these hauntings,
whatever it is,

1098
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,231
it's only gonna get worse.

1099
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,074
Until we figure it out,

1100
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,754
until we figure out what to do,

1101
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,476
whatever killed her
is gonna kill all of us, too.

1102
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,194
Note the negative mass effect
secondary to the encephalomalacia.

1103
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,597
There are multiple foci of high
T2 and FLAIR signal intensity

1104
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,359
in the supratentorial white matter.

1105
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,035
These findings are nonspecific,
but most in keeping with

1106
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,016
chronic microangiopathic changes.

1107
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,918
You'll note there's no hydrocephalus.

1108
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,755
There's no brain herniation.
The vessels are well seen.

1109
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,917
You'll note that the gray matter

1110
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,396
differentiation is completely maintained.

1111
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,791
You little slut.
I can't believe you slept with him.

1112
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,559
Not only are you a hopeless grind,

1113
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,031
but you're an immature,
whiney, crybaby bitch.

1114
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,755
- Okay, stop!
- Excuse me?

1115
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,590
Sorry. Sorry.

1116
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
No.

1117
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:05,600
No! No! No!

1118
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,040
No!

1119
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,396
No.

1120
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,274
No.

1121
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:31,716
No.

1122
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,680
No.

1123
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,952
Stop!

1124
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,032
Stop! No!

1125
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,080
No!

1126
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,032
Stop! No!

1127
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,110
Hey.

1128
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:43,910
Hey.

1129
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,836
What are you doing here?

1130
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,397
Have you seen Cyrus Gudgeon lately?

1131
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:52,536
If that's supposed to be a joke,

1132
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,233
- it's not funny.
- It's not a joke.

1133
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:56,914
Then what?

1134
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,390
I pulled the autopsy report.

1135
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,432
It says nothing about metoprolol.

1136
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:07,877
So then I went back to the original
path lab notes of the blood test,

1137
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,992
and there it was.

1138
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,509
Metoprolol.

1139
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,240
I'm going inside.

1140
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,031
Why wouldn't the autopsy report
match with the notes, Marlo?

1141
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,716
Marlo?

1142
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,553
Marlo.

1143
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,272
Did you change that autopsy report?

1144
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,672
I had to protect myself.

1145
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,318
Protect yourself? Really?

1146
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,397
By making it look like he died from a sting

1147
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,039
and not a drug you administered?

1148
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,514
I know.

1149
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,310
- I know. It was wrong of me.
- You got to tell someone.

1150
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,393
- I am. I'm telling you.
- The dean, Marlo.

1151
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,517
You have to tell the dean
you changed that report.

1152
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,636
Why?

1153
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,752
- What good is that gonna do now?
- Really?

1154
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,234
You don't see it?

1155
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,913
It's your flatline, Cyrus Gudgeon.

1156
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:03,512
You know, it was so nice being with you

1157
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:07,759
and realizing, after all this time,
that you actually like me.

1158
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,758
And now you have to go and spoil it.

1159
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,440
- I am here because I like you.
- Yeah, well, it's easy for you.

1160
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:14,716
You don't have to sacrifice anything.

1161
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,074
I'm becoming a doctor
with a degree from a top medical school.

1162
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,590
I've worked my whole life for this.

1163
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,153
And now, I... I made one mistake.
I mean, admitting it

1164
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,833
is not gonna bring the guy back.

1165
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,350
All it's gonna do is end my career.

1166
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,035
That is the point here,

1167
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,918
your career.

1168
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:44,191
If you were willing to change
an autopsy report, then...

1169
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,634
Say it.

1170
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,034
Then maybe you shouldn't be a doctor.

1171
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,277
Hi. Um, is this Beverly Wong?

1172
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,436
Beverly Wong from East Hadley?

1173
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,116
It is?

1174
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:13,517
Do you have a daughter named Irina?

1175
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,195
Hey.

1176
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:20,919
Thanks for coming with me.

1177
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,720
Could you have
rented a smaller car?

1178
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,680
You're sure it's the same Irina?

1179
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,796
Uh...

1180
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,475
Irina.

1181
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,750
Yes.

1182
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,280
It's Sophia.

1183
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,358
From East Hadley.

1184
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,636
We went to the same high school.

1185
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:54,031
I'm sorry. I know, it... It's...
It's been forever.

1186
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:55,196
I, um...

1187
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,630
I really needed to talk to you,
so I was hoping we could sit down...

1188
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,194
What is this about?

1189
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,996
You never knew this, but...

1190
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,358
I was the one who sent your pictures
to the whole class.

1191
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,640
That was me.

1192
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:24,078
I can't stand myself to think about it.

1193
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,352
Bottom line, it was
an awful thing to do. I know that.

1194
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:29,233
What do you want?

1195
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,520
I'd like you to accept my apology.

1196
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,319
It's not necessary.

1197
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,074
Okay? I've moved on.

1198
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,237
Irina... This is important, okay?

1199
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,073
I am so sorry.

1200
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,912
Irina, please.

1201
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,075
Sophia.

1202
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,235
I forgive you.

1203
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,239
Thank you.

1204
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,034
What'd she say?

1205
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,016
<i>Hey, Marlo, it's Jamie.</i>

1206
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:29,708
Hey.

1207
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:31,760
<i>Look, we're just
kind of riffing here,</i>

1208
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,560
but maybe you find whoever you've wronged,

1209
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,878
whatever you're feeling guilty about,
and you take responsibility.

1210
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,519
<i>I mean, look, who knows if it'll work?</i>

1211
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,479
<i>But what have we got to lose?</i>

1212
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,350
Alicia!

1213
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,320
Alicia.

1214
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:11,239
Hey. It's... It's me.

1215
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,312
It's Jamie.

1216
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,600
What are you doing here, Jamie?

1217
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,240
He's your son?

1218
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,240
Hey. Hey... I came to apologize.

1219
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,232
For taking off on you.

1220
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:40,432
I... I panicked. I was a coward.

1221
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,830
I should have been there for you.

1222
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,111
But you weren't.

1223
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,680
Look, I...

1224
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,235
I want to make amends.

1225
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,879
Do what's right.

1226
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,792
Help... Help you out.

1227
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,718
Whatever you need.

1228
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,560
Alicia.

1229
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,680
Who is that man, Mommy?

1230
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:28,709
What?

1231
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,230
What the hell?

1232
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,560
Sophia?

1233
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,080
<i>I just got a message from Marlo.</i>

1234
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:21,311
<i>Something's wrong. And her phone is off.</i>

1235
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,880
We need to find her.

1236
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,394
Okay. Uh, where are you?

1237
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,193
I'm... I'm gonna come to you.

1238
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,396
Marlo?

1239
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:29,880
Marlo!

1240
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,071
<i>She's not here, man.</i>

1241
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:33,435
Wait. Wait!

1242
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:36,590
Marlo?

1243
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,633
Forget it. She's here.

1244
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,279
<i>Come as fast as you can!</i>

1245
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,594
I'm nearly there.

1246
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,000
You got to hurry.

1247
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:47,315
Ray!

1248
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,194
She must be down there. Come.

1249
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,873
Okay.

1250
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,720
Oh, come on!

1251
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,110
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no!

1252
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,080
Oh, my God.
How long has she been under?

1253
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,429
It's been over four minutes.

1254
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,880
Sure.

1255
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,755
Come on. We need oxygen!

1256
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,320
Cyrus. I'm so sorry.

1257
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,794
Forgive me.

1258
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,032
Will you please forgive me?

1259
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,075
No pulse.

1260
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,312
Take over the compressions.

1261
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,392
Go, go, go!

1262
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:40,800
Ahhh!

1263
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,559
It's not working. Shit.

1264
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,270
Stop.

1265
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,753
Nothing.

1266
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,794
Ray.

1267
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:25,434
Marlo, don't you get it?

1268
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,237
I need you to come back.

1269
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:33,840
To me.

1270
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:42,556
<i>Marlo, Marlo...</i>

1271
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,759
<i>Marlo? Marlo.</i>

1272
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:23,069
No! No!

1273
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,440
<i>Marlo.</i>

1274
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:34,316
You have to forgive yourself.

1275
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,794
Forgive yourself, Marlo.

1276
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,920
No!

1277
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,915
Charge 360.

1278
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:10,955
Ray?

1279
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,714
Okay. Okay.

1280
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,234
Oh, my...

1281
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,950
It's okay. It's okay.

1282
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:25,235
Hey.

1283
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,680
Here.

1284
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,120
There you go.

1285
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:37,874
Thank you.

1286
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,275
You okay?

1287
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:45,355
Yeah.

1288
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:47,432
I found the girl.

1289
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,432
And, uh, a little boy.

1290
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:54,390
Yeah.

1291
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,874
The hell with going to I.A.

1292
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,276
I'm getting a residency right here.

1293
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,869
Be near them.

1294
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:06,432
I'm gonna try.

1295
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,637
<i>Courtney was right.</i>

1296
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,871
<i>It's not enough to apologize.</i>

1297
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,435
<i>We have to face up to what we've done,</i>

1298
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,200
<i>and then forgive ourselves.</i>

1299
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:24,914
<i>Some lines should not be crossed.</i>

1300
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,430
<i>We lost a friend.</i>

1301
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,151
<i>We will never be the same.</i>

1302
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:33,235
Where were you?

1303
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:34,959
I talked to the dean.

1304
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,679
How'd it go?

1305
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,479
I'm on probation.

1306
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,991
Did you bring it?

1307
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,400
Here.

1308
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,955
Only Courtney knows now.

1309
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:18,517
Feels so weird just being here
without Courtney.

1310
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,032
Anyone want to say something?

1311
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,718
Let's just get hammered.

1312
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,275
Why don't you say something?

1313
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,553
To Courtney.

1314
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,759
To Courtney.

1315
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:32,318
<i>You flipped the page And slipped away.</i>

1316
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,950
<i>Never thought that you were.</i>

1317
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:42,195
<i>Someone to say things that you didn't mean.</i>

1318
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:49,312
<i>You didn't even call to
wish me sweet dreams</i>

1319
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,992
<i>I really thought we made a sweet team.</i>

1320
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,639
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1321
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,631
<i>But don't cry.</i>

1322
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:04,594
<i>Consider this a lullaby.</i>

1323
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:12,238
<i>Sweet dreams...</i>

1324
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,840
<i>Ticking clocks on the wall.</i>

1325
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:34,553
<i>Waiting for your call.</i>

1326
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,320
<i>Mmm, but that cuckoo bird.</i>

1327
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:43,158
<i>Won't sing at all.</i>

1328
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,032
<i>Never thought that you would.</i>

1329
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:52,958
<i>Take everything we had and loved and leave.</i>

1330
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:59,600
<i>You didn't even call to
wish me sweet dreams.</i>

1331
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:04,672
<i>I really thought we made a sweet team.</i>

1332
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,319
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1333
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,157
<i>But don't cry.</i>

1334
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:14,674
<i>Can't you see that you're a love of mine?</i>

1335
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,600
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

1336
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:25,592
<i>Always thought you were the sweetest thing.</i>

1337
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:27,592
<i>Uh-huh...</i>

1338
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:31,038
<i>But don't cry.</i>

1339
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,755
<i>Consider this a lullaby.</i>

1340
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:41,152
<i>In sweet dreams.</i>

1341
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,759
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

1342
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:51,640
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

1343
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,032
<i>Oh, sweet dreams</i>

1344
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:05,056
