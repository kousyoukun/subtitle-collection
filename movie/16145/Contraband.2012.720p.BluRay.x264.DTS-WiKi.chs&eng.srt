嗯,我想跟你谈几分钟
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.

274
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:16,863
好吧
Okay.

275
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,268
(SIGHS)

276
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,118
我得和Andy上船去解决这件事情
I got to get on the ship with Andy and try to fix this.

277
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,314
你是在开玩笑吗?
Are you fucking kidding?

278
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,856
那我怎么办,让他自己去处理?
What am I going to do, let him go alone?

279
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,414
当然不是.我们想想其他的办法
No, we're going to think of something else.

280
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,527
没有其他办法了,好吗?
There's nothing else to do, okay?

281
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,721
我不得不告诉你
I hate to tell you,

282
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,661
你家那小逼东西已经把我们
but that little dumb fuck has put us

283
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,562
置于最危险的境地了,了解?
in the worst possible position, okay?

284
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,192
如果他们拿不到钱,他们就会来找我们
And if they don't get the money from him, they're coming after us.

285
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,497
你还想我怎么样嘛?
So what else do you want me to do?

286
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,866
我想你怎样?
You know what I don't want to do?

287
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,770
我想等你进笼子里了,我们像以前看你老汉一样去看你
I don't want to fucking visit you in jail like we're visiting your dad,

288
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,069
而且我自己养大我们的孩子
and raising those kids on my own.

289
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,542
这只是我...
So it's my...

290
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,407
我不想跟你吵这些,好吗?
I don't want to fight with you about this, okay?

291
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,450
我知道我在干什么,好吗?
I know what I'm doing, all right?

292
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,486
你能相信我吗?
Will you just trust me?

293
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,178
求你了
Please?

294
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,291
不会有事的
Nothing is going to happen.

295
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,952
好吗?我向你保证
All right? I promise. Mmm.

296
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,035
(INMATES TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

297
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,074
那个混蛋Briggs在这里呆过很多年了
BUD: That shit bag Briggs was here for a couple of years.

298
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,909
他曾经试图用煤渣砸了别人的脑壳
He tried to smash some guy's head in with a cinder block.

299
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,142
听着,我跟Sebastian提过这些
Look, I mentioned this to Sebastian.

300
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,746
我们准备再运一次货
We're doing another run.

301
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,311
你能把我送上你的老船吗?
Can you get me on your old boat?

302
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,588
你是在说Borden号?
You mean the Borden?

303
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,858
记得你小时候,你跟Sebastian,
(CHUCKLES) Remember when you were little, you and Sebastian,

304
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,853
你们冲进MCtier的仓库
you broke into McTier's warehouse,

305
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,093
偷了狂欢节所有的珠宝
stole all that Mardi Gras jewelry,

306
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,499
你还拿个大盒子再次回到那个地方把所有的珠子都偷跑了
and you came back to the house with a great big box of them beads?

307
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,805
你以为那些都是钻石
You thought they were diamonds.

308
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,808
你一脸欢喜,像他妈中了六合彩一样
(LAUGHING) You were grinning like you just won the fucking lottery.

309
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,808
你还说
And you said,

310
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,972
"你不必再在船上工作了"
"You don't have to work on that boat no more."

311
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,314
我总是幻想着那一天
I always think about that.

312
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:16,526
我一生最值得骄傲的一天就是你退出这个行当
The proudest day of my life was when you turned legit,

313
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,331
并且开始了你自己的创业
and you started your own business, and you got out of the life.

314
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:26,797
我知道你也是身不由已
I know you got to do what you got to do.

315
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,766
我明白的
I got it.

316
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,578
家人就是家人
Family is family.

317
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,407
我会把你送上船的
I'll get you on the boat.

318
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,949
但是等你上去了以后
But you get in,

319
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,878
你得想好退路
you got to get back out.

320
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,089
我和Andy坐Borden号去巴拿马
CHRIS: Me and Andy are shipping out to Panama with the Borden.

321
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,146
那老男人的船?
SEBASTIAN: The old man's boat?

322
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,281
是的,他让我们上去了
Yeah, he got us on.

323
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,520
船长怎么办?
What about Captain Camp?

324
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,254
我知道,我知道.不要担心
I know. I know. Don't worry about it.

325
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,622
这是什么东西?
What's this?

326
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,689
什么?
What's what?

327
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,928
每次我来的时候,你都有些新玩意
Every time I come here, you got new shit.

328
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,495
我要把它放在一起,放在我准备好的地方
I'm getting it together, I'm getting the place ready.

329
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,198
这是一张"坏屁股"咖啡桌
It's a bad-ass coffee table.

330
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,139
不是放脚在上面
That is not for shoes.

331
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,371
看来我OUT了,我都忘记什么是"坏屁股"了
I must be out of touch. I don't know what's bad-ass anymore

332
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,469
因为这看起来也只是个很便宜的"屁股"
because this looks cheap-ass.

333
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,071
你快成宅男了
You're turning into The Birdcage.

334
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,138
我是说...
(LAUGHING) I mean...

335
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,752
那么我们在巴拿马认识谁?
So who do we know in Panama?

336
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,413
你准备去看看Ruben吗?
Are you going to go see Ruben?

337
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,084
哥们,不搞毒了
Dude, no drugs.

338
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,517
其他什么活还能有这么高的回报率?
What else has that kind of profit margin?

339
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,252
Edwin在巴拿马
Edwin is in Panama.

340
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,557
现在?
Currency?

341
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,121
我们要带回好鸡巴多吨才值我们的时间
We have to bring back a shit-ton to make it worth our while.

342
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,292
好吧,我们能拿多少拿多少
All right, so I'll bring back a shit-ton.

343
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,633
好吧,1千500万摆四堆,像这么大
Okay, 15 million on four stacks this big.

344
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,331
差不多一辆Mini的大小
It's like the size of a Mini Cooper.

345
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,499
你准备藏在哪里?
Where are you going to hide it?

346
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,007
看我的
That's my problem.

347
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:39,733
我需要Borden号船员名单
I need the Borden's crew manifest.

348
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,840
噢,老天.你在开玩笑吧
Oh, God. You got to be kidding me.

349
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,887
噢,我喜欢Tarik Mortin,他是一个可怕的厨师,但是在船上却还不错
Oh, I like Tarik Mortin. He's a horrible chef, but he's great on runs.

350
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,221
Le Cloud是他妈的酒鬼
Le Cloud's a fucking drunk.

351
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,652
Newlywed?
Newlywed?

352
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,094
他不怎么样,但是我们认识很久了
He's not great on runs, but we've known him a long time.

353
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,767
Olaf非常坚实,我们需要一个人在机房
Olaf's solid, we need somebody in the engine room.

354
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,628
好吧.虽然组不成天龙特工队,但是已经是最好的了
Well, it's no A-Team, but it's the best we can do.

355
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:09,037
开始吧,施展你的才华.去个电话,帮我搞到TWIC卡
Come on, work your magic. Make the call, get me a TWIC card.

356
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,435
你好,小盆友
Hi, sweet pea.

357
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,275
我要你帮我弄一张TWIC卡,名字为Chris Farraday
I need you to push through a TWIC card for Chris Farraday.

358
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,916
我收到你的信息了.都过了3年你才给我打电话?
I got your message. It only took you three years to call me?

359
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,449
你又重操旧业了吗?
Are you back in business?

360
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,582
不,不,不
No, no, no, no, no.

361
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,819
我只是想要一些东西
I need something, though.

362
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,088
记得我们上一次跑船吗?那些搞笑的钱?
Remember our last run? The funny money?

363
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,458
在下周前我就要钱,但是可能会多很多
I need that exact same shit by next week, but a lot more.

364
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,192
四位差不多
Four times as much.

365
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,563
我们还需要一辆足够大的车运送,你看行吗?
And we need a van big enough to transport it, okay?

366
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,298

加油,Mikey!
Come on, Mikey!

368
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:43,832
什么是搞笑的钱?
What's funny money?

369
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,570
啥?没什么.只是老爸工作上的一些事情
Huh? Nothing. That's just work stuff for Dad.

370
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,246
你曾被指控进行间谍活动吗?
Have you ever been convicted of espionage?

371
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,444
只要回答是或者不是,我们很快就好

375
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,424

Senor Lakowski, I'm getting you a 20-foot standard dry.

你希望我们帮你安装好吗?
Would you like us to load it?

380
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,266
不用了,我会找人处理.我只是想要那个箱子
No, I've got somebody to take care of that. I just need the container.

381
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:17,634
好吧,我们给你箱子
Okay, we'll leave the container

382
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,472
你在巴拿马港口等着就好了

真的,好吧
Yeah, no kidding.

406
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,966
别装着你很不喜欢干这件事情一样
Don't act like you don't like this shit.

407
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,609
为什么,很明显吗?
Why, is it that obvious?

408
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,972
我超爱的,但是不要告诉你姐姐哦
I love it, but don't tell your sister.

409
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:14,212
好了,走吧.你等下再睡你的美容觉.我们走
All right, come on. You can get your beauty rest later, let's go.

410
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:15,308
我的手,我的手
My arm, my arm.

411
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:16,782
(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

412
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:25,996
小心
Keep an eye out.

413
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,900
喂,有人来了
(WHISPERS) Hey, someone's coming.

414
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,023
怎么了,Chris?
MAN 1: What's up, Chris?

415
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,358
你好,Chris
MAN 2: Hi, Chris.

416
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,831
Chris
(EXCLAIMS) Chris.

417
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,126
快看这妈逼的
TARIK: Look at this motherfucker.

418
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,202
Olaf.很高兴见到你.
Olaf. Good to see you, man.

419
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,398
怎么样,Tarik?还好吧?
What's up, Tarik? You okay?

420
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,463
啥小啊.
What's up, man?

421
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,841
-你的伙伴都还好吧?都还好吧?-都好,都好
How's your folks? Everybody's good? Good, good.

422
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,206
那是一个很饿的人才吃得下的量
That's a hungry man's appetite.

423
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,336
真他妈好吃
This is real good.

424
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,402
怎么样?伙计
How you doing, buddy?

425
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,448
你他妈的在我船上干什么?
What the fuck are you doing on my ship?

426
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,544
你他妈有没有检查船员名单?
Did you even check the goddamn crew manifest?

427
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,023
你他妈的怎么让Bud Farraday的杂逼些都上了我的船?
How the fuck do you let Bud Farraday's spawn aboard my ship?

428
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,082
DHS把他去掉了的.他是最后加进名单的
DHS cleared him. He was added at the last minute.

429
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,423
好吧,现在我要给他降级
All right, I'm demoting him to ship's boy.

430
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,485
好的,船长
Yes, sir.

431
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,922
你去擦掉脏的地方,并滚出我的视野
CAMP: You scrub dirt and stay the fuck out of my sight.

432
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,865
不然的话,我就把你丢海里去
Otherwise you might have an accident,

433
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,334
让你淹死
and wind up in the drink.

434
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,201
带他去拿地毯清洁机
Show him where the carpet cleaner is.

435
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,502
是,长官
Yes, sir.

436
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,236
噢,我草.地毯清洁机
DANNY: (CHUCKLING) Oh, man, carpet cleaner.

437
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,842
(ALL LAUGHING)

438
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,806
我们走,地毯博士
Let's go, Rug Doctor.

439
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,208
噢,你被提拔了吗?他们给你新的条纹在那
Oh, you got promoted? They gave you some new stripes on there.

440
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,515
我做我的清洁工,你还是船长的爆菊工具
I'll be ship's boy. You're still Captain's bitch boy.

441
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:58,577
是啊,是啊
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,420
(ALARM BEEPING)

(BOTH CHATTERING)

444
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:42,922
好的
Okay.

445
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,331
是,长官
Yes, sir.

446
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,007
都他妈的喝高了,没有一个人在他妈的工作
Everybody's drinking tall boys, and nobody's fucking working.

447
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,331
所以呢?兄弟
TARIK: What's up, man?

448
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:26,671
你准备把船长拉下水还是想怎么办?
Are you bringing the Captain in on this or what?

449
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:27,733
我草.当然不是
Fuck, no.

450
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,374
好吧,我记得在这里跟你的POPS说过同样的话
Well, I remember talking to your pops in this same room.

451
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:34,040
他的回答一样.我们知道是怎么一回事
He said that same shit. We know how that turned out.

452
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,551
你相信我不?
Do you trust me or not?

453
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,813
我相信啊,相信
I do. I do.

454
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,115
那么我们在运什么东西?
So what are we running?

455
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:43,524
航运托盘装载的5000张完整无缺的超级票据
A shipping pallet loaded up with 5,000 uncut sheets of super notes.

456
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,118 
最好的假币才能买得到
Best counterfeit money can buy.

457
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:47,562
只是到底是如何让你觉得我们要带着这么多屎一样的东西?
And just how the hell do you think we're going to stow that much shit?

458
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,791
你担心了吗?伙计?我是说,你们的信心呢?
You worried, buddy? I mean, where is the faith?

459
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:50,925
(CHUCKLING)

460
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,594
你们看哈,我被降级了,现在我又要从头开始了?
What, I lost my stripes? Now I got to start from scratch?

461
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,365
没错,那些逼东西没用
DANNY: Exactly, that shit's void.

462
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,427
没问题
No problem.

463
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,701
来吧,带你去
Come on, I'll show you.

464
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:08,810
你怎么看?
CHRIS: What do you think?

465
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:11,047
看起来不错,Chris.你真他妈是个疯子
Looks good. Chris, you're a crazy fucker.

466
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,919
不错吧? 60立方英尺
Not bad? Huh? Sixty cubic feet.

467
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:17,654
这他妈太大了吧.比60立方英尺还大
No fucking way. No, it's bigger than 60.

468
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,229
我草,是的.兄弟们.这个比60立方英尺还大
Ah, shit! Yeah, man, this is much bigger than 60.

469
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:21,356
有人来了
(WHISPERS) We got company.

470
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,089
快点,快点,快点
Quick, quick, quick!

471
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,791
嘿,Chris,你在做什么?站住
ANDY: Hey, what are you doing? Chris, stop!

472
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,268
Andy,呆在那里别出声
CHRIS: Andy, be quiet in there.

473
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,604
来吧,来吧!
Come on, come on!

474
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,910
你他妈的在那里干什么?
What the hell are you doing in here?

475
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,378
我需要一个铲子.我们注意到那下面好像有
I needed a scraper. We noticed some mold in the lower hull.

476
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:38,881
漂白济对它没有效果的,所以...
The bleach wasn't cutting it, so...

477
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,714
你不能在这里东摸西摸的,快离开这里
Well, you shouldn't be dicking around in here. Get going.

478
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:45,913
我只是想帮你洗干净,长官
I was just trying to keep it clean for you, boss.

479
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,979
嘿,Chris,Chris
(WHISPERING) Hey, Chris! Chris!

480
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,821
把后面抬上来一点!加油.你能行的
CHRIS: Bring it right back up! Come on, you got it!

481
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,517
你能行的.加油!
You got it, come on!

482
00:31:22,815 --> 00:31:24,192
(DANNY GRUNTS)

483
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,387
我不行了
I can't do it.

484
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:27,453
日
TARIK: God damn.

485
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,695
你要来试试吗?
Are you getting on?

486
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,861
不了
No.

487
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,336
你想我把你放到箱子里去吗?
Do you want me to put you back in the box?

488
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,030
这不好笑
That's not funny.

489
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,870
我会在箱子里憋死的
I could have suffocated in that box.

490
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,931
"我真的能..."
"I really could have..."

491
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,900
放过那小孩吧
Leave the kid alone, man.

492
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:42,309
接下来你想怎样?
How are you going to pull this shit off?

493
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,412
他们提供300个左右的伪装箱.
We're delivering 300 or so containers. Yeah.

494
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:48,418
我们拿500个或者更多.我们不准备进港
We're picking up 500 or more. We're not going to be in port that long.

495
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:51,546
因此,我们要去Chorrillo,见Edwin,完成这庄买卖
So we got to drive out to Chorrillo, see Edwin, load up the bills,

496
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,419
然后我们在最繁忙时候开车回到船上
and then drive back to the boat during rush hour.

497
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,958
时间有点紧,但是我们行的
It's going to be tight, but we're going to be good.

498
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,584
时间太紧了,我们得抓紧时间
It's going to be too tight. We're cutting it close.

499
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,458
可能时间还是不够
Might not have enough time.

500
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,988
我们想办法弄到更多时间
We'll buy more time.

501
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,692
可调螺旋桨
Controllable pitch propeller.

502
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,099
哦,明白了,螺旋桨
Oh, yeah. Pitch propeller.

503
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,465
你能掐断原油供应吗?
Can you drain the oil supply?

504
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,466
这样液压室就不能正常工作了
The hydraulic chamber won't work.

505
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,034
这才是重点,傻逼
That's the point, stupid ass.

506
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:11,966
听着
CHRIS: Look.

507
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,472
在锁被拖的时候,我们能做到这一点
We can do it while being towed through the locks.

508
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,773
这能为我们争取很多时间
It will buy us a couple of hours.

509
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,677
-好吗? - 我不知道
Okay? I don't know.

510
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,272
我讨厌在船上工作
I hate when we fuck with the boat.

511
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:20,612
你说什么?
What?

512
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:23,153
我说,我讨厌在船上工作
I said, I hate when we fuck with the boat.

513
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,209
放轻松,大熊
CHRIS: Take it easy, big bear.

514
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,482
Olaf,去他妈的船
Olaf, fuck with the boat.

515
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,423
放轻松
Take it easy. Easy.

516
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,515
啥小啊?
What the fuck?

517
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,425
Tarik.那妈的会吃了你的
Tarik. That motherfucker will eat you.

518
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,525
好吧,出来吧
Okay, out you come.

519
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:43,039
-你们想为我拿这些东西吗?-我们必须拿吗?
Do you want to get any of these for me? Do we have to?

520
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,096
好的,妈
Yes, Mom.

521
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,335
是吗?真好
Yeah? Okay.

522
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,202
(CONTINUE CHATTERING)

523
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:29,682
你好?
KATE: Hello?

524
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,382
我能帮你什么吗?
Can I help you?

525
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,350
你真漂亮
You're pretty.

526
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,688
你不想玩玩吗?
Do you want to play?

527
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:40,990
好吧.再见,混蛋
Okay. Bye, asshole.

528
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:42,955
(SCREAMS)

529
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:46,500
还钱,你欠我的
BRIGGS: Pay the money, just like you owe me.

530
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,901
你看娘的看什么看
DESMOND: What the fuck are you all looking at?

531
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,268
耶,你喜欢这样是吧?
BRIGGS: Yeah, you like that?

532
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,363
把你他妈的手拿开
KATE: Get your fucking hands off me!

533
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,577
来吧,把刀子放下.把刀子放下
BRIGGS: Come on, put the knife down. Put the knife down.

534
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,308
把刀子放下
Put the knife down.

535
00:33:58,437 --> 00:33:59,507
放开我妈妈
Leave my mommy alone!

536
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:02,211
他妈的滚远点,别他妈的乱动
Get the fuck back over there! Sit your fucking ass down!

537
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,151
没关系的,我只是玩玩而已
It's okay, I'm just playing, now.

538
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,779
我只是玩玩
(SOBBING) I'm just playing.

539
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,118
喂,不要哭嘛
Yeah, don't cry.

540
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:10,287
你以前见到过枪吗?你想要吗?
DESMOND: You seen a gun before? You want it?

541
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,521
下周我再来的时候就不仅仅是玩玩了 
There ain't going to be no playing when I come back next week.

542
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,188
你可以给你老公说明这一点

他们想让我们去检查一下最后上来的箱子
They want us to take a look at some containers that were loaded late.

966
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:45,164
好的.去吧.
All right, let's go.

967
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,230

Call in the Second.

968
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:12,300
我们走,Danny. 我们走
Let's go, Danny. Let's go.

969
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:13,460
我们要找的是哪个
CAMP: Where are we looking, Chief?

970
01:03:13,524 --> 01:03:15,902
那上面的箱子,船长
The container right up here, Captain.

971
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:23,770

CHIEF MATE: 812504.

972
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:25,711
812...

973
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:27,173
对不起,船长
Sorry, Captain.

974
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,212
下一个.
Next.

975
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:37,848
我日
DANNY: Oh, shit.

976
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,529
我要去检查一下暧气管,等等,等等.
MAN: I'm gonna check the heating coils... Wait, wait!

977
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:42,859
我需要几分钟时间
...I'm gonna need a couple of minutes.

978
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,024
快点,我们走.
Come on, let's go.

979
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,900

CHIEF MATE: 2727.

980
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:50,199

812729.

981
01:03:52,763 --> 01:03:54,003

(RATS SQUEAKING)

982
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:55,134
我日.老鼠
CHIEF MATE: Oh! Shit, rats!

983
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,302
快关上!
Shut it!

984
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:58,607
小心手
Watch your hand.

985
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:02,746

Yo, yo, yo!

986
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:05,480
我们下水道漏了,打给Brody好吗?
We got a sewage leak. Call Brody, all right?

987
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,090
好的,我们走
All right, let's go.

988
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,561

SECOND MATE: We got two more containers up here.

989
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:39,416

Nathan-812552,

990
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:41,956

812553.

991
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,753
就是这个,打开它.
CHIEF MATE: That's it, open it.

992
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:05,004

SECOND MATE: 525524.

993
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:08,540
这就是最向上船的箱子
That's the last container that was boarded.

994
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:10,846
继续 
Go on.

995
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:19,623
有什么发现吗?
Anything?

996
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,887
没有,长官,闻起来像刚被清洗过一样
No, sir. Smells like it was just cleaned.

997
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:24,999
好吧.封上.
All right, seal it up. (CHUCKLES)

998
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,801
等我们到家的时候,海关会拆了它的.
Customs will take it apart when we get back home.

999
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:45,645
我得告诉你
I need to tell you...

1000
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:47,689
你他妈脑子有毛病吗？
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1001
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,382
你他妈疯了吗？
Are you fucking crazy?

1002
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,322
钱去哪了,钱在哪？
Where's the money? Where is it?

1003
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:52,826
钱不见了,我很需要这笔钱.
It's gone! I had to use it.

1004
01:05:52,883 --> 01:05:54,692
什么？钱哪?
It's what? Where's the money?

1005
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:56,196
你想干什么？
What are you trying to...

1006
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:57,491
你刚才对我说神马？
What did you just say to me?

1007
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:58,589
我真的很需要这笔钱.
I had to use it.

1008
01:05:58,655 --> 01:05:59,656
什么？
You what?

1009
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,725
我需要钱！
I had to use it.

1010
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:03,996
钱在天花板上.
It's in the ceiling.

1011
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:07,071
操,狗日的....
No, you fucking...

1012
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:14,779
 你他妈脑残啊？
How fucking stupid are you?

1013
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:17,750
我他妈冒着失去自由的危险来帮你
I came out here to help you, to risk my fucking freedom

1014
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:20,845
为了这个还不顾有我的妻子和孩子的安危
and my wife and my children for this?

1015
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:22,754
妈的
Motherfucker.

1016
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:26,554
我到底该怎么处理？
What the fuck am I supposed to do with all that?

1017
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:28,061
你必须给老子装傻
You got to be the dumbest motherfucker...

1018
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:30,098
我说他要杀了Michael.
He said he was going to kill Michael.

1019
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:32,358
神马？
CHRIS: What?

1020
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:34,299
你了新一条消息.
VOICEMAIL: You have one saved message.

1021
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:37,133
嗨,小混蛋,我看到你姐姐的孩子在足球.
BRIGGS: Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching your sister's kid play soccer.

1022
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:38,365
你不用打给我了.
You don't call me back,

1023
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,806
老子要马上去给他脑袋上一枪.
I'm gonna walk out on that field and put a bullet in his head.

1024
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,077
（很重的呼吸声）
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1025
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,417
去拿包.
Get the bag.

1026
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,382
你还好吧？
Are you all right? Yeah.

1027
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:55,445
你怎么样,还好吧？
You all right? You all right?

1028
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,582
嗯,我没事.
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

1029
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,887
对不起,冷静点,冷静点.
I'm sorry. Calm down, calm down.

1030
01:07:12,162 --> 01:07:13,334
（电话）
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

1031
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:18,275
嗨.
Chris. CHRIS: Hey.

1032
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:19,541
一切都还好吗？孩子们没事吧？
Everything okay? Boys all right?

1033
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,447
嗯,他们正在睡觉呢.
Yeah, they're sleeping.

1034
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:24,076
出什么事了,都还好吗,Andy没事吧？
What's up? Is everything okay? Is Andy okay?

1035
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:27,247
嗯.不用担心.ebastian在哪吗？
Yeah. Don't worry about it. Is Sebastian there?

1036
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,425
嗯,他在.要不要我叫他过来？
KATE: Yeah, he is. Do you want me to get him for you?

1037
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,788
不用了.
No, no.

1038
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:34,124
对,没事.回去睡觉吧.
No, it's okay. Go back to sleep.

1039
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:35,424
我明天早上叫你.
I'll call you in the morning.

1040
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:37,294
嗯.我爱你.
KATE: Okay. I love you.

1041
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:39,197
我也爱你.
I love you, too.

1042
01:07:58,442 --> 01:07:59,477
Chris?
SEBASTIAN: Chris?

1043
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,148
Chris,我刚刚一直在叫你,出什么事了？
Chris, I've been trying to call you. What's going on?

1044
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:03,418
Andy收拾点东西.
Andy picked something up.

1045
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,584
真的？我以为不用的,
Really? I thought we weren't doing that.

1046
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:06,650
我没得选择.
I didn't have a choice.

1047
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:09,492
太好了Andy主动了一点哈.
Thank God for Andy taking the initiative, though, huh?

1048
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:10,964
不幸的是 我没带过来.
Too bad I'm not bringing it in.

1049
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:13,757
其实我想把它丢到海里.
I'm thinking of dumping it in the sea, actually.

1050
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:15,761
你为什么要那么做呢？
Why would you do that?

1051
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:17,897
那样我们都会解脱的.
Then we would all be fucked!

1052
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:19,564
自信点,没问题的.
Take it on faith.

1053
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,078
我要跟你谈谈.
I need to talk to you.

1054
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:41,726
出什么事了吗？
SEBASTIAN: Is something wrong?

1055
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,631
我告诉过你一有新消息就给你电话.
I told you I would call you with an update.

1056
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:49,394
你还几天时间
You've got a few more days left

1057
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,902
在老子把你脑袋拧下来塞你屁眼上之前
before I cut your head off and stick it up your ass.

1058
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:55,534
那你还问我“出什么事了”吗？
And you're asking me, "Is there anything wrong?"

1059
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,044
好吧,我有些东西要进来
Well, I got something coming in.

1060
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,617
听起来你不是很确定
You don't sound so sure.

1061
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:07,211
我确定.它进来了
I'm sure. It's coming in.


1062
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:10,290
这样可不好,Abney
Flying solo ain't for sidekicks, Abney.

1063
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:14,762
我他妈警告过你的
I fucking warned you.

1064
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:17,895
当你第一次来找我帮忙的时候
When you first came to me for help

1065
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:19,956
为了你那小生意
in keeping your little business afloat,

1066
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:22,333
我他妈警告过你的
I fucking warned you.

1067
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:25,530
我说:你得了解你自己的极限
I said, "You've got to know your limitations."

1068
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,469
别超过你他妈的极限了
"Don't live beyond your fucking means!"

1069
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:33,940
我平常都不干这些2B事情的
I don't normally do this fucking shit.

1070
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:37,518
告诉你如果不付钱会是什么样的后果
Telling you what's going to happen when you don't pay.

1071
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:40,487
什么是他妈的重点?你知道规则的,对吗?
What's the fucking point? You know the rules, right?

1072
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,751
嗯
Right.

1073
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:53,295
你自求多福
You take care, Abney.

1074
01:09:58,228 --> 01:09:59,298

(DOOR SLAMS)

1075
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,319

Jack, neat.

1076
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:55,490
有些人没有戒掉酒哦
Somebody's off the wagon.

1077
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:04,136
我想你去看看Kate
I want you to go see Kate.

1078
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:07,039
兄弟,我以为她也是你的家人
Man, I thought she was your family.

1079
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:10,273
你知道的,如果你想草他老婆,你去草就是了.
You know, if you want to fuck his wife, you fuck his wife.

1080
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:12,609
但是,别浪费老子的时间在这里扮英雄
But don't waste my time so you can play hero.

1081
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:14,478
Chris在那里搞砸了
Chris is falling apart out there.

1082
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:16,278
他要丢掉那批货了
He's going to dump the package.

1083
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,147
别碰她,只要引她注意就好了
Don't touch her. Just get her attention.

1084
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,150
好吧
All right.

1085
01:11:33,023 --> 01:11:34,161
好吧
Yeah.

1086
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:56,184
哇噻
Oh, man.

1087
01:11:57,714 --> 01:11:58,784
你觉得这样有用吗?
Do you think it's going to work?

1088
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:00,725
肯定有用的,你觉得是这样?
It's going to work. You think so?

1089
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:02,454
你学校念的科学吗?Tarik
Did you take science in school, Tarik?

1090
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:03,622
嗯.
Yeah.

1091
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:06,463
那你应该知道盐在水里会溶解吧,傻逼
Then you should know salt dissolves in water, bitch.

1092
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:08,631
你很快就要走吗?
Are you leaving soon?

1093
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,532
嗯,Sebastian马上就把孩子送来
Yeah, Sebastian is dropping the boys off.

1094
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:11,967
我们要回家了
We're going home.

1095
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:14,764
噢,是哦,Chris要回来了.
Oh, that's right. Chris is coming home.

1096
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:16,066
嗯
Yeah.

1097
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:17,634
这就是你早上一直在笑的原因吧?
So, you'll be all smiles in the morning?

1098
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,203
我希望如此
I hope so.

1099
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:21,773
你先走吧,我来弄这些
You get out of here, I got it.

1100
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:23,144
晚安
Good night.

1101
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:26,815
晚安.晚安,宝贝.
Good night. Good night, baby.

1102
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:27,980
我会锁好门的.
I'll lock the door.

1103
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:29,079

我的朋友将来这里,他会踢你的...

我要完全他妈的明确一下.
I'm going to be perfectly fucking clear.

1108
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,474
你打电话给你老公,叫他不要将它扔进水中！
You call your husband and you tell him not to dump it in the water!

1109
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:26,173
你告诉他,你、Michael和Eddie的生死取决于他.
You tell him that you, Michael and Eddie are all depending on him.

1110
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,338

Do you understand me?

1115
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:03,308
嘿.
Hey.

1116
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:11,917
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

1117
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:15,155
宝贝,我要你和我一起进卡车.
Honey, I want you to get in the truck with me.

1118
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:17,027
孩子们在里面,好不？
The kids are inside, all right?

1119
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,827
你闻起来就像个酒桶.
You smell like alcohol.

1120
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:21,368
是的,我喝了点酒.
Yeah, I had a drink.

1121
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:23,904
你正在醉酒驾车？你他妈的开玩笑吧？
You're driving my kids around drunk? Are you fucking kidding me?

1122
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:25,165
放松,他和你说了什么？
Relax. What did he say to you?

1123
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:32,103
来吧,出来吧.我们将去我的车,走吧.
Come on, get out. We're going in my car. Let's go.

1124
01:14:32,202 --> 01:14:34,512
SEBASTIAN:Kate!孩子们,回我的车.
SEBASTIAN: Kate! Guys, get back in the car.

1125
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:36,912
Kate,你在干什么？
Kate, what are you doing?

1126
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:41,511
Kate！Kate！进我的卡车.
Kate! Kate! Get in the truck.

1127
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:43,346

Kate电话中：他知道孩子们的名字.
KATE ON PHONE: He knew the kids' names.

Hold on, you're breaking up, okay? Let me go outside.

1130
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,559
哦,他妈的.
Oh, fuck.

1131
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:52,964
这里的手机服务很烂,别挂,我正在跑出去.
Cell service sucks here on the river. Hold on, I'm going outside.

1132
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:56,295
在吗？他叫我告诉你....
Hello? He told me to tell you...

1133
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:58,134
不,别挂.我听不清.
No, hold on. I can't hear you.

1134
01:14:58,194 --> 01:14:59,867
他叫我告诉你不要把它扔进...

1137
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,274
谁？那个来我房子的混蛋！
Who? The asshole who came to the house!

1138
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:05,602
谁他妈的告诉他？
Who the fuck told him?

1139
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:06,703
什么？
What?

1140
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,305
孩子们都没事吧？
(DOOR RATTLES) Are the boys okay?

1141
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:09,909
他们在这里,我们正在Jeanie家.
They're here. We're at Jeanie's.

1142
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:11,782

01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:24,292
嘿,咋么样？
Hey, how did it go?

1148
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:26,230
我们登上了前窗.
We boarded up the front window.

1149
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:29,236
警察做了一份报告,他们正在寻找这个家伙.
The cops took a report. They're looking for the guy.

1150
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:30,327

他们想和你谈话.
They want to talk to you.

他们想和你现在谈一下.
They want to talk to you now.

1154

但是我们没有货.我们只有去Sebastian那去得到我们的货.
But we have no stuff. I've got to go to Sebastian's to get our stuff.

1155
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:44,816
你介意我看一下孩子们吗？
Would you mind watching the boys for a second?

1156
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,217
瞧你的前额.
Look at your forehead.

1157
01:15:46,276 --> 01:15:48,256
你确定不需要送你去医院？
Are you sure you don't need me to take you to the hospital?

1158
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:51,622
不用,这只是...它比实际看起来更糟糕.
No, it's just... It looks worse than it is.

1159
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:54,955
它只是个伤口.就像一个挫伤,你知道吗？
It just hurts. Like a bruise, you know?

1160
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:59,425
我觉得我现在不得不离开,你知道我的意思？
I think I should go now before I can't. You know what I mean?

1161
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,026
我过一会来看你.
I'll see you in a little bit.

1162

拜拜,妈妈,我爱你.

1163
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:03,626

Chris, I'm not fucking lying to you. I didn't say shit.

1170
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:48,346
你从哪里得到这些药品？
Where did you get the drugs?

1171
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:50,678
从一个叫Ruben的家伙.
From a guy called Ruben.

1172
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:56,216
KATE: Sebastian?

I mean, the boat's not coming in for, like, I don't know, tomorrow.

Chris叫我来照顾你.

没有.我没有做任何事.
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

I'm trying to give my friend a fucking kiss. What's your problem?

1192
