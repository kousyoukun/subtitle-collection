a world-class smuggler here.

You were fucking

314
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,808
I know you got to do
what you got to do.

315
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,768
I got it.

316
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,565
Family is family.

317
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,401
I'll get you on the boat.

318
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,945
But you get in,

319
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,866
you got to get back out.

320
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,077
CHRIS: Me and Andy are
shipping out to Panama
with the Borden.

321
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,162
SEBASTIAN:
The old man's boat?

322
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,246
Yeah, he got us on.

323
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,497
What about Captain Camp?

324
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:51,249
I know. I know.
Don't worry about it.

325
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,587
What's this?

326
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,671
What's what?

327
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,924
Every time I come here,
you got new shit.

328
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,509
I'm getting it together,
I'm getting the place ready.

329
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,178
It's a bad-ass coffee table.

330
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,096
That is not for shoes.

331
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,349
I must be out of touch.
I don't know
what's bad-ass anymore

332
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,434
because this looks
cheap-ass.

333
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,061
You're turning
into The Birdcage.

334
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,145
(LAUGHING)
I mean...

335
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,732
So who do we know
in Panama?

336
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,401
Are you going to
go see Ruben?

337
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,070
Dude, no drugs.

338
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,530
What else has that
kind of profit margin?

339
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,240
Edwin is in Panama.

340
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,533
Currency?

341
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,119
We have to bring back
a shit-ton to make it
worth our while.

342
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,288
All right, so I'll
bring back a shit-ton.

343
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:33,625
Okay, 15 million on
four stacks this big.

344
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,293
It's like the size
of a Mini Cooper.

345
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:36,461
Where are you
going to hide it?

346
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,004
That's my problem.

347
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,714
I need the Borden's
crew manifest.

348
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,846
Oh, God. You got to be
kidding me.

349
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,893
Oh, I like Tarik Mortin.
He's a horrible chef,
but he's great on runs.

350
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,229
Le Cloud's a fucking drunk.

351
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,648
Newlywed?

352
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,067
He's not great on runs,
but we've known him
a long time.

353
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,737
Olaf's solid,
we need somebody
in the engine room.

354
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,615
Well, it's no A-Team,
but it's the best we can do.

355
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,035
Come on, work your magic.
Make the call,
get me a TWIC card.

356
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,417
Hi, sweet pea.

357
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,253
I need you to
push through a TWIC card
for Chris Farraday.

358
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,926
I got your message.
It only took you
three years to call me?

359
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,428
Are you back in business?

360
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,554
No, no, no, no, no.

361
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:28,805
I need something, though.

362
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,099
Remember our last run?
The funny money?

363
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,436
I need that exact
same shit by next week,
but a lot more.

364
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,187
Four times as much.

365
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,564
And we need a van big enough
to transport it, okay?

366
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,275
Okay. I'll be here.

367
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,610
Come on, Mikey!

368
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,820
What's funny money?

369
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,573
Huh? Nothing.
That's just
work stuff for Dad.

370
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,243
Have you ever been
convicted of espionage?

371
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,413
Just answer yes or no,
we'll get through this
really quickly.

372
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,539
No.

373
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,127
Sedition, or conspiracy
to commit espionage,
sedition, treason?

374
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:00,462
Together?

375
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,382
I received your
shipping application, Mr...

376
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,633
Lakowski.

377
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,594
Mr. Lakowski.

378
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:11,931
Señor Lakowski,
I'm getting you
a 20-foot standard dry.

379
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,558
Would you like us to load it?

380
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,269
No, I've got somebody
to take care of that.
I just need the container.

381
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,604
Okay, we'll leave
the container

382
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,439
standing by for you
at the port of Panama.

383
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,732
And what are you shipping?

384
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,983
A van.

385
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,003
Here you go.

386
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,384
It takes money
to make money, baby.

387
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,225
Thank you.

388

Don't sink, Daddy.

389
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,528
Okay, buddy.

390
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,447
You're going to
miss my playoff game.

391
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,699
I know. I'm sorry.

392
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,327
Your mom is going
to take lots of
pictures for me, okay?

393
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,621
You guys are in charge
till I get back.

Just come home, okay?

396
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,592
Thank you for
doing this, Chris.

397
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,344
I love you.
Love you, too.

398
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,221
It's going to be okay.

Get the trunk.

401
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,939
Get that Captain's
carpet cleaner
up to the bridge.

Don't act like
you don't like this shit.

407
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,605
Why, is it that obvious?

408
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,982
I love it, but don't
tell your sister.

409
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,197
All right, come on.
You can get your beauty

you doing on my ship?

Did you even check
the goddamn crew manifest?

let Bud Farraday's
spawn aboard my ship?

have an accident,

say to me?

Really? I thought
we weren't doing that.

I didn't have a choice.

Thank God for Andy
taking the initiative,
though, huh?

Too bad I'm not
bringing it in.

I'm thinking of dumping
it in the sea, actually.

Why would you do that?

all be fucked!

01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,633
Get the fuck away from me!

1106
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,635
My friend will be here,
he'll kick your...

1107
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,476
I'm going to be
perfectly fucking clear.

1108
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,438
You call your husband
and you tell him not to
dump it in the water!

1109
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:26,151
You tell him that you,
Michael and Eddie
are all depending on him.

1110
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:35,660
Do you understand me?

1111
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,331
Stay away from my kids!

1112
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,001
He's got a gun!

1113
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:45,587
Whoa! What
are you doing?

1114
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:03,313
Hey.

1115
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:11,905
Are you all right?

1116
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:15,117
Honey, I want you
to get in the truck
with me.

1117
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,993
The kids are inside,
all right?

1118
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,829
You smell like alcohol.

1119
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,331
Yeah, I had a drink.

1120
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,875
You're driving
my kids around drunk?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1121
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,168
Relax. What did
he say to you?

1122
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:32,092
Come on, get out.
We're going in my car.
Let's go.

1123
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:34,511
SEBASTIAN: Kate! Guys,
get back in the car.

1124
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,888
Kate, what are you doing?

1125
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:41,518
Kate! Kate!
Get in the truck.

1126
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:43,353
Fuck.

1127
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:45,313
KATE ON PHONE: He knew
the kids' names.

1128
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,150
Hold on,
you're breaking up, okay?
Let me go outside.

1129
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,526
Oh, fuck.

1130
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,946
Cell service sucks
here on the river.
Hold on, I'm going outside.

1131
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,283
Hello? He told me
to tell you...

1132
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:58,118
No, hold on.
I can't hear you.

1133
01:14:58,202 --> 01:14:59,828
He told me to tell you
not to dump it in...

1134
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,288
He told me to tell
you not to dump it.

1135
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:02,372
Who did?

1136
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,249
Who? The asshole
who came to the house!

1137
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:05,584
Who the fuck told him?

1138
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,668
What?

1139
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,295
(DOOR RATTLES)
Are the boys okay?

1140
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:09,880
They're here.
We're at Jeanie's.

1141
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,756
Kate? Hello?

1142
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:14,593
Chris, please come home.

1143
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:19,848
Chris?

1144
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,516
(SIGHS)

1145
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,269
Hey, how did it go?

1146
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,188
We boarded up
the front window.

1147
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:29,191
The cops took a report.
They're looking for the guy.

1148
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,317
All right.

1149
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,443
They want to talk to you.

1150
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:36,406
Yeah. I'm going to
go by in the morning.

1151
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,491
They want to
talk to you now.

1152
01:15:38,618 --> 01:15:42,829
But we have no stuff.
I've got to go to
Sebastian's to get our stuff.

1153
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,789
Would you mind
watching the boys
for a second?

1154
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,208
Look at your forehead.

1155
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,210
Are you sure you don't
need me to take you
to the hospital?

1156
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:51,630
No, it's just...
It looks worse than it is.

1157
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,966
It just hurts.
Like a bruise, you know?

1158
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:59,429
I think I should
go now before I can't.
You know what I mean?

1159
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,014
I'll see you
in a little bit.

1160
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,557
Goodbye, Mom.
I love you.

1161
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:03,642
Be good boys.

1162
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,700
(BUZZING)

1163
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,164
Sebastian?

1164
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,635
Did you tell Briggs
I was going to dump it?

1165
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,179
No. I didn't
tell nobody.

1166
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:42,347
Don't lie to me.

1167
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:44,891
Chris, I'm not
fucking lying to you.
I didn't say shit.

1168
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,353
Where did you get the drugs?

1169
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,689
From a guy called Ruben.

1170
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:56,194
KATE: Sebastian?

1171
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,193
Hey.

1172
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,404
Hi. I'm just
getting our stuff.

1173
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,865
Are you hungry?
Let me make you some food.

1174
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:43,074
No, I can't.

1175
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:45,660
The boat's not coming in.
I got to get back
to the boys.

1176
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:46,828
Chris will be back tonight.

1177
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,580
No, he's not. He's not
coming home tonight.

1178
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,124
I mean, the boat's
not coming in for, like,
I don't know, tomorrow.

1179
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,084
Chris told me that
I had to take care of you,

1180
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:54,169
so I'm going to
take care of you.

1181
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,087
Sebastian,
are you not hearing me?
We'll be fine, okay?

1182
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:57,172
Yeah, we're fine.

1183
01:17:57,256 --> 01:17:58,340
Okay, good.
All right. Good.

1184
01:17:58,424 --> 01:17:59,591
Give me a hug.

1185
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,096
Okay.
Okay.

1186
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,348
It's been such a big day.

1187
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:07,474
What the fuck are you doing?

1188
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,351
Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.

1189
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:12,854
I'm trying to give
my friend a fucking kiss.
What's your problem?

1190
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,522
What's your problem?
Kate, come on.

1191
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:17,359
Look, I mean,
did you even see this?

1192
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,443
Stop it.

1193
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:19,569
Kate.

1194
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:22,947
How long have we
known each other?

1195
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,617
You know what?
Get your hands off me!

1196
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:28,078
Kate? Kate!

1197
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:29,788

Jesus Christ. Kate!

01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,088
I'm trying to have
a conversation with you,

1202
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,798
and you're acting
like a fucking child.

1203
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,758
Okay. Good.
Why don't you just
walk away from the door,

1204
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:42,842
and let me get out of here.

1205
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:46,221
An ungrateful child.
A little fucking brat,
who's not grateful for...

1206
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,890
Do you want to talk
to Chris about what
a fucking bitch I am?

1207
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,809
I'm going to
fucking call him
on the phone right now!

1208
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,310
Don't call Chris.

1209
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,480
Sweetheart, I love you,
but open the door.

I'm calling Chris!

Don't mess with
his head now!

1212
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,983
Why don't you
fucking tell him?

1213
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,028
