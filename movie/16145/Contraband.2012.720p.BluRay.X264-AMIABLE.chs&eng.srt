104号直升机飞行员 收到
Pilot on flight 104, copy that.

8
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:16,847
妈的!
Shit!

9
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:20,185
Walter 快醒醒 海关的人来了
Walter, wake up. Customs.

10
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,251
什么? 谁来了?
What? Who?

11
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:23,594
快把背包找给我 钥匙在哪儿?
We need the fucking bag. Where the fuck is the key?

12
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:27,468
固定好绳索 到另一边做好警备
Tighten that line. Now secure the other side.

13
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:29,160
慢点 慢点上
Easy, easy up.

14
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:30,465
好的 没事的
Okay, Okay.

15
00:02:30,894 --> 00:02:33,898
快点 快点把它装进包里
Hurry up. Come on, put it in the bag.

16
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:35,405

Come on!

17
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,483
把这个拉上去 快点 快点!
Pull this up. Come on, come on. Let's go!

18
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:46,147
快走 Andy
Go, Andy.

19
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:55,158
站住! 我们是联邦警员! 别动!
Stop! Federal officer! Don't move!

20
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:31,102
禁运品

21
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:36,002
抱歉 打断一下 各位 大家注意一下好吗?
Excuse me. Excuse me, y'all. Can I have everybody's attention?

22
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,072
我想敬今天的新郎新娘 Danny和Shelly
I want to do a quick toast to the bride and groom, Danny and Shelly.

23
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,403
祝贺你们
Congratulations.

24
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:48,012
真难以置信 哥们 我竟然结婚了 Chris
I can't believe it, man. I'm fucking married, Chris.

25
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:51,812
Danny 我知道 我刚才就站在你旁边
Danny, I know. I was standing right there with you.

26
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:53,682
瞧 再来看看这个混蛋如何?
Look, what about this fucking guy?

27
00:03:53,844 --> 00:03:55,949
他是我最好的朋友 也是我的伴郎
He's my best friend, best man at my wedding.

28
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,254
但他甚至都不记得我婚宴是在哪儿举行的
He doesn't even remember that this is where my reception was.

29
00:03:58,315 --> 00:03:59,521
谢天谢地 他还没喝醉
Thank God, he's sober.

30
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,618
你不记得了吗?
You don't remember?

31
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:02,288
我记得自己吐到了Kate的鞋子上了
I remember throwing up on Kate's shoes.

32
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:04,195
是的 我也记得
Yeah, I remember, too.

33
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:05,460
我很抱歉
I apologized for that.

34
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:09,926
各位 跟我一起唱
Everybody, do it like this.

35
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:18,145
我是说 你曾是跟Lennon和McCartney一样出名的走私贩
I mean, you were like the Lennon and McCartney of smuggling.

36
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:21,283
你是怎么走私那辆法拉利的? 你当时把它藏在哪儿了?
How do you smuggle a fucking Ferrari? Where do you hide it?

37
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:22,339
我们没藏那辆车
We didn't.

38
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,644
我们让海关在港口扣押了那辆车
We let customs seize it in port.

39
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,153
把你手机给我
Give me your phone.

40
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,618
把汽车部件拿出来
You take the guts out.

41
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:30,386
变速器 布线系统
The transmission, the wiring system.

42
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:33,027
把那些全都拿出来 藏在另一个集装箱里
Take all that shit out, hide it inside other containers.

43
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,188
当海关拍卖了那辆车之后
So, when customs auctions off the car,

44
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:37,493
买主只能买到个法拉利空壳子
he gets himself a Ferrari for next to nothing.

45
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:39,090
他只买了个空壳子?
He just bought the empty shell?

46
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:42,398
是的 他在拍卖会上只买了个空壳子
Yes, he got the empty shell at the auction.

47
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:44,096
然后我们...
And then we...

48
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:45,935
- 再把缺的那些部分卖给他  - 再把汽车部件卖给他
- Sell him the missing parts.  - Sold him back the guts.

49
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:49,067
这样他算弄到辆完整的新法拉利
And he's got himself a new Ferrari

50
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,373
远比你花钱买一辆破丰田车便宜
for less than you paid for that piece-of-shit Honda.

51
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:52,605
丰田车很不错
It's a nice Honda.

52
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:54,011
是的 那就是你住在丰田车里的原因 对吧?
Yeah, that's why you live in it, right?

53
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,345
因为你那辆破丰田还不错
Because it's a nice fucking Honda.

54
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:56,509
我可以跟我的妻子跳一支舞吗?
Can I dance with my wife?

55
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,686
嘿 你好吗 哥们?
Hey, what's up, buddy?

56
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:04,883
如果可以的话 你能再给我拿一罐这个吗?
Can I get another one of these when you get a chance?

57
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:06,393
嘿 Chris
Hey, Chris.

58
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,585
Church 嘿
Church, hey.

59
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,889
最近过得怎么样 伙计?
How are you doing, man?

60
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:10,454
好久没见了 你去哪儿了?
Long time, no see. Where you been?

61
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:13,661
呃 我现在住在Algiers
Well, I'm living out in Algiers now.

62
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:16,098
你住那儿干什么?
The fuck are you doing out there?

63
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:18,033
那里很不错 我很喜欢
It's nice, I like it out there.

64
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:19,597
那里很适合安家
It's good for the family.

65
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:22,334
像你这样的家伙不应该待在Algiers的 Chris
A guy like you don't belong in Algiers, Chris.

66
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:24,841
你现在的工作是什么?
What are you doing for work?

67
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:28,782
我自己开了公司 帮人安装报警系统
I started my own business, setting up alarm systems.

68
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:33,782
再倒一杯 好吗?
Fill that up, will you?

69
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,488
你老爸进了监狱就把你吓成这样?
Your old man getting jailed freak you out?

70
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:43,195
可能吧
I guess.

71
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:46,598
除此之外 我现在还有妻子和两个儿子 懂吗?
That, and having a wife and two little boys, you know?

72
00:05:48,024 --> 00:05:49,196
我知道
Yeah.

73
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:52,598
尽管这样 你还是应该坚持做你擅长的 Chris
You've got to stick to what you're good at, though, Chris.

74
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:59,741
听着 我曾经想帮你老爸摆平那个船长
Listen, I offered to take care of that ship captain for your dad.

75
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,448
但他拒绝了
He said no.

76
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,814
不管怎么样 Chris 如果你还想重操旧业的话
Anyway, Chris, if you're ever thinking of getting back in,

77
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,879
跟我说一声 好吗?
let me know, okay?

78
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:10,751
好吗?
Yeah?

79
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:12,018
- 好的  - 很好
- Yeah.  - Good.

80
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:20,624
我根本就不理解为什么我们要这样做
I don't even know why we're doing this in the first place.

81
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:25,434
相信我 好吗? 会没事的
Just trust me, okay? It will be cool.

82
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,240
要是我们逃跑的话 情况会变得更糟糕
If we try to run, it will make it worse.

83
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:48,653
接货人在哪儿?
Where are these guys?

84
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:56,465
他们来了 要开始了
Here we go, here we go.

85
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:08,380
冷静点
Be cool, now.

86
00:07:13,143 --> 00:07:14,349
他们来了 他们走过来了
Here we go, here we go.

87
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:19,183
嘿 哥们
Hey, man.

88
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:23,357
我们遭遇了海关突击检查 就只好把货扔进海里了
Customs boarded us, we had to dump the package.

89
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:27,930
真的丢了?
You did?

90
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:30,700
我们当时别无选择
We had no choice.

91
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,167
是把?
Right?

92
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,033
我们根本无能为力 哥们
Nothing we could do, man.

93
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:51,417
这样就行了
That's it.

94
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:54,654
就像我说的? 我跟你说过不会有事的
What did I say? I told you it was cool.

95
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:56,925
快点吧 哥们 我们赶紧离开这地方
Come on, man, let's get the fuck out of here.

96
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:15,339
喂?
Hello?

97
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,576
是我弟弟
It's my brother.

98
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:20,779
发生什么事了? 他没事儿吧?
What happened? Is he okay?

99
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:23,390
不 我们现在得走了
No. We've got to go now.

100
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:24,618
什么?
What?

101
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:35,864
Walter还在急救室里
Walter is in surgery.

102
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,594
发生什么事了 Andy?
What the fuck happened, Andy?

103
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:43,237
我们出车祸了
It was an accident.

104
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,406
你知道吗? 你是个差劲的骗子 快说实话吧
You know what? You're a shitty liar, so don't even fucking try.

105
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,709
我跟你说话的时候要看着我
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

106
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:52,108
我在走私
I was running something.

107
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:57,417
我们上船了 然后我把货扔进水里了
We got boarded, and I dumped it.

108
00:08:57,948 --> 00:08:59,894
你把什么扔了?
You dumped what?

109
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:02,319
可卡因
The coke.

110
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:03,690
噢 该死
Oh, fuck.

111
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,130
大概超过10磅
It was over 10 pounds.

112
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,792
你帮谁干的?
For who?

113
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,666
帮Tim Briggs
For Tim Briggs

114
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:13,032
和他们那一伙
and those guys.

115
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:14,200
他们会杀了我的
They're going to kill me.

116
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:16,945
Andy 他们不会杀了你的
Andy, they're not going to kill you.

117
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,110
但货太多了
It was a lot of stuff.

118
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:23,082
对不起
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,586
你当然应该感到抱歉
You should be fucking sorry.

120
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:29,481
他还好吗?
Is he all right?

121
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:31,150
不好 这个小混蛋当时在走私
No, the little fuck head was running something

122
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:32,784
但把货扔了 现在是他欠别人了
and he dumped it. Now he owes.

123
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,486
谁? 他欠谁的?
Who? Who does he owe?

124
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:35,791
欠Tim Briggs的
Tim Briggs.

125
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:37,956
你四处打听一下 看看能不能发现什么 好吗?
Ask around, see what you can find out, all right?

126
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:39,733
Kate怎么样?
How is Kate?

127
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,132
不太好
Not good.

128
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,203
我不敢相信他竟然去走私
I can't believe he did that.

129
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,436
我退出的时候 我跟他说过离那些家伙远点儿
When I quit, I told him to stay away from these guys.

130
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:52,205
求你了 如果你知道些什么的话 现在就告诉我
Please, if you had anything to do with this, just tell me right now.

131
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:53,303
我都告诉你了
I just told you.

132
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:54,641
好吧
Okay.

133
00:09:58,908 --> 00:10:00,410
他可是我的亲弟弟
He's my little brother.

134
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:03,183
我知道 我会想办法解决的
I know. I'm going to take care of it.

135
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:26,341
我抱你去睡觉
I got you.

136
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:32,445
我明天早上打电话给你
I'll call you in the morning.

137
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:34,113
好的 没问题
Okay, no problem.

138
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:35,485
晚安
Good night.

139
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,824
那按你说的 安装完这个就万无一失了吗?
So you said King Security put the system in?

140
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,326
没错 它确实非常有用
That's right. A lot of good it did.

141
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:15,895
这个系统运行很稳定 但是你的锁就有问题了
It's a decent system, but your locks are a joke.

142
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:18,261
任何知道防盗锁反应时间的人
Anybody who knows the response time

143
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,891
都能够进出一个来回
is going to be able to get in and out.

144
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,027
我能接个电话吗 先生?
Can you excuse me for one second, sir?

145
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:24,094
当然
Yes.

146
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:26,174
- 怎么了?  - 是关于Briggs的 他是Kyle的哥哥
- What's going on?  - It's about Briggs, Kyle's brother.

147
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:27,230
是吗 然后呢?
Yeah, and?

148
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,741
这我就不知道了 稍等一下
I don't know, hold on.

149
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:32,107
伙计们! 伙计们! 工程进度怎么样?
Guys! Guys! How are we doing today?

150
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:35,681
我的办公室下周能完工吗?
Is my office still going to be done last week?

151
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,412
你们今天早上过得不错吧?
You having a nice morning?

152
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:38,575
很好!
Good!

153
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:40,813
Briggs两个月之前刚出狱
Briggs got out of prison two months ago.

154
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:42,379
然后他就一直在Old Point酒吧附近出没
He hangs out at the Old Point Bar.

155
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:45,051
等我工作做完后就去那儿看一下 看看能不能跟他谈谈
I'll pop over there after I'm done work and see if I can talk to him.

156
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:47,289
非常抱歉 先生
Sorry about that, sir.

157
00:11:47,884 --> 00:11:49,363
这些摄像头非常小
The cameras are nice and small,

158
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,830
它们安在墙角刚好合适
they'll fit right up there in the corner.

159
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:25,066
噢 该死!
Oh, shit!

160
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:29,228
伙计 Chris Farraday起死回生了! 不错啊!
Chris Farraday, back from the dead, man! Yeah!

161
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,799
看到你很高兴 哥们
Good to see you, man.

162
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:35,334
噢 该死 这家伙可是个世界级的走私贩
Oh, shit. This man was a world-class smuggler here.

163
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:37,842
你简直就是走私界的魔术师 哥们
You were fucking Houdini, man.

164
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:42,316
没错 他过去常常跟我弟弟一起干 愿上帝宽恕他那可悲的灵魂
Yeah, he used to run with my brother, God rest his miserable soul.

165
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:45,709
遗憾的是你那猪脑子内弟
Too bad your skill didn't rub off

166
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,254
没从你身上学到一点东西
on your shit head brother-in-law.

167
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,721
当然 我知道 他搞砸了
No, I know, he's a fuck up.

168
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,758
- 嗯  - 但是他可是我妻子的亲弟弟
- Mmm.  - But he's my wife's little brother.

169
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:52,691
我希望你能明白我们是一家人
I was hoping you understand it's family,

170
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,057
或许我们可以想办法解决这件事
maybe we could work something out.

171
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,152
呃 我不确定 你想怎么解决这件事呢?
Well, I don't know. What do you want to work out?

172
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:57,994
还是你想解决我呢?
You want to work out something with me?

173
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:00,067
我是说 我可以想办法筹钱还你货钱
I mean, I can figure out a way to pay you back the buy money.

174
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:03,337
不行 那货可值70万美元
No, that's worth 700 grand to me.

175
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:05,166
- 噢 别这样 伙计  - 不 还是你得了吧 伙计
- Oh, come on, man.  - No, come on, man.

176
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:07,640
你想让我来承担运货失败的全部责任吗?
You're going to try to charge me full freight for a bad run?

177
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:10,507
有海关上船突击检查 就把货丢了 你知道道上的规矩
Customs boards the boat, you dump that shit. You know how it goes.

178
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,147
你知道我当年跟你的弟弟跑了多少次货吗?
You know how many passes I gave your brother in his day?

179
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:14,874
知道 但我恨我弟弟
Yeah, I hated my brother.

180
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:17,583
你想怎么办 给我个还款计划?
What do you want to do, a payment plan?

181
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:19,142
开什么玩笑 我看着像开银行的吗?
What, do I look like a bank to you?

182
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:21,382
不 我只是希望你能在这事上讲点道理
No, I was just hoping you could be fucking reasonable, here.

183
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,684
嘿! 现在不是你的时代了 伙计!
Hey! This ain't your world any more, man!

184
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,525
你现在只不过是个过客 你不能再在这儿呼风唤雨了
You're a tourist, you can't trade on status you don't have.

185
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,823
我还有一大堆人要养活
I got bills to pay.

186
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:32,696
你知道的 谁搞砸的 那就是谁的麻烦
You know, when people fuck that up, that's their fucking problem.

187
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:35,759
你觉得这是儿戏吗? 你有钱吗?
You think that's funny? You got bills?

188
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,340
我喜欢你的衣服
I like your outfit.

189
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:47,378
我更喜欢你弟弟
I liked your brother.

190
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,784
我们今天又聚到一起了 这才是最重要的
We're here today, that's the important thing.

191
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:56,717
因此 大家都知道的 学着放手并让上帝
So, you know, learning to let go and let God

192
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:59,385
帮你自己从这一切中摆脱出来
is what's been pulling me through all of this.

193
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:05,556
在我杀了Briggs之前 你得想办法让我冷静下来
You're going to have to talk me down before I fucking kill Briggs.

194
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:07,591
或许你还是离开这里比较好
Probably be better off.

195
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,397
我总是一醉解千愁
I'm one drink away from the worst day of my life.

196
00:14:10,326 --> 00:14:11,600
我现在能做点什么?
What should I do?

197
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:14,335
我也知道在这个互助会里 我不是唯一一个有这想法的人 对吧?
And I know I'm not the only one sitting in this circle that's had that same thought, right?

198
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:16,868
你要做的就是一步步来
That's all you gotta do is work the steps.

199
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:18,879
我不会再去走私了
I'm not doing another run.

200
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:20,714
绝对不会
No fucking way.

201
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:24,048
我也许能筹到启动资金 没问题的
I could probably get us the buy money, no problem.

202
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:25,381
不 我总能想到解决办法的
No, I finally got something going.

203
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:27,284
我不会冒险去重操旧业
I'm not going to chance fucking it up.

204
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:31,323
你是时代还没有过去 Chris
It's not going away, Chris.

205
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:34,088
有人想分享一下自己的经历吗?
Does somebody want to share?

206
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,230
Sebastian? 想跟我们分享一下你的经历吗?
Sebastian? Want to share a little bit with us?

207
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:38,061
- 好吧  - 噢 好吧
- Okay.  - Oh, yeah.

208
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:39,122
忙你的去吧
Go do your thing.

209
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:41,299
你不待在这里了吗?
You don't want to stick around?

210
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,837
不了 我听这种故事太容易情绪化了
No, I get far too emotional hearing that story.

211
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,873
- 嘿 各位 我是Sebastian  - 你好 Sebastian?
- Hey, everyone, I'm Sebastian.  - How are you doing, Sebastian?

212
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:55,309
发生什么事了?
What the hell happened?

213
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:57,683
Walter昨晚死了
Walter died last night.

214
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:01,352
Briggs来过医院了
Briggs came to the hospital.

215
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,514
他说了 这件事全怪我
He said it was all on me.

216
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:06,256
我一直接到电话 Chris
I keep getting calls, Chris,

217
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:09,820
还有他们一直在说会怎么折磨我
and they're talking about how they're going to fucking torture me.

218
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:13,060
我这几天就会坐船逃离这里 我不会再回来了
I'm shipping out in the next couple of days. I'm not coming back.

219
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:18,037
帮我个忙 在我走之前 不要告诉Kate
Do me a favor, and don't tell Kate. Not until I'm gone.

220
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:19,596
当我结束走私生涯的时候
When I stopped doing runs,

221
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:21,141
你向我保证过 不会染指这生意的
you promised me you were gonna stay out of this shit.

222
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:22,369
你想让我说什么 伙计?
What do you want me to say, man?

223
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:23,500
他妈的一个字都别说!
Not a fucking word!

224
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:28,741
现在搞砸了事情的可不是我 是你!
I didn't have anybody to tell me I was fucking up. You do!

225
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:31,743
还有你就想这样把你的姐姐和她的孩子们拖下水吗?
And you put your sister and the boys in this shit?

226
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:33,582
你他妈的是有什么毛病?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

227
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:22,959
喔
Whoa.

228
00:16:23,393 --> 00:16:26,033
你不应该来我家的
You don't come to my fucking place.

229
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,335
我只是想来告诉你
I just came to tell you

230
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:28,603
我会在一个月内还你的钱
that I'm going to have your money within a month.

231
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:29,699
你只要离Andy远点就行了
Just stay away from Andy.

232
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:31,109
我可不想等那么久
I ain't waiting that long.

233
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,281
好吧 如果他死了 我也不会付钱的
Well, I ain't paying if he's dead.

234
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:37,349
如果背债的人死了
If a guy dies owing something

235
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:38,852
那他家里人就要替他还
his family inherits the debt.

236
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:40,921
我只给你两个星期
So I'll give you two weeks.

237
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:43,924
如果到时候你还不还钱的话 我就把你俩都干掉
If not, I'm going to come after the both of you.

238
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,252
然后就顺藤摸瓜
Then, all the way down the line.

239
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:47,692
我就会向你的妻子要这笔账 还有你的孩子...
I'll come asking your wife for it, your kids...

240
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:57,400
你觉得就你一个有枪吗?
Do you think you're the only guy with a fucking gun?

241
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:59,131
你会拿到钱的
You'll get your fucking money.

242
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:01,004
但如果你再敢提我的妻子
But if you ever mention my wife

243
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:02,907
和我的孩子的话 我就毙了你
and my kids again, you're done.

244
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:06,047
你听到了吗? 你他妈的就玩完了!
You hear me? You are fucking done!

245
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:07,510
爸爸
Daddy.

246
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:10,640
没事的 甜心 回屋子里去
It's okay, sweetie. Go back inside.

247
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:13,550
没事的 甜心 你爸爸和我只是在玩游戏 好吗?
It's okay, sweetie. Daddy and I were just playing, okay?

248
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:15,350
没事的 是的 我们只是在玩游戏
It's okay. Yeah, we're just playing.

249
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,721
没错 我和爸爸刚刚只是在玩游戏
Yeah, me and Daddy were just fucking playing.

250
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:18,986
到这里来
Get up there.

251
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:21,818
好吧 我们改天再玩儿
Yeah, we'll play again.

252
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:23,352
爸爸没事的
Daddy is okay.

253
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:25,723
没事的
It's all right.

254
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:29,762
你们他妈的在看什么?
What the fuck are you looking at?

255
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,563
你待在车里 我去跟她谈
You stay in the car, I'll go talk to her.

256
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:56,753
好的
Okay.

257
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,809
- 嘿 Chris  - 嘿 你好吗?
- Hey, Chris.  - Hey, how are you?

258
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:10,933
嗨
Hi.

259
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,104
嘿
Hey.

260
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:13,579
你没事吧?
Everything okay?

261
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,807
没事 我只想跟你说几句话
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.

262
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:16,906
好的
Okay.

263
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:29,161
我得跟Andy走一趟货来摆平这件事
I got to get on the ship with Andy and try to fix this.

264
00:18:29,252 --> 00:18:31,357
你开什么玩笑?
Are you fucking kidding?

265
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,899
我还能做什么 让他一个人去吗?
What am I going to do, let him go alone?

266
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:34,457
不 我们可以想点别的办法
No, we're going to think of something else.

267
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,570
没有别的办法了 懂吗?
There's nothing else to do, okay?

268
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:37,764
我本来不想告诉你
I hate to tell you,

269
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,704
可是这件事把我们

And if they don't get the money from him, they're coming after us.

272

你觉得我还有别的选择吗?

你知道我不想做什么吗?

280
00:19:02,685 --> 00:19:04,221

还记得小时候你和Sebastian一起玩

偷走了所有狂欢节用的宝石

你还以为那是钻石

你笑得就像中奖了一样
You were grinning like you just won the fucking lottery.

295
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:01,851
你还说
And you said,

296
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:05,015
"你再也不用去那船上工作了"
"You don't have to work on that boat no more."

297

我总会想起那件事

The proudest day of my life was when you turned legit,

299
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,374

and you started your own business, and you got out of the life.

300

我总是要添置点东西 把房子给装修好
I'm getting it together, I'm getting the place ready.

315
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,241
这可是个高级咖啡桌
It's a bad-ass coffee table.

316

我必须要走了 我都不知道什么是高级了
I must be out of touch. I don't know what's bad-ass any more

318

00:27:08,303 --> 00:27:09,441
你好啊 Tarik 你还好吗?
What's up, Tarik? You okay?

406
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:10,506
你好啊 兄弟
What's up, man?

407
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:12,884
- 你父母怎么样? 大家都好吗?  - 很好 很好
- How's your folks? Everybody's good?  - Good, good.

408
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:14,249
看来你肯定是饿惨了
That's a hungry man's appetite.

409
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:15,379
这很好吃
This is real good.

410
00:27:15,444 --> 00:27:16,445
还好吗? 兄弟
How you doing, buddy?

411
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,491
你在我船上干嘛?
What the fuck are you doing on my ship?

412
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:25,587
你检查船员名单了吗?
Did you even check the goddamn crew manifest?

413
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:28,066
你怎么能让Farraday上我的船?
How the fuck do you let Bud Farraday's spawn aboard my ship?

414
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:30,125
国土安全部检查过了 是他在最后一分钟加上名单的...
DHS cleared him. He was added at the last minute...

415
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,466
好吧 我已经把他降级为服务生了
All right, I'm demoting him to ship's boy.

416
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:32,528
是 船长
Yes, sir.

417
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:35,965
你去把灰擦一擦 别他妈再让我看见你
You scrub dirt and stay the fuck out of my sight.

418
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,908
否则你会有意外的
Otherwise you might have an accident,

419
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,377
然后在海里了结你的小命
and wind up in the drink.

420
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,244
告诉他地毯清洁器在哪里
Show him where the carpet cleaner is.

421
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:44,545
是 船长
Yes, sir.

422
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,279
噢 天呐 地毯清洁器
Oh, man, carpet cleaner.

423
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:50,849
走吧 擦地毯专家
Let's go, Rug Doctor.

424
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:55,251
噢 你升职了? 他们又给你加了几道新的杠杠
Oh, you got promoted? They gave you some new stripes on there.

425
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:57,558
我是服务生 你仍然是船长的狗腿子
I'll be ship's boy. You're still Captain's bitch boy.

426
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:58,620
是啊 是啊
Yeah, yeah.

427
00:28:41,964 --> 00:28:42,965
好的
Okay.

428
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:44,374
是 船长
Yes, sir.

429
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:24,050
所有人都在喝酒 没人工作
Everybody's drinking tall boys, and nobody's fucking working.

430
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:25,374
你好啊 伙计
What's up, man?

431
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,714
船长算是我们一伙儿的吗?
Are you bringing the Captain in on this or what?

432
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:27,776
当然没有
Fuck, no.

433
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:31,417
我还记得在就在这个房间跟你爸说过话
Well, I remember talking to your pops in this same room.

434
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,083
他说了一样的屁话 我们都知道结果如何
He said that same shit. We know how that turned out.

435
00:29:34,183 --> 00:29:35,594
你们相信我吗?
Do you trust me or not?

436
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,856
相信 当然
I do. I do.

437
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,158
我们运什么货?
So what are we running?

438
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:43,567
5000张还没裁剪过的"超级美元"
A shipping pallet loaded up with 5,000 uncut sheets of super notes.

439
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:45,161
那可是能买到的最好假钞
Best counterfeit money can buy.

440
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:47,605
你怎么就认为我们能运那么多东西呢?
And just how the hell do you think we're going to stow that much shit?

441
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:49,834
你是担心了吗 兄弟? 我是说 信仰在哪里?
You worried, buddy? I mean, where is the faith?

442
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:52,637
怎么 因为我降了级? 现在我就要从头开始了吗?
What, I lost my stripes? Now I got to start from scratch?

443
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:54,408
确实 那东西是空的
Exactly, that shit's void.

444
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:55,470
那没关系
No problem.

445
00:29:55,537 --> 00:29:57,744
来 我给你们看
Come on, I'll show you.

446
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:08,853
觉得怎么样?
What do you think?

447
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,090
看起来不错 Chris 你是个疯子
Looks good. Chris, you're a crazy fucker.

448
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:13,962
这不错 是吗? 六十立方英尺
Not bad? Huh? Sixty cubic feet.

449
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:17,697
根本不止 这比六十立方英尺大
No fucking way. No, it's bigger than 60.

450
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,272
啊 该死! 是啊 兄弟 这比六十立方英尺大多了
Ah, shit! Yeah, man, this is much bigger than 60.

451
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:21,399
有人来了
We got company.

452
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:23,132
快 快 放回去!
Quick, quick, quick!

453
00:30:23,298 --> 00:30:24,834
嘿 你做什么呢? Chris 停下来!
Hey, what are you doing? Chris, stop!

454
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,311
Andy 在里面安静点
Andy, be quiet in there.

455
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:32,647
快 快!
Come on, come on!

456
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:34,953
你们在这干嘛?
What the hell are you doing in here?

457
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,421
我要一把刮刀 我们发现较低的船体发霉了
I needed a scraper. We noticed some mold in the lower hull.

458
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:38,924
漂白剂没用 所以...
The bleach wasn't cutting it, so...

459
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,757
你们不应该来这附近 快走吧
Well, you shouldn't be dicking around in here. Get going.

460
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,956
我就是想帮你弄干净点 头儿
I was just trying to keep it clean for you, boss.

461
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,022
嘿 Chris! Chris!
Hey, Chris! Chris!

462

Bring it right back up! Come on, you got it!

463
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:22,560
你可以的 加油!
You got it, come on!

464
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,430
我不行了
I can't do it.

465
00:31:26,495 --> 00:31:27,496
该死
God damn.

466
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:31,738
你来举吗?
Are you getting on?

467
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,904
不了
No.

468
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:34,379
你要我再把你送到箱子里吗?
Do you want me to put you back in the box?

469
00:31:34,469 --> 00:31:36,073
这不好笑
That's not funny.

470
00:31:36,138 --> 00:31:37,913
我可能会闷死在那个箱子里的
I could have suffocated in that box.

471
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:38,974
"我可能会..."
"I really could have..."

472
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:40,943
别逗那孩子了 兄弟
Leave the kid alone, man.

473
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:42,352
你打算怎么做这事?
How are you going to pull this shit off?

474
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,455
- 我们要运大约300个集装箱  - 嗯
- We're delivering 300 or so containers.  - Yeah.

475
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:48,461
我们至少要在那边装500个 我们不会在港口呆那么久
We're picking up 500 or more. We're not going to be in port that long.

476
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:51,589
我们要开车去Chorrillo 跟Edwin碰面 装上货
So we got to drive out to Chorrillo, see Edwin, load up the bills,

477
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:53,462
然后在高峰拥挤时段开车回船上
and then drive back to the boat during rush hour.

478
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:55,001
时间会很紧迫 但我们能搞定
It's going to be tight, but we're going to be good.

479
00:31:55,057 --> 00:31:56,627
这会非常紧迫 时间卡得太紧了
It's going to be too tight. We're cutting it close.

480
00:31:56,692 --> 00:31:58,501
可能时间会不够
Might not have enough time.

481
00:31:59,461 --> 00:32:01,031
我们就拖延时间
We'll buy more time.

482
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:02,735
有可变螺距推进器
Controllable pitch propeller.

483
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,142
噢 是啊 有螺距推进器
Oh, yeah. Pitch propeller.

484
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,508
你能把供油排干吗?
Can you drain the oil supply?

485
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:08,509
那是液压油箱会失灵的
The hydraulic chamber won't work.

486
00:32:08,837 --> 00:32:10,077
那是才重点 笨蛋
That's the point, stupid ass.

487
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:12,009
听着
Look.

488
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:14,515
别人把船拖过船闸的时候 我们就可以动手
We can do it while being towed through the locks.

489
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:15,816
这能拖延几个小时
It will buy us a couple of hours.

490
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:17,720
- 行吗?  - 我不知道
- Okay?  - I don't know.

491
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,315
我讨厌把船弄坏
I hate when we fuck with the boat.

492
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:20,655
你说什么?
What?

493
00:32:20,716 --> 00:32:23,196
我说我讨厌把船弄坏
I said, I hate when we fuck with the boat.

494
00:32:23,251 --> 00:32:24,252
放松点 大块头
Take it easy, big bear.

495
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,525
Olaf 操他妈的船
Olaf, fuck with the boat.

496
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:28,466
放松点 放松
Take it easy. Easy.

497
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:29,558
怎么了?
What the fuck?

498
00:32:29,624 --> 00:32:32,468
Tarik 那混蛋会活吃了你
Tarik. That motherfucker will eat you.

499
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:39,568
好了 下车了
Okay, out you come.

500
00:32:41,136 --> 00:32:43,082
- 能帮我拿点东西吗?  - 一定要拿吗?
- Do you want to get any of these for me?  - Do we have to?

501
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:44,139
可以啊 妈妈
Yes, Mom.

502
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:45,378
可以吗? 很好
Yeah? Okay.

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,543
还钱 你欠我的
Pay the money just like you owe me.

509
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:47,944
你们都在看什么?
What the fuck are you all looking at?

510
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:49,311
你喜欢这样吗?
Yeah, you like that?

511
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:50,406
把你的脏手拿开!
Get your fucking hands off me!

512
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:56,620
把刀放下 把刀放下

I'm just playing.

518
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,161
别这样 别哭
Yeah, don't cry.

519
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:10,330
你们之前见过枪吗? 想要吗?
You seen a gun before? You want it?

520
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,564
我下个星期再来的时候 可就不是玩玩的了
There ain't going to be no playing when I come back next week.

521
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:14,231
你可以告诉你丈夫
You can tell your husband that.

522
00:34:14,296 --> 00:34:15,934

我没想开枪打他 是那小混蛋的错
I didn't mean to shoot at him. The little shit hit the gun.

529
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:34,188

You want to send me back to the farm, you stupid bitch?

530
00:34:34,249 --> 00:34:36,695

543
00:35:20,562 --> 00:35:24,135
我觉得其中一个是Tim Briggs 就是Kyle的哥哥
I think one of them was Tim Briggs, Kyle's brother.

544
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,475
我没有报警 我不想警察来这问东问西的
I didn't call the police, I don't want them here asking questions.

545
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:31,016

553
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:01,572

They're not going to be back, but just for my own peace of mind.

554
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:02,637
你真这么觉得?
You think?

555

I said, slow ahead! Reduce to half speed!

558
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,532
为什么我们还没减速?
Why are we not slowing down?

559
00:36:25,293 --> 00:36:26,738
油压下降
Oil pressure's down.

560
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:28,671
好的 看着点那温度显示器

We're going to hit the fucking dock!

565
00:36:36,204 --> 00:36:38,912
我在试了 但没反应 螺旋桨卡住了!
I'm trying, but I got no pitch control. The fucking prop is jammed!

566
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:44,285
你抽掉太多机油了! 我可没想让你把船给弄沉了!
You drained too much oil out! I didn't want you to crash the boat!

567
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:45,347
什么?
What?

568
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:51,723
拜托! 我这里一点油压都没有!
Come on! I'm not getting any oil pressure!

569
00:36:57,325 --> 00:36:58,895
抛下左舷锚!
Let go the port anchor!

570
00:37:02,464 --> 00:37:03,738

572
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:09,144
它没动! 你松开闸门了吗?
It's not moving! Did you release the brake?

573
00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:11,440
闪开! 走开!
Get out of the way! Move!

574
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:15,679
右转舵!
Turn starboard!

575
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:18,348
太晚了! 左转舵 Luke! 左转舵!
It's too late! Hard to port, Luke! Hard to port!

576
00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:28,195
我去把引擎给熄了!
I'm going to have to kill the engine!

577
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:38,139
该死...
Fucking...

578

579
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:09,335
这里他妈的发生什么事了?
What the fuck is going on around here?

580
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:14,470
他妈的出了什么情况?
What the fuck happened?

581
00:38:14,536 --> 00:38:15,571
螺旋桨卡住了
Propeller jam.

582
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:17,948
肯定有人搞破坏
Someone tampered with it.

583
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:19,314
我不这么觉得
I don't think so.

584
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:22,187
肯定有人搞破坏
Someone tampered with it.

585
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:38,287
你机械部门谁管事的?

586
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:40,387
他第一次上班吗? 还是他醉过去了?

587
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:41,187
你呢? 你睡着了吗?

588
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:42,287
请原谅我

589
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,387
这种事情下次不准再发生!

590

知道了

591
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:46,687

Sorry about that oil thing.

593
00:39:06,321 --> 00:39:07,891
别担心那个
Don't worry about it.

594
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:09,697
这还给我们争取了点时间
It will buy us a little more time.

595
00:39:14,129 --> 00:39:17,303

还是你本来就没脑子?
Are you fucking crazy?

963
01:05:49,556 --> 01:05:51,399
钱呢? 钱在哪儿?
Where's the money? Where is it?

964

花掉了! 我迫不得已的

01:06:02,469 --> 01:06:04,073
在天花板上
It's in the ceiling.

972

你是有多蠢啊?
How fucking stupid are you?

974
01:06:14,948 --> 01:06:17,827

I came out here to help you, to risk my fucking freedom

975
01:06:17,918 --> 01:06:20,922
还要连累我的妻儿 就为了运毒?

976
01:06:20,988 --> 01:06:22,831

Motherfucker.

977
01:06:22,956 --> 01:06:26,631
你说我他妈该怎么处理这东西?
What the fuck am I supposed to do with all that?

978
01:06:26,693 --> 01:06:28,138
你真是蠢到家了...
You got to be the dumbest motherfucker...

Andy带了些货上船
Andy picked something up.

1004
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:05,661
什么? 我们不是不干这个了嘛

1005
01:08:05,726 --> 01:08:06,727
没得选择
I didn't have a choice.

1006

这得谢谢Andy先斩后奏啊 是吧?
Thank God for Andy taking the initiative, though, huh?

1007
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,041
可惜我不打算带着
Too bad I'm not bringing it in.

1008
01:08:12,332 --> 01:08:13,834
事实上我在想直接把毒品扔海里去
I'm thinking of dumping it in the sea, actually.

1009
01:08:14,234 --> 01:08:15,838
为什么要这么做?
Why would you do that?

1010

1014
01:08:44,398 --> 01:08:46,708
我说过近期会给你回复的
I told you I would call you with an update.

1015
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,471
再拖几天时间我都想
You've got a few more days left

1016
01:08:50,237 --> 01:08:52,979
把你头割下来 塞进你屁股里了
before I cut your head off and stick it up your ass.

1017
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,611
而你却问我 "出什么事情了?"
And you're asking me, "Is there anything wrong?"

1018
01:08:58,312 --> 01:09:00,121
我有批货要进来

Abney 你不适合干这一行
Flying solo ain't for sidekicks, Abney.

你第一次来找我借钱
When you first came to me for help

1024
01:09:18,031 --> 01:09:20,033
维持你这小本生意的时候

我就警告过你

1026
01:09:22,603 --> 01:09:25,607
我说 "你得知道什么时候该住手"
I said, "You've got to know your limitations."

1027
01:09:25,906 --> 01:09:28,546
"不要贪得无厌!"
"Don't live beyond your fucking means!"

1028
01:09:31,878 --> 01:09:34,017
我一般不这么找人要债
I don't normally do this fucking shit.

1029
01:09:35,115 --> 01:09:37,595
警告说不按时给钱的后果
Telling you what's going to happen when you don't pay.

1030
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:40,564
这有什么用呢? 你知道规矩 是吧?
What's the fucking point? You know the rules, right?

1031
01:09:41,588 --> 01:09:42,828
是的
Right.

1032
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,372

我还以为她是你的人呢
Man, I thought she was your family.

1037
01:11:07,574 --> 01:11:10,350
要我说 你对他老婆有意思 你就去上
You know, if you want to fuck his wife, you fuck his wife.

1038
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:12,686
但别浪费我时间好让你英雄救美
But don't waste my time so you can play a hero.

1039
01:11:12,746 --> 01:11:14,555
Chris现在拿不定主意

01:11:57,791 --> 01:11:58,861
你觉得这能蒙混过关?
Do you think it's going to work?

1046
01:11:58,959 --> 01:12:00,802
- 可以的  - 你确定?

It says right there, he's the guy shipping the van,

1278
01:28:24,744 --> 01:28:26,451
