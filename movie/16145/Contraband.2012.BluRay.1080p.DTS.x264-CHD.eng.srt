1
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:35,866
We have India 114, 116, and 260 in position.

2
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,947
Flight 104 is 500 yards in trail, waiting for your go.

3
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,279
That's it, right there. There's our guy.

4
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,918
Begin your final approach to the target.

5
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,920
Flight 104, copy that.

6
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,804
Shit!

7
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,142
Walter, wake up. Customs.

8
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,208
What? Who?

9
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,551
We need the fucking bag. Where the fuck is the key?

10
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,425
Tighten that line. Now secure the other side.

11
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,117
Easy, easy up.

12
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,422
Okay, okay.

13
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,855
Hurry up. Come on, put it in the bag.

14
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:35,362
Come on!

15
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:42,440
Pull this up. Come on, come on. Let's go!

16
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,104
Go, Andy.

17
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,115
Stop! Federal officer! Don't move!

18
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,959
Excuse me. Excuse me, y'all. Can I have everybody's attention?

19
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,029
I want to do a quick toast to the bride and groom, Danny and Shelly.

20
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,360
Congratulations.

21
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,969
I can't believe it, man. I'm fucking married, Chris.

22
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:51,769
Danny, I know. I was standing right there with you.

23
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,639
Look, what about this fucking guy?

24
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,906
He's my best friend, best man at my wedding.

25
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,211
He doesn't even remember that this is where my reception was.

26
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,478
Thank God he's sober.

27
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,575
You don't remember?

28
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,245
I remember throwing up on Kate's shoes.

29
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,152
Yeah, I remember, too.

30
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,417
I apologized for that.

31
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,883
Everybody, do it like this.

32
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:18,102
I mean, you were like the Lennon and McCartney of smuggling.

33
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,240
How do you smuggle a fucking Ferrari? Where do you hide it?

34
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,296
We didn't.

35
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,601
We let customs seize it in port.

36
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,110
Give me your phone.

37
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,575
You take the guts out.

38
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:30,343
The transmission, the wiring system.

39
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,984
Take all that shit out, hide it inside other containers.

40
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,145
So, when customs auctions off the car,

41
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,450
he gets himself a Ferrari for next to nothing.

42
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,047
He just bought the empty shell?

43
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,355
Yes, he got the empty shell at the auction.

44
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,053
And then we...

45
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,892
Sell him the missing parts. ...sold him back the guts.

46
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,024
And he's got himself a new Ferrari

47
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,330
for less than you paid for that piece-of-shit Honda.

48
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,562
It's a nice Honda.

49
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,968
Yeah, that's why you live in it, right?

50
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,302
Because it's a nice fucking Honda.

51
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,466
Can I dance with my wife?

52
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,643
Hey, what's up, buddy?

53
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,840
Can I get another one of these when you get a chance?

54
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,350
Hey, Chris.

55
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,542
Church, hey.

56
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,846
How are you doing, man?

57
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,411
Long time, no see. Where you been?

58
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,618
Well, I'm living out in Algiers now.

59
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,055
The fuck are you doing out there?

60
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:17,990
It's nice, I like it out there.

61
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:19,554
It's good for the family.

62
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,291
A guy like you don't belong in Algiers, Chris.

63
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,798
What are you doing for work?

64
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,739
I started my own business, setting up alarm systems.

65
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,739
Fill that up, will you?

66
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,445
Your old man getting jailed freak you out? Huh?

67
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,152
I guess.

68
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,555
That, and having a wife and two little boys, you know?

69
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,153
Yeah.

70
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:52,555
You've got to stick to what you're good at, though, Chris.

71
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:59,698
Listen, I offered to take care of that ship captain for your dad.

72
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,405
He said no.

73
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,771
Anyway, Chris, if you're ever thinking of getting back in,

74
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,836
let me know, okay?

75
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,708
Yeah?

76
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,975
Yeah. Good.

77
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,581
I don't even know why we're doing this in the first place.

78
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:25,391
Just trust me, okay? It will be cool.

79
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,197
If we try to run, it will make it worse.

80
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,610
Where are these guys?

81
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,422
Here we go, here we go.

82
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,337
Be cool, now.

83
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,306
Here we go, here we go.

84
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,140
Hey, man.

85
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:23,314
Customs boarded us, we had to dump the package.

86
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,887
You did?

87
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,657
We had no choice.

88
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,124
Right?

89
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,990
Nothing we could do, man.

90
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,374
That's it.

91
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,611
What did I say? I told you it was cool.

92
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,882
Come on, man, let's get the fuck out of here.

93
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,296
Hello?

94
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,533
It's my brother.

95
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,736
What happened? Is he okay?

96
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,347
No. We've got to go now.

97
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,575
What?

98
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,821
Walter is in surgery.

99
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,551
What the fuck happened, Andy?

100
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,194
It was an accident.

101
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:46,363
You know what? You're a shitty liar, so don't even fucking try.

102
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,666
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

103
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,065
I was running something.

104
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,374
We got boarded, and I dumped it.

105
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,851
You dumped what?

106
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,276
The coke.

107
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,647
Oh, fuck.

108
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,087
It was over 10 pounds.

109
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:08,749
For who?

110
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,623
For Tim Briggs

111
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:12,989
and those guys.

112
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,157
They're going to kill me.

113
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,902
Andy, they're not going to kill you.

114
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,067
It was a lot of stuff.

115
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,039
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,543
You should be fucking sorry.

117
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,438
Is he all right?

118
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,107
No, the little fuckhead was running something

119
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,741
and he dumped it. Now he owes.

120
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,443
Who? Who does he owe?

121
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,748
Tim Briggs.

122
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,913
Ask around, see what you can find out, all right?

123
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,690
How is Kate?

124
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,089
Not good.

125
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,160
I can't believe he did that.

126
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,393
When I quit, I told him to stay away from these guys.

127
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,162
Please, if you had anything to do with this, just tell me right now.

128
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,260
I just told you.

129
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,598
Okay.

130
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,367
He's my little brother.

131
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:03,140
I know. I'm going to take care of it.

132
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,298
I got you.

133
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,402
I'll call you in the morning.

134
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,070
Okay, no problem.

135
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,442
Good night.

136
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,781
So you said King Security put the system in?

137
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,283
That's right. A lot of good it did.

138
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,852
It's a decent system, but your locks are a joke.

139
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,218
Anybody who knows the response time

140
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:19,848
is going to be able to get in and out.

141
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,984
Can you excuse me for one second, sir?

142
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,051
Yes.

143
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,131
It's about Briggs, Kyle's brother.

144
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,187
Yeah, and?

145
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,698
I don't know, hold on.

146
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,064
Guys! Guys! How are we doing today?

147
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:35,638
Is my office still going to be done last week?

148
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,369
You having a nice morning?

149
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,532
Good!

150
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,770
Briggs got out of prison two months ago.

151
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,336
He hangs out at the Old Point Bar.

152
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,008
I'll pop over there after I'm done work and see if I can talk to him.

153
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,246
Sorry about that, sir.

154
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,320
The cameras are nice and small,

155
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,787
they'll fit right up there in the corner.

156
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,023
Oh, shit!

157
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,185
Chris Farraday, back from the dead, man! Yeah!

158
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,756
Good to see you, man.

159
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,291
Oh, shit. This man was a world-class smuggler here.

160
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,799
You were fucking Houdini, man.

161
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:42,273
Yeah, he used to run with my brother, God rest his miserable soul.

162
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,666
Too bad your skill didn't rub off

163
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,211
on your shithead brother-in-law.

164
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,678
No, I know, he's a fuck-up.

165
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,715
Mmm. But he's my wife's little brother.

166
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,648
I was hoping you understand it's family,

167
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:54,014
maybe we could work something out.

168
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,109
Well, I don't know. What do you want to work out?

169
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,951
You want to work out something with me?

170
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,024
I can figure out a way to pay you back the buy money.

171
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,294
No, that's worth 700 grand to me.

172
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,123
Oh, come on, man. No, come on, man.

173
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,597
You're going to try to charge me full freight for a bad run?

174
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,464
Customs boards the boat, you dump that shit. You know how it goes.

175
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,104
You know how many passes I gave your brother in his day?

176
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,831
Yeah, I hated my brother.

177
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,540
What do you want to do, a payment plan?

178
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,099
What, do I look like a bank to you?

179
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,339
No, I was just hoping you could be fucking reasonable, here.

180
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,641
Hey! This ain't your world anymore, man!

181
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,482
You're a tourist, you can't trade on status you don't have.

182
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,780
I got bills to pay.

183
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,653
You know, when people fuck that up, that's their fucking problem.

184
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,716
You think that's funny? You got bills?

185
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,297
I like your outfit.

186
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,335
I liked your brother.

187
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,741
We're here today, that's the important thing.

188
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,674
So, you know, learning to let go and let God

189
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,342
is what's been pulling me through all of this.

190
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,513
You're going to have to talk me down before I fucking kill Briggs.

191
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,548
Probably be better off.

192
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,354
I'm one drink away from the worst day of my life.

193
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,557
What should I do?

194
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,292
...sitting in this circle that's had that same thought, right?

195
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,825
That's all you gotta do, is work the steps.

196
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,836
I'm not doing another run.

197
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,671
No fucking way.

198
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,005
I could probably get us the buy money, no problem.

199
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,338
No, I finally got something going.

200
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,241
I'm not going to chance fucking it up.

201
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,280
It's not going away, Chris.

202
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,045
Does somebody want to share?

203
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,187
Sebastian? Want to share a little bit with us?

204
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:38,018
Okay. Oh, yeah.

205
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,079
Go do your thing.

206
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,256
You don't want to stick around?

207
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,794
No, I get far too emotional hearing that story.

208
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,830
How are you doing, Sebastian?

209
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,266
What the hell happened?

210
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,640
Walter died last night.

211
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,309
Briggs came to the hospital.

212
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,471
He said it was all on me.

213
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,213
I keep getting calls, Chris,

214
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,777
and they're talking about how they're going to fucking torture me.

215
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:13,017
I'm shipping out in the next couple of days. I'm not coming back.

216
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:17,994
Do me a favor, and don't tell Kate. Not until I'm gone.

217
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,553
When I stopped doing runs,

218
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,098
you promised me you were gonna stay out of this shit.

219
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,326
What do you want me to say, man?

220
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,457
Not a fucking word!

221
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,698
I didn't have anybody to tell me I was fucking up. You do!

222
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,700
And you put your sister and the boys in this shit?

223
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,539
What the fuck is wrong with you?

224
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:22,916
Whoa.

225
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,990
You don't come to my fucking place.

226
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,292
I just came to tell you

227
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:28,560
that I'm going to have your money within a month.

228
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,656
Just stay away from Andy.

229
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,066
I ain't waiting that long.

230
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,238
Well, I ain't paying if he's dead.

231
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,306
If a guy dies owing something,

232
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,809
his family inherits the debt.

233
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,878
So I'll give you two weeks.

234
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,881
If not, I'm going to come after the both of you.

235
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,209
Then, all the way down the line.

236
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,649
I'll come asking your wife for it, your kids...

237
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,357
Do you think you're the only guy with a fucking gun?

238
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,088
You'll get your fucking money.

239
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,961
But if you ever mention my wife

240
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,864
and my kids again, you're done.

241
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:06,004
You hear me? You are fucking done!

242
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,467
Daddy.

243
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,597
It's okay, sweetie. Go back inside.

244
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,507
It's okay, sweetie. Daddy and I were just playing, okay?

245
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,307
It's okay. Yeah, we're just playing.

246
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,678
Yeah, me and Daddy were just fucking playing.

247
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:18,943
Get up there.

248
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:21,775
Yeah, we'll play again.

249
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,309
Daddy is okay.

250
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,680
It's all right.

251
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,719
What the fuck are you looking at?

252
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,520
You stay in the car, I'll go talk to her.

253
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,710
Okay.

254
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,766
Hey, Chris. Hey, how are you?

255
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:10,890
Hi.

256
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,061
Hey.

257
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,536
Everything okay?

258
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,764
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.

259
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:16,863
Okay.

260
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,118
I got to get on the ship with Andy and try to fix this.

261
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,314
Are you fucking kidding?

262
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,856
What am I going to do, let him go alone?

263
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,414
No, we're going to think of something else.

264
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,527
There's nothing else to do, okay?

265
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,721
I hate to tell you,

266
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,661
but that little dumb fuck has put us

267
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,562
in the worst possible position, okay?

268
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,192
And if they don't get the money from him, they're coming after us.

269
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,497
So what else do you want me to do?

270
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,866
You know what I don't want to do?

271
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,770
I don't want to fucking visit you in jail like we're visiting your dad,

272
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,069
and raising those kids on my own.

273
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,542
So it's my...

274
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,407
I don't want to fight with you about this, okay?

275
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,450
I know what I'm doing, all right?

276
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,486
Will you just trust me?

277
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,178
Please?

278
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,291
Nothing is going to happen.

279
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:09,952
All right? I promise. Mmm.

280
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,074
That shitbag Briggs was here for a couple of years.

281
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,909
He tried to smash some guy's head in with a cinder block.

282
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,142
Look, I mentioned this to Sebastian.

283
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,746
We're doing another run.

284
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,311
Can you get me on your old boat?

285
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,588
You mean the Borden?

286
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:43,858
Remember when you were little, you and Sebastian,

287
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,853
you broke into McTier's warehouse,

288
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,093
stole all that Mardi Gras jewelry,

289
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,499
and you came back to the house with a great big box of them beads?

290
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,805
You thought they were diamonds.

291
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:58,808
You were grinning like you just won the fucking lottery.

292
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,808
And you said,

293
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,972
"You don't have to work on that boat no more."

294
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,314
I always think about that.

295
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:16,526
The proudest day of my life was when you turned legit,

296
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,331
and you started your own business, and you got out of the life.

297
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:26,797
I know you got to do what you got to do.

298
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,766
I got it.

299
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,578
Family is family.

300
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,407
I'll get you on the boat.

301
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,949
But you get in,

302
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,878
you got to get back out.

303
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,089
Me and Andy are shipping out to Panama with the Borden.

304
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,146
The old man's boat?

305
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,281
Yeah, he got us on.

306
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,520
What about Captain Camp?

307
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,254
I know. I know. Don't worry about it.

308
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,622
What's this?

309
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,689
What's what?

310
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,928
Every time I come here, you got new shit.

311
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,495
I'm getting it together, I'm getting the place ready.

312
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,198
It's a bad-ass coffee table.

313
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,139
That is not for shoes.

314
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,371
I must be out of touch. I don't know what's bad-ass anymore

315
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,469
because this looks cheap-ass.

316
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,071
You're turning into The Birdcage.

317
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,138
I mean...

318
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,752
So who do we know in Panama?

319
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,413
Are you going to go see Ruben?

320
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,084
Dude, no drugs.

321
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,517
What else has that kind of profit margin?

322
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,252
Edwin is in Panama.

323
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,557
Currency?

324
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,121
We have to bring back a shit-ton to make it worth our while.

325
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,292
All right, so I'll bring back a shit-ton.

326
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,633
Okay, 15 million on four stacks this big.

327
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,331
It's like the size of a Mini Cooper.

328
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,499
Where are you going to hide it?

329
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,007
That's my problem.

330
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:39,733
I need the Borden's crew manifest.

331
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,840
Oh, God. You got to be kidding me.

332
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,887
Oh, I like Tarik Mortin. He's a horrible chef, but he's great on runs.

333
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,221
Le Cloud's a fucking drunk.

334
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,652
Newlywed?

335
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,094
He's not great on runs, but we've known him a long time.

336
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,767
Olaf's solid, we need somebody in the engine room.

337
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,628
Well, it's no A-Team, but it's the best we can do.

338
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:09,037
Come on, work your magic. Make the call, get me a TWIC card.

339
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,435
Hi, sweet pea.

340
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,275
I need you to push through a TWIC card for Chris Farraday.

341
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,916
I got your message. It only took you three years to call me?

342
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,449
Are you back in business?

343
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,582
No, no, no, no, no.

344
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,819
I need something, though.

345
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,088
Remember our last run? The funny money?

346
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,458
I need that exact same shit by next week, but a lot more.

347
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,192
Four times as much.

348
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,563
And we need a van big enough to transport it, okay?

349
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,298
Okay. I'll be here.

350
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:42,602
Come on, Mikey!

351
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:43,832
What's funny money?

352
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,570
Huh? Nothing. That's just work stuff for Dad.

353
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,246
Have you ever been convicted of espionage?

354
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,444
Just answer yes or no, we'll get through this really quickly.

355
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:54,541
No.

356
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:59,147
Sedition, or conspiracy to commit espionage, sedition, treason?

357
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,484
Together?

358
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,424
I received your shipping application, Mr...

359
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:05,656
Lakowski.

360
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,627
Mr. Lakowski.

361
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:11,931
Senor Lakowski, I'm getting you a 20-foot standard dry.

362
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:13,566
Would you like us to load it?

363
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,266
No, I've got somebody to take care of that. I just need the container.

364
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:17,634
Okay, we'll leave the container

365
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,472
standing by for you at the port of Panama.

366
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:20,772
And what are you shipping?

367
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:21,971
A van.

368
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,029
Here you go.

369
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,404
It takes money to make money, baby.

370
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,234
Thank you.

371
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,213
Don't sink, Daddy.

372
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,517
Okay, buddy.

373
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,489
You're going to miss my playoff game.

374
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,722
I know. I'm sorry.

375
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:14,355
Your mom is going to take lots of pictures for me, okay?

376
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,627
You guys are in charge till I get back.

377
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,599
I love you, guys.

378
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,341
Just come home, okay?

379
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,603
Thank you for doing this, Chris.

380
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:31,342
I love you. Love you, too.

381
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:33,211
It's going to be okay.

382
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:39,018
ID, please. Finger on the scanner.

383
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,320
Captain Camp. Get the trunk.

384
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,929
Get that Captain's carpet cleaner up to the bridge.

385
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,231
John, you want to give me a hand?

386
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:44,750
Hey!

387
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,755
You're up top. I get the bottom bunk.

388
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,291
Yeah, no kidding.

389
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,966
Don't act like you don't like this shit.

390
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,609
Why, is it that obvious?

391
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,972
I love it, but don't tell your sister.

392
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:14,212
All right, come on. You can get your beauty rest later, let's go.

393
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:15,308
My arm, my arm.

394
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:25,996
Keep an eye out.

395
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,900
Hey, someone's coming.

396
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,023
What's up, Chris?

397
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,358
Hi, Chris.

398
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,831
Chris.

399
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,126
Look at this motherfucker.

400
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,202
Olaf. Good to see you, man.

401
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,398
What's up, Tarik? You okay?

402
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,463
What's up, man?

403
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,841
How's your folks? Everybody's good? Good, good.

404
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,206
That's a hungry man's appetite.

405
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,336
This is real good.

406
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,402
How you doing, buddy?

407
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,448
What the fuck are you doing on my ship?

408
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,544
Did you even check the goddamn crew manifest?

409
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,023
How the fuck do you let Bud Farraday's spawn aboard my ship?

410
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,082
DHS cleared him. He was added at the last minute.

411
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,423
All right, I'm demoting him to ship's boy.

412
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,485
Yes, sir.

413
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,922
You scrub dirt and stay the fuck out of my sight.

414
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,865
Otherwise you might have an accident,

415
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,334
and wind up in the drink.

416
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,201
Show him where the carpet cleaner is.

417
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,502
Yes, sir.

418
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,236
Oh, man, carpet cleaner.

419
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,806
Let's go, Rug Doctor.

420
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,208
Oh, you got promoted? They gave you some new stripes on there.

421
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,515
I'll be ship's boy. You're still Captain's bitch boy.

422
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:58,577
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:42,922
Okay.

424
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:44,331
Yes, sir.

425
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:24,007
Everybody's drinking tall boys, and nobody's fucking working.

426
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,331
What's up, man?

427
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:26,671
Are you bringing the Captain in on this or what?

428
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:27,733
Fuck, no.

429
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,374
Well, I remember talking to your pops in this same room.

430
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:34,040
He said that same shit. We know how that turned out.

431
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,551
Do you trust me or not?

432
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,813
I do. I do.

433
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,115
So what are we running?

434
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:43,524
A shipping pallet loaded up with 5,000 uncut sheets of super notes.

435
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,118
Best counterfeit money can buy.

436
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:47,562
And just how the hell do you think we're going to stow that much shit?

437
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,791
You worried, buddy? I mean, where is the faith?

438
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,594
What, I lost my stripes? Now I got to start from scratch?

439
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,365
Exactly, that shit's void.

440
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,427
No problem.

441
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,701
Come on, I'll show you.

442
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:08,810
What do you think?

443
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:11,047
Looks good. Chris, you're a crazy fucker.

444
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,919
Not bad? Huh? Sixty cubic feet.

445
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:17,654
No fucking way. No, it's bigger than 60.

446
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,229
Ah, shit! Yeah, man, this is much bigger than 60.

447
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:21,356
We got company.

448
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,089
Quick, quick, quick!

449
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,791
Hey, what are you doing? Chris, stop!

450
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,268
Andy, be quiet in there.

451
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,604
Come on, come on!

452
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:34,910
What the hell are you doing in here?

453
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,378
I needed a scraper. We noticed some mold in the lower hull.

454
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:38,881
The bleach wasn't cutting it, so...

455
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,714
Well, you shouldn't be dicking around in here. Get going.

456
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:45,913
I was just trying to keep it clean for you, boss.

457
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,979
Hey, Chris! Chris!

458
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,821
Bring it right back up! Come on, you got it!

459
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,517
You got it, come on!

460
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,387
I can't do it.

461
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:27,453
God damn.

462
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,695
Are you getting on?

463
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,861
No.

464
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,336
Do you want me to put you back in the box?

465
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,030
That's not funny.

466
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,870
I could have suffocated in that box.

467
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,931
"I really could have..."

468
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,900
Leave the kid alone, man.

469
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:42,309
How are you going to pull this shit off?

470
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,412
We're delivering 300 or so containers. Yeah.

471
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:48,418
We're picking up 500 or more. We're not going to be in port that long.

472
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:51,546
So we got to drive out to Chorrillo, see Edwin, load up the bills,

473
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,419
and then drive back to the boat during rush hour.

474
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,958
It's going to be tight, but we're going to be good.

475
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,584
It's going to be too tight. We're cutting it close.

476
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,458
Might not have enough time.

477
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,988
We'll buy more time.

478
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,692
Controllable pitch propeller.

479
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,099
Oh, yeah. Pitch propeller.

480
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,465
Can you drain the oil supply?

481
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,466
The hydraulic chamber won't work.

482
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,034
That's the point, stupid ass.

483
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:11,966
Look.

484
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,472
We can do it while being towed through the locks.

485
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,773
It will buy us a couple of hours.

486
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,677
Okay? I don't know.

487
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,272
I hate when we fuck with the boat.

488
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:20,612
What?

489
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:23,153
I said, I hate when we fuck with the boat.

490
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,209
Take it easy, big bear.

491
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,482
Olaf, fuck with the boat.

492
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,423
Take it easy. Easy.

493
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,515
What the fuck?

494
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,425
Tarik. That motherfucker will eat you.

495
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,525
Okay, out you come.

496
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:43,039
Do you want to get any of these for me? Do we have to?

497
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,096
Yes, Mom.

498
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,335
Yeah? Okay.

499
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:29,682
Hello?

500
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,382
Can I help you?

501
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,350
You're pretty.

502
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,688
Do you want to play?

503
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:40,990
Okay. Bye, asshole.

504
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:46,500
Pay the money, just like you owe me.

505
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:47,901
What the fuck are you all looking at?

506
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,268
Yeah, you like that?

507
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,363
Get your fucking hands off me!

508
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:56,577
Come on, put the knife down. Put the knife down.

509
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,308
Put the knife down.

510
00:33:58,437 --> 00:33:59,507
Leave my mommy alone!

511
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:02,211
Get the fuck back over there! Sit your fucking ass down!

512
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,151
It's okay, I'm just playing, now.

513
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,779
I'm just playing.

514
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:07,118
Yeah, don't cry.

515
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:10,287
You seen a gun before? You want it?

516
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,521
There ain't going to be no playing when I come back next week.

517
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,188
You can tell your husband that.

518
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,891
You want this? Get out!

519
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,134
- No! - What the fuck?

520
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:24,197
Get the fuck out of my house! Get the fuck out of my house!

521
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,140
Put that thing down, man!

522
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,142
You don't think the police are going to be coming now?

523
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,508
Get the fuck out of here!

524
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,844
I didn't mean to shoot at him. The little shit hit the gun.

525
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,145
You want to send me back to the farm, you stupid bitch?

526
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,652
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

527
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,003
All right, careful. Not too much.

528
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,006
We don't want to jam it. I got it.

529
00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:59,337
Chris Farraday, to the bridge.

530
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,672
Here.

531
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,573
He's on his way.

532
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,079
Not too much.

533
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,274
All right.

534
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,948
I wasn't getting reception on your cell.

535
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,921
Chris, these guys came to the house. They had guns.

536
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,754
Jesus, are you okay? Are the boys okay?

537
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,085
Yeah, we're okay. We're freaked out.

538
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,092
I think one of them was Tim Briggs, Kyle's brother.

539
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:26,432
I didn't call the police, I don't want them here asking questions.

540
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:27,562
Call Sebastian, okay?

541
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:30,973
Yeah, okay, I will.

542
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,638
All right, I love you. Call him.

543
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,614
Trouble with the missus, Farraday?

544
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,584
Do you want me to talk to her for you?

545
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,863
Hey, guys, you okay? You had a scary day?

546
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,920
Mmm-hmm.

547
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,896
You know what? Why don't you guys

548
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,299
just come and stay at my place?

549
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,529
They're not going to be back, but just for my own peace of mind.

550
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:02,594
You think?

551
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,073
Really? Okay.

552
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,173
Slow ahead.

553
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:16,375
I said, slow ahead! Reduce to half speed!

554
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,489
Why are we not slowing down?

555
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,695
Oil pressure's down.

556
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,628
All right. Keep an eye on that temperature.

557
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,791
Full astern!

558
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,562
Full astern, Captain.

559
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,832
Yeah, Captain? Full astern!

560
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,099
We're going to hit the fucking dock!

561
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:38,869
I'm trying, but I got no pitch control. The fucking prop is jammed!

562
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,242
You drained too much oil out! I didn't want you to crash the boat!

563
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:45,304
What?

564
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:51,680
Come on! I'm not getting any oil pressure!

565
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,852
Let go the port anchor!

566
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,695
Jesus, fucking...

567
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:04,995
Let go the fucking port anchor!

568
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,101
Did you release the brake?

569
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:11,397
Get out of the way! Move!

570
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:15,636
Turn starboard!

571
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,305
It's too late! Hard to port, Luke! Hard to port!

572
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:28,152
I'm going to have to kill the engine!

573
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:38,096
Fucking...

574
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:53,805
We're going to hit!

575
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,292
What the fuck is going on around here?

576
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,427
What the fuck happened?

577
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:15,528
Propeller jam.

578
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:17,905
Someone tampered with it.

579
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,271
I don't think so.

580
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,144
Someone tampered with it.

581
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,220
Sorry about that oil thing.

582
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:07,848
Don't worry about it.

583
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,654
It will buy us a little more time.

584
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:17,260
Hey, Michael, look. It's like a spaceship over here.

585
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,595
Wow, Sebastian, it's amazing in here.

586
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,160
Yeah? It's coming along, right?

587
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,863
I forgot you haven't been here since the renovation.

588
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,805
Hey, don't touch that.

589
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:30,112
Fellas, you hang on to this.

590
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,214
Okay, that's good.

591
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:36,842
Good aim.

592
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,722
Hey, everything okay?

593
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,052
Yeah we're at Sebastian's.

594
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:43,418
Are the boys okay?

595
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:45,826
Yeah. Are you in Panama already?

596
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,625
Yeah. Keep your phone on you.

597
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:48,687
I love you.

598
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,529
I love you, too. I'll call you on my way back.

599
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:55,872
We're almost there.

600
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:39,811
Hey! Whoa!

601
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,741
You got a lot of pussy in here.

602
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:43,150
Good to see you, man.

603
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,887
Everything good? Yeah.

604
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,251
Good, you got the cash, the van?

605
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:47,651
Si, si. Cool.

606
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:48,814
Yeah.

607
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:07,733
Whoa.

608
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,147
What, you don't trust me?

609
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,792
Oh, I trust you.

610
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:31,923
Esta bueno?

611
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,466
No, it's no fucking bueno.

612
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,938
Andy, wait here. Danny, come on.

613
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,582
Hey, what is it? What are you doing?

614
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:51,848
I need some iodine.

615
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,150
The ink is OVI, the layers are right,

616
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,246
but that paper felt different.

617
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,882
Hey, quepasa? What's going on?

618
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,119
You better hope I'm wrong.

619
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:16,173
You fucking idiots didn't print this on starch-free paper.

620
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:17,907
I'm sorry, man. This is the best I have.

621
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,107
I don't have time for this.

622
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,774
I told you on the phone,

623
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,841
I needed exactly what you sold me last time.

624
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:26,518
Gonzalo. Gonzalo has it at the warehouse.

625
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:28,615
Gonzalo? That little shithead who works for Jesus?

626
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,058
No. There's no more Jesus.

627
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:32,620
Gonzalo is running things now.

628
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,761
Why didn't you send me to him in the first place?

629
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,390
Are you fucking playing games with me? Are you fucking playing...

630
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:40,800
I tried! But he doesn't want anybody going there!

631
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:41,963
No, no, no.

632
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,028
We're going to the warehouse. Let's go.

633
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,129
No, no, no, no, no.

634
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:45,196
Chris.

635
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:47,800
Hey, Chris, man, look, take the van, man. I'm sorry.

636
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:49,673
Come on, Mikey!

637
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,749
Man, the sun's really killing me.

638
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,751
That kid is big. He is. Number 11 is a big kid.

639
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,184
Hold on, I got to take this.

640
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:58,310
Okay.

641
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,090
Hey, man, what's up?

642
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:03,684
He didn't have them.

643
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:04,818
All right.

644
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,194
Well, I guess you're going to have to bring in some candy.

645
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:09,859
I'm not bringing in drugs.

646
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:10,922
Just go and see Ruben.

647
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:13,595
I told you, I'm not bringing in drugs. Okay. It's not an option.

648
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:15,535
Chris, Chris, Chris, I'm begging you. Please.

649
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,631
Chris? Yeah, Chris?

650
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,374
Put him in the fucking van.

651
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,744
You know, you come back empty-handed,

652
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,211
Andy's going to get fucking hit,

653
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:25,145
and you're still gonna have to come up with the goddamn money.

654
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:27,505
Look, I'll figure it out, okay?

655
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:29,345
Just keep Briggs away from my family, please.

656
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:30,784
Yeah, of course.

657
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:36,957
Hey, I got a little problem at work I got to take care of.

658
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:38,619
See you later, buddy.

659
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:39,753
Bye, Sebastian. Everything okay?

660
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:41,354
Yeah, everything's fine. You got your key?

661
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:42,454
Yeah.

662
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:49,197
I'm telling you, man. Stay away from Gonzalo.

663
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,469
He's been acting crazy lately, since he became a boss.

664
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,575
Stay away from him.

665
00:43:58,336 --> 00:43:59,747
Chris, we should have listened to him.

666
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,580
We got less than an hour to get back to the boat. It ain't going to work.

667
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,779
It will work.

668
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,980
I mean, do you even know where Gonzalo's warehouse is?

669
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,655
We're in fucking Chorrillo right now.

670
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:10,420
I'm looking for something to remind me.

671
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,459
We're going to find it.

672
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,458
Here we go. Here we go. Look, right here! Here!

673
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:22,836
Mortin. Yeah, Cap?

674
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,168
Where the hell is Farraday?

675
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,366
I don't know, Cap.

676
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,104
I didn't know I had to babysit him today. I didn't get the memo.

677
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,474
Don't piss me off, Mortin.

678
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:30,945
You'll be flipping shit-burgers at McDonald's

679
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,447
before you can say "minimum wage."

680
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,147
I'm sorry, Cap. Sorry.

681
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:58,364
That little visit you paid Kate, the kids, Chris' family?

682
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,568
That's my family.

683
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:02,736
You stay away from them. Are we clear?

684
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:15,916
Hi, Sadie.

685
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:17,515
Hi.

686
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:22,664
You know, if you had hired a real smuggler instead of Andy,

687
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,860
our package would have come in when it was supposed to.

688
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,426
You know, I'm really sorry about that.

689
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:30,131
Do you know how fucked up things are for me right now?

690
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,538
I know. He said he knew what he was doing.

691
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:35,373
I didn't know he was his brother-in-law.

692
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,243
Hey, man, this is way more high-risk

693
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:14,806
than I originally anticipated.

694
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:17,114
I got a wife now. I like my wife.

695
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,753
Yeah, I got a wife, too, okay?

696
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,021
And don't worry about Gonzalo.

697
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,025
I know him, he's a little fucking punk. Don't worry about it.

698
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,027
Oh, yeah? I heard stories about this dude

699
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,585
cutting people's heads off and shit.

700
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,773
I'm looking for Gonzalo.

701
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:05,530
Andy, stay in the van with the bag.

702
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:14,275
Danny, it's all good. I know this guy, come on.

703
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,795
You have one new message.

704
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:37,129
Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching your sister's kid play soccer.

705
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,189
You don't call me back,

706
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:41,760
I'm gonna walk out on that field and put a bullet in his head.

707
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:03,748
Chris.

708
00:48:03,848 --> 00:48:05,259
Don't... Stop talking.

709
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:06,795
Like I said, I want you to take

710
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,455
the buy money and go to that address,

711
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,396
and talk to a gentleman named Ruben.

712
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,490
If you ever want to see your little nephew again,

713
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,470
you take the package and you bring it back, all right?

714
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:40,692
Hey, is that a wolf?

715
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,197
That ain't no fucking dog.

716
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:47,062
Excuse me, senor. Do you mind?

717
00:48:55,934 --> 00:48:57,072
Where is he?

718
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,770
Where is my old friend Farraday?

719
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:00,843
Bring the van around.

720
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:02,612
Sorry for showing up unannounced.

721
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:04,312
Edwin was trying to play games with me.

722
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,820
Where's my buddy Jesus?

723
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,353
We fed him to the wolves.

724
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,781
What, literally?

725
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,486
I am the new Jesus, cabron.

726
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,965
It's good to see you.

727
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:18,159
You, too.

728
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,459
What do you think?

729
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:24,431
It's all mine, motherfucker.

730
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:27,342
All those assholes who thought I was shit?

731
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:28,672
They're dead por culeros.

732
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:34,342
We're taking down a truck.

733
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:36,879
It's a big one. An armored truck.

734
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:38,481
Do you want to join us? Huh?

735
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:39,783
Are you serious?

736
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:46,056
Andy?

737
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:48,861
Andy!

738
00:49:50,788 --> 00:49:52,267
Oh, fuck.

739
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:53,863
Andy!

740
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:15,484
He charges...

741
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:18,049
Michael, not in the house. We're guests.

742
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:21,225
Look at young Daddy.

743
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:22,763
He shoots!

744
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,228
He scores!

745
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,635
Go find your mom.

746
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:39,379
You ain't fucking around, huh? Looks like you're ready for anything.

747
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:41,383
Are you going to war or something?

748
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:45,312
I told you. We're taking down a truck. Fucking rock and roll.

749
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,514
No shit. You got all these guys.

750
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:49,023
What the fuck is in that truck, man?

751
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,115
You want to know?

752
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:52,320
Then maybe you should show these assholes how it's done.

753
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,384
No, look...

754
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:55,158
I'll give you the super notes for free.

755
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,961
Yeah, thanks anyway. But I got a boat to catch, so...

756
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,467
Come on. Don't tell me you don't miss this shit.

757
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,664
I got two kids now, man, you know? My cowboy days are over.

758
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:05,236
Come on, Danny!

759
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:09,741
The money's gone.

760
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,907
And Andy.

761
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:12,970
What?

762
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:15,014
What the fuck are you talking about?

763
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,492
You come in here and treat me like an asshole?

764
00:51:33,057 --> 00:51:35,401
No, primo, I wouldn't do that, man.

765
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,240
I should fucking blow your brains out.

766
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,522
Does that offer still stand?

767
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,153
We ride with you, I get the super notes for free?

768
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:08,999
Yeah, there's something you can do for us.

769
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,637
Grab their wallets.

770
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:13,103
Give him your wallet.

771
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:14,768
Give me their IDs.

772
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:21,413
We're being fined every minute longer we sit here, Captain.

773
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,610
Yep.

774
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:23,947
We got to take that...

775
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:28,784
- Captain. - What's the status?

776
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,451
Pitch propeller overheated. It needs oil. We're working on it.

777
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:32,925
You got 10 minutes!

778
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:44,429
It's Olaf.

779
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,138
Chris, you have got 10 minutes.

780
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,166
That's not long enough.

781
00:52:48,232 --> 00:52:49,711
Have Tarik delay the loading.

782
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,713
Just stall them for as long as you can, okay?

783
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,806
Get here. I'll do what I can.

784
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:02,586
See, Chris? This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.

785
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:04,354
Exactly.

786
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,627
I mean, what are we supposed to be doing here?

787
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,164
Blocking the truck.

788
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:11,558
Right. That's awesome.

789
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:14,000
We're blocking the truck.

790
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,329
Like human speed bumps.

791
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:20,134
Tell my wife that...

792
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,905
Will you shut the fuck up?

793
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:24,940
Look, we're going to get through this, okay?

794
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:27,004
I'm not telling your wife shit!

795
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,755
Okay, ready. They're coming.

796
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:46,960
Put your seatbelt on.

797
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:49,469
He's coming down. Here we go.

798
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:55,467
Fuck.

799
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:09,082
Is he going to slow down?

800
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:10,284
Yeah, he's going to slow down.

801
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:11,986
You said he's going to slow down! He's gonna slow down.

802
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:13,084
He's not slowing down!

803
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,595
Shit!

804
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:20,463
Fuck!

805
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,664
Are you all right?

806
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:45,319
Oh, my God.

807
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:57,428
Oh, fuck!

808
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:01,265
Get down!

809
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:12,282
Danny, are you okay?

810
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:32,836
I need you to hold containers D, E and F, until I say so.

811
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:34,308
I'm going to pay you $100, yeah?

812
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:48,651
Fuck!

813
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,055
You got to be fucking kidding me!

814
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:15,806
Fuck!

815
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:22,952
Get down, Chris!

816
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,014
Fuck!

817
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:38,662
Hold on.

818
00:56:38,763 --> 00:56:40,140
What the fuck are we doing, dude?

819
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:41,267
Wait, wait, wait!

820
00:56:51,442 --> 00:56:52,614
Come on!

821
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:56,885
Shit!

822
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:16,576
Shit! Danny, come on, we're going!

823
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:18,870
Come on, Danny, let's go! Shit!

824
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:34,491
Fuck!

825
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:41,392
What now?

826
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:51,802
Fuck!

827
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,565
Andy, where's Chris?

828
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:16,931
Andy!

829
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:33,316
Come on, we got to move!

830
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:39,852
What are you doing?

831
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:51,166
We got to get our IDs.

832
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:52,671
- Hospital. - Oh, shit!

833
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:55,611
Take me to the fucking hospital.

834
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:58,006
Oh, shit. Danny, help.

835
00:58:58,168 --> 00:58:59,647
Come on, lay down.

836
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:03,377
Hold him, hold him!

837
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,008
Oh, shit! Is he dead?

838
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,103
He's dead!

839
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:34,080
If he's fucking dead, throw him out the van.

840
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:36,084
Wait, wait! Get our IDs!

841
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:37,811
You got them? Yeah.

842
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,377
Toss him out!

843
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:45,554
Okay, boys, let's warm her up.

844
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,069
How much time do you think we have?

845
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:00,837
No time.

846
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:07,208
Get those containers aboard or we're leaving without them.

847
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,543
Chris, where the fuck are you, man? The ship's leaving.

848
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:10,813
Just hold the ship, we're coming.

849
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:11,978
Just get your ass over here!

850
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,214
All right.

851
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:16,114
Any crew member hasn't come aboard yet,

852
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:17,283
you make sure they get searched

853
01:00:17,348 --> 01:00:18,383
before you let them on, you got me?

854
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,028
All right, come on, it's going to open up.

855
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,326
Are we going to make it?

856
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:25,867
Yeah, he's holding the container for us.

857
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:28,096
Come on. Go, go, go!

858
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:38,808
I'm coming. Open the container.

859
01:00:38,902 --> 01:00:41,712
When you come to let us out, bring something to clean up a bit of a mess.

860
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:43,547
Don't forget the seals! Okay.

861
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:44,813
Shit.

862
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,283
Yeah, yeah. Here we go.

863
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,857
Get the fuck out of the way!

864
01:00:57,021 --> 01:00:58,694
Come on, get your ass in here!

865
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:00,899
Fuck! Fuck!

866
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:01,959
Shit!

867
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:09,572
Wait, stop!

868
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:10,941
Come on!

869
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:14,580
The fucking doors are open!

870
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:15,639
Oh, fuck!

871
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:20,714
I got it.

872
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:29,962
Oh, fuck!

873
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,269
Hold up. What's the rush?

874
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:46,405
Come on.

875
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,643
I just left some food on, you know? Come on, Jack.

876
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:51,117
Captain has got us searching everybody that got off.

877
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:10,636
Hey, where are you going?

878
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:12,398
I just stowed some decent beef.

879
01:02:12,463 --> 01:02:13,669
Ooh! Thank God.

880
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:15,835
That shit you made last night was like chewing ass.

881
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:16,934
Yeah, you would know.

882
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,308
Fuck you, Tarik.

883
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:20,437
Come on.

884
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:21,847
You got the cleaning stuff? Yeah.

885
01:02:21,939 --> 01:02:23,111
You got the seals? Yeah.

886
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:26,052
All right, we got on late. They're definitely going to check this.

887
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:28,449
Holy shit!

888
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:29,889
Let's go, baby.

889
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,623
Will do.

890
01:02:37,488 --> 01:02:39,399
Customs and Border Protection, Captain.

891
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:43,028
They want us to take a look at some containers that were loaded late.

892
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:45,164
All right, let's go.

893
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,230
Call in the Second.

894
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:12,300
Let's go, Danny. Let's go.

895
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:13,460
Where are we looking, Chief?

896
01:03:13,524 --> 01:03:15,902
The container right up here, Captain.

897
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:23,770
812504.

898
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:25,711
812...

899
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:27,173
Sorry, Captain.

900
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,212
Next.

901
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:37,848
Oh, shit.

902
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,529
I'm gonna check the heating coils... Wait, wait!

903
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:42,859
...I'm gonna need a couple of minutes.

904
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,024
Come on, let's go.

905
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,900
2727.

906
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:50,199
812729.

907
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:55,134
Oh! Shit, rats!

908
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,302
Shut it!

909
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:58,607
Watch your hand.

910
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:02,746
Yo, yo, yo!

911
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:05,480
We got a sewage leak. Call Brody, all right?

912
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,090
All right, let's go.

913
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,561
We got two more containers up here.

914
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:39,416
Nathan-812552,

915
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:41,956
812553.

916
01:04:42,012 --> 01:04:43,753
That's it, open it.

917
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:05,004
525524.

918
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:08,540
That's the last container that was boarded.

919
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:10,846
Go on.

920
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:19,623
Anything?

921
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,887
No, sir. Smells like it was just cleaned.

922
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:24,999
All right, seal it up.

923
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,801
Customs will take it apart when we get back home.

924
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:45,645
I need to tell you...

925
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:47,689
Are you out of your fucking mind?

926
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,382
Are you fucking crazy?

927
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,322
Where's the money? Where is it?

928
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:52,826
It's gone! I had to use it.

929
01:05:52,883 --> 01:05:54,692
It's what? Where's the money?

930
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:56,196
What are you trying to...

931
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:57,491
What did you just say to me?

932
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:58,589
I had to use it.

933
01:05:58,655 --> 01:05:59,656
You what?

934
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,725
I had to use it.

935
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:03,996
It's in the ceiling.

936
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:07,071
No, you fucking...

937
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:14,779
How fucking stupid are you?

938
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:17,750
I came out here to help you, to risk my fucking freedom

939
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:20,845
and my wife and my children for this?

940
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:22,754
Motherfucker.

941
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:26,554
What the fuck am I supposed to do with all that?

942
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:28,061
You got to be the dumbest motherfucker...

943
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:30,098
He said he was going to kill Michael.

944
01:06:31,288 --> 01:06:32,358
What?

945
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:34,299
You have one saved message.

946
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:37,133
Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching your sister's kid play soccer.

947
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:38,365
You don't call me back,

948
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,806
I'm gonna walk out on that field and put a bullet in his head.

949
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,417
Get the bag.

950
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,382
Are you all right? Yeah.

951
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:55,445
You all right? You all right?

952
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,582
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

953
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,887
I'm sorry. Calm down, calm down.

954
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:18,275
- Chris. - Hey.

955
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:19,541
Everything okay? Boys all right?

956
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:21,447
Yeah, they're sleeping.

957
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:24,076
What's up? Is everything okay? Is Andy okay?

958
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:27,247
Yeah. Don't worry about it. Is Sebastian there?

959
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,425
Yeah, he is. Do you want me to get him for you?

960
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,788
No, no.

961
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:34,124
No, it's okay. Go back to sleep.

962
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:35,424
I'll call you in the morning.

963
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:37,294
Okay. I love you.

964
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:39,197
I love you, too.

965
01:07:58,442 --> 01:07:59,477
Chris?

966
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,148
Chris, I've been trying to call you. What's going on?

967
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:03,418
Andy picked something up.

968
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,584
Really? I thought we weren't doing that.

969
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:06,650
I didn't have a choice.

970
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:09,492
Thank God for Andy taking the initiative, though, huh?

971
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:10,964
Too bad I'm not bringing it in.

972
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:13,757
I'm thinking of dumping it in the sea, actually.

973
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:15,761
Why would you do that?

974
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:17,897
Then we would all be fucked!

975
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:19,564
Take it on faith.

976
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,078
I need to talk to you.

977
01:08:40,383 --> 01:08:41,726
Is something wrong?

978
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,631
I told you I would call you with an update.

979
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:49,394
You've got a few more days left

980
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,902
before I cut your head off and stick it up your ass.

981
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:55,534
And you're asking me, "Is there anything wrong?"

982
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,044
Well, I got something coming in.

983
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,617
You don't sound so sure.

984
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:07,211
I'm sure. It's coming in.

985
01:09:07,844 --> 01:09:10,290
Flying solo ain't for sidekicks, Abney.

986
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:14,762
I fucking warned you.

987
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:17,895
When you first came to me for help

988
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:19,956
in keeping your little business afloat,

989
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:22,333
I fucking warned you.

990
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:25,530
I said, "You've got to know your limitations."

991
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:28,469
"Don't live beyond your fucking means!"

992
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:33,940
I don't normally do this fucking shit.

993
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:37,518
Telling you what's going to happen when you don't pay.

994
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:40,487
What's the fucking point? You know the rules, right?

995
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,751
Right.

996
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:53,295
You take care, Abney.

997
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,319
Jack, neat.

998
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:55,490
Somebody's off the wagon.

999
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:04,136
I want you to go see Kate.

1000
01:11:04,661 --> 01:11:07,039
Man, I thought she was your family.

1001
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:10,273
You know, if you want to fuck his wife, you fuck his wife.

1002
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:12,609
But don't waste my time so you can play hero.

1003
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:14,478
Chris is falling apart out there.

1004
01:11:14,537 --> 01:11:16,278
He's going to dump the package.

1005
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:19,147
Don't touch her. Just get her attention.

1006
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,150
All right.

1007
01:11:33,023 --> 01:11:34,161
Yeah.

1008
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:56,184
Oh, man.

1009
01:11:57,714 --> 01:11:58,784
Do you think it's going to work?

1010
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:00,725
It's going to work. You think so?

1011
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:02,454
Did you take science in school, Tarik?

1012
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:03,622
Yeah.

1013
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:06,463
Then you should know salt dissolves in water, bitch.

1014
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:08,631
Are you leaving soon?

1015
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,532
Yeah, Sebastian is dropping the boys off.

1016
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:11,967
We're going home.

1017
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:14,764
Oh, that's right. Chris is coming home.

1018
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:16,066
Yeah.

1019
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:17,634
So, you'll be all smiles in the morning?

1020
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,203
I hope so.

1021
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:21,773
You get out of here, I got it.

1022
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:23,144
Good night.

1023
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:26,815
Good night. Good night, baby.

1024
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:27,980
I'll lock the door.

1025
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:29,079
Thanks.

1026
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:04,885
Oh, my God!

1027
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,658
Get the fuck away from me!

1028
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,664
My friend will be here, he'll kick your...

1029
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:17,501
I'm going to be perfectly fucking clear.

1030
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:21,474
You call your husband and you tell him not to dump it in the water!

1031
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:26,173
You tell him that you, Michael and Eddie are all depending on him.

1032
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,338
Do you understand me?

1033
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:35,678
Do you understand me?

1034
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:39,316
Stay away from my kids!

1035
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,022
He's got a gun!

1036
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:45,589
Whoa! What are you doing?

1037
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:03,308
Hey.

1038
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:11,917
Are you all right?

1039
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:15,155
Honey, I want you to get in the truck with me.

1040
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:17,027
The kids are inside, all right?

1041
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,827
You smell like alcohol.

1042
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:21,368
Yeah, I had a drink.

1043
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:23,904
You're driving my kids around drunk? Are you fucking kidding me?

1044
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:25,165
Relax. What did he say to you?

1045
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:32,103
Come on, get out. We're going in my car. Let's go.

1046
01:14:32,202 --> 01:14:34,512
Kate! Guys, get back in the car.

1047
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:36,912
Kate, what are you doing?

1048
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:41,511
Kate! Kate! Get in the truck.

1049
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:43,346
Fuck.

1050
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:45,321
He knew the kids' names.

1051
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:48,190
Hold on, you're breaking up, okay? Let me go outside.

1052
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,559
Oh, fuck.

1053
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:52,964
Cell service sucks here on the river. Hold on, I'm going outside.

1054
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:56,295
Hello? He told me to tell you...

1055
01:14:56,359 --> 01:14:58,134
No, hold on. I can't hear you.

1056
01:14:58,194 --> 01:14:59,867
He told me to tell you not to dump it in...

1057
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:01,306
He told me to tell you not to dump it.

1058
01:15:01,397 --> 01:15:02,398
Who did?

1059
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,274
Who? The asshole who came to the house!

1060
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:05,602
Who the fuck told him?

1061
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:06,703
What?

1062
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,305
Are the boys okay?

1063
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:09,909
They're here. We're at Jeanie's.

1064
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:11,782
Kate? Hello?

1065
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,577
Chris, please come home.

1066
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:17,547
Chris?

1067
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:19,854
Chris?

1068
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:24,292
Hey, how did it go?

1069
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:26,230
We boarded up the front window.

1070
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:29,236
The cops took a report. They're looking for the guy.

1071
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:30,327
All right.

1072
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:31,428
They want to talk to you.

1073
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:36,433
Yeah. I'm going to go by in the morning.

1074
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:38,501
They want to talk to you now.

1075
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:42,845
But we have no stuff. I've got to go to Sebastian's to get our stuff.

1076
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:44,816
Would you mind watching the boys for a second?

1077
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,217
Look at your forehead.

1078
01:15:46,276 --> 01:15:48,256
Are you sure you don't need me to take you to the hospital?

1079
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:51,622
No, it's just... It looks worse than it is.

1080
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:54,955
It just hurts. Like a bruise, you know?

1081
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:59,425
I think I should go now before I can't. You know what I mean?

1082
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:01,026
I'll see you in a little bit.

1083
01:16:01,124 --> 01:16:02,569
Goodbye, Mom. I love you.

1084
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:03,626
Be good boys.

1085
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:26,182
Sebastian?

1086
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:38,667
Did you tell Briggs I was going to dump it?

1087
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:41,174
No. I didn't tell nobody.

1088
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:42,365
Don't lie to me.

1089
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:44,911
Chris, I'm not fucking lying to you. I didn't say shit.

1090
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:48,346
Where did you get the drugs?

1091
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:50,678
From a guy called Ruben.

1092
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:56,216
Sebastian?

1093
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:37,191
Hey.

1094
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:39,390
Hi. I'm just getting our stuff.

1095
01:17:39,589 --> 01:17:41,865
Are you hungry? Let me make you some food.

1096
01:17:42,025 --> 01:17:43,095
No, I can't.

1097
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:45,700
The boat's not coming in. I got to get back to the boys.

1098
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:46,866
Chris will be back tonight.

1099
01:17:46,929 --> 01:17:48,602
No, he's not. He's not coming home tonight.

1100
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:51,145
I mean, the boat's not coming in for, like, I don't know, tomorrow.

1101
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,111
Chris told me that I had to take care of you,

1102
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:54,204
so I'm going to take care of you.

1103
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:56,113
Sebastian, are you not hearing me? We'll be fine, okay?

1104
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:57,207
Yeah, we're fine.

1105
01:17:57,273 --> 01:17:58,343
Okay, good. All right. Good.

1106
01:17:58,408 --> 01:17:59,614
Give me a hug.

1107
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,091
Okay. Okay.

1108
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:06,352
It's been such a big day.

1109
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:07,486
What the fuck are you doing?

1110
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:09,391
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

1111
01:18:09,452 --> 01:18:12,865
I'm trying to give my friend a fucking kiss. What's your problem?

1112
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:14,560
What's your problem? Kate, come on.

1113
01:18:14,624 --> 01:18:17,366
Look, I mean, did you even see this?

1114
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:18,462
Stop it.

1115
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:19,563
Kate.

1116
01:18:21,731 --> 01:18:22,971
How long have we known each other?

1117
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:25,612
You know what? Get your hands off me!

1118
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:28,078
Kate? Kate!

1119
01:18:28,237 --> 01:18:29,807
Leave me the fuck alone!

1120
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,710
Kate!

1121
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:33,714
Kate!

1122
01:18:33,776 --> 01:18:35,778
Jesus Christ. Kate!

1123
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:38,117
I'm trying to have a conversation with you,

1124
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:39,785
and you're acting like a fucking child.

1125
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:41,790
Okay. Good. Why don't you just walk away from the door,

1126
01:18:41,851 --> 01:18:42,852
and let me get out of here.

1127
01:18:42,919 --> 01:18:46,230
An ungrateful child. A little fucking brat, who's not grateful for...

1128
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:48,929
Do you want to talk to Chris about what a fucking bitch I am?

1129
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,834
I'm going to fucking call him on the phone right now!

1130
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:52,304
Don't call Chris.

1131
01:18:53,996 --> 01:18:55,498
Sweetheart, I love you, but open the door.

1132
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:56,600
I'm calling Chris!

1133
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:57,667
Don't mess with his head now!

1134
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:58,974
Why don't you fucking tell him?

1135
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,038
Shit!

1136
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:04,278
Honey, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1137
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,780
Kate?

1138
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:08,448
Kate, it's not funny. Stop fucking around.

1139
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:11,152
Fuck.

1140
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:19,727
You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay.

1141
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:22,797
Shit.

1142
01:19:25,495 --> 01:19:26,565
Kate?

1143
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:28,074
Kate! Kate!

1144
01:19:55,725 --> 01:19:56,760
Hey.

1145
01:19:56,859 --> 01:19:58,532
I know what you did.

1146
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,272
I know Briggs works for you.

1147
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:02,775
You stay the fuck away from my family, or I'm going to kill you.

1148
01:20:02,832 --> 01:20:04,175
You hear me?

1149
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:07,013
Just bring in the package. Everything's going to be fine.

1150
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,849
I'm not bringing in shit.

1151
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:13,478
You'll never see that fucking package.

1152
01:20:13,543 --> 01:20:14,817
You know, I didn't know about...

1153
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:17,448
I can't believe you. You fucking played me.

1154
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:18,856
I'm not playing you.

1155
01:20:18,915 --> 01:20:21,919
I'm coming. I'm coming for you.

1156
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:24,086
Okay.

1157
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:32,498
Captain Camp.

1158
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:33,563
Sebastian.

1159
01:20:33,629 --> 01:20:35,370
What do you want, Abney?

1160
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:37,776
Chris Farraday is running shit.

1161
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:40,808
Okay.

1162
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:42,542
He's going to dump the package.

1163
01:20:42,605 --> 01:20:45,017
If you make sure he doesn't, I will give you his share.

1164
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:50,382
Jesus, Abney. You are one cold rat bastard.

1165
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,160
All right.

1166
01:20:54,217 --> 01:20:55,355
But if Farraday don't give it up,

1167
01:20:55,418 --> 01:20:57,557
I'm going to call in the dogs, and your package is getting seized.

1168
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:01,158
No, he'll tell you where it is. He won't risk doing time.

1169
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:02,567
Next time you want to run shit on my ship,

1170
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,798
you do it right and pay a fare like everybody else.

1171
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:23,787
Where is it? Where's what?

1172
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,885
You're running something. I know you're running something.

1173
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:28,553
I'm not running anything, Captain.

1174
01:21:28,618 --> 01:21:30,154
You want to play that way? Check.

1175
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:31,423
This is your one chance.

1176
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:33,694
You give it up now, or you want me to call CBP?

1177
01:21:33,756 --> 01:21:34,860
I'm not running anything.

1178
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:36,733
Your wife asked me to bring some Panamanian dog shit home

1179
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:38,237
for her to eat and rub in her fucking cunt...

1180
01:21:38,294 --> 01:21:39,773
Fuck you, you piece of shit. But I didn't have time.

1181
01:21:39,829 --> 01:21:41,638
You dumb-ass motherfucker! This is how you want it?

1182
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:42,801
Yeah, this is how I want it.

1183
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:44,435
You want to go down just like your dumb-ass daddy,

1184
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,036
you piece of shit mick?

1185
01:21:46,102 --> 01:21:47,103
Fuck this.

1186
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:48,273
You made it now, motherfucker.

1187
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:49,338
Right?

1188
01:21:50,039 --> 01:21:53,179
Whatever it is, CBP is going to find it.

1189
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:59,222
Yeah, he's in the cafeteria.

1190
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:00,819
You're clear.

1191
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:35,857
Come on, come on.

1192
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:39,027
Shit! Pick up the phone, buddy.

1193
01:23:02,244 --> 01:23:05,225
Customs and Border Protection, Port of New Orleans.

1194
01:23:06,849 --> 01:23:08,624
It's Redmond, line two.

1195
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:12,357
Redmond.

1196
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:14,799
Yeah, John, I've got a good tip.

1197
01:23:15,091 --> 01:23:16,661
Somebody's making a run on my ship.

1198
01:23:16,726 --> 01:23:17,796
Really?

1199
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:19,168
All right, listen up, guys and gals,

1200
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:22,971
I want an interdiction team ready for deployment in 20 minutes.

1201
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:24,100
Let's go.

1202
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:33,847
Flight 104, copy that. Three minutes to contact.

1203
01:24:13,349 --> 01:24:14,555
Ready. Standing by.

1204
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:21,467
Holy shit!

1205
01:24:24,126 --> 01:24:25,503
Well, it was good while it lasted.

1206
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,077
Who the fuck called the cavalry in?

1207
01:24:44,814 --> 01:24:46,191
Inspection, please!

1208
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:48,888
All crew. Everybody.

1209
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:51,089
Who's in here?

1210
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:40,069
Welcome aboard.

1211
01:25:46,942 --> 01:25:48,979
All right, gentlemen, sit down.

1212
01:25:49,078 --> 01:25:50,785
What the fuck is going on?

1213
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:03,800
Larry, check the ceiling.

1214
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:10,637
Take it down.

1215
01:26:12,134 --> 01:26:13,977
Wow! Look at this.

1216
01:26:18,107 --> 01:26:19,142
There's nothing in there.

1217
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:20,243
There's nothing in there?

1218
01:26:21,076 --> 01:26:22,214
Shit!

1219
01:26:24,046 --> 01:26:25,548
That's enough.

1220
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:30,719
A tarp.

1221
01:26:32,788 --> 01:26:34,199
Tool box with nothing in it.

1222
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:37,402
You said you thought it smelled funny, right?

1223
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:38,460
Yes, Captain.

1224
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:41,531
Maybe it's just been cleaned. That's about it.

1225
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:43,673
Could be covering up something, maybe?

1226
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:44,802
Could be.

1227
01:26:57,246 --> 01:26:58,589
Watch your step.

1228
01:26:58,747 --> 01:27:00,784
Just put the carpet cleaner in the trunk.

1229
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:06,030
You got it?

1230
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:08,126
Just put it right there, that's fine.

1231
01:27:52,268 --> 01:27:53,269
Fuck.

1232
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:55,607
Oh, shit.

1233
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:02,751
The van in D-7.

1234
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:04,083
What about it?

1235
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:05,989
We're taking it apart now.

1236
01:28:06,148 --> 01:28:10,221
But you can just save us the trouble, and tell us what's in it.

1237
01:28:10,352 --> 01:28:11,387
I would love to help you,

1238
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:12,796
but I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1239
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:15,129
Do you think we're stupid?

1240
01:28:19,695 --> 01:28:20,867
And who is Jib Lakowski?

1241
01:28:22,598 --> 01:28:24,600
It says right there, he's the guy shipping the van,

1242
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:26,374
so maybe you should talk to him.

1243
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:28,304
He died in 2004.

1244
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:31,442
Then I guess he's not going to need the van. Huh?

1245
01:29:17,219 --> 01:29:18,664
What's up, Houdini?

1246
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:20,962
You got something for me?

1247
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:22,491
What are you talking about?

1248
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:26,032
Come on, man. Just give it to him.

1249
01:29:26,095 --> 01:29:27,267
What the fuck are you talking about?

1250
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:28,433
Come on, man!

1251
01:29:28,497 --> 01:29:31,171
Yeah, I didn't think so. Say goodbye to Andy.

1252
01:29:31,233 --> 01:29:32,712
- Chris! Chris! - Shut the fuck up!

1253
01:29:32,801 --> 01:29:34,747
Don't fuck me, man!

1254
01:29:34,837 --> 01:29:36,043
What are you doing?

1255
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:43,812
Chris!

1256
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,381
Run, Andy!

1257
01:29:49,985 --> 01:29:51,225
Fuck, Briggs.

1258
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:56,167
Pull the fucking trigger!

1259
01:29:56,325 --> 01:29:57,929
You don't get your dope if I'm dead.

1260
01:30:23,085 --> 01:30:24,086
Here.

1261
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,192
This is it right here.

1262
01:30:27,723 --> 01:30:29,066
Right here?

1263
01:30:29,124 --> 01:30:30,330
Yeah.

1264
01:30:30,392 --> 01:30:33,202
What, you got your grandma selling cocaine?

1265
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:35,071
It's my friend's place.

1266
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:46,716
You better not be messing around,

1267
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:48,550
I'll put a bullet in your face.

1268
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:51,982
All right, take it easy. Come on.

1269
01:30:54,082 --> 01:30:55,652
- Is your friend home? - Quiet.

1270
01:30:55,717 --> 01:30:57,924
Trust me, you don't want to wake this fucker up.

1271
01:30:57,986 --> 01:30:59,488
One, state your position, please.

1272
01:30:59,555 --> 01:31:00,966
211, responding.

1273
01:31:01,056 --> 01:31:04,936
We have a home security alarm triggered at 452 King Drive.

1274
01:31:10,466 --> 01:31:13,174
Hey, you got some rich friends, man.

1275
01:31:15,938 --> 01:31:16,939
Come on.

1276
01:31:19,341 --> 01:31:20,752
Shut that door.

1277
01:31:49,538 --> 01:31:52,712
Whoo! That's some world-class smuggling right there, man.

1278
01:31:53,609 --> 01:31:54,781
Yeah!

1279
01:31:58,714 --> 01:32:00,625
We got it now, man.

1280
01:32:01,049 --> 01:32:02,050
Check this out.

1281
01:32:04,052 --> 01:32:05,895
This is the shit, man.

1282
01:32:06,722 --> 01:32:07,996
Check this out.

1283
01:32:08,156 --> 01:32:09,191
Yeah.

1284
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:15,869
Oh, that's some real booger-sugar right there.

1285
01:32:15,964 --> 01:32:16,965
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

1286
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:18,700
It's good?

1287
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,801
Yeah, yeah.

1288
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:21,279
Great. I'm going to take a piss,

1289
01:32:21,336 --> 01:32:22,679
I've been holding it since I got off the boat.

1290
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:24,547
All right, you do that.

1291
01:32:37,986 --> 01:32:39,488
It doesn't want to come out, man.

1292
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:41,395
They make it stubborn...

1293
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:42,867
Who the hell are you?

1294
01:32:42,925 --> 01:32:45,337
What the fuck are you doing in my goddamn house?

1295
01:32:46,295 --> 01:32:47,933
Go back to bed, old man.

1296
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:51,033
Shit, it's Five-O!

1297
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:53,409
Get the fuck out! Pack that shit up, man.

1298
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,112
Dumbshit.

1299
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:02,814
Jeanie, is Kate there? She's not picking up her phone.

1300
01:33:02,878 --> 01:33:04,152
Are the boys with you?

1301
01:33:04,212 --> 01:33:06,556
Yeah, the boys are here. She left a while ago.

1302
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:08,356
Said she was going to Sebastian's to get their stuff.

1303
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:11,125
Listen, if she calls you, tell her to call me right away.

1304
01:33:14,256 --> 01:33:16,634
Absolutely fucking ridiculous.

1305
01:33:16,692 --> 01:33:18,763
I've never seen these idiots before in my life.

1306
01:33:19,461 --> 01:33:22,237
That one dumbshit right there is bleeding all over my couch,

1307
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:23,605
and they're cutting up their drugs.

1308
01:33:41,383 --> 01:33:42,384
Kate?

1309
01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:46,455
Kate!

1310
01:34:47,716 --> 01:34:48,717
Sebastian!

1311
01:35:51,379 --> 01:35:54,121
I want you guys to pour the cement on the south corner first.

1312
01:35:54,182 --> 01:35:55,786
Can we start on the south corner first?

1313
01:35:56,818 --> 01:35:59,526
We're set up for the other side. No, we can't.

1314
01:35:59,621 --> 01:36:01,658
South corner first, hurry the hell up.

1315
01:36:01,723 --> 01:36:04,294
You guys have milked this fucking job long enough!

1316
01:36:09,564 --> 01:36:10,565
Hold it!

1317
01:36:10,665 --> 01:36:14,078
We're pouring over on the south corner. Take it over there.

1318
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:28,222
What the hell's going on here? I thought we were doing the other side.

1319
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:35,799
Why are you moving the cement truck?

1320
01:36:36,424 --> 01:36:38,529
You're blocking the fucking trucks.

1321
01:36:46,868 --> 01:36:48,279
You send guys to my house?

1322
01:36:48,603 --> 01:36:51,675
Huh? I trusted you with my wife and my kids.

1323
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,850
And I fucking loved you like a brother.

1324
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:56,512
Where is Kate?

1325
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:01,886
Where the fuck is Kate?

1326
01:37:02,017 --> 01:37:05,931
One more fucking time. Where's Kate?

1327
01:37:06,555 --> 01:37:07,590
She's gone.

1328
01:37:10,659 --> 01:37:11,899
Are you okay, Seb?

1329
01:37:47,929 --> 01:37:49,408
Whose phone is this?

1330
01:37:50,098 --> 01:37:51,600
Who left their phone here?

1331
01:38:00,942 --> 01:38:03,320
Turn that fucking thing off, now!

1332
01:38:10,986 --> 01:38:12,158
Chris?

1333
01:38:20,629 --> 01:38:21,630
Oh, my God!

1334
01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:23,732
Turn that fucking thing off!

1335
01:38:37,779 --> 01:38:38,985
Call an ambulance!

1336
01:38:39,648 --> 01:38:41,286
Oh, fuck.

1337
01:38:41,917 --> 01:38:43,362
Call an ambulance!

1338
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:45,557
Call a fucking ambulance, now!

1339
01:38:46,221 --> 01:38:47,291
Yeah, I need an ambulance...

1340
01:38:47,455 --> 01:38:48,593
Oh, shit.

1341
01:38:48,657 --> 01:38:51,137
...at West Bank Trucking Company. Yeah, right away.

1342
01:39:26,061 --> 01:39:28,007
Are you sure this is the right place?

1343
01:39:28,563 --> 01:39:29,667
Yeah.

1344
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:31,836
These are the coordinates Chris gave me when he dropped it.

1345
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:33,811
We're definitely in the right place.

1346
01:39:46,214 --> 01:39:47,659
Chris.

1347
01:39:54,255 --> 01:39:57,532
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1348
01:40:23,284 --> 01:40:24,285
I got that. And you got one.

1349
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:26,992
You cheated. It's mine.

1350
01:40:33,261 --> 01:40:34,262
Oh!

1351
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:36,131
Yeah!

1352
01:40:39,234 --> 01:40:41,180
Oh, man! I can't believe it.

1353
01:40:41,236 --> 01:40:42,340
A sea full of money!

1354
01:40:42,404 --> 01:40:43,474
We got to get in.

1355
01:40:43,805 --> 01:40:45,079
Get it in here. Yeah.

1356
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:48,983
Pull it in. Be careful, it's slippery right there.

1357
01:40:49,144 --> 01:40:50,145
Whoa!

1358
01:40:53,081 --> 01:40:54,116
Are you all right?

1359
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:56,093
Yeah, I'm all right.

1360
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:21,709
Bud?

1361
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:28,921
And I have sold it.

1362
01:41:28,983 --> 01:41:31,827
4,500, number 106. Next one.

1363
01:41:31,886 --> 01:41:34,230
Call lot number 122. Come bid 300.

1364
01:41:34,289 --> 01:41:36,360
A high of 300, I have to get 400.

1365
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:38,961
Got 400, got a $500 bid. Five-and-a-half?

1366
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,835
Five to six-and-a-half.

1367
01:41:40,895 --> 01:41:43,375
I'm going to seven, going to seven-and-a-half.

1368
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:45,001
Can I have an $800 bid? Get an 800?

1369
01:41:45,066 --> 01:41:47,569
And I have sold it.

1370
01:41:47,635 --> 01:41:51,481
Seven-and-a-half to number 77. Thank you, sir. Next one.

1371
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:13,999
I'll take it off your hands for 2.5.

1372
01:42:15,497 --> 01:42:17,477
I'm not taking any less than three.

1373
01:42:21,836 --> 01:42:22,940
Okay, three.

1374
01:42:24,873 --> 01:42:25,874
Come on.

1375
01:42:30,512 --> 01:42:34,358
So you were down in Panama, were you?

1376
01:42:35,517 --> 01:42:36,655
Yeah.

1377
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:41,228
Did you hear about that famous painting by Jackson Pollock?

1378
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:45,898
It got ripped off in Panama.

1379
01:42:47,629 --> 01:42:50,235
Come on, it's been all over the news.

1380
01:42:51,466 --> 01:42:53,707
No. No idea.

1381
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:56,672
What's that thing worth, anyway?

1382
01:42:56,738 --> 01:42:58,843
About 140 million.

1383
01:42:59,874 --> 01:43:02,411
What's that, 20 on the black market?

1384
01:43:03,311 --> 01:43:04,654
At least.

1385
01:43:06,047 --> 01:43:08,391
I'm in the wrong business, huh?

1386
01:43:25,934 --> 01:43:27,436
Get in, get in.

1387
01:43:27,602 --> 01:43:28,910
Hurry up!

1388
01:43:30,038 --> 01:43:31,039
Whoo!

1389
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:35,411
Wow. Whoo!

1390
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:36,681
Twenty.

1391
01:43:37,745 --> 01:43:39,725
Twenty! It's twenty!

1392
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:43,385
Twenty million.

1393
01:43:45,787 --> 01:43:46,925
Yes!
