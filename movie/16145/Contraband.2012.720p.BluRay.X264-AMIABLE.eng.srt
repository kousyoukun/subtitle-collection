Good to see you, man.

Oh, shit. This man was a world-class smuggler here.

You were fucking Houdini, man.

Yeah, he used to run with my brother, God rest his miserable soul.

Mmm. But he's my wife's little brother.

I can figure out a way to pay you back the buy money.

327
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,928
Every time I come here, you got new shit.

328
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:01,495
I'm getting it together, I'm getting the place ready.

329
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,198
It's a bad-ass coffee table.

330
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,139
That is not for shoes.

331
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,371
I must be out of touch. I don't know what's bad-ass anymore

332
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,469
because this looks cheap-ass.

333
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,071
You're turning into The Birdcage.

334
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,138
(LAUGHING) I mean...

335
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:15,752
So who do we know in Panama?

336
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,413
Are you going to go see Ruben?

337
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,084
Dude, no drugs.

338
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,517
What else has that kind of profit margin?

339
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,252
Edwin is in Panama.

340
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,557
Currency?

341
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,121
We have to bring back a shit-ton to make it worth our while.

342
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,292
All right, so I'll bring back a shit-ton.

343
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,633
Okay, 15 million on four stacks this big.

344
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,331
It's like the size of a Mini Cooper.

345
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,499
Where are you going to hide it?

346
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,007
That's my problem.

347
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:39,733
I need the Borden's crew manifest.

348
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,840
Oh, God. You got to be kidding me.

349
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,887
Oh, I like Tarik Mortin. He's a horrible chef, but he's great on runs.

350
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,221

352
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,094
He's not great on runs, but we've known him a long time.

353
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,767
Olaf's solid, we need somebody in the engine room.

354
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,628
Well, it's no A-Team, but it's the best we can do.

355

Come on, work your magic. Make the call, get me a TWIC card.

356
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,435
Hi, sweet pea.

357
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,275
I need you to push through a TWIC card for Chris Farraday.

358
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,916
I got your message. It only took you three years to call me?

359
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,449
Are you back in business?

360
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,582
No, no, no, no, no.

361
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,819
I need something, though.

362
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,088
Remember our last run? The funny money?

363
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,458
I need that exact same shit by next week, but a lot more.

364
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,192
Four times as much.

365
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,563
And we need a van big enough to transport it, okay?

366
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,298
Okay. I'll be here.

367
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:42,602
Come on, Mikey!

368
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:43,832
What's funny money?

00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,570
Huh? Nothing. That's just work stuff for Dad.

No.

373

Sedition, or conspiracy to commit espionage, sedition, treason?

Would you like us to load it?

380
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:16,266
No, I've got somebody to take care of that. I just need the container.

381
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:17,634
Okay, we'll leave the container

CHIEF MATE: Oh! Shit, rats!

983
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,302
Shut it!

984
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:58,607
Watch your hand.

985
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:02,746
Yo, yo, yo!

986
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:05,480
We got a sewage leak. Call Brody, all right?

987
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,090
All right, let's go.

988

993

That's the last container that was boarded.

994
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:10,846
Go on.

995
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:19,623
Anything?

996
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,887
No, sir. Smells like it was just cleaned.

997
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:24,999
All right, seal it up. (CHUCKLES)

998
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,801
Customs will take it apart when we get back home.

999
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:45,645
I need to tell you...

1000
01:05:45,709 --> 01:05:47,689
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1001
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,382
Are you fucking crazy?

Where's the money? Where is it?

1003

It's gone! I had to use it.

It's what? Where's the money?

1005

What are you trying to...

1006
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:57,491
What did you just say to me?

1007
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:58,589
I had to use it.

1008
01:05:58,655 --> 01:05:59,656
You what?

1009
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,725
I had to use it.

1010
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:03,996
It's in the ceiling.

1011
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:07,071
No, you fucking...

1012
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:14,779
How fucking stupid are you?

1013
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:17,750
I came out here to help you, to risk my fucking freedom

1014
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:20,845
and my wife and my children for this?

1015
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:22,754
Motherfucker.

1016
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:26,554
What the fuck am I supposed to do with all that?

1017

Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

Yeah, they're sleeping.

What's up? Is everything okay? Is Andy okay?

Yeah. Don't worry about it. Is Sebastian there?

No, no.

No, it's okay. Go back to sleep.

I'll call you in the morning.

Chris, I've been trying to call you. What's going on?

1044
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:03,418
Andy picked something up.

1045
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:05,584
Really? I thought we weren't doing that.

1046
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:06,650
I didn't have a choice.

1047
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:09,492
Thank God for Andy taking the initiative, though, huh?

1048
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:10,964
Too bad I'm not bringing it in.

1049
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:13,757
I'm thinking of dumping it in the sea, actually.

Why would you do that?

1051
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:17,897
Then we would all be fucked!

I told you I would call you with an update.

I'm sure. It's coming in.

Call lot number 122. Come bid 300.

1468
01:41:34,289 --> 01:41:36,360
A high of 300, I have to get 400.

1469
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:38,961
Got 400, got a $500 bid. Five-and-a-half?

1470
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,835
Five to six-and-a-half.

1471
01:41:40,895 --> 01:41:43,375
I'm going to seven, going to seven-and-a-half.

1472
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:45,001
Can I have an $800 bid? Get an 800?

1473
01:41:45,066 --> 01:41:47,569
And I have sold it.

1474
01:41:47,635 --> 01:41:51,481
Seven-and-a-half to number 77. Thank you, sir. Next one.

1475
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:13,999
CHURCH: I'll take it off your hands for 2.5.

1476
01:42:15,497 --> 01:42:17,477
CHRIS: I'm not taking any less than three.

1477
01:42:21,836 --> 01:42:22,940
Okay, three.

1478
01:42:24,873 --> 01:42:25,874
Come on.

1479
01:42:30,512 --> 01:42:34,358
So you were down in Panama, were you?

1480
01:42:35,517 --> 01:42:36,655
Yeah.

1481
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:41,228
Did you hear about that famous painting by Jackson Pollock?

1482
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:45,898
It got ripped off in Panama.

1483
01:42:47,629 --> 01:42:50,235
Come on, it's been all over the news.

1484
01:42:51,466 --> 01:42:53,707
No. No idea.

1485
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:56,672
What's that thing worth, anyway?

1486
01:42:56,738 --> 01:42:58,843
About 140 million.

1487
01:42:59,874 --> 01:43:02,411
What's that, 20 on the black market?

1488
01:43:03,311 --> 01:43:04,654
At least.

1489
01:43:06,047 --> 01:43:08,391
I'm in the wrong business, huh?

1490
01:43:25,934 --> 01:43:27,436
Get in, get in.

1491
01:43:27,602 --> 01:43:28,910
Hurry up!

1492
01:43:30,038 --> 01:43:31,039
Whoo!

1493
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:35,411
Wow. Whoo!

1494
01:43:35,543 --> 01:43:36,681
Twenty.

1495
01:43:37,745 --> 01:43:39,725
Twenty! It's twenty!

1496
01:43:40,081 --> 01:43:41,082
(WHOOPING)

1497
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:43,385
