1
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,166
希尔大夫
Dr. Hill.

2
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,625
巴西特大夫
Dr. Bassett.

3
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,125
病人在哪里？
Where's the patient?

4
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,458
我真不想在这个时间
把你从床上拽起来
I hated
to drag you out of bed.

5
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,750
趁现在还来得及 放我走行吗？
Will you let me go
while there's still time?

6
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,750
你马上就会知道我为什么这么做了
You'll soon see why I did.

7
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,875
告诉这些白痴我没疯 好吗？
Will you tell
these fools I'm not crazy?

8
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,041
在一切都追悔莫及之前让他们听我说！
Make them listen to me
before it's too late!

9
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,041
我来听你说
I'll listen to you.

10
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,458
放开她
Let him go.

11
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,458
你是谁？
Who are you?

12
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,958
我是州立精神病院的希尔大夫
I'm Dr. Hill
from the state mental hospital.

13
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,583
我没疯！
I'm not insane!

14
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,083
放开他！
Let him go!

15
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,208
大夫 现在你必须认真听我说
Doctor,
now you must listen to me.

16
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,583
请你一定要理解我
You must understand me.

17
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:35,416
我也是名医生
我没疯
I am a doctor, too.
I am not insane.

18
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,875
- 我根本就没疯！
- 好吧 好吧
All right.

19
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:41,125
让我们坐下谈 医生
然后你告诉我到底发生了什么 好吗？
Suppose we sit down,
and you tell me what happened?

20
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,583
好 那是始于--
Well, it started...

21
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,083
对我来说
始于上个星期四...
for me,
it started last Thursday...

22
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,583
因为我的护士发来紧急通知
in response to an urgent
message from my nurse.

23
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:56,583
我从一个医学交流研讨大会上急忙赶回家
I'd hurried home
from a medical convention.

24
00:02:56,583 --> 00:03:00,166
乍看之下
一切如常
At first glance,
everything looked the same.

25
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,833
但实际上并不是这样
It wasn't.

26
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,625
某种邪恶的气息已悄悄笼罩了这个小镇
Something evil had taken
possession of the town.

27
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,125
这两件
These two.

28
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,625
给
Here you are.

29
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,083
谢谢先生
请拿好
Thank you, sir.
There you are.

30
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,583
多谢
Thank you.

31
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,333
费希尔先生，早上好啊
Morning, Mr. Fisher.

32
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,083
大夫！
Doc!

33
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,583
嗨呀 莎莉
Hiya, Sally.

34
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,083
嗨 欢迎回家
真高兴你回来了
Hi. Welcome home.
I'm glad you're back.

35
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,750
米基和宝宝情况如何？
How's Mickey and the baby?

36
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,041
他们挺好的 可是看起来似乎
圣米拉城里的每个人都需要看医生
Fine, but everybody else
in Santa Mira needs a doctor.

37
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,583
你的诊室都被病人塞满了
You've got an office
full of patients.

38
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,375
噢 不要啊
我第一天回来就这样？
Oh, no.
On my first day back?

39
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,791
他们之中有些人已经等了你两星期了
Some of them have
been waiting for two weeks.

40
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,916
为什么不让他们去找珀西
或者卡迈克尔大夫呢？我跟你说过的
Why didn't you send them
to Pursey or Carmichael?

41
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,125
可他们大多都不愿意
他们只想见你
Most of 'em wouldn't go.
They want to see you.

42
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,625
哦？
Oh?

43
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,666
他们有什么症状？
What's the matter with them?

44
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,000
他们就是不说
They wouldn't say.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,333
你知道通常病人们都迫不及待
要描述自己的病症
Usually people can't talk enough
about what's ailing them.

46
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,333
比如说
沃利·埃伯哈德来了两次...
For instance,
Wally Eberhard was in twice...

47
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,958
而且打过三次电话
但他就是不谈自己有什么症状
and called three times,
but he wouldn't say about what.

48
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,166
有点意思
That's funny.

49
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,833
没有一个人愿意说--
从贝基·德里斯科尔...
Nobody would talk...
from Becky Driscoll...

50
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,333
到那个胖交警萨姆·雅纳切克
down to that fat
traffic cop Sam Janzek.

51
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:11,166
贝基·德里斯科尔？
我以为她在英国呢
Becky Driscoll?
I thought she was in England.

52
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:15,666
几天前她就回来了
而且她点名要见你
She got back a few days ago,
and she wanted to see you.

53
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,625
还对她有兴趣？
Are you still interested?

54
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,625
我对已婚妇女的兴趣仅限于
严谨的职业范围内...
My interest in married women
is strictly professional...

55
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,666
否则怎能长期抗拒你的诱惑
or yours would have been
a lost cause long ago.

56
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,333
- 研讨会怎么样？
- 棒极了
- How was the convention?
- Wonderful.

57
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,000
我宣读我的论文时
他们简直嫉妒得泪流满面
They wept with envy
when I read my paper.

58
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,916
回来！
MRS. GRIMALDl: Come back here!

59
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,083
吉米！
Jimmy!

60
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,541
怎么了
格里马尔迪太太？
What's the matter,
Mrs. Grimaldi?

61
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,583
没什么 他就是不愿意上学！
It's nothing. He just don't
want to go to school.

62
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,083
我要是你的话
就会去找她的老师谈谈
If I were you, I'd have
a talk with his teacher.

63
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,083
等有时间了我就去
MRS. GRIMALDl:
I will when I get time.

64
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,208
发生什么了
乔生病了吗？
What's the matter?
Has Joe been sick?

65
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,291
不 我们只是不再经营这个市场了
MRS. GRIMALDl: No.
We gave the stand up.

66
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,625
- 需要太多劳动力
- 哦
- Too much work.
- Oh.

67
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,500
那孩子的惊慌失措当时就应该让我明白...
The boy's
panic should have told me...

68
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,708
他所恐惧的绝不仅仅是上学...
it was more than school
he was afraid of...

69
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,333
还有那堆满垃圾的 倒闭了的菜市场...
and that littered,
closed-up vegetable stand...

70
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,625
也许也在暗示着些什么
should have
told me something, too.

71
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,125
我最后一次看见它的时候
还是在不到一个月之前...
When I last saw it,
less than a month ago...

72
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,750
那时它还是这条大路上
最整洁最繁忙的一个市场
it was the cleanest
and busiest stand on the road.

73
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,500
真是奇怪
That's strange.

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,041
她也来找过你--
就在上周五
She was in to see you, too...
last Friday.

75
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,791
我曾尝试说服她去找珀西大夫
但她不愿意
I tried to get her to see
Doc Pursey, but she wouldn't.

76
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,958
她说只有你才能帮助她
She said only you
could help her.

77
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,208
好吧 不管她有什么毛病...
Whatever it was...

78
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,500
我想应该都不会很严重
it couldn't have been
too serious, I guess.

79
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,000
一例轻微脑震荡 两例普通感冒...
One minor concussion,
two cases of the common cold...

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
还有六个已取消的预约
and six canceled appointments.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,500
看来你急急忙忙把我拽回来
也并没有什么事嘛
Looks like you rushed me here
for nothing.

82
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000
我不明白...
他们都迫不及待要见你啊
I don't understand it.
They couldn't wait to see you.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,500
不过今天下午你的日程也会排得满满的
But you're still booked up solid
for the afternoon.

84
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,250
我打赌他们不会来
看那里 是沃利·埃伯哈德...
I bet they don't show.
Look, there's Wally Eberhard...

85
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,458
正在跟路人推销保险呢
talking somebody
into buying some insurance.

86
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,708
他一点问题也没有嘛
There's nothing wrong with him.

87
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,083
比尔·比特纳正要带他的小秘去吃午饭
Bill Bitner's taking
his secretary to lunch.

88
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,791
啊 说到午饭...
And speaking of lunch...

89
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,375
能否跟来找我的任何人说 我去用餐了？
will you tell whoever that is
that I'm out having mine?

90
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,541
本耐尔大夫在吗？
Is Dr. Bennell in?

91
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,458
是的 他在
Yes, he's here.

92
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,250
你认为他有空接待我吗？
Do you suppose
he has time to see me?

93
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,125
如果他没出什么毛病的话
If he hasn't,
something's wrong with him.

94
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,291
进去吧
Go right in.

95
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,750
贝基
Becky.

96
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,375
快五年了
Almost five years.

97
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,625
回家的感觉真好
It's wonderful to be home again.

98
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,875
我离开得太久了...
I've been away so long...

99
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,458
回到老家却觉得自己像个外乡人
I feel almost like a stranger
in my own country.

100
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,625
我没有预约就来了 但愿你别介意
Hope you don't mind my coming
without an appointment.

101
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,833
才不会
想做点什么？
Not at all.
What'll you have?

102
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,583
这周我们做推广促销的是阑尾切除术
We're pushing appendectomies
this week.

103
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,750
噢 米尔斯
Oh, Miles.

104
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,041
我不知道 或许我老是胡闹乱开玩笑
I don't know,
maybe I clown around too much.

105
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,041
用不了多久 我的病人们...
Pretty soon, my patients...

106
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,541
就会连我给他们开的阿司匹林都不敢信任了
won't trust me
to prescribe aspirin for them.

107
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,041
说真的 是有什么问题？
Seriously, what's the trouble?

108
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,250
是我表妹
It's my cousin.

109
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,208
威尔玛？
她怎么了？
Wilma?
What's the matter with her?

110
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,291
她出现了些 呃...
She has a...

111
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,916
我猜你们称之为“幻觉”
I guess you'd call it
a delusion.

112
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,291
你认识他叔叔吧？
艾拉叔叔？
You know her uncle?
Uncle Ira?

113
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,875
当然 我是他的大夫
Sure. I'm his doctor.

114
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,916
现在她自己认为他不是她的叔叔
She's got herself
thinking he isn't her uncle.

115
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,750
你指的是什么？
他们实际上没有血缘关系？
How do you mean?
That they're not really related?

116
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,458
她觉得他是个冒充的傀儡一类的...
She thinks
he's an impostor or something...

117
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,333
...某种只是外表看起来是艾拉叔叔的东西
someone who only looks like Ira.

118
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,750
你见过他了吧？
Have you seen him?

119
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,000
我就是刚从他那过来的
I just came from there.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,500
他到底是不是艾拉叔叔呢？
Is he Uncle Ira,
or isn't he Uncle Ira?

121
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,666
当然是啦
Of course he is.

122
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,750
我跟威尔玛强调过了 可是没有用
I told Wilma that,
but it was no use.

123
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,500
拜托 你有空的话能否顺便过去和她聊聊？
Please, would you stop by
and have a talk with her?

124
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,083
莎莉说我整个下午的日程都排满了...
Sally says I'm booked up
for the afternoon...

125
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,750
不过你为什么不让她过来找我呢
but why don't you ask her
to come in and see me?

126
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,250
我试试吧
I'll try.

127
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,666
呃 共进午餐如何？
How about some lunch?

128
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,000
不行 我一会要去店里见爸爸
I can't.
I'm meeting Dad at the store.

129
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,916
你是什么时候回来的
When did you get back?

130
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,583
两个月前从伦敦回来的
I came back from London
two months ago.

131
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,041
之前我一直是在里诺
【里诺：美国有名的“离婚城市”
位于内华达州西部】
I've been in Reno.

132
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,208
里诺？
Reno?

133
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,041
里诺
Reno.

134
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,541
爸爸告诉过我你也曾待在那里
Dad tells me
you were there, too.

135
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,041
五个月前吧
Five months ago.

136
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,041
哦 真遗憾
Oh, I'm sorry.

137
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,541
我有同感
So was I.

138
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,041
我曾希望我们能在那相遇
I wanted it to work.

139
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,500
好吧 我想现在我们终于上了同一条船
I guess that makes us
lodge brothers now.

140
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,708
是的
Yes.

141
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,750
除了我付租你收租的区别以外
Except I'm paying dues
while you collect them.

142
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,916
哈哈哈 米尔斯
Ha ha ha! Miles.

143
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,416
- 哈喽 大夫
- 你好吗？
- Hello, doc.
- How are you?

144
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,583
萨姆！
Sam!

145
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,583
又在贴条了哈？
At it again, eh?

146
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,916
我的护士告诉我你上周来过诊室...
My nurse tells me
you were in last week...

147
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,083
而且迫切要与我会面
and wanted very much
to see me.

148
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,083
没那么严重的啦
It wasn't anything important.

149
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,083
他跟我们一起上过学吗？
Didn't he go to college with us?

150
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,083
大二的时候为了结婚退学了...
Quit his second year
to get married...

151
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,583
就像我曾希望咱俩去做的那样
like I wanted us to do.

152
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,208
应该感到庆幸的是我没当真
Just be thankful
I didn't take you seriously.

153
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,750
不感到庆幸？
You be thankful.

154
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,208
我发现要成为一名医生的妻子...
I found out
that a doctor's wife...

155
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,916
需要有对爱因斯坦的理解和包容...
needs the understanding
of an Einstein...

156
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,541
还要有圣人的耐心
and patience of a saint.

157
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,041
那爱情呢？
And love?

158
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,041
我怎么知道
I wouldn't know about that.

159
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,041
我不过是个普通医师而已
I'm just a general practitioner.

160
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,541
爱情这玩意还是留给啥专家们去搞定吧
Love is handled
by the specialists.

161
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,541
好吧 我该走了
Here's where I leave you.

162
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,083
你知道吗？
You know something?

163
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,583
这该是你最后一次离开我身边
This is where you left me
the last time.

164
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,083
嗨 约翰尼
Hiya, Johnny.

165
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,958
莎莉 我该走了
Sally, I'm off.

166
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,083
告诉接线生我会在自己家里
Tell the answering service
I'll be at home.

167
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,583
晚安 大夫
Good night, doc.

168
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,666
我不要进去...
I'm not going in there!

169
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,333
别胡闹了！
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Stop all this nonsense.

170
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,583
嘿 嘿 放松点
Hey! Take it easy!

171
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,583
这不是小吉米 格里马尔迪吗？
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?

172
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,583
是的 大夫
我能跟你谈谈吗？
MRS. GRIMALDl: Yes, Doctor.
Can I talk to you a moment?

173
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,500
当然 知道吗
今早我差点开车撞到你
Sure. I almost
ran you down this morning.

174
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,583
过马路的时候可要加倍小心哦
You got to be careful
when you run out in the road.

175
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,083
来
Come on.

176
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,583
过来
MRS. GRIMALDl: Come on.

177
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,041
嘿！嘿！嘿！
Hey! Hey! Hey!

178
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,541
嘿！别着急
Hey! Slow down now.

179
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,291
去上学也不是那么糟糕的呀
School isn't as bad as all that.

180
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,833
上学不是让他变成这样的原因
MRS. GRIMALDl:
School isn't what upsets him.

181
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,208
是我儿媳
It's my daughter-in-law.

182
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,708
他不知怎么产生的这个疯念头
觉得她不是他妈妈
He's got the crazy idea
she isn't his mother.

183
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,208
她不是！她就不是！
She isn't! She isn't!

184
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,833
别让她抓住我！
Don't let her get me!

185
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,958
没人会来抓你的 吉米
Nobody's going
to get you, Jimmy.

186
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,125
这个症状持续多久了？
How long has this been going on?

187
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,875
一个小时前 我在地窖发现他在那里藏着
MRS. GRIMALDl: An hour ago,
I found him in the cellar.

188
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,208
他一言不发 直到我开始给他妈妈打电话
He wouldn't say anything until
I started to phone his mother.

189
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,041
这时他告诉我安娜不是他妈妈
That's when he said Anna
wasn't his mother.

190
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,541
你能暂时让他在你那里呆一两天吗？
Could you keep him
with you for a day or so?

191
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,166
这个药给他每四小时吃一次
Give him one of these every
four hours during the day.

192
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,041
明天给我打个电话 告诉我他情况如何
Call me tomorrow and let me know
how he's feeling.

193
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,541
好的 大夫 谢谢你
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Yes, Doctor, thank you.

194
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,750
别让她抓住我！
Don't let her get me!

195
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,791
没人会来抓你的
Nobody's going to get you.

196
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,083
好吧 吉米
All right, Jimmy.

197
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,583
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

198
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,083
闭上眼睛
Shut your eyes.

199
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,208
以诗人之名...
In the words of the poet...

200
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,125
我给你吃令人充满智慧的神奇药丸
I'll give you something
to make you wise.

201
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,583
真是个好孩子 吉米
That's a good boy, Jimmy.

202
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,625
我绝不要回家
I'm not going home ever.

203
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,958
你会暂时留在奶奶家的
给他妈妈打个电话...
You're staying at your
grandmother's. Call his mother.

204
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,291
她不是我妈妈！
She's not my mother!

205
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,625
好吧好吧 你们先回去
一切都会没事的
All right. Run along.
Everything's going to be OK.

206
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,166
做个乖孩子哦
You be a good boy now.

207
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,583
晚安 大夫
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Good night, Doctor.

208
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,791
晚安
Good night.

209
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,125
我改变主意了
我先不直接回家去
I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.

210
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,583
顺路去看看威尔玛·伦茨的情况
I'm going to stop off
and see Wilma Lentz.

211
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,333
我需要给这孩子的母亲打个电话？
Should I call the boy's mother?

212
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,333
是的 告诉她发生了什么...
Yes.
Tell her what happened...

213
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,500
并且告诉她我建议最好先让孩子...
and that I suggested
the boy spend the night...

214
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,166
住在他奶奶家
at his grandmother's house.

215
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,625
你好 米尔斯
Hello, Miles.

216
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,083
见到你真好 威尔玛 贝基
Nice to see you, Wilma.
Becky.

217
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,541
直奔主题吧
Let's have it.

218
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,208
你刚才跟他聊过了 有什么感想？
You talked to him.
What do you think?

219
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,416
就是他 没错啊
It's him.

220
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,500
他就是你的艾拉叔叔，一切正常
He's your Uncle Ira, all right.

221
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,041
他才不是
He is not.

222
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,625
他有什么变化吗？
How is he different?

223
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,750
就是这样子
That's just it.

224
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,750
根本就没有肉眼能发现的区别
There is no difference
you can actually see.

225
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,125
他的外表 说话和行事风格 以及记忆...
He looks, sounds, acts,
and remembers...

226
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,333
都跟艾拉叔叔一样
like Uncle Ira.

227
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,916
那他就是你的艾拉叔叔啊
Then he is your Uncle Ira.

228
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:25,291
你不明白吗？
不管你有什么样的感觉 他就是
You see that?
No matter how you feel, he is.

229
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,791
但他不是
有哪里不对劲 好像缺失了什么
But he isn't.
There's something missing.

230
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,166
当我还小的时候 他对我视如己出
He's been a father to me
since I was a baby.

231
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,750
每当他跟我说话的时候...
Always when he talked to me...

232
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,375
他的眼神里有些很特别的东西
there was a special look
in his eye.

233
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,666
现在这样的眼神不见了
That look's gone.

234
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,458
那记忆方面如何？
肯定有某些特别的东西...
What about memories?
There must be certain things...

235
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,958
是只有你们两个人知道的
that only you and he
would know about.

236
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,083
有的
There are.

237
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,541
我跟他聊过这些
他全部都记得...
I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all...

238
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,791
哪怕是最微小的细节
就像艾拉叔叔会记得的一样
down to the last small detail,
just like Uncle Ira would.

239
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,125
但是 米尔斯...
But, Miles...

240
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,583
他没有情感
there's no emotion.

241
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,791
毫无！
None!

242
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,625
只有假装出来的情感
Just the pretense of it.

243
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,666
语言 姿势 声调...
The words, gesture,
the tone of voice...

244
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,625
任何的一切都跟原来没有区别
除了感情
everything else is the same,
but not the feeling.

245
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,916
不管他有没有记忆
他都不是我的艾拉叔叔
Memories or not,
he isn't my Uncle Ira.

246
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,000
威尔玛 我是站在你这边的
Wilma, I'm on your side.

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,750
我的事业是帮助需要帮助的人...
My business
is people in trouble...

248
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,166
我会找到可以帮你的方法
and I'm going to find
a way to help you.

249
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,958
没有人可能扮成你的艾拉叔叔...
No one could possibly
impersonate your Uncle Ira...

250
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,541
并还能让你和艾莱达伯母 甚至我...
without you
or your Aunt Eleda or even me...

251
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,541
都找不出千万个破绽的
seeing a million
little differences.

252
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,625
我希望你能认识到这一点
I want you to realize that.

253
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,750
好好想想
然后你就会明白...
Think about it,
and then you'll know...

254
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,041
是你自己的问题
that the trouble is inside you.

255
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,500
威尔玛 你在哪？
Wilma, where are you?

256
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,416
在草坪上
Out on the lawn.

257
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,333
什么也别跟她说
Say nothing to her.

258
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,250
哎呀 米尔斯
我都不知道你来了
Why, Miles,
I didn't know you were here.

259
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,458
欢迎回来
Welcome home.

260
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,666
你好 伦茨太太
Hello, Mrs. Lentz.

261
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,833
你们邀请米尔斯留下共进晚餐了吗？
Did you ask Miles
to stay for dinner?

262
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,041
今晚不行
Can't tonight.

263
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,333
我今天做了蛋奶糕
I'm making spoon bread.

264
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,833
拜托 可别诱惑我
Please, don't tempt me.

265
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,041
下次有机会吧
Maybe next time.

266
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,041
威尔玛 我的眼镜在哪儿？
Wilma, where are my glasses?

267
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,000
我想大概在壁炉台上
I think
they're on the mantelpiece.

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,333
我跟你一起去拿
I'll go with you.

269
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,541
我是发疯了吗？
Am I going crazy?

270
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,541
别可怜我 我必须知道
Don't spare me.
I've got to know.

271
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,541
不 你没有疯
即使是当今...
No, you're not.
Even these days...

272
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,208
发疯也不是一件如你想象中
那般容易的事情啊
it isn't as easy to go crazy
as you might think.

273
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,000
不过你不用过于迫切...
But you don't have to be
losing your mind...

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,416
去寻求精神科的治疗
to need psychiatric help.

275
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,958
我希望你能见见我的一个医生朋友
I'd like you to see
a doctor friend of mine.

276
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,791
- 心理医生吗？
- 丹·考夫曼
- A psychiatrist?
- Dan Kauffman.

277
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,708
明天我会帮你预约
I'll make an appointment
for you tomorrow.

278
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,250
好吧
All right.

279
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,750
可那纯属浪费时间
我什么毛病也没有
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.

280
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,125
先到此为止吧 不然他会起疑的
Better break this up,
or he'll start wondering.

281
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,250
起疑什么？
Wondering what?

282
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,791
不乱想的话 你的来访对我帮助很大...
If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help...

283
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,625
我不想你们任何人为我担心
and I don't want either of you
to worry about me.

284
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,875
我会好好的
I'll be all right.

285
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,416
你当然会啦
Sure you will.

286
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,541
你要留在这吗 贝基？
还是我送你回家？
Staying here, Becky?
Or may I drive you home?

287
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,083
想让我留下吗？
Would you like me to stay?

288
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,375
当然不了
晚安
Of course not.
Good night.

289
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,375
晚安
Good night.

290
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,083
贝基回来了真好啊？孩子
Nice having Becky
back again, eh, boy?

291
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,583
可说呢
Sure is.

292
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,791
我的脑海深处...
In the back of my mind...

293
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,541
响起了警钟
a warning bell was ringing.

294
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,291
那些迫不及待需要见我的病人们...
Sick people
who couldn't wait to see me...

295
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,250
一夜之间全部恢复正常：
then suddenly
were perfectly all right.

296
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,583
一个哭喊着他妈妈不再是他的妈妈的孩子
A boy claiming
his mother wasn't his mother.

297
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,625
一个宣称她的叔叔不再是她的叔叔的女人
A woman claiming her uncle
wasn't her uncle.

298
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,000
但当时我并没有听警钟的召唤
But I didn't listen.

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,958
很明显 孩子的妈妈还是他妈妈
Obviously, the boy's mother
was his mother.

300
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,083
我见过她了
而艾拉叔叔还是艾拉叔叔
I had seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.

301
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,208
当我与他交谈过以后 这简直毫无疑问
There was no doubt of that
after I talked to him.

302
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,500
米尔斯 他确实是艾拉叔叔？
Miles, he is Ira?

303
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,291
当然 你的意思是？
Of course he is.
What do you mean?

304
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,458
只是威尔玛实在是太坚定了
It's just Wilma's so positive.

305
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,000
她会好起来吗？
Will she be all right?

306
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,541
我想会的
I think so.

307
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,458
从学历上来看 我是一个医生...
I'm a doctor,
according to my diploma...

308
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,916
但我真的看不出威尔玛有什么毛病
but I don't really know
what Wilma's trouble is.

309
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,208
我可以讲一些精神科的术语来糊弄人...
I could start talking
psychiatrical jargon...

310
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,208
不过那就越界了
这是丹·考夫曼的领域
but it's out of my line
and in Dan Kauffman's.

311
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,500
真希望你不用回家吃晚饭
I wish you didn't have
to go home for dinner.

312
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
不用的 爸爸跟朋友出去吃饭了
I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.

313
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,041
7点我来接你
I could pick you up
at 7:00.

314
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,541
嗯...
Well...

315
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,125
现在是夏天 而且会是满月哦
It's summer,
and the moon is full.

316
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,333
“我知道一处浅滩...”
"I know a bank...

317
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,166
“铺满了狂野的百里香”
"where the wild thyme grows. "

318
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,875
你真是一点都没变
You haven't changed a bit.

319
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,791
哇！哇！注意点！
Whup! Whoa! Watch out!

320
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,041
抱歉
Sorry.

321
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,375
嘿 米尔斯
你什么时候回来的？
Hey, Miles,
when did you get back?

322
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,625
今早
丹尼 你好吗？
This morning.
How are you, Danny?

323
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,791
这位是德里斯科尔小姐
This is Miss Driscoll.

324
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,708
这是考夫曼先生--
我们的一位 也是唯一的一位精神科专家
Dr. Kauffman...
our one and only psychiatrist.

325
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,916
注意自己的言行
埃德，还记得贝基吗？
Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.

326
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,458
必须的
她出生时是我接生的
I should.
I brought her into the world.

327
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,958
你可给大家做了一件大好事
You did us all a favor.

328
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,708
这下我就不用专门给你打电话了
This saves me a phone call.

329
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,500
我这有一个小孩和一位女性 需要一名巫医
I've got a kid and a woman
who need a witch doctor.

330
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,208
孩子说爸爸不是爸爸了...
Boy says his father
isn't his father...

331
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,333
然后女人说姐妹不是姐妹了？
and the woman says her sister
isn't her sister?

332
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,958
还真差不多
That's pretty close.

333
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,958
我知道你一直在研究催眠术...
I knew you'd been
studying hypnosis...

334
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,750
不过你什么时候学会读心术啦？
but when did you start
reading minds?

335
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,250
他不需要使用读心术
He doesn't have to read them.

336
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,208
自从这种情况开始以来
我已经给他那里送去了一打多的病人了
I've sent him a dozen patients
since it started.

337
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,250
是什么？
怎么回事？
What is it?
What's going on?

338
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,750
我不知道
一种奇怪的神经性现象...
I don't know.
A strange neurosis...

339
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,583
显然极具蔓延性--
像是一场可传染的集体性癔病
evidently contagious...
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

340
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,416
两周之后
席卷了整个小镇
In two weeks,
it's spread all over town.

341
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,791
是什么引起的？
What causes it?

342
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,416
过于操心世界局势所导致的吧 或许
Worry about
what's going on in the world.

343
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,083
明天给威尔玛·伦茨安排一下吧好吗？
Make room
for Wilma Lentz tomorrow.

344
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,708
让她2点左右过来
晚安
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.

345
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:25,875
再会 丹尼
So long, Danny.

346
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:34,500
这真是我听到过最诡异的事
This is the oddest thing
I ever heard of.

347
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,416
但愿我们别染上这毛病
Let's hope we don't catch it.

348
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,416
我绝不愿某天早上醒来...
I'd hate to wake up
some morning...

349
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,083
发现身边的你不再是你
and find out you weren't you.

350
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,416
我可不再是那时候被你的浪漫
哄得晕头转向的高中女生了
I'm not the high-school
kid you used to romance.

351
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,666
你怎么分辨呢？
How could you tell?

352
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,833
真的想知道？
You really want to know?

353
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,000
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

354
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,625
唔~~~
你是贝基·德里斯科尔没错
Mmm.
You're Becky Driscoll.

355
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,041
嘿 圣米拉真是越来越蒸蒸日上了
Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.

356
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,541
从你回来后才开始的
Has ever since you got back.

357
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,541
你平时对病人也是这种态度吗 大夫？
（bedside manner 双关语）
Is this an example
of your bedside manner, Doctor?

358
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,041
不 女士 那件事可要等一会儿
（贝基意指病床边 米尔斯指床上）
No, ma'am.
That comes later.

359
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,416
晚上好 大夫
Good evening, Doctor.

360
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,375
人都到哪儿去了？
What happened
to the crowd tonight?

361
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,000
我不知道
这种情况已经持续好几周了
I don't know.
It's been this way for weeks.

362
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,250
好吧 至少我们不用等桌位了
At least we don't
have to wait for a table.

363
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,500
你挑吧 坐这里 还是那边
Take your pick.
Here or here.

364
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,333
这边吧 我想
怎么样？
Here, I think.
Shall we?

365
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,541
嗯
Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,958
乐队到哪里去了？
Where's the band?

367
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,958
生意不景气
所以我只好把他们打发走了
Business slumped,
so I had to let them go.

368
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,208
不过那边还有自动唱机
There's the jukebox, though.

369
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,000
跳支舞吧？
Shall we dance?

370
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,958
希望你还没有把酒保打发走
I hope you didn't
let the bartender go.

371
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,958
我就是酒保
喝马提尼？
I'm the bartender.
Martinis?

372
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,791
两杯 烈的
Two. Dry.

373
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,125
要很烈
Very dry.

374
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,166
米尔斯 我不在意考夫曼医生说了些什么
Miles, I don't care
what Dr. Kauffman says.

375
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,458
我只是很担心
I'm worried.

376
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,208
你现在可是在...
You are in the capable hands...

377
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,458
你最得力的私人医师手里
of your personal physician.

378
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,958
噢 大夫
Oh, Doctor.

379
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,458
啊 我们的夜生活...
Ah, there's our evening.

380
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,958
抱歉
Sorry.

381
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,458
谢谢
Thanks.

382
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,958
本耐尔大夫
Dr. Bennell.

383
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,583
杰克·拜里塞克想要你现在立刻赶到他家去
Jack Belicec wants you
to come to his house right away.

384
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,416
他说是紧急情况
He says it's urgent.

385
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,416
谢谢
Thank you.

386
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,916
还是把酒收起来吧
Better hold those drinks.

387
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,083
急诊
Emergency.

388
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,583
还好至少他们在我们开始
共进晚餐前打来了电话
At least they called
before we ordered dinner.

389
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,750
你饿不饿？
How hungry are you?

390
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,041
我可以等
I can wait.

391
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,416
可能会久一些
It may be a while.

392
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,916
我和你一起去
I'll go with you.

393
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,916
对不起 我们一会再回来
Sorry.
We'll be back later.

394
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,916
杰克在那里
There's Jack.

395
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,333
你好 杰克 怎么了？
泰迪生病了？
What's the matter?
Teddy sick?

396
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,083
没有
No.

397
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,333
谢天谢地 我以为你来不了了
Thank heaven.
I thought you'd never arrive.

398
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,750
那是谁病了？
Then who is sick?

399
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,958
没人生病
Nobody.

400
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,750
那你为什么要把我从餐桌前揪过来？
Then why'd you
drag me away from my dinner?

401
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,916
你不会相信的 米尔斯
直到你自己亲眼目睹
You won't believe it
until you see it.

402
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,208
你好 贝基
Hello, Becky.

403
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,833
- 你好 贝基
- 嗨 泰迪
- Hello, Becky.
- Hi, Teddy.

404
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,875
能否暂时先把你的医生身份抛在脑后？
Could you forget
you're a doctor a while?

405
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,125
为何？
Why?

406
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,250
我不想你马上去叫警察
I don't want you
calling the police.

407
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,708
别整得像个文艺青年
到底怎么了？
Quit acting like a writer.

408
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,250
没准你能告诉我发生了什么
你可是医生
Maybe you can tell me.
You're the doctor.

409
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,583
米尔斯 把台球桌上面的灯打开
Miles, put the light on
over the pool table.

410
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,833
继续 拉开它
Go on. Pull it down.

411
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,000
你有什么结论？
What do you make of it?

412
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,166
这是谁？
Who is he?

413
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,541
我毫无头绪
I have no idea.

414
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,041
它的脸 米尔斯
模糊不清
Its face, Miles.
It's vague.

415
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,666
第一印象
就好像硬币上印着的头像一样
Like the first impression
that's stamped on a coin.

416
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,875
它还未完成
It isn't finished.

417
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,041
没错
You're right.

418
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,041
只有大概的容貌
但是没有细节...
All the features
but no details...

419
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,791
没有特征 没有线条
no character, no lines.

420
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,708
它不是具人类尸体
It's no dead man.

421
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,708
你家有拓印台吗？
Have you got
an ink pad around the house?

422
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,791
桌子上有一个
干嘛用？
There's one in the desk.
Why?

423
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,958
我想提取一下这具躯体的指纹
I want to take
the corpse's fingerprints.

424
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,250
这肯定是具死尸 不然还能是什么？
Of course
it's a dead man.

425
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,000
我不知道 但是我有一种感觉...
I don't know,
but I've got a feeling that...

426
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,833
我知道这听起来很疯狂
但是如果我做一下尸体解剖的话...
I know this sounds crazy,
but if I should do an autopsy...

427
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,958
我想每个器官大概都是完美无损的...
I think I'd find every organ
in perfect condition...

428
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,208
完美无缺
就像这具躯体外表看起来那样...
as perfect
as the body is externally...

429
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,208
躯体状况良好
everything in working order.

430
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,291
准备就绪 把那个拿过来
All set to go. Hold that down.

431
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,708
没有指纹...
These are blank.

432
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,000
像是在等待脸部完成...
Waiting for the final
finished face...

433
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,625
...以后才会变出来
to be stamped onto it.

434
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:57,250
但 是谁的脸？
But whose face?

435
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,125
告诉我
Tell me that.

436
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,500
我想我们可以先喝一杯
We could all use a drink.

437
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,083
喝波本可以吗？
Bourbon all right?

438
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,250
好的
Fine.

439
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,833
我不喝 谢谢
Not for me, thanks.

440
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,125
米尔斯 告诉我 是谁的脸？
Miles, answer me.
Whose face?

441
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,000
我连一点点头绪都没有...
I haven't the slightest idea...

442
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,291
你有吗？
have you?

443
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,708
你...你觉得那玩意有多高？
How tall would you say
that thing is?

444
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,708
哦 大概5英尺10英寸（1米78）左右
Oh, 5'10", thereabouts.

445
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,708
有多重？
How much does it weigh?

446
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:25,250
比较瘦小
大概140磅
It's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.

447
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,500
杰克身高5英尺10英寸
体重140磅
Jack's 5'10"
and weighs 140 pounds.

448
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,250
泰迪 能不能别再一派胡言了！
Teddy, will you stop
talking nonsense?

449
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,250
亲爱的 抱歉
但是我没有乱讲
I'm sorry, darling,
but it isn't nonsense.

450
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,250
贝基 你不认为我在瞎说 是不是？
Becky, you don't think
it's nonsense, do you?

451
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,583
当然是瞎说啦
Of course it is.

452
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,250
杰克就在这里 站在你面前啊
Jack's standing here
in front of you.

453
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,666
我当然站在这了 而且正在血流成河
Of course I am,
bleeding to death.

454
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,833
劳驾
Excuse me.

455
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,000
知道吗？
You know what?

456
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,291
我很遗憾 你保住了性命
I'm afraid you may live.

457
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,791
好了 这样就没事了
Here, this should fix it.

458
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,750
米尔斯 我们要不要报警...
Miles,
shouldn't we call the police...

459
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,750
然后让他们把这具死尸搬走？
and have them take
that dead body out of here?

460
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,750
我很抱歉
这并不是一具尸体
I'm afraid
it isn't just a dead body.

461
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,250
多谢
Thanks.

462
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,708
我很好奇...
I wonder if...

463
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,208
什么？
What?

464
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,041
我好奇
这些事情之间是否有什么关联
I wonder
if there's any connection.

465
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,833
你指的是什么？
What do you mean?

466
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,208
有一些奇怪的事情正在
圣米拉缓缓拉开序幕
There's something
strange afoot in Santa Mira.

467
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:27,708
考夫曼医生管它叫
传染性的集体歇斯底里性癔病
Dr. Kauffman calls it
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

468
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,208
贝基的表妹就得了这个病
Becky's cousin's got it,
for one.

469
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,458
她认为她的叔叔和婶婶...
She thinks that her uncle
and her aunt...

470
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,208
不再是她的叔叔和婶婶
aren't her uncle and her aunt.

471
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,708
已经出现多例这样的幻想症了
There's several cases
of such delusion.

472
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,708
这个东西还没有完全化身为你的样子...
This isn't you yet...

473
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,708
但从结构上来说显然是及其相近了
but there is
a structural likeness.

474
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,458
真不可思议
It's fantastic.

475
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,541
这玩意出现在这里一定有什么原因
There must be some reason
this is here.

476
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,583
要不要坐下来...
Would you be willing
to sit up...

477
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,541
然后等着瞧你这位“朋友”
接下来会发生什么？
and see what your friend's
next move is?

478
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:55,000
如果到早上还没有什么动静
我们就报警
If nothing happens by morning,
call the police.

479
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,500
如果发生了些什么呢...
If something happens...

480
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,333
就给我打电话 好吗？
call me, will you?

481
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,000
你知道我会的
You know I will.

482
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,083
晚安 放松点
Good night.
Take it easy.

483
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,250
好的
Sure.

484
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,583
不会发生什么的
Nothing will happen.

485
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,833
晚安 贝基
Good night, Becky.

486
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,000
如果真的发生了什么...
If it does...

487
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,916
一定会是个令人毛骨悚然的
恐怖小说的好素材
it'll make a charming,
bloodcurdling mystery story.

488
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,416
我很谨慎地没有让贝基察觉出来...
I was careful
not to let Becky know...

489
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,708
但当时我真的被吓坏了
but I was really scared.

490
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,916
丹·考夫曼对于
镇上发生的怪事的解释...
Dan Kauffman's explanation
of what was wrong in town...

491
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,291
歇斯底里的集体性癔病...
mass hysteria...

492
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,291
解释不了为什么杰克的台球桌上
会有那样一具躯体
couldn't explain away that body
on Jack's billiard table.

493
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:51,416
进来吧
我先去开灯
Come in
while I turn the lights on.

494
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,708
你真是个奔放的少妇...
You're a forward wench...

495
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,750
为了强吻我 把我拉到这漆黑的走廊里来
dragging me into a dark hallway
to be kissed.

496
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,041
我把你拉到漆黑的走廊里...
I'm dragging you
into a dark hallway...

497
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:59,291
是因为今晚我怕黑
because I'm scared of the dark
tonight.

498
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:01,458
我最好留下来把你裹在怀里
I'd better stay
and tuck you in.

499
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,000
那样就太疯狂了
That way lies madness.

500
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,875
疯狂又怎么啦？
What's wrong with madness?

501
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,708
就是太疯了
晚安
Madness.
Now good night.

502
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,708
想来你俩也该到家了
It's about time
you two got home.

503
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:22,625
爸 这么晚你在地下室干什么？
Dad, what are you doing
in the basement this late?

504
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,041
整理杂物
Working in my shop.

505
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,291
想来点酒吗 大夫？
Want a nightcap, doc?

506
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,625
不 谢了
时间不早了
No, thanks.
It's kind of late.

507
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,708
改天奉陪
晚安
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.

508
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:31,708
晚安
Good night.

509
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,708
晚安 米尔斯
Good night, Miles.

510
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:07,583
啊！
Aaah!

511
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,250
看呐 杰克！
Look, Jack!

512
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,250
它变成你了！是你！
It's you! It's you!

513
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,166
不 不！
千万不要靠近它！
No, no!
You mustn't go near it!

514
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:15,166
快离开这里！拜托！
Get out of here! Please!

515
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,666
求你！
Please!

516
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,166
米尔斯！
Miles!

517
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,166
发生什么了 杰克？
What happened, Jack?

518
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,666
泰迪说屋里的那个生物变成了我...
Teddy says the thing
in our place is me...

519
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,583
连受伤的割伤都出现了
right down
to the cut on my hand.

520
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,000
我赶紧跑去看它
I didn't wait to look.

521
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,166
它活过来了！是活的！
It's alive! It's alive!

522
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,666
那受伤的伤口在流血！
The hand was cut and bleeding!

523
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,708
位置也挪动了！
And the position
of the body had changed!

524
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,458
来 这里 吃了这个
Here, here. Take this.

525
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,875
我这就给丹尼·考夫曼打电话
I'll call Danny Kauffman.

526
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,666
你好！
Hello?

527
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,875
你好 丹尼？
Hello, Danny?

528
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,041
是的！
Yeah?

529
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,333
有情况发生了
我必须立刻见你
Something's happened.
I've got to see you.

530
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,416
你能迅速赶过来吗？
Will you get over here fast?

531
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:14,458
非常重要的事情
It's important.

532
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,958
哦...好的
Oh... OK.

533
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,875
他在路上了
He's on his way.

534
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,708
我去弄点咖啡就过来
I'll make some coffee
and be right with you.

535
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,125
好主意 米尔斯
谢了
Good deal, Miles.
Thanks.

536
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,958
对了 贝基怎么样？
她没事吧？
What about Becky?
Do you think she's all right?

537
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,416
爸 这么晚你在地下室做什么？
Dad, what are you
doing in the basement this late?

538
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:43,791
整理杂物
Working in my shop.

539
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,125
我不知道当时是什么情况...
I don't know what it was...

540
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,416
大概是种预感...
call it a premonition...

541
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:52,416
忽然间 我感受到了贝基身边的危险气息
but suddenly, I had the feeling
that Becky was in danger.

542
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:54,416
我尽我所能地迅速向她家赶去
I had to get to her
as quickly as possible.

543
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,583
正要按门铃的时候...
I was going
to ring the bell...

544
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,833
突然我的预感告诉我 行事要万分谨慎
but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.

545
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:21,750
这屋子里有问题
Something was wrong
in this house.

546
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,291
贝基
Becky.

547
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:15,791
贝基！
Becky!

548
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,833
米尔斯 能告诉我到底发生了什么吗？
Miles, will you tell me
what happened?

549
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,125
同样的东西
The same thing.

550
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,583
我又找到了一具...
I found another one...

551
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,291
在贝基家的地下室里...
in the cellar
at Becky's house...

552
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,833
我站在那里盯着它的时候 它正在活转起来
coming to life
while I stood there watching it.

553
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,333
那是贝基
It was Becky.

554
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:02,125
是吗？我想看看这两具躯体中的任意一个
Yeah? I want to see
one of these bodies.

555
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,625
好的
All right.

556
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,500
你先上床去休息
你陪着她
You're going to bed,
and you're staying with her.

557
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,791
穿上外衣
我们先去看看杰克的那个
Put on your clothes.
We'll go to Jack's first.

558
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,291
你这有咖啡吗？
Got any coffee around here?

559
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:12,875
有
厨房里能找到
Yeah.
You'll find some in the kitchen.

560
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,791
他不相信我的话 贝克
He doesn't believe me, Beck.

561
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,958
他会相信的
He will.

562
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,875
有人在耍花招
Somebody's playing games!

563
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,000
这下麻烦了
Rough ones.

564
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,625
这里有一处血迹
There's a blood spot.

565
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:38,166
你们看到的东西是个被杀掉的可怜的尸体
What you saw was the body
of a murdered man.

566
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,791
仔细检查过了吗？
Did you examine it carefully?

567
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,958
是的
Yes.

568
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,041
我实在不知道它到底发生了什么
I don't know
what's happened to it.

569
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,416
那并不是一具普通的尸体
上面没有任何特征
It wasn't an ordinary body.
There wasn't a mark on it.

570
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,541
我也仔细检查过了
连任何蛛丝马迹都没有
I checked it, too.
Not a scratch.

571
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:48,791
有这样一种杀人手法...
You can kill a man...

572
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,833
用削尖的细冰椎刺入大脑的话...
by shoving an ice pick
into the base of his brain...

573
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:53,375
只会留下一个肉眼几乎看不见的微小创口
leaving a puncture so small
the naked eye can't see.

574
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:56,000
妈的 你在无视事实真相
这压根就不是一具普通的尸体
You're ignoring the fact
this wasn't a normal body.

575
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,708
而且你也听到泰迪提到它手上的伤口
What about the hand
Teddy mentioned?

576
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:01,083
泰迪的胡言乱语我听过太多了
全部都是扯淡
I heard lots of things
Teddy said and none made sense.

577
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:03,291
等等 伙计
当时我也在场
Hold on, pal.
I was here, too.

578
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,083
米尔斯也在
So was Miles.

579
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,333
瞧 我们提取了它的指纹
Look, we took his fingerprints.

580
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,250
看看这个吧
告诉我为什么它没有指纹
Look at that.
Tell me why it didn't have any.

581
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,875
他不喜欢留下指纹
所以用强酸洗掉了
He didn't want any,
so he took them off with acid.

582
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,625
别试图用常识去解释一切了
Stop trying
to rationalize everything.

583
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,458
我们手边的这事是个谜
We have a mystery on our hands.

584
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,916
是啊 的确是个谜
Sure. A real one.

585
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:20,416
到底是谁的尸体
并且它现在在哪里
Whose body was it,
and where is it now?

586
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,083
只不过完全是个普普通通的谜题而已
A completely normal mystery.

587
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,916
别管它现在在哪里
这件事绝不会超越人类的经验范围
Whatever it is, it's well within
the bounds of human experience.

588
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,583
而且我也不认为你们能让它超越
Don't blow things
out of proportion.

589
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,958
如果不是因为我在贝基家的地下室看到的东西
我才不会像现在这样
I wouldn't if I hadn't
looked in Becky's cellar.

590
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,791
我在那看到的躯体 你又怎么解释？
How do you explain the body
I saw there?

591
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,416
我不认为你看到了任何东西
I don't think you saw one.

592
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,750
你也不相信我在这看到的？
And the body here?

593
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,125
我知道你在这看到了
其他的三个人也都看到了
I know you saw it.
Three others saw it, too.

594
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,875
但另外一个是我梦见的还是什么？
But I dreamed up
the second one?

595
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,958
医生也是会产生幻觉的
Doctors can have
hallucinations, too.

596
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:42,041
人类的精神是种奇妙的存在
The mind is a strange
and wonderful thing.

597
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:44,416
甚至也许永远都不能够被完全彻底地解读
I'm not sure it'll ever be able
to figure itself out.

598
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,958
其它的事物或许都可以--
从原子 到宇宙--
Everything else, maybe...
from the atom to the universe...

599
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,375
任何事物 除了人类的精神世界
everything except itself.

600
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,875
不管怎么说
我看到了贝基的分身...
Nevertheless,
I saw Becky's double...

601
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,291
而我们在这里见到的那具躯体...
and the body that we saw here...

602
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,458
化成了令人不舒服的 酷似杰克的东西
bore an uncomfortable
resemblance to Jack.

603
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:56,125
极度令人不舒服
Mighty uncomfortable.

604
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,500
好吧 让我们去贝基家瞧瞧
Let's go to Becky's
and have a look.

605
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,791
好吧 你女朋友的分身在哪里？
Where's your
girlfriend's double?

606
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,958
好 怀疑论者
打开这个盖子
OK, skeptic,
lift the lid.

607
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:20,083
有具躯体在里面吧
对吗？
There's a body here,
all right.

608
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,791
- 那就是贝基的分身
- 当然是
- It's Becky's double.
- It sure is.

609
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,125
你再来看看
Take another look.

610
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:29,541
现在你看
你根本就没在这里看见过什么
Now you see it,
now you don't.

611
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:32,500
它之前就在那里的--
被那个毯子裹着
It was there...
half-hidden by that blanket.

612
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,666
你说你是刚刚才在这里看见过的
You said
you saw it there just now.

613
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:36,833
我以为我看到了
I thought I did.

614
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,750
今晚你为何跑到贝基家里来？
Why did you come here
tonight?

615
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,458
你在杰克家看到了一个死人...
You'd seen a dead man
at Jack's...

616
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,791
身材普通的人
an average-sized man.

617
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,958
死去的脸上
线条柔和没有棱角...
The face in death
was smooth and unlined...

618
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,500
表情空洞
这是常有的事
bland in expression,
which often happens.

619
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,958
你只是刚刚才开始注意到...
You had just become aware...

620
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,791
这一场奇怪的 无法用常识解释的
歇斯底里的流行性集体癔病
of a curious, unexplainable,
epidemic mass hysteria.

621
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,958
男人 女人 孩子们
突然都开始坚信...
Men, women, and children
suddenly convinced themselves...

622
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,875
身边的亲人不再是原本的亲人...
that their relatives weren't
their relatives at all...

623
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:58,125
所以你的意识开始欺骗你...
so your mind
started playing tricks...

624
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,250
现实变得不再真实
and reality became unreality.

625
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,208
在你眼里那个死人变成了杰克的分身
The dead man became
Jack's double in your eyes.

626
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,375
得了吧 好吗 丹
Come off it, Dan.

627
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,541
我知道这些听起来难以置信...
I know
it's all hard to believe...

628
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:09,333
但的的确确是可能发生的事情--
哪怕是我这样的巫医也不一定能躲得过
but these things happen...
even to witch doctors like me.

629
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:12,083
我在这看见她了！
千真万确！
I saw her here!
She was real!

630
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:14,125
你当然看到了 从每一个细节...
You saw her
in every tiny detail...

631
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:16,500
就像任何一个人看到
任何其它事物一样的鲜活生动...
as vividly as anyone
has ever seen anything...

632
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,875
但那仅存在于你的脑海中
but only in your mind.

633
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,750
丹尼你可以一整晚都在这里阐述理论
但你说服不了我
Danny, talk all night,
but you're not convincing me.

634
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,416
天啊你们在我家地下室干什么？
What are you doing in my cellar?

635
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,416
用来做诊室
这两位先生是病人...
Using it for an office.
These gentlemen are patients...

636
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,750
急需要精神科的治疗
badly in need
of psychiatric treatment.

637
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,708
他们一直在做噩梦
They've been having nightmares.

638
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:36,000
要是喝多了
你们最好现在醒醒酒
If you're drunk,
you'd better sober up quick.

639
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,291
警察正在来这里的路上
The police are coming.

640
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:38,625
不不 我们没醉
No, we're not drunk.

641
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,750
不是那么简单的事
拿把椅子过来
Nothing that simple.
Pull up a chair.

642
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,291
怎么了 你们都有毛病吧？
Why, you're all crazy.

643
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,750
嘿 这里发生了什么？
What's going on down there?

644
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,750
你好 尼克
很高兴见到你
Hello, Nick.
Glad to see you.

645
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,791
这两位先生不用专门再跑一趟去警局了
You saved these two characters
a trip to the station.

646
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:54,541
他们想报警 发现了一具尸体
后来它却不见了
They want to report
finding a body and losing it.

647
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:56,291
在哪儿？什么时候？
Where? When?

648
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,333
大概晚上7点左右在我家
At my place about 7:00.

649
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,916
为什么你们时隔这样久才报警？
Why did you
wait so long to report it?

650
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:02,375
你知道些什么吧 大夫？
You know better than that, doc.

651
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:05,958
呃 那时一具很诡异的躯体...
It was a curious sort
of a body...

652
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:09,333
然后 只是突然就找不到它了
and then it wasn't there
anymore.

653
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,750
我有个好主意 你们俩都该进局子了
I have a good mind
to throw you both in jail.

654
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,083
如果你看见那玩意
你就会明白为什么我们等了这么长时间
If you'd seen it,
you'd understand why we waited.

655
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:18,250
瘦小的男人...身高5英尺10英寸...
Thin man... 5'10"...

656
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,166
指纹被强酸抹掉了？
fingerprints burned off
with acid?

657
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:23,541
刚刚还在太平间看到它
Just seen it on the slab
in the morgue.

658
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:24,791
出现在一个燃烧的草垛旁边...
Turned up
in a burning haystack...

659
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:28,250
就两个多小时前 在迈克·加斯纳南边的牧场
on Mike Gessner's south pasture
two hours ago.

660
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,666
好了 散了吧！
Now break it up!

661
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,291
各回各家！
Go on home!

662
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,916
好吧 你赢了
收拾走人吧
You win.
Pick up the marbles.

663
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,958
早安
Good morning.

664
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:56,791
有橙汁
Orange juice.

665
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:58,666
谢谢
Thank you.

666
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:00,458
想要吃哪种蛋？
How do you
like your eggs?

667
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:02,125
你想怎么做就怎么做
Any way you'd like.

668
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,375
煮蛋 两分钟？
Boiled, two minutes?

669
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,541
两分钟？
Two minutes?

670
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,041
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

671
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,333
好
OK.

672
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:09,916
知道吗...
You know...

673
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:12,958
昨晚把你从床上抱走挺麻烦的...
dragging you out of bed
last night was some trouble...

674
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,333
但是很值得
but it was worth it.

675
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,458
说真的 米尔斯
Seriously, Miles.

676
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,416
什么声音？
What was that?

677
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,916
是谁？
Who is it?

678
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,625
煤气收费员
It's the gas man.

679
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:27,833
早上好啊大夫
Morning, doc.

680
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:31,208
早上好 查理
Good morning, Charlie.

681
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,458
我猜我大概有点神经过敏
I guess I'm a little jittery.

682
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,416
睡眠不足的缘故
Not getting enough sleep.

683
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:36,125
我不会烦扰你的
I won't bother you anymore.

684
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,375
把计费表放在露台了
Putting a meter outside
on the patio.

685
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,583
好的
OK.

686
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,958
天啊 鸡蛋要煮过头了
The eggs will be hard-boiled.

687
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,500
你也会为你丈夫这样做吗？
Did you do this
for your husband?

688
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,666
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

689
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,375
难道你妻子不会做这些么？
Didn't your wife
do this for you?

690
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,208
当然 她热爱烹饪
Yes. She liked to cook.

691
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,375
这就是我现在为何成了
单身汉的其中一个原因--
That's one of the reasons
why I'm single...

692
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:54,416
晚餐上桌时
我几乎从未露过脸
I never was there
when dinner was on the table.

693
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:55,875
所以听我的建议...
Take my advice...

694
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:57,583
最好别跟医生搞在一起
and don't get mixed up
with a doctor.

695
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:58,958
他们几乎从不在家
They're seldom at home.

696
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,958
如果我告诉你...
What would you say
if I told you...

697
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,458
我已经跟一名医生搞上了会怎样？
I was already
mixed up with a doctor?

698
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,875
我会说简直美好得令人难以置信
I'd say it was too good
to be true.

699
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:08,416
这种事情
时常会突如其来地发生
Things like this
can happen all of a sudden.

700
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,833
什么叫“突如其来”？
对于两个...
What's "all of a sudden"
about two people...

701
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,833
几乎已经做了一辈子密友的人
who've been friends
most of their lives?

702
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,000
早安
Good morning.

703
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,291
我想我闻到了咖啡的香味
I thought
I smelled some coffee.

704
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,458
为什么没喊我起床呢？
Why didn't you give me a call?

705
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,750
我不想把泰迪吵醒
I didn't want to wake Teddy.

706
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,500
哦 她早醒了 昨晚睡得很好
She's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.

707
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,250
不错
Good.

708
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,166
不过我不认为她应该马上跟我回家
But I don't feel
she should go home right away.

709
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:30,416
介意我们多留一会吗？
Would you mind taking in
boarders for a while?

710
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:33,750
还是说你有其他别的什么安排？
Or do you have something else
in mind?

711
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,416
我在琢磨一些事情...
I was toying with an idea...

712
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,875
不过你们当然可以留下
but you can stay.

713
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,625
给 杰克
Here, Jack.

714
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:41,750
谢了 宝贝
我给泰迪送上去
Thank you, doll.
I'll take it to Teddy.

715
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:53,916
米尔斯 你是否帮我安排了预约...
Miles, did you make
that appointment for me...

716
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,083
跟你的那个精神科医生见面
with the psychiatrist?

717
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,583
是的 2点
Yes. 2:00.

718
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:59,750
我想不需要了
我觉得自己好蠢
I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.

719
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,291
我今早一睁眼
觉得什么事都没有了
I woke up this morning,
and everything was all right.

720
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,625
- 你都不知道我感到有多轻松
- 是的 我明白
- You don't know my relief.
- Yes, I do.

721
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:07,291
回去给贝基打个电话告诉她这件事好吗？
她一直好担心你
Will you call Becky
and tell her? She was worried.

722
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:08,458
好的
All right.

723
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,958
她现在在我家
She's at your house.

724
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:11,500
在你家？为什么？
At your house? Why?

725
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,125
一言难尽
不过她会跟你解释的
It's a long story,
but she'll tell you about it.

726
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,583
贝基还在他家
Becky's still at his house.

727
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:36,875
好吧
All right.

728
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,416
早安啊
Good morning.

729
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,375
早上好 莎莉
Good morning, Sally.

730
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:44,833
快去瞧瞧谁在会客室
Take a peek at what's
in the reception room.

731
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,291
妈妈 为什么我们不回家呢？
Mother,
why don't we go home?

732
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,041
马上就回去 吉米
In a little while,
Jimmy.

733
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:59,250
他康复得很迅速嘛
He certainly made
a quick recovery.

734
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,875
我想我们都是这样的
I guess we all have.

735
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,125
但开车回家的路上...
But driving home...

736
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,458
我的脑海中浮现出很多无解的疑问
I had a lot of questions
and no answers.

737
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,416
吉米和威尔玛怎么会在一夜之间恢复常态？
How could Jimmy and Wilma
seem so normal now?

738
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:13,333
很明显我还没有为他们做任何治疗
Surely I had done nothing
to cure them.

739
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:17,291
也许他们是想让我安下心来
可是为什么呢？
Maybe they wanted me
to feel secure, but why?

740
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,791
好啊...
Well...

741
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:21,791
但愿你没忘了买牛排
I hope
you didn't forget the steaks.

742
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,291
我从不忘事
I never forget anything.

743
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:26,291
别担心他
在这方面他口碑良好
Don't worry about him.
He's completely housebroken.

744
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,958
我想来点马提尼  贝克
I need a martini, Beck.

745
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,208
洋葱还是橄榄口味？
Onion or olive?

746
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,500
无所谓
我只是想浇在炭上
Doesn't matter.
I want to pour it on the coals.

747
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,666
这玩意老是点不着
They just won't burn.

748
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,625
哦 马提尼可不够烈
A martini isn't dry enough.

749
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,833
我去帮你找些可以点火用的东西
I'll get you something
that'll start it.

750
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,500
这杯是给你喝的
For drinking purposes.

751
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,625
你的身材看起来真是凹凸有致
You're looking shipshape.

752
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,166
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

753
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,416
拿来了
Here we are.

754
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:19,083
杰克！杰克！
Jack! Jack!

755
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,750
呕...
Ugh.

756
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,958
看起来像巨型豆荚！
They're like huge seedpods!

757
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:34,583
这一定就是形成我家密室里那躯体的玩意！
This must be how that
body in my closet was formed.

758
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,875
米尔斯 它们是哪来的？
Where are they from?

759
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,208
我也不知道
如果是种子或者豆荚那样的东西...
I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods...

760
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,083
它们大概一定是从什么地方的
植物上长出来的
they must grow someplace
on a plant.

761
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,875
并且某些人或者东西
要它们去复制人类的躯体...
And somebody or something wants
this duplication to take place.

762
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,583
但一旦它们完成复制的时候...
But when they're finished...

763
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:47,750
我们的躯体会发生什么？
what happens to our bodies?

764
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,958
我毫无头绪
I don't know.

765
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,125
当整个步骤完成的时候...
我们的本体可能...
When the process is complete,
probably the original...

766
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,625
会被毁灭或瓦解...
is destroyed or disintegrates...

767
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:53,750
不！等等！
No! Wait!

768
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,250
抱歉
但我可不想亲眼目睹...
Sorry,
but I take a dim view...

769
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,875
自己被毁灭的惨剧发生
of watching my own destruction
take place.

770
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:59,208
在它们完全生长成型之前
暂时不会有什么危险的
There isn't any danger
until they're completely formed.

771
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,000
昨晚在你家咱们已经见识过了
We learned that last night
at your house.

772
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
你并不会马上被统御
Your blank
didn't change right away.

773
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,041
在你沉睡之前都不会
Not until you fell asleep.

774
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,791
米尔斯 如果这种取而代之真的发生了...
Miles, when the change
does take place...

775
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,833
你认为会与本来的我们有什么区别吗？
do you suppose
there's any difference?

776
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,125
一定有
There must be.

777
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,916
威尔玛注意到了
小吉米也发现了
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.

778
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:18,291
还有我
So did I.

779
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,625
是我父亲...
My father.

780
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,250
这一定是昨晚那时他在...
That must be
what he was doing...

781
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,041
地下室所做的事情
安置这种东西
in the cellar last night...
placing one of these.

782
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:27,208
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

783
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,291
我感到有些不对劲...
但我还以为是我自己的问题...
I felt something wrong,
but I thought it was me...

784
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:30,958
因为我离开家乡太久了
because I'd been away
for so long.

785
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:33,250
一定要毁掉它们
所有的！
They must be destroyed,
all of them!

786
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,833
它们会变成--
每一个...
They will be...
every one of them.

787
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:37,083
我们现在必须去检查一下镇上所有的建筑...
We're going to have to search every
building

788
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,333
所有的房子
every house in town.

789
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,041
不管男女老少都得接受检查
Men, women, and children
have to be examined.

790
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,583
我们要开始求援了
我留在这看住它们
We've got some phoning to do. I'm going to stay
and watch them.

791
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:43,750
我陪你一起
I'm staying with you.

792
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,958
千万别报警！
Don't call the police!

793
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:46,208
尼克·格里维特压根就没有从...
Nick Grivett
didn't find any body...

794
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,791
什么燃烧的干草垛旁边发现任何尸体！
on a burning haystack!

795
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:55,333
为什么不打电话通知丹尼？没准他能帮上忙
Why don't you call
Danny? Maybe he can help.

796
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,833
丹尼？
Danny?

797
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,000
不
No.

798
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,791
恐怕现在再联系丹尼 也已经太迟了
I'm afraid it's too late
to call Danny, too.

799
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,250
那你打算怎么办？
What are you going to do?

800
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,416
求救
Get help.

801
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:05,458
但愿现在所发生的一切都还
仅限于在圣米拉的范围内！
I hope whatever's taking place
is confined to Santa Mira!

802
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,458
这里是接线员
Operator.

803
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,625
你好 我是本耐尔医生
这是紧急情况
This is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency.

804
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,791
我想跟洛杉矶的联邦调查局联系
I want to talk to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in L.A.

805
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:21,208
你确定能让他们相信你的话吗？
Can you convince them?

806
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,541
我别无选择
I've got to.

807
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:24,166
这些东西到底是从哪儿来的？
Where did they come from?

808
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:26,958
过去的几年间发现了很多
So much has been
discovered these past few years.

809
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,125
一切皆有可能
Anything is possible.

810
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:29,958
也许是核辐射...
Maybe the results
of atomic radiation...

811
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:32,250
对植物或动物产生的影响...
on plant life or animal life...

812
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,791
或者是什么诡异的外星生物
或基因突变一类的
some weird alien organism,
a mutation of some kind.

813
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:38,500
它们为什么要取代人类
也就是我们而存在？
Why should they take the form
of people... of us?

814
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,625
我不知道
I don't know.

815
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,833
无论是什么...
Whatever it is...

816
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,625
不管是出于智能还是生存本能...
whatever intelligence
or instinct it is...

817
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:47,291
那玩意能支配它们所形成的人类的血肉之躯...
that can govern the forming
of human flesh and blood...

818
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,166
只需要微薄的空气就可以...
out of thin air is...

819
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:50,666
简直是令人难以置信地强大...
well,
it's fantastically powerful...

820
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:52,833
直接超越了人类的理解范围
不堪设想
beyond any comprehension,
malignant.

821
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,083
你家地下室里的那具躯体仅仅只需要...
All that body
in your cellar needed...

822
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:56,458
拥有一个意识 而且它...
was a mind, and it was...

823
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,916
而且当时我睡着后
它正在尝试偷取我的意识
And it was taking mine
while I was asleep.

824
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:01,041
我真希望能亲手拿干草叉把它--
I could take
that pitchfork myself, and...

825
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,375
与洛杉矶的联线接通了 大夫...
On your call
to Los Angeles, Doctor...

826
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,916
没有人接电话
they don't answer.

827
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:07,500
再试试 它们的部门全天无休！
Try again! That office
is open day and night!

828
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,291
如果它们已经占领了电话系统
那我们就完蛋了
If they've taken over
the phone office, we're dead.

829
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,416
那是我码？
Is that me?

830
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,916
这是紧急情况！
紧急情况！
This is an emergency!
Emergency!

831
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:01,958
听着 这里...喂？
Look, there's been... Hello?

832
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,750
接线员 给我换个好点的线路
Operator,
get me a better connection.

833
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,166
我试试 大夫
I'll try, Doctor.

834
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:09,875
没用
It's no use.

835
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,875
洛杉矶那边的线路全都断了
All the Los Angeles circuits
are dead.

836
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,791
好吧 试试萨克拉门托那边！
给我接州政府
OK, try Sacramento!
Give me the state capital.

837
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,791
我要跟地方上的官员联系
I want to talk to the governor.

838
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:21,375
萨克拉门托线路忙 大夫
The Sacramento
circuits are busy, Doctor.

839
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,958
会再回你电话
I'll call you back.

840
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,625
好吧
All right.

841
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:28,125
好吧 我等你电话
All right.
I'll wait for your call.

842
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
我要把电话拿出去
I'll take the phone outside.

843
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:39,416
杰克 它们已经占领了电话系统
Jack, they've got the phone.

844
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:42,375
你和姑娘们开上你的车 先跑路
You and the girls take your car
and make a run for it.

845
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:44,291
到了附近的第一个镇 赶快求助
First town you get to,
yell for help.

846
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:45,500
那你呢？
What about you?

847
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,875
电话很快就会响
That phone
is gonna ring soon.

848
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:49,333
如果没有人接的话
他们可能会封锁出镇的道路
If nobody answers,
they'll block the roads.

849
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,500
我尽力拖住他们 直到你们走远以后
I'll stall them.

850
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,791
然后呢
Then what?

851
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,166
试试能否挖出幕后黑手
Try and find out
what's in back of this.

852
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:54,833
- 我留下
- 不！
- I'm staying.
- No!

853
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,666
米尔斯 别让我离开你
Miles,
don't ask me to leave you.

854
00:45:58,458 --> 00:45:59,625
杰克 快上路吧
Jack, get going.

855
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:01,166
米尔斯 我不能--
Miles, I can't...

856
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,708
总有人要先走
否则的话我们没办法搬救兵！
Somebody's got to go,
or we don't get help!

857
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,375
拜托 我们快离开这里吧
Please,
let's get out of here!

858
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,083
你们自己保重
Watch out for yourselves.

859
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,375
到电话那里去 在那呆着
Go over by the phone.
Stay there.

860
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:11,708
如果电话响了 喊我
If it rings, call me.

861
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,416
你好
Hello.

862
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:53,875
本耐尔大夫在吗？
Is Dr. Bennell there?

863
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:56,083
- 在 我去叫他
- 不要紧
- Yes. I'll get him.
- Never mind.

864
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,375
请转告他萨克拉门托那边
仍然线路忙就可以了...
Just tell him the Sacramento
circuits are still busy...

865
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,083
再问问他是否需要我继续尝试帮他转接
and ask him if he wants me
to keep trying.

866
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,416
好的 稍等
All right. Hold on.

867
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:03,541
米尔斯 那边还是线路忙！
Miles,
the circuits are still busy!

868
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:04,916
让她继续试！
Tell her to keep trying!

869
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:07,083
还有 再试试三藩市和华盛顿！
Also, try San Francisco
and Washington!

870
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,875
我们现在立即走人
We're getting
out of here right now.

871
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:16,083
去哪里？
Where are we going?

872
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,250
莎莉家
Sally's!

873
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:21,750
洛杉矶方面还是接不通
We're still unable
to get through to Los Angeles.

874
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,125
需要我继续尝试吗？
Do you wish me to keep trying?

875
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:25,416
本耐尔大夫？
Dr. Bennell?

876
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,291
本耐尔大夫？
Dr. Bennell?

877
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:30,125
我需要个可以信任的人...
I needed
someone I could trust...

878
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:33,250
然后我发现莎莉
我的护士 是最好的人选
and I figured Sally, my nurse,
was my best bet.

879
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,416
我决定试试给她打电话看看她是否在家
I decided to try to phone her
to see if she was at home.

880
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,416
也许公用付费电话线路还没有被占领
Maybe they hadn't
taken over the pay phones.

881
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,666
我试试付费电话
I'll try the pay phone.

882
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:42,666
嗨 麦克！
Hey, Mac!

883
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:44,458
哦 嗨 大夫 你好吗？
Oh, hi, doc.
How are you?

884
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:47,125
听着 可以赶快帮我加个几加仑吗？
我赶时间
Will you get me
a couple gallons fast?

885
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,291
当然
玛莎 大夫在赶时间
Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry!

886
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,625
你负责刷挡风玻璃 好吗？
Get the windshield, will you?

887
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,833
我得把钥匙拔下来去开油箱
I have to have the keys
to open the gas tank.

888
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:01,583
这条路那边有病人？
Somebody sick out this way?

889
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,416
那边出了事故
There's been an accident.

890
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,541
有意思 我们还没听到这个消息
Funny.
We haven't heard about it.

891
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:07,208
呃 刚刚才发生的事情
It just happened.

892
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:09,666
我还没来得及拨她的号码...
Before I could
even get her number...

893
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,750
就看见麦克靠近了我的车的后备箱
I saw Mac closing
the trunk of my car.

894
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,041
他或许是在帮我检查备胎情况...
He could have been
checking my spare tire...

895
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,666
但我不这么想
but I didn't think so.

896
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:15,833
这样就好了
That should do it.

897
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,041
谢谢你
Thank you.

898
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:18,250
都搞定了？
All set?

899
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,791
- 都搞定了 大夫
- 好的 多谢
- All set, doc.
- Fine. Thanks.

900
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:22,291
- 记我账上 好吗？
- 当然了 大夫
- Put it on my bill, will you?
- Sure, doc.

901
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,791
怎么了？
What's the matter?

902
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,166
我们得现在赶去莎莉家
We've got to make it
to Sally's house.

903
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,833
我不确定是否再有任何人可以信任了...
I wasn't sure
I could trust anyone...

904
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:27,333
但无论怎样 我想去莎莉那里碰碰运气
but I took a chance
and drove to Sally's anyway.

905
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:36,250
当我看到屋子前面停了很多车时...
When I saw several cars
in front of the house...

906
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,791
我决定谨慎点
I decided to play it safe.

907
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:45,000
有什么不对吗？
What's wrong?

908
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:48,250
也许没有 但还是先不要进去...
直到我确定那边安全为止
Probably nothing,but we're not going
in there until I'm sure it's safe.

909
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,416
握紧方向盘
随时准备立刻开车...
Slide under the wheel
and get out of here fast...

910
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:52,750
如果有任何人出现来抓我们的话
if anybody shows up
looking for us.

911
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,583
宝宝睡着了吗 莎莉？
The baby asleep yet, Sally?

912
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:23,541
还没呢
不过就快了...
Not yet,
but she will be soon...

913
00:50:23,541 --> 00:50:25,750
然后就再也不会哭闹了
and there'll be no more tears.

914
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,583
需要我把这个放在她的房间吗？
Shall I put this in her room?

915
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,250
是的 放在她的围床上
Yes. In her playpen.

916
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:32,458
不 等等
也许由我来更好
No, wait.
Maybe I'd better take it.

917
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:33,875
怎么不进屋去呢 米尔斯？
Why don't you go in, Miles?

918
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,583
我们大家都在等你呢
We've been waiting for you.

919
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,291
贝基 开车！
快！
Becky, start the car!
Quick!

920
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,041
贝基 走！
Becky, get going!

921
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,500
注意 所有部队...
Attention, all units...

922
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,416
注意 所有部队--
准备逮捕...
attention, all units...
apprehend and detain...

923
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:04,291
米尔斯·本耐尔医生和贝基·德里斯科尔...
Dr. Miles Bennell
and Becky Driscoll...

924
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:05,666
正在向北方前进...
now believed heading north...

925
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:07,625
开着一辆黑白相间的福特...
in a black and white
Ford sedan...

926
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:12,750
车牌号2-X-3-7-7-9-6
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

927
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,875
所有部队准备设置路障...
All units designated
as roadblocks...

928
00:51:14,875 --> 00:51:16,416
各就各位
move to your stations.

929
00:51:16,416 --> 00:51:17,625
情况紧急
It is urgent.

930
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,416
这两个人必须被逮捕...
These two persons
must be detained...

931
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:21,625
并且绝不允许他们离开圣米拉
and not permitted
to leave Santa Mira.

932
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,833
重复-- 情况紧急...
Repeat... it is urgent...

933
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:31,416
准备搜寻1955年产的黑白色福特车...
Be on the lookout for a 1955
black and white Ford sedan...

934
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:35,916
车牌号2-X-3-7-7-9-6
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

935
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:13,666
试试能不能赶到我的诊室
We'll try to make it
to my office.

936
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:15,166
从前面的公路右拐
Cut into that alley
on the right.

937
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:49,041
他会回来吗？
Do you think he'll come back?

938
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:52,083
我不认为天亮之前他们会再回来搜查
I don't think they'll
check again before morning.

939
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:55,166
到那时 杰克应该已经带着援兵赶回来了
By then, Jack should be here
with help.

940
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,541
如果杰克没有撑过去怎么办？
What if
Jack doesn't get through?

941
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,125
他一定会扛住的
He's gotta get through.

942
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:07,000
来 吃两片这个
Here. Take two of these.

943
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
能帮助你保持清醒
They'll help you to stay awake.

944
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:29,041
我们整晚都绝不能闭眼
We can't close our eyes
all night.

945
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:30,666
也许一睁眼就会变成...
We may wake up changed...

946
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:34,208
某种邪恶的 非人类的东西
into something evil and inhuman.

947
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:37,666
在实践中 我见过好多人...
In my practice,
I've seen how people...

948
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:40,333
逐渐失去人性
have allowed their humanity
to drain away.

949
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:44,041
只不过 这一过程是缓慢的
而非突如其来地
Only, it happens slowly
instead of all at once.

950
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:45,916
他们似乎毫不在意
They didn't seem to mind.

951
00:54:45,916 --> 00:54:48,000
那只是少数人而已 米尔斯
But just some people.

952
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,500
我们都一样...一点点的
All of us... a little bit.

953
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,041
心肠日益变硬
逐渐麻木起来
We harden our hearts
and grow callous.

954
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,041
只有到我们必须奋发搏斗
才能保存自己人性的时候...
Only when we have to fight
to stay human...

955
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:59,708
才能意识到它对我们来说有多么珍贵...
do we realize how precious
it is to us...

956
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,041
多么昂贵...
how dear...

957
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:05,166
就像你的存在对我的意义
as you are to me.

958
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:17,958
可能是杰克在找我们
Maybe that's Jack
trying to find us.

959
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:20,250
他不会笨到打来电话
He'd know better
than to use the phone.

960
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:23,083
他去哪儿了？
Where is he?

961
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,583
为什么他还不来呢？
Why doesn't he come?

962
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,208
就像每个周六的清晨一样
Just like any Saturday morning.

963
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:43,458
莱恩·珀尔曼
比尔·比特纳...
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner...

964
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:47,208
吉姆·克拉克和他的老婆雪莉
还有孩子们...
Jim Clark and his wife Shirley
and their kids...

965
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,958
我一生中所相识的所有人
people I've known all my life.

966
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,166
几点了？
What time is it?

967
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,208
七点四十五
Seven forty-five.

968
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:57,250
是的 我懂
Yeah, I know.

969
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,541
对于喧嚣的人流来说这也有点太早了
It's too early to be so busy.

970
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:01,583
他们都在那干什么？
What are they doing here?

971
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:03,583
有答案了
There's the answer.

972
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,166
那些一定都是刚到镇上的外乡人
There must be strangers in town.

973
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:09,125
他们得在这儿等车
They're waiting for the bus
to come and go.

974
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:11,791
只有在十一点的时候下一班才能来
There isn't another one
through here until 11:00.

975
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:08,291
农夫们
Farmers.

976
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:12,791
格里马尔迪  皮克斯利...

977
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:14,125
加斯纳！

978
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:15,625
新奥尔良市
Crescent City.

979
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:19,666
如果你在新奥尔良市有亲友 过来拿一个
If you have Crescent City
families, step to truck one.

980
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:21,708
新奥尔良市的...
Crescent City...

981
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,708
来第一辆车
the first truck.

982
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,208
红岸
Redbank.

983
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,208
所有在红岸有亲友的...
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

984
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:30,291
到第二辆车这里来
go to truck number two.

985
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:33,333
所有在红岸有亲友的...
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

986
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:34,708
第二辆车

987
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,541
哈文赫斯特...

988
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:38,208
第三辆车
the third truck.

989
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,375
哈文赫斯特--
第三辆车
Havenhurst...
the third truck.

990
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:46,208
米尔斯镇--第三辆车
Mill Town... the third truck.

991
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,208
春泉谷...
Valley Springs...

992
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:49,708
第三辆车
the third truck.

993
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:51,500
春泉谷 第三辆车...
Valley Springs...

994
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,000
先是咱们这个镇...
First our town...

995
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
然后是咱们的那些邻镇...
then all the towns around us.

996
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,500
像是传染性的恶疾...
It's a malignant disease...

997
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,500
逐渐蔓延到全国范围
spreading through
the whole country.

998
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,333
今天就这么多
That's all for today.

999
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,750
准备好明天再来
Be ready again tomorrow.

1000
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:20,208
我没时间等杰克了 你呆在这里
I can't wait for Jack
any longer. Stay here.

1001
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:21,375
你不是要出去吧
You're not going out there?

1002
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:22,916
我必须阻止他们！
I've got to stop them!

1003
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,583
等等！我们在这里还是安全的！
Wait! We're safe here!

1004
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,916
他们不在
但愿咱们来得还不算太迟
They're not here.
I hope we're not too late.

1005
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:32,416
杰克！谢天谢地！
Jack! Thank God!

1006
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:36,125
整个镇都被这些豆荚占领了！
The whole town's been
taken over by the pods!

1007
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:39,625
还没
还剩下你和贝基
Not quite.
There's still you and Becky.

1008
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:41,625
米尔斯 事情其实会简单很多...
Miles, it would have
been so much easier...

1009
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:43,083
如果你昨天晚上乖乖去睡觉的话
if you'd gone to sleep
last night.

1010
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:45,916
放松点
我们是来帮助你的
Relax.
We're here to help you.

1011
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:49,625
你懂的
You know better than that.

1012
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,125
需要我们将它们放在哪里？
Where do you want us
to put them?

1013
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,500
想看看它们是怎样成长的吗？
Would you like
to watch them grow?

1014
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,875
- 不用 谢了
- 把它们放在这
- No, thanks.
- Put them in there.

1015
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:58,083
没什么可怕的 我们不会伤害你
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.

1016
00:58:58,083 --> 00:58:59,958
等你明白了
你会感激涕零
Once you understand,
you'll be grateful.

1017
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:02,250
还记得起初我和泰迪是如何的抗拒它吗？
Remember how Teddy and I
fought against it.

1018
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:03,583
我们错了
We were wrong.

1019
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,083
你是说泰迪不再介意了？
You mean Teddy doesn't mind?

1020
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,583
当然不了 她现在的感觉跟我如出一辙
Of course not.
She feels exactly the way I do.

1021
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:09,083
放我们走！
Let us go!

1022
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,291
如果我们出了镇子 就不会再回来了
If we leave town,
we won't come back.

1023
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:13,875
我们可不能放你们走
你们是危险人物
We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.

1024
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:15,458
别抵抗了 米尔斯
没用的
Don't fight it, Miles.
It's no use.

1025
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:18,958
不久之后 你们都必须要睡觉的
Sooner or later,
you'll have to go to sleep.

1026
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:21,583
我在大厅等你
I'll wait for you in the hall.

1027
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:24,750
米尔斯 你和我一样是学术界人士
Miles,
you and I are scientific men.

1028
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,916
你能明白这发生的一切有多么奇妙
You can understand the wonder
of what's happened.

1029
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:29,708
仅仅设想一下
不到一个月之前...
Just think.
Less than a month ago...

1030
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:31,583
圣米拉还跟其它的城镇都一样--
Santa Mira
was like any other town...

1031
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:33,000
塞满了被烦恼困扰着的人们
people with nothing
but problems.

1032
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
这是突然从天上掉下来了解决之道
Then out of the sky
came a solution.

1033
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
这些在太空飘荡了不知多少年的种子...
Seeds drifting through space
for years...

1034
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
在农夫们的田里生了根
took root in a farmer's field.

1035
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
从种子里长出了豆荚...
From the seeds came pods...

1036
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,416
能够自我繁衍...
which had the power
to reproduce themselves...

1037
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:49,125
就像其他任何的生命形式一样
in the exact likeness
of any form of life.

1038
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:51,625
这就是一切是如何开始的...
So that's how it began...

1039
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:53,583
...天外来客
out of the sky.

1040
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:58,458
你的新肉体在里面生长成形
Your new bodies
are growing in there.

1041
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:01,458
他们会从每一个细胞开始统御你的器官...
They're taking you over
cell for cell...

1042
01:00:01,458 --> 01:00:02,958
从每一个原子
atom for atom.

1043
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:04,458
没用痛苦
There's no pain.

1044
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,208
一夜之间 在你的睡梦中...
Suddenly, while you're asleep...

1045
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:09,625
它们将吸收你的意识心智和记忆...
they'll absorb your minds,
your memories...

1046
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:13,208
然后你就在另外一个没有烦恼的世界重生了
and you're reborn
into an untroubled world.

1047
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:15,708
千人一面的世界？
Where everyone's the same?

1048
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:17,666
没错
Exactly.

1049
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:19,666
真是个好世界
What a world.

1050
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:22,708
我们并不是唯一幸存的人类
We're not the last humans left.

1051
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:24,583
剩下的人们会摧毁你们
They'll destroy you!

1052
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:28,166
等到明天 你就不会希望他们这样做了
Tomorrow,
you won't want them to.

1053
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,166
明天你就是我们中的一员了
Tomorrow, you'll be one of us.

1054
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:35,291
我爱贝基
I love Becky.

1055
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:37,750
明天 我还会有同样的感情吗？
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?

1056
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,416
压根就不需要什么爱
There's no need for love.

1057
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:42,333
没有情感？
No emotion?

1058
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:46,666
所以你就没有任何感情
只有生存的本能
Then you have no feelings,
only the instinct to survive.

1059
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:49,458
你失去了爱或被爱的能力！
我说的对吗？
You can't love or be loved!
Am I right?

1060
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:51,083
你说的就好像这很可怕一样
You say it
as if it were terrible.

1061
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:53,750
相信我 一点也不可怕
你又不是没爱过
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.

1062
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,250
不存在永恒的爱
从不
It didn't last.
It never does.

1063
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,833
爱，欲望，野心，信仰--
Love, desire, ambition, faith...

1064
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:03,916
没有这些东西 生活会变得好简单
相信我
without them, life's so simple,
believe me.

1065
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:06,875
我可不这么想
I don't want any part of it.

1066
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:08,750
你忘了些事 米尔斯
You're forgetting
something, Miles.

1067
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:09,916
什么？
What's that?

1068
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,208
你没有选择的余地
You have no choice.

1069
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,250
我猜咱们没得选了
I guess we haven't any choice.

1070
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,458
不错
Good.

1071
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,666
我想要去爱和被爱！
I want to love and be loved!

1072
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,041
我还想给你生孩子
I want your children.

1073
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:40,041
我不想活在一个没有爱 悲伤
或者美好的世界！
I don't want a world
without love or grief or beauty.

1074
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:42,291
我宁可死
I'd rather die.

1075
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:43,791
不
No.

1076
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,000
不要
Not

1077
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,666
除非没有任何出路了
unless there's no other way.

1078
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,291
为什么他们不能简单地给咱们打一针...
Why didn't they
give us a shot...

1079
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,791
或者吃点安眠药什么的呢？
or a sleeping pill or something?

1080
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:58,291
药品磨损人的心智
也许是这个原因
Drugs dull the mind.
Maybe that's the reason.

1081
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:09,458
哦不 行不通
No. It wouldn't work.

1082
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:12,333
我也许能放倒一两个
但是没把握搞定三个
I might get one or even two,
but I couldn't get three.

1083
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:14,000
你忘了些什么 亲爱的--有我
You're forgetting something,
darling... me.

1084
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,208
现在的局面并不是三对一
It isn't three against one.

1085
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:17,416
而是三对二
给我把刀
It's three against two.
Give me a knife.

1086
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:20,291
不行
No.

1087
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,500
那边
There.

1088
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,583
到桌子那里去
Go by the desk.

1089
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,583
里面发生了什么？
What's going on in there?

1090
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:02,250
米尔斯！
把门打开！
Miles!
Unlock the door!

1091
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,958
米尔斯 开门！
Miles, open the door!

1092
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:05,666
开门 米尔斯！
Open the door, Miles!

1093
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:07,333
啊！
Aah!

1094
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:11,083
开门！
Open the door!

1095
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,916
噢！啊！
Oh! Aah!

1096
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,458
哦！
Oh!

1097
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:39,250
我们唯一的希望就是开上高速路了
Our only hope is
to make it to the highway.

1098
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:53,791
呃 这个
That does it.

1099
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:56,583
唯一的另一条出路是前门...
The only other way
is out the front door...

1100
01:04:56,583 --> 01:04:58,250
而且那边一定有人在看守
and there's bound
to be somebody watching.

1101
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,833
我们得碰碰运气
We'll have to chance it.

1102
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,750
眼神放空一点
Keep your eyes
a little wide and blank.

1103
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,250
别表现出任何兴趣和激情
Show no interest or excitement.

1104
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:45,791
好吧 萨姆 我们终于殊途同归了
Well, Sam,
we're finally with you.

1105
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,000
他们应该会先通知我的
They were supposed
to let me know.

1106
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,666
头儿说他会先给警察局打电话 然后喊我
The chief said he'd phone
the station, then call me.

1107
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:52,291
他打过了 但是线路忙
He phoned,
but the line was busy.

1108
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:54,250
他在重拨
He's calling again now.

1109
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:57,041
啊！
Aah!

1110
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,541
看车！
Watch out!

1111
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,041
真对不起 米尔斯
I'm sorry, Miles.

1112
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:56,250
我是雅纳切克
他们跑了
This is Janzek.
They got away.

1113
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,458
打开警报
Turn the main siren on.

1114
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,291
嘿 台阶！
Hey! Stairs!

1115
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,750
就几步路了
It's only a few steps more.

1116
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:46,083
来啊！
他们往这边跑了！
Come on!
They went this way!

1117
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,291
他们在那上面！
They're over there!

1118
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,416
米尔斯 我做不到
Miles, I can't.

1119
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:40,458
我坚持不下去了
I can't go on.

1120
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:42,291
你一定行
Yes, you can.

1121
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:41,333
这是她的外衣！
他们一定在隧道里！
Here's her sweater!
They must be in the tunnel!

1122
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:54,125
看 汤米
你从那边追！
Look, Tommy,
you go that way!

1123
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:03,666
放弃吧！
你们逃不掉的！
Give up!
You can't get away from us!

1124
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:07,333
我们不会伤害你们的
放弃吧！
We're not going to hurt you!
Give up!

1125
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:19,541
他们没在隧道里
They're not in the tunnel.

1126
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,750
好吧 大伙儿 出来吧
来
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on.

1127
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:24,250
去山上搜查一下
大伙儿 走 起来
Let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.

1128
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:35,208
米尔斯 我感到无法再保持清醒了
Miles,
I can't stay awake much longer.

1129
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,625
我想他们应该都走了
I think they're all gone now.

1130
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:43,000
我们必须动身了
否则的话就永远也上不了高速了
We'd better start, or we'll
never make it to the highway.

1131
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:44,666
米尔斯 我从未听到过这样美好的声音
Miles, I've never heard
anything so beautiful.

1132
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:46,041
那说明我们并不是唯一仅存的...
It means we're not
the only ones left...

1133
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:48,166
懂得什么是爱的人类
to know what love is.

1134
01:12:48,166 --> 01:12:51,375
呆在这 并祈祷他们确实是人类
就像听起来的那样
Stay here, and pray
they're as human as they sound.

1135
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:52,750
再见 亲爱的
Bye, darling.

1136
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:51,250
这里是KCAA电台
您二十四小时无休的欢乐唱机...
This is station KCAA,
the 24-hour platter parade...

1137
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:52,541
音乐电台--
the station of music...

1138
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:24,333
贝基
Becky.

1139
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:27,875
贝基！
Becky!

1140
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:33,833
贝基？
Becky?

1141
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:37,708
贝基 你在哪儿？！
Becky, where are you?!

1142
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:39,416
我在这里 米尔斯
I'm here, Miles.

1143
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:44,208
你没睡着吧？
You didn't go to sleep?

1144
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:45,708
我好累
I'm so tired.

1145
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:48,916
他们不是人
外面有很多他们的人
They weren't people.
It was more of them.

1146
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,625
他们正在温室培育数以千计的豆荚
They're growing thousands
of pods in greenhouses.

1147
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,541
我们必须逃跑
We've got to get away.

1148
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:54,583
我精疲力尽了 米尔斯
I'm exhausted, Miles.

1149
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:56,583
我做不到了
I can't make it.

1150
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,750
不睡一觉的话 我们都做不到的
We can't make it
without sleep.

1151
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,583
是的 我们能行
Yes, we can.

1152
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:40,083
我睡着了 米尔斯
然后那个发生了
I went to sleep,
Miles, and it happened.

1153
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,875
噢 贝基...
Oh, Becky.

1154
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:45,041
他们说得对
They were right.

1155
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,041
我不该离开你的...
I should never have left you.

1156
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:49,750
别像个蠢货一样了
米尔斯 接受我们吧
Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.

1157
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:52,916
不
No.

1158
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:55,750
绝不！
Never!

1159
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:59,375
他在这里！
He's in here!

1160
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:01,500
抓住他！抓住他！
Get him! Get him!

1161
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:12,625
在我的生命中 有过很多害怕的时候...
I've been afraid
a lot of times in my life...

1162
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:14,541
但我从未体会到恐惧的真正含义...
but I didn't know
the real meaning of fear...

1163
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:18,625
直到当时亲吻贝基的那刻
until I had kissed Becky.

1164
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:21,041
只是短暂地陷入了睡眠
然后我所深爱的女孩就...
A moment's sleep,
and the girl I loved...

1165
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:23,791
变成了一心要置我于死地的异类敌人
was an inhuman enemy
bent on my destruction.

1166
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:26,250
那一刻的短暂入眠
扼杀了贝基的灵魂...
That moment's sleep
was death to Becky's soul...

1167
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,958
就像杰克和泰迪身上发生的一样...
just as it had been
for Jack and Teddy...

1168
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,833
还有丹·考夫曼和其他所有的人
and Dan Kauffman
and all the rest.

1169
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:31,416
他们的肉体现在已经了宿主...
Their bodies were now hosts...

1170
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:34,833
而里面藏匿的是外星生物
某种来自宇宙的生命形式...
harboring an alien form
of life, a cosmic form...

1171
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:37,583
那种为了生存
必须取代和统御所有人类存在的生命
which, to survive,
must take over every human man.

1172
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:39,375
所以我就跑 一直跑...
So I ran, I ran...

1173
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:41,833
就像小吉米那天一样夺命狂奔
I ran as little Jimmy
had run the other day.

1174
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:44,000
我唯一的希望就是逃离圣米拉...
My only hope was to get away
from Santa Mira...

1175
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,291
跑上高速公路...
to get to the highway...

1176
01:16:45,291 --> 01:16:47,541
去警告其他人这里发生了什么
to warn the others
of what was happening.

1177
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:04,208
等等！
Wait!

1178
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,708
由他去吧！
没人会相信她的话！
Let him go!
They'll never believe him.

1179
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:08,208
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

1180
01:17:08,208 --> 01:17:09,500
等等！
Wait!

1181
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,875
救命！救命！等等！
Help! Help! Wait!

1182
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:16,916
等等！停车！
停车听我说！
Wait! Stop!
Stop and listen to me!

1183
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:18,416
听我说！
Listen to me!

1184
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:22,416
那些人正在追杀我 他们不是人类！
Those people that are coming
after me! They're not human!

1185
01:17:22,416 --> 01:17:24,375
听我说！
我们的处境非常危险！
Listen to me!
We're in danger!

1186
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:26,250
走开！
Get out of here!

1187
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,708
你们都处于险境 请听我说！
You're in danger! Please!

1188
01:17:28,708 --> 01:17:30,375
滚开！
走！
Get out of here!
Go on!

1189
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:31,833
开车！
Get moving!

1190

听我说！
Listen to me!

1193
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:40,208
圣米拉已经没有人类幸存了！
There isn't a human being
left in Santa Mira!

1194
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:43,208
停车！
Stop!

1195

靠边停 我需要援助！

发生了很恐怖的事情！
Something terrible's happened!

1197

你喝多了 从街上走开！
You're drunk!
Get out of the street!

1198
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,750
走开！走！
Get out of here! Go on!

1199
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,291
你疯了吗？大蠢货！
Are you crazy,
you big idiot?

1200
01:18:05,291 --> 01:18:08,750
看呐！
你们这些傻瓜 你们深处险境！
Look!
You fools! You're in danger!

1201
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,250
看不见吗？
他们就在后面！
Can't you see?
They're after you!

1202
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:13,208
他们想要我们所有人的命！
They're after all of us!

我们的妻女 我们的孩子
所有人！

everyone!

1204

你是下一个！

1207
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:25,416
下一个！

1208
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:36,500
你一个字都不相信 是吧？
You don't believe
a word of this, do you?

1209
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,125
当然 我知道这听起来很奇异
但是它实实在在的发生了！
Sure, it's fantastic,
but it happened.

1210
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:40,291
别只是坐在那里用
正在估量拘束衣尺寸的眼神看我！
Don't just sit there
measuring me for a straitjacket!

1211
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:42,791
做些什么！拿起电话！请求援助
Do something! Get on the phone!
Call for help!

1212
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:46,750
唉！什么都没用！
What's the use?

1213
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:05,333
你认为精神理疗会有效吗？
What do you think?
Will psychiatry help?

1214
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:08,083
如果他说的这些仅仅是个噩梦的话 会的
If all this
is a nightmare, yes.

1215
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:09,416
当然只是个噩梦啦
Of course it's a nightmare.

1216
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:12,416
异世界来的植物取代地球上的人类
Plants from another world
taking over human beings.

1217
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:14,000
像三月的野兔一样疯狂
Mad as a March hare.

1218
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:19,083
这是什么情况？
What have we here?

1219
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:20,791
他开着大卡车闯红灯
He ran his truck
through a red light.

1220
01:19:20,791 --> 01:19:22,750
被一辆灰狗长途车从侧面撞到了...
Greyhound bus
smacked him broadside...

1221
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,000
翻了车
and tipped him over.

1222
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,416
把他送到手术室
Put him in the O.R.

1223
01:19:25,416 --> 01:19:27,208
替我接管本耐尔好吗？

for me?

1224
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,500
当然
Certainly.

1225
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,916
伤得有多重？
How badly is he hurt?

1226
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:32,458
双腿和左臂 全部粉碎性骨折
Both legs, left arm,
broken all to bits.

1227
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,166
我们当时得把他...
We had to dig him out...

1228
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:38,791
从一堆非常奇异
见所未见的东西下面挖出来
from under the most
peculiar things I ever saw.

1229
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:40,125
什么东西？
What things?

1230
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:41,291
我不知道那些事什么玩意
I don't know what they are.

1231
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:42,916
我从没有见过那样的东西
I never saw them before.

1232
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:45,875
看起来就像 呃...
超级巨型豆荚
They looked like, uh,
great big seedpods.

1233
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:48,208
豆荚？
Seedpods?

1234
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:49,750
这卡车是从哪里来的？
Where was the truck
coming from?

1235
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,083
圣米拉
Santa Mira.

1236
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:59,750
打开电台
拉响全面警报
Get on your radio
and sound an all-points alarm.

1237
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,625
封锁高速公路 阻止所有交通...
Block all highways
and stop all traffic...

1238
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:04,166
给州立的所有执法机关打电话
and call every law enforcement
agency in the state.

1239
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:08,958
接线员 麻烦帮我接联邦调查局
Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

1240
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:10,291
