2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,500
天外魔花

4
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,666
希尔大夫
Dr. Hill.

5
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,125
巴西特大夫
Dr. Bassett.

6
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,625
病人在哪里？
Where's the patient?

7
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,958
我真不想在这个时间
把你从床上拽起来
I hated
to drag you out of bed.

8
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:04,250
趁现在还来得及 放我走行吗？
Will you let me go
while there's still time?

9
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,250
你马上就会知道我为什么这么做了
You'll soon see why I did.

10
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,375
告诉这些白痴我没疯 好吗？
Will you tell
these fools I'm not crazy?

11
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,541
在一切都追悔莫及之前让他们听我说！
Make them listen to me
before it's too late!

12
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,541
我来听你说
I'll listen to you.

13
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,958
放开她
Let him go.

14
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,958
你是谁？
Who are you?

15
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,458
我是州立精神病院的希尔大夫
I'm Dr. Hill
from the state mental hospital.

16
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,083
我没疯！
I'm not insane!

17
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,583
放开他！
Let him go!

18
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,708
大夫 现在你必须认真听我说
Doctor,
now you must listen to me.

19
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,083
请你一定要理解我
You must understand me.

20
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,916
我也是名医生
我没疯
I am a doctor, too.
I am not insane.

21
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,375
- 我根本就没疯！
- 好吧 好吧
All right.

22
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:40,625
让我们坐下谈 医生
然后你告诉我到底发生了什么 好吗？
Suppose we sit down,
and you tell me what happened?

23
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,083
好 那是始于--
Well, it started...

24
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,583
对我来说
始于上个星期四...
for me,
it started last Thursday...

25
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,083
因为我的护士发来紧急通知
in response to an urgent
message from my nurse.

26
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:56,083
我从一个医学交流研讨大会上急忙赶回家
I'd hurried home
from a medical convention.

27
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:59,666
乍看之下
一切如常
At first glance,
everything looked the same.

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,333
但实际上并不是这样
It wasn't.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,125
某种邪恶的气息已悄悄笼罩了这个小镇
Something evil had taken
possession of the town.

30
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,625
这两件
These two.

31
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,125
给
Here you are.

32
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,583
谢谢先生
请拿好
Thank you, sir.
There you are.

33
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,083
多谢
Thank you.

34
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,833
费希尔先生，早上好啊
Morning, Mr. Fisher.

35
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,583
大夫！
Doc!

36
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,083
嗨呀 莎莉
Hiya, Sally.

37
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,583
嗨 欢迎回家
真高兴你回来了
Hi. Welcome home.
I'm glad you're back.

38
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,250
米基和宝宝情况如何？
How's Mickey and the baby?

39
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,541
他们挺好的 可是看起来似乎
圣米拉城里的每个人都需要看医生
Fine, but everybody else
in Santa Mira needs a doctor.

40
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,083
你的诊室都被病人塞满了
You've got an office
full of patients.

41
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,875
噢 不要啊
我第一天回来就这样？
Oh, no.
On my first day back?

42
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,291
他们之中有些人已经等了你两星期了
Some of them have
been waiting for two weeks.

43
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,416
为什么不让他们去找珀西
或者卡迈克尔大夫呢？我跟你说过的
Why didn't you send them
to Pursey or Carmichael?

44
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:41,625
可他们大多都不愿意
他们只想见你
Most of 'em wouldn't go.
They want to see you.

45
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,125
哦？
Oh?

46
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,166
他们有什么症状？
What's the matter with them?

47
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,500
他们就是不说
They wouldn't say.

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,833
你知道通常病人们都迫不及待
要描述自己的病症
Usually people can't talk enough
about what's ailing them.

49
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,833
比如说
沃利·埃伯哈德来了两次...
For instance,
Wally Eberhard was in twice...

50
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,458
而且打过三次电话
但他就是不谈自己有什么症状
and called three times,
but he wouldn't say about what.

51
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,666
有点意思
That's funny.

52
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,333
没有一个人愿意说--
从贝基·德里斯科尔...
Nobody would talk...
from Becky Driscoll...

53
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,833
到那个胖交警萨姆·雅纳切克
down to that fat
traffic cop Sam Janzek.

54
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,666
贝基·德里斯科尔？
我以为她在英国呢
Becky Driscoll?
I thought she was in England.

55
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:15,166
几天前她就回来了
而且她点名要见你
She got back a few days ago,
and she wanted to see you.

56
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,125
还对她有兴趣？
Are you still interested?

57
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,125
我对已婚妇女的兴趣仅限于
严谨的职业范围内...
My interest in married women
is strictly professional...

58
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,166
否则怎能长期抗拒你的诱惑
or yours would have been
a lost cause long ago.

59
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,833
- 研讨会怎么样？
- 棒极了
- How was the convention?
- Wonderful.

60
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,500
我宣读我的论文时
他们简直嫉妒得泪流满面
They wept with envy
when I read my paper.

61
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,416
回来！
MRS. GRIMALDl: Come back here!

62
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,583
吉米！
Jimmy!

63
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:38,041
怎么了
格里马尔迪太太？
What's the matter,
Mrs. Grimaldi?

64
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,083
没什么 他就是不愿意上学！
It's nothing. He just don't
want to go to school.

65
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,583
我要是你的话
就会去找她的老师谈谈
If I were you, I'd have
a talk with his teacher.

66
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,583
等有时间了我就去
MRS. GRIMALDl:
I will when I get time.

67
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,708
发生什么了
乔生病了吗？
What's the matter?
Has Joe been sick?

68
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,791
不 我们只是不再经营这个市场了
MRS. GRIMALDl: No.
We gave the stand up.

69
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,125
- 需要太多劳动力
- 哦
- Too much work.
- Oh.

70
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,000
那孩子的惊慌失措当时就应该让我明白...
The boy's
panic should have told me...

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,208
他所恐惧的绝不仅仅是上学...
it was more than school
he was afraid of...

72
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,833
还有那堆满垃圾的 倒闭了的菜市场...
and that littered,
closed-up vegetable stand...

73
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,125
也许也在暗示着些什么
should have
told me something, too.

74
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,625
我最后一次看见它的时候
还是在不到一个月之前...
When I last saw it,
less than a month ago...

75
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,250
那时它还是这条大路上
最整洁最繁忙的一个市场
it was the cleanest
and busiest stand on the road.

76
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,000
真是奇怪
That's strange.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,541
她也来找过你--
就在上周五
She was in to see you, too...
last Friday.

78
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,291
我曾尝试说服她去找珀西大夫
但她不愿意
I tried to get her to see
Doc Pursey, but she wouldn't.

79
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,458
她说只有你才能帮助她
She said only you
could help her.

80
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,708
好吧 不管她有什么毛病...
Whatever it was...

81
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,000
我想应该都不会很严重
it couldn't have been
too serious, I guess.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,500
一例轻微脑震荡 两例普通感冒...
One minor concussion,
two cases of the common cold...

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
还有六个已取消的预约
and six canceled appointments.

84
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,000
看来你急急忙忙把我拽回来
也并没有什么事嘛
Looks like you rushed me here
for nothing.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,500
我不明白...
他们都迫不及待要见你啊
I don't understand it.
They couldn't wait to see you.

86
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,000
不过今天下午你的日程也会排得满满的
But you're still booked up solid
for the afternoon.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,750
我打赌他们不会来
看那里 是沃利·埃伯哈德...
I bet they don't show.
Look, there's Wally Eberhard...

88
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,958
正在跟路人推销保险呢
talking somebody
into buying some insurance.

89
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,208
他一点问题也没有嘛
There's nothing wrong with him.

90
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,583
比尔·比特纳正要带他的小秘去吃午饭
Bill Bitner's taking
his secretary to lunch.

91
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,291
啊 说到午饭...
And speaking of lunch...

92
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,875
能否跟来找我的任何人说 我去用餐了？
will you tell whoever that is
that I'm out having mine?

93
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,041
本耐尔大夫在吗？
Is Dr. Bennell in?

94
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,958
是的 他在
Yes, he's here.

95
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,750
你认为他有空接待我吗？
Do you suppose
he has time to see me?

96
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,625
如果他没出什么毛病的话
If he hasn't,
something's wrong with him.

97
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,791
进去吧
Go right in.

98
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,250
贝基
Becky.

99
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,875
快五年了
Almost five years.

100
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,125
回家的感觉真好
It's wonderful to be home again.

101
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,375
我离开得太久了...
I've been away so long...

102
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,958
回到老家却觉得自己像个外乡人
I feel almost like a stranger
in my own country.

103
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,125
我没有预约就来了 但愿你别介意
Hope you don't mind my coming
without an appointment.

104
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,333
才不会
想做点什么？
Not at all.
What'll you have?

105
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,083
这周我们做推广促销的是阑尾切除术
We're pushing appendectomies
this week.

106
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,250
噢 米尔斯
Oh, Miles.

107
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,541
我不知道 或许我老是胡闹乱开玩笑
I don't know,
maybe I clown around too much.

108
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,541
用不了多久 我的病人们...
Pretty soon, my patients...

109
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,041
就会连我给他们开的阿司匹林都不敢信任了
won't trust me
to prescribe aspirin for them.

110
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,541
说真的 是有什么问题？
Seriously, what's the trouble?

111
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,750
是我表妹
It's my cousin.

112
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,708
威尔玛？
她怎么了？
Wilma?
What's the matter with her?

113
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,791
她出现了些 呃...
She has a...

114
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,416
我猜你们称之为“幻觉”
I guess you'd call it
a delusion.

115
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,791
你认识他叔叔吧？
艾拉叔叔？
You know her uncle?
Uncle Ira?

116
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,375
当然 我是他的大夫
Sure. I'm his doctor.

117
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,416
现在她自己认为他不是她的叔叔
She's got herself
thinking he isn't her uncle.

118
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,250
你指的是什么？
他们实际上没有血缘关系？
How do you mean?
That they're not really related?

119
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,958
她觉得他是个冒充的傀儡一类的...
She thinks
he's an impostor or something...

120
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,833
...某种只是外表看起来是艾拉叔叔的东西
someone who only looks like Ira.

121
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,250
你见过他了吧？
Have you seen him?

122
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,500
我就是刚从他那过来的
I just came from there.

123
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,000
他到底是不是艾拉叔叔呢？
Is he Uncle Ira,
or isn't he Uncle Ira?

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,166
当然是啦
Of course he is.

125
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,250
我跟威尔玛强调过了 可是没有用
I told Wilma that,
but it was no use.

126
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,000
拜托 你有空的话能否顺便过去和她聊聊？
Please, would you stop by
and have a talk with her?

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,583
莎莉说我整个下午的日程都排满了...
Sally says I'm booked up
for the afternoon...

128
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,250
不过你为什么不让她过来找我呢
but why don't you ask her
to come in and see me?

129
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,750
我试试吧
I'll try.

130
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,166
呃 共进午餐如何？
How about some lunch?

131
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,500
不行 我一会要去店里见爸爸
I can't.
I'm meeting Dad at the store.

132
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,416
你是什么时候回来的
When did you get back?

133
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,083
两个月前从伦敦回来的
I came back from London
two months ago.

134
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,541
之前我一直是在里诺
【里诺：美国有名的“离婚城市”
位于内华达州西部】
I've been in Reno.

135
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:23,708
里诺？
Reno?

136
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,541
里诺
Reno.

137
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,041
爸爸告诉过我你也曾待在那里
Dad tells me
you were there, too.

138
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,541
五个月前吧
Five months ago.

139
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,541
哦 真遗憾
Oh, I'm sorry.

140
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,041
我有同感
So was I.

141
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,541
我曾希望我们能在那相遇
I wanted it to work.

142
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:38,000
好吧 我想现在我们终于上了同一条船
I guess that makes us
lodge brothers now.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,208
是的
Yes.

144
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,250
除了我付租你收租的区别以外
Except I'm paying dues
while you collect them.

145
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,416
哈哈哈 米尔斯
Ha ha ha! Miles.

146
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,916
- 哈喽 大夫
- 你好吗？
- Hello, doc.
- How are you?

147
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,083
萨姆！
Sam!

148
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,083
又在贴条了哈？
At it again, eh?

149
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,416
我的护士告诉我你上周来过诊室...
My nurse tells me
you were in last week...

150
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,583
而且迫切要与我会面
and wanted very much
to see me.

151
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,583
没那么严重的啦
It wasn't anything important.

152
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,583
他跟我们一起上过学吗？
Didn't he go to college with us?

153
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,583
大二的时候为了结婚退学了...
Quit his second year
to get married...

154
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,083
就像我曾希望咱俩去做的那样
like I wanted us to do.

155
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,708
应该感到庆幸的是我没当真
Just be thankful
I didn't take you seriously.

156
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,250
不感到庆幸？
You be thankful.

157
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,708
我发现要成为一名医生的妻子...
I found out
that a doctor's wife...

158
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,416
需要有对爱因斯坦的理解和包容...
needs the understanding
of an Einstein...

159
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,041
还要有圣人的耐心
and patience of a saint.

160
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,541
那爱情呢？
And love?

161
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,541
我怎么知道
I wouldn't know about that.

162
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,541
我不过是个普通医师而已
I'm just a general practitioner.

163
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,041
爱情这玩意还是留给啥专家们去搞定吧
Love is handled
by the specialists.

164
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,041
好吧 我该走了
Here's where I leave you.

165
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,583
你知道吗？
You know something?

166
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:35,083
这该是你最后一次离开我身边
This is where you left me
the last time.

167
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,583
嗨 约翰尼
Hiya, Johnny.

168
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,458
莎莉 我该走了
Sally, I'm off.

169
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,583
告诉接线生我会在自己家里
Tell the answering service
I'll be at home.

170
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,083
晚安 大夫
Good night, doc.

171
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,166
我不要进去...
I'm not going in there!

172
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,833
别胡闹了！
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Stop all this nonsense.

173
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,083
嘿 嘿 放松点
Hey! Take it easy!

174
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,083
这不是小吉米 格里马尔迪吗？
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?

175
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,083
是的 大夫
我能跟你谈谈吗？
MRS. GRIMALDl: Yes, Doctor.
Can I talk to you a moment?

176
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,000
当然 知道吗
今早我差点开车撞到你
Sure. I almost
ran you down this morning.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,083
过马路的时候可要加倍小心哦
You got to be careful
when you run out in the road.

178
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,583
来
Come on.

179
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,083
过来
MRS. GRIMALDl: Come on.

180
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,541
嘿！嘿！嘿！
Hey! Hey! Hey!

181
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:16,041
嘿！别着急
Hey! Slow down now.

182
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,791
去上学也不是那么糟糕的呀
School isn't as bad as all that.

183
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,333
上学不是让他变成这样的原因
MRS. GRIMALDl:
School isn't what upsets him.

184
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,708
是我儿媳
It's my daughter-in-law.

185
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,208
他不知怎么产生的这个疯念头
觉得她不是他妈妈
He's got the crazy idea
she isn't his mother.

186
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,708
她不是！她就不是！
She isn't! She isn't!

187
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,333
别让她抓住我！
Don't let her get me!

188
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,458
没人会来抓你的 吉米
Nobody's going
to get you, Jimmy.

189
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,625
这个症状持续多久了？
How long has this been going on?

190
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,375
一个小时前 我在地窖发现他在那里藏着
MRS. GRIMALDl: An hour ago,
I found him in the cellar.

191
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,708
他一言不发 直到我开始给他妈妈打电话
He wouldn't say anything until
I started to phone his mother.

192
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,541
这时他告诉我安娜不是他妈妈
That's when he said Anna
wasn't his mother.

193
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,041
你能暂时让他在你那里呆一两天吗？
Could you keep him
with you for a day or so?

194
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,666
这个药给他每四小时吃一次
Give him one of these every
four hours during the day.

195
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,541
明天给我打个电话 告诉我他情况如何
Call me tomorrow and let me know
how he's feeling.

196
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,041
好的 大夫 谢谢你
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Yes, Doctor, thank you.

197
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,250
别让她抓住我！
Don't let her get me!

198
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,291
没人会来抓你的
Nobody's going to get you.

199
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,583
好吧 吉米
All right, Jimmy.

200
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,083
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

201
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,583
闭上眼睛
Shut your eyes.

202
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,708
以诗人之名...
In the words of the poet...

203
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,625
我给你吃令人充满智慧的神奇药丸
I'll give you something
to make you wise.

204
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,083
真是个好孩子 吉米
That's a good boy, Jimmy.

205
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,125
我绝不要回家
I'm not going home ever.

206
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,458
你会暂时留在奶奶家的
给他妈妈打个电话...
You're staying at your
grandmother's. Call his mother.

207
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,791
她不是我妈妈！
She's not my mother!

208
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,125
好吧好吧 你们先回去
一切都会没事的
All right. Run along.
Everything's going to be OK.

209
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,666
做个乖孩子哦
You be a good boy now.

210
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,083
晚安 大夫
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Good night, Doctor.

211
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,291
晚安
Good night.

212
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,625
我改变主意了
我先不直接回家去
I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.

213
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,083
顺路去看看威尔玛·伦茨的情况
I'm going to stop off
and see Wilma Lentz.

214
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,833
我需要给这孩子的母亲打个电话？
Should I call the boy's mother?

215
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,833
是的 告诉她发生了什么...
Yes.
Tell her what happened...

216
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,000
并且告诉她我建议最好先让孩子...
and that I suggested
the boy spend the night...

217
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,666
住在他奶奶家
at his grandmother's house.

218
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,125
你好 米尔斯
Hello, Miles.

219
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,583
见到你真好 威尔玛 贝基
Nice to see you, Wilma.
Becky.

220
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,041
直奔主题吧
Let's have it.

221
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,708
你刚才跟他聊过了 有什么感想？
You talked to him.
What do you think?

222
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,916
就是他 没错啊
It's him.

223
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,000
他就是你的艾拉叔叔，一切正常
He's your Uncle Ira, all right.

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,541
他才不是
He is not.

225
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,125
他有什么变化吗？
How is he different?

226
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,250
就是这样子
That's just it.

227
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,250
根本就没有肉眼能发现的区别
There is no difference
you can actually see.

228
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,625
他的外表 说话和行事风格 以及记忆...
He looks, sounds, acts,
and remembers...

229
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,833
都跟艾拉叔叔一样
like Uncle Ira.

230
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,416
那他就是你的艾拉叔叔啊
Then he is your Uncle Ira.

231
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,791
你不明白吗？
不管你有什么样的感觉 他就是
You see that?
No matter how you feel, he is.

232
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,291
但他不是
有哪里不对劲 好像缺失了什么
But he isn't.
There's something missing.

233
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,666
当我还小的时候 他对我视如己出
He's been a father to me
since I was a baby.

234
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,250
每当他跟我说话的时候...
Always when he talked to me...

235
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,875
他的眼神里有些很特别的东西
there was a special look
in his eye.

236
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,166
现在这样的眼神不见了
That look's gone.

237
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,958
那记忆方面如何？
肯定有某些特别的东西...
What about memories?
There must be certain things...

238
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,458
是只有你们两个人知道的
that only you and he
would know about.

239
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:43,583
有的
There are.

240
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,041
我跟他聊过这些
他全部都记得...
I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all...

241
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,291
哪怕是最微小的细节
就像艾拉叔叔会记得的一样
down to the last small detail,
just like Uncle Ira would.

242
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,625
但是 米尔斯...
But, Miles...

243
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,083
他没有情感
there's no emotion.

244
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,291
毫无！
None!

245
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,125
只有假装出来的情感
Just the pretense of it.

246
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,166
语言 姿势 声调...
The words, gesture,
the tone of voice...

247
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,125
任何的一切都跟原来没有区别
除了感情
everything else is the same,
but not the feeling.

248
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,416
不管他有没有记忆
他都不是我的艾拉叔叔
Memories or not,
he isn't my Uncle Ira.

249
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,500
威尔玛 我是站在你这边的
Wilma, I'm on your side.

250
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,250
我的事业是帮助需要帮助的人...
My business
is people in trouble...

251
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,666
我会找到可以帮你的方法
and I'm going to find
a way to help you.

252
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,458
没有人可能扮成你的艾拉叔叔...
No one could possibly
impersonate your Uncle Ira...

253
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,041
并还能让你和艾莱达伯母 甚至我...
without you
or your Aunt Eleda or even me...

254
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,041
都找不出千万个破绽的
seeing a million
little differences.

255
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,125
我希望你能认识到这一点
I want you to realize that.

256
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,250
好好想想
然后你就会明白...
Think about it,
and then you'll know...

257
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,541
是你自己的问题
that the trouble is inside you.

258
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,000
威尔玛 你在哪？
Wilma, where are you?

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,916
在草坪上
Out on the lawn.

260
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,833
什么也别跟她说
Say nothing to her.

261
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,750
哎呀 米尔斯
我都不知道你来了
Why, Miles,
I didn't know you were here.

262
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,958
欢迎回来
Welcome home.

263
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,166
你好 伦茨太太
Hello, Mrs. Lentz.

264
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,333
你们邀请米尔斯留下共进晚餐了吗？
Did you ask Miles
to stay for dinner?

265
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,541
今晚不行
Can't tonight.

266
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,833
我今天做了蛋奶糕
I'm making spoon bread.

267
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,333
拜托 可别诱惑我
Please, don't tempt me.

268
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,541
下次有机会吧
Maybe next time.

269
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,541
威尔玛 我的眼镜在哪儿？
Wilma, where are my glasses?

270
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,500
我想大概在壁炉台上
I think
they're on the mantelpiece.

271
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,833
我跟你一起去拿
I'll go with you.

272
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,041
我是发疯了吗？
Am I going crazy?

273
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,041
别可怜我 我必须知道
Don't spare me.
I've got to know.

274
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,041
不 你没有疯
即使是当今...
No, you're not.
Even these days...

275
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,708
发疯也不是一件如你想象中
那般容易的事情啊
it isn't as easy to go crazy
as you might think.

276
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,500
不过你不用过于迫切...
But you don't have to be
losing your mind...

277
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,916
去寻求精神科的治疗
to need psychiatric help.

278
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,458
我希望你能见见我的一个医生朋友
I'd like you to see
a doctor friend of mine.

279
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,291
- 心理医生吗？
- 丹·考夫曼
- A psychiatrist?
- Dan Kauffman.

280
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,208
明天我会帮你预约
I'll make an appointment
for you tomorrow.

281
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,750
好吧
All right.

282
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,250
可那纯属浪费时间
我什么毛病也没有
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.

283
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,625
先到此为止吧 不然他会起疑的
Better break this up,
or he'll start wondering.

284
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,750
起疑什么？
Wondering what?

285
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,291
不乱想的话 你的来访对我帮助很大...
If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help...

286
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,125
我不想你们任何人为我担心
and I don't want either of you
to worry about me.

287
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,375
我会好好的
I'll be all right.

288
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,916
你当然会啦
Sure you will.

289
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,041
你要留在这吗 贝基？
还是我送你回家？
Staying here, Becky?
Or may I drive you home?

290
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,583
想让我留下吗？
Would you like me to stay?

291
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,875
当然不了
晚安
Of course not.
Good night.

292
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,875
晚安
Good night.

293
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,583
贝基回来了真好啊？孩子
Nice having Becky
back again, eh, boy?

294
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,083
可说呢
Sure is.

295
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,291
我的脑海深处...
In the back of my mind...

296
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,041
响起了警钟
a warning bell was ringing.

297
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,791
那些迫不及待需要见我的病人们...
Sick people
who couldn't wait to see me...

298
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,750
一夜之间全部恢复正常：
then suddenly
were perfectly all right.

299
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,083
一个哭喊着他妈妈不再是他的妈妈的孩子
A boy claiming
his mother wasn't his mother.

300
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,125
一个宣称她的叔叔不再是她的叔叔的女人
A woman claiming her uncle
wasn't her uncle.

301
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,500
但当时我并没有听警钟的召唤
But I didn't listen.

302
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,458
很明显 孩子的妈妈还是他妈妈
Obviously, the boy's mother
was his mother.

303
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,583
我见过她了
而艾拉叔叔还是艾拉叔叔
I had seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.

304
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,708
当我与他交谈过以后 这简直毫无疑问
There was no doubt of that
after I talked to him.

305
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,000
米尔斯 他确实是艾拉叔叔？
Miles, he is Ira?

306
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,791
当然 你的意思是？
Of course he is.
What do you mean?

307
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,958
只是威尔玛实在是太坚定了
It's just Wilma's so positive.

308
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,500
她会好起来吗？
Will she be all right?

309
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,041
我想会的
I think so.

310
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,958
从学历上来看 我是一个医生...
I'm a doctor,
according to my diploma...

311
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,416
但我真的看不出威尔玛有什么毛病
but I don't really know
what Wilma's trouble is.

312
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,708
我可以讲一些精神科的术语来糊弄人...
I could start talking
psychiatrical jargon...

313
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,708
不过那就越界了
这是丹·考夫曼的领域
but it's out of my line
and in Dan Kauffman's.

314
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,000
真希望你不用回家吃晚饭
I wish you didn't have
to go home for dinner.

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
不用的 爸爸跟朋友出去吃饭了
I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.

316
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,541
7点我来接你
I could pick you up
at 7:00.

317
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,041
嗯...
Well...

318
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,625
现在是夏天 而且会是满月哦
It's summer,
and the moon is full.

319
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,833
“我知道一处浅滩...”
"I know a bank...

320
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,666
“铺满了狂野的百里香”
"where the wild thyme grows. "

321
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,375
你真是一点都没变
You haven't changed a bit.

322
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,291
哇！哇！注意点！
Whup! Whoa! Watch out!

323
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,541
抱歉
Sorry.

324
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,875
嘿 米尔斯
你什么时候回来的？
Hey, Miles,
when did you get back?

325
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,125
今早
丹尼 你好吗？
This morning.
How are you, Danny?

326
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,291
这位是德里斯科尔小姐
This is Miss Driscoll.

327
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,208
这是考夫曼先生--
我们的一位 也是唯一的一位精神科专家
Dr. Kauffman...
our one and only psychiatrist.

328
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,416
注意自己的言行
埃德，还记得贝基吗？
Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.

329
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,958
必须的
她出生时是我接生的
I should.
I brought her into the world.

330
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,458
你可给大家做了一件大好事
You did us all a favor.

331
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,208
这下我就不用专门给你打电话了
This saves me a phone call.

332
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,000
我这有一个小孩和一位女性 需要一名巫医
I've got a kid and a woman
who need a witch doctor.

333
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,708
孩子说爸爸不是爸爸了...
Boy says his father
isn't his father...

334
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,833
然后女人说姐妹不是姐妹了？
and the woman says her sister
isn't her sister?

335
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,458
还真差不多
That's pretty close.

336
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,458
我知道你一直在研究催眠术...
I knew you'd been
studying hypnosis...

337
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,250
不过你什么时候学会读心术啦？
but when did you start
reading minds?

338
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,750
他不需要使用读心术
He doesn't have to read them.

339
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,708
自从这种情况开始以来
我已经给他那里送去了一打多的病人了
I've sent him a dozen patients
since it started.

340
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,750
是什么？
怎么回事？
What is it?
What's going on?

341
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,250
我不知道
一种奇怪的神经性现象...
I don't know.
A strange neurosis...

342
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,083
显然极具蔓延性--
像是一场可传染的集体性癔病
evidently contagious...
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

343
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,916
两周之后
席卷了整个小镇
In two weeks,
it's spread all over town.

344
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,291
是什么引起的？
What causes it?

345
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,916
过于操心世界局势所导致的吧 或许
Worry about
what's going on in the world.

346
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,583
明天给威尔玛·伦茨安排一下吧好吗？
Make room
for Wilma Lentz tomorrow.

347
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,208
让她2点左右过来
晚安
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.

348
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,375
再会 丹尼
So long, Danny.

349
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:34,000
这真是我听到过最诡异的事
This is the oddest thing
I ever heard of.

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,916
但愿我们别染上这毛病
Let's hope we don't catch it.

351
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,916
我绝不愿某天早上醒来...
I'd hate to wake up
some morning...

352
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,583
发现身边的你不再是你
and find out you weren't you.

353
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,916
我可不再是那时候被你的浪漫
哄得晕头转向的高中女生了
I'm not the high-school
kid you used to romance.

354
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,166
你怎么分辨呢？
How could you tell?

355
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,333
真的想知道？
You really want to know?

356
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,500
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

357
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,125
唔~~~
你是贝基·德里斯科尔没错
Mmm.
You're Becky Driscoll.

358
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,541
嘿 圣米拉真是越来越蒸蒸日上了
Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.

359
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,041
从你回来后才开始的
Has ever since you got back.

360
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,041
你平时对病人也是这种态度吗 大夫？
（bedside manner 双关语）
Is this an example
of your bedside manner, Doctor?

361
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,541
不 女士 那件事可要等一会儿
（贝基意指病床边 米尔斯指床上）
No, ma'am.
That comes later.

362
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,916
晚上好 大夫
Good evening, Doctor.

363
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,875
人都到哪儿去了？
What happened
to the crowd tonight?

364
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,500
我不知道
这种情况已经持续好几周了
I don't know.
It's been this way for weeks.

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,750
好吧 至少我们不用等桌位了
At least we don't
have to wait for a table.

366
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,000
你挑吧 坐这里 还是那边
Take your pick.
Here or here.

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,833
这边吧 我想
怎么样？
Here, I think.
Shall we?

368
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,041
嗯
Mm-hmm.

369
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,458
乐队到哪里去了？
Where's the band?

370
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,458
生意不景气
所以我只好把他们打发走了
Business slumped,
so I had to let them go.

371
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,708
不过那边还有自动唱机
There's the jukebox, though.

372
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,500
跳支舞吧？
Shall we dance?

373
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,458
希望你还没有把酒保打发走
I hope you didn't
let the bartender go.

374
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,458
我就是酒保
喝马提尼？
I'm the bartender.
Martinis?

375
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,291
两杯 烈的
Two. Dry.

376
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,625
要很烈
Very dry.

377
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,666
米尔斯 我不在意考夫曼医生说了些什么
Miles, I don't care
what Dr. Kauffman says.

378
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:55,958
我只是很担心
I'm worried.

379
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,708
你现在可是在...
You are in the capable hands...

380
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,958
你最得力的私人医师手里
of your personal physician.

381
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,458
噢 大夫
Oh, Doctor.

382
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,958
啊 我们的夜生活...
Ah, there's our evening.

383
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,458
抱歉
Sorry.

384
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,958
谢谢
Thanks.

385
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,458
本耐尔大夫
Dr. Bennell.

386
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,083
杰克·拜里塞克想要你现在立刻赶到他家去
Jack Belicec wants you
to come to his house right away.

387
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,916
他说是紧急情况
He says it's urgent.

388
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,916
谢谢
Thank you.

389
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,416
还是把酒收起来吧
Better hold those drinks.

390
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,583
急诊
Emergency.

391
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,083
还好至少他们在我们开始
共进晚餐前打来了电话
At least they called
before we ordered dinner.

392
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,250
你饿不饿？
How hungry are you?

393
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,541
我可以等
I can wait.

394
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,916
可能会久一些
It may be a while.

395
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,416
我和你一起去
I'll go with you.

396
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,416
对不起 我们一会再回来
Sorry.
We'll be back later.

397
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,416
杰克在那里
There's Jack.

398
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,833
你好 杰克 怎么了？
泰迪生病了？
What's the matter?
Teddy sick?

399
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,583
没有
No.

400
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,833
谢天谢地 我以为你来不了了
Thank heaven.
I thought you'd never arrive.

401
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,250
那是谁病了？
Then who is sick?

402
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,458
没人生病
Nobody.

403
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,250
那你为什么要把我从餐桌前揪过来？
Then why'd you
drag me away from my dinner?

404
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,416
你不会相信的 米尔斯
直到你自己亲眼目睹
You won't believe it
until you see it.

405
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,708
你好 贝基
Hello, Becky.

406
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,333
- 你好 贝基
- 嗨 泰迪
- Hello, Becky.
- Hi, Teddy.

407
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,375
能否暂时先把你的医生身份抛在脑后？
Could you forget
you're a doctor a while?

408
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,625
为何？
Why?

409
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,750
我不想你马上去叫警察
I don't want you
calling the police.

410
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,208
别整得像个文艺青年
到底怎么了？
Quit acting like a writer.

411
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,750
没准你能告诉我发生了什么
你可是医生
Maybe you can tell me.
You're the doctor.

412
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,083
米尔斯 把台球桌上面的灯打开
Miles, put the light on
over the pool table.

413
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,333
继续 拉开它
Go on. Pull it down.

414
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,500
你有什么结论？
What do you make of it?

415
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,666
这是谁？
Who is he?

416
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,041
我毫无头绪
I have no idea.

417
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,541
它的脸 米尔斯
模糊不清
Its face, Miles.
It's vague.

418
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,166
第一印象
就好像硬币上印着的头像一样
Like the first impression
that's stamped on a coin.

419
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,375
它还未完成
It isn't finished.

420
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,541
没错
You're right.

421
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,541
只有大概的容貌
但是没有细节...
All the features
but no details...

422
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,291
没有特征 没有线条
no character, no lines.

423
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,208
它不是具人类尸体
It's no dead man.

424
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,208
你家有拓印台吗？
Have you got
an ink pad around the house?

425
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,291
桌子上有一个
干嘛用？
There's one in the desk.
Why?

426
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,458
我想提取一下这具躯体的指纹
I want to take
the corpse's fingerprints.

427
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,750
这肯定是具死尸 不然还能是什么？
Of course
it's a dead man.

428
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,500
我不知道 但是我有一种感觉...
I don't know,
but I've got a feeling that...

429
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,333
我知道这听起来很疯狂
但是如果我做一下尸体解剖的话...
I know this sounds crazy,
but if I should do an autopsy...

430
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,458
我想每个器官大概都是完美无损的...
I think I'd find every organ
in perfect condition...

431
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,708
完美无缺
就像这具躯体外表看起来那样...
as perfect
as the body is externally...

432
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,708
躯体状况良好
everything in working order.

433
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,791
准备就绪 把那个拿过来
All set to go. Hold that down.

434
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
没有指纹...
These are blank.

435
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,500
像是在等待脸部完成...
Waiting for the final
finished face...

436
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,125
...以后才会变出来
to be stamped onto it.

437
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,750
但 是谁的脸？
But whose face?

438
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,625
告诉我
Tell me that.

439
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,000
我想我们可以先喝一杯
We could all use a drink.

440
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,583
喝波本可以吗？
Bourbon all right?

441
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,750
好的
Fine.

442
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,333
我不喝 谢谢
Not for me, thanks.

443
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,625
米尔斯 告诉我 是谁的脸？
Miles, answer me.
Whose face?

444
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,500
我连一点点头绪都没有...
I haven't the slightest idea...

445
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,791
你有吗？
have you?

446
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,208
你...你觉得那玩意有多高？
How tall would you say
that thing is?

447
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,208
哦 大概5英尺10英寸（1米78）左右
Oh, 5'10", thereabouts.

448
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,208
有多重？
How much does it weigh?

449
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,750
比较瘦小
大概140磅
It's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.

450
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,000
杰克身高5英尺10英寸
体重140磅
Jack's 5'10"
and weighs 140 pounds.

451
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,750
泰迪 能不能别再一派胡言了！
Teddy, will you stop
talking nonsense?

452
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,750
亲爱的 抱歉
但是我没有乱讲
I'm sorry, darling,
but it isn't nonsense.

453
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,750
贝基 你不认为我在瞎说 是不是？
Becky, you don't think
it's nonsense, do you?

454
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,083
当然是瞎说啦
Of course it is.

455
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,750
杰克就在这里 站在你面前啊
Jack's standing here
in front of you.

456
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,166
我当然站在这了 而且正在血流成河
Of course I am,
bleeding to death.

457
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,333
劳驾
Excuse me.

458
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,500
知道吗？
You know what?

459
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,791
我很遗憾 你保住了性命
I'm afraid you may live.

460
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,291
好了 这样就没事了
Here, this should fix it.

461
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,250
米尔斯 我们要不要报警...
Miles,
shouldn't we call the police...

462
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,250
然后让他们把这具死尸搬走？
and have them take
that dead body out of here?

463
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,250
我很抱歉
这并不是一具尸体
I'm afraid
it isn't just a dead body.

464
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,750
多谢
Thanks.

465
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,208
我很好奇...
I wonder if...

466
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,708
什么？
What?

467
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,541
我好奇
这些事情之间是否有什么关联
I wonder
if there's any connection.

468
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,333
你指的是什么？
What do you mean?

469
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,708
有一些奇怪的事情正在
圣米拉缓缓拉开序幕
There's something
strange afoot in Santa Mira.

470
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:27,208
考夫曼医生管它叫
传染性的集体歇斯底里性癔病
Dr. Kauffman calls it
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

471
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,708
贝基的表妹就得了这个病
Becky's cousin's got it,
for one.

472
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,958
她认为她的叔叔和婶婶...
She thinks that her uncle
and her aunt...

473
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,708
不再是她的叔叔和婶婶
aren't her uncle and her aunt.

474
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,208
已经出现多例这样的幻想症了
There's several cases
of such delusion.

475
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,208
这个东西还没有完全化身为你的样子...
This isn't you yet...

476
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:42,208
但从结构上来说显然是及其相近了
but there is
a structural likeness.

477
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:44,958
真不可思议
It's fantastic.

478
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,041
这玩意出现在这里一定有什么原因
There must be some reason
this is here.

479
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,083
要不要坐下来...
Would you be willing
to sit up...

480
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,041
然后等着瞧你这位“朋友”
接下来会发生什么？
and see what your friend's
next move is?

481
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:54,500
如果到早上还没有什么动静
我们就报警
If nothing happens by morning,
call the police.

482
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
如果发生了些什么呢...
If something happens...

483
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,833
就给我打电话 好吗？
call me, will you?

484
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,500
你知道我会的
You know I will.

485
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,583
晚安 放松点
Good night.
Take it easy.

486
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:08,750
好的
Sure.

487
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,083
不会发生什么的
Nothing will happen.

488
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,333
晚安 贝基
Good night, Becky.

489
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,500
如果真的发生了什么...
If it does...

490
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,416
一定会是个令人毛骨悚然的
恐怖小说的好素材
it'll make a charming,
bloodcurdling mystery story.

491
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,916
我很谨慎地没有让贝基察觉出来...
I was careful
not to let Becky know...

492
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,208
但当时我真的被吓坏了
but I was really scared.

493
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,416
丹·考夫曼对于
镇上发生的怪事的解释...
Dan Kauffman's explanation
of what was wrong in town...

494
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,791
歇斯底里的集体性癔病...
mass hysteria...

495
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:34,791
解释不了为什么杰克的台球桌上
会有那样一具躯体
couldn't explain away that body
on Jack's billiard table.

496
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:50,916
进来吧
我先去开灯
Come in
while I turn the lights on.

497
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,208
你真是个奔放的少妇...
You're a forward wench...

498
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,250
为了强吻我 把我拉到这漆黑的走廊里来
dragging me into a dark hallway
to be kissed.

499
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,541
我把你拉到漆黑的走廊里...
I'm dragging you
into a dark hallway...

500
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,791
是因为今晚我怕黑
because I'm scared of the dark
tonight.

501
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,958
我最好留下来把你裹在怀里
I'd better stay
and tuck you in.

502
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,500
那样就太疯狂了
That way lies madness.

503
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,375
疯狂又怎么啦？
What's wrong with madness?

504
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,208
就是太疯了
晚安
Madness.
Now good night.

505
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:19,208
想来你俩也该到家了
It's about time
you two got home.

506
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:22,125
爸 这么晚你在地下室干什么？
Dad, what are you doing
in the basement this late?

507
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,541
整理杂物
Working in my shop.

508
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,791
想来点酒吗 大夫？
Want a nightcap, doc?

509
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,125
不 谢了
时间不早了
No, thanks.
It's kind of late.

510
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,208
改天奉陪
晚安
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.

511
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,208
晚安
Good night.

512
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,208
晚安 米尔斯
Good night, Miles.

513
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:07,083
啊！
Aaah!

514
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,750
看呐 杰克！
Look, Jack!

515
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,750
它变成你了！是你！
It's you! It's you!

516
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,666
不 不！
千万不要靠近它！
No, no!
You mustn't go near it!

517
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:14,666
快离开这里！拜托！
Get out of here! Please!

518
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,166
求你！
Please!

519
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:18,666
米尔斯！
Miles!

520
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,666
发生什么了 杰克？
What happened, Jack?

521
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,166
泰迪说屋里的那个生物变成了我...
Teddy says the thing
in our place is me...

522
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,083
连受伤的割伤都出现了
right down
to the cut on my hand.

523
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,500
我赶紧跑去看它
I didn't wait to look.

524
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,666
它活过来了！是活的！
It's alive! It's alive!

525
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:33,166
那受伤的伤口在流血！
The hand was cut and bleeding!

526
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:36,208
位置也挪动了！
And the position
of the body had changed!

527
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,958
来 这里 吃了这个
Here, here. Take this.

528
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:44,375
我这就给丹尼·考夫曼打电话
I'll call Danny Kauffman.

529
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,166
你好！
Hello?

530
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,375
你好 丹尼？
Hello, Danny?

531
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,541
是的！
Yeah?

532
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,833
有情况发生了
我必须立刻见你
Something's happened.
I've got to see you.

533
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,916
你能迅速赶过来吗？
Will you get over here fast?

534
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,958
非常重要的事情
It's important.

535
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:16,458
哦...好的
Oh... OK.

536
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:20,375
他在路上了
He's on his way.

537
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,208
我去弄点咖啡就过来
I'll make some coffee
and be right with you.

538
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,625
好主意 米尔斯
谢了
Good deal, Miles.
Thanks.

539
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,458
对了 贝基怎么样？
她没事吧？
What about Becky?
Do you think she's all right?

540
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,916
爸 这么晚你在地下室做什么？
Dad, what are you
doing in the basement this late?

541
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,291
整理杂物
Working in my shop.

542
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,625
我不知道当时是什么情况...
I don't know what it was...

543
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,916
大概是种预感...
call it a premonition...

544
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:51,916
忽然间 我感受到了贝基身边的危险气息
but suddenly, I had the feeling
that Becky was in danger.

545
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,916
我尽我所能地迅速向她家赶去
I had to get to her
as quickly as possible.

546
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,083
正要按门铃的时候...
I was going
to ring the bell...

547
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:18,333
突然我的预感告诉我 行事要万分谨慎
but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.

548
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,250
这屋子里有问题
Something was wrong
in this house.

549
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,791
贝基
Becky.

550
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,291
贝基！
Becky!

551
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,333
米尔斯 能告诉我到底发生了什么吗？
Miles, will you tell me
what happened?

552
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:51,625
同样的东西
The same thing.

553
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,083
我又找到了一具...
I found another one...

554
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,791
在贝基家的地下室里...
in the cellar
at Becky's house...

555
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:57,333
我站在那里盯着它的时候 它正在活转起来
coming to life
while I stood there watching it.

556
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,833
那是贝基
It was Becky.

557
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,625
是吗？我想看看这两具躯体中的任意一个
Yeah? I want to see
one of these bodies.

558
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:03,125
好的
All right.

559
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:06,000
你先上床去休息
你陪着她
You're going to bed,
and you're staying with her.

560
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,291
穿上外衣
我们先去看看杰克的那个
Put on your clothes.
We'll go to Jack's first.

561
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,791
你这有咖啡吗？
Got any coffee around here?

562
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:12,375
有
厨房里能找到
Yeah.
You'll find some in the kitchen.

563
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,291
他不相信我的话 贝克
He doesn't believe me, Beck.

564
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:16,458
他会相信的
He will.

565
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:30,375
有人在耍花招
Somebody's playing games!

566
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,500
这下麻烦了
Rough ones.

567
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,125
这里有一处血迹
There's a blood spot.

568
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,666
你们看到的东西是个被杀掉的可怜的尸体
What you saw was the body
of a murdered man.

569
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,291
仔细检查过了吗？
Did you examine it carefully?

570
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,458
是的
Yes.

571
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,541
我实在不知道它到底发生了什么
I don't know
what's happened to it.

572
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:44,916
那并不是一具普通的尸体
上面没有任何特征
It wasn't an ordinary body.
There wasn't a mark on it.

573
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,041
我也仔细检查过了
连任何蛛丝马迹都没有
I checked it, too.
Not a scratch.

574
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,291
有这样一种杀人手法...
You can kill a man...

575
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,333
用削尖的细冰椎刺入大脑的话...
by shoving an ice pick
into the base of his brain...

576
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,875
只会留下一个肉眼几乎看不见的微小创口
leaving a puncture so small
the naked eye can't see.

577
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,500
妈的 你在无视事实真相
这压根就不是一具普通的尸体
You're ignoring the fact
this wasn't a normal body.

578
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,208
而且你也听到泰迪提到它手上的伤口
What about the hand
Teddy mentioned?

579
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,583
泰迪的胡言乱语我听过太多了
全部都是扯淡
I heard lots of things
Teddy said and none made sense.

580
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,791
等等 伙计
当时我也在场
Hold on, pal.
I was here, too.

581
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:04,583
米尔斯也在
So was Miles.

582
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,833
瞧 我们提取了它的指纹
Look, we took his fingerprints.

583
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,750
看看这个吧
告诉我为什么它没有指纹
Look at that.
Tell me why it didn't have any.

584
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,375
他不喜欢留下指纹
所以用强酸洗掉了
He didn't want any,
so he took them off with acid.

585
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,125
别试图用常识去解释一切了
Stop trying
to rationalize everything.

586
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,958
我们手边的这事是个谜
We have a mystery on our hands.

587
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,416
是啊 的确是个谜
Sure. A real one.

588
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:19,916
到底是谁的尸体
并且它现在在哪里
Whose body was it,
and where is it now?

589
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,583
只不过完全是个普普通通的谜题而已
A completely normal mystery.

590
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,416
别管它现在在哪里
这件事绝不会超越人类的经验范围
Whatever it is, it's well within
the bounds of human experience.

591
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,083
而且我也不认为你们能让它超越
Don't blow things
out of proportion.

592
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,458
如果不是因为我在贝基家的地下室看到的东西
我才不会像现在这样
I wouldn't if I hadn't
looked in Becky's cellar.

593
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:30,291
我在那看到的躯体 你又怎么解释？
How do you explain the body
I saw there?

594
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:31,916
我不认为你看到了任何东西
I don't think you saw one.

595
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:33,250
你也不相信我在这看到的？
And the body here?

596
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,625
我知道你在这看到了
其他的三个人也都看到了
I know you saw it.
Three others saw it, too.

597
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,375
但另外一个是我梦见的还是什么？
But I dreamed up
the second one?

598
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:39,458
医生也是会产生幻觉的
Doctors can have
hallucinations, too.

599
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:41,541
人类的精神是种奇妙的存在
The mind is a strange
and wonderful thing.

600
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,916
甚至也许永远都不能够被完全彻底地解读
I'm not sure it'll ever be able
to figure itself out.

601
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:46,458
其它的事物或许都可以--
从原子 到宇宙--
Everything else, maybe...
from the atom to the universe...

602
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,875
任何事物 除了人类的精神世界
everything except itself.

603
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,375
不管怎么说
我看到了贝基的分身...
Nevertheless,
I saw Becky's double...

604
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,791
而我们在这里见到的那具躯体...
and the body that we saw here...

605
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,958
化成了令人不舒服的 酷似杰克的东西
bore an uncomfortable
resemblance to Jack.

606
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,625
极度令人不舒服
Mighty uncomfortable.

607
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,000
好吧 让我们去贝基家瞧瞧
Let's go to Becky's
and have a look.

608
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,291
好吧 你女朋友的分身在哪里？
Where's your
girlfriend's double?

609
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,458
好 怀疑论者
打开这个盖子
OK, skeptic,
lift the lid.

610
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:19,583
有具躯体在里面吧
对吗？
There's a body here,
all right.

611
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,291
- 那就是贝基的分身
- 当然是
- It's Becky's double.
- It sure is.

612
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,625
你再来看看
Take another look.

613
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:29,041
现在你看
你根本就没在这里看见过什么
Now you see it,
now you don't.

614
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:32,000
它之前就在那里的--
被那个毯子裹着
It was there...
half-hidden by that blanket.

615
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,166
你说你是刚刚才在这里看见过的
You said
you saw it there just now.

616
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:36,333
我以为我看到了
I thought I did.

617
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,250
今晚你为何跑到贝基家里来？
Why did you come here
tonight?

618
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,958
你在杰克家看到了一个死人...
You'd seen a dead man
at Jack's...

619
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,291
身材普通的人
an average-sized man.

620
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,458
死去的脸上
线条柔和没有棱角...
The face in death
was smooth and unlined...

621
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,000
表情空洞
这是常有的事
bland in expression,
which often happens.

622
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,458
你只是刚刚才开始注意到...
You had just become aware...

623
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:50,291
这一场奇怪的 无法用常识解释的
歇斯底里的流行性集体癔病
of a curious, unexplainable,
epidemic mass hysteria.

624
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:53,458
男人 女人 孩子们
突然都开始坚信...
Men, women, and children
suddenly convinced themselves...

625
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,375
身边的亲人不再是原本的亲人...
that their relatives weren't
their relatives at all...

626
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,625
所以你的意识开始欺骗你...
so your mind
started playing tricks...

627
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:59,750
现实变得不再真实
and reality became unreality.

628
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,708
在你眼里那个死人变成了杰克的分身
The dead man became
Jack's double in your eyes.

629
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:03,875
得了吧 好吗 丹
Come off it, Dan.

630
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:06,041
我知道这些听起来难以置信...
I know
it's all hard to believe...

631
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:08,833
但的的确确是可能发生的事情--
哪怕是我这样的巫医也不一定能躲得过
but these things happen...
even to witch doctors like me.

632
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:11,583
我在这看见她了！
千真万确！
I saw her here!
She was real!

633
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:13,625
你当然看到了 从每一个细节...
You saw her
in every tiny detail...

634
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,000
就像任何一个人看到
任何其它事物一样的鲜活生动...
as vividly as anyone
has ever seen anything...

635
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,375
但那仅存在于你的脑海中
but only in your mind.

636
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:21,250
丹尼你可以一整晚都在这里阐述理论
但你说服不了我
Danny, talk all night,
but you're not convincing me.

637
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,916
天啊你们在我家地下室干什么？
What are you doing in my cellar?

638
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,916
用来做诊室
这两位先生是病人...
Using it for an office.
These gentlemen are patients...

639
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:31,250
急需要精神科的治疗
badly in need
of psychiatric treatment.

640
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,208
他们一直在做噩梦
They've been having nightmares.

641
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,500
要是喝多了
你们最好现在醒醒酒
If you're drunk,
you'd better sober up quick.

642
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,791
警察正在来这里的路上
The police are coming.

643
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,125
不不 我们没醉
No, we're not drunk.

644
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,250
不是那么简单的事
拿把椅子过来
Nothing that simple.
Pull up a chair.

645
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,791
怎么了 你们都有毛病吧？
Why, you're all crazy.

646
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,250
嘿 这里发生了什么？
What's going on down there?

647
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,250
你好 尼克
很高兴见到你
Hello, Nick.
Glad to see you.

648
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,291
这两位先生不用专门再跑一趟去警局了
You saved these two characters
a trip to the station.

649
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:54,041
他们想报警 发现了一具尸体
后来它却不见了
They want to report
finding a body and losing it.

650
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,791
在哪儿？什么时候？
Where? When?

651
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,833
大概晚上7点左右在我家
At my place about 7:00.

652
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,416
为什么你们时隔这样久才报警？
Why did you
wait so long to report it?

653
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:01,875
你知道些什么吧 大夫？
You know better than that, doc.

654
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:05,458
呃 那时一具很诡异的躯体...
It was a curious sort
of a body...

655
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:08,833
然后 只是突然就找不到它了
and then it wasn't there
anymore.

656
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,250
我有个好主意 你们俩都该进局子了
I have a good mind
to throw you both in jail.

657
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,583
如果你看见那玩意
你就会明白为什么我们等了这么长时间
If you'd seen it,
you'd understand why we waited.

658
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:17,750
瘦小的男人...身高5英尺10英寸...
Thin man... 5'10"...

659
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,666
指纹被强酸抹掉了？
fingerprints burned off
with acid?

660
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:23,041
刚刚还在太平间看到它
Just seen it on the slab
in the morgue.

661
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,291
出现在一个燃烧的草垛旁边...
Turned up
in a burning haystack...

662
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:27,750
就两个多小时前 在迈克·加斯纳南边的牧场
on Mike Gessner's south pasture
two hours ago.

663
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,166
好了 散了吧！
Now break it up!

664
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,791
各回各家！
Go on home!

665
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:42,416
好吧 你赢了
收拾走人吧
You win.
Pick up the marbles.

666
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,458
早安
Good morning.

667
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,291
有橙汁
Orange juice.

668
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,166
谢谢
Thank you.

669
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,958
想要吃哪种蛋？
How do you
like your eggs?

670
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,625
你想怎么做就怎么做
Any way you'd like.

671
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:02,875
煮蛋 两分钟？
Boiled, two minutes?

672
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:04,041
两分钟？
Two minutes?

673
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,541
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

674
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:06,833
好
OK.

675
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,416
知道吗...
You know...

676
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:12,458
昨晚把你从床上抱走挺麻烦的...
dragging you out of bed
last night was some trouble...

677
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,833
但是很值得
but it was worth it.

678
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:14,958
说真的 米尔斯
Seriously, Miles.

679
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,916
什么声音？
What was that?

680
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,416
是谁？
Who is it?

681
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,125
煤气收费员
It's the gas man.

682
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,333
早上好啊大夫
Morning, doc.

683
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,708
早上好 查理
Good morning, Charlie.

684
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,958
我猜我大概有点神经过敏
I guess I'm a little jittery.

685
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,916
睡眠不足的缘故
Not getting enough sleep.

686
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,625
我不会烦扰你的
I won't bother you anymore.

687
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,875
把计费表放在露台了
Putting a meter outside
on the patio.

688
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,083
好的
OK.

689
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:41,458
天啊 鸡蛋要煮过头了
The eggs will be hard-boiled.

690
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,000
你也会为你丈夫这样做吗？
Did you do this
for your husband?

691
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,166
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

692
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,875
难道你妻子不会做这些么？
Didn't your wife
do this for you?

693
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,708
当然 她热爱烹饪
Yes. She liked to cook.

694
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,875
这就是我现在为何成了
单身汉的其中一个原因--
That's one of the reasons
why I'm single...

695
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,916
晚餐上桌时
我几乎从未露过脸
I never was there
when dinner was on the table.

696
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:55,375
所以听我的建议...
Take my advice...

697
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:57,083
最好别跟医生搞在一起
and don't get mixed up
with a doctor.

698
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,458
他们几乎从不在家
They're seldom at home.

699
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,458
如果我告诉你...
What would you say
if I told you...

700
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,958
我已经跟一名医生搞上了会怎样？
I was already
mixed up with a doctor?

701
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,375
我会说简直美好得令人难以置信
I'd say it was too good
to be true.

702
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,916
这种事情
时常会突如其来地发生
Things like this
can happen all of a sudden.

703
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,333
什么叫“突如其来”？
对于两个...
What's "all of a sudden"
about two people...

704
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,333
几乎已经做了一辈子密友的人
who've been friends
most of their lives?

705
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,500
早安
Good morning.

706
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,791
我想我闻到了咖啡的香味
I thought
I smelled some coffee.

707
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:17,958
为什么没喊我起床呢？
Why didn't you give me a call?

708
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,250
我不想把泰迪吵醒
I didn't want to wake Teddy.

709
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,000
哦 她早醒了 昨晚睡得很好
She's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.

710
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,750
不错
Good.

711
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,666
不过我不认为她应该马上跟我回家
But I don't feel
she should go home right away.

712
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,916
介意我们多留一会吗？
Would you mind taking in
boarders for a while?

713
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:33,250
还是说你有其他别的什么安排？
Or do you have something else
in mind?

714
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,916
我在琢磨一些事情...
I was toying with an idea...

715
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,375
不过你们当然可以留下
but you can stay.

716
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,125
给 杰克
Here, Jack.

717
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,250
谢了 宝贝
我给泰迪送上去
Thank you, doll.
I'll take it to Teddy.

718
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,416
米尔斯 你是否帮我安排了预约...
Miles, did you make
that appointment for me...

719
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:54,583
跟你的那个精神科医生见面
with the psychiatrist?

720
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,083
是的 2点
Yes. 2:00.

721
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,250
我想不需要了
我觉得自己好蠢
I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.

722
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,791
我今早一睁眼
觉得什么事都没有了
I woke up this morning,
and everything was all right.

723
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:04,125
- 你都不知道我感到有多轻松
- 是的 我明白
- You don't know my relief.
- Yes, I do.

724
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,791
回去给贝基打个电话告诉她这件事好吗？
她一直好担心你
Will you call Becky
and tell her? She was worried.

725
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:07,958
好的
All right.

726
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,458
她现在在我家
She's at your house.

727
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:11,000
在你家？为什么？
At your house? Why?

728
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,625
一言难尽
不过她会跟你解释的
It's a long story,
but she'll tell you about it.

729
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:31,083
贝基还在他家
Becky's still at his house.

730
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,375
好吧
All right.

731
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:39,916
早安啊
Good morning.

732
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,875
早上好 莎莉
Good morning, Sally.

733
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:44,333
快去瞧瞧谁在会客室
Take a peek at what's
in the reception room.

734
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:50,791
妈妈 为什么我们不回家呢？
Mother,
why don't we go home?

735
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,541
马上就回去 吉米
In a little while,
Jimmy.

736
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:58,750
他康复得很迅速嘛
He certainly made
a quick recovery.

737
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,375
我想我们都是这样的
I guess we all have.

738
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,625
但开车回家的路上...
But driving home...

739
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,958
我的脑海中浮现出很多无解的疑问
I had a lot of questions
and no answers.

740
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,916
吉米和威尔玛怎么会在一夜之间恢复常态？
How could Jimmy and Wilma
seem so normal now?

741
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,833
很明显我还没有为他们做任何治疗
Surely I had done nothing
to cure them.

742
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:16,791
也许他们是想让我安下心来
可是为什么呢？
Maybe they wanted me
to feel secure, but why?

743
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,291
好啊...
Well...

744
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,291
但愿你没忘了买牛排
I hope
you didn't forget the steaks.

745
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,791
我从不忘事
I never forget anything.

746
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:25,791
别担心他
在这方面他口碑良好
Don't worry about him.
He's completely housebroken.

747
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,458
我想来点马提尼  贝克
I need a martini, Beck.

748
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,708
洋葱还是橄榄口味？
Onion or olive?

749
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,000
无所谓
我只是想浇在炭上
Doesn't matter.
I want to pour it on the coals.

750
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,166
这玩意老是点不着
They just won't burn.

751
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,125
哦 马提尼可不够烈
A martini isn't dry enough.

752
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,333
我去帮你找些可以点火用的东西
I'll get you something
that'll start it.

753
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,000
这杯是给你喝的
For drinking purposes.

754
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,125
你的身材看起来真是凹凸有致
You're looking shipshape.

755
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,666
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

756
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,916
拿来了
Here we are.

757
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,583
杰克！杰克！
Jack! Jack!

758
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,250
呕...
Ugh.

759
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:30,458
看起来像巨型豆荚！
They're like huge seedpods!

760
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,083
这一定就是形成我家密室里那躯体的玩意！
This must be how that
body in my closet was formed.

761
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,375
米尔斯 它们是哪来的？
Where are they from?

762
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,708
我也不知道
如果是种子或者豆荚那样的东西...
I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods...

763
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,583
它们大概一定是从什么地方的
植物上长出来的
they must grow someplace
on a plant.

764
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,375
并且某些人或者东西
要它们去复制人类的躯体...
And somebody or something wants
this duplication to take place.

765
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:46,083
但一旦它们完成复制的时候...
But when they're finished...

766
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,250
我们的躯体会发生什么？
what happens to our bodies?

767
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,458
我毫无头绪
I don't know.

768
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,625
当整个步骤完成的时候...
我们的本体可能...
When the process is complete,
probably the original...

769
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,125
会被毁灭或瓦解...
is destroyed or disintegrates...

770
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,250
不！等等！
No! Wait!

771
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,750
抱歉
但我可不想亲眼目睹...
Sorry,
but I take a dim view...

772
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,375
自己被毁灭的惨剧发生
of watching my own destruction
take place.

773
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,708
在它们完全生长成型之前
暂时不会有什么危险的
There isn't any danger
until they're completely formed.

774
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,500
昨晚在你家咱们已经见识过了
We learned that last night
at your house.

775
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
你并不会马上被统御
Your blank
didn't change right away.

776
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,541
在你沉睡之前都不会
Not until you fell asleep.

777
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,291
米尔斯 如果这种取而代之真的发生了...
Miles, when the change
does take place...

778
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:11,333
你认为会与本来的我们有什么区别吗？
do you suppose
there's any difference?

779
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:12,625
一定有
There must be.

780
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,416
威尔玛注意到了
小吉米也发现了
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.

781
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:17,791
还有我
So did I.

782
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:20,125
是我父亲...
My father.

783
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,750
这一定是昨晚那时他在...
That must be
what he was doing...

784
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,541
地下室所做的事情
安置这种东西
in the cellar last night...
placing one of these.

785
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:26,708
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

786
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:28,791
我感到有些不对劲...
但我还以为是我自己的问题...
I felt something wrong,
but I thought it was me...

787
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,458
因为我离开家乡太久了
because I'd been away
for so long.

788
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:32,750
一定要毁掉它们
所有的！
They must be destroyed,
all of them!

789
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,333
它们会变成--
每一个...
They will be...
every one of them.

790
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,583
我们现在必须去检查一下镇上所有的建筑...
We're going to have to search every
building 

791
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:37,833
所有的房子
every house in town.

792
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,541
不管男女老少都得接受检查
Men, women, and children
have to be examined.

793
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:42,083
我们要开始求援了
我留在这看住它们
We've got some phoning to do. I'm going to stay
 and watch them.

794
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,250
我陪你一起
I'm staying with you.

795
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,458
千万别报警！
Don't call the police!

796
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:45,708
尼克·格里维特压根就没有从...
Nick Grivett
didn't find any body...

797
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,291
什么燃烧的干草垛旁边发现任何尸体！
on a burning haystack!

798
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,833
为什么不打电话通知丹尼？没准他能帮上忙
Why don't you call
Danny? Maybe he can help.

799
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,333
丹尼？
Danny?

800
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,500
不
No.

801
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,291
恐怕现在再联系丹尼 也已经太迟了
I'm afraid it's too late
to call Danny, too.

802
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:00,750
那你打算怎么办？
What are you going to do?

803
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:01,916
求救
Get help.

804
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:04,958
但愿现在所发生的一切都还
仅限于在圣米拉的范围内！
I hope whatever's taking place
is confined to Santa Mira!

805
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:13,958
这里是接线员
Operator.

806
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,125
你好 我是本耐尔医生
这是紧急情况
This is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency.

807
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:19,291
我想跟洛杉矶的联邦调查局联系
I want to talk to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in L.A.

808
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,708
你确定能让他们相信你的话吗？
Can you convince them?

809
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,041
我别无选择
I've got to.

810
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,666
这些东西到底是从哪儿来的？
Where did they come from?

811
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:26,458
过去的几年间发现了很多
So much has been
discovered these past few years.

812
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:27,625
一切皆有可能
Anything is possible.

813
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,458
也许是核辐射...
Maybe the results
of atomic radiation...

814
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:31,750
对植物或动物产生的影响...
on plant life or animal life...

815
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,291
或者是什么诡异的外星生物
或基因突变一类的
some weird alien organism,
a mutation of some kind.

816
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:38,000
它们为什么要取代人类
也就是我们而存在？
Why should they take the form
of people... of us?

817
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,125
我不知道
I don't know.

818
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,333
无论是什么...
Whatever it is...

819
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,125
不管是出于智能还是生存本能...
whatever intelligence
or instinct it is...

820
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:46,791
那玩意能支配它们所形成的人类的血肉之躯...
that can govern the forming
of human flesh and blood...

821
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,666
只需要微薄的空气就可以...
out of thin air is...

822
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,166
简直是令人难以置信地强大...
well,
it's fantastically powerful...

823
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,333
直接超越了人类的理解范围
不堪设想
beyond any comprehension,
malignant.

824
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,583
你家地下室里的那具躯体仅仅只需要...
All that body
in your cellar needed...

825
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:55,958
拥有一个意识 而且它...
was a mind, and it was...

826
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:58,416
而且当时我睡着后
它正在尝试偷取我的意识
And it was taking mine
while I was asleep.

827
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:00,541
我真希望能亲手拿干草叉把它--
I could take
that pitchfork myself, and...

828
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:02,875
与洛杉矶的联线接通了 大夫...
On your call
to Los Angeles, Doctor...

829
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:04,416
没有人接电话
they don't answer.

830
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:07,000
再试试 它们的部门全天无休！
Try again! That office
is open day and night!

831
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,791
如果它们已经占领了电话系统
那我们就完蛋了
If they've taken over
the phone office, we're dead.

832
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,916
那是我码？
Is that me?

833
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:59,416
这是紧急情况！
紧急情况！
This is an emergency!
Emergency!

834
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:01,458
听着 这里...喂？
Look, there's been... Hello?

835
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,250
接线员 给我换个好点的线路
Operator,
get me a better connection.

836
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,666
我试试 大夫
I'll try, Doctor.

837
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,375
没用
It's no use.

838
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,375
洛杉矶那边的线路全都断了
All the Los Angeles circuits
are dead.

839
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,291
好吧 试试萨克拉门托那边！
给我接州政府
OK, try Sacramento!
Give me the state capital.

840
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,291
我要跟地方上的官员联系
I want to talk to the governor.

841
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:20,875
萨克拉门托线路忙 大夫
The Sacramento
circuits are busy, Doctor.

842
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,458
会再回你电话
I'll call you back.

843
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,125
好吧
All right.

844
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:27,625
好吧 我等你电话
All right.
I'll wait for your call.

845
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,500
我要把电话拿出去
I'll take the phone outside.

846
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,916
杰克 它们已经占领了电话系统
Jack, they've got the phone.

847
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:41,875
你和姑娘们开上你的车 先跑路
You and the girls take your car
and make a run for it.

848
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,791
到了附近的第一个镇 赶快求助
First town you get to,
yell for help.

849
00:45:43,791 --> 00:45:45,000
那你呢？
What about you?

850
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,375
电话很快就会响
That phone
is gonna ring soon.

851
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:48,833
如果没有人接的话
他们可能会封锁出镇的道路
If nobody answers,
they'll block the roads.

852
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,000
我尽力拖住他们 直到你们走远以后
I'll stall them.

853
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,291
然后呢
Then what?

854
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,666
试试能否挖出幕后黑手
Try and find out
what's in back of this.

855
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,333
- 我留下
- 不！
- I'm staying.
- No!

856
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,166
米尔斯 别让我离开你
Miles,
don't ask me to leave you.

857
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,125
杰克 快上路吧
Jack, get going.

858
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,666
米尔斯 我不能--
Miles, I can't...

859
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:02,208
总有人要先走
否则的话我们没办法搬救兵！
Somebody's got to go,
or we don't get help!

860
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,875
拜托 我们快离开这里吧
Please,
let's get out of here!

861
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,583
你们自己保重
Watch out for yourselves.

862
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,875
到电话那里去 在那呆着
Go over by the phone.
Stay there.

863
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:11,208
如果电话响了 喊我
If it rings, call me.

864
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,916
你好
Hello.

865
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:53,375
本耐尔大夫在吗？
Is Dr. Bennell there?

866
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,583
- 在 我去叫他
- 不要紧
- Yes. I'll get him.
- Never mind.

867
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,875
请转告他萨克拉门托那边
仍然线路忙就可以了...
Just tell him the Sacramento
circuits are still busy...

868
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,583
再问问他是否需要我继续尝试帮他转接
and ask him if he wants me
to keep trying.

869
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,916
好的 稍等
All right. Hold on.

870
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,041
米尔斯 那边还是线路忙！
Miles,
the circuits are still busy!

871
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:04,416
让她继续试！
Tell her to keep trying!

872
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:06,583
还有 再试试三藩市和华盛顿！
Also, try San Francisco
and Washington!

873
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,375
我们现在立即走人
We're getting
out of here right now.

874
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:15,583
去哪里？
Where are we going?

875
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,750
莎莉家
Sally's!

876
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:21,250
洛杉矶方面还是接不通
We're still unable
to get through to Los Angeles.

877
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,625
需要我继续尝试吗？
Do you wish me to keep trying?

878
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,916
本耐尔大夫？
Dr. Bennell?

879
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,791
本耐尔大夫？
Dr. Bennell?

880
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,625
我需要个可以信任的人...
I needed
someone I could trust...

881
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:32,750
然后我发现莎莉
我的护士 是最好的人选
and I figured Sally, my nurse,
was my best bet.

882
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,916
我决定试试给她打电话看看她是否在家
I decided to try to phone her
to see if she was at home.

883
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:37,916
也许公用付费电话线路还没有被占领
Maybe they hadn't
taken over the pay phones.

884
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:40,166
我试试付费电话
I'll try the pay phone.

885
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,166
嗨 麦克！
Hey, Mac!

886
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,958
哦 嗨 大夫 你好吗？
Oh, hi, doc.
How are you?

887
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:46,625
听着 可以赶快帮我加个几加仑吗？
我赶时间
Will you get me
a couple gallons fast?

888
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,791
当然
玛莎 大夫在赶时间
Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry!

889
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:50,125
你负责刷挡风玻璃 好吗？
Get the windshield, will you?

890
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:56,333
我得把钥匙拔下来去开油箱
I have to have the keys
to open the gas tank.

891
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,083
这条路那边有病人？
Somebody sick out this way?

892
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:02,916
那边出了事故
There's been an accident.

893
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:05,041
有意思 我们还没听到这个消息
Funny.
We haven't heard about it.

894
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:06,708
呃 刚刚才发生的事情
It just happened.

895
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,166
我还没来得及拨她的号码...
Before I could
even get her number...

896
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,250
就看见麦克靠近了我的车的后备箱
I saw Mac closing
the trunk of my car.

897
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,541
他或许是在帮我检查备胎情况...
He could have been
checking my spare tire...

898
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,166
但我不这么想
but I didn't think so.

899
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,333
这样就好了
That should do it.

900
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:16,541
谢谢你
Thank you.

901
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,750
都搞定了？
All set?

902
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,291
- 都搞定了 大夫
- 好的 多谢
- All set, doc.
- Fine. Thanks.

903
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:21,791
- 记我账上 好吗？
- 当然了 大夫
- Put it on my bill, will you?
- Sure, doc.

904
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,291
怎么了？
What's the matter?

905
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,666
我们得现在赶去莎莉家
We've got to make it
to Sally's house.

906
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,333
我不确定是否再有任何人可以信任了...
I wasn't sure
I could trust anyone...

907
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,833
但无论怎样 我想去莎莉那里碰碰运气
but I took a chance
and drove to Sally's anyway.

908
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:35,750
当我看到屋子前面停了很多车时...
When I saw several cars
in front of the house...

909
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,291
我决定谨慎点
I decided to play it safe.

910
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,500
有什么不对吗？
What's wrong?

911
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:47,750
也许没有 但还是先不要进去...
直到我确定那边安全为止
Probably nothing,but we're not going 
in there until I'm sure it's safe.

912
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,916
握紧方向盘
随时准备立刻开车...
Slide under the wheel
and get out of here fast...

913
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:52,250
如果有任何人出现来抓我们的话
if anybody shows up
looking for us.

914
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,083
宝宝睡着了吗 莎莉？
The baby asleep yet, Sally?

915
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:23,041
还没呢
不过就快了...
Not yet,
but she will be soon...

916
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:25,250
然后就再也不会哭闹了
and there'll be no more tears.

917
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,083
需要我把这个放在她的房间吗？
Shall I put this in her room?

918
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,750
是的 放在她的围床上
Yes. In her playpen.

919
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,958
不 等等
也许由我来更好
No, wait.
Maybe I'd better take it.

920
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,375
怎么不进屋去呢 米尔斯？
Why don't you go in, Miles?

921
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:35,083
我们大家都在等你呢
We've been waiting for you.

922
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,791
贝基 开车！
快！
Becky, start the car!
Quick!

923
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,541
贝基 走！
Becky, get going!

924
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,000
注意 所有部队...
Attention, all units...

925
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,916
注意 所有部队--
准备逮捕...
attention, all units...
apprehend and detain...

926
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:03,791
米尔斯·本耐尔医生和贝基·德里斯科尔...
Dr. Miles Bennell
and Becky Driscoll...

927
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:05,166
正在向北方前进...
now believed heading north...

928
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,125
开着一辆黑白相间的福特...
in a black and white
Ford sedan...

929
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:12,250
车牌号2-X-3-7-7-9-6
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

930
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,375
所有部队准备设置路障...
All units designated
as roadblocks...

931
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:15,916
各就各位
move to your stations.

932
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:17,125
情况紧急
It is urgent.

933
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:18,916
这两个人必须被逮捕...
These two persons
must be detained...

934
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,125
并且绝不允许他们离开圣米拉
and not permitted
to leave Santa Mira.

935
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:23,333
重复-- 情况紧急...
Repeat... it is urgent...

936
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:30,916
准备搜寻1955年产的黑白色福特车...
Be on the lookout for a 1955
black and white Ford sedan...

937
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:35,416
车牌号2-X-3-7-7-9-6
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

938
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:13,166
试试能不能赶到我的诊室
We'll try to make it
to my office.

939
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,666
从前面的公路右拐
Cut into that alley
on the right.

940
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:48,541
他会回来吗？
Do you think he'll come back?

941
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,583
我不认为天亮之前他们会再回来搜查
I don't think they'll
check again before morning.

942
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:54,666
到那时 杰克应该已经带着援兵赶回来了
By then, Jack should be here
with help.

943
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:03,041
如果杰克没有撑过去怎么办？
What if
Jack doesn't get through?

944
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,625
他一定会扛住的
He's gotta get through.

945
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:06,500
来 吃两片这个
Here. Take two of these.

946
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,500
能帮助你保持清醒
They'll help you to stay awake.

947
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:28,541
我们整晚都绝不能闭眼
We can't close our eyes
all night.

948
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,166
也许一睁眼就会变成...
We may wake up changed...

949
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,708
某种邪恶的 非人类的东西
into something evil and inhuman.

950
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:37,166
在实践中 我见过好多人...
In my practice,
I've seen how people...

951
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:39,833
逐渐失去人性
have allowed their humanity
to drain away.

952
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:43,541
只不过 这一过程是缓慢的
而非突如其来地
Only, it happens slowly
instead of all at once.

953
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,416
他们似乎毫不在意
They didn't seem to mind.

954
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:47,500
那只是少数人而已 米尔斯
But just some people.

955
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,000
我们都一样...一点点的
All of us... a little bit.

956
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,541
心肠日益变硬
逐渐麻木起来
We harden our hearts
and grow callous.

957
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,541
只有到我们必须奋发搏斗
才能保存自己人性的时候...
Only when we have to fight
to stay human...

958
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:59,208
才能意识到它对我们来说有多么珍贵...
do we realize how precious
it is to us...

959
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,541
多么昂贵...
how dear...

960
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:04,666
就像你的存在对我的意义
as you are to me.

961
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:17,458
可能是杰克在找我们
Maybe that's Jack
trying to find us.

962
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,750
他不会笨到打来电话
He'd know better
than to use the phone.

963
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:22,583
他去哪儿了？
Where is he?

964
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:25,083
为什么他还不来呢？
Why doesn't he come?

965
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,708
就像每个周六的清晨一样
Just like any Saturday morning.

966
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:42,958
莱恩·珀尔曼
比尔·比特纳...
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner...

967
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,708
吉姆·克拉克和他的老婆雪莉
还有孩子们...
Jim Clark and his wife Shirley
and their kids...

968
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:48,458
我一生中所相识的所有人
people I've known all my life.

969     
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:49,666
几点了？
What time is it?

970
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,708
七点四十五
Seven forty-five.

971
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:56,750
是的 我懂
Yeah, I know.

972
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,041
对于喧嚣的人流来说这也有点太早了
It's too early to be so busy.

973
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:01,083
他们都在那干什么？
What are they doing here?

974
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:03,083
有答案了
There's the answer.

975
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:05,666
那些一定都是刚到镇上的外乡人
There must be strangers in town.

976
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:08,625
他们得在这儿等车
They're waiting for the bus
to come and go.

977
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:11,291
只有在十一点的时候下一班才能来
There isn't another one
through here until 11:00.

978
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:07,791
农夫们
Farmers.

979
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:12,291
格里马尔迪  皮克斯利...

980
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:13,625
加斯纳！

981
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:15,125
新奥尔良市
Crescent City.

982
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:19,166
如果你在新奥尔良市有亲友 过来拿一个
If you have Crescent City
families, step to truck one.

983
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:21,208
新奥尔良市的...
Crescent City...

984
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:23,208
来第一辆车

00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,708
红岸

986
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,708
所有在红岸有亲友的...
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

987
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,791
到第二辆车这里来
go to truck number two.

988
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:32,833
所有在红岸有亲友的...
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

989
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,208
第二辆车

990
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,041
哈文赫斯特...

00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:37,708
第三辆车

992
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,875
哈文赫斯特--
第三辆车
Havenhurst...
the third truck.

993
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:45,708
米尔斯镇--第三辆车
Mill Town... the third truck.

994
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,708
春泉谷...
Valley Springs...

995
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,208
第三辆车
the third truck.

996
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:51,000
春泉谷 第三辆车...
Valley Springs...

997
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,500
先是咱们这个镇...
First our town...

998
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,500
然后是咱们的那些邻镇...
then all the towns around us.

999
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,000
像是传染性的恶疾...
It's a malignant disease...

1000
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
逐渐蔓延到全国范围
spreading through
the whole country.

1001
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,833
今天就这么多
That's all for today.

1002
00:58:00,833 --> 00:58:03,250
准备好明天再来
Be ready again tomorrow.

1003
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,708
我没时间等杰克了 你呆在这里
I can't wait for Jack
any longer. Stay here.

1004
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:20,875
你不是要出去吧
You're not going out there?

1005
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,416
我必须阻止他们！
I've got to stop them!

1006
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,083
等等！我们在这里还是安全的！
Wait! We're safe here!

1007
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,416
他们不在
但愿咱们来得还不算太迟
They're not here.
I hope we're not too late.

1008
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:31,916
杰克！谢天谢地！
Jack! Thank God!

1009
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:35,625
整个镇都被这些豆荚占领了！
The whole town's been
taken over by the pods!

1010
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:39,125
还没
还剩下你和贝基
Not quite.
There's still you and Becky.

1011
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:41,125
米尔斯 事情其实会简单很多...
Miles, it would have
been so much easier...

1012
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:42,583
如果你昨天晚上乖乖去睡觉的话
if you'd gone to sleep
last night.

1013
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:45,416
放松点
我们是来帮助你的
Relax.
We're here to help you.

1014
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:49,125
你懂的
You know better than that.

1015
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,625
需要我们将它们放在哪里？
Where do you want us
to put them?

1016
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:52,000
想看看它们是怎样成长的吗？
Would you like
to watch them grow?

1017
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,375
- 不用 谢了
- 把它们放在这
- No, thanks.
- Put them in there.

1018
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:57,583
没什么可怕的 我们不会伤害你
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.

1019
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:59,458
等你明白了
你会感激涕零
Once you understand,
you'll be grateful.

1020
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,750
还记得起初我和泰迪是如何的抗拒它吗？
Remember how Teddy and I
fought against it.

1021
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,083
我们错了
We were wrong.

1022
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,583
你是说泰迪不再介意了？
You mean Teddy doesn't mind?

1023
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,083
当然不了 她现在的感觉跟我如出一辙
Of course not.
She feels exactly the way I do.

1024
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:08,583
放我们走！
Let us go!

1025
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:09,791
如果我们出了镇子 就不会再回来了
If we leave town,
we won't come back.

1026
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:13,375
我们可不能放你们走
你们是危险人物
We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.

1027
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,958
别抵抗了 米尔斯
没用的
Don't fight it, Miles.
It's no use.

1028
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:18,458
不久之后 你们都必须要睡觉的
Sooner or later,
you'll have to go to sleep.

1029
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:21,083
我在大厅等你
I'll wait for you in the hall.

1030
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:24,250
米尔斯 你和我一样是学术界人士
Miles,
you and I are scientific men.

1031
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,416
你能明白这发生的一切有多么奇妙
You can understand the wonder
of what's happened.

1032
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:29,208
仅仅设想一下
不到一个月之前...
Just think.
Less than a month ago...

1033
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:31,083
圣米拉还跟其它的城镇都一样--
Santa Mira
was like any other town...

1034
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:32,500
塞满了被烦恼困扰着的人们
people with nothing
but problems.

1035
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,500
这是突然从天上掉下来了解决之道
Then out of the sky
came a solution.

1036
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,500
这些在太空飘荡了不知多少年的种子...
Seeds drifting through space
for years...

1037
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,500
在农夫们的田里生了根
took root in a farmer's field.

1038
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
从种子里长出了豆荚...
From the seeds came pods...

1039
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,916
能够自我繁衍...
which had the power
to reproduce themselves...

1040
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:48,625
就像其他任何的生命形式一样
in the exact likeness
of any form of life.

1041
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:51,125
这就是一切是如何开始的...
So that's how it began...

1042
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,083
...天外来客
out of the sky.

1043
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,958
你的新肉体在里面生长成形
Your new bodies
are growing in there.

1044
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:00,958
他们会从每一个细胞开始统御你的器官...
They're taking you over
cell for cell...

1045
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:02,458
从每一个原子
atom for atom.

1046
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:03,958
没用痛苦
There's no pain.

1047
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,708
一夜之间 在你的睡梦中...
Suddenly, while you're asleep...

1048
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:09,125
它们将吸收你的意识心智和记忆...
they'll absorb your minds,
your memories...

1049
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:12,708
然后你就在另外一个没有烦恼的世界重生了
and you're reborn
into an untroubled world.

1050
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:15,208
千人一面的世界？
Where everyone's the same?

1051
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:17,166
没错
Exactly.

1052
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:19,166
真是个好世界
What a world.

1053
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:22,208
我们并不是唯一幸存的人类
We're not the last humans left.

1054
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:24,083
剩下的人们会摧毁你们
They'll destroy you!

1055
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:27,666
等到明天 你就不会希望他们这样做了
Tomorrow,
you won't want them to.

1056
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,666
明天你就是我们中的一员了
Tomorrow, you'll be one of us.

1057
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:34,791
我爱贝基
I love Becky.

1058
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:37,250
明天 我还会有同样的感情吗？
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?

1059
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,916
压根就不需要什么爱
There's no need for love.

1060
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:41,833
没有情感？
No emotion?

1061
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:46,166
所以你就没有任何感情
只有生存的本能
Then you have no feelings,
only the instinct to survive.

1062
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:48,958
你失去了爱或被爱的能力！
我说的对吗？
You can't love or be loved!
Am I right?

1063
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,583
你说的就好像这很可怕一样
You say it
as if it were terrible.

1064
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:53,250
相信我 一点也不可怕
你又不是没爱过
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.

1065
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:56,750
不存在永恒的爱
从不
It didn't last.
It never does.

1066
01:00:56,750 --> 01:01:00,333
爱，欲望，野心，信仰--
Love, desire, ambition, faith...

1067
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:03,416
没有这些东西 生活会变得好简单
相信我
without them, life's so simple,
believe me.

1068
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:06,375
我可不这么想
I don't want any part of it.

1069
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:08,250
你忘了些事 米尔斯
You're forgetting
something, Miles.

1070
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:09,416
什么？
What's that?

1071
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,708
你没有选择的余地
You have no choice.

1072
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,750
我猜咱们没得选了
I guess we haven't any choice.

1073
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,958
不错
Good.

1074
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:32,166
我想要去爱和被爱！
I want to love and be loved!

1075
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,541
我还想给你生孩子
I want your children.

1076
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:39,541
我不想活在一个没有爱 悲伤
或者美好的世界！
I don't want a world
without love or grief or beauty.

1077
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:41,791
我宁可死
I'd rather die.

1078
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:43,291
不
No.

1079
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:44,500
不要
Not 

1080
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:50,166
除非没有任何出路了
unless there's no other way.

1081
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:51,791
为什么他们不能简单地给咱们打一针...
Why didn't they
give us a shot...

1082
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,291
或者吃点安眠药什么的呢？
or a sleeping pill or something?

1083
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:57,791
药品磨损人的心智
也许是这个原因
Drugs dull the mind.
Maybe that's the reason.

1084
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:08,958
哦不 行不通
No. It wouldn't work.

1085
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,833
我也许能放倒一两个
但是没把握搞定三个
I might get one or even two,
but I couldn't get three.

1086
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,500
你忘了些什么 亲爱的--有我
You're forgetting something,
darling... me.

1087
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,708
现在的局面并不是三对一
It isn't three against one.

1088
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:16,916
而是三对二
给我把刀
It's three against two.
Give me a knife.

1089
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:19,791
不行
No.

1090
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,000
那边
There.

1091
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:37,083
到桌子那里去
Go by the desk.

1092
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,083
里面发生了什么？
What's going on in there?

1093
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:01,750
米尔斯！
把门打开！
Miles!
Unlock the door!

1094
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,458
米尔斯 开门！
Miles, open the door!

1095
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:05,166
开门 米尔斯！
Open the door, Miles!

1096
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,833
啊！
Aah!

1097
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:10,583
开门！
Open the door!

1098
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,416
噢！啊！
Oh! Aah!

1099
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,958
哦！
Oh!

1100
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:38,750
我们唯一的希望就是开上高速路了
Our only hope is
to make it to the highway.

1101
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:53,291
呃 这个
That does it.

1102
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:56,083
唯一的另一条出路是前门...
The only other way
is out the front door...

1103
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,750
而且那边一定有人在看守
and there's bound
to be somebody watching.

1104
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,333
我们得碰碰运气
We'll have to chance it.

1105
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:16,250
眼神放空一点
Keep your eyes
a little wide and blank.

1106
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,750
别表现出任何兴趣和激情
Show no interest or excitement.

1107
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:45,291
好吧 萨姆 我们终于殊途同归了
Well, Sam,
we're finally with you.

1108
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:46,500
他们应该会先通知我的
They were supposed
to let me know.

1109
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,166
头儿说他会先给警察局打电话 然后喊我
The chief said he'd phone
the station, then call me.

1110
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,791
他打过了 但是线路忙
He phoned,
but the line was busy.

1111
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:53,750
他在重拨
He's calling again now.

1112
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:56,541
啊！
Aah!

1113
01:05:56,541 --> 01:05:58,041
看车！
Watch out!

1114
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,541
真对不起 米尔斯
I'm sorry, Miles.

1115
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,750
我是雅纳切克
他们跑了
This is Janzek.
They got away.

1116
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,958
打开警报
Turn the main siren on.

1117
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,791
嘿 台阶！
Hey! Stairs!

1118
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,250
就几步路了
It's only a few steps more.

1119
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:45,583
来啊！
他们往这边跑了！
Come on!
They went this way!

1120
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,791
他们在那上面！
They're over there!

1121
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:37,916
米尔斯 我做不到
Miles, I can't.

1122
01:09:37,916 --> 01:09:39,958
我坚持不下去了
I can't go on.

1123
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:41,791
你一定行
Yes, you can.

1124
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:40,833
这是她的外衣！
他们一定在隧道里！
Here's her sweater!
They must be in the tunnel!

1125
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:53,625
看 汤米
你从那边追！
Look, Tommy,
you go that way!

1126
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:03,166
放弃吧！
你们逃不掉的！
Give up!
You can't get away from us!

1127
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:06,833
我们不会伤害你们的
放弃吧！
We're not going to hurt you!
Give up!

1128
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:19,041
他们没在隧道里
They're not in the tunnel.

1129
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,250
好吧 大伙儿 出来吧
来
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on.

1130
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,750
去山上搜查一下
大伙儿 走 起来
Let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.

1131
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:34,708
米尔斯 我感到无法再保持清醒了
Miles,
I can't stay awake much longer.

1132
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,125
我想他们应该都走了
I think they're all gone now.

1133
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:42,500
我们必须动身了
否则的话就永远也上不了高速了
We'd better start, or we'll
never make it to the highway.

1134
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:44,166
米尔斯 我从未听到过这样美好的声音
Miles, I've never heard
anything so beautiful.

1135
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:45,541
那说明我们并不是唯一仅存的...
It means we're not
the only ones left...

1136
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:47,666
懂得什么是爱的人类
to know what love is.

1137
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:50,875
呆在这 并祈祷他们确实是人类
就像听起来的那样
Stay here, and pray
they're as human as they sound.

1138
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:52,250
再见 亲爱的
Bye, darling.

1139
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:50,750
这里是KCAA电台
您二十四小时无休的欢乐唱机...
This is station KCAA,
the 24-hour platter parade...

1140
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,041
音乐电台--
the station of music...

1141
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,833
贝基
Becky.

1142
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:27,375
贝基！
Becky!

1143
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:33,333
贝基？
Becky?

1144
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:37,208
贝基 你在哪儿？！
Becky, where are you?!

1145
01:14:37,208 --> 01:14:38,916
我在这里 米尔斯
I'm here, Miles.

1146
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:43,708
你没睡着吧？
You didn't go to sleep?

1147
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:45,208
我好累
I'm so tired.

1148
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:48,416
他们不是人
外面有很多他们的人
They weren't people.
It was more of them.

1149
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:50,125
他们正在温室培育数以千计的豆荚
They're growing thousands
of pods in greenhouses.

1150
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,041
我们必须逃跑
We've got to get away.

1151
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:54,083
我精疲力尽了 米尔斯
I'm exhausted, Miles.

1152
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:56,083
我做不到了
I can't make it.

1153
01:15:12,583 --> 01:15:15,250
不睡一觉的话 我们都做不到的
We can't make it
without sleep.

1154
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:19,083
是的 我们能行
Yes, we can.

1155
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:39,583
我睡着了 米尔斯
然后那个发生了
I went to sleep,
Miles, and it happened.

1156
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,375
噢 贝基...
Oh, Becky.

1157
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:44,541
他们说得对
They were right.

1158
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:46,541
我不该离开你的...
I should never have left you.

1159
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:49,250
别像个蠢货一样了
米尔斯 接受我们吧
Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.

1160
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:52,416
不
No.

1161
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:55,250
绝不！
Never!

1162
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:58,875
他在这里！
He's in here!

1163
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:01,000
抓住他！抓住他！
Get him! Get him!

1164
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:12,125
在我的生命中 有过很多害怕的时候...
I've been afraid
a lot of times in my life...

1165
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:14,041
但我从未体会到恐惧的真正含义...
but I didn't know
the real meaning of fear...

1166
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:18,125
直到当时亲吻贝基的那刻
until I had kissed Becky.

1167
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:20,541
只是短暂地陷入了睡眠
然后我所深爱的女孩就...
A moment's sleep,
and the girl I loved...

1168
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:23,291
变成了一心要置我于死地的异类敌人
was an inhuman enemy
bent on my destruction.

1169
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:25,750
那一刻的短暂入眠
扼杀了贝基的灵魂...
That moment's sleep
was death to Becky's soul...

1170
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,458
就像杰克和泰迪身上发生的一样...
just as it had been
for Jack and Teddy...

1171
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:29,333
还有丹·考夫曼和其他所有的人
and Dan Kauffman
and all the rest.

1172
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:30,916
他们的肉体现在已经了宿主...
Their bodies were now hosts...

1173
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:34,333
而里面藏匿的是外星生物
某种来自宇宙的生命形式...
harboring an alien form
of life, a cosmic form...

1174
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:37,083
那种为了生存
必须取代和统御所有人类存在的生命
which, to survive,
must take over every human man.

1175
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,875
所以我就跑 一直跑...
So I ran, I ran...

1176
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:41,333
就像小吉米那天一样夺命狂奔
I ran as little Jimmy
had run the other day.

1177
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:43,500
我唯一的希望就是逃离圣米拉...
My only hope was to get away
from Santa Mira...

1178
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,791
跑上高速公路...
to get to the highway...

1179
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:47,041
去警告其他人这里发生了什么
to warn the others
of what was happening.

1180
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:03,708
等等！
Wait!

1181
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:06,208
由他去吧！
没人会相信她的话！
Let him go!
They'll never believe him.

1182
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:07,708
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

1183
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,000
等等！
Wait!

1184
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,375
救命！救命！等等！
Help! Help! Wait!

1185
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:16,416
等等！停车！
停车听我说！
Wait! Stop!
Stop and listen to me!

1186
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:17,916
听我说！
Listen to me!

1187
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:21,916
那些人正在追杀我 他们不是人类！
Those people that are coming
after me! They're not human!

1188
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:23,875
听我说！
我们的处境非常危险！
Listen to me!
We're in danger!

1189
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:25,750
走开！
Get out of here!

1190
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,208
你们都处于险境 请听我说！
You're in danger! Please!

1191
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,875
滚开！
走！
Get out of here!
Go on!

1192

开车！
Get moving!

1193
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:33,333
他们想要我们所有人的命！
They're after all of us!

1194

所有人！
All of us!

1195
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,416
听我说！
Listen to me!

1196
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:39,708
圣米拉已经没有人类幸存了！
There isn't a human being
left in Santa Mira!

1197
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:42,708
停车！
Stop!

1198
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:45,250
靠边停 我需要援助！
Pull over! I need your help!

1199
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,708
发生了很恐怖的事情！
Something terrible's happened!

1200
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:48,250
你喝多了 从街上走开！
You're drunk!
Get out of the street!

1201
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,250
走开！走！
Get out of here! Go on!

1202
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,791
你疯了吗？大蠢货！
Are you crazy,
you big idiot?

1203
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:08,250
看呐！
你们这些傻瓜 你们深处险境！
Look!
You fools! You're in danger!

1204
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,750
看不见吗？
他们就在后面！
Can't you see?
They're after you!

1205
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,708
他们想要我们所有人的命！
They're after all of us!

1206
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:14,791
我们的妻女 我们的孩子
所有人！
Our wives, our children,
everyone!

1207
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,916
他们已经来了！
They're here already!

1208
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:21,916
你就是下一个！
You're next!

1209
01:18:21,916 --> 01:18:23,416
你是下一个！


1210
01:18:23,416 --> 01:18:24,916
下一个！


1211
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:36,000
你一个字都不相信 是吧？
You don't believe
a word of this, do you?

1212
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,625
当然 我知道这听起来很奇异
但是它实实在在的发生了！
Sure, it's fantastic,
but it happened.

1213
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:39,791
别只是坐在那里用
正在估量拘束衣尺寸的眼神看我！
Don't just sit there
measuring me for a straitjacket!

1214
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:42,291
做些什么！拿起电话！请求援助
Do something! Get on the phone!
Call for help!

1215
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:46,250
唉！什么都没用！
What's the use?

1216
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:04,833
你认为精神理疗会有效吗？
What do you think?
Will psychiatry help?

1217
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:07,583
如果他说的这些仅仅是个噩梦的话 会的
If all this
is a nightmare, yes.

1218
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:08,916
当然只是个噩梦啦
Of course it's a nightmare.

1219
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:11,916
异世界来的植物取代地球上的人类
Plants from another world
taking over human beings.

1220
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:13,500
像三月的野兔一样疯狂
Mad as a March hare.

1221
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:18,583
这是什么情况？
What have we here?

1222
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:20,291
他开着大卡车闯红灯
He ran his truck
through a red light.

1223
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:22,250
被一辆灰狗长途车从侧面撞到了...
Greyhound bus
smacked him broadside...

1224
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,500
翻了车
and tipped him over.

1225
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,916
把他送到手术室
Put him in the O.R.

1226
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:26,708
替我接管本耐尔好吗？
Will you take over Bennell
for me?

1227
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,000
当然
Certainly.

1228
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,416
伤得有多重？
How badly is he hurt?

1229
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:31,958
双腿和左臂 全部粉碎性骨折
Both legs, left arm,
broken all to bits.

1230
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,666
我们当时得把他...
We had to dig him out...

1231
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:38,291
从一堆非常奇异
见所未见的东西下面挖出来
from under the most
peculiar things I ever saw.

1232
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,625
什么东西？
What things?

1233
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,791
我不知道那些事什么玩意
I don't know what they are.

1234
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:42,416
我从没有见过那样的东西
I never saw them before.

1235
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:45,375
看起来就像 呃...
超级巨型豆荚
They looked like, uh,
great big seedpods.

1236
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:47,708
豆荚？
Seedpods?

1237
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,250
这卡车是从哪里来的？
Where was the truck
coming from?

1238
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,583
圣米拉
Santa Mira.

1239
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:59,250
打开电台
拉响全面警报
Get on your radio
and sound an all-points alarm.

1240
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,125
封锁高速公路 阻止所有交通...
Block all highways
and stop all traffic...

1241
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:03,666
给州立的所有执法机关打电话
and call every law enforcement
agency in the state.

1242
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:08,458
接线员 麻烦帮我接联邦调查局
Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

1243
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:09,791
是的！紧急情况！
Yes, it's an emergency!
