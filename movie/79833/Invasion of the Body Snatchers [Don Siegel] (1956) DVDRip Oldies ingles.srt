1
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,205
Dr. Hill.

2
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,673
Dr. Bassett.

3
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,175
Where's the patient?

4
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,510
I hated
to drag you out of bed.

5
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,812
Will you let me go
while there's still time?

6
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,803
You'll soon see why I did.

7
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,953
Will you tell
these fools I'm not crazy?

8
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,122
Make them listen to me
before it's too late!

9
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,124
I'll listen to you.

10
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,490
Let him go.

11
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,497
Who are you?

12
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,999
I'm Dr. Hill
from the state mental hospital.

13
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,635
I'm not insane!

14
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,137
Let him go!

15
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:19,239
Doctor,
now you must listen to me.

16
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,640
You must understand me.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,444
I am a doctor, too.
I am not insane.

18
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,912
All right.

19
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:29,143
Suppose we sit down,
and you tell me what happened?

20
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,654
Well, it started--

21
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,157
for me,
it started last Thursday...

22
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,661
in response to an urgent
message from my nurse.

23
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,664
I'd hurried home
from a medical convention.

24
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,192
At first glance,
everything looked the same.

25
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,867
It wasn't.

26
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,666
Something evil had taken
possession of the town.

27
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,178
These two.

28
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,679
Here you are.

29
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,115
Thank you, sir.
There you are.

30
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,604
Thank you.

31
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,382
Morning, Mr. Fisher.

32
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,124
Doc!

33
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,624
Hiya, Sally.

34
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,128
Hi. Welcome home.
I'm glad you're back.

35
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,829
How's Mickey and the baby?

36
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,099
Fine, but everybody else
in Santa Mira needs a doctor.

37
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,634
You've got an office
full of patients.

38
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,436
Oh, no.
On my first day back?

39
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,872
Some of them have
been waiting for two weeks.

40
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,974
Why didn't you send them
to Pursey or Carmichael?

41
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:30,143
Most of 'em wouldn't go.
They want to see you.

42
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,634
Oh?

43
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,687
What's the matter with them?

44
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,055
They wouldn't say.

45
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:44,354
Usually people can't talk enough
about what's ailing them.

46
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,361
For instance,
Wally Eberhard was in twice...

47
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,030
and called three times,
but he wouldn't say about what.

48
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,198
That's funny.

49
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,900
Nobody would talk--
from Becky Driscoll...

50
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,402
down to that fat
traffic cop Sam Janzek.

51
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,240
Becky Driscoll?
I thought she was in England.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,744
She got back a few days ago,
and she wanted to see you.

53
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,680
Are you still interested?

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,682
My interest in married women
is strictly professional...

55
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,685
or yours would have been
a lost cause long ago.

56
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,356
-How was the convention?
-Wonderful.

57
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:17,017
They wept with envy
when I read my paper.

58
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,961
Come back here!

59
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,121
Jimmy!

60
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:26,567
What's the matter,
Mrs. Grimaldi?

61
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,626
It's nothing. He just don't
want to go to school.

62
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,142
If I were you, I'd have
a talk with his teacher.

63
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:36,143
I will when I get time.

64
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,245
What's the matter?
Has Joe been sick?

65
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,348
No.
We gave the stand up.

66
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:42,684
-Too much work.
-Oh.

67
00:04:42,684 --> 00:04:44,551
The boy's
panic should have told me...

68
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,754
it was more than school
he was afraid of...

69
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,389
and that littered,
closed-up vegetable stand...

70
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,692
should have
told me something, too.

71
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:52,160
When I last saw it,
less than a month ago...

72
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,795
it was the cleanest
and busiest stand on the road.

73
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,530
That's strange.

74
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,100
She was in to see you, too--
last Friday.

75
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,836
I tried to get her to see
Doc Pursey, but she wouldn't.

76
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:04,004
She said only you
could help her.

77
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,239
Whatever it was...

78
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,539
it couldn't have been
too serious, I guess.

79
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,048
One minor concussion,
two cases of the common cold...

80
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,051
and six canceled appointments.

81
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:18,553
Looks like you rushed me here
for nothing.

82
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:21,055
I don't understand it.
They couldn't wait to see you.

83
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,558
But you're still booked up solid
for the afternoon.

84
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:27,329
I bet they don't show.
Look, there's Wally Eberhard...

85
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,530
talking somebody
into buying some insurance.

86
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,764
There's nothing wrong with him.

87
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,130
Bill Bitner's taking
his secretary to lunch.

88
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:34,803
And speaking of lunch...

89
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:37,405
will you tell whoever that is
that I'm out having mine?

90
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,573
Is Dr. Bennell in?

91
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:40,508
Yes, he's here.

92
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,277
Do you suppose
he has time to see me?

93
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:44,145
If he hasn't,
something's wrong with him.

94
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:45,339
Go right in.

95
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,775
Becky.

96
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:52,420
Almost five years.

97
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,688
It's wonderful to be home again.

98
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:54,923
I've been away so long...

99
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:57,517
I feel almost like a stranger
in my own country.

100
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,662
Hope you don't mind my coming
without an appointment.

101
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:02,897
Not at all.
What'll you have?

102
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,632
We're pushing appendectomies
this week.

103
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,800
Oh, Miles.

104
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,103
I don't know,
maybe I clown around too much.

105
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:10,105
Pretty soon, my patients...

106
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:12,607
won't trust me
to prescribe aspirin for them.

107
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,109
Seriously, what's the trouble?

108
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:16,277
It's my cousin.

109
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:18,245
Wilma?
What's the matter with her?

110
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:21,316
She has a...

111
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:23,953
I guess you'd call it
a delusion.

112
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:26,321
You know her uncle?
Uncle Ira?

113
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:27,922
Sure. I'm his doctor.

114
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:30,959
She's got herself
thinking he isn't her uncle.

115
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,795
How do you mean?
That they're not really related?

116
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:35,497
She thinks
he's an impostor or something...

117
00:06:35,497 --> 00:06:37,399
someone who only looks like Ira.

118
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,800
Have you seen him?

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,034
I just came from there.

120
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:43,538
Is he Uncle Ira,
or isn't he Uncle Ira?

121
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:44,706
Of course he is.

122
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:46,808
I told Wilma that,
but it was no use.

123
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,578
Please, would you stop by
and have a talk with her?

124
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,147
Sally says I'm booked up
for the afternoon...

125
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,815
but why don't you ask her
to come in and see me?

126
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:55,305
I'll try.

127
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:58,687
How about some lunch?

128
00:06:58,687 --> 00:07:01,019
I can't.
I'm meeting Dad at the store.

129
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:06,962
When did you get back?

130
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:09,632
I came back from London
two months ago.

131
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:11,065
I've been in Reno.

132
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,233
Reno?

133
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,102
Reno.

134
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,604
Dad tells me
you were there, too.

135
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:17,106
Five months ago.

136
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:19,108
Oh, I'm sorry.

137
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:20,608
So was I.

138
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:23,111
I wanted it to work.

139
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:26,549
I guess that makes us
lodge brothers now.

140
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:27,750
Yes.

141
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,819
Except I'm paying dues
while you collect them.

142
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,981
Ha ha ha! Miles.

143
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,465
-Hello, doc.
-How are you?

144
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:43,632
Sam!

145
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:45,634
At it again, eh?

146
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:46,969
My nurse tells me
you were in last week...

147
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:49,137
and wanted very much
to see me.

148
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:51,129
It wasn't anything important.

149
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:54,143
Didn't he go to college with us?

150
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:56,145
Quit his second year
to get married...

151
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:58,647
like I wanted us to do.

152
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:01,250
Just be thankful
I didn't take you seriously.

153
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,785
You be thankful.

154
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,253
I found out
that a doctor's wife...

155
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:05,954
needs the understanding
of an Einstein...

156
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:07,590
and patience of a saint.

157
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,091
And love?

158
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:11,093
I wouldn't know about that.

159
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,095
I'm just a general practitioner.

160
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:15,598
Love is handled
by the specialists.

161
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,601
Here's where I leave you.

162
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:20,102
You know something?

163
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:23,606
This is where you left me
the last time.

164
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,096
Hiya, Johnny.

165
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:33,983
Sally, I'm off.

166
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,151
Tell the answering service
I'll be at home.

167
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:37,620
Good night, doc.

168
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,722
I'm not going in there!

169
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:42,392
Stop all this nonsense.

170
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:45,628
Hey! Take it easy!

171
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:47,630
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?

172
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,633
Yes, Doctor.
Can I talk to you a moment?

173
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,568
Sure. I almost
ran you down this morning.

174
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:53,636
You got to be careful
when you run out in the road.

175
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,137
Come on.

176
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:56,627
Come on.

177
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:02,077
Hey! Hey! Hey!

178
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:04,580
Hey! Slow down now.

179
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,315
School isn't as bad as all that.

180
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:07,884
School isn't what upsets him.

181
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:09,252
It's my daughter-in-law.

182
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,754
He's got the crazy idea
she isn't his mother.

183
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:13,255
She isn't! She isn't!

184
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,857
Don't let her get me!

185
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:17,986
Nobody's going
to get you, Jimmy.

186
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:26,169
How long has this been going on?

187
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,938
An hour ago,
I found him in the cellar.

188
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:32,274
He wouldn't say anything until
I started to phone his mother.

189
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:34,110
That's when he said Anna
wasn't his mother.

190
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,613
Could you keep him
with you for a day or so?

191
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:39,248
Give him one of these every
four hours during the day.

192
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:41,116
Call me tomorrow and let me know
how he's feeling.

193
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:42,619
Yes, Doctor, thank you.

194
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:44,788
Don't let her get me!

195
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:46,813
Nobody's going to get you.

196
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:55,131
All right, Jimmy.

197
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:56,632
Open your mouth.

198
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:58,133
Shut your eyes.

199
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,236
In the words of the poet...

200
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:02,172
I'll give you something
to make you wise.

201
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:05,641
That's a good boy, Jimmy.

202
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,677
I'm not going home ever.

203
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:10,013
You're staying at your
grandmother's. Call his mother.

204
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:11,348
She's not my mother!

205
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:13,683
All right. Run along.
Everything's going to be OK.

206
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:15,217
You be a good boy now.

207
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:16,653
Good night, Doctor.

208
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:17,847
Good night.

209
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:22,192
I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.

210
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,660
I'm going to stop off
and see Wilma Lentz.

211
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,362
Should I call the boy's mother?

212
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:27,364
Yes.
Tell her what happened...

213
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:29,532
and that I suggested
the boy spend the night...

214
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:31,193
at his grandmother's house.

215
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,677
Hello, Miles.

216
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:43,146
Nice to see you, Wilma.
Becky.

217
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,581
Let's have it.

218
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:46,249
You talked to him.
What do you think?

219
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:47,484
It's him.

220
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:49,552
He's your Uncle Ira, all right.

221
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:51,077
He is not.

222
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:00,698
How is he different?

223
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:01,831
That's just it.

224
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:04,834
There is no difference
you can actually see.

225
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,170
He looks, sounds, acts,
and remembers...

226
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,372
like Uncle Ira.

227
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:09,940
Then he is your Uncle Ira.

228
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,343
You see that?
No matter how you feel, he is.

229
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:15,845
But he isn't.
There's something missing.

230
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:19,215
He's been a father to me
since I was a baby.

231
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:20,784
Always when he talked to me...

232
00:11:20,784 --> 00:11:24,421
there was a special look
in his eye.

233
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:25,723
That look's gone.

234
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:28,525
What about memories?
There must be certain things...

235
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:30,994
that only you and he
would know about.

236
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:32,162
There are.

237
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:34,598
I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all...

238
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:37,862
down to the last small detail,
just like Uncle Ira would.

239
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:41,171
But, Miles...

240
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,673
there's no emotion.

241
00:11:42,673 --> 00:11:43,841
None!

242
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:46,677
Just the pretense of it.

243
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:48,678
The words, gesture,
the tone of voice...

244
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:51,648
everything else is the same,
but not the feeling.

245
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:55,953
Memories or not,
he isn't my Uncle Ira.

246
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:58,021
Wilma, I'm on your side.

247
00:11:58,021 --> 00:11:59,790
My business
is people in trouble...

248
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,225
and I'm going to find
a way to help you.

249
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:03,994
No one could possibly
impersonate your Uncle Ira...

250
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:06,596
without you
or your Aunt Eleda or even me...

251
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,599
seeing a million
little differences.

252
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,668
I want you to realize that.

253
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,803
Think about it,
and then you'll know...

254
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:16,106
that the trouble is inside you.

255
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:18,576
Wilma, where are you?

256
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:20,478
Out on the lawn.

257
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,379
Say nothing to her.

258
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,316
Why, Miles,
I didn't know you were here.

259
00:12:25,316 --> 00:12:26,517
Welcome home.

260
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:27,752
Hello, Mrs. Lentz.

261
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:29,920
Did you ask Miles
to stay for dinner?

262
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,088
Can't tonight.

263
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:32,356
I'm making spoon bread.

264
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:33,858
Please, don't tempt me.

265
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:35,092
Maybe next time.

266
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:37,094
Wilma, where are my glasses?

267
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:39,029
I think
they're on the mantelpiece.

268
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,360
I'll go with you.

269
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,611
Am I going crazy?

270
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:55,613
Don't spare me.
I've got to know.

271
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:57,615
No, you're not.
Even these days...

272
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:00,285
it isn't as easy to go crazy
as you might think.

273
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:02,052
But you don't have to be
losing your mind...

274
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:04,488
to need psychiatric help.

275
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:07,024
I'd like you to see
a doctor friend of mine.

276
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,860
-A psychiatrist?
-Dan Kauffman.

277
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,728
I'll make an appointment
for you tomorrow.

278
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,269
All right.

279
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,793
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.

280
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:27,168
Better break this up,
or he'll start wondering.

281
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,314
Wondering what?

282
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,850
If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help...

283
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,687
and I don't want either of you
to worry about me.

284
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:36,922
I'll be all right.

285
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:38,489
Sure you will.

286
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:40,591
Staying here, Becky?
Or may I drive you home?

287
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,126
Would you like me to stay?

288
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:44,930
Of course not.
Good night.

289
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,419
Good night.

290
00:13:56,707 --> 00:13:59,109
Nice having Becky
back again, eh, boy?

291
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:00,600
Sure is.

292
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:06,817
In the back of my mind...

293
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,587
a warning bell was ringing.

294
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:10,322
Sick people
who couldn't wait to see me...

295
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:12,324
then suddenly
were perfectly all right.

296
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:14,625
A boy claiming
his mother wasn't his mother.

297
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,694
A woman claiming her uncle
wasn't her uncle.

298
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:18,063
But I didn't listen.

299
00:14:18,063 --> 00:14:19,998
Obviously, the boy's mother
was his mother.

300
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:23,134
I had seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.

301
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:25,269
There was no doubt of that
after I talked to him.

302
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,572
Miles, he is Ira?

303
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:30,342
Of course he is.
What do you mean?

304
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:32,509
It's just Wilma's so positive.

305
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,079
Will she be all right?

306
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,580
I think so.

307
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,515
I'm a doctor,
according to my diploma...

308
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:39,951
but I don't really know
what Wilma's trouble is.

309
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:42,253
I could start talking
psychiatrical jargon...

310
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:45,246
but it's out of my line
and in Dan Kauffman's.

311
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:49,527
I wish you didn't have
to go home for dinner.

312
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:52,519
I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.

313
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:56,101
I could pick you up
at 7:00.

314
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:57,602
Well...

315
00:14:57,602 --> 00:15:00,205
It's summer,
and the moon is full.

316
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:01,406
"I know a bank...

317
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:04,242
MILES,
"where the wild thyme grows."

318
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:05,937
You haven't changed a bit.

319
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:21,826
Whup! Whoa! Watch out!

320
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:23,061
Sorry.

321
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:25,430
Hey, Miles,
when did you get back?

322
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,666
This morning.
How are you, Danny?

323
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,832
This is Miss Driscoll.

324
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,768
Dr. Kauffman--
our one and only psychiatrist.

325
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:31,970
Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.

326
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,505
I should.
I brought her into the world.

327
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:35,007
You did us all a favor.

328
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,776
This saves me a phone call.

329
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:39,544
I've got a kid and a woman
who need a witch doctor.

330
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:41,279
Boy says his father
isn't his father...

331
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,416
and the woman says her sister
isn't her sister?

332
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,017
That's pretty close.

333
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:47,018
I knew you'd been
studying hypnosis...

334
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:48,820
but when did you start
reading minds?

335
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,322
He doesn't have to read them.

336
00:15:50,322 --> 00:15:52,291
I've sent him a dozen patients
since it started.

337
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,327
What is it?
What's going on?

338
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:56,828
I don't know.
A strange neurosis...

339
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:59,631
evidently contagious--
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

340
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:01,429
In two weeks,
it's spread all over town.

341
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:03,836
What causes it?

342
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:06,463
Worry about
what's going on in the world.

343
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:10,109
Make room
for Wilma Lentz tomorrow.

344
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:12,745
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.

345
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:13,904
So long, Danny.

346
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:22,555
This is the oddest thing
I ever heard of.

347
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:24,489
Let's hope we don't catch it.

348
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:26,492
I'd hate to wake up
some morning...

349
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:28,160
and find out you weren't you.

350
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,496
I'm not the high-school
kid you used to romance.

351
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:31,731
How could you tell?

352
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:32,897
You really want to know?

353
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:34,057
Mm-hmm.

354
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:43,669
Mmm.
You're Becky Driscoll.

355
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:48,080
Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.

356
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,582
Has ever since you got back.

357
00:16:50,582 --> 00:16:53,586
Is this an example
of your bedside manner, Doctor?

358
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:56,077
No, ma'am.
That comes later.

359
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,467
Good evening, Doctor.

360
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:10,436
What happened
to the crowd tonight?

361
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:13,064
I don't know.
It's been this way for weeks.

362
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:17,309
At least we don't
have to wait for a table.

363
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,578
Take your pick.
Here or here.

364
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,414
Here, I think.
Shall we?

365
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,581
Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,983
Where's the band?

367
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,987
Business slumped,
so I had to let them go.

368
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:28,254
There's the jukebox, though.

369
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:30,022
Shall we dance?

370
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:31,991
I hope you didn't
let the bartender go.

371
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:33,993
I'm the bartender.
Martinis?

372
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:35,825
Two. Dry.

373
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:39,157
Very dry.

374
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:43,235
Miles, I don't care
what Dr. Kauffman says.

375
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:44,504
I'm worried.

376
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:46,272
You are in the capable hands...

377
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,507
of your personal physician.

378
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,009
Oh, Doctor.

379
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,512
Ah, there's our evening.

380
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,002
Sorry.

381
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:58,517
Thanks.

382
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:00,019
Dr. Bennell.

383
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:03,623
Jack Belicec wants you
to come to his house right away.

384
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:05,458
He says it's urgent.

385
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,449
Thank you.

386
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:10,964
Better hold those drinks.

387
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,132
Emergency.

388
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,633
At least they called
before we ordered dinner.

389
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:15,801
How hungry are you?

390
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,103
I can wait.

391
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:18,472
It may be a while.

392
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,973
I'll go with you.

393
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,964
Sorry.
We'll be back later.

394
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,981
There's Jack.

395
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,373
What's the matter?
Teddy sick?

396
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,108
No.

397
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:57,377
Thank heaven.
I thought you'd never arrive.

398
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:58,778
Then who is sick?

399
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:00,012
Nobody.

400
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,816
Then why'd you
drag me away from my dinner?

401
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:04,985
You won't believe it
until you see it.

402
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:06,286
Hello, Becky.

403
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:07,878
-Hello, Becky.
-Hi, Teddy.

404
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,928
Could you forget
you're a doctor a while?

405
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:16,196
Why?

406
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,298
I don't want you
calling the police.

407
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:20,767
Quit acting like a writer.

408
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:23,327
Maybe you can tell me.
You're the doctor.

409
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:36,605
Miles, put the light on
over the pool table.

410
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,890
Go on. Pull it down.

411
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:36,036
What do you make of it?

412
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:39,213
Who is he?

413
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:41,612
I have no idea.

414
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:50,049
Its face, Miles.
It's vague.

415
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:53,728
Like the first impression
that's stamped on a coin.

416
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:54,895
It isn't finished.

417
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:56,063
You're right.

418
00:20:56,063 --> 00:20:58,065
All the features
but no details...

419
00:20:58,065 --> 00:20:59,833
no character, no lines.

420
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,769
It's no dead man.

421
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,771
Have you got
an ink pad around the house?

422
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:05,840
There's one in the desk.
Why?

423
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,009
I want to take
the corpse's fingerprints.

424
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:10,311
Of course
it's a dead man.

425
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,047
I don't know,
but I've got a feeling that...

426
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:15,916
I know this sounds crazy,
but if I should do an autopsy...

427
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,010
I think I'd find every organ
in perfect condition...

428
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:24,287
as perfect
as the body is externally...

429
00:21:26,294 --> 00:21:28,296
everything in working order.

430
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:31,356
All set to go. Hold that down.

431
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:38,739
These are blank.

432
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:41,042
Waiting for the final
finished face...

433
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,677
to be stamped onto it.

434
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:45,313
But whose face?

435
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:47,178
Tell me that.

436
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:50,543
We could all use a drink.

437
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,121
Bourbon all right?

438
00:21:54,121 --> 00:21:55,323
Fine.

439
00:21:55,323 --> 00:21:56,891
Not for me, thanks.

440
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:59,193
Miles, answer me.
Whose face?

441
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,062
I haven't the slightest idea...

442
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:02,364
have you?

443
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,766
How tall would you say
that thing is?

444
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,768
Oh, 5'10", thereabouts.

445
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,770
How much does it weigh?

446
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:13,274
It's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.

447
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:16,539
Jack's 5'10"
and weighs 140 pounds.

448
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:18,946
Ow!

449
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:21,283
Teddy, will you stop
talking nonsense?

450
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:25,286
I'm sorry, darling,
but it isn't nonsense.

451
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:28,290
Becky, you don't think
it's nonsense, do you?

452
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,658
Of course it is.

453
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,292
Jack's standing here
in front of you.

454
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:33,728
Of course I am,
bleeding to death.

455
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,895
Excuse me.

456
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,063
You know what?

457
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,328
I'm afraid you may live.

458
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:41,869
Here, this should fix it.

459
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:43,804
Miles,
shouldn't we call the police...

460
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:46,808
and have them take
that dead body out of here?

461
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:49,810
I'm afraid
it isn't just a dead body.

462
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,300
Thanks.

463
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,746
I wonder if...

464
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:05,260
What?

465
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,095
I wonder
if there's any connection.

466
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,863
What do you mean?

467
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:11,266
There's something
strange afoot in Santa Mira.

468
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:15,771
Dr. Kauffman calls it
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

469
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:18,272
Becky's cousin's got it,
for one.

470
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,509
She thinks that her uncle
and her aunt...

471
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,277
aren't her uncle and her aunt.

472
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,780
There's several cases
of such delusion.

473
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,782
This isn't you yet...

474
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,775
but there is
a structural likeness.

475
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:33,522
It's fantastic.

476
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:35,623
There must be some reason
this is here.

477
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,626
Would you be willing
to sit up...

478
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,561
and see what your friend's
next move is?

479
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:43,031
If nothing happens by morning,
call the police.

480
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:44,532
If something happens...

481
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:46,368
call me, will you?

482
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:48,029
You know I will.

483
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,144
Good night.
Take it easy.

484
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,312
Sure.

485
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,647
Nothing will happen.

486
00:23:58,647 --> 00:23:59,881
Good night, Becky.

487
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:01,049
If it does...

488
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:03,950
it'll make a charming,
bloodcurdling mystery story.

489
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:14,496
I was careful
not to let Becky know...

490
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,764
but I was really scared.

491
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:18,934
Dan Kauffman's explanation
of what was wrong in town...

492
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:20,336
mass hysteria...

493
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:23,327
couldn't explain away that body
on Jack's billiard table.

494
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:39,455
Come in
while I turn the lights on.

495
00:24:39,455 --> 00:24:40,789
You're a forward wench...

496
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:42,791
dragging me into a dark hallway
to be kissed.

497
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:45,126
I'm dragging you
into a dark hallway...

498
00:24:45,126 --> 00:24:47,363
because I'm scared of the dark
tonight.

499
00:24:47,363 --> 00:24:49,531
I'd better stay
and tuck you in.

500
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,055
That way lies madness.

501
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:54,937
What's wrong with madness?

502
00:24:54,937 --> 00:24:56,768
Madness.
Now good night.

503
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:07,749
It's about time
you two got home.

504
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:10,685
Dad, what are you doing
in the basement this late?

505
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:12,088
Working in my shop.

506
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:13,322
Want a nightcap, doc?

507
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:14,657
No, thanks.
It's kind of late.

508
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:16,758
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.

509
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:18,260
Good night.

510
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,761
Good night.

511
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:21,753
Good night, Miles.

512
00:25:53,695 --> 00:25:55,631
Aaah!

513
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:57,300
Look, Jack!

514
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,302
It's you! It's you!

515
00:25:59,302 --> 00:26:01,237
No, no!
You mustn't go near it!

516
00:26:01,237 --> 00:26:03,239
Get out of here! Please!

517
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,729
Please!

518
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:07,208
Miles!

519
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:10,246
What happened, Jack?

520
00:26:10,246 --> 00:26:12,748
Teddy says the thing
in our place is me...

521
00:26:12,748 --> 00:26:15,651
right down
to the cut on my hand.

522
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:17,086
I didn't wait to look.

523
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:19,255
It's alive! It's alive!

524
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:21,757
The hand was cut and bleeding!

525
00:26:21,757 --> 00:26:24,760
And the position
of the body had changed!

526
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,489
Here, here. Take this.

527
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:32,894
I'll call Danny Kauffman.

528
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:53,723
Hello?

529
00:26:53,723 --> 00:26:54,925
Hello, Danny?

530
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,093
Yeah?

531
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:58,394
Something's happened.
I've got to see you.

532
00:26:58,394 --> 00:27:00,496
Will you get over here fast?

533
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:02,531
It's important.

534
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:04,966
Oh...OK.

535
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:08,904
He's on his way.

536
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:10,740
I'll make some coffee
and be right with you.

537
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,174
Good deal, Miles.
Thanks.

538
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:17,011
What about Becky?
Do you think she's all right?

539
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,494
Dad, what are you
doing in the basement this late?

540
00:27:30,494 --> 00:27:31,859
Working in my shop.

541
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:36,198
I don't know what it was...

542
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:37,500
call it a premonition...

543
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,504
but suddenly, I had the feeling
that Becky was in danger.

544
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:42,495
I had to get to her
as quickly as possible.

545
00:28:02,525 --> 00:28:04,661
I was going
to ring the bell...

546
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:06,891
but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.

547
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:09,794
Something was wrong
in this house.

548
00:30:59,904 --> 00:31:01,339
Becky.

549
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:02,506
Becky!

550
00:31:02,506 --> 00:31:03,837
Becky!

551
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:38,877
Miles, will you tell me
what happened?

552
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:40,212
The same thing.

553
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:41,647
I found another one...

554
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:43,347
in the cellar
at Becky's house...

555
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:45,883
coming to life
while I stood there watching it.

556
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:47,386
It was Becky.

557
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:50,222
Yeah? I want to see
one of these bodies.

558
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:51,690
All right.

559
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,558
You're going to bed,
and you're staying with her.

560
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:56,828
Put on your clothes.
We'll go to Jack's first.

561
00:31:56,828 --> 00:31:58,330
Got any coffee around here?

562
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,899
Yeah.
You'll find some in the kitchen.

563
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,833
He doesn't believe me, Beck.

564
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,995
He will.

565
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:18,917
Somebody's playing games!

566
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:21,052
Rough ones.

567
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:23,689
There's a blood spot.

568
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:26,224
What you saw was the body
of a murdered man.

569
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:27,859
Did you examine it carefully?

570
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,026
Yes.

571
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:31,129
I don't know
what's happened to it.

572
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:33,498
It wasn't an ordinary body.
There wasn't a mark on it.

573
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:35,634
I checked it, too.
Not a scratch.

574
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:36,868
You can kill a man...

575
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:38,869
by shoving an ice pick
into the base of his brain...

576
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:41,406
leaving a puncture so small
the naked eye can't see.

577
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:44,042
You're ignoring the fact
this wasn't a normal body.

578
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:45,744
What about the hand
Teddy mentioned?

579
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:49,114
I heard lots of things
Teddy said and none made sense.

580
00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:51,350
Hold on, pal.
I was here, too.

581
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,118
So was Miles.

582
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:55,387
Look, we took his fingerprints.

583
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:58,290
Look at that.
Tell me why it didn't have any.

584
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,926
He didn't want any,
so he took them off with acid.

585
00:33:00,926 --> 00:33:02,694
Stop trying
to rationalize everything.

586
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:04,529
We have a mystery on our hands.

587
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:05,998
Sure. A real one.

588
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:08,500
Whose body was it,
and where is it now?

589
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,168
A completely normal mystery.

590
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:13,005
Whatever it is, it's well within
the bounds of human experience.

591
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:14,674
Don't blow things
out of proportion.

592
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:17,042
I wouldn't if I hadn't
looked in Becky's cellar.

593
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:18,877
How do you explain the body
I saw there?

594
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:20,445
I don't think you saw one.

595
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:21,780
And the body here?

596
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,183
I know you saw it.
Three others saw it, too.

597
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:25,917
But I dreamed up
the second one?

598
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:28,020
Doctors can have
hallucinations, too.

599
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,088
The mind is a strange
and wonderful thing.

600
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:32,458
I'm not sure it'll ever be able
to figure itself out.

601
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:35,027
Everything else, maybe--
from the atom to the universe--

602
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:36,428
everything except itself.

603
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:38,930
Nevertheless,
I saw Becky's double...

604
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,366
and the body that we saw here...

605
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,535
bore an uncomfortable
resemblance to Jack.

606
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:44,202
Mighty uncomfortable.

607
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:46,534
Let's go to Becky's
and have a look.

608
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:52,878
Where's your
girlfriend's double?

609
00:33:52,878 --> 00:33:55,039
OK, skeptic,
lift the lid.

610
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,127
There's a body here,
all right.

611
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:09,829
-It's Becky's double.
-It sure is.

612
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:11,159
Take another look.

613
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:17,603
Now you see it,
now you don't.

614
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:20,572
It was there--
half-hidden by that blanket.

615
00:34:20,572 --> 00:34:23,743
You said
you saw it there just now.

616
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:24,911
I thought I did.

617
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:26,813
Why did you come here
tonight?

618
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:28,514
You'd seen a dead man
at Jack's...

619
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:29,848
an average-sized man.

620
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:32,018
The face in death
was smooth and unlined...

621
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:34,587
bland in expression,
which often happens.

622
00:34:34,587 --> 00:34:36,022
You had just become aware...

623
00:34:36,022 --> 00:34:38,890
of a curious, unexplainable,
epidemic mass hysteria.

624
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,028
Men, women, and children
suddenly convinced themselves...

625
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:43,896
that their relatives weren't
their relatives at all...

626
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:46,165
so your mind
started playing tricks...

627
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:48,301
and reality became unreality.

628
00:34:48,301 --> 00:34:51,237
The dead man became
Jack's double in your eyes.

629
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:52,405
Come off it, Dan.

630
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:54,607
I know
it's all hard to believe...

631
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:57,376
but these things happen--
even to witch doctors like me.

632
00:34:57,376 --> 00:35:00,146
I saw her here!
She was real!

633
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:02,181
You saw her
in every tiny detail...

634
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,550
as vividly as anyone
has ever seen anything...

635
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,919
but only in your mind.

636
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:09,820
Danny, talk all night,
but you're not convincing me.

637
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:14,495
What are you doing in my cellar?

638
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:17,497
Using it for an office.
These gentlemen are patients...

639
00:35:17,497 --> 00:35:19,795
badly in need
of psychiatric treatment.

640
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:22,803
They've been having nightmares.

641
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:24,103
If you're drunk,
you'd better sober up quick.

642
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:25,338
The police are coming.

643
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:26,672
No, we're not drunk.

644
00:35:26,672 --> 00:35:28,808
Nothing that simple.
Pull up a chair.

645
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:30,343
Why, you're all crazy.

646
00:35:30,343 --> 00:35:32,779
What's going on down there?

647
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:34,814
Hello, Nick.
Glad to see you.

648
00:35:34,814 --> 00:35:38,851
You saved these two characters
a trip to the station.

649
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:42,588
They want to report
finding a body and losing it.

650
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:44,357
Where? When?

651
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:46,392
At my place about 7:00.

652
00:35:46,392 --> 00:35:48,996
Why did you
wait so long to report it?

653
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:50,464
You know better than that, doc.

654
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:54,033
It was a curious sort
of a body...

655
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:57,404
and then it wasn't there
anymore.

656
00:35:57,404 --> 00:36:00,806
I have a good mind
to throw you both in jail.

657
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:03,176
If you'd seen it,
you'd understand why we waited.

658
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:06,346
Thin man...5'10"...

659
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:08,215
fingerprints burned off
with acid?

660
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:11,584
Just seen it on the slab
in the morgue.

661
00:36:11,584 --> 00:36:12,818
Turned up
in a burning haystack...

662
00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:16,323
on Mike Gessner's south pasture
two hours ago.

663
00:36:16,323 --> 00:36:18,725
Now break it up!

664
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:20,316
Go on home!

665
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:30,992
You win.
Pick up the marbles.

666
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:38,711
Good morning.

667
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:40,042
Good morning.

668
00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:44,885
Orange juice.

669
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:46,752
Thank you.

670
00:36:46,752 --> 00:36:48,487
How do you
like your eggs?

671
00:36:48,487 --> 00:36:50,157
Any way you'd like.

672
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:51,425
Boiled, two minutes?

673
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:52,593
Two minutes?

674
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:54,094
Mm-hmm.

675
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:55,356
OK.

676
00:36:56,395 --> 00:36:57,965
You know...

677
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,034
dragging you out of bed
last night was some trouble...

678
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,369
but it was worth it.

679
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:03,495
Seriously, Miles.

680
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,466
What was that?

681
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,970
Who is it?

682
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:14,681
It's the gas man.

683
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:15,909
Morning, doc.

684
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:19,286
Good morning, Charlie.

685
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:20,554
I guess I'm a little jittery.

686
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:22,489
Not getting enough sleep.

687
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:24,224
I won't bother you anymore.

688
00:37:24,224 --> 00:37:26,460
Putting a meter outside
on the patio.

689
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,661
OK.

690
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:29,997
The eggs will be hard-boiled.

691
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,531
Did you do this
for your husband?

692
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:32,699
Mm-hmm.

693
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:34,401
Didn't your wife
do this for you?

694
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:37,271
Yes. She liked to cook.

695
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:39,439
That's one of the reasons
why I'm single--

696
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:42,476
I never was there
when dinner was on the table.

697
00:37:42,476 --> 00:37:43,944
Take my advice...

698
00:37:43,944 --> 00:37:45,646
and don't get mixed up
with a doctor.

699
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,014
They're seldom at home.

700
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,017
What would you say
if I told you...

701
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,518
I was already
mixed up with a doctor?

702
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:53,954
I'd say it was too good
to be true.

703
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:56,490
Things like this
can happen all of a sudden.

704
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,925
What's "all of a sudden"
about two people...

705
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:59,916
who've been friends
most of their lives?

706
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,462
Good morning.

707
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:04,064
Good morning.

708
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,365
I thought
I smelled some coffee.

709
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:06,534
Why didn't you give me a call?

710
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,835
I didn't want to wake Teddy.

711
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:10,570
She's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.

712
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,306
Good.

713
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:15,209
But I don't feel
she should go home right away.

714
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,479
Would you mind taking in
boarders for a while?

715
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:21,815
Or do you have something else
in mind?

716
00:38:21,815 --> 00:38:24,485
I was toying with an idea...

717
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:25,953
but you can stay.

718
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:27,689
Here, Jack.

719
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:29,815
Thank you, doll.
I'll take it to Teddy.

720
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:41,969
Miles, did you make
that appointment for me...

721
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:43,137
with the psychiatrist?

722
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:44,639
Yes. 2:00.

723
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,841
I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.

724
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:50,378
I woke up this morning,
and everything was all right.

725
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:52,714
-You don't know my relief.
-Yes, I do.

726
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:55,350
Will you call Becky
and tell her? She was worried.

727
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,516
All right.

728
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:58,019
She's at your house.

729
00:38:58,019 --> 00:38:59,554
At your house? Why?

730
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:02,148
It's a long story,
but she'll tell you about it.

731
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:19,633
Becky's still at his house.

732
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:24,945
All right.

733
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:28,516
Good morning.

734
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:30,451
Good morning, Sally.

735
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,919
Take a peek at what's
in the reception room.

736
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:39,327
Mother,
why don't we go home?

737
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:41,091
In a little while,
Jimmy.

738
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:47,297
He certainly made
a quick recovery.

739
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:52,940
I guess we all have.

740
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,175
But driving home...

741
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:56,511
I had a lot of questions
and no answers.

742
00:39:56,511 --> 00:39:59,481
How could Jimmy and Wilma
seem so normal now?

743
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,416
Surely I had done nothing
to cure them.

744
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:05,352
Maybe they wanted me
to feel secure, but why?

745
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:07,856
Well...

746
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:09,857
I hope
you didn't forget the steaks.

747
00:40:09,857 --> 00:40:11,359
I never forget anything.

748
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,395
Don't worry about him.
He's completely housebroken.

749
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:16,064
I need a martini, Beck.

750
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:17,232
Onion or olive?

751
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:19,534
Doesn't matter.
I want to pour it on the coals.

752
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:20,735
They just won't burn.

753
00:40:20,735 --> 00:40:22,670
A martini isn't dry enough.

754
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,873
I'll get you something
that'll start it.

755
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:26,534
For drinking purposes.

756
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:29,677
You're looking shipshape.

757
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,235
Thank you, sir.

758
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:42,487
Here we are.

759
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:07,138
Jack! Jack!

760
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:12,813
Ugh.

761
00:41:16,692 --> 00:41:19,024
They're like huge seedpods!

762
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:22,620
This must be how that
body in my closet was formed.

763
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:25,934
Where are they from?

764
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:28,270
I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods...

765
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,138
they must grow someplace
on a plant.

766
00:41:30,138 --> 00:41:32,975
And somebody or something wants
this duplication to take place.

767
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:34,643
But when they're finished...

768
00:41:34,643 --> 00:41:35,811
what happens to our bodies?

769
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:37,045
I don't know.

770
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:39,214
When the process is complete,
probably the original...

771
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:40,649
is destroyed or disintegrates...

772
00:41:40,649 --> 00:41:41,817
No! Wait!

773
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:43,285
Sorry,
but I take a dim view...

774
00:41:43,285 --> 00:41:44,920
of watching my own destruction
take place.

775
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,256
There isn't any danger
until they're completely formed.

776
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,057
We learned that last night
at your house.

777
00:41:49,057 --> 00:41:51,059
Your blank
didn't change right away.

778
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:53,084
Not until you fell asleep.

779
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:57,866
Miles, when the change
does take place...

780
00:41:57,866 --> 00:41:59,902
do you suppose
there's any difference?

781
00:41:59,902 --> 00:42:01,169
There must be.

782
00:42:01,169 --> 00:42:04,006
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.

783
00:42:04,006 --> 00:42:06,341
So did I.

784
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:08,711
My father.

785
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:11,313
That must be
what he was doing...

786
00:42:11,313 --> 00:42:14,116
in the cellar last night--
placing one of these.

787
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,284
I'm sorry.

788
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:17,353
I felt something wrong,
but I thought it was me...

789
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:19,021
because I'd been away
for so long.

790
00:42:19,021 --> 00:42:21,356
They must be destroyed,
all of them!

791
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:22,858
They will be--
every one of them.

792
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:25,128
We're going to have
to search every building...

793
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:26,396
every house in town.

794
00:42:26,396 --> 00:42:28,096
Men, women, and children
have to be examined.

795
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:29,331
We've got some phoning to do.

796
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:30,632
I'm going to stay
and watch them.

797
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm staying with you.

798
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,035
Don't call the police!

799
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:34,270
Nick Grivett
didn't find any body...

800
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,828
on a burning haystack!

801
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,413
Why don't you call
Danny? Maybe he can help.

802
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:44,881
Danny?

803
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:46,081
No.

804
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:47,849
I'm afraid it's too late
to call Danny, too.

805
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:49,318
What are you going to do?

806
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,486
Get help.

807
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:53,512
I hope whatever's taking place
is confined to Santa Mira!

808
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:02,565
Operator.

809
00:43:02,565 --> 00:43:04,666
This is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency.

810
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:07,837
I want to talk to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in L.A.

811
00:43:07,837 --> 00:43:09,272
Can you convince them?

812
00:43:09,272 --> 00:43:10,607
I've got to.

813
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:12,208
Where did they come from?

814
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:15,010
So much has been
discovered these past few years.

815
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,178
Anything is possible.

816
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:18,014
Maybe the results
of atomic radiation...

817
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:20,316
on plant life or animal life...

818
00:43:20,316 --> 00:43:23,852
some weird alien organism,
a mutation of some kind.

819
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,556
Why should they take the form
of people--of us?

820
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:28,691
I don't know.

821
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:29,892
Whatever it is...

822
00:43:29,892 --> 00:43:31,693
whatever intelligence
or instinct it is...

823
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:35,365
that can govern the forming
of human flesh and blood...

824
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,233
out of thin air is...

825
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:38,768
well,
it's fantastically powerful...

826
00:43:38,768 --> 00:43:40,936
beyond any comprehension,
malignant.

827
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:42,171
All that body
in your cellar needed...

828
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:44,540
was a mind, and it was...

829
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,976
And it was taking mine
while I was asleep.

830
00:43:46,976 --> 00:43:49,078
I could take
that pitchfork myself, and--

831
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:51,414
On your call
to Los Angeles, Doctor...

832
00:43:51,414 --> 00:43:52,982
they don't answer.

833
00:43:52,982 --> 00:43:55,551
Try again! That office
is open day and night!

834
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:58,349
If they've taken over
the phone office, we're dead.

835
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:15,494
Is that me?

836
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:47,970
This is an emergency!
Emergency!

837
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,029
Look, there's been--Hello?

838
00:44:51,575 --> 00:44:53,811
Operator,
get me a better connection.

839
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:55,243
I'll try, Doctor.

840
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:57,947
It's no use.

841
00:44:57,947 --> 00:44:59,950
All the Los Angeles circuits
are dead.

842
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,853
OK, try Sacramento!
Give me the state capital.

843
00:45:02,853 --> 00:45:04,877
I want to talk to the governor.

844
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:09,426
The Sacramento
circuits are busy, Doctor.

845
00:45:09,426 --> 00:45:10,984
I'll call you back.

846
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:14,697
All right.

847
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:16,187
All right.
I'll wait for your call.

848
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,060
I'll take the phone outside.

849
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:27,478
Jack, they've got the phone.

850
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:30,447
You and the girls take your car
and make a run for it.

851
00:45:30,447 --> 00:45:32,348
First town you get to,
yell for help.

852
00:45:32,348 --> 00:45:33,549
What about you?

853
00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:34,952
That phone
is gonna ring soon.

854
00:45:34,952 --> 00:45:37,421
If nobody answers,
they'll block the roads.

855
00:45:37,421 --> 00:45:38,589
I'll stall them.

856
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:39,857
Then what?

857
00:45:39,857 --> 00:45:41,257
Try and find out
what's in back of this.

858
00:45:41,257 --> 00:45:42,893
-I'm staying.
-No!

859
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:44,724
Miles,
don't ask me to leave you.

860
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,698
Jack, get going.

861
00:45:47,698 --> 00:45:49,266
Miles, I can't--

862
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:50,767
Somebody's got to go,
or we don't get help!

863
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:52,402
Please,
let's get out of here!

864
00:45:52,402 --> 00:45:54,131
Watch out for yourselves.

865
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:58,442
Go over by the phone.
Stay there.

866
00:45:58,442 --> 00:45:59,738
If it rings, call me.

867
00:46:39,283 --> 00:46:40,484
Hello.

868
00:46:40,484 --> 00:46:41,919
Is Dr. Bennell there?

869
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,155
-Yes. I'll get him.
-Never mind.

870
00:46:44,155 --> 00:46:46,456
Just tell him the Sacramento
circuits are still busy...

871
00:46:46,456 --> 00:46:48,125
and ask him if he wants me
to keep trying.

872
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:49,493
All right. Hold on.

873
00:46:49,493 --> 00:46:51,596
Miles,
the circuits are still busy!

874
00:46:51,596 --> 00:46:52,964
Tell her to keep trying!

875
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:55,124
Also, try San Francisco
and Washington!

876
00:47:01,439 --> 00:47:02,941
We're getting
out of here right now.

877
00:47:02,941 --> 00:47:04,174
Where are we going?

878
00:47:04,174 --> 00:47:05,334
Sally's!

879
00:47:07,878 --> 00:47:09,848
We're still unable
to get through to Los Angeles.

880
00:47:09,848 --> 00:47:12,217
Do you wish me to keep trying?

881
00:47:12,217 --> 00:47:13,444
Dr. Bennell?

882
00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:16,353
Dr. Bennell?

883
00:47:16,353 --> 00:47:18,156
I needed
someone I could trust...

884
00:47:18,156 --> 00:47:21,292
and I figured Sally, my nurse,
was my best bet.

885
00:47:21,292 --> 00:47:24,461
I decided to try to phone her
to see if she was at home.

886
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:26,464
Maybe they hadn't
taken over the pay phones.

887
00:47:26,464 --> 00:47:28,733
I'll try the pay phone.

888
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:30,735
Hey, Mac!

889
00:47:30,735 --> 00:47:32,502
Oh, hi, doc.
How are you?

890
00:47:32,502 --> 00:47:35,173
Will you get me
a couple gallons fast?

891
00:47:35,173 --> 00:47:37,342
Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry!

892
00:47:37,342 --> 00:47:38,707
Get the windshield, will you?

893
00:47:41,912 --> 00:47:44,905
I have to have the keys
to open the gas tank.

894
00:47:47,185 --> 00:47:49,653
Somebody sick out this way?

895
00:47:49,653 --> 00:47:51,488
There's been an accident.

896
00:47:51,488 --> 00:47:53,625
Funny.
We haven't heard about it.

897
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,260
It just happened.

898
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,695
Before I could
even get her number...

899
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,796
I saw Mac closing
the trunk of my car.

900
00:47:59,796 --> 00:48:01,099
He could have been
checking my spare tire...

901
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:02,734
but I didn't think so.

902
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:03,902
That should do it.

903
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:05,103
Thank you.

904
00:48:05,103 --> 00:48:06,304
All set?

905
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:07,838
-All set, doc.
-Fine. Thanks.

906
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:10,330
-Put it on my bill, will you?
-Sure, doc.

907
00:48:29,961 --> 00:48:31,861
What's the matter?

908
00:48:57,822 --> 00:49:00,222
We've got to make it
to Sally's house.

909
00:49:10,035 --> 00:49:12,904
I wasn't sure
I could trust anyone...

910
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:15,395
but I took a chance
and drove to Sally's anyway.

911
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:24,282
When I saw several cars
in front of the house...

912
00:49:24,282 --> 00:49:25,840
I decided to play it safe.

913
00:49:31,756 --> 00:49:33,057
What's wrong?

914
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:35,059
Probably nothing,
but we're not going in there...

915
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,295
until I'm sure it's safe.

916
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:38,464
Slide under the wheel
and get out of here fast...

917
00:49:38,464 --> 00:49:40,795
if anybody shows up
looking for us.

918
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:09,661
The baby asleep yet, Sally?

919
00:50:09,661 --> 00:50:11,597
Not yet,
but she will be soon...

920
00:50:11,597 --> 00:50:13,799
and there'll be no more tears.

921
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:15,634
Shall I put this in her room?

922
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:17,301
Yes. In her playpen.

923
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:20,539
No, wait.
Maybe I'd better take it.

924
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:21,940
Why don't you go in, Miles?

925
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,635
We've been waiting for you.

926
00:50:30,182 --> 00:50:32,384
Becky, start the car!
Quick!

927
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:34,113
Becky, get going!

928
00:50:44,296 --> 00:50:46,565
Attention, all units...

929
00:50:46,565 --> 00:50:49,468
attention, all units--
apprehend and detain...

930
00:50:49,468 --> 00:50:52,371
Dr. Miles Bennell
and Becky Driscoll...

931
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:53,739
now believed heading north...

932
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:55,707
in a black and white
Ford sedan...

933
00:50:55,707 --> 00:51:00,813
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

934
00:51:00,813 --> 00:51:02,948
All units designated
as roadblocks...

935
00:51:02,948 --> 00:51:04,483
move to your stations.

936
00:51:04,483 --> 00:51:05,684
It is urgent.

937
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:07,486
These two persons
must be detained...

938
00:51:07,486 --> 00:51:09,721
and not permitted
to leave Santa Mira.

939
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:11,882
Repeat--it is urgent...

940
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,499
Be on the lookout for a 1 955
black and white Ford sedan...

941
00:51:19,499 --> 00:51:23,958
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

942
00:51:59,204 --> 00:52:01,741
We'll try to make it
to my office.

943
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:03,231
Cut into that alley
on the right.

944
00:53:34,434 --> 00:53:37,104
Do you think he'll come back?

945
00:53:37,104 --> 00:53:40,139
I don't think they'll
check again before morning.

946
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:43,233
By then, Jack should be here
with help.

947
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:51,618
What if
Jack doesn't get through?

948
00:53:51,618 --> 00:53:53,186
He's gotta get through.

949
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:55,055
Here. Take two of these.

950
00:53:55,055 --> 00:53:57,046
They'll help you to stay awake.

951
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:17,110
We can't close our eyes
all night.

952
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:18,702
We may wake up changed...

953
00:54:20,147 --> 00:54:22,274
into something evil and inhuman.

954
00:54:24,018 --> 00:54:25,718
In my practice,
I've seen how people...

955
00:54:25,718 --> 00:54:28,389
have allowed their humanity
to drain away.

956
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:32,126
Only, it happens slowly
instead of all at once.

957
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:33,994
They didn't seem to mind.

958
00:54:33,994 --> 00:54:36,062
But just some people.

959
00:54:36,062 --> 00:54:38,565
All of us--a little bit.

960
00:54:38,565 --> 00:54:42,136
We harden our hearts
and grow callous.

961
00:54:42,136 --> 00:54:44,103
Only when we have to fight
to stay human...

962
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:47,775
do we realize how precious
it is to us...

963
00:54:47,775 --> 00:54:49,106
how dear...

964
00:54:51,645 --> 00:54:53,202
as you are to me.

965
00:55:03,724 --> 00:55:06,026
Maybe that's Jack
trying to find us.

966
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:08,290
He'd know better
than to use the phone.

967
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,156
Where is he?

968
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:13,661
Why doesn't he come?

969
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:26,270
Just like any Saturday morning.

970
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,552
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner...

971
00:55:31,552 --> 00:55:35,255
Jim Clark and his wife Shirley
and their kids...

972
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:37,025
people I've known all my life.

973
00:55:37,025 --> 00:55:38,219
What time is it?

974
00:55:40,394 --> 00:55:43,263
Seven forty-five.

975
00:55:43,263 --> 00:55:45,299
Yeah, I know.

976
00:55:45,299 --> 00:55:46,601
It's too early to be so busy.

977
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:49,670
What are they doing here?

978
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,672
There's the answer.

979
00:55:51,672 --> 00:55:54,242
There must be strangers in town.

980
00:55:54,242 --> 00:55:57,211
They're waiting for the bus
to come and go.

981
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:59,873
There isn't another one
through here until 1 1 :00.

982
00:56:54,302 --> 00:56:56,361
Farmers.

983
00:56:57,605 --> 00:57:00,842
Grimaldi, Pixley...

984
00:57:00,842 --> 00:57:02,176
Gessner!

985
00:57:02,176 --> 00:57:03,678
Crescent City.

986
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:07,715
If you have Crescent City
families, step to truck one.

987
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,784
Crescent City...

988
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:11,786
the first truck.

989
00:57:11,786 --> 00:57:13,288
Redbank.

990
00:57:13,288 --> 00:57:16,291
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

991
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:18,359
go to truck number two.

992
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:21,396
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

993
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,797
truck number two.

994
00:57:22,797 --> 00:57:24,632
Havenhurst...

995
00:57:24,632 --> 00:57:26,301
the third truck.

996
00:57:26,301 --> 00:57:28,470
Havenhurst--
the third truck.

997
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:31,105
Mill Town--the third truck.

998
00:57:31,105 --> 00:57:34,309
Mill Town--the third truck.

999
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:36,311
Valley Springs...

1000
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:37,813
the third truck.

1001
00:57:37,813 --> 00:57:39,547
Valley Springs...

1002
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:41,049
First our town...

1003
00:57:41,049 --> 00:57:44,052
then all the towns around us.

1004
00:57:44,052 --> 00:57:45,553
It's a malignant disease...

1005
00:57:45,553 --> 00:57:47,555
spreading through
the whole country.

1006
00:57:47,555 --> 00:57:49,390
That's all for today.

1007
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,824
Be ready again tomorrow.

1008
00:58:05,307 --> 00:58:08,276
I can't wait for Jack
any longer. Stay here.

1009
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,444
You're not going out there?

1010
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,012
I've got to stop them!

1011
00:58:11,012 --> 00:58:12,674
Wait! We're safe here!

1012
00:58:17,085 --> 00:58:19,020
They're not here.
I hope we're not too late.

1013
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,454
Jack! Thank God!

1014
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:24,192
The whole town's been
taken over by the pods!

1015
00:58:24,192 --> 00:58:27,695
Not quite.
There's still you and Becky.

1016
00:58:27,695 --> 00:58:29,698
Miles, it would have
been so much easier...

1017
00:58:29,698 --> 00:58:31,133
if you'd gone to sleep
last night.

1018
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,965
Relax.
We're here to help you.

1019
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,706
You know better than that.

1020
00:58:37,706 --> 00:58:39,208
Where do you want us
to put them?

1021
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,576
Would you like
to watch them grow?

1022
00:58:40,576 --> 00:58:42,944
-No, thanks.
-Put them in there.

1023
00:58:42,944 --> 00:58:46,147
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.

1024
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,017
Once you understand,
you'll be grateful.

1025
00:58:48,017 --> 00:58:50,352
Remember how Teddy and I
fought against it.

1026
00:58:50,352 --> 00:58:51,654
We were wrong.

1027
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:53,154
You mean Teddy doesn't mind?

1028
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,658
Of course not.
She feels exactly the way I do.

1029
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,159
Let us go!

1030
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,394
If we leave town,
we won't come back.

1031
00:58:58,394 --> 00:59:01,930
We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.

1032
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:03,532
Don't fight it, Miles.
It's no use.

1033
00:59:03,532 --> 00:59:07,002
Sooner or later,
you'll have to go to sleep.

1034
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,638
I'll wait for you in the hall.

1035
00:59:09,638 --> 00:59:12,808
Miles,
you and I are scientific men.

1036
00:59:12,808 --> 00:59:14,977
You can understand the wonder
of what's happened.

1037
00:59:14,977 --> 00:59:17,780
Just think.
Less than a month ago...

1038
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,647
Santa Mira
was like any other town--

1039
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:21,083
people with nothing
but problems.

1040
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:24,086
Then out of the sky
came a solution.

1041
00:59:24,086 --> 00:59:27,089
Seeds drifting through space
for years...

1042
00:59:27,089 --> 00:59:29,090
took root in a farmer's field.

1043
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,093
From the seeds came pods...

1044
00:59:31,093 --> 00:59:33,495
which had the power
to reproduce themselves...

1045
00:59:33,495 --> 00:59:37,232
in the exact likeness
of any form of life.

1046
00:59:37,232 --> 00:59:39,735
So that's how it began...

1047
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:41,669
out of the sky.

1048
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:46,509
Your new bodies
are growing in there.

1049
00:59:46,509 --> 00:59:49,511
They're taking you over
cell for cell...

1050
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:51,013
atom for atom.

1051
00:59:51,013 --> 00:59:52,514
There's no pain.

1052
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:54,249
Suddenly, while you're asleep...

1053
00:59:54,249 --> 00:59:57,686
they'll absorb your minds,
your memories...

1054
00:59:57,686 --> 01:00:01,256
and you're reborn
into an untroubled world.

1055
01:00:01,256 --> 01:00:03,760
Where everyone's the same?

1056
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,761
Exactly.

1057
01:00:05,761 --> 01:00:07,730
What a world.

1058
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,766
We're not the last humans left.

1059
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:12,669
They'll destroy you!

1060
01:00:12,669 --> 01:00:15,738
Tomorrow,
you won't want them to.

1061
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:17,228
Tomorrow, you'll be one of us.

1062
01:00:21,878 --> 01:00:23,380
I love Becky.

1063
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,814
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?

1064
01:00:25,814 --> 01:00:28,484
There's no need for love.

1065
01:00:28,484 --> 01:00:30,387
No emotion?

1066
01:00:30,387 --> 01:00:34,723
Then you have no feelings,
only the instinct to survive.

1067
01:00:34,723 --> 01:00:37,526
You can't love or be loved!
Am I right?

1068
01:00:37,526 --> 01:00:39,129
You say it
as if it were terrible.

1069
01:00:39,129 --> 01:00:41,831
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.

1070
01:00:41,831 --> 01:00:45,334
It didn't last.
It never does.

1071
01:00:45,334 --> 01:00:48,905
Love, desire, ambition, faith--

1072
01:00:48,905 --> 01:00:52,007
without them, life's so simple,
believe me.

1073
01:00:52,007 --> 01:00:54,943
I don't want any part of it.

1074
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:56,846
You're forgetting
something, Miles.

1075
01:00:56,846 --> 01:00:58,014
What's that?

1076
01:00:58,014 --> 01:01:00,278
You have no choice.

1077
01:01:04,854 --> 01:01:07,323
I guess we haven't any choice.

1078
01:01:07,323 --> 01:01:08,517
Good.

1079
01:01:18,134 --> 01:01:20,727
I want to love and be loved!

1080
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,108
I want your children.

1081
01:01:25,108 --> 01:01:28,111
I don't want a world
without love or grief or beauty.

1082
01:01:28,111 --> 01:01:30,380
I'd rather die.

1083
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,881
No.

1084
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:33,075
No.

1085
01:01:35,752 --> 01:01:38,755
Not unless there's no other way.

1086
01:01:38,755 --> 01:01:40,390
Why didn't they
give us a shot...

1087
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:42,892
or a sleeping pill or something?

1088
01:01:42,892 --> 01:01:46,384
Drugs dull the mind.
Maybe that's the reason.

1089
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:57,507
No. It wouldn't work.

1090
01:01:57,507 --> 01:02:00,410
I might get one or even two,
but I couldn't get three.

1091
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,078
You're forgetting something,
darling--me.

1092
01:02:02,078 --> 01:02:03,279
It isn't three against one.

1093
01:02:03,279 --> 01:02:05,474
It's three against two.
Give me a knife.

1094
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,340
No.

1095
01:03:14,385 --> 01:03:15,545
There.

1096
01:03:24,395 --> 01:03:25,657
Go by the desk.

1097
01:03:45,649 --> 01:03:47,651
What's going on in there?

1098
01:03:47,651 --> 01:03:50,321
Miles!
Unlock the door!

1099
01:03:50,321 --> 01:03:52,056
Miles, open the door!

1100
01:03:52,056 --> 01:03:53,724
Open the door, Miles!

1101
01:03:53,724 --> 01:03:55,385
JACK,   Aah!

1102
01:03:57,962 --> 01:03:59,122
Open the door!

1103
01:04:11,842 --> 01:04:13,969
Oh! Aah!

1104
01:04:15,346 --> 01:04:16,540
Oh!

1105
01:04:24,922 --> 01:04:27,322
Our only hope is
to make it to the highway.

1106
01:04:40,372 --> 01:04:41,872
That does it.

1107
01:04:41,872 --> 01:04:44,642
The only other way
is out the front door...

1108
01:04:44,642 --> 01:04:46,310
and there's bound
to be somebody watching.

1109
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,869
We'll have to chance it.

1110
01:05:01,825 --> 01:05:04,828
Keep your eyes
a little wide and blank.

1111
01:05:04,828 --> 01:05:06,319
Show no interest or excitement.

1112
01:05:30,354 --> 01:05:33,858
Well, Sam,
we're finally with you.

1113
01:05:33,858 --> 01:05:35,093
They were supposed
to let me know.

1114
01:05:35,093 --> 01:05:37,728
The chief said he'd phone
the station, then call me.

1115
01:05:37,728 --> 01:05:40,365
He phoned,
but the line was busy.

1116
01:05:40,365 --> 01:05:42,299
He's calling again now.

1117
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:45,136
Aah!

1118
01:05:45,136 --> 01:05:46,602
Watch out!

1119
01:05:49,374 --> 01:05:51,103
I'm sorry, Miles.

1120
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:44,295
This is Janzek.
They got away.

1121
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:45,523
Turn the main siren on.

1122
01:06:55,573 --> 01:06:57,337
Hey! Stairs!

1123
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:18,853
It's only a few steps more.

1124
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,141
Come on!
They went this way!

1125
01:07:55,934 --> 01:07:58,369
They're over there!

1126
01:09:24,424 --> 01:09:26,526
Miles, I can't.

1127
01:09:26,526 --> 01:09:28,527
I can't go on.

1128
01:09:28,527 --> 01:09:30,358
Yes, you can.

1129
01:10:27,254 --> 01:10:29,381
Here's her sweater!
They must be in the tunnel!

1130
01:10:39,366 --> 01:10:42,199
Look, Tommy,
you go that way!

1131
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:51,711
Give up!
You can't get away from us!

1132
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:55,408
We're not going to hurt you!
Give up!

1133
01:11:06,026 --> 01:11:07,595
They're not in the tunnel.

1134
01:11:07,595 --> 01:11:09,829
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on.

1135
01:11:09,829 --> 01:11:12,320
Let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.

1136
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:23,275
Miles,
I can't stay awake much longer.

1137
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:27,714
I think they're all gone now.

1138
01:11:27,714 --> 01:11:31,081
We'd better start, or we'll
never make it to the highway.

1139
01:12:29,276 --> 01:12:32,746
Miles, I've never heard
anything so beautiful.

1140
01:12:32,746 --> 01:12:34,115
It means we're not
the only ones left...

1141
01:12:34,115 --> 01:12:36,250
to know what love is.

1142
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:39,453
Stay here, and pray
they're as human as they sound.

1143
01:12:39,453 --> 01:12:40,817
Bye, darling.

1144
01:13:35,309 --> 01:13:39,313
This is station KCAA,
the 24-hour platter parade...

1145
01:13:39,313 --> 01:13:40,610
the station of music--

1146
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,405
Becky.

1147
01:14:14,748 --> 01:14:15,976
Becky!

1148
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:21,881
Becky?

1149
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,760
Becky, where are you?!

1150
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,455
I'm here, Miles.

1151
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,266
You didn't go to sleep?

1152
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:33,768
I'm so tired.

1153
01:14:33,768 --> 01:14:37,005
They weren't people.
It was more of them.

1154
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,707
They're growing thousands
of pods in greenhouses.

1155
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:40,608
We've got to get away.

1156
01:14:40,608 --> 01:14:42,677
I'm exhausted, Miles.

1157
01:14:42,677 --> 01:14:44,668
I can't make it.

1158
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:03,791
We can't make it
without sleep.

1159
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:07,624
Yes, we can.

1160
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:28,156
I went to sleep,
Miles, and it happened.

1161
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,953
Oh, Becky.

1162
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,128
They were right.

1163
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:35,130
I should never have left you.

1164
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,826
Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.

1165
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:40,998
No.

1166
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,806
Never!

1167
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,407
He's in here!

1168
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:47,442
He's in here!

1169
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,569
Get him! Get him!

1170
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:00,723
I've been afraid
a lot of times in my life...

1171
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,624
but I didn't know
the real meaning of fear...

1172
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:06,695
until I had kissed Becky.

1173
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:09,131
A moment's sleep,
and the girl I loved...

1174
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,866
was an inhuman enemy
bent on my destruction.

1175
01:16:11,866 --> 01:16:14,336
That moment's sleep
was death to Becky's soul...

1176
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,071
just as it had been
for Jack and Teddy...

1177
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,940
and Dan Kauffman
and all the rest.

1178
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,508
Their bodies were now hosts...

1179
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:22,944
harboring an alien form
of life, a cosmic form...

1180
01:16:22,944 --> 01:16:25,648
which, to survive,
must take over every human man.

1181
01:16:25,648 --> 01:16:27,450
So I ran, I ran...

1182
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:29,919
I ran as little Jimmy
had run the other day.

1183
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,087
My only hope was to get away
from Santa Mira...

1184
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,355
to get to the highway...

1185
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:35,620
to warn the others
of what was happening.

1186
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,274
Wait!

1187
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,777
Let him go!
They'll never believe him.

1188
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:56,312
Help! Help!

1189
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:57,612
Wait!

1190
01:16:57,612 --> 01:16:59,945
Help! Help! Wait!

1191
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,987
Wait! Stop!
Stop and listen to me!

1192
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:06,489
Listen to me!

1193
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:10,493
Those people that are coming
after me! They're not human!

1194
01:17:10,493 --> 01:17:12,428
Listen to me!
We're in danger!

1195
01:17:12,428 --> 01:17:14,296
Get out of here!

1196
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,798
You're in danger! Please!

1197
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,434
Get out of here!
Go on!

1198
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:19,902
Get moving!

1199
01:17:19,902 --> 01:17:21,904
They're after all of us!

1200
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:23,305
All of us!

1201
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,007
Listen to me!

1202
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:28,272
There isn't a human being
left in Santa Mira!

1203
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:31,313
Stop!

1204
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,816
Pull over! I need your help!

1205
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,317
Something terrible's happened!

1206
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,852
You're drunk!
Get out of the street!

1207
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:38,843
Get out of here! Go on!

1208
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,369
Are you crazy,
you big idiot?

1209
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:56,839
Look!
You fools! You're in danger!

1210
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:59,341
Can't you see?
They're after you!

1211
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,278
They're after all of us!

1212
01:18:01,278 --> 01:18:03,345
Our wives, our children,
everyone!

1213
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,481
They're here already!

1214
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:07,316
You're next!

1215
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:08,985
You're next!

1216
01:18:08,985 --> 01:18:10,487
You're next!

1217
01:18:10,487 --> 01:18:11,987
You're next!

1218
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,477
You're next!

1219
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:24,600
You don't believe
a word of this, do you?

1220
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,236
Sure, it's fantastic,
but it happened.

1221
01:18:26,236 --> 01:18:28,338
Don't just sit there
measuring me for a straitjacket!

1222
01:18:28,338 --> 01:18:30,828
Do something! Get on the phone!
Call for help!

1223
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:34,808
What's the use?

1224
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:53,396
What do you think?
Will psychiatry help?

1225
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:56,166
If all this
is a nightmare, yes.

1226
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:57,500
Of course it's a nightmare.

1227
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,504
Plants from another world
taking over human beings.

1228
01:19:00,504 --> 01:19:02,096
Mad as a March hare.

1229
01:19:05,275 --> 01:19:07,176
What have we here?

1230
01:19:07,176 --> 01:19:08,911
He ran his truck
through a red light.

1231
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:10,814
Greyhound bus
smacked him broadside...

1232
01:19:10,814 --> 01:19:12,082
and tipped him over.

1233
01:19:12,082 --> 01:19:13,483
Put him in the O.R.

1234
01:19:13,483 --> 01:19:15,285
Will you take over Bennell
for me?

1235
01:19:15,285 --> 01:19:16,552
Certainly.

1236
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:17,988
How badly is he hurt?

1237
01:19:17,988 --> 01:19:20,513
Both legs, left arm,
broken all to bits.

1238
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:23,226
We had to dig him out...

1239
01:19:23,226 --> 01:19:26,863
from under the most
peculiar things I ever saw.

1240
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:28,198
What things?

1241
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:29,366
I don't know what they are.

1242
01:19:29,366 --> 01:19:31,001
I never saw them before.

1243
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:33,970
They looked like, uh,
great big seedpods.

1244
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:36,306
Seedpods?

1245
01:19:36,306 --> 01:19:37,841
Where was the truck
coming from?

1246
01:19:37,841 --> 01:19:39,172
Santa Mira.

1247
01:19:44,514 --> 01:19:47,851
Get on your radio
and sound an all-points alarm.

1248
01:19:47,851 --> 01:19:49,719
Block all highways
and stop all traffic...

1249
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:52,211
and call every law enforcement
agency in the state.

1250
01:19:54,024 --> 01:19:57,027
Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

1251
01:19:57,027 --> 01:19:58,358
Yes, it's an emergency!
