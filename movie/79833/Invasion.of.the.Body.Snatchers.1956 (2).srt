1
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,348
孩子们 这里的花更多 过来摘吧
There's some more flowers, kids.
Go pick 'em.

2
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:57,517
哦……
Yeah!

3
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,395
这朵真漂亮！
That's a pretty one!

4
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:08,393
-我一朵花都没有
-那就去找一朵吧 那边就有
- I don't have one.
- Well, go look for one, over there.

5
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:12,152
哦 这朵真漂亮  让我看看
Oh, that's beautiful. Let me look at that.

6
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,322
让我看看
Let me look at that!

7
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:19,909
你们可以把花带回家给爸爸妈妈 多香啊！
Now you can take them home
to your parents. Don't they smell nice!

8
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:27,707
你好
Hi.

9
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:37,503
怎么不把地上的信捡起来 杰弗里？
Too much trouble to pick the mail up
off the floor, Geoffrey?

10
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:41,922
没听到吗？
Hello?

11
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,550
来看看这朵花
Look at this flower.

12
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:55,307
别这样！阿塔韦！
All right! Attaway!

13
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,644
知道吗 我想我找到稀罕物了
You know, I think I actually
found something rare.

14
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,103
什么？
What?

15
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:08,602
这朵花 我想是grex（可能是一种植物）
什么？
- This plant. I think it's a grex.
- A what?

16
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,601
G-R-E-X 是两个不同物种交叉授粉
G-R-E-X. That's when
two species cross-pollinate

17
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,609
产生的第三种独特的物种
and produce a third
completely unique one.

18
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,739
听听注释：
And listen to this:

19
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:24,656
Epilobic 来源于希腊语的epi  
在……之上 或者 是指一种豆荚类植物
"Epilobic, from the Greek epi: upon,
and lobos: a pod."

20
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,855
很多品种都是危险的野草 避免接触
"Many of the species are dangerous
weeds and should be avoided."

21
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,275
危险？
Dangerous?

22
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,454
对于花园来说
In the garden.

23
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:35,962
看到没？ 这么快就扎根了
See? Look how quickly it roots.

24
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:39,581
他们在欧洲很多饱经战火的城市
"Their rapid and widespread growth
was even observed

25
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:42,551
快速的生长和广泛的分布已经引起注意
in many of the war-torn cities of Europe."

26
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,669
确实 这类植物中的一些在被破坏的地表生长的很好
"lndeed, some of these plants
may thrive on devastated ground."

27
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:50,497
我们周末出去维尔怎么样？周五就上飞机 嗯？
Why don't we go up to Vail
for the weekend? Fly up Friday, hm?

28
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,507
好吧 也许……没问题
OK, maybe. Sure.

29
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,925
杰弗里！我正看书呢！
Geoffrey! I'm trying to read!

30
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,725
你心情不错嘛
You're in a good mood.

31
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:01,263
我等着看晚上的季后赛呢
Well, I got something
to look forward to tonight - playoffs.

32
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:03,313
杰弗里！
Geoffrey.

33
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:06,311
-怎么啦？

34
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,850
好吧！我会戴上耳机的 好了 满意了吧？
OK! I'll put the earphones on.
There, see? Happy?

35
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:12,390
算了 我去楼下看书
Never mind. I'll go downstairs.

36
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:19,478
开门 Qui est l?
谁？
Comment? Qui est l?
Who is it?

37
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:21,657

Department of Health.

38
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:28,784
晚安 贝纳尔先生 见到你真高兴
Bonsoir, Monsieur Bennell.
How nice to see you.

39
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:52,336
那是什么东西？
What is that supposed to be?

40
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:55,215
这是塞尔韦勒炖鱼
It is cervelles en matelote.

41
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:58,383
说英语 这东西是什么做的？
In English, what would I be eating
if I ate that?

42
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:02,682
哦 是把小牛的脑子放在红酒里煮
除了红酒还有什么？
- Ah. Calves' brains in red wine.
- Red wine and what else?

43
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:07,641
玉米 这可不能说 这是秘密 贝纳尔先生
Mais, c'est impossible. It's impossible.
It's a secret, Mr Bennell.

44
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:11,939
卫生署可不管什么秘密不秘密的 亨利
You don't have any secrets
from the Department of Health, Henri.

45
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,187
要用勃艮第葡萄酒 牛高汤
A good young Burgundy, brown stock,

46
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,276
百里香 欧芹-一小支

刺山柑 新鲜的月桂叶和大蒜
Capers,... a fresh bay leaf, and garlic.

48
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:26,074
就这些？
是 是的
- That's all?
- Oui. Yes.

49
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:37,450
这是什么？
刺山柑
- What is that?
- A caper.

50
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,659
不对
No.

51
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,419
那你说这是什么呢？
Do you presume to tell us
what is in this stock?

52
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,248
这是老鼠屎
什么
- It's a rat turd.
- A what?

53
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:47,417
老鼠屎
A rat turd.

54
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,966
刺山柑！
老鼠屎！

刺山柑！
A caper!

56
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:55,594
如果这是刺山柑
If it's a caper,

57
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:57,763
吃吃看
eat it.

58
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:07,349
我要吊销你的执照 亨利
I'm gonna bring you up
for permit revocation, Henri.

59
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,888
你做的这些烂东西可值不了这么多钱
You're charging way too much
to be serving crap like that in here.

60
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:16,146
但是 先生 这是意外 你知道我们有多小心的
But, Monsieur, it is an accident.
You know how careful we are.

61
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:11,977
你好？

不 你好马修
- Wake you up?
- No. Hi, Matthew.

64

哦 不！
- They busted the window of my car.
- Oh, no!

65
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:21,353
用一瓶就砸的-连好酒都舍不得用
Threw a bottle of wine at it -
not even good wine.

66
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:24,522
勇士队赢了 我想你们全家都很高兴吧
The Warriors won,
so I guess your household's happy.

67
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:26,062

哦 什么都没干

Stop! Matthew... stop. I'm not coming in 
before 8 o'clock in the morning!

73
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,915
我必须要给减税听证会点压力
- I gotta force the abatement hearing.

74
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:48,204

How long have you been up?

83
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:44,243
没多久
Not long.

84
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:47,452
你在干什么呢？
What are you doing?

85
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:50,411
杰弗里？
Geoffrey?

86
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,358
我要罚死他们（法国餐馆） 
这些扇贝是拿切碎的鳐鱼片冒充的
I wanna throw the book at him. Those
scallops are just cut-up pieces of skate.

87
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:55,238
抱歉 我这就开始测试
I'm sorry. I can start the tests right away.

88
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:58,246
没什么 这些土豆好像有点不对劲
It's OK...And something's wrong with the potato.

89
00:14:58,376 --> 00:15:01,454
酸奶油也是假的 还有这些韭黄
Either the sour cream is phoney,
or the chives.

90
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:04,034
对不起 我没有睡过头 都怪杰弗里
I'm sorry. I got up on time.
It was Geoffrey.

91
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:09,042
这次那个疯牙医有怎么了？
我不知道 他就是很怪
- What did the mad dentist do this time?
- I don't know. He was just weird.

92
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:11,712
他是疯子 牙医都是疯子
He's crazy. All dentists are crazy.

93
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:14,711
你晚了吗？
没有
- Are you late?
- No.

94
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,959
他并不是平时的那种古怪
He was weird not the way he usually is.

95
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,579
那肯定是好现象
That can only be an improvement.

96
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:25,677
这个 不是 这让我很紧张
Well, it's not. It's got me really nervous.

97
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:27,846
告诉他如果不理发就滚出去
Tell him to shape up or get out.

98
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:31,014
这是他的家
让他自己选
- It's his house.
- Make him an offer.

99
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:34,183
你看到这个一定会高兴的
是什么？
- Here's something that'll cheer you up.
- What?

100
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:36,313
这么近还看不见吗？
Ever seen one of these up close?

101
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:38,602
这是什么？
你看像什么？
- What is it?
- What does it look like?

102
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:40,231
刺山柑吗？
是刺山柑吗？
- A caper?
- A caper?

103
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:41,521
到底是什么？
What is it?

104
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:44,729
是老鼠屎 但是这汤汁味道还不坏
我帮你捉了只老鼠
- A rat turd, but the sauce was delicious.
- I got you a rat.

105
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,898
你抓到了吗？
我真抓住了 是个大家伙
- Did you find one?
- I've got it. It was a biggie.

106
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,317
这样我们就可以公布他的卫生不良问题了
OK, we'll get a declaration
of "unsanitary" on him.

107
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,197
我们一会再谈好吗？
好的
- I'll talk to you later, OK?
- OK.

108
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,616
还有什么我能效劳的？
没有了 别担心 去吧
- What can I do?
- Nothing. Don't worry. Go on.

109
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,785
抱歉
I'm sorry.

110
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,284
哦 对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:21,627
嗨 说吧 告诉我今天要干些什么
我知道今天的计划
- Hey, come on. Tell me what I've done.
- I understand today's plan.

112
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:25,175
事出突然 伊莉莎白 我还得再出去一趟
Something's come up, Elizabeth.
I have to go back out again.

113
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:27,345
现在吗？我们不去看比赛吗？
Now? Weren't we going to the game?

114
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:29,844
我把票都给了一位病人
The Warriors.
I gave the tickets to a patient.

115
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:32,343
你今晚不去看比赛了吗？
You're not gonna see tonight's game?

116
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:34,012
没办法
No choice.

117
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:36,852
杰弗里 你到底怎么了？
Geoffrey, what is the matter with you?

118
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:39,431
我没事 只是要去开会
I'm fine. I just have to go to a meeting.

119
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:41,810
开会？开哪门子会？
Meeting? What kind of a meeting?

120
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,938
伊莉莎白 我想我不需要什么事都跟你汇报吧
Elizabeth, I don't think
I have to justify my every move to you.

121
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:48,857
杰弗里 这可不像你的风格
Geoffrey, this isn't like you.

122
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:52,646
别这样 我只是关心你而已
Please, come on. I just want it to be nice...

123
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,725
伊莉莎白 你是怎么回事？
Elizabeth, what's the matter with you?

124
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,944
没什么
Nothing.

125
00:17:34,142 --> 00:17:36,181
请进！
Come in!

126
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,010

还好吗？
How you doing?

128
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,934
疯子是不会感觉到自己发疯的 是吗？
Is it true that if you think
you're losing your mind, you're not?

129
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,773
我希望是这样
Well, I hope so.

130
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,151
我知道这听起来有点荒唐
I know this is gonna sound insane.

131
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,900
什么？
What?

132
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,738
杰弗里不是杰弗里
Geoffrey is not Geoffrey.

133
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:13,278
你怎么知道？
我就是知道
- How do you know?
- I know.

134
00:18:14,418 --> 00:18:17,496
表面上看 杰弗里还是杰弗里
On the outside Geoffrey is still Geoffrey,

135
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:20,914
但是 我能感觉到他跟原来不一样了
but on the inside
I can tell there is something different.

136
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,874
有些东西消失了
Something is missing.

137
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:26,043
是什么？
没有七情六欲 
- What?
- Emotion, feelings.

138
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:28,382
他已经不是原来的他了
He's just not the same person.

139
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,969
真的 你知道我的意思吗？我知道这听着有点疯狂
Really, you know what I mean?
I know it sounds crazy.

140
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,588
是的 我知道你的意思 我想我知道 吃饭没？
Yeah. I know what you mean, I think.
Have you eaten?

141
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:40,968
我不饿
吃点芹菜吧
- I'm not hungry.
- Have some celery.

142
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:42,967
我不…
张嘴 张嘴 张嘴
- I'm not...
- Eat, eat, eat.

143
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:48,396
我们可以在外面吃 今天月色不错
We can eat outside. It's a beautiful night.

144
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:52,944
拿着那块肉 好吗？ 切一下
Take that meat there, will you?
Chop it up.

145
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:56,352
还有把姜递给我 就在那儿 已经切好的那些
And hand me the ginger,
the stuff that's chopped up there.

146
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:09,817
还有呢 这真的很怪
You wanna know something else?
This is really weird.

147
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:16,405
我去过他姐姐诺拉那儿 我想跟她说这些事
I went to see his sister Nora to talk to her about it.

148
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:20,124
但是我开不了口 我忍住了
But I couldn't. I stopped myself.

149
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,083
她也变了吗？
She changed, too?

150
00:19:22,844 --> 00:19:25,043
你觉得我疯了吗？
怎么会
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.

151
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:29,381
你想去看看我的老伙计戴维金博纳
D'you wanna go see my friend David Kibner?

152
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:32,960
那个精神病学家吗？
不是看病
- The psychiatrist?
- Not like that.

153
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,719
跟他说说 他会给你指点迷津的
Talk to him. He would put things into perspective.

154
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:39,678
我没疯
不不不 我是认真的
- I'm not crazy.
- No, no, no. I'm serious.

155
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:44,846
他会结束这一切 不管杰弗里是在外偷情还是玩断臂
He would eliminate whether Geoffrey 
was having an affair, or had become gay.

156
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:49,844
或者是他染上性病 即使他加入了共和党
Whether he had a social disease,or had become a Republican.

157
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:54,312
任何让你感到他不同以往的事
All the things that could have happened
to have made you feel he had changed.

158
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:57,390
知道我的意思吗？要不要去见见他？
D'you know what I mean?
You wanna go see him?

159
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:01,440
你把我当疯子
You think I'm nuts.

160
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,359
不 没有 你的眼睛还会那样转吗？
No, I don't.
Can you still do the thing with your eyes?

161
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:10,526
如果你没疯 那你就转给我看
If you're not crazy,
you can do that thing with your eyes.

162
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:21,702
你没疯
You're not crazy.

163
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,872
真好吃
This is delicious.

164
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:25,911
你厨艺不错
You're a great cook.

165
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:28,290
杰弗里什么时候回来？
What time is Geoffrey getting back?

166
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,999
他说不用等他了
He said not to wait up for him.

167
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:35,418
你还想再来点酒吗？
D'you want some more wine?

168
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,857
早安！
你好
- Morning!
- Hello.

169
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:10,235
一件 二件 藤太太 这个上面有一块咖啡渍
One, two... Mrs Teng,
this one's got a coffee stain on it.

170
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:13,274
这里
Here.

171
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:17,183
那不是咖啡
这是咖啡 我自己弄上去的
- That's not coffee.
- That is coffee. I put it there myself.

172
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:21,452
可能洗不掉了
Maybe not come out.

173
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:25,330
你是医生 对吗？
You doctor, right?

174
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,199
我？不是 我是卫生署的公务员
Me? No. Health Department. Civil servant.

175
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:33,287
你要看医生吗？
Do you need a doctor?

176
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,537
我老婆…病了
My wife... sick.

177
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:39,455
她怎么了？
她不对
- What's wrong with her?
- She wrong.

178
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:43,883
她不对劲吗？
她不是我老婆了
- She's not right?
- That not my wife.

179
00:21:44,224 --> 00:21:46,253
你是说她……？
You mean, she's...?

180
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,762
不 不 不一样了
No, no. Different.

181
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:55,220
她不再是我老婆
That not my wife!

182
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,619
最近怎么样？哈利？
How you doin', Harry?

183
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:27,828
嗨 小家伙 最近怎么样？
Hey, pooch. How you doin', boy?

184
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:16,641
你去哪了？我都急疯了 到处都找不到你
Where you been? You've been driving me
crazy. I've been looking all over for you.

185
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:18,320
怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

186
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,149
没事吗？
You all right?

187
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,827
说话呀 伊丽莎白
Talk to me, Elizabeth.

188
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:04,054
这些人到处都是
I keep seeing these people

189
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:06,893
他们互相都认识
all recognising each other.

190
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:09,563
他们在互相传着些什么
Something was passing between them all.

191
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:11,722
秘密
Some secret.

192
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:17,270
这是一个阴谋 我知道
It's a conspiracy. I know it.

193
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,109
哪有什么阴谋
There can't be a conspiracy.

194
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:23,357
马修 告诉你 这里正在发生着什么事
Matthew, I'm telling you, something's going on here.

195
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:25,527
一些让我害怕的事
Something that scares me.

196
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:28,226
我今天想去看杰弗里 想跟他谈谈
I tried to see Geoffrey today,
to talk to him.

197
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,975
他一上午都在自己的办公室里
He's always in his office in the morning.

198
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:14,350
这真的很怪
It really was weird.

199
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,189
杰弗里跟各种奇怪的人会面
Geoffrey was meeting all sorts of strange people.

200
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:19,478
互相间传递着什么
Things were being passed between them.

201
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,526
这些人你全都不认识吗？
我都不认识
- None were people you knew?
- I didn't know any of them.

202
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:25,226
说不定他们都是杰弗里的病人呢
Maybe they were patients of Geoffrey's.

203
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:28,274
哦 不 不 马修 我知道他们不是病人
Oh, no, no, Matthew. I know they weren't.

204
00:25:28,415 --> 00:25:31,323
我跟着他从镇子的这边跟到那边
I followed him from one end of town to the other,

205
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:35,822
他走到哪里都要跟这种怪人碰面
and everywhere he went he had these meetings with strange people.

206
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:50,586
我感觉这样跟踪监视他傻透了
I felt so stupid sneaking around spying on him,

207
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,546
但是我不能跟他说上话 我又能干什么呢？
but I can't talk to him. What can I do?

208
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:00,673
好吧 金博纳应该能够解释一些事
OK. Well, Kibner will be able
to explain something.

209
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:02,963
我不需要精神病学家
I don't need a psychiatrist.

210
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,472
忘掉他是精神病学家
Just forget that he's a psychiatrist.

211
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:08,800
把他当作一个智者 这才是他
Just think of him as an intelligent man, which is what he is.

212
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:12,559
只是一个读书会 他是名人 非常有名
It's a book party. He's a celebrity.He's very famous.

213
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:16,017
只要你能忘掉他是精神病学家 你一定会喜欢他的
And you will like him,if you forget that he's a psychiatrist.

214
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:19,097
我不知道 我不知道
I don't know... I don't know.

215
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:22,016
马修 我一直住在这里
Matthew, I've lived in this city all my life,

216
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:25,734
但是今天不知怎么的 我感觉所有东西都不对劲
but somehow today I felt everything had changed.

217
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:29,063
人都不一样了 不光是杰弗里 是所有人
People were different. Notjust Geoffrey, but everybody.

218
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:32,192
昨天一切看着都还没挺好的
Yesterday it all seemed normal.

219
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,821
今天虽然表面上看没什么变化 但是实际并不是这样的
Today everything seemed the same, but it wasn't.

220
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:37,990
这简直是个噩梦
It was a nightmare.

221
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,909
让人直冒冷汗
It really became frightening.

222
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:46,157
就好象一夜之间整个城都变了
It was like the whole city had changed overnight.

223
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:03,171
我跟你说过一个英国骆驼军团的故事吗?说过吗?
Did I ever tell you the one
about the English Camel Corps? Did l?

224
00:27:04,511 --> 00:27:07,669
他们困在沙漠里 在撒哈拉
They're trapped in the desert,
in the Sahara desert.

225
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,258
他们被隆美尔包围了40天 吃的没有了
They've been surrounded by Rommel
for 40 days and they've run out of food.

226
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,726
然后统帅赶来对他们做了一个演说
And the captain comes and makes an announcement to the men.

227
00:27:17,857 --> 00:27:19,476
他说
He says,

228
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:24,394
伙计们 我有一个好消息和一个坏消息
"Men, I have some good news and some bad news for you."

229
00:27:24,654 --> 00:27:27,353
一个人说
等等 你跟我说过这个故事
- One of the men says...
- Wait. You have told me this.

230
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:33,691
我能再说一遍吗?
Can I tell it to you again?

231
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:35,820
小心!
Look out!

232
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,609
哦 天啊!锁上门!
Oh, my God! Lock the door!

233
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,779
他们来了!
我们该帮帮他
- They're coming!
- We should help.

234
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:42,947
救命!救命! 他们来了 他们来了 听啊!
Help! Help! They're coming. They're coming. Listen!

235
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,697
他都吓出屎来了
他真让人害怕
- He's smashed out of his skull.
- He's terrified.

236
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:49,075
下一个就是你 求求你!求求你!你就是下一个 我们危在旦夕
You're next. Please! Please!You're next. We're in danger!

237
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:51,115
听我说... 发生了很可怕的事
Listen to me... Something terrible!

238
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,453
求你了 下一个就是你 他们就在这里 他们已经来了!
Please. You're next!Here they are. They're already here!

239
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:56,083
救命!下一个就是你!
Help! You're next!

240
00:27:56,213 --> 00:28:00,151
他们来了 他们来了
他一定是做了什么
- They're coming. They're coming...
- He must have done something.

241
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,699
警察会帮他的
The policeman'll help.

242
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,819
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

243
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,938
可怜的人 他刚才说的什么意思？
That poor man.What was he talking about?

244
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:43,486
到了书店我就打电话把我看到的一切告诉警察
I'll phone a witness report in from the bookstore.

245
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:48,034
马修 你在这儿太好了!这些人都快把我折磨疯了!
Matthew, thank God you're here! These people are driving me nuts.

246
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:50,244
我们一起吃晚饭吗?
不 我不能
- Are we gonna have dinner?
- No, I can't.

247
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:52,453
这儿有电话吗?
在角落里
- Is there a phone?
- Around the corner.

248
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:56,331
这是伊丽莎白・德里斯科尔 这是杰克・伯利克
这就是那个伊丽莎白吗？
- Elizabeth Driscoll, Jack Bellicec.
- This is the Elizabeth?

249
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:58,791
这书太烂了 金博纳的书太烂了
The book is awful. Kibner's book is awful.

250
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:01,540
他的构思一文不值 一文不值
His ideas are garbage. Pure garbage.

251
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,459
你怎么能这么说一个像金博纳这样的人呢？
How can you say that about a man like Kibner?

252
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:07,338
我不是说像金博纳的人 我就是在说金博纳
Not a man like Kibner. I'm saying it about Kibner.

253
00:29:07,468 --> 00:29:11,666
他每半年就赶出一部书来 我要用半年才能写出一行了
He dashes a book off every six months.
Takes me six months to write one line.

254
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:14,586
为什么？
因为我字斟句酌
- Why?
- Cos I pick each word individually.

255
00:29:14,726 --> 00:29:18,304
这有什么可炫的？
我又没有跟你说话 不是吗？
- What's so hot about that?
- I wasn't even talking to you, was l?

256
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:20,833
在莱文沃思街和…
On the corner of Leavenworth and...

257
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:22,973
特克街
特克街吗？特克街交汇出
- Turk.
- Turk? Turk.

258
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:25,432
那是他吗？
Is that him?

259
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:27,851
是的
Yes.

260
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:29,510
是的！
Yes!

261
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,768
哪有什么好炫的？有什么好炫的？ 我不知道…
"What's so hot about that?
What's so hot about that?" I don't know...

262
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:38,677
你们应该有记录的 因为那里有一位骑摩托的警官在现场
You must have a report on it
cos there was a motorcycle officer there

263
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:41,146
还有一辆救护车赶过去
他们跟不上我的思维
- and an ambulance on the way.
- They follow me.

264
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:44,855
他们不理解我
你不用向他们证明什么
- They don't understand me.
- You don't have to prove yourself to them.

265
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:47,524
你说的轻巧
当然 我亲眼所见
- That's easy for you to say.
- Of course I saw it.

266
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:51,352
那个人顺着马路跑
这是浪漫和伤感的
- The man was running down the street.
- It's romantic, sentimental,

267
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:54,451
他趴在我的车上
后工业化的胡扯
- He landed on my car.
- post-industrial nonsense.

268
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:57,061
等一下 我正在跟警察通话呢
Just a second. I'm talking to the police.

269
00:29:57,211 --> 00:30:00,579
不 他的血流了一地
有什么麻烦吗？
- No, he was bleeding on the road.
- What seems to be the trouble?

270
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,899
在吗？是的
Hello? Yeah.

271
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:04,208
别把名字告诉警察
Don't ever give your name to cops.

272
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:06,818
莱文沃思街跟塔克街路口 我等着
Leavenworth and Turk. I'll hold.

273
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:09,127
但是他不是我的丈夫了
But he isn't my husband!

274
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:11,876
他只是看着像而已 他是冒充的！
It's someone who looks like him.He's an impostor!

275
00:30:12,016 --> 00:30:15,784
好了 凯瑟琳 他就是你丈夫 你我都认识他
Now, Katherine, he's your husband.You know him and I know him.

276
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:20,673
直到今天我才发现 因为他脖子后有一道疤
I had to wait until today cos he has a scar on the back of his neck

277
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:23,292
他头发长的时候看不见
and when his hair is long you can't see it.

278
00:30:23,442 --> 00:30:26,890
他今天去理发…
疤不在了
- He went to have a haircut today...
- And the scar was gone.

279
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:29,930
不 疤还在！
No! It's still there!

280
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,558
当然还在那了 你说呢？他还是泰德
Of course it's still there.
What did you expect? He's still Ted.

281
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:37,896
抱歉 我能说句话吗？
别这样！他仍然是你丈夫
- Excuse me, can I say one thing?
- Please! He's still your husband Ted.

282
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:40,016
我知道一些事…
凯瑟琳？
- I know something...
- Katherine?

283
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:41,975
我能说句话吗？
凯瑟琳？
- Could I say one thing?
- Katherine!

284
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:43,485
稍等
Just a minute.

285
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:45,944
凯瑟琳
给我一分钟就好 行吗？
- Katherine.
- Just give me a minute, will you?

286
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:48,233
你相信我吗？
Will you trust me?

287
00:30:48,373 --> 00:30:51,531
相信我好吗？行吗？
Will you please trust me? Will you?

288
00:30:51,662 --> 00:30:54,900
我是公务员 这是一种爱国的表现
I work for the county.This is a public-spirited gesture.

289
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:58,529
我会告诉你我的名字……
金博纳想让人适应世界
- I will give you my name...
- Kibner wants people to fit the world.

290
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,409
我想要报告这个
我想要世界适应人
- I wanna report this.
- I want the world to fit people.

291
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:04,867
我们待会儿再说这些
荷马（诗人）哪儿去了？卡赞扎基斯（小说家）哪儿去了？
- We'll talk about this later.
- Where's Homer? Or Kazantzakis?

292
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:07,627
捷克伦敦（小说家）哪儿去了？
伊莎贝拉哪儿去了？
- Where's Jack London?
- Where's Elizabeth?

293
00:31:07,757 --> 00:31:10,995
我害怕！
我理解 我知道
- I'm afraid!
- I understand, I know.

294
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:13,335
我理解 把手给我
I understand. Let me have your hand.

295
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:16,134
凯瑟琳 相信我
他多出色啊！
- Katherine, just trust me.
- Isn't he wonderful?

296
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:18,133
别这样
Come on.

297
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:22,091
那里 这样挺好的 不是吗？我后面是谁？
There. That's not so bad, is it?Who's this behind me?

298
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:24,591
是泰德
这就对了
- It's Ted.
- That's right.

299
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:26,680
坚强点 就这样 坚强点
Hold on. Come on, just hold on.

300
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,668
坚强点 放松点吧
Hold on. Just relax now.

301
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:33,727
你会没事的 感觉好些了吗？
是的 是的
- You gonna be all right? You feel better?
- Yeah. Yes.

302
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,807
你现在想回家了吗？
是的
- You wanna go home now?
- Yes.

303
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:38,895
你们明天能来找我聊聊吗？
拜托了… 明天
- Will you come and see me tomorrow?
- Please... tomorrow.

304
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:41,695
我们把话说透 好吗 我们三个？
Tomorrow we'll all talk. OK? The three of us?

305
00:31:41,825 --> 00:31:43,854
好的 但是我现在最好送她回家了
OK, but I better take her home.

306
00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:46,023
当然 没问题
Yes. It's OK.

307
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:48,192
明天见
好的
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- OK.

308
00:31:48,663 --> 00:31:50,692
好吗？
好的
- All right?
- OK.

309
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,819
谢谢
Thank you.

310
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,278
他们对事故不感兴趣
They don't wanna hear about the accident.

311
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,238
这是个大阴谋
It's a big conspiracy.

312
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,577
什么是阴谋？
所有事
- What's a conspiracy?
- Everything.

313
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,036
让一下
Excuse me.

314
00:32:12,384 --> 00:32:14,833
我知道你想说什么
I understand what you're trying to say.

315
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:18,741
我是公共卫生署的伊丽莎白・德里斯科尔 电话联系
My name is Elizabeth Driscoll,the Public Health Department. Call me.

316
00:32:18,892 --> 00:32:20,921
凯瑟琳！走吧 凯瑟琳
Katherine! Come on, Katherine.

317
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:25,660
那个女人的丈夫不再是他本人了
That woman's husband is not her husband.

318
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,388
我看到过他跟杰弗里在一起 他是他们中的一员 她知道了
I saw him with Geoffrey. He's one of them. She knows about it

319
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:32,506
没人要帮她 
不是这样的 有人帮她（医生接的话）
- and nobody's helping her.
-That's not ture No. Somebody's helping her.

320
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:34,846
我很高兴你听到了 戴维・金博纳会帮她的（英文字幕不太对）
I'm glad you heard that. David, Elizabeth.

321
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,136
我都听了一个星期了 现在都流行起来了
I've heard it all week. It's popular.

322
00:32:37,276 --> 00:32:39,555
什么意思 什么流行起来了？
我刚才想要告诉你
- What's that. what's getting popular?
- I was trying to tell you

323
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:42,514
我也知道有些人……
有些人变了
- that I also know somebody...
- Who's changed.

324
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:45,403
是的
我们去外边谈吧
- Yes.
- Can we go outside and talk about it?

325
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:52,370
上面有一位女士 红头发蓝裙子的 她对你的作品很感兴趣
Listen, there's a lady up top - red hair,
blue dress. She's interested in your work.

326
00:32:57,329 --> 00:33:01,067
我这个星期已经从六位病人哪里听过这个该死的故事了
I've heard the same damn story this week from six patients.

327
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,767
人们正在改变 变得没有人性了
People are changing,becoming less human.

328
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:05,946
这正发生在我们周围
It's happening all around us.

329
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:08,325
这不是我们要说的
That's not what we're talking about.

330
00:33:08,465 --> 00:33:10,994
这跟与我生活的人没有关系
This has nothing to do with the man I live with.

331
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:13,743
这当然有关系了 你没看见吗？
It has everything to do with it. Don't you see?

332
00:33:13,883 --> 00:33:19,031
人们聚散匆匆 因为他们不想负责任
People step in and out of relationships
because they don't want responsibility.

333
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:23,089
所以婚姻都见鬼去了 家庭也支离破碎
That's why marriages are going to hell.
The family unit is shot to hell.

334
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,208
戴维 你没认真听她说
别插嘴！
- David, you're not listening to her.
- Stay out of this!

335
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:28,338
你看 这就是问题所在
You see, that's the point.

336
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:31,037
我正听着呢 但是他觉得我没有听 为什么？
I'm listening,but he doesn't think I am. Why?

337
00:33:31,187 --> 00:33:34,875
因为他不认为我会认真对待
Because he doesn't expect me to bother enough, or to care.

338
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:37,845
伯利克 最后说一遍 停下！
停下什么？！
- Bellicec, for the last time, stop!
- Stop what?!

339
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:40,724
站住了 安静点 闭嘴
杰克！
- Stand still, be quiet, and shut up!
- Jack!

340
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,223
看了我刚才做的事你有什么感想？
How did you feel about what I just did?

341
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:43,932
为什么要进商店？他疯了
Why in the store? He's a nut.

342
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:45,252
你有什么感觉？
How did you feel?

343
00:33:46,072 --> 00:33:48,101
你大概吓到了
You were probably shocked.

344
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:50,720
你想把你的感官封闭起来
You wanted to shut your feelings off,

345
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:56,018
或者骗自己什么都没发生 因为这样你就不用面对了
maybe make believe it wasn't happening
cos then you don't have to deal with it.

346
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:00,237
我想要帮助书店里那个可怜的女人
I wanna deal with that poor woman in the bookstore.

347
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,406
为什么
Why?

348
00:34:02,956 --> 00:34:04,985
你跟她有同感吗？
Do you identify with her?

349
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,364
是的
Yes.

350
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:10,203
好的
OK.

351
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:12,203
来吧
Come on.

352
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:17,041
假如我告诉过你 凯瑟琳正想疏离这段关系
Suppose I were to tell you that Katherine
is trying to escape from a relationship.

353
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:20,040
他正在对她进行治疗
那他就能把我朝墙上推吗？
- He's treating her.
- So why'd he push me against a wall?

354
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,999
她很不安
她看起来不错
- She's upset.
- She looks fine.

355
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,839
她很不安 杰克
我现在看你倒是挺不安的
- She is upset, Jack.
- You look upset to me now.

356
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:28,457
帮我个忙 行吗？ 
当然 什么都行
回家去 一会我会给你打电话
Do me a favour, will ya?
Go home and I'll call you later.

357
00:34:28,597 --> 00:34:31,166
回家 让我们单独呆一会
回家？
- Go home and leave us alone for a bit.
- Go home?

358
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:33,335
行吗？
好的 好的
- OK?
- OK. OK.

359
00:34:33,476 --> 00:34:35,305
谢谢
Thank you.

360
00:34:39,104 --> 00:34:41,433
你正在钻牛角尖
You're jumping to a bizarre conclusion.

361
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:44,971
你的家人正在变成其他人？
That this man you live with
has been replaced by somebody else.

362
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:48,180
这听起来更像是你骗自己相信他变了
Isn't it more likely you want to believe he's changed

363
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:52,059
因为你想要找个借口摆脱他
because you're really looking for an excuse to get out?

364
00:35:02,956 --> 00:35:04,445
我不知道
I don't know.

365
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:06,654
你能在斟酌一下吗？
Will you think about it, please,

366
00:35:06,794 --> 00:35:08,823
在你要采取什么行动之前？
before you make a move?

367
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:12,651
在你跳出来并毁掉你所拥有的一切之前 再想想好吗？
Before you jump and destroy something you have. Will you?

368
00:35:13,752 --> 00:35:15,781
好吗？
Please?

369
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,369
好的
Yeah.

370
00:35:28,967 --> 00:35:30,546
谢谢你
Thank you.

371
00:35:30,676 --> 00:35:33,834
我只是在心里上给她贴了一块创可贴 马修
I just gave her a psychological Band-Aid, Matthew.

372
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:35,964
我应该再多说几句的
I should talk to her some more.

373
00:35:36,104 --> 00:35:39,132
你可以带她来我办公室 明天下午四点左右
You could bring her by my office tomorrow around four.

374
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,172
他到底怎么了？
What's the matter with her?

375
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:45,050
像是有一种导致幻想的流感正在爆发
It's like there's some kind of hallucinatory flu going around.

376
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:48,929
人们在一两天之内就会克服 我能做的就是对症下药
People get over it in a day or two. All I can do is treat the symptoms.

377
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,059
她会没事吗？
She's gonna be OK?

378
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:53,478
睡一宿好觉绝对没有坏处
A good night's sleep wouldn't hurt.

379
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:55,897
这会传染吗？
哦 马修！
- Is it contagious?
- Oh, Matthew!

380
00:35:56,987 --> 00:36:00,815
把她带回到她男朋友那（大夫想歪了）
你误会了
- Take her home to her boyfriend.
- That wasn't what I was thinking.

381
00:36:00,946 --> 00:36:04,354
我刚才是在想 卫生署有没有必要介入调查
I was just wondering if the Health Department should look at it.

382
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:06,523
我不知道谁能给出答案
Who knows? I don't know.

383
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:09,232
我倒是想给出答案
I wish I did.

384
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:11,691
好吧
OK.

385
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:15,160
带她回家 马修
Take her home, Matthew.

386
00:36:38,183 --> 00:36:41,211
啊 杰克 读书会怎么样？
Ah, Jack. How was the book party?

387
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:45,220
那是金博纳的新书吗？
Is that Kibner's new book?

388
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:50,928
没朗诵你的诗吗？
Didn't get to read your poetry?

389
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:54,307
对不起 杰克
I'm sorry, Jack.

390
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:56,686
晚安 这里是伯利克浴室
Good evening. Bellicec Baths.

391
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:02,934
是的 我们建议在卡利斯托加火山灰泥浆中浸泡15分钟
Yes, we recommend the 1 5-minute soak
in Calistoga volcanic ash,

392
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:06,352
水波漩涡浴就是这样的
that's followed by an Aqua-Surge whirlpool dip.

393
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:25,156
嗨 能帮我出来吗？
Hey, can you help me outta here?

394
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:29,205
伯利克！
Bellicec!

395
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:31,414
我跟你说话的 帮把手
I'm talking to you. Give me a hand.

396
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:33,583
帮我出来
Help me outta this thing.

397
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:37,502
斯坦…
Stan...

398
00:37:37,642 --> 00:37:39,631
每周都有你这样的
Every week we go through this.

399
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:43,699
为什么你不能配合一下呢？
给我条毛巾
- Why can't you be more cooperative?
- Get me a towel.

400
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,469
你这样会受伤的
You are really gonna get hurt one of these days.

401
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,718
再给我一条毛巾 好吗？
Give me another towel, would you?

402
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:50,677
别这样
Come on.

403
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,742
南茜 把音乐关了
Nancy, shut the music off.

404
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:07,941
这是给花放的音乐 斯坦
It's for the plants, Stan.

405
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:11,270
去他的花 我讨厌音乐
Screw the plants. I hate the music.

406
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,488
这对我的花很有好处 她们喜欢
It's wonderful for my plants.They just love it.

407
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:18,657
花也有七情六欲的 知道吗 像人一样
Plants have feelings, you know,just like people.

408
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:23,156
这太神了 这种音乐会刺激植物的生长
It's fascinating. This type of music
stimulates the growth of the plants.

409
00:38:23,296 --> 00:38:25,495
这已经被大量实验所证明
They've done tons of experiments on it.

410
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:28,455
拜托了 南茜 把音乐关掉
别紧张
- Come on, Nancy. Turn the music off.
- Relax.

411
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:31,154
太紧张可没法欣赏音乐
You're not gonna enjoy this if you don't.

412
00:39:01,903 --> 00:39:04,931
哦！詹尼先生 你在这儿干什么？
Oh! Mr Gianni, what are you doing here?

413
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:07,391
伯利克太太 一定要读一下
This is must reading, Mrs Bellicec.

414
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:09,810
维利科夫斯基的《冲突中的世界》
Worlds ln Collision by Velikovsky.

415
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,358
哦 当然 我看过很多遍了 你看过《造星人》吗？
Oh, yes. I've read that many times. Have you read Star Maker

416
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:17,067
奥拉夫.斯特普尔顿写的 那个也值得一读
by Olaf Stapledon? That's must reading, too.

417
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:22,615
好了 实在太晚了 詹尼先生
你真是才女
- Well, it's awfully late, Mr Gianni.
- You're so smart.

418
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:25,944
哦 詹尼先生 你在泥浆里坐得太久了
Oh, Mr Gianni, you've been sitting in that mud too long.

419
00:39:26,085 --> 00:39:28,454
说不定有点过头了 知道吗
It is possible to overdo it, you know.

420
00:39:29,214 --> 00:39:33,032
哦 对了 谢谢你上次送我的那盆花
Oh, by the way, thank you for that plant
you gave me last time.

421
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:06,141
我送你进去
I'll walk you inside.

422
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,309
没有必要
You don't have to.

423
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:19,106
杰弗里？
Geoffrey?

424
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,654
他真体贴
That was sweet of him.

425
00:40:43,218 --> 00:40:45,247
你还好吗？
You all right?

426
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,206
明早见
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

427
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:57,462
谢谢 马修 你让我感觉好多了
Thank you, Matthew. You've really made me feel better.

428
00:40:57,603 --> 00:41:00,002
我会考虑金博纳的话的
And I'm gonna think about what Kibner said.

429
00:41:00,142 --> 00:41:01,131
好吧
OK.

430
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:03,181
谢谢你 晚安
Thanks for helping. Goodnight.

431
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:05,350
再见
See you.

432
00:41:11,778 --> 00:41:13,807
杰克？
Jack?

433
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:16,266
宝贝 你在哪？
Honey, where are ya?

434
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:21,524
我不想打断你思考 但是我想去吃中国菜
I don't wanna disturb you if you're
thinking, but I could do with some chinese food.

435
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:24,324
我一天没吃饭了 哦…
I haven't eaten all day. Oh...

436
00:41:27,453 --> 00:41:29,652
哦 杰克 这样会喘不上气的
Oh, Jack, you're gonna suffocate.

437
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,579
我的鼻子…
My nose...

438
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,748
让我离开！让我离开！
Let me out! Let me out!

439
00:41:40,878 --> 00:41:42,617
我鼻子出血了
My nose is bleeding.

440
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:08,308
谁呀？
Who is it?

441
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:11,307
谁呀？
Who is it?

442
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:16,516
是马修
It's Matthew.

443
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:19,055
进来吧
怎么了？
- Come on in.
- What happened?

444
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:20,814
在后边
Back here.

445
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:23,653
我是把你当朋友才叫你来的
哦 杰克…
- Matthew, I called you here as a friend.
- Oh, Jack...

446
00:42:23,783 --> 00:42:28,571
你是不是负责上报传染病或者有关尸体的事？
Do you report things like contagious
disease or a body in a place of business?

447
00:42:28,702 --> 00:42:30,781
杰克 让他看看吧 
你发现了尸体吗？
- Let him look at it. 
- You found a body?

448
00:42:30,911 --> 00:42:33,610
没有 没什么要紧的
我还以为是杰克呢
- No, not necessarily.
- I thought it was Jack.

449
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,279
是他吗？
Is that him?

450
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:38,448
是的 单子下面就是
Yeah, under there.

451
00:42:41,127 --> 00:42:43,696
开什么玩笑？
不是玩笑
- What kind of joke is this?
- It's no joke.

452
00:42:44,336 --> 00:42:46,375
这是什么？
What is it?

453
00:42:54,723 --> 00:42:58,211
这他妈到底是什么？！
别冲动 南茜
- What the hell is it?!
- Just keep calm, Nancy.

454
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:01,760
会传染吗？
Is it contagious?

455
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,259
你的客人看到过吗？
没有
- Did any of your customers see this?
- No.

456
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:05,758
被人看到我们就完了
It'd ruin us.

457
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,008
我去报警
别这样
- I'm calling the police.
- Don't do that.

458
00:43:08,148 --> 00:43:09,507
为什么？
南茜 别
- Why?
- Nancy, don't.

459
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,596
因为我想杰克是对的
Because I think Jack is right.

460
00:43:13,316 --> 00:43:15,515
这绝不是未成熟个体
It's not immature exactly.

461
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:17,394
他有张成年人的脸
He's got an adult face.

462
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:21,433
这是个妖怪 全身都是毛
这不一定
- It's a monster. It's got hair all over it.
- It's vague.

463
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:23,812
鼻子 嘴唇 头发
Nose, lips, hair.

464
00:43:23,953 --> 00:43:27,691
双手 应有尽有 只是还不完善 没有人格 还没成型
Hands, everything,but no detail, no character. It's unformed.

465
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:31,189
杰克 别碰  你不知道这是什么
Jack, don't touch it. You don't know where it's been.

466
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,569
没有呼吸
No respiration.

467
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:36,818
也没有指纹
It's got no fingerprints.

468
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,277
没指纹吗？
No fingerprints?

469
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:43,196
像个胎儿
Like a foetus.

470
00:43:43,336 --> 00:43:45,365
你刚说过这是成年人
You just said it was an adult.

471
00:43:45,505 --> 00:43:48,204
我说是成年人是因为它很高
I said it was an adult because it was tall.

472
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:52,082
你多高 杰克？
六英尺四英寸
- How tall are you, Jack?
- Six foot four.

473
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,421
你有多重？
170磅
- How much do you weigh?
- 170.

474
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,921
问这些干什么？
哦 不要
- Why?
- Oh, no.

475
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,999
不要 马修
No, Matthew.

476
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:04,048
哦 杰克！
Oh, Jack!

477
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:06,798
你给谁打电话？
伊丽莎白
- Who are you calling?
- Elizabeth.

478
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:08,967
为什么？
Why?

479
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,346
为什么打给伊丽莎白？
Why are you calling Elizabeth?

480
00:44:11,476 --> 00:44:13,925
马修…
为什么？
- Matthew...
- Why?

481
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:26,440
喂？
Hello?

482
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:30,479
伊丽莎白吗？能听见吗？我是马修 伊丽莎白 喂
Elizabeth? Can you hear me? It's Matthew, Elizabeth. Hello?

483
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,358
怎么了？
What's the matter?

484
00:44:32,489 --> 00:44:34,888
伊丽莎白 能听见吗？
Elizabeth, can you hear me?

485
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:36,857
你是谁？
Who is this?

486
00:44:38,247 --> 00:44:40,276
喂？
Hello?

487
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:04,087
你去哪儿？
我朋友有麻烦了
- Where are you going?
- A friend of mine is in trouble.

488
00:45:04,218 --> 00:45:06,707
我们该怎么办？
给戴维・金博纳打电话
- What are we to do?
- Phone David Kibner.

489
00:45:06,847 --> 00:45:10,535
让他马上来这儿见我 他的号码
Ask him to meet me here right away. There's his number.

490
00:45:10,686 --> 00:45:12,715
怎么了？
我累了
- What's the matter?
- I'm tired.

491
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:15,514
起来
Stand up.

492
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:19,302
站起来！ 四下走走
宝贝儿 我口渴 我渴死了
- Stand up! Now walk around!
- Honey, I'm dry! I'm very dry.

493
00:45:19,443 --> 00:45:22,182
我给你拿点水来 别睡着
I'll get you a drink. Just don't fall asleep.

494
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:33,437
来 宝贝儿
谢谢 宝贝儿
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks, sweetie.

495
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:35,607
金博纳大夫马上就来
Dr Kibner will be here soon.

496
00:45:39,746 --> 00:45:42,025
我要躺下好好想想 宝贝儿
I'm gonna lie down and think, honey.

497
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:44,534
我就是想点事
I'm just gonna think.

498
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:35,896
杰克 别睡！ 眼睛！
Jack, wake up! lts eyes!

499
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:38,855
哦 杰克 它睁眼了
Oh, Jack. It opened its eyes.

500
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:51,780
看见了吗？
See?

501
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,989
亲爱的？
Hon?

502
00:50:35,524 --> 00:50:36,933
醒醒
Wake up.

503
00:50:37,063 --> 00:50:38,472
醒醒！
Wake up!

504
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,977
我在这儿连个尸体的毛都没看着
I can't find anything in here that looks like a body.

505
00:52:49,108 --> 00:52:50,937
没有尸体？
你说什么！
- No body?
- What!

506
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,896
你查看过最后…
我都找遍了
- Did you check the last...
- I looked everywhere.

507
00:52:54,026 --> 00:52:55,395
嘿！你…… 嘿！
Hey! Did you... Hey!

508
00:52:55,535 --> 00:52:59,303
你查看过左手边最后一个隔间了？
那根本没有尸体
- Did you check the last booth on the left?
- There's no body there.

509
00:52:59,454 --> 00:53:01,483
应该在那儿啊！
It's got to be in here!

510
00:53:04,122 --> 00:53:07,570
它有脉搏、心跳吗?
它睁眼了
- Did it have a pulse, a heartbeat?
- It opened its eyes.

511
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:11,159
你真的看见了吗？
我看到它鼻子出血了
- You actually saw that?
- I saw its nose bleed.

512
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,448
他的白毛还碰到了我的手
It had white hair, that touched my hand.

513
00:53:14,999 --> 00:53:17,038
那儿有东西
There's something in here.

514
00:53:19,837 --> 00:53:23,205
有一次南茜的一位老年顾客死在这儿 他心脏病发作沉下去了
Nancy lost an old guy in here once.
He had a heart attack and sank.

515
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:29,543
面对现实吧 伯利克
Face it, Bellicec.

516
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:32,582
只是你的朋友跟你搞恶作剧而已
You've got some friends who enjoy practical jokes.

517
00:53:32,722 --> 00:53:35,001
我没有朋友 金博纳博士
I don't have any friends, Dr Kibner.

518
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:38,130
那就是你的敌人
Then some enemies.

519
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:39,540
看那儿
Look.

520
00:53:43,439 --> 00:53:45,468
谁打开的？
Who opened this up?

521
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,781
等等 等等 谁呀？
Wait a second, wait a second. Who is it?

522
00:54:15,882 --> 00:54:18,503
马修 尸体消失了
有人弄走了尸体
- Matthew, the body's gone.
- Somebody's took it.

523
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:21,834
不 你没看到吗？
这儿没什么可看的
- No. Did you see it?
- There was nothing here to see.

524
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:24,795
你想吵醒谁 马修？
Who are you waking up now, Matthew?

525
00:54:24,936 --> 00:54:28,217
警察吗？我发现一具尸体
Police? I would like to report a body.

526
00:54:30,738 --> 00:54:32,728
赶快把她带到我那里去
Take her to my place fast.

527
00:54:32,859 --> 00:54:35,730
在我们回来前别让任何人进来
Don't let anybody in until we get back there.

528
00:55:05,913 --> 00:55:08,394
上尉 他们报告说发现一具尸体
Lieutenant, these fellas reported the body.

529
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:11,825
你们都看到了吗？
不 只有我看到 马修・贝纳尔
- You both saw it?
- No, I'm the only one. Matthew Bennell.

530
00:55:11,956 --> 00:55:16,077
贝纳尔先生 带我去看看现场吧
就在上面
- Mr Bennell, show me where you saw it.
- It's right up here.

531
00:55:16,338 --> 00:55:18,378
伊丽莎白在哪儿？
Where's Elizabeth?

532
00:55:32,575 --> 00:55:33,985
在哪儿？
在那儿
- Where?
- There.

533
00:55:34,115 --> 00:55:36,275
那是伊丽莎白的替身
哪里？
- It's Elizabeth's double.
- Where?

534
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,366
只是一堆树叶和一个壶
Lots of leaves and a pot.

535
00:55:38,497 --> 00:55:41,908
原本在这的 戴维 我对天发誓
It was there, David. I swear to God it was there!

536
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:44,870
警官 那是伊丽莎白的复制品
Officer, there was a duplicate of Elizabeth Driscoll,

537
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,250
它被弄走了
那个失踪的女人吗？
- and it's been taken.
- The missing woman?

538
00:55:47,381 --> 00:55:49,251
她没失踪
那她在哪?
- She's not missing.
- Where is she?

539
00:55:49,392 --> 00:55:51,783
她在马修那儿
别说出来
- She's at Matthew's.
- Don't tell him that!

540
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:54,504
那就是说没有什么失踪的尸体了
当然
- Then there is no missing body.
- That's right.

541
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:57,265
有的 被他弄走了！
不 他带走了伊丽莎白
- There is and he's taken it!
- No, he took Elizabeth.

542
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,145
你带走了伊丽莎白？
是的！
- You took Elizabeth away?
- Yes!

543
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:02,317
你破门而入
我必须这样 她在这不安全
- You broke in here.
- I had to because she was not safe here.

544
00:56:02,447 --> 00:56:03,937
这么说你把她从这带走了
So you took her out of here.

545
00:56:04,078 --> 00:56:08,069
不！我把她从这儿带走 她的另一个身体还在这儿
No! I took her from there. Her other body was in here...

546
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,881
别说了 马修 够了 别说了
Please stop. Matthew, that's enough! Please stop!

547
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:14,122
上尉 我是戴维・金博纳博士
哦 那个精神病专家
- Lieutenant, I'm Dr David Kibner.
- Ah, the psychiatrist.

548
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:15,912
我妻子看过你的书 她受益良多
My wife reads your books.

549
00:56:16,053 --> 00:56:18,584
我很荣幸 这听着可能有点复杂
戴维……
- I'm glad. It sounds complicated,...
- David...

550
00:56:18,724 --> 00:56:22,665
…但是我的朋友最近被他的感情所困扰
..but my friend has had some difficult 
emotional experiences recently.

551
00:56:22,806 --> 00:56:26,887
但是我想我们自己私下能处理
But I think this is something
we can work out amongst ourselves.

552
00:56:27,028 --> 00:56:30,719
好的 那我就不管了
感激不尽
- All right, I'll leave this part of it with you.
- I appreciate it.

553
00:56:30,859 --> 00:56:34,070
你不能再在这纠缠下去了 我们出去说
You can't accomplish anything here. We gotta get outside.

554
00:56:35,952 --> 00:56:41,074
我想你可能会考虑起诉贝纳尔非法入侵
I think you might wanna consider filing
an unlawful entry against Mr Bennell.

555
00:56:41,214 --> 00:56:43,534
我知道你要说什么 但是外面……
I know what you're saying, but outside...

556
00:56:43,675 --> 00:56:48,006
不 我相信金博纳教授说的 伊丽莎白没事
No, I'll take Dr Kibner's word that Elizabeth is all right.

557
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:51,178
好吧 我们走吧
好的
- Fine, then let's go.
- OK.

558
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,350
伊丽莎白会回家吗？
Will Elizabeth be coming home?

559
00:56:58,901 --> 00:56:59,891
不
No.

560
00:57:01,413 --> 00:57:03,774
我得给她带几件衣服
I have to pick up some of her clothes.

561
00:57:07,295 --> 00:57:08,035
好吧
All right.

562
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:40,119
好吧 我们退回去再回想一次
All right, let's back up
and go through it once more,

563
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:42,539
慢慢来
step by step.

564
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:47,462
你们都觉得在浴室里看到了尸体
You all thought you saw a body at the baths.

565
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:50,883
你们想它可能已经死了 你们不知道它是什么
You thought it was dead. You didn't know what it was.

566
00:57:53,145 --> 00:57:56,146
你们都接触过它了 所有人
You touched it. All of you touched it.

567
00:57:59,407 --> 00:58:03,738
南茜 你看到它睁开眼睛
它正好盯着我看
- Nancy, you saw it open its eyes.
- It looked right at me.

568
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:09,531
伯利克你也看到它睁眼了
不 我看到它鼻子出血
- And, Bellicec, you saw its eyes open.
- No, I saw its nose bleed.

569
00:58:09,672 --> 00:58:13,003
如果你看到它鼻子出血 南茜看到他睁开眼睛
If you saw its nose bleed, and Nancy saw its eyes open,

570
00:58:13,133 --> 00:58:14,963
那它一定活着
he must have been alive.

571
00:58:17,475 --> 00:58:21,136
不 戴维 你是按照人的标准来判断的 但是它不是人
No, David. You're looking at it
as if it was human. It was not human.

572
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:25,978
马修 那它还能是什么？
不管是什么 绝对不是人
- Matthew, what else would it be?
- It was something, but not human.

573
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:28,359
他身上有白毛 
它一直在生长
- It had white hair on it. 
- It was growing.

574
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:30,070
杰克家里的那个像…
The one at Jack's was...

575
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,861
像杰克 但是没有伊丽莎白家的那个成熟
It was like Jack, but not as developed
as the one at Elizabeth's place.

576
00:58:34,002 --> 00:58:35,822
它还有卷胡子
It had tendrils on it.

577
00:58:35,963 --> 00:58:38,033
她家那个是复制她
The one at her place was duplicating her.

578
00:58:38,174 --> 00:58:40,204
如果马修没有把我带走
If Matthew hadn't taken me away,

579
00:58:40,345 --> 00:58:43,916
发生在杰弗里身上的事  就会在我身上重演
the same thing that's happened
to Geoffrey would have happened to me.

580
00:58:44,056 --> 00:58:48,547
伊丽莎白 能跟我说说 在你印象中 到底发生了什么吗？
Elizabeth, would you please tell me, in
your opinion, exactly what is happening?

581
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,810
大家都被复制了
People are being duplicated.

582
00:58:54,941 --> 00:58:58,312
一旦你被复制 你就变成它的一部分
And once it's happened to you, you're part of this thing.

583
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,443
这差点就发生在我身上！
It almost happened to me!

584
00:59:02,954 --> 00:59:04,444
听着
Look,

585
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:09,657
你不相信伊丽莎白  是因为尸体消失了
the reason you don't believe Elizabeth
is because the other body disappeared.

586
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:12,838
因为被杰弗里弄走了
It disappeared because Geoffrey took it.

587
00:59:12,969 --> 00:59:15,640
好吧 那我的替身都怎么样了？
Well, then what happened to my other body, then?

588
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:18,511
哦 伙计 能听听自己在说什么吗？
Oh, people, will you please listen to yourselves?

589
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:20,801
你们能听听自己在说什么吗？
Will you listen to what you are saying?

590
00:59:20,942 --> 00:59:25,854
我能想象一具尸体被转移  甚至是尸体站起来自己离开
I can deal with a body being moved and
even with a body getting up and leaving,

591
00:59:25,984 --> 00:59:29,765
但是当你说他的另一个身体 
 她的另一个身体 被复制…
but when you start talking about his other 
body,her other body, being duplicated...

592
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:31,606
知道这到底有多荒谬吗？
Listen to how that sounds.

593
00:59:31,747 --> 00:59:35,198
我们知道这听起来有多疯狂！但是你觉得我们现在在干什么？
We know how insane this sounds!
But what do you think we're doing?

594
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:36,800
你觉得我们编造了一切吗？
Do you think we're making it up?

594
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:37,628
你到底是哪里听不懂


595
00:59:37,629 --> 00:59:41,920
你相信我的替身看起来像我 她的替身看起来象她吗？
Do you believe that my body looked like
me and that her body looked like her?

596
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:43,711
你觉得我们疯了吗？
D'you think we're crazy?

597
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:48,980
你为什么想说服我们  这只是我们想象出来的？
You are trying to make us believe
that we are seeing things. Why?

598
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:51,345
我只是想要帮忙
All I'm trying to do is help.

599
00:59:51,485 --> 00:59:55,686
你半夜打电话给我 找我帮忙 我就是来帮忙的
You call me in the middle of the night and
ask me to help. That's all I'm trying to do.

600
00:59:55,827 --> 00:59:57,817
好吧 如果我们吵醒了你 那么对不起
Well, I'm sorry if we woke you up!

601
00:59:57,948 --> 01:00:01,279
如果我们打搅你了 那我们很抱歉
If we inconvenienced you, I guess we owe you an apology.

602
01:00:01,419 --> 01:00:04,780
我是说… 我想这么做很不好！
I mean, I mean... I guess that's a rotten thing to do!

603
01:00:06,592 --> 01:00:08,622
但是你也把我太太搅得心神不宁
You've upset my wife, too.

604
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:17,926
戴维 我不知道它是什么 或者它从哪来
David, I don't know what it is or where it comes from,

605
01:00:18,066 --> 01:00:20,096
但是我看到了  而且我要给它点颜色
but I saw it and I'm gonna fight it.

606
01:00:20,237 --> 01:00:23,518
马修 老伙计 我相信你
Matthew, my friend,... I believe you.

607
01:00:24,949 --> 01:00:27,480
我们认识这么久 让我怎么能不相信你呢
I've known you too long not to believe you.

608
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:29,651
你想怎么做？
What do you wanna do?

609
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:34,112
如果我能得到官方的支持 我得启动应急预案
Well, if I could get official support,
I'd institute the emergency procedures

610
01:00:34,253 --> 01:00:37,034
就是我们针对疟疾和军团热所制定的预案
that we use for cholera or legionnaires' disease.

611
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:41,006
你想要我做什么？
我想我能搞定健康署
- What do you want me to do?
- I can handle the Health Department.

612
01:00:41,136 --> 01:00:44,627
但是如果引起恐慌  我们需要警察和保安
But if panic breaks out, we'll need the police and the Guard,

613
01:00:44,768 --> 01:00:46,928
就是说市长
and that means the Mayor and...

614
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:50,510
市长在你那看病 是吗？
The Mayor's a patient of yours, isn't he?

615
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,311
你怎么知道的？
How did you know that?

616
01:00:54,242 --> 01:00:56,272
你想要我做什么？
What do you want me to do?

617
01:00:56,413 --> 01:00:58,864
你能说服他接我的电话吗？
Would you ask him to accept my telephone call?

618
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:01,365
我会在一个小时内给他打电话 我在办公室
I'll call him in a hour. I'll be at my office.

619
01:01:01,505 --> 01:01:04,066
如果你有其他主意 随时跟我联系
If you have any other ideas, get in touch.

620
01:01:06,547 --> 01:01:08,587
我等你电话
Call me.

621
01:01:09,889 --> 01:01:11,919
谢谢
Thank you.

622
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,380
速战速决
The sooner the better.

623
01:01:42,062 --> 01:01:43,842
真好闻
This smells lovely.

624
01:01:43,973 --> 01:01:47,184
我想要你听我说
我听着呢 南茜
- I want you to listen to me.
- I am listening to you, Nancy.

625
01:01:47,315 --> 01:01:51,006
我没有看错  我知道我看见的是什么
I am not seeing things. I know I saw what I saw

626
01:01:51,156 --> 01:01:55,017
我也知道那东西正变成你  杰克  现在我们发现的尸体…
and I know it was turning into you, Jack.
Now, that body we found...

627
01:01:55,158 --> 01:01:57,488
这花是从哪摘的？
That flower. Where did you get that?

628
01:01:57,619 --> 01:02:00,700
花瓶里
是夹在花中间吗
- In the vase with the others.
- Just stuck in there?

629
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:04,201
是 怎么了？
杰弗里昨晚也给了我一支这样的
- Yeah. Why?
- Geoffrey gave me one last night.

630
01:02:04,342 --> 01:02:05,332
那又怎样
So what?

631
01:02:05,462 --> 01:02:08,503
是一个顾客  詹尼先生带过来的花
A customer, Mr Gianni, brought one of those to the baths.

632
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:09,504
然后呢？
So what?

633
01:02:09,634 --> 01:02:12,635
快放下 杰克
只是一个豆荚开的花而已
- Put it down, Jack.
- It's a pod with a flower on it.

634
01:02:12,765 --> 01:02:16,516
我在任何书里都查不到这种花
杰克 快放下
- I could not find that flower in any book.
- Jack, put it down.

635
01:02:16,647 --> 01:02:20,308
只是一朵花而已 亲爱的
可能会有毒
- It's a pink flower, honey.
- It could be toxic.

636
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:24,610
四处都有这种花  像寄生虫一样长在其他植物上
I have seen these flowers all over.
They grow like parasites on other plants.

637
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,991
它们从哪来？
外太空
- Where are they coming from?
- Outer space.

638
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:29,493
它们不是从外太空来的
为什么不是？
- They're not from outer space.
- Why not?

639
01:02:29,623 --> 01:02:31,113
它们就是不是
为什么？！
- They're not.
- Why?!

640
01:02:31,253 --> 01:02:33,493
你胡说什么？太空花？
What are you talking about? A space flower?

641
01:02:34,675 --> 01:02:38,336
为什么不是太空花？谁规定外星人一定会做金属战舰？
Why not a space flower? Why do we always expect metal ships?

642
01:02:38,476 --> 01:02:40,716
我从来没提起过金属战舰
I've never expected metal ships.

643
01:02:40,847 --> 01:02:43,418
它们一定是从其他途径进入我们的系统
There must be other ways they get in our systems.

644
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,930
对 它们可能通过接触或者香味  来进入我们的身体
Right. They could be getting into us through touch or fragrance.

645
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:50,641
到处都是麻烦 我们甚至还没来得及注意它们  
We would never even notice it,
not from the impurities we have.

646
01:02:50,782 --> 01:02:53,483
我是说 我们吃的东西呼吸的空气都是垃圾
I mean, we eat junk and we breathe junk.

647
01:02:53,623 --> 01:02:58,445
我不知道它们从哪来 但是我感觉像是我被下毒了
I don't know where they're coming from,
but I feel as though I've been poisoned.

648
01:02:58,585 --> 01:03:01,786
我们要把这些花带回实验室化验
We've gotta take those flowers in and have them analysed.

649
01:03:01,926 --> 01:03:04,877
现在有一些东西
能进入我们的身体
- There's something here.
- They could get into us

650
01:03:05,008 --> 01:03:09,049
然后打乱我们的遗传基因 再重新组合 改变我们
and screw up our genes like DNA, recombine us, change us.

651
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,670
哦 就是这样！
Oh, of course!

652
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:13,891
跟几年前着陆的那些火箭一样
This is the same way those rockets landed thousands years ago,

653
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:18,313
这样这些太空人就能通过跟猴子交配来创造人类
so those spacemen could mate with 
monkeys and create the human race.

654
01:03:18,443 --> 01:03:20,643
现在就是这样！
It's happening now!

655
01:03:30,759 --> 01:03:34,120
你找谁？
戴维・金博纳
- Who do you wish to speak to?
- David Kibner.

656
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:37,041
他不在 下午才会回来 
He's not in right now. He'll be back this afternoon.

657
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:42,013
能给他留言吗？我是马修・贝纳尔
Could you leave a message for him?
Matthew Bennell. B-E-N-N-E-L-L.

658
01:03:42,144 --> 01:03:45,975
你电话是多少？
不用 他知道我电话
- And your number, please?
- No, he's got my number. Thank you.

659
01:03:52,828 --> 01:03:55,499
我是詹姆斯・卓拉 副检察长 什么事？
James Grala, Deputy City Attorney. Can I help you?

660
01:03:55,619 --> 01:03:57,239
我是马修・贝纳尔
My name is Matthew Bennell.

661
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:00,991
我是公共卫生署的代理调查员
B-E-N-N-E-L-L. I'm a deputy public health inspector.

662
01:04:01,132 --> 01:04:04,253
你也要报告“冒充者”的事吗？
是的
- Is this another call about impostors?
- Yes.

663
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,583
你还跟别的部门说过吗？
没有
- We're the first agency you called?
- Yes.

664
01:04:06,724 --> 01:04:09,675
很好 听着 贝纳尔先生 我们不想引起恐慌
Good. Listen, Mr Bennell, we don't wanna create a panic.

665
01:04:09,815 --> 01:04:11,595
这边没人知道
No-one here knows.

666
01:04:11,726 --> 01:04:14,217
我想让你暂时先呆在你的电话旁
I'd like you to stay by yourphone for a while.

667
01:04:14,357 --> 01:04:17,438
我这就找人给你回电话 记下你说知道的一切
I'll have somebody call you back
and take down all you know.

668
01:04:17,569 --> 01:04:19,399
好的 谢谢你
All right, thank you.

669
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:24,691
实验室够忙的了 伊丽莎白 我们不化验花
This is a busy lab, Elizabeth. We don't test flowers.

670
01:04:24,832 --> 01:04:28,163
那是农业部的事
我知道
- They go to the Depart of Agriculture.
- I know where they go!

671
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:32,084
我想这应该是我们的责任 我想这个会影响到人
I think this is our problem. I think it is affecting people.

672
01:04:32,465 --> 01:04:34,205
怎么影响？
How?

673
01:04:36,477 --> 01:04:39,928
听着 艾伦 我已经说过了 我自己化验
Look, Allen, I have already said that I'll do all the testing.

674
01:04:40,058 --> 01:04:42,429
你不用伸一跟手指  好吗？
You don't have to lift a finger. Can l?

675
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,561
你总是迟到 伊丽莎白 你的工作已经落下不少了
You've been consistently late, Elizabeth, and you're behind in your work,

676
01:04:47,702 --> 01:04:49,732
所以 还是我来帮你化验吧
so I'll do the tests for you.

677
01:04:50,823 --> 01:04:52,573
谢谢
Thank you.

678
01:04:52,704 --> 01:04:55,785
给我48小时
艾伦 只有24小时
- It'll take 48 hours.
- Allen, 24.

679
01:04:57,046 --> 01:05:01,748
我不明白你为什么要对这朵小小的花大动干戈
I can't understand why you've become so emotional about a little flower.

680
01:05:05,889 --> 01:05:06,879
你好
Hello.

681
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,210
贝纳尔先生吗？
是的
- Mr Bennell?
- Yes.

682
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:10,340
健康署的？
是的
- From the Health Department?
- Yes.

683
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:13,562
我是泰德・杰索普 市长特别助理
嗯
- It's Ted Jessop, the Mayor's special assistant.
- Yes.

684
01:05:13,693 --> 01:05:16,604
你遇到了奇怪的事？
是
- You've come across something strange?
- Yes.

685
01:05:16,744 --> 01:05:19,305
我们最好在联合广场面谈
I'd like to suggest we meet in Union Square.

686
01:05:19,455 --> 01:05:22,316
我们不能在电话里讲
这就去
- We can't talk over the phone.
- Right away.

687
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,288
那么 明天你还会跟我在这里碰头吗？贝纳尔先生
So you'll meet me here again tomorrow,Mr Bennell?

688
01:05:27,419 --> 01:05:28,289
好的
Yeah.

689
01:05:28,419 --> 01:05:30,619
不要跟别人讲 保密
Don't say a word to anyone. Keep it quiet.

690
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,790
听你的
Whatever you say.

691
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:42,304
请投15美分
接线员 我已经投了25美分了
- Please deposit 15 cents.
- Operator, I put in a quarter...

692
01:05:44,986 --> 01:05:48,067
我是朱迪・汉克耳  市长特别助理
This is Judy Hinkell, the Mayor's special assistant.

693
01:05:48,197 --> 01:05:50,487
你好 我是马修・贝纳尔
Yes. My name is Matthew Bennell.

694
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:52,488
市长正在开会
The Mayor's in conference,

695
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:56,280
但是金博纳博士给他打电话说了一些他的担心
but Dr Kibner called him personally to express his concern.

696
01:05:56,421 --> 01:05:58,041
贝纳尔先生
And, Mr Bennell,

697
01:05:58,172 --> 01:06:02,713
我们想听听你的意见  因为情况好像正在好转
we're asking for your discretion
because this thing might be abating.

698
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:06,635
喂？
Hello?

699
01:06:06,765 --> 01:06:08,345
马修・贝纳尔？
是我
- Matthew Bennell?
- Yes.

700
01:06:08,476 --> 01:06:11,557
我是联邦战备局的迈克尔
I'm Michaels, from the Federal Preparedness Agency.

701
01:06:11,697 --> 01:06:15,148
这些关于奇怪的、无法解释的、病态尸体的报告
These reports of strange, unexplained, diseased bodies.

702
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:18,190
我想你还没有进行过化验
My understanding is you haven't analysed anything

703
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:20,781
你也没有任何组织样本
不 我……
- and you have no tissue samples.
- No, I'm...

704
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:25,202
贝纳尔先生 你的结论有点不着边 别钻牛角尖
Mr Bennell, it seems you'rejust winging
your conclusions. Keep an open mind.

705
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:26,743
我不是故意…
I had no intention...

706
01:06:26,884 --> 01:06:29,555
别跟别人说这些复制身体的事
Don't mention to anyone about duplicate bodies.

707
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:33,166
我要处理…
抱歉 我要接一个电话
- I was gonna treat it...
- Excuse me, my otherphone is ringing.

708
01:06:35,478 --> 01:06:38,469
什么事？
贝纳尔先生 严肃点
- Yes?
- This is serious business, Mr Bennell.

709
01:06:38,609 --> 01:06:41,980
你是妄想狂吗？
不 不 不
- Is this just a case of paranoia?
- No, no, no.

710
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:45,691
你知道群体歇斯底里是什么样吗  贝纳尔先生？
Know what mass hysteria looks like, Mr Bennell?

711
01:06:45,822 --> 01:06:49,233
我们不想引起恐慌
我们有优先权
- We don't want to create a panic.
- We have a primary authority.

712
01:06:49,374 --> 01:06:50,694
谨慎点
Be cautious.

713
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:52,784
你的声音很痛苦
You sound distressed.

714
01:06:52,915 --> 01:06:57,416
我想前途很光明  人们正在好转
- I think the horizon looks bright.
- People are returning to normal.

715
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:59,627
不  不  她没事了
No, no. She all right.

716
01:06:59,758 --> 01:07:02,959
她现在好多了  好多了
She better now. Much better now.

717
01:07:07,311 --> 01:07:09,792
是你丈夫让你来的吗？
不 不
- Did your husband ask you to come?
- No, no.

718
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:13,473
我想让大家都看到我已经恢复正常了
I want everybody to see that I'm back to myself again.

719
01:07:14,444 --> 01:07:15,774
不 请稍等
No, wait. Please.

720
01:07:16,405 --> 01:07:18,525
一会儿见  希望如此
I'll see you soon, I hope.

721
01:07:57,843 --> 01:08:00,384
马修  这个频段什么都收不到
Matthew, I'm not getting a thing here.

722
01:08:01,554 --> 01:08:04,885
哪去了？ 我什么新闻都收不到
Where is the... I'm not getting any news here.

723
01:08:05,026 --> 01:08:07,767
不是应该有24小时滚动新闻吗？
Isn't there a 24-hour news?

724
01:08:09,238 --> 01:08:12,019
我想如果去高处可能信号会好一些
I would think you'd have a good reception on the hill.

725
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,150
那有一辆维修车  用那个行吗？
There's a repair truck out here. Could that be to do with it?

726
01:09:16,286 --> 01:09:21,078
她只是需要一些帮助睡觉的东西  明天她就完好如新了
She just needs something to help her
sleep. Tomorrow she'll be good as new.

727
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:25,749
我建议你也好好睡一觉  你已经竭尽所能了
I would suggest you get some sleep, too.
You've done everything you possibly can.

728
01:09:29,392 --> 01:09:31,923
要我捎贝利斯一程吗？
Can I give the Bellicecs a ride?

729
01:09:32,643 --> 01:09:34,473
不 我不回去
No, I'm not going back there.

730
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:37,475
我们睡汽车旅馆
你们可以呆在这儿
- We'll just get a motel.
- You can stay here.

731
01:09:39,366 --> 01:09:40,316
谢谢
Thank you.

732
01:09:41,537 --> 01:09:43,317
来吧
Come on.

733
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:46,909
我很感激你的帮助  戴维  谢谢你
I appreciate everything you've done, David. Thank you.

734
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:52,121
好好休息
一定  再见
- Get some sleep.
- Sure. See you.

735
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,010
马修  马修
Matthew. Matthew.

736
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:06,400
马修  它们正在蔓延  到处都是
Matthew, they're growing. They're everywhere!

737
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:14,030
叫醒大家！
Wake the others!

738
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,710
伊丽莎白  醒醒！它们从豆荚里长出来了
Elizabeth, wake up! They're growing out of these pods.

739
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:30,880
我去报警  
伊丽莎白  醒醒
- I'll get the police.
- Elizabeth, wake up.

740
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:33,380
它们趁你睡觉就会抓住你  坐起来！
They get you when you sleep. Sit up!

741
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,300
伊丽莎白！伊丽莎白！醒了吗？
Elizabeth! Elizabeth, would you wake up?

742
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,630
你好  警察局
Hello. Police.

743
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:41,100
警官  我在后院发现四具尸体
Officer, I would like to report four bodies in my backyard.

744
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:42,230
你还好吗？
You OK?

745
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,890
等在那儿 贝纳尔先生 
你怎么知道我的名字？
- Wait there, Mr Bennell.
- How do you know my name?

746
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:46,400
撂下电话  马修
Hang up, Matthew.

747
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:48,560
我没提我的名字！
撂下
- I didn't tell you my name!
- Hang up.

748
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,360
我没告诉他们我的名字！
他们已经是它的一部分了
- I didn't tell them my name!
- They're all a part of it.

749
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,240
它们都是豆荚里出来的  所有人都是
They're all pods, all of them.

750
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:01,080
你给谁打电话？
华盛顿
- Who are you calling?
- Washington.

751
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:03,290
中情局？联邦调查局？他们早就已经变成豆荚了
The CIA? The FBl? They're pods already.

752
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:07,330
我有朋友在司法部  我直接给他打
I've got a friend in the Justice Department.

它们从豆荚里长出来了

- Let us leave the city!

846
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:50,190
什么都没变  你可以过以往的生活

847
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:52,070
但是我们会怎么样？

等等
没有仇恨

- David, you're killing us.
- That's not true. David's right.

你的大脑和记忆都会完全吸收  一切都会完好无损的
Your minds and memories'll be totally
absorbed. Everything remains intact.

853
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,220

You've never agreed with him in your life
before! What are you talking about?

854
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:15,380

戴维 我们会死的
David, you're killing me.

856
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:54,210
这是药水是干什么的？
只是帮你睡眠的温和镇静剂
- What is this supposed to do?
- Just a mild sedative to help you sleep.

857
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:58,510
我恨你
我们不恨你
- I hate you.

858
01:32:58,650 --> 01:33:02,060
现在起再不需要恨…或者爱
There's no need for hate now... or love.

859
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:05,440

860
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:10,190
有人会站出来挑战你的
There are people who will fight you.

861
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:13,610
他们会阻止你

862
01:33:13,790 --> 01:33:16,990
一个小时以内…你们就不会想让他们阻止我了
In an hour... you won't want them to.

863
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,170
别被老脑筋所束缚
Don't be trapped by old concepts.

864
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,000
你就要进化成为一种新的生命形式

866
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,670
我们从一个濒死的世界来到这里
We came here from a dying world.

867
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:03,080
我们穿过宇宙  经过一个又一个行星
We drift through the universe from planet to planet,

868
01:34:03,210 --> 01:34:05,240
被太阳帆推动着
pushed on by the solar winds.

869
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:08,620
我们适应了…并且生存下来
We adapt... and we survive.

870
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:12,500
生命的功能幸存下来
伊丽莎白！

- Elizabeth!

871
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:31,560
打开冷库  快点
Open the freezer, quick.

872
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,980

873
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,530
关上门
Shut the door.

874
01:34:50,130 --> 01:34:52,170
我们怎么出去？
How are we gonna get outta here?

875
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:55,550
走大门  快点
Through the door. Come on.

876
01:35:30,630 --> 01:35:32,670

What's that?

877
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:39,510
我找不到杰克
I've lost Jack.

878
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,420
我们跑散了
We got separated.

879
01:35:46,270 --> 01:35:50,640
我不知道他在哪  我到处都找了  你们见过他吗？
I don't know where he is. I've looked
everywhere. Have you seen him?

880
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,850
南茜  这座楼被包围了  你是怎么进来的？
Nancy, this building is surrounded.
How did you get in?

881
01:35:54,990 --> 01:35:59,150
我在它们中间晃荡几个小时了  他们很好糊弄
I've been wandering among 'em for hours. They can be fooled.

882
01:35:59,290 --> 01:36:01,110
怎么做？
How?

883
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:03,990
别流露出感情  隐藏你的感情
Don't show any emotions. Hide your feelings.

884
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:08,200
睡觉时怎么办？
我们轮流守夜
- And when you sleep?
- We'll watch over each other.

885
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:12,530
好的
咱们去找杰克
- OK.
- Let's find Jack.

886
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,160
我们去修理它们  好吗？
We're going to beat them. OK?

887
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,175
好
OK.

888
01:36:39,601 --> 01:36:41,903
嘿！去那边排队
Hey! The lines are over there.
