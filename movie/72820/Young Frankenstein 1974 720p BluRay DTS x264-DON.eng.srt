If we look at the base
of a brain...

17
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,954
which has just been removed
from a skull...

18
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:18,150
there's very little midbrain
that we can actually see.

19
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,125
Yet, as I demonstrated
in my lecture last week...

20
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:26,133
if the under aspects
of the temporal lobes...

21
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,795
are gently pulled apart...

22
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:33,467
the upper portion of the stem
of the brain can be seen.

23
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:39,345
The so-called brainstem
consists of the midbrain...

24
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,350
a rounded protrusion
called the pons...

25
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:49,492
and a stalk tapering downwards
called the medulla oblongata...

26
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:53,190
which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum...

27
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,857
and becomes, of course...

28
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,902
the spinal cord.

29
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:59,997
Are there any questions
before we proceed?

30
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:02,371
I have one question,
Dr. Frankenstein.

31
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,413
That's Fronkensteen.

32
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:09,415
I beg your pardon?

33
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:13,112
My name...
it's pronounced Fronkensteen.

34
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:14,621
Aren't you the grandson...

35
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,658
of the famous
Dr. Victor Frankenstein...

36
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:20,422
who went into graveyards,
dug up freshly buried corpses...

37
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,589
and transformed
dead components...

38
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:23,996
Yes! Yes!

39
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,295
Yes.

40
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,530
We all know what he did.

41
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,306
But I'd rather be remembered...

42
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:33,502
for my own small contributions
to science...

43
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:37,014
and not because
of my accidental relationship...

44
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:39,183
to a famous...

45
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:41,478

[Laughter]

47
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:47,483
You mind telling me
your question?

48
00:06:47,561 --> 00:06:50,496
STUDENT: Sir, I'm not sure
I understand the distinction...

49
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:54,330
between reflexive
and voluntary nerve impulses.

50
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:55,492
Very good.

51
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:58,367
Since our lab today demonstrates
just that distinction...

52
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,066
why don't we proceed?

53

[Gong]

54
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,416
Mr. Hilltop here,
with whom I have never worked...

55
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:17,255
nor given
any prior instructions to...

56
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,262
has graciously
offered his services...

57
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,922
for this afternoon's
demonstration.

58
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,933
Mr. Hilltop,
would you hop up on your feet...

59
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,969
and stand beside this table?

60
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:37,349
Nice hopping.

61
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:41,980
Mr. Hilltop...

62
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:43,990
would you raise...

63
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:47,687
your left knee, please?

64
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:53,664
You have just witnessed
a voluntary nerve impulse.

65
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:56,830
It begins as a stimulus
from the cerebral cortex...

66
00:07:56,906 --> 00:08:00,501
passes through the brainstem and
to the various muscles involved.

67
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:02,577
Mr. Hilltop,
you may lower your knee.

68
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:05,080
Reflex movements...

69
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:08,413
are those which are made
independently of the will...

70
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:10,579
but are carried out
along pathways...

71
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:12,919
which pass between
the peripheral nervous system...

72
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,083
and the central nervous system.

73
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,423
You filthy, rotten,
yellow son of a bitch!

74
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:18,588
[Students gasp]

75
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,428
We are not aware
of these impulses.

76
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,092
Neither do we intend them...

77
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,432
to carry out
our contraction of muscles.

78
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,837
Yet, as you can see,
they work by themselves.

79
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,432
But what if we blocked
the nerve impulse...

80
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,478
by simply applying
local pressure...

81
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,276
which can be done
with any ordinary metal clamp...

82
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:37,442
just at the swelling...

83
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,486
on the posterior nerve roots...

84
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,153
for, oh, say...

85
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:44,852
five or six seconds?

86
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:52,530
Why,
you mother-grabbing bastard!

87
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:56,529
As you can see,
all communication is shut off.

In spite of our
mechanical magnificence...

91
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:06,383
if it were not for this
continuous stream...

92
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:08,543
of motor impulses...

93
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:10,588
we would collapse...

94
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:14,387
like a bunch of... broccoli!

95
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:17,054
Aieeeaah!

96
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:21,934
In conclusion,
it should be noted...

97
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,435
Give him an extra dollar.

98
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:25,267
ATTENDANT:
Extra dollar. Yes, sir.

99
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,604
FRANKENSTEIN: That any more
than common injury...

100
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:31,770
to the nerve root
is always serious...

101
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,941
because once a nerve fiber
is severed...

102
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:39,147
there is no way in heaven
or on earth...

103
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:42,447
to regenerate life back into it.

104
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,686
Are there any last questions
before we leave?

105
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:46,729
Uh, Dr. Frank...

106
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:50,365
- Fronkensteen.
- Yes?

107
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,867
Isn't it true...

108
00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:54,303
that Darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli...

109
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:55,669
in a glass case...

110
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,674
until,
by some extraordinary means...

111
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:01,337
it actually began to move
with a voluntary motion?

112
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:04,542
Are you speaking of the worm
or the spaghetti?

113
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,846
Why, the worm, sir.

114
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:11,982
FRANKENSTEIN: Yes. I did read
something of that incident...

115
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:13,150
when I was a student...

116
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,194
but you have to remember
that a worm...

117
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:17,230
with very few exceptions...

118
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:19,732
is not a human being.

[Students laughing]

120
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:24,234
But wasn't that the whole basis
of your grandfather's work...

121
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:26,570
the reanimation of dead tissue?

122
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:30,078
My grandfather
was a very sick man.

123
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,580
STUDENT:
But as a Fronkensteen...

124
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,674
aren't you the least bit curious
about it?

125
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:37,584
Doesn't the bringing back
to life what was once dead...

126
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:39,179
hold any intrigue for you?

127
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:42,590
You're are talking about
the nonsensical ravings...

128
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,252
of a lunatic mind.

129
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,297
Dead is dead!

130
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:48,799
STUDENT: But look what's been
done with hearts and kidneys.

131
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:51,802
Hearts and kidneys
are tinker toys!

132
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:54,066
I'm talking about
the central nervous system!

133
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,232
But, sir...

134
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:58,402
I am a scientist,
not a philosopher!

135
00:10:58,479 --> 00:11:00,811
You have more chance
of reanimating this scalpel...

136
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:03,145
than you have of mending
a broken nervous system!

137
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:05,344
But what about
your grandfather's work, sir?

138
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,116
FRANKENSTEIN: My grandfather's
work was doo-doo!

139
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,016
I am not interested in death!

140
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:13,856
The only thing
that concerns me...

141
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,398
is the preservation of life!

to bring you the will

Oh, my dearest love.

00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,699
I'll count the hours
that you're away.

FRANKENSTEIN:
Oh, darling, so will I.

157

Not on the lips.

158
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:24,867
What?

159
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,537
I'm going to that party
at Nana and Nicky's later.

160
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,205
I don't want to smear
my lipstick.

His veins, feet, hands,
organs...

505
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:26,141
would all have to be
increased in size.

506
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:28,176
Exactly.

507
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:31,778
He would have
an enormous schwanstugel.

508
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:39,488
That goes without saying.

509
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:41,521
Woof!

510
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:44,092
He'll be very popular.

511
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:48,058
What we're aiming for...

512
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:51,591
is a being approximately
seven feet in height...

513
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:53,901
with all features
either congenitally...

514
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:56,498
or artificially
proportionate in size.

515
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:57,702
Something like...

516
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:00,206
this?

517
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:07,012
FRANKENSTEIN: Hello!

518
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:09,215
You've caught something there.

519
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:12,852
Crude, yes. Primitive, yes.
Perhaps even grotesque.

520
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:16,421
Yet, something inexplicable
tells me...

521
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:21,061
that this might be our man.

522
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:39,183
All right.

523
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:41,692
That's good enough
for the likes of him.

524

FRANKENSTEIN: Get down.

525
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:10,318
Now.

FRANKENSTEIN:
What a filthy job!

IGOR: Could be worse.

00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:45,457
How?

00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:44,530
FRANKENSTEIN: Uh, no, thanks.

I know everyone
in this neighborhood.

I've never seen your face
before.

I am

newly arrived from America.

I was told you were here.

I'm Constable Henry.
Pleased to meet you.

How very nice to meet you.

You're chilled to the bone!

A warm fire's just the thing.

545
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:19,063
A nip from the bottle
wouldn't be too bad.

546
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:21,607
That's the ticket!

547
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:25,543
If you have everything in hand,
I'll say good night.

Thank you, Constable.

Oh, what an awesome sight.

What a profound
and reverent night is this.

all we need now
is an equally magnificent brain.

Yes! It's all written
in the notes!

I say, there's a possibility

Did you tie the kites?

Oh, that! Ja!

605
00:43:43,808 --> 00:43:45,571
From that fateful day...

606
00:43:45,676 --> 00:43:49,806
when stinking bits of slime
first crawled from the sea...

607

teaches us anything...

1175
01:23:07,193 --> 01:23:08,455
Agggh!

1176
01:23:52,078 --> 01:23:56,981
FRANKENSTEIN:
Chained like a beast in a cage.

1177
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:00,483
INGA:
Oh, Doctor, I feel so terrible.

1178
01:24:00,554 --> 01:24:02,283
FRANKENSTEIN:
There's only one answer.

1179
01:24:02,389 --> 01:24:05,017
If I could equalize
the imbalance...

1180
01:24:05,126 --> 01:24:07,617
in his cerebral spinal fluid...

1181
01:24:08,463 --> 01:24:10,795
he'd be as right as rain.

1182
01:24:10,865 --> 01:24:11,991
But how?

1183
01:24:12,735 --> 01:24:15,795
How? Before it's too late.

1184
01:24:15,871 --> 01:24:17,998
INGA: Oh, Frederick...

1185
01:24:18,073 --> 01:24:20,200
if only there was some way
I could...

1186
01:24:20,276 --> 01:24:21,368
FRANKENSTEIN: Mmm.

1187
01:24:21,444 --> 01:24:23,969
INGA: Relieve your torture.

1188
01:24:24,047 --> 01:24:25,981
FRANKENSTEIN: Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

1189
01:24:26,049 --> 01:24:28,313
INGA: I wish
there was some way I could...

1190
01:24:28,385 --> 01:24:29,909
FRANKENSTEIN: Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

1191
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:31,318
INGA: Relieve the tension.

1192
01:24:31,388 --> 01:24:35,518
If I could give you
a little peace.

1193
01:24:43,503 --> 01:24:45,471
Doctor, I have...

1194
01:24:45,571 --> 01:24:46,697
Doctor?

1195
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:49,803
FRANKENSTEIN: What is it?

1196
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:56,279
Doctor? Where are you?

1197
01:25:10,733 --> 01:25:13,964
BLUCHER: Doctor, this cable
came while you were gone.

1198
01:25:14,037 --> 01:25:15,800
FRANKENSTEIN:
I thought I told you...

1199
01:25:15,872 --> 01:25:20,172
never to interrupt me
while I'm working!

1200
01:25:20,244 --> 01:25:21,939
BLUCHER: I'm sorry, Doctor.

1201
01:25:22,013 --> 01:25:24,106
I thought this was an emergency.

1202
01:25:24,182 --> 01:25:28,482
Your fiancee will be arriving
any second.

1203
01:25:28,554 --> 01:25:31,250
FRANKENSTEIN:
What? Elizabeth? Here tonight?

1204
01:25:31,323 --> 01:25:34,554
BLUCHER: Yes. I will go
prepare her room at once.

1205
01:25:35,829 --> 01:25:37,319
I suggest you put on a tie.

1206
01:25:58,354 --> 01:25:59,480
Darling!

1207
01:26:00,623 --> 01:26:01,681
FRANKENSTEIN: Darling!

1208
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:04,123
- Surprised?
- Surprised.

1209
01:26:04,194 --> 01:26:05,855
- Love me?
- Love you.

1210
01:26:07,231 --> 01:26:08,425
FRANKENSTEIN: Well...

1211
01:26:10,468 --> 01:26:11,935
Let's turn in.

1212
01:26:12,003 --> 01:26:13,095
ELIZABETH: Darling!

1213
01:26:13,171 --> 01:26:15,731
FRANKENSTEIN:
I'm sure you're tired.

1214
01:26:15,807 --> 01:26:17,707
I'll pay the driver.

1215
01:26:17,776 --> 01:26:19,141
IGOR: Darling!

1216
01:26:19,211 --> 01:26:20,337
ELIZABETH: What?

1217
01:26:22,114 --> 01:26:24,412
- Surprised?
- I, uh... yes.

1218
01:26:24,483 --> 01:26:26,576
- Love me?
- Well...

1219
01:26:26,653 --> 01:26:28,450
IGOR: Well, let's turn in.

1220
01:26:28,521 --> 01:26:30,489
FRANKENSTEIN: Darling!

1221
01:26:30,557 --> 01:26:32,115
IGOR: Say nothing. Act casual.

1222
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,420
FRANKENSTEIN: Ready?

1223
01:26:33,494 --> 01:26:35,894
ELIZABETH: I think.

1224
01:26:35,963 --> 01:26:37,453
Yes.

1225
01:26:37,531 --> 01:26:39,829
I am a bit tired after all.

1226
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:45,167
FRANKENSTEIN: My assistants,
Inga and lgor.

1227
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,537
ELIZABETH: How do you do?

1228
01:26:47,877 --> 01:26:49,105
How do you do?

1229
01:26:49,178 --> 01:26:51,442
FRANKENSTEIN:
This is my financier Elizabeth.

1230
01:26:51,547 --> 01:26:53,674
INGA: I'm happy to meet you.

1231
01:26:53,783 --> 01:26:54,943
FRANKENSTEIN: Financee.

1232
01:26:55,052 --> 01:26:56,747
ELIZABETH: Excuse me, darling.

1233
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:00,415
What is it exactly
that you do do?

1234
01:27:02,627 --> 01:27:03,719
INGA: Uh...

1235
01:27:03,795 --> 01:27:07,162
I assist Dr. Frankenstein
in the laboratory.

1236
01:27:07,232 --> 01:27:09,996
We have
intellectual discussions.

1237
01:27:10,069 --> 01:27:13,061
We were having one
as you were driving up.

1238
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:14,197
FRANKENSTEIN: Nein!

1239
01:27:15,808 --> 01:27:18,174
Lgor, help me with the bags.

1240
01:27:18,245 --> 01:27:19,337
IGOR: Soitainly.

1241
01:27:19,413 --> 01:27:22,348
You take the blonde.
I'll take the one in the toiban.

1242
01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:23,678
Ggggrrrrr!

1243
01:27:23,784 --> 01:27:24,910
Ggggrrrrr!

1244
01:27:27,755 --> 01:27:29,188
FRANKENSTEIN: Stop that.

1245
01:27:29,257 --> 01:27:30,690
The luggage.

1246
01:27:30,758 --> 01:27:32,726
IGOR: Yes, master.

1247
01:27:32,828 --> 01:27:34,227
FRANKENSTEIN: Ladies, this way.

1248
01:27:36,498 --> 01:27:39,524
IGOR: If you need help
with the girls...

1249
01:27:44,374 --> 01:27:45,466
Agggh!

1250
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:47,635
JAILOR: Ha ha ha!

1251
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,044
You settle down now.

1252
01:27:50,114 --> 01:27:53,572
'Cause we're gonna be pals.

1253
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:55,812
Right?

1254
01:27:55,887 --> 01:27:58,355
MONSTER: Agggh!

1255
01:27:58,457 --> 01:27:59,947
JAILOR: Nice and cozy.

1256
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:03,760
Just like old friends.

1257
01:28:10,471 --> 01:28:11,699
MONSTER: Mmmmm.

1258
01:28:11,772 --> 01:28:12,864
Mmmmm.

1259
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:14,703
JAILOR: What's the matter?

1260
01:28:14,775 --> 01:28:16,242
You're afraid of this fire?

1261
01:28:17,512 --> 01:28:18,877
This can't hurt you.

1262
01:28:18,947 --> 01:28:20,278
- See?
- Mmmmm!

1263
01:28:21,716 --> 01:28:23,843
Some monster you are.

1264
01:28:24,687 --> 01:28:26,712
Mama was right.

1265
01:28:26,789 --> 01:28:29,952
Little boys ain't supposed
to play with fire.

1266
01:28:30,059 --> 01:28:31,185
MONSTER: Mmmmm!

1267
01:28:31,294 --> 01:28:34,024
Is they?
'Cause they might get hurt!

1268
01:28:34,131 --> 01:28:35,598
MONSTER: Agggh!

1269
01:29:01,929 --> 01:29:03,521
KEMP: Silence!

Up.

1271
01:29:05,332 --> 01:29:08,267
A riot is an ugly thing.

1272
01:29:09,071 --> 01:29:13,405
I think it is just about time
we had one!

1273
01:29:13,475 --> 01:29:15,773
CROWD: Yeah!

1274
01:29:15,845 --> 01:29:17,369
Kill the monster!

1275
01:29:17,447 --> 01:29:20,939
Kill the monster!

1276
01:29:21,017 --> 01:29:24,578
He will curse the day...

1277
01:29:24,655 --> 01:29:28,591
[Garbled]
That he was born a Frankenstein!

1278
01:29:28,659 --> 01:29:30,593
CROWD: What?

1279
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:35,599
KEMP: He will curse the day
that he was born a Frankenstein.

1280
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:37,294
CROWD: Yeah!

1281
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,112
FRANKENSTEIN: Loose!

1282
01:29:54,188 --> 01:29:56,418
He's broken loose!

1283
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,755
Do you know what that means?

1284
01:29:58,826 --> 01:30:01,624
ELIZABETH:
Darling, you mustn't worry so.

1285
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:06,098
FRANKENSTEIN:
I suppose you're right.

1286
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:07,999
Of course I am.

1287
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:10,198
Now come along.

1288
01:30:10,306 --> 01:30:12,740
What would I do without you?

1289
01:30:12,809 --> 01:30:16,939
Is your room down the hall
if I get the frights?

1290
01:30:18,015 --> 01:30:21,815
Yes. But I thought tonight,
under the circumstances...

1291
01:30:21,887 --> 01:30:24,913
I might stay here with you.

1292
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:29,859
Would you want me now,
so soon before our wedding...

1293
01:30:29,929 --> 01:30:32,022
so near
we could almost touch it?

1294
01:30:34,734 --> 01:30:35,826
FRANKENSTEIN: Yes!

1295
01:30:35,903 --> 01:30:38,064
ELIZABETH: Whoa, boy!

1296
01:30:38,138 --> 01:30:40,402
Or...

1297
01:30:40,474 --> 01:30:42,942
to wait just
a little while longer...

1298
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:46,604
when I can give myself
without hesitation...

1299
01:30:46,714 --> 01:30:48,477
when I can be totally,
unashamedly...

1300
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:50,279
and legally yours?

1301
01:30:54,223 --> 01:30:56,521
That's a tough choice.

1302
01:30:56,592 --> 01:30:58,753
You're a tough guy.

1303
01:30:58,828 --> 01:30:59,954
[Smack]

1304
01:31:02,098 --> 01:31:03,725
I suppose you're right.

1305
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,461
Of course I am. I always am.

1306
01:31:07,038 --> 01:31:08,733
Kiss me and say good night.

1307
01:31:12,878 --> 01:31:14,140
No tongues.

1308
01:31:22,021 --> 01:31:23,511
Good night, darling.

Good night, darling.

1310

Good night, sweetheart.

1311
01:31:26,025 --> 01:31:27,322
Good night, sweetheart.

1312
01:31:27,393 --> 01:31:29,691
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1313
01:31:29,763 --> 01:31:31,196

- I love you, honey.
- Ha ha ha.

1315
01:31:33,734 --> 01:31:35,793
Sweet dreams, darling.

1316
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:37,235
Good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

of his terrible swift sword.

01:31:52,022 --> 01:31:55,321
His truth is marching on.

Where am I?

1329
01:32:59,632 --> 01:33:01,190
Aahhh!

01:33:01,267 --> 01:33:03,701
Who are you? What are you?

What do you want?

Mmmmm.

I'm not afraid of you.

How much do you want?
My father's very rich.

INGA: Mmmmm!

1502
01:44:03,752 --> 01:44:05,777
The feeling is mutual.

1503
01:44:08,891 --> 01:44:10,722
It's a puzzlement.

1504
01:44:10,793 --> 01:44:12,522
There's something
I've always wanted to ask...

1505
01:44:12,595 --> 01:44:14,620
about that operation.

1506
01:44:15,399 --> 01:44:17,890
In the transference part...

1507
01:44:17,968 --> 01:44:21,131
the monster got part
of your wonderful brain.

1508
01:44:21,205 --> 01:44:23,435
What did you get from him?

1509
01:44:26,945 --> 01:44:32,975
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!

1510
01:44:33,052 --> 01:44:34,383
INGA: No! Oh!

1511
01:44:34,453 --> 01:44:36,250
I don't believe... Oh!

1512
01:44:36,322 --> 01:44:38,483
Ow! Oh, oh!

1513
01:44:38,558 --> 01:44:40,287
[Singing] Oh...

1514
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,487
sweet mystery of life...

1515
01:44:42,562 --> 01:44:45,725
at last I've found you!
