1
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:10,593
If we look at
the base of the brain,

2
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:13,596
Which has just been
removed from the skull,

3
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:17,600
There's very little of
the midbrain that we can see.

4
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,603
Yet, as I demonstrated
in my lecture last week,

5
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:25,108
If the under aspects
of the temporal lobes

6
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:28,111
Are gently pulled apart,

7
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:32,615
The upper portion of the stem
of the brain can be seen.

8
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:38,621
The so-called brain stem
consists of the midbrain,

9
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:44,127
A rounded protrusion
called the pons,

10
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:48,131
And a stalk tapering downwards
called the medulla oblongata,

11
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,634
Which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum,

12
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:56,139
And becomes, of course,
the spinal cord.

13
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,641
Are there any questions
before we proceed?

14
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,394
I have one question,
Dr. Frankenstein.

15
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:06,149
That's Fronkensteen.

16
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,151
I beg your pardon?

17
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,652
My name--

18
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:12,655
It's pronounced
Fronkensteen.

19
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,158
But aren't you the grandson
of Dr. Victor Frankenstein

20
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:19,162
Who went into graveyards,
dug up freshly buried corpses,

21
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,164
And transformed
dead components--

22
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:24,167
Yes! Yes! Yes!

23
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,169
We all know
what he did.

24
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,172
But I'd rather
be remembered

25
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:32,675
For my own small
contributions to science,

26
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:36,179
And not because of my
accidental relationship

27
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:39,182
To a famous...

28
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,150
cuckoo.

29
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:46,689
If you don't mind, can we
get on with your question?

30
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,692
Well, sir, I'm not sure
I understand the distinction

31
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:53,196
Between reflexive
and voluntary impulses.

32
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:56,699
Our lab is a demonstration
of just that distinction.

33
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,202
Why don't we proceed?

34
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:11,214
Mr. Hilltop here,

35
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:13,216
With whom
I have never worked

36
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:16,219
Nor given any prior
instructions to,

37
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,221
Has graciously offered
his services

38
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,722
For this afternoon's
demonstration.

39
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,725
Mr. Hilltop, would you
hop up on your feet

40
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:25,228
And stand beside this table?

41
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,573
Nice hopping.

42
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,244
Mr. Hilltop,

43
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:46,749
Would you raise your
left knee, please?

44
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:52,755
You have just witnessed
a voluntary impulse.

45
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:55,758
It begins as a stimulus
from the cerebral cortex,

46
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,760
Passes through
the brain stem

47
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,262
To the muscles
involved.

48
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:02,265
Mr. Hilltop, you
may lower your knee.

49
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:04,767
Reflex movements
are those

50
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,270
Made independently
of the will,

51
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,272
But are carried out
along pathways

52
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:12,275
Between the peripheral
nervous system

53
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,776
And the central
nervous system.

54
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:17,280
You filthy, rotten,
yellow son of a bitch!

55
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,283
We are not aware
of these impulses.

56
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:24,287
Neither do we intend them
to contract our muscles,

57
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:26,789
Yet, as you can see,
they work by themselves.

58
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,292
But what if we blocked
the nerve impulse

59
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,294
By simply applying
local pressure?

60
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:34,297
Which can be done with
any ordinary metal clamp

61
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:36,299
Just at the swelling

62
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,802
On the posterior
nerve roots...

63
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:43,806
for, oh, say,
5 or 6 seconds.

64
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:50,313
You mothergrabbing
bastard!

65
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:55,318
As you can see, all
communication is shut off.

66
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,325
In spite of our
mechanical magnificence,

67
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,328
If it were not
for this continuous stream

68
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:07,830
Of motor impulses,

69
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,832
We would collapse

70
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:13,336
Like a bunch of broccoli!

71
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,838
Aaaah!

72
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,344
In conclusion,
it should be noted--

73
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:22,845
Give him
an extra dollar.

74
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,347
Yes, sir.

75
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:27,350
--That any more
than common injury

76
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,853
To the nerve root
is always serious,

77
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:33,856
Because once a nerve
fiber is severed,

78
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:38,361
There is no way
in heaven or on earth

79
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,864
To regenerate life
back into it.

80
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:43,366
Are there any questions
before we leave?

81
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:47,870
Uh, Dr. Frank--
Fronkensteen.

82
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:48,871
Yes?

83
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:51,874
Isn't it true
that Darwin preserved

84
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,377
A piece of vermicelli
in a glass case

85
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:57,880
Until it actually
began to move

86
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,882
With a voluntary motion?

87
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:03,886
Are you speaking of the worm
or the spaghetti?

88
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:07,890
Why, the worm, sir.

89
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,892
Yes, it seems to me
I did read something

90
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:12,395
Of that incident
when I was a student,

91
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:13,896
But you must remember
that a worm,

92
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:15,898
With very few exceptions,

93
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,901
Is not a human being.

94
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:22,905
Wasn't that the basis of
your grandfather's work,

95
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:25,408
The reanimation
of dead tissue?

96
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:29,412
My grandfather
was a very sick man.

97
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,913
But as a Fronkensteen,

98
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:33,416
Aren't you the least bit
curious about it?

99
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,419
Doesn't bringing what
was dead back to life

100
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,920
Hold any intrigue
for you?

101
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,422
You're talking about

102
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:42,925
The nonsensical ravings
of a lunatic mind.

103
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:44,927
Dead is dead!

104
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:47,430
Look what has been done
with hearts and kidneys.

105
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,433
Hearts and kidneys
are tinker toys!

106
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,935
I'm talking about
the central nervous system!

107
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:53,936
But, sir--

108
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,939
I am a scientist,
not a philosopher!

109
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:59,442
You have more chance
of reanimating this scalpel

110
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,944
Than you have of mending
a broken nervous system!

111
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,446
But your
grandfather's work--

112
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,949
My grandfather's work
was doo-doo!

113
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,953
I am not
interested in death!

114
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:15,458
The only thing that concerns me
is the preservation of life!

115
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:24,967
Class...

116
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,469
is...

117
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:27,970
dismissed.

118
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,482
Dr. Frankenstein.

119
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:43,986
That's
Fronkensteen.

120
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,492
My name is
Gerhardt Falkstein.

121
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,494
I've traveled
5,000 miles

122
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,997
To bring you the will
of your great-grandfather,

123
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:59,719
Baron Beaufort
Von Frankenstein.

124
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,518
Oh, my sweet darling,

125
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,520
Oh, my dearest love.

126
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,522
I'll count the hours
that you're away.

127
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,023
Oh, darling,
so will I.

128
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:23,025
Not on the lips.

129
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:24,026
What?

130
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:26,529
I'm going to that party
at Nana and Nicky's.

131
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,030
I don't want to
smear my lipstick.

132
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,032
Of course.

133
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:31,534
All aboard!

134
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,535
Oh, dear!

135
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:35,037
Well, I guess
this is it.

136
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:38,541
Freddy, darling,
how can I say in a few minutes

137
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,544
What it's taken me
a lifetime to understand?

138
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,045
Won't you try?

139
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,547
All right.

140
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,550
You've got it, mister.

141
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:51,053
I'm yours--All of me.
What else can I say?

142
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:52,054
My sweet love--

143
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,557
The hair!
Just been set.

144
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:57,059
Sorry. Sorry.

145
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,561
I hope you like
old-fashioned weddings.

146
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,063
I prefer old-fashioned
wedding nights.

147
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,065
You're incorrigible!

148
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,067
Does that mean...

149
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,571
you love me?

150
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:10,573
You bet your boots
it does.

151
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,074
Oh, my only love--

152
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,077
Taffeta, darling.

153
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,579
Taffeta, sweetheart.

154
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,582
No, the dress
is taffeta.

155
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,083
It wrinkles so easily.

156
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,585
All aboard!

157
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:25,588
There goes that
horrid man again.

158
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,590
Hurry. Before I make
a fool of myself.

159
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,593
Aah! The nails! Oh!

160
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:31,594
Sorry.

161
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:41,103
Good-bye, darling.

162
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:42,605
Good-bye, Freddy.

163
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,912
Darling!

164
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,115
Oh, God.

165
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:54,617
Ha ha.

166
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:15,137
Harry, he was at it again.

167
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:16,639
What do you want me
to do about it?

168
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:17,640
Every day!

169
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,142
Let him! Let him!

170
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:22,144
New York next!

171
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:24,146
Everybody out for New York!

172
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:35,658
Transylvania nachst.

173
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:39,161
Nenne aufsteigen
fur Transylvania.

174
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:40,663
Transylvania nachst.

175
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:43,799
Nenne aufsteigen
fur Transylvania.

176
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,674
Pardon me, boy,

177
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:55,177
Is this
the Transylvania station?

178
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,680
Ja! Ja! Track 29!

179
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:01,150
Oh, can I give you
a shine?

180
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,686
Uh, no thanks.

181
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,934
Dr. Frankenstein?

182
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,973
Fronkensteen.

183
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,860
You're putting me on.

184
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,364
No. It's pronounced
Fronkensteen.

185
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,366
Do you also say
Froderick?

186
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,818
No. Frederick.

187
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,871
Well, why isn't it
Froderick Fronkensteen?

188
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,874
It isn't. It's
Frederick Fronkensteen.

189
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,876
I see.

190
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:01,877
You must be Igor.

191
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:06,382
No, it's
pronounced I-Gor.

192
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,883
But they told me
it was Igor.

193
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,386
Well, they
were wrong then.

194
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,389
Uh...you were sent
by herr Falkstein?

195
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:18,227
Yes. My grandfather used
to work for your grandfather.

196
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,897
How nice.

197
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,400
Of course,
the rates have gone up.

198
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,401
Of course.

199
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,903
I'm sure we'll get
along splendidly.

200
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,405
Oh!

201
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,906
Sorry...

202
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,908
I...uh...

203
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,410
you know, I don't mean
to embarrass you,

204
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,912
But I'm a rather
brilliant surgeon.

205
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,915
Perhaps I could help
you with that hump.

206
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,417
What hump?

207
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,922
Let's go.

208
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,426
Allow me, master.

209
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,928
Oh, thanks
very much.

210
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,435
Walk this way.

211
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,939
This way.

212
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,460
Think you'll be more
comfortable in the rear.

213
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,466
Oof!

214
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,467
What was that?

215
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,469
Oh, that's Inga.

216
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,971
Herr Falkstein thought
you might need

217
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,973
A laboratory
assistant temporarily.

218
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:38,974
Oh.

219
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:42,478
Oof!

220
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,979
Hello.

221
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,981
Would you like to have
a roll in the hay?

222
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,983
It's fun.

223
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,486
"Roll, roll"

224
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
"Roll in the hay"

225
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,990
Oof!

226
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,514
Sometimes, I'm afraid
of the lightning.

227
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,016
Just an atmospheric
discharge.

228
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,018
Nothing to be afraid of.

229
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:30,526
Werewolf!

230
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,027
Werewolf?

231
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,029
There.

232
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,531
What?

233
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,533
There wolf.

234
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,035
There castle.

235
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,037
Why are you
talking that way?

236
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,539
I thought
you wanted to.

237
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,041
No, I don't want to.

238
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,243
Suit yourself.
I'm easy.

239
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,048
Well...

240
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,550
there it is...

241
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,051
home.

242
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,036
What knockers!

243
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,538
Oh.

244
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,540
Thank you, doctor.

245
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,542
Oh. That's all right.

246
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,060
I am Frau Blucher.

247
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,567
Steady!

248
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,071
How do you do?
I am Dr. Fronkensteen.

249
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:07,573
This is
my assistant Inga.

250
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,575
May I present
Frau Blucher?

251
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,580
What's got
into them?

252
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:21,086
Your rooms have been
prepared, herr doktor.

253
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,088
If you will follow me.

254
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,090
Igor, would you
bring the bags

255
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,092
When you're
finished, please?

256
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,594
Yes, master.

257
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,096
After you,
Frau Blucher.

258
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,112
Blucher!

259
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,634
Follow me, please.

260
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,656
Stay close
to the candles.

261
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,660
The staircase
can be treacherous.

262
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,170
This is your room.

263
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,172
It was your grandfather
Victor's room.

264
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,174
I see.

265
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,511
Well, there seem to be
quite a few books.

266
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,681
This was Victor's--

267
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,683
The baron's--
Medical library.

268
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:01,186
Where is my grandfather's
private library?

269
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,188
I don't know
what you mean, sir.

270
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,691
Well, these books
are all very general.

271
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,192
Any doctor might have
them in his study.

272
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:12,197
This is the only library
I know of, Dr. Frankenstone.

273
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,701
Fronkensteen.

274
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,704
Well, we'll see.

275
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,706
Good night.

276
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:27,713
Would the doctor care for
a brandy before retiring?

277
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,715
No.

278
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,216
Thank you.

279
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:38,223
Some warm milk...
perhaps?

280
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:41,226
No. Thank you
very much.

281
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,729
No, thanks.

282
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,230
Ovaltine?

283
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,739
Nothing! Thank you.

284
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,741
I'm a little tired.

285
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,747
Then I will say
good night.

286
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,748
Good night!

287
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,901
Good night, darling.

288
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,273
Good night,
herr doktor.

289
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,776
Good night,
Frau Blucher.

290
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,808
Uh...

291
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,310
I'm not a Frankenstein.

292
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,314
I am not a Frankenstein!

293
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,818
I'm a Fronkensteen!

294
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,820
Don't give me that!

295
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,824
I don't believe in fate!

296
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,909
And I won't say it.

297
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,830
All right. You win. I give.

298
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,832
I'll say it. I'll say it.

299
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,334
I'll say it.

300
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,836
Destiny!

301
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,337
Destiny!

302
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,840
No escaping that for me!

303
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,841
Destiny!

304
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,342
Destiny!

305
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,344
No escaping that for me!

306
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,346
Destiny. Destiny.

307
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,349
No escaping...

308
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,854
Dr. Fronkensteen,
wake up.

309
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,355
What is it?

310
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,858
You were having
a nachtmare.

311
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:55,861
What's that
strange music?

312
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,362
I have no idea.

313
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:01,867
But it seems
to be coming...

314
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,369
from behind ze bookcase.

315
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:09,374
Behind ze bookcase.

316
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,377
Hand me that robe,
would you, dear?

317
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,383
You were right.

318
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,887
It's coming
from behind this wall.

319
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,389
Where is it? Where is it?

320
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,390
What?

321
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,391
There's always a device.

322
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,394
If I could spot
the triggering mechanism--

323
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,396
Hello!

324
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,909
It seems louder
over here.

325
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,911
Hand me that candle,
will you?

326
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:51,416
Put...

327
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,418
the candle...

328
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,419
back!

329
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,929
All right, I think
I have it figured out now.

330
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,931
Take out the candle,

331
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,433
And I'll block
the bookcase

332
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,435
With my body.

333
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,914
Now, listen
to me very carefully.

334
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,952
Don't put
the candle back.

335
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:28,954
With all of your might,

336
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,457
Shove against the other
side of the bookcase.

337
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,461
Is that perfectly clear?

338
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,463
I think so.

339
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,474
Good girl.

340
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,979
Put... the candle... back.

341
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,488
Oh, look, doctor.
A passageway!

342
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,990
Whatever
that music is

343
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,992
It's coming
from down there.

344
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,493
I'd better
take a look.

345
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,996
Let me come with you,
doctor, please.

346
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,998
I don't want to stay
up here alone.

347
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,499
All right, then.

348
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,001
Close your robe
and follow me.

349
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,503
Oh, doctor.
The candle.

350
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,005
Good thinking.

351
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,007
Let's try this one.

352
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,509
Stand back!

353
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,041
Ohhh!

354
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,511
Don't be
frightened.

355
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,513
It's just
a rat.

356
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,015
A filthy,
slimy rat!

357
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,554
Good lord!

358
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,055
Ohhh!

359
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,575
Aah!
"I"

360
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,077
"Ain't got
nobody"

361
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,080
"And nobody
cares for me"

362
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,582
"Yakka tak ta
yakka tak ta ha"

363
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,583
Igor!

364
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,584
Froderick!

365
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,085
How did you
get here?

366
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,589
Through
the dumbwaiter.

367
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,591
I heard the strangest music
from the upstairs kitchen,

368
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,594
And I just followed
it down.

369
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,095
Call it...

370
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,097
a hunch.
"Badoom-Chi"

371
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,099
Someone else must
have been here.

372
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,602
It would
seem that way...

373
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,104
and there's
the only other door.

374
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,607
Wait, master.

375
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,109
It might be
dangerous.

376
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,611
You go first.

377
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,826
Aren't there
any lights in this place?

378
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,328
Two nasty-looking
switches over here,

379
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,331
But I'm not going
to be the first.

380
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,333
Ohh.

381
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,338
Damn your eyes!

382
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,840
Too late.

383
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,853
Ohhh.

384
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,824
So this is where
it all happened.

385
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,836
Just think.

386
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,337
A dead brain...

387
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,840
ready to live again
in a new body.

388
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,343
Look. No blood.
No decomposition.

389
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,345
Just a few sutures.

390
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,346
Throw the main switch!

391
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,848
Yes, master.

392
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,857
What a filthy mess!

393
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,359
I don't know,
a little paint, a few flowers,

394
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,862
A couple of
throw pillows...

395
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,867
well, it seems as if
our mysterious violinist

396
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,869
Has disa--

397
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,371
Disa what?

398
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,873
Shh!
--Ppeared.

399
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:19,794
There's a light coming
from behind that door.

400
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,297
Follow me.

401
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,327
Doctor, look!

402
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,334
This explains the music.

403
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,835
It's still warm.

404
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,836
Hmm.

405
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,339
But who
was playing it?

406
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,840
I don't know...

407
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,709
but whoever it was
just barely finished

408
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,544
Putting out his cigar.

409
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,547
Such strange goings on.

410
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:17,051
What is
this place?

411
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:18,052
Music room?

412
00:32:19,554 --> 00:32:23,558
But there's nothing here
but books and papers!

413
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:26,060
Books and papers?

414
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,061
It is!

415
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:29,564
This is my grandfather's
private library!

416
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:32,066
I feel it!

417
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:35,069
Look! Look at this!

418
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,552
"Until, from
the midst of this darkness,

419
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,555
"a sudden light
broke in upon me".

420
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,558
"A light so brilliant
and wondrous..."

421
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,061
"and yet so simple--"

422
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:04,065
"Change the poles
from plus to minus"

423
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:08,069
"and from minus to plus".

424
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,074
"I alone succeeded
in discovering"

425
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,576
"the secret of
bestowing life".

426
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,578
"Nay, even more..."

427
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,081
"I myself..."

428
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:24,085
"became capable of
bestowing animation"

429
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,587
"upon lifeless matter!"

430
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,595
It...

431
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,596
could...

432
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,382
work!

433
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,066
Kipper?

434
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,568
Mmm.
Thank you, doctor.

435
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,075
"As the minuteness
of the parts"

436
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,577
"formed a great
hindrance to my speed"

437
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,579
"I resolved therefore
to make the creature"

438
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,582
"of a gigantic stature".

439
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,087
Of course!

440
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:18,589
That would simplify
everything.

441
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:20,091
In other words,

442
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,094
His veins, his feet,
his hands, his organs

443
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,595
Would all have to be
increased in size.

444
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,098
Exactly.

445
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,818
He would have an
enormous schwanstucker.

446
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,109
That goes without saying.

447
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,111
Oof!

448
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:44,082
He's gonna be
very popular.

449
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,118
So, then,
what we're aiming for

450
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,621
Is a being approximately
seven feet in height...

451
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,124
with all features
either congenitally

452
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,626
Or artificially
proportionate in size.

453
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,595
Something like...

454
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,630
this?

455
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,137
Hello!

456
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,139
You've caught
something there.

457
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,141
Crude, yes.
Primitive, yes.

458
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,642
Perhaps even
grotesque.

459
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:15,146
Yet, something
inexplicable tells me

460
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,647
That this...

461
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,149
might be...

462
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,651
our man.

463
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,169
All right, all right,

464
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,671
That's good enough
for the likes of him.

465
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,690
Get down, you fool.

466
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,700
Now.

467
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,732
What a filthy job!

468
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,234
Could be worse.

469
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:44,235
How?

470
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:45,736
Could be raining.

471
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,785
Quick!

472
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,792
Need a hand?

473
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,295
Ah...
no, thanks. Have one.

474
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,796
Thanks very much
all the same.

475
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,798
Just a moment, sir!

476
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,800
I know everyone in
this neighborhood,

477
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,303
But I've never seen
your face before.

478
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,804
Can you account
for yourself?

479
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,307
Yes. I am Dr. Frederick
Fronkensteen,

480
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,808
Newly arrived
from America.

481
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,811
Oh, yes, sir. I was
told you were here.

482
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,814
I'm constable Henry.
Pleased to meet you.

483
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,319
How very nice
to meet you, constable.

484
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,322
Why, you're chilled
to the bone, sir!

485
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,325
A nice warm fire's
the thing for you.

486
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,827
A nip from the bottle
wouldn't be too bad,

487
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:17,828
Would it, sir?

488
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,331
That's the ticket!
Yes.

489
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,833
Well, if you have
everything in hand,

490
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,335
I'll say good night.

491
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,337
Thank you very much,
constable.

492
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,838
At your
service, sir...

493
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,340
always.

494
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,343
Good night, constable.

495
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,844
Good night, sir.

496
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:55,866
Oh, what an
awesome sight.

497
00:38:55,866 --> 00:39:00,871
What a profound and
reverent night is this.

498
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,874
With such a specimen
for a body,

499
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:08,879
All we need now is an
equally magnificent brain.

500
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,382
You know what to do?

501
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,883
I have
a pretty good idea.

502
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,385
Good man.

503
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,388
Didn't you--

504
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,889
Didn't you have that
on the other side?

505
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:19,890
What?

506
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,393
Your, uh...

507
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,395
oh, never mind.

508
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,400
Do you have
that name?

509
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,402
I have it written down.

510
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,905
"H. Delbruck."

511
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,408
Hans Delbruck.

512
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,402
Ahh!

513
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,100
Aah!

514
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,272
He's hideous!

515
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:33,774
He's beautiful.

516
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:38,779
And he is mine.

517
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,290
Hurry now. We're fighting
time and the elements.

518
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,292
Are you ready?

519
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:53,294
Are you sure this
is how they did it?

520
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:56,297
Yes! It's all
written in the notes!

521
00:41:56,297 --> 00:41:59,300
Now tie off the kites and
hurry down as fast as you can!

522
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,801
What's the hurry?

523
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:03,804
There's a possibility
of electrocution!

524
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:05,806
Do you understand?

525
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:13,314
I say, there's a possibility
of electrocution!

526
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,816
Do you understand?

527
00:42:15,816 --> 00:42:17,318
I understand.

528
00:42:17,318 --> 00:42:18,819
Why are
you shouting?

529
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:21,822
Did you...

530
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:24,325
did you tie off
the kites?

531
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:25,826
Of course.

532
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:27,328
Oh.

533
00:42:27,328 --> 00:42:28,829
All right. Good.

534
00:42:30,331 --> 00:42:31,832
Uh, check the generator.

535
00:42:31,832 --> 00:42:33,834
Yes, master.

536
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:45,346
Igor, release the safety valve
on the main wheel.

537
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:47,848
Yes, master.

538
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:55,856
Can you imagine
the brain of Hans Delbruck

539
00:42:55,856 --> 00:42:57,358
In this body?

540
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,360
Oh, Frederick.

541
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,863
This is the moment.

542
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:05,366
Well, dear...

543
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:07,368
are you ready?

544
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:08,869
Yes, doctor.

545
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,374
Elevate me.

546
00:43:13,374 --> 00:43:15,876
Now? Right here?

547
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:19,380
Yes. Yes.
Raise the platform.

548
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,382
Oh, the platform.

549
00:43:21,382 --> 00:43:23,884
Oh, that! Ja! Yes.

550
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:44,905
From that fateful day

551
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:48,909
when stinking bits of slime
first crawled from the sea

552
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:52,913
and shouted to
the cold stars,

553
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:56,417
"I am man"

554
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,420
our greatest dread has
always been the knowledge

555
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,922
of our own mortality.

556
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:04,425
But tonight...

557
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:07,428
we shall have hurled
the gauntlet of science

558
00:44:07,428 --> 00:44:10,931
into the frightful face
of death itself!

559
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:15,436
Tonight...

560
00:44:15,436 --> 00:44:19,940
we shall ascend
into the heavens.

561
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,943
We shall mock
the earthquake.

562
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,947
We shall command
the thunders!

563
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:28,949
And penetrate...

564
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:31,952
into the very womb

565
00:44:31,952 --> 00:44:34,455
of impervious nature

566
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:36,957
herself!

567
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,968
When I give the word,
throw the first switch.

568
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,971
You've got it,
master.

569
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:56,477
Get ready...

570
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,981
Get set...

571
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,983
Go!

572
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,959
Throw the
second switch!

573
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:18,499
Throw the third switch!

574
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,502
Not the third switch.

575
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:25,005
Throw it, I say!
Throw it!

576
00:45:36,517 --> 00:45:38,519
Life!

577
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:41,522
Life! Do you hear me?

578
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:44,525
Give my creation...

579
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:47,027
life!

580
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:11,552
Turn everything off
and bring me down!

581
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:24,124
Nothing.

582
00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:25,125
Oh, doctor,
I'm sorry.

583
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:27,127
No, no.

584
00:47:27,628 --> 00:47:30,130
Be of good cheer.

585
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,634
If science teaches
us anything,

586
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:37,137
It teaches us
to accept our failures,

587
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:39,139
As well
as our successes...

588
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,142
with quiet...

589
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:45,145
dignity...

590
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:47,147
and grace.

591
00:47:57,658 --> 00:48:00,160
Son of a bitch bastard!
I'll get you for this!

592
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,162
What did you do to me?

593
00:48:02,663 --> 00:48:04,164
What did you do to me?

594
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:06,166
Stop it, doctor,
stop it!

595
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,168
You'll kill him!

596
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:09,169
Ah!

597
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,171
I don't
want to live!

598
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:14,925
I do not want to live.

599
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:19,680
Quiet dignity
and grace.

600
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,182
Ohhh, mama!

601
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,686
Oh, tosh!

602
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:28,689
This man is different,
i tell you.

603
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:31,692
You can see that after you
talk to him for five mintues.

604
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:35,579
Yes?

605
00:48:37,197 --> 00:48:39,700
He's a Frankenstein!

606
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,201
And they're all alike!

607
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:46,206
It's in their blood.
They can't help it.

608
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:49,209
All them scientists,
they're all alike!

609
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,712
They say they're
working for us,

610
00:48:51,712 --> 00:48:55,215
But what they really want
is to rule the world!

611
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,724
That's enough now!

612
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:07,227
I will not have this meeting
become a free-for-all.

613
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:10,230
These are serious charges,
you're making.

614
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,733
And all the more painful
to ask your elders,

615
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:18,739
Because we still have nightmares
from five times before.

616
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:22,242
Now, we haven't
heard from the one man

617
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:24,962
Most qualified to judge
the situation fairly.

618
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,249
Inspector Kemp.

619
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,135
Will you talk
to us, please?

620
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:03,283
A riot is
an ugly thing,

621
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:07,788
und once
you get one started,

622
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,792
there is little chance
of stopping it,

623
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:13,794
short of bloodshed.

624
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:16,797
I think...

625
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:20,801
before we go around
killing people,

626
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:24,304
we had better make
damn sure

627
00:50:24,304 --> 00:50:26,306
of our evidence.

628
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:29,309
Und...

629
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:37,818
we had better
confirm the fact

630
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:41,822
that young Frankenstein
is indeed

631
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:45,325
following in his
grandfather's footschtops!

632
00:50:45,325 --> 00:50:46,326
What?
What?

633
00:50:46,827 --> 00:50:49,329
Following in his grandfather's
footschtops!

634
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:50,831
Oh!
Oh!

635
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,333
I think...

636
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:57,337
what is in order...

637
00:50:57,337 --> 00:51:00,841
is for me
to pay a little visit

638
00:51:00,841 --> 00:51:02,843
on the good doctor,

639
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:08,849
und to have
a nice, quiet chat.

640
00:51:13,353 --> 00:51:15,856

Reputation...

642
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,363
Oh, doctor, you mustn't
do this to yourself.

643
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,366
You've got to stop
thinking about it.

644
00:51:26,366 --> 00:51:29,870
You haven't even
touched your food.

645
00:51:31,371 --> 00:51:32,372
There!

646
00:51:34,374 --> 00:51:36,209
Now I've touched it.
Happy?

647
00:51:38,044 --> 00:51:42,382
You know, I'll never
forget my old dad.

648
00:51:42,382 --> 00:51:44,885
When these things
happened to him,

649
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:47,521
the things
he'd say to me.

650
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:49,890
What did he say?

651
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:53,894
"What the hell are you
doing in the bathroom?"

652
00:51:53,894 --> 00:51:57,397
"Why don't you give
someone else a chance?!"

653
00:52:03,904 --> 00:52:07,407
Oh, maybe
it's better this way.

654
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:09,910
The poor, lifeless hulk.

655
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:26,243
Maybe it is
better off dead.

656
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:29,045
Mmmmm!

657
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:33,750
What
is this?

658
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,753
Schwartzwalder
kirsch torte.

659
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,755
Mmmmm!

660
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:39,756
Do you like it?

661
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:43,260
I'm not partial to desserts,
but this is excellent.

662
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,262
Who are you
talking to?

663
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:47,764
To you.

664
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,767
You just made
a yummy sound.

665
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,769
I didn't make
a yummy sound.

666
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:53,770
I asked you
what it is.

667
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,273
But you did.
I just heard it.

668
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,774
It wasn't me.

669
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,276
It wasn't me.

670
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,279
Look here, if it wasn't you,
and it wasn't you...

671
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,784
Mmmmm!

672
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,801
Mmmmm.

673
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,804
Alive!

674
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,806
It's alive!

675
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,893
It's alive!

676
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:36,813
Stand back.

677
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,824
Hello there.

678
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,826
I'm going to set
you free.

679
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,828
Mmmmm.

680
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,331
Is the sedative
ready?

681
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,999
Yes, doctor.

682
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,841
Mmmmm.

683
00:54:10,397 --> 00:54:12,849
I want you...

684
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:15,352
to sit up.

685
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:19,856
Mmmmm.

686
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,369
Stand...

687
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,454
on your feet.

688
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:36,873
Mmmmm.

689
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,375
Mmmmm.

690
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,127
You can do it.

691
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,347
Mmmmm.

692
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,389
Now...

693
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,690
walk.

694
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,365
Oh, doctor,
I'm frightened.

695
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,401
Don't worry.

696
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,406
Good.

697
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:12,909
Good!

698
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,412
Agggh!

699
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:16,413
Agggh!

700
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,914
What's
the matter?

701
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,916
Quick,
give him the--

702
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,918
Quick,
give him the--

703
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,420
Give him
the what?

704
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,924
Three syllables.
First syllable.

705
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,426
Sounds
like...

706
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,428
Head! Sounds
like head.

707
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,429
Bed...

708
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,930
uh, sed...

709
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,432
Sed!
Sed!

710
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:36,933
Sed...

711
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:38,435
second syllable.

712
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,937
Little word.
Zis, zat, zhe...

713
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:41,938
a...

714
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,440
oh!

715
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,441
Sed-a...

716
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,442
Sed-a...

717
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:48,945
Dirty word!
He said a dirty word!

718
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,447
Sounds like...

719
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,948
Uh... give!

720
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,451
Sed-a-give!

721
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,453
Give him
a sed-a-give!

722
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,455
Oh! Tive!

723
00:55:58,455 --> 00:55:59,956
Tive! Tive!
A sedative!

724
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,958
On the nosey!

725
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,462
Agggh!

726
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,464
Agggh!

727
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:22,979
Sed-a-give?!

728
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:34,491
Oh, Frederick,
are you all right?

729
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,992
Yes.

730
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,496
Would you excuse me
for one minute, dear?

731
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,498
Oh, of course,
doctor.

732
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:42,999
Igor.

733
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,501
Ahem.

734
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,503
May I speak to you
for a moment?

735
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,004
Of course.

736
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,506
Sit down, won't you?

737
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:50,507
Thank you.

738
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,511
No, up here.

739
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,512
Oh.

740
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,514
Thank you.

741
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:05,522
Now, that brain
that you gave me...

742
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,942
was it
Hans Delbruck's?

743
00:57:10,076 --> 00:57:11,027
No.

744
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,529
Ah!

745
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,030
Good.

746
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:19,035
Uh... would you
mind telling me

747
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,037
Whose brain,

748
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:23,039
I did put in?

749
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,041
And you won't be angry?

750
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:28,545
I will not
be angry.

751
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,547
Abby someone.

752
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,550
Abby someone.

753
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,051
Abby who?

754
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,553
Abby normal.

755
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,558
Abby normal.

756
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,561
I'm almost sure
that was the name.

757
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:53,570
Are you saying that
i put an abnormal brain

758
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:58,074
Into a 7-1/2-foot-long,

759
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:03,580
54-inch-wide...

760
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,582
gorilla?!

761
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:09,085
Is that what
you're telling me?

762
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,588
Quick,
give him the--

763
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:14,090
What? Three syllables?
Yes--

764
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:19,062
I wonder who that
could be at this hour?

765
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:26,603
Inga, quick!

766
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,605
See who that is.

767
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,608
You...
Put that thing

768
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,611
Back on the
operating table

769
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:39,115
and strap him
down tightly!

770
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,617
Where are
you going?

771
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,118
To wash up. I've
got to look normal.

772
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:46,623
We've all of us got
to behave normally.

773
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,626
Ha! Monsters!

774
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:57,133
Excellent shot.

775
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,635
This is
the 20th century.

776
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:01,638
Monsters are passe,
like ghosts and goblins.

777
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:05,141
Not to the good people
of this village,

778
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,143
herr doktor.

779
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:09,145
To them,

780
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:13,149
he is a very
real thing.

781
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:17,153
especially when
there is a Frankenstein

782
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:19,656
residing in this house.

783
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,672
Nice grouping.

784
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,173
Thank you.

785
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,178
I wouldn't think
an intelligent fellow like you

786
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:47,183
would fall for
this superstitious rot.

787
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,686
It is not superstition
that worries me,herr doktor,

788
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:53,439
but genes and chromosomes.

789
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,192
Rubbish!

790
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,193
Well you might say,

791
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,862
But this
is Transylvania.

792
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:05,418
Und you are
a Frankenstein.

793
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:10,707
You, uh...

794
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:14,210
seem unusually upset
by this discussion.

795
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,212
Not in the least.

796
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:17,213
Meoww!

797
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,215
I find it
extremely amusing.

798
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,721
Well, this was fun.

799
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:27,223
If you don't mind,
I'm a little bit tired.

800
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:30,226
Then I may give
the villagers

801
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,729
your complete
assurance

802
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,732
that you have
no interest whatsoever

803
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:38,234
in carrying on
your grandfather's work?

804
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,236
Mmmmm!

805
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,740
May I take that
for a yes?

806
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,241
Mmmmm.

807
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,743
Very well.

808
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,245
I think you can find
your way out?

809
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,247
Of course.

810
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:54,250
Until we meet again,

811
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,752
herr baron.

812
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,754
Yes, drop by
any time.

813
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,255
We are always open.

814
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:44,300
Oh, Victor.

815
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,802
Victor!

816
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:48,805
We have done it!

817
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:53,810
I'm going
to set you free.

818
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,812
Would you like that,

819
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,814
meine schatze kopf?

820
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,316
Mmmmm.

821
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:09,292
They wanted
to hurt you.

822
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,295
But I'm going
to help you.

823
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,300
Thank heavens
that's over with.

824
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,301
Frau Blucher!

825
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:22,305
Stop!

826
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:23,806
Don't come closer!

827
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:24,807
What are you doing?

828
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,809
I'm going to set
him free!

829
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,811
No!
No, you mustn't!

830
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:30,813
Yes!

831
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,815
Are you insane?

832
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:35,318
He'll kill you!

833
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,820
No, he won't.
Not this one.

834
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,823
He is as gentle
as a lamb.

835
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:43,826
Stand back,
for the love of God!

836
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:45,828
He has
a rotten brain!

837
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:48,331
It's not rotten!
It's a good brain!

838
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:50,333
It's rotten,
i tell you!

839
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,834
Rotten!

840
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,670
Ix-nay on
the otten-ray.

841
01:02:55,755 --> 01:02:56,839
I am not afraid.

842
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,342
I know what he likes.

843
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:00,843
Agggh!

844
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:16,359
That music!

845
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:19,862
Yes, it's in your blood.

846
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:22,865
It's in the blood
of all Frankensteins.

847
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:26,869
It reaches the soul
when words are useless.

848
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:28,871
Your grandfather
used to play it

849
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,873
to the creature
he was making.

850
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:32,341
It was you
all the time!

851
01:03:32,425 --> 01:03:33,376
Yes!

852
01:03:33,626 --> 01:03:35,878
You played that music
in the middle of the night!

853
01:03:35,962 --> 01:03:36,712
Yes!

854
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:37,880
To get us into
the laboratory!

855
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:39,382
Yes!

856
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:41,851
That was your cigar
smoldering in the ashtray!

857
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:42,885
Yes!

858
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,887
And it was you who left
my grandfather's book

859
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,389
out for me to find!

860
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:47,890
Yes!

861
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,892
Yes!
So that I would--

862
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,394
Then you
and Victor were...

863
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:52,895
yes!

864
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,397
Yes! Say it!

865
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:59,118
He was
my boyfriend!

866
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:01,904
Owwww!

867
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,406
Owwww!

868
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:04,907
Agggh! Agggh!

869
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,416
You'll never
catch him now!

870
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,917
He's free!

871
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,419
Do you hear?

872
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,971
Free!

873
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,059
Agggh!

874
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,928
Agggh!

875
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,437
Gone.

876
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,938
Gone!

877
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,441
We've got to find him,
you understand?

878
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:42,445
We've got to find him
before he kills someone.

879
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,947
What have I done?

880
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,950
Oh, God in heaven,

881
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,453
what have I done?

882
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,960
"Oh, I love"

883
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,463
"My pretty
little flower"

884
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,964
"Oh, I love"

885
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,966
"My pretty
little flower"

886
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:06,969
"Oh, I love
my flower"

887
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,972
Mmmmm.

888
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,479
When monster is loose,

889
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,481
Boards must be tight.

890
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,989
Thank God
you put Helga to bed.

891
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,491
With all this
monster business,

892
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,993
I take no chances.
I remember the last time.

893
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:33,496
But, papa, I told you

894
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,498
that I was turning
the rostbraten.

895
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,999
Don't you remember?

896
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,501
I asked you to put
Helga to--

897
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:48,010
Now throw a kiss
and say bye-bye.

898
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,516
Mmm-Mmm.

899
01:05:55,768 --> 01:05:58,521
Oh, dear.
Nothing left.

900
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,357
What shall we
throw in now?

901
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:08,030
Maybe she was
in the bathroom.

902
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,533
But I didn't
look upstairs.

903
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,536
I thought
you did.

904
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,038
You didn't
look upstairs?

905
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:19,542
Sit down.

906
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,461
Sit down!

907
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,055
Ahhh!

908
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,762
A visitor is all I ask.

909
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,264
A temporary companion
to help me

910
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:17,850
Pass a few short hours
in my lonely life.

911
01:07:18,651 --> 01:07:20,770
Agggh!

912
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,773
Thank you, Lord!

913
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,074
Thank you!

914
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:34,784
Mmmmm.

915
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,786
No, no. Don't speak.

916
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,788
Don't say a word.

917
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:42,291
My joy and my prize
from heaven.

918
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:45,795
You must've been
the tallest in your class.

919
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:49,298
My name is Harold,
and I live here all alone.

920
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:50,299
What's your name?

921
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,300
Mmmmm.

922
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:52,802
I didn't get that.

923
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,303
Mmmmm.

924
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,808
Oh. Forgive me.

925
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:01,811
I didn't realize
you were mute.

926
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,813
You see how
heaven plans?

927
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,315
Me, a poor blind man,

928
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,317
and you, a mute.

929
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:12,321
An incredibly big mute.

930
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,323
But, your hand
is frozen, my child.

931
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,826
How does a nice bowl
of soup sound?

932
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:17,827
Mmmmm.

933
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,841
I know what it means
to be cold and hungry,

934
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:33,843
Yes, and
how much it means

935
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:35,845
To have some kindness
from a stranger.

936
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,313
Are you ready for soup?

937
01:08:37,396 --> 01:08:39,315
Mmmmm.

938
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,852
Hold out
your bowl then.

939
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:48,357
Oh, my friend,
you don't know

940
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,359
what your visit
means to me,

941
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:54,363
how long I've waited
for another human being.

942
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:57,867
Owwww!

943
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:02,371
We tend to forget
the simple pleasures--

944
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:03,372
Owwww!

945
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:04,874
The basis for
true happiness.

946
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:08,377
Yes, yes, yes.
Oh...

947
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:11,881
A little wine
with your soup?

948
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:12,882
Mmmmm.

949
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:14,884
Good. Good. Good.

950
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:16,886
Mmmmm.

951
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:20,890
Mmmmm. Mmmmm.

952
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:25,394
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm,
mm-mmm.

953
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,897
Good. Good.
Yes, sir.

954
01:09:30,783 --> 01:09:32,401
Mmmmm.

955
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:33,402
Wait!

956
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:35,404
A toast.

957
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:36,906
A toast to...

958
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:37,907
Yes!

959
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,909
To long
friendship.

960
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,417
How hungry you
must have been.

961
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,420
Now for a
little surprise.

962
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,922
For a special
occasion,

963
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,924
I've been
saving...

964
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:00,930
Cigars.

965
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,431
Mmmmm?

966
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:03,933
Take one.

967
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:07,937
Mmmmm!

968
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:09,438
What?

969
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:10,940
Mmmmm!

970
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,942
No, no.
Fire is good.

971
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:13,943
Mmmmm!

972
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,444
Fire is
good-- Yes.

973
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,947
Fire is
our friend. Yes.

974
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,449
I'll show you.

975
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,452
Mmmmm mmmmm.

976
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:24,453
Mmmmm mmmmm.

977
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,455
Mmmmm...

978
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,960
You see?
You see?

979
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,461
Do you have
your cigar?

980
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:33,963
Let me see.

981
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:35,464
Let me see.

982
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:36,465
All right.

983
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,467
Now... now... now.

984
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:40,970
Just hold it
right there.

985
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:46,058
Now, don't inhale
until the tip glows.

986
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,482
Owwww!

987
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:55,985
Mmmmm!

988
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,987
Mmmmm!

989
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,989
Agggh!

990
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,490
Agggh!

991
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:05,494
Wait!

992
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,999
Wait!

993
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:12,501
Where are
you going?

994
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:15,004
I was going
to make espresso.

995
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,013
Agggh!

996
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:00,883
Now!

997
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,552
Agggh!

998
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:05,054
Agggh!

999
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,556
Hurry! Bring
the sedative!

1000
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:09,058
Agggh! Agggh!

1001
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:11,060
Agggh! Agggh!

1002
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,562
Owwww!

1003
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,066
Agggh!

1004
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:19,068
Agggh...

1005
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:21,570
Aggghmmmm...

1006
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,575
He's out!

1007
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:29,578
I know.

1008
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:41,056
I'm going in there.

1009
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,058
Bring me
that candle.

1010
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,560
Yes!
No! No!

1011
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:53,068
Love...
is the only thing

1012
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,571
That can save
this poor creature.

1013
01:12:56,071 --> 01:13:00,075
And I'm going to convince
him that he is loved

1014
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:05,080
Even at the cost
of my own life.

1015
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,082
No matter what
you hear in there,

1016
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:10,085
no matter how
cruelly I beg you,

1017
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:14,089
no matter how terribly
I may scream,

1018
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:16,592
do not open this door

1019
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:19,094
or you will undo
everything I've worked for.

1020
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:20,095
Do you understand?

1021
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:24,099
Do not open this door!

1022
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:25,217
Yes, doctor.

1023
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,104
Nice working
with you.

1024
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:59,635
Agggh!

1025
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,637
Mmmmm.

1026
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:04,640
Let me out.
Get me the hell out of here.

1027
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,143
What's the matter with you?
I was joking!

1028
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:10,646
Don't you know
a joke when you hear one?

1029
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,648
Ha ha ha!

1030
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:17,152
Jesus christ,
get me out of here!

1031
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,657
Open this goddamn door,

1032
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,659
Or I'll kick
your rotten heads in!

1033
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:24,660
Mommy!

1034
01:14:25,077 --> 01:14:26,662
Nein!

1035
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:28,163
Agggh!

1036
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:34,670
Oh, beautiful.

1037
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,176
Hello, handsome!

1038
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:47,182
You're a good-looking
fellow. Do you know that?

1039
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:51,186
People laugh at you.
People hate you.

1040
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:53,188
Why do they hate you?

1041
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:57,192
Because
they are jealous!

1042
01:14:57,192 --> 01:14:58,193
Mmmmm.

1043
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:03,198
Look at
that boyish face.

1044
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,652
Look at
that sweet smile.

1045
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,705
You want to talk about
physical strength?

1046
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:14,710
Do you want to talk
about sheer muscle?

1047
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,713
Do you want to talk
about the olympian ideal?

1048
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:21,216
You are a god!

1049
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:24,219
And listen to me.

1050
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,223
You are not evil.

1051
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,225
You...

1052
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:31,727
are...

1053
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:33,228
good!

1054
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:44,239
This is a nice boy.

1055
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,743
This is a good boy.

1056
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,746
This is
a mother's angel.

1057
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:54,249
And I want
the world to know,

1058
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:59,254
once and for all
and without any shame,

1059
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:03,258
that we love him!

1060
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,261
Oh...

1061
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:11,266
I'm going to
teach you how to walk,

1062
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:14,770
how to speak, how to move,
how to think.

1063
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,772
Together,

1064
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:21,276
you and I...
are going to make

1065
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:25,280
the greatest single
contribution to science

1066
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,784
since the creation
of fire!

1067
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:32,788
Dr. Fronkensteen,
are you all right?

1068
01:16:32,871 --> 01:16:35,290
My name...

1069
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:38,794
is Frankenstein!

1070
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,266
Distinguished
colleagues,

1071
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:36,268
ladies
and gentlemen,

1072
01:17:36,268 --> 01:17:39,771
it is my great privilege
of introducing to you

1073
01:17:39,771 --> 01:17:44,776
a man whose family name
was once both famous

1074
01:17:44,776 --> 01:17:47,779
and infamous.

1075
01:17:47,779 --> 01:17:50,282
And now,
may I present to you

1076
01:17:50,282 --> 01:17:54,453
Dr. Baron Frederick
Von Frankenstein.

1077
01:18:02,794 --> 01:18:04,296
My fellow scien--

1078
01:18:04,796 --> 01:18:06,298
Sssssssss!

1079
01:18:06,298 --> 01:18:08,800
--tists...

1080
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,801
and neurosurgeons,

1081
01:18:10,302 --> 01:18:12,304
ladies and gentlemen.

1082
01:18:12,304 --> 01:18:13,805
A few short weeks ago,

1083
01:18:13,805 --> 01:18:16,808
coming from a background
as conservative

1084
01:18:16,808 --> 01:18:20,312
and traditionally grounded in
scientific fact as any of you,

1085
01:18:20,312 --> 01:18:23,315
I began an experiment in--

1086
01:18:23,315 --> 01:18:26,318
incredulous
as it may sound--

1087
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:29,237
the reanimation
of dead tissue.

1088
01:18:32,324 --> 01:18:33,825
What I have
to offer you

1089
01:18:34,326 --> 01:18:36,328
might possibly be

1090
01:18:36,828 --> 01:18:39,831
the gateway
to immortality.

1091
01:18:44,836 --> 01:18:45,837
Ladies and gentlemen,

1092
01:18:46,338 --> 01:18:48,340
may I present
for your intellectual

1093
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,344
and philosophical
pleasure,

1094
01:18:52,344 --> 01:18:54,346
the creature!

1095
01:18:57,349 --> 01:18:59,801
Please!

1096
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:03,355
Remain in your seats,
i beg you!

1097
01:19:03,355 --> 01:19:05,357
We are not children here,

1098
01:19:05,357 --> 01:19:07,359
we are scientists.

1099
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:10,228
I assure you
there's nothing to fear.

1100
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:17,869
First, may I offer
for your consideration

1101
01:19:17,869 --> 01:19:19,871
a neurological
demonstration

1102
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:22,874
of the primary
cerebellar functions--

1103
01:19:22,874 --> 01:19:24,876
Balance

1104
01:19:24,876 --> 01:19:26,878
and coordination.

1105
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,384
Walk heel-to-toe.

1106
01:19:44,896 --> 01:19:46,898
Backwards!

1107
01:20:03,415 --> 01:20:05,417
Up until now, you've seen
the creature perform

1108
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:07,919
the simple mechanics
of motor activity.

1109
01:20:07,919 --> 01:20:09,921
But for what
you're about to see next,

1110
01:20:09,921 --> 01:20:15,260
we must enter quietly
into the realm of genius.

1111
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,932
Ladies and gentlemen,

1112
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:22,934
mesdames and messieurs,

1113
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:24,936
damen und herren,

1114
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,938
from what was once
an inarticulate mass

1115
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:29,941
of lifeless tissues,

1116
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:32,444
may I now present
a cultured,

1117
01:20:32,944 --> 01:20:34,446
sophisticated,

1118
01:20:34,946 --> 01:20:37,449
man about town.

1119
01:20:40,952 --> 01:20:42,454
Hit it!

1120
01:20:45,457 --> 01:20:46,958
"If you're blue"

1121
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:48,960
"and you don't know
where to go to"

1122
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,963
"why don't you go
where fashion sits"

1123
01:20:52,464 --> 01:20:54,966
"Mmmmin'
mm mmm ritz"

1124
01:20:56,468 --> 01:20:58,470
"Different types
who wear a day coat"

1125
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:00,472
"pants with stripes
or cutaway coat"

1126
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:02,474
"Perfect fit"

1127
01:21:03,475 --> 01:21:06,478
"Mmmmin'
mm mmm ritz"

1128
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:11,483
"Dressed up like
a million dollar trooper"

1129
01:21:11,983 --> 01:21:15,437
"tryin' mighty hard
to look like gary cooper"

1130
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,989
"Ooper dooper"

1131
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:20,492
"Come let's mix
where rockefellers"

1132
01:21:20,492 --> 01:21:22,494
"walk with sticks
or umbrellers"

1133
01:21:22,994 --> 01:21:23,995
"In their mitts"

1134
01:21:25,497 --> 01:21:28,450
"Mmmmin'
mm mmm ritz"

1135
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:21,553
Agggh!

1136
01:22:26,558 --> 01:22:29,561
It's nothing,
nothing, I tell you.

1137
01:22:29,561 --> 01:22:32,063
5, 6, 7, 8.

1138
01:22:34,566 --> 01:22:38,069
For God's sake. Are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

1139
01:22:42,774 --> 01:22:44,576
Please, I beg you!

1140
01:22:44,743 --> 01:22:47,529
For safety's sake,
don't humiliate him!

1141
01:22:49,581 --> 01:22:52,584
Come back!
Do you understand me?

1142
01:22:52,584 --> 01:22:54,586
I will not let you
destroy my work!

1143
01:22:54,586 --> 01:22:57,088
As your creator,
I command you to come back!

1144
01:22:57,589 --> 01:22:59,591
Agggh!

1145
01:23:01,593 --> 01:23:04,429
Agggh!

1146
01:23:51,142 --> 01:23:52,644
Chained...

1147
01:23:53,144 --> 01:23:56,648
chained like
a beast in a cage.

1148
01:23:56,648 --> 01:23:59,150
Oh, doctor,
I feel so terrible.

1149
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:01,152
There's only
one answer.

1150
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:04,155
If I could find a way
to equalize the imbalance

1151
01:24:04,155 --> 01:24:06,157
in his cerebral
spinal fluid,

1152
01:24:06,157 --> 01:24:09,661
why, he'd be as
right as rain.

1153
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:11,663
But how?

1154
01:24:11,663 --> 01:24:15,166
How? Before
it's too late.

1155
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:17,168
Oh, Frederick,

1156
01:24:17,168 --> 01:24:20,171
if only there was
some way I could...

1157
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:22,674
relieve all zis torture
you are going through.

1158
01:24:22,674 --> 01:24:25,176
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

1159
01:24:25,176 --> 01:24:27,178
Some way
I could help to...

1160
01:24:27,178 --> 01:24:28,680
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

1161
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,181
Relieve the tension.

1162
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:32,183
If there was
just some way

1163
01:24:32,684 --> 01:24:35,186
I could give you
a little peace.

1164
01:24:42,193 --> 01:24:44,195
Doctor, I have...

1165
01:24:44,195 --> 01:24:46,197
doctor?

1166
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:49,701
What is it?

1167
01:24:51,703 --> 01:24:53,705
Doctor?

1168
01:24:53,705 --> 01:24:55,206
Where are you?

1169
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:10,722
I'm sorry, doctor.

1170
01:25:10,722 --> 01:25:12,724
This cable came
while you were gone.

1171
01:25:12,724 --> 01:25:14,726
I thought I told you

1172
01:25:14,726 --> 01:25:18,730
never to interrupt me
while I'm working!

1173
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:20,732
I'm sorry,
doctor.

1174
01:25:21,232 --> 01:25:22,734
I thought this
was an emergency.

1175
01:25:23,234 --> 01:25:27,238
Your fiancee will be
arriving any second.

1176
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:28,239
What?

1177
01:25:28,740 --> 01:25:30,241
Elizabeth?
Here tonight?

1178
01:25:30,241 --> 01:25:34,746
Yes. I will go prepare
her room at once.

1179
01:25:34,746 --> 01:25:37,749
I suggest
you put on a tie.

1180
01:25:57,268 --> 01:25:58,269
Darling!

1181
01:25:58,269 --> 01:26:00,772
Darling!

1182
01:26:01,773 --> 01:26:02,774
Surprised?

1183
01:26:02,774 --> 01:26:03,775
Surprised.

1184
01:26:03,775 --> 01:26:04,776
Love me?

1185
01:26:04,776 --> 01:26:06,778
Love you.

1186
01:26:06,778 --> 01:26:08,279
Well...

1187
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,782
Let's turn in.

1188
01:26:10,782 --> 01:26:12,283
Darling!

1189
01:26:12,283 --> 01:26:14,786
It's been a long day.
I'm sure you're tired.

1190
01:26:14,786 --> 01:26:16,287
I'll just pay
the driver.

1191
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:17,789
Darling!

1192
01:26:18,156 --> 01:26:19,290
What?

1193
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:21,793
Surprised?

1194
01:26:21,793 --> 01:26:23,294
I, uh... Yes.

1195
01:26:23,795 --> 01:26:24,796
Love me?

1196
01:26:24,796 --> 01:26:25,797
Well...

1197
01:26:25,797 --> 01:26:27,298
Let's turn in.

1198
01:26:27,298 --> 01:26:28,800
Darling!

1199
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,801
Yes?

1200
01:26:29,801 --> 01:26:31,302
Say nothing.
Act casual.

1201
01:26:31,302 --> 01:26:32,303
Ready?

1202
01:26:32,303 --> 01:26:36,307
Yes.
I think-- Yes.

1203
01:26:36,307 --> 01:26:40,812
I am a bit tired
after all.

1204
01:26:40,812 --> 01:26:43,815
I'd like you to meet
my assistants Inga and Igor.

1205
01:26:43,815 --> 01:26:46,317
How do you do?

1206
01:26:46,317 --> 01:26:47,819
How do you do?

1207
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:50,321
This is my financier
Elizabeth.

1208
01:26:50,321 --> 01:26:52,323
I'm so happy
to meet you.

1209
01:26:52,323 --> 01:26:53,324
Financee.

1210
01:26:53,825 --> 01:26:55,326
Excuse me,
darling.

1211
01:26:55,326 --> 01:27:00,832
What is it exactly
that you do do?

1212
01:27:01,332 --> 01:27:04,335
Uh... well, I assist
Dr. Frankenstein

1213
01:27:04,335 --> 01:27:05,837
In the laboratory.

1214
01:27:05,837 --> 01:27:08,840
We have intellectual
discussions.

1215
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,843
We were just having one
as you were driving up.

1216
01:27:11,843 --> 01:27:12,844
Nein!

1217
01:27:14,846 --> 01:27:17,348
Igor, help me
with the bags.

1218
01:27:17,348 --> 01:27:19,350
Soitainly.
You take the blonde,

1219
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:21,352
I'll take the one
in the toiban.

1220
01:27:21,352 --> 01:27:23,354
Ggggrrrrr!

1221
01:27:23,354 --> 01:27:24,856
Ggggrrrrr!

1222
01:27:24,856 --> 01:27:26,357
Aah!

1223
01:27:26,357 --> 01:27:27,859
Stop that.

1224
01:27:28,359 --> 01:27:29,360
I'm talking about
the luggage.

1225
01:27:29,861 --> 01:27:31,863
Yes, master.

1226
01:27:31,863 --> 01:27:33,364
Ladies, this way.

1227
01:27:35,366 --> 01:27:36,868
It's gonna be
a long night.

1228
01:27:36,868 --> 01:27:38,870
If you need any help
with the girls--

1229
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,872
Get in there!

1230
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,877
Arrgh!

1231
01:27:45,877 --> 01:27:47,829
You settle down now.

1232
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:53,384
'Cause we're
gonna be pals.

1233
01:27:53,384 --> 01:27:54,385
Right?

1234
01:27:54,385 --> 01:27:56,888
Grrr...

1235
01:27:56,888 --> 01:27:59,390
Nice and cozy.

1236
01:27:59,891 --> 01:28:03,394
Just like
old friends. Heh.

1237
01:28:10,735 --> 01:28:11,903
Mmmmm.

1238
01:28:11,903 --> 01:28:13,404
What's
the matter?

1239
01:28:13,404 --> 01:28:15,907
You're afraid
of this fire?

1240
01:28:15,907 --> 01:28:17,408
This can't
hurt you.

1241
01:28:17,909 --> 01:28:18,910
See?

1242
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:20,912
Mmmmm!

1243
01:28:20,912 --> 01:28:23,414
Some monster
you are.

1244
01:28:23,414 --> 01:28:24,916
Mama was right.

1245
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:26,918
Little boys
ain't supposed

1246
01:28:26,918 --> 01:28:28,920
To play with fire.

1247
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,421
Mmmmm!

1248
01:28:30,421 --> 01:28:32,924
Because they
might get hurt!

1249
01:28:32,924 --> 01:28:33,925
Agggh!

1250
01:29:00,451 --> 01:29:02,453
Halt!

1251
01:29:02,453 --> 01:29:03,955
Up.

1252
01:29:04,455 --> 01:29:07,959
A riot is
an ugly thing...

1253
01:29:07,959 --> 01:29:11,963
und I think it is just
about time we had one!

1254
01:29:11,963 --> 01:29:14,465
Yeah! Yeah!

1255
01:29:14,799 --> 01:29:15,967
Kill the monster!

1256
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,969
As heaven is my witness--

1257
01:29:18,469 --> 01:29:19,470
Up--

1258
01:29:19,971 --> 01:29:23,474
He will curse the day

1259
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:27,478
That he was born
a Frankenstein!

1260
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:29,480
What?
What?

1261
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:32,483
I said he will
curse the day

1262
01:29:32,483 --> 01:29:34,485
That he was born
a Frankenstein.

1263
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,004
Loose!

1264
01:29:53,004 --> 01:29:55,006
He's broken loose!

1265
01:29:55,506 --> 01:29:57,508
Do you know
what that means?

1266
01:29:58,009 --> 01:30:01,012
Darling, you
mustn't worry so.

1267
01:30:03,014 --> 01:30:05,016
I suppose
you're right.

1268
01:30:05,016 --> 01:30:07,018
Of course I am.

1269
01:30:07,018 --> 01:30:09,020
Now come along
like a good boy.

1270
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:11,522
What would I do
without you?

1271
01:30:11,522 --> 01:30:13,524
Is your room
just down the hall

1272
01:30:13,524 --> 01:30:16,527
In case I get the frights
during the night?

1273
01:30:16,894 --> 01:30:19,530
Yes. But I thought
perhaps tonight,

1274
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:23,534
Under the circumstances,
i might stay here with you.

1275
01:30:23,868 --> 01:30:27,038
Would you want me
like this, now,

1276
01:30:27,538 --> 01:30:28,539
so soon before
our wedding,

1277
01:30:28,539 --> 01:30:32,043
so near we could
almost touch it?

1278
01:30:33,544 --> 01:30:34,545
Yes!

1279
01:30:35,046 --> 01:30:37,048
Whoa! Whoa, boy!

1280
01:30:37,048 --> 01:30:39,050
Or... Or...

1281
01:30:39,050 --> 01:30:41,552
to wait just a
little while longer

1282
01:30:42,053 --> 01:30:45,056
when I can give myself
without hesitation,

1283
01:30:48,559 --> 01:30:49,560
and legally yours?

1284
01:30:53,064 --> 01:30:55,066
That's a tough choice.

1285
01:30:55,566 --> 01:30:57,068
You're a tough guy.

1286
01:31:01,072 --> 01:31:02,573
I suppose
you're right.

1287
01:31:03,074 --> 01:31:05,576
Of course I am.
I always am.

1288
01:31:05,576 --> 01:31:08,079
Now give me a kiss
and say good night.

1289
01:31:11,582 --> 01:31:13,584
No tongues.

1290
01:31:20,591 --> 01:31:22,593
Good night, darling.

1291
01:31:22,593 --> 01:31:23,594
Uh-huh.

1292
01:31:23,594 --> 01:31:25,096
Good night, sweetheart.

1293
01:31:25,096 --> 01:31:26,097
Uh-huh.

1294
01:31:26,097 --> 01:31:27,598
I love you.

1295
01:31:27,598 --> 01:31:29,100
I love you.

1296
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,101
You love me?

1297
01:31:30,601 --> 01:31:32,103
I love you, honey.

1298
01:31:32,603 --> 01:31:34,105
Sweet dreams, darling.

1299
01:31:34,105 --> 01:31:37,608
Good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

1300
01:31:40,611 --> 01:31:42,697
Mmmmm...

1301
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:44,198
Agggh!

1302
01:31:44,198 --> 01:31:47,702
"He has loosed
the fateful lightning"

1303
01:31:48,202 --> 01:31:50,705
"of his terrible
swift sword"

1304
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:51,706
"His truth"

1305
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:54,208
"is marching on"

1306
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:56,210
"Da-aaa
da da da da da"

1307
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:57,211
"Glory"

1308
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:00,214
"Glory, hallelujah"

1309
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:02,216
"Glory"

1310
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:05,720
"Glory, hallelujah..."

1311
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:09,223
Aaahh!

1312
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,241
Mmmmm.

1313
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:58,272
Where am I?

1314
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:00,274
Aahhh!

1315
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:02,276
Who are you?

1316
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:04,278
What-- what do you
want to do to me?

1317
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:05,279
Mmmmm.

1318
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:09,784
Calm down.
I'm not afraid of you.

1319
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:12,286
How much do you want?
My father's very rich.

1320
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:14,288
You would have the world
at your fingertips.

1321
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:17,792
Listen, I have to be
back by 11:30.

1322
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:20,294
I'm expecting
a very important call.

1323
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:21,796
Mmmmm.

1324
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:24,298
Speak! Speak!
Why don't you speak?

1325
01:33:24,415 --> 01:33:25,800
What are you doing?

1326
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,803
Oh, you can't
be serious.

1327
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:30,805
Aaarrr.

1328
01:33:31,222 --> 01:33:32,807
I'm a-- I--

1329
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:35,810
Oh, my God.

1330
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:36,811
Woof.

1331
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:40,314
Mmmm.

1332
01:33:40,314 --> 01:33:42,817
I'm engaged.
And once he--

1333
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:44,318
But it was never...

1334
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:46,320
Ah! Ooh! Ah!

1335
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,323
Ahh! Ahh!

1336
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:51,325
"Oh"

1337
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:53,828
"Sweet mystery
of life"

1338
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:57,331
"at last
I've found you"

1339
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:58,833
Ahhhhh! "Oh"

1340
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:00,334
Ahhhhh!
"At last I know"

1341
01:34:00,334 --> 01:34:04,338
"the secret
of your arms"

1342
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:12,847
Shh!

1343
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:36,871
Penny for
your thoughts.

1344
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:39,874
Mmmmm!

1345
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:42,376
You're incorrigible!
Aren't you?

1346
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:44,879
You little
zipper neck.

1347
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:47,882
Mmmmm!

1348
01:34:47,882 --> 01:34:50,384
Oh, all right.

1349
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:53,888
Seven has always been
my lucky number.

1350
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:57,391
Come over here,
you hot monster.

1351
01:34:57,391 --> 01:34:58,893
Mmmm!

1352
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:01,896
What is it?

1353
01:35:01,896 --> 01:35:04,899
What's the matter?

1354
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:06,901
Is it that music?

1355
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:09,403
It's probably from
some nearby cottage.

1356
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:12,907
Nothing to worry about.
Where are you going?

1357
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:15,409
Oh, you men are all alike.

1358
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:18,412
Seven or eight quick ones
and you're off with the boys

1359
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:19,914
to boast and brag.

1360
01:35:20,414 --> 01:35:22,416
You better keep
your mouth shut!

1361
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:24,418
Oh, I think I love him.

1362
01:36:10,965 --> 01:36:13,968
Oh, look!
He's coming back!

1363
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:15,803
Oh, look! Your music!

1364
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:17,471
Oh, keep playing!

1365
01:36:17,471 --> 01:36:21,475
It's the music
that's bringing him back!

1366
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:26,063
Come on.

1367
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:35,823
Come on.
Come on.

1368
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:43,497
Come on!
You can do it!

1369
01:36:48,118 --> 01:36:52,006
Come-- Come on!
You can do it!

1370
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:56,510
Agggh!

1371
01:36:57,511 --> 01:36:59,013
Don't touch him!

1372
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:02,016
He wants to
do it by himself!

1373
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:04,018
You can do it!

1374
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:06,020
You can do it!

1375
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:09,023
Please!
My creation!

1376
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:13,561
Agggggh!

1377
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:20,317
Quick! Catch him!

1378
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,543
Have the preparations been
made for the transference?

1379
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:31,545
Yes, doctor.

1380
01:37:31,545 --> 01:37:33,547
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

1381
01:37:34,048 --> 01:37:37,051
It's the only thing
that can save him now.

1382
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:39,553
You realize you're
risking both your lives?

1383
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:44,058
Yes.

1384
01:37:57,571 --> 01:37:59,573
I'll switch
it off!

1385
01:38:19,093 --> 01:38:21,595
How will I know
when they are done?

1386
01:38:21,595 --> 01:38:24,598
The doctor said
to allow fifteen minutes--

1387
01:38:24,765 --> 01:38:27,601
Not one second
more or less.

1388
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:39,113
How long now?

1389
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,614
Two more minutes.

1390
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:47,121
Ein, zwei, drei!

1391
01:38:48,122 --> 01:38:50,624
Ein, zwei, drei!

1392
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:54,128
Ein, zwei, drei!

1393
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:04,138
What's
that noise?

1394
01:39:04,638 --> 01:39:05,639
I don't know.

1395
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:06,640
What time is it?

1396
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:07,641
Almost time.

1397
01:39:12,429 --> 01:39:13,981
Oh, my God,
it's the villagers!

1398
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:18,736
No! No!

1399
01:39:18,736 --> 01:39:21,689
Please!
Just another seven seconds!

1400
01:39:25,492 --> 01:39:28,162
No! No!

1401
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:31,165
No! No! No!

1402
01:39:31,165 --> 01:39:33,167
Put that
man down!

1403
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:34,668
It's the monster!

1404
01:39:34,668 --> 01:39:35,669
Nah, can't be!

1405
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:39,423
I said put
that man down!

1406
01:39:48,682 --> 01:39:51,185
And just who do you
think you are

1407
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:54,188
That you order
these people about?

1408
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:56,190
I am the monster!

1409
01:39:57,191 --> 01:40:00,694
Ja. I see that
you are the monster.

1410
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:03,697
As long as I can remember,

1411
01:40:03,697 --> 01:40:06,700
people have hated me.

1412
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:10,204
they looked at
my face and my body

1413
01:40:10,204 --> 01:40:12,206
and they ran away
in horror.

1414
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:13,707
In my loneliness,

1415
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:16,210
I decided that if i
could not inspire love,

1416
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:18,712
which was my deepest hope,

1417
01:40:19,213 --> 01:40:21,582
I would instead cause fear!

1418
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:24,718
I live...

1419
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:30,724
because this poor
half-crazed genius

1420
01:40:30,724 --> 01:40:32,726
has given me life.

1421
01:40:32,726 --> 01:40:35,729
He alone held
an image of me

1422
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:37,731
as something beautiful.

1423
01:40:37,731 --> 01:40:41,735
Then, when it would
have been easy enough

1424
01:40:41,735 --> 01:40:43,237
to stay out of danger,

1425
01:40:43,737 --> 01:40:47,191
he used his own body
as a guinea pig

1426
01:40:47,274 --> 01:40:50,744
to give me a calmer brain.

1427
01:40:50,744 --> 01:40:55,249
And a somewhat more
sophisticated way

1428
01:40:55,249 --> 01:40:57,751
of expressing myself.

1429
01:40:57,751 --> 01:41:00,254
Well, this is,
of course,

1430
01:41:00,254 --> 01:41:02,256
an entirely
different situation.

1431
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:04,758
As the leader of
this community,

1432
01:41:04,758 --> 01:41:07,261
may I be the first

1433
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:10,764
to offer you my
hand in friendship?

1434
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:18,772
Thank you.

1435
01:41:18,772 --> 01:41:20,774
You are
entirely welcome.

1436
01:41:20,774 --> 01:41:22,776
But now let us all
go to my house

1437
01:41:22,776 --> 01:41:25,779
for sponge cake
und a little wine.

1438
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:28,782
Und shit.

1439
01:41:31,285 --> 01:41:33,787
To the lumberyard!

1440
01:41:49,803 --> 01:41:51,805
"Da dum da-dum"

1441
01:41:51,805 --> 01:41:54,308
"Dee dum da-dum"

1442
01:41:54,308 --> 01:41:56,810
"Dee dum da da dum..."

1443
01:41:57,311 --> 01:42:00,314
Hello... Mrs. Frankenstein.

1444
01:42:00,814 --> 01:42:02,316
Mrs. Frankenstein.

1445
01:42:02,316 --> 01:42:04,318
What a beautiful name!

1446
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:05,819
Oh, darling.

1447
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:08,322
Hold on
to your hat.

1448
01:42:08,322 --> 01:42:09,823
What?

1449
01:42:09,823 --> 01:42:13,327
I'll be right back.

1450
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:17,831
W-W-W-Wow!

1451
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:19,833
W-W-W-W-Wow!

1452
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:21,335
Oh, ho, ho!

1453
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:23,837
"Dee dum da-dum"

1454
01:42:23,837 --> 01:42:25,339
"Dee da da..."

1455
01:42:27,341 --> 01:42:31,345
I'm holding on
to it, darling.

1456
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:33,847
Just a few
more seconds!

1457
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:07,381
"La dum"

1458
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:09,383
"Da da da dee dee"

1459
01:43:09,383 --> 01:43:10,384
"La da da"

1460
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:12,386
"La-aa da dum"

1461
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:13,887
"La da da"

1462
01:43:13,887 --> 01:43:17,891
I hope you didn't find
daddy's party too boring.

1463
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:21,895
He did it just for you.
Say you liked it.

1464
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:22,896
Mm-Hmm.

1465
01:43:22,896 --> 01:43:25,399
Honey, did you see?

1466
01:43:25,399 --> 01:43:28,402
I put a hamper in
just for your shirts.

1467
01:43:28,402 --> 01:43:31,905
The other one is just for
socks and poo-poo undies.

1468
01:43:32,406 --> 01:43:33,824
Here I come.

1469
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:37,911
Hhhhh!

1470
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:41,415
"Tchi-tchi
tchi-tchi-tchi"

1471
01:43:41,415 --> 01:43:42,916
"Tchi-tchi-tchi
tchi tchi tchi"

1472
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:46,420
"Doo doo-doo
doo-doo doo doo"

1473
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:48,922
"Da-da da da
da-da da"

1474
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:49,923
Tsssssst!

1475
01:43:51,258 --> 01:43:54,428
Mmmmmmmm.

1476
01:43:54,428 --> 01:43:57,431
Mmmmm.

1477
01:43:58,932 --> 01:44:01,435
Mmmmm!

1478
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:02,436
Mmmmm!

1479
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:04,938
The feeling
is mutual.

1480
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:08,942
You know,
it's a puzzlement.

1481
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:11,945
There's something
I've always wanted to ask you,

1482
01:44:12,446 --> 01:44:13,947
about that operation.

1483
01:44:14,448 --> 01:44:16,950
You know,
in the transference part,

1484
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:19,953
the monster got part
of your wonderful brain.

1485
01:44:20,454 --> 01:44:23,457
But what did you
ever get from him?

1486
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:31,465
Mmmmmmmm!

1487
01:44:31,965 --> 01:44:32,966
No! Ooh!

1488
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:34,968
I don't believe--Ow!

1489
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:37,471
Ahh! Oh! Oh!

1490
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:38,972
"Oh"

1491
01:44:38,972 --> 01:44:40,974
"Sweet mystery of life"

1492
01:44:41,475 --> 01:44:44,478
"at last I've found you..."
