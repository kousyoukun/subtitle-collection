让我们先隔开头颅. . 
If we look at the base of a brain

18
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:14,612
来看看脑的底部. . 
which has just been removed from a skull

19
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,808
很显然地我们 就能看见小小的中脑
there's very little midbrain that we can actually see.

20
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:21,782
不错，正如我们上周讲到的. . 
Yet, as I demonstrated in my lecture last week

21
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,790
如果把聂叶的底部. . 
if the under aspects of the temporal lobes

22
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,452
撒开. . 
are gently pulled apart...

23
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:33,123
我们就能看见脑的上部的干
the upper portion of the stem of the brain can be seen.

24
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,001
也就是我们说的脑干 它是由中脑. . 
The so-called brainstem consists of the midbrain

25
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:44,005
一圆形的脑桥. . 
a rounded protrusion called the pons...

26
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:49,146
以及一向下的尖端细的茎 也就是我们说的延髓. . 
and a stalk tapering downwards called the medulla oblongata

27
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,843
延髓通过枕骨大孔 向头颅外延伸. . 
which passes out of the skull through the foramen magnum...

28
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,510
当然，它的后端. . 
and becomes, of course...

29
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,555
就会与脊髓相联
the spinal cord.

30
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,649
有什么疑问吗？
Are there any questions before we proceed?

31
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:02,023
我有个问题，弗兰肯斯坦恩
I have one question, Dr. Frankenstein.

32
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,064
是弗朗肯斯丁恩
That's Fronkensteen.

33
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:09,066
什么？
I beg your pardon?

34
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:12,763
我的名字-- 是弗朗肯斯丁恩
My name... it's pronounced Fronkensteen.

35
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:14,271
难道你不是著名的. . 
Aren't you the grandson...

36
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,308
的医生维克托. 弗兰肯斯坦恩的孙子吗. . 
of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein

37
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,072
他曾在墓地 挖出一具刚埋的尸体. . 
who went into graveyards, dug up freshly buried corpses

38
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,238
然后把那些死去的器官--

是的，是的
Yes! Yes!

好的
Yes.

41
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,178
我们大家都知道他做过什么
We all know what he did.

42
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,954
但你应该记住的是我. . 
But I'd rather be remembered...

43
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,150
为科学作出的一些小小的贡献. . 
for my own small contributions to science...

44
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:36,661
而不是我巧好跟一个. .

不妨说说你想问的问题吧？
You mind telling me your question?

49
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,141
先生，我对于. . 
STUDENT: Sir, I'm not sure I understand the distinction

50
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,975
反射性及自律性的 脉冲之间的关系不是很明白
between reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses.

51
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,137
很好
Very good.

52
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:58,011
我们今天的课 正是要展示这一区别.
Since our lab today demonstrates just that distinction

53
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,710
那我们何不继续下去呢

Mr. Hilltop, would you hop up on your feet

60
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:25,610
站到桌子旁吗？
and stand beside this table?

61
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,988
很好
Nice hopping.

黑尔先生. . 
Mr. Hilltop...

00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,628
可以抬起. . 
would you raise...

64
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:47,325
你的左腿吗？
your left knee, please?

65
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:53,301
你们刚刚看到的就是自律性脉冲
You have just witnessed a voluntary nerve impulse.

66
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,466
一开始是由大脑的皮层受到刺激. . 
It begins as a stimulus from the cerebral cortex

67
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,137
通过脑干 然后向各个神经肌肉发送信息
passes through the brainstem and to the various muscles involved.

68
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:02,213
黑尔先生，你可以放下腿了
Mr. Hilltop, you may lower your knee.

69
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,715
反射性的脉冲. . 
Reflex movements...

70
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:08,048
是人体自然的反应. . 
are those which are made independently of the will

[Students gasp]

76
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,061
我们自己并没有意识到这种电脉冲
We are not aware of these impulses.

77
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,725
也没有让它们. . 
Neither do we intend them...

78
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:25,065
来刺激我们肌肉的收缩
to carry out our contraction of muscles.

79
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,469
但如你们自己看到的 它们是自己无意识中发出的
Yet, as you can see, they work by themselves.

80
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,064
如果我们用一种普通的金属夹
But what if we blocked the nerve impulse

81
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,110
在局部地方施加一点压力--
by simply applying local pressure

82
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,907
来封闭这种脉冲动
which can be done with any ordinary metal clamp

83
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,073
就在这个突起的地方. . 
just at the swelling...

84
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:40,117
也就是后部的神经根--
on the posterior nerve roots...

85
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,783
用差不多. . 
for, oh, say...

five or six seconds?

你他妈的王八蛋
Why, you mother-grabbing bastard!

88
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,157
你们可以看得到 一点反应都没有了
As you can see, all communication is shut off.

[Students gasp]

91
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:02,507
尽管医学科技越来越先进
In spite of our mechanical magnificence

92
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:06,010
但是如果没有电脉冲. . 
if it were not for this continuous stream

93
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,170
给我们提供生命力. . 
of motor impulses

94
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,214
那我们. . 
we would collapse...

95
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:14,013
就会像一束. . .绿菜花！
like a bunch of... broccoli!

Aieeeaah!

97
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,559
所以，要注意的是--
In conclusion, it should be noted...

98
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,060
多给他一些钱
Give him an extra dollar.

99
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:24,891
多给一些钱，好的，先生
ATTENDANT: Extra dollar. Yes, sir.

100
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:28,228
--比起其它的一些伤来. . 
FRANKENSTEIN: That any more than common injury

101
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,394
神经根受到的伤更严重. . 
to the nerve root is always serious

102
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,564
因为只要有一根 神经纤维受到伤害. . 
because once a nerve fiber is severed

103
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,770
那么无论什么名丹妙药. . 
there is no way in heaven or on earth

104
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:42,069
都无法起死回生
to regenerate life back into it.

105
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,308
下课之前还有什么想要问的吗？
Are there any last questions before we leave?

106
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,350
弗兰肯--
Uh, Dr. Frank...

107
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,986
-弗朗肯斯丁恩医生 -什么？
- Fronkensteen. - Yes?

108
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,488
达尔文曾把一根面条. . 
Isn't it true...

109
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,923
放在一个玻璃容器. . 
that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli...

110
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,289
然后通过一些特殊的方法. . 
in a glass case...

111
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,294
那根面条开始随意运动. . 
until, by some extraordinary means...

112
00:09:57,362 --> 00:10:00,957
难道这不是真的吗？
it actually began to move with a voluntary motion?

113
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:04,161
是蚯蚓还是意大利细面条呢？
Are you speaking of the worm or the spaghetti?

114
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:08,464
蚯蚓，先生
Why, the worm, sir.

115
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,600
是的，当我是个学生的时候. . 
FRANKENSTEIN: Yes. I did read something of that incident

116
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,768
也读到过这种事. . 
when I was a student...

117
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,812
但是你必须记住的是. . 
but you have to remember that a worm...

118
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:16,847
蚯蚓是极少极少的一种例外. . 
with very few exceptions...

119
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:19,349
它毕竟不是人
is not a human being.

120
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,510
[Students laughing]

121
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,851
但是你祖父所研究的学术--
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfather's work

122
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:26,186
不就是让死去的机体组织再复活吗？
the reanimation of dead tissue?

123
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:29,694
我祖父是个病态的人
My grandfather was a very sick man.

124
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:32,195
但你既然是他的孙子. . 
STUDENT: But as a Fronkensteen...

125
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,289
难道就对此事一点好奇都没有吗？
aren't you the least bit curious about it?

126
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:37,199
难道让一个人起死回生. . 
Doesn't the bringing back to life what was once dead

127
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,793
就激不起你的一点点兴趣？
hold any intrigue for you?

128
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,204
你所说的这些完全 就是一些无意义的疯话. . 
You're are talking about the nonsensical ravings

129
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,866
极端愚蠢的话
of a lunatic mind.

130
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:45,910
死了就是死了
Dead is dead!

131
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,412
但可以看看是否可以从内脏着手
STUDENT: But look what's been done with hearts and kidneys.

132
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,415
内脏是可以修复的玩具
Hearts and kidneys are tinker toys!

133
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:53,678
我讲的是中枢神经系统
I'm talking about the central nervous system!

134
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:54,844
但，先生--
But, sir...

135
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,014
我是个科学家 不是哲学家
I am a scientist, not a philosopher!

136
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,422
你有更多的机会 修复受损的神经系统. . 
You have more chance of reanimating this scalpel

137
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,756
而不是让这把刀复活
than you have of mending a broken nervous system!

138
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,955
但是你祖父的学术怎么解释呢，先生？
But what about your grandfather's work, sir?

139
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,726
我祖父的学术是胡扯蛋
FRANKENSTEIN: My grandfather's work was doo-doo!

140
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,626
我对死人不感兴趣
I am not interested in death!

141
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:13,466
我唯一关心的是. . 
The only thing that concerns me...

142
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,007
现在的还活着的人们
is the preservation of life!

143
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,546

IGOR: Wait, master.

443
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,008
一定很危险
It might be dangerous.

444
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,103
你先进
You go first.

445
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,623
这个地方没电的吗？
FRANKENSTEIN: Aren't there any lights in this place?

446
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:58,159
有两个很难看的开关
IGOR: Two nasty-looking switches here.

447
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,629
我不先碰
I'm not going to be first.

448
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:01,858
FRANKENSTEIN: Ohh.

449
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,068
你这双该死的眼睛
Damn your eyes!

450
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,198
太晚了
Too late.

451
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:21,610
INGA: Ohhh.

452
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:25,817
这就是那个所有事情发生的地点
FRANKENSTEIN: So this is where it all happened.

453
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,301
想想看
VICTOR: Just think.

454
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,768
一个死了的头脑. . 
A dead brain...

455
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:42,305
会再一具新的身体里复活
ready to live again in a new body.

456
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:45,831
看，没有血，没有腐烂
Look. No blood. No decomposition.

457
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,537
只有几处缝合的地方
Just a few sutures.

458
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:48,703
打开总开关
Throw the main switch!

459
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,474
是，先生
ASSISTANT: Yes, master.

460
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:59,485
太乱了
FRANKENSTEIN: What a filthy mess!

461
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,024
几幅图，一点点花草. . 
IGOR: A little paint, a few flowers...

462
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:03,616
还有两个废弃的枕头. . 
couple of throw pillows...

463
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,799
我们那个神秘的小提琴家好像消--
FRANKENSTEIN: It seems our mysterious violinist has disa

464
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:13,328
消什么？
INGA: Disa what?

465
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,167
消失了
IGOR: Ppeared.

466
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:18,640
那扇门后有光
FRANKENSTEIN: There's a light coming from behind that door.

467
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,312
跟我来
Follow me.

468
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,303
医生，看
INGA: Doctor, look!

469
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,013
FRANKENSTEIN: Well...

470
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,072
这就可以解释音乐了
this explains the music.

471
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:01,442
还是暖的
IGOR: It's still warm.

472
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,611
FRANKENSTEIN: Hmmm.

473
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:04,551
是谁拉过呢？
INGA: Who was playing it?

474
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:07,386
不管是谁. . 
FRANKENSTEIN: Whoever it was...

475
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,982
刚刚吸完雪茄
barely finished putting out his cigar.

476
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,029
这些事太奇怪了
Such strange goings on.

477
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,361
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

478
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,561
音乐房吗？
IGOR: Music room?

479
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,562
这里只有书和材料
INGA: There's nothing here but books and papers!

480
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,199
书和材料
FRANKENSTEIN: Books and papers!

481
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:30,038
这是我祖父的私人图书室
This is my grandfather's private library!

482
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,240
我感觉得到
I feel it!

483
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:35,183
看，看这里
Look! Look at this!

484
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,128
[Grunting]

485
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:52,126
直到，黑暗里. . 
FRANKENSTEIN: "Until, from this darkness...

486
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:55,229
有一道光突然射到我身上

一道非常明亮. .

而又简单的光--

把电极从最大变到最小. . 
"change the poles from plus to minus...

00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,740
“从最小变到最大”

491
00:33:07,818 --> 00:33:11,015
[Panting]

492
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:13,386
只有我一个人成功的发现了. . 
"I alone succeeded in discovering...

493
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,016
生命基因的秘密
"the secret of bestowing life.

494
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:18,185
更重要的是. . 
"Nay, even more...

495
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:20,263

“让死去的东西再复活！”
"upon lifeless matter!"

498
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:37,507
成功了
It could work!

499
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,393
腌鱼？
FRANKENSTEIN: Kipper?

500
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,661
谢谢你，医生
INGA: Thank you, Doctor.

501
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,405
有一个微小的细节问题 影响了我的研究速度
"The minuteness of the parts formed a hindrance to my speed.

502
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,843
因此，我下定决心要造出一个. . 
"I resolved, therefore, to make the creature

504
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,547
当然
Of course!

505
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,054
那就会简化一切东西
That would simplify everything.

他的手，脚，器官. .

都得比常人的大
would all have to be increased in size.

508
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,597
不错
Exactly.

509
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:31,198
那他必须有很大的神经组织系统
He would have an enormous schwanstugel.

510
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:38,907
那还用说
That goes without saying.

511
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:40,940
Woof!

512
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,510
他会非常受欢迎的
He'll be very popular.

513

我们的目的是. . 
What we're aiming for...

他必须有七英尺高. .

这个？
this?

哈罗
FRANKENSTEIN: Hello!

520
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:08,630
你已经画出来了
You've caught something there.

521
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:12,267
天然的，是的.简单的，是的 也许还有些怪异
Crude, yes. Primitive, yes. Perhaps even grotesque.

522
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,835
一些说不清的感觉告诉我. . 
Yet, something inexplicable tells me...

523
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:20,475
这个也许就是我们要找的人
that this might be our man.

524
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,594
好了
All right.

525
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,103
这对他来说就已经足够了
That's good enough for the likes of him.

526
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,814
插下去吧
FRANKENSTEIN: Get down.

527
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,725
快些
Now.

528
00:36:39,763 --> 00:36:42,425
真是恶心
FRANKENSTEIN: What a filthy job!

529
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:43,693
也许会更糟
IGOR: Could be worse.

530

怎么个糟法？
How?

531
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,061
也许会下雨
Could be raining.

00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,449
需要帮助吗
CONSTABLE: Need a hand?

535
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,924
不用，谢谢了
FRANKENSTEIN: Uh, no, thanks.

536
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:46,326
我有个助手，谢谢

好像从没见过你
I've never seen your face before.

我是弗勒迪.弗朗肯斯丁恩医生. .

见到你很高兴
How very nice to meet you.

545

你的手凉的刺骨
CONSTABLE: You're chilled to the bone!

546
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,817
烤烤火会好些的
A warm fire's just the thing.

547
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:18,452
有一点御寒的酒就更不错了
A nip from the bottle wouldn't be too bad.

548
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,996
不错
That's the ticket!

549
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:24,932

这真是具有深远意义又虔诚的晚上

你弄好了吗？
Are you ready?

579

你敢肯定是这样做吗？
IGOR: Are you sure this is how?

580
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:56,674
不错，书上就是这么写的
Yes! It's all written in the notes!

系好风筝赶紧下来
Tie the kites and hurry down!

582
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:01,315
为什么要快些下来？
What's the hurry?

583
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:04,115
也许你会被电死
There's a possibility of electrocution!

584
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,449
你听到了吗？
Do you understand?

我说，你也许会被电死

你已经. .

你已经系好风筝了吗？
Did you tie the kites?

590

当然
IGOR: Of course.

591
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,369

去检查一下发电机

艾哥尔. .

是，先生
IGOR: Yes, master.

598
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:57,732
你能想像汗.德克的脑 在这具身体里吗？
Can you imagine Hans Delbruck's brain in this body?

599
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,776
弗勒迪
INGA: Oh, Frederick.

600

这一刻就要到了
This is the moment.

601

亲爱的，你准备好了吗？
Well, dear, are you ready?

602

现在？在这里？
Now? Right here?

605
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:19,557
是的，把平台升上去
Yes, yes. Raise the platform.

606
00:43:19,629 --> 00:43:21,790
平台
Oh, the platform.

607
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,799
是的，那个
Oh, that! Ja!

608
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,916
自从开天僻地那天. . 
From that fateful day...

609
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:49,151
一把泥土从海中爬起. . 
when stinking bits of slime first crawled from the sea

610
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,161
对着冷冷的星空高喊. . 
and shouted to the cold stars...

611

“我是人. . .”
"I am man..."

612
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:59,865
从那一刻起我们就知道. . 
our greatest dread has always been the knowledge

613
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,530
死亡也随之而来

但是今晚. . 
But tonight...

615
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,475
我们要推翻这种定论. . 
we shall have hurled the gauntlet of science

616
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:10,877
让人们从死亡中解脱出来
into the frightful face of death itself!

617
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,643
今晚. .

我们要升上天堂

619
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,382
[Thunder]

620

我们要嘲笑地震

我们要呼风唤雨
We shall command the thunders!

622
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:31,863
我们要浸入子宫. .

那一块天然的圣地. . 
of impervious nature...

624
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:36,665
入她的核心

625
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,174
[Thunder]

626
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:48,414
听我说，开第一道开关
When I say, throw the first switch.

627
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:51,921
知道了，先生
You've got it, master.

628
00:44:55,091 --> 00:44:56,285
好了. . 
Get ready...

629
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:01,586

开第三道开关
Throw the third switch!

633
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:21,840
不是第道
Not the third switch.

634
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:24,887
开，听我的
Throw it, I say!

635
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,126
生命
Life!

636

生命，你听到我在说话了吗
Life! Do you hear me?

给我的创造物. .

把所有的东西都关上 让我下来
Turn everything off! Bring me down!

640
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:24,237
什么动静都没有
FRANKENSTEIN: Nothing.

641
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:25,672
医生，我很抱歉
INGA: Doctor, I'm sorry.

642

不，不
FRANKENSTEIN: No, no.

643
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:30,341
高兴点
Be of good cheer.

644
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:32,608
如果说科学 教会了我们什么的话. . 
If science teaches us anything...

645
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,150
那就是接受失败. . 
it teaches us to accept our failures...

646
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,051
要像接受成功时一样. . 
as well as our successes...

647
00:47:40,623 --> 00:47:46,960
充满风度和尊严
with quiet dignity and grace.

648
00:47:57,907 --> 00:48:00,341
龟孙子，我要掐死你
Son of a bitch bastard, I'll get you for this!

649
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:04,210
你为什么要这样对我？
What did you do to me?

650
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,373
住手
INGA: Stop it!

651
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:07,780
你会杀了他的

652
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,782
INGA: Ah!

653
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,445
我不想活了
FRANKENSTEIN: I don't want to live!

654

我不想活了. .

非常有风度和尊严

656
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,561
妈妈
FRANKENSTEIN: Ohhh, Mama!

657
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,636
这个人有些不同
ELDER: This man is different.

658
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:32,004
只要你们跟他稍微说上几句话 就会知道的
You can see that after you've talked to him for five minutes.

659
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,768
是吗？
SECOND ELDER: Yes?

660
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,245
他是一个人形怪物
He's a Frankenstein!

661
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,077
他们都是一样的
They're all alike!

662
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,482
是的
CROWD: Yeah!

663
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,947
这是他们的血统 是遗传，无法改变的
It's in their blood. They can't help it.

664
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,754
所有的科学家都是一样的
All them scientists are alike.

665

他们说他们是为了我们好
They say they're working for us.

666
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:56,358
但实际上 他们想的是统治这个世界
What they really want is to rule the world.

667
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,727
[Pounding]

668
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:01,862
安静
SECOND ELDER: Settle down.

669
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,036
够了
That's enough now!

670
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,599
我可不想让这场会议 变成一场混战
I won't have this meeting become a free-for-all.

671
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:10,441
你们的这些控诉 是个很严重的问题. . 
These are very serious charges you're making

672
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:13,073
对我们来说更痛苦，你们的长辈. . 
and all the more painful to us, your elders

673
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:18,052
因为我们还处在以前的恶梦中
because we still have nightmares from five times before.

674
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:22,289
我们还没有听. . 
We haven't heard from the man...

675
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:25,156
这里最有资格发言的人
most qualified to judge the situation fairly.

676
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,822
探长克姆帕
Inspector Kemp.

677
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,334
你可以跟我们讲几句吗
Will you talk to us, please?

678
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:03,890
暴乱是件很不光彩的事. . 
A riot is an ugly thing...

679
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:08,267
一旦你们有了开始. . 
and once you get one started...

680
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,104
就不会有办法. . 
there is little chance of stopping it...

681
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,166
阻止流血事件
short of bloodshed.

682
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:17,002
我认为. . 
I think...

683
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,880
在我们要杀一个人之前. . 
before we go around killing people...

684
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:23,646
我们最好要有. . 
we had better make damn sure...

685
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,684
确凿的证据
of our evidence.

686
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,016
而且. . 
Und...

687
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,959
肯定这个事实. . 
we had better confirm the fact...

688
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:42,266
年轻的弗朗肯斯丁恩. . 
that young Frankenstein is indeed...

689
00:50:42,338 --> 00:50:45,535
正在赴他祖父的后程
following in his grandfather's footsteps!

690
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:46,939
什么
CROWD: What?

赴他祖父的后程，后程
Following in his grandfather's footsteps, footsteps!

我认为. . 
I think...

694

我该做的事就是. . 
what is in order...

695

697
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:07,719
然后和他好好谈谈

698
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:15,598

医生，你不要这样折磨你自己了吧
INGA: Oh, Doctor, you mustn't do this to yourself.

701
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,214
不要多想
You've got to stop thinking about it.

702
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:29,650
你甚至都还没动过你的食物
You haven't even touched your food.

703

好的
FRANKENSTEIN: There!

704
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:36,452
你动过了，你高兴了吧
I've touched it. Happy?

705

我永远都不会忘记我的老父亲
I'll never forget my old dad.

706
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,131
每当有什么事情发生时. . 
When these things happened to him...

707
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,294
他总爱说
the things he'd say.

708
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:50,570
说什么？
What did he say?

709
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:54,237
你在浴室做什么？
"What the hell are you doing in the bathroom?

710

“给别人一点机会！”
"Give someone else a chance!"

711
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:07,523
也许这样更好
Maybe it's better this way.

712
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,422
那个可怜的，没生命力的大个子

这是什么？
IGOR: What is this?

716
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,045
斯瓦特
FRANKENSTEIN: Swartzwalter.

717
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:38,686
MONSTER: Mmmmm!

718
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:39,983
你喜欢吗？
FRANKENSTEIN: Oh, you like it?

719
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:42,718
我并不是想把它留给我一人 但它味道确实很好
I'm not partial to deserts myself, but this is excellent.

720
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:44,923
你在跟谁说话？
IGOR: Who are you talking to?

你刚才发出了愉快的声音
You just made a yummy sound.

我没有

不是我
INGA: It wasn't me.

727
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:02,276
如果不是你 不是你. .

INGA: No! No, you mustn't!

885
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:31,211
我就要这么干
BLUCHER: Yes!

886
01:02:32,118 --> 01:02:33,517
你有毛病吗？
FRANKENSTEIN: Are you insane?

887

他会杀了你的
He'll kill you!

888
01:02:35,855 --> 01:02:38,449
不，他不会的
BLUCHER: No, he won't.

889

他就跟一只羊羔一样温顺
He is as gentle as a lamb.

890
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:44,562
后退，看在上帝的份上
FRANKENSTEIN: Stand back, for the love of God!

891
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,461
他的脑有问题
He has a rotten brain!

892
01:02:46,532 --> 01:02:48,966
不，他的脑很好
BLUCHER: It's a good brain!

893
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:51,333
不，是坏的，是坏的
FRANKENSTEIN: It's rotten! Rotten!

894

是的，它在你的血液里

在所有人形怪物的血液里
It's in the blood of all Frankensteins.

901
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:27,362
当语言没用时 它就能进入它们的灵魂里
It reaches the soul when words are useless.

902
01:03:27,473 --> 01:03:31,239
你的祖父就经常对它们拉提琴
Your grandfather used to play it to his creature.

903
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:32,709
是你
FRANKENSTEIN: It was you!

904
01:03:32,778 --> 01:03:33,904

907
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,877
不错
Yes!

908

是你吸的雪茄
That was your smoldering cigar!

909
01:03:42,288 --> 01:03:43,653

916
01:04:00,273 --> 01:04:01,797

Agggh! Agggh!

919
01:04:11,117 --> 01:04:13,585
你永远都抓不到他了
BLUCHER: You'll never catch him now!

920
01:04:13,653 --> 01:04:15,120
他自由了
He's free!

921
01:04:15,187 --> 01:04:16,620
你听到了吗？
Do you hear?

Gone!

927

我们必须找到他

在他还没杀人之前找到他

937
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,767
MONSTER: Mmmmm.

938
01:05:13,646 --> 01:05:15,511
那个怪物跑了
That monster is loose.

939

940

谢天谢地你已经让海尔格睡了

我也没有办法 对付这种怪物只能如此
With all this monster business, I take no chances

943

但是爸爸，我并没让她去睡
MAMA: But, Papa, I told you I was turning the rostbraten.

944

我跟你说让你把海尔格--
I asked you to put Helga to...

945

现在给它一个吻说声再见

亲爱的，什么都没有了
Oh, dear. Nothing left.

948
01:05:59,025 --> 01:06:01,585
我们现在还可以丢什么呢？

也许她在浴室里

这是上帝给我的礼物和惊喜

只有一个答案

只要我能平衡. .

他的脑脊髓液. . 
in his cerebral spinal fluid...

1184
01:24:07,479 --> 01:24:09,811
他就会很正常了
he'd be as right as rain.

1185
01:24:09,881 --> 01:24:11,007
但要怎样做了？
But how?

1186
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,810
怎样做？在还来得及时
How? Before it's too late.

1187
01:24:14,886 --> 01:24:17,013
噢，弗勒迪. . 
INGA: Oh, Frederick...

1188
01:24:17,088 --> 01:24:19,215
如果有办法让我帮你. .

1189
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:20,382
FRANKENSTEIN: Mmm.

1194
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,331
. . .让你不要这么难受
INGA: Relieve the tension.

1195
01:24:30,401 --> 01:24:34,531
但愿我能让你安静下来
If I could give you a little peace.

1196
01:24:42,514 --> 01:24:44,482
医生，我有. . 
Doctor, I have...

1197

医生？
Doctor?

1198
01:24:47,552 --> 01:24:48,814
什么事？
FRANKENSTEIN: What is it?

1199
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:55,289
医生？你在哪？
Doctor? Where are you?

1200
01:25:09,741 --> 01:25:12,972
你走时，我收到了这份电报
BLUCHER: Doctor, this cable came while you were gone.

1201
01:25:13,044 --> 01:25:14,807
我想我告诉过你. . 
FRANKENSTEIN: I thought I told you...

1202
01:25:14,879 --> 01:25:19,179
在我工作时不要打扰我
never to interrupt me while I'm working!

1203
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,945
对不起，医生
BLUCHER: I'm sorry, Doctor.

1204
01:25:21,019 --> 01:25:23,112
我认为这很紧急
I thought this was an emergency.

1205
01:25:23,188 --> 01:25:27,488
你的未婚妻要来了
Your fiancee will be arriving any second.

1206
01:25:27,559 --> 01:25:30,255
什么？伊丽莎白？今晚要来？
FRANKENSTEIN: What? Elizabeth? Here tonight?

1207

BLUCHER: Yes. I will go prepare her room at once.

我建议你最好马上穿戴好
I suggest you put on a tie.

1209

亲爱的
FRANKENSTEIN: Darling!

1224
01:26:29,554 --> 01:26:31,112
什么都不要说 只是一段临时表演
IGOR: Say nothing. Act casual.

1225
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:32,417
准备好了吗？
FRANKENSTEIN: Ready?

1226
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:34,890
我想
ELIZABETH: I think.

1227
01:26:34,959 --> 01:26:36,449
是的
Yes.

1228
01:26:36,527 --> 01:26:38,825
我真的是有些累了
I am a bit tired after all.

1229

我的助手 英佳和艾哥尔

你好？

1235
01:26:54,045 --> 01:26:55,740
请问，亲爱的

1236
01:26:55,813 --> 01:26:59,408
你具体都做些什么呢？
What is it exactly that you do do?

1237
01:27:01,619 --> 01:27:02,711
INGA: Uh...

1238
01:27:02,787 --> 01:27:06,154
我是在实验室里帮他做些事

我们对一些事进行讨论
We have intellectual discussions.

1240
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:12,052
我们之前正在谈论一个问题
We were having one as you were driving up.

1241
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:13,188
FRANKENSTEIN: Nein!

1242
01:27:14,799 --> 01:27:17,165
艾哥尔，帮我们把行李提上来

1246
01:27:22,774 --> 01:27:23,900
Ggggrrrrr!

1247
01:27:26,744 --> 01:27:28,177
不要胡闹了

拿行李

1249
01:27:29,747 --> 01:27:31,715
是，先生

1250
01:27:31,816 --> 01:27:33,215
女士，请这边走
FRANKENSTEIN: Ladies, this way.

1251
01:27:35,486 --> 01:27:38,512
如果女人的事上你需要帮助的话--
IGOR: If you need help with the girls...

1252
01:27:43,361 --> 01:27:44,453
Agggh!

1253
01:27:44,529 --> 01:27:46,622
JAILOR: Ha ha ha!

1254
01:27:46,698 --> 01:27:49,030
你现在平静下来了
You settle down now.

1255
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,558
我们就会成为同伴的
'Cause we're gonna be pals.

1256
01:27:53,705 --> 01:27:54,797
对吧？
Right?

1257
01:27:54,872 --> 01:27:57,340
MONSTER: Agggh!

1258
01:27:57,442 --> 01:27:58,932
很好
JAILOR: Nice and cozy.

1259
01:27:59,844 --> 01:28:02,745
就错老朋友似的
Just like old friends.

1260
01:28:09,454 --> 01:28:10,682
MONSTER: Mmmmm.

1261
01:28:10,755 --> 01:28:11,847
Mmmmm.

1262
01:28:11,923 --> 01:28:13,686
怎么了？
JAILOR: What's the matter?

1263
01:28:13,758 --> 01:28:15,225
你怕火？
You're afraid of this fire?

1264
01:28:16,494 --> 01:28:17,859
这不会伤害你的
This can't hurt you.

1265
01:28:17,929 --> 01:28:19,260
明白吗
- See? - Mmmmm!

1266
01:28:20,698 --> 01:28:22,825
你这个怪物
Some monster you are.

1267
01:28:23,668 --> 01:28:25,693
妈妈说得对
Mama was right.

1268
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:28,933
小孩子是不许玩火的
Little boys ain't supposed to play with fire.

1269
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,166
MONSTER: Mmmmm!

1270
01:28:30,274 --> 01:28:33,004
是吗？ 因为他们也许会受到伤害
Is they? 'Cause they might get hurt!

1271
01:28:33,111 --> 01:28:34,578
MONSTER: Agggh!

1272
01:29:00,905 --> 01:29:02,497
安静
KEMP: Silence!

1273
01:29:02,607 --> 01:29:04,199
举起来
Up.

1274
01:29:04,308 --> 01:29:07,243
暴乱是件不光彩的事
A riot is an ugly thing.

1275
01:29:08,046 --> 01:29:12,380
但现在是我们该这样做的时候了
I think it is just about time we had one!

1276
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:14,748
是的
CROWD: Yeah!

杀了那个怪物
Kill the monster!

1278
01:29:16,421 --> 01:29:19,913
杀了那个怪物
Kill the monster!

1279
01:29:19,991 --> 01:29:23,552
他会因为制造出一个怪物. . 
He will curse the day...

1280
01:29:23,628 --> 01:29:27,564
而受到诅咒的
[Garbled] That he was born a Frankenstein!

1281
01:29:27,632 --> 01:29:29,566
什么？
CROWD: What?

1282
01:29:29,634 --> 01:29:34,571
他会因为制造出一个怪物 而受到诅咒的
KEMP: He will curse the day that he was born a Frankenstein.

1283
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:36,266
是的
CROWD: Yeah!

1284
01:29:51,489 --> 01:29:53,081
跑了
FRANKENSTEIN: Loose!

1285
01:29:53,157 --> 01:29:55,387
他跑了
He's broken loose!

1286
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,724
你知道这意味着什么吗？
Do you know what that means?

1287
01:29:57,795 --> 01:30:00,593
亲爱的，你不用担心
ELIZABETH: Darling, you mustn't worry so.

1288
01:30:03,201 --> 01:30:05,066
我想你是对的
FRANKENSTEIN: I suppose you're right.

1289
01:30:05,136 --> 01:30:06,967
我当然是对的
Of course I am.

1290
01:30:07,038 --> 01:30:09,165
好了，不要多想了
Now come along.

1291
01:30:09,273 --> 01:30:11,707
如果没有你我该怎么办？
What would I do without you?

1292
01:30:11,776 --> 01:30:15,906
如果我受到惊吓的话 就可以到你的房间去吧？
Is your room down the hall if I get the frights?

1293
01:30:16,981 --> 01:30:20,781
是的，但是今晚，在这种情况下. . 
Yes. But I thought tonight, under the circumstances...

1294
01:30:20,852 --> 01:30:23,878
我该在这儿陪着你
I might stay here with you.

1295
01:30:23,955 --> 01:30:28,824
你现在就想要我吗 就在我们快要结婚时. . 
Would you want me now, so soon before our wedding...

1296
01:30:28,893 --> 01:30:30,986
就在我们隔的如此近时？
so near we could almost touch it?

1297
01:30:33,698 --> 01:30:34,790
是的
FRANKENSTEIN: Yes!

1298
01:30:34,866 --> 01:30:37,027
好孩子
ELIZABETH: Whoa, boy!

1299
01:30:37,101 --> 01:30:39,365
或者. . 
Or...

1300
01:30:39,437 --> 01:30:41,905
你该再等等. . 
to wait just a little while longer...

1301
01:30:42,006 --> 01:30:45,567
等到当我能毫无疑虑把自己给你时. . 
when I can give myself without hesitation

1302
01:30:45,676 --> 01:30:47,439
当我完全地. . 
when I can be totally, unashamedly...

1303
01:30:47,512 --> 01:30:49,241
合法地是你的时，好吗？
and legally yours?

1304
01:30:53,184 --> 01:30:55,482
这是个很难的选择
That's a tough choice.

1305
01:30:55,553 --> 01:30:57,714
你是个很难缠的男人
You're a tough guy.

1306
01:30:57,788 --> 01:30:58,914
[Smack]

1307
01:31:01,058 --> 01:31:02,685
我想你是对的
I suppose you're right.

1308
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,421
当然了，我总是对的
Of course I am. I always am.

1309
01:31:05,997 --> 01:31:07,692
跟我吻别吧
Kiss me and say good night.

1310
01:31:11,836 --> 01:31:13,098
不要用舌头

1315

你爱我吗
- You love me? - Mm-hmm.

1317
01:31:30,221 --> 01:31:32,621
我爱你，宝贝

1318
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:34,749
做个好梦，亲爱的
Sweet dreams, darling.

1319
01:31:34,825 --> 01:31:36,190
再见，不要被臭虫咬了
Good night. Don't let the bedbugs bite.

1320
01:31:40,798 --> 01:31:43,028
MONSTER: Mmmmm...

1321
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,397
Agggh!

1322
01:31:44,468 --> 01:31:48,029
[Singing] He has loosed
the fateful lightning...

1323
01:31:48,105 --> 01:31:50,903
