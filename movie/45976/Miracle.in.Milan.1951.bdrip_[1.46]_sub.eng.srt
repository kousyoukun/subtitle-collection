1
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,749
Oh... Oh...

2
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,457
No, no, no!

3
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,082
Hello.

4
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,165
Hello.

5
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,874
What a great big place
the world is!

6
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,207
What's seven times seven?

7
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,499
Forty-nine.

8
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,124
And six times six?

9
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,665
Thirty-six.

10
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,082
Three times three?

11
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,290
Fifteen.

12
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,332
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10..

13
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,249
.. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,..

14
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,082
.. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,..

15
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,415
.. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,..

16
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,874
.. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,..

17
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,707
.. 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46,..

18
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,915
.. 47, 48, 49, 50,..

19
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,499
.. 51, 52, 53, 54,..

20
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,290
.. 55, 56, 57, 58, 59,..

21
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:06,040
.. 60, 61, 62, 63, 64.

22
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,665
Shall we go now, little boy?

23
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:41,874
Hello.

24
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,624
- Hello.
- Hello.

25
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:03,749
Hello.

26
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,665
Who are you saying hello to?

27
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,540
- To you.
- To me?

28
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,082
- Yes.
- Do you know me?

29
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,124
No.

30
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,957
So what do you mean
by saying "Hello"?

31
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,040
I really just wanted
to say "Hello".

32
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,207
Go and take a running jump!
That's all I need..

33
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,374
.. a retard first thing
in the morning...

34
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,540
Excuse me,
have you got a job for me?

35
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,207
No.

36
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,040
Excuse me, but that's mine.

37
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,707
- It's yours?
- Yes.

38
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,874
There's hardly anything in it.

39
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,207
But I rather liked the case.

40
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,165
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

41
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,665
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

42
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,040
Do you know where I could get
a bed for the night?

43
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,832
You'll have to go
to the town centre.

44
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,540
But the last tram's just left.

45
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,207
I could put you up at my house
if you want.

46
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,374
Thanks.

47
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,707
Okay, then. Let's go.

48
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,332
- Th-th-thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

49
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,332
You've b-b-been very kind.

50
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,374
I don't know
how to thank you enough.

51
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,290
There's really no need.

52
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,915
The sun! The sun!

53
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,624
Quick, come on!

54
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,957
Lovely, isn't it?

55
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,749
Kick him out!

56
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,415
Move!

57
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,832
Don't push!

58
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,457
Stamp your feet.

59
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,165
Clean your nose!

60
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,624
Come on in!

61
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,832
I'm not cold. I've got underwear.

62
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,707
Look! The sun!

63
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,874
How selfish can you get!
He wants it all for himself.

64
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,415
Jesus wept!

65
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,332
Come on, Angelina.

66
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,207
Come on! Up you get!

67
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,790
Jump up! Run!

68
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,249
Peek-a-boo! Stamp your feet.
Come on! Come over here!

69
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,040
Stamp your feet.

70
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,415
Boo! Boo!

71
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,790
Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!

72
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,374
Stamp your feet! Peek-a-boo!

73
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,082
My little angel,
what's five times five?

74
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,249
Angela, what have you done?
Eh...

75
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,957
And you. What's three times three?

76
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,082
- Hello!
- Hello!

77
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,665
Get the paint.
Look. It's over there.

78
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:22,874
What are you doing?

79
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,957
This way at least the children
will learn something.

80
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,999
Ah!

81
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,874
Can I help?

82
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,665
Yes, of course! Come over here!

83
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:43,207
Thanks.

84
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,499
One Times One Square...

85
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,749
This is a vacuum cleaner.

86
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,415
Come on, lads! To work!
Work ennobles man.

87
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,540
And makes men rich.

88
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,040
Look at that beautiful statue!

89
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,207
Really lovely!

90
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,749
She's mine! I saw her first!

91
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,415
No, you didn't.
She's mine. I saw her.

92
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,915
No, it isn't. I found it.
It's mine.

93
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,624
Where was I then?

94
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,040
Nowhere.
I saw it first, so it's mine.

95
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,290
Leave it out!
What do you mean you saw it first?

96
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,249
Get your hands off me.
I said it's mine!

97
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,790
What do you mean it's yours?

98
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,457
I said I saw it first.

99
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,207
You didn't see anything.

100
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,665
Excuse me. I saw it first.

101
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,832
Clear off, you!

102
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,749
The statue's mine!

103
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,040
I'll give you statue.

104
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,624
One second!

105
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,624
What is it?

106
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:08,832
Blow.

107
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:12,582
Eh?

108
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,665
Like this.

109
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,832
Oh, clear off home.

110
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:27,999
Oh, who cares. You keep the statues
and the rest of the rubbish, too.

111
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:32,790
Come on!

112
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,749
- Beautiful, eh?
- Lovely!

113
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,374
Marvellous!

114
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,832
Take it along to the square.

115
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,457
Could you please
hammer this in for me?

116
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,290
Okay. You fix this.

117
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,332
I'd give an arm and a leg
to be as tall as you.

118
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,124
I'm not that tall.
I just look it.

119
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,124
I'd give an arm and a leg.

120
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,665
Come on, I'm not that tall.

121
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,582
What's eight times eight?

122
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:10,999
Sixty-four.
See? I'm not that tall.

123
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:15,332
You only say that 'cos you don't
know what being four feet's like.

124
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,874
There's not a lot of difference
between you and me.

125
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,707
We're both small.

126
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:23,249
And life is beautiful for us, too.

127
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:25,707
- Hello.
- Hello.

128
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,499
Hello!

129
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:33,707
Ahhh! Blessed youth!

130
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,374
I can hardly move
with this rheumatism!

131
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,874
Me too. All it takes is
the slightest movement... oww, oww!

132
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,374
- Hello.
- Hello.

133
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

134
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,915
Mind your own business!

135
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:55,957
Poor creature.

136
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,374
Mind your own!
I'll mind mine!

137
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:00,957
Good Grief!

138
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,332
How beautiful!

139
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:06,624
Lovely! Gorgeous!
Really well-made!

140
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:13,374
Leave me alone!
I want nothing to do with anybody!

141
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,915
And no-one's to try
to be friendly with me!

142
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,457
Give it a rest!

143
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:20,749
Ugly tramps!
Mind your own business!

144
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:24,082
Especially you!
I'll kill any animal I want!

145
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,374
Do you want
to leave it out or what?

146
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:31,374
Go on! Clear off!

147
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,957
I don't like him much either.

148
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,832
Shall we move it?

149
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:44,290
Among the chickens again!

150
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:48,165
He needs a thrashing..

151
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:53,999
.. he'll remember
to the end of his days.

152
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,499
What did you move me for?
I was fine just where I was.

153
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:04,707
You're now facing the rising sun.
What more do you want?

154
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,874
Arturo!

155
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:12,749
Arturo! Get down!
Get down, Arturo, get down!

156
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:15,665
Arturo! Arturo!

157
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:21,207
- Come on down, Arturo!
- No, no, no!

158
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,124
Get down!

159
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,665
Why? What did you do that for?

160
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,249
I'm bored.

161
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:40,040
No. Come here. Life's beautiful.
#Lallalala!# Try it!

162
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,915
You try it!

163
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,374
#Lallalala. #

164
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:51,082
There you go. See?
Come on, get down!

165
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,124
- #Lallalala!#
- #Lallalala. #

166
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,624
- Hello.
- Hello.

167
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,082
- Husband and wife?
- Yes.

168
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,749
A shack for two
at the end on the right.

169
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,707
Are you on your own?

170
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:21,082
No. I have a husband,
a child and a maid.

171
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,249
Are you on your own?

172
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,165
No, I'm with him.

173
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,582
A shack for two,
down there at the end.

174
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,415
Excuse me, but I'd like
a shack facing the sun.

175
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,624
- Yes.
- The sun shines here.

176
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,707
What do you do?

177
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,999
Giuseppe. I'm Giuseppe.

178
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:45,874
Families down there
in One Times One Square.

179
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,707
Where that half-built shack is.

180
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:53,957
- I'm single.
- Single?

181
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:57,082
Yes, okay, down there
in that shack there...

182
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,665
- Are you on your own?
- Alone.

183
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:18,249
- Alone?
- Alone. Housewife.

184
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,374
Bachelors over here,
spinsters over there.

185
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,999
Edvige, move yourself.
What are you doing?

186
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,832
Where is this shack?

187
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,832
Right there, ma'am.

188
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,874
Giuseppe, stop.

189
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,332
Here it is.

190
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,624
This should do, shouldn't it?

191
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,707
Is it enough?

192
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:23,874
Edvige! Wicked girl!

193
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,957
She hasn't done anything wrong.
On the contrary.

194
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,040
She must be careful.

195
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,624
We can't go on like this.

196
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:36,707
She didn't do anything wrong.
I like it.

197
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,499
You're fired, and that's that!

198
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:41,165
I love water, believe me.

199
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,165
I love it. Look.

200
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,832
But what...?

201
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,874
It took an hour to fill it!
Now I've got to do it again!

202
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:55,832
If you need anything
from me, just call.

203
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,332
Thanks!

204
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,832
Here we are. This is the land.

205
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,874
I'll give you no more
than ten million for it.

206
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:05,665
My last offer:
thirty million and it's yours.

207
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,124
- Eleven.
- Twenty-nine.

208
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,999
- Twelve.
- Twenty-eight.

209
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,665
- Thirteen.
- Twenty-seven.

210
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,040
- Fourteen.
- Twenty-five. Twenty-six.

211
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,374
- Eleven.
- Twenty-nine.

212
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,540
- Twelve.
- Twenty-eight.

213
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,832
- Thirteen.
- Twenty-seven.

214
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,124
- Fourteen.
- Twenty-six.

215
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,415
- Thirteen.
- Twenty-seven.

216
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,582
- Fourteen.
- Twenty-six.

217
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,874
- Thirteen.
- Twenty-eight.

218
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,124
- Thirteen.
- Twenty-nine.

219
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,457
- Twelve.
- Twenty-eight.

220
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,749
- Nine.
- Twenty-seven.

221
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:37,457
- Ten.
- Twenty-eight.

222
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:38,540
Eleven.

223
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,499
Twenty-five. My last price.

224
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:48,124
Who are all these people?

225
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,207
The poor.

226
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:55,499
What are they doing here?

227
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,999
You can get rid of them
whenever you want to.

228
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,290
That's what you think.

229
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:02,957
Nothing easier. If I just stamp
my feet, they'll run off.

230
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,624
Doesn't look that easy
to get rid of them to me.

231
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:32,874
He says it's not easy
to get rid of them. Good Grief!

232
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:41,665
Excuse me, sirs, would you like
to warm your hands?

233
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,207
Come here!

234
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,624
Help yourself.

235
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:20,124
Here we all are together. As you
can see, I'm cold, just like you.

236
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,540
That's because we're all the same.

237
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,957
My nose might be a little smaller
or a little larger than yours,..

238
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,249
.. but it's still a nose.

239
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,374
That's the truth of it, my friends.
A nose is a nose.

240
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,165
What's that mean?

241
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,832
What have noses
got to deal with it?

242
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,082
Why should they leave their shacks?

243
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,540
You've got a house, haven't you?
Perhaps two.

244
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:51,332
Do we have to know one another
or each other's names..

245
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:54,290
.. to be brothers? No.
Do I know your name?

246
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:55,207
No.

247
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:57,790
- And yours?
- Rappi.

248
00:35:57,916 --> 00:36:01,332
I know now because you just told
me, but I didn't a minute ago.

249
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,249
Yet I like you just the same.

250
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:09,374
Because I've got five fingers
on my hand and so has he.

251
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:12,665
And him.

252
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:16,082
You're right! You're right.

253
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,832
Long live Mr Mobbi!

254
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:34,207
Long live Mr Mobbi!

255
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:44,082
#All we need's a shack
to live and sleep in. #

256
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:51,915
#All we need's a bit of ground,
to live and die on. #

257
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:59,624
#All we ask is a pair of shoes,
some socks and a bit of bread. #

258
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:07,499
#That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow. #

259
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:15,290
#That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow. #

260
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,874
#Trallalarala, trallalarala!#

261
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:31,040
#All we need's a shack
to live and sleep in. #

262
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:38,749
#All we need's a bit of ground,
to live and die on. #

263
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:46,457
#All we ask is a pair of shoes,
some socks and a bit of bread. #

264
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:54,249
#That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow. #

265
00:38:54,708 --> 00:39:02,374
#That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow. #

266
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:39,957
Your attention, please!
Time to award first prize.

267
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:49,082
Hooray! Hooray!

268
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:52,165
Bravo! Bravo!

269
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,999
Quiet, please.
Check your numbers.

270
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,749
May I, ma'am?

271
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:44,874
Attention, please. Time to select
the winning ticket in the lottery.

272
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:47,832
First prize: a real chicken!

273
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,290
Bravo!

274
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:09,874
Ninety.

275
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,540
Ninety!

276
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,582
Who's got ninety?

277
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:22,124
Ninety!

278
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:25,374
Anybody got ninety?

279
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,540
- Eighty-nine.
- I said ninety.

280
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,874
Missed it by one!

281
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,624
Idiot!
Eighty-nine isn't ninety.

282
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:33,915
I've got twelve.

283
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,582
This is ninety.

284
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:46,290
Get away! It can't be mine!
I should be so lucky!

285
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:49,540
Out with number ninety!

286
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,165
Ninety, ninety!

287
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,249
- Black...
- Mmm...

288
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,582
Ninety wins the chicken.

289
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:03,499
Another number!

290
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,624
Yeah! Yeah! Another number!

291
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:09,665
If no-one's got ninety,
we'll choose another number.

292
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:11,832
Right! That's the way!

293
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:13,957
That's ninety.

294
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,665
He's right. It is!

295
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:16,582
Is it?

296
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:18,540
Yes, it's ninety. Go on!

297
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:22,665
Ninety! Ninety!

298
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:28,832
Sit down here, you lucky man!

299
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,082
Eat up!

300
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,457
Give me a bit.

301
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,915
Give me a bit.

302
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:42,915
No!

303
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,832
He looks like he's enjoying that!

304
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:19,499
Bravo!

305
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:46,082
One lira for the sunset.
Sit down here, please.

306
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,749
One lira. Sit here, please.

307
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,082
One lira for the sunset, please.

308
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:54,665
Sunset one lira.
Please sit there.

309
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:58,457
Please sit here.

310
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,290
One lira for the sunset.

311
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:04,915
Edvige?

312
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:10,082
You've had enough fun. Afterwards
I want you back in service.

313
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,082
One lira.

314
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,540
What do you mean, no?

315
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,457
The seat's mine,
so I'm not paying.

316
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,540
And whose bit of ground is it?
All the others have paid..

317
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,582
.. so you can pay too.
He's even sat in the front row.

318
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,999
I'm not scared of you.

319
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:36,332
Silence!

320
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:40,082
Are you paying or not?
Either you pay or you get out.

321
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:10,249
What a profile,
what a gaze, what a forehead!

322
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:16,540
Who can tell what you will become
with that smile, that forehead!

323
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:23,457
You won't end your days here.
Who knows how far you'll go!

324
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:27,374
You'll become a real grandee.
You haven't finished yet.

325
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:30,624
Who knows who your father was!
A hundred lire.

326
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,290
A hundred lire?

327
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,540
Next, please.

328
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:59,749
What a forehead,
what a smile, what a gaze!

329
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,999
You have an interior light.

330
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:09,540
What a fine profile, what a
forehead, what a spiritual gaze!

331
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:14,665
You are someone special.
Who knows what you might become!

332
00:46:14,916 --> 00:46:19,332
You won't end your days here.
Who knows who your father was!

333
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,332
A hundred lire.

334
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:28,040
There it goes! There it goes!

335
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,874
It's going.

336
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,499
What a beautiful sunset!

337
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:40,165
It's going. It's going.

338
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:44,874
It's gone.

339
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:49,790
- Okay!
- The show's over. Let's go!

340
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:55,790
Push! Push!

341
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,207
Water! Water!

342
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,915
Hooray! Hooray!

343
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,040
- LONG LIVE WATER -

344
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,999
Long live water!

345
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,832
- LONG LIVE WATER -

346
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:05,040
- LONG LIVE WATER -

347
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:24,707
But this is oil.

348
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,415
Oh! Oh!

349
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:30,082
Get back! Get back!
It's oil!

350
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,957
No-one light up!

351
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:38,040
Long live oil!

352
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:33,957
- Hello.
- Hello.

353
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:36,582
Hello.

354
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:07,207
- Hello.
- Hello.

355
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:12,582
- Hello.
- Hello.

356
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,207
Hello.

357
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:39,832
Stop him. Stop him!

358
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:52,832
Eat up.

359
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:57,290
Come on! Eat up. Eat up!

360
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,582
Fano chocolate is the best.

361
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,165
Fano chocolate is the best.

362
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:22,207
No. What do you say
when you go begging?

363
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,332
God bless you.
Fano chocolate is the best.

364
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,290
That's the way!

365
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:28,874
Thank you.
Fano chocolate is the best.

366
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:29,832
That's the way!

367
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:32,624
God bless you.
Fano chocolate is the best.

368
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:38,749
God bless you. Fano chocolate...

369
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:41,582
Fano chocolate is the best.

370
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:48,249
Fano ch- ch -
God b- b-

371
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:56,207
Fa - Fa - Fano chocolate!

372
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:55,332
Tramps!

373
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:25,415
Do the other signs
as soon as you've finished here.

374
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,332
Ah!

375
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:10,790
You'll all have to leave! Now!

376
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,665
Clear everything out!

377
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,665
Before evening?

378
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,040
Why have we got to move?

379
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,082
There must be a mistake.

380
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,582
What mistake?

381
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:33,874
This is Mr Mobbi's property.
You have to get off it.

382
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:36,415
Get out! Get out! Get out!

383
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:46,040
Get out!

384
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,499
Stop. We can't just go
and leave our homes behind.

385
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:55,457
This is private property.

386
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,374
But is this what Mr Mobbi wants?

387
00:55:57,416 --> 00:55:59,082
Yes. This is private property.

388
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,040
Excuse me.
One, two, three, four, five.

389
00:56:03,416 --> 00:56:05,790
No, Mr Mobbi would never do
this to us.

390
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:08,124
Yes he would.
This is private property.

391
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:10,499
Clear off! Clear off!

392
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:12,707
That's enough! That's enough!

393
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:15,040
That's enough talk. Get out!

394
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:21,082
What's happening?

395
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:27,124
If one of you so much as
touches a hair on my head,..

396
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:30,957
.. Mr Mobbi will raze
this camp to the ground.

397
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,415
Let's go! Let's go!

398
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:57,082
Primo! They're joking.

399
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,499
Thank God for that!

400
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,374
You rotten crook!

401
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:05,457
Can I talk to Mr Mobbi?

402
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:11,082
No, no, no, no!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

403
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,082
Stop!

404
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:14,874
Let's go and see Mr Mobbi!

405
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:18,790
One, two, three, four, five.
Let's go.

406
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,999
Who is it? The commission.

407
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,665
The government commission?
I'll see them today.

408
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:47,415
Yes, I confirm that. Buy.

409
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:49,707
Come in!

410
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:05,499
Please. Take a seat.

411
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,207
Come in!

412
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,582
Giovanni?

413
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:54,790
No, no, stay as you are!

414
00:58:56,708 --> 00:58:57,582
Tea?

415
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:05,040
Platoon, fall in!

416
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,457
Giovanni, tea.

417
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:15,915
You are the most important
members of the camp?

418
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,082
Yes, yes...

419
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:22,707
I'm delighted to have you here.
Buy!

420
00:59:32,833 --> 00:59:34,249
Milk or lemon?

421
00:59:40,625 --> 00:59:43,415
Positions!

422
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,249
Now then...

423
00:59:57,416 --> 01:00:00,832
A nose is a nose, Mr Mobbi.

424
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:03,540
But of course.

425
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:08,457
We've also got a lovely song.

426
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,999
#All we need's a shack
to live and sleep in. #

427
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:20,915
#All we need's a bit of ground... #

428
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:24,415
- Ssh...
- No, please carry on. I like it.

429
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:32,332
#All we need's a shack
to live and sleep in. #

430
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:35,874
Giovanni.

431
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,332
- The damp.
- Right away.

432
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,999
- Northerly.
- Northerly.

433
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,249
You can go.

434
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:08,499
- Mr Mobbi?
- Yes?

435
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,165
- Good bye.
- Thank you.

436
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:16,665
Goodbye. Goodbye.

437
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,040
Mr Mobbi...

438
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,665
Five fingers!

439
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,790
Thank you.

440
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,832
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Goodbye.

441
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,540
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

442
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:40,957
Forward march!

443
01:01:58,083 --> 01:02:00,999
Retreat.
Forward march!

444
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:05,415
Where do you think
you're going?

445
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:08,207
They're kicking us out.

446
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:17,165
Come on.

447
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:22,790
No!

448
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:25,999
There must be some kind of mistake.

449
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:28,290
What kind of mistake?

450
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,582
Let's go!

451
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,124
Get out! Get out!

452
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:42,790
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing?

453
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,290
Get back!

454
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,749
Get back to your positions.

455
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:35,749
Here are the reinforcements!

456
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,040
Forward march.
Left, right, left, right...

457
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:56,999
Platoon, halt!

458
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:03,332
Go, go, go...

459
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:10,499
Retreat!

460
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:20,915
How embarrassing!

461
01:04:23,916 --> 01:04:26,124
- What's happening?
- They're rebelling.

462
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,332
Attention!

463
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:47,540
Run!

464
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,582
Gaetano! Giuseppe!

465
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:54,290
Alfredo!

466
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,457
Gaetano!

467
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,332
Testing. Testing. Testing.

468
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:12,874
Surrender!

469
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:15,957
Alfredo, Gaetano, Giuseppe!

470
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:19,374
Gaetano, Giuseppe, Alfredo!

471
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:22,374
- Surrender!
- It's just smoke.

472
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:27,832
Surrender!

473
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,124
Run!

474
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:35,582
Surrender!

475
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:43,915
- Surrender!
- Surrender!

476
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:47,957
Gaetano, Alfredo, Arturo!

477
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:57,999
Surrender! Surrender!

478
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:02,915
Surrender! Surrender!

479
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:17,165
Mr Mobbi, they're giving up.

480
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:22,290
Fall in!

481
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:24,082
Fall in!

482
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:35,624
Toto, Toto!
My darling Toto, it's me.

483
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:39,665
I couldn't get in touch earlier
because it's not an easy thing..

484
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:45,832
.. to get away. Here you are, dear.
This dove is yours.

485
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:50,749
You can do anything you want.
You can stay with your friends.

486
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:54,582
Do you want the Moon? Do you
remember when you wanted the Moon?

487
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,040
Mother!

488
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,540
Don't cry.

489
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:04,874
I have to go straight away.
Can you hear?

490
01:07:04,916 --> 01:07:06,165
They're coming. They're coming.

491
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:12,249
Goodbye, my dear. Hide it.

492
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:29,290
Two fried eggs.

493
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:34,082
Three fried eggs.

494
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,832
Arturo, Alfredo, Gaetano!

495
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:50,665
Arturo, Gaetano!
Giovanni, Gaetano, Alfredo!

496
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,374
Come here! Come here!

497
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:18,915
Blow! Blow!

498
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:30,249
Blow! Blow!

499
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,832
Damn this wind.
The pumps! The pumps!

500
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:27,999
The pumps!

501
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,665
The pumps!

502
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,832
And you, don't cry.
These people deserve no mercy.

503
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,374
The pumps, the pumps!

504
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:00,874
Oooh! Oooh!

505
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:39,832
Get rid of those people
or I'll fire you. Move!

506
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:40,915
Fall in!

507
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:43,374
Quick, quick.

508
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:49,707
I've repaired lots of these, but
I've never seen this make before.

509
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:53,749
- And I've repaired lots.
And yours? - The same.

510
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,207
My God. He is an angel.

511
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,290
Something more, something more.

512
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:01,915
I've always said
he was a great saint.

513
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:04,207
Something more, something more.

514
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,165
Fire!

515
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:07,707
They're shooting!

516
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:14,874
You have ten seconds to surrender!

517
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:19,790
One, two, three,..

518
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:23,165
.. four, five, six,..

519
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:26,457
.. seven, eight,...
- Ssh...

520
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,582
...nine, ten.

521
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:34,624
Of course. Forward. Imbeciles.

522
01:11:34,666 --> 01:11:36,457
Imbeciles.

523
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:45,540
#Forward!#

524
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:54,165
#Forward!#

525
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:55,790
Bravo!

526
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:57,290
Bravo!

527
01:11:58,166 --> 01:11:59,957
You've been demoted!

528
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:04,082
Forward the second-in-command.

529
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:34,624
#Forward!#

530
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,165
Bravo!

531
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:44,207
#Let's march, let's march, let's
march, let's march, let's march!#

532
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:47,790
Let's march, let's march!

533
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,624
Drunkards! Rabble!
Forward the second platoon.

534
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:06,457
The road's iced over!
What's happening?

535
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,790
Well done! Well done!

536
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:48,124
- Sneak.
- Sneak.

537
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,207
Sneak! Oi!

538
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,499
We've got one too!

539
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:35,790
Toto! Toto!

540
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:46,999
Toto, I want a fur coat!

541
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:50,707
Toto, give me a fur coat.

542
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:55,374
Toto, give me a fur coat.
A fur coat!

543
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,415
Toto!

544
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,915
A sewing machine!

545
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:10,540
Thanks, Toto.

546
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,707
Me, too! Me, too!

547
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:19,457
One at a time!

548
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,707
A nice radio, Toto.

549
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:24,207
Oh! Oh!

550
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,874
Thanks, Toto!

551
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,832
Toto, I'd like...

552
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:46,665
Clothes, Toto. A whole outfit.

553
01:15:47,666 --> 01:15:49,082
Tails!

554
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,624
I asked you for a suit!

555
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:53,790
Toto, Toto!

556
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,040
A pair of nice trousers.

557
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:58,374
Toto, a case.

558
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,332
Toto, a house.

559
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:01,832
I would like...

560
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,582
Could you say that again, please?

561
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,749
Toto, Toto!

562
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:08,124
Quiet!

563
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:11,582
Queue up and keep calm.
I'll make you all happy, I swear.

564
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,415
Queue up.

565
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:16,832
What would you like?

566
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:17,582
To be taller.

567
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:18,290
And you?

568
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,207
An accordion.

569
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:19,999
To be taller.

570
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:20,915
A wardrobe.

571
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,124
A wardrobe.

572
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,249
A blanket.

573
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,749
A fur coat, Toto.

574
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,999
A pair of shoes, Toto.

575
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,707
I asked for a wardrobe, Toto.

576
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:34,040
Before you give it all away,
give me a fur coat.

577
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,249
A fur coat.

578
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,582
A suit.

579
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:39,290
- A wardrobe.
- A blouse.

580
01:16:39,916 --> 01:16:40,874
And you?

581
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:16,957
Can't you see it won't go through?
We need to chop the door down.

582
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,790
If we're not quick,
he'll fly away back to Heaven.

583
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:25,582
Quiet! What would you like?

584
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:27,249
To be a bit taller.

585
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:31,665
A bit shorter.

586
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:32,999
Oh!

587
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:35,249
A bit taller.

588
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:36,457
Oh!

589
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:41,832
Incredible!

590
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:48,040
I want a million, Toto!

591
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:49,499
Two million!

592
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:50,999
Yes. Write it down.

593
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:52,457
You?

594
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:53,874
A million.

595
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:55,374
Two million.

596
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:56,749
Three million.

597
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:57,957
Four million.

598
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,290
Five million.

599
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,957
A million million.

600
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:07,040
A million million million
million million million.

601
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:12,457
A million million million
million million..

602
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:16,707
.. million million million
million million. Take that!

603
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:19,874
Plus one. Take that!

604
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:21,874
Bravo! Bravo!

605
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:23,665
Edvige!

606
01:18:23,708 --> 01:18:24,999
Toto!

607
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,040
Edvige! Edvige!

608
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:05,249
Toto, please.

609
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:11,915
I want to become white.

610
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:17,040
I want to become white.

611
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:19,582
Yes.

612
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:01,582
Excuse me, sir.

613
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:06,165
Okay.

614
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:10,082
Toto! Toto!

615
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,957
- Go and see what's happening.
- Okay.

616
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:16,582
Go and see what's happening.

617
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,540
- Me?
- Yes.

618
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,707
There's someone at the door.

619
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,457
Edvige, there's someone
at the door. Open the door!

620
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:44,999
And you be careful,
don't dirty your shirt.

621
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:46,332
There's someone there!

622
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:49,082
Edvige,
the baby's crying. Open the door!

623
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,707
Millions! Millions!

624
01:20:56,083 --> 01:21:02,665
Toto, open up.
Do me a favour.

625
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:06,540
I'm no-one, I'm just Toto.

626
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:11,207
It's my mother doing all this.

627
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:15,374
Here you are.

628
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:19,249
What's this thing?

629
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:20,790
Oh, the baby!

630
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:22,124
Goodness me!

631
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:35,040
Good evening.

632
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:38,499
Mink is the loveliest fur there is.

633
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:41,290
Mink!
Ocelot is more elegant,..

634
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:42,874
.. you wear it in the evening.

635
01:21:42,916 --> 01:21:45,082
Open up, open up!

636
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:56,207
Excuse me.

637
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:05,082
Oh! God bless you.

638
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,790
God bless you!

639
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:11,999
Fano chocolate is the best.
God bless you!

640
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:16,832
Fano chocolate is the best.
God bless you!

641
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,124
Giuseppe, hold the baby.

642
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:25,082
- Beautiful!
- Lovely.

643
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:39,082
Oh! What a handsome lady! What
a gorgeous dress! Really elegant!

644
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:42,874
Beautiful!

645
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:58,415
What a beautiful dress, milady!

646
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:04,290
Open up! Toto! Toto!

647
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,082
What would you like?

648
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:28,665
Make me into a general.

649
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:55,540
Oh! Oh!

650
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:07,915
I want to go to town.

651
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:00,707
Imbecile! Cretin!
What on earth are you doing?

652
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:05,915
Down! Get down.

653
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:09,790
You too, you idiot!
Get down, you fool!

654
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,999
Down! Down!

655
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,082
Up!

656
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,374
Clap him in irons.

657
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:19,790
To prison with him!

658
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:24,457
Shall we attack, Mr Mobbi?

659
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,957
No. Let's wait until dawn.
Let's wait for the light.

660
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:37,457
Would you like the moon?
Even the moon.

661
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:46,415
Come on...

662
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:52,707
I don't know.

663
01:25:54,541 --> 01:25:55,249
Come on...

664
01:26:06,791 --> 01:26:07,707
Shoes.

665
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,707
- Toto, do me a favour.
- I can't.

666
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:01,915
- I'm full of rheumatism.
- I can't.

667
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,332
Do me a favour.

668
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:25,915
I want to go to town.

669
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:28,165
We'll take her!

670
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:35,749
Good night.

671
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:38,165
- Good night, Toto.
- Good night.

672
01:27:38,208 --> 01:27:41,332
Edvige, the dove.
My mother brought it back to me.

673
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:43,499
Edvige!

674
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,832
Edvige!

675
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:11,457
Would you like the sun?

676
01:29:16,708 --> 01:29:17,457
Yes.

677
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,040
The dove!

678
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:07,290
Toto, where are you?

679
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,707
Toto, Toto!

680
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:19,124
Toto!

681
01:30:19,416 --> 01:30:21,790
Let's go. Forward. Move along!

682
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:35,207
Toto!

683
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:46,832
Forward. Move yourselves!

684
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:02,915
Forward! Come on! Come on!

685
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:36,207
Move! Move!

686
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:20,124
Left, right, left, right...

687
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:07,124
- Goodbye, Toto.
- Goodbye. The dove!

688
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:11,415
Toto, Toto!

689
01:33:33,416 --> 01:33:35,124
Everyone grab a broom!

690
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:47,415
Everyone grab a broom!

691
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:50,165
Giuseppe, the baby!

692
01:34:26,583 --> 01:34:28,040
Upsy-daisy!

693
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:54,499
#All we need's a shack
to live and sleep in. #

694
01:34:54,791 --> 01:35:01,124
#All we need's a bit of ground
to live and die on. #

695
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:07,999
#All we want's a pair of shoes,
some socks and a little bread. #

696
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:14,582
#That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow. #

697
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:20,999
#That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow. #

698
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:27,790
#All we need's a shack
to live and sleep in. #

699
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,249
#All we need's a bit of ground
to live and die on. #

700
01:35:34,666 --> 01:35:40,874
#All we want's a pair of shoes,
some socks and a little bread. #

701
01:35:41,291 --> 01:35:47,374
#That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow. #

702
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:54,332
#That's all we need
to believe in tomorrow. #
