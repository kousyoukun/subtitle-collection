CHIEF JUDGE: Cassandra Anderson.
Twenty-one.

102
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,761
Born in a block 100 metres
from the radiation boundary wall.

103
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,680
At age seven, she lost both parents

104
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,974
to residual-fallout cancer.

105
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,517
As is usual with orphans,

106
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,854
she was given a Judge aptitude test
at age nine.

107
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,856
It classified her as unsuitable,

108
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,524
but she was entered into the Academy

109
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,276
on special instruction.

110
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,238
In the Academy, her record was never
better than borderline.

111
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,823
Her final Academy score

112

119
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:26,023
I can feel anger. And control. But

120
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,318
there's something else.

121
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,155

-Okay, Anderson.

to overlook her status.

We believe she could be a major asset.

131
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,974
As I said, her final score
was only three points below a pass.

132
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,267
It's marginal.

133
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,394
It's not marginal. She failed.

want to make an example of them.

165

No. Can you seal them in there?

Your assessment's now over.

988
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:56,354
ANDERSON: Sir.

989
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,945
When I heard you'd called in a 10-24,

990
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:06,614
I thought I'd better check it out.

991
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,616
Seeing as I forced the rookie on you.

992
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,202
So, what happened in there?

993
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,620
Drug bust.

994
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,622
Look like you been through it.

995
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:16,332
Perps were uncooperative.

996
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:18,793
So how did she do?

997
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:22,213
She a pass or a fail?

998
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,176
PARAMEDIC: Let's take a look, huh?

999
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,679
She's a pass.

1000
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,431
I knew she would be.

1001
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:39,230
WOMAN: No time to waste. Let's move.

1002
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,481
Tell them to go to the back

1003
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,441
and we will take the front entrance.

1004
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:53,035
DREDD: Mega City One.

1005
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:55,746
800 million people

1006
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:58,624
living in the ruin of the old world

1007
01:28:58,709 --> 01:29:01,168
and the mega structures of the new one.

1008
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:06,882
Only one thing
fighting for order in the chaos,

1009
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:09,760
Judges.
