The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid.

927
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:23,160

You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.

931
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:34,160
{\fs22\fn宋體}這並非計畫中的一部份 是你自己要去瑞可而壞了事{\r}
He wasn't in on it. You set him off by going to Recall.

the message from Hauser, all of that was set up by us.

{\fs22\fn宋體}你在我們還沒來得及派你上場前 就開啟了你的記憶{\r}
You pop your memory cap before we can activate you.

939
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:58,580
{\fs22\fn宋體}讓瑞克特到處追殺你 破壞了我花了一年準備的計畫{\r}
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up everything I spent a year planning.

940
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:02,500

If you're listening to this, it means that Kuato is dead

- Turn it on.  - Impossible!

1042
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:35,250
{\fs22\fn宋體}一旦連鎖反應產生 這星球上的T礦全將被毀{\r}
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the terbinium in the planet.

01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:37,660
{\fs22\fn宋體}整個火星也將熔毀{\r}
Mars will go into global meltdown.

1044
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:40,330
{\fs22\fn宋體}所以外星人才從未使用過它{\r}
That's why the aliens never turned it on.

Who gives a shit what you believe? In 30 seconds you'll be dead.

I didn't want it to end this way. I wanted Hauser back. But no.

1049
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,620
{\fs22\fn宋體}你偏要當奎德{\r}
You had to be Quaid!

1050
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:04,120
{\fs22\fn宋體}- 我本來就是奎德  - 你什麼也不是{\r}
- I am Quaid.  - You're nothing!

1051
01:41:04,290 --> 01:41:07,370
{\fs22\fn宋體}你什麼人也不是 只是一場愚笨的夢{\r}
You're nobody! You're a stupid dream.

{\fs22\fn宋體}我真不敢相信 這就像一場夢{\r}
I can't believe it. It's like a dream.
