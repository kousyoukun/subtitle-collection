1
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:16,136
Doug?

2
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,774
Honey, are you all right?

3
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:24,275
You're dreaming.

4
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:28,512
Doug, was it about Mars?

5
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:36,149
Is that better?

6
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,495
My poor baby.

7
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:43,864
This is getting to be
an obsession.

8
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:53,500
Was she there?

9
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:57,043
Who?

10
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,911
The one you told me about.
the brunette.

11
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:04,378
Lori.

12
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,256
I can't believe
you're jealous of a dream.

13
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:13,890
- Who is she?
- Nobody.

14
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,189
'Nobody'? What's her name?

15
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:17,560
I don't know.

16
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,591
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

17
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,131
You better tell me!

18
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:26,969
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.

19
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:29,510
And I'm always back
in the morning.

20
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,241
Let me go!

21
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,977
Come on, baby.

22
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:39,019
You know you're the girl
of my dreams.

23
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,688
You mean it?

24
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:43,854
You know I do.

25
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:56,133
I'll give you
something to dream about.

26
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:10,009
The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons...

27
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:14,089
are our only effective defense against the
southern block's numerical superiority.

28
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,353
And more violence
last night on Mars...

29
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,057
where terrorists
demanding independence...

30
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:22,493
once again halted the extraction
of terbinium ore.

31
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,462
Kuato and his so-called
freedom brigade...

32
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:31,703
claimed credit
for this latest bombing,

33
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:35,237
which attempted to reopen
the sealed-off Pyramid Mines.

34
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:42,151
Mars military restored order
with minimal use of force...

35
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,814
and all damage to the strategic facility
was repaired within hours.

36
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:47,552
No cameras!

37
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:51,716
With one mine already closed,
mars administrator Vilos Cohaagen...

38
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,055
vowed that troops
would be used if necessary...

39
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,758
to keep production at full capacity.
At the press conference today

40
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:01,131
No wonder you're having nightmares.
you're always watching the news.

41
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:08,072
- Lori.
- Doug?

42
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,441
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

43
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:13,013
Move to Mars.

44
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,380
Honey, why do you have to spoil
a perfectly wonderful morning?

45
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,485
Just think about it.

46
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:26,226
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.
You'd hate it on Mars.

47
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,125
lt's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.

48
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:34,359
I mean, really, a revolution
could break out there any second.

49
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:36,333
Cohaagen says
it's just a few extremists.

50
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:39,072
You believe him?

51
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,375
Okay. Forget about it.

52
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:54,586
Absolutely not. Mars was colonized by
the northern block at enormous expense.

53
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:58,318
Our entire war effort
depends on their terbinium.

54
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00,190
And it's ridiculous to think
we're going to give it away...

55
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:03,223
just because a bunch of lazy mutants
think they own the planet.

56
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,633
- Doug, Maybe we should take a trip, hum?
- Any comments, sir, on the rumor

57
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,768
- Lori, move.
- that you've blown the Pyramid Mine...

58
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,770
because you found
alien artifacts inside?

59
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:15,842
There's a lot better places here
than Mars.

60
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:18,772
What about Saturn?
don't you wanna see Saturn?

61
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:22,714
I wish we could find some alien artifacts.
our tourist industry could use a boost.

62
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,551
Everybody says that its gorgeous.

63
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:29,350
But the fact is, it's Mr. Kuato and his
terrorists who spread these rumors...

64
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,583
to undermine my trust
in the government.

65
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:35,288
We could take a long space cruise,
the kind with nothing to do.

66
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:39,059
- Have you found Kuato yet?
- We don't even know what he looks like.

67
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,292
- What do you say?
- That's all for the news.

68
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,267
- Stay tuned for Christina in the weather.
- I'm late.

69
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:44,837
But first, this.

70
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:49,071
- Tonight on ESPN, the fifth game of World Series...
- Sweetheart.

71
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:50,775
live from Tokyo.

72
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:57,614
Doug? I know it's hard being in a new town,
but let's give it a chance, okay?

73
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:04,324
Lori, don't you understand? I feel like
I was made for something more than this.

74
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:09,327
I want to do something with my life,
I want to be somebody.

75
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:11,396
You are somebody.

76
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,625
You're the man I love.

77
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,637
Bye.

78
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,141
Have a nice day.

79
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:45,631
You are now entering
a safety zone.

80
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:50,433
No unauthorized weapons allowed
beyond this point.

81
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,749
Would you like to ski...

82
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:06,386
but you're snowed under
with work?

83
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,424
Do you dream of a vacation
at the bottom of the ocean...

84
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:12,423
but you can't float the bill?

85
00:10:13,462 --> 00:10:16,761
Have you always wanted
to climb the mountains of Mars...

86
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,458
but now you're over the hill?

87
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,633
Then come to Rekall Incorporated...

88
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,740
where you can buy the memory
of your ideal vacation...

89
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:29,569
cheaper, safer and better
than the real thing.

90
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,407
So don't let life pass you by.

91
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:36,015
Call Rekall
for the memory of a lifetime.

92
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:39,946
For the memory of a lifetime

93
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:43,587
Rekall, Rekall, Rekall

94
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:03,568
Harry.

95
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:09,348
- You ever heard of Rekall?
- Rekall?

96
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,315
Where they sell
those fake memories.

97
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,817
Oh, Rekall.

98
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:17,557
- You're thinking of going there?
- I don't know, maybe.

99
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:19,456
- Well, don't.
- Why not?

100
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:24,289
A friend of mine tried one of these in a special office,
nearly got himself lobotomized.

101
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,264
No shit?

102
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,926
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.
It ain't worth it.

103
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,737
I guess not.

104
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:19,551
Good afternoon.
welcome to Rekall.

105
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,712
Douglas Quaid.
I have an appointment.

106
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,627
- Bob?
- Yeah?

107
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,562
- Doug Quaid is here to see you.
- Yeah, I'll be right out.
- Okay.

108
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,594
That'll be just one minute, Mr. Quaid.

109
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:35,301
Thank you.

110
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,937
- Doug! Paul McClane. It's good to see ya.
- Nice to meet you.

111
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:47,547
Come on in, through here.

112
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,478
- Please have a seat, make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

113
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:54,222
Now, help me out here, Doug.

114
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:56,850
- You were interested in a memory of a--
- Mars.

115
00:12:58,293 --> 00:12:59,885
Yeah. Mars.

116
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:01,359
Is that a problem?

117
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,024
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug...

118
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,564
if outer spaces is your thing...

119
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:11,262
I think you would be much happier with
one of our Saturn cruises. Everybody raves about them.

120
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:14,169
No, I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.

121
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,643
Okay. You're the boss.

122
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,971
Mars it is.

123
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:22,207
Now, let me see.

124
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,284
The basic Mars package...

125
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:27,686
will run you 899 credits.

126
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,289
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.

127
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,918
If you want a longer trip that'll cost a little more
because it's a deeper implant.

128
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,366
What's in the two-week package?

129
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,858
First of all, Doug. Let me tell you, when you go Rekall,
you get nothing but first-class memories.

130
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:46,138
Private cabin in a shuttle, deluxe suite
at the Hilton Plaza, all the major sights:

131
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,570
Mount Pyramid,
the Grand Canals...

132
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,078
and, of course, Venusville.

133
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:52,840
But how real does it seem?

134
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:57,411
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Come on, don't bullshit me.

135
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,352
No, I'm telling you, Doug. Your brain
will not know the difference.

136
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:02,455
That's guaranteed
or your money back.

137
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:05,990
What about the guy you lobotomized?
did he get a refund?

138
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:11,455
You're talking ancient history.

139
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,635
Nowadays traveling with Rekall
is safer than getting on a rocket.

140
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:17,600
Check out those statistics.

141
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,402
Besides, a real holiday
is a pain in the butt.

142
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,204
You got lost luggage,
lousy weather...

143
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:26,244
crooked taxi drivers.

144
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,541
When you travel with Rekall...

145
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:31,550
everything is perfect.

146
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:32,913
So, what do you say?

147
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:37,853
- All right.
- Smart move.

148
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,257
All right, while you fill out
this questionnaire,

149
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:43,887
I'll gonna familiarize you
with some of our options.

150
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:45,363
No options.

151
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:49,902
Whatever you say.
Can I ask you just one question, though?

152
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,704
What is it? Is it exactly the same...

153
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:56,135
about every single vacation
you have ever taken?

154
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,403
I give up.

155
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:01,209
You. You're the same.

156
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,941
No matter where you go, There you are.
It's always the same old you.

157
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:07,277
Let me suggest
that you take a vacation...

158
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:08,718
from yourself.

159
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:10,392
I know, it sounds wild.

160
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:13,156
It is the latest thing in travel.
we call it the Ego Trip.

161
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,626
No, I'm not interested in that.

162
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,332
You're gonna love this, Doug.

163
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:20,961
We offer you a choice of
alternate identities during your trip.

164
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,962
I mean, face it. Why go to Mars as a tourist
when you can go as a playboy...

165
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:26,902
or a famous jock or--

166
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:28,098
''Secret agent.''

167
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,937
How much is that?

168
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:40,378
Let me tantalize you. You're a top operative,
back under deep cover on your most important mission.

169
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:42,780
People are trying to kill you, left and right.

170
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,288
You meet this beautiful,
exotic woman.

171
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:47,417
Go on.

172
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:50,156
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug...

173
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,425
but you wrest the shore, by the time
the trip is over...

174
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:56,435
you get the girl, kill the bad guys
and save the entire planet.

175
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,104
Now, you tell me.

176
00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:01,139
Isn't that worth
a measly 300 credits?

177
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:16,750
- It this your first trip?
- Um-Huh

178
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,993
- Well, don't worry. Things hardly ever fuck up around here.

179
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:24,162
Good evening... Doug.

180
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,596
- I'm Dr. Lull.
- Nice to meet you.

181
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:30,465
Ernie, patch in matrix 62-B-37.

182
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:33,470
And, would you like us to integrate
some alien stuff?

183
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:35,472
Sure. Why not?

184
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,576
Two-headed monsters?

185
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:40,510
Don't you keep up with the news?

186
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:44,242
- We're doing alien artifacts now.
- It's wild.

187
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:47,217
Yeah, they date back
a million years.

188
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,225
- Ernie?
- That's a new one.

189
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,886
- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

190
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,626
- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

191
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,255
Slipping away for
a little hanky-panky.

192
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:01,095
- Not really. I've always been fascinated with Mars.
- All systems go.

193
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,133
Number seven.

194
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,602
Ready for dreamland?

195
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:11,403
I'll be asking you some questions, Doug,
so we can fine-tune the Ego program.

196
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:14,346
You answer honestly,
you'll enjoy yourself whole a lot more.

197
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:17,211
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

198
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,489
How do you like your women?

199
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,657
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

200
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:29,823
Brunette.

201
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:35,967
Slim. Athletic. Voluptuous.

202
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:41,073
Athletic.

203
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:49,247
Demure. Aggressive. Sleazy.

204
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,748
Be honest.

205
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,352
Sleazy.

206
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:57,918
Demure.

207
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:02,162
41A, Ernie.

208
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,927
Oh, boy, is he gonna have
a wild time?

209
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:10,435
- Is he not gonna want to come back?
- Oh, that's for sure.

210
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,849
So...

211
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:34,791
what do you say?

212
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:37,796
I'm not so sure,
and I don't get a souvenir.

213
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:43,404
Not true. For just a few more credits, we supply T-shirts,
snapshots of you at the site...

214
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:45,402
and even letters from the...

215
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,903
- What is it?
- You'd better get down here.

216
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,378
Look, I am with
a very important client.

217
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,846
It looks like we got
another schizoid embolism.

218
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:59,244
I'll be right back.

219
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:00,410
Uh, Mr. McClane?

220
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:03,814
Bob! What's wrong?

221
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,789
Don't let her leave!

222
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:12,394
Get off!

223
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:15,926
You blew my cover!

224
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:19,330
You can't do a simple
goddamn double implant?

225
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:20,907
Not my fault. We hit a memory cap.

226
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:23,345
They'll be here at any minute!
They'll kill you all!

227
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:26,007
- What is he talking about?
- Let me go!

228
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:28,211
Mr. Quaid, try to calm down!

229
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:32,582
My name is not Quaid.

230
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:36,518
- Let me go! Untie me now!
- Ernie, grab his leg!

231
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,193
- Hold him down!
- Let me go!

232
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,515
Are you all right?

233
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:07,678
Listen to me.
he's been going on and on about Mars.

234
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:10,655
- He has really been there.
- Use your head, you dumb bitch.

235
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:14,022
He's just acting out the 'secret agent'
portion of his ego trip.

236
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,926
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Why not?

237
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,859
Because we haven't implanted it yet.

238
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:23,499
Oh, shit.

239
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:28,667
I've been trying to tell you,
someone has erased his memory.

240
00:20:28,843 --> 00:20:30,003
Excuse me.

241
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:31,780
'Someone'?

242
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,577
We're talking about the fucking Agency.

243
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:36,410
- Shut up!
- Bob, the client's gone.

244
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,715
Ok, all right. Look, here's what we're gonna do.
Renata, cover up any memory he's got of us or Rekall.

245
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:44,984
l'll do what I can.
lt's pretty messy in there.

246
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:48,254
Ernie, dump him in a cab, around the corner.
Tiffany, you help him.

247
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,228
I'm gonna destroy his file
and refund his money.

248
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:54,834
And if anybody comes asking,
we never even heard of Douglas Quaid. 

249
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:10,717
Where am l?

250
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,923
You're in a Johnnycab.

251
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:16,447
I mean what am I doing here?

252
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,823
I'm sorry. Would you please
rephrase the question?

253
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:22,096
How did I get in this taxi?

254
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,587
The door opened, you got in.

255
00:21:27,802 --> 00:21:29,633
Hell of a day, isn't it?

256
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:45,182
- This okay?
- Right here.

257
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:47,880
- Thank you for taking Johnnycab.
- Thank you.

258
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:50,657
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

259
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:52,122
Hey, Quaid.

260
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:55,657
- Harry.
- How was your trip to Mars?

261
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,856
- What trip?
- You went to Rekall. Remember?

262
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,060
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

263
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,695
- I told you not to, but you went in anyway.
- What are you, my father?

264
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,405
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Listen. l'm already late, thank you very much. But...

265
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,978
Okay, bring him--
come on, move it!

266
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,445
Let's go get that drink.
move it!

267
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:20,950
What is going on?
what the fuck did I do wrong?

268
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,248
- Tell me!
- You blabbed, Quaid, you blabbed about Mars!

269
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:27,595
Are you crazy? I don't even know
anything about Mars!

270
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:30,894
You should've listened to me, Quaid.
I was there to keep you out of trouble.

271
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:38,032
Hey, you're making a big mistake.
you got me mixed up with somebody else.

272
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,540
Uh-uh, pal. You got yourself mixed up with somebody--

273
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,753
And pivot... and serve...

274
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,260
and shift... and stroke...

275
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:43,768
Very good.
perfect form.

276
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:48,807
Hi, honey.

277
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:54,076
- What are you doing?
- Some men just tried to kill me.

278
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,773
Muggers? Are you all right?

279
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,850
No, they were spies or something.

280
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,681
And Harry, from work, he was the--
get down!

281
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:04,722
- Harry was the boss.
- Take it easy, Doug, okay?

282
00:24:04,892 --> 00:24:08,726
- Tell me exactly what happened. Why would spies wanna kill you?
- I don't know.

283
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,195
- But it had something to do with Mars.
- Mars? You haven't even been to Mars.

284
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,564
I know, it sounds crazy, but I went to
this Rekall place after work--

285
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:17,832
- You went to those brain butchers?
- Let me finish.

286
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:22,335
- What did they do to you, tell me?
- I got a trip to Mars. And.. so what happened was

287
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:25,913
Forget about Rekall, will you?
These guys were going to kill me.

288
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,914
- Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
- They did.

289
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:31,017
But I killed them.

290
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:37,491
Listen to me, sweetheart. Those assholes
at Rekall have fucked up your mind.

291
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:39,986
You're having paranoid delusions.

292
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:42,426
You call this a delusion?

293
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:55,174
- Doug, l'm gonna call a doctor.
- Don't. Don't call anybody.

294
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:25,971
Lori, go! Get out!

295
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:18,824
Why are you doing this, Lori?

296
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:36,940
Talk!

297
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:39,102
- I'm not your wife.
- The hell you're not.

298
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:41,112
I swear to God I never saw you
before six weeks ago.

299
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:43,640
Our marriage
is just a memory implant.

300
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:46,612
You think I'm stupid?
I remember our wedding.

301
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:48,122
It was an implant by the Agency.

302
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:49,646
- Falling in love.
- Implanted.

303
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:53,655
Our friends, my job, 8 years together.
Suppose all of these was implanted, too?

304
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:56,859
The job's real.
The Agency set it up.

305
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:58,326
Bullshit.

306
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:03,568
They erased your identity
and implanted a new one.

307
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:08,071
I was written in as your wife
so that I could watch you and make sure the erasure took.

308
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:15,004
Sorry, Quaid.

309
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:17,174
Your whole life
is just a dream.

310
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:24,185
Okay, then if I'm not me,
who the hell am I?

311
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:25,349
Beats me.

312
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:28,524
I just work here.

313
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:39,402
Doug, there's something
I want you to know.

314
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:45,177
You were the best assignment
I ever had. Really.

315
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:46,948
I'm honored.

316
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:50,714
You sure you don't want to,
just for old times' sake?

317
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,279
Come on, if you don't trust me,
you can tie me up.

318
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:01,092
- I didn't know you were so kinky.
- Maybe it's time you found out.

319
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,593
Clever girl.

320
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:14,138
You wouldn't shoot me, will you? Doug.
after all we've been through.

321
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:17,072
Some of it was fun.

322
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:21,580
Nice knowing you.

323
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:57,575
Don't touch her.

324
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,708
Nobody here.

325
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,926
- Are you okay?
- I guess I blew it.

326
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,292
- What does he remember?
- Nothing, so far.

327
00:29:07,728 --> 00:29:09,286
I've got him.

328
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,442
Shit! He's going for the subway.
Let's get him. Go.

329
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:27,410
Let's go. Move it.

330
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:43,593
Pack your stuff
and get outta here.

331
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:45,595
What if they bring him back?

332
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,234
Not a chance.

333
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,675
Subway! Go!

334
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,720
Get him!
he's got a gun!

335
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:15,585
- Cut him off! That way!
- Over there!

336
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,856
Hold it!

337
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,224
The escalator.

338
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:52,629
You four go up.
you come with me.

339
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:09,240
Get out of the way!

340
00:31:11,986 --> 00:31:13,453
Get out of the way! Move!

341
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:45,478
The platform!

342
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,221
- Which way?
- To the right.

343
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,877
Botco.
tomorrow's fuels, tomorrow's prices.

344
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,390
Don't settle for pale memories.
Don't go for fake implants.

345
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,262
Experience space travel
the old-fashioned way...

346
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:31,425
on a real, live holiday
you can afford.

347
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:39,573
I want that fucker dead.

348
00:32:39,573 --> 00:32:42,667
I don't blame you, man. I wouldn't want a guy like
Quaid porking my old lady.

349
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:47,678
- You're saying she likes it?
- No, l'm sure she hated every minute of it.

350
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:52,980
Six-beta-nine, we have a live
transmission from Mr. Cohaagen.

351
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:56,749
- Richter here. Patch it through.
- You're a go, Mr. Cohaagen.

352
00:32:56,924 --> 00:33:00,427
- What is the fuck is going on down there?
- I'm trying to neutralize a traitor, sir.

353
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:02,861
If I wanted him dead, you moron.
I would have done it on earth.

354
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:05,524
We can't let him run around. He knows too much.

355
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:08,901
Lori says
he can't remember jackshit.

356
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,638
That's an hour, an hour
he could have total recall.

357
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,435
Listen to me, Richter. I want Quaid
delivered alive for reimplantation.

358
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,874
Have you got that?

359
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:21,004
I want him back in place
with Lori.

360
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:23,645
Did you hear me?

361
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,310
What was that, sir?
I couldn't hear you.

362
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:29,479
What are you doing?
I got Quaid again.

363
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,718
Switching to another channel, sir.
I've got sunspots.

364
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:36,687
- Call him back!
- I'm losing you.

365
00:33:36,964 --> 00:33:39,733
- Where is he?
- Second level, galleria.

366
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:42,065
We should've killed Quaid
on Mars.

367
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:08,893
- How are we doing?
- Fine.

368
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,661
Zooming in.

369
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:14,856
We got him!

370
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:37,487
lf you want to live,
don't hang up.

371
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,455
- What do you want?
- I've got your bug.

372
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,858
They'll be bust in your door in three minutes
unless you do exactly as l say.

373
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,796
Don't bother searching.
the bug's in your skull.

374
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,801
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

375
00:34:51,972 --> 00:34:54,842
Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.
that'll muffle the signal.

376
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,606
- How'd you find me?
- l'd advise you to hurry.

377
00:35:00,648 --> 00:35:03,913
This'll buy you some time.
they won't be able to pinpoint you.

378
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:14,293
- Shit!
- What?

379
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:16,952
- l lost him.
- Well, find him!

380
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:18,564
Yeah, right.

381
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:20,563
Come on, hurry up.
You look beautiful.

382
00:35:23,504 --> 00:35:26,598
Now go to the window.
go.

383
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,703
- Can you see me down here?
- Um-hum.

384
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:34,973
- This is the suitcase you gave me.
- I gave you?

385
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:38,785
I'm gonna set it here.
You come and get it, keep moving.

386
00:35:38,952 --> 00:35:40,852
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

387
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,582
- Who are you?
- We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.

388
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:48,058
You asked me, if you disappeared,
to come and find you, so here I am. Good-bye.

389
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:50,662
What was I doing on Mars?

390
00:35:55,135 --> 00:35:57,000
Excuse me, Mam, but this is mine.

391
00:35:57,204 --> 00:36:00,264
- I don't see your name on it.
- Someone left it for me.

392
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:03,171
- Find your own bag.
- Excuse me, Mam, but I need it!

393
00:36:04,478 --> 00:36:06,173
Fuck you, you asshole!

394
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:17,418
Son of a bitch's gotta be around here
somewhere.

395
00:36:21,695 --> 00:36:22,719
That guy there.

396
00:36:32,573 --> 00:36:35,940
Hello, l'm Johnnycab.
where can l take you tonight?

397
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:39,880
Drive. Drive!

398
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,974
- Would you please repeat the destination?
- Anywhere! Just go! Go!

399
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:45,114
Please state the street and number.

400
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:47,344
Shit. Shit!

401
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,117
l'm not familiar with that address.
would you please repeat--

402
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:00,299
Fasten your seat belt!

403
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:35,898
The fare is 18 credits, please.

404
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:37,400
Sue me, dickhead.

405
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:49,982
We hope you enjoyed the ride.

406
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:27,409
Howdy, stranger.
this is Hauser.

407
00:39:28,348 --> 00:39:30,884
lf things have gone wrong,
l'm talking to myself...

408
00:39:30,884 --> 00:39:33,910
and you've got a wet towel
wrapped around your head.

409
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:37,520
Whatever your name is,
get ready for the big surprise.

410
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:42,156
You are not you.
you are me.

411
00:39:43,096 --> 00:39:44,791
No shit.

412
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,100
Six-beta-nine,
six-beta-nine, come in.

413
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:50,868
Did you find him?

414
00:39:51,038 --> 00:39:53,871
We picked up an explosion
at the old cement factory.

415
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:57,133
- Send two units. We'll meet you there.
- Roger

416
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,847
All my life l've worked
for Mars Intelligence.

417
00:40:05,052 --> 00:40:06,954
I did Cohaagen's dirty work.

418
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:09,752
But a few weeks ago I met somebody, a woman.

419
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,753
And I learned a few things.

420
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:14,888
Like, I've been playing
for the wrong team.

421
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,900
All I can do now is try
to make up for it.

422
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,063
See, there's enough shit in here
to fuck Cohaagen good.

423
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:27,599
Unfortunately, if you're listening to this,
that means he has got to me first.

424
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:30,338
And here comes the hard part, old buddy.

425
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:32,637
Now it is all up to you.

426
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:34,072
Great.

427
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:47,624
- What have we got?
- Nothing here.

428
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:50,293
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.

429
00:40:50,397 --> 00:40:51,864
Split up. Find him.

430
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,830
First let's get rid
of that bug in your head.

431
00:40:55,068 --> 00:40:58,538
Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.

432
00:40:58,538 --> 00:41:00,369
Don't worry.
It's self-guiding.

433
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:08,974
Just shove real hard.

434
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:16,516
When you hear a crunches, you're there.

435
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,886
Just pull it out.

436
00:41:19,926 --> 00:41:22,156
Be careful.
It's my head too.

437
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:46,148
I've got a lock.

438
00:41:46,353 --> 00:41:47,650
Up. Let's go.

439
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:51,524
Now, this is the plan.

440
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,126
Get your ass to Mars...

441
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:56,391
then go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker I.D. at the desk.

442
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,491
That's all does to it.

443
00:41:59,538 --> 00:42:06,369
Just do what I tell you. If we can nail this son of a bitch who fucked you and me. 
I'm counting on you, Buddy.

444
00:42:06,773 --> 00:42:08,400
Don't let me down.

445
00:42:37,537 --> 00:42:38,526
Straight ahead.

446
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:44,008
In there.

447
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:53,986
There!

448
00:43:12,305 --> 00:43:13,135
Give me that.

449
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:19,701
Shit.

450
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:24,408
Get your ass to Mars--
get your ass to Mars--

451
00:43:57,984 --> 00:43:59,781
Welcome to the Mars Federal Colony.

452
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:03,418
For your safety and comfort,
domes have been installed...

453
00:44:03,757 --> 00:44:05,782
to protect you
from the vacuum outside.

454
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:09,453
Please do not touch
exterior windows or air locks.

455
00:44:09,696 --> 00:44:13,826
And since the air volume is limited. No smoking
is allowed anywhere in the colony.

456
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,989
Next.

457
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:19,267
Thank you,
and enjoy your stay on Mars.

458
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:20,803
Passport.

459
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:35,684
- Get out of the way.
- Make way!

460
00:44:36,022 --> 00:44:37,751
Stand back.

461
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,524
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you
right away.

462
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:49,293
Any news of Quaid?

463
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:52,302
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain.
- We've got a car to take you from the port.

464
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:56,874
- How long do you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

465
00:44:57,377 --> 00:44:59,470
Look at that shit.

466
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,980
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians love Kuato.

467
00:45:03,149 --> 00:45:05,413
They think he's fuckin' George Washington.

468
00:45:05,552 --> 00:45:07,042
Kill the bastard.

469
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,744
Nobody knows who he is.

470
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,652
Have you brought any fruits 
or vegetables onto the planet?

471
00:45:13,693 --> 00:45:14,921
Two weeks.

472
00:45:15,896 --> 00:45:16,885
Excuse me?

473
00:45:18,398 --> 00:45:20,229
Two weeks.

474
00:45:27,407 --> 00:45:29,500
It's not just graffiti.

475
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,974
The rebels took over
the refinery last night.

476
00:45:32,112 --> 00:45:33,704
No terbinium is going out.

477
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:35,745
And it gets worse.

478
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,697
Quaid.

479
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:00,138
- That's Quaid!
- Where?

480
00:46:00,273 --> 00:46:02,002
The woman!
get him-- her!

481
00:46:03,209 --> 00:46:04,801
Arrest that woman!

482
00:46:05,011 --> 00:46:06,478
Get that woman! Grab her!

483
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:37,406
Catch!

484
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,673
Get ready for a surprise!

485
00:47:52,685 --> 00:47:54,516
- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!

486
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:55,949
Open it!

487
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:57,717
They're all connected!

488
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:10,701
- That's terrible.
- And a few days ago cohaagen raised the price of air.

489
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,101
- Again?
- Nobody on Earth gives a damn what happens up here.

490
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:17,040
And they just want terbinium
so they can fight the stupid war.

491
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:19,008
Excuse me. What's that?

492
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:21,347
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

493
00:48:21,347 --> 00:48:24,714
I used to work there until
they found that alien shit inside.

494
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:27,519
Well, that's a rumor, isn't it?

495
00:48:27,687 --> 00:48:28,984
Think so?

496
00:48:59,586 --> 00:49:00,883
Mr. Cohaagen.

497
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,324
You wanted to see me, sir?

498
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,595
Richter...

499
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:17,827
do you know why I'm such a happy person?

500
00:49:18,271 --> 00:49:19,568
No, sir.

501
00:49:21,374 --> 00:49:24,741
Because I've got the greatest job
in the solar system.

502
00:49:25,145 --> 00:49:29,138
As long as the terbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.

503
00:49:29,282 --> 00:49:30,579
Anything.

504
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:33,777
In fact.,

505
00:49:33,987 --> 00:49:37,150
The only thing I ever worried about
is that one day...

506
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:39,417
if the rebels win...

507
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,084
it all might end...

508
00:49:42,262 --> 00:49:43,820
and you're fucking making it happen!

509
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:47,364
First you trying kill Quaid,
then you let him get away.

510
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:49,794
He had help from our side, sir.

511
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:52,429
I know that.

512
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:56,739
- But I thought--
- Who told you to think?

513
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:00,102
I don't give you 
enough information to think.

514
00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:05,243
You do what you're told.
that's what you do.

515
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,681
Yes, sir.

516
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:15,592
Now, let's get down to business.

517
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,560
We've got
a tricky situation here.

518
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:22,229
Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.

519
00:50:23,636 --> 00:50:26,969
And he might be able to get it.
cause they say he's psychic.

520
00:50:28,408 --> 00:50:31,206
And I have a plan
to keep this from happening.

521
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:36,545
Do you think you could play along?

522
00:50:36,716 --> 00:50:38,946
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

523
00:50:39,052 --> 00:50:41,350
Cause otherwise, I'll erase your ass.

524
00:50:59,472 --> 00:51:03,340
Taxi? You need a taxi?
Sir, I got magazines, music, whisky.

525
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:06,176
You need a cab, Man?
Come on!

526
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,237
Afternoon! Can I help you?

527
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:35,772
Yes, I would like a room, please.

528
00:51:41,147 --> 00:51:43,980
Nice to have you back, Mr. Brubaker.
would you like the same suite?

529
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,412
Definitely.

530
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,712
Seemed you've left something in our safe.

531
00:51:49,822 --> 00:51:50,652
Could you get it?

532
00:51:57,196 --> 00:51:58,595
Identification?

533
00:52:07,974 --> 00:52:10,272
- I'll go and code your room key.
- Thank you.

534
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:30,192
- There you go, Mr Brubaker. Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

535
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:32,661
- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

536
00:52:44,844 --> 00:52:46,141
Thank you.

537
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:53,715
Hey, man, you need a cab?

538
00:52:53,886 --> 00:52:58,346
- What's wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

539
00:52:58,524 --> 00:53:00,822
- Where's yours?
- Right over there, Man.

540
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:05,854
Hey, asshole!
that's my fare!

541
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:07,427
Eat this!

542
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:08,761
Damn you, Benny!

543
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:16,607
Welcome to Mars, man!

544
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:24,374
- What the hell was that, an accident?
- That's the rebels, man.

545
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:25,847
Let's get outta here...

546
00:53:26,185 --> 00:53:27,777
before they arrest us!

547
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:30,256
What do the rebels want?

548
00:53:30,256 --> 00:53:33,123
All the usual.
more money, more freedom, more air.

549
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:39,658
So, where to?

550
00:53:39,766 --> 00:53:41,461
Last Resort.

551
00:53:41,634 --> 00:53:43,534
You're getting off
to an early start.

552
00:53:44,637 --> 00:53:46,730
- First time on Mars?
- Yes.

553
00:53:46,906 --> 00:53:48,669
Well, actually, no.

554
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,536
Well, sort of.

555
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:54,578
Damn, the man don't even know
whether he's been to Mars or not.

556
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:07,522
Voila. Venusville.

557
00:54:08,694 --> 00:54:10,992
Hey, you see anything you like?

558
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:18,395
Well, this is the end of the line.
we'd better walk from here.

559
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:20,368
I'll show you the way.

560
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:24,202
- Do you wanna know the future?
- What about the past?

561
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:28,073
Come on, it's around the corner,
right down this alley.

562
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:30,112
They got everything.

563
00:54:32,718 --> 00:54:34,515
Not bad, huh?

564
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:39,817
Read your palm? Your mind? Your aura?
probe the secrets of your heart?

565
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:42,751
- I bet I can guess your birthday.
- What is it?

566
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:45,693
- You're a Taurus, right?
- How did you guess?

567
00:54:48,568 --> 00:54:50,763
- Tell me something, are all the psychics--
- Freaks?

568
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:52,837
Afraid so.
It goes with the territory.

569
00:54:53,072 --> 00:54:58,305
- What happened to them?
- Cheap domes, and no air to clean up the rays.

570
00:54:58,478 --> 00:55:02,278
So, this is it. The Last Resort.
you sure you want to go in here?

571
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:05,542
- Why not?
- I know this much better place down the street.

572
00:55:05,685 --> 00:55:08,518
The girls are cleaner,
the liquor ain't watered down--

573
00:55:08,688 --> 00:55:10,849
Sure, and you get kickbacks.

574
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,759
Hey, man,
I got five kids to feed.

575
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:15,522
Take them to the dentist.

576
00:55:15,962 --> 00:55:18,297
Thanks, mister!
Hey, mister, I'll be waiting for you.

577
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:20,527
Take your time.
Benny's the name. Benny!

578
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,811
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Melina.

579
00:55:42,955 --> 00:55:44,616
She's busy.

580
00:55:44,657 --> 00:55:46,648
But Mary here, she's free.

581
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:50,128
Well, not free, honey, but...

582
00:55:51,063 --> 00:55:52,360
available. Hahaha.

583
00:55:55,568 --> 00:55:57,798
Thanks.
I'll wait for Melina.

584
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,028
Earth slime.

585
00:55:59,372 --> 00:56:01,841
Thing is, friend,
mel's real picky.

586
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:03,866
She kinds sticks to her regulars.

587
00:56:04,377 --> 00:56:06,208
She'll like me.

588
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:08,708
Mel! Hey, Mel!

589
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:47,679
Hello, Hauser.

590
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:50,652
Still bulging, I see.

591
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:55,457
- What have you been feeding this thing?
- Blondes.

592
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:58,593
I think it's still hungry.

593
00:57:01,033 --> 00:57:03,900
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here, Hauser.

594
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,202
Look who's talking.

595
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:09,141
Hey, Tony,
give the big guy a break.

596
00:57:09,141 --> 00:57:11,336
Relax. You'll live longer.

597
00:57:11,844 --> 00:57:13,141
Come on.

598
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:23,225
- Honey, take care of Tony, will you?
- No problem.

599
00:57:23,225 --> 00:57:25,989
If you need any help with this one,
give me a holler.

600
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,210
You son of a bitch.

601
00:57:43,446 --> 00:57:46,006
You're alive? I thought that
Cohaagen tortured you to death.

602
00:57:46,148 --> 00:57:47,911
Well, I guess he didn't.

603
00:57:47,984 --> 00:57:51,681
And you couldn't get me a message? You
never even wondered what happened to me?

604
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:01,559
Hauser! Hauser, thank God you're alive.

605
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:05,194
Melin-- Melina.
Melina.

606
00:58:07,269 --> 00:58:10,033
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

607
00:58:10,272 --> 00:58:13,833
- I don't remember you.
- What are you talking about?

608
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:16,035
I don't remember you.

609
00:58:16,212 --> 00:58:19,443
I don't remember us.
I don't even remember me.

610
00:58:21,317 --> 00:58:23,751
Oh, what? Did you get amnesia?
how did you get here?

611
00:58:23,986 --> 00:58:26,216
- Hauser left me a note.
- You're Hauser.

612
00:58:26,555 --> 00:58:28,386
Not anymore.

613
00:58:28,557 --> 00:58:31,788
Now I'm Quaid.
Douglas Quaid.

614
00:58:34,997 --> 00:58:38,868
- Hauser, you've lost your mind.
- I didn't lose my mind. Cohaagen stole it.

615
00:58:38,868 --> 00:58:43,237
He found out that Hauser switched sides,
so he turned him into somebody else: me.

616
00:58:43,673 --> 00:58:45,072
This is too weird.

617
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:47,834
He dumped me on earth
with a wife and a lousy job--

618
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:50,843
Did you say... Did you say wife?
are you fucking married?

619
00:58:51,047 --> 00:58:52,878
- She wasn't really my wife.
- Oh, she isn't really your wife?

620
00:58:53,082 --> 00:58:55,484
How stupid of me.
she was Hauser's wife?

621
00:58:55,484 --> 00:58:58,078
- Look, forget that I said wife.
- No, let's just forget everything.

622
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:02,184
- I'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.
- Why would I lie to you?

623
00:59:03,325 --> 00:59:06,590
Because you're still
working for Cohaagen.

624
00:59:06,896 --> 00:59:09,296
Don't be ridiculous.

625
00:59:12,068 --> 00:59:14,195
You never loved me, Hauser.

626
00:59:14,336 --> 00:59:16,167
You just used me to get inside.

627
00:59:16,372 --> 00:59:18,135
Inside what?

628
00:59:22,378 --> 00:59:24,278
I think you'd better leave.

629
00:59:24,346 --> 00:59:27,611
- Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
- I'm not falling for it.

630
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,952
He says there's enough in here
to nail Cohaagen for good.

631
00:59:29,952 --> 00:59:31,749
- Get out!
- You've got to help me remember!

632
00:59:32,021 --> 00:59:34,046
- I said, get out!
- Melina, please!

633
00:59:34,323 --> 00:59:36,154
People are trying to kill me.

634
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:38,786
Really?

635
00:59:41,163 --> 00:59:43,188
All right, I'm leaving.

636
00:59:55,311 --> 00:59:58,144
Baby, you make me wish
I had three hands.

637
00:59:58,314 --> 01:00:00,976
Well, I think you're doing
just fine with two.

638
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,414
Excuse me, baby.
we'll pick this up later.

639
01:00:03,552 --> 01:00:05,986
Hey, that didn't take long.

640
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:08,521
Listen, let me ask you a question.
did you ever fuck a mutant?

641
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:11,159
- Take me to the hotel.
- I know these Siamese twins.

642
01:00:11,327 --> 01:00:13,887
Man, you won't know
if you're coming or going.

643
01:00:23,506 --> 01:00:27,135
This afternoon at 4:30 p.m., I signed
an order declaring martial law...

644
01:00:27,376 --> 01:00:29,571
throughout the Mars Federal Colony.

645
01:00:29,879 --> 01:00:34,248
I will not tolerate any further damage
to our mineral export operations.

646
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:36,543
Mr. Kuato and his terrorists
must understand...

647
01:00:36,852 --> 01:00:40,151
that their self-defeating efforts
will only bring misery and suffering to the people...

648
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:45,019
Mr. Quaid?

649
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:47,021
What?

650
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:49,358
I need to talk to you
about Mr. Hauser.

651
01:00:50,633 --> 01:00:52,965
- Who are you?
- Dr. Edgemar from Rekall.

652
01:00:53,035 --> 01:00:55,196
- How did you find me?
- It's a little difficult to explain.

653
01:00:55,471 --> 01:00:58,201
Could you open the door?
I'm unarmed.

654
01:01:00,109 --> 01:01:02,907
Don't worry. I'm alone.
may I come in?

655
01:01:05,181 --> 01:01:08,217
- What do you want?
- This is gonna be very difficult for you to accept, Mr Quaid.

656
01:01:08,217 --> 01:01:11,675
- I'm listening.
- I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.

657
01:01:13,656 --> 01:01:16,921
- Hum. You know. Doc, you could fool me.
- I'm quite serious.

658
01:01:17,059 --> 01:01:20,187
You're not here and neither am l.

659
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:21,489
That's amazing.

660
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,793
- Where are we?
- At Rekall.

661
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:26,731
You're strapped into
an implant chair...

662
01:01:26,936 --> 01:01:29,530
and l'm monitoring you
from the psychoprobe console.

663
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:33,209
Ah, I get it.
I'm dreaming.

664
01:01:33,209 --> 01:01:36,576
And all this is a part of the delightful
vacation your company has sold me.

665
01:01:37,012 --> 01:01:38,309
Not exactly.

666
01:01:38,414 --> 01:01:42,475
What you're experiencing is a free-form
delusion based on our memory tapes...

667
01:01:42,618 --> 01:01:45,178
but you're inventing it
yourself as you go along.

668
01:01:46,488 --> 01:01:49,924
Well, if it is my delusion,
who the hell invited you?

669
01:01:50,025 --> 01:01:53,791
I've been artificially implanted
as an emergency measure.

670
01:01:54,029 --> 01:01:57,226
I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr Quaid,
but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

671
01:01:57,299 --> 01:01:59,665
We can't snap you
out of your fantasy...

672
01:02:00,102 --> 01:02:03,094
and l've been sent in
to try to talk you down.

673
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:05,036
How much is Cohaagen
paying you for this?

674
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:10,368
Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

675
01:02:10,613 --> 01:02:13,013
Everything after that--
the chases, the trip to Mars...

676
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:17,683
the suite at the Hilton are all elements
of your Rekall Holiday and Ego Trip.

677
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,215
You paid to be a secret agent.

678
01:02:20,356 --> 01:02:22,824
Bullshit. It's coincidence.

679
01:02:22,992 --> 01:02:25,358
And what about the girl?

680
01:02:25,527 --> 01:02:28,223
Brunette, athletic,
sleazy and demure?

681
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:30,921
Just as you specified.
Is that coincidence?

682
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,536
Uh. She's real. l dreamt about her
before I even went to Rekall.

683
01:02:34,703 --> 01:02:36,864
Mr. Quaid.

684
01:02:37,006 --> 01:02:40,908
Can you hear yourself?
she's real because you dreamed her?

685
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:43,977
- That's right.
- Oh, maybe this'll convince you.

686
01:02:44,213 --> 01:02:46,511
Would you mind opening the door?

687
01:02:48,317 --> 01:02:50,717
- You open it.
- No need to be rude.

688
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,849
I'll do it.

689
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:00,621
Sweetheart?

690
01:03:03,332 --> 01:03:05,323
Come in, Mrs. Quaid.

691
01:03:09,538 --> 01:03:12,405
- What I supposed you're not here either.
- I'm here...

692
01:03:12,608 --> 01:03:15,168
at Rekall.

693
01:03:19,048 --> 01:03:20,481
I love you.

694
01:03:20,683 --> 01:03:24,050
Right. That's why
you tried to kill me.

695
01:03:24,219 --> 01:03:28,121
No. I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

696
01:03:28,324 --> 01:03:30,519
I want you to come back to me.

697
01:03:32,328 --> 01:03:35,564
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid?

698
01:03:35,564 --> 01:03:39,967
That you're having a paranoid episode
triggered by acute neurochemical trauma?

699
01:03:40,135 --> 01:03:43,969
Or that you're really
an invincible secret agent from Mars...

700
01:03:44,406 --> 01:03:48,644
who's the victim of an interplanetary
conspiracy to make him think...

701
01:03:48,644 --> 01:03:50,475
he's a lowly construction worker?

702
01:03:58,287 --> 01:04:00,619
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

703
01:04:00,789 --> 01:04:03,622
You're a fine, upstanding man.
you have a beautiful wife who loves you.

704
01:04:05,194 --> 01:04:07,059
Your whole life is ahead of you.

705
01:04:09,131 --> 01:04:11,725
But you've got to want
to return to reality.

706
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:16,731
Let's assume I do, Then what?

707
01:04:19,608 --> 01:04:22,509
- Swallow this.
- What is it?

708
01:04:22,745 --> 01:04:26,476
lt's a symbol of your desire
to return to reality.

709
01:04:26,682 --> 01:04:28,980
Inside your dream,
you'll fall asleep.

710
01:04:33,022 --> 01:04:37,083
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.

711
01:04:37,226 --> 01:04:39,820
Then I could pull this trigger
and it won't matter.

712
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:43,021
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make a slightest difference to me, Doug.

713
01:04:43,165 --> 01:04:47,625
But the consequences to you would be
devastating. In your mind I'll be dead.

714
01:04:47,803 --> 01:04:51,068
With no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.

715
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,504
Doug, let Dr. Edgemar help you.

716
01:04:53,675 --> 01:04:55,973
The walls of reality
will come crashing down.

717
01:04:56,715 --> 01:05:01,774
One minute, you will be hero who saved rebel clause.
And the next thing you konw, you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

718
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:05,721
You'll even have fantasies about
alien civilizations, as you requested...

719
01:05:05,721 --> 01:05:08,349
but in the end,
back on earth you'll be lobotomized!

720
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:14,262
So get a grip on yourself, Doug,
and put down that gun!

721
01:05:20,636 --> 01:05:23,764
Good. Now take the pill
and put it in your mouth.

722
01:05:28,644 --> 01:05:30,703
Swallow it!

723
01:05:33,215 --> 01:05:35,706
Go ahead, sweetheart.

724
01:05:58,273 --> 01:06:01,572
Now you've done it.
Now you've done it!

725
01:06:22,731 --> 01:06:25,029
That's for making me come to Mars.

726
01:06:26,368 --> 01:06:29,166
You know how much I hate
this fucking planet!

727
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,966
Cuff him.

728
01:06:39,748 --> 01:06:42,979
- I got him.
- Good. Bring him down in the service elevator.

729
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,753
Let's go.

730
01:08:00,262 --> 01:08:01,320
Fuck you!

731
01:08:12,341 --> 01:08:13,103
Doug.

732
01:08:15,244 --> 01:08:17,109
Honey...

733
01:08:17,346 --> 01:08:19,837
you wouldn't hurt me,
would you, sweetheart?

734
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:24,913
Sweetheart, be reasonable.

735
01:08:25,053 --> 01:08:27,044
After all, we're married.

736
01:08:32,794 --> 01:08:34,091
Consider that a divorce.

737
01:08:36,531 --> 01:08:38,158
That was your wife?

738
01:08:42,271 --> 01:08:43,499
What a bitch.

739
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,545
Hey, get out of the way!

740
01:08:56,118 --> 01:08:58,643
I thought you didn't like me.

741
01:08:59,054 --> 01:09:01,890
If Cohaagen wants you dead,
you might be okay.

742
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:05,087
- Got it.
- So you've come back to apologize.

743
01:09:05,394 --> 01:09:07,385
Kuato wants to see you.

744
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:10,526
Come on.

745
01:09:39,161 --> 01:09:40,719
- Now what?
- Jump!

746
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:14,190
No! Don't do it!
you'll crack the fucking dome!

747
01:10:17,966 --> 01:10:21,129
What are you trying to do, kill us?
The dome will crack!

748
01:10:33,315 --> 01:10:34,339
Move!

749
01:10:36,485 --> 01:10:38,180
Taxi!

750
01:10:39,321 --> 01:10:41,152
Melina! Melina!

751
01:10:44,226 --> 01:10:45,750
- Need a ride?
- Last Resort, quick!

752
01:10:46,094 --> 01:10:47,425
You guys are going in circles.

753
01:10:52,567 --> 01:10:53,431
Jesus!

754
01:10:53,635 --> 01:10:55,933
Come on! You drive!

755
01:10:56,071 --> 01:10:57,095
You guys are in trouble?

756
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:58,672
Go! Go!

757
01:11:09,718 --> 01:11:12,516
- What are you trying to do to me, Man?
- Shut up and drive!

758
01:11:12,721 --> 01:11:15,019
Hey, I got five kids to feed!

759
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:50,182
Shit!

760
01:11:50,325 --> 01:11:52,054
No brakes!

761
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,659
You idiot!

762
01:11:57,132 --> 01:11:57,996
What the hell are you doing?

763
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:13,513
Christ! Now they're after me!

764
01:12:14,683 --> 01:12:16,275
Give me that!

765
01:12:16,485 --> 01:12:18,077
Get out of the way!

766
01:12:24,826 --> 01:12:26,123
Tony!

767
01:12:29,798 --> 01:12:32,198
Get out of the way!
come on!

768
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:34,665
Come on! Come on!

769
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,502
Thank you, Tony.

770
01:13:04,599 --> 01:13:06,658
Hey, you wanna, have some fun?

771
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:08,003
Where are they?

772
01:13:08,003 --> 01:13:10,471
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

773
01:13:19,414 --> 01:13:20,574
Maybe you know.

774
01:13:27,556 --> 01:13:29,114
Kill them all!

775
01:13:43,405 --> 01:13:44,429
Thumbelina!

776
01:14:09,698 --> 01:14:11,166
Richter!

777
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:14,260
- A call from Cohaagen!
- Richter here.

778
01:14:14,336 --> 01:14:17,169
- We've got them pinned down.
- Stop fighting and pull out.

779
01:14:17,672 --> 01:14:19,401
But they've got Quaid.
they're protecting him.

780
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:23,542
Perfect.
get out of Sector G now.

781
01:14:24,145 --> 01:14:25,510
Don't think.

782
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,342
- Do it!
- Yes, sir.

783
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:30,142
Pull'em out.

784
01:14:30,352 --> 01:14:32,513
Everybody, pull out!

785
01:14:32,687 --> 01:14:34,245
Move!

786
01:14:43,398 --> 01:14:46,196
- Cohaagen's sealing off the area!
- Come on, Benny!

787
01:15:47,262 --> 01:15:49,059
The first settlers
are buried here.

788
01:15:49,264 --> 01:15:53,098
They worked themselves to death, but
cohaagen ended up with all the money.

789
01:15:53,301 --> 01:15:56,031
He built cheap domes and watched
the kids turn into freaks.

790
01:15:56,204 --> 01:15:57,501
I saw them.

791
01:15:57,706 --> 01:16:00,174
And if you want to breathe,
you have to buy his air.

792
01:16:00,375 --> 01:16:01,899
Maybe you can change all that.

793
01:16:02,077 --> 01:16:06,207
Hey, I think my grandpa
might be here.

794
01:16:06,347 --> 01:16:07,916
So what can I do?

795
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:10,441
Kuato's gonna make you remember some
things you knew when you were Hauser.

796
01:16:10,618 --> 01:16:13,280
- Like what?
- All sorts of things.

797
01:16:13,722 --> 01:16:16,589
- Like maybe you'll remember you loved me.
- I don't need Kuato for that.

798
01:16:17,959 --> 01:16:19,722
Since when?

799
01:16:29,771 --> 01:16:30,567
Freeze!

800
01:16:30,772 --> 01:16:32,899
Come on, Melina.

801
01:16:34,275 --> 01:16:35,674
Kuato's waiting.

802
01:16:35,877 --> 01:16:37,970
Hey, I didn't find Grandpa, but--

803
01:16:39,347 --> 01:16:40,780
Oh, shit.

804
01:16:40,949 --> 01:16:44,043
- Who's this?
- He helped us get away.

805
01:16:44,152 --> 01:16:48,282
Hey, don't worry about me, man.
l'm on your side.

806
01:16:59,033 --> 01:17:00,830
You're a mutant, huh?

807
01:17:01,035 --> 01:17:03,230
All right, let's go.

808
01:17:18,186 --> 01:17:20,984
- Have you tried ramming down the door?
- You wait here. Follow me.

809
01:17:21,322 --> 01:17:23,119
It won't do any good.

810
01:17:23,324 --> 01:17:26,657
- Cohaagen depressurized the tunnels.
- Then drill through to Section M.

811
01:17:26,828 --> 01:17:29,661
We can't.
we're running out of air.

812
01:17:29,864 --> 01:17:31,699
We need help.

813
01:17:31,699 --> 01:17:34,293
Okay, sit tight.
melina just got here with Quaid.

814
01:17:35,737 --> 01:17:37,261
I hope he was worth it.

815
01:17:37,438 --> 01:17:39,030
So do I.

816
01:17:41,476 --> 01:17:43,273
- I'm glad you made it.
- You don't look glad.

817
01:17:43,478 --> 01:17:46,777
Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.
he shut off the air.

818
01:17:46,915 --> 01:17:49,076
You must know something
pretty damn important, Quaid.

819
01:17:49,217 --> 01:17:51,019
He wants you.

820
01:17:51,019 --> 01:17:54,750
If we don't hand you over, everybody
in this sector will be dead by morning.

821
01:17:55,156 --> 01:17:56,748
Then we don't have much choice, do we.

822
01:17:56,925 --> 01:17:58,290
We can't turn him in.

823
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,792
That's up to Kuato.
come with me, Quaid.

824
01:18:16,344 --> 01:18:18,141
Sit down.

825
01:18:18,346 --> 01:18:21,076
- Where's Kuato?
- On his way.

826
01:18:21,282 --> 01:18:23,807
You heard the rumors
about the Pyramid Mine?

827
01:18:23,985 --> 01:18:25,720
Yeah.

828
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,951
Cohaagen found something weird inside
and it's got him scared shitless.

829
01:18:29,257 --> 01:18:31,418
What? Aliens?

830
01:18:32,994 --> 01:18:35,861
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

831
01:18:36,064 --> 01:18:38,589
Yes, you do.
that's why we brought you here.

832
01:18:38,766 --> 01:18:41,166
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole...

833
01:18:41,336 --> 01:18:43,167
you call a brain.

834
01:18:46,007 --> 01:18:47,872
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

835
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:51,246
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.

836
01:18:51,246 --> 01:18:54,977
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.

837
01:19:34,088 --> 01:19:36,181
What do you want, Mr. Quaid?

838
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:38,955
Same as you: to remember.

839
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,788
But why?

840
01:19:41,996 --> 01:19:45,159
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.

841
01:19:48,369 --> 01:19:50,599
A man is defined by his actions...

842
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,031
not his memory.

843
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:56,436
Please...

844
01:19:56,611 --> 01:19:58,704
take my hands.

845
01:20:04,018 --> 01:20:06,452
Now open your mind to me.

846
01:20:07,588 --> 01:20:09,055
Please.

847
01:20:11,893 --> 01:20:14,361
Open your mind.

848
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:19,163
Open your mind.

849
01:20:21,369 --> 01:20:24,805
Open your mind.

850
01:20:26,574 --> 01:20:30,169
Open your mind.

851
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:36,412
Open your mind.

852
01:21:06,681 --> 01:21:08,945
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.

853
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:11,677
I say we throw the switch
and see what happens.

854
01:21:11,819 --> 01:21:13,719
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.

855
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:16,515
The chain reaction could spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

856
01:21:16,724 --> 01:21:19,694
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.

857
01:21:19,694 --> 01:21:21,821
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?

858
01:21:22,196 --> 01:21:25,461
Who knows what the hell they thought?
they weren't human.

859
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,034
Maybe it's a trap.
maybe they want a meltdown.

860
01:21:28,202 --> 01:21:30,466
We don't even know
if this piece of junk will work.

861
01:21:30,605 --> 01:21:32,740
What is it?
a million? Half a million?

862
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:35,868
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.

863
01:21:36,444 --> 01:21:37,934
Let's make sure Kuato--

864
01:22:08,743 --> 01:22:12,577
Wake up! Wake up!
come on, wake up!

865
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:16,541
They found us! Shit!
Let's go!

866
01:22:17,819 --> 01:22:19,878
Wake up! Snap out of it!
Now! Come on!

867
01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:25,887
They found us!

868
01:22:26,027 --> 01:22:27,517
- Everybody out!
- Melina!

869
01:22:27,695 --> 01:22:29,686
Get moving! Get out!

870
01:22:30,965 --> 01:22:31,590
Get out!

871
01:22:41,742 --> 01:22:43,607
Everybody out! Get out!

872
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,848
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

873
01:22:53,621 --> 01:22:55,054
Benny, come on!

874
01:22:59,193 --> 01:23:01,787
- Benny!
- I'm coming!

875
01:23:20,982 --> 01:23:24,577
Put these spacesuits on!
we're going outside!

876
01:23:27,588 --> 01:23:29,112
Benny, hurry.

877
01:23:36,797 --> 01:23:38,599
Congratulations, Quaid.

878
01:23:38,599 --> 01:23:40,760
You led us right to him.

879
01:23:41,169 --> 01:23:43,797
How can you do this?
you're a mutant.

880
01:23:44,906 --> 01:23:46,737
I got four kids to feed.

881
01:23:46,908 --> 01:23:48,933
So what happened to number five?

882
01:23:51,612 --> 01:23:54,012
Ah, shit, man. You got me.

883
01:23:54,215 --> 01:23:55,807
I ain't even married.

884
01:23:56,017 --> 01:23:58,076
Now put your fucking hands
in the air!

885
01:24:04,058 --> 01:24:05,491
Quaid.

886
01:24:07,662 --> 01:24:09,653
Quaid.

887
01:24:11,065 --> 01:24:15,399
Forget it, man.
his fortunetelling days are over.

888
01:24:17,371 --> 01:24:20,033
Start the reactor.

889
01:24:20,274 --> 01:24:22,071
Free Mars.

890
01:24:27,081 --> 01:24:29,606
Mr. Cohaagen would like to talk to you.

891
01:24:37,825 --> 01:24:40,089
So this is the great man.

892
01:24:45,132 --> 01:24:47,032
No wonder he kept out of sight.

893
01:24:49,403 --> 01:24:51,200
Well, my boy...

894
01:24:53,741 --> 01:24:54,639
you're a hero.

895
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:55,773
Fuck you.

896
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:59,639
Don't be modest.
Kuato is dead.

897
01:24:59,847 --> 01:25:04,079
The resistance has been completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.

898
01:25:04,185 --> 01:25:05,584
He's lying.

899
01:25:06,454 --> 01:25:08,684
You two-faced bastard.

900
01:25:10,658 --> 01:25:14,094
You can't blame him, angel.
he's innocent.

901
01:25:15,896 --> 01:25:20,128
You see, Quaid, none of my people
could get close to Kuato.

902
01:25:20,268 --> 01:25:23,066
Fucking mutants
could always sniff us out.

903
01:25:23,271 --> 01:25:27,298
So Hauser and I sat down
and invented you, the perfect mole.

904
01:25:27,441 --> 01:25:30,706
You know you're lying.
hauser turned against you.

905
01:25:34,348 --> 01:25:36,145
That's what we wanted
you to think.

906
01:25:36,651 --> 01:25:40,554
The fact is, Hauser volunteered
to become Doug Quaid.

907
01:25:40,554 --> 01:25:43,387
It was the only way
to fool the psychics.

908
01:25:43,891 --> 01:25:45,222
Get your story straight.

909
01:25:45,393 --> 01:25:48,885
This idiot here has been trying to kill me
ever since l went to Rekall.

910
01:25:49,063 --> 01:25:51,190
You don't kill somebody
you're trying to plant.

911
01:25:51,332 --> 01:25:55,132
He wasn't in on it.
you set him off by going to Rekall.

912
01:25:55,336 --> 01:25:58,169
- So why am l still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.

913
01:25:58,339 --> 01:26:00,207
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.

914
01:26:00,207 --> 01:26:03,699
The guy with the suitcase,
the mask, the money...

915
01:26:03,978 --> 01:26:07,778
the message from Hauser,
all of that was set up by us.

916
01:26:08,115 --> 01:26:10,413
Sorry. Too perfect.

917
01:26:10,751 --> 01:26:12,218
Perfect, my ass!

918
01:26:12,286 --> 01:26:14,846
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.

919
01:26:14,989 --> 01:26:18,857
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.

920
01:26:19,093 --> 01:26:21,789
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

921
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:24,663
Well, Cohaagen...

922
01:26:24,799 --> 01:26:28,257
I have to hand it to you.
It's the best mind-fuck yet.

923
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:32,867
Well, don't take my word for it.

924
01:26:34,108 --> 01:26:37,009
-Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
-Who is it this time?

925
01:26:37,244 --> 01:26:39,109
My mother?

926
01:26:41,282 --> 01:26:42,681
Howdy, Quaid.

927
01:26:42,883 --> 01:26:46,182
If you're listening to this,
that means Kuato is dead...

928
01:26:46,354 --> 01:26:48,720
and you have led us to him.

929
01:26:48,889 --> 01:26:50,658
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

930
01:26:50,658 --> 01:26:52,683
Sorry for the shit
I've put you through, but hey...

931
01:26:53,127 --> 01:26:55,563
what are friends for?

932
01:26:55,563 --> 01:26:58,726
I would like to wish you happiness
and long life, old buddy...

933
01:26:58,999 --> 01:27:01,832
but unfortunately,
this is not gonna happen.

934
01:27:02,002 --> 01:27:06,063
You see, it's my body you've got there
and I want it back.

935
01:27:06,407 --> 01:27:10,707
Sorry to be an Indian giver,
but I was here first.

936
01:27:10,878 --> 01:27:13,278
So adios, amigo.

937
01:27:13,447 --> 01:27:16,712
And thanks for not
getting yourself killed.

938
01:27:16,851 --> 01:27:19,217
Hey, maybe we'll meet in our dreams.

939
01:27:22,990 --> 01:27:24,821
You'll never know.

940
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:31,721
You bastards!

941
01:27:49,984 --> 01:27:51,281
Let go of me!

942
01:28:07,435 --> 01:28:09,494
- Ready?
- Auto.

943
01:28:09,804 --> 01:28:12,466
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.

944
01:28:14,608 --> 01:28:16,906
Relax, Quaid.

945
01:28:17,044 --> 01:28:20,207
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.

946
01:28:20,347 --> 01:28:23,510
Not true.
He's one of my best friends.

947
01:28:23,651 --> 01:28:26,279
Besides, he's got a big house and a Mercedes.

948
01:28:26,821 --> 01:28:30,655
And you like Melina, right?
You'll get to fuck her every night.

949
01:28:30,858 --> 01:28:33,918
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.

950
01:28:34,028 --> 01:28:36,121
I'll bust his balls.

951
01:28:38,332 --> 01:28:40,493
Uh-uh, princess.

952
01:28:40,801 --> 01:28:42,970
We're having you fixed.

953
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:46,201
You're gonna be respectful, compliant...

954
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,876
and appreciative.
The way a woman should be.

955
01:28:54,014 --> 01:28:56,005
Mr. Cohaagen, telephone.

956
01:28:58,886 --> 01:29:00,319
Yes? What is it?

957
01:29:00,354 --> 01:29:03,084
Sir. The oxygen level
is bottoming out in Sector G.

958
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:05,215
What do you want me
to do about it?

959
01:29:05,626 --> 01:29:09,790
- Don't do anything.
- But they won't last an hour, sir.

960
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:10,919
Fuck them.

961
01:29:11,065 --> 01:29:13,431
It'll be a good lesson to the others.

962
01:29:13,601 --> 01:29:16,195
Come on, Cohaagen! You got what you want.
give these people air.

963
01:29:16,403 --> 01:29:19,998
My friend, in five minutes
you won't give a shit about the people.

964
01:29:20,241 --> 01:29:21,333
Fire it up, Doc.

965
01:29:21,509 --> 01:29:23,500
Excuse me, Doctor.

966
01:29:23,844 --> 01:29:25,869
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.

967
01:29:26,914 --> 01:29:28,074
Oh, really?

968
01:29:38,392 --> 01:29:39,916
Oh, Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.

969
01:29:40,294 --> 01:29:42,956
Why don't you and Melina drop by.
Remind him, Doc.

970
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:45,360
- Sure.
- See you at the party.

971
01:30:00,047 --> 01:30:02,379
Keep still.
fighting just makes it hurt.

972
01:30:15,362 --> 01:30:18,092
lf you don't keep still,
you'll end up psychotic.

973
01:30:22,369 --> 01:30:23,666
Hey, don't!

974
01:30:30,778 --> 01:30:32,370
Melina, hold on!

975
01:30:55,436 --> 01:30:58,667
Are you all right?
Are you still you?

976
01:30:58,772 --> 01:31:02,105
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?

977
01:31:05,212 --> 01:31:06,474
Let's get the hell out of here.

978
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:36,168
You have to make a decision, sir.

979
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:48,117
Kill him.

980
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:51,255
It's about goddamn time.

981
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:45,572
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.

982
01:32:45,646 --> 01:32:49,309
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!

983
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:53,216
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!

984
01:32:53,721 --> 01:32:56,781
The reactor makes air.
that's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.

985
01:32:56,924 --> 01:32:58,448
Where's this reactor come from?

986
01:32:58,625 --> 01:33:00,527
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?

987
01:33:00,527 --> 01:33:03,724
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.

988
01:33:06,667 --> 01:33:07,827
What the hell--

989
01:33:32,459 --> 01:33:33,289
Quaid!

990
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:36,486
Hey, Quaid, you remember me?

991
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,860
Benny! Benny's the name! Hahahaha.

992
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,547
Oh, that's good!

993
01:34:00,287 --> 01:34:02,489
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!

994
01:34:02,489 --> 01:34:04,354
I'm gonna grind you up!

995
01:34:11,799 --> 01:34:13,699
I'm coming!

996
01:34:13,867 --> 01:34:15,459
I'm coming for you, baby!

997
01:34:30,984 --> 01:34:33,145
What the fuck is this?

998
01:34:39,827 --> 01:34:41,886
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

999
01:34:44,198 --> 01:34:46,666
Hey, Quaid,
I'm gonna squash you!

1000
01:34:48,035 --> 01:34:49,832
Benny, here!

1001
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:54,664
Where the fuck are you?

1002
01:35:00,547 --> 01:35:02,037
Screw you!

1003
01:35:08,222 --> 01:35:10,417
Quaid, get over here!

1004
01:35:10,557 --> 01:35:12,081
What is it?

1005
01:35:13,894 --> 01:35:14,883
There's an opening.

1006
01:35:15,362 --> 01:35:16,795
I knew it.

1007
01:35:45,692 --> 01:35:48,729
This whole thing is one big reactor
made out of terbinium.

1008
01:35:48,729 --> 01:35:52,130
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
the bastard won't turn it on.

1009
01:35:52,566 --> 01:35:53,692
Of course not.

1010
01:35:53,834 --> 01:35:56,667
If Mars had an atmosphere, he'd lose control.

1011
01:35:57,938 --> 01:35:59,371
See down there?

1012
01:36:00,607 --> 01:36:02,871
It's a glacier.

1013
01:36:03,043 --> 01:36:05,944
The whole core of Mars is ice.

1014
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:08,579
The reactor melts it...

1015
01:36:08,649 --> 01:36:10,378
and it releases the oxygen.

1016
01:36:10,684 --> 01:36:11,912
Come on.

1017
01:36:11,952 --> 01:36:14,785
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.

1018
01:36:15,122 --> 01:36:17,920
Enough for the whole planet.

1019
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:20,355
If we turn it on on time.

1020
01:36:26,967 --> 01:36:28,798
Come on. Come on!

1021
01:36:46,119 --> 01:36:47,143
Hold on.

1022
01:37:18,585 --> 01:37:19,381
Now!

1023
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:51,142
Son of a bitch.

1024
01:37:59,026 --> 01:37:59,583
Go!

1025
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:05,589
He's got a hologram!

1026
01:38:27,521 --> 01:38:29,989
You think this is
the real Quaid? It is.

1027
01:39:49,870 --> 01:39:51,929
Now, you're coming with me!

1028
01:40:05,785 --> 01:40:07,912
See you at the party, Richter.

1029
01:40:46,259 --> 01:40:47,385
Don't touch that!

1030
01:40:47,694 --> 01:40:49,355
Get away! Get back!

1031
01:40:49,729 --> 01:40:51,026
What are you afraid of?

1032
01:40:51,131 --> 01:40:53,395
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!

1033
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:56,760
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

1034
01:40:56,903 --> 01:40:59,064
Mars will go into
global meltdown.

1035
01:40:59,239 --> 01:41:01,833
That's why the aliens
never turned it on.

1036
01:41:02,042 --> 01:41:03,942
And you expect me
to believe you?

1037
01:41:04,211 --> 01:41:08,705
Who gives a shit what you believe?
In 30 seconds you'll be dead.

1038
01:41:08,882 --> 01:41:12,147
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for corn flakes.

1039
01:41:15,121 --> 01:41:16,884
I didn't want it to end this way.

1040
01:41:16,957 --> 01:41:18,822
I wanted Hauser back. But no.

1041
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,521
You had to be Quaid!

1042
01:41:22,629 --> 01:41:25,063
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!

1043
01:41:25,232 --> 01:41:28,258
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.

1044
01:41:28,401 --> 01:41:32,269
Well, all dreams come to an end.

1045
01:42:47,347 --> 01:42:49,577
Melina, hold on!

1046
01:42:49,683 --> 01:42:51,275
Don't do it!

1047
01:42:51,451 --> 01:42:53,282
We'll all die!

1048
01:42:54,321 --> 01:42:56,585
Everybody will die!

1049
01:43:59,819 --> 01:44:01,309
Quaid!

1050
01:49:16,669 --> 01:49:18,864
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.

1051
01:49:20,506 --> 01:49:21,939
What's wrong?

1052
01:49:22,141 --> 01:49:25,804
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?

1053
01:49:27,547 --> 01:49:30,448
Well, then kiss me quick
before you wake up.
