朕要走路
The emperor will walk.

145
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,120
朕没遇到过其他小孩
I have never met other children.

146
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,790
- 他们都跟你一样吗？ - 臣弟有三个姐妹和两个朋友
- Are they all like you? - I've got three sisters and two friends.

147
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,300
如果你来我们家 可以和我们一起玩
If you come to our house, you can play with us.

148
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,550
皇帝从不离开皇宫
The emperor never leaves the palace.

149
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,930
我们一起玩游戏！
We play games together!

150
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,930
朕也知道一个游戏！
I know a game too.

151
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,010
跑！
Run!

152
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,820
船上的都是先王妃
The ones on the boat are the high consorts.

153
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,910
先王妃？ 先皇的妃子
- High consorts? - The wives ofthe emperor before me.

154
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,950
他们说是我的阿妈 但她们不是！她们不是！
They say they're my mother, but they're not. They're not!

155
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,740
为什么你穿那呀？ 你是不能穿黄色的！
Why are you wearing that? You are not allowed to wear yellow.

156
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,500
但这是普通黄色
But this is ordinary yellow.

157
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,250
那是御黄色！
It is imperial yellow.

158
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,000
不 不是！
No, it is not.

159
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,670
我们说它是！只有皇帝可用御黄色！
We say it is. Only the emperor can wear that yellow.

160
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,670
脱了它！ 不！
- Take it off. - No!

161
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,050
脱了它！不！并且你也不再是皇帝了！
- Take it off! - No! And you're not the emperor anymore.

162
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,010
现在有一个新皇帝！
There is a new emperor now

163
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,270
他剪了辨子 不光有骆驼  他还有车！
He has cut off his queue. And instead ofa camel, he has got a car.

164
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,230
你说什么？
What did you say?

165
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,310
你不是皇帝！
You're not the emperor.

166
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,030
撒谎！
Liar!

167
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,320
你再也不是皇帝了！ 撒谎！
- You're not the emperor anymore! - Liar!

168
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,700
撒谎！你不是…

169
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,790
撒谎！
Liar!

170
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,880
你不是皇帝！
You're not the emperor.

171
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
撒谎！ 你不是皇帝！
- Liar! - You're not the emperor!

172
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,050
好大胆你！

173
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,340
你不是皇帝！
- You're not the emperor!

174
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,850
别！
Please. No!

175
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:38,600
皇上！冷静！
Your Majesty. Calm yourself.

176
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,810
你不是皇帝！ 好大胆你！
- You're not the emperor! - How dare you!

177
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,520
皇上！冷静！
oh, Your Majesty. Calm yourself.

178
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,070
我是皇帝不是？
Am I the emperor or not?

179
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,610
皇上永远是皇帝
Your Majesty will always be the emperor.

180
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,660
听到了？ 证明给我看!
- You see? - Prove it.

181
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,160
大脚
Big Foot.

182
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,670
喝了它！
Drink it.

183
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,500
快 喝了墨水
Go on. Drink the green ink.

184
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,150
我让你看看！
I will show you!

185
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,520
看见了？那是他的车！ 他是民国的总统
See? That is a car. He's the president of the Republic.

186
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,580
为什么在这儿垒墙 大臣？
Why is this wall here, Lord Chamberlain?

187
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,250
只是一堵墙 皇上 什么都没变
It is just a wall, Your Majesty. Nothing has changed.

188
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,340
你在说谎
You are lying.

189
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,690
太傅 我还是皇帝吗？
High Tutor, am I still the emperor?

190
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:36,230
在紫禁城内您永远是皇帝
You will always be the emperor inside the Forbidden City...

191
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,900
但在外面不是
but not outside.

192
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,990
我不明白
I do not understand.

193
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,160
外面是个民国
Outside China is now a republic...

194
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
还有个总统
with a president.

195
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,580
嬷嬷在哪儿？
Where is Ar Mo?

196
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,170
嬷嬷？
Ar Mo.

197
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,070
你们都是骗子！
You are all liars!

198
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,620
让我跟他道别！ 快！快！
- Let me say good-bye! - Hurry. Hurry.

199
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,630
他是我的孩子！
He's my child!

200
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,770
阿嬷？
Ar Mo?

201
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,910
我不明白
I do not understand.

202
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,710
皇上现在是个大孩子了 不该再有奶妈了
Your Majesty is a big boy now. He cannot have a wet nurse anymore

203
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,790
这样好多了
It is much better like this.

204
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,010
健康多了
Much healthier.

205
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,720
但她不是我的奶妈
But she is not my wet nurse.

206
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,390
她是我的蝴蝶
She is my buttefrly.

207
00:36:38,690 --> 00:37:12,810
阿嬷！
Ar Mo!

208
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,150
这是感化中心
This is the detention center...

209
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,860
位于公共安全抚顺局
of the Fushun Bureau of Public Security.

210
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:07,610
我是这里的主管！
And I am the governor.

211
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,530
战争期间  这里是日本的监狱
During the war, this was aJapanese prison

212
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,830
你们大部分可能还记得
Many ofyou may remember it..

213
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,960
因为你们为日本人工作
because you worked with the Japanese

214
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,460
你们要为它的建成负责
You were responsible for building it..

215
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,290
你们还关满了无辜的人
and you filled it with innocent people

216
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,170
怎么会这样呢？
How could this happen?

217
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,550
为什么你们背叛自己的国家？！
Why did you betray your country?

218
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,180
为什么你们会变成战犯呢？
What turned you into war criminals?

219
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,140
我们相信人生来本性是好的
We believe that men are born good.

220
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:39,060
我们相信改变的唯一方法就是 找出真相 直接面对它
We believe that the only way to change is to discover the truth and look at it in the face.

221
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,940
这就是你们在这里的原因
That is why you are here

222
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,780
你们先要交待清楚生平情况
You will begin by writing the story of your lives...

223
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,150
并坦承罪行
and by confessing your crimes

224
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:55,160
能否赎罪取决于你们所抱的态度
Your salvation will lie entirely in the attitude you take.

225
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,660
我提议你们要坦诚真挚
I advise you to be frank and sincere

226
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:04,710
不然，你们不会好过
otherwise, things can still go very badly for you.

227
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,700
几年后…
After a few years...

228
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,240
民国和清末同样腐败
the Chinese Republic had become as corrupt as the old empire.

229
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:42,290
很快便由军阀及官僚把持
It fell quickly into the hands of ambitious generals and corrupt bureaucrats.

230
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,670
军阀割据时代开始
The era of the warlords had begun

231
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,720
l9l9年5月我获任命时 中国正动荡不安
By May 1919, when I received my appointment, China was in turmoil

232
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,760
皇上，师傅勤见
May the new tutor present himself.

233
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,200
皇上 新师傅来了
Your Imperial Highness, the new tutor.

234
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,370
雷金纳德・费兰芒・庄士敦先生
Mr. Reginald Fleming Johnston

235
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,790
你好 庄士敦先生
How do you do, Mr.Johnston?

236
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:30,500
你好 皇上
How do you do, Your Majesty?

237
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,300
我们上课吧
Now we will go to school.

238
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,890
皇上 在我的国家  一般要
Your Majesty, in my country, it would be usual to begin...

239
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,350
先考试一下
with some kind ofan examination.

240
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,860
皇帝不能被考
The emperor cannot be examined.

241
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,070
好吧 那只好改一下
Well, that may have to change.

242
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,490
可是 皇上或许想问我一些问题
But first Your Majesty might like to ask me some questions.

243
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,080
你的祖先在哪儿？
Where are your ancestors buried?

244
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,160
苏格兰 皇上
In Scotland, Your Majesty.

245
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,290
那么 你不穿裙子？
But then, where's your skirt?

246
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,300
在你们国家 男人穿短裙子 不是吗？
In your country, men wear short skirts, do they not?

247
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:21,550
不是 皇上 苏格兰人不穿裙子 他们穿方格呢短裙
No, Your Majesty. Scotsmen do not wear skirts. They wear kilts.

248
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,350
方格呢短裙？ 方格呢短裙
- Kilts? - Kilts.

249
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:28,310
或许只是一个措词的问题  但是措词非常重要
A matter of words, perhaps, but words are important.

250
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,560
为什么措词重要？
Why are words important?

251
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,730
如果你不能说出你的本意 皇上 那你就不会说话算数了
If you cannot say what you mean, Your Majesty, you will never mean what you say...

252
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,820
一个绅士应该永远说话算数
and a gentleman should always mean what he says.

253
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,620
是的！“绅士” 
Ah, yes. A gentleman.

254
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,700
你是绅士吗？
Are you a gentleman?

255
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,410
我非常想做绅士 皇上
I would like to be a gentleman, Your Majesty.

256
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,790
- 我努力去做 - 朕不是绅士
- I try to be. - I am not a gentleman.

257
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,000
朕被禁止说心里话
I'm not allowed to say what I mean.

258
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,550
他们常告诉朕该说些什么
They are always telling me what to say.

259
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,220
皇上尚年轻
Your Majesty is still very young.

260
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:10,390
皇上也许想看看英、美杂志
I thought he might like to see some English and American magazines.

261
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,060
是我刚收到的
I have just received them.

262
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,900
我知道你所知道的
I know that you know that I know..

263
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,660
我知道的你所知的
that you know that that is a dialogue...

264
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,330
那是孔子和庄子之间的对话
between Confucius and Chuang-Tsu.

265
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,160
注意尊严 皇上
Concerning respect, Your Majesty.

266
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,680

270
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,110
不太一样
Not quite.

271
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:03,900
他有车吗？
Does he have a car?

272
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,950
他去世很久了 皇上
He lived a long time ago, Your Majesty.

273
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
我想要辆车
I want a car.

274
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,090
我认为你的老鼠想逃掉 皇上
I think your mouse is trying to escape Your Majesty.

275
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,630
别把老鼠这秘密告诉别人
Please do not tell anyone about my mouse.

276
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,810
下课了
The lesson is finished.

277
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,180
尝膳的太监是个勇敢的人
The official taster's a brave man

278
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,190
先帝有不少是被毒害的
Many of my ancestors have been poisoned, you know.

279
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,360
皇上每天如此进午膳的吗?
Does Your Majesty have lunch like this every day?

280
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,900
对 每天如是 像做马戏似的
Ah, yes. Every day. Like theater.

281
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,860
朕不知何原因，一向如是
I do not know why. It has always been like that

282
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,540
在西方是如何杀害帝王的?
How do they kill emperors in the West?

283
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,590
奥国皇帝给枪杀，是吗?
The Austrian emperor was shot was he not?

284
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:46,800
不是 不过他的侄儿大战前给暗杀
No. But his nephew was assassinated before the Great War.

285
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,130
但俄国沙皇就给枪杀了
But the Russian emperor has been shot. He was called a czar.

286
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,840
是的
Yes.

287
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,810
他侵占满州不少地方
He took lots ofour land in Manchuria.

288
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,940
朕是满州人 甚至民国以后，满州仍是朕的国土
I'm a Manchurian. Even after the Republic, it's still my country.

289
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,610
那…秘密 皇上 又出来了
The... secret, Your Majesty, is emerging again.

290
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,420
有什么事吗 皇上？
Is something the matter, Your Majesty?

291
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,090
有事发生
-  Something is happening 

292
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,010
发生了什么事 庄士敦先生？
What is happening, Mr.Johnston?

293
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,180
- 没… - 住嘴!
- Nothing is... - Quiet.

294
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:27,190
前来皇宫时 我们遭一群大学生所阻
on ourway here, Your Majesty, we were held up by students from the university.

295
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,650
他们抗议民国政府
They were protesting against the Republican government...

296
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:34,780
把国土割让给日本
because it has agreed to give away Chinese territory to Japan.

297
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,240
庄士顿先生…
Is it true, Mr.Johnston...

298
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:42,080
外面有许多人给砍头 这是真的么？
that many people out there have had their heads chopped off?

299
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,960
是真的，皇上
It is true, Your Majesty.

300
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,710
有许多人被砍头了
Many heads have been chopped off.

301
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,090
使他们不再思考
It does stop them thinking.

302
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,090
皇上该寝息了
It's time for the emperor's rest.

303
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,090
学生愤怒是对的
The students are right to be angry.

304
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,350
朕也愤怒!
I'm angry.

305
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,150
但朕不获准离开紫禁城
But I'm not allowed to leave the Forbidden City.

306
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,400
朕想到外面去
I want to go out, Mr.Johnston.

307
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,160
陛下!
My lord.

308
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,740
朕想看看繁闹城市!
I want to see the city of sounds.

309
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,880
皇上赐你头品顶戴
The emperor awards you with the order of the Ruby Hat Button..

310
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,590
赏坐四人肩舆
and with the right to be carried in your own chair with four bearers.

311
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,970
此人走中道而我走侧道？
Ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road?

312
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,000
我希望皇上没有忘记
I hope the emperor has not forgotten...

313
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,170
今天的数学课
that this is the day for his maths class.

314
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,760
给皇上的！
For Your Majesty.

315
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,800
太医说脚踏车不好
My doctor said bicycles are bad for you.

316
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,140
对你有害？ 胡说！
Bad for you? Nonsense!

317
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,570
怎么骑？
How does it work?

318
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,610
噢
oh.

319
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,360
很简单
It's simple.

320
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:04,870
抬起头眼朝前看！
Head up and eyes forward.

321
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,200
就象数学！
As in math.

322
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,730
皇母死了 是吗? 是的 皇上
- My mother's dead, is she not? - Yes, Your Majesty.

323
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,860
微臣替皇上难过
I'm profoundly sorry.

324
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,940
朕不难过
I am not.

325
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:48,200
她是自杀的 吞下鸦片球
She killed herself. She swallowed a ball of opium.

326
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,160
朕去见她及皇弟
I'm going to see her and my brother.

327
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,470
开门!
Open the door.

328
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,840
开门!
open the door!

329
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,690
开门!
Open the door.

330
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,870
麻烦来了！
Trouble maker!

331
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:37,870
魔头！管闲事的！
Devil! Meddler!

332
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,500
麻烦 除了麻烦就是麻烦
Trouble. Nothing but trouble

333
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:45,290
看你把我弄成何样子 你是个残忍无知的老头子
- Look where you lead him. - And you are an old, cruel, ignorant man!

334
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,380
这孩子的母亲死了
The boy's mother is dead...

335
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,380
竟不让他去看看！
and he's not even allowed to see her!

336
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,380
朕要出去!
I want to go out!

337
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:53,010
朕要出去!
I want to go out!

338
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,850
别动！ 呆在那里别动！
Stop that! Stay where you are!

339
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:57,720
- 朕要出去! - 别动！
- I want to go out! - Stop it!

340
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,600
- 朕要出去! - 别动！呆在那里别动！笨蛋！
- I want to go out! - Stay where you are! You fool!

341
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,100
别动！
Stay there!

342
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,770
上！
Chang.

343
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,860
驼背 大脚！
Hunchback. Big Foot.

344
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,850
先生
Sir.

345
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:47,820
把手伸给我 先生
Give me your hand, sir.

346
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,160
你看不到吗？
Can you not see?

347
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:14,630
请看我的左耳 先生
Look at my left ear, please, sir.

348
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,600
谢谢 再看右耳
Thank you. And now my right.

349
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,970
谢谢
Thank you

350
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,020
请看着我的手指 先生
Would you follow my finger, please, sir?

351
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,400
嗯嗯
Mm-hmm.

352
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,240
非常简单 庄士敦 皇上需要眼镜
Well, it's perfectly simple, Johnston. The emperor needs spectacles.

353
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,570
像莱特一样
Like Harold Lloyd.

354
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,870
不可能
Impossible.

355
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,830
皇上怎能戴眼镜
An emperor does not wear spectacles.

356
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:44,830
这是不允许的!
That cannot be allowed

357
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:48,130
时代不同了 殿下！
Times have changed, Your Highnesses.

358
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:06,890
如果皇上不戴眼镜 庄士敦  他会失明的
If His Majesty doesn't get spectacles, Johnston, he could lose his sight.

359
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,110
皇上
Your Majesty.

360
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:35,760
如果皇上不戴眼镜  我就辞职
If the emperor does not get spectacles, I will resign.

361
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,010
很不幸 决定不能改
Unfortunately, our decision is final.

362
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:44,680
很不幸 我要说的将发表在中国的所有报纸上
And unfortunately, what I have to say will be published in every newspaper in China.

363
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,690
您要说什么 庄士敦先生？
What do you have to say, Mr.Johnston?

364
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,780
皇上在宫中有如囚犯 自登基直至逊位
The emperor has been a prisoner in his own palace since the day that he was crowned...

365
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,110
皇上仍是个囚犯
and has remained a prisoner since he abdicated.

366
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,370
皇上长大了会猜想何故
But now he's growing up, he may wonderwhy...

367
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:05,950
自己是唯一不准出门的人
he is the only person in China who may not walk out of his own front door.

368
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,540
我想皇上是世上最寂寞的孩子
I think the emperor is the loneliest boy on earth.

369
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,380
同样悲惨是…
It would be conveniently sad..

370
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,760
皇上失去视力
if he becomes blind

371
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,090
失去视力…庄士敦先生?
Blind, Mr.Johnston?

372
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:24,850
其代价 阁下
To the expense, Your Excellency.

373
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:28,600
要养活一千二百名太监
To the cost of maintaining 1,200 eunuchs...

374
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:34,060
三百五十名妃嫔以及一百八十五名御厨
350 ladies-in-waiting and 1 85 cooks.

375
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:39,740
每月买过百貂皮裘 每星期买三干只鸡
To buying 120 sable furs a month and 3,000 chickens a week.

376
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:44,910
八百四十名待卫及内务府官员
To the fact that 840 guards and employees of the household department...

377
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:49,120
及一名主管  他们只关心一件事……
plus one lord chamberlain care only about one thing:

378
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,540
中饱私囊
filling their own rice bowls.

379
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,250
你对数字很有一手 庄士顿先生
You are very good at accounts, Mr.Johnston.

380
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,300
皇上也许逊了位
The emperor may have abdicated...

381
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:03,340
但他对许多人来说仍然是一个重要的象征
but he's still a symbol of great importance to many people.

382
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:08,520
我亦因有此想法才留下来
If I did not agree with that, I would not be here.

383
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:12,020
我们当中有人相信有一天
And some of us believe...

384
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,060
皇上不单会是个象征
that one day soon he may be more than a symbol.

385
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:19,570
眼镜是细节而矣
The spectacles are a detail.

386
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:23,490
你其实想怎样? 庄士顿先生
What do you really want, Mr.Johnston?

387
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,570
只要眼镜
Just the spectacles.

388
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,040
哦
oh.

389
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,710
婉容 皇上
The princess WanJung Your Majesty.

390
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,420
十七岁
Seventeen years old.

391
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,430
惠珍 十五岁
Princess WhoJen. Fifteen years old.

392
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,600
莉莲 皇上
The princess Li Li, Your Majesty.

393
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:40,270
还有风英
And the Princess Fun Ying.

394
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,540
她是谁?
who is this?

395
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,920
文秀 十二岁
Princess Wen Hsiu. Twelve years old.

396
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,130
她的脸孔很有趣
She has got a funny face.

397
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:16,350
不能选一妻子 要一名皇后 一名妃子
Not just one wife. One empress and one secondary consort.

398
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,730
两个妻子？ 但你选谁当皇后？
- Two wives? - But who did you choose to be the empress?

399
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:23,860
他们选她！ 她太大 庄士敦！她17了！
They chose her. She's very old,Johnston. She's 17.

400
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,650
那并不大 皇上
That's not so old, Your Majesty.

401
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:29,700
- 她长得怎样？ - 过时了！
- What does she look like? - Old-fashioned.

402
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,830
我想要个时髦的妻子 庄士敦
I want a modern wife, Johnston...

403
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:34,660
会说英语 法语
who speaks English and French.

404
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,500
还会跳快步
And who can dance the quickstep.

405
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,800
庄士敦
Johnston

406
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,930
先生
Sir.

407
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,100
我想逃走 庄士敦
I'm going to escape, Johnston.

408
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:01,270
我搞到个箱子和一张去英国的票
I've got a suitcase and a ticket to England.

409
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,730
我要去牛津大学
I am going to Oxford University.

410
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:10,860
皇上 若你结婚了 你就会成为自己房子里的主人
Your Majesty, if you get married, you will become the master of your own house.

411
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:14,700
结婚或许是比较实际的逃避方法
A wedding might be a more practical way to escape.

412
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:53,160
你为什么从不结婚  庄士敦？
Why did you never get married, Johnston?

413
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,240
噢
oh.

414
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:06,710
贵妃欢迎皇后
The secondary consort welcomes the empress.

415
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,170
皇后问候贵妃
The empress greets the secondary consort.

416
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,400
你每件事都做得很好
You do everything very well.

417
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,980
谢谢 我练习了很多次
Thank you. I rehearsed many times.

418
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:27,750
皇上在想什么？
What is His Majesty thinking?

419
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,880
我在想 如果我是真皇帝  我现在就会是中国的统治者
I was thinking if I was a real emperor I would become the ruler of China now.

420
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:37,680
如果真是这样的话 皇上会做什么呢？
And what would the emperor do if he could really rule?

421
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,970
我会改变所有的事情 甚至我们结婚的方式
I would change everything, even the way we get married.

422
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,140
皇上反对指定的婚姻吗？
Is the emperor against arranged marriages?

423
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:48,150
耻辱的是不能选择自己的婚姻！
It is humiliating not to choose whom you marry.

424
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,610
就是我 也不能选择
Even I was not allowed to choose.

425
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,580
再过一两年皇上就会比我高了
In another year or two, His Majesty will be taller than me.

426
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,170
皇上在床下有个箱子
Is it true the emperor has a suitcase under his bed...

427
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,260
还想去英国吗？
and is going to oxford?

428
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,890
皇上会带婉容去吗？
Will the emperor take wan Jung with him?

429
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:25,310
也许他想先看看我的脸再做决定
Perhaps he would like to see my face before he decides.

430
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:31,310
是的 皇上是想看看皇后的脸
Yes. The emperorwould like to see the face ofthe empress.

431
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,660
应该皇上掀开盖头
It is the emperorwho must remove the kai t'ou.

432
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,970
我也有个象庄士敦先生的导师
I also had a tutor, like Mr.Johnston.

433
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,270
温沙小姐
Miss Windsor.

434
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,480
她是美国人
She's American.

435
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:24,590
温沙小姐教给我 怎样跳快步舞
Miss Windsor taught me how to do the dance ofthe quickstep.

436
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,140
皇上知道怎样跳快步舞吗？
Does the emperor know how to do the quickstep?

437
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,560
你会教我吗？
Will you teach me?

438
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,490
走开！走开！
Leave us. Leave us.

439
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,470
如果皇上认为
If Your Majesty thinks...

440
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,850
和一个陌生人做云雨之事过时的话
it is old-fashioned to make the rain and the wind with a stranger...

441
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:57,400
我们可以先做一对现代的夫妇
we can be like a modern couple to begin with.

442
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,310
现代夫妇？
A modern couple?

443
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:05,240
晚安 晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

444
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:15,620
你必须和我去牛津大学
You must come to Oxford with me.

445
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:24,670
我喜欢他！
I like him.

446
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:29,050
我肯定我会喜欢他！
I am sure I am going to like him.

447
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:31,220
他会长大！
And he will grow up.

448
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,560
朝下看！
Eyes down!

449
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,070
先报告！
Report your arrival.

450
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,780
- 981号犯人报告 - 大声点！
- Prisoner 981 reporting. - Louder!

451
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:50,820
981号犯人报告
Prisoner 981 reporting.

452
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:53,120
开门！
open the door.

453
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,750
关门！
Close the door.

454
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:04,800
坐下！
Sit down

455
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:12,010
姓名！
Name.

456
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,060
爱新觉罗・溥仪
Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi.

457
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,140
写下来！
Write it.

458
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:37,750
听着
Now then.

459
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:40,040
有两种坦白的方式
There are two types of confession.

460
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,500
我们称为“牙膏”和“水笼头”
We call them toothpaste and water tap.

461
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:49,800
“牙膏”犯需要常常去挤
The toothpaste prisoner needs to be squeezed every now and then..

462
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,390
否则他会忘记继续坦白
or else he forgets to keep confessing.

463
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:58,600
“水笼头”犯只需在他开始之前好好地拧一次
The water tap man needs one good, hard twist before he starts...

464
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,350
接着什么都出来了
but then everything comes out.

465
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,770
你是个聪明人
Now, you're an intelligent person

466
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,980
我相信你明白我的话
I'm sure you understand me.

467
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,950
好的
Good.

468
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:12,990
那我们开始
Then we'll begin.

469
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:16,580
你知道为什么你在这里吗 981？
Why do you think you're in here, 981?

470
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:22,580
我被指控叛国、通敌和反革命
I am accused of being a traitor, a collaborator and a counter-revolutionary.

471
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:25,420
那不是指控！ 你是一个叛国者
It is not an accusation! You are a traitor...

472
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,090
你是一个通敌犯 并且你是一个反革命！
you are a collaborator, and you are a counter-revolutionary!

473
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:38,560
你把这写下来了？
Did you write this?

474
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,560
你称这是坦白？
And you call it a confession?

475
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,600
这只是个时间表！一个童话！
This is nothing but a list of dates. A child's fairy tale.

476
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,830
- 你们要我坦白什么？ -  你知道你做了什么
- What do you want me to confess? - You know what you did...

477
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:00,830
别人做了什么
and what others did.

478
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:03,120
为什么你不志愿提供消息呢？
So why don't you volunteer the information?

479
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,870
我不明白
I do not understand.

480
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,880
我们不告诉犯人坦白什么
We don't tell people what to confess.

481
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,920
我们已经知道你全部的事情
We already know everything about you.

482
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:20,970
我…
I...

483
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,060
- 继续 - 我要改过自新
- Go on. - I wanted reforms.

484
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:28,900
你要改什么过？
What did you want to reform?

485
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,690
所有的事
Everything.

486
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,820
剪掉辨子
Cut off my queue.

487
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,410
皇上！不要！
Your Majesty. Please.

488
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:17,490
- 它很重！- 以前的皇帝被谋杀
- It is heavy. - The emperor before me was murdered..

489
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:20,620
是因为他们要改革帝国
because he wanted to reform the empire.

490
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,620
是这样吗 庄士敦先生？
Is that not so, Mr.Johnston?

491
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,710
是的 皇上 可能是
Yes, Your Majesty. Probably.

492
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:31,750
我们看看他们是否杀朕 朕要改革紫禁城
Well, let us see if they will kill me for reforming the Forbidden City.

493
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,260
总管
Lord Chamberlain

494
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:39,260
朕在任命庄士敦先生的朋友 诗人和学者 陈小苏
I am appointing Mr.Johnston's friend, the poet and scholar Chen Hsiao Hsiu...

495
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,800
来当新的内务总管
to be the new lord chamberlain.

496
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:46,180
朕要他监督列个详细的库藏清单！
I want him to supervise a detailed inventory of the imperial storerooms...

497
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:50,730
这样才会知道到底被偷了多少！
so that we can learn exactly how much has been stolen.

498
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:05,700
紫禁城就象一个没有观众的剧院
The Forbidden City had become a theater without an audience

499
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:09,290
为什么演员还要留在舞台上呢？
So why did the actors remain on the stage?

500
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:14,420
仅仅是逐渐偷走布景
It was only to steal the scenery piece by piece.

501
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,440
我能睡这里吗？ 我很害怕
Can I sleep here? I am frightened.

502
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:51,540
你很勇敢
You're brave.

503
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,630
你不害怕吗？
Are you not frightened?

504
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,170
我很激动 我不想再逃避了
I am excited. I do not want to escape anymore.

505
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,970
我要掌权
I want to rule.

506
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,600
吻我
Kiss me.

507
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:40,170
我也可以利你呆一起吗？
Can I stay with you as well?

508
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,840
进来 进来
Get in. Get in.

509
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,080
我常和太监玩一个游戏
I used to play a game with the eunuchs.

510
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:14,830
猜谁是谁
Trying to guess who is who.

511
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:18,590
我现在看不见你
Now I cannot see you.

512
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,140
嗨
Ah.

513
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:29,140
- 婉容？
- WanJung? 

514
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:31,220
- 文绣？
- wen Hsiu? 

515
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:35,730
和我们到床单下
Come underneath the sheet with us

516
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:24,840
皇上！库房着火了 皇上！
Your Majesty. The storerooms are on fire, Your Majesty.

517
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:42,560
这是个巨大的损失
The fire was a terrible disaster..

518
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:47,530
并且朕知道是太监们干的 就是要阻止朕查清谁偷了东西
and I knew the eunuchs had started it to stop me from knowing what they had stolen.

519
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:52,200
紫禁城里面有太监的历史已经800年了
There had been eunuchs in the Forbidden City for 800 years

520
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,660
现在这里仍然有超过1000个太监
There were still more than a thousand of them.

521
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:57,120
朕决定把他们全部驱逐出去
I decided to expel them all

522
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,120
朕不得不寻求民国军队的帮助
I had to ask for Republican troops to help me.

523
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,650
- 他们能带些什么呢？ - 他们的器官（小JJ）
- What are they carrying? - Their organs.

524
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,240
尽管他们有犯错…
whatever their crimes..

525
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:15,610
但不能剥夺他们作为一个完整男人埋葬入土的权利
they cannot be deprived of the right to be buried as whole men.

526
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,510
嗯？
Well?

527
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,340
额…
Uh...

528
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:21,430
- 忘掉我刚才说的吧 - 你在浪费时间
- I have forgot what I was saying. - You are wasting our time!

529
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:24,390
我们想知道关于日本的事
We want to know about the Japanese.

530
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,480
你和日本人的关系是怎么开始的？
How did your friendship with the Japanese begin?

531
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,020
谁介绍的？！什么时候？！
Who introduced you? When?

532
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:35,490
我想是在…
I think it was...

533
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:37,530
是1924年
it was 1 924.

534
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:42,030
议会再次被解散  总统也跑了
Parliament had been dissolved again. The president had fled.

535
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,620
起初我以为这只是另一个军阀的
At first, I thought it was just another coup d'etat...

536
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:49,080
另一次政变
by just another warlord.

537
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:53,130
而这一次确实不一样
Only this time it was different.

538
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:56,720
这次轮到我了
This time it was my turn.

539
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,050
15比0
Fifteen-love

540
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,330
继续
Play.

541
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,920
30比15
30-15.

542
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:07,700
腐败的民国政府已经跨台了！
The rotten government of the Republic is in flight.

543
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:10,960
现在我们要清除东北老鼠的异国臭味…
Now we shall remove the foreign stench of the Manchurian rats...

544
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,330
他们仍藏在紫禁城中
who still hide in the Forbidden City.

545
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:27,680
“限溥仪及其家人一小时内…
"Mr. Pu Yi and his family have been given one hour...

546
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:30,270
离开紫禁城
to leave the Forbidden City.

547
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,440
他们将被送到他父亲家
"They will be escorted to the home of his father...

548
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,990
并且作为犯人拘押在那里
"and remain there under guard as state prisoners...

549
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:42,490
等候通知！
until further notice."

550
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,330
你们看什么？
What are you all looking at?

551
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:52,410
站那里发什么呆？
What are you standing there for?

552
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,750
你们总得离开紫禁城
You always wanted to leave the Forbidden City.

553
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:57,840
你们只有一小时时间收拾 所以快去！
Now you've got an hour to pack. So go!

554
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:00,840
快啊！
Go!

555
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:16,060
我总以为我恨这里
I always thought I hated it here.

556
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:19,570
现在我害怕离开
Now I'm afraid to leave

557
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:22,820
- 你认为他们会杀我吗？ - 按他们说的做 皇上
- Do you think they will kill me? - You must do as they say, Your Majesty...

558
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,530
我将去英国大使馆
while I try to reach the British Embassy

559
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,950
他们会给你庇护权
They will give you asylum there

560
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,660
我肯定他们会的
I'm sure they will.

561
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:36,210
张 把我的车开到南门！ 我要送皇上
Chang, take my car to the south gate. I want you to drive His Majesty.

562
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:38,980
皇上！
Your Majesty!

563
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:28,780
- 请 皇上！ - 什么？
- Please, Your Majesty. - What?

564
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:19,870
但你没有去英国使馆 是不是？
But you didn't go to the British Embassy, did you?

565
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,040
你反而去了日本使馆
You ended up at the Japanese Embassy.

566
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,040
日本人是唯一准备帮助我的人
The Japanese were the only people prepared to help me.

567
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:27,130
他们白帮你？
Help you for nothing?

568
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:32,760
日本有个皇帝 我们年龄差不多
Japan has an emperor. We are almost the same age.

569
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,970
我想是出于善意
I thought it was kindness.

570
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:40,520
同时我意识到很多中国人 认为我是异族人
At the same time I realized that, for many Chinese, I was an alien...

571
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,850
只是因为我是满洲人
simply because I am Manchurian.

572
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:49,150
甚至有个反满同盟要暗杀我！
There was even an anti-Manchurian league who wanted to assassinate me.

573
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,240
所以 我想住在天津
So I went to live in Tientsin.

574
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:58,830
那是有个大港口的好地方
It was a nice, provincial town with a big port.

575
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:02,580
那些日子  我们做了重大的决定
In those days they had a large international settlement

576
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,460
日本人认为我在那里会安全些
The Japanese thought it would be safer for me there

577
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,300
在天津日本人替你付钱吗？
were the Japanese paying for you in Tientsin?

578
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:10,300
噢 不是
oh, no.

579
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,720
我只好租一栋公馆 张公馆  
I had to rent a villa - the Villa Chang.

580
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,010
非常昂贵
And it was very expensive.

581
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,260
保镖也是
So were the bodyguards.

582
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,770
我在天津花了很多钱
I spent a lot of money in Tientsin

583
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:25,940
你那时还想恢复大清帝国吗？
Did you still believe in a restoration of the imperial system?

584
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:29,190
其他人想 后来被抓并流放了
others did. The little court in exile

585
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:34,280
我记不清他们让我花费了多少 翡翠珠宝
I cannot remember how much jade and jewelry they made me spend...

586
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:39,330
来讨好一些军阀利一些俄国将军
to buy the friendship of some warlord or some White Russian general.

587
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:41,240
你的钱还花在哪儿了？
What else did you spend your money on?

588
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:46,040
我是不厌其烦地买钢琴  手表 收音机…
I was never tired of buying pianos, watches, radios.

589
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:48,420
只要是外国造的都买！
As long as they were foreign

590
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,420
当然
of course.

591
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:52,630
西方的任何东西都好
Anything western was good.

592
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,930
特别是WrigLey口香糖  Bayer阿斯匹林和汽车
Especially Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Bayer Aspirin, and cars.

593
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:59,350
你在天津时…
While you were in Tientsin...

594
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:03,230
中国大部分土地由蒋介石统治
most of China came under the control of General Chiang Kai-shek...

595
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:05,560
号称民族主义的
the so-called nationalists...

596
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,730
国民党
the Kuomintang.

597
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:10,980
- 你利他们是什么关系？- 没有
- What were your relations with them? - None.

598
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:16,360
我觉得留在天津毫无意义
I felt useless in Tientsin.

599
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:19,070
我都21岁了
I was 21 .

600
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,410
我梦想去西方
I dreamt of going to the west.

601
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,410
我变成了花花公子
I became a playboy.

602
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:28,670
我忧郁
# Am I blue #

603
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:31,750
我沮丧
# Am I blue #

604
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,970
我眼中的泪水会
# Ain't these tears in my eyes #

605
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:38,720
告诉你
# Telling you # 

606
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,140
我忧郁
# Am I blue #

607
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:44,140
你也会这样
# You'd be too #

608
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:47,310
如果你和女友
# If each plan with your girl #

609
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,190
分手了
# Done fell through #

610
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:53,480
曾经
# Was a time #

611
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:57,530
我是她的唯一
# I was her only one #

612
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:59,780
但是现在
# But now #

613
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:05,160
我又悲伤又孤独
# I'm the sad and lonely one #

614
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:14,710
现在她走了 我们也结束了
# Now she's gone and we're through #

615
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:19,470
上帝啊 我忧郁
# Lord, I'm blue 

616

想跳舞吗？
Would you like to dance?

621

你很勇敢  这里没人敢和我跳舞

622
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,840
为什么？
Why is that?

623
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,670
因为我是中国人
Because I'm Chinese.

624

我是美国人

01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:48,310
我甚至知道他的绰号 “给我换现金！”
I even know his nickname..."Cash My Check!"

694
01:39:52,190 --> 01:39:54,820
我是间谍…
I'm a spy...

695
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:57,110
我不怕别人知道
and I don't care who knows it.

696
01:39:57,190 --> 01:40:00,860
- 间谍？ - 我为日本特别行动部工作
- A spy? - I work for the Japanese Special Service Bureau.

697
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:03,450
我是来保护你的
And I've come to protect you.

698
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:07,000
日本人…
The Japanese...

01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:10,160
他们越来越接近他

他正想送他弟弟去东京的军事学院
He is sending his brother to the military academy in Tokyo.

701

702
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:22,970
甘糟先生不再和我打招呼
And Mr. Amakasu never says hello to me.

703
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:24,970
我不信任日本人
I do not trust the Japanese.

704
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:39,610
当然 我很想当皇帝的第二夫人！

705
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:43,320
- 东方明珠 - 如果那位子能够得到
- Eastern Jewel. - If the post is available.

706
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,840
那位子是空着 亲爱的表妹
The post is vacant, my dear cousin.

707
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:09,140
但你不适合那位子
But you do not fit the part.

708
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:14,810
文绣把狗拉下了 你想要吗？
Wen Hsiu left the dog behind. Do you want it?

709
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,230

710
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,570
都是我的错
It is all my fault.

我来看看您 皇上

给您带来了坏消息

我们满洲先皇的陵墓

715
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:13,580
被盗掘了

716
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:16,790
是国民党军队干的

717
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,250
是中国士兵

被劈成了碎片

721
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:37,150
她的珍珠项链成了蒋介石的一个结婚礼物

722
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:39,230
给他新妻子的

723
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,800
告诉我 981号 你想不想成为一个中国人？
Tell me, 981 , do you consider yourself to be Chinese?

724
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,800
当然想

725
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,800
- 这是什么？ - 日本
- What is this? -Japan.

726
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:10,680
- 你把中国的这个部分叫什么？ - 东北
- And what do you call this part ofChina? - The northeast.

727
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:14,020
- 你小时候把它叫什么？- 满洲
- And what did you call it as a child? - Manchuria.

728
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:18,140
日本在1931年9月18日入侵了满洲
Japan invaded Manchuria on September 18, 1931 ...

729
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:21,150
并开始建立一个叫满洲国的傀儡国家
and began to set up a puppet state called Manchukuo.

730
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:25,440
之后不久 一个日本代表团在天津对你进行了一次秘密拜访
Shortly afterwards, a Japanese delegation paid you a secret visit in Tientsin...

731
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:27,450
请求你的合作

732
01:43:27,530 --> 01:43:29,450
你拒绝了吗？
Would you say you refused?

733
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:32,030
- 大声说！ - 我已经告诉了你们

734
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:35,370
- 我对你们说了一百遍了 - 再说一遍！跟我们说200遍！
- I have told you a hundred times. - Tell us again. Tell us 200 times.

735
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:37,370
我拒绝合作
I refused to collaborate.

736
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:39,370
你说你拒绝了
You say you refused.

01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:44,750
但一个月后 在1931年11月10日 你到了满洲
But a month later, on November 10, 1931 , there you are arriving in Manchuria.

738
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:47,050
或许我应该称它为满洲国？
or should I call it Manchukuo?

739
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:50,550
根据你的这份所谓的供词
Now, according to this so-called confession of yours...

740
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,550
你并不是自愿走的
you didn't go of your own free will.

741
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,970
你坚持说 你是被日本人绑架去的！
You insist that you were kidnapped by theJapanese!

742
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:57,100
- 是的 - 是被强迫带到满洲的

- 是的！ - 坐下

744
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:06,940
你记不记得一个叫雷金纳德.弗莱明.庄士敦的人？
Do you remember a man called Reginald Fleming Johnston?

745
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:10,700
他是你的私人教师

746
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:12,700
是的
Yes.

747
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:15,280
还是好朋友 我想

748
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,870
在中国待了28年后

书名是《紫禁城的黄昏》
It is called Twilight in the Forbidden City...

753
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:36,930
它是献给你的
and it is dedicated to you.

754
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:54,530
再见！
Bye now!

755
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:56,530
- 再见！ - 再见了！

我会想念你的 庄士顿

758

我也会想念你 皇上

759
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:18,470
你认为一个人可以再次成为皇帝么？

763
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,050
我们怎能说“再见”？
How can we say good-bye?

764
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:52,760
就象我们说“您好”

765
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,400
再见 庄士敦先生

- Good-bye! - All aboard!

778
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:15,800
在第449页…
On page 449...

779
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,800
庄士敦先生写到
Mr.Johnston writes:

780
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:23,470
声称皇帝是被日本人绑架一事
"The endeavor to make out that the emperor had been kidnapped by the Japanese...

781
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:25,810
完全是不真实的
"is wholly untrue.

782
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:29,770
他离开天津去满洲…
"He left Tientsin and went to Manchuria...

783
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:31,770
是他完全自愿的
of his own free will."

784
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:34,690
- 庄士敦在说谎！- 你说什么？
-Johnston was a liar. - what did you say?

785
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:39,030
庄士敦先生在我被带去满洲前就已离开了
Mr.Johnston had left before I was taken to Manchuria.

786
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:41,490
他不知道都发生了什么事情
He could not have known what happened.

787
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,260
坐下
Sit down.

788
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:11,770
根据这份供词 你在11月9日的早晨把这个人的行李打点好的
According to this account, you prepared the man's things on the morning of November 9.

789
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:14,020
对一个被绑架的人来说
Isn't it unusual for a man who is kidnapped...

790
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:17,230
在他被绑架的前一天让仆人准备好行李 这正常吗？
to have his luggage packed by his valet the day before he is kidnapped?

791
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:21,070
这是你写的 是不是？ 是谁让你去准备这个人的行李的？
This is what you have written, isn't it? Who told you to pack this man's luggage?

792
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:27,290
这两个故事不相符 不是吗？
These two stories don't fit, do they?

793
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:32,000
时间太久了
It was a long time ago.

794
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,170
大概我弄错了
Perhaps I made a mistake.

795
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:37,130
你在说谎！你们都在说谎！
You are lying! You are both lying!

796
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:40,010
冷静点！
Control yourself!

797
01:48:46,350 --> 01:48:48,520
你仍然可以改变你的看法
You can still change your mind.

798
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:58,730
我是满洲人民的世袭统治者
I am the hereditary ruler of the Manchurian people.

799
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:05,030
没有我就没有满洲国
There can be no Manchukuo without me.

800
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:08,620
你没看出来？日本人在利用你
Do you not see? The Japanese are using you.

801
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:12,370
我必须试着利用他们
I must try to use them.

802
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:16,340
日本对满洲的侵略将被国际联盟所谴责
The Japanese invasion of Manchuria will be condemned by the League of Nations...

803
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:18,590
包括地球上所有的文明国家
and by every civilized country on Earth.

804
01:49:18,670 --> 01:49:22,170
民国违背了它对我许下的每一个诺言！
The Chinese Republic has broken every promise it ever made to me.

805
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:25,840
中国军队侮辱了我先祖的陵墓！
Chinese troops desecrated the tombs of my ancestors.

806
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:29,140
并且中国军队没有在日本进攻时保卫满洲！
And Chinese troops did not defend Manchuria from the Japanese.

807
01:49:29,220 --> 01:49:31,980
但满洲仍是中国！
But Manchuria is still China!

808
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:35,730
- 中国已经抛弃了我 - 请不要走
- China has turned its back on me. - Please, do not go.

809
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:39,150
满洲是最富饶的亚洲边疆！
Manchuria is the richest frontier in Asia.

810
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:41,860
煤 油 铁路！
Coal, oil, railways!

811
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:44,910
每年都有上百万的中国移民去那里！
Millions of Chinese immigrants are going there every year.

812
01:49:44,990 --> 01:49:46,910
我将建立我的国家
I'm going to build my country.

813
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:50,410
庄士敦错了 但他不是个说谎者
Johnston was wrong, but he wasn't a liar.

814
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,960
不存在绑架！
There was no kidnapping.

815
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:57,960
去满洲是你自己的选择 是因为你想再次成为皇帝！
You went to Manchuria by your own choice because you wanted to be emperor again!

816
01:50:14,060 --> 01:50:17,060
这些东西或许能帮助你回忆真相
These might help you to remember the truth.

817
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:57,870
对天
To heaven.

818
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:07,300
对地
To earth.

819
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:09,470
对月
To the moon

820
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:14,810
对日
To the sun.

821
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:33,490
你又是皇后了
You're an empress again.

822
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:37,490
我想做的是飞行员！
What I'm going to be is a pilot.

823
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:41,750
我将在横滨附近的一个秘密基地训练学习精确轰炸
I'm going to train at a secret base near Yokohama to learn precision bombing.

824
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,460
我想轰炸上海
I want to bomb Shanghai.

825
01:52:46,710 --> 01:52:48,960
轰炸上海？
Bomb Shanghai?

826
01:52:49,050 --> 01:52:51,050
我恨中国！
I hate China.

827
