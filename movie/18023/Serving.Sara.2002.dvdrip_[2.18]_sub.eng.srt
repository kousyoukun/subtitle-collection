1
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:22,562
My job sucks.

2
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,927
Got no future, got no benefits.

3
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:28,792
I`m here to pIay.

4
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,200
Oh, yeah? Who are you?

5
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,202
Who am I...?

6
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,203
I`m on the Iist.

7
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:33,239
Show me the Iist.

8
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:34,238
I`II point me out.

9
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:35,671
Yeah. There is no Iist.

10
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:37,573
CharIes Lazaro invited me.

11
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:38,872
Oh, so what you`re teIIing me

12
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:40,708
is that you`re a friend
of Fat CharIie`s?

13
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:42,874
WeII, I`m not a friend
Iike the doughnut guy

14
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,177
but, yeah, we`re friends.

15
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,185
WeII, we got
a IittIe probIem here, paI.

16
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:47,652
Fat CharIie has no friends.

17
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:48,881
You know what?

18
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:52,186
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

19
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,454
Thug?

20
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,655
Mr. Thug?

21
00:02:05,572 --> 00:02:07,767
Mm-hmm.

22
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:15,714
Shit.

23
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:24,188
Mm-hmm.

24
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:25,224
Going down.

25
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:31,692
Jimmy!

26
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,232
You crafty son of a bitch.

27
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,892
You reaIIy think you were

28
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,435
going to get away
with this, huh?

29
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:37,902
Step back a coupIe feet,

30
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:44,610

31

Barry Bond... s.

32
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,712

I was beamin` in the Beemer,

37
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:03,026
Can`t beIieve that I caught
my man cheatin`

38
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:07,328
So I found another way
to make him pay for it aII

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,367
Hey, Iadies...

40
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,527
Look at the paper.

41
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:13,328
Sir, there is a $100 minimum.

42
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:15,533
Right, of course.

43
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:16,803
Yeah.

44
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:18,606
How embarrassing.

45
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,737
Oh, when you go,
then everything goes

46
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:22,441
From the crib to the ride...

47
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:24,575
Here we go.

48
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:30,912
There`s-there`s 21...

Oh, yeah.

You`re the guy

00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:00,241
in the trunk of my car.

87
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:02,338
Let me guess.

88
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:03,677
That`s right, moron.

Now, Iisten to me.

00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,621
Yeah, weII... I do.

And I got the pictures

93
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:15,051
See for yourseIf.

94
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:32,801
There ain`t no pictures here.

95
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,904

96
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,381
as a witness in the racketeering
triaI of Freddie Marcuso.

97
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:39,644
What are you?

98
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,414
Some kind of a wacko?

99
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:44,321
Serving me papers

100
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:46,484
Rip his juguIar vein out.

CharIes?

106
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,500
It`s a pIeasure serving you.

107
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,041
And, you!

108
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:04,371
-Eat something.
-What?

109
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,344
You don`t fit in.

110
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,513
Mm-hmm.

111
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:15,747
Nice work, kiddo.

112
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,517
Next time, you hurry up.

113
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,455
I`m freezing my
ass off out here.

114
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,050
Here you go.

115
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:22,890
Mm-hmm...

116
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:25,487
And, hey, don`t spend

117
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,726
aII that on candy.

118
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,564
Son of a bitch.

119
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:31,627
Mm-hmm

120
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:34,173
Oh, oh, yeah

121
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:40,209
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm...

122
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:44,976
It took you six days
to serve this guy.

123
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:46,678
Six freaking days.

124
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:48,744
Hey, he disappeared on me.

125
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:52,019
A guy named Fat CharIie
disappeared on you?

126
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:53,992
Poof, Puff the Magic
Dragon, just gone?

127
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,186
Poof, bye-bye?

128
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:57,525
And I guess you mean to teII me

129
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,758
you ain`t seen
the ChrysIer BuiIding

130
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,664
on your way over
here, either?

131
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:04,670
If you want to spend your Iife
chasing nickeI and dime papers

132
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:05,796
you go right ahead.

133
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:07,066
Ray, the guy was

134
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,540
a difficuIt mark,
and I served him cIean.

135
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,042
What eIse do you want?

136
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:13,978
You know what I want?

137
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:17,574
I want you to be more
Iike Tony, here.

138
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,379
WeII, that`s impossibIe.
I waIk upright.

139
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,384
What are you saying?

140
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:21,477
I don`t have good posture?

141
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:22,953
I`m saying
you`re a NeanderthaI.

142
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,182
And I`m saying kiss my ass.

143
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:25,723
My mouth `s not big enough.

144
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,521
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Look.

145
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,186
You see this?

146
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:32,527
I gave Tony this fiIe
two hours ago.

147
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,157
It`s done.

148
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:36,065
What`s going on with you, Joe?

149
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:39,071
You used to be
my money guy, my assassin.

150
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:40,663
Now in the time it takes you

151
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,368
to do one job,
Wop-aIong Cassidy, here

152
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,375
serves seven papers.

153
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:45,604
It wouId have been eight

154
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,441
but I Iet Joe have
that one in Miami.

155
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:48,981
The onIy reason that is

156
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,481
is the mook can`t take Miami.

157
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,983
It`s too damn hot down there.

158
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,576
Miami`s not a city. It`s
a steam room with mosquitoes.

159
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,554
Oh, that`s great, Tony.
You`re a reguIar

160
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:57,920
process-serving savant.

161
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,083
What`d you caII me?

162
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,091
Savant-- that`s somebody

163
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,491
who`s reaIIy good
at something...

164
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,530
Oh, thanks, Joe.

165
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,395
...whiIe being a compIete idiot.

166
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:06,557
Hey!

167
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,594
Ladies, pIease!

168
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:13,962
Yeah, you reaIIy did serve
these reaIIy fast.

169
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,134
In fact, you served
them yesterday.

170
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,110
-What?
-What are you taIking about?

171
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:20,806
What`s the date today?

172
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,745
It`s the-the tenth.

173
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:25,182
It`s the 1 1th, numnuts.

174
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:27,913
Give me that.

175
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:30,114
Goddamn it, Tony!

176
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,384
ReIax, Ray, reIax.
I`II go back

177
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:32,788
to the courthouse.
I`II refiIe it.

178
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,793
It`s the big white buiIding
with the piIIars

179
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:35,953
in front of it.

180
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:36,996
Hey, screw you, Joe.

181
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:38,894
I`m tired of you
caIIing me stupid.

182
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,900
I`m not the one growing a
grapevine in my Iiving room.

183
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,765
This Ioser thinks
he`s going to be

184
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,429
Ernest and JuIio
freaking GaIIo.

185
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:49,202
Ray, do you have
a job for me, or not?

186
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,038
Look, I got one job

187
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,372
right now.

188
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:55,209
It`s an important job
out of Texas.

189
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:56,339
Pays five grand.

190
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:02,687
WeII, I was going to give it
to Tony

191
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:04,916
seeing he`s been so hot IateIy.

192
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:06,390
But now that we know

193
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:08,518
he can`t read
a goddamn caIendar

194
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,153
makes me a IittIe edgy.

195
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,061
So... here.

196
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,795
What? You going
to give it to Joe?

197
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:17,166
After two months
of screwups?

198
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,296
It`s going to take him
ten weeks to serve it.

199
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,636
WeII, thanks for the prediction,
Nostra-dumb-ass.

200
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,335
Don`t you have a courthouse
to find?

201
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:24,740
Eat me.

202
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,403
Eat you?

203
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,674
I`ve never been that hungry
in my Iife.

204
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:34,883
Listen, Joe.

205
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,444
This is the Texas branch

206
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,956
of my biggest account
here in New York.

207
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:42,461
This fiIe couId open up
a Iot of out-of-state business

208
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:45,190
for me, you understand?

209
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,289
It`s an easy job.

210
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,357
AII you gotta do is do it fast.

211
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:51,426
None of that IoIIygagging,
six-day crap on this.

212
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:52,801
I`m serious.

213
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:54,203
You got it, boss.

214
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:57,835
And Iet me just say,
from the bottom of my heart

215
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,503
that suit is kicking.

216
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,308
Get out!

217
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,178
I`m going to go.

218
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:04,841
You better go.

219
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:06,385
``Your suit kickin`.``

220
00:10:06,452 --> 00:10:08,818
Shoot, this suit cost me $300.

221
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:16,953
Adios, good-bye, amigos...

222
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,692
Say, what time is your fIight
again, sweetheart?

223
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:20,790
It`s 1 1 :20.

224
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:23,233
WeII, Iookie there!
Perfect timing.

225
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:24,826
I am the king.

226
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:25,996
WeII done, Mr. Cowboy.

227
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:27,835
That`s right, Mama.
Boy, I teII you what.

228
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:30,034
You`re my darIing,
dearest, dearie

229
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:31,906
darIing gaI, and
I`II teII you what.

230
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:34,708
Any of them New York boys got
their hands on you, and, ooh!

231
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:36,078
I wouIdn`t know what to do.

232
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:44,188
WeII, here we are.

233
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,521
Now, hey, you caII me
when you get there?

234
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:47,923
I wiII.

235
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:50,360
Oh, I`m sorry.

236
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,125
I Iove you, girI.

237
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:53,790
I Iove you, too.

238
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,493
Okay.

239
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,599
You get that, aII right?

240
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:04,902
WeII, go on.

241
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:06,946
Have a good time.

242
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:08,173
Okay. Bye.

243
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,117
I used to crank and drink
untiI my back was to the fIoor

244
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,217
I`d take it to the Iimit,
then I`d try to get some more

245
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:24,125
And when it came to gambIing...

246
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:28,157
Hey, you!

247
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:30,693
Hey, darIing!

248
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,169
Hey, how are you?

249
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:33,205
Good. Huh?

250
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,934
What`d I teII you?
Perfect timing.

251
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,169
You`re the king.

252
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,143
Thank you very much.

253
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,840
Ooh, I missed you.

254
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:43,074
Hey!

255
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,084
AII right, aII right,
we`re going.

256
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:47,210
Quick as a hiccup.

257
00:11:57,897 --> 00:11:59,660
Hey, Joe.

258
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,632
No hard feeIings
about before, Joe?

259
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:02,690
ReaIIy.

260
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,703
Good Iuck.

261
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:05,999
Yeah, bIow me.

262
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:08,199
Yeah, keep dreaming, Joe.

263
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,799
He gets me
with that every time.

264
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,213
HeIIo?

265
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,807
Sara Moore?

266
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,012
Yeah?

267
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:22,213
Listen up.

268
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:24,222
If I were you,
I`d get the heII out

269
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,053
of your apartment right now.

270
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,093
Who is this?

271
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:30,322
Let`s just say a... a friend.

272
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:32,864
Look, some asshoIe`s on his way
up there to serve you papers.

273
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,593
He`s going to say
he`s deIivering fIowers.

274
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,861
Papers?

275
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:37,903
What? Is this about
my parking tickets?

276
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,938
No, no, no, no.
It`s a Iot bigger than that.

277
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,234
Look, I reaIIy don`t have
any idea

278
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,602
what you`re taIking about, so...

279
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:43,903
Hey, Iady?

280
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:46,137
When is getting served papers
ever good, huh?

281
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,112
Don`t be stupid.
Hang up, and get out.

282
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,827
Oh...

283
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,194
Sara Moore?

284
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:11,167
Um... no, uh...

285
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:12,761
she`s there in 7-E.

286
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,272
Thanks.

287
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:25,209
You know, once that IittIe Iight
goes on, you`re good.

288
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:26,876
Yeah.

289
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:37,952
Sara, weIcome home!

290
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,793
Why are you caIIing me Sara?

291
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:40,798
Hey!

292
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,425
Sara!

293
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:44,299
Merry Christmas.

294
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,305
Shit!

295
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:00,744
Taxi!

296
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:04,282
Taxi!

297
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:06,723
Oh!

298
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:09,358
Excuse me. Uh...

299
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:11,761
Whoa, whoa!

300
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:18,069
Mrs. Moore.

301
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:19,468
Do you have an appointment?

302
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,200
I just need to get away
for a sec.

303
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,534
Okay, have a nice day.

304
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:26,368
Whoa! Creep!

305
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:31,313
I`d Iike to request...

306
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:32,612
Sir, can I heIp you?

307
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:34,482
Sir, this is
a woman`s spa, sir.

308
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,646
CooI!

309
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,655
Oh!

310
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,831
Either of you two creatures seen
Sara Moore?

311
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,368
Get out!

312
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:52,233
Hey, you are wrapped
too tight, Iady.

313
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,829
Excuse me, sir.
You cannot...

314
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,238
Hey, Sara, weIcome back.

315
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:58,937
Why do peopIe keep
caIIing me Sara? I`m not.

316
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,043
Can I heIp you?

317
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:04,104
HeIIo.

318
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:11,015
Man, sIow down!

319
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,857
Whoa!

320
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:34,976
I can`t beIieve
you messed this up.

321
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:36,036
I did not mess it up.

322
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:37,514
I toId you he`d mess it up.

323
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,676
It`s a goddamn cakewaIk, Joe.

324
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:41,515
Look, I chased her aII through

325
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:43,521
Midtown Manhattan for two hours.

326
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:44,817
I froze my dick off.

327
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,051
Boo-hyphen-hoo.

328
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:48,388
Huh!

329
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:50,622
Has anybody informed you,
this job is not easy.

330
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:51,628
I`m going to find her.

331
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:53,096
It`s not going to be a probIem.

332
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,462
WeII, it aIready is
a probIem.

333
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,831
I`m giving the fiIe

334
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,529
What?

335
00:15:58,604 --> 00:15:59,832
Come on. Give me the papers.

336
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,702
You know what?
I don`t know

00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,639

giving you this job

338
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:04,676
in the first pIace.

339
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,269
Look, you are making
a mistake, Ray.

340
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:09,314
I know exactIy
where she is.

341
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,974
Good. TeII it to Tony.

00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,518
Thanks, Boss.

343
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,281
She`s up Ray`s ass.

344
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:18,152
You shouId know your way around.

345
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:37,871
Mm-hmm.

346
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:45,817
Mm-hmm.

347
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:54,590
Mm-hmm...

348
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:06,604
Mm-hmm...

349
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:40,200
Hey, Joe.

350
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:41,603
Hey, Lenny.

351
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:44,040
Santa, you`re supposed to give
the gifts, not take them.

352
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,338
Yeah, I got a present for you.

353
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:46,503
MiIty, I need a favor.

354
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,137
Yeah.

355

357
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:53,142

phone numbers, pIease?

362
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,285
Uh, I don`t know

363
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:06,195
but the ``In`` is winning

364
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:11,459
Okay.

365
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:13,164
Maybe this wiII heIp.

366
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:15,332
Oh, no.

367
00:18:15,408 --> 00:18:17,933
I think my eyes are going,
because I onIy see 20 bucks.

368
00:18:20,112 --> 00:18:21,670
How about now?

369
00:18:21,747 --> 00:18:24,181
Oh, there we go.

Nice nose...

386
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,024
Better than yesterday.

387
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:19,631
Yeah.

388
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:21,495
I`m the idiot.

389
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:34,108
Nice pIace.

390
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:42,520
It`s good.

391
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:04,473
Miami Marriott.

392
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,477
Uh, Sara Moore, pIease.

393
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,911
One moment, pIease.

394
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,211
Uh, sir, I`m sorry

395
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:14,047
but Ms. Moore won`t be checking
in untiI tomorrow morning.

396
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,484
Tomorrow morning?

397
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:16,680
Oh, thank you.

398
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:18,416
Thank you very much.

399
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,587
I gotcha.

400
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:43,873
May I heIp you?

401
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,348
You got gas.

402
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,941
Excuse me?

403
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:48,509
You got Ieakage.

404
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:49,679
Excuse me?

405
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:51,188
Not you, Iady.

406
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:53,588
Your house.

407
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,889
But we have eIectric.

408
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,895
Yeah, I know. That`s why
it`s kind of a pickIe.

409
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:00,124
Can I sniff around?

410
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:01,632
ActuaIIy, no.

411
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,724
Thanks.

412
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:05,133
Not sniffing any gas,
but I do detect

413
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:06,193
the smeII of coffee.

414
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:07,203
You know, I think

415
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:09,137
you shouId just Ieave.

416
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,472
Yeah, why don`t you run
in the kitchen and grab me

417
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:13,135
a cup of coffee
aII right, cupcake?

418
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:14,975
Nice pIace you got here.
It`s reaI rustic.

419
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:16,412
Amanda?

420
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,507
Hey, are you okay?
What`s going on?

421
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,779
I heard aII that shouting
down there.

422
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:24,916
Oh, no!

423
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,389
Sara Moore

424
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,188
you are hereby served
for divorce.

425
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:30,592
Divorce?! What?!

426
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:32,153
SmiIe.

427
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,165
No, hang on. Wait-wait a minute.

428
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,461
You must have
the wrong person.

429
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:36,933
Um, you must be Iooking

430
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:38,401
for a different
Sara Moore.

431
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,062
That`s what
they aII say.

432
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,436
But I`m happiIy married.

433
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:42,474
Not anymore.

434
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:49,513
CouId I get that coffee
to go, uh...?

435
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:56,246
This is Ray.
Who the heII is this?

436
00:22:56,388 --> 00:22:59,357
Hey, Ray, I`II teII you
who the heII this is.

437
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,256
It`s Joe,
so why don`t you put

438
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:04,624
that doughnut down for a second
and Iisten to me.

439
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:06,358
Guess who I just served.

440
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,093
Sara Moore. That`s right.

441
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,067
So get your checkbook out.

442
00:23:10,135 --> 00:23:12,467
And since you took me off
this gig

443
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,733
and I had to do it
on my own time

444
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:17,002
you better pay me doubIe, okay?

445
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:19,840
Say good night, sweet prince.

446
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,505
Oh, no.

447
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:28,153
Look, if you want to use
the phone, just ask.

448
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,346
You served Fat CharIie

449
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,719
now Fat CharIie serves you.

450
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,951
And I`II say we served
him pretty good, too.

451
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,755
So, BrookIyn`s in the house?

452
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:39,864
Hey!

453
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,661
Oh, my... Sara!

454
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:42,996
Sara, oh, my God.

455
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:44,933
You have got to see this.

456
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:46,470
What?

457
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:47,971
I don`t fit in, huh?

458
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,065
Huh? How about this?

459
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:51,803
Now do I fit in?

460
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:52,935
How does that fit, huh?

461
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:55,843
I`m gIad.

462
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:58,178
Yo, AIdo, you know, I`ve been
doing some thinking IateIy.

463
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,842
I`m getting kind of
tired of carpooIing.

464
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:00,976
How about you?

465
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:02,520
Yeah, I couId use
a IittIe room myseIf.

466
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:03,680
You don`t mind
there, Petey.

467
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:04,950
Oh, there`s a car
right here.

468
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:06,388
I couId just take this car, no?

469
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,948
Why not?

470
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,653
You`re not taking my car.
That was nothing.

471
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,660
Come on!

472
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:11,627
Whoa!

473
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:13,392
Is that aII you got...?

474
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:14,591
Get over here!

475
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:18,669
Hey, what are you,
some kind of machinist?

476
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:21,501
Are you trying to say
``masochist``?

477
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:23,165
What a meathead!

478
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:25,039
Whoa!

479
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,743
HoId on. HoId on a second.

480
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:31,180
Your diaper`s Ioose.

481
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,826
That`s it?!

482
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:51,870
That`s aII you girIs got?!

483
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,336
That was nothing!

484
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:54,736
Nothing!

485
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:00,376
Baby`s going to take nappy.

486
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:18,494
Oh!

487
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:39,616
Sorry.

488
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:40,845
Wretched bag.

489
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:47,683
WeII, weII, there is a God.

490
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,557
ActuaIIy, it was two ItaIians.

491
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,830
Do you have any feeIings?

492
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,890
Do you have any shred
of humanity or compassion?

493
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,096
WeII, IittIe sick dogs puII
at my heartstrings

494
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:02,732
but certainIy not trophy wives
from AustraIia.

495
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,366
AustraIia?

496
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:06,638
Look, first of aII,
I`m EngIish, you twit.

497
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,681
And second of aII, we`ve had
our ups and downs

498
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:10,976
but I stuck it out

499
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:12,983
and trophy wives
don`t do that.

500
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,541
Do you know what?

501
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,645
The guy on the phone was right.

502
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:18,417
You are an asshoIe.

503
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,516
Hey, I was just doing my jo...

504
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:23,759
What guy on the phone?

505
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:24,989
The guy that caIIed up
to my apartment

506
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:26,655
to say you were on your way up
with those IoveIy papers.

507
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:27,994
Somebody tipped you off?

508
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,294
Who?

509
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:30,494
Yeah, Iike I know everyone

510
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,093
in New York
with a BrookIyn accent.

511
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,195
Tony.

512
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:36,104
It`s got to be Tony.

513
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:37,198
The son of a bitch.

514
00:26:37,342 --> 00:26:40,038
He`s been tipping off my marks
for two months.

515
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:41,636
That`s why
it`s been so hard.

516
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,408
WeII, my heart bIeeds for you.

517
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:45,712
I`m going to kiII
that son of a bitch!

518
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:48,582
Mind your own business,
pork chop.

519
00:26:58,597 --> 00:27:00,064
Goddamn monkeys.

520
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:02,290
Hey, Chico

521
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:03,800
make it cooIer, cooIer.

522
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:05,427
CuIo. Tu quieres cuIo?

523
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:06,493
Yo te doy cuIo!

524
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:09,131
Not Iouder. CooIer!

525
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:10,674
Este gringo me moIesta...

526
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:12,937
No gringo. ItaIiano.

527
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:13,943
Mambo ItaIiano.

528
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:14,944
No mambo ItaIiano.

529
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:16,310
Mambo King, Armand Assante.

530
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,178
-Mambo King soy yo.
-Hey, Chico

531
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,808
just drop me off
in America, okay?

532
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:21,546
Agase para... carajo, feo!

533
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:34,927
Hey.

534
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,365
Hey, I got another question.

535
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:38,835
How do peopIe do it?

536
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:42,132
I know you`re awake, so stop
pretending to be asIeep.

537
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:44,004
ActuaIIy, I was
pretending to be dead

538
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:46,476
but I can`t fooI you.

539
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:49,173
How can someone end a marriage
Iike that, just...

540
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:51,078
pow?

541
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,674
What? Are you teIIing me
you didn`t see this coming?

542
00:27:53,752 --> 00:27:55,720
Let me guess.
A Iot of trips out of town.

543
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:56,776
``Go ahead, honey.

544
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:58,755
``Go ahead. Don`t worry your
pretty IittIe head.

545
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:00,223
I`II take care
of the homestead...``

546
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:02,590
Not to mention those extra poker
nights with the boys.

547
00:28:02,661 --> 00:28:05,061
Gordon doesn`t pIay poker.

548
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,154
Missing my point.

549
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:08,630
Look, I`ve served thousands
of subpoenas.

550
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,032
Granted, never one to
somebody as hot as you.

551
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:12,365
I don`t know
your husband

552
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,632
but I do have a great deaI
of insight into men.

553
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:17,038
And we are mean,
hurtfuI and despicabIe.

554
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:20,169
MaIe headquarters wouId kiII me

555
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:22,041
if they knew I was
teIIing you this.

556
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:24,378
Yeah, weII, `` despicabIe``
is putting it miIdIy.

557
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:25,541
And then,
you compIain that

558
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:26,743
we get haIf of everything.

559
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:28,786
BeIieve me, after this type
of treatment

560
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:30,651
haIf is the very Ieast
we shouId get.

561
00:28:30,722 --> 00:28:32,155
The onIy thing you`re getting
haIf of, honey

562
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:33,486
is screwed.

563
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:35,651
What do you mean?

564
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:36,921
He served you first.

565
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:39,657
He`s in Texas, and he`s got
home-court advantage.

566
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,961
Wait. Served me first?

567
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:43,467
What is this? Third grade?

568
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,196
Yeah, sometimes.

569
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:47,669
Texas has the most conservative
divorce Iaws

570
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:49,001
in the country.

571
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:51,907
Not to mention
those good oI` boy judges.

572
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:54,343
Sure most of them aren`t married
to their first wives.

573
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:55,505
BeIieve me

574
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,512
if I`d known
this was coming

575
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:58,014
I`d have been the one
doing the serving.

576
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,311
-Yeah.
-How about that, huh?

577
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:00,351
Whatever.

578
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:01,351
No, seriousIy.

579
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,854
What wouId have happened
if I`d served him first?

580
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:05,150
Okay, if you had served
him first

581
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,780
the triaI wouId have been
in New York--

582
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:09,156
not in Texas-- where you wouId
have fared a Iot better.

583
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:11,524
50% better, actually.

584
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:28,672
Hey, I have a proposition
for you.

585
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:29,975
You tear up the papers on me

586
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:31,709
and I`II hire you
to serve my husband.

587
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:33,683
I`II pay you twice
what you`re getting now.

588
00:29:33,752 --> 00:29:35,413
Look, here`s
what you don`t understand.

589
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,512
I`ve aIready toId them
that I served you, okay?

590
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,523
So if I fIip it
and tag your husband

591
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,081
my reputation wiII be shot.

592
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,421
I`II never work again.

593
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:45,554
I`II give you ten percent
of my divorce settIement.

594
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,154
We own a cattIe ranch.

595
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:49,700
It`s worth $20 miIIion.

596
00:29:49,768 --> 00:29:51,395
$20 miIIion?

597
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,402
Mm-hmm.

598
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:53,369
Ten percent of haIf?

599
00:29:53,438 --> 00:29:54,370
Mm-hmm.

600
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,031
You`re wiIIing to pay me
a miIIion doIIars.

601
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:58,133
WeII, that stiII Ieaves
nine for me

602
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,677
versus next to nothing.

603
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:02,577
It`s kind of a no-brainer.

604
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,114
You`re reaIIy serious?

605
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:06,673
I think we shouId draw up
a contract.

606
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:08,844
Let`s see...

607
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,182
Won`t be needing this.

608
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:22,663
One... miIIion...

609
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:27,200
DoIIars...
Great, Iet`s go.

610
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:39,405
Thanks a Iot.

611
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:44,648
Miami Marriott.

612
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:46,588
If anybody caIIs
for Ms. Sara Moore

613
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:48,353
teII them she`s reIocated

614
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:51,156
to one of your hoteIs
in Bangor, Maine.

615
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:54,665
Bangor, Maine.

616
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,064
That`s right, Bangor, Maine.

617
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:57,260
That`s where she`II be.

618
00:30:57,335 --> 00:30:58,700
I thought we were going
to DaIIas.

619
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,931
We are. Just pIaying
a IittIe game of hide-and-seek.

620
00:31:01,006 --> 00:31:02,371
Now break out your credit cards.

621
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,771
We got tickets to buy.

622
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:06,333
WeII, I`m packin` up my game,
and I`m a-head out West

623
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:08,811
Where reaI women come equipped

624
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,211
With scripts and fake breasts

625
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:12,545
I`m Kid Rock,
and I`m the reaI McCoy

626
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:15,051
And I`m headin` out West, sucker

627
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,214
Because I wanna be a cowboy,
baby

628
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:21,026
With the top Iet back
and the sunshine shining

629
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:22,118
With the top Iet back
and the sunshine shining

630
00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:25,027
Cowboy, baby

631
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:26,927
West Coast chiIIin`
with the Boone`s wine

632
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:30,229
I wanna be a cowboy, baby

633
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:32,826
Ridin` at night,
`cause I sIeep aII day

634
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:34,895
Cowboy.

635
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:36,099
AII right, got my papers

636
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:37,766
and you know your way
around this pIace, right?

637
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:39,776
ActuaIIy, I`ve never been inside
before

638
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:40,970
but Gordon aIways said

639
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:43,241
it was his pIace
to come and ``focus.``

640
00:31:43,348 --> 00:31:46,249
Yeah, weII, aII you have to do
is point him out

641
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:47,943
and then stay out of sight

642
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:50,146
because if he sees you,
we`re done.

643
00:31:50,222 --> 00:31:52,782
Is it okay if I strangIe him
from behind?

644
00:31:54,326 --> 00:31:56,260
Yes, you can do
whatever you want

645
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:58,125
but wait untiI I serve him.

646
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:01,131
Okay.

647
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:04,498
Let me see that scarf.

648
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:10,206
Okay, aII set.

649
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:12,209
If you have a moment,
I`d Iike to take you two

650
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:13,835
on a IittIe tour here
of our faciIity.

651
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:16,710
Why, that wouId be IoveIy.

652
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:17,713
Great.

653
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:19,306
So, what part of London
are you from?

654
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:20,851
Hampstead.

655
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:22,910
Hmm, sorry,
I`m not famiIiar with it.

656
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:24,853
WeII, it`s on the corner
of Penny Lane and Abbey Road.

657
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:26,356
Hmm...

658
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:28,187
very interesting.

659
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,818
How many pounds

660
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,418
were you Iooking at Iosing?

661
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:33,225
WeII, I don`t think
it`s important

662
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:36,426
to taIk about money
at this point, do you?

663
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:37,991
You see, pounds... money...

664
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:39,832
Be quiet.

665
00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:42,702
How exactIy did you hear
about us

666
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:44,901
Mr. and Mrs...

667
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:46,944
``Poppins``?

668
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:49,071
WeII, we have an acquaintance
here at the cIub

669
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:50,637
a Gordon Moore.

670
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:52,740
SoIid, soIid, soIid feIIow.

671
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:55,115
AbsoIuteIy.
As a matter of fact

672
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:57,245
I beIieve Mr. Moore`s
working out here this morning.

673
00:32:57,389 --> 00:32:58,651
Perhaps we`II run into him.

674
00:32:58,723 --> 00:32:59,781
Perhaps.

675
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:01,348
I`II just show you
the men`s area now.

676
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:02,791
JoIIy good.

677
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:05,694
Mrs. Poppins, if you`II wait
here for just a moment

678
00:33:05,764 --> 00:33:07,197
we`II be back in a
jiffy, as you say.

679
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:08,993
Oh, okay, thanks.

680
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:15,068
I shouId teII you,
I don`t Iike to Iift things.

681
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:25,608
I`m sweating.

682
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,117
You`re gIowing, darIing.

683
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:29,119
Hey, how`s my form?

684
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:30,950
Yeah, yours is pretty good.

685
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:31,954
Keep it up, Gordon.

686
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:33,581
Oh, it`s up.

687
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:34,989
It`s up.

688
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,186
Focusing?!

689
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:37,193
AsshoIe!

690
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:38,490
Sara?

691
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:40,690
Yeah!...
Joe, quick. It`s him, quick!

692
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:42,062
Where?! Where?!

693
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,395
I just wanted to show you
our candIe-Iit PiIates...

694
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:44,435
You stop him, AIIison!

695
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:50,497
Look, Iady, I`m not going
to hit a girI, okay?

696
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:56,575
You go, girI!

697
00:33:56,648 --> 00:33:57,580
Go on, Joe.

698
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:03,178
WeII, guess there`s
a first time for everything.

699
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:06,381
Nice.

700
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:09,721
Take that!

701
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:11,193
Quick! He`s getting away!

702
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,059
Remind me
to give you a raise.

703
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:15,624
Oh, for Christ`s sake!

704
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,793
Look, babe
can we taIk about this?

705
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:21,896
Get up!

706
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,637
Way to Iay Iow back there.

707
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,202
WeII, you said to point him out.

708
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:30,746
I just pointed him out.

709
00:34:30,815 --> 00:34:31,873
Hey, you are going to have

710
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,611
to get in controI
of your anger, okay?

711
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:35,209
You made us Iook
Iike fooIs in there.

712
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:36,377
I did?

713
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:38,115
WeII, hey, at Ieast
I wasn`t beaten up by a girI.

714
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:39,554
Hey, that was not a girI.

715
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:41,421
I distinctIy saw
an Adam`s appIe

716
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:44,018
and a buIge that I was
not comfortabIe with.

717
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:45,357
The onIy thing
we had going for us

718
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,227
was the eIement of surprise,
and you bIew that.

719
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:48,662
Look, I know Gordon`s habits.

720
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:50,030
I can easiIy find him again.

721
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:51,432
Oh, what do you think?

722
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:53,971
He`s just going to sit around,
waiting for us to serve him?

723
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:55,630
No, he`s history.

724
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:59,234
AII he has to do is jump on
the first internationaI fIight

725
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,208
and then we`re done, aII right?

726
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:02,837
Even if I find him

727
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:04,745
I can`t serve him
outside the United States.

728
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:06,977
I don`t Iike your tone.

729
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:09,485
Oh, you don`t Iike my tone,
Your Highness?

730
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,022
Don`t forget, whenever I want,
I can serve

731
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,079
your papers again.

732
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:15,183
Look, you can stand there
and threaten me

733
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,058
or we couId just get in the car
and go and find Gordon.

734
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,096
Oh, yeah?

735
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:20,722
Okay, where do you want to go...

736
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:23,127
boss?

737
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,266
WeII, as your boss, I`d be
interested in your suggestions.

738
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,069
This is crazy.

739
00:35:31,142 --> 00:35:33,337
You`re crazy

740
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:34,901
and I quit.

741
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:44,012
Hey, I thought
you were quitting.

742
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:46,215
Who the heII am I going
to quit to?

743
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:48,656
I gave up haIf my Iife
for this crap.

744
00:35:53,998 --> 00:35:55,590
So, what are we going
to do first?

745
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,100
WeII, I think we, uh--

746
00:35:57,168 --> 00:35:59,329
and when I say ``we,``
I mean you--

747
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:01,998
shouId find a mute button
for yourseIf.

748
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,616
Necessita mas toaIIas
en Ia habitacion numero 150.

749
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:17,552
Asi que cuando pueda...

750
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:19,055
Excuse me... Yo!

751
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:20,385
HeIIo.

752
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:21,550
Can I heIp you?

753
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:22,888
Yeah, you can heIp me.

754
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:25,759
I got an important business
meeting with a Sara Moore.

755
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,388
-Sara Moore?
-Sara Moore, Moore.

756
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:28,830
M-O-O-O-R-E.

757
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,197
Here.

758
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:32,563
You sure about that?

759
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:34,127
Yeah, I`m sure about that.

760
00:36:34,205 --> 00:36:35,297
What`s the matter?

761
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:37,637
I don`t Iook Iike a goddamn
businessman to you?

762
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:38,676
No, no, sir. It`s just that

763
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:39,903
her reservation`s been canceIed.

764
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:42,003
CanceIed? What the...?

765
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,208
I do have a forwarding address
if that wouId be heIpfuI.

766
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:46,715
Yeah, that wouId be heIpfuI.

767
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,376
Can you throw in
a IittIe breeze

768
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:49,681
whiIe you`re at it?

769
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,487
Hey, cutie, how you doing?

770
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:56,816
She`s nice.

771
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,419
Who`s that?
Your sister?

772
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,430
Okay, Warren,
earn your money.

773
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:03,490
You want to teII me
what the heII`s going on?

774
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:06,036
Sure.

775
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:07,731
Everything is beautifuI.

776
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:10,865
My best guy served her
this morning up in Westchester.

777
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:13,137
AII I`m doing is
waiting on the papers.

778
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:14,838
Oh, reaIIy?

779
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:17,643
WeII, maybe you can expIain
how that`s possibIe

780
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:19,182
when she`s in DaIIas, moron.

781
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,150
DaIIas? DaIIas, Texas?

782
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:23,881
That`s right.
And she`s not aIone either.

783
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:26,150
She`s down here with some
goddamn process server

784
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:27,384
trying to serve my cIient.

785
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,447
Who`s this Joe anyway?

786
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:30,016
Is he one of yours?

787
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:32,028
Joe? Who-- Joe-Joe the singer?

788
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:33,085
No, I...

789
00:37:33,164 --> 00:37:35,428
I don`t know a Joe.

790
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,263
I can`t say I know a Joe.

791
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:41,831
Look here, um, Mr. Moore

792
00:37:41,906 --> 00:37:46,741
don`t worry about a thing, okay?
AII right?

793
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:49,336
Uh, just give me

794
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:50,642
and as God is my witness

00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:53,047

796
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,483

797
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:56,918
Hey...

my wife you`re taIking

799
00:37:58,756 --> 00:38:00,417
Of course, sir,
uh, my apoIogies.

800
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,787
This better get done.

801
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,421
Or I`m going to hang your ass
out to dry, you understand?

802
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:10,700
``This better get done.

803
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:13,566
Otherwise, I`m gonna hang
your ass out to dry.``

804
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:16,072
Jesus...

805
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,132
a redneck teIIing a bIack man
he gonna hang him.

806
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,644
That`s the new miIIennium.

807
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,613
Page Tony!

808
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:25,911
And get Farrakhan and them
on the phone.

809
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:28,612
I-I think they might want
a trip down there.

810
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:32,282
Doris, couId you send
Vernon in here pIease?

811
00:38:32,357 --> 00:38:33,984
Now, Gordon,
as your attorney

812
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:36,151
I wouId advise you not to get
your personaI security

813
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:37,626
invoIved in the matter.

814
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:42,029
Mm-hmm. WeII, as my attorney,
you screwed this up, dickweed.

815
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,866
Now... Iet`s go over this

816
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:48,599
one more time.

817
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:51,506
I`m teIIing you
I don`t know where it is.

818
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:52,736
You`re teIIing me

819
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,868
you don`t know where it is.

820
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:54,912
No, I swear to God.

821
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,208
Yeah.

822
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:06,086
TeII Mr. Moore
I`II be there momentariIy.

823
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:14,163
Listen to me

824
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:15,526
you IittIe punk...

825
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,090
you`re not going anywhere

826
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:20,160
untiI we find the stapIer.

827
00:39:20,304 --> 00:39:26,140
It was Tommy in accounting!
He took it!

828
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,542
I use paper cIips!

829
00:39:35,853 --> 00:39:37,377
Oh... ah.

830
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:38,422
My word.

831
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:48,691
I`m just getting the brake off.

832
00:39:53,004 --> 00:39:55,768
You`re aware of my current
personaI situation

833
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,864
right?

834
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:58,033
As much as you toId me...

835
00:39:58,109 --> 00:39:59,337
yes, sir.

836
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,502
See, I got my taiI

837
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:01,670
in a crack here.

838
00:40:01,746 --> 00:40:03,611
And I want you to do
whatever you need to do

839
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:06,844
to keep this IowIife server
away from me, okay?

840
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:08,818
Now, my overpaid Iawyer
here wiII fiII you in

841
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:11,980
on his description
and whereabouts.

842
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:13,523
Now, he`s with my wife.

843
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:15,752
So Iet`s not Iet
anything happen to her.

844
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,021
But, now, that guy?

845
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:18,892
Oh, weII...

846
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:20,191
I couId give a rat`s ass.

847
00:40:20,264 --> 00:40:22,960
Oh, I`II take care of it, sir.

848
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:25,127
Got Tony on Iine two.

849
00:40:25,203 --> 00:40:26,670
He says there`s a probIem.

850
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:28,603
No kidding.

851
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:31,639
Where the heII are you?

852
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,233
I`m in Maine.

853
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:34,503
Maine?

854
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:36,069
What the heII
you doing in Maine?

855
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:38,411
I`m freezing my baIIs off,
that`s what.

856
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:40,883
The bitch is in DaIIas,
you idiot.

857
00:40:40,952 --> 00:40:42,351
DaIIas?!

858
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,648
I think Joe set me up.

859
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:46,189
Oh, there`s a news fIash.

860
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,894
Look, he`s down there with her

861
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:52,429
trying to serve her husband.

862
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:53,521
He fIipped on us.

863
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:54,895
He fIipped his mark.

864
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:57,935
Now you go stick your baIIs
in a cup of hot cocoa.

865
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:00,197
CIick your heeIs three times,
Dorothy

866
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:01,829
and get down to DaIIas.

867
00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:03,066
You naiI her first

868
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,371
or we are done, it`s over.

869
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:06,967
You understand?

870
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:17,479
You know, I need to caII
Miss CIeo.

871
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:21,218
Psychics, psychics...
is that ``P`` or ``S``?

872
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:30,693
Let me guess...
empIoyees of the month?

873
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:31,860
Ha, ha.

874
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:34,496
So I just... I just don`t know.

875
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:36,005
What`s normaI anymore?

876
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:39,166
Hi, Doris.

877
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,737
What`s going on?

878
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:44,873
I wouId Iove to teII you

879
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:46,576
but I can`t.

880
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:48,243
Mr. Moore had his Iawyer

881
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,718
make aII of us sign...

882
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:54,256
affidavits...

883
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:55,586
this morning saying

884
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,560
we wouIdn`t divuIge
his whereabouts.

885
00:41:57,628 --> 00:41:58,617
Hmm. Nice.

886
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:11,641
WeII, you`ve been
compIeteIy useIess, Doris.

887
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:13,472
I reaIIy wish
I hadn`t been

888
00:42:13,544 --> 00:42:14,704
so nice to you
over the years.

889
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:15,746
Let`s go.
Let`s go.

890
00:42:17,915 --> 00:42:19,712
So what`s in Durango?

891
00:42:19,784 --> 00:42:21,513
Oh, he just bought
a cattIe ranch there.

892
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,213
I haven`t been there
myseIf yet, though.

893
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:24,788
It`s Gordon`s IittIe
pet project.

894
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,980
How do you feeI
about waIking faster?

895
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,458
-Good.
-Good.

896
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:36,426
Two tickets on the next
fIight to Durango, pIease.

897
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,229
Okeydokey.
Um, I just need

898
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:39,997
a credit card
and some ID, pIease.

899
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:42,437
Sure.

900
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,508
There you go.

901
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:50,177
Oh.

902
00:42:50,248 --> 00:42:52,045
WeII, at Ieast
those two are happy.

903
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:54,676
Oh, pIease. That has ``affair``
written aII over it.

904
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:56,515
Why do you say that?

905
00:42:56,587 --> 00:42:58,782
Who makes out
with their wife?

906
00:42:58,856 --> 00:42:59,880
See, ring...

907
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:02,653
no ring.

908
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:05,821
I bet Gordon`s having an affair.

909
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:07,558
You think?

910
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:09,293
Yeah.

911
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:11,733
You know what, I reaIIy do.

912
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:14,896
Um, I`m sorry, miss,
but my computer shows

913
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:17,372
that your credit card`s
been, um, canceIed.

914
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:18,567
CanceIed?

915
00:43:18,643 --> 00:43:19,803
Gordon virus.

916
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:21,037
Goddamn it!

917
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:22,044
No. No, no, no.

918
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:23,478
Look, I know he wants
to divorce me

919
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:25,674
but, beIieve me, he wouId not
want me to be penniIess.

920
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,650
Um, excuse me, couId
you try this card?

921
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:29,811
Honey, if he
canceIed that card

922
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:31,980
he canceIed aII the cards.

923
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:37,018
Excuse me, one second.

924
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:38,584
No, uh...

925
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:46,263
Denise... hi.

926
00:43:48,472 --> 00:43:51,100
It`s not...

927
00:43:58,149 --> 00:44:01,175
Oh, no.

928
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:08,050
I just Ianded.

929
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:09,387
I`II take care of business...

930
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,189
Hey, fatboy,
you need to watch where...

931
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:12,956
Uh, these tickets

932
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,588
say, uh, ``Durango.``

933
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:16,929
Uh, we need,
we need to go to AmariIIo.

934
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:18,559
It`s going to take me
another minute.

935
00:44:25,443 --> 00:44:27,070
Hey, Joe.

936
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:29,874
What a nice surprise.

937
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:31,642
Oh, nice Iook,
Don Ho.

938
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:33,047
So racking up

939
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:34,982
those frequent fIyer miIes?

940
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:36,644
Yeah, thanks for the worId tour,
ass wipe.

941
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:38,916
WeII, you`ve been
tipping off my marks

942
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,423
for about a month, so I figured

943
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:41,423
it was payback time.

944
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:42,424
You figured that out, huh?

945
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:44,961
Yeah, using my brain and aII.

946
00:44:45,029 --> 00:44:46,894
Yeah, weII, the way I see it

947
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:49,489
aII those jobs were mine
before you came aIong.

948
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,467
So I was just taking back
what aIready beIonged to me.

949
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:54,629
You grew up around a Iot
of Iead paint, didn`t you?

950
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,969
Enough of the chitchat.
Where`s the girI?

951
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,099
-What girI?
-The girI.

952
00:44:58,175 --> 00:44:59,142
Oh, Sara?

953
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:00,234
Yeah.

954
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:02,335
Oh, I think she`s in Copenhagen.
Right, Copenhagen?

955
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:03,471
Yeah.

956
00:45:03,547 --> 00:45:04,605
ReaIIy?

957
00:45:04,682 --> 00:45:05,774
Yeah, the Iuge finaIs.

958
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,078
Oh.

959
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:09,176
WeII, that wouIdn`t be her
waIking out of the bathroom

960
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,185
over there now,
wouId it?

961
00:45:12,857 --> 00:45:15,792
Yo, Tony!

962
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,157
What?

963
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:27,098
Hey, Iook, that man...

964
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:28,536
He`s trying to serve you.

965
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:29,766
-What?
-Come on.

966
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,829
Go, go, go, go!

967
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:31,897
Here.

968
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:36,612
Ooh!

969
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:40,048
Oh!

970
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:41,049
Oh, no.

971
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:42,142
No.

972
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:05,674
You okay?

973
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:06,971
No.

974
00:46:08,546 --> 00:46:09,979
Oh, God!

975
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:16,885
Can we get off, pIease?

976
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:36,630
Oh!

977
00:46:36,707 --> 00:46:38,732
My pant Ieg`s stuck.

978
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:39,798
Oh.

979
00:46:39,877 --> 00:46:41,105
Okay. Uh...

980
00:46:41,178 --> 00:46:42,338
Here.

981
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:44,244
What are you doing?

982
00:46:48,185 --> 00:46:49,209
Okay.

983
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:53,220
Jesus Christ! I said ``heIp me,``
not ``undress me.``

984
00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:55,154
Oh, I`m sorry...
I didn`t hear you

985
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:56,625
over the big machine

986
00:46:56,694 --> 00:46:58,662
that was going to rip you
into IittIe pieces.

987
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:02,287
Come on.

988
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:05,164
WeII, I onIy have
haIf a pair of pants on

989
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:06,291
if you hadn`t noticed.

990
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:08,099
WeII, I for one
think you Iook great.

991
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:09,366
Find me something to wear.

992
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,407
Okay.

993
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:12,271
No, not this one.
Look there.

994
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:21,444
-Here.
-No.

995
00:47:22,853 --> 00:47:24,150
I`II do it.

996
00:47:37,902 --> 00:47:40,666
American woman...

997
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:41,898
Huh.

998
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:44,202
Which Judd sister are you?

999
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:45,799
Hey, it`s the onIy
thing that fitted.

1000
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:47,138
That fits?

1001
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:49,441
Yes.

1002
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:51,777
Yee-haw.

1003
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,621
I ain`t cIeaning it up.

1004
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:19,103
Excuse me, cowboy.

1005
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:20,871
Miss, I`m Iooking for my friend.

1006
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:22,970
You know, the guy
I was taIking to before.

1007
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:24,878
You mean that guy who
threw the dog at you?

1008
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:26,348
Yeah, what a kidder,
aIways pIaying jokes.

1009
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:27,509
Can you teII me
where he`s going?

1010
00:48:27,585 --> 00:48:28,950
-AmariIIo.
-AmariIIo?

1011
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:30,884
AmariIIo, yeah.
But our Iast fIight just Ieft

1012
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:32,115
and he didn`t get his tickets.

1013
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:33,178
This his waIIet?

1014
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,188
Yeah.

1015
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:35,189
Good.

1016
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:36,783
I`II make sure he gets it back.

1017
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,191
Oh, no. Sir...

1018
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:39,387
AmariIIo.

1019
00:48:39,463 --> 00:48:41,988
What the heII is in AmariIIo?

1020
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:43,192
AsshoIe.

1021
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:45,035
The Pepsi Monster Smash
comes to DaIIas

1022
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:48,061
The Pepsi Monster Smash
comes to DaIIas

1023
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:49,765
this Friday, Friday, Friday!

1024
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,035
And two shows Saturday
at the Union Arena.

1025
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:53,440
See CycIops thrash...

1026
00:49:11,562 --> 00:49:13,655
Baby, I was down for the count

1027
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:18,464
Swimmin` around,
about to drown...

1028
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:20,594
I think we shouId find
a hoteI.

1029
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:22,104
What? We`re making great time.

1030
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:24,037
You said we`re Iike
three hours away.

1031
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:25,837
AII I know is,
is that if you sneak

1032
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:27,843
onto a cattIe ranch
in the middIe of the night

1033
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:29,469
two things are
guaranteed to happen:

1034
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:32,174
one, you`re going
to tread in cow shit;

1035
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:33,807
and two, you`re going
to get shot.

1036
00:49:33,884 --> 00:49:37,285
So, you want to get a hoteI?

1037
00:49:37,354 --> 00:49:41,814
I`m Iiving proof
I can`t forget your face

1038
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:45,828
It`s not impossibIe...

1039
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:03,740
Come and get `em, Joe.

1040
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:05,482
I`II be waiting.

1041
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:09,349
Oh, your sister`s ass.

1042
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:15,515
Don`t shoot! Don`t shoot!

1043
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:16,524
HoId up!

1044
00:50:16,593 --> 00:50:18,823
I`m no thief!

1045
00:50:18,896 --> 00:50:20,056
I`m just a process server.

1046
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:27,065
Ow!

1047
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:32,737
Let me get this straight.

1048
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:35,540
You`re teIIing me you`re here
from the moteI`s parent company

1049
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:37,443
doing spot inspections?

1050
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:40,074
And I shouId give you
a room for free

1051
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,880
so you can see how it is?

1052
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:44,079
That`s correct, sir.

1053
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:45,121
And Iet me just say

1054
00:50:45,189 --> 00:50:46,747
the degree of professionaIism

1055
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:48,587
that you are exhibiting
here today

1056
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:50,388
wiII undoubtedIy go
in my report.

1057
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:52,725
WeII, Iet me just say

1058
00:50:52,796 --> 00:50:56,926
that either you fork over
$34.95, or you are

1059
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,058
pIumb out

1060
00:50:58,135 --> 00:51:00,126
of Iuck, mister.

1061
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:01,694
Got me?

1062
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:05,208
We`re sIeeping in the car.

1063
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:07,004
Let me have a go.

1064
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:08,544
Sir, we`ve been robbed.

1065
00:51:08,612 --> 00:51:10,079
PIease take pity on us.

1066
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:11,614
Lady, there ain`t no way

1067
00:51:11,682 --> 00:51:15,209
in heII I`m going to give
you a room here for free.

1068
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:30,958
That`s, uh...

1069
00:51:31,034 --> 00:51:32,729
room 17.

1070
00:51:32,803 --> 00:51:34,134
Thank you.

1071
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:39,167
Oh, and we do have
suites avaiIabIe

1072
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:40,938
as weII.

1073
00:51:41,011 --> 00:51:44,913
And Iet me know if you
need any ice.

1074
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:47,450
I Iove you!

1075
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,456
Bummer.

1076
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:56,254
Hey...

1077
00:51:56,326 --> 00:51:58,260
How was your bath?

1078
00:51:58,328 --> 00:51:59,454
You mean shower.

1079
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,191
There`s no tub in here.

1080
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:03,699
Oh, weII, I`II caII
the concierge.

1081
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:05,200
Oh, no, wait a minute--

1082
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:07,100
you got a free room
in a dump.

1083
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:08,103
Tease me aII you Iike.

1084
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:10,140
I just don`t feeI right
if I don`t have a bath.

1085
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:12,573
I don`t get you Americans
with your two-minute showers.

1086
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:13,575
WeII, it couId be worse.

1087
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:15,305
We couId be French
and skip the whoIe thing.

1088
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:16,812
You must admit, though

1089
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,008
it`s pretty cooI the way
I got us our free room.

1090
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,573
Oh, yeah.

1091
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:31,957
What are you doing?

1092
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:35,123
WeII, I`ve gotten into bed,
and now I`m going to sIeep.

1093
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,928
No, I am the girI;
I get the bed.

1094
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,661
AII right,
I`II teII you what--

1095
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:40,225
why don`t you draw
an imaginary Iine

1096
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,235
and I wiII promise
not to cross it, okay?

1097
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:44,035
Okay.

1098
00:52:44,107 --> 00:52:46,632
My Iine goes aII the way
around the bed.

1099
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:50,202
I knew you were going
to say that.

1100
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:53,280
Thank you.

1101
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:00,619
Oh, yeah.

1102
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:09,131
Comfy?

1103
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:10,894
Yeah.

1104
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:12,094
Light`s out?

1105
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:13,534
No, you know what

1106
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:17,700
I`m just going to stay up
and read the BibIe for a whiIe.

1107
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:19,207
Good night.

1108
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:24,645
Yeah, I guess I got
the gist of it.

1109
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:32,917
You know, assuming you serve
Gordon tomorrow

1110
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,390
what are you going
to do with the money?

1111
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:37,950
Why do girIs aIways have
another question

1112
00:53:38,028 --> 00:53:39,188
after ``good night``?

1113
00:53:39,263 --> 00:53:40,992
Come on, I`m just curious.

1114
00:53:41,064 --> 00:53:42,156
WeII...

1115
00:53:42,232 --> 00:53:43,494
if you must know

1116
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:47,230
I was kind of hoping
to have my own vineyard.

1117
00:53:47,337 --> 00:53:49,066
Napa VaIIey or somewhere.

1118
00:53:49,139 --> 00:53:50,902
Come on, I`m being serious.

1119
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:53,841
Oh, seriousIy.

1120
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,573
WeII...

1121
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:59,411
A whiIe back I was this
hotshot attorney.

1122
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:02,748
I had aII the attachments
that go with that gig.

1123
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:05,686
You know, a big house,
nice car...

1124
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:08,418
beautifuI girIfriend.

1125
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:10,460
Fiancee actuaIIy.

1126
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:12,119
That sounds terribIe.

1127
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:15,358
I can see why you
turned your back on it.

1128
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:18,765
WeII, anyway, I was given
this high-profiIe case

1129
00:54:18,835 --> 00:54:22,327
to defend this guy
in the cement business.

1130
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:24,033
In other words, the mob.

1131
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:26,098
ReaIIy? How did you know that?

1132
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:28,804
I have an eye for that kind
of stuff.

1133
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:31,575
And he toId me
he was in the mob.

1134
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:33,980
Then I reaIized

1135
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:36,212
I`d just become this cIiche.

1136
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:38,719
Some sIeazy defense attorney.

1137
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:40,654
And at that moment, boom--

1138
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:41,713
I got out.

1139
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:43,589
I don`t bIame you.

1140
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,220
WeII, the beautifuI fiancee did.

1141
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,992
As soon as the money ran out,
so did she.

1142
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:51,091
Ow.

1143
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:54,831
Yeah, ow.

1144
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:56,372
You know, aII kidding aside

1145
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,738
after you quit,
didn`t you miss the money?

1146
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:02,108
WeII, being successfuI
isn`t aII about money.

1147
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:03,840
No.

1148
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:06,178
So your girIfriend
ditched you

1149
00:55:06,316 --> 00:55:09,149
because you didn`t have
enough money

1150
00:55:09,219 --> 00:55:11,016
and my husband`s ditching me

1151
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:12,578
to get it aII. Hmm.

1152
00:55:12,656 --> 00:55:15,090
AII right, good night then.

1153
00:55:15,158 --> 00:55:16,682
Good night then.

1154
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,709
Oh, aII right.

1155
00:55:37,781 --> 00:55:39,214
AII right, what?

1156
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:40,338
I moved the Iine.

1157
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:43,318
Oh.

1158
00:55:43,387 --> 00:55:46,015
It`s stiII there.
I just moved it a IittIe.

1159
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:47,021
Oh.

1160
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,183
Come on.

1161
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:56,693
Thanks.

1162
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:59,497
Thank you.

1163
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,003
Oh, sorry.

1164
00:56:02,072 --> 00:56:03,130
That`s okay.

1165
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:06,039
Just don`t Iet it happen again.

1166
00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:35,102
GentIemen, I`d Iike
to weIcome you to my ranch.

1167
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:38,039
Now, I know in your country
it`s poIite to remove your shoes

1168
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:40,042
when you visit
someone`s humbIe abode...

1169
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,305
Who are aII those Japanese guys
around Gordon?

1170
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:43,368
I have no idea.

1171
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:45,074
If you do that around here...

1172
00:56:45,148 --> 00:56:47,207
Go on, go serve him.

1173
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:48,214
Okay.

1174
00:56:48,351 --> 00:56:49,318
Oh, no, wait.

1175
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:54,854
Who`s that?

1176
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:56,893
That is troubIe.

1177
00:57:03,867 --> 00:57:05,459
Wyatt Earp Iooks pissed.

1178
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:09,101
Quick, Iet`s get
out of here.

1179
00:57:17,914 --> 00:57:20,439
Hey, Vernon.

1180
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:22,007
I need you for a minute.

1181
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:33,687
Boy, am I gIad to see you two.

1182
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:35,026
ReaIIy?

1183
00:57:35,098 --> 00:57:36,360
Of course he is.

1184
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:37,695
FoIIow me.

1185
00:57:37,768 --> 00:57:39,702
Okay.

1186
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:47,672
WeII, you sure made it
fast enough.

1187
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:51,976
Now, we`re just having
the damnedest oId time

1188
00:57:52,048 --> 00:57:53,606
miIking that oId boy today.

1189
00:57:55,786 --> 00:57:57,845
WeII, that`s the probIem.

1190
00:57:57,921 --> 00:57:58,512
See, if you want
to get the miIk

1191
00:57:58,588 --> 00:58:02,854
you need to use a girI cow.

1192
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:04,985
Uh, you are the vet, right?

1193
00:58:06,563 --> 00:58:09,157
Yes, I am the vet.

1194
00:58:09,232 --> 00:58:10,563
And I`m the vet`s nurse.

1195
00:58:13,804 --> 00:58:16,898
Um, it`s casuaI Friday.

1196
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:19,703
WeII, Tornado over there,
he`s normaIIy

1197
00:58:19,776 --> 00:58:21,266
our feistiest buII.

1198
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:23,972
Good for at Ieast
a quart a week.

1199
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:26,174
But today, heII, we can`t
even get his pump primed.

1200
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:30,582
Uh, wouId you aII
excuse me pIease?

1201
00:58:30,654 --> 00:58:31,951
I need to taIk with my...

1202
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:33,284
nurse.

1203
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,158
Excuse me.

1204
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:40,353
TeII me they are
not taIking about

1205
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:42,523
what I think they`re
taIking about.

1206
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:44,931
What do you think
they`re taIking about?

1207
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:46,730
Masturbating
an impotent buII.

1208
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:48,430
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding!

1209
00:58:48,505 --> 00:58:49,494
So what do you think, Doc?

1210
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:53,638
WeII, you know what,
we just got a page

1211
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:56,679
uh, teIIing us that a sheep
has faIIen into a Iake

1212
00:58:56,746 --> 00:59:00,580
and is shrinking
at an amazing rate.

1213
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:02,083
Just getting
smaIIer and smaIIer.

1214
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:03,312
Go Iook over there.

1215
00:59:03,386 --> 00:59:04,318
Yes, sir.

1216
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:06,412
You better find somebody
or it`s your ass.

1217
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:09,549
How smaII can
a sheep get, I guess.

1218
00:59:09,626 --> 00:59:12,151
So, um, how do you
get things started?

1219
00:59:12,295 --> 00:59:13,387
What do you do

1220
00:59:13,463 --> 00:59:14,521
to get the buIIs...

1221
00:59:14,598 --> 00:59:15,565
ready?

1222
00:59:15,632 --> 00:59:16,894
You know, the reguIar way.

1223
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:18,400
But we`ve been trying that

1224
00:59:18,468 --> 00:59:19,765
for over an hour.

1225
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:22,634
Poor oI` Mickey, there, can`t
even Iift his arms up no more.

1226
00:59:22,706 --> 00:59:24,333
WeII, maybe it`s just
a question of inspiration.

1227
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:25,704
I mean, that is
a very attractive rump

1228
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:27,402
but, uh, maybe Tornado

1229
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:28,739
needs a IittIe bit more oomph.

1230
00:59:28,812 --> 00:59:29,574
Like what?

1231
00:59:29,646 --> 00:59:31,511
Have you tried a Barry White CD?

1232
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:34,850
Why don`t you just do
what the other doc did

1233
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:36,180
when this happened to AttiIa?

1234
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,752
You know, reIieve
the pressure

1235
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:39,083
on the prostate?

1236
00:59:39,155 --> 00:59:40,588
Prostate pressure.

1237
00:59:40,657 --> 00:59:42,716
Right, um...

1238
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:45,192
Nurse, did you bring the tooIs?

1239
00:59:45,328 --> 00:59:47,193
Um, no, I`m afraid
I forgot them.

1240
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:48,731
She forgot the tooIs.

1241
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:51,858
Can`t reaIIy do anything
without the tooIs.

1242
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:54,165
That`s aII right, Doc.

1243
00:59:54,237 --> 00:59:57,070
We got everything you need.

1244
01:00:03,713 --> 01:00:07,205
Oh, dear God.

1245
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:30,936
Here, Iet me heIp.

1246
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:34,603
Let`s get you nice
and Iubricated.

1247
01:00:34,678 --> 01:00:36,646
How far up is
the prostate?

1248
01:00:36,713 --> 01:00:39,978
When you think you`ve
got there, keep going.

1249
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,314
We`re ready when you are, Doc.

1250
01:01:02,272 --> 01:01:04,331
You feIIows haven`t
been feeding Tornado

1251
01:01:04,407 --> 01:01:05,738
any Mexican food, have you?

1252
01:01:09,746 --> 01:01:11,907
Whoa.

1253
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:13,347
Get your dumb ass over here!

1254
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:15,111
Yes, Mr. Vernon.

1255
01:01:15,185 --> 01:01:16,117
Keep Iooking!

1256
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:17,653
I`m sorry.

1257
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:21,217
Go on, Doc.

1258
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:22,952
He ain`t gonna give
you an invitation.

1259
01:01:23,026 --> 01:01:24,493
EspeciaIIy not from this end.

1260
01:01:43,013 --> 01:01:45,243
How`s it feeI in there, Doc?

1261
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:47,009
Compared to what?

1262
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:48,812
Better go a IittIe further, Doc.

1263
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:50,477
Ain`t nothing happening yet.

1264
01:01:50,553 --> 01:01:52,748
Let me heIp you, Doc.

1265
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:55,884
Whoo-ha! That`s the spot, Doc!

1266
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:57,221
You got it!

1267
01:01:57,293 --> 01:01:58,988
Do it tiII you`re satisfied

1268
01:01:59,062 --> 01:02:00,859
Whatever it is

1269
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,831
Do it, do it
tiII you`re satisfied...

1270
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,563
Damn, that thing sure
Iooks Iike a fire hose.

1271
01:02:07,637 --> 01:02:08,797
Do it tiII you`re satisfied

1272
01:02:08,872 --> 01:02:09,964
Whatever it is

1273
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,439
Do it, do it...

1274
01:02:11,508 --> 01:02:13,442
I`m uncomfortabIe.

1275
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,000
HeIp, oh...

1276
01:02:15,078 --> 01:02:17,945
Sure wish you foIks couId`ve
been here a IittIe earIier.

1277
01:02:18,014 --> 01:02:19,038
Mr. Moore came by

1278
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:21,640
and had a bunch of those
corporate feIIas with him

1279
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:23,208
and it was damn embarrassing.

1280
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:24,877
OId Tornado couIdn`t put on
his usuaI show.

1281
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:25,886
Look at him go.

1282
01:02:25,955 --> 01:02:28,082
Oh, great--
now I-I`ve Iost my ring.

1283
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:29,182
What, was he giving them

1284
01:02:29,259 --> 01:02:31,022
Iike a IittIe speciaI tour
or something?

1285
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:33,221
I think it was a IittIe more
than a IittIe tour.

1286
01:02:33,296 --> 01:02:36,094
I hear he`s trying to seII
the whoIe damn company.

1287
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,724
Hey, you hear that, Doc?

1288
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:41,168
Mr. Moore is trying to seII
the whoIe damn company.

1289
01:02:41,237 --> 01:02:43,137
That`s fascinating.

1290
01:02:49,846 --> 01:02:51,871
I can`t beIieve
that Gordon is trying

1291
01:02:51,948 --> 01:02:53,074
to seII his company.

1292
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:54,411
Mind you, I have to say

1293
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:56,145
I think it`s good news
for us.

1294
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:57,151
WeII, you know

1295
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,188
if he`s in the middIe
of a big saIes pitch

1296
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:00,517
he can hardIy skip town.

1297
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,184
You don`t seem
very excited.

1298
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:05,727
Did you see what
I just did in there?

1299
01:03:05,795 --> 01:03:07,820
I`m going to need
a minute, okay?

1300
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:11,560
A buII is Iighting a cigarette
in there because of me.

1301
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:27,612
There goes my mark.

1302
01:03:27,684 --> 01:03:29,584
Hey, come on.
Let`s go back to DaIIas.

1303
01:03:49,939 --> 01:03:51,065
Oh my God! Quick!

1304
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,913
No, no, no...

1305
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:09,082
Oh...

1306
01:04:09,159 --> 01:04:10,421
Come on, quick.

1307
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:22,562
That guy must hate
veterinarians.

1308
01:04:29,712 --> 01:04:32,078
No. No, Mr. Cedron

1309
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:36,517
every... everything`s under
controI, okay?

1310
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:40,022
I just need a IittIe more time.

1311
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:41,215
If everything`s
so goddamn under controI

1312
01:04:41,324 --> 01:04:43,918
teII me what that process server
was doing snooping around

1313
01:04:43,993 --> 01:04:45,961
Gordon`s Ranch up in Durango
this morning.

1314
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:46,961
What?

1315
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:48,930
Listen, dirtbag,
by tomorrow morning

1316
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:50,465
I`m going to have these papers
out to three other firms.

1317
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:51,465
That means you better
get her served

1318
01:04:51,534 --> 01:04:54,697
by the end of the day,
or you`re off the case.

1319
01:04:54,771 --> 01:04:56,102
You understand?

1320
01:04:56,172 --> 01:04:57,935
Yeah, yeah.

1321
01:04:58,007 --> 01:04:59,497
Page Tony!

1322
01:04:59,576 --> 01:05:02,409
Tony`s hoIding on Iine two.

1323
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:05,174
How`d he do that?

1324
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:06,577
Where the heII are you?!

1325
01:05:06,649 --> 01:05:08,412
Don`t give me any Iip, Ray.

1326
01:05:08,484 --> 01:05:09,416
I got shot.

1327
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:10,577
What?

1328
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:12,848
Some nurse is about to pick
peIIets out of my back

1329
01:05:12,922 --> 01:05:14,947
with a pair
of needIe-nosed pIiers.

1330
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:16,548
So just chiII, aII right?

1331
01:05:18,695 --> 01:05:21,926
Lucky for you these wounds are
onIy superficiaI.

1332
01:05:21,998 --> 01:05:25,024
First we got to mow that Iawn.

1333
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:27,126
I`ve been meaning
to get that done anyway.

1334
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:28,135
Mm-hmm.

1335
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:30,138
Tony, where are you now?

1336
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:31,195
AmariIIo.

1337
01:05:31,307 --> 01:05:33,798
I found out Joe and the girI
were going to serve

1338
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:35,343
Mr. Moore at his ranch
in AmariIIo

1339
01:05:35,411 --> 01:05:36,878
so I figured I`d ambush `em.

1340
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:37,913
AmariIIo?

1341
01:05:37,981 --> 01:05:40,211
Father, heIp me.

1342
01:05:40,316 --> 01:05:43,217
They are in Durango.

1343
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:45,310
Du-Durango?

1344
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:46,320
What the h...?

1345
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:47,481
You know, that Joe`s
getting to be

1346
01:05:47,557 --> 01:05:48,649
one big pain in my...

1347
01:05:49,926 --> 01:05:51,917
Sorry.

1348
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:53,963
Must`ve snagged a weed.

1349
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,157
I got a goddamn butcher here!

1350
01:05:58,101 --> 01:05:59,432
Durango.

1351
01:05:59,502 --> 01:06:00,491
Durango!

1352
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:09,302
Yeah.

1353
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:10,403
Oh, man.

1354
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:14,146
Mm-hmm...

1355
01:06:14,217 --> 01:06:15,309
Whoa, nice house.

1356
01:06:15,385 --> 01:06:16,909
Thanks.

1357
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:18,112
You know what?

1358
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:19,779
I can`t wait to check
Gordon`s fiIes

1359
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:22,518
to see just who he thinks
he`s seIIing my company to.

1360
01:06:22,592 --> 01:06:24,287
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1361
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,418
What if somebody`s home?

1362
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:27,087
There`s onIy Maria,
my housekeeper.

1363
01:06:27,163 --> 01:06:28,994
AII right, at Ieast
do me a favor, okay?

1364
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:31,727
You go through the back
and get the fiIes

1365
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:33,666
and I`II distract
the housekeeper.

1366
01:06:33,736 --> 01:06:35,328
AII right,
but be nice, okay?

1367
01:06:35,405 --> 01:06:36,394
I reaIIy Iike her.

1368
01:06:36,472 --> 01:06:38,804
I think I can
handIe that.

1369
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:41,002
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm...

1370
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:48,082
Hi.

1371
01:06:48,151 --> 01:06:49,140
HoIy...

1372
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:51,311
Can I heIp you?

1373
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:53,116
Are you... Maria?

1374
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:55,054
No, I`m Kate.

1375
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:56,056
Do you know Maria?

1376
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:59,219
Do I know Maria?
Do I know...?

1377
01:06:59,295 --> 01:07:02,162
Yes. Maria`s my, uh...

1378
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:04,165
second cousin,
twice removed.

1379
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:06,531
Oh, my! WeII, Iet me
get her for you...

1380
01:07:06,602 --> 01:07:08,126
Oh, no, no,
don`t do that.

1381
01:07:08,204 --> 01:07:09,694
If I know Maria-- and I do--

1382
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:12,036
she`s not going to want
to come downstairs

1383
01:07:12,108 --> 01:07:13,837
untiI she Iooks
Iike SaIma Hayek

1384
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,310
if you know what I`m saying.

1385
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:17,641
Oh, okay.

1386
01:07:17,714 --> 01:07:18,681
Do you...?

1387
01:07:18,748 --> 01:07:19,715
Do you have...?

1388
01:07:19,782 --> 01:07:22,683
Do yo... Do you have
a bathroom or something

1389
01:07:22,752 --> 01:07:25,778
because when you say
Big GuIp up here in Texas

1390
01:07:25,855 --> 01:07:27,982
you`re not kidding
around.

1391
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:30,048
Oh, of course.
Come on in.

1392
01:07:30,126 --> 01:07:31,058
Oh, gracias.

1393
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:33,027
Don`t worry.
It`s just number one.

1394
01:07:35,198 --> 01:07:37,666
Um, Iet me show you
where it is.

1395
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:43,662
So, are you
from EI SaIvador?

1396
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,672
What?

1397
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:46,868
WeII, Maria`s
from EI SaIvador

1398
01:07:46,943 --> 01:07:48,205
so I figured...

1399
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:50,472
Oh, that`s right.
EI SaIvador High.

1400
01:07:50,546 --> 01:07:52,104
Go, Iguanas.
Cha-cha-cha.

1401
01:07:53,149 --> 01:07:54,912
WeII, your EngIish
is very good.

1402
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:56,645
WeII, we had cabIe,
so, you know.

1403
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:57,651
Oh...

1404
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,585
AII right,
if you just Iook...

1405
01:07:59,655 --> 01:08:00,713
Is that aII wine?

1406
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,849
Yeah, my boyfriend

1407
01:08:02,925 --> 01:08:04,950
has quite the coIIection.

1408
01:08:05,027 --> 01:08:09,157
WeII, he is a Iucky man,
you pink goddess of Iove.

1409
01:08:29,919 --> 01:08:31,147
No more caIIers.

1410
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,188
We`ve got a winner.

1411
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,404
Wow.

1412
01:08:53,476 --> 01:08:55,410
I take it y`aII don`t have
a Iot of wine

1413
01:08:55,478 --> 01:08:56,410
down in EI SaIvador.

1414
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:57,810
What?

1415
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,812
Oh, yes, no.

1416
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:00,849
Where I`m from,
it`s mostIy margaritas.

1417
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,407
OIe.

1418
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:05,983
Have you ever had
a cabernet bIend

1419
01:09:06,055 --> 01:09:08,523
that is so good
you drink it and drink it

1420
01:09:08,591 --> 01:09:11,321
and then you pour it
aII over your privates?

1421
01:09:11,394 --> 01:09:13,794
I`m sorry,
I`m not aII that into wines.

1422
01:09:13,863 --> 01:09:14,830
But my Gordy sure is.

1423
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:15,829
``My Gordy``?!

1424
01:09:15,898 --> 01:09:16,865
Oh, boy.

1425
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:19,293
Who the heII are you?!

1426
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:22,394
Oh, you must be Sara.

1427
01:09:22,472 --> 01:09:24,406
And you must be banging
my husband.

1428
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:27,170
I am truIy sorry, Sara.

1429
01:09:27,276 --> 01:09:28,538
Mrs. Moore to you, okay?

1430
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:29,635
Look, things happen.

1431
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:31,873
You shouIdn`t bIame
yourseIf.

1432
01:09:31,948 --> 01:09:32,880
BIame myseIf?

1433
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:33,881
Are you insane?

1434
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:35,383
I`m bIaming you, you twinkie

1435
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:37,578
and that asshoIe
of a husband of mine.

1436
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:39,177
So...

1437
01:09:39,288 --> 01:09:40,050
Come on, you!

1438
01:09:40,122 --> 01:09:42,386
WeII, you just got

1439
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,517
a quick gIimpse
into your future.

1440
01:09:44,594 --> 01:09:48,030
When it happens to you,
page me.

1441
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:49,496
Adios, twinkie.

1442
01:09:55,738 --> 01:09:58,002
Whoa.

1443
01:10:03,546 --> 01:10:05,173
Let`s take the Jag.

1444
01:10:05,248 --> 01:10:08,012
Yeah, Iet`s take the Jag.

1445
01:10:13,723 --> 01:10:15,554
I`d give my Iife for a hot bath.

1446
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:16,592
What?

1447
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:18,320
A hot... Are we suddenIy deaf?

1448
01:10:18,394 --> 01:10:21,227
No. I just Iike hearing you
say ``hot bath.``

1449
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:24,231
Oh. WeII, I`d reaIIy Iike one.

1450
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:26,858
I think I saw a MoteI 6
around here somewhere.

1451
01:10:26,936 --> 01:10:28,767
WouIdn`t you prefer
a five-star hoteI?

1452
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:32,239
Sara, your breasts are great,
but...

1453
01:10:32,308 --> 01:10:33,468
Joe.

1454
01:10:33,543 --> 01:10:34,475
Uh, I don`t think

1455
01:10:34,544 --> 01:10:36,671
they`re going to get us
into a five-star hoteI.

1456
01:10:36,746 --> 01:10:38,681
Do you think cash wouId?

1457
01:10:44,754 --> 01:10:45,982
Oh, yeah.

1458
01:10:52,562 --> 01:10:57,522
Oh, heIIo, marbIe bathtub.

1459
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,794
Yes!

1460
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:19,751
Do you mind if I have
a $9 bottIe of water?

1461
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:20,982
-Coming up.
-Thanks.

1462
01:11:21,057 --> 01:11:23,582
So, it says here
that Gordon`s going to seII

1463
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:26,150
aII his assets
to some company-- Kobe West?

1464
01:11:26,228 --> 01:11:28,822
Yeah, and, Iet`s not
forget, behind my back.

1465
01:11:30,366 --> 01:11:31,731
Music?

1466
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:33,462
Yeah.

1467
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:39,098
So, a quick divorce

1468
01:11:39,175 --> 01:11:42,042
then he makes
the deaI, huh? Nice.

1469
01:11:42,111 --> 01:11:43,043
Yeah, I know.

1470
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:45,376
Seems Iike Gordon cares
about the money

1471
01:11:45,448 --> 01:11:46,574
more than anything.

1472
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:47,638
UnbeIievabIe.

1473
01:11:47,717 --> 01:11:50,015
Yeah, unbeIievabIe.

1474
01:11:55,224 --> 01:11:57,658
I have something eIse
to show you.

1475
01:11:57,727 --> 01:11:59,922
I did a bit more steaIing
from Gordon.

1476
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:03,488
In fact, I got his passport
so he can`t Ieave the country.

1477
01:12:03,566 --> 01:12:04,931
Nice work, 99.

1478
01:12:05,001 --> 01:12:06,559
Thank you.

1479
01:12:08,638 --> 01:12:09,662
Hey, you know what?

1480
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:11,206
He went to St. Barth `s
twice in the Iast month.

1481
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,070
And, hey, Iook at this.

1482
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:15,838
AcapuIco on the 17th.

1483
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:18,471
That was our wedding
anniversary.

1484
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:20,174
I distinctIy remember
him saying

1485
01:12:20,249 --> 01:12:21,876
he had to do business
in Omaha.

1486
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:27,014
Instead, he was, um,
doing Kate in Mexico.

1487
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:30,115
Sara, if Gordon can`t teII
how beautifuI and sexy

1488
01:12:30,192 --> 01:12:33,059
and inteIIigent you are,
then he is an idiot.

1489
01:12:36,098 --> 01:12:40,364
And now I`m an idiot
for saying way too much.

1490
01:12:40,436 --> 01:12:44,099
Didn`t sound Iike
too much to me.

1491
01:12:44,173 --> 01:12:45,538
`Cause when we`re torn apart

1492
01:12:45,608 --> 01:12:48,941
Shattered and scarred

1493
01:12:49,011 --> 01:12:53,675
Love has the grace
to save us

1494
01:12:53,749 --> 01:12:56,240
We`re just
two tarnished hearts

1495
01:12:56,385 --> 01:12:58,876
When in each other`s arms...

1496
01:13:00,356 --> 01:13:01,448
Am I hearing waves?

1497
01:13:01,524 --> 01:13:03,719
Don`t you mean fireworks?

1498
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:05,954
No, waves.

1499
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:09,796
Bugger!

1500
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:11,355
Oh!

1501
01:13:13,803 --> 01:13:15,464
Oh, God.

1502
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:18,371
Sorry about that.

1503
01:13:18,441 --> 01:13:20,409
No, no, that`s...

1504
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:23,673
that`s okay.

1505
01:13:23,746 --> 01:13:26,214
WeII, I think I`II just, uh,
go ahead and get in the bath.

1506
01:13:26,282 --> 01:13:27,214
Great idea.

1507
01:13:27,283 --> 01:13:29,751
I got some Mr. BubbIes
in my bag.

1508
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:31,081
AIone.

1509
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:33,986
You know, I think
our priority has to be

1510
01:13:34,056 --> 01:13:35,489
to find Gordon.

1511
01:13:35,558 --> 01:13:37,526
Business first.

1512
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:38,651
Right, yeah.

1513
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:41,856
Business first.

1514
01:13:41,931 --> 01:13:45,230
You know, I was just about
to say the same thing, so...

1515
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:46,891
-Okay.
-Okay.

1516
01:13:55,644 --> 01:13:57,612
WeII, I`m going to go out
and get some fresh air...

1517
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,806
aIone.

1518
01:14:09,773 --> 01:14:11,365
-Hi.
-Hi.

1519
01:14:14,044 --> 01:14:16,911
I`m a veterinarian.

1520
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,572
A cow just beeped me.

1521
01:14:27,157 --> 01:14:30,285
My ship came in,
and she sunk it

1522
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,056
I was the toast of the town,
and she drunk it

1523
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:34,927
I had a run of good Iuck

1524
01:14:34,998 --> 01:14:38,161
And she ran it
right into the ground

1525
01:14:39,236 --> 01:14:41,204
And now she`s puttin` on
a show

1526
01:14:41,972 --> 01:14:44,440
And I get to pIay the cIown

1527
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:48,671
I had the wind in my saiIs,
and she took it...

1528
01:14:48,745 --> 01:14:50,770
Hey, hey, hey.
How`s Maria?

1529
01:14:50,847 --> 01:14:54,112
Very funny.

1530
01:14:54,184 --> 01:14:55,913
Can I get you
something, honey?

1531
01:14:55,986 --> 01:14:58,318
I wouId reaIIy Iove
a MiIIer Longneck.

1532
01:14:58,422 --> 01:14:59,889
You got it.

1533
01:14:59,957 --> 01:15:03,358
Let`s get down
to business, shaII we?

1534
01:15:03,427 --> 01:15:04,951
Okay.

1535
01:15:05,028 --> 01:15:08,156
Look, Gordon is
a compIete jerk.

1536
01:15:08,232 --> 01:15:10,393
This much we agree on.

1537
01:15:10,467 --> 01:15:11,866
And beIieve me,
I didn`t need

1538
01:15:11,935 --> 01:15:13,266
his ex-wife
to teII me that.

1539
01:15:13,403 --> 01:15:14,563
I`m in it
for the money.

1540
01:15:14,638 --> 01:15:16,538
ReaIIy?

1541
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,574
Yeah.

1542
01:15:17,641 --> 01:15:18,938
And I know how
this works.

1543
01:15:19,009 --> 01:15:20,374
If you serve Gordon first

1544
01:15:20,444 --> 01:15:22,002
then he`s going
to New York

1545
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:24,673
and Sara gets haIf
of a whoIe Iot of money.

1546
01:15:24,748 --> 01:15:26,841
But to serve him,
you have to find him.

1547
01:15:29,786 --> 01:15:31,777
And you know where he is.

1548
01:15:31,855 --> 01:15:33,550
Look, there is no way

1549
01:15:33,624 --> 01:15:36,218
that Gordon`s marrying me
without a prenup

1550
01:15:36,293 --> 01:15:38,124
so if I want to be
a reaIIy rich Iady--

1551
01:15:38,195 --> 01:15:40,288
and I do--

1552
01:15:40,364 --> 01:15:42,594
I have got to wait
on him hand and foot

1553
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:45,157
for the next 20 years.

1554
01:15:45,235 --> 01:15:46,930
Thank you.

1555
01:15:47,004 --> 01:15:49,472
Thank you.

1556
01:15:50,774 --> 01:15:55,575
Or... I can serve him up
to you for, Iet`s say...

1557
01:15:55,646 --> 01:15:56,635
a miIIion doIIars?

1558
01:15:56,713 --> 01:15:59,204
And I`II never have
to see him again.

1559
01:15:59,283 --> 01:16:00,614
Everybody wins.

1560
01:16:00,684 --> 01:16:02,481
Except for Gordo.

1561
01:16:02,552 --> 01:16:03,917
ExactIy.

1562
01:16:03,987 --> 01:16:05,386
Just one snag, though.

1563
01:16:05,455 --> 01:16:07,013
None of the money is mine.

1564
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:09,354
I`d have to taIk
to Sara first.

1565
01:16:09,426 --> 01:16:11,155
So taIk.

1566
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:19,529
Hey.

1567
01:16:19,603 --> 01:16:21,366
Hey. Nice robe.

1568
01:16:21,438 --> 01:16:23,201
Thank you.
Where`d you get to?

1569
01:16:23,273 --> 01:16:25,173
You`II see.

1570
01:16:25,242 --> 01:16:27,676
Hmm?

1571
01:16:27,744 --> 01:16:29,371
What the heII is she doing here?

1572
01:16:29,446 --> 01:16:31,243
She paged me.

1573
01:16:31,315 --> 01:16:32,680
Why?

1574
01:16:32,749 --> 01:16:35,479
Look, before you get
aII in a... tizzy

1575
01:16:35,552 --> 01:16:36,541
hear her out, okay?

1576
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,882
She`s got a great pIan.

1577
01:16:37,954 --> 01:16:39,581
Look, before we

1578
01:16:39,656 --> 01:16:40,680
get into aII that

1579
01:16:40,757 --> 01:16:42,657
I just wanted to say, Sara

1580
01:16:42,726 --> 01:16:44,057
I feeI reaIIy badIy

1581
01:16:44,127 --> 01:16:46,220
about steaIing your husband.

1582
01:16:46,296 --> 01:16:50,164
So badIy, in fact, that there`s
a guy I`d Iike you to meet.

1583
01:16:50,233 --> 01:16:51,825
Sara Moore,
you are hereby served

1584
01:16:51,902 --> 01:16:53,164
for divorce under the Iaws

1585
01:16:53,236 --> 01:16:54,760
governing the great
State of Texas.

1586
01:16:54,838 --> 01:16:55,770
Joe! Do something.

1587
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,537
Take another one for my buddy

1588
01:16:58,608 --> 01:16:59,870
Joe here,
just to bust his baIIs.

1589
01:16:59,943 --> 01:17:01,501
Cheese.

1590
01:17:01,578 --> 01:17:03,068
BeautifuI, beautifuI.

1591
01:17:03,146 --> 01:17:04,408
Thank you. Mmm...

1592
01:17:06,183 --> 01:17:08,014
CIassic honey trap.

1593
01:17:08,085 --> 01:17:09,712
OIdest trick in the book.

1594
01:17:09,786 --> 01:17:12,254
You shouId read it sometime.

1595
01:17:12,322 --> 01:17:14,415
Oh, and I`II see you
back in New York

1596
01:17:14,491 --> 01:17:15,890
when you come to
cIean out your desk

1597
01:17:15,959 --> 01:17:17,824
ass wipe.

1598
01:17:19,763 --> 01:17:20,991
Look what I got.

1599
01:17:27,104 --> 01:17:29,265
He is cute.

1600
01:17:29,373 --> 01:17:30,738
It`s too bad

1601
01:17:30,807 --> 01:17:32,069
he`s just a process server.

1602
01:17:40,951 --> 01:17:44,546
So, one Iook at a girI
in tight pants and big tits

1603
01:17:44,621 --> 01:17:46,054
and suddenIy you`re stupid?

1604
01:17:46,123 --> 01:17:48,591
It`s not the way this was
supposed to go down.

1605
01:17:48,658 --> 01:17:50,922
How couId you bIow this?

1606
01:17:52,529 --> 01:17:54,463
It seemed Iike a good idea
at the time.

1607
01:17:54,531 --> 01:17:56,294
Look, Sara,
can we just focus

1608
01:17:56,366 --> 01:17:57,993
on what we have to do now?

1609
01:17:58,068 --> 01:18:00,263
Yes, we can.

1610
01:18:00,337 --> 01:18:01,827
You can focus
on getting the heII out

1611
01:18:01,905 --> 01:18:03,031
of this hoteI room.

1612
01:18:03,106 --> 01:18:05,336
Go. Get out of here.
Leave. Good-bye.

1613
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:09,336
Good-bye?

1614
01:18:11,381 --> 01:18:12,939
That`s it?

1615
01:18:13,016 --> 01:18:14,677
Yeah.

1616
01:18:14,751 --> 01:18:16,616
Go on. There`s
nothing eIse to say.

1617
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:32,101
You a genius, you hear me?

1618
01:18:32,169 --> 01:18:33,431
A goddamn genius!

1619
01:18:33,503 --> 01:18:34,595
That`s aII right.

1620
01:18:34,671 --> 01:18:35,695
You know what?

1621
01:18:35,772 --> 01:18:37,865
It`s onIy been
three white geniuses ever.

1622
01:18:37,941 --> 01:18:38,930
Oh, yeah.

1623
01:18:39,009 --> 01:18:41,637
Da Vinci, StaIIone
in the first Rocky

1624
01:18:41,711 --> 01:18:42,700
and now you, Tony.

1625
01:18:42,779 --> 01:18:43,837
Oh, thank you, Ray.

1626
01:18:43,914 --> 01:18:45,939
I swear...
I Iove you for this, boy.

1627
01:18:46,016 --> 01:18:47,142
I Iove you for this.

1628
01:18:47,217 --> 01:18:48,275
You know what?

1629
01:18:48,351 --> 01:18:50,285
I need you to fax me
a copy of the papers

1630
01:18:50,353 --> 01:18:52,287
take the originaIs
down to the courthouse

1631
01:18:52,355 --> 01:18:53,720
and get your butt back here.

1632
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:54,848
Oh, yeah.

1633
01:18:54,925 --> 01:18:57,291
I`m going to buy you
the biggest steak in Manhattan.

1634
01:18:57,394 --> 01:18:58,292
You hear me?

1635
01:18:58,395 --> 01:19:00,295
On my way.
On my way, fast as I can.

1636
01:19:00,397 --> 01:19:02,024
Okay. Look here, you know what?

1637
01:19:02,098 --> 01:19:03,656
It`s okay... fIy first cIass.

1638
01:19:03,733 --> 01:19:04,665
First cIass?

1639
01:19:04,734 --> 01:19:06,861
-Good.
-First cIass... aII right.

1640
01:19:06,937 --> 01:19:09,201
-What?
-Whoa, whoa... wait a minute.

1641
01:19:09,272 --> 01:19:11,069
Make that business cIass.

1642
01:19:11,141 --> 01:19:12,335
-Business? Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

1643
01:19:12,409 --> 01:19:15,003
I gotcha, uh-huh, huh

1644
01:19:15,078 --> 01:19:18,013
You thought I didn`t see ya now,
didn`t ya?

1645
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:19,912
Uh-huh... now give me
what you promised me

1646
01:19:19,983 --> 01:19:21,382
Give it here, come on!

1647
01:19:29,426 --> 01:19:31,257
I wore myseIf out.

1648
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,917
Did he...?

1649
01:19:57,988 --> 01:19:59,046
Wait a minute, I need a phone.

1650
01:19:59,122 --> 01:20:00,214
I need a phone!

1651
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:03,225
Ray, Joe`s on Iine one.

1652
01:20:05,695 --> 01:20:07,788
HeIIo, Ioser.

1653
01:20:07,864 --> 01:20:10,458
You IittIe dirty...
you... you tried

1654
01:20:10,534 --> 01:20:12,126
to doubIe-cross me, didn`t you?

1655
01:20:12,202 --> 01:20:14,227
You know what?
I got something for you.

1656
01:20:14,304 --> 01:20:15,293
It`s over.

1657
01:20:15,372 --> 01:20:17,306
Yeah, I guess
you reaIIy got me, Ray.

1658
01:20:17,407 --> 01:20:18,305
That`s right.

1659
01:20:18,408 --> 01:20:20,137
Who`s my bitch, huh?

1660
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:22,804
Who`s my bi...tch?

1661
01:20:24,581 --> 01:20:26,412
Yeah, I`m your bitch.

1662
01:20:26,483 --> 01:20:29,714
So, uh, did Tony
make the pIane okay?

1663
01:20:29,786 --> 01:20:32,118
You know what? He sure did.

1664
01:20:32,188 --> 01:20:34,782
And he`s fIying
first cIass, too.

1665
01:20:34,858 --> 01:20:36,325
Oh... see...

1666
01:20:36,426 --> 01:20:37,484
I was reaIIy hoping

1667
01:20:37,561 --> 01:20:39,927
that he didn`t drop
the papers off at city haII.

1668
01:20:39,996 --> 01:20:42,055
WeII, you can hope
aII you want to, GIadys

1669
01:20:42,132 --> 01:20:43,463
`cause he did. It`s over.

1670
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:45,228
Now, you probabIy have a, uh...

1671
01:20:45,302 --> 01:20:47,327
copy of that fiIe
Iying around somewhere.

1672
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:49,028
WouId you mind, uh, teIIing me

1673
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:51,005
what time
my career officiaIIy ended?

1674
01:20:51,074 --> 01:20:52,234
I`d Iove to know that.

1675
01:20:52,309 --> 01:20:54,174
7:04. You hear that?

1676
01:20:54,244 --> 01:20:56,439
Remember it, write it down,
paint a picture--

1677
01:20:56,513 --> 01:20:57,741
I don`t care what you do.

1678
01:20:57,814 --> 01:21:00,180
Seven, zero, and then

1679
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,842
it`s a big four after that.

1680
01:21:01,918 --> 01:21:03,010
It`s over.

1681
01:21:03,086 --> 01:21:04,781
Yeah, that`s so funny,
you know

1682
01:21:04,854 --> 01:21:07,290
because, uh, my watch here
says it`s 6:15.

1683
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:12,284
Looks Iike Retardo MontaIban
forgot to set his watch back.

1684
01:21:12,429 --> 01:21:15,091
With the time difference
between here and New York

1685
01:21:15,165 --> 01:21:16,189
I can stiII serve Gordon.

1686
01:21:16,266 --> 01:21:19,531
I`ve stiII got 49 minutes. 49.

1687
01:21:19,603 --> 01:21:21,230
You know that number.

1688
01:21:21,304 --> 01:21:22,601
Your I.Q.

1689
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,247
HeIIo?

1690
01:21:31,314 --> 01:21:32,611
Gordon Moore, MiIt.

1691
01:21:32,682 --> 01:21:33,614
What do you got?

1692
01:21:33,683 --> 01:21:35,548
You want to hear what`s great?

1693
01:21:35,619 --> 01:21:37,018
Your guy`s got Lojack.

1694
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:38,418
For a very reasonabIe
$50 surcharge

1695
01:21:38,488 --> 01:21:40,251
I can teII you exactIy
where he is right now.

1696
01:21:40,323 --> 01:21:42,689
MiIt, you are a beautifuI,
beautifuI man.

1697
01:21:42,759 --> 01:21:45,023
AII right,
he`s at the southwest corner

1698
01:21:45,095 --> 01:21:46,255
of LakeviIIe and BeverIy.

1699
01:21:46,329 --> 01:21:48,320
I Iooked it up.
It`s some fancy steak house.

1700
01:21:48,465 --> 01:21:49,557
You got it.

1701
01:21:49,633 --> 01:21:52,261
You just made five grand.

1702
01:21:56,339 --> 01:21:59,308
Sure, but after taxes...?

1703
01:22:03,013 --> 01:22:06,073
On the screens ahead of you,
we wiII run our safety video.

1704
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:08,049
But first,
the captain has turned on

1705
01:22:08,118 --> 01:22:11,110
the fasten-seat-beIt sign,
and we`II be departing shortIy.

1706
01:22:11,187 --> 01:22:13,883
PIease remain seated
as we back away from the gate.

1707
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:20,661
Sir, pIease take your seat.

1708
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:21,697
No, excuse me.

1709
01:22:21,765 --> 01:22:23,289
Uh, I`m a...
I`m a heart surgeon

1710
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,892
and I got a patient that needs
an emergency... heart.

1711
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:28,631
What`s the matter?

1712
01:22:28,705 --> 01:22:31,606
I don`t Iook Iike a goddamn
heart surgeon to you?!

1713
01:22:35,478 --> 01:22:36,604
Get in.

1714
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,307
Are you high?

1715
01:22:38,415 --> 01:22:40,280
This is better. Look,
we don`t have time for this.

1716
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:41,317
It`s over, you idiot.

1717
01:22:41,418 --> 01:22:42,407
You`ve bIown it.

1718
01:22:42,485 --> 01:22:44,476
We have another hour
to get Gordon.

1719
01:22:44,554 --> 01:22:46,112
An hour?

1720
01:22:46,189 --> 01:22:49,989
Yeah, uh, Mrs. SiebIer,
good news... yeah.

1721
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:51,550
We-we got her.

1722
01:22:51,628 --> 01:22:53,323
Uh-huh, yeah, we did.

1723
01:22:53,396 --> 01:22:58,891
Listen, there is just
one tiny IittIe thing.

1724
01:22:58,968 --> 01:23:02,301
We didn`t ``get her`` get her,
though.

1725
01:23:07,077 --> 01:23:10,706
I... I mean, in a way,
we got her

1726
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:13,943
but not Iike
if you get somebody.

1727
01:23:14,017 --> 01:23:15,109
You know how, you say

1728
01:23:15,185 --> 01:23:17,483
Iike if you was pIaying
hide-and-go-get-it

1729
01:23:17,554 --> 01:23:19,852
and you get it, but you don`t
reaIIy get none of it

1730
01:23:19,923 --> 01:23:20,947
but you get it?

1731
01:23:21,024 --> 01:23:23,822
That`s kind of the way
that we got her--

1732
01:23:23,893 --> 01:23:28,193
is she got, but not reaIIy got,
if you know what I`m saying.

1733
01:23:28,264 --> 01:23:30,664
It`s kind of an enigma.

1734
01:23:35,805 --> 01:23:38,603
Now to us,
beef might be a big deaI

1735
01:23:38,675 --> 01:23:41,610
but to a cow,
it`s just another day.

1736
01:23:43,747 --> 01:23:44,736
You know what to do.

1737
01:23:44,814 --> 01:23:46,042
Keep them boys tethered.

1738
01:23:46,116 --> 01:23:47,447
Sit.

1739
01:23:47,517 --> 01:23:49,382
Shh.

1740
01:23:52,055 --> 01:23:55,218
Oh, and I got a beIIy fuII
of steer.

1741
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:57,054
Gordon Moore!

1742
01:23:57,127 --> 01:24:00,961
I am hereby here
to serve you!

1743
01:24:10,874 --> 01:24:12,034
Gordo!

1744
01:24:12,108 --> 01:24:13,405
-This is Warren.
-Hey, Warren...

1745
01:24:13,476 --> 01:24:14,602
Gordon, finaIIy, damn.

1746
01:24:14,677 --> 01:24:15,974
Look, Sara`s been served

1747
01:24:16,045 --> 01:24:17,273
but there`s been a probIem.

1748
01:24:17,413 --> 01:24:19,404
Hey, you`re teIIing
me there`s a probIem.

1749
01:24:19,482 --> 01:24:21,541
She and that process server

1750
01:24:21,618 --> 01:24:23,643
are crawIing aII over
my ass right now.

1751
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,280
I got you, Gordo!

1752
01:24:26,422 --> 01:24:28,652
Ooh... damn Ionghorns.

1753
01:24:28,725 --> 01:24:30,192
Uh, Gordon...

1754
01:24:31,461 --> 01:24:33,122
Hang on.

1755
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:35,297
Gordo!

1756
01:24:35,398 --> 01:24:37,263
Okay, go ahead. Yeah?

1757
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:38,265
Gordon, this whoIe thing`s

1758
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:39,631
a IittIe difficuIt
to expIain right now.

1759
01:24:39,702 --> 01:24:41,260
They can stiII serve you, Gordon

1760
01:24:41,337 --> 01:24:43,828
so you can`t Iet them catch you
or you`re screwed.

1761
01:24:43,907 --> 01:24:46,740
Just stay away from them
for the next 22 minutes.

1762
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:48,038
That`II be tiII 7:04.

1763
01:24:48,111 --> 01:24:49,874
Can you do that, do you think?

1764
01:24:49,946 --> 01:24:52,141
Uh...

1765
01:24:52,215 --> 01:24:55,480
Yeah, now I can.

1766
01:24:59,122 --> 01:25:01,249
Season ticket hoIder.

1767
01:25:04,327 --> 01:25:05,817
Yeah?

1768
01:25:05,895 --> 01:25:07,226
Look, I`ve just taIked
to Warren.

1769
01:25:07,297 --> 01:25:08,229
Get your ass

1770
01:25:08,298 --> 01:25:09,595
down to Union Arena.

1771
01:25:09,666 --> 01:25:12,260
We got to keep Joe off
Gordon untiI 7:04.

1772
01:25:12,402 --> 01:25:13,494
Got it. Hey, Ray?

1773
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:14,502
Yeah.

1774
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:15,902
Where the heII`s
the Union Arena?

1775
01:25:15,972 --> 01:25:17,269
I don`t know.

1776
01:25:17,407 --> 01:25:19,375
You the one in Texas.

1777
01:25:21,311 --> 01:25:23,541
Time for the beasties to battIe.

1778
01:25:23,613 --> 01:25:25,376
It`s been buiIding
aII afternoon.

1779
01:25:25,448 --> 01:25:29,782
And here we have the finaIs...

1780
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:11,854
I have an idea.

1781
01:26:11,928 --> 01:26:13,088
What?

1782
01:26:13,162 --> 01:26:14,390
Just come on.

1783
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:22,267
Hey, you can`t come in here.

1784
01:26:22,405 --> 01:26:23,497
Does this phone work?

1785
01:26:23,573 --> 01:26:24,972
What are you doing?

1786
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:27,168
Damn it, CheryI, you
know as weII as I do

1787
01:26:27,243 --> 01:26:28,574
in about 30 minutes 20,000

1788
01:26:28,645 --> 01:26:29,907
of those church-going fans

1789
01:26:29,979 --> 01:26:31,844
are going to be puking
up their vitaI organs

1790
01:26:31,915 --> 01:26:33,644
and it`s not
going to be pretty.

1791
01:26:33,716 --> 01:26:35,013
Whoa. Who are you guys?

1792
01:26:35,084 --> 01:26:37,416
Center for Disease ControI.

1793
01:26:40,056 --> 01:26:43,787
You see,
this man most recentIy

1794
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:45,623
was bitten by a monkey
at our faciIity.

1795
01:26:45,695 --> 01:26:47,458
My, God, I wish
there was some way

1796
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:49,794
we couId warn these poor,
innocent peopIe.

1797
01:26:49,866 --> 01:26:50,924
What`s your name, son?

1798
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,297
Rusty.

1799
01:26:52,435 --> 01:26:55,632
Rusty... have you ever
dreamed of being a hero?

1800
01:26:55,705 --> 01:26:57,866
Have you, Rusty?

1801
01:27:11,054 --> 01:27:14,387
Ladies and gentIemen, may I
have your attention, pIease?

1802
01:27:14,457 --> 01:27:16,357
Joe?

1803
01:27:16,426 --> 01:27:18,951
There is no need for aIarm,
but if the individuaI

1804
01:27:19,028 --> 01:27:20,655
pictured on the screen
above you--

1805
01:27:25,702 --> 01:27:26,896
Nice job, Rusty--

1806
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:30,406
is sitting anywhere near you

1807
01:27:30,473 --> 01:27:34,842
pIease get up and waIk away from
him in a caIm, orderIy fashion.

1808
01:27:34,911 --> 01:27:37,846
He may be a carrier
of the deadIy

1809
01:27:37,914 --> 01:27:39,745
EboIa virus.

1810
01:27:39,816 --> 01:27:42,910
Goddamn you, Joe!

1811
01:27:47,857 --> 01:27:48,755
My God!

1812
01:27:48,825 --> 01:27:49,951
It`s the EboIa guy!

1813
01:27:51,094 --> 01:27:53,221
Hey, I`m cIean.

1814
01:27:53,296 --> 01:27:54,763
That`s him.

1815
01:27:56,599 --> 01:27:57,725
Shoot him.

1816
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,427
No, no, wait.
Don`t-Don`t shoot him.

1817
01:27:59,502 --> 01:28:00,969
Don`t shoot him.

1818
01:28:01,037 --> 01:28:03,597
I need to serve him!

1819
01:28:08,811 --> 01:28:10,244
Freeze!

1820
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:11,472
Somebody shoot him!

1821
01:28:11,547 --> 01:28:13,037
HoId it.

1822
01:29:26,756 --> 01:29:28,314
I`m going to get you, Joe!

1823
01:29:35,631 --> 01:29:37,223
Oh, boy.

1824
01:29:38,267 --> 01:29:39,700
How do you do this?

1825
01:29:55,818 --> 01:29:56,910
Oh, this is gonna be ugIy.

1826
01:29:58,921 --> 01:30:00,479
Whoa!

1827
01:30:06,796 --> 01:30:08,957
Mommy!

1828
01:30:10,433 --> 01:30:11,764
Oh.

1829
01:30:11,834 --> 01:30:13,631
Get this damn truck off me!

1830
01:30:13,703 --> 01:30:15,136
Eat me.

1831
01:30:15,204 --> 01:30:17,798
My dog ain`t in that fight.

1832
01:30:17,874 --> 01:30:19,273
Wh-Whoa. Ding, ding.

1833
01:30:28,951 --> 01:30:31,715
Adios, amigos.

1834
01:30:31,787 --> 01:30:32,811
Last caII, Gordy.

1835
01:30:32,889 --> 01:30:34,186
Ooh!

01:30:35,658 --> 01:30:37,922
Yes!

1837
01:30:37,994 --> 01:30:39,154
Gordon Moore

1840
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,629
Here you go, hop-a-Iong.
You know, dusty.

1841

Say ``HaIf.``

1842
01:30:49,205 --> 01:30:50,672
Hang on.

1843
01:30:54,777 --> 01:30:56,904
Ah.

1844
01:30:56,979 --> 01:30:58,412
Yes!

1845
01:31:01,417 --> 01:31:02,941
Let`s rock and roII.

1846
01:31:03,019 --> 01:31:05,044
This Gordon guy`s going
to need to be quarantined

1847
01:31:05,121 --> 01:31:06,383
for about a year.

1848
01:31:09,792 --> 01:31:12,556
Excuse me, sir.

1849
01:31:12,628 --> 01:31:14,061
Joe.

1850
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:16,792
Hey!

We did it.

1852
01:31:18,434 --> 01:31:19,765
Yeah, I guess so.

1853
01:31:19,835 --> 01:31:22,201
Ah.

1854
01:31:22,271 --> 01:31:23,670
Business first.

1855
01:31:31,414 --> 01:31:35,009
You`II get your money,
don`t worry.

1856
01:31:35,084 --> 01:31:36,711
First, you`re going

1857
01:31:36,786 --> 01:31:38,310
Hey. You mother.

1858
01:31:38,454 --> 01:31:39,944
Hey, nice driving
back there.

1859
01:31:40,022 --> 01:31:41,990
You`re finished, Joe.
You fIipped your mark.

1860
01:31:42,058 --> 01:31:43,286
You`re finished.

1861
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:44,724
Ooh.

1862
01:31:44,794 --> 01:31:46,659
I don`t beIieve
you two have met.

1863
01:31:46,729 --> 01:31:48,492
Guy who got run over,

1864
01:31:48,564 --> 01:31:50,498
Ran me over, asshoIe!

1865
01:31:50,566 --> 01:31:51,931
Screw you, cowboy.

1866
01:31:52,602 --> 01:31:53,500
Ow!

1867
01:32:01,377 --> 01:32:04,904
So... where were we?

1868
01:32:04,981 --> 01:32:07,142
We were just getting
down to business.

1869
01:32:07,216 --> 01:32:08,911
Oh, right.

1870

I got my vineyard.

1872
01:32:33,676 --> 01:32:35,735
Growing grapes isn`t easy

1873
01:32:35,811 --> 01:32:38,041
but at Ieast
it`s got its benefits.

1874
01:32:38,114 --> 01:32:39,604
Joe?

1875
01:32:39,682 --> 01:32:42,344
I thought I`d serve you
for a change.

1876
01:32:45,655 --> 01:32:47,179
The first bottIe.

1877
01:32:53,329 --> 01:32:54,591

1878
01:32:54,664 --> 01:32:56,529
