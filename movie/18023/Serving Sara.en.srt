{11104}{11126}serves seven papers.
{11128}{11156}It would have been eight
{11157}{11200}but I let Joe have|that one in Miami.
{11201}{11237}The only reason that is
{11238}{11273}is the mook can't take Miami.
{11274}{11308}It's too damn hot down there.
{11310}{11371}Miami's not a city. It's|a steam room with mosquitoes.

{12364}{12387}Hey, screw you, Joe.
{12389}{12433}I'm tired of you|calling me stupid.

{13005}{13057}seeing he's been so hot lately.
{13059}{13092}But now that we know
{13094}{13143}he can't read|a goddamn calendar
{13145}{13182}makes me a little edgy.
{13184}{13228}So... here.

{14067}{14134}All you gotta do is do it fast.

{26256}{26317}I think my eyes are going,|because I only see 20 bucks.
{26368}{26406}How about now?
{26408}{26466}Oh, there we go.
{26468}{26490}20-20.
{26492}{26517}20-20.
{26519}{26560}Come back at 7:00.
{26562}{26585}7:00?
{26587}{26637}That's the best you can do?
{26639}{26688}Oh, now my hearing's off.
{26690}{26760}I'll see you at 7:00.
{27077}{27119}Miami Marriott.
{27120}{27194}Uh, yes, I'd like to make|a reservation, please.
{27196}{27302}Under the name... Sara Moore
{27304}{27367}for a check-in|early tomorrow morning.
{27369}{27423}Okay.
{27425}{27469}Thank you.
{27649}{27731}Now, let's see how we did today.
{27943}{27983}Oh, yeah.
{28124}{28180}Nice nose...
{28451}{28500}Better than yesterday.
{29211}{29234}Yeah.
{29236}{29279}I'm the idiot.
{29527}{29581}Nice place.
{29748}{29782}It's good.
{30252}{30309}Miami Marriott.
{30311}{30357}Uh, Sara Moore, please.
{30359}{30415}One moment, please.
{30417}{30471}Uh, sir, I'm sorry
{30473}{30539}but Ms. Moore won't be checking|in until tomorrow morning.
{30540}{30574}Tomorrow morning?
{30575}{30602}Oh, thank you.
{30603}{30644}Thank you very much.
{30753}{30791}I gotcha.
{31228}{31254}May I help you?
{31256}{31289}You got gas.
{31291}{31328}Excuse me?
{31329}{31365}You got leakage.
{31367}{31393}Excuse me?
{31395}{31429}Not you, lady.
{31431}{31487}Your house.
{31489}{31542}But we have electric.
{31544}{31590}Yeah, I know. That's why|it's kind of a pickle.
{31592}{31644}Can I sniff around?
{31645}{31679}Actually, no.
{31681}{31706}Thanks.
{31708}{31764}Not sniffing any gas,|but I do detect
{31766}{31789}the smell of coffee.
{31792}{31814}You know, I think
{31816}{31860}you should just leave.
{31862}{31896}Yeah, why don't you run|in the kitchen and grab me
{31897}{31956}a cup of coffee|all right, cupcake?
{31958}{32000}Nice place you got here.|It's real rustic.
{32002}{32034}Amanda?
{32036}{32127}Hey, are you okay?|What's going on?
{32128}{32156}I heard all that shouting|down there.
{32210}{32238}Oh, no!
{32240}{32253}Sara Moore
{32254}{32340}you are hereby served|for divorce.
{32342}{32374}Divorce?! What?!
{32376}{32411}Smile.
{32413}{32458}No, hang on. Wait-wait a minute.
{32459}{32480}You must have|the wrong person.
{32481}{32507}Um, you must be looking
{32508}{32543}for a different|Sara Moore.
{32544}{32601}That's what|they all say.
{32603}{32634}But I'm happily married.
{32636}{32659}Not anymore.
{32757}{32827}Could I get that coffee|to go, uh...?
{32939}{33007}This is Ray.|Who the hell is this?
{33008}{33063}Hey, Ray, I'll tell you|who the hell this is.
{33065}{33131}It's Joe,|so why don't you put
{33132}{33190}that doughnut down for a second|and listen to me.
{33192}{33231}Guess who I just served.
{33233}{33302}Sara Moore. That's right.
{33303}{33353}So get your checkbook out.
{33354}{33398}And since you took me off|this gig
{33399}{33433}and I had to do it|on my own time
{33435}{33487}you better pay me double, okay?
{33488}{33554}Say good night, sweet prince.
{33594}{33643}Oh, no.
{33707}{33773}Look, if you want to use|the phone, just ask.
{33774}{33805}You served Fat Charlie
{33806}{33839}now Fat Charlie serves you.
{33841}{33893}And I'll say we served|him pretty good, too.
{33895}{33936}So, Brooklyn's in the house?
{34012}{34035}Hey!
{34037}{34078}Oh, my... Sara!
{34080}{34110}Sara, oh, my God.
{34112}{34157}You have got to see this.
{34159}{34193}What?
{34195}{34250}I don't fit in, huh?
{34251}{34279}Huh? How about this?
{34281}{34322}Now do I fit in?
{34323}{34348}How does that fit, huh?
{34375}{34418}I'm glad.
{34419}{34474}Yo, Aldo, you know, I've been|doing some thinking lately.
{34476}{34514}I'm getting kind of|tired of carpooling.
{34515}{34541}How about you?
{34543}{34578}Yeah, I could use|a little room myself.
{34580}{34605}You don't mind|there, Petey.
{34607}{34636}Oh, there's a car|right here.
{34638}{34671}I could just take this car, no?
{34673}{34708}Why not?
{34710}{34749}You're not taking my car.|That was nothing.
{34751}{34773}Come on!
{34775}{34796}Whoa!
{34798}{34839}Is that all you got...?
{34840}{34867}Get over here!
{34907}{34965}Hey, what are you,|some kind of machinist?
{34967}{35033}Are you trying to say|"masochist"?
{35035}{35074}What a meathead!
{35075}{35118}Whoa!
{35189}{35231}Hold on. Hold on a second.
{35233}{35265}Your diaper's loose.
{35685}{35712}That's it?!
{35714}{35761}That's all you girls got?!
{35763}{35797}That was nothing!
{35799}{35830}Nothing!
{35896}{35965}Baby's going to take nappy.
{36367}{36400}Oh!
{36884}{36906}Sorry.
{36908}{36936}Wretched bag.
{37039}{37100}Well, well, there is a God.
{37101}{37168}Actually, it was two Italians.
{37202}{37247}Do you have any feelings?
{37249}{37297}Do you have any shred|of humanity or compassion?
{37298}{37373}Well, little sick dogs pull|at my heartstrings
{37375}{37461}but certainly not trophy wives|from Australia.
{37462}{37500}Australia?
{37502}{37554}Look, first of all,|I'm English, you twit.
{37556}{37627}And second of all, we've had|our ups and downs
{37628}{37658}but I stuck it out
{37660}{37706}and trophy wives|don't do that.
{37708}{37743}Do you know what?
{37745}{37794}The guy on the phone was right.
{37796}{37837}You are an asshole.
{37838}{37910}Hey, I was just doing my jo...
{37931}{37964}What guy on the phone?
{37966}{37994}The guy that called up|to my apartment
{37996}{38034}to say you were on your way up|with those lovely papers.
{38036}{38066}Somebody tipped you off?
{38068}{38097}Who?
{38099}{38126}Yeah, like I know everyone
{38128}{38164}in New York|with a Brooklyn accent.
{38166}{38214}Tony.
{38216}{38260}It's got to be Tony.
{38262}{38286}The son of a bitch.
{38290}{38354}He's been tipping off my marks|for two months.
{38356}{38393}That's why|it's been so hard.
{38395}{38436}Well, my heart bleeds for you.
{38438}{38491}I'm going to kill|that son of a bitch!
{38492}{38560}Mind your own business,|pork chop.
{38799}{38835}Goddamn monkeys.
{38864}{38889}Hey, Chico
{38890}{38925}make it cooler, cooler.
{38926}{38963}Culo. �Tu quieres culo?
{38965}{38989}Yo te doy culo!
{38991}{39053}Not louder. Cooler!
{39054}{39089}Este gringo me molesta...
{39091}{39144}No gringo. Italiano.
{39146}{39168}Mambo Italiano.
{39170}{39192}No mambo Italiano.
{39194}{39224}Mambo King, Armand Assante.
{39226}{39269}- Mambo King soy yo.|- Hey, Chico
{39271}{39309}just drop me off|in America, okay?
{39311}{39350}Agase para... carajo, feo!
{39640}{39671}Hey.
{39672}{39706}Hey, I got another question.
{39707}{39764}How do people do it?
{39793}{39844}I know you're awake, so stop|pretending to be asleep.
{39846}{39889}Actually, I was|pretending to be dead
{39890}{39947}but I can't fool you.
{39949}{40013}How can someone end a marriage|like that, just...
{40014}{40058}pow?
{40060}{40120}What? Are you telling me|you didn't see this coming?
{40122}{40169}Let me guess.|A lot of trips out of town.
{40171}{40195}"Go ahead, honey."
{40197}{40242}"Go ahead. Don't worry your|pretty little head.
{40244}{40277}I'll take care|of the homestead..."
{40279}{40334}Not to mention those extra poker|nights with the boys.
{40336}{40393}Gordon doesn't play poker.
{40395}{40419}Missing my point.
{40422}{40479}Look, I've served thousands|of subpoenas.
{40481}{40536}Granted, never one to|somebody as hot as you.
{40559}{40583}I don't know|your husband
{40584}{40623}but I do have a great deal|of insight into men.
{40624}{40709}And we are mean,|hurtful and despicable.
{40737}{40769}Male headquarters would kill me
{40770}{40801}if they knew I was|telling you this.
{40802}{40857}Yeah, well, "despicable"|is putting it mildly.
{40858}{40904}And then,|you complain that
{40905}{40940}we get half of everything.
{40942}{40989}Believe me, after this type|of treatment
{40990}{41024}half is the very least|we should get.
{41025}{41070}The only thing you're getting|half of, honey
{41071}{41091}is screwed.
{41107}{41127}What do you mean?
{41129}{41158}He served you first.
{41159}{41223}He's in Texas, and he's got|home-court advantage.
{41225}{41278}Wait. Served me first?
{41279}{41314}What is this? Third grade?
{41316}{41355}Yeah, sometimes.
{41359}{41415}Texas has the most conservative|divorce laws
{41417}{41447}in the country.
{41448}{41516}Not to mention|those good ol' boy judges.
{41518}{41575}Sure most of them aren't married|to their first wives.
{41577}{41603}Believe me
{41605}{41627}if I'd known|this was coming
{41629}{41663}I'd have been the one|doing the serving.
{41665}{41694}- Yeah.|- How about that, huh?
{41696}{41719}Whatever.
{41721}{41743}No, seriously.
{41745}{41803}What would have happened|if I'd served him first?
{41805}{41834}Okay, if you had served|him first
{41838}{41873}the trial would have been|in New York...
{41875}{41930}not in Texas... where you would|have fared a lot better.
{41934}{41987}50% better, actually.
{42335}{42398}Hey, I have a proposition|for you.
{42400}{42429}You tear up the papers on me
{42431}{42471}and I'll hire you|to serve my husband.
{42473}{42519}I'll pay you twice|what you're getting now.
{42519}{42560}Look, here's|what you don't understand.
{42562}{42610}I've already told them|that I served you, okay?
{42612}{42659}So if I flip it|and tag your husband
{42660}{42696}my reputation will be shot.
{42697}{42728}I'll never work again.
{42730}{42802}I'll give you ten percent|of my divorce settlement.
{42804}{42841}We own a cattle ranch.
{42843}{42902}It's worth $20 million.
{42904}{42942}$20 million?
{42944}{42967}Mm-hmm.
{42968}{42990}Ten percent of half?
{42991}{43014}Mm-hmm.
{43015}{43054}You're willing to pay me|a million dollars.
{43056}{43105}Well, that still leaves|nine for me
{43106}{43141}versus next to nothing.
{43143}{43211}It's kind of a no-brainer.
{43213}{43247}You're really serious?
{43249}{43309}I think we should draw up|a contract.
{43311}{43362}Let's see...
{43363}{43393}Won't be needing this.
{43602}{43692}One... million...
{43747}{43802}Dollars...|Great, let's go.
{44070}{44094}Thanks a lot.
{44193}{44220}Miami Marriott.
{44222}{44266}If anybody calls|for Ms. Sara Moore
{44268}{44308}tell them she's relocated
{44310}{44375}to one of your hotels|in Bangor, Maine.
{44377}{44460}Bangor, Maine.
{44462}{44493}That's right, Bangor, Maine.
{44495}{44522}That's where she'll be.
{44524}{44556}I thought we were going|to Dallas.
{44558}{44610}We are. Just playing|a little game of hide-and-seek.
{44612}{44645}Now break out your credit cards.
{44647}{44678}We got tickets to buy.
{44680}{44740}{y:i}Well, I'm packin' up my game,|{y:i}and I'm a-head out West
{44742}{44799}{y:i}Where real women come equipped
{44801}{44833}{y:i}With scripts and fake breasts
{44835}{44888}{y:i}I'm Kid Rock,|{y:i}and I'm the real McCoy
{44890}{44949}{y:i}And I'm headin' out West, sucker
{44950}{45025}{y:i}Because I wanna be a cowboy,|{y:i}baby
{45027}{45092}{y:i}With the top let back|{y:i}and the sunshine shining
{45092}{45118}{y:i}With the top let back|{y:i}and the sunshine shining
{45119}{45188}{y:i}Cowboy, baby
{45189}{45234}{y:i}West Coast chillin'|{y:i}with the Boone's wine
{45235}{45312}{y:i}I wanna be a cowboy, baby
{45315}{45375}{y:i}Ridin' at night,|{y:i}'cause I sleep all day
{45376}{45424}{y:i}Cowboy.
{45426}{45453}All right, got my papers
{45455}{45493}and you know your way|around this place, right?
{45495}{45541}Actually, I've never been inside|before
{45543}{45570}but Gordon always said
{45572}{45625}it was his place|to come and "focus."
{45627}{45697}Yeah, well, all you have to do|is point him out
{45699}{45737}and then stay out of sight
{45739}{45790}because if he sees you,|we're done.
{45792}{45853}Is it okay if I strangle him|from behind?
{45891}{45937}Yes, you can do|whatever you want
{45938}{45982}but wait until I serve him.
{45983}{46054}Okay.
{46055}{46134}Let me see that scarf.
{46201}{46271}Okay, all set.
{46272}{46319}If you have a moment,|I'd like to take you two
{46320}{46358}on a little tour here|of our facility.
{46359}{46380}Why, that would be lovely.
{46381}{46448}Great.
{46453}{46489}So, what part of London|are you from?
{46491}{46526}Hampstead.
{46527}{46575}Hmm, sorry,|I'm not familiar with it.
{46577}{46622}Well, it's on the corner|of Penny Lane and Abbey Road.
{46624}{46658}Hmm...
{46660}{46702}very interesting.
{46704}{46741}How many pounds
{46743}{46780}were you looking at losing?
{46781}{46823}Well, I don't think|it's important
{46825}{46899}to talk about money|at this point, do you?
{46901}{46937}You see, pounds... money...
{46939}{46981}Be quiet.
{46983}{47050}How exactly did you hear|about us
{47052}{47103}Mr. And Mrs...
{47105}{47152}"Poppins"?
{47154}{47202}Well, we have an acquaintance|here at the club
{47204}{47240}a Gordon Moore.
{47242}{47291}Solid, solid, solid fellow.
{47293}{47347}Absolutely.|As a matter of fact
{47349}{47399}I believe Mr. Moore's|working out here this morning.
{47402}{47433}Perhaps we'll run into him.
{47435}{47460}Perhaps.
{47461}{47497}I'll just show you|the men's area now.
{47499}{47531}Jolly good.
{47533}{47601}Mrs. Poppins, if you'll wait|here for just a moment
{47603}{47637}we'll be back in a|jiffy, as you say.
{47641}{47680}Oh, okay, thanks.
{47772}{47845}I should tell you,|I don't like to lift things.
{48046}{48079}I'm sweating.
{48081}{48115}You're glowing, darling.
{48116}{48162}Hey, how's my form?
{48164}{48207}Yeah, yours is pretty good.
{48209}{48231}Keep it up, Gordon.
{48232}{48270}Oh, it's up.
{48272}{48303}It's up.
{48305}{48332}Focusing?!
{48334}{48356}Asshole!
{48358}{48388}Sara?
{48390}{48441}Yeah! ...|Joe, quick. It's him, quick!
{48443}{48473}Where?! Where?!
{48475}{48505}{y:i}I just wanted to show you|{y:i}our candle-lit Pilates...
{48507}{48530}You stop him, Allison!
{48592}{48676}Look, lady, I'm not going|to hit a girl, okay?
{48792}{48821}You go, girl!
{48823}{48845}Go on, Joe.
{48906}{48980}Well, guess there's|a first time for everything.
{49031}{49056}Nice.
{49095}{49137}Take that!
{49138}{49171}Quick! He's getting away!
{49173}{49216}Remind me|to give you a raise.
{49239}{49278}Oh, for Christ's sake!
{49280}{49330}Look, babe|can we talk about this?
{49380}{49428}Get up!
{49527}{49566}Way to lay low back there.
{49567}{49604}Well, you said to point him out.
{49607}{49640}I just pointed him out.
{49642}{49667}Hey, you are going to have
{49669}{49709}to get in control|of your anger, okay?
{49711}{49748}You made us look|like fools in there.
{49751}{49776}I did?
{49778}{49817}Well, hey, at least|I wasn't beaten up by a girl.
{49819}{49851}Hey, that was not a girl.
{49853}{49896}I distinctly saw|an Adam's apple
{49898}{49959}and a bulge that I was|not comfortable with.
{49961}{49990}The only thing|we had going for us
{49992}{50035}was the element of surprise,|and you blew that.
{50039}{50070}Look, I know Gordon's habits.
{50072}{50103}I can easily find him again.
{50105}{50136}Oh, what do you think?
{50138}{50198}He's just going to sit around,|waiting for us to serve him?
{50199}{50237}No, he's history.
{50239}{50323}All he has to do is jump on|the first international flight
{50327}{50371}and then we're done, all right?
{50372}{50410}Even if I find him
{50411}{50456}I can't serve him|outside the United States.
{50457}{50509}I don't like your tone.
{50511}{50570}Oh, you don't like my tone,|Your Highness?
{50571}{50630}Don't forget, whenever I want,|I can serve
{50632}{50655}your papers again.
{50657}{50706}Look, you can stand there|and threaten me
{50708}{50775}or we could just get in the car|and go and find Gordon.
{50777}{50800}Oh, yeah?
{50802}{50839}Okay, where do you want to go...
{50868}{50897}boss?
{50955}{51019}Well, as your boss, I'd be|interested in your suggestions.
{51045}{51087}This is crazy.
{51089}{51141}You're crazy
{51143}{51179}and I quit.
{51347}{51397}Hey, I thought|you were quitting.
{51399}{51450}Who the hell am I going|to quit to?
{51453}{51509}I gave up half my life|for this crap.
{51636}{51674}So, what are we going|to do first?
{51676}{51711}Well, I think we, uh...
{51713}{51765}and when I say "we,"|I mean you...
{51767}{51828}should find a mute button|for yourself.
{52065}{52155}Necessita mas toallas|en la habitacion numero 150.
{52157}{52199}Asi que cuando pueda...
{52200}{52237}Excuse me... Yo!

{52271}{52294}Can I help you?
{52295}{52311}Yeah, you can help me.
{52312}{52373}I got an important business|meeting with a Sara Moore.
{52374}{52420}- Sara Moore?|- Sara Moore, Moore.
{52421}{52478}M-O-O-O-R-E.

{52581}{52601}You sure about that?
{52602}{52630}Yeah, I'm sure about that.
{52631}{52645}What's the matter?
{52646}{52682}I don't look like a goddamn|businessman to you?
{52684}{52707}No, no, sir. It's just that
{52709}{52737}her reservation's been canceled.
{52739}{52788}Canceled? What the...?
{52789}{52865}I do have a forwarding address|if that would be helpful.
{52868}{52900}Yeah, that would be helpful.
{52902}{52940}Can you throw in|a little breeze
{52942}{52972}while you're at it?
{53032}{53063}Hey, cutie, how you doing?
{53119}{53143}She's nice.
{53145}{53181}Who's that?|Your sister?
{53183}{53229}Okay, Warren,|earn your money.
{53231}{53303}You want to tell me|what the hell's going on?
{53305}{53363}Sure.
{53365}{53405}Everything is beautiful.
{53407}{53479}My best guy served her|this morning up in Westchester.
{53481}{53534}All I'm doing is|waiting on the papers.
{53536}{53574}Oh, really?
{53576}{53642}Well, maybe you can explain|how that's possible
{53643}{53679}when she's in Dallas, moron.
{53681}{53726}Dallas? Dallas, Texas?
{53728}{53792}That's right.|And she's not alone either.
{53793}{53846}She's down here with some|goddamn process server
{53848}{53875}trying to serve my client.
{53877}{53901}Who's this Joe anyway?
{53903}{53939}Is he one of yours?
{53941}{53987}Joe? Who... Joe-Joe the singer?
{53989}{54013}No, I...
{54015}{54068}I don't know a Joe.
{54070}{54112}I can't say I know a Joe.
{54171}{54222}Look here, um, Mr. Moore
{54224}{54340}don't worry about a thing, okay?|All right?
{54342}{54402}Uh, just give me|a little more time
{54404}{54434}and as God is my witness
{54435}{54491}I will nail this bitch,|I will chase her down
{54492}{54550}like a German shepherd,|like she owe me money!
{54551}{54583}Hey...
{54585}{54626}my wife you're talking|about there, putz.
{54627}{54668}Of course, sir,|uh, my apologies.
{54695}{54724}This better get done.
{54726}{54812}Or I'm going to hang your ass|out to dry, you understand?
{54844}{54914}"This better get done.
{54916}{54983}Otherwise, I'm gonna hang|your ass out to dry."
{54984}{55043}Jesus...
{55045}{55116}a redneck telling a black man|he gonna hang him.
{55118}{55177}That's the new millennium.
{55178}{55224}Page Tony!
{55226}{55279}And get Farrakhan and them|on the phone.
{55280}{55344}I-I think they might want|a trip down there.
{55369}{55432}Doris, could you send|Vernon in here please?
{55433}{55472}Now, Gordon,|as your attorney
{55474}{55524}I would advise you not to get|your personal security
{55526}{55560}involved in the matter.
{55561}{55665}Mm-hmm. Well, as my attorney,|you screwed this up, dickweed.
{55667}{55757}Now... let's go over this
{55759}{55822}one more time.
{55824}{55892}I'm telling you|I don't know where it is.
{55894}{55922}You're telling me
{55924}{55949}you don't know where it is.
{55951}{55974}No, I swear to God.
{56113}{56149}Yeah.
{56151}{56242}Tell Mr. Moore|I'll be there momentarily.
{56413}{56436}Listen to me
{56439}{56469}you little punk...
{56470}{56506}you're not going anywhere
{56508}{56579}until we find the stapler.
{56583}{56723}It was Tommy in accounting!|He took it!
{56725}{56780}I use paper clips!
{56956}{56992}Oh... ah.
{56994}{57017}My word.
{57201}{57264}I'm just getting the brake off.
{57367}{57434}You're aware of my current|personal situation
{57434}{57459}right?
{57461}{57487}As much as you told me...
{57489}{57519}yes, sir.
{57521}{57547}See, I got my tail
{57549}{57575}in a crack here.
{57576}{57622}And I want you to do|whatever you need to do
{57623}{57699}to keep this lowlife server|away from me, okay?
{57700}{57746}Now, my overpaid lawyer|here will fill you in
{57748}{57822}on his description|and whereabouts.
{57824}{57859}Now, he's with my wife.
{57860}{57912}So let's not let|anything happen to her.
{57914}{57943}But, now, that guy?
{57945}{57988}Oh, well...
{57990}{58019}I could give a rat's ass.
{58020}{58086}Oh, I'll take care of it, sir.
{58087}{58137}Got Tony on line two.
{58139}{58174}He says there's a problem.
{58176}{58221}No kidding.
{58260}{58293}Where the hell are you?
{58295}{58331}I'm in Maine.
{58335}{58362}Maine?
{58364}{58399}What the hell|you doing in Maine?
{58401}{58456}I'm freezing my balls off,|that's what.
{58458}{58515}The bitch is in Dallas,|you idiot.
{58516}{58550}Dallas?!
{58552}{58581}I think Joe set me up.
{58583}{58642}Oh, there's a news flash.
{58684}{58755}Look, he's down there with her
{58757}{58792}trying to serve her husband.
{58793}{58818}He flipped on us.
{58819}{58851}He flipped his mark.
{58853}{58924}Now you go stick your balls|in a cup of hot cocoa.
{58926}{58978}Click your heels three times,|Dorothy
{58980}{59017}and get down to Dallas.
{59019}{59047}You nail her first
{59049}{59102}or we are done, it's over.
{59104}{59141}You understand?
{59307}{59392}You know, I need to call|Miss Cleo.
{59394}{59482}Psychics, psychics...|is that "P" or "S"?
{59670}{59709}Let me guess...|employees of the month?
{59711}{59737}Ha, ha.
{59739}{59800}So I just... I just don't know.
{59802}{59837}What's normal anymore?
{59888}{59913}Hi, Doris.
{59961}{59998}What's going on?
{60000}{60049}I would love to tell you
{60051}{60090}but I can't.
{60092}{60130}Mr. Moore had his lawyer
{60131}{60165}make all of us sign...
{60241}{60274}affidavits...
{60277}{60306}this morning saying
{60308}{60353}we wouldn't divulge|his whereabouts.
{60355}{60379}Hmm. Nice.
{60644}{60719}Well, you've been|completely useless, Doris.
{60720}{60737}I really wish|I hadn't been
{60738}{60764}so nice to you|over the years.
{60766}{60789}Let's go.|Let's go.
{60841}{60884}So what's in Durango?
{60886}{60927}Oh, he just bought|a cattle ranch there.
{60929}{60969}I haven't been there|myself yet, though.
{60971}{61006}It's Gordon's little|pet project.
{61047}{61083}How do you feel|about walking faster?
{61085}{61118}- Good.|- Good.
{61222}{61285}Two tickets on the next|flight to Durango, please.

{61372}{61429}Sure.
{61468}{61503}There you go.
{61559}{61615}Oh.
{61617}{61660}Well, at least|those two are happy.
{61661}{61722}Oh, please. That has "affair"|written all over it.
{61724}{61766}Why do you say that?
{61768}{61821}Who makes out|with their wife?
{61823}{61848}See, ring...
{61849}{61914}no ring.
{61916}{61990}I bet Gordon's having an affair.
{61992}{62031}You think?
{62033}{62073}Yeah.
{62075}{62132}You know what, I really do.
{62134}{62208}Um, I'm sorry, miss,|but my computer shows
{62210}{62267}that your credit card's|been, um, canceled.
{62269}{62296}Canceled?
{62298}{62326}Gordon virus.
{62327}{62354}Goddamn it!
{62356}{62379}No. No, no, no.
{62380}{62413}Look, I know he wants|to divorce me
{62415}{62466}but, believe me, he would not|want me to be penniless.
{62468}{62514}Um, excuse me, could|you try this card?
{62515}{62565}Honey, if he|canceled that card
{62567}{62617}he canceled all the cards.
{62688}{62738}Excuse me, one second.
{62740}{62775}No, uh...

{64170}{64222}Well, you've been|tipping off my marks
{64224}{64258}for about a month, so I figured
{64260}{64282}it was payback time.
{64284}{64306}You figured that out, huh?
{64308}{64367}Yeah, using my brain and all.
{64368}{64413}Yeah, well, the way I see it
{64415}{64476}all those jobs were mine|before you came along.
{64478}{64523}So I was just taking back|what already belonged to me.

{65108}{65138}What?

{70977}{71012}What? We're making great time.
{71014}{71058}You said we're like|three hours away.
{71060}{71101}All I know is,|is that if you sneak
{71103}{71150}onto a cattle ranch|in the middle of the night
{71151}{71188}two things are|guaranteed to happen:
{71190}{71253}one, you're going|to tread in cow shit;
{71255}{71293}and two, you're going|to get shot.
{71295}{71376}So, you want to get a hotel?

{72373}{72401}I'm just a process server.
{72491}{72569}Ow!
{72675}{72705}Let me get this straight.
{72707}{72797}You're telling me you're here|from the motel's parent company
{72799}{72854}doing spot inspections?
{72857}{72918}And I should give you|a room for free
{72919}{72949}so you can see how it is?
{72950}{72977}That's correct, sir.
{72979}{73003}And let me just say
{73004}{73041}the degree of professionalism
{73043}{73085}that you are exhibiting|here today
{73087}{73128}will undoubtedly go|in my report.

{74103}{74144}room 17.
{74146}{74177}Thank you.
{74213}{74298}Oh, and we do have|suites available
{74300}{74340}as well.
{74342}{74435}And let me know if you|need any ice.
{74437}{74497}I love you!
{74546}{74641}Bummer.
{74643}{74708}Hey...
{74710}{74756}How was your bath?
{74758}{74784}You mean shower.
{74786}{74826}There's no tub in here.
{74828}{74886}Oh, well, I'll call|the concierge.
{74888}{74923}Oh, no, wait a minute...
{74924}{74968}you got a free room|in a dump.
{74970}{74992}Tease me all you like.
{74994}{75041}I just don't feel right|if I don't have a bath.
{75042}{75099}I don't get you Americans|with your two-minute showers.
{75101}{75123}Well, it could be worse.
{75125}{75164}We could be French|and skip the whole thing.
{75196}{75222}You must admit, though
{75223}{75277}it's pretty cool the way|I got us our free room.
{75279}{75315}Oh, yeah.
{75496}{75563}What are you doing?
{75565}{75640}Well, I've gotten into bed,|and now I'm going to sleep.
{75641}{75683}No, I am the girl;|I get the bed.
{75685}{75724}All right,|I'll tell you what...
{75726}{75762}why don't you draw|an imaginary line
{75766}{75810}and I will promise|not to cross it, okay?
{75812}{75853}Okay.
{75855}{75915}My line goes all the way|around the bed.
{75917}{76002}I knew you were going|to say that.
{76043}{76074}Thank you.
{76209}{76251}Oh, yeah.
{76409}{76455}Comfy?
{76456}{76497}Yeah.
{76499}{76526}Light's out?
{76528}{76561}No, you know what
{76563}{76660}I'm just going to stay up|and read the Bible for a while.
{76662}{76697}Good night.
{76699}{76827}Yeah, I guess I got|the gist of it.
{76972}{77061}You know, assuming you serve|Gordon tomorrow
{77062}{77084}what are you going|to do with the money?
{77086}{77146}Why do girls always have|another question
{77148}{77175}after "good night"?
{77177}{77219}Come on, I'm just curious.
{77220}{77246}Well...
{77248}{77279}if you must know
{77281}{77368}I was kind of hoping|to have my own vineyard.
{77371}{77412}Napa Valley or somewhere.
{77414}{77456}Come on, I'm being serious.
{77458}{77527}Oh, seriously.
{77528}{77593}Well...
{77594}{77661}A while back I was this|hotshot attorney.
{77663}{77740}I had all the attachments|that go with that gig.
{77742}{77811}You know, a big house,|nice car...
{77812}{77876}beautiful girlfriend.
{77878}{77925}Fiancee actually.
{77927}{77965}That sounds terrible.
{77967}{78042}I can see why you|turned your back on it.
{78044}{78125}Well, anyway, I was given|this high-profile case
{78126}{78210}to defend this guy|in the cement business.
{78212}{78250}In other words, the mob.
{78252}{78300}Really? How did you know that?
{78302}{78366}I have an eye for that kind|of stuff.
{78366}{78432}And he told me|he was in the mob.
{78434}{78489}Then I realized
{78491}{78543}I'd just become this cliche.
{78546}{78602}Some sleazy defense attorney.
{78604}{78649}And at that moment, boom...
{78651}{78674}I got out.
{78676}{78719}I don't blame you.
{78721}{78783}Well, the beautiful fiancee did.
{78786}{78849}As soon as the money ran out,|so did she.
{78851}{78900}Ow.
{78902}{78989}Yeah, ow.
{78991}{79026}You know, all kidding aside
{79027}{79083}after you quit,|didn't you miss the money?
{79085}{79163}Well, being successful|isn't all about money.
{79165}{79205}No.
{79207}{79261}So your girlfriend|ditched you
{79264}{79332}because you didn't have|enough money
{79334}{79377}and my husband's ditching me
{79379}{79415}to get it all. Hmm.
{79417}{79475}All right, good night then.
{79476}{79514}Good night then.
{79950}{80017}Oh, all right.
{80019}{80053}All right, what?
{80056}{80080}I moved the line.
{80082}{80151}Oh.
{80153}{80216}It's still there.|I just moved it a little.
{80218}{80240}Oh.
{80242}{80292}Come on.
{80444}{80473}Thanks.
{80474}{80540}Thank you.
{80566}{80600}Oh, sorry.
{80601}{80627}That's okay.
{80629}{80696}Just don't let it happen again.
{81300}{81393}Gentlemen, I'd like|to welcome you to my ranch.
{81395}{81496}Now, I know in your country|it's polite to remove your shoes
{81497}{81527}when you visit|someone's humble abode...
{81528}{81566}Who are all those Japanese guys|around Gordon?
{81568}{81592}I have no idea.
{81594}{81632}If you do that around here...
{81634}{81684}Go on, go serve him.
{81687}{81708}Okay.
{81711}{81734}Oh, no, wait.
{81835}{81867}Who's that?
{81869}{81916}That is trouble.
{82083}{82121}Wyatt Earp looks pissed.
{82178}{82208}Quick, let's get|out of here.
{82419}{82480}Hey, Vernon.
{82482}{82518}I need you for a minute.
{82748}{82798}Boy, am I glad to see you two.
{82800}{82830}Really?
{82832}{82862}Of course he is.
{82863}{82894}Follow me.
{82896}{82942}Okay.
{83091}{83133}Well, you sure made it|fast enough.
{83135}{83236}Now, we're just having|the damnedest old time
{83238}{83276}milking that old boy today.
{83328}{83377}Well, that's the problem.
{83379}{83393}See, if you want|to get the milk
{83395}{83497}you need to use a girl cow.
{83499}{83548}Uh, you are the vet, right?
{83587}{83648}Yes, I am the vet.
{83650}{83682}And I'm the vet's nurse.
{83760}{83834}Um, it's casual Friday.
{83836}{83901}Well, Tornado over there,|he's normally
{83903}{83939}our feistiest bull.
{83940}{84004}Good for at least|a quart a week.
{84006}{84056}But today, hell, we can't|even get his pump primed.
{84120}{84162}Uh, would you all|excuse me please?
{84164}{84195}I need to talk with my...
{84196}{84227}nurse.
{84261}{84295}Excuse me.
{84348}{84419}Tell me they are|not talking about
{84420}{84449}what I think they're|talking about.
{84450}{84506}What do you think|they're talking about?
{84508}{84549}Masturbating|an impotent bull.
{84551}{84590}Ding, ding, ding,|ding, ding!
{84592}{84616}So what do you think, Doc?
{84662}{84714}Well, you know what,|we just got a page
{84716}{84787}uh, telling us that a sheep|has fallen into a lake
{84789}{84881}and is shrinking|at an amazing rate.
{84883}{84918}Just getting|smaller and smaller.
{84919}{84946}Go look over there.
{84948}{84970}Yes, sir.
{84972}{85021}You better find somebody|or it's your ass.
{85023}{85096}How small can|a sheep get, I guess.
{85098}{85158}So, um, how do you|get things started?
{85162}{85188}What do you do
{85190}{85216}to get the bulls...
{85217}{85241}ready?
{85242}{85273}You know, the regular way.
{85274}{85308}But we've been trying that
{85310}{85342}for over an hour.
{85343}{85410}Poor ol' Mickey, there, can't|even lift his arms up no more.
{85412}{85451}Well, maybe it's just|a question of inspiration.
{85453}{85484}I mean, that is|a very attractive rump
{85485}{85525}but, uh, maybe Tornado
{85526}{85556}needs a little bit more oomph.
{85558}{85577}Like what?
{85578}{85623}Have you tried a Barry White CD?
{85656}{85703}Why don't you just do|what the other doc did
{85704}{85735}when this happened to Attila?
{85738}{85772}You know, relieve|the pressure
{85774}{85805}on the prostate?
{85806}{85840}Prostate pressure.
{85842}{85891}Right, um...
{85893}{85951}Nurse, did you bring the tools?
{85954}{85999}Um, no, I'm afraid|I forgot them.
{86000}{86036}She forgot the tools.
{86037}{86111}Can't really do anything|without the tools.
{86113}{86166}That's all right, Doc.
{86167}{86235}We got everything you need.
{86395}{86479}Oh, dear God.
{87005}{87048}Here, let me help.
{87084}{87136}Let's get you nice|and lubricated.
{87137}{87219}How far up is|the prostate?
{87220}{87289}When you think you've|got there, keep going.
{87290}{87320}We're ready when you are, Doc.
{87799}{87849}You fellows haven't|been feeding Tornado
{87850}{87882}any Mexican food, have you?
{87978}{88030}Whoa.
{88032}{88064}Get your dumb ass over here!
{88066}{88107}Yes, Mr. Vernon.
{88108}{88130}Keep looking!
{88132}{88168}I'm sorry.
{88213}{88253}Go on, Doc.
{88255}{88294}He ain't gonna give|you an invitation.
{88296}{88332}Especially not from this end.
{88776}{88830}How's it feel in there, Doc?
{88832}{88872}Compared to what?
{88874}{88915}Better go a little further, Doc.
{88917}{88954}Ain't nothing happening yet.
{88956}{89009}Let me help you, Doc.
{89045}{89085}Whoo-ha! That's the spot, Doc!
{89086}{89116}You got it!
{89118}{89159}{y:i}Do it till you're satisfied
{89160}{89204}{y:i}Whatever it is
{89206}{89275}{y:i}Do it, do it|{y:i}till you're satisfied...
{89277}{89365}Damn, that thing sure|looks like a fire hose.
{89366}{89394}Do it till you're satisfied
{89395}{89422}Whatever it is
{89423}{89457}Do it, do it...
{89459}{89506}I'm uncomfortable.
{89507}{89542}Help, oh...
{89544}{89613}Sure wish you folks could've|been here a little earlier.
{89615}{89639}Mr. Moore came by
{89641}{89702}and had a bunch of those|corporate fellas with him
{89703}{89740}and it was damn embarrassing.
{89742}{89779}Old Tornado couldn't put on|his usual show.
{89781}{89804}Look at him go.
{89805}{89857}Oh, great...|now I-I've lost my ring.
{89858}{89883}What, was he giving them
{89885}{89927}like a little special tour|or something?
{89929}{89980}I think it was a little more|than a little tour.
{89981}{90049}I hear he's trying to sell|the whole damn company.
{90050}{90088}Hey, you hear that, Doc?
{90090}{90170}Mr. Moore is trying to sell|the whole damn company.
{90171}{90217}That's fascinating.
{90378}{90426}I can't believe|that Gordon is trying
{90428}{90455}to sell his company.
{90457}{90488}Mind you, I have to say
{90490}{90529}I think it's good news|for us.
{90531}{90553}Well, you know
{90555}{90602}if he's in the middle|of a big sales pitch
{90604}{90634}he can hardly skip town.
{90635}{90698}You don't seem|very excited.
{90700}{90759}Did you see what|I just did in there?
{90760}{90809}I'm going to need|a minute, okay?
{90811}{90899}A bull is lighting a cigarette|in there because of me.
{91217}{91284}There goes my mark.
{91286}{91331}Hey, come on.|Let's go back to Dallas.
{91819}{91846}Oh my God! Quick!
{92000}{92034}No, no, no...
{92240}{92278}Oh...
{92279}{92310}Come on, quick.
{92552}{92602}That guy must hate|veterinarians.
{92772}{92862}No. No, Mr. Cedron
{92863}{92935}every... everything's under|control, okay?
{92937}{93020}I just need a little more time.
{93022}{93048}If everything's|so goddamn under control
{93051}{93113}tell me what that process server|was doing snooping around
{93115}{93163}Gordon's Ranch up in Durango|this morning.
{93164}{93187}What?
{93187}{93234}Listen, dirtbag,|by tomorrow morning
{93234}{93270}I'm going to have these papers|out to three other firms.
{93272}{93316}That means you better|get her served
{93317}{93372}by the end of the day,|or you're off the case.
{93374}{93405}You understand?
{93407}{93449}Yeah, yeah.
{93451}{93487}Page Tony!
{93489}{93557}Tony's holding on line two.
{93558}{93623}How'd he do that?
{93626}{93656}Where the hell are you?!
{93658}{93701}Don't give me any lip, Ray.
{93703}{93725}I got shot.
{93726}{93752}What?
{93754}{93807}Some nurse is about to pick|pellets out of my back
{93809}{93857}with a pair|of needle-nosed pliers.
{93859}{93895}So just chill, all right?
{93947}{94025}Lucky for you these wounds are|only superficial.
{94026}{94099}First we got to mow that lawn.
{94101}{94149}I've been meaning|to get that done anyway.
{94151}{94173}Mm-hmm.
{94175}{94221}Tony, where are you now?
{94223}{94246}Amarillo.
{94249}{94309}I found out Joe and the girl|were going to serve
{94311}{94346}Mr. Moore at his ranch|in Amarillo
{94348}{94382}so I figured I'd ambush 'em.
{94384}{94407}Amarillo?
{94409}{94463}Father, help me.
{94465}{94535}They are in Durango.
{94537}{94585}Du-Durango?
{94587}{94609}What the h...?
{94611}{94638}You know, that Joe's|getting to be
{94639}{94665}one big pain in my...
{94696}{94743}Sorry.
{94745}{94793}Must've snagged a weed.
{94794}{94845}I got a goddamn butcher here!
{94892}{94923}Durango.
{94925}{94949}Durango!
{95076}{95160}Yeah.
{95162}{95187}Oh, man.
{95222}{95276}Mm-hmm...
{95278}{95304}Whoa, nice house.
{95306}{95342}Thanks.
{95344}{95371}You know what?
{95373}{95412}I can't wait to check|Gordon's files
{95413}{95477}to see just who he thinks|he's selling my company to.
{95479}{95520}Whoa, whoa, whoa.
{95522}{95547}What if somebody's home?
{95549}{95587}There's only Maria,|my housekeeper.
{95589}{95632}All right, at least|do me a favor, okay?
{95634}{95698}You go through the back|and get the files
{95700}{95744}and I'll distract|the housekeeper.
{95746}{95785}All right,|but be nice, okay?
{95786}{95810}I really like her.
{95811}{95868}I think I can|handle that.
{95869}{95921}Mm-hmm, mm-hmm...
{96067}{96091}Hi.
{96091}{96115}Holy...
{96117}{96167}Can I help you?
{96169}{96210}Are you... Maria?
{96212}{96257}No, I'm Kate.
{96259}{96281}Do you know Maria?
{96283}{96357}Do I know Maria?|Do I know...?
{96359}{96428}Yes. Maria's my, uh...
{96429}{96476}second cousin,|twice removed.
{96477}{96561}Oh, my! Well, let me|get her for you...
{96562}{96589}Oh, no, no,|don't do that.
{96590}{96643}If I know Maria... and I do...
{96644}{96698}she's not going to want|to come downstairs
{96699}{96732}until she looks|like Salma Hayek
{96733}{96767}if you know what I'm saying.
{96769}{96799}Oh, okay.
{96800}{96824}Do you...?
{96825}{96848}Do you have...?
{96850}{96920}Do yo... Do you have|a bathroom or something
{96921}{96994}because when you say|Big Gulp up here in Texas
{96996}{97047}you're not kidding|around.
{97049}{97097}Oh, of course.|Come on in.
{97098}{97121}Oh, gracias.
{97122}{97168}Don't worry.|It's just number one.
{97219}{97279}Um, let me show you|where it is.
{97374}{97423}So, are you|from El Salvador?
{97425}{97447}What?
{97449}{97499}Well, Maria's|from El Salvador
{97501}{97532}so I figured...
{97533}{97586}Oh, that's right.|El Salvador High.
{97588}{97625}Go, Iguanas.|Cha-cha-cha.
{97650}{97692}Well, your English|is very good.
{97694}{97734}Well, we had cable,|so, you know.
{97735}{97758}Oh...
{97760}{97804}All right,|if you just look...
{97806}{97831}Is that all wine?
{97833}{97883}Yeah, my boyfriend
{97885}{97933}has quite the collection.
{97935}{98034}Well, he is a lucky man,|you pink goddess of love.
{98531}{98561}No more callers.
{98563}{98610}We've got a winner.
{99041}{99095}Wow.
{99096}{99143}I take it y'all don't have|a lot of wine
{99144}{99167}down in El Salvador.
{99168}{99201}What?
{99203}{99225}Oh, yes, no.
{99227}{99274}Where I'm from,|it's mostly margaritas.
{99275}{99311}Ol�.
{99342}{99396}Have you ever had|a cabernet blend
{99398}{99458}that is so good|you drink it and drink it
{99459}{99525}and then you pour it|all over your privates?
{99526}{99583}I'm sorry,|I'm not all that into wines.
{99585}{99608}But my Gordy sure is.
{99610}{99632}"My Gordy"?!
{99634}{99657}Oh, boy.
{99690}{99716}Who the hell are you?!
{99718}{99790}Oh, you must be Sara.
{99791}{99838}And you must be banging|my husband.
{99839}{99905}I am truly sorry, Sara.
{99907}{99937}Mrs. Moore to you, okay?
{99939}{99963}Look, things happen.
{99965}{100017}You shouldn't blame|yourself.
{100019}{100041}Blame myself?
{100043}{100066}Are you insane?
{100067}{100101}I'm blaming you, you twinkie
{100103}{100154}and that asshole|of a husband of mine.
{100156}{100192}So...
{100195}{100213}Come on, you!
{100215}{100269}Well, you just got
{100271}{100320}a quick glimpse|into your future.
{100322}{100404}When it happens to you,|page me.
{100406}{100440}Adios, twinkie.
{100589}{100644}Whoa.
{100776}{100816}Let's take the Jag.
{100818}{100884}Yeah, let's take the Jag.
{101021}{101064}I'd give my life for a hot bath.
{101066}{101089}What?
{101091}{101130}A hot... Are we suddenly deaf?
{101132}{101200}No. I just like hearing you|say "hot bath."
{101203}{101272}Oh. Well, I'd really like one.
{101276}{101336}I think I saw a Motel 6|around here somewhere.
{101337}{101382}Wouldn't you prefer|a five-star hotel?
{101382}{101464}Sara, your breasts are great,|but...
{101466}{101494}Joe.
{101496}{101518}Uh, I don't think
{101520}{101570}they're going to get us|into a five-star hotel.
{101572}{101619}Do you think cash would?
{101764}{101794}Oh, yeah.
{101952}{102071}Oh, hello, marble bathtub.
{102072}{102101}Yes!
{102536}{102603}Do you mind if I have|a $9 bottle of water?
{102605}{102633}- Coming up.|- Thanks.
{102635}{102695}So, it says here|that Gordon's going to sell
{102697}{102757}all his assets|to some company... Kobe West?
{102759}{102821}Yeah, and, let's not|forget, behind my back.
{102858}{102891}Music?
{102893}{102932}Yeah.
{103029}{103068}So, a quick divorce
{103069}{103138}then he makes|the deal, huh? Nice.
{103139}{103162}Yeah, I know.
{103163}{103218}Seems like Gordon cares|about the money
{103220}{103247}more than anything.
{103249}{103272}Unbelievable.
{103274}{103329}Yeah, unbelievable.
{103454}{103513}I have something else|to show you.
{103514}{103588}I did a bit more stealing|from Gordon.
{103589}{103653}In fact, I got his passport|so he can't leave the country.
{103654}{103687}Nice work, 99.
{103689}{103725}Thank you.
{103775}{103800}Hey, you know what?
{103802}{103838}He went to St. Barth's|twice in the last month.
{103841}{103906}And, hey, look at this.
{103908}{103948}Acapulco on the 17th.
{103950}{104011}That was our wedding|anniversary.
{104013}{104052}I distinctly remember|him saying
{104054}{104093}he had to do business|in Omaha.
{104095}{104216}Instead, he was, um,|doing Kate in Mexico.
{104218}{104290}Sara, if Gordon can't tell|how beautiful and sexy
{104292}{104361}and intelligent you are,|then he is an idiot.
{104434}{104537}And now I'm an idiot|for saying way too much.
{104538}{104626}Didn't sound like|too much to me.
{104628}{104660}{y:i}'Cause when we're torn apart
{104662}{104742}{y:i}Shattered and scarred
{104744}{104855}{y:i}Love has the grace|{y:i}to save us
{104857}{104918}{y:i}We're just|two tarnished hearts
{104920}{104980}{y:i}When in each other's arms...
{105015}{105042}Am I hearing waves?
{105044}{105096}Don't you mean fireworks?
{105098}{105150}No, waves.
{105221}{105242}Bugger!
{105244}{105279}Oh!
{105339}{105378}Oh, God.
{105380}{105448}Sorry about that.
{105450}{105497}No, no, that's...
{105498}{105574}that's okay.
{105576}{105636}Well, I think I'll just, uh,|go ahead and get in the bath.
{105638}{105660}Great idea.
{105662}{105720}I got some Mr. Bubbles|in my bag.
{105722}{105753}Alone.
{105754}{105822}You know, I think|our priority has to be
{105824}{105858}to find Gordon.
{105859}{105907}Business first.
{105908}{105934}Right, yeah.
{105936}{106011}Business first.
{106013}{106091}You know, I was just about|to say the same thing, so...
{106095}{106132}- Okay.|- Okay.
{106342}{106389}Well, I'm going to go out|and get some fresh air...
{106390}{106417}alone.
{106674}{106713}- Hi.|- Hi.
{106777}{106846}I'm a veterinarian.
{106848}{106885}A cow just beeped me.
{107092}{107166}{y:i}My ship came in,|{y:i}and she sunk it
{107168}{107233}{y:i}I was the toast of the town,|{y:i}and she drunk it
{107235}{107278}{y:i}I had a run of good luck
{107280}{107355}{y:i}And she ran it|{y:i}right into the ground
{107381}{107428}{y:i}And now she's puttin' on|{y:i}a show
{107447}{107506}{y:i}And I get to play the clown
{107556}{107608}{y:i}I had the wind in my sails,|{y:i}and she took it...
{107610}{107657}Hey, hey, hey.|How's Maria?
{107659}{107738}Very funny.
{107740}{107781}Can I get you|something, honey?
{107783}{107839}I would really love|a Miller Longneck.
{107842}{107876}You got it.
{107878}{107960}Let's get down|to business, shall we?
{107962}{107998}Okay.
{108000}{108075}Look, Gordon is|a complete jerk.
{108077}{108128}This much we agree on.
{108130}{108164}And believe me,|I didn't need
{108165}{108197}his ex-wife|to tell me that.
{108200}{108228}I'm in it|for the money.
{108230}{108275}Really?
{108277}{108300}Yeah.
{108302}{108333}And I know how|this works.
{108335}{108367}If you serve Gordon first
{108369}{108407}then he's going|to New York
{108408}{108471}and Sara gets half|of a whole lot of money.
{108473}{108523}But to serve him,|you have to find him.
{108594}{108641}And you know where he is.
{108642}{108714}Look, there is no way
{108715}{108747}that Gordon's marrying me|without a prenup
{108749}{108817}so if I want to be|a really rich lady...
{108818}{108845}and I do...
{108847}{108917}I have got to wait|on him hand and foot
{108918}{108962}for the next 20 years.
{108964}{109004}Thank you.
{109006}{109065}Thank you.
{109096}{109211}Or... I can serve him up|to you for, let's say...
{109213}{109237}a million dollars?
{109239}{109298}And I'll never have|to see him again.
{109300}{109332}Everybody wins.
{109334}{109377}Except for Gordo.
{109379}{109412}Exactly.
{109413}{109447}Just one snag, though.
{109448}{109485}None of the money is mine.
{109487}{109542}I'd have to talk|to Sara first.
{109544}{109585}So talk.
{109745}{109786}Hey.
{109788}{109830}Hey. Nice robe.
{109832}{109874}Thank you.|Where'd you get to?
{109876}{109921}You'll see.
{109923}{109981}Hmm?
{109983}{110022}What the hell is she doing here?
{110023}{110067}She paged me.
{110069}{110101}Why?
{110103}{110168}Look, before you get|all in a... tizzy
{110170}{110194}hear her out, okay?
{110196}{110226}She's got a great plan.
{110228}{110267}Look, before we
{110268}{110293}get into all that
{110295}{110340}I just wanted to say, Sara
{110342}{110373}I feel really badly
{110375}{110426}about stealing your husband.
{110427}{110520}So badly, in fact, that there's|a guy I'd like you to meet.
{110522}{110561}Sara Moore,|you are hereby served
{110562}{110592}for divorce under the laws
{110594}{110631}governing the great|State of Texas.
{110632}{110654}Joe! Do something.
{110690}{110721}Take another one for my buddy
{110723}{110753}Joe here,|just to bust his balls.
{110755}{110793}Cheese.
{110794}{110830}Beautiful, beautiful.
{110832}{110862}Thank you. Mmm...
{110905}{110948}Classic honey trap.
{110950}{110989}Oldest trick in the book.
{110991}{111050}You should read it sometime.
{111052}{111101}Oh, and I'll see you|back in New York
{111103}{111137}when you come to|clean out your desk
{111139}{111184}ass wipe.
{111230}{111260}Look what I got.
{111406}{111458}He is cute.
{111460}{111493}It's too bad
{111495}{111525}he's just a process server.
{111738}{111825}So, one look at a girl|in tight pants and big tits
{111826}{111860}and suddenly you're stupid?
{111862}{111921}It's not the way this was|supposed to go down.
{111922}{111977}How could you blow this?
{112015}{112062}It seemed like a good idea|at the time.
{112063}{112106}Look, Sara,|can we just focus
{112107}{112147}on what we have to do now?
{112149}{112201}Yes, we can.
{112202}{112239}You can focus|on getting the hell out
{112241}{112268}of this hotel room.
{112270}{112322}Go. Get out of here.|Leave. Good-bye.
{112369}{112418}Good-bye?
{112468}{112505}That's it?
{112506}{112547}Yeah.
{112549}{112593}Go on. There's|nothing else to say.
{112918}{112965}You a genius, you hear me?
{112966}{112996}A goddamn genius!
{112998}{113024}That's all right.
{113026}{113050}You know what?
{113052}{113103}It's only been|three white geniuses ever.
{113105}{113128}Oh, yeah.
{113130}{113193}Da Vinci, Stallone|in the first Rocky
{113195}{113219}and now you, Tony.
{113221}{113246}Oh, thank you, Ray.
{113248}{113296}I swear...|I love you for this, boy.
{113298}{113325}I love you for this.
{113326}{113352}You know what?
{113354}{113400}I need you to fax me|a copy of the papers
{113402}{113448}take the originals|down to the courthouse
{113450}{113483}and get your butt back here.
{113485}{113510}Oh, yeah.
{113511}{113568}I'm going to buy you|the biggest steak in Manhattan.
{113571}{113592}You hear me?
{113595}{113640}On my way.|On my way, fast as I can.
{113643}{113682}Okay. Look here, you know what?
{113683}{113721}It's okay... fly first class.
{113722}{113745}First class?
{113746}{113798}- Good.|- First class... all right.
{113799}{113854}- What?|- Whoa, whoa... wait a minute.
{113856}{113899}Make that business class.
{113901}{113929}- Business? Okay.|- Mm-hmm.
{113931}{113993}{y:i}I gotcha, uh-huh, huh
{113995}{114065}{y:i}You thought I didn't see ya now,|{y:i}didn't ya?
{114067}{114111}{y:i}Uh-huh... now give me|{y:i}what you promised me
{114113}{114146}{y:i}Give it here, come on!
{114339}{114382}I wore myself out.
{114991}{115022}Did he...?
{115024}{115049}Wait a minute, I need a phone.
{115051}{115077}I need a phone!
{115079}{115150}Ray, Joe's on line one.
{115208}{115259}Hello, loser.
{115261}{115322}You little dirty...|you... you tried
{115324}{115362}to double-cross me, didn't you?
{115364}{115413}You know what?|I got something for you.
{115415}{115438}It's over.
{115440}{115487}Yeah, I guess|you really got me, Ray.
{115489}{115511}That's right.
{115513}{115554}Who's my bitch, huh?
{115556}{115618}Who's my bi... tch?
{115662}{115705}Yeah, I'm your bitch.
{115707}{115784}So, uh, did Tony|make the plane okay?
{115786}{115842}You know what? He sure did.
{115844}{115906}And he's flying|first class, too.
{115907}{115943}Oh... see...
{115946}{115970}I was really hoping
{115972}{116029}that he didn't drop|the papers off at city hall.
{116031}{116080}Well, you can hope|all you want to, Gladys
{116082}{116114}'cause he did. It's over.
{116115}{116157}Now, you probably have a, uh...
{116158}{116206}copy of that file|lying around somewhere.
{116210}{116248}Would you mind, uh, telling me
{116250}{116295}what time|my career officially ended?
{116297}{116324}I'd love to know that.
{116326}{116370}7:04. You hear that?
{116372}{116425}Remember it, write it down,|paint a picture...
{116427}{116457}I don't care what you do.
{116458}{116515}Seven, zero, and then
{116516}{116555}it's a big four after that.
{116556}{116582}It's over.
{116584}{116625}Yeah, that's so funny,|you know
{116626}{116684}because, uh, my watch here|says it's 6:15.
{116684}{116685}[Skipped item nr. 1684]
{116685}{116805}Looks like Retardo Montalban|forgot to set his watch back.
{116809}{116872}With the time difference|between here and New York
{116874}{116899}I can still serve Gordon.
{116901}{116978}I've still got 49 minutes. 49.
{116980}{117020}You know that number.
{117022}{117052}Your I.Q.
{117236}{117259}Hello?
{117261}{117292}Gordon Moore, Milt.
{117294}{117316}What do you got?
{117318}{117363}You want to hear what's great?
{117364}{117398}Your guy's got Lojack.
{117399}{117431}For a very reasonable|$50 surcharge
{117433}{117475}I can tell you exactly|where he is right now.
{117477}{117534}Milt, you are a beautiful,|beautiful man.
{117536}{117590}All right,|he's at the southwest corner
{117591}{117619}of Lakeville and Beverly.
{117621}{117669}I looked it up.|It's some fancy steak house.
{117673}{117699}You got it.
{117701}{117764}You just made five grand.
{117862}{117933}Sure, but after taxes...?
{118021}{118095}{y:i}On the screens ahead of you,|{y:i}we will run our safety video.
{118097}{118142}{y:i}But first,|{y:i}the captain has turned on
{118144}{118216}{y:i}the fasten-seat-belt sign,|{y:i}and we'll be departing shortly.
{118217}{118282}{y:i}Please remain seated|{y:i}as we back away from the gate.
{118422}{118445}Sir, please take your seat.
{118446}{118469}No, excuse me.
{118471}{118507}Uh, I'm a...|I'm a heart surgeon
{118510}{118593}and I got a patient that needs|an emergency... heart.
{118595}{118636}What's the matter?
{118638}{118707}I don't look like a goddamn|heart surgeon to you?!
{118800}{118826}Get in.
{118828}{118868}Are you high?
{118870}{118915}This is better. Look,|we don't have time for this.
{118917}{118940}It's over, you idiot.
{118942}{118966}You've blown it.
{118967}{119015}We have another hour|to get Gordon.
{119017}{119055}An hour?
{119057}{119148}Yeah, uh, Mrs. Siebler,|good news... yeah.
{119150}{119185}We-we got her.
{119187}{119227}Uh-huh, yeah, we did.
{119229}{119361}Listen, there is just|one tiny little thing.
{119363}{119443}We didn't "get her" get her,|though.
{119557}{119645}I... I mean, in a way,|we got her
{119646}{119722}but not like|if you get somebody.
{119723}{119750}You know how, you say
{119752}{119807}like if you was playing|hide-and-go-get-it
{119809}{119863}and you get it, but you don't|really get none of it
{119865}{119890}but you get it?
{119892}{119959}That's kind of the way|that we got her...
{119960}{120064}is she got, but not really got,|if you know what I'm saying.
{120066}{120123}It's kind of an enigma.
{120246}{120313}Now to us,|beef might be a big deal
{120315}{120385}but to a cow,|it's just another day.
{120437}{120460}You know what to do.
{120462}{120491}Keep them boys tethered.
{120493}{120525}Sit.
{120527}{120572}Shh.
{120635}{120711}Oh, and I got a belly full|of steer.
{120713}{120755}Gordon Moore!
{120757}{120849}I am hereby here|to serve you!
{121087}{121115}Gordo!
{121117}{121147}- This is Warren.|- Hey, Warren...
