102
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,490
{\fs16}- 也信不过凶杀组 - 然后呢{\r}
{\fs10}- and she didn't trust homicide. - Good.{\r}

103
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,370
{\fs16}然后她只想跟你谈{\r}
{\fs10}And she just wants to talk to you.{\r}

104
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,410
{\fs16}- 为什么是我? - 不知道. 她只跟你谈{\r}
{\fs10}- Why me? - I don't know. Only you, though.{\r}

105
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,710
{\fs16}她看起来不太正常{\r}
{\fs10}She looks crazier than a sack full of cats.{\r}

106
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,210
{\fs16}好吧,让我去问问她{\r}
{\fs10}All right, let's get this over with.{\r}

107
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,720
{\fs16}给,我加了奶精和糖{\r}
{\fs10}Hey. I put cream and sugar in it.{\r}

108
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,520
{\fs16}- 谢谢 - 不客气{\r}
{\fs10}- Thank you. - You're welcome.{\r}

109
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,060
{\fs16}我是马特.吉布森 内务部的{\r}
{\fs10}I'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs.{\r}

110
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,560
{\fs16}我同事说你有事要跟我谈?{\r}
{\fs10}My colleague said that you wanted to speak with me.{\r}

111
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,730
{\fs16}是的{\r}
{\fs10}Yes.{\r}

112
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,110
{\fs16}但是我需要完全豁免权{\r}
{\fs10}But I need complete immunity.{\r}

113
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,200
{\fs16}你为什么想要豁免权,塔克夫人{\r}
{\fs10}Why do you want immunity, Miss Tuck?{\r}

114
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,830
{\fs16}因为我所掌握的信息{\r}
{\fs10}Because of what I know.{\r}

115
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,950
{\fs16}什么信息?{\r}
{\fs10}Which is what?{\r}

116
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,120
{\fs16}答应我了吗?{\r}
{\fs10}Do we have a deal?{\r}

117
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,920
{\fs16}在这儿你得先说了我才能答应你啊,吉尔{\r}
{\fs10}You've got to give before you can receive in this house, Jill.{\r}

118
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,840
{\fs16}我丈夫,约翰,他有个帮凶{\r}
{\fs10}My husband John, he had an accomplice.{\r}

119
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,510
{\fs16}几乎所有的案件他都有参与{\r}
{\fs10}A person who assisted him with almost every murder.{\r}

120
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,010
{\fs16}你别误会{\r}
{\fs10}Look, don't get me wrong.{\r}

121
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,230
{\fs16}你能别说些没用的 说下重点吗?{\r}
{\fs10}I'm all ears if you've got something legit that you want to put on the table.{\r}

122
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,730
{\fs16}再抓住他之前 他会不停地去杀人{\r}
{\fs10}This person will go on killing until he's stopped.{\r}

123
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,940
{\fs16}- 你认识他,他也认识你 - 是吗?{\r}
{\fs10}- You know him and he definitely knows you. - Is that right?{\r}

124
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,740
{\fs16}他就是警探 马克.霍夫曼{\r}
{\fs10}He's detective Mark Hoffman.{\r}

125
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,490
{\fs16}你愿意做书面证词吗?{\r}
{\fs10}Are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit?{\r}

126
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,280
{\fs16}愿意{\r}
{\fs10}Yes.{\r}

127
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,080
{\fs16}你发誓毫无隐瞒{\r}
{\fs10}You swear to be totally open?{\r}

128
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,960
{\fs16}把一切都告诉我,不管是多隐私的?{\r}
{\fs10}You tell me everything, no matter how personal or private?{\r}

129
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,120
{\fs16}可以{\r}
{\fs10}Yes.{\r}

130
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,290
{\fs16}我会把知道的一切都告诉你{\r}
{\fs10}I'll give you evidence, whatever you want,{\r}

131
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,130
{\fs16}只要你能提供保护和完全豁免权{\r}
{\fs10}as long as I have your protection, and complete immunity.{\r}

132
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,550
{\fs16}答应我了吗?{\r}
{\fs10}Do we have a deal?{\r}

133
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,010
{\fs16}噢,是的,答应你了{\r}
{\fs10}Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.{\r}

134
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,380
{\fs16}欢迎回来{\r}
{\fs10}Welcome back!{\r}

135
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,550
{\fs16}我们正在采访鲍比.迪根,他正在全国巡回推广{\r}
{\fs10}We're live with Bobby Dagen whose national tour{\r}

136
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,430
{\fs16}他的"生还,我克服坚锯的故事"这本书{\r}
{\fs10}S.U.R.V.I.V.E. My Story of Overcoming Jigsaw{\r}

137
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,680
{\fs16}这周他来到了我们这里{\r}
{\fs10}rolls into town this weekend.{\r}

138
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,020
{\fs16}你现在还真是受欢迎啊{\r}
{\fs10}Well, you're quite the national phenomenon these days, aren't you?{\r}

139
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,520
{\fs16}谢谢,女士{\r}
{\fs10}Well, thank you, ma'am.{\r}

140
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,440
{\fs16}看到这么多人追捧我让我受惊若宠{\r}
{\fs10}It's quite flattering how many people have responded to my story.{\r}

141
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,620
{\fs16}如果我能帮助一些人找到方向,我觉得就够了{\r}
{\fs10}And if I can help a few people along the way, then I'm pleased.{\r}

142
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,080
{\fs16}你从那臭名昭著的坚锯设计的机关下生还下来了,是吧?{\r}
{\fs10}Now, you survived a trap created by the infamous Jigsaw killer, correct?{\r}

143
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,450
{\fs16}是的,女士{\r}
{\fs10}Yes, ma'am.{\r}

144
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,040
{\fs16}人们一定想问,这是种什么感觉?{\r}
{\fs10}Well, everyone must ask you this question. What was that like?{\r}

145
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,000
{\fs16}人生就此改变{\r}
{\fs10}Life changing.{\r}

146
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,300
{\fs16}是一种我从未预料到的改变{\r}
{\fs10}It was something I never anticipated{\r}

147
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,970
{\fs16}老实说,那些机关差点杀了我{\r}
{\fs10}and, quite honestly, something that should have killed me.{\r}

148
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,720
{\fs16}在详细一些, 请说一下详细的经过{\r}
{\fs10}Tell me more. Tell me about the actual experience.{\r}

149
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,770
{\fs16}其实我也记不清是怎么被抓到那儿的了{\r}
{\fs10}I actually have no recollection of how I got there.{\r}

150
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,900
{\fs16}我只是记得醒来之后发现被困住时的那种无助感{\r}
{\fs10}I just remember the feeling of waking up trapped.{\r}

151
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,780
{\fs16}我被迫把两个铁钩钩在我的胸肌上{\r}
{\fs10}And I had to insert two hooks into my pectoral muscles{\r}

152
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,360
{\fs16}然后把自己拉到一个平台上{\r}
{\fs10}and hoist myself up to a platform.{\r}

153
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,780
{\fs16}你自己穿的铁钩吗?{\r}
{\fs10}You put the hooks in yourself?{\r}

154
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
{\fs16}是的{\r}
{\fs10}I did.{\r}

155
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,780
{\fs16}我意识到我坚持不了多久了,{\r}
{\fs10}I pretty much realized that I couldn't hold on much longer,{\r}

156
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,580
{\fs16}我就接受了自己快要死了这个事实{\r}
{\fs10}and I had to accept the fact that I was going to die.{\r}

157
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,870
{\fs16}然后我大脑里闪现出一些东西,{\r}
{\fs10}And then I saw something,{\r}

158
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,500
{\fs16}我回想起我的人生{\r}
{\fs10}and what I saw was my life.{\r}

159
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,880
{\fs16}就是个悲剧, 什么都没实现{\r}
{\fs10}It was a tragedy. I achieved nothing.{\r}

160
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,430
{\fs16}就在那时,我内心涌现出一股力量,{\r}
{\fs10}And right then, something inside me started to grow,{\r}

161
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,060
{\fs16}这股力量从我的灵魂深处迸发出来{\r}
{\fs10}something from the bottom of my soul.{\r}

162
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,060
{\fs16}然后我...我决定不能放弃{\r}
{\fs10}And I just... I decided to live.{\r}

163
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,060
{\fs16}我找回了那份我原以为已经失去的力量{\r}
{\fs10}I found a strength that I thought had long since expired.{\r}

164
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,860
{\fs16}然后我就 使劲拉,使劲拉!{\r}
{\fs10}And I just yanked, and I yanked!{\r}

165
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,200
{\fs16}上去之后,我就把钩子从我胸前扯了出来{\r}
{\fs10}And when I got to the top, I just ripped the hooks out of my chest.{\r}

166
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,030
{\fs16}到处都是血,我放声大喊{\r}
{\fs10}There was blood everywhere, and I just screamed.{\r}

167
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,700
{\fs16}我就坐在那里放声大喊{\r}
{\fs10}I just sat there and screamed.{\r}

168
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,540
{\fs16}因为我不仅仅逃过一劫,{\r}
{\fs10}Because I hadn't just survived,{\r}

169
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,420
{\fs16}我还因此脱胎换骨{\r}
{\fs10}I was reborn.{\r}

170
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,460
{\fs16}我的人生我做主!{\r}
{\fs10}This was my life!{\r}

171
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,760
{\fs16}哇哦,这就是鲍比.迪根{\r}
{\fs10}Wow. Bobby Dagen, everyone.{\r}

172
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,890
{\fs16}鲍比改变人生的故事...{\r}
{\fs10}Bobby's life-changing experience comes to the...{\r}

173
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,640
{\fs16}是时候了{\r}
{\fs10}This is the moment.{\r}

174
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,270
{\fs16}- 亲吻呢? - 不知道啊{\r}
{\fs10}- Where's the big kiss? - I don't know.{\r}

175
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,850
{\fs16}现在仍然接受订票{\r}
{\fs10}Tickets are still available.{\r}

176
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,850
{\fs16}卡! 大家散场吧{\r}
{\fs10}And we're out, folks.{\r}

177
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,570
{\fs16}- 不应该是这样的... - 别激动{\r}
{\fs10}- That's not the way it's supposed to be. - You need to relax.{\r}

178
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,110
{\fs16}不,这跟我们原定的不一样{\r}
{\fs10}No, we rehearsed it differently.{\r}

179
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,450
{\fs16}没事 干的不错,鲍比{\r}
{\fs10}It's okay. Nice work, Bobby.{\r}

180
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,450
{\fs16}女士们,能回避一下吗?{\r}
{\fs10}Ladies, can you excuse us for a minute?{\r}

181
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,290
{\fs16}结尾的高潮部分呢,鲍比?{\r}
{\fs10}Where was the big finish, Bobby?{\r}

182
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,910
{\fs16}你讲述你的经历,然后你还要感谢你的妻子,{\r}
{\fs10}You tell your story, you thank your pretty wife,{\r}

183
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,290
{\fs16}你还要给她亲吻和拥抱{\r}
{\fs10}you bring her out for a big hug and kiss.{\r}

184
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,960
{\fs16}我只是不想太勉强,好吗?{\r}
{\fs10}I just didn't want to push it, all right?{\r}

185
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,830
{\fs16}但是,这才是这场故事的核心{\r}
{\fs10}Okay, but that's the heart of the story.{\r}

186
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,300
{\fs16}就是她一直陪伴在你身旁{\r}
{\fs10}She was there for your whole recovery.{\r}

187
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,090
{\fs16}如果没有了感谢,没有了亲吻{\r}
{\fs10}And without the acknowledgment, without the kiss,{\r}

188
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,470
{\fs16}那观众们是不会产生共鸣的{\r}
{\fs10}the audience isn't gonna have any kind of emotional connection.{\r}

189
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,550
{\fs16}我不同意{\r}
{\fs10}I disagree.{\r}

190
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,430
{\fs16}太多这种场面反而看上去很假{\r}
{\fs10}Too much emotion, and it's gonna feel like pandering.{\r}

191
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,600
{\fs16}你能不能让我来搞公关问题,{\r}
{\fs10}Okay, why don't you let me do the public relations,{\r}

192
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,850
{\fs16}你就管好法律问题,好吗?{\r}
{\fs10}and you do the legal paperwork, okay?{\r}

193
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,730
{\fs16}好了,我明白了,苏珊.是我的错{\r}
{\fs10}Okay, I get it, Suzanne, all right? It's my fault.{\r}

194
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,190
{\fs16}这不是你的错,鲍比{\r}
{\fs10}It wasn't your fault, Bobby.{\r}

195
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,770
{\fs16}你做的很好{\r}
{\fs10}You were fine.{\r}

196
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,650
{\fs16}- 只是下次注意要点 - 我会的{\r}
{\fs10}- Just remember your bullet points next time. - I will.{\r}

197
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,070
{\fs16}这些访谈很重要{\r}
{\fs10}These interviews are important.{\r}

198
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,940
{\fs16}妮娜,放松点{\r}
{\fs10}Nina, relax.{\r}

199
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,030
{\fs16}别管他们{\r}
{\fs10}Don't worry about them.{\r}

200
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,780
{\fs16}你做的很好{\r}
{\fs10}You were great.{\r}

201
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,110
{\fs16}是吗?{\r}
{\fs10}Yeah?{\r}

202
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
{\fs16}你的故事真实可信,人们能感觉到的{\r}
{\fs10}Your story's real and people feel that.{\r}

203
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,120
{\fs16}我知道你有时候压力很大,但是我们会克服的,鲍比{\r}
{\fs10}I know that you get overwhelmed at times, but we have to keep moving forward, Bobby.{\r}

204
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,380
{\fs16}你要继续下去{\r}
{\fs10}You were meant to do this.{\r}

205
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,720
{\fs16}我知道,我知道,宝贝{\r}
{\fs10}I know. I know, baby.{\r}

206
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,800
{\fs16}- 鲍比 - 说{\r}
{\fs10}- Bobby. - Yeah?{\r}

207
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,600
{\fs16}明天那几个坚锯机关下的生还者会来{\r}
{\fs10}We got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow.{\r}

208
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,470
{\fs16}要和他们进行30分钟面对面的交流{\r}
{\fs10}Thirty minutes of face time with other survivors.{\r}

209
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,600
{\fs16}行,听上去不错{\r}
{\fs10}Yeah, sounds good.{\r}

210
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,400
{\fs16}- 可没什么比这更让人激动的了 - 是的,没错,走吧{\r}
{\fs10}- Nothing more exciting than that. - No, not much. Let's go.{\r}

211
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,310
{\fs16}噢,上帝!{\r}
{\fs10}Oh, God!{\r}

212
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,280
{\fs16}想知道我杀了你之后最难过的事吗,吉尔?{\r}
{\fs10}You want to know the only thing wrong with killing you, Jill?{\r}

213
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,530
{\fs16}那就是只能杀你一次{\r}
{\fs10}I can only do it once.{\r}

214
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
{\fs16}噢,上帝!{\r}
{\fs10}Oh, my God!{\r}

215
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,970
{\fs16}不!{\r}
{\fs10}No!{\r}

216
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,330
{\fs16}救我! 救我!{\r}
{\fs10}Help me! Help me!{\r}

217
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,920
{\fs16}救我!{\r}
{\fs10}Help! Fuck!{\r}

218
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,590
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你好,埃文,我想要玩个游戏</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">Hello, Evan. I want to play a game.</font>{\r}

219
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,300
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你现在的处境是你咎由自取</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">The situation you find yourself in is of your own doing.</font>{\r}

220
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,850
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你,你马子,你朋友都是种族主义者</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">You, your girlfriend, and your friends are all racists.</font>{\r}

221
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,310
{\fs16}埃文,你妹的,快把我放下来!</font>{\r}
{\fs10}Evan, you fuck. You get me out of here!</font>{\r}

222
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,610
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你们仅通过肤色的不同就对别人加以恐吓</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">You have intimidated others based on their physical differences.</font>{\r}

223
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,940
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">但是今天,轮到你们了</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">But today it is you who will run scared.</font>{\r}

224
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,150
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你那群可悲的朋友对你言听计从,埃文</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">Your pathetic friends follow your every word, Evan.</font>{\r}

225
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,490
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">现在你是唯一一个能够解救他们和自己的人</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">Therefore you will be the only one capable of saving them and yourself.</font>{\r}

226
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,670
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">30秒之内,千斤顶撑起的车子会落下</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">In 30 seconds, the jacks holding up this car will fall,</font>{\r}

227
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,300
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">触发一连串致命连锁反映</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">setting off a deadly chain of events.</font>{\r}

228
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,510
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">要阻止这些事情的发生,</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">In order to stop this from happening,</font>{\r}

229
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,970
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你就必须从把你粘住的座椅上挣脱出来</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">you must tear yourself away from the seat to which you are glued.</font>{\r}

230
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,060
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">拉动你面前的红色控制杆</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">Then you must pull the red lever before you.</font>{\r}

231
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,600
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">不自我牺牲谁都活不了</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">But no act comes without a sacrifice.</font>{\r}

232
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,730
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你仅通过肤色的不同就对别人加以歧视</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">You've judged others by the color of their skin,</font>{\r}

233
00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:01,240
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">但是今天,埃文,你会记住我们体内流淌着的是同一种颜色</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">and today, Evan, you will learn that we are all the same color on the inside.</font>{\r}

234
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,610
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">死或生,埃文,自己决定吧</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">Live or die, Evan, the choice is yours.</font>{\r}

235
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,290
{\fs16}不!{\r}
{\fs10}No!{\r}

236
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,960
{\fs16}- 埃文,救我! - 我动不了{\r}
{\fs10}- Evan, help! - I can't.{\r}

237
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,760
{\fs16}- 快啊! - 快点!{\r}
{\fs10}- Do it. Fuck! - Fucking do it!{\r}

240
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,510
{\fs16}哥来了!{\r}
{\fs10}Here I go!{\r}

241
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,480
{\fs16}埃文!{\r}
{\fs10}Evan!{\r}

242
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,440
{\fs16}快来救我!{\r}
{\fs10}Baby, get me out of here!{\r}

243
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,740
{\fs16}妈的!我来了!{\r}
{\fs10}Shit! Fuck! Here I go!{\r}

{\fs16}哥来了!我能行!{\r}
{\fs10}Here I go! Come on!{\r}

245
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,820
{\fs16}妈的!{\r}
{\fs10}Fuck me!{\r}

246
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,950
{\fs16}快啊!{\r}
{\fs10}Please!{\r}

247
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,590
{\fs16}- 上帝啊! - 快点的!你他妈快点的!{\r}
{\fs10}- God! - Do it! Fucking do it!{\r}

248
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,590
{\fs16}- 上帝! - 快啊!{\r}
{\fs10}- God! - Do it!{\r}

249
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,180
{\fs16}- 埃文! - 这都怪你{\r}
{\fs10}- Evan! - You got us into this.{\r}

250
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,850
{\fs16}快把我们救出去!{\r}
{\fs10}Get us the fuck out!{\r}

251
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,100
{\fs16}快啊!{\r}
{\fs10}Do it!{\r}

252
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,230
{\fs16}你他妈的娘们!{\r}
{\fs10}You fucking pussy!{\r}

253
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,660
{\fs16}完了{\r}
{\fs10}Shit.{\r}

254
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,110
{\fs16}每天晚上{\r}
{\fs10}Every night{\r}

255
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,360
{\fs16}我都会想{\r}
{\fs10}I keep thinking that things will get better{\r}

256
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,280
{\fs16}明天一切都会好起来的{\r}
{\fs10}the next morning when I wake up.{\r}

257
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,870
{\fs16}但现实却不是这样{\r}
{\fs10}But it isn't.{\r}

258
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,040
{\fs16}不管我做什么, 看到什么{\r}
{\fs10}Everything I do, everything I see,{\r}

259
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,840
{\fs16}脑海里都会浮现出那些杀人机关{\r}
{\fs10}I'm surrounded by these tiny triggers.{\r}

260
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,670
{\fs16}它们挥之不去,{\r}
{\fs10}They're everywhere,{\r}

261
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,090
{\fs16}它们让我回想起其中的经历,{\r}
{\fs10}and they remind me of what I went through,{\r}

262
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,550
{\fs16}坚锯对我的所作所为{\r}
{\fs10}what Jigsaw did to me.{\r}

263
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,470
{\fs16}希尼,说下去,拜托了.你现在...{\r}
{\fs10}Sidney, go on, please. You're...{\r}

264
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,140
{\fs16}你现在安全了{\r}
{\fs10}You're in a safe place now.{\r}

265
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,690
{\fs16}告诉我们下面的事{\r}
{\fs10}Tell me what happened next.{\r}

266
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,650
{\fs16}阿雷克斯,住手,求你了,住手!{\r}
{\fs10}Alex! Stop, please! Stop it!{\r}

267
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,960
{\fs16}希尼,看着我{\r}
{\fs10}Sidney, look at me.{\r}

268
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,920
{\fs16}你做出了选择{\r}
{\fs10}You made a decision.{\r}

269
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,420
{\fs16}你对此有什么感受?{\r}
{\fs10}How did that make you feel?{\r}

270
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,930
{\fs16}释怀{\r}
{\fs10}Free.{\r}

271
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,640
{\fs16}他总是打我{\r}
{\fs10}He was abusive.{\r}

272
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,930
{\fs16}我之前想要逃离,{\r}
{\fs10}I tried to stop it before,{\r}

273
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,560
{\fs16}但是直到那时候{\r}
{\fs10}but it wasn't until that moment{\r}

274
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,940
{\fs16}我才做出了应做的{\r}
{\fs10}that I really did something.{\r}

275
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,900
{\fs16}我们俩只能活一个,我选择了自己{\r}
{\fs10}It was him or me, and I chose to live.{\r}

276
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,990
{\fs16}能发生这种事真是太幸运了{\r}
{\fs10}It was the best thing that ever happened to me.{\r}

277
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,780
{\fs16}都是胡说八道{\r}
{\fs10}That's a bunch of bullshit.{\r}

278
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,290
{\fs16}为了你能摆脱他 他就要去死?{\r}
{\fs10}He had to die for you to leave him?{\r}

279
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,790
{\fs16}你想知道我碰到的最好的事吗{\r}
{\fs10}You want to know the best thing that happened to me{\r}

280
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,130
{\fs16}在我砍掉自己的手臂之后?{\r}
{\fs10}after having to cut off my own arm?{\r}

281
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,800
{\fs16}就是能在商店停车场停那该死的残疾人车位了!{\r}
{\fs10}It's handicapped parking at the damn mall!{\r}

282
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,310
{\fs16}你们这些人拍什么拍?{\r}
{\fs10}What the hell is a camera here for anyway?{\r}

283
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,900
{\fs16}我只是想单纯的表明一个观点,那就是经过痛苦的磨练{\r}
{\fs10}I am simply here to illustrate the fact that a traumatic experience,{\r}

284
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,440
{\fs16}例如我们在那时被迫要做的那些事{\r}
{\fs10}such as the kind that each one of us has been forced to endure,{\r}

285
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,280
{\fs16}之后就能积极起来,就是这样{\r}
{\fs10}can have a positive outcome. That's all.{\r}

286
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,280
{\fs16}是吗?怎么积极?{\r}
{\fs10}Yeah? Like what?{\r}

287
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,160
{\fs16}一个新的人生观 停停停{\r}
{\fs10}A new perspective on life. Wait, wait, wait.{\r}

288
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,170
{\fs16}我知道,我知道你还没明白过来{\r}
{\fs10}I know. I understand that you're not at that place yet.{\r}

289
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,420
{\fs16}我表示理解与尊重{\r}
{\fs10}I understand that and I respect that.{\r}

290
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,510
{\fs16}但是如果你看看四周这些之前一直在得过且过人,{\r}
{\fs10}But if you look around at all these people taking their lives for granted,{\r}

291
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,640
{\fs16}最后他们都从中获得了积极地影响{\r}
{\fs10}eventually they all found something positive from their experience.{\r}

292
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,180
{\fs16}我们不应该以我们的经历为耻,{\r}
{\fs10}We should never be ashamed of what we've gone through,{\r}

293
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,020
{\fs16}因为我们很好很强大!{\r}
{\fs10}because we are good and we are strong!{\r}

294
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,110
{\fs16}先停会{\r}
{\fs10}You know what?{\r}

295
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,820
{\fs16}我想让你们看看这个{\r}
{\fs10}I'd like everybody to have a look at something right here.{\r}

296
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,200
{\fs16}这就是我的伤疤{\r}
{\fs10}These are my scars.{\r}

297
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,780
{\fs16}我们精神会逐渐痊愈,{\r}
{\fs10}Because our minds will heal,{\r}

298
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,040
{\fs16}但是这些伤疤却永远不会消失{\r}
{\fs10}but these scars will never go away.{\r}

299
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,250
{\fs16}这些伤疤不该当做羞耻的标志{\r}
{\fs10}These scars should not be a symbol of shame.{\r}

300
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,250
{\fs16}而应当作为我们勇气的勋章{\r}
{\fs10}They should be worn as a badge of courage.{\r}

301
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,010
{\fs16}之前,{\r}
{\fs10}You know, earlier,{\r}

302
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:17,220
{\fs16}我谈起过珍惜你的爱人{\r}
{\fs10}I spoke of valuing your loved ones.{\r}

303
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,970
{\fs16}但老实说,{\r}
{\fs10}But to be perfectly honest,{\r}

304
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,970
{\fs16}我之前可完全不是这样{\r}
{\fs10}it's something that I never did prior to my ordeal.{\r}

305
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,600
{\fs16}但是从那时开始,{\r}
{\fs10}But since then,{\r}

306
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,650
{\fs16}我发现某个人成为了我最忠实的依靠{\r}
{\fs10}I have found someone who has truly become my rock.{\r}

307
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,900
{\fs16}乔伊斯,你来...{\r}
{\fs10}Joyce, if you could...{\r}

308
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
{\fs16}来{\r}
{\fs10}Please.{\r}

309
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,490
{\fs16}这是我的爱妻,乔伊斯{\r}
{\fs10}It's my lovely wife Joyce.{\r}

310
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,710
{\fs16}- 我爱你 - 我也爱你,宝贝{\r}
{\fs10}- I love you. - I love you too, baby.{\r}

311
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,340
{\fs16}精彩{\r}
{\fs10}Bravo.{\r}

312
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,390
{\fs16}有着如此惨痛的经历,{\r}
{\fs10}To be able to sustain such a traumatic experience,{\r}

313
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,770
{\fs16}仍然用积极的眼光看待问题,{\r}
{\fs10}and yet find the positive in that grizzly act,{\r}

{\fs10}Okay, get everyone away from that crime scene till I get there.{\r}

349
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,060
{\fs16}- 凶杀组的也不行,明白吗? - 嗯{\r}
{\fs10}- Even Homicide, you got it? - Yeah.{\r}

{\fs10}You have intimidated others based on their physical differences.{\r}

355
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,770
{\fs16}你怎么想?{\r}
{\fs10}So, what do you think?{\r}

{\fs10}Well, there's gotta be something else.{\r}

{\fs10}Bag the other bodies. Get them back to the coroner's office right away.{\r}

362
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,170

{\fs10}If that man has a cavity in his tooth, I want to know about it.{\r}

419
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,270
{\fs16}<font color="#81F7F3">这听上去不可思议</font>{\r}

{\fs16}如果这事都改变不了你的人生观{\r}
{\fs10}If something like that doesn't get you to change your perspective on life,{\r}

426
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,170
{\fs16}就不可能有别的了{\r}
{\fs10}I don't know what will.{\r}

{\fs16}是啊{\r}
{\fs10}Yeah.{\r}

{\fs10}And if those people weren't so fucked up after their games,{\r}

429
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,930
{\fs16}那他们完全可以通过这些故事大捞一笔{\r}

{\fs16}你跟我说霍夫曼想杀你的时候{\r}
{\fs10}When you told me Hoffman had it in for you,{\r}

438
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,970
{\fs16}你可没说明是因为你想先杀他{\r}
{\fs10}you didn't mention that it was because you tried to kill him.{\r}

439
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,890
{\fs16}又有新案件发生了{\r}
{\fs10}There's a new game going on.{\r}

{\fs16}- 不 - 不? 不?{\r}
{\fs10}- No. - No? No?{\r}

442

{\fs10}give me Jill Tuck.{\r}

469
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,480

{\fs10}You're protecting her despite the fact{\r}

470
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,150
{\fs16}她也是个同犯,{\r}
{\fs10}that she had direct knowledge throughout,{\r}

471
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,160
{\fs16}这样你都护着她{\r}
{\fs10}which makes her complicit in every death.{\r}

472
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,740
{\fs16}我开个条件{\r}

{\fs10}If not, everyone dies and you'll be to blame.{\r}

476
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,090
{\fs16}自己决定吧{\r}
{\fs10}Make your choice.{\r}

{\fs10}Let's get her down to the holding cell at the station.{\r}

{\fs10}I've seen him on TV, but I don't know him.{\r}

640
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,660
{\fs16}你丈夫认识吗?{\r}

{\fs10}Can you find out where it came from?{\r}

649

{\fs10}It depends on how many proxy servers he filtered it through,{\r}

650
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,240
{\fs16}但是他匆忙制作,肯定会留下些蛛丝马迹{\r}
{\fs10}but it was time-delayed, so it'll leave fingerprints.{\r}

651
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,360

{\fs10}This is where he saved my life.{\r}

753

{\fs10}When I was in uniform I responded to a distress call here.{\r}

754
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:32,650
{\fs16}那时这个地方住着些社会残渣和流浪者{\r}
{\fs10}Back when this place was a flophouse forjunkies and homeless people.{\r}

{\fs10}Next time, you shoot first.{\r}

760
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,500
{\fs16}我没得选择,只有举报了霍夫曼执法不当{\r}
{\fs10}I had no choice but to report Hoffman for brutality.{\r}

761
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,750

{\fs10}A year later, I transferred to IA, busted three of his guys.{\r}

766
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,730

{\fs10}He swore he'd get me back, and here we are.{\r}

842
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,340
{\fs16}把手慢慢举起来{\r}
{\fs10}I want you to slowly put your hands in the air.{\r}

{\fs16}我知道你能找到我的{\r}
{\fs10}I knew you'd find me.{\r}

848
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:54,280
{\fs16}我很抱歉{\r}
{\fs10}I am so sorry.{\r}

849

{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">And she has seen the good in your message,</font>{\r}

859
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,690
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">尽管都是你胡扯的</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">despite its dishonest beginnings.</font>{\r}

860
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:31,190
{\fs16}他在说些什么?{\r}
{\fs10}What's he talking about?{\r}

861
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:35,400
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">今天,我们就能看到你是否值得她的爱</font>{\r}

862
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:39,570
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">要证明自己是个生还者</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">To prove your status as a survivor,</font>{\r}

863
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:44,040
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">就必须从这个非常熟悉的游戏中生还</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">you must overcome a game that should be all too familiar.</font>{\r}

864
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,580
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你自称从中生还过一次</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">You supposedly survived it once already,</font>{\r}

865
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,590
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">那么再来一次应该也没什么问题</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">so it should be easy to survive once again.</font>{\r}

866
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,800
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">把钩子钩到你的胸前</font>{\r}

{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">and the game will begin.</font>{\r}

868
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,510
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">为了救你和你妻子</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">In order to free yourself and your wife,</font>{\r}

869
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,510
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你必须在时间耗尽之前通过铁链往上爬</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">you must hoist yourself with these chains,</font>{\r}

870
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:07,480
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">然后接通上面的电源</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">and connect the extension cords above you before the clock expires.</font>{\r}

871
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:13,610
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">这场任务中你的双手都会用上</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">Both hands will be needed to complete this task.</font>{\r}

872
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:15,570
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">但这会很简单</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">But that should be simple.</font>{\r}

873
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:18,450
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">就像你自己说的那样</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">For, as you claim to understand,</font>{\r}

874
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:22,120
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">胸肌足以支撑你的体重</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">the pectoral muscles can easily support your weight.</font>{\r}

875
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:23,950
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">所以鲍比,我问你</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">So I ask you, Bobby,</font>{\r}

876
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,290
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">当你学会珍惜每一天的时候</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">when you embrace every day as if it is your last,</font>{\r}

877
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,920
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">你妻子还能在你身旁吗?</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">will it be with your wife?</font>{\r}

878
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,540
{\fs16}<font color="#FA5858">自己决定吧</font>{\r}
{\fs10}<font color="#FA5858">Make your choice.</font>{\r}

879
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,460
{\fs16}他在说些什么?{\r}
{\fs10}What's he talking about?{\r}

880
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,300
{\fs16}宝贝,真是对不起{\r}
{\fs10}Baby, I'm so sorry.{\r}

881

{\fs16}我骗了你{\r}
{\fs10}I lied.{\r}

882
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,850

{\fs10}I was never in a trap.{\r}

883
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,230
{\fs16}安全{\r}
{\fs10}Clear.{\r}

884
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,630
{\fs16}你怎么能骗我?{\r}
{\fs10}How could you let me believe that?{\r}

885
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,970
{\fs16}我会弥补的{\r}
{\fs10}I'm gonna make this right.{\r}

886
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,890
{\fs16}你不该受此惩罚{\r}
{\fs10}You don't deserve to be there.{\r}

887
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,060
{\fs16}我是你老婆!{\r}
{\fs10}I'm your wife.{\r}

888
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:30,640
{\fs16}你怎么能骗我!{\r}
{\fs10}How could you lie to me?{\r}

889
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:41,360
{\fs16}这地方很眼熟{\r}
{\fs10}I know that from somewhere.{\r}

890
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,820
{\fs16}自己决定吧 时间不多了{\r}
{\fs10}Make your choice. Clock's ticking.{\r}

891
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,420
{\fs16}把尸体装好,赶紧送到验尸官那里{\r}
{\fs10}Bag the other bodies. Get them back to the coroner's office right away.{\r}

892
