I don't know,only you 

58
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,349
看她心神不宁的样子

59
00:10:45,702 --> 00:10:48,606
好吧，我去探个究竟

60
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:58,392
-加了奶精和糖

-听我的伙计说你有事找我？

63
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,614
-你凭什么？塔克小姐
-Why do you want immunity, Ms. Tuck? 
-凭我手握猛料
-Because of what I know

64
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:18,079
说来听听
Which is what? 

65

你同意我的要求吗？
Do we have a deal? 

66

You've got to give before you can receive in this house, Jill

67

我的丈夫，约翰，门下有一弟子
My husband John had an accomplice

68
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:35,403
几乎每个拼图游戏都是这个人协助约翰搞的
A person who assisted him with almost every murder

69
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:39,346
别忽悠我了，你有什么重点就直接说出来
Now, look. Don't get me wrong here

that you want put on the table

-This person will go on killing until he's stopped

71
00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:48,836
-你认识他，当然，他也认识你
-You know him，And he definitely knows you.

Yes,I'll give you evidence, whatever you want

76
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,192
只要你们保证我的安全，还得给我刑事豁免权
As long as I have your protection and complete immunity

77

谢谢，帕姆，我把那些经历写出来
It's quite flattering how many people

83
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:10,167
并不是想哗众取宠，我只是想帮助人们做点什么
have responded to my story and if I can help 

84
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:13,648
我很乐意为社会出一份力
a few people along the way then I'm pleased

85
00:13:13,744 --> 00:13:17,898
你从那个臭名昭著的拼图狂魔设计的杀人机关中
死里逃生，对吗？
Now, you survived a trap created by the infamous Jigsaw Killer
Correct?
 
86
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:21,067
-是的
-Yes, ma'am. 
-我想观众朋友和我一样
-Well, everyone must ask you this question

87
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:23,639
都想知道你感受如何
what was that like? 

88
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:28,043
我的人生改变了，之前从未想过会这样
Life changing. It was something I never anticipated

89
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,220
老实说，我真的差点被杀掉
Quite honestly, something that should've killed me

90
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:35,687
能具体点吗？说一下来龙去脉
Tell me more. Tell me about the actual experience

91
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:41,144
额。。这个这个，怎么被抓进去的我真的记不清了
I-I-I actually have no recollection of how I got there

92
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:47,217
只记得醒来时，人已经被困于死亡机关中
I just remember the feeling of waking up trapped

93
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:50,687
-我被要求将两根铁钩紧扣住我的两块胸肌
然后将自己吊向一个平台
-I had to insert two hooks into my pectoral muscles
and hoist myself up to a platform 
-你自己把铁钩穿进去的？
-You put the hooks in yourself? 

94
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:54,639
是的，我一度感到撑不下去了
I did. I pretty much realized I couldn't hold on much longer

95
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:00,139
以为难逃一死，可就在生死一瞬间
and I had to accept the fact that I was going to die

96
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,843
我忽然感觉眼前一亮，我看见了自己的一生
And then I saw something,And what I saw was my life

97
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:08,354
我的人生就像茶杯，本身就是个杯具
It was... it was a tragedy
 
98
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:14,478
就在那时，我的心中，我的灵魂深处
Right then. Something inside me started to grow

99
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:18,902
渐渐涌现出。。涌现出一股力量
something from the bottom of my soul and

100
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:25,146
于是我。。。于是我决定我要活下去！
我催谷起那份丧失已久的勇气
I just. I decided to live!
I found the strength I'd long thought had expired

101
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:27,705
我拉呀拉，扯啊扯
and I just yanked，and I yanked 

102
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:31,248
直到爬到高台上，我把那铁钩从胸口扯出
and when I got to the top, I just ripped the hooks out of my chest
 
103
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:34,729
顿时。。顿时鲜血四溅，我声嘶力竭地叫喊着
It was-it was- there was blood everywhere and I just screamed 

104
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:39,189
就坐在那平台上大声咆哮！我不只是逃过一劫
I just sat there and screamed Because I hadn't just survived

105
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:44,103
我凤凰涅盘！我浴火重生！
I was reborn!This was my life! 

106
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,366
哇哦，各位观众，这就是波比・大根以及他的传奇人生

107
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,563
这不到点了吗？怎么没高潮后的拥吻？
This is the moment,Where's the kiss?

108
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:01,098
不知道
I don't know

109
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:03,426
好，停

109
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:05,426
跟排演的不一样

109
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,426
没事的，波哥。嘿美女们，请让波先生休息一下好吗？

110
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:18,169
那段感人肺腑的结尾呢？恩？

111
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:21,552
“激情演讲，感谢爱妻，牵手出场，拥抱热吻”

112
00:15:21,648 --> 00:15:24,548
-我不想太招摇，知道吗？
-我知道，可那是重头戏啊！

113
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:28,038
她帮助你恢复本元，你不吻她，不感谢她

114
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:31,501
-就打动不了观众，博取不到同情心。。。
-是是是。。。

115
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,018
不见得吧，过于煽情就是虚伪。。。
 
116
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:37,815
公关的事由我处理，你管好你律师的事就行

117
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:40,400
好啦！都别说了！

118
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:43,724
-算我错了，行了吧！
-你没有错什么，波哥

119
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,788
你做的很好，继续保持下去

119
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:48,788
-电视采访是非常有效的宣传手段。。。
-妮娜，你歇一会儿吧 

120
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:51,738
别多想了，你很棒
Don't worry about them. You looked great

121
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:56,037
-是吗？
-Yeah? 
-你的事迹既真实又感人
-Your story's real and people feel that

122
00:15:56,378 --> 00:16:00,809
我知道有的时候你还是会紧张不安
但我们一定要自强不息，波比
I know you can get overwhelmed at times
But we have to keep moving forward,Bobby

123
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:04,751
这是你的命运
You were meant to do this

124
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,528
我明白，亲爱的，我懂的
I know,I know,baby

125
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:14,095
-波哥
-什么事？

126
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:18,602
明天你要参加半个小时的拼图游戏幸存者“自救互助会”

127
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:22,377
-要同其他生还者聚一聚，很有意义的
-好的我知道了，走吧

127
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:04,377
哦上帝啊！
Oh My God!

128
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:08,610
你知道我最遗憾的一件事是什么吗？吉儿
You wanna know the only thing wrong with killing you, Jill?

129
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:12,200
就是只能杀你一次
I can only do it once

130
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:22,858
上帝啊！
Oh My God!

131
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,858
“埃文”

131
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:02,179
救命。。救命啊！操！！
Help me!!!Fuck!!

132
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,778
<i>你好，埃文，我想玩个游戏
Hello, Evan. I want to play a game</i>

133
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:12,574
<i>你现在身处寰常这都是你咎由自取
The situation you find yourself in is of your own doing</i>

134
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,522
<i>你，你的女友，还有你的朋友都是种族歧视者
You, your girlfriend and your friends are all racists</i>

135
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:20,883
操你妈！快放开我！！
You fuck you!Get me out of here!

136
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:24,832
<i>就因为看不惯对方的肤色，你们就蛮横地欺侮他人
You have intimidated others based on their outer appearances</i>

137
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:29,317
<i>今天，该轮到你自己了
But today, it is you who will run scared</i>

138
00:18:29,413 --> 00:18:31,866
<i>你的这帮狐朋狗友一向唯你是从，埃文
Your pathetic friends follow your every word, Evan</i>

139
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:35,358
<i>那么，如今也就只有你
Therefore, you will be the only</i>

140
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:38,401
<i>能解救他们和你自己了
one capable of saving them and yourself</i>

141
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:43,379
<i>三十秒后，支撑这辆车的千斤顶就会滑落
In thirty seconds, the jacks holding up this car will fall</i>

142
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:48,619
<i>这将触发一系列连锁血案
setting off a deadly chain of events</i>

143
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:51,168
<i>要想阻止这一切的发生
In order to stop this</i>

144
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:55,147
<i>你必须尽力从被万能胶粘住后背的座椅中挣脱出来
you must tear yourself away from the seat to which you are glued</i>

145
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,841
<i>然后去拉动前方的红色杠杆
and you must pull the red lever before you</i>

146
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,864
<i>当然，每一次挣扎都须付出血肉的代价
But no act comes without sacrifice</i>

147
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,324
<i>平日里，你看人只看肤色
You judged others by the color of their skin</i>

148
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,772
<i>今天你会明白：每个人内心都是同一种颜色
Today, you will learn that we are all the same color on the inside</i>

149
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:13,253
<i>是生是死，埃文，由你选择
Live or die, Evan. The choice is yours</i>

210
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:30,318
救我！
Do it!

211
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,878
拓马的我知道！
Fuck!I know it!

194
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:36,064
-快拉呀！
-Pull,man!
-我知道！我这就拉！！
-I know!I know!

195
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,085
埃文！！救我啊！！！
Evan!!Get me outta here!!

196
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:52,448
操！！逼！！

197
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:57,448
快啊。。。
Do it!

198
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:10,231
你妈的快点！！
Fucking do it!

199
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,812
是你连累我们的！你要救我们啊！！

200
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:26,201
我整个人都酥蜜达了！
Fucking bullshit! 

201
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:15,318
。。。我真希望不再做噩梦

202
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,490
可每次都被惊醒

203
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:26,523
周围每一处都令我回想起恐怖的经历

204
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:34,579
想起那可怕的游戏

205
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,043
雪梨，请继续说
Sydney，go on

206
00:21:38,451 --> 00:21:40,928
说吧，你现在。。你现在很安全
Please,you're,you're in a safe place now 

207
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:42,812
告诉我们你的那次经历
Tell me what happens next

208
00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:46,416
阿莱克斯！不要啊！
Alex!Stop please!

209
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,415
雪梨，看着我
Sidney, look at me

210
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,650
你做出了抉择
You made a decision

211
00:22:08,664 --> 00:22:11,788
-那一刻你有何感想？
-How did that make you feel? 
-解脱
-Free

212
00:22:13,522 --> 00:22:15,755
他老是打我
He was abusive

213
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,131
我。。我劝阻过他
I tried to stop it before

214
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,228
可是直到那时候我才下定决心
but it wasn't until that moment that I really did something

215
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:27,056
如果只能活一个，我选自己
It was him or me and I chose to live

216
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:29,317
那是我永远摆脱他的最好机会
It was the best thing that ever happened to me

217
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,439
说的什么屁话！
That's a bunch of bullshit!

218
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:36,891
就因为你要离开他，他就得为你去死吗？
He had to die for you to leave him?

219
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:45,327
你知道砍断手臂带给我的最大好处是什么吗？
You know the best thing that happened to me after having to cut off my own arm

220
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,190
那就是我现在去超市停车可以停残疾人车位了！
is handicapped parking at the damn mall! 

221
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,488
这些人到底在拍什么玩意儿？
What the hell is a camera here for, anyway? 

222
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:04,970
我在这说明一点
I am simply here to illustrate the fact that

223
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,466
“大难不死，必有后福”
a traumatic experience such as the kind that each one of us have been forced 

224
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:11,047
这就是我们自救门的宗旨
to endure can have a positive outcome.That's all

225
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,041
是吗？有什么后福？
Yeah. Like what? 

226
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:16,782
重获新生
A new perspective on life

227
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:26,863
好好你先听我说，我知道你还未达到
未达到我这种境界，我完全能理解
Wait! I know， I understand that you're not that place yet
I understand and I respect that

228
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:28,099
不过，请你看看周围这些难友
But you look around at all these people

229
00:23:28,103 --> 00:23:32,214
在遭此磨难之前他们觉得人活着是理所当然的
taking their lives for granted

230
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:34,704
但现在大家都从坎坷中学会了珍惜
Eventually they all found something positive in their experience

231
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:37,456
大家没必要为过去的事过于自责
We shouldn't be ashamed of what we've gone through

232
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:40,420
因为我们是好人！我们是坚强的好人！
Because we're good and we are strong!

233
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:46,416
我，额。。。我给大家，看样东西
I'd like everybody to look at something

234
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,269
瞧这，这些，是我的伤疤
Right here. These are my scars

235
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,322
心灵的悲痛也许可以治愈
Because our minds will heal

236
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,545
但肉体的伤疤却永远烙在我们身上
but these scars will never go away

237
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,480
疤痕绝不是耻辱的标志！
This scar should not be a symbol of shame
 
238
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:04,906
而应该视为一枚象征勇气的徽章！
It should be worn as a badge of courage

239
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:13,874
大家都知道，我现在主张“重视亲友”
You know, eariler, I... spoke of valuing your loved ones

240
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,869
说实话，在那之前，我对亲人和朋友漠不关心
But to be perfectly honest，it was something I never did prior to my ordeal

241
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:24,737
重生之后，我遇到了，值得去爱惜的人生归宿
But since then, I have found someone who has truly become my rock

242
00:24:28,185 --> 00:24:29,418
小桥，你能上来一下吗
Joyce, if you could...Please.

243
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:36,595
这位就是我太太，桥毅丝
This is my lovely wife, Joyce. 

244
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:40,807
-我爱你
-I love you
-我也爱你，亲爱的
-I love you, too, baby

245
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:52,922
很给力啊！
Bravo!

246
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,687
经历了如此痛苦不堪的恐怖事件
To be able to sustain such a traumatic experience and

247
00:24:57,893 --> 00:25:01,335
还能确立人生的新方向，并加以勉励
uh, and yet find the positive in that grisly act

248
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,353
真的是非凡人可比的意志力，呵呵
It's a remarkable feat indeed

249
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:07,055
实在是难得
Remarkable

250
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:11,032
甚至有些近乎变态了
If not a little perverse

251
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:19,270
我想我应该可以代表大家感谢你
I'm sure I speak for everyone here 

252
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:25,329
让我们能参与你的宣传活动，祝你，DVD大卖
when I say how grateful we are to be a part of your 
promotional... DVD

253
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:33,814
谢谢大家
Thank you,everyone

254
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:43,376
-我来吧，先生
-I got it,sir	
-谢谢
-Thank you

255
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,611
-嫂子，我想跟波哥谈点事。。。
-行，那我先下去  -很快就好

256
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,598
你送她上车吧

257
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,957
-没问题
-Of course
-谢谢
-Thanks

258
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,680
怎么了？
What's up?

259
00:25:52,943 --> 00:25:55,582
内拄拐的得瑟人是谁啊？你们认识吗？
So, what's with the creepy guy with the cane? Someone I should know about? 
 
260
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,927
不，我只知道他参加互助会次数比我还多，没事不用理他
No. No, he's been at these meetings longer than I have. He's fine

261
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,685
-好，那回酒店休息吧
-先走了

262
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:09,476
-路上小心，波哥！
-谢了
-加油！

263
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:23,757
小桥？
Joyce?
 
264
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:30,232
这货怎么死的？
What happened to him? 

265
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:35,068
加油站里严禁吸烟，你懂的
They always tell you not to smoke at the gas station

266
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:37,999
-这些够你研究一星期的了
-好嘞

267
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:44,261
什么事，罗杰？
What's up, man? 

268
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:47,110
我在58号公路的一个废物堆积场
I'm at a junkyard on 58. 

269
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:48,185
怎么了？
Why? 

270
00:26:48,197 --> 00:26:50,213
有人报警这出了车祸
Call came in about a car crash 

271
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:52,421
车祸？那关你什么事？
Car crash. Why are you there? 

272
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:55,206
没那么简单，是又一场拼图游戏
It's not just a car crash. It's a trap

273
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:57,016
死了多人？
How many bodies? 

274
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:59,091
残肢断体拼一块大概四具吧
Enough pieces to make four

275
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:01,725
我过来之前，禁止任何人进入现场

276
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,861
-包括重案组，听懂没？
-是

277
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:05,099
我马上就到

278
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:10,749
“。。。你好，埃文，我想玩个游戏
“Hello, Evan. I want to play a game

279
00:27:10,867 --> 00:27:16,143
你现在身处寰常这都是你咎由自取
The situation you find yourself in is of your own doing

280
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,337
你，你的女友，还有你的朋友都是种族歧视者
You, your girlfriend and your friends are all racists

281
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:24,476
就因为看不惯对方的肤色，你们就蛮横地欺侮他人。。。”
You have intimidated others based on their outer appearances”

282
00:27:41,782 --> 00:27:42,585
有什么看法？
What do you think? 

283
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:46,324
动机是什么？有什么意图？
Why? Why this display?

284
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:50,293
为什么要选这几个人？为什么是现在玩游戏？
Why them? Why now? 

285
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,122
他经常这样虚张声势
We know he likes to put on a show

286
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,859
不，一定有什么原因
No. There's gotta be something else

287
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:04,342
把尸体打包，立即装回解剖室

288
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:08,512
请海弗纳他们搜集相关线索

289
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:11,097
比如刺青，穿孔，指甲之类的

290
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:14,143
就算是蛀牙，也要告诉我

291
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,270
是，长官

292
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,503
-吉队
-什么？ 

293
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:20,655
霍夫曼料到你会来调查

294
00:28:23,717 --> 00:28:25,335
狗日的

295
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,894
“吉布森，亲眼看看吧”

296
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:29,129
瞧这

297
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:32,457
快把鉴证科的叫过来

298
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:38,782
-让他们查下指纹
-好

299
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:12,798
救命！！

300
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,266
“生存”

301
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:31,431
你好，波比			
Hello, Bobby

302
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,527
我想玩个游戏
I want to play a game

303
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:36,624
凭着一张能把尖人忽悠嗫了的大嘴
You have amassed wealth, fame and notoriety 

304
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:41,693
你发大财，做名人，红遍大江南北
based on your story of survival

305
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:46,437
越来越多的人投奔你而来，但却几乎没人知道真相 
Many have aided in your cause. Few know the truth

306
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:48,054
你是个大骗子
You are a liar

307
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,755
你我都清楚你根本就没玩过游戏
You and I both know you have never been in a trap

308
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:54,258
从未接受过考验
nor have you ever been tested

309
00:29:55,242 --> 00:29:57,492
今天，谎言成了真实
Today, these lies will come full circle

310
00:29:57,989 --> 00:30:01,708
你会认识到自己是否有资格
and you will learn if you truly have what it takes to

311
00:30:01,714 --> 00:30:04,012
自称“游戏幸存者”
call yourself a survivor

312
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:06,456
这只关押你的铁笼
The cage you find yourself in 

313
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,945
象征着你的重生
will symbolize your rebirth

314
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:12,924
小桥？！不！
Joyce?!No!

315
00:30:13,142 --> 00:30:18,022
小桥！！不！！求你不要！
Joyce! No! Please, no! 
 
316
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:24,459
接下来的一小时内，你必须接受重重考验
Within the next sixty minutes，you must 
stay on the path of learning 

317
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,546
克服种种困难，才能见到同样被囚禁起来的妻子
and traverse a series of obstacles to 
obtain access to your wife who you have also deceived

318
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:34,720
如果你未能及时到达那里，她就会死去
If you fail to reach her before the clock runs out, she will die
 
319
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:37,082
是生是死，波比，决定权在于你
Live or die, Bobby. Make your choice

320
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:42,834
“重启人生”

321
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:52,570
波比！！救我！！
Bobby!!Help me!!

322
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:55,625
救我啊！！波比！！救命！！
Help me!! Bobby!! Help!!

323
00:31:55,804 --> 00:32:00,743
放我出去！！
Let me out!!

324
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:07,463
波比？波比！
Bobby?Bobby!

325
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:12,386
什么一回事？！这到底枕么了？！
What's going on?!What's going on?!

326
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:26,784
琼等幸存者将告诉大家她们的生死经历和内心变化

327
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:29,476
那突如其来的可怕游戏	

328
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:31,527
由一盘录音带开始

329
00:32:33,013 --> 00:32:36,969
那一刻，那个东西

330
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:40,232
清空了我过去的一切

331
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,360
甚至包括痛苦

332
00:32:44,202 --> 00:32:47,217
我发觉自己如同获取了新生一般

333
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:53,891
虽然肉体被游戏折磨，但在精神上感受到了光明

334
00:32:56,033 --> 00:33:02,053
那神圣的阳光照耀着我，久而久之

335
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:05,476
我越发感到巴意盎然

336
00:33:06,076 --> 00:33:07,763
我。。。变得更加坚强

337
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:11,171
我为此对拼图狂魔心存感激

338
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:14,281
为这场游戏发生在我身上而感激

339
00:33:14,763 --> 00:33:18,430
我真心希望大家都能接受这种洗礼

340
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,154
真希望有人也能改变我现在的处境

341
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,533
但是没有人会帮我

342
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:32,257
是吗？也许你也该上电视说你被那变态整过

343
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,350
让你的名字也洋气洋气

344
00:34:00,566 --> 00:34:05,096
“自我反省”

345
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:41,574
这玩意设计得真精妙
Well, that's a real clever design

346
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:45,313
是你的杰作还是你丈夫的？
Yours or your husbands?

347
00:34:45,331 --> 00:34:46,768
一切都是他搞的
Everything was him

348
00:34:46,939 --> 00:34:47,731
这就奇了怪了
Right. Well, here's my problem

349
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:52,028
为什么那上面却布满了你的指纹！
That was left for me and your fingerprints were all over it! 

350
00:34:52,664 --> 00:34:54,468
你说霍夫曼想杀你
When you told me Hoffman had it in for you

351
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:57,498
可你为什么不坦白他追杀你是因为你差点杀了他？
you didn't mention that it was because you tried to kill him! 

352
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:04,700
现在外头又有新拼图案了，你感到意外吗？

353
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,135
-不
-不意外？

354
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:11,084
这么淡定？你心理变态了你知道不？

355
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:15,891
那天一看你那熊样我就知道你神经不正常了，疯婆子

356
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:19,823
好吧，疯婆子，我看这么办

357
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:24,090
在我抓到霍夫曼之前，你就呆在这吧

358
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:25,707
祝你吃住愉快

359
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:27,563
你凭什么知道他找不到我？

360
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,277
吉儿！这里是安全藏身处！

361
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:34,411
安全的专门用来藏身的处所，听明白没？

362
00:35:37,389 --> 00:35:40,849
吉队，这有一张寄给吉儿的光盘

363
00:35:40,892 --> 00:35:45,101
-霍夫曼知道这儿的地址
-西巴！有没有搞错？！

364
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,634
喂？

365
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,014
现场有一辆车轻微冒烟

366
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,019
拆弹组的人呢？

367
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:04,408
-罗杰？罗杰你没事吧？
-没事

368
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:05,859
你们都别动，让拆弹组的人上

369
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:08,824
他们未清理完毕之前，任何人不得靠近

370
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,790
收到

371
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:13,088
放吧

373
00:36:19,366 --> 00:36:21,003
你好啊，吉布森
Hello, Gibson
 
374
00:36:21,102 --> 00:36:24,455
好久不见，废话不多说
Been a long time，What I want is simple

375
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,354
交出吉儿・塔克
Give me Jill Tuck

376
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:33,511
她也是罪孽深重的电锯门徒，你用不着护着她
You're protecting her despite the fact that she had direct 
knowledge throughout which makes her complicit in every death

377
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:36,144
我们做笔交易
I'll make you a deal

378
00:36:36,168 --> 00:36:41,590
把她交给我，我就停止游戏，再也不用死人
Give her to me, the game stops,no one else dies

379
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:45,405
否则我就大开杀戒，这都是你自寻箱子
If not, everyone dies and you'll be to blame

380
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,286
作出抉择吧
Make your choice

381
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:49,232
时间无多
The clock's ticking
 
382
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:54,538
把她押到警局拘留室

383
00:36:54,616 --> 00:36:56,466
四周上锁，没有我的批准

384
00:36:56,484 --> 00:36:57,974
-谁也不准进！
-明白

385
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:13,827
“重新定位”

386
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,460
上帝啊！

387
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:27,220
救我！

388
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:30,303
波哥！！救我啊！！

389
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:32,500
帮我解开！

390
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,424
我动不了！

391
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:37,108
求你救救我！

392
00:37:38,763 --> 00:37:39,580
好的，别着急！

393
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:46,753
“播放我”

394
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:46,753
救我！快想想法子！

395
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:55,323
你好，波比，面前这位是你的得力助手之一
Hello, Bobby. Before you is one of your trusted colleagues

396
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:58,515
多年来不断为你作宣传打广告
She has been your publicist for years

397
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:02,876
明知你是个骗子，仍不遗余力将你打造成大明星
knowing your lies, but choosing to speak no evil

398
00:38:02,902 --> 00:38:05,636
靠不停地讲大话骗取暴利
She has been richly awarded for her words

399
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:09,725
而今天她只有不出声才能获得自由
but today, she will be awarded for her silence

400
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:13,489
X光照片中的钥匙
In the X-ray you will see a key 

401
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:17,252
正是用来关闭机关拯救她生命的
the key to Nina's survival，which will shut off her device

402
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:23,409
你的游戏任务是：必须在一分钟内用鱼钩将胃中钥匙钓出来
But there's a catch: You have one minute to 
pull the fish-hook from her stomach and unlock the device

403
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:29,856
否则，四根钻刺将让她永远保持沉默
or else the four spikes will penetrate her throat, silencing Nina forever

404
00:38:30,836 --> 00:38:32,967
要注意的是，这房间内的音量
Remember, the spikes will also advance each time

405
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:36,550
每提高一分贝，钻刺就会往前伸一段
the decibel level in this room rises above a whisper

406
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:39,150
直至刺穿她的喉咙
killing her even sooner

407
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:43,444
妮娜是生是死，波比由你决定
Will Nina live or die, Bobby? Make your choice

408
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,578
别喊！

409
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:56,524
我们齐心协力，好吗？

410
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:03,532
来吧

411
00:39:34,627 --> 00:39:35,756
安静！安静！妈的不要吵！！

412
00:39:35,782 --> 00:39:37,957
我会帮你拉出来的

413
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:53,241
别！别吵吵！

414
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:57,073
拉吧！波哥！

415
00:40:41,164 --> 00:40:43,320
不！！

416
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,643
你就不能安静一小会儿吗？！

417
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:50,714
闭上你那张鸟嘴会死啊！！

418
00:40:54,777 --> 00:41:00,503
不！！佛祖啊！！不！！

419
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:33,029
《生存：我和电锯门不能不说的故事》

420
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,501
唔该，小姐你好，敢问芳名？

421
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:46,268
莎拉，草字头沙漠的沙

422
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:49,724
我想告诉您，我灰常欣赏您写的书

423
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:52,769
文章很能引起共鸣，读后受益匪浅
（金刚注：这位演员）

424
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:55,131
您改变了我的人生观
（是本片导演凯文・格劳特的妻子）

425
00:41:55,207 --> 00:42:00,691
过奖了，谢谢你啊，肾是欣慰

426
00:42:00,975 --> 00:42:03,187
万分荣幸

427
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:12,338
先生尊姓大名？

428
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:16,817
约翰，翰林院的“翰”，你要写成吉思汗的“汗”也可以
John. With an "H," without an "H." Doesn't matter 

429
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:18,706
那还是写翰林院的“翰”吧
Well, John with an "H" this time

430
00:42:19,395 --> 00:42:21,293
你这排场够大的啊
You got quite an army working for you here, don't you?

431
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,108
费了你不少口舌吧
Must be spreading a pretty good word 

432
00:42:24,117 --> 00:42:26,841
我们只是想邀请尽可能多的读者来参与其中
Well, we try to reach as many people as possible. You know? 

433
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:29,215
你没觉得有什么不对劲的吗？
You don't see anything wrong with that? 

434
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:32,979
呵呵，没有，先生，我没觉得
No. Uh, no sir. I don't
 
435
00:42:37,803 --> 00:42:40,587
你知道吗，本人对历史情有独钟
You know, history is a passion for me

436
00:42:40,678 --> 00:42:44,578
在古埃及，人们宣誓时必须这么说
In ancient Egypt, if you were speaking under oath, you were required to say

437
00:42:44,802 --> 00:42:49,890
“若有半句不真，自当开矿采石！”
"If I'm lying, take me to the quarries." 

438
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:52,963
你明白是什么意思吗
That mean anything to you? 

439
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:55,560
不，先生，我不明白
No, sir. No, sir. It doesn't

440
00:42:56,093 --> 00:43:02,230
那就听好了：如果你欺世盗名
Well, I'll tell you what it means. It means,
if you knowingly lied on the public record

441
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:05,359
那就等着接受人民的审判吧。。。
that you were subject to a period of enslavement

442
00:43:05,388 --> 00:43:07,013
我说你啥意思啊？
What are you implying here, sir? 

443
00:43:07,028 --> 00:43:08,996
我说的够清楚了
I'm not implying anything

444
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,212
这位老同志，你已经得到波先生的签名了，请靠边
Move along, buddy. He signed your book

445
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:14,759
谢谢你的签名
Thanks for the signature

446
00:43:15,688 --> 00:43:21,300
包装精致，但华而不实，山水有相逢，哼哼 
Nice picture, but I don't need it. We've met

447
00:43:32,979 --> 00:43:35,542
海大夫，吉布森要求尽快得到尸检报告

448
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:36,886
是从垃圾场那运过来的

449
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:42,957
“由你选择”

450
00:43:44,036 --> 00:43:45,484
“时间无多”

451
00:43:45,585 --> 00:43:46,978
看见这个没？

452
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:51,703
-是什么？
-貌似在哪见过

453
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:55,828
嘿，有发现

454
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:59,551
也许能知道下一个游戏受害者是谁

455
00:43:59,574 --> 00:44:02,397
这是一家停车场的安保监控录像

456
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,350
此人名叫波比・大根，你认识他吗？

457
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:05,740
不认识

458
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:08,789
他是个拼图游戏幸存者
通过讲述逃生经历四处走穴赚了一大票

459
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:11,982
他妻子以及三名助手也都失踪了

460
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,839
“低调做人,高调做事”

461
00:44:39,214 --> 00:44:40,222
小桥？

462
00:44:40,998 --> 00:44:43,071
是谁？

463
00:44:43,978 --> 00:44:45,075
苏三妮

464
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,704
波哥！！太好了！波哥！

465
00:44:48,214 --> 00:44:49,140
快救救我！救我出去！

466
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,288
-求求你！波哥。。。
-你知道凯子在哪吗？

467
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:56,072
撒拧晓得！快救我册七啊！！快解开！

468
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:01,985
你好，波比
Hello, Bobby

469
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:07,272
现在遍布你全身的是无限恐怖
The feeling running through your body is fear 

470
00:45:07,286 --> 00:45:09,652
你害怕是因为还吃不准自己是否拥有生存的资质
the fear of not knowing if you have what it takes to survive

471
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:11,800
在你面前的是你的律师
Before you is your lawyer

472
00:45:11,826 --> 00:45:18,489
为求私利，她无视了曾经宣誓过的《律师道德守则》
who swore the Code of Ethics, but chose to see no evil in order to benefit herself

473
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:20,314
一旦机关开始转动
Once her device begins to rotate

474
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:25,466
30秒之内，她的双眼和嘴就会被捅穿
it will pierce her eyes and mouth if you don't delay its movement for at least thirty seconds

475
00:45:26,229 --> 00:45:31,158
该游戏的唯一解法是你必须走进对面那台机器
To do this, you must step into the other machine 

476
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:35,862
把铁架抬至最高位，才能切断电路，减缓钻孔
and lift the bars to the highest position long enough to close the circuit  
slowing down her device

477
00:45:36,002 --> 00:45:41,530
如果你无所作为，那她就只好慢慢等死了
If you do nothing, she will wind to her death before the clock runs out

478
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:44,922
能不能救到她呢？做出你的决定吧
Do you have what it takes to help her? Make your choice

479
00:45:45,983 --> 00:45:49,426
波比！求你了！放开我！

480
00:45:50,465 --> 00:45:52,577
上帝啊！不要啊！！

481
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,740
救命！！求求你！！！

482
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:05,747
快啊！快啊！！

483
00:46:08,652 --> 00:46:11,790
快！波比！！加油！！！

484
00:46:46,592 --> 00:46:48,088
不！！！救命啊！！

485
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,933
救命！！

486
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:09,812
波比！！不！！！

487
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:14,433
不！！！不！！！！

488
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:31,514
你认识这人吗？
Do you know this guy? 

489
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,717
电视上见过，但我和他不认识的
I've seen him on TV but I don't know him

490
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,420
那你丈夫呢？
Did your husband? 

491
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:42,412
我不知道
I don't know

492
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:45,596
你确定不认识？

493
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,155
是，我确定

494
00:48:50,213 --> 00:48:51,159
好吧

495
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:56,864
上锁

496
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,326
霍夫曼发来一封邮件，有个MPEG附件

497
00:49:00,332 --> 00:49:04,165
-我们正在追踪他的邮箱IP地址
-查得出来吗？

498
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:07,422
这IP党很猖狂，用代理不留芳

499
00:49:07,427 --> 00:49:10,477
要不要打开附件看有没有线索

500
00:49:10,482 --> 00:49:11,960
打开

501
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:14,420
你好，吉布森
Hello, Gibson
 
502
00:49:14,425 --> 00:49:20,398
我们再一次走到风口浪尖，你不交人我不怪你
Once again, we're at a moral crossroad
I don't blame you for not giving me Jill Tuck

503
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:24,201
但你的判断力不该受旧怨左右
but you shouldn't let an old grudge cloud your judgement

504
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:26,347
看看你现在的处境吧
Look to where you're being led

505
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:30,493
站在十字路口仰望，黎明天空一片晴朗
Look beyond the crossroad to the Clear Dawn

506
00:49:30,496 --> 00:49:32,760
你看到了吗？
Do you see it?

507
00:49:35,578 --> 00:49:37,641
成步堂。。。走！
I got it...Go!
 
508
00:49:42,099 --> 00:49:46,983
“无视喷子”

509
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,722
小桥？
Joyce?

510
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,486
-凯子？
-Carl?
-波哥？波哥！
-Bobby?Bobby! 

511
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,621
凯子，别急，我就在你对面

512
00:50:20,627 --> 00:50:24,134
-你别动！
-你在哪？救我！

513
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:27,015
-你知道小桥在哪吗？
-我不知道啊！

514
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,001
我啥都看不见！我眼睛被蒙住了！！

515
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:33,535
-凯子！别乱动！
-救我啊！救救我！

516
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:34,873
不要动！

517
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:39,727
你现在半空中，离地面很高，所以千万别动！听没？

518
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:44,409
你要救我啊！波哥！！救我！！

519
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:44,860
“播放我”

520
00:50:45,935 --> 00:50:48,651
-凯子，有盘录音带！
-录音带？录音带有什么用！

521
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:51,922
收声啊！我要听了！

522
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:56,447
你好，波比

523
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:59,373
站在你正对面的是你的死党凯尔
Across from you is your closest friend 

524
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:05,180
他明知你在骗人，却仍然对你言听计从
He knows all your sins, yet he acts as though he hears no evil

525
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:10,406
今天，他将听到生与死的区别
Today, what he hears will be the difference between life and death

526
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,546
波比，你必须引导凯尔走过独木桥
Bobby, you must help Cale to walk over the planks

527
00:51:13,552 --> 00:51:16,271
帮他尽快走到离你最近的位置
and get as close to you as possible

528
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:20,103
而你的任务则是穿过横梁取得那把钥匙
Find your own way across the beams to the key

529
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:23,823
就在你们中间的那个墩距上
You must get it over the last span between you

530
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:28,159
如果一分钟后你还未替他解开
If the noose around Cale's neck is not removed within sixty seconds

531
00:51:28,162 --> 00:51:32,638
绞盘就会将他凌空吊死，如此一来这世上就再没人知道你的秘密
a winch will be engaged and your secret will be left hanging

532
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:36,557
凯尔是生是死，波比由你选择
Does Cale live or die, Bobby? The choice is yours

533
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:38,096
波比！

534
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,029
凯子！听我说！凯子！

535
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,314
别瞎嚷嚷了！听我讲！！

536
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:48,010
别叫了！我会过去救你的！

537
00:51:48,015 --> 00:51:49,415
混蛋！还不快救我！

538
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:51,806
我马上来！

539
00:51:51,812 --> 00:51:53,699
我听你的，快教我怎么走！

540
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:56,120
我要你走右边！

541
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,998
走右边，没事的！撸过去！

542
00:51:59,003 --> 00:52:01,569
有块木板，有没有？

543
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,036
对对对！朝木板走去！

544
00:52:11,851 --> 00:52:13,849
好了，前面还有块木板！

545
00:52:16,395 --> 00:52:22,186
-然后往右边两点钟方向！
-好的！好的！

546
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:26,021
-快点！继续带路啊！
-好！继续！凭你的感觉！

547
00:52:34,812 --> 00:52:37,558
-这什么玩意儿？
-是一个十字路！别管它往前走！！

548
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:40,422
别怕！

549
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:45,215
你会没事的！

550
00:52:45,221 --> 00:52:48,689
前面还有根独木桥！

551
00:52:48,695 --> 00:52:52,382
-用脚去感觉！
-我踩到了！

552
00:52:54,115 --> 00:52:57,667
救我啊！波哥！

553
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:03,364
踏上去！别紧张！没事的！

554
00:53:06,628 --> 00:53:11,011
凯子！坚持住！

555
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:49,247
我拿到钥匙了！不要吵！我这就扔给你！

556
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:52,608
两手手心朝上！在胸前摊好！准备接钥匙！

557
00:53:52,613 --> 00:53:54,890
-我数三下丢过去，听没？
-好的！

558
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,477
一

559
00:53:58,483 --> 00:54:00,019
二

560
00:54:00,024 --> 00:54:01,510
三！

561
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:12,524
我擦。。。

562
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:17,990
不要啊！！

563
00:54:21,016 --> 00:54:23,013
不！！！

564
00:54:29,443 --> 00:54:32,247
凯尔！！！不。。。

565
00:54:33,514 --> 00:54:35,968
餐具啊。。。

566
00:54:44,606 --> 00:54:48,862
-啥都没
-有的，就在这

567
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:58,007
-为什么引我们来这？
-要让我想起往事

568
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,383
他曾在这里救过我的命

569
00:55:01,454 --> 00:55:05,515
我那个时候还是个片警，有天我来这巡逻

570
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:10,434
当时这一带游荡着很多脑残犀利哥

571
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:29,189
警察！不许动！

572
00:55:30,647 --> 00:55:32,449
放下枪！举起手来！

573
00:55:41,494 --> 00:55:43,830
那家伙死得有点冤

574
00:55:43,836 --> 00:55:48,949
他确实袭警了，但罪不至死啊

575
00:55:55,012 --> 00:55:58,389
下一次，要学会秒杀

576
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:02,981
霍夫曼如此暴力执法，我不得不举报他

577
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:04,627
你欠我的

578
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,482
后来呢？

579
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:19,041
后来他反而升职了我却被外派了，一年后我被调回到内务部

580
00:56:19,049 --> 00:56:22,073
我成功起诉了他和他三名手下

581
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,929
他引我们来这儿，是要报复

582
00:56:23,932 --> 00:56:28,849
这地儿原来叫“十字路口生产工厂”

583
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:31,592
所以录像里说“站在十字路口”

584
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:37,724
-下一句“黎明天空晴朗”
-是什么意思？

585
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,411
他杀的那个人，曾住在“黎明精神病院”

586
00:56:41,418 --> 00:56:45,476
是一家政府机关病院，之后没过多久就废弃了

587
00:56:45,963 --> 00:56:48,060
游戏地点就在那！

588
00:56:48,062 --> 00:56:52,440
我带队过去，你回警局保护吉儿！不得有误！

589
00:56:53,851 --> 00:56:55,971
“珍惜亲人”

590
00:57:10,743 --> 00:57:12,551
波比！！！

591
00:57:13,616 --> 00:57:16,889
-小桥！！
-波比！波比！

592
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:19,260
波比！我在这儿！

593
00:57:19,263 --> 00:57:21,419
小桥！我听到了！

594
00:57:21,425 --> 00:57:23,321
我看得见你！听到你的声音了！

595
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:26,455
波比！我也看到你了！

596
00:57:27,372 --> 00:57:30,632
-救我啊！我在这！
-知道了！老婆！我这来救你！

597
00:57:30,636 --> 00:57:32,392
是谁害我们！！

598
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:37,897
-我不知道，我先想办法救你！坚持住好吗？
-波比！

599
00:57:38,868 --> 00:57:40,778
这。。这。。这儿应该有盘录音带熟么的

600
00:57:41,747 --> 00:57:42,697
你好，波比
Hello,Bobby

601
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:46,537
面前这扇门直通你的爱妻
Before you is the door that leads to your wife

602
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:49,417
开门之前，你得先做出一个选择
However, you must first make a choice

603
00:57:49,427 --> 00:57:54,217
你可能已经猜到了，这款游戏名字就叫“厚颜无齿”
As you may have guessed, your decision
will be as difficult as pulling teeth

604
00:57:56,147 --> 00:57:59,977
那扇门锁要用四个数字组合成密码打开
The lock before you requires a four-digit combination to open

605
00:57:59,987 --> 00:58:02,857
想要找到这四个数字
However, if it is access you seek

606
00:58:02,866 --> 00:58:06,696
就得做出真正的牺牲
then a true sacrifice will have to be made

607
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:09,576
注意看，波比
Watch and learn, Bobby

608
00:58:13,426 --> 00:58:18,216
关键数字已经被刻在你其中2颗牙齿上
The necessary numbers have been etched
onto two of your teeth

609
00:58:19,186 --> 00:58:23,016
那张图供你参考选择拔哪一颗牙齿
Look to the chart as a reference 
for which teeth to pull 

610
00:58:23,025 --> 00:58:25,895
以及数字密码的排列顺序
and in which order to enter the digits

611
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:29,735
事不宜迟
Time is ticking down

612
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:31,655
早做决定
You must make your decision quickly

613
00:58:35,505 --> 00:58:37,415
波比！

614
00:58:38,385 --> 00:58:42,215
-这货不能让你看，亲爱的
-我的天哪

615
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:48,934
不要！

616
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:57,574
-左翼安全！-右翼安全！
-此区安全！此区安全！

617
00:59:00,464 --> 00:59:01,414
游戏还在继续

618
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,493
-安全！
-安全！

619
00:59:41,742 --> 00:59:42,692
A队上！

620
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:49,412
-攻入！
-清空！突破包围！

621
00:59:57,101 --> 00:59:58,051
保持戒备！

622
01:00:00,365 --> 01:00:02,851
-说话
-我已人肉到那段视频的IP所在地

623
01:00:02,861 --> 01:00:07,363
-在哪？
-在58号公路上的一个垃圾堆积场

624
01:00:07,661 --> 01:00:10,051
-之前那个车库游戏？！
-对，没错

625
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,042
-弟兄们，你们继续在这搜查
-你要去哪？

626
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,690
-抓霍夫曼
-好，大家行动！

627
01:00:24,652 --> 01:00:26,370
我是罗杰

628
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:32,129
好

629
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:35,969
怎么了？什么事？

630
01:00:36,171 --> 01:00:40,769
吉队长找到了霍夫曼的老窝，游戏该收场了

631
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:55,744
又发现一个

632
01:00:58,538 --> 01:00:59,584
停！

633
01:01:03,338 --> 01:01:05,344
有个活的！

634
01:01:20,617 --> 01:01:23,583
没法过去，我们走

635
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:09,661
你们俩，带上来福枪跟我来

636
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:20,175
“吉布森，亲眼看看吧”

637
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:28,169
把枪给我

638
01:02:48,815 --> 01:02:54,487
霍夫曼！不许动！举起手来！！

639
01:02:59,374 --> 01:03:02,282
“把握每天”

640
01:03:02,288 --> 01:03:04,343
-老婆？
-老公！

641
01:03:08,014 --> 01:03:09,962
波比我就知道你会来的！我相信你！

642
01:03:09,967 --> 01:03:13,207
-我对不起你。。。
-我相信你一定能行的！

643
01:03:14,768 --> 01:03:15,915
救我！救我出去！

644
01:03:19,104 --> 01:03:21,449
波比！你没事吧？

645
01:03:21,453 --> 01:03:23,354
肯定有其他办法

646
01:03:26,478 --> 01:03:28,167
你好，波比
Hello, Bobby

647
01:03:28,173 --> 01:03:34,985
几近脱胎换骨，面临最难任务
You have almost completed your rebirth
However, you will find the task will be your most difficult

648
01:03:34,988 --> 01:03:42,025
娇妻带来性福，骗局最大礼物
The woman before you symbolizes your success
She is your trophy 

649
01:03:42,126 --> 01:03:45,385
演讲眉飞色舞，真相不肯吐露
and she has seen the good in your message
，despite its dishonest beginnings

650
01:03:45,485 --> 01:03:50,297
-它说啥？什么意思啊？
--What's he talking about?Bobby?
-女方认知盲目，男方值得信服？
-Today, we will see if you can truly earn her love

651
01:03:52,222 --> 01:03:58,026
吹牛不算丈夫，实战判决赢输
To prove your status as a survivor,
you must overcome the game that should be all too familiar

652
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:05,668
汝既逃生有术，何不轻松应付
You supposedly survived it once already,
so it should be easy to survive once again

653
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:11,271
铁钩穿插胸部，游戏即刻起步
Pierce the hooks through your chest muscles and the game will begin

654
01:04:11,307 --> 01:04:20,535
连接延长电路，吊索解救夫妇
In order to free yourself and your wife, you must hoist yourself 
with these chains and connect the extension cords above you before the clock expires

655
01:04:23,467 --> 01:04:35,394
锁链用手抓住，胸肌可堪重负
Both hands will be needed to complete this task
but that should be simple,for as you claimed to understand
the pectoral muscles can easily support your weight

656
01:04:35,403 --> 01:04:40,164
时光流逝飞速，珍惜世间万物
So I ask you, Bobby, will you embrace every day as if it is your last? 

657
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:45,959
汝若抉择失误，妻赴黄泉之路
Will it be with your wife? Make your choice

658
01:04:45,968 --> 01:04:52,813
-它什么意思？！
-很对不起，我骗了你。。。

659
01:04:54,856 --> 01:04:57,313
我从没玩过什么游戏。。。

660
01:05:01,577 --> 01:05:03,076
安全！

661
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:30,116
你怎可以如此道貌岸然！！

662
01:05:30,122 --> 01:05:33,922
我现在就来弥补这个过错，你好好在那呆着

663
01:05:36,806 --> 01:05:40,929
我是你的妻子！你连我都骗这叫我情何以堪？！

664
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,264
“貌似在哪见过”

665
01:05:52,135 --> 01:05:54,687
“由你选择，时间无多”

666
01:06:04,647 --> 01:06:09,476
“把尸体打包，立即装回解剖室”

667
01:06:09,478 --> 01:06:10,591
长官，这是什么？

668
01:06:10,598 --> 01:06:15,811
这是霍夫曼的监控系统，他一直在监视着我们！！

669
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:46,156
我地妈。。。

670
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:53,600
-我是帕尔玛
-听着！

671
01:06:53,603 --> 01:06:55,551
马上把所有警力全部召回警局！

672
01:06:55,556 --> 01:06:58,311
-什么？
-赶快！

673
01:06:58,317 --> 01:06:59,620
吉队？

674
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:19,950
吉队？你还在吗？吉大队？

675
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,218
“警告过你”

676
01:08:09,954 --> 01:08:11,284
锁住了！我们被锁住了！

677
01:08:14,274 --> 01:08:16,117
毒气！快找出口！

678
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:40,067
我爱你，小桥

679
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:43,066
一直以来都很爱你

680
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:45,913
我也爱你

681
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:48,340
波比，我也爱你

682
01:09:08,989 --> 01:09:10,553
吉队？

683
01:09:23,356 --> 01:09:25,181
你能撑住的！你能做到的！

684
01:09:29,595 --> 01:09:30,556
佛祖啊。。。

685
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,696
波比，我爱你

686
01:09:54,129 --> 01:09:56,097
加油啊！

687
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:04,848
扯啊！波比！拉啊！

688
01:10:09,189 --> 01:10:11,392
波比！你能行的！

689
01:10:11,396 --> 01:10:12,893
波比！

690
01:10:15,195 --> 01:10:16,650
扯啊！！

691
01:10:39,594 --> 01:10:41,150
外面枕么了？

692
01:10:41,152 --> 01:10:43,460
对！拉啊！

693
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:46,616
拉！

694
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:53,622
快啊！继续，就快到了！

695
01:10:57,431 --> 01:10:59,660
忍住，波比！你能行的！

696
01:11:00,902 --> 01:11:02,568
外面有人！
Someone's out there

697
01:11:09,688 --> 01:11:13,569
上帝啊！不！！不要！！！
Oh, my god! No!

698
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:17,403
不！不要啊！不要啊！！！
Help me! Help me! Someone help me! 

699
01:11:26,422 --> 01:11:27,885
我找你找的要飞起啊
I've been looking for you

700
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:50,938
我现在算什么水平？
How do I look? 

701
01:11:57,655 --> 01:11:59,107
烂逼！
Bitch!

702
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:02,752
救命！！！

703
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:08,182
波比！加油啊！拉啊！

704
01:12:11,316 --> 01:12:14,295
波比！！快点！！

705
01:12:15,284 --> 01:12:18,344
赶紧的！快快！快拉！

706
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:33,735
波比！！！加把劲！！

707
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:37,600
再来！

708
01:12:38,444 --> 01:12:39,987
你一定行！

709
01:12:46,147 --> 01:12:47,640
波比！！

710
01:13:48,913 --> 01:13:50,739
不！！！

711
01:13:51,982 --> 01:13:53,834
老公！！！！

712
01:13:57,561 --> 01:14:03,275
-不！！老公啊！！！
-老婆！！

713
01:14:08,298 --> 01:14:09,763
-老婆！！！
-不！！

714
01:14:20,674 --> 01:14:22,243
波比救我啊！！！！

715
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:53,369
小桥！！

716
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,971
不！！！

717
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:20,560
小桥！！小桥啊。。。。

718
01:16:40,127 --> 01:16:42,493
游戏结束

719
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:02,482
在过去的数小时内，我市公安局发生了特大恶性杀人案

720
01:17:03,445 --> 01:17:06,185
九位人民警察壮烈牺牲

721
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:10,038
拼图狂魔的遗孀吉儿・塔克也被暴徒杀死

722
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:13,799
案发地方圆50公里内已被警方全面封锁

723
01:17:13,904 --> 01:17:21,345
市民若发现可疑人物，请立即报警

724
01:18:01,976 --> 01:18:03,747
投你妈。。。。

725
01:18:12,976 --> 01:18:14,747
“哥登医生 绝密”

725
01:18:20,119 --> 01:18:22,207
你好，哥登医生
Hello, Dr. Gordon

726
01:18:23,348 --> 01:18:26,432
你可能是我最宝贵的遗产
You are perhaps my greatest asset

727
01:18:39,183 --> 01:18:43,132
恭喜你，哥登医生，你活下来了
Congratulations, Dr. Gordon，you're still alive

728
01:18:56,434 --> 01:19:02,915
全靠你这几年的帮助，电锯门才得以蓬勃发展
Without you, my work over the last few years would not have been possible

729
01:19:10,102 --> 01:19:14,089
这是杰夫的妻子：莲恩・戴伦医生

730
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:19,913
她是最理想的人选

731
01:19:25,578 --> 01:19:28,148
瞎了我的狗眼！

732
01:19:28,688 --> 01:19:30,906
“举头三尺有神灵”

733
01:19:34,559 --> 01:19:36,582
“举头三尺有神灵”

734
01:19:43,065 --> 01:19:45,550
最后，我要做一个非常艰难的决定
That having been said, I have a request

735
01:19:45,554 --> 01:19:47,397
替我照看好吉儿
Watch over Jill 

736
01:19:48,114 --> 01:19:53,564
一旦她遭遇不测，就立即行动！
and should anything happen to her
I want you to act immediately on my behalf

737
01:19:53,633 --> 01:19:59,319
作为回报，我会告诉你电锯门所有秘密
In return for that，I will keep no more secrets from you

738
01:20:00,281 --> 01:20:02,227
我曾带你神游四方
I showed you a lot of places

739
01:20:04,496 --> 01:20:08,127
但对你来说最有意义的一处，非此地莫属
but there is one that will be perhaps 
the most meaningful to you 

740
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:49,115
你想的太多了
I don't think so

741
01:20:59,703 --> 01:21:01,660
你要干什么？！
What do you think you're doing?

742
01:21:02,764 --> 01:21:04,886
你妈逼想要干什么！！
What the fuck do you think you're doing?!

743
01:21:04,973 --> 01:21:05,847
喂！
Huh?! 

744
01:21:14,893 --> 01:21:15,407
不！！
No!!

745
01:21:17,224 --> 01:21:19,066
不能这么对我！你这烂胚！！
You can't fucking do this to me!  

746
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:20,344
操你妈！！不！！！
Fuck you! NO!

747
01:21:21,473 --> 01:21:22,248
玩完了
Game over
 
748
01:21:23,293 --> 01:21:24,505
