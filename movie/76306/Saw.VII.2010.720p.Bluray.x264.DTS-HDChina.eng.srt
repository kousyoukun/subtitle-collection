00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,868
Hello, Mr. Hindle,

2
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,539
or as they called you
around the hospital, Zepp.

3
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,046
Game over!

4
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,039
Check it, man.

5
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,569
What the fuck is this?

6
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,072
What the fuck are you doing here?

7
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,408
I'm fucking stuck.

8
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,159
Yeah, me too.

9
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,829
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

10
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,248
Somebody, help us.

11
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,500
- Hello.
- Come on, help us!

12
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,504
Oh, my God!

13
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,925
Dina.

14
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,093
Brad.

15
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,139
- Ryan?
- Baby, are you okay?

16
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,391
- Get me out of here!
- Baby.

17
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,977
Help us. Somebody help us!

18
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,855
Hey! Call the police!

19
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,523
Hey, break the glass with your case.

20
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,817
Break the fucking glass! Do it.

21
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,444
Stay back!

22
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,447
Do it!

23
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,491
- Get me out of here.
- Break it!

24
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,372
Hello, Brad.

25
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,752
Hello, Ryan. I'd like to play a game.

26
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,881
The same woman
has played each of you for a fool,

27
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:21,135
manipulating your love for her,
and causing nothing but pain.

28
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:27,308
Her fun and games pushed you both
to break the law to fulfill her material needs.

29
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,976
She is toxic,

30
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:34,065
and today all of your transgressions
will be made public.

31
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,691
He's fucking lying, Brad.

32
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,779
Now you must choose who
will drop out of this triangle,

33
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,199
for within 60 seconds one of you must die.

34
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,745
If you wish to save her,
then the saws must be pushed

35
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,665
all the way to one side or the other,

36
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:55,586
sparing her while proving for good
who is indeed the alpha male.

37
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,255
What are you fucking staring at,
you motherfuckers?

38
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,591
- Do something!
- Are you both strong enough

39
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,427
to walk away from what is destroying you,

40
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:07,306
or will you fight one more time
for the heart that binds?

41
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,267
You have 60 seconds to decide.

42
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,104
Live or die. Make your choice.

43
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,149
Oh, fuck!

44
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,409
One of you save me!

45
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,793
What the fuck are you doing?

46
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,587
It's me or you asshole,
and it sure as shit isn't gonna be me.

47
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:52,893
Brad. Brad.

48
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,146
Brad, I love you.

49
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,565
I love you too, baby.

50
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,775
Do it. You gotta do it.

51
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,736
- What?
- You gotta kill him, Brad.

52
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,904
- Do it!
- Stupid bitch!

53
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,449
Do it. Do it! Do it!

54
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,170
Fuck!

55
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:23,424
You love him?

56
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,925
No, no.

57
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,469
You love him more than me?

58
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,763
No, I had to say that.

59
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,848
I've always loved you.

60
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,476
You got to do it for me, please.

61
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,437
You got to kill him. Kill Brad! Do it!

62
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,939
You lying slut!

63
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,442
What the fuck are you doing?

64
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,651
You don't love anybody!

65
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,072
You're a cheat and a liar. Fuck you!

66
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,448
Fuck you!

67
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
Brad! Brad, look at me!

68
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,830
Is the chick that fucked me in your bed
two days ago worth one of our lives?

69
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,416
She's not worth it, man. She's not worth it.

70
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,210
Right?

71
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,379
Yeah!

72
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,840
What are you doing, you fucking asshole?

73
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,176
I think we're breaking up with you, Dina.

74
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,181
No! No, stop!

75
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,232
- Stand aside!
- Move it!

76
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,115
People, get out of the way.

67
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:03,458
SAW 3D

77
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,552
Somebody help her.

78
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,789
Game over.

79
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,333
No! No, you fucking bitch!

80
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,002
No!

81
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,189
Tonight, a house of horrors
has been discovered

82
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,609
at what used to be known
as the Rowan Zoological Institute.

83
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:15,072
The body of Umbrella Health CEO
William Easton has been identified

84
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,575
as one of the several victims
of this grizzly crime scene.

85
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,995
However, we have also been
informed that there may be

86
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,667
Hopefully the many questions
of the local police,

87
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,087
the FBI, and the victims'
family members may be answered

88
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,298
by those seven civilians lucky enough

89
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,675
to walk away from
this unprecedented display

90
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,802
of carnage with their lives.

91
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:41,348
We now go live to Tony Gabrielson
who is reporting from the scene. Tony.

92
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,315
- Hey, man.
- Hey, what's up?

93
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,278
- What have we got here?
- That's Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's widow.

94
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,487
What does she want?

95
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,489
All she said was that
she didn't trust the FBI,

96
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,492
- and she didn't trust homicide.
- Good.

97
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,370
And she just wants to talk to you.

98
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,416
- Why me?
- I don't know. Only you, though.

99
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,714
She looks crazier than a sack full of cats.

100
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,218
All right, let's get this over with.

101
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,727
Hey. I put cream and sugar in it.

102
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,521
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

103
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,066
I'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs.

104
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,568
My colleague said that you
wanted to speak with me.

105
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,736
Yes.

106
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,114
But I need complete immunity.

107
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,202
Why do you want immunity, Miss Tuck?

108
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,830
Because of what I know.

109
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,957
Which is what?

110
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,127
Do we have a deal?

111
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,924
You've got to give before you can receive
in this house, Jill.

112
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,846
My husband John, he had an accomplice.

113
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,517
A person who assisted him
with almost every murder.

114
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,018
Look, don't get me wrong.

115
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:12,231
I'm all ears if you've got something legit
that you want to put on the table.

116
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,735
This person will go on killing
until he's stopped.

117
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,948
- You know him and he definitely knows you.
- Is that right?

118
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,742
He's detective Mark Hoffman.

119
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,496
Are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit?

120
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,289
Yes.

121
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,083
You swear to be totally open?

122
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,961
You tell me everything,
no matter how personal or private?

123
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,129
Yes.

124
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,298
I'll give you evidence, whatever you want,

125
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,137
as long as I have your protection,
and complete immunity.

126
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,556
Do we have a deal?

127
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,016
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.

128
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,389
Welcome back!

129
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,559
We're live with Bobby Dagen
whose national tour

130
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,437
S.U.R.V.I.V.E.
My Story of Overcoming Jigsaw

131
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,689
rolls into town this weekend.

132
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,026
Well, you're quite the national phenomenon
these days, aren't you?

133
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,528
Well, thank you, ma'am.

134
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,448
It's quite flattering how many people
have responded to my story.

135
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,620
And if I can help a few people along the way,
then I'm pleased.

136
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:54,082
Now, you survived a trap created
by the infamous Jigsaw killer, correct?

137
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,459
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,046
Well, everyone must ask you this question.
What was that like?

139
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,008
Life changing.

140
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,302
It was something I never anticipated

141
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,971
and, quite honestly, something
that should have killed me.

142
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,725
Tell me more.
Tell me about the actual experience.

143
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,770
I actually have no recollection
of how I got there.

144
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,481
I just remember the feeling

145
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,900
of waking up trapped.

146
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,780
And I had to insert two hooks
into my pectoral muscles

147
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,365
and hoist myself up to a platform.

148
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,783
You put the hooks in yourself?

149
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,409
I did.

150
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,788
I pretty much realized
that I couldn't hold on much longer,

151
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,585
and I had to accept the fact
that I was going to die.

152
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,879
And then I saw something,

153
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,506
and what I saw was my life.

154
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,885
It was a tragedy. I achieved nothing.

155
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:53,433
And right then,
something inside me started to grow,

156
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,062
something from the bottom of my soul.

157
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,066
And I just... I decided to live.

158
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,069
I found a strength that I thought
had long since expired.

159
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,863
And I just yanked, and I yanked!

160
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:10,200
And when I got to the top,
I just ripped the hooks out of my chest.

161
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:14,037
There was blood everywhere,
and I just screamed.

162
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,708
I just sat there and screamed.

163
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,544
Because I hadn't just survived,

164
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,421
I was reborn.

165
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,464
This was my life.

166
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,764
Wow. Bobby Dagen, everyone.

167
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,892
Bobby's life-changing
experience comes to the...

168
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,644
This is the moment.

169
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,272
- Where's the big kiss?
- I don't know.

170
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,857
Tickets are still available.

171
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,859
And we're out, folks.

172
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,570
- That's not the way it's supposed to be.
- You need to relax.

173
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,113
No, we rehearsed it differently.

174
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,451
It's okay. Nice work, Bobby.

175
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,454
Ladies, can you excuse us for a minute?

176
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,291
Where was the big finish, Bobby?

177
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,917
You tell your story,
you thank your pretty wife,

178
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,294
you bring her out for a big hug and kiss.

179
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,962
I just didn't want to push it, all right?

180
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,839
Okay, but that's the heart of the story.

181
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,300
She was there for your whole recovery.

182
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,094
And without the acknowledgment,
without the kiss,

183
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,472
the audience isn't gonna have any kind
of emotional connection.

184
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,556
I disagree.

185
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,433
Too much emotion,
and it's gonna feel like pandering.

186
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,602
Okay, why don't you let me
do the public relations,

187
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,853
and you do the legal paperwork, okay?

188
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,731
Okay, I get it, Suzanne, all right?
It's my fault.

189
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,192
It wasn't your fault, Bobby.

190
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,777
You were fine.

191
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,654
- Just remember your bullet points next time.
- I will.

192
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,072
These interviews are important.

193
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,948
Nina, relax.

194
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,033
Don't worry about them.

195
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,785
You were great.

196
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,119
Yeah?

197
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,205
Your story's real and people feel that.

198
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,127
I know that you get overwhelmed at times,
but we have to keep moving forward, Bobby.

199
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,382
You were meant to do this.

200
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,721
I know. I know, baby.

201
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,808
- Bobby.
- Yeah?

202
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,601
We got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow.

203
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,478
Thirty minutes of face time
with other survivors.

204
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,605
Yeah, sounds good.

205
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,401
- Nothing more exciting than that.
- No, not much. Let's go.

206
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,319
Oh, God!

207
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,281
You want to know the only thing wrong
with killing you, Jill?

208
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,534
I can only do it once.

209
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,545
Oh, my God!

210
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:20,974
No!

211
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,337
Help me! Help me!

212
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,923
Help! Fuck!

213
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,594
Hello, Evan. I want to play a game.

214
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,306
The situation you find yourself in
is of your own doing.

215
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,852
You, your girlfriend,
and your friends are all racists.

216
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,314
Evan, you fuck. You get me out of here!

217
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,610
You have intimidated others
based on their physical differences.

218
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,947
But today it is you who will run scared.

219
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:21,159
Your pathetic friends
follow your every word, Evan.

220
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:27,499
Therefore you will be the only one capable
of saving them and yourself.

221
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:33,672
In 30 seconds,
the jacks holding up this car will fall,

222
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,301
setting off a deadly chain of events.

223
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,512
In order to stop this from happening,

224
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:45,976
you must tear yourself away
from the seat to which you are glued.

225
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,398
Then you must pull the red lever before you.
But no act comes without a sacrifice.

226
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,734
You've judged others
by the color of their skin,

227
00:19:54,819 --> 00:20:01,241
and today, Evan, you will learn
that we are all the same color on the inside.

228
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,619
Live or die, Evan, the choice is yours.

229
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,292
No!

230
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,967
- Evan, help!
- I can't.

231
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,763
- Do it. Fuck!
- Fucking do it!

232
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,348
Just fucking do it!

233
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,350
Do it! Do it, man!

234
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,518
Here I go!

235
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,484
Evan!

236
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,445
Baby, get me out of here!

237
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,740
Shit! Fuck! Here I go!

238
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,491
Here I go! Come on!

239
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,826
Fuck me!

240
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,957
Please!

241
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,595
- God!
- Do it! Fucking do it!

242
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,597
- God!
- Do it!

243
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,184
- Evan!
- You got us into this.

244
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,852
Get us the fuck out!

245
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,106
Do it!

246
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,236
You fucking pussy!

247
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,666
Shit.

248
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,113
Every night

249
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,368
I keep thinking that things will get better

250
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,288
the next morning when I wake up.

251
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,873
But it isn't.

252
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:16,543
Everything I do,

253
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,715
everything I see, I'm surrounded by these

254
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,843
tiny triggers.

255
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,678
They're everywhere,

256
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,097
and they remind me of what I went through,

257
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,558
what Jigsaw did to me.

258
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,479
Sidney, go on, please. You're...

259
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,149
You're in a safe place now.

260
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,692
Tell me what happened next.

261
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,655
Alex! Stop, please! Stop it!

262
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:02,964
Sidney, look at me.

263
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,926
You made a decision.

264
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,429
How did that make you feel?

265
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,930
Free.

266
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,642
He was abusive.

267
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,937
I tried to stop it before,

268
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,565
but it wasn't until that moment

269
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,942
that I really did something.

270
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,905
It was him or me, and I chose to live.

271
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,990
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

272
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,787
That's a bunch of bullshit.

273
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,290
He had to die for you to leave him?

274
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,796
You want to know
the best thing that happened to me

275
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,131
after having to cut off my own arm?

276
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,806
It's handicapped parking at the damn mall!

277
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:00,313
What the hell is a camera here for anyway?

278
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,902
I am simply here to illustrate the fact
that a traumatic experience,

279
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,447
such as the kind that each one of us
has been forced to endure,

280
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,283
can have a positive outcome. That's all.

281
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:14,285
Yeah? Like what?

282
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:19,165
A new perspective on life. Wait, wait, wait.

283
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,171
I know. I understand
that you're not at that place yet.

284
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,424
I understand that and I respect that.

285
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,176
But if you look around at all these people

286
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,512
taking their lives for granted,

287
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,642
eventually they all found something positive
from their experience.

288
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,186
We should never be ashamed
of what we've gone through,

289
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,022
because we are good and we are strong!

290
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,110
You know what?

291
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,822
I'd like everybody to have
a look at something right here.

292
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,200
These are my scars.

293
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,788
Because our minds will heal,

294
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,041
but these scars will never go away.

295
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,254
These scars should not be
a symbol of shame.

296
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,256
They should be worn as a badge of courage.

297
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,010
You know, earlier,

298
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:17,223
I spoke of valuing your loved ones.

299
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,976
But to be perfectly honest,

300
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,979
it's something that I never did
prior to my ordeal.

301
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,606
But since then,

302
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,652
I have found someone
who has truly become my rock.

303
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,907
Joyce, if you could...

304
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,367
Please.

305
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,497
It's my lovely wife Joyce.

306
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,710
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

307
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,348
Bravo.

308
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,393
To be able to sustain
such a traumatic experience,

309
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:06,773
and yet find the positive in that grizzly act,

310
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:09,943
it's a remarkable feat indeed.

311
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,447
Remarkable,

312
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,784
if not a little perverse.

313
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,122
I'm sure I speak for everyone
here when I say

314
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,750
how grateful we are

315
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:31,339
to be part of your promotional DVD.

316
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,140
I appreciate it. Thank you. It's...

317
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,650
- I can take that, sir.
- Thank you very much.

318
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,443
Joyce, can I borrow him for a second?

319
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,861
Sure. I'll be in the car, okay?

320
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,113
Two minutes behind you.

321
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,447
- Great.
- You'll see her to the car, please, sir?

322
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,366
- Of course.
- Thank you.

323
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,868
What's up?

324
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,454
So what's with the creepy guy with the
cane? Someone I should know about?

325
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,581
No, no, no. He's been at these meetings
longer than I have.

326
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,833
He's fine.

327
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,210
All right.

328
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,921
Listen, get back to the hotel,
and get some rest, all right?

329
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:14,007
Yeah. Everything's fine.

330
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,758
Great work tonight, Bobby.

331
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,552
- Thank you.
- You're the man.

332
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:32,859
Joyce?

333
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,533
What happened to him?

334
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,288
They always tell you not to smoke
at the gas station.

335
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,207
- This should wrap up the week for you.
- Great.

336
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,922
What's up, man?

337
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,717
I'm at a junkyard on 58th.

338
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,010
Why?

339
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,636
Call came in about a car crash.

340
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,889
Car crash? Why are you there?

341
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,766
It's not just a car crash.

342
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,142
It's a trap.

343
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,810
How many bodies?

344
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,063
Enough pieces to make four.

345
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,149
Okay, get everyone away
from that crime scene till I get there.

346
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,068
- Even Homicide, you got it?
- Yeah.

347
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,652
All right, I'm on the way.

348
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,283
Hello, Evan. I want to play a game.

349
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,911
The situation you find yourself in...

350
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,748
You, your girlfriend...

351
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:37,340
You have intimidated others
based on their physical differences.

352
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,776
So, what do you think?

353
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,444
Why?

354
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,780
Why this display?

355
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,366
Why them? Why now?

356
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,952
You know he likes to put on a show.

357
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,955
Well, there's gotta be something else.

358
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,841
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

359
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,176
We'll need them checked
for anything resembling a clue.

360
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,346
Tattoos, piercings, skin cuttings.

361
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,599
If that man has a cavity in his tooth,
I want to know about it.

362
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,934
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

363
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,269
Gibson.

364
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,146
Yeah?

365
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,189
Hoffman was expecting you.

366
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:39,986
God damn.

367
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,990
Would you look at that?

368
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,826
Please get forensics in here.

369
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,995
Tell them to haul ass.

370
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,330
This needs to be dusted for prints.

371
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,666
- All right.
- Okay.

372
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,327
Help!

373
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,888
Hello, Bobby.

374
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,891
I want to play a game.

375
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,479
You have amassed wealth, fame,
and notoriety,

376
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,398
based upon your story of survival.

377
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:04,320
Many have aided in your cause,
but few know the truth.

378
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,489
You are a liar.

379
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,367
You and I both know
you have never been in a trap,

380
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,869
nor have you ever been tested.

381
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:17,625
Today these lies will come full circle
and you will learn

382
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:22,672
if you truly have what it takes
to call yourself a survivor.

383
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,508
The cage you find yourself in

384
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,677
will symbolize your rebirth.

385
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:31,847
Joyce? No!

386
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,102
Joyce! No!

387
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,562
Please, no.

388
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,022
Within the next 60 minutes,

389
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:43,150
you must stay upon the path of learning

390
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,695
and traverse a series of obstacles

391
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,947
to obtain access to your wife,

392
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,991
who you have also deceived.

393
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,160
If you fail to reach her
before the clock runs out,

394
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,996
- she will die.
- No.

395
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,664
Live or die, Bobby?

396
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,124
Make your choice.

397
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,823
Bobby!

398
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,079
Help!

399
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,415
Let me out!

400
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,635
Bobby.

401
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,972
Bobby! What's going on? What's going on?

402
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,351
Another Jigsaw survivor has come forward.

403
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,979
As the city stays crippled in fear
from the Jigsaw killings,

404
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,692
chilling new words from
the latest survivor provide a reminder

405
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,362
of the physical and mental toll
these deadly games can take.

406
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:56,075
This horrible event was happening to me,

407
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,328
and in that moment,

408
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,540
that moment that this thing

409
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,584
threatened to take everything away,

410
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,753
even the pain,

411
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,134
I realized what I still had left to give.

412
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,220
And I didn't want to let that go.

413
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,932
It gave me light.

414
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:25,813
That pure moment
of absolute horror gave me light.

415
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,274
And as wrong as this may seem,

416
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,610
I'm better for enduring it.

417
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,405
I'm stronger.

418
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,658
And, I must admit, I'm grateful for it.

419
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,911
I'm grateful it happened to me,

420
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,331
and I wish the same for everyone like me.

421
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,626
Joan is but one of a growing
number of citizens...

422
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:51,797
If something like that doesn't get you
to change your perspective on life,

423
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,175
I don't know what will.

424
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,594
Yeah.

425
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,223
And if those people weren't so fucked up
after their games,

426
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,934
they'd make a mint selling their stories.

427
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,711
That's a real clever design.

428
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,215
Yours or your husband's?

429
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,050
- Everything was him.
- Right.

430
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,385
Well, here's my problem,

431
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:23,055
that was left for me,
and your fingerprints were all over it.

432
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,058
When you told me Hoffman had it in for you,

433
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,978
you didn't mention that
it was because you tried to kill him.

434
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,899
There's a new game going on.

435
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,568
Does that surprise you?

436
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,363
- No.
- No? No?

437
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,783
You're crazy, you know that?

438
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,828
I knew you were crazy
the minute I laid eyes on you.

439
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,079
Crazy.

440
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:52,251
Okay, this is what we're gonna do, crazy.

441
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,963
Till I catch Mark Hoffman,
this is your new home.

442
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,756
Get comfy.

443
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,467
What makes you think he can't find me here?

444
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,636
Jill, it's a safe house.

445
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,264
Safe house. Safe. House.

446
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,141
You get it?

447
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:14,481
Gibson, this was sent here addressed to Jill.

448
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:18,235
- Hoffman knows our location.
- God damn it. God damn it!

449
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,195
What?

450
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,782
We just had a small explosion here in a car
at the crime scene.

451
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:24,992
Okay, is anyone hurt?

452
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,452
Holy shit!

453
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:35,961
Rogers?

454
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,379
Rogers, you okay?

455
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,422
Yeah.

456
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,424
Get out of there.
You get the bomb squad to sweep the yard.

457
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,801
Don't touch anything else until it's clean.

458
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,304
- Got it.
- All right.

459
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,932
Play it.

460
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,272
Hello, Gibson.

461
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,608
Been a long time.

462
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,652
What I want is simple,

463
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,153
give me Jill Tuck.

464
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,489
You're protecting her despite the fact

465
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,157
that she had direct knowledge throughout,

466
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,161
which makes her complicit in every death.

467
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,747
I'll make you a deal.

468
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,332
Give her to me,

469
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,335
the game stops, and no one else dies.

470
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:21,006
If not, everyone dies and you'll be to blame.

471
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,093
Make your choice.

472
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,678
The clock is ticking.

473
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,641
Let's get her down to the holding cell
at the station.

474
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,602
Lock it down.
No one gets in without my authority.

475
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:34,853
Got it.

476
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,707
Oh, my God.

477
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,167
Oh, God!

478
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,585
No! Please!

479
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,506
No! Please, help! Please!

480
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,133
Please, no!

481
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,551
God damn it!

482
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,637
Bobby. Bobby, help me!

483
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,681
You've got to get me out of here.

484
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,600
I can't move, Bobby.

485
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,227
Please, help me!

486
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,229
Okay, okay, okay. Just relax.

487
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,987
Help me! Do something!

488
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,574
Don't leave me.

489
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,660
Hello, Bobby.

490
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,872
Before you
is one of your trusted colleagues.

491
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:39,710
She has been your publicist for years,
knowing your lies

492
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,212
but choosing to speak no evil.

493
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,340
She has been richly rewarded for her words,

494
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:49,428
but today she will be rewarded
for her silence.

495
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,347
In the X-ray, you will see a key,

496
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:57,269
the key to Nina's survival,
which will shut off her device.

497
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:58,854
But there's a catch.

498
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,982
You have one minute
to pull the fish hook from her stomach,

499
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,609
and unlock her device

500
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,155
or else the four spikes
will penetrate her throat,

501
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,908
- silencing Nina forever.
- Fuck!

502
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,243
Remember, the spikes will also advance

503
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:18,332
each time the decibel level in this room
rises above a whisper,

504
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,292
killing her even sooner.

505
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,463
Will Nina live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.

506
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,551
- Help me. Help!
- No! No!

507
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,807
Just shut up.

508
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,935
Stay with me, okay?

509
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,025
Do it.

510
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,493
No. No. No.

511
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,788
Okay, stay with me. Stay with me.

512
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,456
It's gonna be okay. Look at me.

513
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,582
Look at me.

514
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,931
No! Nina, quiet. Nina.

515
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,599
Please. Please, for me.

516
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,309
Just shut the fuck up.

517
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,562
I'm gonna get this out.

518
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,077
No! No!

519
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,081
Just do it, Bobby. Just fucking do it.

520
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,651
Bobby!

521
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,087
No!

522
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,759
Why wouldn't you just shut the fuck up?

523
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,638
You just needed to shut up!

524
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:44,269
No! Oh, my God!

525
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,773
No! Help!

526
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,029
Help! Help!

527
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,355
Here you are, ma'am. Take care.

528
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,650
Ma'am, your name?

529
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,486
Sara, without an "H."

530
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,657
I just want to say I love your book so much.

531
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,994
I just felt like I could feel everything
that you went through.

532
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,288
I feel like it changed my life.

533
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,206
I appreciate that, ma'am.

534
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,835
I really do. Thank you.

535
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,838
Thank you.

536
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,097
Your name, sir?

537
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,181
John.

538
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,269
With an "H," without an "H,"
it doesn't matter.

539
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,813
We'll go with John with an "H" this time.

540
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,524
You got quite an army working for you here,
don't you?

541
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,110
Must be spreading a pretty good word.

542
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,488
Well, we try to reach as many
people as possible, you know?

543
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,782
You don't see anything wrong with that?

544
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,493
No. No, sir, I don't.

545
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,623
You know,

546
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,710
history is a passion for me.

547
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,963
And in ancient Egypt
if you were speaking under oath,

548
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,465
you were required to say,

549
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:41,470
"If I'm lying, take me to the quarries."

550
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,807
That mean anything to you?

551
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:48,310
No, sir. No, sir, it doesn't.

552
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,771
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

553
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,399
It means if you knowingly lied
on the public record

554
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,819
that you were subject
to a period of enslavement.

555
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,738
What are you implying here, sir?

556
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,406
I'm not implying anything.

557
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,242
Move along, buddy. He signed your book.

558
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,704
Thanks for the signature.

559
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,208
Nice picture, but I don't need it.

560
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,585
We've met.

561
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,975
Adam, Gibson says he wants
you on these right away.

562
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,268
They're from the junkyard.

563
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,442
Make your choice.

564
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,361
The clock is ticking.

565
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,238
See that?

566
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:43,365
Yeah.

567
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,451
I know that from somewhere.

568
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,080
Hey, I've got something over here.

569
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:54,709
We might know who's in the game.
This was just sent to us.

570
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,796
It was taken
from a security camera downtown.

571
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,548
The guy's name is Bobby Dagen.

572
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:00,799
- Familiar?
- No.

573
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,261
He's a Jigsaw survivor
who's milking it on talk shows.

574
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,305
His wife and handlers are also missing.

575
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,085
Joyce?

576
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,297
Who is it? Who's there?

577
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,340
- Suzanne.
- Who is that?

578
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:44,342
For fuck's sake, Bobby. Bobby.

579
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,094
Bobby, get me out of here.

580
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,429
Bobby, help me.

581
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,598
- Is Cale here?
- Who the fuck knows?

582
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:52,851
Get this off of me, Bobby! Get this off of me!

583
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,483
Hello, Bobby.

584
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:03,612
That feeling running
through your body is fear,

585
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:07,699
the fear of not knowing
if you have what it takes to survive.

586
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,659
Before you is your lawyer

587
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,286
who swore an oath of ethics,

588
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:16,333
but chose to see no evil
in order to benefit herself.

589
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,460
Once her device begins to rotate,

590
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,879
it will pierce her eyes and mouth

591
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:24,841
if you don't delay its movement
for at least 30 seconds.

592
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:25,967
To do this,

593
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:31,014
you must step into the other machine
and lift the bars to the highest position

594
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:35,685
long enough to close the circuit,
slowing down her device.

595
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,855
If you do nothing, she will wind to her death

596
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,440
before the clock runs out.

597
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,068
Do you have what it takes to help her?

598
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,486
Make your choice.

599
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,363
Bobby, please!

600
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,240
Bobby, please get me out!

601
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,741
Get me the fuck...

602
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,285
Oh, God!

603
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,747
No, no! Bobby, please!

604
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,667
Please, help me!

605
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,213
Oh, God! Oh, God!

606
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,465
Please, hurry! Hurry!

607
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,261
Come on, Bobby, please! Hurry!

608
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,513
Come on! Bobby, come on!

609
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:15,433
Hurry! Please! Please, hurry!

610
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,567
Bobby, please, hurry!

611
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,693
Hurry!

612
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,326
Yes! Yes, Bobby! Yes!

613
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,162
Come on!

614
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,540
Bobby, no.

615
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,634
No! God, no!

616
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,553
No! Bobby!

617
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:54,514
Please, no! Bobby, no!

618
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,934
Come on, Bobby. Please!
Get me out of here!

619
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,644
Come on!

620
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,147
Bobby, please!

621
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,315
No!

622
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:04,649
Oh, God.

623
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,360
Oh, my God. Bobby, stay there.

624
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,825
Bobby, please, no!

625
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,827
No! No!

626
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,625
No!

627
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,671
Please, please!

628
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:27,922
No!

629
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,341
Oh, God!

630
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,345
Oh, my God.

631
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,350
No. No.

632
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,644
Help!

633
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,492
Do you know this guy?

634
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,040
I've seen him on TV, but I don't know him.

635
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:47,669
Did your husband?

636
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:49,254
I don't know.

637
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,091
You sure you don't know him?

638
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,428
Yeah, I'm sure.

639
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,805
All right then.

640
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,060
Lock it up.

641
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,772
Hoffman just sent an e-mail
with an MPEG attachment.

642
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:10,150
I'm just searching the IP address.

643
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,776
Can you find out where it came from?

644
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:15,530
It depends on how many proxy servers
he filtered it through,

645
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,241
but it was time-delayed,
so it'll leave fingerprints.

646
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,367
Play it.

647
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,203
Hello, Gibson.

648
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,248
Once again, we're at a moral crossroad.

649
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,543
I don't blame you
for not giving me Jill Tuck,

650
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,171
but you shouldn't let an old grudge
cloud yourjudgment.

651
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,632
Look to where you're being led.

652
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,302
Look beyond the crossroad
to the clear dawn.

653
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,638
Do you see it?

654
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,311
I get it. Let's go.

655
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,164
Joyce?

656
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:25,934
Cale?

657
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,477
Bobby? Bobby?

658
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,313
Listen to me. Cale.
Cale, I can see you, okay?

659
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,899
- Cale, don't move.
- Bobby, where the hell are you?

660
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,109
- You got to help me, Bobby.
- Do you know where Joyce is?

661
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,611
What the fuck? I can't see, man.

662
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,904
How the fuck would I know where Joyce is?

663
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,113
I'm about to lose my shit!

664
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,074
Do I know where Joyce is?
I'm fucking blind, man.

665
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,201
Okay, Cale. Cale, do not move.

666
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,703
I got this thing around my fucking neck.
I can't fucking breathe.

667
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:48,039
Don't fucking move.
We're not on the ground floor.

668
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,374
A lot of this floor is missing.

669
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,417
Just don't move, okay?

670
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,503
Fuck. You gotta help me.

671
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:57,924
Get me fucking down, Bobby! Fuck!
Fuck me!

672
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,259
Cale, there's a tape.

673
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,928
- What fucking tape?
- There's a tape.

674
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,596
Shut up. I'm gonna play the tape.

675
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:11,855
Hello, Bobby.
Across from you is your closest friend.

676
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:17,652
He knows all your sins,
yet he acts as though he hears no evil.

677
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,821
Today, what he hears

678
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,324
will be the difference
between life and death.

679
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,661
Bobby, you must help
Cale walk over the planks,

680
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,997
and get as close to you as possible.

681
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:32,959
Find your own way across
the beams to the key.

682
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:37,171
You must get it to him over
the last span between you.

683
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:41,843
If the noose around Cale's neck
is not removed within 60 seconds,

684
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:46,431
a winch will be engaged,
and your secret will be left hanging.

685
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:50,393
Does Cale live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.

686
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,769
Bobby!

687
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:52,937
Oh, God.

688
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,940
Cale. Cale, listen to me.

689
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,358
Listen to me.

690
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,527
Shut the fuck up
and you listen to me for once.

691
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,530
Listen, I'm gonna walk you through this,
okay, buddy?

692
00:54:02,615 --> 00:54:04,198
I'm blind. You fucking come to me.

693
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,284
I'm gonna try to get as close to you
as I can, buddy.

694
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,536
I'm fucking listening to you.
Talk me fucking through this.

695
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,955
I want you to shuffle to your right.

696
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,124
Just shuffle exactly to your right.

697
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,294
You're gonna feel a plank at your foot.
Yes, yes.

698
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,339
Yes, yes, perfect.
I need you to head out on that plank.

699
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,465
- Oh, fuck.
- Yes.

700
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,509
Okay, I got it. I got it. I got it!

701
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:27,096
Fuck this.

702
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,098
Okay, Cale, I'm on the way.

703
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,976
Fuck. Fuck. Okay, all right.

704
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,312
Now there's gonna be a plank
in front of you.

705
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,022
- Okay.
- You're gonna have to go

706
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,649
about 10 degrees to your right.

707
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,192
I got it. I got it.

708
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,569
- Come on, keep fucking talking to me.
- Okay. Okay, Cale.

709
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:44,197
- Feel where the plank...
- I got it.

710
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,740
Okay.

711
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,826
Oh, God! What the fuck was that, man?

712
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,454
It's okay, Cale. It was a bottle.
It was a bottle.

713
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,248
- What the fuck was that?
- It's okay. It was a bottle.

714
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,834
- You're gonna be fine.
- Okay.

715
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,462
Fuck. Okay.

716
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,755
You got it, buddy.

717
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,925
You got it.
Now you're gonna feel a second plank.

718
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:07,178
- You'll feel it with your foot.
- I got it.

719
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,388
Feel it with your foot.

720
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,142
Get me out of this fucking thing, Bobby.

721
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,727
Step up onto the plank.

722
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,023
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

723
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,150
Relax. You're okay.

724
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,531
No! No!

725
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,700
Cale, hang on. Cale.

726
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:39,377
Fuck. Fuck.

727
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:54,559
Bobby. Bobby.

728
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,947
I got the key but... Cale!

729
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,116
I'm gonna throw you the key.

730
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,368
Cup your hands closer to your chest!

731
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,454
I'm gonna throw it on three, all right?

732
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,458
One,

733
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,251
two,

734
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,335
three.

735
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:28,885
No.

736
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,889
Oh, fuck me.

737
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,437
No! God damn it, no!

738
00:56:42,274 --> 00:56:43,441
Cale!

739
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,201
No. Cale.

740
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:07,715
There's nothing here.

741
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,300
Yes, there is.

742
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,427
Right there.

743
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:18,559
Why would he want us to come here?

744
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,812
For me to remember.

745
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,356
This is where he saved my life.

746
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:28,236
When I was in uniform
I responded to a distress call here.

747
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:32,657
Back when this place was a flophouse
forjunkies and homeless people.

748
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:52,802
Freeze! Don't you fucking move.

749
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,347
Drop the gun.

750
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,275
He didn't know what hit him.

751
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:13,531
Yeah, he assaulted me,
but it shouldn't have been a death sentence.

752
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,915
Next time, you shoot first.

753
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,504
I had no choice
but to report Hoffman for brutality.

754
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:29,755
You owe me.

755
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,720
What happened?

756
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:42,435
He got a promotion is what happened.
And I got put on an island.

757
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,022
A year later, I transferred to IA,
busted three of his guys.

758
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:49,734
He swore he'd get me back, and here we are.

759
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:54,906
This place was called
Crossroads Manufacturing before it closed.

760
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,993
"Look beyond the crossroads

761
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,580
"to the clear dawn."

762
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,832
I don't follow you.

763
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:08,544
The man he killed was released from
Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital

764
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,463
when the state shut it down.

765
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,256
That building's been abandoned for years.

766
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,343
That's where the game is being played.

767
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:18,179
All right, you get back,
you stay with Jill Tuck.

768
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,598
Don't let her out of your sight.

769
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,076
Bobby!

770
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,705
- Joyce?
- Bobby. Bobby!

771
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,250
Bobby, I'm here.

772
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,127
- Joyce.
- Bobby, can you hear me?

773
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:52,046
Joyce, I can hear you. I can see you.

774
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,798
Bobby, I can see you, too.

775
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,050
Yes, baby.

776
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:59,303
- Get me out of here.
- Baby, I'm on my way.

777
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,555
Who's doing this? Why?

778
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,350
- Why is this happening?
- Please, baby, I'm on the way.

779
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,853
- Just hang on, okay?
- Hurry. Please hurry.

780
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,648
There's got to be a tape.

781
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:12,692
Hello, Bobby.

782
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:16,570
Before you is the door
that leads to your wife.

783
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,991
However, you must first make a choice.

784
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:24,662
As you may have guessed, your decision
will be as difficult as pulling teeth.

785
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,626
The lock before you requires
a four-digit combination to open.

786
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,796
However, if it is access you seek

787
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,383
then a true sacrifice will have to be made.

788
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:40,678
Watch and learn, Bobby.

789
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,520
The necessary numbers have been etched
onto two of your teeth.

790
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,734
Look to the chart as a reference
for which teeth to pull

791
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,737
and in which order to enter the digits.

792
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,115
Time is ticking down.

793
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,159
You must make your decision quickly.

794
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,332
Bobby!

795
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,627
I don't want you to see this, baby, okay?

796
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,129
Oh, my God.

797
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,258
No.

798
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,762
No!

799
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,389
Left side clear.

800
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,683
Clear.

801
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,227
- Clear.
- Clear.

802
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:31,812
Change your position.

803
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:35,149
The game's still on.

804
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:47,411
- Let's go.
- Move to the second level.

805
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:56,420
- Clear.
- Clear.

806
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:58,923
Clear.

807
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,299
Go.

808
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,109
- Clear up.
- All clear.

809
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,402
Move, move.

810
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,447
- Moving in.
- Moving in.

811
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,533
- Clear.
- We're clear.

812
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,126
Block it off.

813
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:38,462
- What?
- I found where that MPEG came from.

814
01:02:38,547 --> 01:02:40,714
- Where?
- A business called Pete's Auto Body

815
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,091
on 58th Street.

816
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,718
- The junkyard.
- The location of the car trap?

817
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:46,303
Yeah, that's correct.

818
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,266
Okay, you guys keep moving.

819
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,725
Where are you going?

820
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:53,227
To get Hoffman.

821
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,187
Okay, let's move it.

822
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:03,154
Rogers.

823
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:08,909
Yeah.

824
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,037
What? What happened?

825
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,999
Gibson's got Hoffman's location.

826
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:18,419
The game isn't over.

827
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:34,143
Another body.

828
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:37,938
Hold.

829
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,152
We got a live one.

830
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:02,338
Can't cross here. Let's go.

831
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,469
Hey. Go get your shotguns.
You come follow me.

832
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:09,446
Give me your gun.

833
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,721
Hoffman, freeze.

834
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,348
I want you to slowly put your hands
in the air.

835
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,400
Joyce.

836
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,484
Bobby.

837
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:50,195
Bobby, I knew you'd make it.

838
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:52,948
I knew you'd find me.

839
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:54,283
I am so sorry.

840
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,993
I knew you could do it.

841
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,995
I knew you'd come.

842
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,330
Get me out.

843
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,668
Bobby. Oh, my God.

844
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:07,004
There's gotta be another way.

845
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:15,179
Hello, Bobby.
You have almost completed your rebirth.

846
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:19,642
However, your final task
will be your most difficult.

847
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:23,145
The woman before you
symbolizes your success.

848
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,688
She is your trophy.

849
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:27,441
And she has seen the good
in your message,

850
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,693
despite its dishonest beginnings.

851
01:06:29,778 --> 01:06:31,195
What's he talking about?

852
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:35,407
Today, we will see
if you can truly earn her love.

853
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,578
To prove your status as a survivor,

854
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:44,041
you must overcome a game
that should be all too familiar.

855
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:47,586
- No.
- You supposedly survived it once already,

856
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:51,590
so it should be easy to survive once again.

857
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,802
Pierce the hooks
through your chest muscles,

858
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,387
and the game will begin.

859
01:06:56,471 --> 01:07:01,517
In order to free yourself and your wife,
you must hoist yourself with these chains,

860
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:07,481
and connect the extension cords above you
before the clock expires.

861
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:13,612
Both hands will be needed
to complete this task.

862
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,572
But that should be simple.

863
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:18,450
For, as you claim to understand,

864
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:22,121
the pectoral muscles
can easily support your weight.

865
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:23,956
So I ask you, Bobby,

866
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,292
when you embrace every day
as if it is your last,

867
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,920
will it be with your wife?

868
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,548
Make your choice.

869
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,467
What's he talking about?

870
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,302
Baby, I'm so sorry.

871
01:07:39,848 --> 01:07:40,848
I lied.

872
01:07:43,143 --> 01:07:44,852
I was never in a trap.

873
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,234
Clear.

874
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,635
How could you let me believe that?

875
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:20,971
I'm gonna make this right.

876
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,891
You don't deserve to be there.

877
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,061
I'm your wife.

878
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,647
How could you lie to me?

879
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,366
I know that from somewhere.

880
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,828
Make your choice. Clock's ticking.

881
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,425
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

882
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,678
What is this, sir?

883
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:05,432
Hoffman tapped
into the station's security system.

884
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:07,351
He's been watching us the whole time.

885
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,549
Oh, my God.

886
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:46,223
- This is Palmer.
- Listen.

887
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,392
You get every available officer
back to the station.

888
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:49,476
I'm sorry, sir?

889
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:50,894
Right now.

890
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,272
Sir.

891
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:13,458
Gibson, are you still there? Gibson.

892
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:07,930
- Door's locked!
- We're locked in!

893
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:12,434
Gas! Gas!

894
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:13,852
Look for an exit.

895
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,833
I love you, Joyce.

896
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,671
I never lied about that.

897
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,632
I love you. I love you.

898
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,384
Bobby, I love you.

899
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:52,516
No! Oh, my God.

900
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:02,109
No.

901
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:09,199
Gibson.

902
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:24,631
You can do it. You can do it.

903
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:30,929
Oh, my God.

904
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,812
Bobby, I love you.

905
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:56,413
You can do it.

906
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,419
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

907
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:06,256
Pull. Pull, Bobby. I know you can do it.

908
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,008
Pull.

909
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:11,553
Oh, my God. Keep going.

910
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:14,514
Bobby, you can do it. Oh, my God.

911
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:15,766
Bobby!

912
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,101
Pull!

913
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,460
What was that?

914
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:46,129
That's it, pull. Pull!

915
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,257
Pull.

916
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:52,803
Hurry!

917
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,223
Pull. You're almost there.

918
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,521
Fight, Bobby. You can do it.

919
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,565
Someone's out there.

920
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,492
Oh, my God. No!

921
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,953
Help me! Help me!

922
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,581
Help me! No!

923
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,217
I've been looking for you.

924
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,032
How do I look?

925
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:04,916
Bitch.

926
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:08,879
Help me!

927
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,217
Bobby, please, reach.

928
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:16,720
Go.

929
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,389
Bobby, reach.

930
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:21,641
Hurry.

931
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,810
Reach. Reach!

932
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:25,395
You can do it, Bobby.

933
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,493
Bobby, reach. Reach.

934
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,415
One more. Reach. You can do it. Bobby!

935
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,000
Bobby, you can do it.

936
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,467
Bobby!

937
01:16:59,991 --> 01:17:00,991
No!

938
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,494
Bobby!

939
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:11,001
No. Bobby!

940
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:13,753
Joyce!

941
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:18,508
Bobby!

942
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:20,927
Joyce!

943
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:22,429
Bobby! Bobby!

944
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:29,686
Joyce! Joyce!

945
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,107
Bobby!

946
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:50,623
You fucking cunt.

947
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:58,256
No! Bobby!

948
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:06,222
Joyce!

949
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:09,392
No!

950
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:22,572
Bobby!

951
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:34,959
Joyce!

952
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:00,003
Game over.

953
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,105
Over the last two hours,

954
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:22,400
it seems our entire city
has been shaken to its core.

955
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:25,278
In addition to the nine police
employees killed tonight,

956
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:28,865
Jill Tuck, the wife of serial killer
John Kramer, has been found dead.

957
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,327
Citizens are being advised
to report any activity,

958
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,787
even remotely suspicious, at this time,

959
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,624
as blockades are being set up
at major intersections

960
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,334
within a 30-mile radius,

961
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:42,712
surrounding what will be considered
the largest attack

962
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,548
on this city's police department
in our history.

963
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:49,761
Any citizens with information
leading to the apprehension...

964
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:24,837
What the fuck?

965
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,691
Hello, Dr. Gordon.

966
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,611
You are perhaps my greatest asset.

967
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:06,296
Congratulations, Dr. Gordon. You survived.

968
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:26,566
Without you, my work over the last few years
would not have been possible.

969
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,159
Jeff's wife.

970
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,244
Dr. Lynn Denlon.

971
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,042
She'll be perfect.

972
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,009
My eyes! I can't see!

973
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:11,402
That having been said, I have a request.

974
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:12,945
Watch over Jill.

975
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:19,911
And should anything happen to her,
I want you to act immediately on my behalf.

976
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:25,208
In return for that,
I will keep no more secrets from you.

977
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,587
I've shown you a lot of places.

978
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:35,760
But there is one that will be, perhaps,
the most meaningful to you.

979
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:17,427
I don't think so.

980
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:30,273
What do you think you're doing?

981
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,610
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

982
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:45,997
