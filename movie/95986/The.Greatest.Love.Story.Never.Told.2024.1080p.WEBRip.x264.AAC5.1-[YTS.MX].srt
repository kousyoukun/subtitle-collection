00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,103
- Do you think I look fat?
- Too skinny.

00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,130
Anthony Ramos was gonna do this.
The guy from <i>In the Heights</i>.

5
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,426
He was going to do the "Rebound" number
with me. "The Glass House."

6
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,263
And he was like,
"Ah, I'm friends with Marc."

7
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm not even playing me in this.

8
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,765
There's a protagonist, this woman,
that goes on this journey.

9
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,726
He's like, "Yeah, I think that people are
gonna think that... You know how media is."

10
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,015
Shit, what happened? She fall apart again?

11
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:53,373
Elaine is the quiet one in my universe.
She doesn't talk.

12
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:46,963
We don't have 200,000 extra,
because we're gonna need 200,000 extra.

13
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,381
We're going to need

14
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,342
the extra money for post.

15
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:13,943
You want me to do it like you just did it?

16
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,734
Is that what you do?

17
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:45,667
Don't make me cry.

18
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,297
You put all this together yourself.

19
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:21,174
No "we" about it.

20
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:24,260
No fucking "we" about any of it.

21
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,329
Love is not something that you do,

22
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:17,248
it's something that you can become.

23
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:20,960
It's lifelong.

24
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,044
It goes on...

25
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:26,299
Whether you like it or you don't like it,

26
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:29,051
you'll end up loving something,
if not somebody.
