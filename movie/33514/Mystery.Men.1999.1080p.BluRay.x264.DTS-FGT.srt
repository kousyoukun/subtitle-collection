1
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,713
Would you like something sweet?

2
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:49,750
What do we got here, an antique show?

3
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,710
All right, boys, fan out.

4
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,190
What a wrinkle-fest this is.

5
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:01,199
Beat it, you broads. Come on.

6
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:04,248
All right, sit down and shut up.

7
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,560
We're the Red Eyes. Everybody, freeze.

8
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,272
Get their valuables, boys.
I want watches, wallets, jewelry.

9
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:15,622
Get me some silver chains.
I want wigs and toupees.

10
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:20,433
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

11
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:22,324
Rolex.
- No, it's mine.

12
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,285
Leave me alone. I'm a veteran.

13
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:27,136
No. Not that.

14
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:30,429
I love crashing parties.

15
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,685
Cake.

16
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,399
Pardon me, fatty.

17
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:46,140
If you're going to eat cake,
you ought to use a fork.

18
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,300
you might just as well shovel it in.

19
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:56,317
People who don't close their mouths
when they chew...

20
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:58,417
...make me furious.

21
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,095
One for you.

22
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:12,764
And for you.

23
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:21,051
Want a little whipped cream,
Mr. Cherry Top?

24
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,775
Get him.

25
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:27,863
Is that all you got?

26
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:38,573
Throw it.
- Not today, my vermilion-eyed varlet.

27
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:41,987
Blast.

28
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:44,087
Out of the way.

29
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:56,811
yes, this one should stick.

30
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:01,313
Oh, my.

31
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:04,611
That's right up the Khyber.

32
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,629
It's Captain Amazing.

33
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:29,766
It's Amazing. I'm out of here.

34
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:54,156
C.A., you were, if I may say, amazing.

35
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,887
yeah?
- yeah. Let's go meet the press.

36
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,025
He is good.

37
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,651
He is rather ripping.

38
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:05,404
The spinning and the hurtling
and the kicking.

39
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:08,991
I guarantee he hogs the credit on this one.

40
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,451
I think we have to...

41
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,329
...at least concede him the assist here, Roy.

42
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:16,207
No. That's exactly what's holding us back.

43
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:19,168
Don't put him on the pedestal.
Put us on the pedestal.

44
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:21,268
Here he comes.

45
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:25,216
Bravo and huzzah, Captain.
Splendid work, as usual.

46
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:28,010
No autographs till we finish with the press.

47
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,721
We're not.... Allow me to introduce myself.

48
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:34,600
Blue Raja, master of silverware,
forks a 'speciality,' at your service.

49
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,603
My colleague, the Shoveler.
- Big fan of your work.

50
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:41,357
Standing rather painfully aside
is our cohort, Mr. Furious.

51
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:44,262
How's it hanging?
- So you guys....

52
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
They're superheroes.

53
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,282
We fight crime. Call it what you will.
- Quite right.

54
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:53,017
That's great. Just, you know...

55
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,343
...keep up the good work.

56
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:58,271
you as well, sir. you as well.

57
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:04,046
Did you see? Did you....

58
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:06,799
Did you hear that?
'Keep up the good work.'

59
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,009
The good work.
- He's making fun of us.

60
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:11,720
No, Roy. He saluted us. That was real.

61
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,764
I thought he was sincere.
- What's up?

62
00:06:13,864 --> 00:06:15,864
Hello. Nice to see you.

63
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:19,186
I saw the action out there tonight.

64
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:23,281
What you guys need is
a little bit of firepower.

65
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,791
I'm a weapons designer.

66
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:30,865
I've got what you need.
- All right. We'll come back.

67
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:34,410
We'll visit all of you people later.
Thank you, sir.

68
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,165
I don't live here. I'm here for the ladies.

69
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,848
Here, take my card.

70
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:46,407
My name's Heller. Say it with me.

71
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,464
Heller.

72
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:50,056
All right. Thank you.

73
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:54,763
Why do you encourage those people?

74
00:06:54,863 --> 00:06:58,263
Those people look up to us.
- That's true.

75
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:03,564
you know the drill.
- Please sign my hat, Captain Amazing.

76
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:05,704
Herman, give me a flash.

77
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,027
How are you tonight?

78
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,988
Captain, how did you know
where to find the Red Eyes?

79
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:13,793
Becky, it's what I do.

80
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:18,537
Thanks to you, the city's almost crime free.
What do you do with your free time?

81
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,372
I wish I had some free time.

82
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:24,043
People are saying you're so 'amazing'
you'll put yourself out of a job.

83
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,922
Have any comments on that?
- That's one problem I look forward to.

84
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:32,357
And is it true that you lost
your Pepsi endorsement?

85
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,569
I hadn't heard that.

86
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,781
Thanks for your questions.

87
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:42,031
you have no comment
regarding your Pepsi situation?

88
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,946
Look who we got.

89
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:54,046
you again. Wanna-bes.

90
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,451
This city already has a superhero.

91
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:01,886
Perhaps you've heard of Captain Amazing.
- Thank you.

92
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:05,042
Do yourself a favor, McGuire.

93
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:07,607
Don't flip my switch tonight.

94
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:08,754
He's a big baby.

95
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:11,489
And what exactly would that do?

96
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,135
Don't turn around, Roy. Don't do it.

97
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:17,429
It's not worth it.
- Keep walking.

98
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,529
It's not worth it.

99
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:24,763
you know exactly what that would do...

100
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:28,121
...checkerhead.

101
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,584
What?

102
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:36,564
Don't mess with the volcano, my man.

103
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:41,672
'Cause I will go Pompeii on your butt.

104
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,513
My golly. Good grief.

105
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,732
you keep dreaming, Wanna-be.

106
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,925
Let's go.

107
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:56,677
Dream on, moron.

108
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:59,648
I will keep dreaming, my friend.

109
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:03,511
And when I wake up, you better hope...

110
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:06,228
...you better hope you're asleep.

111
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:09,231
Don't re-engage him. He's a silly--
- Sweet dreams.

112
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,331
He's immature.
- Lilac.

113
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,364
C.A., I'm doing my best.

114
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:19,674
your best? Quick question:

115
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,620
Is this your best?

116
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,873
I realize you're upset.
- Victor, I'm positioned.

117
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:30,294
Do you understand what that means,
on a very personal level here...

118
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:33,047
...to know the companies
that make these products...

119
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:35,508
...want me to be their spokesperson?

120
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,634
Their voice?

121
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:39,261
I think we should focus on the positive.

122
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,896
Tonight was good.
- yeah? you think so?

123
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:47,556
'Cause I was worried it was...pathetic.

124
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:51,565
'Amazing Triumphs At A Nursing Home.'
That's great copy, Vic.

125
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,651
I'm a publicist, not a magician.

126
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:56,153
you want big news?
you must have big fights.

127
00:09:56,253 --> 00:10:00,115
A superhero needs a supervillain.
Thanks to you, we've got none left.

128
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:03,382
Then get the Death Man.

129
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:05,204
Death Man is dead.

130
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,109
Father Doom.
- Life without parole.

131
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:11,168
Apocalypto's doing 50 years.
Armagezzmo's in exile.

132
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:13,754
Baron Von Chaos got the chair.
- Really?

133
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:18,759
Casanova is locked up in a nuthouse.
- Casanova Frankenstein.

134
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:21,303
Now, there was a supervillain.

135
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:23,403
you know, he just....

136
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:26,956
He's got those eyes, you know?

137
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:29,034
I can't do it, but....

138
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:31,272
That voice. Such pure evil.

139
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:34,024
The battles we used to have.
Extraordinary.

140
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:35,776
'Used to.'

141
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:39,106
That's the problem, Captain.'Used to.'

142
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:15,191
Let the records show...

143
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,371
...that this parole hearing
has officially begun.

144
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:39,624
We now commence the 17th parole hearing
of Casanova Frankenstein.

145
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,105
Dr. Leek, you may begin.

146
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:45,652
Thank you.

147
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:49,183
Gentlemen of the board,
the man who sits before you...

148
00:11:49,283 --> 00:11:53,618
...the once infamous evil genius,
is entirely cured.

149
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,357
What?
- I give you my word...

150
00:11:56,457 --> 00:12:00,877
...that he's of no more danger to the city
than I am.

151
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:03,752
This is outrageous.
- yes.

152
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,784
Mr. Casanova Frankenstein...

153
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:10,746
...do you have anything to say
on your own behalf?

154
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:14,595
Blessed disciples of Hippocrates...

155
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:20,514
...my heart is split in two.

156
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,775
It brims...

157
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,934
...with such sorrow
for my abominable crimes.

158
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,267
And yet...

159
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,492
...it swells with love...

160
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:35,702
...for you...

161
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,076
...for this sanctuary...

162
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,918
...this place of healing.

163
00:12:43,087 --> 00:12:46,742
Within my soul, I feel the choir singing...

164
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,736
...Beethoven's immortal Ode to Joy...

165
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:54,012
...where all men...

166
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:57,718
...become brothers.

167
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:03,154
Am I too late to cast my vote?

168
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:08,679
Not at all, Lance.
I was just about to remind the board...

169
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,766
...that Casanova once had our city
in a stranglehold of terror.

170
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:17,116
Parole is not an option for this man,
this monster.

171
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,149
We cannot risk the danger of releasing him.

172
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,904
I could not agree with you more.
- Excellent.

173
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:29,101
However, I did just have dinner
with an old friend recently.

174
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,745
Maybe you've heard of him?
Captain Amazing.

175
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:37,471
Captain Amazing?
- He asked if I would read this.

176
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,296
'Dear members of the board:

177
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:47,801
'We all know that society cannot exist
without absolute justice...

178
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:52,729
'...but society is also built
upon compassion.

179
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,477
'Let us set the tone
for the new millennium...

180
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:59,063
'...by making a historic gesture
of forgiveness.

181
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:01,816
'Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you...

182
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,534
'...let us grant Casanova Frankenstein...

183
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:09,004
'...a second chance.'

184
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:15,883
With Captain Amazing's recommendation
and protection...

185
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:19,821
...l suppose we could consider....

186
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:23,685
I pronounce you...

187
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:29,983
...cured.

188
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:36,818
Hello, Champion City.

189
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:42,955
Daddy is home.

190
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,125
Hi, everybody.

191
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:04,044
Tooth decay and gingivitis can be a crime.

192
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:06,755
That's why I use Mighty Whitey toothpaste.

193
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:10,255
Because I want my teeth to look amazing.

194
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:16,140
I'll bring this up again.
It's $150 apiece. We each chip in.

195
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,434
My cousin knows a guy
who knows a publicist.

196
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:22,480
What will we publicize?
The fact that we get our butts kicked a lot.

197
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,691
If you didn't smack me with a shovel
every time we went out...

198
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,610
...we'd have more wins to brag about.

199
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,488
I'm sorry. I just tend
to lose my concentration...

200
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:33,199
...when I've got a salad fork stuck
in my rear end.

201
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,910
I get it. your shovel in his face is my fault.

202
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,287
you threw a spoon at the guy, Jeff.

203
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:42,041
What was up with that?
- I thought it was a fork.

204
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,709
you're the master of cutlery.

205
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:47,046
you can't throw a knife
when someone's trying to kill me?

206
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,715
you can't use a rake?
- No, I'm the Shoveler.

207
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,551
I'm the Blue Raja. I'm not Stab Man.

208
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,429
I'm not Knifey Boy. I'm the Blue Raja.

209
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:57,264
That's another thing.
- What?

210
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:00,601
you could get a bit of blue
in the uniform somewhere.

211
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:04,781
you've got green.
There's a little flowery thing.

212
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:06,482
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

213
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:09,860
If we could stop being so literal
for just one moment.

214
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,987
Look what I'm doing. Look at that.

215
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,573
I'm putting $150 on the table.
Who's in with me?

216
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,075
I don't have $150.

217
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,161
If I did, I wouldn't have plundered
my mother's silverware.

218
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,538
It's a waste of money.

219
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:23,415
you know who doesn't think
it's a waste of money?

220
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,709
Little Mr. Captain Amazing.

221
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:28,546
If we had a billionaire benefactor
like Lance Hunt...

222
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:32,508
...we could spend $150.
- Lance Hunt is Captain Amazing.

223
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:34,933
Don't start that again.

224
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:39,807
Lance Hunt wears glasses.
Captain Amazing doesn't wear glasses.

225
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:41,976
He takes them off when he transforms.

226
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:46,751
That doesn't make any sense.
He wouldn't be able to see.

227
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:52,080
Thanks for waiting.
- Thanks for dropping by.

228
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:54,363
Do you know what you want?

229
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:58,742
Allow me to begin, my dear. The Blue Raja
is quite partial to the salad niçoise.

230
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:01,370
My dressing of choice is Rancho Light...

231
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,373
...and I'd appreciate it
if you'd hold the Baco-Bits.

232
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:08,252
Since it's your first night,
I suppose I'll 'fork-give' you...

233
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,391
...if you 'fork-get.'

234
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:12,631
Who's next?

235
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,509
Can I get a meatball sandwich
on white with mayo?

236
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,596
I'll have a steak, very rare.
That means pink, not bloody.

237
00:17:18,696 --> 00:17:20,181
And could I get some ice?

238
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:23,309
I had a little mishap defending justice
at the nursing home.

239
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,914
I thought I heard on TV that
that was Captain Amazing.

240
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:35,237
Let's all be good little automaton droids
and believe everything we hear on TV.

241
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:38,227
I'll just go place your order now.

242
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:43,579
A trifle strident with that crumpet,
weren't we, Furious?

243
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,484
I am a ticking time bomb of fury.

244
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,793
When we split the check three ways...

245
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:52,755
...the steak-eater picks the pocket
of the salad man.

246
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,674
Just give me the money, Jeff.
- yes, fine.

247
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:59,261
Every time we split it three ways.
- It's flipping robbery.

248
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,741
Well, you should order more.

249
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:06,992
Do you see what I see?

250
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:10,147
It's Tony C.

251
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:13,663
And Tony P, leader of the Disco Boys.

252
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:27,054
But why would he be back in town?

253
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,544
Maybe it's time to do a little following
to find out.

254
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,504
No, it's already 10:30.

255
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:35,673
I'll get killed by my wife as it is.

256
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:39,552
yes, and I've had quite enough excitement
for one night, thank you.

257
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:43,430
My mistake. I thought I was hanging out
with serious superheroes:

258
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,391
The Shoveler and the Blue Raja.

259
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,603
But, apparently,
I'm hanging out with Lazy Boy and....

260
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,480
Good night, Roy.
- yes, toodle-loo.

261
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,810
Hang on a second. Lazy Boy and the....

262
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:57,403
And the Recliner.

263
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,223
yeah, Lazy Boy and the Recliner.

264
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:03,086
Guys, are you coming?

265
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:09,771
Okay, fine. I guess tonight...

266
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,975
...the lone wolf...

267
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,094
...hunts alone.

268
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,281
Testicles rising.

269
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:30,373
Can't breathe. Can't breathe.

270
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:16,148
Butch needs his vest back.
He's got a game on Saturday.

271
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:21,362
Well, it's my vest too. I bought it for him.
The only thing I need--

272
00:20:21,462 --> 00:20:22,780
Okay.

273
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,282
How long you gonna do this, Eddie?

274
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:28,134
It's been 12 years.
- I know.

275
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:32,122
you got a family to look after, Eddie.

276
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:34,917
The kids are worried sick about you.

277
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:39,255
But still you go out, night after night,
running around the city. For what?

278
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:42,521
Lucille, God gave me a gift.

279
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:45,981
I shovel very well.

280
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,112
Baby.

281
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,309
you shovel better
than any man I've ever known.

282
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:55,354
But that does not make you a superhero.

283
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,454
All l--
- Oh, no.

284
00:20:58,374 --> 00:21:00,374
you're a good husband.

285
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:02,376
And a good father.

286
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:06,124
But that's all. Nothing more.

287
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:12,427
you're right.

288
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:15,721
I believe in you, Daddy.

289
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:19,537
Roland, do not encourage your father.

290
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:27,887
Well, if it isn't our old friends,
the Red Eyes.

291
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:33,342
Good evening. We weren't expecting
to see you again so spoon....

292
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,911
Red Eyes, Red Eyes. What a treat.

293
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:43,074
We weren't expecting
to see you again so spoon.

294
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:45,779
Jeffrey.

295
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,825
Mom, how many times have I asked you
not to barge in here?

296
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,965
What's burning?
- Incense.

297
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,914
I can't even count
how many rules you're breaking.

298
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,167
One: Always knock.
Two: Don't sniff around outside my door.

299
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,252
Three: Do not interrogate me.

300
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,352
Jeffrey.
- What?

301
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:04,813
Are you into marijuana?

302
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:06,967
you're cheesing me off so bad.

303
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,928
Just, please.... Good night.

304
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,430
I'm sorry. Jeffrey, please....

305
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,530
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

306
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,036
She's just so--

307
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,892
All right, let's see what's shaking...

308
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:59,697
...at the Chez Casa Casanova.

309
00:23:50,546 --> 00:23:52,788
The old disco room.

310
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:00,843
Just as I left it.

311
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:06,629
you've been locked up for 20 years.
A lot of things have changed since then.

312
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:12,764
It must have been hard for you,
the way times and styles have changed...

313
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,930
...to hear the people saying
that disco is dead.

314
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,233
Disco is not dead. Disco is life.

315
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:22,978
yes, Tony, that is the passion I remember.

316
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:30,827
Stick with me, Tony,
and you will dance again...

317
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:34,379
...when I rule this town.

318
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:42,352
Have you met my psychiatrist?

319
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:47,461
Come out, come out wherever you....

320
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:49,561
There we go.

321
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,674
We got a little terrace party.

322
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:55,636
I want you to spread the word
to all of my gangs.

323
00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:59,139
Tell them that Casanova Frankenstein
is back...

324
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:02,476
...and that Casanova
is planning something...

325
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:04,786
...a little bit different.

326
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:07,829
Kaboom.

327
00:25:15,923 --> 00:25:17,923
Mama pajama.

328
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:23,581
What kind of crazy man blows up
a crazy house?

329
00:25:23,681 --> 00:25:26,959
And now, if you will excuse me,
I am expecting a visit...

330
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,269
...from a very old friend.

331
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:44,752
Look what we got.
A little booty call from Captain Amazing.

332
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,649
This is a fine, elegant Harvey Wallbanger.

333
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,530
Even when it's sucked by a scum like you?

334
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,435
Captain Amazing. What a surprise.

335
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,234
Really? I'm not so sure about that.

336
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,791
your first night of freedom,
and you blow up the asylum.

337
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:10,878
Interesting choice.
I knew you couldn't change.

338
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:13,130
I knew you'd know that.
- I know that.

339
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,217
And I knew you'd know I'd know you knew.

340
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:20,822
But I didn't.
I only knew that you'd know that I knew.

341
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,697
Did you know that?

342
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:26,936
Of course.

343
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:30,521
Please, won't you join me?
- With pleasure.

344
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:32,149
Quick thought.

345
00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:35,027
Would you mind removing
the submicronic laser...

346
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:38,030
...in the ring on the index finger
of your left hand?

347
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,198
Of course.

348
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,368
If it wouldn't be too much trouble,
go ahead and disengage...

349
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:46,288
...the psychotropic bacterium
dart launchers in your slippers.

350
00:26:46,388 --> 00:26:47,748
Done.

351
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:52,795
The cold fusion ultrasonic neuro-stunner
in your drink stirrer. Turn it off.

352
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:56,550
We know each other so well,
don't we, Lance?

353
00:26:56,607 --> 00:27:00,942
We've always been each other's
greatest 'nemesises.'

354
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,847
Nemesis....

355
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:05,157
What's the plural on that?

356
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,950
Nemeses.

357
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:09,311
Whatever.

358
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:12,022
you're going to prison
for life this time, Casanova.

359
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:13,691
Here in Champion City...

360
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:17,021
...we still do a fairly brisk trade...

361
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:18,737
...in justice.

362
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:22,867
I thought it was all about the publicity
and keeping your sponsors happy.

363
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,369
It's that kind of cynicism that I truly feel...

364
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:28,274
...is starting to poison society.

365
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,541
Looky here.

366
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:33,294
A multi-frequency radio detonator.

367
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:36,505
you should be careful
when discarding incriminating evidence.

368
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:39,884
Oh, no. This is an amusing little gizmo.

369
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:41,984
It's really quite cool.

370
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,820
yeah? What is it?

371
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:54,290
It's a chloroform-deploying
portable enticement snare.

372
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:00,335
Dang.

373
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:05,257
Lancie...

374
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,356
...you really are so predictable.

375
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:23,969
'Morning, Sally.
- you're late.

376
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:28,057
yes, I know. I was up all night,
defending the city from evil...

377
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:29,975
...but you don't care about that.

378
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,361
Work starts at 9:00. It's 9:25.

379
00:28:33,454 --> 00:28:35,981
I guess all the junk's
probably ruined by now.

380
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,527
When are you gonna tear down
that jeep like I told you to?

381
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:44,490
We went through this yesterday.
That jeep is an armored car of some type.

382
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,618
It can withstand bombs.
I can't rip it apart with a crowbar.

383
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:49,495
Just junk it.

384
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:53,930
If you gave me the proper tools, I could--
- Junk it.

385
00:28:54,224 --> 00:28:56,877
I'm willing to have this discussion
with you...

386
00:28:56,977 --> 00:29:02,216
...but I think we should deal with it
like two people who respect--

387
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:04,093
I want it junked.

388
00:29:04,193 --> 00:29:05,845
Okay.

389
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,472
Right now, I'm kind of like a powder keg...

390
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,612
...and you're the match.

391
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,310
If you tell me to junk it one more time--

392
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,410
Junk it now.

393
00:29:15,996 --> 00:29:17,996
you got that?

394
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:36,455
That little sucker just saved your life.

395
00:29:37,101 --> 00:29:39,906
Just junk it, you miserable cuss.

396
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,403
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

397
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:08,491
Champion City's best-known billionaire,
Lance Hunt, has disappeared.

398
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:11,702
Police hope Captain Amazing
will help in the search for Hunt...

399
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:17,497
...but have, so far, failed to contact
the city's beloved superhero.

400
00:30:18,892 --> 00:30:22,632
He makes a wonderful trophy,
don't you think?

401
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:26,967
I think we need to talk
about your plans here.

402
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,277
you know my plans, Lancie.

403
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:31,722
Tomorrow night...

404
00:30:31,822 --> 00:30:33,682
...l'm going to kill you.

405
00:30:33,782 --> 00:30:36,435
That's the part
that really doesn't work for me.

406
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:39,170
When the clock strikes 12:00...

407
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:41,411
...cuckoo, cuckoo...

408
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,108
...you will be dead...

409
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,654
...and my city will be given
a new state of mind.

410
00:30:46,754 --> 00:30:49,156
you must go with
what you're comfortable with...

411
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:52,034
...but, I just keep coming back to this place.

412
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:55,538
I'm spitballing here,
but maybe we release...

413
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:58,290
...the Captain to the authorities.

414
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,087
I say you're completely reformed. Wink.
There's rejoicing in the streets.

415
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:07,758
Then, at that point, you do
the whole destruction-of-the-city thing.

416
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:10,323
I mean, is it a perfect plan?

417
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:12,054
No.

418
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:15,554
And I think that's what I like about it.

419
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:20,855
Okay, that's great. Turn off the lights now.

420
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:24,108
It was just an idea.
Wait, I got a better one.

421
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:27,624
you let me live, I am your sidekick.

422
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,048
I'm like Amazing Boy or....

423
00:31:30,214 --> 00:31:32,214
Casanova?

424
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:38,620
Are you sure Captain Amazing is in there?
- yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

425
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:16,508
Wait. Hear that?

426
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:19,121
We must have hit a trip wire.

427
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:21,749
It could be a photon eviscerator heating up.

428
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:25,211
It could be a cybernetic atom scrambler.
They target moving objects.

429
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:28,088
Sounds more like a heat-seeking
anthrax projection gun.

430
00:32:28,188 --> 00:32:30,132
Quickly, cover your mouth.
- Let's bolt.

431
00:32:30,232 --> 00:32:31,342
Don't move.
- Don't breathe.

432
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:32,760
Let's bolt.
- Don't move.

433
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,070
Don't breathe.
- Let's bolt.

434
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:38,614
It's the sprinkler.

435
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:45,609
Isn't that just fabu? I'm positively soaked.

436
00:32:50,711 --> 00:32:52,404
What do we got here?

437
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:55,616
I think they're supposed
to be jive superheroes.

438
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:59,966
They made a big mistake coming
to Casanova's place.

439
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:07,837
What's so funny?
- That's your power? you have guns?

440
00:33:07,937 --> 00:33:10,381
Couldn't you be a little more creative
than that?

441
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:12,508
Do forgive the impertinence...

442
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:15,302
...but what does a pistol
have to do with disco?

443
00:33:15,402 --> 00:33:17,402
Weak.
- At best.

444
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:22,768
Check out the guy with the pipe.
Are you the disco plumber?

445
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,728
There's no theme at all here, mates.

446
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:27,982
If you're gonna carry a chain,
make it a gold chain.

447
00:33:28,082 --> 00:33:30,943
See what I'm saying?
That's just off the top of my head.

448
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:32,611
What's up, Tiger Lily?

449
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,751
The top of your head?

450
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,456
We'll never get in there.
There are too many Disco Boys.

451
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,376
Amazing's in there. I saw him go in.

452
00:33:47,476 --> 00:33:49,545
There's never any evil trios, are there?

453
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:54,175
No, they've all got to travel in gangs
like little babies.

454
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:58,355
Maybe it's time to level the playing field.
- How?

455
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:01,390
I'm talking about recruiting.

456
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:04,185
There are many guys who'd kill
to get in on our action.

457
00:34:04,285 --> 00:34:07,688
Plenty of poseurs, you mean.
- yeah, maybe a few.

458
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:12,485
But there's got to be a couple of guys
out there, like Human Torch, before he hit.

459
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:16,697
Or like a guy who can shoot
stinging foam into your eyes.

460
00:34:16,797 --> 00:34:18,797
Or something like that.

461
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:23,245
Well, there's the Sphinx, of course.
- The what?

462
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:25,725
The Sphinx.
- I know this guy.

463
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:29,126
Big crimefighter from down south.
Big-league hitter down there.

464
00:34:29,226 --> 00:34:32,588
What's his power?
- He's terribly mysterious.

465
00:34:32,688 --> 00:34:36,175
That's it? That's his power?
He's mysterious?

466
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,845
Terribly mysterious.
- Plus, he can, like...

467
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:43,098
...cut guns in half with his mind.

468
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:45,950
Really? I hadn't heard that.

469
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:48,020
We'll track this Sphinx down.

470
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,625
Meantime, I have an idea
where we can get another guy.

471
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,694
I'm free for lunch tomorrow.
How about you?

472
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:58,429
Nothing I couldn't move around.

473
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:14,463
Listen, why don't you guys go on ahead?
I got to take care of something.

474
00:35:14,563 --> 00:35:16,563
Oh, I see.

475
00:35:26,784 --> 00:35:30,269
Good cause there,
saving homeless animals.

476
00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:34,623
Hog queen?

477
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,884
What?
- you're into motorcycles.

478
00:35:38,545 --> 00:35:40,545
Not really.

479
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:44,134
'Cause I got a motorcycle.

480
00:35:44,802 --> 00:35:46,453
yeah, what kind?

481
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:48,593
It's a Harley.
- A Harley?

482
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:55,463
Compatible. It's a Harley compatible.
Basically, the same engineering.

483
00:35:56,814 --> 00:35:59,789
I hope we're cool about last night.

484
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:01,302
Last night?

485
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:05,737
Like I said, I was kind of
in scary mode back there.

486
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:09,560
Sometimes that comes off
as a little threatening or whatever.

487
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,562
I don't find you threatening...

488
00:36:11,662 --> 00:36:14,414
...you're very kind.

489
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:16,623
...at all.

490
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:23,073
I still feel like I should make it up
to you somehow, just in some way.

491
00:36:23,173 --> 00:36:27,411
I should take you out to dinner or
something to make up for being so scary....

492
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:29,511
I'm really busy.

493
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:36,101
Right.

494
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:39,115
Our little chess game continues.

495
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:42,593
yeah?

496
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:47,028
We're looking for the one
they call 'Invisible Boy.'

497
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:52,019
All my life, I've been ignored by people.
Finally, after years of being overlooked...

498
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,604
...l found I have the power to disappear.

499
00:36:55,998 --> 00:37:00,152
It's real ironic how it happened 'cause--
- Can we come in?

500
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:02,488
yeah, sure. Come on.
- Thank you.

501
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:06,668
Dad, I'm going to my room
with three strange men.

502
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:12,289
And that's pretty much it.
- So, let me get this straight.

503
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:16,044
you are capable of becoming invisible?
- yes.

504
00:37:16,644 --> 00:37:19,922
But you can't give us a demonstration?
- No.

505
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:23,592
I can only become invisible
when no one's watching.

506
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:26,554
So, you're only invisible to yourself?

507
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:30,649
No. If I look at myself,
I become visible again.

508
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:38,738
So, you can only become invisible
when absolutely nobody is watching you?

509
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,542
yes.
- Do forgive our incredulity...

510
00:37:42,878 --> 00:37:48,573
...but I wonder how you can be certain
you've achieved transparency?

511
00:37:49,426 --> 00:37:51,466
When you go invisible...

512
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,680
...you can feel it.

513
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:58,586
I'm leaving.
- Thanks. It was nice to have met you.

514
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:01,714
Wait, guys. Don't go.
Where are you guys going?

515
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:03,814
Can I come?

516
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:06,760
Look, no offense, kid, but...

517
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,682
...we're going up against a really powerful
supervillain, Casanova Frankenstein.

518
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:14,476
That means we got to find a lot
of superheroes quickly.

519
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:17,021
We have no idea where to even start--

520
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:19,416
I know tons of superheroes.

521
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,775
I'm sure you know a lot--
- No, seriously.

522
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,362
I'm always at costume shops,
martial-arts stores...

523
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:27,615
...talking to guys, making connections.

524
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:30,576
If you want to break in,
you got to network...

525
00:38:30,676 --> 00:38:33,141
...and I know how to network.

526
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:35,669
Sorry, kid.
- Come on.

527
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:39,362
Haven't you guys ever been a kid?

528
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:42,366
Haven't you guys ever had a dream?

529
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:54,016
Let me see, who else have I met?
There's the Pincher.

530
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:55,768
The Pickler.

531
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:56,977
Princess Headbutt.

532
00:38:57,077 --> 00:38:59,772
White Flight and the Black Menace.
They work together.

533
00:38:59,872 --> 00:39:01,398
Slow down, slow down.

534
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:03,901
Then there's Professor Pink Belly...

535
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:06,612
...and Lucky Pierre and The French Tickler.

536
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,712
'French Tickler.'

537
00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:12,117
you've got all their telephone numbers?
- yeah, most of them.

538
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:16,038
We've got to figure out a way
to get them all in one place.

539
00:39:16,138 --> 00:39:19,283
Some kind of a tryout.
- yes, a tryout.

540
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:22,503
Throw in a barbecue and a few kegs,
they'll all show up.

541
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:24,713
The mooch factor is high with this crowd.

542
00:39:24,813 --> 00:39:27,448
A barbecue. That's a good idea.

543
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:31,095
What? Bugger all, it's the Spleen.
Play dead.

544
00:39:31,195 --> 00:39:35,190
Who's that?
- Turn your head. Don't say anything.

545
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:50,239
Hi, fellas.

546
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:53,742
Word on the street is
you're looking for superheroes.

547
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:56,078
Not really.
- Actually, we're just leaving.

548
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:58,178
Rotten luck.

549
00:39:59,306 --> 00:40:00,332
Here we go.

550
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:03,067
Perfect timing.
- That's for you.

551
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:06,297
Hamburger, right?
- yes, thank you.

552
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:08,397
Enjoy.

553
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:11,468
Why are you guys always dissing me?
It hurts my feelings.

554
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:14,013
I'm a superhero, too. I have powers.

555
00:40:14,113 --> 00:40:16,152
Really? Like what?

556
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:18,017
So glad you asked.

557
00:40:18,117 --> 00:40:19,643
Oh, no.
- Excuse me.

558
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:21,743
Excuse me.

559
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:27,943
It all started
when I was just 13 years of age.

560
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:29,987
One day, while walking with friends...

561
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:32,892
...l accidentally cut the cheese.

562
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:35,201
In my adolescent awkwardness...

563
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:38,913
...l blamed it on an old gypsy woman
who happened to be passing by.

564
00:40:39,013 --> 00:40:41,013
Big mistake.

565
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,502
The gypsy woman placed a curse
upon my head.

566
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:46,420
Because I'd smelt it...

567
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,063
...she decreed I would forevermore
be he who dealt it.

568
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:53,886
Let me illustrate.
- No, you don't have to.

569
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:56,281
It's not necessary, really.

570
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,740
Let's see.

571
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:02,075
Distance:

572
00:41:02,328 --> 00:41:04,328
Seven meters.

573
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:06,455
Air speed: normal.

574
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:09,594
Compensate for air conditioning.

575
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:13,468
Pull my fingers.
- Don't do it.

576
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:15,589
Oh, dear God.

577
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:18,796
S. B. D.

578
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:29,394
Silent, but deadly.

579
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:31,924
That's good shooting.
- That was amazing.

580
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:35,169
It's disgusting. Don't encourage him.

581
00:41:35,736 --> 00:41:39,136
you guys are recruiting for superheroes.

582
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,600
Where are the tryouts?

583
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,780
We don't know yet.
Once we do, we'll contact you.

584
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:51,527
Bet we'd get a big turnout if we did it
somewhere with a swimming pool.

585
00:41:51,627 --> 00:41:53,627
Oh, no.

586
00:41:54,129 --> 00:41:56,129
Absolutely not. Nope.

587
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:05,249
I don't deserve this.

588
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:07,349
I know.

589
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:11,672
A lot of other men I could have married.
- I understand.

590
00:42:11,772 --> 00:42:15,937
If one person vomits in my pool,
I'll divorce you.

591
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:18,137
That's fair.

592
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:20,237
Come on, kids.

593
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,898
State your name and power.

594
00:42:28,998 --> 00:42:30,691
I am the Waffler.

595
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:33,777
With my griddle of justice,
I bash the enemy in the head...

596
00:42:33,877 --> 00:42:36,087
...or I burn them like so.

597
00:42:36,797 --> 00:42:38,797
Don't do that.

598
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:42,756
I also have my truth syrup,
which is low fat.

599
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:45,206
And I'm working on a theme song.

600
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:48,026
'Waffle Man, I am the Waffler...

601
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,330
'Golden, crispy, bad guys are history'

602
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:55,216
And I'm running. Just think about it.

603
00:42:55,316 --> 00:42:57,676
Do you have a health plan?
Maybe dental? Eye?

604
00:42:57,776 --> 00:43:01,276
Next.
- Hi. I am Pencilhead.

605
00:43:02,448 --> 00:43:04,743
And I am Son of Pencilhead.

606
00:43:05,075 --> 00:43:07,645
We erase crime.
- Two generations of....

607
00:43:07,745 --> 00:43:09,021
...yes, thank you.

608
00:43:09,121 --> 00:43:13,116
Did I do all right?
- yes, I think they liked us.

609
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:16,707
I'm the Ballerina Man.

610
00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:21,214
I don't need to see that.

611
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,086
Thanks.

612
00:43:32,186 --> 00:43:34,046
I am--
- Hey.

613
00:43:34,146 --> 00:43:36,006
you copied me.
- you copied me.

614
00:43:36,106 --> 00:43:37,424
Did not.
- Liar.

615
00:43:37,524 --> 00:43:40,074
Ladies, now let's play nicely.

616
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:53,886
I'd say there's potential...there.

617
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:57,700
I be the Bullfighter. I fight the bull.

618
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:02,241
Greetings, fellow crime fighters.
I am Radio Man.

619
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:03,450
I am Squeegeeman.

620
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,786
Do you sense its power?
- yes.

621
00:44:05,886 --> 00:44:10,499
P.M.S. Avenger. I work four days a month.
Is there a problem with that?

622
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:11,792
No.

623
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:14,003
Whatever you say.
- We'll get back to you.

624
00:44:14,103 --> 00:44:16,313
Quite all right.
- Whatever.

625
00:44:16,522 --> 00:44:18,522
Okay, that's it.

626
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:31,562
That was a complete waste of time.

627
00:44:31,662 --> 00:44:33,872
Like so many things we do.

628
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:39,326
Hi. Am I too late to try out?

629
00:44:39,837 --> 00:44:42,198
What time is it?
- I don't have a watch on.

630
00:44:42,298 --> 00:44:45,618
Sorry. you'll have to pretend
to be a superhero somewhere else.

631
00:44:45,718 --> 00:44:47,718
Really? I see.

632
00:44:48,804 --> 00:44:50,804
That's fine.

633
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,160
Look out.

634
00:45:26,884 --> 00:45:30,037
I guess I'll just have
to take my ball and go home.

635
00:45:30,137 --> 00:45:32,426
you can't go.
- Please.

636
00:45:32,514 --> 00:45:34,583
Where you going?
- That was cool.

637
00:45:34,683 --> 00:45:35,960
One second.
- Stop her.

638
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,253
Hold on.
- Stop her.

639
00:45:37,353 --> 00:45:38,379
Settle down.

640
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:39,713
That was great.

641
00:45:39,813 --> 00:45:42,132
We could squeeze in one more interview.

642
00:45:42,232 --> 00:45:44,844
yes, seeing how you schlepped
your ball all this way.

643
00:45:44,944 --> 00:45:47,680
Appreciate that. Thanks.
- you're really good.

644
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,990
What's up? I'm the Spleen.

645
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:52,768
I'm the Bowler. How're you doing?

646
00:45:52,868 --> 00:45:54,868
you're very attractive.

647
00:45:56,413 --> 00:45:58,413
Why don't you...

648
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,776
...tell us about yourself.

649
00:46:00,876 --> 00:46:02,987
Help us understand why
we should choose you...

650
00:46:03,087 --> 00:46:05,197
...over all the other qualified applicants.

651
00:46:05,297 --> 00:46:09,034
What other qualified applicants?
- Eddie, please.

652
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:13,129
Start at the top.
Where did you get your powers?

653
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:15,749
I got my powers from my father.

654
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:16,792
Who's he?

655
00:46:16,892 --> 00:46:19,128
Have you ever heard of
Carmine the Bowler?

656
00:46:19,228 --> 00:46:21,228
Have we ever heard....

657
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:24,425
Blimey, don't tell us
you're the Bowler's daughter.

658
00:46:24,525 --> 00:46:27,720
I remember there being a little controversy
around his death.

659
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,597
The police said it was an accident.

660
00:46:29,697 --> 00:46:32,808
He came home late one night
and fell down an elevator shaft...

661
00:46:32,908 --> 00:46:34,768
...onto some bullets.

662
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:37,605
I've always suspected a bit of foul play.

663
00:46:37,705 --> 00:46:39,440
As have l.

664
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,484
Daddy's little girl is all grown up...

665
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:43,903
...looking for a little revenge?

666
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:46,989
yeah, that is it.
Is there a problem with that?

667
00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:49,033
Why don't you tell me?
- you tell me.

668
00:46:49,133 --> 00:46:52,369
Why don't you tell me?
- Why don't you tell me?

669
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:56,294
Why don't you tell me?
- Why don't you tell me?

670
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:01,337
All right, you've seen what I can do.

671
00:47:01,437 --> 00:47:03,380
you want to use my talents or not?

672
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,133
If you don't, I seek another cabal.

673
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:09,104
We definitely need you.
- Indeed.

674
00:47:09,653 --> 00:47:11,388
Bowler. Evelyn.

675
00:47:11,488 --> 00:47:13,488
Carol.
- Carol.

676
00:47:13,574 --> 00:47:16,719
Will you join our little ragtag trio?

677
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:18,395
I think you mean quartet--

678
00:47:18,495 --> 00:47:22,149
What are you talking about?
There's five of us.

679
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:27,094
Nobody's green lit any new memberships,
so just chill out.

680
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:29,490
you've got a good arm. I'll give you that.

681
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,480
But we are the lead cadre--
- Cadre.

682
00:47:32,718 --> 00:47:34,286
you're in.
- Welcome aboard.

683
00:47:34,386 --> 00:47:37,956
Guys, what are--
- What? What's the problem?

684
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:40,292
Welcome.

685
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:43,962
What?
- Nothing. No problem. Welcome aboard.

686
00:47:53,113 --> 00:47:55,140
Are Spleen and I on the team or not?

687
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,726
In my opinion,
which used to matter around here...

688
00:47:57,826 --> 00:47:59,895
...we shouldn't be flinging memberships...

689
00:47:59,995 --> 00:48:02,857
...at every guy who puts together
matching gloves and boots.

690
00:48:02,957 --> 00:48:05,526
Just be sure to jump in
when the action starts.

691
00:48:05,626 --> 00:48:08,654
you do your share, we'll keep you around.
- Maybe.

692
00:48:08,754 --> 00:48:11,657
you're a British man
who converted to lslam?

693
00:48:11,757 --> 00:48:17,288
No. Until the early part of this century,
lndia was part of the British Empire...

694
00:48:17,388 --> 00:48:20,166
...whose government there was called
the British Raj...

695
00:48:20,266 --> 00:48:22,626
...after the Hindi word for 'sovereignty.'

696
00:48:22,726 --> 00:48:25,786
Furthermore--
- Wait. I'm sorry. What?

697
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:27,214
Dad....

698
00:48:27,314 --> 00:48:30,204
No, he's not a commie nor a fruit.

699
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:32,401
Sorry.

700
00:48:33,487 --> 00:48:35,952
His ignorance embarrasses me.

701
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,310
Am I to understand you've inserted
your father's skull...

702
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:41,479
...inside of that ball for bowling?

703
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:44,554
No. The guy at the pro shop did it.

704
00:48:47,376 --> 00:48:48,777
That was Casanova's limo.

705
00:48:48,877 --> 00:48:52,239
you bet your sweet bippy it was.
Let's turn this sucker around.

706
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:55,314
He's probably got Amazing in there.

707
00:48:59,096 --> 00:49:01,587
Here we go.
- I feel car sick.

708
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:04,474
Great.

709
00:49:04,602 --> 00:49:08,214
So tell me, who can we count on seeing
at my banquet tomorrow?

710
00:49:08,314 --> 00:49:10,674
All the top gangs will be there, Cas.

711
00:49:10,774 --> 00:49:14,599
They want to know
what you got up your sleeve.

712
00:49:15,988 --> 00:49:17,988
Mr. Casanova...

713
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:21,836
...l think we're being followed.

714
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:38,884
Let us say hello.

715
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:50,690
What's he doing?
- He's either very smart or very dumb.

716
00:50:06,163 --> 00:50:07,606
Hello.

717
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:10,651
I would like a double burger with large fries.

718
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:13,811
Do you boys want something to drink?

719
00:50:14,922 --> 00:50:17,825
We think you did something bad
to Captain Amazing.

720
00:50:17,925 --> 00:50:19,827
We'd like you to tell us where he is.

721
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:23,414
Captain who?
This name does not ring any bells with me.

722
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:26,333
I don't like your tone, Frankenpuss.

723
00:50:26,433 --> 00:50:28,669
Do yourself a favor
and don't punch my clock.

724
00:50:28,769 --> 00:50:31,130
I'm a Pantera's box
you do not want to open.

725
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,230
It is Pandora.

726
00:50:34,149 --> 00:50:36,468
Please don't correct me. It sickens me.

727
00:50:36,568 --> 00:50:39,033
you guys never learn, do you?

728
00:50:39,238 --> 00:50:41,363
Apparently we don't, ass.

729
00:50:42,908 --> 00:50:45,458
I know you.
- you don't know me.

730
00:50:45,786 --> 00:50:47,396
you knew my father.
- Sal.

731
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:49,023
Carmine.

732
00:50:49,123 --> 00:50:51,874
Carmine? The Bowler?

733
00:50:52,293 --> 00:50:54,333
yep.
- you're Baby Bowler?

734
00:50:54,628 --> 00:50:56,753
Is that a problem?
- Hello.

735
00:50:57,756 --> 00:51:01,118
I'm the guy that gave your daddy the shaft.

736
00:51:01,218 --> 00:51:05,915
This is the last time I'm going to ask you:
Where is Captain Amazing?

737
00:51:06,015 --> 00:51:09,585
And a Diet Pepsi with a little bit of ice.

738
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:16,356
Hey, Shov.

739
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,990
Boys, let's go.

740
00:51:26,911 --> 00:51:28,911
Fork yourself.

741
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:35,834
Pull.

742
00:51:53,729 --> 00:51:58,342
Come on, Roy, let's get out of here.
- Come on, Furious. Let's go.

743
00:51:58,442 --> 00:52:04,056
People who live in glass houses, shouldn't,
because this is what happens.

744
00:52:04,156 --> 00:52:08,491
Come on. That's enough.
Come on. Get out of the way.

745
00:52:09,536 --> 00:52:11,522
'The roof is on fire. The roof.

746
00:52:11,622 --> 00:52:14,257
'The roof. The roof is on fire.

747
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:16,792
'We don't need no water.'

748
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,630
Here comes Daddy.

749
00:52:34,812 --> 00:52:36,812
Go, go.

750
00:52:55,708 --> 00:53:00,279
I would like to make a toast
to our first straight-out victory.

751
00:53:00,379 --> 00:53:04,450
The relationship you have with your
mother affects every dynamic in your life.

752
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,440
It's true, quite true.
- What? What?

753
00:53:07,595 --> 00:53:11,457
yes, I know a father's role is vital
in a child's life as well.

754
00:53:11,557 --> 00:53:13,459
No, I'm not disrespecting you.

755
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:17,922
you have to allow me
to have conversations in a bar...

756
00:53:18,022 --> 00:53:19,882
...and talk to my new friends.

757
00:53:19,982 --> 00:53:22,107
Anyway, I'm an adult now.

758
00:53:23,152 --> 00:53:24,887
Do you want to go back in the bag?

759
00:53:24,987 --> 00:53:28,307
Is that how we're gonna do it now?
you make the rules.

760
00:53:28,407 --> 00:53:30,407
If you don't zip it....

761
00:53:36,457 --> 00:53:40,820
I was going to say that parents
can be quite problematic.

762
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Tell me about it.

763
00:53:46,842 --> 00:53:50,837
There's not enough beer in the world.
I'm sorry.

764
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:53,213
'I'm sorry.'

765
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:55,334
you've got to live in truth.

766
00:53:55,434 --> 00:53:57,434
The woman's a tiger.

767
00:54:03,776 --> 00:54:05,636
Barkeep, another round...

768
00:54:05,736 --> 00:54:08,881
...for my sweet team of superfriends.

769
00:54:09,907 --> 00:54:13,222
Barkeep, another round for the super...

770
00:54:14,036 --> 00:54:16,036
...super-bellies.

771
00:54:17,248 --> 00:54:19,233
That's what's so cool about this team.

772
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:23,445
Everyone has their own powers
for all these different situations.

773
00:54:23,545 --> 00:54:25,545
Pull my finger.

774
00:54:31,387 --> 00:54:33,628
What?
- I was just thinking.

775
00:54:34,723 --> 00:54:38,888
I was wondering when
we might see your superpower.

776
00:54:40,562 --> 00:54:43,197
It'll happen, kid. Don't worry.

777
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:48,868
I say, 'sabotage.'
- 'Sabotage'?

778
00:54:49,071 --> 00:54:51,015
The Shoveler is hammered.

779
00:54:51,115 --> 00:54:53,240
The Shoveler is hammered.

780
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:03,360
What's the name of this team?

781
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,945
How about the Super Squad?

782
00:55:05,045 --> 00:55:08,574
How about the Six Dead Guys
in Their Stupid Costumes?

783
00:55:08,674 --> 00:55:11,619
No. The Magnificent Dead Guys.
How about that?

784
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:13,954
What about the Legendary Super Freaks?

785
00:55:14,054 --> 00:55:17,369
Way too positive. They totaled our car.

786
00:55:26,442 --> 00:55:28,442
Ready?
- Ready.

787
00:55:30,696 --> 00:55:32,696
Aim.
- Aim.

788
00:55:34,116 --> 00:55:36,116
I love you.

789
00:55:36,327 --> 00:55:38,327
Fire.

790
00:55:45,294 --> 00:55:49,615
Six Very Nearly Dead Guys
Who Had A Temporary Reprieve.

791
00:55:49,715 --> 00:55:52,660
That's it. That's your name.
- Six Jive Turkeys.

792
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,132
Dig, man?
- yeah. Dig, man.

793
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:59,218
That's your name.
Kill you later, Superlosers.

794
00:56:04,647 --> 00:56:07,766
Criminy. you're the Sphinx.

795
00:56:08,275 --> 00:56:10,275
And you are fools.

796
00:56:10,694 --> 00:56:12,388
Tonight...

797
00:56:12,488 --> 00:56:14,488
...you proved...

798
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:16,949
...your inexperience.

799
00:56:17,326 --> 00:56:20,726
The wise man knows that he is weakest...

800
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,052
...when he thinks himself strong.

801
00:56:25,501 --> 00:56:27,501
Mysterious.

802
00:56:27,503 --> 00:56:29,113
Terribly mysterious.

803
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:31,253
Casanova Frankenstein...

804
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,367
...is no ordinary villain.

805
00:56:33,467 --> 00:56:35,327
To fight him...

806
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:38,572
...you must have extraordinary skill.

807
00:56:38,847 --> 00:56:41,792
Thank you for that little piece
of information.

808
00:56:41,892 --> 00:56:44,545
I wouldn't have thought--
- Excuse me.

809
00:56:44,645 --> 00:56:47,006
Do you have any manners?
- I don't know. Do l?

810
00:56:47,106 --> 00:56:48,674
I don't know. Do you?
- Do l?

811
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:51,468
Why don't you tell me?
- Why don't you tell me?

812
00:56:51,568 --> 00:56:53,345
I don't know.
- Do I mind what?

813
00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:55,445
Silence.

814
00:56:56,031 --> 00:56:57,808
We'll have to separate you two.

815
00:56:57,908 --> 00:57:00,811
Is that what you want?
you want to be separated?

816
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:02,911
He started it.

817
00:57:03,497 --> 00:57:06,948
you must be like the wolf pack...

818
00:57:08,419 --> 00:57:10,707
...not like the six-pack.

819
00:57:11,088 --> 00:57:12,823
Teamwork. yes.

820
00:57:12,923 --> 00:57:16,578
you are not ready
to face so great an enemy.

821
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:21,832
Not until you have vanquished
the enemy within yourselves.

822
00:57:21,932 --> 00:57:23,375
yes.

823
00:57:23,475 --> 00:57:25,002
It's cool, isn't it?

824
00:57:25,102 --> 00:57:29,862
It goes right up to the point of being,
like...confusing.

825
00:57:29,982 --> 00:57:33,807
It's leadership.
It's what we've been missing.

826
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:36,069
yes, I quite agree.

827
00:57:36,655 --> 00:57:41,644
Sphinx, will you guide
our motley little gang of men-at-arms?

828
00:57:41,744 --> 00:57:42,895
Wait a minute.

829
00:57:42,995 --> 00:57:45,120
Are you serious? Come on.

830
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:47,233
Will you shape us, mold us?

831
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:50,223
Please unify us and make us whole.

832
00:57:50,336 --> 00:57:52,376
To learn my teachings...

833
00:57:52,796 --> 00:57:55,204
...l must first teach you...

834
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:58,175
...how to learn.

835
00:58:08,812 --> 00:58:11,674
Learn to hide your strikes
from your opponent...

836
00:58:11,774 --> 00:58:15,344
...and you'll more easily strike his hide.

837
00:58:24,036 --> 00:58:27,356
How many weapons do you wield?
- Just one, Sphinx.

838
00:58:27,456 --> 00:58:30,943
No. The fist, the knee,
the elbow, the head.

839
00:58:31,043 --> 00:58:37,078
you must lash out with every limb,
like the octopus who plays the drums.

840
00:58:40,344 --> 00:58:42,121
Why am I doing this again?

841
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:44,623
When you can balance a tack hammer
on your head...

842
00:58:44,723 --> 00:58:48,586
...you will head off your foes
with a balanced attack.

843
00:58:48,686 --> 00:58:52,596
And why am I wearing
the watermelon on my feet?

844
00:58:59,154 --> 00:59:02,554
I don't remember telling you to do that.

845
00:59:03,951 --> 00:59:05,951
Wait a minute. Wait.

846
00:59:25,931 --> 00:59:27,931
I believe in my powers.

847
00:59:28,267 --> 00:59:30,392
'I believe in my powers.'

848
00:59:30,811 --> 00:59:34,211
I believe in the powers of my teammates.

849
00:59:34,315 --> 00:59:37,593
'I believe in the powers of my teammates.'

850
00:59:37,693 --> 00:59:39,769
I trust in my powers.

851
00:59:40,112 --> 00:59:42,112
'I trust in my powers.'

852
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:45,226
I trust in the powers of my teammates.

853
00:59:45,326 --> 00:59:48,726
'I trust in the powers of my teammates.'

854
00:59:50,664 --> 00:59:53,359
This team must learn to work together...

855
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:55,617
...or mark my words...

856
00:59:55,711 --> 00:59:57,836
...it will be torn apart.

857
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,158
Now...

858
01:00:01,258 --> 01:00:02,868
...gather round.

859
01:00:02,968 --> 01:00:05,371
Gather round. Embrace one another.

860
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:08,956
Gather round.
Embrace one another quickly.

861
01:00:13,812 --> 01:00:16,257
Why do you stand aside
while the others practice?

862
01:00:16,357 --> 01:00:18,217
'Practice'?

863
01:00:18,317 --> 01:00:20,678
That's not practicing.
That's group hugging.

864
01:00:20,778 --> 01:00:23,639
We should be busting in
on Casanova right now.

865
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:29,349
He who questions training,
only trains himself at asking questions.

866
01:00:30,412 --> 01:00:32,412
What?

867
01:00:37,628 --> 01:00:40,990
Who was looking for the pinking shears?
- That was me.

868
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:42,533
yes...

869
01:00:42,633 --> 01:00:45,523
...work well on your new costumes.

870
01:00:46,595 --> 01:00:49,582
For when you care for what is outside...

871
01:00:49,682 --> 01:00:52,402
...what is inside cares for you.

872
01:00:52,977 --> 01:00:54,503
The clock is ticking here.

873
01:00:54,603 --> 01:00:58,132
Are we gonna sew dresses all day
or are we gonna rescue Amazing?

874
01:00:58,232 --> 01:01:01,051
I need a thimble. Does anybody--
- Patience, my son.

875
01:01:01,151 --> 01:01:03,512
To summon your power
for the coming conflict...

876
01:01:03,612 --> 01:01:06,849
...you must first have power
over that which conflicts you.

877
01:01:06,949 --> 01:01:10,644
Am I the only one who finds these sayings
just a little formulaic?

878
01:01:10,744 --> 01:01:13,355
'If you wanna push it down,
you have to pull it up.'

879
01:01:13,455 --> 01:01:15,483
'If you want to go left, you must go right.'

880
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:20,196
your temper is very quick,
but until you learn to master your rage--...

881
01:01:20,296 --> 01:01:23,441
...your rage will become your master?

882
01:01:23,757 --> 01:01:25,701
That's what you were gonna say, right?

883
01:01:25,801 --> 01:01:27,959
Right?
- Not necessarily.

884
01:01:29,013 --> 01:01:31,308
That's it. I'm out of here.

885
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:35,002
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Mysterioso,
but it's time to get busy.

886
01:01:35,102 --> 01:01:37,254
Come on, Eddie. Let's go.
- No, Roy.

887
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:40,591
He's getting results.
- The result is we're all out of here.

888
01:01:40,691 --> 01:01:43,921
Come on, Jeff. Let's peel some lilies.

889
01:01:44,695 --> 01:01:46,889
I don't want to leave the Sphinx.

890
01:01:46,989 --> 01:01:48,849
How about the rest of you?

891
01:01:48,949 --> 01:01:54,814
Do you want to play Suzie Homemaker,
or do you want to be superheroes?

892
01:02:01,295 --> 01:02:06,116
Okay, I don't need a compass to tell me
which way the wind shines.

893
01:02:06,216 --> 01:02:09,745
Let's talk about this.
- No, let's not talk about it.

894
01:02:09,845 --> 01:02:12,414
Do you want to sit here
making Halloween outfits...

895
01:02:12,514 --> 01:02:16,169
...or do you want to take care of business?

896
01:02:17,227 --> 01:02:21,817
Well, I guess from now on
I ride in a wolf pack of one.

897
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:31,517
We should go after him.
- He's okay.

898
01:02:31,617 --> 01:02:35,312
Just let him go. He's a baby.
- We've never gone into battle without him.

899
01:02:35,412 --> 01:02:37,189
If you love him, why not marry him?

900
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:40,604
Why don't you marry him?
- Why don't you?

901
01:02:40,751 --> 01:02:42,653
Bowler, Shoveler, please.

902
01:02:42,753 --> 01:02:47,575
Sphinx, what wisdom can you give us
in our most clouded hour?

903
01:02:47,675 --> 01:02:49,675
yeah, what do we do?

904
01:02:50,761 --> 01:02:56,286
The loss of manpower can be replaced
by the addition of firepower.

905
01:02:58,143 --> 01:03:01,046
Well, I won't use guns.
I've been clear about that.

906
01:03:01,146 --> 01:03:02,548
He won't even use a knife.

907
01:03:02,648 --> 01:03:05,259
you're not going to start
with that meshugas again?

908
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,553
Casanova will have many weapons.

909
01:03:07,653 --> 01:03:13,178
To beat him, you will have to have
more than forks and flatulence.

910
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:18,579
Heller.

911
01:03:25,421 --> 01:03:28,920
'Dr. A. Heller. Weapons designer...

912
01:03:29,425 --> 01:03:32,825
'...innovator, inventor, world changer.'

913
01:03:53,657 --> 01:03:56,018
Why does he live
in a deserted amusement park?

914
01:03:56,118 --> 01:03:58,270
Because he's an eccentric genius.

915
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:01,565
I'll take point. you two flank.
Let's triangulate.

916
01:04:01,665 --> 01:04:04,555
Equilateral or isosceles?
- Just go.

917
01:04:20,684 --> 01:04:23,489
Who would want to rent a chicken?

918
01:04:25,064 --> 01:04:28,549
It's weird in here. It's scary and weird.

919
01:04:39,787 --> 01:04:41,397
There's another chicken.

920
01:04:41,497 --> 01:04:43,497
Crazy chicken world.

921
01:04:55,052 --> 01:04:57,052
Dr. Heller?

922
01:04:58,305 --> 01:05:00,305
We come in peace.

923
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,751
Shovel Head?

924
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:05,504
The Shoveler.
We met at the old folks' home.

925
01:05:05,604 --> 01:05:07,604
Of course.

926
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,175
Fork Man?

927
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:12,386
No, I'm the Spleen. To see my power,
pull my finger.

928
01:05:12,486 --> 01:05:14,597
Please, don't.
- No, sir, don't.

929
01:05:14,697 --> 01:05:18,642
Dr. Heller, we're on a mission.
We've come for weapons.

930
01:05:18,742 --> 01:05:21,896
Shouldn't we see a diploma
or something first?

931
01:05:21,996 --> 01:05:26,586
you came to the right place, baby.
Step into my office.

932
01:05:29,712 --> 01:05:31,712
Where are your friends?

933
01:05:33,173 --> 01:05:34,783
What friends?

934
01:05:34,883 --> 01:05:36,410
your friends.

935
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:39,413
I thought you guys
were in a club or something.

936
01:05:39,513 --> 01:05:42,633
you mean a team? A Superteam?
- yeah.

937
01:05:43,225 --> 01:05:47,900
Apparently, it's now
the Super Sphinx Team or something.

938
01:05:48,063 --> 01:05:51,208
you had a falling out?
- yeah, kind of.

939
01:05:53,944 --> 01:05:55,846
Is it okay if I just have the coffee?

940
01:05:55,946 --> 01:05:58,156
I'm not very hungry.
- Sure.

941
01:06:04,496 --> 01:06:06,941
What time do you get off work?

942
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:09,041
Half hour.

943
01:06:09,668 --> 01:06:11,153
Why?

944
01:06:11,253 --> 01:06:14,365
No reason.
I was just thinking maybe I could....

945
01:06:14,465 --> 01:06:16,826
It might be a good idea
if I walked you home.

946
01:06:16,926 --> 01:06:19,411
The city's been real, real dangerous...

947
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:21,891
...since Amazing went M.I.A.

948
01:06:25,017 --> 01:06:28,087
I've been working on
some jujitsu moves that....

949
01:06:28,187 --> 01:06:31,298
It'd probably be safer
on everybody's part if....

950
01:06:31,398 --> 01:06:34,288
Also, it would be great to just...

951
01:06:35,235 --> 01:06:37,235
...walk you home.

952
01:06:38,656 --> 01:06:40,656
Sure.

953
01:06:44,703 --> 01:06:48,868
This will even things up a little bit.
What is it?

954
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:52,084
Look at this.
- Don't point at me.

955
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,215
you're gonna kill somebody.

956
01:06:55,714 --> 01:06:58,944
Listen, everything here is non-lethal.

957
01:07:00,052 --> 01:07:02,052
'Non-lethal'? What?

958
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:04,623
I don't make anything that's deadly.

959
01:07:04,723 --> 01:07:07,783
I see. How delightfully eccentric...

960
01:07:08,018 --> 01:07:10,504
...while simultaneously
being a waste of our time.

961
01:07:10,604 --> 01:07:12,590
No offense. Shall we?
- Thank you, Doctor.

962
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:14,884
I said good day.
- See you, Doc.

963
01:07:14,984 --> 01:07:18,596
That is why, in general,
a mad scientist is less desirable...

964
01:07:18,696 --> 01:07:21,671
...than a garden-variety scientist.

965
01:07:24,285 --> 01:07:26,285
Incoming.

966
01:07:30,499 --> 01:07:32,499
Look out.
- Watch out.

967
01:07:55,482 --> 01:07:57,482
Doc, you're a genius.

968
01:07:58,068 --> 01:08:00,068
A canned tornado?

969
01:08:00,154 --> 01:08:03,057
Totally non-lethal, but totally effective.

970
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:05,351
What is this thing
you were handling before?

971
01:08:05,451 --> 01:08:06,685
That's a shrinker.

972
01:08:06,785 --> 01:08:08,187
How do you know?

973
01:08:08,287 --> 01:08:10,022
A manual. Cool.

974
01:08:10,122 --> 01:08:13,651
That's a high-temperature,
fabric-adhesive, liquid projector...

975
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:17,406
...based on simple dry-cleaning technology.

976
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:19,878
you aim that at a guy...

977
01:08:21,342 --> 01:08:24,578
...his clothes get so tight
he can't even breathe.

978
01:08:24,678 --> 01:08:26,580
I can trick that out with a holster.

979
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,793
It comes with a leather carrying case.
It's got a wad cutter and a full warranty.

980
01:08:30,893 --> 01:08:32,044
Nicely done.

981
01:08:32,144 --> 01:08:35,422
What do you call this?
- Careful, careful. That's a blame-thrower.

982
01:08:35,522 --> 01:08:38,192
'A blame-thrower'?
- I'm sorry.

983
01:08:38,317 --> 01:08:40,302
your bad attitude is hurting this team.

984
01:08:40,402 --> 01:08:44,515
Stop spitting. I already took a shower.
- you need another one, 'cause you stink.

985
01:08:44,615 --> 01:08:47,476
Want me to pop that zit for you?
- I'm really shaking.

986
01:08:47,576 --> 01:08:52,421
you're always spraying.
- I'm sorry if I spit all the time.

987
01:08:53,457 --> 01:08:55,457
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

988
01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:57,501
No, no.

989
01:09:00,005 --> 01:09:04,425
Doctor, you are a genius.
- That's what the card says.

990
01:09:05,803 --> 01:09:09,039
I still want to be with them
when they go rescue Amazing.

991
01:09:09,139 --> 01:09:11,083
So why don't you just go back?

992
01:09:11,183 --> 01:09:13,419
No, I just left this morning.
That would be--...

993
01:09:13,519 --> 01:09:16,130
This is my place.
- That would be ridiculous.

994
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:21,093
They're your friends. They'll understand.
It's clearly what you want to do.

995
01:09:21,193 --> 01:09:23,318
That actually could work.

996
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:27,308
I'm Mr. Furious, right?
I'm unpredictable. I'm a loose cannon.

997
01:09:27,408 --> 01:09:30,269
I go storming off.
Why can't I come storming back?

998
01:09:30,369 --> 01:09:33,898
I mean, it's all in how you play it, right?
- Or don't play it.

999
01:09:33,998 --> 01:09:38,736
Just go back, say you're sorry
and help them save Captain Amazing.

1000
01:09:38,836 --> 01:09:42,072
you think there's a really angry way
I could say I'm sorry?

1001
01:09:42,172 --> 01:09:43,741
'Cause that's kind of my....

1002
01:09:43,841 --> 01:09:48,771
I gotta stick with the anger thing
'cause people like that.

1003
01:09:51,307 --> 01:09:54,543
Maybe people like you
for who you really are.

1004
01:09:54,643 --> 01:09:56,643
you know?

1005
01:09:57,938 --> 01:09:59,938
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1006
01:10:05,487 --> 01:10:08,207
you should go find your friends.

1007
01:10:20,419 --> 01:10:21,445
Good.

1008
01:10:21,545 --> 01:10:25,533
Now, the three of you
will be like the eagle's claw.

1009
01:10:25,633 --> 01:10:28,786
you will snatch up the hostage
and carry him to safety.

1010
01:10:28,886 --> 01:10:34,496
We three scouts are like the eagle's eye:
ever watchful for danger.

1011
01:10:35,142 --> 01:10:37,300
Are you ready?
- yes.

1012
01:10:37,394 --> 01:10:42,069
Then let operation Three-Eyed,
Three-Legged Eagle begin.

1013
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,763
Shotgun.

1014
01:10:47,863 --> 01:10:49,863
I think not, my friend.

1015
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,290
Silly twit.

1016
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:03,126
Give me a second.

1017
01:11:07,424 --> 01:11:09,424
Hey.
- What's up?

1018
01:11:09,677 --> 01:11:12,227
Not a lot. What's up with you?

1019
01:11:12,388 --> 01:11:14,388
Nothing much.

1020
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:20,986
Have you seen my address book?
- No. What did it look like?

1021
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:26,552
It's denim. It says 'Hang loose' on it
with a picture of a kitten.

1022
01:11:26,652 --> 01:11:28,652
No.

1023
01:11:30,281 --> 01:11:33,017
you should probably think
about where you saw it last.

1024
01:11:33,117 --> 01:11:35,117
Right.

1025
01:11:42,042 --> 01:11:44,042
I should probably....

1026
01:11:47,673 --> 01:11:50,988
Eddie, there's something I want to say.

1027
01:11:51,051 --> 01:11:54,663
I'm angry about being left out
of this mission...

1028
01:11:54,763 --> 01:11:59,523
...and about what's happening
with this team, but I'm....

1029
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:04,605
Oh, boy.

1030
01:12:06,942 --> 01:12:08,942
Temperature rising.

1031
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:12,070
Vision blurring.

1032
01:12:12,698 --> 01:12:14,987
Rage taking over.

1033
01:12:15,492 --> 01:12:17,645
I got an idea.
Why don't you come with us?

1034
01:12:17,745 --> 01:12:19,146
Okay.

1035
01:12:19,246 --> 01:12:21,246
Rage subsiding.

1036
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,541
Pulse slowing.

1037
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:27,669
Anger fading.

1038
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:33,685
That was quick thinking, Eddie.

1039
01:12:35,346 --> 01:12:38,831
Well, I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.

1040
01:13:07,503 --> 01:13:09,503
Drink, drink.

1041
01:13:16,053 --> 01:13:18,330
Right, then. I'll go and scout out a way in.

1042
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:21,333
What should the signal be?
- 'Caree, caroo.'

1043
01:13:21,433 --> 01:13:23,586
No, no, what about: 'whippoorwill'?

1044
01:13:23,686 --> 01:13:26,463
No, 'Caree, caroo.'
- yes, but isn't that better?

1045
01:13:26,563 --> 01:13:29,717
Not interested.
- Enough with the cuckoo.

1046
01:13:29,817 --> 01:13:32,344
We must find an open window.
- That's what I said.

1047
01:13:32,444 --> 01:13:34,444
Go, go.

1048
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,354
Does everyone have a drink?

1049
01:13:42,454 --> 01:13:45,174
yes, we all do.
- you're all good?

1050
01:13:45,416 --> 01:13:48,986
Good. Well, it is wonderful in my heart...

1051
01:13:49,628 --> 01:13:53,157
...to see so many familiar faces once again.

1052
01:13:53,257 --> 01:13:56,317
The Susies: assassins from the East.

1053
01:13:58,637 --> 01:14:02,708
The Suits: downsizing all those
who dare oppose them.

1054
01:14:02,808 --> 01:14:06,142
The Furriers: always dressed to kill.

1055
01:14:11,066 --> 01:14:15,693
The Frat Boys: still on probation
for lethal hazing.

1056
01:14:16,322 --> 01:14:17,389
Phi Zeta.

1057
01:14:17,489 --> 01:14:20,823
Of course, the Not So Goody Mob:

1058
01:14:21,827 --> 01:14:24,063
Putting the rhyme into crime.

1059
01:14:24,163 --> 01:14:26,106
The pleasure's all mine, Frankenstein.

1060
01:14:26,206 --> 01:14:29,318
We're about to perpetrate some evil
on the Champion City people.

1061
01:14:29,418 --> 01:14:31,713
Rappin', snappin', cappin'.

1062
01:14:32,046 --> 01:14:36,636
Tonight, we are having quite a party.
A surprise party.

1063
01:14:37,718 --> 01:14:40,371
I have a little something up my sleeve...

1064
01:14:40,471 --> 01:14:45,061
...and I'm not just talking
about the wart on my elbow.

1065
01:14:49,647 --> 01:14:52,850
I have created a beautiful machine...

1066
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:57,137
...that is going to encourage
our fellow citizens...

1067
01:14:57,237 --> 01:14:59,444
...to share my vision...

1068
01:14:59,949 --> 01:15:01,949
...of the world.

1069
01:15:02,868 --> 01:15:04,868
Can you dig it?

1070
01:15:07,164 --> 01:15:09,459
What about Captain Amazing?

1071
01:15:10,334 --> 01:15:13,989
That is an excellent question, Big Tobacco.

1072
01:15:14,296 --> 01:15:19,243
What will we do about the greatest
superhero Champion City has ever known?

1073
01:15:19,343 --> 01:15:23,554
For the answer,
I want you all to walk this way.

1074
01:15:24,056 --> 01:15:26,776
Dude, can we bring the brewskis?

1075
01:15:27,559 --> 01:15:32,064
yes, of course.
you may absolutely bring the brewskis.

1076
01:15:39,613 --> 01:15:42,248
Things look pretty quiet to me.

1077
01:15:46,287 --> 01:15:48,272
Invisible Boy, did you just let one go?

1078
01:15:48,372 --> 01:15:51,687
No, that wasn't me.
- Well, it wasn't me.

1079
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:59,590
Don't run. He'll shoot.

1080
01:16:08,475 --> 01:16:11,535
Is he doing what I think he's doing?

1081
01:16:16,275 --> 01:16:18,275
Just go with it.

1082
01:16:28,704 --> 01:16:31,254
Can anybody see anything?
- Hey.

1083
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:32,942
Who said 'hey'?
- Not me.

1084
01:16:33,042 --> 01:16:35,861
Eddie, you don't have to say,
'Not me,' okay?

1085
01:16:35,961 --> 01:16:39,782
If someone says, 'Who?' and you say--
- Morons, over here.

1086
01:16:39,882 --> 01:16:41,882
It's Captain Amazing.

1087
01:16:43,052 --> 01:16:48,492
We've been looking for you.
- Turn on the light switch behind you.

1088
01:16:52,144 --> 01:16:54,220
We meet again, Captain.

1089
01:16:54,438 --> 01:16:57,073
We're here to rescue you.
- yeah.

1090
01:16:58,108 --> 01:17:00,928
I'm Blue Raja. Do you recall me?
Master of silverware?

1091
01:17:01,028 --> 01:17:04,056
you said to keep up the good work
after the Red Eye skirmish.

1092
01:17:04,156 --> 01:17:07,810
I meet so many people in this business,
but I think so.

1093
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:11,147
you two, locate the master
ignition switch on the main console.

1094
01:17:11,247 --> 01:17:12,606
Could you open that up?

1095
01:17:12,706 --> 01:17:14,984
you'll be out in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

1096
01:17:15,084 --> 01:17:16,819
Frightfully uncomfortable.
- Great.

1097
01:17:16,919 --> 01:17:19,238
How does this work?
- I've seen one of these.

1098
01:17:19,338 --> 01:17:21,907
you've got to push this thing in and twist it.

1099
01:17:22,007 --> 01:17:24,827
Don't force it.
- She's right, my little friend.

1100
01:17:24,927 --> 01:17:27,496
This contraption is a weapon
of mass destruction.

1101
01:17:27,596 --> 01:17:30,791
Casanova plans to turn it
against the city tonight at midnight.

1102
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:32,585
Something's happening.

1103
01:17:32,685 --> 01:17:37,339
Very good. On the wall to your left
you should see two toggles side-by-side.

1104
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:41,010
'Toggles'? What do you mean?
you talking about switches?

1105
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:43,220
I see them, Captain.
- Thank you.

1106
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,040
Flip the first toggle.
- Flipping.

1107
01:17:48,534 --> 01:17:52,062
Excellent work. Now, flip the--
- Jolly good work, team.

1108
01:17:52,162 --> 01:17:54,940
Could you just stay over there, please?

1109
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,040
Of course.

1110
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,113
Sorry.

1111
01:18:01,213 --> 01:18:04,617
Now flip the second toggle.
- Do as he says.

1112
01:18:04,717 --> 01:18:06,994
The man knows what he's saying.

1113
01:18:07,094 --> 01:18:11,457
Captain, I'm just gonna ask you directly.
Do you know billionaire Lance Hunt?

1114
01:18:11,557 --> 01:18:13,557
It's me.

1115
01:18:14,184 --> 01:18:16,545
No, I'm kidding.
I've always wanted to do that.

1116
01:18:16,645 --> 01:18:19,965
What's next?
- I just told you, flip the second toggle.

1117
01:18:20,065 --> 01:18:22,307
Again?
- What do you mean?

1118
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,721
Flip the toggle twice?
- No, no.

1119
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:29,266
Don't do that. Just flip it again now.
One time. Flip it.

1120
01:18:29,366 --> 01:18:31,143
Does he understand what I'm asking?

1121
01:18:31,243 --> 01:18:35,815
Hold on a second.
Exactly how many toggle flips in toto...

1122
01:18:35,915 --> 01:18:37,775
...are involved in this procedure?

1123
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:41,374
I just.... It's...seven.

1124
01:18:42,379 --> 01:18:43,781
Seven?
- Flip it.

1125
01:18:43,881 --> 01:18:46,751
Seven?
- Everybody, hold the phone.

1126
01:18:46,842 --> 01:18:50,579
you phrased that incorrectly.
How many toggle flips are needed...

1127
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:54,041
...not counting the gratuitous toggle flip
you may have asked for...

1128
01:18:54,141 --> 01:18:56,544
...in a moment of panic.
- Flip it.

1129
01:18:56,644 --> 01:19:00,297
Could we just start again?
ls there a reset button on this thing?

1130
01:19:00,397 --> 01:19:03,676
No, you freak, there's no reset button.
Flip the switch, lady.

1131
01:19:03,776 --> 01:19:06,595
Don't stare at me.
Lift your left arm. Flip it, moron.

1132
01:19:06,695 --> 01:19:08,305
you're a moron.
- I am not.

1133
01:19:08,405 --> 01:19:11,058
Don't call her a moron. That's not cool.
- Thank you.

1134
01:19:11,158 --> 01:19:14,574
I will do it.
- Flip the switch.

1135
01:19:14,662 --> 01:19:16,662
It's this one, yes?

1136
01:19:18,082 --> 01:19:20,082
Wrong switch.

1137
01:19:37,434 --> 01:19:40,087
Everybody heard me say,
'Reset button,' right?

1138
01:19:40,187 --> 01:19:42,856
My God, we killed him.

1139
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,840
What do you mean 'we'? I was right here.

1140
01:20:00,374 --> 01:20:02,584
I'm gonna check his pulse.

1141
01:20:08,549 --> 01:20:10,451
I don't think he'll pull through.

1142
01:20:10,551 --> 01:20:13,454
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get out of here.

1143
01:20:13,554 --> 01:20:17,374
Everybody should just keep
holding their horses.

1144
01:20:17,474 --> 01:20:19,474
Go, go, go.

1145
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,900
God in heaven.

1146
01:20:34,533 --> 01:20:38,018
This sucker's dead.
- What happened to him?

1147
01:20:38,913 --> 01:20:40,731
As you can see...

1148
01:20:40,831 --> 01:20:43,721
...l have taken Captain Amazing...

1149
01:20:44,418 --> 01:20:46,418
...out of the picture.

1150
01:20:46,921 --> 01:20:49,046
It's time for us to rule.

1151
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:55,538
Tonight at midnight,
I'm going to do to Champion City...

1152
01:20:55,638 --> 01:20:58,916
...what I have done
to its greatest superhero.

1153
01:20:59,016 --> 01:21:03,436
There'll still be time to go up,
get down and boogie.

1154
01:21:04,855 --> 01:21:07,800
Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Where's Captain Amazing?

1155
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,594
There's been a bit of a cock-up.
- Raja murdered him.

1156
01:21:10,694 --> 01:21:14,265
Guys, I think we got bigger fish
to fry right now.

1157
01:21:14,365 --> 01:21:16,725
What the hell was that machine?
- I don't know.

1158
01:21:16,825 --> 01:21:20,140
But I know where we can go to find out.

1159
01:21:25,376 --> 01:21:27,586
The vermin are back, Tony.

1160
01:21:29,338 --> 01:21:32,738
Vermin should be exterminated, Casanova.

1161
01:21:33,926 --> 01:21:37,710
A fish fork is no match for my machine.

1162
01:21:39,348 --> 01:21:43,173
But I think we should take out
some insurance.

1163
01:21:43,227 --> 01:21:45,004
Don't you think?

1164
01:21:45,104 --> 01:21:46,797
It's a psychofrakulator.

1165
01:21:46,897 --> 01:21:50,676
It creates a cloud of radically fluctuating
free-deviant chaotrons...

1166
01:21:50,776 --> 01:21:53,179
...which penetrate the synaptic relays.

1167
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:56,932
It's concatenated with
a synchronous transport switch...

1168
01:21:57,032 --> 01:22:00,092
...that creates a virtual tributary.

1169
01:22:00,786 --> 01:22:03,522
It's focused onto a biobolic reflector.

1170
01:22:03,622 --> 01:22:08,382
And what happens is
that hallucinations become reality...

1171
01:22:08,669 --> 01:22:11,071
...and the brain is literally fried from within.

1172
01:22:11,171 --> 01:22:15,075
Where would you get it?
- I don't know, they said it couldn't be built.

1173
01:22:15,175 --> 01:22:18,871
The equations were so complex that
any of the scientists who worked on it...

1174
01:22:18,971 --> 01:22:20,414
...wound up in an insane asylum.

1175
01:22:20,514 --> 01:22:23,918
Which is where Casanova's been
for the last 20 years.

1176
01:22:24,018 --> 01:22:26,587
If he uses it, it'll waste Champion City.

1177
01:22:26,687 --> 01:22:29,006
Not 'if.' 'When.'
- We need Captain Amazing.

1178
01:22:29,106 --> 01:22:31,509
Unfortunately, we just killed him.

1179
01:22:31,609 --> 01:22:34,220
No, unfortunately, you killed him.

1180
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,723
Because you have problems at home
doesn't mean you can kill people.

1181
01:22:37,823 --> 01:22:41,648
'Sorry. Mummy. I'm English.
I didn't mean it.'

1182
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:44,365
K-l-L-L-E-D. you killed him.

1183
01:22:44,663 --> 01:22:47,066
you killed him. you hit the switch.

1184
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:50,736
It's the same difference. He's still dead.

1185
01:22:50,961 --> 01:22:53,086
you did kind of--
- Sphinx.

1186
01:22:54,256 --> 01:22:57,571
Sphinx, what in heaven's name do we do?

1187
01:22:58,344 --> 01:22:59,912
Sometimes...

1188
01:23:00,012 --> 01:23:04,542
...the true hero is the one
with the courage to run away.

1189
01:23:04,642 --> 01:23:08,212
I like the way this man thinks.
- Let's run.

1190
01:23:08,771 --> 01:23:10,297
We can't run.

1191
01:23:10,397 --> 01:23:14,052
yes. It's been established that we can run.

1192
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:20,015
This is egg salad loaded with cholesterol.
My wife won't even let me touch it.

1193
01:23:20,115 --> 01:23:25,130
Hardly seems to matter now.
Chances are, we're already dead.

1194
01:23:25,412 --> 01:23:26,856
Amazing is gone.

1195
01:23:26,956 --> 01:23:31,694
There's no use waiting for the cavalry,
because, as of now, the cavalry is us.

1196
01:23:31,794 --> 01:23:35,406
yeah, but I don't wanna get frakulated.
- Psychofrakulated.

1197
01:23:35,506 --> 01:23:39,910
We still get frakulated.
- This is our fight, whether we like it or not.

1198
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:42,538
We're not your classic superheroes.

1199
01:23:42,638 --> 01:23:45,875
We're not the favorites.
We're the other guys.

1200
01:23:45,975 --> 01:23:48,950
We're the guys nobody ever bets on.

1201
01:23:50,437 --> 01:23:52,089
But I'll tell you what I think.

1202
01:23:52,189 --> 01:23:56,302
you and that ball of yours
have an appointment you must keep.

1203
01:23:56,402 --> 01:23:59,763
Invisible Boy,
I think it's time you were seen.

1204
01:23:59,863 --> 01:24:02,433
Sphinx, you have trained us well.

1205
01:24:02,533 --> 01:24:06,562
Dr. Heller, you might
just have given us the edge we need.

1206
01:24:06,662 --> 01:24:10,147
Spleen, I don't want to stand behind you.

1207
01:24:10,165 --> 01:24:12,776
But I'll fight beside you with pride.

1208
01:24:12,876 --> 01:24:16,071
Jeff, you've got a rare and beautiful gift.

1209
01:24:16,171 --> 01:24:19,200
The city needs you tonight. And, Roy...

1210
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:23,579
...in all the years I've known you,
I've never seen you walk away from a fight.

1211
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:25,831
you lifted a city bus once.

1212
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:30,266
I think you've got what it takes
to handle Casanova.

1213
01:24:30,352 --> 01:24:33,005
We're all in over our heads,
and we know it.

1214
01:24:33,105 --> 01:24:36,133
But if we take on this fight,
those of us who survive it...

1215
01:24:36,233 --> 01:24:39,845
...will forever after show our scars
with pride and say:

1216
01:24:39,945 --> 01:24:44,365
'That's right. I was there.
I fought the good fight.'

1217
01:24:44,533 --> 01:24:45,935
So, what do you say?

1218
01:24:46,035 --> 01:24:50,965
Do we all gather together
and go kick some Casanova butt...

1219
01:24:51,707 --> 01:24:54,172
...or do I eat this sandwich?

1220
01:24:55,169 --> 01:24:58,059
I say, what the fork. Let's do it.

1221
01:25:00,132 --> 01:25:03,452
If we're gonna bust into that mansion
you need more than your car.

1222
01:25:03,552 --> 01:25:06,747
At the auto yard,
there's this old Herkimer battle jitney.

1223
01:25:06,847 --> 01:25:09,375
Wait. you have a Herkimer battle jitney?

1224
01:25:09,475 --> 01:25:12,378
That's the finest non-lethal
military vehicle ever made.

1225
01:25:12,478 --> 01:25:15,339
All right. We'll meet at the junkyard
and go from there.

1226
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:18,050
I shall need more forks, I'm afraid.

1227
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:20,803
Those who have loved ones,
say good-bye before we go.

1228
01:25:20,903 --> 01:25:23,538
you may not get another chance.

1229
01:25:28,994 --> 01:25:30,994
Zei gezunt.

1230
01:25:40,464 --> 01:25:42,464
Hey, Mom.

1231
01:25:42,841 --> 01:25:45,221
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

1232
01:25:45,844 --> 01:25:47,844
I was just....

1233
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:57,060
I'm a superhero, Mother.

1234
01:25:57,398 --> 01:25:58,924
A superhero?

1235
01:25:59,024 --> 01:26:01,385
An effete British superhero, to be precise.

1236
01:26:01,485 --> 01:26:04,680
I am pilfering your tableware
because I hurl it.

1237
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:08,767
I hurl it with a deadly accuracy.
The Blue Raja is my name.

1238
01:26:08,867 --> 01:26:11,687
I don't wear much blue,
and I speak in a British accent.

1239
01:26:11,787 --> 01:26:13,898
If you know your history, it makes sense.

1240
01:26:13,998 --> 01:26:16,734
The point is, your boy's
a Limey fork-flinger, Mother.

1241
01:26:16,834 --> 01:26:20,234
Hard cheese to swallow, but there it is.

1242
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:23,141
What will the bridge club think?

1243
01:26:26,802 --> 01:26:28,802
you need more forks?

1244
01:26:32,641 --> 01:26:35,920
These belonged to
your great-great-grandmother.

1245
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:38,339
I was saving these for your wedding day.

1246
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:43,709
But, from the looks of it,
that day is probably a long way off.

1247
01:26:43,944 --> 01:26:47,344
Mom, you're taking this incredibly well.

1248
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,434
I've always known you were special...

1249
01:26:50,534 --> 01:26:54,019
...but I just never realized how special.

1250
01:26:59,752 --> 01:27:01,752
I'd better get going.

1251
01:27:02,046 --> 01:27:03,531
I've got a city to save.

1252
01:27:03,631 --> 01:27:05,449
Jeffrey?
- yeah?

1253
01:27:05,549 --> 01:27:07,549
Do the accent.

1254
01:27:09,553 --> 01:27:13,082
I'd love to stay and chitchat,
but I fear I must away with me.

1255
01:27:13,182 --> 01:27:16,043
Our metropolis is
in the clutches of madmen.

1256
01:27:16,143 --> 01:27:17,503
Jeffrey?

1257
01:27:17,603 --> 01:27:19,797
Cheerio.
- I really should get going.

1258
01:27:19,897 --> 01:27:21,897
Okay.

1259
01:27:24,443 --> 01:27:26,443
Thanks, Ma.

1260
01:27:35,412 --> 01:27:38,812
I said I'd leave you, Eddie. I meant it.

1261
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,613
The city's in peril, Lucille.
We're the best hope they've got.

1262
01:27:44,713 --> 01:27:47,039
Eddie, please don't start.

1263
01:27:47,675 --> 01:27:49,702
I don't expect you to believe me.

1264
01:27:49,802 --> 01:27:52,267
I just came by to tell you...

1265
01:27:52,721 --> 01:27:54,165
...that I love you.

1266
01:27:54,265 --> 01:27:56,250
Tell the kids I love them.

1267
01:27:56,350 --> 01:27:58,350
And now...

1268
01:27:59,061 --> 01:28:01,896
...good-bye.
- Good-bye, Eddie.

1269
01:28:03,232 --> 01:28:05,801
I won't be here when you come home.

1270
01:28:05,901 --> 01:28:08,791
That's a chance I'll have to take.

1271
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:23,875
Wish me luck.

1272
01:28:34,138 --> 01:28:37,374
you okay?
- I wanted to say I had a great time tonight.

1273
01:28:37,474 --> 01:28:39,460
And you were really nice to me.

1274
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:43,045
And I would love to ask you out sometime.

1275
01:28:43,063 --> 01:28:46,467
But if I don't call you,
I want you to know it's because I'm dead.

1276
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:50,137
Me and my team are going
to take on Casanova Frankenstein.

1277
01:28:50,237 --> 01:28:52,431
It's pretty much a suicide mission.

1278
01:28:52,531 --> 01:28:57,036
So, if there is anything
that you want to say to me...

1279
01:28:57,202 --> 01:29:01,190
...now would probably be a good time
to say it, just 'cause....

1280
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:04,151
...yeah, I got a question for you.
- Cool. Kick it.

1281
01:29:04,251 --> 01:29:05,945
What's your name?

1282
01:29:06,045 --> 01:29:08,739
Do you mean my secret identity?
'Cause I couldn't....

1283
01:29:08,839 --> 01:29:11,413
No, I just mean your name.

1284
01:29:12,927 --> 01:29:14,927
My name.

1285
01:29:19,683 --> 01:29:21,972
It's Phoenix.

1286
01:29:23,938 --> 01:29:25,938
Phoenix Dark.

1287
01:29:27,232 --> 01:29:29,232
Dirk. Phoenix...

1288
01:29:30,903 --> 01:29:31,846
...Dark-Dirk.

1289
01:29:31,946 --> 01:29:36,475
I was christened Dirk Steele,
and I changed it to Phoenix.

1290
01:29:36,575 --> 01:29:38,870
Forget about it. It's okay.

1291
01:29:45,584 --> 01:29:47,584
It's Roy.

1292
01:29:48,712 --> 01:29:51,262
That's my name. My name is....

1293
01:29:52,216 --> 01:29:54,216
My real name is Roy.

1294
01:30:14,196 --> 01:30:16,272
Just be Roy.

1295
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:29,123
Roy. I'm Roy.

1296
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:30,571
yes, I'm Roy.

1297
01:30:30,671 --> 01:30:34,283
Roy. Who is Roy? Roy is who?
- He's freaking out, man.

1298
01:30:34,383 --> 01:30:36,869
Where's the guy who pretends
not to be Roy?

1299
01:30:36,969 --> 01:30:41,749
We've had quite enough of that. Stop it.
Just snap out of it. We're tired of it.

1300
01:30:41,849 --> 01:30:46,143
I'm a true wanna-be,
in the worst sense of the....

1301
01:30:46,437 --> 01:30:48,714
...you guys have to fight this battle
without me.

1302
01:30:48,814 --> 01:30:51,509
If you doubt your superpowers,
you are shafted.

1303
01:30:51,609 --> 01:30:55,095
If I had any superpowers to doubt,
I'd be in trouble, but I don't.

1304
01:30:55,195 --> 01:30:57,306
What do I do? All I do is go....

1305
01:30:57,406 --> 01:31:00,184
Roy, what are you talking about?
you lifted a bus once.

1306
01:31:00,284 --> 01:31:02,561
Precisely. That story's legendary.

1307
01:31:02,661 --> 01:31:06,244
It was really more of a push than a lift.

1308
01:31:06,332 --> 01:31:09,443
That still takes
incredible superhuman strength.

1309
01:31:09,543 --> 01:31:11,987
It does. To push an entire bus out the way.

1310
01:31:12,087 --> 01:31:14,824
Actually, the driver had his foot
on the accelerator...

1311
01:31:14,924 --> 01:31:17,159
...to get it going, then it actually was me.

1312
01:31:17,259 --> 01:31:19,259
But he kind of....

1313
01:31:21,972 --> 01:31:23,972
Shit.

1314
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:29,770
Excuse me.

1315
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:35,970
It starts a process which results
in an accelerated flow of electrons...

1316
01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:38,222
...that creates a powerful magnetic force.

1317
01:31:38,322 --> 01:31:40,808
This is basically like a huge electromagnet.

1318
01:31:40,908 --> 01:31:44,019
Actually, it's an electro-nuclear-magnet.

1319
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:45,771
It's the next inevitable phase.

1320
01:31:45,871 --> 01:31:49,400
Vis, can you close up those jockey boxes?
- Right on it.

1321
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:53,410
Let's get suited up.
We're out of here in five.

1322
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:59,258
It's time.

1323
01:32:00,844 --> 01:32:02,844
Let's go.

1324
01:32:54,273 --> 01:32:57,092
Shotgun.
- I already called it, didn't l?

1325
01:32:57,192 --> 01:33:00,346
Have a seat, my friend.
- Everybody ready?

1326
01:33:00,446 --> 01:33:04,101
We have lift-off.
- May the forks be with us.

1327
01:33:09,371 --> 01:33:12,733
Sorry. Too much throttle.
- That's cool. I'm just gonna go.

1328
01:33:12,833 --> 01:33:15,917
No, sit down.
- All right, here we go.

1329
01:33:29,475 --> 01:33:31,475
Vaya con Dios.

1330
01:33:35,606 --> 01:33:37,883
Somebody do something. We need him.

1331
01:33:37,983 --> 01:33:40,344
Let's do this. you're a very furious man.

1332
01:33:40,444 --> 01:33:42,304
Do you understand that?
- No.

1333
01:33:42,404 --> 01:33:45,307
you got a lot to be furious about,
and I'll tell you why.

1334
01:33:45,407 --> 01:33:49,311
you're not well-liked.
you're abrasive and off-putting.

1335
01:33:49,411 --> 01:33:52,064
you try to be pithy,
but your wit is a hindrance...

1336
01:33:52,164 --> 01:33:54,066
...therefore, nothing is provocative.

1337
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:57,069
It's just mixed metaphors.
Doesn't that make you angry?

1338
01:33:57,169 --> 01:33:59,071
Does it infuriate you?
- No.

1339
01:33:59,171 --> 01:34:02,366
It should. Are you angry? Come on, man.

1340
01:34:02,466 --> 01:34:07,821
your penmanship is atrocious.
- you dress like a male prostitute.

1341
01:34:11,517 --> 01:34:14,747
Get real. I have no powers whatsoever.

1342
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:17,631
If he has no powers,
maybe I've got no powers.

1343
01:34:17,731 --> 01:34:20,968
Maybe I can't turn invisible at all.
- Do not go there, son.

1344
01:34:21,068 --> 01:34:24,346
When you doubt your powers,
you give power to your doubts.

1345
01:34:24,446 --> 01:34:28,267
I don't mean to be an alarmist,
but it's 11:30 already.

1346
01:34:28,367 --> 01:34:30,853
Thirty minutes till Casanova
blows up the city.

1347
01:34:30,953 --> 01:34:34,785
Listen. We've got a blind date with destiny.

1348
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:40,240
And it looks like she's ordered the lobster.

1349
01:34:40,588 --> 01:34:42,588
Hang on.

1350
01:34:42,756 --> 01:34:45,136
We're going to ram the gate.

1351
01:35:02,943 --> 01:35:07,958
What do you think?
Should we knock or just let ourselves in?

1352
01:35:22,755 --> 01:35:24,755
Hit the ground.

1353
01:35:41,315 --> 01:35:43,315
They're shooting.

1354
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:02,385
I hope this magnet thing works.

1355
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,600
It's working.

1356
01:36:29,613 --> 01:36:31,613
Go. Go.

1357
01:36:33,158 --> 01:36:36,473
Quickly. Everybody into the disco room.

1358
01:36:40,165 --> 01:36:43,225
Everyone, through here. Keep moving.

1359
01:36:43,919 --> 01:36:46,554
Focus, people. Focus. Let's go.

1360
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,720
Hello?

1361
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:04,479
Wait.

1362
01:37:12,281 --> 01:37:14,281
Laser eye.

1363
01:37:25,669 --> 01:37:27,947
I should have brought my large pie server.

1364
01:37:28,047 --> 01:37:32,637
If we can't get through that door,
this battle is over.

1365
01:37:35,137 --> 01:37:36,956
This is it.

1366
01:37:37,056 --> 01:37:39,132
My time has come.

1367
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,895
What are you talking about?

1368
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:45,172
Wait. Invisible Boy.
- I wouldn't do that, if--...

1369
01:37:45,272 --> 01:37:48,968
Come back here. you'll be cremated.
- It's all about me now.

1370
01:37:49,068 --> 01:37:51,971
I'm the only one that can save us.
- He's right.

1371
01:37:52,071 --> 01:37:54,598
Good luck, son.
- Nobody look at me.

1372
01:37:54,698 --> 01:37:59,288
Don't look at him, or it won't work.
- I am transparent.

1373
01:37:59,411 --> 01:38:02,726
I am like the window. I am see-through.

1374
01:38:02,915 --> 01:38:04,915
I'm like Saran Wrap.

1375
01:38:14,843 --> 01:38:18,372
I did it. I'm invisible.
I really do have superpowers.

1376
01:38:18,472 --> 01:38:20,472
Can you see me?

1377
01:38:20,516 --> 01:38:22,516
yes.

1378
01:38:23,811 --> 01:38:25,045
Two hands there, son.

1379
01:38:25,145 --> 01:38:30,384
Maybe you should put some shorts on
if you want to keep fighting evil.

1380
01:38:30,484 --> 01:38:33,304
Furriers, you will stay here
and delay the attackers.

1381
01:38:33,404 --> 01:38:38,392
Not So Goody Mob, fight from behind.
The rest of you, into the atrium.

1382
01:38:38,492 --> 01:38:42,657
Spread yourselves out
for a second wave of attack.

1383
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:54,590
The door. Door.

1384
01:38:55,134 --> 01:38:58,384
On three. One, two, three.

1385
01:39:13,527 --> 01:39:15,527
Shrink 'em.

1386
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:31,453
I say, they've gone from junior
to missy petite.

1387
01:39:32,421 --> 01:39:33,239
My dress.

1388
01:39:33,339 --> 01:39:36,700
Now that's a wedgie she won't soon forget.

1389
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,370
My pants feel like they're shrinking, too.

1390
01:39:46,477 --> 01:39:48,683
Blame thrower.
- Look out.

1391
01:39:53,275 --> 01:39:55,010
I got a bone to pick with you.

1392
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:56,846
Hold it.

1393
01:39:56,946 --> 01:39:57,972
I'm boss.

1394
01:39:58,072 --> 01:40:00,962
you know what? y'all make me sick.

1395
01:40:09,959 --> 01:40:11,959
Give me that gun.

1396
01:40:16,048 --> 01:40:18,173
I got 'em.
- Disco forever.

1397
01:40:18,884 --> 01:40:21,434
Invisible Boy, Spleen. Susies.

1398
01:41:12,146 --> 01:41:14,146
Dig this, Shovel Man.

1399
01:41:22,031 --> 01:41:23,641
Duck. It's the Susies.

1400
01:41:23,741 --> 01:41:25,866
Grab the gun.
- It's stuck.

1401
01:41:26,785 --> 01:41:28,437
Coast clear?

1402
01:41:28,537 --> 01:41:30,537
Shoot anyway.

1403
01:41:32,917 --> 01:41:35,402
I'm scared.
- No, you're not scared. Be strong.

1404
01:41:35,502 --> 01:41:38,155
Say it with me,
'I ain't scared of no Susies.'

1405
01:41:38,255 --> 01:41:40,699
I am scared.
- Say 'I'm not scared of no Susies.'

1406
01:41:40,799 --> 01:41:42,799
Come on. you ready?

1407
01:41:43,052 --> 01:41:45,052
Let's go.

1408
01:41:52,853 --> 01:41:54,853
Dive.

1409
01:42:05,908 --> 01:42:07,518
I'm hit.

1410
01:42:07,618 --> 01:42:10,785
Where?
- I'm hit. Medic. Man down.

1411
01:42:10,871 --> 01:42:13,065
Man down. I can't feel my ass.
- What?

1412
01:42:13,165 --> 01:42:15,165
I can't feel my ass.

1413
01:42:15,292 --> 01:42:16,652
your powers still work?

1414
01:42:16,752 --> 01:42:18,877
My powers? Weapons check.

1415
01:42:21,423 --> 01:42:23,630
Fire in the hole.

1416
01:42:28,138 --> 01:42:29,999
It'll do.
- Spleen.

1417
01:42:30,099 --> 01:42:33,669
Go check on Spleen, okay?
- Okay. All right.

1418
01:42:37,022 --> 01:42:38,549
you ought to run, Tony P.

1419
01:42:38,649 --> 01:42:41,284
you can't hurt me, Baby Bowler.

1420
01:42:42,278 --> 01:42:44,278
'Cause I'm protected...

1421
01:42:45,864 --> 01:42:48,159
...by the god of hair care.

1422
01:42:50,452 --> 01:42:52,771
And it's time to send you
back to your daddy.

1423
01:42:52,871 --> 01:42:56,775
you killed my father.
- That's right.'Cause I'm a killer.

1424
01:42:56,875 --> 01:42:59,850
And you're not. Let's face it, kid.

1425
01:43:00,129 --> 01:43:02,573
you don't have the guts to kill me.

1426
01:43:02,673 --> 01:43:05,951
you're right.
I don't have the guts to kill you.

1427
01:43:06,051 --> 01:43:09,079
Because I'm better than you.
yeah, that's right.

1428
01:43:09,179 --> 01:43:11,179
A lot better.

1429
01:43:11,599 --> 01:43:15,849
I may even find the courage
to forgive you someday.

1430
01:43:24,403 --> 01:43:30,351
Carmine, on the other hand, feels
differently than I do about forgiveness.

1431
01:43:30,451 --> 01:43:33,604
Now I'm going back to graduate school.
That was the agreement.

1432
01:43:33,704 --> 01:43:36,690
We're doing it. We're winning.
We're gonna pull this off.

1433
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:39,595
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1434
01:43:39,752 --> 01:43:43,572
Tell your funny-looking friends
to put down their weapons, Mr. Furious.

1435
01:43:43,672 --> 01:43:46,116
Get out of here. He's crazy.
Save yourselves.

1436
01:43:46,216 --> 01:43:50,746
Put them down or I will slash
your girlfriend's pretty little throat.

1437
01:43:50,846 --> 01:43:53,311
Eddie, Jeff, do what he says.

1438
01:43:58,145 --> 01:44:00,005
Thank you.

1439
01:44:00,105 --> 01:44:04,927
It's so easy to get the best of people
when they care about each other.

1440
01:44:05,027 --> 01:44:07,972
Which is why evil will always
have the edge.

1441
01:44:08,072 --> 01:44:11,982
you good guys are always
so bound by the rules.

1442
01:44:18,624 --> 01:44:21,079
you see, I kill my own men.

1443
01:44:27,675 --> 01:44:29,675
Lucky me.

1444
01:44:30,135 --> 01:44:32,135
I get the girl.

1445
01:44:33,055 --> 01:44:35,055
No.

1446
01:45:01,917 --> 01:45:05,997
Don't worry.
It will all be over so very quickly.

1447
01:45:11,135 --> 01:45:12,328
What are you doing?

1448
01:45:12,428 --> 01:45:15,164
They ripped the 'Q' section
out of my dictionary...

1449
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:19,769
...'cause I don't know the meaning
of the word 'quit.'

1450
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:35,715
you want a little fisticuffs? Okay.

1451
01:45:39,121 --> 01:45:41,121
Get him, Roy.

1452
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:48,170
Come on, Roy.

1453
01:46:01,685 --> 01:46:03,420
It's the funkyskunkulator.

1454
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:07,430
We've got to stop it.
- Don't touch any toggles.

1455
01:46:07,942 --> 01:46:10,267
Rage taking over.

1456
01:46:10,653 --> 01:46:13,440
Ja. We've heard all that before.

1457
01:46:14,615 --> 01:46:16,267
No, no.

1458
01:46:16,367 --> 01:46:18,490
Rage really taking over.

1459
01:47:09,545 --> 01:47:12,036
Frak you later, Frankenpuss.

1460
01:47:20,097 --> 01:47:22,097
yeah.

1461
01:47:39,783 --> 01:47:41,783
Get out of here.

1462
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:48,790
Hit the deck.

1463
01:47:52,171 --> 01:47:54,806
How do we shut this thing down?

1464
01:47:55,424 --> 01:47:56,992
Group hug.

1465
01:47:57,092 --> 01:47:59,092
yeah.
- Okay.

1466
01:48:05,142 --> 01:48:08,287
Hurry up.
- Get her closer to the hole.

1467
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:14,330
Dad, this is the way it has to be.

1468
01:48:14,401 --> 01:48:17,972
The upshot is you won't be killed
because you're already dead.

1469
01:48:18,072 --> 01:48:19,932
No, I'm not going with you.

1470
01:48:20,032 --> 01:48:23,686
If there's a time for separation,
let me tell you something, this is it.

1471
01:48:23,786 --> 01:48:25,479
Lift me up.
- Push her up.

1472
01:48:25,579 --> 01:48:27,619
Help me lift her up.

1473
01:48:29,041 --> 01:48:31,081
you can do it. Hold on.

1474
01:48:35,756 --> 01:48:38,674
Do it.
- I love you, Dad.

1475
01:48:49,353 --> 01:48:52,437
Run. Run.
- Let's get out of here.

1476
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:56,900
Run for your lives.

1477
01:49:08,831 --> 01:49:09,648
Go.

1478
01:49:09,748 --> 01:49:11,748
Watch out.

1479
01:49:19,091 --> 01:49:21,091
Go.

1480
01:49:32,896 --> 01:49:35,758
No one could survive the chaos
we've just witnessed here.

1481
01:49:35,858 --> 01:49:39,970
But as the dust begins to settle over
the ruins of Casanova's mansion...

1482
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:42,110
...the question remains:

1483
01:49:42,114 --> 01:49:46,352
Who were these brave heroes that
gave their lives to save our city tonight?

1484
01:49:46,452 --> 01:49:49,063
Did that frakulator work, or what?
What's the deal?

1485
01:49:49,163 --> 01:49:51,732
Something's moving.
People are coming out.

1486
01:49:51,832 --> 01:49:55,194
Could you tell us what's going on?
- Hi. Excuse me.

1487
01:49:55,294 --> 01:49:58,656
Excuse me. Can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

1488
01:49:58,756 --> 01:49:59,907
We did it. We won.

1489
01:50:00,007 --> 01:50:02,007
Hey, that's my team.

1490
01:50:02,343 --> 01:50:05,120
We struck down evil
with the mighty sword of teamwork...

1491
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:08,123
...and the hammer of not-bickering.
- We are number one.

1492
01:50:08,223 --> 01:50:10,376
All others are number two or lower.

1493
01:50:10,476 --> 01:50:13,462
Who are you guys?
- They call me the Shoveler.

1494
01:50:13,562 --> 01:50:15,562
That's my dad.

1495
01:50:16,941 --> 01:50:17,967
My hero.

1496
01:50:18,067 --> 01:50:20,067
I'm the Bowler. Hello.

1497
01:50:22,613 --> 01:50:25,391
Blue Raja, master of silverware. Hi, Mom.

1498
01:50:25,491 --> 01:50:27,779
I mean, cheerio, Mummy.

1499
01:50:28,869 --> 01:50:30,688
Jeffrey.

1500
01:50:30,788 --> 01:50:34,024
And you, sir.
What's your name and your superpower?

1501
01:50:34,124 --> 01:50:35,693
My name's Roy.

1502
01:50:35,793 --> 01:50:38,612
I'm in a super amount of pain.
Could you leave me alone?

1503
01:50:38,712 --> 01:50:43,159
His name's Mr. Furious, and his power
comes from his boundless rage.

1504
01:50:43,259 --> 01:50:46,954
Excuse me. Could I say something?
I think we would all like this victory...

1505
01:50:47,054 --> 01:50:49,373
...to go out to all the other guys.

1506
01:50:49,473 --> 01:50:50,916
The people in this city...

1507
01:50:51,016 --> 01:50:54,003
...who are super good at theirjobs
but never get credit...

1508
01:50:54,103 --> 01:50:56,463
...like the lady in the D.M.V.
That's a rough job.

1509
01:50:56,563 --> 01:50:59,675
To the people that remember jingles
from old commercials.

1510
01:50:59,775 --> 01:51:02,636
People that support local music
and independent film.

1511
01:51:02,736 --> 01:51:05,764
The guy that drives the snowplow.
The school nurse--

1512
01:51:05,864 --> 01:51:07,683
Eddie, I think they got the point.

1513
01:51:07,783 --> 01:51:09,476
What's the name of this group?

1514
01:51:09,576 --> 01:51:10,811
The Super Dudes.

1515
01:51:10,911 --> 01:51:12,229
No, not the Super Dudes.

1516
01:51:12,329 --> 01:51:15,900
We don't have a name yet,
but we're definitely not the Super Dudes.

1517
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,651
I gotta get home. It's late.

1518
01:51:17,751 --> 01:51:19,874
Picture, picture time.

1519
01:51:22,881 --> 01:51:25,618
Whatever you call them,
Champion City will forever...

1520
01:51:25,718 --> 01:51:28,704
...owe a debt of gratitude
to these mystery men.

1521
01:51:28,804 --> 01:51:30,664
Wait. That's it.

1522
01:51:30,764 --> 01:51:33,718
We are the Super Squad.

1523
01:51:34,184 --> 01:51:35,794
No.

1524
01:51:35,894 --> 01:51:39,464
Alliteration in these situations is corny.

1525
01:51:39,565 --> 01:51:40,799
What?

1526
01:51:40,899 --> 01:51:43,761
yes, we're all very aware
that you saved the day...

1527
01:51:43,861 --> 01:51:49,556
...and I'm sure we'll be hearing about it
for the rest of our lives.
