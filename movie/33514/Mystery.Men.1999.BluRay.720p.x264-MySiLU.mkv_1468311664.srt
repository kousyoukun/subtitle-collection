来颗糖？

2
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:50,075
--http://7ays.com--
这是什么？股东卖场吗？

3
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:52,033
--http://7ays.com--
All right, boys, fan out!

4
00:01:52,117 --> 00:01:54,242
--http://7ays.com--
What a wrinkle-fest this is.

5
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,533
--http://7ays.com--
Beat it, you broads! Come on!

6
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:04,158
All right, sit down and shut up!

7
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:07,866
We're the Red Eyes.
Everybody, freeze!

8
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:11,574
Get their valuables, boys. I
want watches, wallets, jewelry.

9
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,949
Get me some silver chains.
I want wigs and toupees.

10
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,199
Keep an eye out
for me, will you?

11
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:22,617
- Rolex!
- No, it's mine!

12
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,575
Leave me alone! I'm a veteran!

13
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:27,408
No! Not that!

14
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,617
I love crashing parties!

15
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,408
Cake!

16
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,366
Pardon me, fatty.

17
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:45,782
If you're going to eat cake,
you ought to use a fork.

18
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:49,032
You might just as
well shovel it in.

19
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:56,657
People who don't close their
mouths when they chew...

20
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,532
...make me furious.

21
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:09,574
One for you.

22
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:12,241
And for you!

23
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,656
Want a little whipped
cream, Mr. Cherry Top?

24
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:23,531
Get him!

25
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:27,907
Is that all you got?

26
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,116
- Throw it!
- Not today, my vermilion-eyed varlet.

27
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:42,074
Blast.

28
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:43,907
Out of the way!

29
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:56,865
Yes, this one should stick.

30
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,656
Oh, my!

31
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:04,698
That's right up the Khyber!

32
00:04:23,905 --> 00:04:25,489
It's Captain Amazing!

33
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,489
It's Amazing! I'm out of here!

34
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:54,447
C.A., you were, if I
may say, amazing.

35
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:57,697
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Let's go meet the press.

36
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:00,822
He is good.

37
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:02,989
He is rather ripping.

38
00:05:03,072 --> 00:05:05,697
The spinning and the
hurtling and the kicking.

39
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,614
I guarantee he hogs the
credit on this one.

40
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:10,739
I think we have to...

41
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:13,614
...at least concede him
the assist here, Roy.

42
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:16,489
No. That's exactly
what's holding us back.

43
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:19,489
Don't put him on the pedestal.
Put us on the pedestal.

44
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:21,030
Here he comes.

45
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,529
Bravo and huzzah, Captain.
Splendid work, as usual.

46
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:28,279
No autographs till we
finish with the press.

47
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:31,029
We're not... Allow me
to introduce myself.

48
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:34,904
Blue Raja, master of silverware, forks
a "speciality," at your service.

49
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:37,946
- My colleague, the Shoveler.
- Big fan of your work.

50
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,697
Standing rather painfully aside
is our cohort, Mr. Furious.

51
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,155
- How's it hanging?
- So you guys...

52
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,072
They're superheroes.

53
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,572
- We fight crime. Call it what you will.
- Quite right.

54
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:52,989
That's great. Just, you know...

55
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:55,364
...keep up the good work.

56
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,238
You as well, sir. You as well.

57
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,363
Did you see? Did you...

58
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:07,071
Did you hear that? "Keep
up the good work."

59
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:09,321
- The good work.
- He's making fun of us.

60
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:11,988
No, Roy. He saluted us.
That was real.

61
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,071
- I thought he was sincere.
- What's up?

62
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,113
Hello. Nice to see you.

63
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,071
I saw the action
out there tonight.

64
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:22,779
What you guys need is a
little bit of firepower.

65
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:25,946
I'm a weapons designer.

66
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,112
- I've got what you need.
- All right. We'll come back.

67
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:34,695
We'll visit all of you people later.
Thank you, sir.

68
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,945
I don't live here. I'm
here for the ladies.

69
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:41,903
Here, take my card.

70
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,904
My name's Heller.
Say it with me.

71
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:47,738
Heller.

72
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:50,321
All right. Thank you.

73
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:55,071
Why do you encourage
those people?

74
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:58,279
- Those people look up to us.
- That's true.

75
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:03,362
- You know the drill.
- Please sign my hat, Captain Amazing.

76
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:05,903
Herman, give me a flash.

77
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:08,320
How are you tonight?

78
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:11,278
Captain, how did you know
where to find the Red Eyes?

79
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:14,070
Becky, it's what I do.

80
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:18,653
Thanks to you, the city's almost crime free.
What do you do with your free time?

81
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:20,695
I wish I had some free time.

82
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:24,320
People are saying you're so "amazing"
you'll put yourself out of a job.

83
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:28,195
- Have any comments on that?
- That's one problem I look forward to.

84
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:31,528
And is it true that you lost
your Pepsi endorsement?

85
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,403
I hadn't heard that.

86
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,986
Thanks for your questions.

87
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,444
You have no comment regarding
your Pepsi situation?

88
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:52,112
Look who we got.

89
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:54,112
You again. Wanna-bes.

90
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:57,737
This city already
has a superhero.

91
00:07:57,862 --> 00:08:01,278
- Perhaps you've heard of Captain Amazing.
- Thank you.

92
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:05,195
Do yourself a favor, McGuire.

93
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,320
Don't flip my switch tonight.

94
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,027
He's a big baby.

95
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,777
And what exactly would that do?

96
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:15,027
Don't turn around, Roy.
Don't do it.

97
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,736
- It's not worth it.
- Keep walking.

98
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,444
It's not worth it.

99
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,694
You know exactly what
that would do...

100
00:08:26,402 --> 00:08:27,652
...checkerhead.

101
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:31,944
What?

102
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:36,152
Don't mess with the
volcano, my man.

103
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:41,943
'Cause I will go
Pompeii on your butt.

104
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:46,776
My golly. Good grief.

105
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:50,860
You keep dreaming, Wanna-be.

106
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:54,776
Let's go.

107
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:56,736
Dream on, moron.

108
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,902
I will keep dreaming, my friend.

109
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:03,027
And when I wake up,
you better hope...

110
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:06,444
...you better hope
you're asleep.

111
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:09,569
- Don't re-engage him. He's a silly...
- Sweet dreams!

112
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:11,486
- He's immature.
- Lilac.

113
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,651
C.A., I'm doing my best.

114
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:19,693
Your best? Quick question:

115
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,943
Is this your best?

116
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:26,193
- I realize you're upset.
- Victor, I'm positioned.

117
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:30,401
Do you understand what that means,
on a very personal level here...

118
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:33,360
...to know the companies
that make these products...

119
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,651
...want me to be
their spokesperson?

120
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,901
Their voice?

121
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:39,526
I think we should focus
on the positive.

122
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:43,151
- Tonight was good.
- Yeah? You think so?

123
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:47,775
'Cause I was worried it was...
pathetic!

124
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:51,859
"Amazing Triumphs At A Nursing
Home!" That's great copy, Vic.

125
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,942
I'm a publicist, not a magician.

126
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:56,484
You want big news? You
must have big fights.

127
00:09:56,567 --> 00:10:00,400
A superhero needs a supervillain.
Thanks to you, we've got none left.

128
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:03,693
Then get the Death Man.

129
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,360
Death Man is dead.

130
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:08,068
- Father Doom.
- Life without parole.

131
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:11,443
Apocalypto's doing 50 years.
Armagezzmo's in exile.

132
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:14,068
- Baron Von Chaos got the chair.
- Really?

133
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:18,401
- Casanova is locked up in a nuthouse.
- Casanova Frankenstein.

134
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,525
Now, there was a supervillain.

135
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,400
You know, he just...

136
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,859
He's got those eyes, you know?

137
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,025
I can't do it, but...

138
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:31,567
That voice. Such pure evil.

139
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,234
The battles we used to have.
Extraordinary.

140
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,609
"Used to."

141
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:39,192
That's the problem, Captain.
"Used to."

142
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:15,484
Let the records show...

143
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:18,609
...that this parole hearing
has officially begun.

144
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:38,524
We now commence the 17th parole
hearing of Casanova Frankenstein.

145
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,191
Dr. Leek, you may begin.

146
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:45,024
Thank you.

147
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:49,441
Gentlemen of the board, the
man who sits before you...

148
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:53,774
...the once infamous evil
genius, is entirely cured.

149
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,608
- What?
- I give you my word...

150
00:11:56,691 --> 00:12:00,648
...that he's of no more
danger to the city than I am.

151
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:04,065
- This is outrageous.
- Yes.

152
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:07,023
Mr. Casanova Frankenstein...

153
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,065
...do you have anything to
say on your own behalf?

154
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,858
Blessed disciples
of Hippocrates...

155
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:20,816
...my heart is split in two.

156
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,441
It brims...

157
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:29,108
...with such sorrow for
my abominable crimes.

158
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,441
And yet...

159
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:33,523
...it swells with love...

160
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:35,273
...for you...

161
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:39,315
...for this sanctuary...

162
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:42,982
...this place of healing.

163
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:46,565
Within my soul, I feel
the choir singing...

164
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:50,440
...Beethoven's
immortal Ode to Joy...

165
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:54,232
...where all men...

166
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,023
...become brothers.

167
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:03,107
Am I too late to cast my vote?

168
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:08,522
Not at all, Lance. I was just
about to remind the board...

169
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:12,981
...that Casanova once had our
city in a stranglehold of terror.

170
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:17,397
Parole is not an option for
this man, this monster.

171
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:20,440
We cannot risk the
danger of releasing him.

172
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:23,523
- I could not agree with you more.
- Excellent.

173
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:29,232
However, I did just have dinner
with an old friend recently.

174
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,065
Maybe you've heard of him?
Captain Amazing.

175
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:37,773
- Captain Amazing?
- He asked if I would read this.

176
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:42,606
"Dear members of the board:

177
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:47,147
"We all know that society cannot
exist without absolute justice...

178
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:53,022
"...but society is also
built upon compassion.

179
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,772
"Let us set the tone for
the new millennium...

180
00:13:56,856 --> 00:13:59,356
"...by making a historic
gesture of forgiveness.

181
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,022
"Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you...

182
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:05,814
"...let us grant
Casanova Frankenstein...

183
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:08,814
"...a second chance."

184
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:16,188
With Captain Amazing's
recommendation and protection...

185
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,813
...I suppose we
could consider...

186
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,646
I pronounce you...

187
00:14:28,272 --> 00:14:29,314
...cured.

188
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:37,106
Hello, Champion City.

189
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:43,189
Daddy is home.

190
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:01,438
Hi, everybody.

191
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:04,355
Tooth decay and gingivitis
can be a crime.

192
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:07,063
That's why I use Mighty
Whitey toothpaste.

193
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:10,063
Because I want my teeth
to look amazing.

194
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:16,438
I'll bring this up again. It's $150 apiece.
We each chip in.

195
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:18,729
My cousin knows a guy
who knows a publicist.

196
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:22,770
What will we publicize? The fact
that we get our butts kicked a lot.

197
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:25,979
If you didn't smack me with a
shovel every time we went out...

198
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:27,895
...we'd have more
wins to brag about.

199
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:30,770
I'm sorry. I just tend to
lose my concentration...

200
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:33,480
...when I've got a salad
fork stuck in my rear end.

201
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:36,188
I get it. Your shovel in
his face is my fault.

202
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:38,563
You threw a spoon
at the guy, Jeff.

203
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,271
- What was up with that?
- I thought it was a fork.

204
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:44,021
You're the master of cutlery.

205
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:47,355
You can't throw a knife when
someone's trying to kill me?

206
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:49,979
- You can't use a rake?
- No, I'm the Shoveler.

207
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:52,812
I'm the Blue Raja.
I'm not Stab Man.

208
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:55,687
I'm not Knifey Boy.
I'm the Blue Raja.

209
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:57,562
- That's another thing.
- What?

210
00:15:57,645 --> 00:16:00,854
You could get a bit of blue
in the uniform somewhere.

211
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:03,895
You've got green. There's
a little flowery thing.

212
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:06,770
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

213
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:10,020
If we could stop being so
literal for just one moment.

214
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:12,270
Look what I'm doing.
Look at that.

215
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:14,854
I'm putting $150 on the table.
Who's in with me?

216
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:16,354
I don't have $150.

217
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:19,437
If I did, I wouldn't have
plundered my mother's silverware.

218
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,812
It's a waste of money.

219
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:23,644
You know who doesn't think
it's a waste of money?

220
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:25,978
Little Mr. Captain Amazing.

221
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,894
If we had a billionaire
benefactor like Lance Hunt...

222
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:32,603
- ...we could spend $150.
- Lance Hunt is Captain Amazing.

223
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:35,228
Don't start that again.

224
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:40,020
Lance Hunt wears glasses. Captain
Amazing doesn't wear glasses.

225
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:42,270
He takes them off
when he transforms.

226
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:45,729
That doesn't make any sense.
He wouldn't be able to see.

227
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:52,354
- Thanks for waiting.
- Thanks for dropping by.

228
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,604
Do you know what you want?

229
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:58,978
Allow me to begin, my dear. The Blue Raja
is quite partial to the salad nioise.

230
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:01,644
My dressing of choice
is Rancho Light...

231
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:04,644
...and I'd appreciate it if
you'd hold the Baco-Bits.

232
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:08,478
Since it's your first night, I
suppose I'll "fork-give" you...

233
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:10,728
...if you "fork-get."

234
00:17:11,686 --> 00:17:12,853
Who's next?

235
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:15,811
Can I get a meatball
sandwich on white with mayo?

236
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:18,936
I'll have a steak, very rare.
That means pink, not bloody.

237
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,478
And could I get some ice?

238
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:23,603
I had a little mishap defending
justice at the nursing home.

239
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:26,894
I thought I heard on TV that
that was Captain Amazing.

240
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:33,643
Let's all be good little automaton droids
and believe everything we hear on TV.

241
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:38,018
I'll just go place
your order now.

242
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,853
A trifle strident with that
crumpet, weren't we, Furious?

243
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:46,353
I am a ticking
time bomb of fury.

244
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:50,061
When we split the
check three ways...

245
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:53,019
...the steak-eater picks the
pocket of the salad man.

246
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:55,978
- Just give me the money, Jeff.
- Yes, fine.

247
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:59,603
- Every time we split it three ways.
- It's flipping robbery.

248
00:17:59,686 --> 00:18:01,768
Well, you should order more.

249
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:06,852
Do you see what I see?

250
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:10,435
It's Tony C.

251
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:13,977
And Tony P, leader
of the Disco Boys.

252
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,310
But why would he
be back in town?

253
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:31,810
Maybe it's time to do a
little following to find out.

254
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,768
No, it's already 10:30.

255
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:35,934
I'll get killed by
my wife as it is.

256
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:39,809
Yes, and I've had quite enough
excitement for one night, thank you.

257
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:43,726
My mistake. I thought I was hanging
out with serious superheroes:

258
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:45,684
The Shoveler and the Blue Raja.

259
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:49,434
But, apparently, I'm hanging
out with Lazy Boy and...

260
00:18:49,977 --> 00:18:51,768
- Good night, Roy.
- Yes, toodle-loo.

261
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:54,393
Hang on a second.
Lazy Boy and the...

262
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,727
And the Recliner!

263
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,102
Yeah, Lazy Boy and the Recliner!

264
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,352
Guys, are you coming?

265
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:09,976
Okay, fine. I guess tonight...

266
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:12,809
...the lone wolf...

267
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,351
...hunts alone.

268
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,267
Testicles rising.

269
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,601
Can't breathe. Can't breathe.

270
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:16,016
Butch needs his vest back.
He's got a game on Saturday.

271
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:20,808
Well, it's my vest too. I bought it for him.
The only thing I need...

272
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:22,891
Okay.

273
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:25,558
How long you gonna
do this, Eddie?

274
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,433
- It's been 12 years.
- I know.

275
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,391
You got a family to
look after, Eddie.

276
00:20:32,516 --> 00:20:35,016
The kids are worried
sick about you.

277
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:39,516
But still you go out, night after night,
running around the city. For what?

278
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:42,808
Lucille, God gave me a gift.

279
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:46,224
I shovel very well.

280
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:48,390
Baby.

281
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,432
You shovel better than
any man I've ever known.

282
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:55,640
But that does not
make you a superhero.

283
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:57,307
- All I...
- Oh, no.

284
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,557
You're a good husband.

285
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,308
And a good father.

286
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,391
But that's all. Nothing more.

287
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:12,225
You're right.

288
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,683
I believe in you, Daddy.

289
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:19,390
Roland, do not
encourage your father.

290
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:27,599
Well, if it isn't our old
friends, the Red Eyes.

291
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:32,432
Good evening. We weren't expecting
to see you again so spoon...

292
00:21:35,974 --> 00:21:39,182
Red Eyes, Red Eyes.
What a treat.

293
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:43,057
We weren't expecting to
see you again so spoon.

294
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:45,599
Jeffrey.

295
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:49,849
Mom, how many times have I asked
you not to barge in here?

296
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:52,264
- What's burning?
- Incense.

297
00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:55,223
I can't even count how many
rules you're breaking.

298
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:58,431
One: Always knock. Two: Don't
sniff around outside my door.

299
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:00,514
Three: Do not interrogate me.

300
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,306
- Jeffrey.
- What?

301
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,973
Are you into marijuana?

302
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:07,264
You're cheesing me off so bad.

303
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:09,182
Just, please... Good night.

304
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:11,682
I'm sorry. Jeffrey, please...

305
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,557
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

306
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:18,724
She's just so...

307
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,181
All right, let's see
what's shaking...

308
00:22:57,264 --> 00:22:59,930
...at the Chez Casa Casanova.

309
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,055
The old disco room.

310
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:01,097
Just as I left it.

311
00:24:01,305 --> 00:24:06,054
You've been locked up for 20 years. A
lot of things have changed since then.

312
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:11,304
It must have been hard for you, the
way times and styles have changed...

313
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:16,179
...to hear the people
saying that disco is dead.

314
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:19,472
Disco is not dead!
Disco is life!

315
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:22,763
Yes, Tony, that is the
passion I remember.

316
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:30,763
Stick with me, Tony, and
you will dance again...

317
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:34,513
...when I rule this town.

318
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,387
Have you met my psychiatrist?

319
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,596
Come out, come out
wherever you...

320
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:49,221
There we go.

321
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:51,929
We got a little terrace party.

322
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:55,221
I want you to spread the
word to all of my gangs.

323
00:24:56,012 --> 00:24:59,054
Tell them that Casanova
Frankenstein is back...

324
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:02,179
...and that Casanova is
planning something...

325
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:04,596
...a little bit different.

326
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:07,262
Kaboom.

327
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,428
Mama pajama!

328
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,845
What kind of crazy man
blows up a crazy house?

329
00:25:23,928 --> 00:25:27,262
And now, if you will excuse
me, I am expecting a visit...

330
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:29,262
...from a very old friend.

331
00:25:40,054 --> 00:25:43,428
Look what we got. A little booty
call from Captain Amazing.

332
00:25:47,303 --> 00:25:50,553
This is a fine, elegant
Harvey Wallbanger.

333
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,345
Even when it's sucked
by a scum like you?

334
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:59,511
Captain Amazing.
What a surprise.

335
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:03,303
Really? I'm not so
sure about that.

336
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:07,886
Your first night of freedom,
and you blow up the asylum.

337
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:11,178
Interesting choice. I
knew you couldn't change.

338
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:13,386
- I knew you'd know that.
- I know that.

339
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:16,260
And I knew you'd know
I'd know you knew.

340
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:20,385
But I didn't. I only knew
that you'd know that I knew.

341
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:23,469
Did you know that?

342
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:27,219
Of course.

343
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:30,094
- Please, won't you join me?
- With pleasure.

344
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:32,428
Quick thought.

345
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:35,261
Would you mind removing
the submicronic laser...

346
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,053
...in the ring on the index
finger of your left hand?

347
00:26:38,386 --> 00:26:39,470
Of course.

348
00:26:39,553 --> 00:26:42,678
If it wouldn't be too much
trouble, go ahead and disengage...

349
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:46,511
...the psychotropic bacterium
dart launchers in your slippers.

350
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:47,803
Done.

351
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:53,010
The cold fusion ultrasonic neuro-stunner
in your drink stirrer. Turn it off.

352
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:55,760
We know each other so
well, don't we, Lance?

353
00:26:56,885 --> 00:27:00,135
We've always been each other's
greatest "nemesises."

354
00:27:01,677 --> 00:27:02,969
Nemesis...

355
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:05,219
What's the plural on that?

356
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:07,469
Nemeses.

357
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:09,469
Whatever.

358
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:12,302
You're going to prison for
life this time, Casanova.

359
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:13,927
Here in Champion City...

360
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:16,552
...we still do a
fairly brisk trade...

361
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,969
...in justice.

362
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:23,093
I thought it was all about the publicity
and keeping your sponsors happy.

363
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:25,676
It's that kind of cynicism
that I truly feel...

364
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,009
...is starting to
poison society.

365
00:27:29,093 --> 00:27:30,176
Looky here.

366
00:27:30,926 --> 00:27:33,301
A multi-frequency
radio detonator.

367
00:27:33,676 --> 00:27:36,801
You should be careful when
discarding incriminating evidence.

368
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:39,802
Oh, no. This is an
amusing little gizmo.

369
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,927
It's really quite cool.

370
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,885
Yeah? What is it?

371
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:53,969
It's a chloroform-deploying
portable enticement snare.

372
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,593
Dang!

373
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:04,926
Lancie...

374
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,926
...you really are
so predictable.

375
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:24,218
- 'Morning, Sally.
- You're late!

376
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:28,300
Yes, I know. I was up all night,
defending the city from evil...

377
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:30,217
...but you don't
care about that.

378
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,633
Work starts at 9:00! It's 9:25!

379
00:28:33,717 --> 00:28:36,258
I guess all the junk's
probably ruined by now.

380
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:39,800
When are you gonna tear down
that jeep like I told you to?

381
00:28:39,883 --> 00:28:44,759
We went through this yesterday. That
jeep is an armored car of some type.

382
00:28:44,843 --> 00:28:47,884
It can withstand bombs. I can't
rip it apart with a crowbar.

383
00:28:47,968 --> 00:28:49,218
Just junk it.

384
00:28:49,843 --> 00:28:53,259
- If you gave me the proper tools, I could...
- Junk it!

385
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:57,176
I'm willing to have this
discussion with you...

386
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:01,258
...but I think we should deal with
it like two people who respect...

387
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,383
I want it junked.

388
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:05,550
Okay.

389
00:29:06,217 --> 00:29:08,758
Right now, I'm kind of
like a powder keg...

390
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:10,633
...and you're the match.

391
00:29:11,175 --> 00:29:13,592
If you tell me to junk
it one more time...

392
00:29:13,675 --> 00:29:15,133
Junk it now!

393
00:29:16,217 --> 00:29:17,925
You got that?

394
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:36,049
That little sucker
just saved your life.

395
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:40,132
Just junk it, you
miserable cuss.

396
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,508
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

397
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:08,757
Champion City's best-known billionaire,
Lance Hunt, has disappeared.

398
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,966
Police hope Captain Amazing will
help in the search for Hunt...

399
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:16,257
...but have, so far, failed to contact
the city's beloved superhero.

400
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:22,466
He makes a wonderful
trophy, don't you think?

401
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:27,257
I think we need to talk
about your plans here.

402
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:29,382
You know my plans, Lancie.

403
00:30:30,216 --> 00:30:31,966
Tomorrow night...

404
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:33,882
...I'm going to kill you.

405
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,716
That's the part that really
doesn't work for me.

406
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,173
When the clock strikes 12:00...

407
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:41,673
...cuckoo, cuckoo...

408
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,381
...you will be dead...

409
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:46,798
...and my city will be
given a new state of mind.

410
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:49,423
You must go with what
you're comfortable with...

411
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:52,256
...but, I just keep coming
back to this place.

412
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:55,799
I'm spitballing here,
but maybe we release...

413
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:58,466
...the Captain to
the authorities.

414
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:03,299
I say you're completely reformed. Wink.
There's rejoicing in the streets.

415
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:08,049
Then, at that point, you do the whole
destruction-of-the-city thing.

416
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,341
I mean, is it a perfect plan?

417
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:12,256
No.

418
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:15,256
And I think that's
what I like about it.

419
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:21,131
Okay, that's great. Turn
off the lights now.

420
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:24,340
It was just an idea! Wait,
I got a better one.

421
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,881
You let me live, I
am your sidekick.

422
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:30,298
I'm like Amazing Boy or...

423
00:31:30,465 --> 00:31:32,131
Casanova?

424
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:37,173
- Are you sure Captain Amazing is in there?
- Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

425
00:32:14,756 --> 00:32:16,381
Wait! Hear that?

426
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:19,380
We must have hit a trip wire.

427
00:32:19,464 --> 00:32:22,005
It could be a photon
eviscerator heating up.

428
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:25,464
It could be a cybernetic atom scrambler.
They target moving objects.

429
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:28,339
Sounds more like a heat-seeking
anthrax projection gun.

430
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:30,380
- Quickly, cover your mouth.
- Let's bolt!

431
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,630
- Don't move!
- Don't breathe!

432
00:32:31,714 --> 00:32:33,005
- Let's bolt!
- Don't move!

433
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,714
- Don't breathe!
- Let's bolt!

434
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,589
It's the sprinkler.

435
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,505
Isn't that just fabu?
I'm positively soaked.

436
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:52,671
What do we got here?

437
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:55,879
I think they're supposed
to be jive superheroes.

438
00:32:55,963 --> 00:32:59,296
They made a big mistake
coming to Casanova's place.

439
00:33:04,171 --> 00:33:07,880
- What's so funny?
- That's your power? You have guns?

440
00:33:08,172 --> 00:33:10,630
Couldn't you be a little
more creative than that?

441
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,755
Do forgive the impertinence...

442
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,589
...but what does a pistol
have to do with disco?

443
00:33:15,672 --> 00:33:17,297
- Weak.
- At best.

444
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,380
Check out the guy with the pipe.
Are you the disco plumber?

445
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,004
There's no theme at
all here, mates.

446
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:28,213
If you're gonna carry a
chain, make it a gold chain.

447
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:31,213
See what I'm saying? That's
just off the top of my head.

448
00:33:31,296 --> 00:33:32,879
What's up, Tiger Lily?

449
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:35,004
The top of your head?

450
00:33:41,713 --> 00:33:44,713
We'll never get in there. There
are too many Disco Boys.

451
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:47,629
Amazing's in there.
I saw him go in.

452
00:33:47,713 --> 00:33:49,796
There's never any evil
trios, are there?

453
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:53,588
No, they've all got to travel
in gangs like little babies.

454
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:57,753
- Maybe it's time to level the playing field.
- How?

455
00:33:59,962 --> 00:34:01,670
I'm talking about recruiting.

456
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:04,462
There are many guys who'd
kill to get in on our action.

457
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:07,837
- Plenty of poseurs, you mean.
- Yeah, maybe a few.

458
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:12,713
But there's got to be a couple of guys out
there, like Human Torch, before he hit.

459
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:16,838
Or like a guy who can shoot
stinging foam into your eyes.

460
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,754
Or something like that.

461
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:23,463
- Well, there's the Sphinx, of course.
- The what?

462
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:25,879
- The Sphinx.
- I know this guy.

463
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:29,379
Big crimefighter from down south.
Big-league hitter down there.

464
00:34:29,462 --> 00:34:32,587
- What's his power?
- He's terribly mysterious.

465
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,462
That's it? That's his power?
He's mysterious?

466
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:39,837
- Terribly mysterious.
- Plus, he can, like...

467
00:34:40,753 --> 00:34:43,087
...cut guns in half
with his mind.

468
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:46,212
Really? I hadn't heard that.

469
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,295
We'll track this Sphinx down.

470
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,837
Meantime, I have an idea where
we can get another guy.

471
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,795
I'm free for lunch tomorrow.
How about you?

472
00:34:56,045 --> 00:34:58,378
Nothing I couldn't move around.

473
00:35:10,127 --> 00:35:14,252
Listen, why don't you guys go on ahead?
I got to take care of something.

474
00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:16,419
Oh, I see.

475
00:35:27,045 --> 00:35:29,837
Good cause there, saving
homeless animals.

476
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:34,003
Hog queen?

477
00:35:35,627 --> 00:35:37,919
- What?
- You're into motorcycles.

478
00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:40,211
Not really.

479
00:35:42,169 --> 00:35:44,169
'Cause I got a motorcycle.

480
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:46,669
Yeah, what kind?

481
00:35:46,836 --> 00:35:48,794
- It's a Harley.
- A Harley?

482
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:54,002
Compatible. It's a Harley compatible.
Basically, the same engineering.

483
00:35:57,086 --> 00:35:59,544
I hope we're cool
about last night.

484
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:01,544
Last night?

485
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:04,961
Like I said, I was kind of
in scary mode back there.

486
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:09,793
Sometimes that comes off as a
little threatening or whatever.

487
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,835
I don't find you threatening...

488
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:14,668
You're very kind.

489
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:16,001
...at all.

490
00:36:18,335 --> 00:36:23,126
I still feel like I should make it
up to you somehow, just in some way.

491
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,669
I should take you out to dinner or
something to make up for being so scary...

492
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:29,336
I'm really busy.

493
00:36:34,336 --> 00:36:35,502
Right.

494
00:36:36,669 --> 00:36:38,961
Our little chess game continues.

495
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:42,835
Yeah?

496
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,501
We're looking for the one
they call "Invisible Boy."

497
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:52,251
All my life, I've been ignored by people.
Finally, after years of being overlooked...

498
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,626
...I found I have the
power to disappear.

499
00:36:56,293 --> 00:36:59,960
- It's real ironic how it happened 'cause...
- Can we come in?

500
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:02,710
- Yeah, sure. Come on.
- Thank you.

501
00:37:02,835 --> 00:37:06,043
Dad, I'm going to my room
with three strange men.

502
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:12,043
- And that's pretty much it.
- So, let me get this straight.

503
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:16,125
- You are capable of becoming invisible?
- Yes.

504
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,542
- But you can't give us a demonstration?
- No.

505
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,250
I can only become invisible
when no one's watching.

506
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:26,792
So, you're only
invisible to yourself?

507
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:30,751
No. If I look at myself,
I become visible again.

508
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:37,668
So, you can only become invisible when
absolutely nobody is watching you?

509
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,793
- Yes.
- Do forgive our incredulity...

510
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:47,875
...but I wonder how you can be certain
you've achieved transparency?

511
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,709
When you go invisible...

512
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:54,709
...you can feel it.

513
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:58,834
- I'm leaving.
- Thanks. It was nice to have met you.

514
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:01,959
Wait, guys. Don't go.
Where are you guys going?

515
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:03,459
Can I come?

516
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:07,000
Look, no offense, kid, but...

517
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:11,750
...we're going up against a really powerful
supervillain, Casanova Frankenstein.

518
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,750
That means we got to find a
lot of superheroes quickly.

519
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,167
We have no idea where
to even start...

520
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:19,459
I know tons of superheroes.

521
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:22,041
- I'm sure you know a lot...
- No, seriously.

522
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:25,541
I'm always at costume shops,
martial-arts stores...

523
00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:27,916
...talking to guys,
making connections.

524
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:30,874
If you want to break in,
you got to network...

525
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,999
...and I know how to network.

526
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:35,958
- Sorry, kid.
- Come on.

527
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:39,209
Haven't you guys
ever been a kid?

528
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:42,167
Haven't you guys
ever had a dream?

529
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,291
Let me see, who else have I met?
There's the Pincher.

530
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,999
The Pickier.

531
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,208
Princess Headbutt.

532
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,999
White Flight and the Black Menace.
They work together.

533
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,666
Slow down, slow down.

534
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:04,124
Then there's Professor
Pink Belly...

535
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,874
...and Lucky Pierre and
The French Tickler.

536
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,749
"French Tickler."

537
00:39:09,124 --> 00:39:12,374
- You've got all their telephone numbers?
- Yeah, most of them.

538
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:15,874
We've got to figure out a way
to get them all in one place.

539
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:19,041
- Some kind of a tryout.
- Yes, a tryout.

540
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:22,791
Throw in a barbecue and a few
kegs, they'll all show up.

541
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:24,999
The mooch factor is
high with this crowd.

542
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,332
A barbecue. That's a good idea.

543
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,332
What? Bugger all, it's the Spleen.
Play dead.

544
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:33,748
- Who's that?
- Turn your head. Don't say anything.

545
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,499
Hi, fellas.

546
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:53,958
Word on the street is you're
looking for superheroes.

547
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,333
- Not really.
- Actually, we're just leaving.

548
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,041
Rotten luck.

549
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:00,623
Here we go.

550
00:40:00,707 --> 00:40:03,290
- Perfect timing.
- That's for you.

551
00:40:04,123 --> 00:40:06,498
- Hamburger, right?
- Yes, thank you.

552
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:07,832
Enjoy.

553
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:11,748
Why are you guys always dissing me?
It hurts my feelings.

554
00:40:11,832 --> 00:40:14,248
I'm a superhero, too.
I have powers.

555
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:16,373
Really? Like what?

556
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,165
So glad you asked.

557
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,915
- Oh, no.
- Excuse me.

558
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:21,457
Excuse me.

559
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:27,665
It all started when I was
just 13 years of age.

560
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,248
One day, while walking
with friends...

561
00:40:30,332 --> 00:40:32,789
...I accidentally
cut the cheese.

562
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:35,497
In my adolescent awkwardness...

563
00:40:35,581 --> 00:40:39,164
...I blamed it on an old gypsy woman
who happened to be passing by.

564
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:40,997
Big mistake!

565
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,747
The gypsy woman placed
a curse upon my head.

566
00:40:44,872 --> 00:40:46,706
Because I'd smelt it...

567
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:51,290
...she decreed I would
forevermore be he who dealt it!

568
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:54,123
- Let me illustrate.
- No, you don't have to.

569
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:56,332
It's not necessary, really.

570
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,290
Let's see.

571
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,540
Distance:

572
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,998
Seven meters.

573
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:06,331
Air speed: normal.

574
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:09,456
Compensate for air conditioning.

575
00:41:11,247 --> 00:41:13,497
- Pull my fingers.
- Don't do it.

576
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:15,622
Oh, dear God.

577
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:19,081
S! B! D!

578
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:29,456
Silent, but deadly.

579
00:41:29,706 --> 00:41:32,164
- That's good shooting.
- That was amazing!

580
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,831
It's disgusting.
Don't encourage him.

581
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:39,038
You guys are recruiting
for superheroes.

582
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,830
Where are the tryouts?

583
00:41:41,955 --> 00:41:45,663
We don't know yet. Once
we do, we'll contact you.

584
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:50,746
Bet we'd get a big turnout if we did
it somewhere with a swimming pool.

585
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:53,080
Oh, no.

586
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:56,164
Absolutely not. Nope.

587
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:05,497
I don't deserve this.

588
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:06,789
I know.

589
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:11,913
- A lot of other men I could have married.
- I understand.

590
00:42:12,038 --> 00:42:15,913
If one person vomits in my
pool, I'll divorce you.

591
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:18,205
That's fair.

592
00:42:18,496 --> 00:42:19,955
Come on, kids!

593
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,121
State your name and power.

594
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:30,746
I am the Waffler.

595
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:33,996
With my griddle of justice, I
bash the enemy in the head...

596
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,121
...or I burn them like so.

597
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:38,538
Don't do that.

598
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:42,996
I also have my truth
syrup, which is low fat.

599
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:45,454
And I'm working on a theme song.

600
00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:48,245
"Waffle Man, I am the Waffler

601
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:50,954
"Golden, crispy, bad
guys are history"

602
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:55,454
And I'm running.
Just think about it.

603
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:57,954
Do you have a health plan?
Maybe dental? Eye?

604
00:42:58,037 --> 00:43:01,496
- Next.
- Hi. I am Pencilhead.

605
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,788
And I am Son of Pencilhead!

606
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,705
- We erase crime.
- Two generations of...

607
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:09,288
Yes, thank you.

608
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:12,205
- Did I do all right?
- Yes, I think they liked us.

609
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,912
I'm the Ballerina Man.

610
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:21,329
I don't need to see that.

611
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:31,995
Thanks.

612
00:43:32,412 --> 00:43:33,870
- I am...
- Hey!

613
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,245
- You copied me.
- You copied me.

614
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:37,662
- Did not!
- Liar!

615
00:43:37,787 --> 00:43:40,037
Ladies, now let's play nicely.

616
00:43:51,244 --> 00:43:54,119
I'd say there's potential...
there.

617
00:43:54,244 --> 00:43:57,911
I be the Bullfighter.
I fight the bull!

618
00:43:58,786 --> 00:44:01,578
Greetings, fellow crime fighters.
I am Radio Man.

619
00:44:02,578 --> 00:44:03,661
I am Squeegeeman.

620
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:05,661
- Do you sense its power?
- Yes.

621
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,454
P.M.S. Avenger. I work four days a month.
Is there a problem with that?

622
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:11,995
No.

623
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,245
- Whatever you say.
- We'll get back to you.

624
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:16,412
- Quite all right.
- Whatever.

625
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,204
Okay, that's it.

626
00:44:29,411 --> 00:44:31,786
That was a complete
waste of time.

627
00:44:31,911 --> 00:44:33,953
Like so many things we do.

628
00:44:36,036 --> 00:44:39,536
Hi. Am I too late to try out?

629
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:42,453
- What time is it?
- I don't have a watch on.

630
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:45,828
Sorry. You'll have to pretend to
be a superhero somewhere else.

631
00:44:45,953 --> 00:44:47,703
Really? I see.

632
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:50,411
That's fine.

633
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,661
Look out!

634
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,285
I guess I'll just have to
take my ball and go home.

635
00:45:30,368 --> 00:45:32,618
- You can't go.
- Please.

636
00:45:32,702 --> 00:45:34,827
- Where you going?
- That was cool.

637
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,202
- One second.
- Stop her.

638
00:45:36,285 --> 00:45:37,452
- Hold on.
- Stop her.

639
00:45:37,577 --> 00:45:38,577
Settle down.

640
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,952
That was great.

641
00:45:40,035 --> 00:45:42,410
We could squeeze in
one more interview.

642
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:45,118
Yes, seeing how you schlepped
your ball all this way.

643
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:47,868
- Appreciate that. Thanks.
- You're really good.

644
00:45:47,993 --> 00:45:50,035
What's up? I'm the Spleen.

645
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,868
I'm the Bowler.
How're you doing?

646
00:45:53,077 --> 00:45:54,618
You're very attractive.

647
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,035
Why don't you...

648
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:00,992
...tell us about yourself.

649
00:46:01,117 --> 00:46:03,201
Help us understand why
we should choose you...

650
00:46:03,284 --> 00:46:05,451
...over all the other
qualified applicants.

651
00:46:05,534 --> 00:46:08,451
- What other qualified applicants?
- Eddie, please.

652
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:12,284
Start at the top. Where
did you get your powers?

653
00:46:13,492 --> 00:46:15,951
I got my powers from my father.

654
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,034
Who's he?

655
00:46:17,117 --> 00:46:19,327
Have you ever heard of
Carmine the Bowler?

656
00:46:19,452 --> 00:46:21,202
Have we ever heard...

657
00:46:21,493 --> 00:46:24,535
Blimey, don't tell us you're
the Bowler's daughter.

658
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:27,993
I remember there being a little
controversy around his death.

659
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,868
The police said it
was an accident.

660
00:46:29,952 --> 00:46:33,077
He came home late one night and
fell down an elevator shaft...

661
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,784
...onto some bullets.

662
00:46:35,117 --> 00:46:37,701
I've always suspected
a bit of foul play.

663
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:39,076
As have I.

664
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:41,742
Daddy's little girl
is all grown up...

665
00:46:41,826 --> 00:46:43,951
...looking for a little revenge?

666
00:46:44,242 --> 00:46:46,909
Yeah, that is it. Is there
a problem with that?

667
00:46:47,326 --> 00:46:49,284
- Why don't you tell me?
- You tell me.

668
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:52,034
- Why don't you tell me?
- Why don't you tell me?

669
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:55,784
- Why don't you tell me?
- Why don't you tell me?

670
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:01,576
All right, you've
seen what I can do.

671
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:03,617
You want to use my
talents or not?

672
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:06,117
If you don't, I
seek another cabal.

673
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:09,325
- We definitely need you.
- Indeed.

674
00:47:09,908 --> 00:47:11,491
Bowler. Evelyn.

675
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:13,241
- Carol.
- Carol.

676
00:47:13,825 --> 00:47:16,491
Will you join our
little ragtag trio?

677
00:47:17,075 --> 00:47:18,616
I think you mean quartet...

678
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,825
What are you talking about?
There's five of us.

679
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:25,992
Nobody's green lit any new
memberships, so just chill out.

680
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:29,701
You've got a good arm.
I'll give you that.

681
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:32,409
- But we are the lead cadre...
- Cadre.

682
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:34,534
- You're in.
- Welcome aboard.

683
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:37,784
- Guys, what are...
- What? What's the problem?

684
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:39,825
Welcome.

685
00:47:40,616 --> 00:47:43,825
- What?
- Nothing. No problem. Welcome aboard.

686
00:47:53,408 --> 00:47:55,366
Are Spleen and I on
the team or not?

687
00:47:55,491 --> 00:47:57,991
In my opinion, which used
to matter around here...

688
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,158
...we shouldn't be
flinging memberships...

689
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:03,116
...at every guy who puts together
matching gloves and boots.

690
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,783
Just be sure to jump in
when the action starts.

691
00:48:05,866 --> 00:48:08,783
- You do your share, we'll keep you around.
- Maybe.

692
00:48:08,991 --> 00:48:11,658
You're a British man who
converted to Islam?

693
00:48:11,991 --> 00:48:17,490
No. Until the early part of this century,
India was part of the British Empire...

694
00:48:17,615 --> 00:48:20,407
...whose government there was
called the British Raj...

695
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,824
...after the Hindi word
for "sovereignty."

696
00:48:22,907 --> 00:48:25,532
- Furthermore...
- Wait. I'm sorry. What?

697
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,324
Dad...

698
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:29,950
No, he's not a
commie nor a fruit.

699
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,783
Sorry.

700
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,783
His ignorance embarrasses me.

701
00:48:36,491 --> 00:48:39,575
Am I to understand you've
inserted your father's skull...

702
00:48:39,658 --> 00:48:41,741
...inside of that
ball for bowling?

703
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:44,283
No. The guy at the
pro shop did it.

704
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,032
That was Casanova's limo.

705
00:48:49,115 --> 00:48:52,449
You bet your sweet bippy it was.
Let's turn this sucker around!

706
00:48:52,574 --> 00:48:54,865
He's probably got
Amazing in there.

707
00:48:59,324 --> 00:49:01,824
- Here we go.
- I feel car sick.

708
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,740
Great.

709
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:08,449
So tell me, who can we count on
seeing at my banquet tomorrow?

710
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:10,824
All the top gangs
will be there, Cas.

711
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,490
They want to know what
you got up your sleeve.

712
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:17,740
Mr. Casanova...

713
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:21,489
...I think we're being followed.

714
00:49:37,115 --> 00:49:38,740
Let us say hello.

715
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:49,865
- What's he doing?
- He's either very smart or very dumb.

716
00:50:06,406 --> 00:50:07,573
Hello.

717
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:10,781
I would like a double
burger with large fries.

718
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:13,531
Do you boys want
something to drink?

719
00:50:15,198 --> 00:50:18,073
We think you did something
bad to Captain Amazing.

720
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:20,031
We'd like you to
tell us where he is.

721
00:50:20,156 --> 00:50:23,656
Captain who? This name does
not ring any bells with me.

722
00:50:23,739 --> 00:50:26,072
I don't like your
tone, Frankenpuss.

723
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:28,905
Do yourself a favor and
don't punch my clock.

724
00:50:28,988 --> 00:50:31,405
I'm a Pantera's box you
do not want to open.

725
00:50:31,488 --> 00:50:32,988
It is Pandora.

726
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:36,697
Please don't correct me.
It sickens me.

727
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,988
You guys never learn, do you?

728
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:41,613
Apparently we don't, ass.

729
00:50:43,114 --> 00:50:45,406
- I know you.
- You don't know me.

730
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:47,656
- You knew my father.
- Sal.

731
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:48,989
Carmine.

732
00:50:49,364 --> 00:50:52,114
Carmine? The Bowler?

733
00:50:52,531 --> 00:50:54,531
- Yep.
- You're Baby Bowler?

734
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:56,948
- Is that a problem?
- Hello.

735
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:00,905
I'm the guy that gave
your daddy the shaft.

736
00:51:01,447 --> 00:51:06,155
This is the last time I'm going to
ask you: Where is Captain Amazing?

737
00:51:06,238 --> 00:51:09,072
And a Diet Pepsi with
a little bit of ice.

738
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,238
Hey, Shov!

739
00:51:23,197 --> 00:51:24,738
Boys, let's go.

740
00:51:27,113 --> 00:51:28,613
Fork yourself!

741
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:35,654
Pull!

742
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:57,738
- Come on, Roy, let's get out of here.
- Come on, Furious! Let's go!

743
00:51:58,655 --> 00:52:03,155
People who live in glass houses,
shouldn't, because this is what happens!

744
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:07,446
Come on! That's enough! Come on.
Get out of the way.

745
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:11,737
"The roof is on fire! The roof!

746
00:52:11,821 --> 00:52:14,279
"The roof! The roof is on fire!

747
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:16,946
"We don't need no water!"

748
00:52:19,862 --> 00:52:21,529
Here comes Daddy.

749
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:36,071
Go, go!

750
00:52:55,904 --> 00:52:59,904
I would like to make a toast to
our first straight-out victory.

751
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:04,696
The relationship you have with your mother
affects every dynamic in your life.

752
00:53:04,779 --> 00:53:07,154
- It's true, quite true.
- What? What?

753
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:11,695
Yes, I know a father's role is
vital in a child's life as well.

754
00:53:11,778 --> 00:53:13,695
No, I'm not disrespecting you.

755
00:53:13,778 --> 00:53:18,153
You have to allow me to have
conversations in a bar...

756
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,111
...and talk to my new friends.

757
00:53:20,195 --> 00:53:22,236
Anyway, I'm an adult now.

758
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:25,111
Do you want to go
back in the bag?

759
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:28,528
Is that how we're gonna do it now?
You make the rules.

760
00:53:28,611 --> 00:53:30,445
If you don't zip it...

761
00:53:36,653 --> 00:53:40,986
I was going to say that parents
can be quite problematic.

762
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:42,777
Tell me about it.

763
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:50,735
There's not enough beer in the world.
I'm sorry.

764
00:53:51,235 --> 00:53:53,444
"I'm sorry."

765
00:53:53,652 --> 00:53:55,569
You've got to live in truth.

766
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:57,652
The woman's a tiger.

767
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:05,861
Barkeep, another round...

768
00:54:05,945 --> 00:54:08,778
...for my sweet team
of superfriends.

769
00:54:10,111 --> 00:54:13,236
Barkeep, another round
for the super...

770
00:54:14,236 --> 00:54:16,027
...super-bellies.

771
00:54:17,444 --> 00:54:19,444
That's what's so cool
about this team.

772
00:54:19,527 --> 00:54:23,610
Everyone has their own powers for
all these different situations.

773
00:54:23,735 --> 00:54:25,277
Pull my finger.

774
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,860
- What?
- I was just thinking.

775
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:38,319
I was wondering when we
might see your superpower.

776
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,360
It'll happen, kid. Don't worry.

777
00:54:46,569 --> 00:54:48,359
- I say, "sabotage."
- "Sabotage"?

778
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:51,234
The Shoveler is hammered!

779
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,401
The Shoveler is hammered!

780
00:55:01,984 --> 00:55:03,609
What's the name of this team?

781
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:05,151
How about the Super Squad?

782
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:08,277
How about the Six Dead Guys
in Their Stupid Costumes?

783
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:11,902
No. The Magnificent Dead Guys.
How about that?

784
00:55:11,985 --> 00:55:14,194
What about the Legendary
Super Freaks?

785
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:17,027
Way too positive.
They totaled our car.

786
00:55:26,651 --> 00:55:28,651
- Ready?
- Ready!

787
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:32,318
- Aim.
- Aim!

788
00:55:34,359 --> 00:55:35,484
I love you!

789
00:55:36,568 --> 00:55:37,568
Fire!

790
00:55:45,526 --> 00:55:49,818
Six Very Nearly Dead Guys Who
Had A Temporary Reprieve.

791
00:55:49,901 --> 00:55:52,859
- That's it. That's your name.
- Six Jive Turkeys.

792
00:55:52,943 --> 00:55:55,358
- Dig, man?
- Yeah! Dig, man!

793
00:55:55,442 --> 00:55:59,442
That's your name. Kill
you later, Superlosers!

794
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,983
Criminy. You're the Sphinx.

795
00:56:08,483 --> 00:56:10,150
And you are fools.

796
00:56:10,942 --> 00:56:12,234
Tonight...

797
00:56:12,693 --> 00:56:14,193
...you proved...

798
00:56:15,193 --> 00:56:16,818
...your inexperience.

799
00:56:17,526 --> 00:56:20,818
The wise man knows
that he is weakest...

800
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:23,693
...when he thinks
himself strong.

801
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:27,567
Mysterious.

802
00:56:27,692 --> 00:56:29,358
Terribly mysterious.

803
00:56:29,442 --> 00:56:31,400
Casanova Frankenstein...

804
00:56:31,567 --> 00:56:33,442
...is no ordinary villain.

805
00:56:33,692 --> 00:56:35,150
To fight him...

806
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,775
...you must have
extraordinary skill.

807
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:42,025
Thank you for that little
piece of information.

808
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,692
- I wouldn't have thought...
- Excuse me!

809
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,233
- Do you have any manners?
- I don't know. Do I?

810
00:56:47,317 --> 00:56:48,900
- I don't know. Do you?
- Do I?

811
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:51,733
- Why don't you tell me?
- Why don't you tell me?

812
00:56:51,817 --> 00:56:53,567
- I don't know.
- Do I mind what?

813
00:56:53,692 --> 00:56:54,983
Silence!

814
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:58,067
We'll have to separate you two.

815
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,857
Is that what you want? You
want to be separated?

816
00:57:01,149 --> 00:57:02,607
He started it.

817
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:07,149
You must be like
the wolf pack...

818
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,899
...not like the six-pack.

819
00:57:11,316 --> 00:57:12,774
Teamwork. Yes!

820
00:57:13,149 --> 00:57:16,566
You are not ready to
face so great an enemy.

821
00:57:17,483 --> 00:57:21,150
Not until you have vanquished
the enemy within yourselves.

822
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:23,233
Yes!

823
00:57:23,692 --> 00:57:25,275
It's cool, isn't it?

824
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,525
It goes right up to the point
of being, like... confusing.

825
00:57:30,192 --> 00:57:33,649
It's leadership. It's
what we've been missing.

826
00:57:34,274 --> 00:57:35,982
Yes, I quite agree.

827
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:40,316
Sphinx, will you guide our motley
little gang of men-at-arms?

828
00:57:41,982 --> 00:57:43,107
Wait a minute.

829
00:57:43,191 --> 00:57:45,191
Are you serious? Come on.

830
00:57:45,482 --> 00:57:47,441
Will you shape us, mold us?

831
00:57:47,524 --> 00:57:49,941
Please unify us and
make us whole.

832
00:57:50,524 --> 00:57:52,399
To learn my teachings...

833
00:57:53,024 --> 00:57:55,399
...I must first teach you...

834
00:57:56,357 --> 00:57:57,857
...how to learn.

835
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:11,856
Learn to hide your strikes
from your opponent...

836
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:14,690
...and you'll more
easily strike his hide.

837
00:58:24,232 --> 00:58:27,524
- How many weapons do you wield?
- Just one, Sphinx.

838
00:58:27,691 --> 00:58:30,941
No. The fist, the knee,
the elbow, the head!

839
00:58:31,232 --> 00:58:35,024
You must lash out with every limb,
like the octopus who plays the drums.

840
00:58:40,523 --> 00:58:42,315
Why am I doing this again?

841
00:58:42,398 --> 00:58:44,856
When you can balance a tack
hammer on your head...

842
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,106
...you will head off your
foes with a balanced attack.

843
00:58:48,898 --> 00:58:52,065
And why am I wearing the
watermelon on my feet?

844
00:58:59,398 --> 00:59:02,148
I don't remember telling
you to do that.

845
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,940
Wait a minute. Wait.

846
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:28,022
I believe in my powers.

847
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,606
"I believe in my powers."

848
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:34,231
I believe in the powers
of my teammates.

849
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:37,315
"I believe in the powers
of my teammates."

850
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,023
I trust in my powers.

851
00:59:40,356 --> 00:59:42,315
"I trust in my powers."

852
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,105
I trust in the powers
of my teammates.

853
00:59:45,522 --> 00:59:48,355
"I trust in the powers
of my teammates."

854
00:59:50,855 --> 00:59:53,564
This team must learn
to work together...

855
00:59:53,647 --> 00:59:55,814
...or mark my words...

856
00:59:55,897 --> 00:59:57,855
...it will be torn apart!

857
00:59:59,564 --> 01:00:00,689
Now...

858
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,855
...gather round.

859
01:00:03,147 --> 01:00:05,564
Gather round. Embrace
one another.

860
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,647
Gather round. Embrace
one another quickly.

861
01:00:14,022 --> 01:00:16,480
Why do you stand aside
while the others practice?

862
01:00:16,564 --> 01:00:17,979
"Practice"?

863
01:00:18,563 --> 01:00:20,938
That's not practicing.
That's group hugging.

864
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:23,646
We should be busting in
on Casanova right now.

865
01:00:23,979 --> 01:00:28,146
He who questions training, only
trains himself at asking questions.

866
01:00:30,604 --> 01:00:31,729
What?

867
01:00:37,855 --> 01:00:41,147
- Who was looking for the pinking shears?
- That was me.

868
01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:42,480
Yes...

869
01:00:42,814 --> 01:00:45,605
...work well on
your new costumes.

870
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:49,480
For when you care for
what is outside...

871
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,521
...what is inside cares for you.

872
01:00:53,188 --> 01:00:54,729
The clock is ticking here.

873
01:00:54,813 --> 01:00:58,354
Are we gonna sew dresses all day
or are we gonna rescue Amazing?

874
01:00:58,438 --> 01:01:01,229
- I need a thimble. Does anybody...
- Patience, my son.

875
01:01:01,396 --> 01:01:03,771
To summon your power for
the coming conflict...

876
01:01:03,854 --> 01:01:07,063
...you must first have power
over that which conflicts you.

877
01:01:07,146 --> 01:01:10,896
Am I the only one who finds these
sayings just a little formulaic?

878
01:01:10,979 --> 01:01:13,604
"If you wanna push it down,
you have to pull it up."

879
01:01:13,688 --> 01:01:15,729
"if you want to go left,
you must go right."

880
01:01:15,813 --> 01:01:20,271
Your temper is very quick, but until
you learn to master your rage...

881
01:01:20,479 --> 01:01:22,979
Your rage will
become your master?

882
01:01:23,978 --> 01:01:25,937
That's what you were
gonna say, right?

883
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,187
- Right?
- Not necessarily.

884
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:31,437
That's it. I'm out of here.

885
01:01:31,728 --> 01:01:35,228
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Mysterioso,
but it's time to get busy.

886
01:01:35,312 --> 01:01:37,437
- Come on, Eddie. Let's go.
- No, Roy.

887
01:01:37,562 --> 01:01:40,770
- He's getting results.
- The result is we're all out of here.

888
01:01:40,853 --> 01:01:43,563
Come on, Jeff. Let's
peel some lilies.

889
01:01:44,896 --> 01:01:47,146
I don't want to
leave the Sphinx.

890
01:01:47,229 --> 01:01:49,063
How about the rest of you?

891
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:53,604
Do you want to play Suzie Homemaker,
or do you want to be superheroes?

892
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,645
Okay, I don't need a compass to
tell me which way the wind shines.

893
01:02:06,395 --> 01:02:09,937
- Let's talk about this.
- No, let's not talk about it!

894
01:02:10,062 --> 01:02:12,645
Do you want to sit here
making Halloween outfits...

895
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:15,478
...or do you want to
take care of business?

896
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:21,145
Well, I guess from now on I
ride in a wolf pack of one.

897
01:02:29,977 --> 01:02:31,727
- We should go after him.
- He's okay.

898
01:02:31,811 --> 01:02:35,561
- Just let him go. He's a baby.
- We've never gone into battle without him.

899
01:02:35,644 --> 01:02:37,436
If you love him,
why not marry him?

900
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:40,602
- Why don't you marry him?
- Why don't you?

901
01:02:40,977 --> 01:02:42,352
Bowler, Shoveler, please!

902
01:02:42,977 --> 01:02:47,562
Sphinx, what wisdom can you give
us in our most clouded hour?

903
01:02:47,895 --> 01:02:49,645
Yeah, what do we do?

904
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:55,645
The loss of manpower can be replaced
by the addition of firepower.

905
01:02:58,312 --> 01:03:01,270
Well, I won't use guns.
I've been clear about that.

906
01:03:01,353 --> 01:03:02,769
He won't even use a knife.

907
01:03:02,852 --> 01:03:05,436
You're not going to start
with that meshugas again?

908
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:07,602
Casanova will have many weapons.

909
01:03:07,852 --> 01:03:11,977
To beat him, you will have to have
more than forks and flatulence.

910
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:18,019
Heller.

911
01:03:25,644 --> 01:03:29,144
"Dr. A. Heller.
Weapons designer...

912
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:32,269
"...innovator, inventor,
world changer."

913
01:03:53,852 --> 01:03:56,227
Why does he live in a
deserted amusement park?

914
01:03:56,352 --> 01:03:58,477
Because he's an
eccentric genius.

915
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:01,769
I'll take point. You two flank.
Let's triangulate.

916
01:04:01,894 --> 01:04:04,436
- Equilateral or isosceles?
- Just go.

917
01:04:20,893 --> 01:04:23,310
Who would want to
rent a chicken?

918
01:04:25,268 --> 01:04:28,226
It's weird in here.
It's scary and weird.

919
01:04:40,018 --> 01:04:41,642
There's another chicken.

920
01:04:41,725 --> 01:04:43,517
Crazy chicken world.

921
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:56,642
Dr. Heller?

922
01:04:58,517 --> 01:05:00,143
We come in peace.

923
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:02,976
Shovel Head?

924
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,726
The Shoveler. We met at
the old folks' home.

925
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,185
Of course.

926
01:05:08,143 --> 01:05:09,393
Fork Man?

927
01:05:09,476 --> 01:05:12,601
No, I'm the Spleen. To see
my power, pull my finger.

928
01:05:12,685 --> 01:05:14,725
- Please, don't!
- No, sir, don't!

929
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:18,517
Dr. Heller, we're on a mission.
We've come for weapons.

930
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:22,017
Shouldn't we see a diploma
or something first?

931
01:05:22,142 --> 01:05:25,934
You came to the right place, baby.
Step into my office.

932
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:31,934
Where are your friends?

933
01:05:33,434 --> 01:05:34,892
What friends?

934
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,642
Your friends.

935
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:39,559
I thought you guys were
in a club or something.

936
01:05:39,725 --> 01:05:42,850
- You mean a team? A Superteam?
- Yeah.

937
01:05:43,434 --> 01:05:47,766
Apparently, it's now the Super
Sphinx Team or something.

938
01:05:48,266 --> 01:05:50,891
- You had a falling out?
- Yeah, kind of.

939
01:05:54,141 --> 01:05:56,058
Is it okay if I just
have the coffee?

940
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:58,266
- I'm not very hungry.
- Sure.

941
01:06:04,683 --> 01:06:06,892
What time do you get off work?

942
01:06:07,225 --> 01:06:08,892
Half hour.

943
01:06:09,892 --> 01:06:11,017
Why?

944
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:14,517
No reason. I was just
thinking maybe I could...

945
01:06:14,684 --> 01:06:17,059
It might be a good idea
if I walked you home.

946
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:19,641
The city's been real,
real dangerous...

947
01:06:19,724 --> 01:06:21,891
...since Amazing went M.I.A.

948
01:06:25,224 --> 01:06:28,266
I've been working on some
jujitsu moves that...

949
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:31,474
It'd probably be safer on
everybody's part if...

950
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,933
Also, it would be
great to just...

951
01:06:35,433 --> 01:06:36,974
...walk you home.

952
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:40,016
Sure.

953
01:06:44,891 --> 01:06:48,558
This will even things up a little bit.
What is it?

954
01:06:49,266 --> 01:06:52,307
- Look at this!
- Don't point at me.

955
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,265
You're gonna kill somebody.

956
01:06:55,973 --> 01:06:58,515
Listen, everything
here is non-lethal.

957
01:07:00,265 --> 01:07:01,932
"Non-lethal"? What?

958
01:07:02,723 --> 01:07:04,848
I don't make anything
that's deadly.

959
01:07:04,932 --> 01:07:07,723
I see. How delightfully
eccentric...

960
01:07:08,265 --> 01:07:10,723
...while simultaneously
being a waste of our time.

961
01:07:10,808 --> 01:07:12,808
- No offense. Shall we?
- Thank you, Doctor.

962
01:07:12,891 --> 01:07:15,058
- I said good day.
- See you, Doc.

963
01:07:15,183 --> 01:07:18,808
That is why, in general, a mad
scientist is less desirable...

964
01:07:18,891 --> 01:07:21,224
...than a garden-variety
scientist.

965
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:25,723
Incoming!

966
01:07:30,723 --> 01:07:32,432
- Look out!
- Watch out!

967
01:07:55,682 --> 01:07:57,473
Doc, you're a genius.

968
01:07:58,264 --> 01:08:00,097
A canned tornado?

969
01:08:00,347 --> 01:08:03,306
Totally non-lethal, but
totally effective.

970
01:08:03,389 --> 01:08:05,556
What is this thing you
were handling before?

971
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:06,889
That's a shrinker.

972
01:08:06,972 --> 01:08:08,389
How do you know?

973
01:08:08,472 --> 01:08:09,806
A manual. Cool.

974
01:08:10,306 --> 01:08:13,847
That's a high-temperature,
fabric-adhesive, liquid projector...

975
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:16,682
...based on simple
dry-cleaning technology.

976
01:08:18,015 --> 01:08:19,932
You aim that at a guy...

977
01:08:21,557 --> 01:08:24,640
...his clothes get so tight
he can't even breathe.

978
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,807
I can trick that out
with a holster.

979
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:31,015
It comes with a leather carrying case.
It's got a wad cutter and a full warranty.

980
01:08:31,097 --> 01:08:32,264
Nicely done.

981
01:08:32,347 --> 01:08:35,639
- What do you call this?
- Careful, careful. That's a blame-thrower.

982
01:08:35,722 --> 01:08:38,389
- "A blame-thrower"?
- I'm sorry.

983
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,514
Your bad attitude is
hurting this team!

984
01:08:40,597 --> 01:08:44,722
- Stop spitting! I already took a shower!
- You need another one, 'cause you stink!

985
01:08:44,806 --> 01:08:47,681
- Want me to pop that zit for you?
- I'm really shaking!

986
01:08:47,764 --> 01:08:50,889
- You're always spraying!
- I'm sorry if I spit all the time!

987
01:08:53,639 --> 01:08:55,514
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

988
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:56,847
No, no.

989
01:09:00,181 --> 01:09:04,138
- Doctor, you are a genius.
- That's what the card says.

990
01:09:06,013 --> 01:09:09,263
I still want to be with them
when they go rescue Amazing.

991
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:11,305
So why don't you just go back?

992
01:09:11,388 --> 01:09:13,638
No, I just left this morning.
That would be...

993
01:09:13,763 --> 01:09:16,346
- This is my place.
- That would be ridiculous.

994
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:21,055
They're your friends. They'll understand.
It's clearly what you want to do.

995
01:09:21,388 --> 01:09:23,306
That actually could work.

996
01:09:23,722 --> 01:09:27,514
I'm Mr. Furious, right? I'm unpredictable.
I'm a loose cannon.

997
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:30,472
I go storming off. Why can't
I come storming back?

998
01:09:30,556 --> 01:09:34,097
- I mean, it's all in how you play it, right?
- Or don't play it.

999
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:38,513
Just go back, say you're sorry and
help them save Captain Amazing.

1000
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:42,263
You think there's a really angry
way I could say I'm sorry?

1001
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:43,930
'Cause that's kind of my...

1002
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,555
I gotta stick with the anger
thing 'cause people like that.

1003
01:09:51,555 --> 01:09:54,305
Maybe people like you
for who you really are.

1004
01:09:54,846 --> 01:09:55,888
You know?

1005
01:09:58,138 --> 01:09:59,888
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1006
01:10:05,721 --> 01:10:08,013
You should go find your friends.

1007
01:10:20,595 --> 01:10:21,595
Good.

1008
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,512
Now, the three of you will
be like the eagle's claw.

1009
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:29,013
You will snatch up the hostage
and carry him to safety.

1010
01:10:29,096 --> 01:10:33,471
We three scouts are like the eagle's
eye: ever watchful for danger.

1011
01:10:35,388 --> 01:10:37,513
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1012
01:10:37,596 --> 01:10:41,638
Then let operation Three-Eyed,
Three-Legged Eagle begin.

1013
01:10:47,012 --> 01:10:47,970
Shotgun!

1014
01:10:48,054 --> 01:10:49,970
I think not, my friend.

1015
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:59,845
Silly twit.

1016
01:11:01,304 --> 01:11:02,970
Give me a second.

1017
01:11:07,595 --> 01:11:09,220
- Hey.
- What's up?

1018
01:11:09,887 --> 01:11:12,095
Not a lot. What's up with you?

1019
01:11:12,554 --> 01:11:14,054
Nothing much.

1020
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:20,136
- Have you seen my address book?
- No. What did it look like?

1021
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:25,511
It's denim. It says "Hang loose"
on it with a picture of a kitten.

1022
01:11:26,844 --> 01:11:27,886
No.

1023
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:33,261
You should probably think
about where you saw it last.

1024
01:11:33,344 --> 01:11:34,470
Right.

1025
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,970
I should probably...

1026
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:51,094
Eddie, there's something
I want to say.

1027
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:54,844
I'm angry about being left
out of this mission...

1028
01:11:54,969 --> 01:11:58,178
...and about what's happening
with this team, but I'm...

1029
01:12:02,844 --> 01:12:04,011
Oh, boy.

1030
01:12:07,178 --> 01:12:08,928
Temperature rising.

1031
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:11,886
Vision blurring.

1032
01:12:12,886 --> 01:12:15,219
Rage taking over.

1033
01:12:15,678 --> 01:12:17,844
I got an idea. Why don't
you come with us?

1034
01:12:17,928 --> 01:12:19,136
Okay.

1035
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:20,969
Rage subsiding.

1036
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:24,260
Pulse slowing.

1037
01:12:25,843 --> 01:12:27,343
Anger fading.

1038
01:12:31,218 --> 01:12:33,635
That was quick thinking, Eddie.

1039
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:38,718
Well, I wouldn't want
anyone to get hurt.

1040
01:13:07,677 --> 01:13:09,635
Drink, drink!

1041
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,510
Right, then. I'll go and
scout out a way in.

1042
01:13:18,593 --> 01:13:21,510
- What should the signal be?
- "Caree, caroo."

1043
01:13:21,635 --> 01:13:23,760
No, no, what about:
"whippoorwill"?

1044
01:13:23,843 --> 01:13:26,677
- No, "Caree, caroo."
- Yes, but isn't that better?

1045
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:29,801
- Not interested.
- Enough with the cuckoo!

1046
01:13:30,009 --> 01:13:32,592
- We must find an open window.
- That's what I said.

1047
01:13:32,676 --> 01:13:33,801
Go, go!

1048
01:13:40,342 --> 01:13:42,092
Does everyone have a drink?

1049
01:13:42,676 --> 01:13:45,092
- Yes, we all do!
- You're all good?

1050
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:48,718
Good. Well, it is
wonderful in my heart...

1051
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:53,052
...to see so many familiar
faces once again.

1052
01:13:53,427 --> 01:13:56,177
The Susies: assassins
from the East.

1053
01:13:58,802 --> 01:14:02,592
The Suits: downsizing all
those who dare oppose them.

1054
01:14:02,967 --> 01:14:06,342
The Furriers: always
dressed to kill.

1055
01:14:11,301 --> 01:14:15,884
The Frat Boys: still on
probation for lethal hazing.

1056
01:14:16,551 --> 01:14:17,551
Phi Zeta!

1057
01:14:17,717 --> 01:14:21,009
Of course, the Not So Goody Mob:

1058
01:14:22,009 --> 01:14:24,259
Putting the rhyme into crime!

1059
01:14:24,342 --> 01:14:26,301
The pleasure's all
mine, Frankenstein.

1060
01:14:26,384 --> 01:14:29,551
We're about to perpetrate some
evil on the Champion City people.

1061
01:14:29,634 --> 01:14:31,426
Rappin', snappin', cappin'.

1062
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:36,633
Tonight, we are having quite a party.
A surprise party.

1063
01:14:37,925 --> 01:14:40,550
I have a little something
up my sleeve...

1064
01:14:40,633 --> 01:14:44,050
...and I'm not just talking
about the wart on my elbow.

1065
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,051
I have created a
beautiful machine...

1066
01:14:53,717 --> 01:14:56,926
...that is going to encourage
our fellow citizens...

1067
01:14:57,467 --> 01:14:59,634
...to share my vision...

1068
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:01,634
...of the world!

1069
01:15:03,051 --> 01:15:04,634
Can you dig it?

1070
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:09,216
What about Captain Amazing?

1071
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:13,716
That is an excellent
question, Big Tobacco.

1072
01:15:14,508 --> 01:15:19,341
What will we do about the greatest
superhero Champion City has ever known?

1073
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:23,758
For the answer, I want you
all to walk this way.

1074
01:15:24,216 --> 01:15:26,425
Dude, can we bring the brewskis?

1075
01:15:27,758 --> 01:15:30,883
Yes, of course. You may
absolutely bring the brewskis.

1076
01:15:39,799 --> 01:15:42,132
Things look pretty quiet to me.

1077
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:48,465
Invisible Boy, did
you just let one go?

1078
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:51,299
- No, that wasn't me.
- Well, it wasn't me.

1079
01:15:57,757 --> 01:15:59,758
Don't run! He'll shoot!

1080
01:16:08,675 --> 01:16:11,258
Is he doing what I
think he's doing?

1081
01:16:16,424 --> 01:16:18,007
Just go with it.

1082
01:16:28,924 --> 01:16:31,340
- Can anybody see anything?
- Hey!

1083
01:16:31,465 --> 01:16:33,174
- Who said "hey"?
- Not me.

1084
01:16:33,257 --> 01:16:36,049
Eddie, you don't have
to say, "Not me," okay?

1085
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:39,799
- If someone says, "Who?" and you say...
- Morons, over here.

1086
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:41,840
It's Captain Amazing!

1087
01:16:43,257 --> 01:16:47,339
- We've been looking for you.
- Turn on the light switch behind you.

1088
01:16:52,339 --> 01:16:54,423
We meet again, Captain.

1089
01:16:54,631 --> 01:16:57,006
- We're here to rescue you.
- Yeah.

1090
01:16:58,256 --> 01:17:01,089
I'm Blue Raja. Do you recall me?
Master of silverware?

1091
01:17:01,173 --> 01:17:04,215
You said to keep up the good
work after the Red Eye skirmish.

1092
01:17:04,299 --> 01:17:07,549
I meet so many people in this
business, but I think so.

1093
01:17:08,132 --> 01:17:11,340
You two, locate the master ignition
switch on the main console.

1094
01:17:11,424 --> 01:17:12,840
Could you open that up?

1095
01:17:12,924 --> 01:17:15,215
You'll be out in two
shakes of a lamb's tail.

1096
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:17,049
- Frightfully uncomfortable.
- Great.

1097
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,423
- How does this work?
- I've seen one of these.

1098
01:17:19,506 --> 01:17:22,131
You've got to push this
thing in and twist it.

1099
01:17:22,214 --> 01:17:25,048
- Don't force it!
- She's right, my little friend.

1100
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:27,673
This contraption is a
weapon of mass destruction.

1101
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:31,006
Casanova plans to turn it against
the city tonight at midnight.

1102
01:17:31,089 --> 01:17:32,756
Something's happening.

1103
01:17:32,839 --> 01:17:37,506
Very good. On the wall to your left you
should see two toggles side-by-side.

1104
01:17:37,631 --> 01:17:41,214
"Toggles"? What do you mean?
You talking about switches?

1105
01:17:41,298 --> 01:17:43,423
- I see them, Captain.
- Thank you.

1106
01:17:43,506 --> 01:17:45,839
- Flip the first toggle.
- Flipping.

1107
01:17:48,714 --> 01:17:52,213
- Excellent work. Now, flip the...
- Jolly good work, team!

1108
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,047
Could you just stay
over there, please?

1109
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:56,588
Of course.

1110
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:00,797
Sorry.

1111
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,672
- Now flip the second toggle.
- Do as he says.

1112
01:18:04,922 --> 01:18:07,213
The man knows what he's saying.

1113
01:18:07,297 --> 01:18:11,631
Captain, I'm just gonna ask you directly.
Do you know billionaire Lance Hunt?

1114
01:18:11,756 --> 01:18:12,798
It's me.

1115
01:18:14,381 --> 01:18:16,714
No, I'm kidding. I've
always wanted to do that.

1116
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:20,173
- What's next?
- I just told you, flip the second toggle.

1117
01:18:20,256 --> 01:18:22,464
- Again?
- What do you mean?

1118
01:18:23,548 --> 01:18:25,838
- Flip the toggle twice?
- No, no.

1119
01:18:26,005 --> 01:18:29,463
Don't do that. Just flip it again now.
One time. Flip it.

1120
01:18:29,547 --> 01:18:31,338
Does he understand
what I'm asking?

1121
01:18:31,422 --> 01:18:35,963
Hold on a second. Exactly how
many toggle flips in toto...

1122
01:18:36,088 --> 01:18:37,963
...are involved in
this procedure?

1123
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:41,588
I just... It's... seven!

1124
01:18:42,588 --> 01:18:43,963
- Seven?
- Flip it!

1125
01:18:44,088 --> 01:18:46,963
- Seven?
- Everybody, hold the phone.

1126
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:50,797
You phrased that incorrectly. How
many toggle flips are needed...

1127
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,213
...not counting the gratuitous toggle
flip you may have asked for...

1128
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:56,672
- ...in a moment of panic.
- Flip it!

1129
01:18:56,837 --> 01:19:00,462
Could we just start again? Is there
a reset button on this thing?

1130
01:19:00,546 --> 01:19:03,879
No, you freak, there's no reset button.
Flip the switch, lady.

1131
01:19:03,962 --> 01:19:06,796
Don't stare at me. Lift your left arm.
Flip it, moron!

1132
01:19:06,879 --> 01:19:08,504
- You're a moron!
- I am not!

1133
01:19:08,546 --> 01:19:11,254
- Don't call her a moron. That's not cool.
- Thank you.

1134
01:19:11,337 --> 01:19:14,712
- I will do it!
- Flip the switch.

1135
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:16,338
It's this one, yes?

1136
01:19:18,297 --> 01:19:19,755
Wrong switch.

1137
01:19:37,629 --> 01:19:40,254
Everybody heard me say,
"Reset button," right?

1138
01:19:40,337 --> 01:19:43,046
My God, we killed him.

1139
01:19:43,629 --> 01:19:46,337
What do you mean "we"?
I was right here.

1140
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,546
I'm gonna check his pulse.

1141
01:20:08,753 --> 01:20:10,628
I don't think he'll
pull through.

1142
01:20:10,753 --> 01:20:13,545
Somebody's coming. We
gotta get out of here.

1143
01:20:13,753 --> 01:20:16,878
Everybody should just keep
holding their horses.

1144
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,003
Go, go, go.

1145
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:28,546
God in heaven!

1146
01:20:34,712 --> 01:20:37,253
- This sucker's dead!
- What happened to him?

1147
01:20:39,086 --> 01:20:40,836
As you can see...

1148
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,586
...I have taken
Captain Amazing...

1149
01:20:44,628 --> 01:20:46,336
...out of the picture.

1150
01:20:47,128 --> 01:20:49,128
It's time for us to rule.

1151
01:20:52,003 --> 01:20:55,711
Tonight at midnight, I'm going
to do to Champion City...

1152
01:20:55,836 --> 01:20:58,711
...what I have done to
its greatest superhero.

1153
01:20:59,211 --> 01:21:02,836
There'll still be time to
go up, get down and boogie.

1154
01:21:05,045 --> 01:21:07,961
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Where's Captain Amazing?

1155
01:21:08,086 --> 01:21:10,794
- There's been a bit of a cock-up.
- Raja murdered him.

1156
01:21:10,877 --> 01:21:14,460
Guys, I think we got bigger
fish to fry right now.

1157
01:21:14,544 --> 01:21:16,919
- What the hell was that machine?
- I don't know.

1158
01:21:17,002 --> 01:21:18,960
But I know where we
can go to find out.

1159
01:21:25,544 --> 01:21:27,544
The vermin are back, Tony.

1160
01:21:29,545 --> 01:21:32,378
Vermin should be
exterminated, Casanova.

1161
01:21:34,128 --> 01:21:37,920
A fish fork is no
match for my machine!

1162
01:21:39,545 --> 01:21:42,544
But I think we should
take out some insurance.

1163
01:21:43,419 --> 01:21:44,419
Don't you think?

1164
01:21:45,294 --> 01:21:47,002
It's a psychofrakulator.

1165
01:21:47,085 --> 01:21:50,877
It creates a cloud of radically
fluctuating free-deviant chaotrons...

1166
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,377
...which penetrate
the synaptic relays.

1167
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:57,044
It's concatenated with a
synchronous transport switch...

1168
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,627
...that creates a
virtual tributary.

1169
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,669
It's focused onto a
biobolic reflector.

1170
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:07,419
And what happens is that
hallucinations become reality...

1171
01:22:08,835 --> 01:22:11,210
...and the brain is literally
fried from within.

1172
01:22:11,335 --> 01:22:15,251
- Where would you get it?
- I don't know, they said it couldn't be built.

1173
01:22:15,376 --> 01:22:19,084
The equations were so complex that any
of the scientists who worked on it...

1174
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:20,626
...wound up in an insane asylum.

1175
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:24,084
Which is where Casanova's
been for the last 20 years.

1176
01:22:24,209 --> 01:22:26,751
If he uses it, it'll
waste Champion City!

1177
01:22:26,876 --> 01:22:29,209
- Not "if." "When."
- We need Captain Amazing.

1178
01:22:29,293 --> 01:22:31,501
Unfortunately, we
just killed him.

1179
01:22:31,793 --> 01:22:34,002
No, unfortunately,
you killed him.

1180
01:22:34,502 --> 01:22:37,919
Because you have problems at home
doesn't mean you can kill people.

1181
01:22:38,002 --> 01:22:41,669
"Sorry. Mummy. I'm English.
I didn't mean it."

1182
01:22:41,835 --> 01:22:44,544
K-I-L-L-E-D. You killed him.

1183
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:47,251
You killed him. You
hit the switch.

1184
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:50,293
It's the same difference.
He's still dead.

1185
01:22:51,126 --> 01:22:53,168
- You did kind of...
- Sphinx!

1186
01:22:54,418 --> 01:22:57,126
Sphinx, what in
heaven's name do we do?

1187
01:22:58,543 --> 01:22:59,918
Sometimes...

1188
01:23:00,209 --> 01:23:04,043
...the true hero is the one
with the courage to run away.

1189
01:23:04,834 --> 01:23:07,709
- I like the way this man thinks.
- Let's run.

1190
01:23:08,959 --> 01:23:10,126
We can't run.

1191
01:23:10,584 --> 01:23:13,709
Yes. It's been established
that we can run.

1192
01:23:14,793 --> 01:23:19,709
This is egg salad loaded with cholesterol.
My wife won't even let me touch it.

1193
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:24,500
Hardly seems to matter now.
Chances are, we're already dead.

1194
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:27,042
Amazing is gone.

1195
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:31,875
There's no use waiting for the cavalry,
because, as of now, the cavalry is us.

1196
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:35,333
- Yeah, but I don't wanna get frakulated.
- Psychofrakulated.

1197
01:23:35,667 --> 01:23:39,834
- We still get frakulated.
- This is our fight, whether we like it or not.

1198
01:23:40,168 --> 01:23:42,709
We're not your
classic superheroes.

1199
01:23:42,834 --> 01:23:45,918
We're not the favorites.
We're the other guys.

1200
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:48,668
We're the guys
nobody ever bets on.

1201
01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:52,293
But I'll tell you what I think.

1202
01:23:52,376 --> 01:23:56,042
You and that ball of yours have
an appointment you must keep.

1203
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:59,667
Invisible Boy, I think
it's time you were seen.

1204
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:02,417
Sphinx, you have
trained us well.

1205
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:06,375
Dr. Heller, you might just have
given us the edge we need.

1206
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:09,833
Spleen, I don't want
to stand behind you.

1207
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:12,958
But I'll fight beside
you with pride.

1208
01:24:13,042 --> 01:24:15,958
Jeff, you've got a rare
and beautiful gift.

1209
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:18,958
The city needs you tonight.
And, Roy...

1210
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:23,792
...in all the years I've known you, I've
never seen you walk away from a fight.

1211
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:26,041
You lifted a city bus once.

1212
01:24:26,124 --> 01:24:29,499
I think you've got what it
takes to handle Casanova.

1213
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:33,207
We're all in over our
heads, and we know it.

1214
01:24:33,291 --> 01:24:36,332
But if we take on this fight,
those of us who survive it...

1215
01:24:36,416 --> 01:24:40,041
...will forever after show our
scars with pride and say:

1216
01:24:40,166 --> 01:24:43,832
"That's right. I was there.
I fought the good fight."

1217
01:24:44,707 --> 01:24:46,083
So, what do you say?

1218
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:50,333
Do we all gather together and
go kick some Casanova butt...

1219
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:53,917
...or do I eat this sandwich?

1220
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:58,042
I say, what the fork.
Let's do it.

1221
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:03,624
If we're gonna bust into that mansion
you need more than your car.

1222
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:06,916
At the auto yard, there's this
old Herkimer battle jitney.

1223
01:25:06,999 --> 01:25:09,624
Wait. You have a
Herkimer battle jitney?

1224
01:25:09,707 --> 01:25:12,582
That's the finest non-lethal
military vehicle ever made.

1225
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:15,541
All right. We'll meet at the
junkyard and go from there.

1226
01:25:15,624 --> 01:25:18,249
I shall need more
forks, I'm afraid.

1227
01:25:18,332 --> 01:25:20,999
Those who have loved ones,
say good-bye before we go.

1228
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:23,166
You may not get another chance.

1229
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:30,582
Zei gezunt.

1230
01:25:40,623 --> 01:25:41,915
Hey, Mom.

1231
01:25:42,998 --> 01:25:45,206
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

1232
01:25:45,998 --> 01:25:47,623
I was just...

1233
01:25:55,207 --> 01:25:57,207
I'm a superhero, Mother.

1234
01:25:57,624 --> 01:25:59,041
A superhero?

1235
01:25:59,207 --> 01:26:01,624
An effete British
superhero, to be precise.

1236
01:26:01,707 --> 01:26:04,831
I am pilfering your tableware
because I hurl it.

1237
01:26:04,956 --> 01:26:08,915
I hurl it with a deadly accuracy.
The Blue Raja is my name.

1238
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,915
I don't wear much blue, and I
speak in a British accent.

1239
01:26:11,998 --> 01:26:14,081
If you know your
history, it makes sense.

1240
01:26:14,165 --> 01:26:16,956
The point is, your boy's a
Limey fork-flinger, Mother.

1241
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,040
Hard cheese to swallow,
but there it is.

1242
01:26:20,581 --> 01:26:22,915
What will the bridge club think?

1243
01:26:26,956 --> 01:26:28,456
You need more forks?

1244
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:35,915
These belonged to your
great-great-grandmother.

1245
01:26:36,206 --> 01:26:38,539
I was saving these for
your wedding day.

1246
01:26:38,622 --> 01:26:43,539
But, from the looks of it, that
day is probably a long way off.

1247
01:26:44,122 --> 01:26:47,497
Mom, you're taking
this incredibly well.

1248
01:26:48,414 --> 01:26:50,664
I've always known
you were special...

1249
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:54,122
...but I just never
realized how special.

1250
01:26:59,915 --> 01:27:01,665
I'd better get going.

1251
01:27:02,206 --> 01:27:03,748
I've got a city to save.

1252
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:05,373
- Jeffrey?
- Yeah?

1253
01:27:05,706 --> 01:27:07,206
Do the accent.

1254
01:27:09,706 --> 01:27:13,247
I'd love to stay and chitchat,
but I fear I must away with me.

1255
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:16,205
Our metropolis is in the
clutches of madmen.

1256
01:27:16,289 --> 01:27:17,622
Jeffrey?

1257
01:27:17,747 --> 01:27:19,997
- Cheerio.
- I really should get going.

1258
01:27:20,122 --> 01:27:21,414
Okay.

1259
01:27:24,622 --> 01:27:25,997
Thanks, Ma.

1260
01:27:35,622 --> 01:27:38,164
I said I'd leave you, Eddie.
I meant it.

1261
01:27:40,164 --> 01:27:44,079
The city's in peril, Lucille.
We're the best hope they've got.

1262
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:47,204
Eddie, please don't start.

1263
01:27:47,871 --> 01:27:49,871
I don't expect you
to believe me.

1264
01:27:49,954 --> 01:27:51,954
I just came by to tell you...

1265
01:27:52,913 --> 01:27:54,329
...that I love you.

1266
01:27:54,413 --> 01:27:56,413
Tell the kids I love them.

1267
01:27:56,496 --> 01:27:57,913
And now...

1268
01:27:59,204 --> 01:28:02,079
- ...good-bye.
- Good-bye, Eddie.

1269
01:28:03,413 --> 01:28:05,705
I won't be here
when you come home.

1270
01:28:06,122 --> 01:28:08,247
That's a chance
I'll have to take.

1271
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:11,664
Otherwise, there may not
be a home to come back to.

1272
01:28:22,038 --> 01:28:23,538
Wish me luck.

1273
01:28:34,288 --> 01:28:37,579
- You okay?
- I wanted to say I had a great time tonight.

1274
01:28:37,663 --> 01:28:39,663
And you were really nice to me.

1275
01:28:39,746 --> 01:28:42,871
And I would love to
ask you out sometime.

1276
01:28:43,204 --> 01:28:46,621
But if I don't call you, I want you
to know it's because I'm dead.

1277
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:50,078
Me and my team are going to
take on Casanova Frankenstein.

1278
01:28:50,412 --> 01:28:52,620
It's pretty much a
suicide mission.

1279
01:28:52,703 --> 01:28:56,703
So, if there is anything that
you want to say to me...

1280
01:28:57,370 --> 01:29:01,078
...now would probably be a good
time to say it, just 'cause...

1281
01:29:01,453 --> 01:29:04,328
- Yeah, I got a question for you.
- Cool. Kick it.

1282
01:29:04,412 --> 01:29:06,078
What's your name?

1283
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:08,912
Do you mean my secret identity?
'Cause I couldn't...

1284
01:29:08,995 --> 01:29:11,579
No, I just mean your name.

1285
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:14,579
My name.

1286
01:29:19,829 --> 01:29:22,121
It's Phoenix.

1287
01:29:24,078 --> 01:29:25,620
Phoenix Dark.

1288
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:28,995
Dirk. Phoenix...

1289
01:29:31,078 --> 01:29:32,037
...Dark-Dirk.

1290
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:36,245
I was christened Dirk Steele,
and I changed it to Phoenix.

1291
01:29:36,787 --> 01:29:38,912
Forget about it. It's okay.

1292
01:29:45,745 --> 01:29:47,037
It's Roy.

1293
01:29:48,912 --> 01:29:51,037
That's my name. My name is...

1294
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:54,203
My real name is Roy.

1295
01:30:14,411 --> 01:30:16,495
Just be Roy.

1296
01:30:26,953 --> 01:30:29,286
Roy. I'm Roy.

1297
01:30:29,661 --> 01:30:30,786
Yes, I'm Roy.

1298
01:30:30,869 --> 01:30:34,411
- Roy. Who is Roy? Roy is who?
- He's freaking out, man.

1299
01:30:34,536 --> 01:30:37,036
Where's the guy who
pretends not to be Roy?

1300
01:30:37,161 --> 01:30:41,952
We've had quite enough of that. Stop it.
Just snap out of it. We're tired of it.

1301
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:46,327
I'm a true wanna-be, in
the worst sense of the...

1302
01:30:46,577 --> 01:30:48,869
You guys have to fight
this battle without me.

1303
01:30:48,952 --> 01:30:51,661
If you doubt your
superpowers, you are shafted.

1304
01:30:51,744 --> 01:30:55,286
If I had any superpowers to doubt,
I'd be in trouble, but I don't.

1305
01:30:55,369 --> 01:30:57,494
What do I do? All I do is go...

1306
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:00,411
Roy, what are you talking about?
You lifted a bus once.

1307
01:31:00,494 --> 01:31:02,743
Precisely. That
story's legendary.

1308
01:31:02,826 --> 01:31:06,451
It was really more of
a push than a lift.

1309
01:31:06,535 --> 01:31:09,618
That still takes incredible
superhuman strength.

1310
01:31:09,743 --> 01:31:12,160
It does. To push an
entire bus out the way.

1311
01:31:12,243 --> 01:31:14,993
Actually, the driver had his
foot on the accelerator...

1312
01:31:15,076 --> 01:31:17,326
...to get it going, then
it actually was me.

1313
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:18,993
But he kind of...

1314
01:31:22,119 --> 01:31:23,369
Shit.

1315
01:31:27,952 --> 01:31:29,119
Excuse me.

1316
01:31:32,327 --> 01:31:36,160
It starts a process which results in
an accelerated flow of electrons...

1317
01:31:36,243 --> 01:31:38,368
...that creates a
powerful magnetic force.

1318
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:40,951
This is basically like
a huge electromagnet.

1319
01:31:41,076 --> 01:31:44,243
Actually, it's an
electro-nuclear-magnet.

1320
01:31:44,326 --> 01:31:45,951
It's the next inevitable phase.

1321
01:31:46,035 --> 01:31:49,576
- Vis, can you close up those jockey boxes?
- Right on it.

1322
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:52,743
Let's get suited up. We're
out of here in five.

1323
01:31:57,451 --> 01:31:58,743
It's time.

1324
01:32:00,993 --> 01:32:02,243
Let's go.

1325
01:32:54,450 --> 01:32:57,200
- Shotgun!
- I already called it, didn't I?

1326
01:32:57,325 --> 01:32:59,742
- Have a seat, my friend.
- Everybody ready?

1327
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:03,825
- We have lift-off.
- May the forks be with us.

1328
01:33:09,492 --> 01:33:12,949
- Sorry. Too much throttle.
- That's cool. I'm just gonna go.

1329
01:33:13,033 --> 01:33:16,116
- No, sit down!
- All right, here we go.

1330
01:33:29,658 --> 01:33:31,241
Vaya con Dios.

1331
01:33:35,742 --> 01:33:37,992
Somebody do something.
We need him.

1332
01:33:38,117 --> 01:33:40,534
Let's do this. You're
a very furious man.

1333
01:33:40,617 --> 01:33:42,492
- Do you understand that?
- No.

1334
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:45,492
You got a lot to be furious
about, and I'll tell you why.

1335
01:33:45,575 --> 01:33:49,199
You're not well-liked. You're
abrasive and off-putting.

1336
01:33:49,574 --> 01:33:52,199
You try to be pithy, but
your wit is a hindrance...

1337
01:33:52,283 --> 01:33:54,241
...therefore, nothing
is provocative.

1338
01:33:54,324 --> 01:33:57,241
It's just mixed metaphors.
Doesn't that make you angry?

1339
01:33:57,324 --> 01:33:59,241
- Does it infuriate you?
- No.

1340
01:33:59,324 --> 01:34:02,408
It should. Are you angry?
Come on, man!

1341
01:34:02,616 --> 01:34:06,616
- Your penmanship is atrocious.
- You dress like a male prostitute.

1342
01:34:11,658 --> 01:34:14,824
Get real! I have no
powers whatsoever.

1343
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:17,783
If he has no powers, maybe
I've got no powers.

1344
01:34:17,866 --> 01:34:21,157
- Maybe I can't turn invisible at all.
- Do not go there, son!

1345
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:24,490
When you doubt your powers, you
give power to your doubts.

1346
01:34:24,615 --> 01:34:28,240
I don't mean to be an alarmist,
but it's 11:30 already.

1347
01:34:28,532 --> 01:34:30,990
Thirty minutes till
Casanova blows up the city.

1348
01:34:31,073 --> 01:34:34,907
Listen. We've got a blind
date with destiny.

1349
01:34:36,657 --> 01:34:38,948
And it looks like she's
ordered the lobster.

1350
01:34:40,783 --> 01:34:41,824
Hang on!

1351
01:34:42,949 --> 01:34:44,949
We're going to ram the gate!

1352
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:06,907
What do you think? Should we
knock or just let ourselves in?

1353
01:35:22,907 --> 01:35:24,490
Hit the ground!

1354
01:35:41,447 --> 01:35:42,906
They're shooting!

1355
01:35:59,906 --> 01:36:01,947
I hope this magnet thing works.

1356
01:36:16,781 --> 01:36:17,989
It's working.

1357
01:36:29,781 --> 01:36:31,030
Go! Go!

1358
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,030
Quickly! Everybody
into the disco room!

1359
01:36:40,321 --> 01:36:42,863
Everyone, through here.
Keep moving.

1360
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:46,446
Focus, people. Focus. Let's go.

1361
01:36:52,906 --> 01:36:54,072
Hello?

1362
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:03,738
Wait!

1363
01:37:12,446 --> 01:37:13,780
Laser eye.

1364
01:37:25,821 --> 01:37:28,113
I should have brought
my large pie server.

1365
01:37:28,196 --> 01:37:31,530
If we can't get through that
door, this battle is over.

1366
01:37:35,321 --> 01:37:36,862
This is it.

1367
01:37:37,237 --> 01:37:39,320
My time has come.

1368
01:37:39,779 --> 01:37:41,862
What are you talking about?

1369
01:37:42,945 --> 01:37:45,362
- Wait. Invisible Boy.
- I wouldn't do that, if...

1370
01:37:45,445 --> 01:37:49,070
- Come back here. You'll be cremated.
- It's all about me now.

1371
01:37:49,237 --> 01:37:52,154
- I'm the only one that can save us.
- He's right.

1372
01:37:52,237 --> 01:37:54,695
- Good luck, son.
- Nobody look at me.

1373
01:37:54,862 --> 01:37:58,446
- Don't look at him, or it won't work.
- I am transparent.

1374
01:37:59,571 --> 01:38:02,280
I am like the window.
I am see-through.

1375
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:04,863
I'm like Saran Wrap.

1376
01:38:14,987 --> 01:38:18,570
I did it! I'm invisible! I
really do have superpowers.

1377
01:38:18,654 --> 01:38:20,195
Can you see me?

1378
01:38:20,695 --> 01:38:21,779
Yes.

1379
01:38:23,987 --> 01:38:25,237
Two hands there, son.

1380
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:29,612
Maybe you should put some shorts on
if you want to keep fighting evil.

1381
01:38:30,612 --> 01:38:33,487
Furriers, you will stay here
and delay the attackers.

1382
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:38,237
Not So Goody Mob, fight from behind.
The rest of you, into the atrium.

1383
01:38:38,654 --> 01:38:41,612
Spread yourselves out for
a second wave of attack.

1384
01:38:52,736 --> 01:38:54,361
The door. Door.

1385
01:38:55,278 --> 01:38:58,528
On three. One, two, three.

1386
01:39:13,695 --> 01:39:15,029
Shrink 'em.

1387
01:39:27,611 --> 01:39:30,944
I say, they've gone from
junior to missy petite.

1388
01:39:32,569 --> 01:39:33,403
My dress!

1389
01:39:33,486 --> 01:39:36,111
Now that's a wedgie she
won't soon forget.

1390
01:39:36,903 --> 01:39:39,528
My pants feel like
they're shrinking, too.

1391
01:39:46,653 --> 01:39:48,860
- Blame thrower!
- Look out!

1392
01:39:53,443 --> 01:39:55,152
I got a bone to pick with you!

1393
01:39:55,277 --> 01:39:56,277
Hold it!

1394
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:58,110
I'm boss!

1395
01:39:58,235 --> 01:40:00,443
You know what? Y'all
make me sick.

1396
01:40:10,111 --> 01:40:11,611
Give me that gun.

1397
01:40:16,194 --> 01:40:18,236
- I got 'em.
- Disco forever!

1398
01:40:19,028 --> 01:40:21,110
Invisible Boy, Spleen. Susies.

1399
01:41:12,317 --> 01:41:13,901
Dig this, Shovel Man.

1400
01:41:22,193 --> 01:41:23,818
Duck! It's the Susies!

1401
01:41:23,902 --> 01:41:25,735
- Grab the gun.
- It's stuck.

1402
01:41:26,942 --> 01:41:28,317
Coast clear?

1403
01:41:28,692 --> 01:41:30,192
Shoot anyway.

1404
01:41:33,067 --> 01:41:35,567
- I'm scared.
- No, you're not scared. Be strong.

1405
01:41:35,651 --> 01:41:38,359
Say it with me, "I ain't
scared of no Susies."

1406
01:41:38,401 --> 01:41:40,859
- I am scared.
- Say "I'm not scared of no Susies."

1407
01:41:40,942 --> 01:41:42,692
Come on. You ready?

1408
01:41:43,192 --> 01:41:44,484
Let's go!

1409
01:41:52,984 --> 01:41:54,734
Dive!

1410
01:42:06,066 --> 01:42:07,316
I'm hit!

1411
01:42:07,775 --> 01:42:10,941
- Where?
- I'm hit! Medic! Man down!

1412
01:42:11,025 --> 01:42:13,233
- Man down! I can't feel my ass.
- What?

1413
01:42:13,316 --> 01:42:15,191
I can't feel my ass!

1414
01:42:15,441 --> 01:42:16,816
Your powers still work?

1415
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:19,066
My powers? Weapons check.

1416
01:42:21,567 --> 01:42:23,776
Fire in the hole!

1417
01:42:28,317 --> 01:42:30,109
- It'll do.
- Spleen!

1418
01:42:30,276 --> 01:42:33,233
- Go check on Spleen, okay?
- Okay. All right.

1419
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:38,691
You ought to run, Tony P.

1420
01:42:38,775 --> 01:42:41,108
You can't hurt me, Baby Bowler.

1421
01:42:42,483 --> 01:42:44,358
'Cause I'm protected...

1422
01:42:46,025 --> 01:42:47,983
...by the god of hair care.

1423
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:52,941
And it's time to send
you back to your daddy.

1424
01:42:53,025 --> 01:42:56,816
- You killed my father.
- That's right. 'Cause I'm a killer.

1425
01:42:57,025 --> 01:42:59,816
And you're not.
Let's face it, kid.

1426
01:43:00,275 --> 01:43:02,733
You don't have the
guts to kill me.

1427
01:43:02,858 --> 01:43:06,024
You're right. I don't have
the guts to kill you.

1428
01:43:06,190 --> 01:43:09,232
Because I'm better than you.
Yeah, that's right.

1429
01:43:09,315 --> 01:43:10,774
A lot better.

1430
01:43:11,732 --> 01:43:14,774
I may even find the courage
to forgive you someday.

1431
01:43:24,565 --> 01:43:28,525
Carmine, on the other hand, feels
differently than I do about forgiveness.

1432
01:43:30,608 --> 01:43:33,775
Now I'm going back to graduate school.
That was the agreement.

1433
01:43:33,858 --> 01:43:36,858
We're doing it. We're winning.
We're gonna pull this off.

1434
01:43:36,941 --> 01:43:39,357
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

1435
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:43,732
Tell your funny-looking friends to
put down their weapons, Mr. Furious.

1436
01:43:43,857 --> 01:43:46,274
Get out of here. He's crazy.
Save yourselves.

1437
01:43:46,357 --> 01:43:50,649
Put them down or I will slash your
girlfriend's pretty little throat.

1438
01:43:50,982 --> 01:43:53,190
Eddie, Jeff, do what he says.

1439
01:43:58,274 --> 01:43:59,607
Thank you.

1440
01:44:00,232 --> 01:44:04,232
It's so easy to get the best of people
when they care about each other.

1441
01:44:05,190 --> 01:44:07,774
Which is why evil will
always have the edge.

1442
01:44:08,274 --> 01:44:11,357
You good guys are always
so bound by the rules.

1443
01:44:18,773 --> 01:44:21,231
You see, I kill my own men.

1444
01:44:27,814 --> 01:44:29,273
Lucky me.

1445
01:44:30,273 --> 01:44:31,898
I get the girl.

1446
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:34,232
No!

1447
01:45:02,106 --> 01:45:05,939
Don't worry. It will all
be over so very quickly.

1448
01:45:11,314 --> 01:45:12,481
What are you doing?

1449
01:45:12,606 --> 01:45:15,356
They ripped the "Q" section
out of my dictionary...

1450
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:18,522
...'cause I don't know the
meaning of the word "quit."

1451
01:45:32,897 --> 01:45:35,438
You want a little fisticuffs?
Okay.

1452
01:45:39,273 --> 01:45:40,481
Get him, Roy.

1453
01:45:46,314 --> 01:45:47,773
Come on, Roy!

1454
01:46:01,813 --> 01:46:03,563
It's the funkyskunkulator!

1455
01:46:03,647 --> 01:46:06,188
- We've got to stop it.
- Don't touch any toggles.

1456
01:46:08,063 --> 01:46:10,438
Rage taking over.

1457
01:46:10,772 --> 01:46:13,605
Ja. We've heard all that before.

1458
01:46:14,772 --> 01:46:16,147
No, no.

1459
01:46:16,522 --> 01:46:18,647
Rage really taking over.

1460
01:47:09,729 --> 01:47:12,187
Frak you later, Frankenpuss.

1461
01:47:20,229 --> 01:47:21,229
Yeah!

1462
01:47:39,895 --> 01:47:40,645
Get out of here.

1463
01:47:46,936 --> 01:47:48,145
Hit the deck.

1464
01:47:52,354 --> 01:47:54,521
How do we shut this thing down?

1465
01:47:55,604 --> 01:47:56,896
Group hug!

1466
01:47:57,229 --> 01:47:58,729
- Yeah!
- Okay!

1467
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:07,936
- Hurry up!
- Get her closer to the hole!

1468
01:48:11,561 --> 01:48:13,978
Dad, this is the
way it has to be.

1469
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:18,061
The upshot is you won't be killed
because you're already dead.

1470
01:48:18,228 --> 01:48:20,103
No, I'm not going with you.

1471
01:48:20,186 --> 01:48:23,811
If there's a time for separation, let
me tell you something, this is it.

1472
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,603
- Lift me up.
- Push her up.

1473
01:48:25,686 --> 01:48:27,728
Help me lift her up.

1474
01:48:29,186 --> 01:48:31,270
You can do it. Hold on.

1475
01:48:35,894 --> 01:48:38,810
- Do it!
- I love you, Dad!

1476
01:48:49,519 --> 01:48:52,602
- Run! Run!
- Let's get out of here!

1477
01:48:55,019 --> 01:48:56,770
Run for your lives!

1478
01:49:08,977 --> 01:49:09,810
Go!

1479
01:49:09,894 --> 01:49:11,019
Watch out!

1480
01:49:19,269 --> 01:49:20,394
Go!

1481
01:49:33,019 --> 01:49:35,894
No one could survive the chaos
we've just witnessed here.

1482
01:49:35,977 --> 01:49:40,102
But as the dust begins to settle over
the ruins of Casanova's mansion...

1483
01:49:40,185 --> 01:49:42,143
...the question remains:

1484
01:49:42,226 --> 01:49:46,434
Who were these brave heroes that gave
their lives to save our city tonight?

1485
01:49:46,601 --> 01:49:49,184
Did that frakulator work, or what?
What's the deal?

1486
01:49:49,268 --> 01:49:51,851
Something's moving.
People are coming out.

1487
01:49:51,976 --> 01:49:55,309
- Could you tell us what's going on?
- Hi. Excuse me.

1488
01:49:55,393 --> 01:49:58,851
Excuse me. Can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

1489
01:49:58,934 --> 01:50:00,101
We did it. We won.

1490
01:50:00,184 --> 01:50:01,851
Hey, that's my team.

1491
01:50:02,477 --> 01:50:05,269
We struck down evil with the
mighty sword of teamwork...

1492
01:50:05,394 --> 01:50:08,310
- ...and the hammer of not-bickering.
- We are number one.

1493
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:10,519
All others are
number two or lower.

1494
01:50:10,602 --> 01:50:13,602
- Who are you guys?
- They call me the Shoveler.

1495
01:50:13,685 --> 01:50:15,018
That's my dad.

1496
01:50:17,101 --> 01:50:18,143
My hero.

1497
01:50:18,226 --> 01:50:20,101
I'm the Bowler. Hello.

1498
01:50:22,726 --> 01:50:25,559
Blue Raja, master of silverware.
Hi, Mom.

1499
01:50:25,643 --> 01:50:27,893
I mean, cheerio, Mummy.

1500
01:50:28,976 --> 01:50:30,809
Jeffrey.

1501
01:50:30,893 --> 01:50:33,768
And you, sir. What's your
name and your superpower?

1502
01:50:34,226 --> 01:50:35,726
My name's Roy.

1503
01:50:35,934 --> 01:50:38,768
I'm in a super amount of pain.
Could you leave me alone?

1504
01:50:38,851 --> 01:50:42,768
His name's Mr. Furious, and his power
comes from his boundless rage.

1505
01:50:43,393 --> 01:50:47,100
Excuse me. Could I say something? I
think we would all like this victory...

1506
01:50:47,225 --> 01:50:49,517
...to go out to all
the other guys.

1507
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,100
The people in this city...

1508
01:50:51,183 --> 01:50:54,183
...who are super good at their
jobs but never get credit...

1509
01:50:54,267 --> 01:50:56,600
...like the lady in the D.M.V.
That's a rough job.

1510
01:50:56,683 --> 01:50:59,850
To the people that remember
jingles from old commercials.

1511
01:50:59,933 --> 01:51:02,767
People that support local
music and independent film.

1512
01:51:02,850 --> 01:51:05,892
The guy that drives the snowplow.
The school nurse...

1513
01:51:06,017 --> 01:51:07,808
Eddie, I think they
got the point.

1514
01:51:07,892 --> 01:51:09,601
What's the name of this group?

1515
01:51:09,684 --> 01:51:10,934
The Super Dudes.

1516
01:51:11,018 --> 01:51:12,393
No, not the Super Dudes.

1517
01:51:12,476 --> 01:51:16,018
We don't have a name yet, but we're
definitely not the Super Dudes.

1518
01:51:16,101 --> 01:51:17,768
I gotta get home. It's late.

1519
01:51:17,851 --> 01:51:19,975
Picture, picture time.

1520
01:51:22,975 --> 01:51:25,808
Whatever you call them,
Champion City will forever...

1521
01:51:25,850 --> 01:51:28,767
...owe a debt of gratitude
to these mystery men.

1522
01:51:28,975 --> 01:51:30,850
Wait. That's it.

1523
01:51:30,933 --> 01:51:33,892
We are the Super Squad.

1524
01:51:34,308 --> 01:51:35,517
No!

1525
01:51:36,058 --> 01:51:38,933
--http://7ays.com--
Alliteration in these
situations is corny.

1526
01:51:39,725 --> 01:51:40,933
--http://7ays.com--
What?

1527
01:51:41,058 --> 01:51:43,933
--http://7ays.com--
Yes, we're all very aware
that you saved the day...

1528
01:51:44,017 --> 01:51:46,392
--http://7ays.com--
...and I'm sure we'll be hearing
about it for the rest of our lives.
