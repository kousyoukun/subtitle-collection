00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:28,446
TWO ORPHAN VAMPIRES

2
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,856
<i>GLYCINES ORPHANAGE</i>

3
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,360
<i>GLYCINES ORPHANAGE</i>

4
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,446
FOUNDED BY THE ABBESS OF SAINT-AUBIN

5
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,271
You say they've been blind since birth?

6
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,357
I don't think so.

7
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,943
They say that they could see
as little girls.

8
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,487
Something inexplicable happened.

9
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,989
They said that the colors
just disappeared one day.

10
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,825
Colors?
They could no longer distinguish colors?

11
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,118
That's right.

12
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,995
They saw in black and white.

13
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,248
That's impossible.

14
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,333
Has anyone examined them before me?

15
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,834
But of course.

16
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,837
Their blindness is inexplicable.

17
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,799
But who are they?

18
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,259
We don't know.

19
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,220
They are abandoned children.
We know nothing of-

20
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,514
Here they come.

21
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,790
This is Dr. Dennery, my children.

22
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,959
He is a respected eye specialist.

23
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,044
The best perhaps.

24
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,839
Look at me.

25
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,675
Open your eyes wide.

26
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,312
- What is it?
- What are you doing?

27
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,896
You're moving too fast!

28
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,648
I'm scared.

29
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,488
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
I am here to help.

30
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,262
You're right. They can't see.

31
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,355
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

32
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,690
They're our little blind angels, you know.

33
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,609
We try to protect them.

34
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,156
Sister Martha
even neglects the other orphans a bit.

35
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,825
I should scold you, Sister Martha.

36
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,704
We all hope that one day,
a man of means -

37
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,248
a man from a good family-
will adopt them.

38
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,584
A man of science, for example.

39
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:19,171
A doctor who could look after them
and nurse them

40
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,798
and maybe one day -

41
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,341
With God's help.

42
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,675
Cure them.

43
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,887
A cure?
That would be marvelous!

44
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,806
We would be so happy.

45
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,101
Oh, that is impossible.

46
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,770
It is God's will
that we see nothing at all.

47
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,730
We must accept our fate.

48
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,589
Good night, dear.

49
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,014
Good night.

50
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,071
Good night, children.

51
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,248
Good night.

52
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:04,151
Perhaps you'll soon have
a wonderful surprise.

53
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,486
But hush.

54
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,572
God's will is a mystery.

55
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,075
Good night, little angels.

56
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,793
Dear Lord, I beg of you,

57
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:26,381
make it so that the good Dr. Dennery
adopts our little martyrs.

58
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,051
They are so dear,

59
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,011
so patient,

60
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,765
so innocent, so gentle.

61
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,005
How good it is to inhale our daytime.

62
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,674
To see, finally.

63
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,134
- See how clear the night is?
- Yes, I see.

64
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,512
I see!

65
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,722
The deserted countryside
beneath the moon.

66
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,558
And over there, in the cemetery,

67
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,143
that poor dog
searching among the graves.

68
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,604
A stray animal, abandoned.

69
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:26,358
- Shall we join him?
- Sure! Everyone is sleeping.

70
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,610
Sister Martha will be
making her rounds at 2:00.

71
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,905
We'll be back before then.

72
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,306
We came from under there.

73
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,017
Do you think we're dead or alive?

74
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,229
We're both.

75
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,232
And the memories?
Do you remember?

76
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,817
I mean before.

77
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,153
What We were before HOW.

78
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:18,697
A bit.

79
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,659
Images, with no beginning or end.

80
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,329
But I know that we both existed,
as we are now.

81
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,754
I believe that, before, we had a mishap,
and we died.

82
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,882
And we returned, as always.

83
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,551
The others -
the other deaths from before -

84
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,928
each time, we had a mishap.

85
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,972
Do you remember?

86
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,893
The two orphans we were,
and who died,

87
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,646
I feel like I see them, I hear them.

88
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,940
They're the ones who remember us.

89
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,526
Isn't that why we return each time?

90
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,320
Of course!

91
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,323
Others kill us. They kill us violently.

92
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,908
But we return.

93
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:10,207
Henriette, I don't believe
that we're only a dream.

94
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,710
Two orphans who incarnate into reality.

95
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:19,549
They can't understand that,
all those who hunt us down.

96
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,843
If they knew-

97
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,596
You know, Henriette,
if they knew that we're a dream,

98
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,390
they would love and protect us.

99
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:31,019
Because, that way,
they could dream about us.

100
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,773
That's not how it happens.

101
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,317
They find us out,

102
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,569
we have a mishap,

103
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,613
we are killed

104
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,074
and then we return.

105
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,576
- It's like a game?
- A strange game.

106
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,912
But who decides the rules of the game?

107
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,497
No one.

108
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,333
Everything simply is. That's all.

109
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,836
Nobody is responsible.

110
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,964
It's like that.

111
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,925
It's just the way it is.

112
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,266
Why are you crying?

113
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,271
I'm afraid that
we're going to be killed again.

114
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,733
So we will return again!

115
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,862
But what if we didn't come back?

116
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:26,408
What if one day things went wrong
and we stayed dead forever?

117
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,411
Oh, well,
if such a thing happened,

118
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,123
they would dream of the two orphan girls
who could be reborn.

119
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,588
You hear it?

120
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,507
Right there.

121
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,803
There's a house with an open window.

122
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,931
Someone is listening to music.

123
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,142
You hear it?

124
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,903
If they see us,
they'll think we're ghosts!

125
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,613
But we <i>are</i> ghosts!

126
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,730
Come, come.

127
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,191
Yes, good dog.

128
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,826
I remember.

129
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,038
It was far away.

130
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:59,125
There was a bridge, I think.

131
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,168
Yes.

132
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,087
We were on a bridge.

133
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,464
The night was blue, like all our nights.

134
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,883
We weren't blind
because we could see blue.

135
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,678
<i>It was the hour of the hunt.</i>

136
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,519
What happened after that?

137
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,563
We had a mishap.

138
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,481
But before?

139
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,608
Before we died?

140
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,736
<i>What then?</i>

141
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,158
We drank and quenched our thirst.

142
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,300
Come, let's go.

143
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,802
There's no more music,

144
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,930
and we're alive in today,
not dead in yesterday.

145
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,349
You're right.

146
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,226
Sister Martha will
soon be making rounds.

147
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:37,148
Besides, in a little while,
we'll have forgotten our last death.

148
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,900
Come.

149
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:44,197
We are alive, and all the others,
it is they who are dead.

150
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:10,014
And you - do you remember anything?

151
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,809
Anything from before?

152
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,482
Close your eyes.

153
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,735
Do you see?

154
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,529
Yes.

155
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:28,032
Trains with voyagers,
with merchandise.

156
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,745
From here to infinity.

157
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:36,958
Yes, I remember as well.

158
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,127
I can see them too.

159
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,337
We are wanderers,

160
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:45,049
and our roamings are meetings
with creatures that are as strange as we are.

161
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,594
It was daytime, and we were blind.

162
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,763
We came from away, far away.

163
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,432
That's it.

164
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,142
Who was chasing us?

165
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,185
I've forgotten.

166
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,647
Then we found ourselves there.

167
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,788
Someone's there.

168
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,874
Who are you?

169
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,959
You don't speak?

170
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,544
Are you hiding too?

171
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,464
I'm from nowhere and everywhere.

172
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:11,886
If I haunt this train station,
it's because it is silent and solitary.

173
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:16,057
You know, I'm crazy.
Everyone says so.

174
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,143
Both of you also look a little crazy.

175
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,729
I was in one of their clinics,

176
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,773
but then I escaped.

177
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,609
You're blind, huh?

178
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,277
Not all the time.

179
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,987
Nighttime's coming.

180
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:31,531
We will see!

181
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,741
At night we see blue.

182
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,532
You think you see me now.

183
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,702
You see the madwoman
of the train station.

184
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:21,831
My reality is within.

185
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,376
They say I'm crazy
because I'm a she-wolf.

186
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,587
Do you bite too?

187
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,463
Do you transform into a werewolf?

188
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:33,301
An ordinary she-wolf, alone.

189
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,845
I'm so alone.

190
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:39,390
When there's a full moon,
the animal in me comes out.

191
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,603
People don't believe.
That's why they lock me up.

192
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:47,231
But the dogs know. They feel it.

193
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,485
They sniff the wolf,
their enemy, and they attack me.

194
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,531
Often, my stare
keeps them at a distance.

195
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,826
But sometimes
they scratch me with their claws.

196
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,703
That's horrible.

197
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,830
What do you do to escape them?

198
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,961
When there's one or two,
I slit their throats,

199
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,797
strangle them, break their backs.

200
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,300
But if there is a pack,

201
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,802
I find refuge in some place like this,

202
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,554
where they won't come.

203
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,767
You don't believe me. You neither.

204
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,394
You think I'm crazy.

205
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,105
Look what they did to me!

206
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,901
Do you think dogs
would do this normally?

207
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,486
No.

208
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,029
But to a she-wolf,

209
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,864
they're wild dogs.

210
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,502
See the full moon.

211
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:54,507
Listen now, to the she-wolf.

212
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,676
You'll never forget her.

213
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,262
Her cry of anguish and agony
will resound forever in your heads.

214
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:21,951
Dogs

215
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:24,954
They are -

216
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,373
I hear them.

217
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,417
It's me they want!

218
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,877
My scent attracts them.

219
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,219
We'll have to find
a new book for tomorrow.

220
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,889
I took one from
the mother superior's library.

221
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,016
- What is it?
<i>- History of the Incas.</i>

222
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,268
There are the serpent and bat gods.

223
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,936
Those gods - are they us?

224
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,230
Yes, us. You'll see.

225
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,940
There are human sacrifices.

226
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,984
People sacrifice themselves.

227
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,403
They let their throats be slit
just to please us.

228
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,239
- That would be so nice!
- Yes, it would.

229
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,991
Let's go to sleep.

230
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,870
Be happy, my children.

231
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:41,961
With God's love and the respect of
your protector, our good Dr. Dennery.

232
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,046
He'll be your father now.

233
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,049
Ah, we'll miss you.

234
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,802
It's sad to see our angels leave.

235
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,804
We love them so much.

236
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,681
They'll be happy with me.

237
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:54,974
And who knows?

238
00:32:55,057 --> 00:33:00,896
One day I may discover the secret
of their mysterious loss of sight.

239
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,941
Oh, father, you've given us so much.

240
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,945
We're happy just to be with you.

241
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:11,115
Come, my children.
Paris is waiting.

242
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,263
Careful.

243
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,087
And here's the entrance.

244
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,902
Here's the living room.

245
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:35,199
Keep in mind there are three armchairs,
a couch and a coffee table.

246
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,328
You'll learn where each piece
of furniture is placed.

247
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,352
<i>I'll</i> leave you to discover your room.

248
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,752
<i>I'll</i> go to bed early.

249
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:35,592
In the morning, <i>I'll</i> have an opportunity
to show you where everything is.

250
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,889
Good night, my children.

251
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,058
Good night, Doctor.

252
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,603
You'll have to get used to
calling me “father.”

253
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,064
But that'll come.

254
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,063
Our day, for us, is blue.

255
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,690
The light, for us, is black.

256
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,901
The other people's sun
has made us blind.

257
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,904
- But when it is hidden -
- Our dream begins.

258
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:23,367
- They'll never know.
- The two blind orphans can see at night.

259
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,662
- Like the cats.
- Like the tigers. Like the beasts.

260
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,583
- Shall we walk?
- He sleeps like a rock.

261
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:35,045
- I'm hungry.
- We'll go find one of our true homes.

262
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,172
I can feel one close by.

263
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,970
Take out those fake teeth.

264
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,473
You are just  little carnival brats.

265
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,926
- You ate some?
- A big bite, yes.

266
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,429
You're beautiful with her blood.

267
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,099
It's good to be sticky from
the lifeblood of this woman.

268
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,953
Let's go in before he sees.

269
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,288
Just wait.

270
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,497
A game.

271
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,332
Is it dangerous?

272
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:03,795
You dare me to go in front of the window,
naked, without him seeing me?

273
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,172
I dare!

274
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,731
I adore you.

275
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,734
Smear me with some blood.

276
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,357
You smell of blood.

277
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,234
You're the statue of a goddess.

278
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:40,892
I still have the taste of
that woman's blood in my mouth.

279
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:44,062
- We're all covered with it.
- What if the doctor sees?

280
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,829
The blood on your body.

281
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:05,000
Ah, well, take it off.

282
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,256
You like it?

283
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,841
It's good?

284
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,261
My head's spinning.

285
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:20,515
It's as if I were drunk.

286
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,770
I have a surprise for you.

287
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,063
What is it?

288
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:30,525
The book on the Aztecs.
I stole it from the mother superior's library.

289
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,844
Loom

290
00:43:57,927 --> 00:43:59,804
it's the goddess Bat Woman!

291
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:02,390
It's you, Louise. I know it's you.

292
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,854
“This head of Murciéloago,
the Bat God,

293
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:11,566
was made in a holy land
and placed on top of a funeral urn.”

294
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:16,112
Oh, Henriette, it's really me.

295
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,491
And you? Where are you?

296
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:27,165
“A picture of Quetzalcoatl emerging
from the mouth of a feathered serpent.”

297
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,501
You see, he has teeth like mine.

298
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:37,175
We're like goddesses
who march through time and space.

299
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:42,931
One day we'll be able to remember
the time when we were real goddesses.

300
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:47,102
Even if they are all false memories,
we'll remember them.

301
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,479
Look at that.

302
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:35,400
It's the good Dr. Dennery's
two blind orphan girls coming out of mass.

303
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:39,904
I was there. I saw the doctor
dipping their fingers in the font

304
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:42,407
and guiding their hands
to make the sign of the cross.

305
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,910
Poor children, so deprived in life.

306
00:45:45,994 --> 00:45:48,913
And they're so sweet and pure.

307
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:51,958
They're just like two sisters of baby Jesus.

308
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,768
Four, five!

309
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,190
Double five!

310
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,906
Five, four!

311
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,878
Double four!

312
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:46,387
Four, three!

313
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,224
You're cheating.
I'm certain you're cheating.

314
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,809
No, check.

315
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:57,398
It seems to be three, two.

316
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,193
You're the cheater!
It's four and three.

317
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:08,660
Children, tonight <i>I'll</i> be attending
a doctors' conference outside of the city.

318
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:11,412
<i>I'll</i> spend the night there
and return tomorrow.

319
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:14,499
You both know the house well now.

320
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:18,920
Do you mind staying alone,
or should someone come over?

321
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,755
Father, you can go.

322
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,425
- Don't worry. We'll be as good as gold.
- Nothing will happen to us.

323
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,511
Promise... you won't go out?

324
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:30,598
- We'll stay in the house.
- We'll go to bed as soon as you leave.

325
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:34,102
Well, then I can leave reassured.

326
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:20,815
Freedom!

327
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,984
Free for the whole night!

328
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,070
This time,
we're going on a big adventure!

329
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:28,239
Forget that little cemetery!

330
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:31,284
- We'll go to the biggest one.
- And even take the subway!

331
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,262
Finally, I see.

332
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:04,223
- I see blue.
- Me too.

333
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,517
I see perfectly.

334
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,189
It's the biggest house we've ever been in.

335
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,275
A home with a garden to eternity.

336
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:17,361
And all these statues.

337
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:20,531
Of marble and bronze.

338
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:57,235
Look, they're not really blind.

339
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,987
- They're creatures from hell.
<i>- I'll</i> go after them!

340
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,595
Look at that man
running after those girls.

341
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,180
Go help them.

342
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:05,803
You pervert. They're blind!

343
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,389
Stop it, you idiot.
Look at your girlfriend over there!

344
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,529
No!

345
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:33,039
- I can't run anymore.
- Me neither.

346
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,916
They're catching up.

347
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:39,962
We can't let them take us alive. Never!

348
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,548
Let's try killing ourselves!

349
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:45,259
Squeeze!
With all your might!

350
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:47,094
It's impossible!

351
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,486
Come with me. You'll have security.

352
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,701
Here, no one will find you.

353
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:18,496
- Who are you?
- Avampire?

354
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,498
I am the midnight lady.

355
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:23,375
I ﬂy above the cemeteries
like a bird of the night.

356
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:26,128
Like a hawk, I swoop down on my prey.

357
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,839
My vampirical powers
are more accomplished than yours.

358
00:58:28,923 --> 00:58:30,424
<i>I'll</i> hide you tonight,

359
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,678
but while I sleep tomorrow,
you must leave.

360
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:37,097
The midnight lady is solitary.

361
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:41,185
Her destiny is to pass over cemeteries
in her own company, alone.

362
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,437
Well, we're the vampire orphans.

363
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:45,856
We can't fly in the sky,
but we see in the night!

364
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,441
- In blue!
- And we bite!

365
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,235
Like bats!

366
00:58:57,618 --> 00:59:00,287
You'll spend the night
in this casket, which is my bed.

367
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:03,499
At dawn, your pursuers will be gone,
and you can leave.

368
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:17,721
But be careful.
In the day I sleep.

369
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:19,473
Do not wake me.

370
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,527
The sun is rising

371
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:16,405
Quick, we must leave here.

372
01:01:10,793 --> 01:01:12,294
I'm thirsty.

373
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,880
Oh, I'm so thirsty.

374
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:17,091
You think we could drink each other?

375
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:20,469
Yes, Louise. Yes.

376
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:22,846
Quick, it's daylight.

377
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,640
We have to get home.

378
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:01,653
Good morning.

379
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,867
May I help you?

380
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,869
We'd like some alcohol, please.

381
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:11,455
Something strong.
It's a gift.

382
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,373
Do we have enough money?

383
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:20,881
With this I can sell you
a bottle of brandy.

384
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,716
That's good. Thank you.

385
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,762
Take it.

386
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,976
There is your change.

387
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,186
Thank you, sir.

388
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,438
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

389
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,550
You think it's good?

390
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,553
You have to taste it to know.

391
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,392
Someone there?

392
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,478
Come out or <i>I'll</i> shoot!

393
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,414
Henriette!

394
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,625
Henriette, it's bad.

395
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:31,256
I'll drink your pain.

396
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,342
Henriette, tell me.

397
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:38,138
Why aren't we like everyone else?

398
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,391
Why are we the orphan vampires?

399
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:44,144
We and no one else.

400
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,980
I am you, and you are me.

401
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:48,273
You know that.

402
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,318
Tell me.

403
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,653
Tell me who we are.

404
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:57,991
Louise.

405
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,035
I beg you!

406
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,079
Don't die on me.

407
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:03,872
Not now!

408
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,627
Try to remember...

409
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,340
when we were Aztec goddesses.

410
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:16,343
Please.

411
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:24,726
Please.

412
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,854
I think I remember.

413
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:30,607
Yes, <i>I'll</i> tell you.

414
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,651
The story of the two goddesses.

415
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:38,698
You are Quetzalcoatl,
the feathered serpent.

416
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:39,908
And l -

417
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:42,994
l am -

418
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:47,040
You are Murciéloago, the bat goddess.

419
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,338
Dear God, what can I do?

420
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,257
You have to regain your strength.

421
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:01,680
Don't leave me.

422
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:05,308
Henriette, don't leave me alone.

423
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,083
Drink of life, little bat-girl,

424
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:32,836
and <i>I'll</i> tell you
the stories of my memories -

425
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:37,424
of the past times
when we had our magnificence.

426
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,812
The year is 1488.

427
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:53,398
There were four days

428
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:57,944
of inauguration festivities taking place
at the Great Temple of Mexico.

429
01:09:58,445 --> 01:10:02,282
Montezuma's chosen successor,
the Emperor Ahuitzotl himself,

430
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:06,870
standing at the top of the pyramid,
will perform the first sacrifices.

431
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,914
The priests surround him.

432
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:12,500
For many moons,
the people have been excited.

433
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:14,753
The city is decorated.

434
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:18,465
There is nothing but song,
dance and rejoicing.

435
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:22,302
Some prophets predict that,
contrary to the Aztec calendar,

436
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:26,389
the return of Quetzalcoatl,
which should have been in 1467,

437
01:10:26,473 --> 01:10:29,476
could take place during
the preparation of these events.

438
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:35,398
Over there, I can see the long,
unending line of waiting victims.

439
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:38,443
There is a rumor that there will be
a hundred thousand.

440
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:42,656
These four days will remain
the most formidable voluntary holocaust

441
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,532
in the history of the world.

442
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:50,664
In fact, it's a ritual communion
of flesh and blood.

443
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,749
Blood which will run
without interruption,

444
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:56,836
flesh of sacrifices to be devoured
by the faithful at the foot of the pyramid.

445
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,839
There are at least
20,000 victims the first day.

446
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:07,973
When the thousand steps are entirely red,
then Quetzalcoatl can return.

447
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,978
My throat tightens from desire
and moving anguish.

448
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,438
The first captive is at the top.

449
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:18,942
The priests grab him,
lay him on the stone.

450
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,945
The emperor strikes him,
opening his chest.

451
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,823
He plunges his hands into the rib cage,

452
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:27,867
pulls out the heart and brandishes it.

453
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,494
It's still beating

454
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:32,872
above his head,
bedecked with multicolored feathers.

455
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:35,125
Everyone's in awe.

456
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,877
A huge cry rises from the crowd.

457
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:41,131
The emperor raises
the dripping trophy to his mouth,

458
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:44,592
bites, tears, rips it to shreds.

459
01:11:44,676 --> 01:11:48,638
The people raise frantic screams
to heaven at this spectacle.

460
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:52,142
But already, another man
is stretched on the stone.

461
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,853
The knife is raised, then lowered.

462
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,981
This time,
the priests rip out the beating heart

463
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:03,194
while servants topple over
the heartless body to replace it with another.

464
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:05,947
The hearts are thrown
a few flights down,

465
01:12:06,031 --> 01:12:09,784
where nobles and the privileged
grab and devour them.

466
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:13,079
The bodies are cast
to the bottom of the pyramid.

467
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:15,707
There, the people dismember them.

468
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,501
Women take the pieces,

469
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:23,715
and that night they are roasted
or boiled for the cannibalistic meal.

470
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:28,178
We begin to distinguish
the tiny red strands that,

471
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:31,473
drop by drop,
stain the highest steps of the temple.

472
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:37,520
Tonight, by sundown, they'll all be red.

473
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:38,897
All of them.

474
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,690
More than a thousand.

475
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:42,776
And at the end of the last day,

476
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:45,445
the staircase will be nothing
but a carpet of blood

477
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,697
running from the top to the bottom.

478
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:49,991
Carpet. A carpet flowing

479
01:12:50,075 --> 01:12:52,452
with a sickening odor
that's exciting at the same time.

480
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:53,828
I won!

481
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:55,705
I won!

482
01:12:55,789 --> 01:12:57,707
You're alive, Louise.

483
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,376
My blood saved you.

484
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:03,880
Henriette, don't cry!

485
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,467
Henriette, I love you.

486
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:11,679
Look, we're still alive!

487
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,057
Both of us!

488
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,683
Forever!

489
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,560
Do you hear, Henriette?

490
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:19,187
Alive forever!

491
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:23,650
We won't have a mishap.

492
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:26,236
Look, I'm alive.

493
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,364
Don't cry!

494
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,918
The blue light is leaving.

495
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,962
The whole night's passed.

496
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:48,842
The day's coming
and taking away my sight.

497
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:52,804
Louise, I can't see you anymore.

498
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:08,445
- He's sleeping.
- We must get rid of him.

499
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:11,573
- Regain our freedom.
- He's a constant danger for us.

500
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:15,702
- If he found out -
- It'd be terrible. He might kill us.

501
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,370
Come, let us have a drink.

502
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:19,372
<i>It'll</i> help us find a solution.

503
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:38,516
We could slice him
with the saber in the living room.

504
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,560
He's big, you know.

505
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:46,524
It'd be better to smother him
with a pillow while he's sleeping.

506
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:48,443
We're not strong enough.

507
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:51,279
We need a way that's easy and quick.

508
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,328
We're so stupid!

509
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:01,915
We only have to bite him
and suck his blood until he dies!

510
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,917
And is he going to let us?

511
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:10,507
Sabotage his car.

512
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,967
Push it into the Seine.

513
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:29,359
Not as good as blood.

514
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,152
But it's stronger.

515
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:35,448
We'll find a solution.

516
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:12,819
Look at this.

517
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,034
It's beautiful!

518
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,829
The blood running on the walls.

519
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,122
And on the ground.

520
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,456
Blood everywhere!

521
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,041
It's magnificent!

522
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:28,585
Superb!

523
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:30,295
It makes me thirsty.

524
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:31,713
Very thirsty.

525
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:34,257
Oh, the blood is so red!

526
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,301
And how it must run.

527
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:39,220
It's our life
that's painted on these pages.

528
01:16:39,304 --> 01:16:40,972
Our JOY-

529
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:43,057
Our gluttony.

530
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:48,354
I'm happy to observe
that your sight's improved

531
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:53,276
so much that you're able to look at a book
at nearly 2:00 in the morning.

532
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:05,079
Oh, Father, what a pity
you discovered our secret now.

533
01:17:05,163 --> 01:17:09,000
We were guarding it jealously
until your birthday on the weekend.

534
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,628
It's really extraordinary what's happened.

535
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:14,297
We began to distinguish
the shape of things,

536
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,423
bit by bit.

537
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,425
Then we knew our sight was returning.

538
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:19,344
At first we were so afraid

539
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,429
our blindness would return.

540
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:30,063
My children.

541
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:33,399
- My poor children.
- It's not true sight yet.

542
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:34,984
Just a blur.

543
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:37,153
But tonight, we were so anxious,

544
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:39,072
we came downstairs to see a book.

545
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:41,199
It's like a miracle, Father!

546
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:43,701
I could read! You understand?

547
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:46,371
And both of us.
It's the same for both of us.

548
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:49,165
We wanted to be certain
before we told you.

549
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,834
We were going to wait
until your birthday.

550
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:56,422
If the miracle persisted on that day,

551
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:58,257
we would have read a poem for you

552
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:01,511
that we've been secretly composing
by ourselves since last Thursday, as a gift.

553
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:05,181
A good breakfast
will help us put things right.

554
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,308
Afterwards, <i>I'll</i> examine your eyes.

555
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,312
How could I have doubted you?

556
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:02,864
Father, may I have
some of the jam in the cupboard?

557
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:04,824
Of course, my dear.

558
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:15,835
You found the jam, my sweet angel?

559
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:44,697
Go on.

560
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,247
He won't be able to get up.

561
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:39,627
If no organs were cut, he could still live
a long time with the knife stuck in him.

562
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:42,922
I hit him hard.
He hasn't got much longer.

563
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,436
I don't hear anything.

564
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:00,690
Maybe he's dead.

565
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:11,450
He won't bother us anymore
with his damned pity!

566
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,452
There's no pity for vampire orphans.

567
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:15,746
They'll love us for what we are,
or they'll crush us!

568
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:17,540
We'll slit their throats.

569
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,710
Let's get out of here now.
We'll set a fire before leaving.

570
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,628
They'll only find one burned body.

571
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:24,714
They'll say it was a robbery.

572
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,549
We were scared and ran away.

573
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,634
We saw nothing because we're blind!

574
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:49,405
Go to bed, Sister Martha.
You did your rounds, and it's late.

575
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,990
And yourself, Mother?

576
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:52,825
Me?

577
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:55,703
I must pray more.

578
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:59,916
I think I can guess, if I may,
the object of your prayers.

579
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:01,083
Really?

580
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,544
And what do you think it is,
Sister Martha?

581
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:06,797
You are asking, as I do each night,

582
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:11,594
for the joy of once more
seeing our little dears.

583
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:14,680
Your heart has guessed right.

584
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:17,183
I miss our two little lambs.

585
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:23,981
But something tells me
we'll see them again.

586
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:25,816
You and I, Sister Martha.

587
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:28,486
You and I will both
see them again soon.

588
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:30,321
May God hear you.

589
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:27,003
What do we do now?

590
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,005
<i>It'll</i> be day soon.

591
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:33,175
We'll hide in a grave until tomorrow night
and then go back to the orphanage.

592
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:35,720
- Do you think our room is still empty?
- Of course!

593
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:38,389
Our dear mother superior
wouldn't give it to anyone.

594
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,766
In any case, Sister Martha
wouldn't let her do it.

595
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:42,435
Hush.

596
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,520
Someone's coming!

597
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:47,398
- Someone whose throat we can slit?
- Or drink.

598
01:23:48,733 --> 01:23:51,360
- A party girl who's drunk?
- Maybe.

599
01:23:51,444 --> 01:23:53,404
I think it's something else.

600
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,323
She's an outcast.

601
01:23:56,407 --> 01:23:59,201
A creature of the night
like you and me.

602
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:01,537
- We're unique! Kill her!
- Wait.

603
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,664
We must know.

604
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:06,542
We're the vampire orphan girls,
and we're in our home.

605
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,086
What are you doing here?
Are you one of us?

606
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,130
I am what I am.

607
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:16,385
I come and go
in places like this cemetery.

608
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:20,222
My wanderings are unending.

609
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,059
I seek nourishment.

610
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:26,395
You -
You drink the blood of humans,

611
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:27,480
but I,

612
01:24:28,606 --> 01:24:33,652
the beast, the vulture,

613
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:35,696
the hyena that I am,

614
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:38,532
I feed on cadavers,
dead of dead flesh.

615
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:39,617
A ghoul!

616
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,828
We live off the living.
She eats the dead.

617
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,706
Go, poor, unhappy girls.

618
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,751
The dawn's coming.

619
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:52,922
My nourishment - I get it from the earth.

620
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:55,549
I don't like to be seen.

621
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,343
Go away!

622
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:13,400
Good-bye, my little vampires.

623
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:19,073
When you come back out at dusk,
I won't be here.

624
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:23,786
The ghoul never comes
to the same place more than once.

625
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:29,041
But this earth - I feel it!

626
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,588
I can feel that I shall
have my fill of new cadavers.

627
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:58,154
<i>Another day coming to an end,</i>

628
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,157
<i>and the ritual begins again.</i>

629
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,325
<i>Turn out the lights,</i>

630
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,953
<i>then return to my room and pray.</i>

631
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:10,749
<i>Around midnight, make my rounds
in this silent orphanage.</i>

632
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:14,378
<i>Then finally, go to bed.</i>

633
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:16,755
<i>Sleep.</i>

634
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:19,300
<i>Perhaps dream.</i>

635
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:24,138
<i>Before, my last rounds
were for my little angels.</i>

636
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,433
<i>I didn't have to turn out the lights.</i>

637
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:32,396
<i>Only wish them a good night
and close the door.</i>

638
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:37,860
<i>Now I walk by their empty room,</i>

639
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:40,946
<i>and I lose faith
in ever seeing them again.</i>

640
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:45,743
<i>My little blind girls,
so sweet, so pretty.</i>

641
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,580
<i>What a sad life.</i>

642
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,666
We need a place to sleep tonight.

643
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:08,409
Sleep well, little Virginia.

644
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:11,120
I'm going to the chapel
to pray for you to get well.

645
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,705
God bless you.

646
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:38,439
A new girl!

647
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:41,150
Poor little thing. She's sick.

648
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:48,282
- What's your name?
- Virginia.

649
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:51,994
- Virginia what?
- Just Virginia. I was an orphan child.

650
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:55,873
Really! We're the two blind orphan girls,
and we're alone too.

651
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:58,042
But you two aren't blind.

652
01:28:58,125 --> 01:29:00,669
- Because it's nighttime.
- Why'd you come to see me?

653
01:29:00,753 --> 01:29:02,921
You know, we're thirsty.

654
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:04,923
Well, there's water on the table there.

655
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:07,176
We don't drink water.

656
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:10,929
You'll understand.

657
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,060
That can't be!

658
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:17,936
You just can't be!

659
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,439
Of course not. We don't exist.

660
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:22,441
You are dreaming. That's all.

661
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:26,820
- She looks good, doesn't she?
- Let me drink first.

662
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:32,201
You will be drunk by Aztec goddesses,
who don't exist, naturally.

663
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:35,996
It's a cult sacrifice.

664
01:29:36,747 --> 01:29:38,832
I'm an offering to the gods.

665
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:41,919
That's it!

666
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:43,796
She's so dumb.

667
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:46,215
I find her innocence touching.

668
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:48,050
She believes everything we say.

669
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:50,469
And she's abandoned,
like you and me.

670
01:29:50,803 --> 01:29:53,555
Come on. If we start feeling mercy,
there'll be no end to it.

671
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:55,140
And we'll die.

672
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:57,851
Do you think the others
will feel sorry for us?

673
01:30:11,824 --> 01:30:14,284
Sneaking out to smoke,
the little brats.

674
01:30:14,368 --> 01:30:16,912
They'll certainly taste better
than a little sick girl.

675
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:20,666
- You saw nothing.
- Heard nothing.

676
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:23,127
- It was a dream.
- We do not exist.

677
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:04,793
- Are you two smoking?
- If the sister finds out -

678
01:31:04,877 --> 01:31:07,045
- Or Mother Superior.
- Don't tell!

679
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:08,630
Here, have a drag!

680
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,108
You're new?

681
01:31:28,192 --> 01:31:30,402
- I haven't seen you before.
- What are your names?

682
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:32,738
- Henriette.
- I'm Louise.

683
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,824
What's that big book
you've got under your arm?

684
01:31:35,908 --> 01:31:39,953
- It's the story of us two.
- Yes, we're magicians.

685
01:31:40,037 --> 01:31:42,164
Yeah, right!
What kind of magicians?

686
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,082
Like in this book.

687
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:46,627
Here.

688
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:48,962
Look

689
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:51,840
The girl flying through the hoop -
that's me.

690
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:53,967
Yes. And here,

691
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,180
Wanda the goddess of mystery,
rising from the flames - that's me.

692
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:01,183
You don't believe us?

693
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:03,310
And if I said we're also Aztec goddesses?

694
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:05,812
Don't you have a good imagination!

695
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:07,856
Yes, it's rare at this orphanage.

696
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,360
We've got a bottle
stashed in this school bag.

697
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:12,903
You want to drink?

698
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,656
Yes, that's a good idea.

699
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:17,866
I agree.

700
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,952
We're thirsty.

701
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:33,799
<i>Dear God, let this night
be like any other,</i>

702
01:32:34,299 --> 01:32:37,177
<i>with nothing to disturb my rounds,</i>

703
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:40,556
<i>and that my orphan girls
sleep peacefully.</i>

704
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:51,942
It's the blind girls' room.
It's been empty since they left.

705
01:33:00,826 --> 01:33:02,786
But it's not possible.

706
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:07,457
I smell cigarettes.

707
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:10,794
I hear voices.

708
01:33:12,004 --> 01:33:14,006
Something is going on.

709
01:33:16,383 --> 01:33:18,677
<i>I'll</i> go warn Mother Superior.

710
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:28,687
Mother!

711
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:31,398
Sister Martha.
What time is it?

712
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:34,610
It's almost midnight.
It's room 36.

713
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:36,528
Room 36 is empty.

714
01:33:36,612 --> 01:33:38,280
No, they've returned.

715
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:39,990
But of whom do you speak?

716
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:43,827
Of our dear little angels - or their ghosts!

717
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:46,371
You're being foolish, Sister Martha.

718
01:33:46,455 --> 01:33:51,293
You know very well that the two girls
are now the children of Dr. Dennery.

719
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:54,921
But no, I think
they're smoking in the laundry.

720
01:33:55,714 --> 01:33:57,382
All right, <i>I'll</i> go.

721
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,398
- I hear nothing.
- I tell you there was a noise.

722
01:34:13,482 --> 01:34:15,400
Well, go in.

723
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:42,594
My God.

724
01:34:43,637 --> 01:34:45,681
It's horrible.

725
01:34:45,764 --> 01:34:47,933
We must call the police.

726
01:35:13,542 --> 01:35:16,211
Now they're going to
end up getting us.

727
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:19,047
Not alive. I don't want them
to take us alive!

728
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:20,632
Don't be afraid.

729
01:35:20,716 --> 01:35:22,759
We're the two vampire orphan girls.

730
01:35:22,843 --> 01:35:24,469
They won't get us.

731
01:35:25,887 --> 01:35:27,723
- Henriette.
- Yes?

732
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:29,266
Who are we?

733
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:32,060
I mean, for real.

734
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:33,895
We're two Aztec goddesses.

735
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:37,315
- There are no more Aztecs.
- Well, then, we're -

736
01:35:38,483 --> 01:35:39,651
I don't know.

737
01:35:39,735 --> 01:35:41,319
Perhaps nothing.

738
01:35:41,403 --> 01:35:43,113
Perhaps we're nothing.

739
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:45,407
In any case, we'll soon disappear.

740
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:47,075
You think so?

741
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:49,911
Yes, they saw us.

742
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:52,664
They'll chase us sooner or later.

743
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:21,651
It's you they're looking for, is that it?

744
01:36:23,153 --> 01:36:24,863
You don't look bad.

745
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:29,868
- They say that you bite -
- We can, if we want.

746
01:36:30,786 --> 01:36:32,788
Will you bite me if I come closer?

747
01:36:37,459 --> 01:36:39,127
No, not you.

748
01:36:39,211 --> 01:36:41,421
You didn't call for help
when you saw us.

749
01:36:42,589 --> 01:36:44,174
My name's Nicole.

750
01:36:44,257 --> 01:36:46,343
Why do you have white canes
like blind people?

751
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:49,137
We like to twirl them
like Charlie Chaplin in the movies.

752
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:51,807
We're not really blind.
We see at night.

753
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:53,391
At night only.

754
01:36:53,475 --> 01:36:55,477
Why is everyone looking for you?

755
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,437
It's on the radio too.

756
01:36:57,521 --> 01:36:59,439
We bit a few people.

757
01:36:59,523 --> 01:37:02,275
But then, we're not like others.

758
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:05,904
Well, who are you?

759
01:37:08,406 --> 01:37:09,950
We are us!

760
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:12,828
- How do you bite?
- You see these teeth, here?

761
01:37:12,911 --> 01:37:15,539
They grow by themselves,
at certain times.

762
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:21,920
- And after?
- They go back.

763
01:37:26,508 --> 01:37:28,969
But then, who are you?

764
01:37:29,052 --> 01:37:30,887
We're Aztec goddesses.

765
01:37:30,971 --> 01:37:32,514
You are real gods?

766
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,891
All gods are real,
because they are imaginary.

767
01:37:34,975 --> 01:37:38,061
You're in a sacred book,
like the gods are?

768
01:37:38,144 --> 01:37:39,938
Take it.

769
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:41,857
It's our sacred book.

770
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:44,359
You'll see us as Indians
with feathered headdresses.

771
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:47,779
Also, as beheaded red devils
holding our heads by the hair.

772
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:49,865
And Oriental dancers!

773
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:53,702
You'll see the Dance of the Seven Veils,
the Arab lady levitating,

774
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:55,954
the Chinese lady
crucified with daggers!

775
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:58,707
The pretty blonde with wild eyes
in a straitjacket.

776
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,835
Houdini's assistant diving with him
in a tank full of water.

777
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:06,256
Duga the magician, who's wearing
only pearls and dances in the flames.

778
01:38:06,339 --> 01:38:08,258
The girl in the costume, sawed in half!

779
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:09,759
All this is us!

780
01:38:09,843 --> 01:38:12,220
One woman locked up with a tiger,
one put to sleep,

781
01:38:12,304 --> 01:38:14,764
one decapitated, one quartered
and one in flames.

782
01:38:14,848 --> 01:38:17,809
One stepped on by an elephant -
that's us!

783
01:38:17,893 --> 01:38:22,063
All the magical girls - they are Henriette
and Louise, the Aztec goddesses.

784
01:38:26,985 --> 01:38:30,322
Oh, the game is over.

785
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:35,702
We have to go back to the cemetery.

786
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:38,330
I know a shortcut you can take.

787
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:40,081
Then guide us!

788
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:42,834
Daylight is coming.
Our sight is leaving.

789
01:39:02,896 --> 01:39:05,607
Look. it's the two girls from the cemetery.

790
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,609
Quick, get me the gun.

791
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:46,564
Henriette! Henriette!

792
01:39:49,067 --> 01:39:51,528
She's not going to die
or anything, right, Louise?

793
01:39:51,611 --> 01:39:53,738
She's not dying, right?

794
01:39:57,075 --> 01:40:01,663
Do you know why the Aztec religion
was so different than any other?

795
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,290
I don't know.

796
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:07,669
Their gods are mortal.

797
01:40:10,005 --> 01:40:12,257
But you'll both come back, right?

798
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:14,843
You'll return?

799
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:18,096
So I can be part of your game.

800
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:21,307
Come, say you'll return...

801
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:24,602
so I can play with you!

802
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:29,399
It's we who'll play with you, Nicole.
You are alive.

803
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:32,110
We are asleep.

804
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:34,863
You're our dream.

805
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:40,452
The dead dream about the living,
not the reverse.

806
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:43,788
Don't go away. Stay!

807
01:40:56,509 --> 01:40:58,470
We are sublime disorder.

808
01:40:59,429 --> 01:41:01,389
We're from before their god.

809
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:07,353
They made him say “Let there be light”
to cut our night in half.

810
01:41:08,313 --> 01:41:10,356
But their order is chaos.

811
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:12,358
Our disorder is mad poetry.

812
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:15,653
Our existence awakens,

813
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,406
and our night is clarity.

814
01:41:20,784 --> 01:41:25,580
The two orphan girls roar alone
in the night, like flames.

815
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:28,917
And so, no one can touch them.

816
01:41:31,086 --> 01:41:33,671
All others are puppets for our game!

817
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:39,052
Henriette, nothing's real.

818
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:41,513
Don't go!

819
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:48,645
We will return, Louise.

820
01:41:51,231 --> 01:41:54,651
We will be the wind and the rain.

821
01:41:56,528 --> 01:41:59,739
We will be the elements
that men fear the most.

822
01:42:01,241 --> 01:42:04,536
The thunder, the tempest.

823
01:42:06,496 --> 01:42:08,540
But our bodies -

824
01:42:09,374 --> 01:42:11,376
We can't let them find us.

825
01:42:13,128 --> 01:42:14,462
Louise.

826
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:20,218
Do you see a hole to hide in?

827
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:28,893
Yes, they won't find us.

828
01:42:32,856 --> 01:42:34,065
Here.

829
01:42:34,858 --> 01:42:36,568
We're in there.

830
01:42:37,402 --> 01:42:39,237
You won't forget us.

831
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:45,577
Can't I come with you?

832
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:48,621
No, don't watch us.

833
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:52,625
Quick, they're coming!

834
01:43:09,601 --> 01:43:10,685
Louise!

835
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:14,189
Where are you?

836
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:18,776
I'm blind!

837
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:25,491
- I'm dying!
- No!

838
01:43:26,034 --> 01:43:29,454
I beg you, help me to go.

839
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,000
I can't!

840
01:43:35,793 --> 01:43:36,794
Look

841
01:43:38,046 --> 01:43:39,797
it's very easy.

842
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:40,168
TWO ORPHAN VAMPIRES
