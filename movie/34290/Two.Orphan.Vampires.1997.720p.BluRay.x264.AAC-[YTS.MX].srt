TWO ORPHAN VAMPIRES

4
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:10,866
GLYCINES ORPHANAGE

5
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:20,371
GLYCINES ORPHANAGE

6
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,456
FOUNDED BY THE ABBESS OF SAINT-AUBIN

7
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:56,282
You say they've been blind since birth?

8
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,367
I don't think so.

9
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:00,953
They say that they could see
as little girls.

10
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:03,497
Something inexplicable happened.

11
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:06,000
They said that the colors
just disappeared one day.

12
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:08,836
Colors?
They could no longer distinguish colors?

13
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,129
That's right.

14
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,006
They saw in black and white.

15
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,258
That's impossible.

16
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:16,343
Has anyone examined them before me?

17
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:17,845
But of course.

18
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,848
Their blindness is inexplicable.

19
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:23,809
But who are they?

20
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:25,269
We don't know.

21
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:28,230
They are abandoned children.
We know nothing of―

22
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,524
Here they come.

23
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:56,801
This is Dr. Dennery, my children.

24
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,969
He is a respected eye specialist.

25
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:01,055
The best perhaps.

26
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:03,849
Look at me.

27
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:06,685
Open your eyes wide.

28
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,322
- What is it?
- What are you doing?

29
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:19,907
You're moving too fast!

30
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:21,659
I'm scared.

31
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:28,499
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
I am here to help.

32
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:52,273
You're right. They can't see.

33
00:05:58,113 --> 00:06:01,365
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

34
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,701
They're our little blind angels, you know.

35
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:05,619
We try to protect them.

36
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:11,166
Sister Martha
even neglects the other orphans a bit.

37
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,836
I should scold you, Sister Martha.

38
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,715
We all hope that one day,
a man of means ―

39
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:20,259
a man from a good family ―
will adopt them.

40
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:22,595
A man of science, for example.

41
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:26,181
A doctor who could look after them
and nurse them

42
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:27,808
and maybe one day ―

43
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:29,351
With God's help.

44
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:30,686
Cure them.

45
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,898
A cure?
That would be marvelous!

46
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:35,816
We would be so happy.

47
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:39,111
Oh, that is impossible.

48
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:41,780
It is God's will
that we see nothing at all.

49
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:43,741
We must accept our fate.

50
00:07:07,807 --> 00:07:09,600
Good night, dear.

51
00:07:16,691 --> 00:07:18,025
Good night.

52
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:33,082
Good night, children.

53
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:43,258
Good night.

54
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:11,161
Perhaps you'll soon have
a wonderful surprise.

55
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,496
But hush.

56
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,582
God's will is a mystery.

57
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:19,086
Good night, little angels.

58
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:28,804
Dear Lord, I beg of you,

59
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:33,392
make it so that the good Dr. Dennery
adopts our little martyrs.

60
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,061
They are so dear,

61
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:38,022
so patient,

62
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:41,775
so innocent, so gentle.

63
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:14,016
How good it is to inhale our daytime.

64
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,684
To see, finally.

65
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:18,145
- See how clear the night is?
- Yes, I see.

66
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:20,522
I see!

67
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,733
The deserted countryside
beneath the moon.

68
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:24,568
And over there, in the cemetery,

69
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:27,154
that poor dog
searching among the graves.

70
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:29,615
A stray animal, abandoned.

71
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:33,368
- Shall we join him?
- Sure! Everyone is sleeping.

72
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,621
Sister Martha will be
making her rounds at 2:00.

73
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:38,916
We'll be back before then.

74
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:10,317
We came from under there.

75
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:13,028
Do you think we're dead or alive?

76
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:16,240
We're both.

77
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:19,243
And the memories?
Do you remember?

78
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,827
I mean before.

79
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:23,163
What we were before now.

80
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:25,707
A bit.

81
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:29,670
Images, with no beginning or end.

82
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:33,340
But I know that we both existed,
as we are now.

83
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:40,764
I believe that, before, we had a mishap,
and we died.

84
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:43,892
And we returned, as always.

85
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:46,561
The others ―
the other deaths from before ―

86
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,939
each time, we had a mishap.

87
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,983
Do you remember?

88
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:54,903
The two orphans we were,
and who died,

89
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:58,657
I feel like I see them, I hear them.

90
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:00,951
They're the ones who remember us.

91
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,537
Isn't that why we return each time?

92
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:05,330
Of course!

93
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:08,333
Others kill us. They kill us violently.

94
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:09,918
But we return.

95
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:17,217
Henriette, I don't believe
that we're only a dream.

96
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:20,721
Two orphans who incarnate into reality.

97
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:26,560
They can't understand that,
all those who hunt us down.

98
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:28,854
If they knew ―

99
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,606
You know, Henriette,
if they knew that we're a dream,

100
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,401
they would love and protect us.

101
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:38,030
Because, that way,
they could dream about us.

102
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:41,783
That's not how it happens.

103
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,328
They find us out,

104
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:46,580
we have a mishap,

105
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:48,623
we are killed

106
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:51,084
and then we return.

107
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,587
- It's like a game?
- A strange game.

108
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:55,922
But who decides the rules of the game?

109
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:57,507
No one.

110
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:00,344
Everything simply is. That's all.

111
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:02,846
Nobody is responsible.

112
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:05,974
It's like that.

113
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,935
It’s just the way it is.

114
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:16,276
Why are you crying?

115
00:14:18,613 --> 00:14:21,281
I'm afraid that
we're going to be killed again.

116
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:25,744
So we will return again!

117
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:28,872
But what if we didn't come back?

118
00:14:28,956 --> 00:14:33,418
What if one day things went wrong
and we stayed dead forever?

119
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,421
Oh, well,
if such a thing happened,

120
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:40,133
they would dream of the two orphan girls
who could be reborn.

121
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:46,598
You hear it?

122
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:49,518
Right there.

123
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,814
There's a house with an open window.

124
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,942
Someone is listening to music.

125
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,152
You hear it?

126
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:09,913
If they see us,
they'll think we're ghosts!

127
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:11,623
But we <i>are</i> ghosts!

128
00:15:44,365 --> 00:15:45,740
Come, come.

129
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,201
Yes, good dog.

130
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:58,837
I remember.

131
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,048
It was far away.

132
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:06,136
There was a bridge, I think.

133
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,179
Yes.

134
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:09,097
We were on a bridge.

135
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:11,475
The night was blue, like all our nights.

136
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,894
We weren't blind
because we could see blue.

137
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:16,688
<i>It was the hour of the hunt.</i>

138
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:58,530
What happened after that?

139
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:00,573
We had a mishap.

140
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,492
But before?

141
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:04,619
Before we died?

142
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:06,746
What then?

143
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:12,168
We drank and quenched our thirst.

144
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:29,310
Come, let's go.

145
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:31,813
There's no more music,

146
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:34,941
and we're alive in today,
not dead in yesterday.

147
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:36,359
You're right.

148
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:39,237
Sister Martha will
soon be making rounds.

149
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:44,158
Besides, in a little while,
we'll have forgotten our last death.

150
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:45,910
Come.

151
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:51,207
We are alive, and all the others,
it is they who are dead.

152
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:17,025
And you ― do you remember anything?

153
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,819
Anything from before?

154
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:26,492
Close your eyes.

155
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,746
Do you see?

156
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,539
Yes.

157
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:35,043
Trains with voyagers,
with merchandise.

158
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:39,756
From here to infinity.

159
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,968
Yes, I remember as well.

160
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:46,137
I can see them too.

161
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:48,348
We are wanderers,

162
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:52,060
and our roamings are meetings
with creatures that are as strange as we are.

163
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:55,605
It was daytime, and we were blind.

164
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:57,774
We came from away, far away.

165
00:23:57,858 --> 00:23:59,442
That's it.

166
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:01,152
Who was chasing us?

167
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:03,196
I've forgotten.

168
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:06,658
Then we found ourselves there.

169
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:04,799
Someone's there.

170
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:06,884
Who are you?

171
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:08,970
You don't speak?

172
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,555
Are you hiding too?

173
00:25:11,265 --> 00:25:13,474
I'm from nowhere and everywhere.

174
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:18,896
If I haunt this train station,
it's because it is silent and solitary.

175
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,067
You know, I'm crazy.
Everyone says so.

176
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:26,154
Both of you also look a little crazy.

177
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,740
I was in one of their clinics,

178
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:30,783
but then I escaped.

179
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:33,619
You're blind, huh?

180
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:35,288
Not all the time.

181
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:36,998
Nighttime's coming.

182
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:38,541
We will see!

183
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,752
At night we see blue.

184
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,542
You think you see me now.

185
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:24,712
You see the madwoman
of the train station.

186
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:28,841
My reality is within.

187
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:32,386
They say I'm crazy
because I'm a she-wolf.

188
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:34,597
Do you bite too?

189
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:36,474
Do you transform into a werewolf?

190
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,311
An ordinary she-wolf, alone.

191
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:42,855
I'm so alone.

192
00:26:43,565 --> 00:26:46,400
When there's a full moon,
the animal in me comes out.

193
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:50,613
People don't believe.
That's why they lock me up.

194
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:54,242
But the dogs know. They feel it.

195
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:58,496
They sniff the wolf,
their enemy, and they attack me.

196
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,542
Often, my stare
keeps them at a distance.

197
00:27:03,085 --> 00:27:05,837
But sometimes
they scratch me with their claws.

198
00:27:05,921 --> 00:27:07,713
That's horrible.

199
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:09,841
What do you do to escape them?

200
00:27:13,971 --> 00:27:15,972
When there's one or two,
I slit their throats,

201
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:18,808
strangle them, break their backs.

202
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:21,310
But if there is a pack,

203
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:23,813
I find refuge in some place like this,

204
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:25,565
where they won't come.

205
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:29,777
You don't believe me. You neither.

206
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:32,405
You think I'm crazy.

207
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:35,116
Look what they did to me!

208
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:38,911
Do you think dogs
would do this normally?

209
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:40,496
No.

210
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,039
But to a she-wolf,

211
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:43,875
they're wild dogs.

212
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,512
See the full moon.

213
00:27:57,764 --> 00:28:01,517
Listen now, to the she-wolf.

214
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:03,686
You'll never forget her.

215
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,273
Her cry of anguish and agony
will resound forever in your heads.

216
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,961
Dogs!

217
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:31,964
They are ―

218
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,383
I hear them.

219
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:36,427
It's me they want!

220
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:38,888
My scent attracts them.

221
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,230
We'll have to find
a new book for tomorrow.

222
00:31:34,314 --> 00:31:36,899
I took one from
the mother superior's library.

223
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:39,026
- What is it?
- <i>History of the Incas.</i>

224
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:41,278
There are the serpent and bat gods.

225
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:42,947
Those gods ― are they us?

226
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,241
Yes, us. You'll see.

227
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:46,951
There are human sacrifices.

228
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,994
People sacrifice themselves.

229
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,414
They let their throats be slit
just to please us.

230
00:31:51,498 --> 00:31:54,250
- That would be so nice!
- Yes, it would.

231
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:56,001
Let's go to sleep.

232
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,881
Be happy, my children.

233
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:48,971
With God's love and the respect of
your protector, our good Dr. Dennery.

234
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:51,056
He'll be your father now.

235
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,059
Ah, we'll miss you.

236
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:56,812
It's sad to see our angels leave.

237
00:32:56,897 --> 00:32:58,814
We love them so much.

238
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:00,691
They'll be happy with me.

239
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:01,984
And who knows?

240
00:33:02,068 --> 00:33:07,907
One day I may discover the secret
of their mysterious loss of sight.

241
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:10,951
Oh, father, you've given us so much.

242
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:14,955
We're happy just to be with you.

243
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,125
Come, my children.
Paris is waiting.

244
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:41,273
Careful.

245
00:34:12,347 --> 00:34:14,098
And here's the entrance.

246
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:36,912
Here's the living room.

247
00:34:36,997 --> 00:34:42,209
Keep in mind there are three armchairs,
a couch and a coffee table.

248
00:34:42,836 --> 00:34:46,338
You'll learn where each piece
of furniture is placed.

249
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:10,362
I'll leave you to discover your room.

250
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,763
I'll go to bed early.

251
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:42,603
In the morning, I'll have an opportunity
to show you where everything is.

252
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:47,900
Good night, my children.

253
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:50,069
Good night, Doctor.

254
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:53,614
You'll have to get used to
calling me '‘father.''

255
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:56,075
But that'll come.

256
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:18,073
Our day, for us, is blue.

257
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:20,701
The light, for us, is black.

258
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:22,911
The other people's sun
has made us blind.

259
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:25,914
- But when it is hidden ―
- Our dream begins.

260
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:30,377
- They'll never know.
- The two blind orphans can see at night.

261
00:37:30,462 --> 00:37:33,672
- Like the cats.
- Like the tigers. Like the beasts.

262
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:38,594
- Shall we walk?
- He sleeps like a rock.

263
00:37:38,678 --> 00:37:42,055
- I'm hungry.
- We'll go find one of our true homes.

264
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,183
I can feel one close by.

265
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:55,981
Take out those fake teeth.

266
00:39:56,482 --> 00:39:58,483
You are just little carnival brats.

267
00:40:32,185 --> 00:40:34,937
- You ate some?
- A big bite, yes.

268
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:37,439
You're beautiful with her blood.

269
00:40:37,941 --> 00:40:41,109
It's good to be sticky from
the lifeblood of this woman.

270
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,964
Let's go in before he sees.

271
00:41:02,048 --> 00:41:03,298
Just wait.

272
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:04,508
A game.

273
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:06,343
Is it dangerous?

274
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:10,806
You dare me to go in front of the window,
naked, without him seeing me?

275
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,182
I dare!

276
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:29,741
I adore you.

277
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:32,744
Smear me with some blood.

278
00:42:10,283 --> 00:42:12,367
You smell of blood.

279
00:42:12,452 --> 00:42:14,244
You're the statue of a goddess.

280
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:47,903
I still have the taste of
that woman's blood in my mouth.

281
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:51,073
- We're all covered with it.
- What if the doctor sees?

282
00:43:05,922 --> 00:43:07,839
The blood on your body.

283
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:12,010
Ah, well, take it off.

284
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:18,266
You like it?

285
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:19,851
It's good?

286
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:23,271
My head's spinning.

287
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:27,526
It's as if I were drunk.

288
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:32,781
I have a surprise for you.

289
00:43:32,865 --> 00:43:34,074
What is it?

290
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:37,536
The book on the Aztecs.
I stole it from the mother superior's library.

291
00:44:03,312 --> 00:44:04,855
Look!

292
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:06,815
It's the goddess Bat Woman!

293
00:44:06,899 --> 00:44:09,401
It's you, Louise. I know it's you.

294
00:44:12,488 --> 00:44:14,865
‘‘This head of Murciéloago,
the Bat God,

295
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:18,577
was made in a holy land
and placed on top of a funeral urn.''

296
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:23,123
Oh, Henriette, it's really me.

297
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,501
And you? Where are you?

298
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:34,176
‘‘A picture of Quetzalcoatl emerging
from the mouth of a feathered serpent.''

299
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,511
You see, he has teeth like mine.

300
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:44,186
We're like goddesses
who march through time and space.

301
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,941
One day we'll be able to remember
the time when we were real goddesses.

302
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:54,112
Even if they are all false memories,
we'll remember them.

303
00:45:36,822 --> 00:45:38,490
Look at that.

304
00:45:38,574 --> 00:45:42,410
It's the good Dr. Dennery's
two blind orphan girls coming out of mass.

305
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:46,915
I was there. I saw the doctor
dipping their fingers in the font

306
00:45:46,999 --> 00:45:49,417
and guiding their hands
to make the sign of the cross.

307
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:52,921
Poor children, so deprived in life.

308
00:45:53,005 --> 00:45:55,924
And they're so sweet and pure.

309
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:58,969
They’re just like two sisters of baby Jesus.

310
00:46:15,278 --> 00:46:16,778
Four, five!

311
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,200
Double five!

312
00:46:28,374 --> 00:46:29,916
Five, four!

313
00:46:42,388 --> 00:46:43,888
Double four!

314
00:46:52,398 --> 00:46:53,398
Four, three!

315
00:46:53,482 --> 00:46:56,234
You're cheating.
I'm certain you're cheating.

316
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,819
No, check.

317
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:04,409
It seems to be three, two.

318
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:07,203
You're the cheater!
It's four and three.

319
00:47:11,584 --> 00:47:15,670
Children, tonight I'll be attending
a doctors' conference outside of the city.

320
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:18,423
I'll spend the night there
and return tomorrow.

321
00:47:18,924 --> 00:47:21,509
You both know the house well now.

322
00:47:21,594 --> 00:47:25,930
Do you mind staying alone,
or should someone come over?

323
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:27,766
Father, you can go.

324
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:31,436
- Don't worry. We'll be as good as gold.
- Nothing will happen to us.

325
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,521
Promise... you won't go out?

326
00:47:34,106 --> 00:47:37,609
- We'll stay in the house.
- We'll go to bed as soon as you leave.

327
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:41,112
Well, then I can leave reassured.

328
00:48:26,158 --> 00:48:27,826
Freedom!

329
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,994
Free for the whole night!

330
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:33,081
This time,
we're going on a big adventure!

331
00:48:33,165 --> 00:48:35,250
Forget that little cemetery!

332
00:48:35,334 --> 00:48:38,294
- We'll go to the biggest one.
- And even take the subway!

333
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:08,272
Finally, I see.

334
00:53:08,857 --> 00:53:11,234
- I see blue.
- Me too.

335
00:53:11,777 --> 00:53:13,528
I see perfectly.

336
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:18,199
It's the biggest house we've ever been in.

337
00:53:19,076 --> 00:53:21,285
A home with a garden to eternity.

338
00:53:22,413 --> 00:53:24,372
And all these statues.

339
00:53:24,456 --> 00:53:27,542
Of marble and bronze.

340
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:04,245
Look, they're not really blind.

341
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:06,998
- They're creatures from hell.
- I'll go after them!

342
00:54:29,438 --> 00:54:31,606
Look at that man
running after those girls.

343
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,191
Go help them.

344
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:12,814
You pervert. They're blind!

345
00:55:12,898 --> 00:55:15,399
Stop it, you idiot.
Look at your girlfriend over there!

346
00:55:28,997 --> 00:55:30,540
No!

347
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:40,049
- I can't run anymore.
- Me neither.

348
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:42,927
They're catching up.

349
00:55:43,428 --> 00:55:46,973
We can't let them take us alive. Never!

350
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,559
Let's try killing ourselves!

351
00:55:49,643 --> 00:55:52,270
Squeeze!
With all your might!

352
00:55:52,354 --> 00:55:54,105
It's impossible!

353
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:52,496
Come with me. You'll have security.

354
00:58:20,669 --> 00:58:22,712
Here, no one will find you.

355
00:58:22,796 --> 00:58:25,506
- Who are you?
- A vampire?

356
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,508
I am the midnight lady.

357
00:58:27,592 --> 00:58:30,386
I fly above the cemeteries
like a bird of the night.

358
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:33,139
Like a hawk, I swoop down on my prey.

359
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:35,850
My vampirical powers
are more accomplished than yours.

360
00:58:35,934 --> 00:58:37,435
I'll hide you tonight,

361
00:58:38,437 --> 00:58:41,689
but while I sleep tomorrow,
you must leave.

362
00:58:41,773 --> 00:58:44,108
The midnight lady is solitary.

363
00:58:44,192 --> 00:58:48,195
Her destiny is to pass over cemeteries
in her own company, alone.

364
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,448
Well, we're the vampire orphans.

365
00:58:50,532 --> 00:58:52,867
We can't fly in the sky,
but we see in the night!

366
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:54,452
- In blue!
- And we bite!

367
00:58:54,536 --> 00:58:56,245
Like bats!

368
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:07,298
You'll spend the night
in this casket, which is my bed.

369
00:59:07,382 --> 00:59:10,509
At dawn, your pursuers will be gone,
and you can leave.

370
00:59:21,146 --> 00:59:24,732
But be careful.
In the day I sleep.

371
00:59:24,816 --> 00:59:26,484
Do not wake me.

372
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:20,538
The sun is rising

373
01:00:20,622 --> 01:00:23,415
Quick, we must leave here.

374
01:01:17,804 --> 01:01:19,305
I'm thirsty.

375
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:21,891
Oh, I'm so thirsty.

376
01:01:21,975 --> 01:01:24,101
You think we could drink each other?

377
01:01:24,644 --> 01:01:27,479
Yes, Louise. Yes.

378
01:01:27,689 --> 01:01:29,857
Quick, it's daylight.

379
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:31,650
We have to get home.

380
01:03:07,205 --> 01:03:08,664
Good morning.

381
01:03:12,377 --> 01:03:13,877
May I help you?

382
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:15,879
We'd like some alcohol, please.

383
01:03:16,047 --> 01:03:18,465
Something strong.
It's a gift.

384
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,384
Do we have enough money?

385
01:03:25,765 --> 01:03:27,891
With this I can sell you
a bottle of brandy.

386
01:03:27,976 --> 01:03:29,727
That's good. Thank you.

387
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:33,772
Take it.

388
01:03:38,403 --> 01:03:39,987
There is your change.

389
01:03:40,071 --> 01:03:41,196
Thank you, sir.

390
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:43,449
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

391
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:11,560
You think it's good?

392
01:04:12,145 --> 01:04:14,563
You have to taste it to know.

393
01:06:23,902 --> 01:06:25,402
Someone there?

394
01:06:26,738 --> 01:06:28,489
Come out or I'll shoot!

395
01:07:27,966 --> 01:07:29,424
Henriette!

396
01:07:30,802 --> 01:07:32,636
Henriette, it's bad.

397
01:07:36,307 --> 01:07:38,267
I'll drink your pain.

398
01:07:38,977 --> 01:07:41,353
Henriette, tell me.

399
01:07:43,147 --> 01:07:45,148
Why aren't we like everyone else?

400
01:07:46,234 --> 01:07:48,402
Why are we the orphan vampires?

401
01:07:48,486 --> 01:07:51,154
We and no one else.

402
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:53,991
I am you, and you are me.

403
01:07:54,075 --> 01:07:55,284
You know that.

404
01:07:56,995 --> 01:07:58,328
Tell me.

405
01:07:58,997 --> 01:08:00,664
Tell me who we are.

406
01:08:04,002 --> 01:08:05,002
Louise.

407
01:08:05,545 --> 01:08:07,045
I beg you!

408
01:08:07,672 --> 01:08:09,089
Don't die on me.

409
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:10,882
Not now!

410
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:15,637
Try to remember...

411
01:08:18,016 --> 01:08:20,350
when we were Aztec goddesses.

412
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:23,353
Please.

413
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:31,737
Please.

414
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:34,865
I think I remember.

415
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:37,618
Yes, I'll tell you.

416
01:08:37,702 --> 01:08:39,661
The story of the two goddesses.

417
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:45,709
You are Quetzalcoatl,
the feathered serpent.

418
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:46,918
And I ―

419
01:08:48,963 --> 01:08:50,005
I am ―

420
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:54,051
You are Murciéloago, the bat goddess.

421
01:08:57,889 --> 01:09:00,349
Dear God, what can I do?

422
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:02,267
You have to regain your strength.

423
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,690
Don't leave me.

424
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:12,319
Henriette, don't leave me alone.

425
01:09:34,676 --> 01:09:37,094
Drink of life, little bat-girl,

426
01:09:37,428 --> 01:09:39,846
and I'll tell you
the stories of my memories ―

427
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:44,434
of the past times
when we had our magnificence.

428
01:09:55,238 --> 01:09:57,823
The year is 1488.

429
01:09:57,907 --> 01:10:00,409
There were four days

430
01:10:00,493 --> 01:10:04,955
of inauguration festivities taking place
at the Great Temple of Mexico.

431
01:10:05,456 --> 01:10:09,292
Montezuma's chosen successor,
the Emperor Ahuitzotl himself,

432
01:10:09,377 --> 01:10:13,880
standing at the top of the pyramid,
will perform the first sacrifices.

433
01:10:13,965 --> 01:10:15,924
The priests surround him.

434
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:19,511
For many moons,
the people have been excited.

435
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:21,763
The city is decorated.

436
01:10:21,848 --> 01:10:25,475
There is nothing but song,
dance and rejoicing.

437
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:29,312
Some prophets predict that,
contrary to the Aztec calendar,

438
01:10:29,397 --> 01:10:33,400
the return of Quetzalcoatl,
which should have been in 1467,

439
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:36,486
could take place during
the preparation of these events.

440
01:10:37,864 --> 01:10:42,409
Over there, I can see the long,
unending line of waiting victims.

441
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,454
There is a rumor that there will be
a hundred thousand.

442
01:10:45,997 --> 01:10:49,666
These four days will remain
the most formidable voluntary holocaust

443
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:51,543
in the history of the world.

444
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:57,674
In fact, it's a ritual communion
of flesh and blood.

445
01:10:57,759 --> 01:10:59,760
Blood which will run
without interruption,

446
01:10:59,844 --> 01:11:03,847
flesh of sacrifices to be devoured
by the faithful at the foot of the pyramid.

447
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:06,850
There are at least
20,000 victims the first day.

448
01:11:08,728 --> 01:11:14,983
When the thousand steps are entirely red,
then Quetzalcoatl can return.

449
01:11:16,152 --> 01:11:19,988
My throat tightens from desire
and moving anguish.

450
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:22,449
The first captive is at the top.

451
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:25,952
The priests grab him,
lay him on the stone.

452
01:11:26,037 --> 01:11:28,955
The emperor strikes him,
opening his chest.

453
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,833
He plunges his hands into the rib cage,

454
01:11:31,918 --> 01:11:34,878
pulls out the heart and brandishes it.

455
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,505
It's still beating

456
01:11:36,589 --> 01:11:39,883
above his head,
bedecked with multicolored feathers.

457
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:42,135
Everyone's in awe.

458
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:44,888
A huge cry rises from the crowd.

459
01:11:44,972 --> 01:11:48,141
The emperor raises
the dripping trophy to his mouth,

460
01:11:48,226 --> 01:11:51,603
bites, tears, rips it to shreds.

461
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:55,649
The people raise frantic screams
to heaven at this spectacle.

462
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:59,152
But already, another man
is stretched on the stone.

463
01:11:59,237 --> 01:12:01,863
The knife is raised, then lowered.

464
01:12:02,406 --> 01:12:04,991
This time,
the priests rip out the beating heart

465
01:12:05,076 --> 01:12:10,205
while servants topple over
the heartless body to replace it with another.

466
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:12,958
The hearts are thrown
a few flights down,

467
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:16,795
where nobles and the privileged
grab and devour them.

468
01:12:17,505 --> 01:12:20,090
The bodies are cast
to the bottom of the pyramid.

469
01:12:20,174 --> 01:12:22,717
There, the people dismember them.

470
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:25,512
Women take the pieces,

471
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:30,725
and that night they are roasted
or boiled for the cannibalistic meal.

472
01:12:32,228 --> 01:12:35,188
We begin to distinguish
the tiny red strands that,

473
01:12:35,273 --> 01:12:38,483
drop by drop,
stain the highest steps of the temple.

474
01:12:39,443 --> 01:12:44,531
Tonight, by sundown, they'll all be red.

475
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:45,907
All of them.

476
01:12:45,992 --> 01:12:47,701
More than a thousand.

477
01:12:47,785 --> 01:12:49,786
And at the end of the last day,

478
01:12:49,996 --> 01:12:52,455
the staircase will be nothing
but a carpet of blood

479
01:12:52,707 --> 01:12:54,708
running from the top to the bottom.

480
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:57,002
Carpet. A carpet flowing

481
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:59,462
with a sickening odor
that's exciting at the same time.

482
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:00,839
I won!

483
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:02,716
I won!

484
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,718
You're alive, Louise.

485
01:13:04,802 --> 01:13:06,386
My blood saved you.

486
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:10,891
Henriette, don't cry!

487
01:13:11,976 --> 01:13:14,477
Henriette, I love you.

488
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:18,690
Look, we're still alive!

489
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:21,067
Both of us!

490
01:13:21,152 --> 01:13:22,694
Forever!

491
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:24,571
Do you hear, Henriette?

492
01:13:24,655 --> 01:13:26,197
Alive forever!

493
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:30,660
We won't have a mishap.

494
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:33,246
Look, I'm alive.

495
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:36,374
Don't cry!

496
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:48,929
The blue light is leaving.

497
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:50,972
The whole night's passed.

498
01:13:52,016 --> 01:13:55,852
The day's coming
and taking away my sight.

499
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,814
Louise, I can't see you anymore.

500
01:14:13,037 --> 01:14:15,455
- He's sleeping.
- We must get rid of him.

501
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:18,583
- Regain our freedom.
- He's a constant danger for us.

502
01:14:18,668 --> 01:14:22,712
- If he found out ―
- It'd be terrible. He might kill us.

503
01:14:22,797 --> 01:14:24,381
Come, let us have a drink.

504
01:14:24,465 --> 01:14:26,383
It'll help us find a solution.

505
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:45,527
We could slice him
with the saber in the living room.

506
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:47,570
He's big, you know.

507
01:14:50,241 --> 01:14:53,535
It'd be better to smother him
with a pillow while he's sleeping.

508
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:55,453
We're not strong enough.

509
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:58,289
We need a way that's easy and quick.

510
01:15:03,713 --> 01:15:05,338
We're so stupid!

511
01:15:05,423 --> 01:15:08,925
We only have to bite him
and suck his blood until he dies!

512
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,927
And is he going to let us?

513
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:17,517
Sabotage his car.

514
01:15:18,102 --> 01:15:19,978
Push it into the Seine.

515
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,369
Not as good as blood.

516
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:38,163
But it's stronger.

517
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,459
We'll find a solution.

518
01:16:18,329 --> 01:16:19,829
Look at this.

519
01:16:25,336 --> 01:16:27,045
It's beautiful!

520
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,839
The blood running on the walls.

521
01:16:29,924 --> 01:16:31,132
And on the ground.

522
01:16:31,217 --> 01:16:32,467
Blood everywhere!

523
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,052
It's magnificent!

524
01:16:34,136 --> 01:16:35,595
Superb!

525
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,305
It makes me thirsty.

526
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:38,723
Very thirsty.

527
01:16:38,808 --> 01:16:41,267
Oh, the blood is so red!

528
01:16:41,352 --> 01:16:43,311
And how it must run.

529
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:46,231
It's our life
that's painted on these pages.

530
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:47,982
Our joy.

531
01:16:48,484 --> 01:16:50,068
Our gluttony.

532
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:55,365
I'm happy to observe
that your sight's improved

533
01:16:56,367 --> 01:17:00,286
so much that you're able to look at a book
at nearly 2:00 in the morning.

534
01:17:08,087 --> 01:17:12,090
Oh, Father, what a pity
you discovered our secret now.

535
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:16,010
We were guarding it jealously
until your birthday on the weekend.

536
01:17:16,095 --> 01:17:18,638
It's really extraordinary what's happened.

537
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:21,307
We began to distinguish
the shape of things,

538
01:17:21,392 --> 01:17:22,433
bit by bit.

539
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:24,435
Then we knew our sight was returning.

540
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,354
At first we were so afraid

541
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,439
our blindness would return.

542
01:17:35,197 --> 01:17:37,073
My children.

543
01:17:37,575 --> 01:17:40,410
- My poor children.
- It's not true sight yet.

544
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:41,995
Just a blur.

545
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:44,164
But tonight, we were so anxious,

546
01:17:44,248 --> 01:17:46,082
we came downstairs to see a book.

547
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:48,209
It's like a miracle, Father!

548
01:17:48,294 --> 01:17:50,712
I could read! You understand?

549
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:53,381
And both of us.
It's the same for both of us.

550
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:56,176
We wanted to be certain
before we told you.

551
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,845
We were going to wait
until your birthday.

552
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:03,433
If the miracle persisted on that day,

553
01:18:03,517 --> 01:18:05,268
we would have read a poem for you

554
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:08,521
that we've been secretly composing
by ourselves since last Thursday, as a gift.

555
01:18:08,606 --> 01:18:12,192
A good breakfast
will help us put things right.

556
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:14,319
Afterwards, I'll examine your eyes.

557
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,323
How could I have doubted you?

558
01:19:06,956 --> 01:19:09,874
Father, may I have
some of the jam in the cupboard?

559
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:11,834
Of course, my dear.

560
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:22,845
You found the jam, my sweet angel?

561
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:51,708
Go on.

562
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,257
He won't be able to get up.

563
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:46,637
If no organs were cut, he could still live
a long time with the knife stuck in him.

564
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:49,932
I hit him hard.
He hasn't got much longer.

565
01:21:02,446 --> 01:21:04,447
I don't hear anything.

566
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:07,700
Maybe he's dead.

567
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:18,461
He won't bother us anymore
with his damned pity!

568
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:20,463
There's no pity for vampire orphans.

569
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:22,757
They'll love us for what we are,
or they'll crush us!

570
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:24,550
We'll slit their throats.

571
01:21:24,635 --> 01:21:27,720
Let's get out of here now.
We'll set a fire before leaving.

572
01:21:27,805 --> 01:21:29,639
They'll only find one burned body.

573
01:21:29,723 --> 01:21:31,724
They'll say it was a robbery.

574
01:21:31,809 --> 01:21:33,559
We were scared and ran away.

575
01:21:33,644 --> 01:21:35,645
We saw nothing because we're blind!

576
01:21:51,995 --> 01:21:56,416
Go to bed, Sister Martha.
You did your rounds, and it's late.

577
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,000
And yourself, Mother?

578
01:21:58,669 --> 01:21:59,836
Me?

579
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:02,713
I must pray more.

580
01:22:03,215 --> 01:22:06,926
I think I can guess, if I may,
the object of your prayers.

581
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:08,094
Really?

582
01:22:08,178 --> 01:22:10,555
And what do you think it is,
Sister Martha?

583
01:22:11,014 --> 01:22:13,808
You are asking, as I do each night,

584
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,604
for the joy of once more
seeing our little dears.

585
01:22:19,773 --> 01:22:21,691
Your heart has guessed right.

586
01:22:22,192 --> 01:22:24,193
I miss our two little lambs.

587
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:30,992
But something tells me
we'll see them again.

588
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:32,827
You and I, Sister Martha.

589
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:35,496
You and I will both
see them again soon.

590
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:37,331
May God hear you.

591
01:23:32,095 --> 01:23:34,013
What do we do now?

592
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:36,015
It'll be day soon.

593
01:23:36,099 --> 01:23:40,186
We'll hide in a grave until tomorrow night
and then go back to the orphanage.

594
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,730
- Do you think our room is still empty?
- Of course!

595
01:23:42,814 --> 01:23:45,399
Our dear mother superior
wouldn't give it to anyone.

596
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:47,777
In any case, Sister Martha
wouldn't let her do it.

597
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:49,445
Hush.

598
01:23:49,947 --> 01:23:51,531
Someone's coming!

599
01:23:51,615 --> 01:23:54,408
- Someone whose throat we can slit?
- Or drink.

600
01:23:55,744 --> 01:23:58,371
- A party girl who's drunk?
- Maybe.

601
01:23:58,455 --> 01:24:00,414
I think it's something else.

602
01:24:01,959 --> 01:24:03,334
She's an outcast.

603
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:06,212
A creature of the night
like you and me.

604
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,548
- We're unique! Kill her!
- Wait.

605
01:24:08,632 --> 01:24:10,675
We must know.

606
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:13,553
We're the vampire orphan girls,
and we're in our home.

607
01:24:13,637 --> 01:24:16,097
What are you doing here?
Are you one of us?

608
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:18,140
I am what I am.

609
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:23,396
I come and go
in places like this cemetery.

610
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:27,233
My wanderings are unending.

611
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,069
I seek nourishment.

612
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:33,406
You ―
You drink the blood of humans,

613
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:34,490
but I,

614
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:40,663
the beast, the vulture,

615
01:24:40,747 --> 01:24:42,707
the hyena that I am,

616
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:45,543
I feed on cadavers,
dead of dead flesh.

617
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:46,627
A ghoul!

618
01:24:46,712 --> 01:24:49,839
We live off the living.
She eats the dead.

619
01:24:50,674 --> 01:24:52,717
Go, poor, unhappy girls.

620
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:55,761
The dawn's coming.

621
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:59,932
My nourishment ― I get it from the earth.

622
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:02,560
I don't like to be seen.

623
01:25:02,853 --> 01:25:04,353
Go away!

624
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:20,411
Good-bye, my little vampires.

625
01:25:21,538 --> 01:25:26,083
When you come back out at dusk,
I won't be here.

626
01:25:26,168 --> 01:25:30,796
The ghoul never comes
to the same place more than once.

627
01:25:32,299 --> 01:25:36,052
But this earth ― I feel it!

628
01:25:37,012 --> 01:25:41,599
I can feel that I shall
have my fill of new cadavers.

629
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:05,164
<i>Another day coming to an end,</i>

630
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:08,167
<i>and the ritual begins again.</i>

631
01:26:08,251 --> 01:26:10,336
<i>Turn out the lights,</i>

632
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:12,963
<i>then return to my room and pray.</i>

633
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:17,760
<i>Around midnight, make my rounds</i>
<i>in this silent orphanage.</i>

634
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:21,389
<i>Then finally, go to bed.</i>

635
01:26:22,265 --> 01:26:23,766
<i>Sleep.</i>

636
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:26,310
<i>Perhaps dream.</i>

637
01:26:27,437 --> 01:26:31,148
<i>Before, my last rounds</i>
<i>were for my little angels.</i>

638
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:34,443
<i>I didn't have to turn out the lights.</i>

639
01:26:35,195 --> 01:26:39,407
<i>Only wish them a good night</i>
<i>and close the door.</i>

640
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:44,870
<i>Now I walk by their empty room,</i>

641
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:47,957
<i>and I lose faith</i>
<i>in ever seeing them again.</i>

642
01:26:48,458 --> 01:26:52,753
<i>My little blind girls,</i>
<i>so sweet, so pretty.</i>

643
01:26:54,631 --> 01:26:56,590
<i>What a sad life.</i>

644
01:27:38,717 --> 01:27:40,676
We need a place to sleep tonight.

645
01:28:13,043 --> 01:28:15,419
Sleep well, little Virginia.

646
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:18,130
I'm going to the chapel
to pray for you to get well.

647
01:28:18,215 --> 01:28:19,715
God bless you.

648
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:45,449
A new girl!

649
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:48,160
Poor little thing. She's sick.

650
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,292
- What's your name?
- Virginia.

651
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:59,004
- Virginia what?
-Just Virginia. I was an orphan child.

652
01:28:59,089 --> 01:29:02,883
Really! We're the two blind orphan girls,
and we're alone too.

653
01:29:02,968 --> 01:29:05,052
But you two aren't blind.

654
01:29:05,136 --> 01:29:07,680
- Because it's nighttime.
- Why'd you come to see me?

655
01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:09,932
You know, we're thirsty.

656
01:29:10,016 --> 01:29:11,934
Well, there's water on the table there.

657
01:29:12,435 --> 01:29:14,186
We don't drink water.

658
01:29:16,022 --> 01:29:17,940
You'll understand.

659
01:29:21,278 --> 01:29:23,070
That can't be!

660
01:29:23,154 --> 01:29:24,947
You just can't be!

661
01:29:25,031 --> 01:29:27,449
Of course not. We don't exist.

662
01:29:27,534 --> 01:29:29,451
You are dreaming. That's all.

663
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:33,831
- She looks good, doesn't she?
- Let me drink first.

664
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:39,211
You will be drunk by Aztec goddesses,
who don't exist, naturally.

665
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:43,007
It's a cult sacrifice.

666
01:29:43,758 --> 01:29:45,843
I'm an offering to the gods.

667
01:29:47,429 --> 01:29:48,929
That's it!

668
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:50,806
She's so dumb.

669
01:29:50,891 --> 01:29:53,225
I find her innocence touching.

670
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:55,060
She believes everything we say.

671
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:57,479
And she's abandoned,
like you and me.

672
01:29:57,814 --> 01:30:00,566
Come on. If we start feeling mercy,
there'll be no end to it.

673
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:02,151
And we'll die.

674
01:30:02,485 --> 01:30:04,862
Do you think the others
will feel sorry for us?

675
01:30:18,835 --> 01:30:21,295
Sneaking out to smoke,
the little brats.

676
01:30:21,379 --> 01:30:23,923
They'll certainly taste better
than a little sick girl.

677
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,676
- You saw nothing.
- Heard nothing.

678
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:30,137
- It was a dream.
- We do not exist.

679
01:31:09,594 --> 01:31:11,804
- Are you two smoking?
- If the sister finds out ―

680
01:31:11,888 --> 01:31:14,056
- Or Mother Superior.
- Don't tell!

681
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,641
Here, have a drag!

682
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:35,119
You're new?

683
01:31:35,203 --> 01:31:37,413
- I haven't seen you before.
- What are your names?

684
01:31:37,497 --> 01:31:39,748
- Henriette.
- I'm Louise.

685
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:42,835
What's that big book
you've got under your arm?

686
01:31:42,919 --> 01:31:46,964
- It's the story of us two.
- Yes, we're magicians.

687
01:31:47,048 --> 01:31:49,174
Yeah, right!
What kind of magicians?

688
01:31:49,259 --> 01:31:51,093
Like in this book.

689
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:53,637
Here.

690
01:31:54,848 --> 01:31:55,973
Look.

691
01:31:56,599 --> 01:31:58,851
The girl flying through the hoop ―
that's me.

692
01:31:58,935 --> 01:32:00,978
Yes. And here,

693
01:32:01,771 --> 01:32:05,190
Wanda the goddess of mystery,
rising from the flames ― that's me.

694
01:32:06,526 --> 01:32:08,193
You don't believe us?

695
01:32:08,278 --> 01:32:10,320
And if I said we're also Aztec goddesses?

696
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:12,823
Don't you have a good imagination!

697
01:32:12,907 --> 01:32:14,867
Yes, it's rare at this orphanage.

698
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:18,370
We've got a bottle
stashed in this school bag.

699
01:32:18,455 --> 01:32:19,913
You want to drink?

700
01:32:19,998 --> 01:32:22,666
Yes, that's a good idea.

701
01:32:23,293 --> 01:32:24,877
I agree.

702
01:32:25,462 --> 01:32:26,962
We're thirsty.

703
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:40,809
<i>Dear God, let this night</i>
<i>be like any other,</i>

704
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:44,188
<i>with nothing to disturb my rounds,</i>

705
01:32:44,814 --> 01:32:47,566
<i>and that my orphan girls</i>
<i>sleep peacefully.</i>

706
01:32:53,073 --> 01:32:58,952
It's the blind girls' room.
It's been empty since they left.

707
01:33:07,837 --> 01:33:09,797
But it's not possible.

708
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:14,468
I smell cigarettes.

709
01:33:16,096 --> 01:33:17,805
I hear voices.

710
01:33:19,015 --> 01:33:21,016
Something is going on.

711
01:33:23,394 --> 01:33:25,687
I'll go warn Mother Superior.

712
01:33:34,364 --> 01:33:35,697
Mother!

713
01:33:35,782 --> 01:33:38,408
Sister Martha.
What time is it?

714
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:41,620
It's almost midnight.
It's room 36.

715
01:33:41,704 --> 01:33:43,539
Room 36 is empty.

716
01:33:43,623 --> 01:33:45,290
No, they've returned.

717
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:47,000
But of whom do you speak?

718
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:50,838
Of our dear little angels ― or their ghosts!

719
01:33:50,922 --> 01:33:53,382
You're being foolish, Sister Martha.

720
01:33:53,466 --> 01:33:58,303
You know very well that the two girls
are now the children of Dr. Dennery.

721
01:33:58,388 --> 01:34:01,932
But no, I think
they're smoking in the laundry.

722
01:34:02,725 --> 01:34:04,393
All right, I'll go.

723
01:34:17,824 --> 01:34:20,409
- I hear nothing.
- I tell you there was a noise.

724
01:34:20,493 --> 01:34:22,411
Well, go in.

725
01:34:48,104 --> 01:34:49,605
My God.

726
01:34:50,648 --> 01:34:52,691
It's horrible.

727
01:34:52,775 --> 01:34:54,943
We must call the police.

728
01:35:20,553 --> 01:35:23,222
Now they're going to
end up getting us.

729
01:35:23,306 --> 01:35:26,058
Not alive. I don't want them
to take us alive!

730
01:35:26,142 --> 01:35:27,643
Don't be afraid.

731
01:35:27,727 --> 01:35:29,770
We're the two vampire orphan girls.

732
01:35:29,854 --> 01:35:31,480
They won't get us.

733
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:34,733
- Henriette.
- Yes?

734
01:35:34,817 --> 01:35:36,276
Who are we?

735
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:39,071
I mean, for real.

736
01:35:39,155 --> 01:35:40,906
We're two Aztec goddesses.

737
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:44,326
- There are no more Aztecs.
- Well, then, we're ―

738
01:35:45,495 --> 01:35:46,662
I don't know.

739
01:35:46,746 --> 01:35:48,330
Perhaps nothing.

740
01:35:48,414 --> 01:35:50,123
Perhaps we're nothing.

741
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:52,417
In any case, we'll soon disappear.

742
01:35:52,502 --> 01:35:54,086
You think so?

743
01:35:54,712 --> 01:35:56,922
Yes, they saw us.

744
01:35:57,507 --> 01:35:59,675
They'll chase us sooner or later.

745
01:36:26,369 --> 01:36:28,662
It's you they're looking for, is that it?

746
01:36:30,164 --> 01:36:31,873
You don't look bad.

747
01:36:33,209 --> 01:36:36,878
- They say that you bite ―
- We can, if we want.

748
01:36:37,797 --> 01:36:39,798
Will you bite me if I come closer?

749
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:46,138
No, not you.

750
01:36:46,222 --> 01:36:48,432
You didn't call for help
when you saw us.

751
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,184
My name's Nicole.

752
01:36:51,269 --> 01:36:53,353
Why do you have white canes
like blind people?

753
01:36:53,438 --> 01:36:56,148
We like to twirl them
like Charlie Chaplin in the movies.

754
01:36:56,232 --> 01:36:58,817
We're not really blind.
We see at night.

755
01:36:58,901 --> 01:37:00,402
At night only.

756
01:37:00,486 --> 01:37:02,487
Why is everyone looking for you?

757
01:37:02,572 --> 01:37:04,448
It's on the radio too.

758
01:37:04,532 --> 01:37:06,450
We bit a few people.

759
01:37:06,534 --> 01:37:09,286
But then, we're not like others.

760
01:37:11,122 --> 01:37:12,914
Well, who are you?

761
01:37:15,418 --> 01:37:16,960
We are us!

762
01:37:17,045 --> 01:37:19,838
- How do you bite?
- You see these teeth, here?

763
01:37:19,922 --> 01:37:22,549
They grow by themselves,
at certain times.

764
01:37:26,763 --> 01:37:28,930
- And after?
- They go back.

765
01:37:33,519 --> 01:37:35,979
But then, who are you?

766
01:37:36,064 --> 01:37:37,898
We're Aztec goddesses.

767
01:37:37,982 --> 01:37:39,524
You are real gods?

768
01:37:39,609 --> 01:37:41,902
All gods are real,
because they are imaginary.

769
01:37:41,986 --> 01:37:45,072
You're in a sacred book,
like the gods are?

770
01:37:45,156 --> 01:37:46,948
Take it.

771
01:37:47,033 --> 01:37:48,867
It's our sacred book.

772
01:37:48,951 --> 01:37:51,370
You'll see us as Indians
with feathered headdresses.

773
01:37:51,454 --> 01:37:54,790
Also, as beheaded red devils
holding our heads by the hair.

774
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:56,875
And Oriental dancers!

775
01:37:56,959 --> 01:38:00,712
You'll see the Dance of the Seven Veils,
the Arab lady levitating,

776
01:38:00,797 --> 01:38:02,964
the Chinese lady
crucified with daggers!

777
01:38:03,049 --> 01:38:05,717
The pretty blonde with wild eyes
in a straitjacket.

778
01:38:05,802 --> 01:38:08,845
Houdini's assistant diving with him
in a tank full of water.

779
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:13,266
Duga the magician, who's wearing
only pearls and dances in the flames.

780
01:38:13,351 --> 01:38:15,268
The girl in the costume, sawed in half!

781
01:38:15,353 --> 01:38:16,770
All this is us!

782
01:38:16,854 --> 01:38:19,231
One woman locked up with a tiger,
one put to sleep,

783
01:38:19,315 --> 01:38:21,775
one decapitated, one quartered
and one in flames.

784
01:38:21,859 --> 01:38:24,820
One stepped on by an elephant ―
that's us!

785
01:38:24,904 --> 01:38:29,074
All the magical girls ― they are Henriette
and Louise, the Aztec goddesses.

786
01:38:33,996 --> 01:38:37,332
Oh, the game is over.

787
01:38:38,668 --> 01:38:42,712
We have to go back to the cemetery.

788
01:38:43,589 --> 01:38:45,340
I know a shortcut you can take.

789
01:38:45,425 --> 01:38:47,092
Then guide us!

790
01:38:47,176 --> 01:38:49,845
Daylight is coming.
Our sight is leaving.

791
01:39:09,907 --> 01:39:12,617
Look. It's the two girls from the cemetery.

792
01:39:12,702 --> 01:39:14,619
Quick, get me the gun.

793
01:39:51,532 --> 01:39:53,575
Henriette! Henriette!

794
01:39:56,078 --> 01:39:58,538
She's not going to die
or anything, right, Louise?

795
01:39:58,623 --> 01:40:00,749
She's not dying, right?

796
01:40:04,086 --> 01:40:08,673
Do you know why the Aztec religion
was so different than any other?

797
01:40:09,592 --> 01:40:11,301
I don't know.

798
01:40:12,929 --> 01:40:14,679
Their gods are mortal.

799
01:40:17,016 --> 01:40:19,267
But you'll both come back, right?

800
01:40:20,269 --> 01:40:21,853
You'll return?

801
01:40:21,938 --> 01:40:25,106
So I can be part of your game.

802
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:28,318
Come, say you'll return...

803
01:40:29,654 --> 01:40:31,613
so I can play with you!

804
01:40:32,365 --> 01:40:36,409
It's we who'll play with you, Nicole.
You are alive.

805
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,120
We are asleep.

806
01:40:40,122 --> 01:40:41,873
You're our dream.

807
01:40:43,626 --> 01:40:47,462
The dead dream about the living,
not the reverse.

808
01:40:48,422 --> 01:40:50,799
Don't go away. Stay!

809
01:41:03,521 --> 01:41:05,480
We are sublime disorder.

810
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,400
We're from before their god.

811
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:14,364
They made him say ‘‘Let there be light''
to cut our night in half.

812
01:41:15,324 --> 01:41:17,367
But their order is chaos.

813
01:41:17,451 --> 01:41:19,369
Our disorder is mad poetry.

814
01:41:20,371 --> 01:41:22,664
Our existence awakens,

815
01:41:23,666 --> 01:41:25,417
and our night is clarity.

816
01:41:27,795 --> 01:41:32,591
The two orphan girls roar alone
in the night, like flames.

817
01:41:32,675 --> 01:41:35,927
And so, no one can touch them.

818
01:41:38,097 --> 01:41:40,682
All others are puppets for our game!

819
01:41:42,393 --> 01:41:46,062
Henriette, nothing's real.

820
01:41:46,981 --> 01:41:48,523
Don't go!

821
01:41:53,696 --> 01:41:55,655
We will return, Louise.

822
01:41:58,242 --> 01:42:01,661
We will be the wind and the rain.

823
01:42:03,539 --> 01:42:06,750
We will be the elements
that men fear the most.

824
01:42:08,252 --> 01:42:11,546
The thunder, the tempest.

825
01:42:13,507 --> 01:42:15,550
But our bodies ―

826
01:42:16,385 --> 01:42:18,386
We can't let them find us.

827
01:42:20,139 --> 01:42:21,473
Louise.

828
01:42:25,061 --> 01:42:27,228
Do you see a hole to hide in?

829
01:42:32,735 --> 01:42:35,904
Yes, they won't find us.

830
01:42:39,867 --> 01:42:41,076
Here.

831
01:42:41,869 --> 01:42:43,578
We're in there.

832
01:42:44,413 --> 01:42:46,247
You won't forget us.

833
01:42:50,753 --> 01:42:52,587
Can't I come with you?

834
01:42:53,881 --> 01:42:55,632
No, don't watch us.

835
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:59,636
Quick, they're coming!

836
01:43:16,612 --> 01:43:17,696
Louise!

837
01:43:19,699 --> 01:43:21,199
Where are you?

838
01:43:24,286 --> 01:43:25,787
I'm blind!

839
01:43:30,626 --> 01:43:32,502
- I'm dying!
- No!

840
01:43:33,045 --> 01:43:36,464
I beg you, help me to go.

841
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:41,010
I can't!

842
01:43:42,805 --> 01:43:43,805
Look.

843
01:43:45,057 --> 01:43:46,808
It's very easy.

844
01:45:42,216 --> 01:45:47,178
TWO ORPHAN VAMPIRES
