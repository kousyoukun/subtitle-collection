1
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:28,166
[preacher on radio] It is the year
of our Lord 1997, an age of prosperity.

2
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:33,458
The magnificence of God's creation,
the bounty of this Earth,

3
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:38,666
the miracle of modern life have never been
so resplendent to our eyes.

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,833
Yet for some of us,

5
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:47,708
the American dream, the singular hope
of our people, remains ever out of reach.

6
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,041
-[man 1] Amen! That's right, Preacher!
-[man 2] Yes, sir!

7
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:54,708
[preacher] And though we may feel
embittered, want to rail at injustice,

8
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,458
even in our God…

9
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,000
And though others may scorn our beliefs,

10
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,916
let us hold faith not only in that God,
but in ourselves and our character.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,666
-[woman 1] Yes! Amen!
-[man 3] Amen!

12
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,375
[preacher]
Our ability to rise, yea, to fly,

13
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:19,458
be this flight generations in the making,
be it delayed so long our faith is bound.

14
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,666
Let that faith never be broken.

15
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,708
-[woman 2] Yes, Father God!
-[men] Amen!

16
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:29,250
[preacher] At a time when families
across the world are falling apart…

17
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,000
[engine sputters]

18
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,416
-[Papaw] Where are you going, J.D.?
-[J.D.] Swim hole!

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,333
[Papaw] Don't get bit by a cottonmouth.

20
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,000
[J.D.] When people ask where I'm from,

21
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,333
I say Ohio 'cause that's where I lived
most of my life,

22
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,375
but that's only part of my story.

23
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,583
Ask me where I feel most at home,

24
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,833
that's the hill country,
Jackson, Kentucky.

25
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,125
Down those hollers
is where I spent every summer.

26
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,166
Hands down the best part of my childhood.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,833
It's where my people come from.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Whoa.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,833
Hey.

30
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,041
[grunts]

31
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,708
-Hey.
-Hey.

32
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,916
What you got there?

33
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,625
It's a, uh…

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,833
it's a turtle. See?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,833
-Shell's cracked. Pull it off.
-[chuckles] No.

36
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,833
It can't live without his shell.
Ribcage is fused to the carapace.

37
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:47,625
-Chuck it. See how far you can throw it.
-[J.D.] No. No, they can heal, okay?

38
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,666
[Nate] Whatever.

39
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,291
-[Bev] Why isn't anybody packed?
-[Lindsay] I am.

40
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,416
I told Kevin we'd be home by 1:00.

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,125
-Hey, old woman. You packed?
-What's your rush, Bev? Got a hot date?

42
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,791
Yeah, with not being bored off my ass.
Next time I'll bring Chip.

43
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,541
No, you ain't.
We don't need that drama here.

44
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:08,541
Just get your stuff!

45
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,250
Perch and swivel. I'll go when I'm ready.

46
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,250
-Real nice, Mom.
-[Uncle Pet] Fire in the hole!

47
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,125
-[engine starts]
-Yeah!

48
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,625
-Where's your brother at?
-He rode off.

49
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,375
You couldn't keep an eye on him
for two seconds?

50
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,041
[muffled laughing]

51
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,125
[J.D. screaming]

52
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,041
-[boy 1] Yeah, get him!
-[boy 2] Hey! He's coming up!

53
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,375
-[Dane] Go back to Ohio, boy!
-[boy 1] Keep him under!

54
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,041
[Dane] Pussy!

55
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,458
[muffled laughing]

56
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,958
-[J.D. gasps]
-[Dane] Get outta here.

57
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,000
[J.D.] Things could get tough
down in Jackson in a heartbeat,

58
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,583
but Mamaw and Papaw taught me
that you never start a fight.

59
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,625
But if someone starts one with you,
make damn sure you end it.

60
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:17,541
[Dane] Crawl on back to your mama, pussy.
Tell her I'll be over tonight.

61
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,208
-[boy 2] Aw, here he comes!
-[boy 1] Yeah, Dane! Punk!

62
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:25,791
[J.D.] If you can't end it,
your people will always have your back.

63
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,083
Get off him!

64
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:31,208
[J.D.] And that was our code,
and to me, our code was everything.

65
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,666
-Get off him!
-What the hell you think you're doing?

66
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,708
You son of a bitch.

67
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:41,500
I oughta put my foot up your ass so far,
you gonna have hemorrhoids for ten years.

68
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,833
-You Hugh McCall's boy?
-Eat shit, old man.

69
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,041
[boy 2] Ooh!

70
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,916
Get your ass outta here
before I call your pa.

71
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,166
Freak.

72
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,166
-[Uncle Arch] Come on, J.D.
-[wheezing]

73
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,875
What happened to you?

74
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,500
[Papaw] Well, he tried
to get hisself into a fight.

75
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,375
Of all the lamebrain ways
to get out of going home…

76
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,000
-Who did that? I'll kill him.
-Mom, come on.

77
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll kill him.
Give me a name. C'mon.

78
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,083
Hugh McCall's boy
and a couple other little assholes.

79
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,791
That McCall boy had an idea,
it'd die of loneliness.

80
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,500
-Will you get him some ice?
-Yup!

81
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:24,791
Did you tell them dickhead bastards
the three of them ain't worth one Vance?

82
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,583
-[Bev] Of course he did!
-Good boy.

83
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,416
-[Bev] All right.
-It'll be all right.

84
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,208
-Are you all right?
-I'm all right, Mom.

85
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,416
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

86
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,041
[chuckles] Get your things!

87
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,125
[all laughing]

88
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:43,083
Whoo! And dry off! I ain't sitting
next to that for three hours!

89
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,333
[all continue laughing]

90
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,833
[man] You know you gonna be starving
in 45 minutes anyway.

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,250
Let's get the family picture 'fore we go.
Bev, get over here.

92
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,375
God forbid,
we get on the road before noon.

93
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,916
-[Lori] Where are we gonna do it?
-Over there. Lori, stand by your sister.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,916
I want the sisters together.
Everybody, look at the camera. C'mon.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
[camera clicks]

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,000
C'mon, let's go.

97
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,458
I've had about all the Kentucky
I can take.

98
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,875
[Lori] Bye, Daddy. Love you!

99
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,916
-Bye-bye.
-[Mamaw] See you soon.

100
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,666
Why can't we stay longer?
We're always the first ones to leave.

101
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,708
I don't get why you ever left Jackson.

102
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,291
'Cause when you're knocked up at 13,
you get the hell out of Dodge. That's why.

103
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:52,041
[J.D.] When I was a kid,
I couldn't make sense of it.

104
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,291
Imagining Mamaw at almost my same age

105
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,000
just running, pregnant,
from everything she knew,

106
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,250
every scrap of family she had.

107
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:08,666
I felt like I'd stumbled onto something.
A puzzle piece, an answer to a question

108
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,416
I had barely begun to ask
about our family and what became of us.

109
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,583
Oh, thank God. Back to civilization.

110
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,875
[Lindsay] Kevin's here. [squeals]

111
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,666
-J.D., get my stuff.
-[J.D.] No.

112
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,250
I wouldn't call Middletown civilization.

113
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,416
Kevin! Hi! [giggles]

114
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:13,000
[Mamaw chuckling] Hey!
Aw, now, there's my little buddy.

115
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,958
Bev, give me some of them ribs.

116
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,291
His no-good mother behind the curtains.

117
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,583
Wouldn't spit on her ass
if her guts were on fire.

118
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,250
[chuckles] Here ya go, little buddy. Here.

119
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,041
All right. You take that home.

120
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,583
-All right.
-Thank you.

121
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,625
[chuckles] You're welcome. All right.

122
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,000
[Lindsay giggles] Let's go!

123
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,208
I'm gonna head on down to my place.
See ya tomorrow.

124
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,250
-Night, y'all.
-[J.D.] Goodnight, Mamaw.

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,458
[coughing]

126
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,625
-Good night, daughter.
-[Bev] Night, Dad. See ya tomorrow.

127
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,125
[J.D.] Whatever better life
my grandparents had chased up Route 23,

128
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,458
they never caught it.

129
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,250
We were all different
in Middletown somehow.

130
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,250
I don't know, like something was missing.

131
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,125
Maybe hope.

132
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:02,875
[clicks]

133
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,583
-Paycheck.
-Sorry. Thanks.

134
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,000
You couldn't get to Yale on Route 23,

135
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:17,458
but I'd come closer than any of 'em
to that dream of something better.

136
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,208
I could see it
right there in front of me.

137
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,375
But a part of me knew
the road from here to there is rocky.

138
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,458
[bell tolling]

139
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,250
[J.D.] There's no way around but through.

140
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,875
[softly] What? Put it away.

141
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,583
-Eat it.
-No, I have to study.

142
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,666
-Usha, you have to eat.
-They'll boot me if they see food in here.

143
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,375
I'll cover for you. Come on.

144
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,708
[Usha] Mm!

145
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,041
-[J.D.] Stop! They're coming!
-What?

146
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,916
Put it away! They know!
They're coming!

147
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,250
-Okay.
-The cameras!

148
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,791
They're gonna take you to the dungeons,
Usha, the famous Yale dungeons! [laughs]

149
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,208
[laughing] You jerk! Stop!
Do you want some?

150
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,750
No, I have a dinner tonight.

151
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,583
-You're gonna do great.
-[sighs]

152
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,833
-Are you nervous? What's going on?
-No.

153
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,208
I'm going to shine up
against the triple Ivy League types.

154
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,916
If you're desperate,
talk about the Hatfield-McCoy thing.

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,958
-I never should have told you that.
-[laughs]

156
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,125
This is ridiculous.

157
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,375
Hey. You're gonna get this, okay?

158
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:29,458
I have to 'cause I'm not letting you
go to D.C. without me.

159
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,916
I don't want to be there without you.

160
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
[chuckles softly]

161
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,916
I have a meeting.

162
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,958
-Mm.
-But I love you.

163
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:47,958
I love you.

164
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,541
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

165
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,458
I love you back.

166
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:56,750
Thanks.

167
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,458
-[Jill] Hey, J.D., good to see you.
-Hey. Yeah.

168
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,916
So you got your aid package for next year?

169
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,541
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

170
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,541
I know.
It's not as much as the first year.

171
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,958
Jill, I'm working three jobs.
I still can't afford $21,000.

172
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,750
How's firm week going?

173
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:27,541
It's going. I got a callback,
a dinner tonight, interviews tomorrow--

174
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,625
The standard salary for a summer associate
is well over $30,000.

175
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,875
If I get the job. What if I don't?

176
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,125
I'm looking for a contingency plan.

177
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,000
Is there one?

178
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,875
I'd do more for you if I could.

179
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,708
You're gonna get one of these jobs, J.D.

180
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,708
I'm sure of it.

181
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,958
[indistinct chatter]

182
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,250
[J.D.] I would definitely consider
a clerkship,

183
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,083
but I could also see myself
going the firm route, as well.

184
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,125
Makes perfect sense.
Keep your options open.

185
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,041
Let's introduce you around.

186
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,708
Perfect. There's actually someone
I was hoping to meet.

187
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:07,000
Holly! You made it!

188
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,000
Brooks! Yes, I did.

189
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,541
[man] As an editor at the Journal,

190
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,208
I had the opportunity
to meet with all the top firms,

191
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,166
so I would consider something…

192
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,083
Excuse me.

193
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,041
Call me Tuesday.

194
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,416
Care for wine, sir?

195
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,208
Have some. They're serving the good stuff.

196
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,208
Red or white?

197
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,458
White is fine.

198
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,083
Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc?

199
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,375
Try the Chardonnay.

200
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,541
-Thank you.
-You were saying…

201
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,958
-[cell phone vibrates]
-Yes, I-- Sorry.

202
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,791
Um, so, my girlfriend
has a summer position in D.C.,

203
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,041
and I was hoping
to talk to Phillip Roseman

204
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,375
-because his firm--
-There he is right there.

205
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,875
Tall guy with the glasses.

206
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,000
Remind me. Where did you go for undergrad?

207
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,166
-Ohio State.
-Right. Plenty of great state schools.

208
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,958
[indistinct chatter]

209
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,500
[Phillip] …corporate lawyer father
upset about that?

210
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,333
[man] Oh, of course.
We all have our share of that, too.

211
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,583
So litigation, pretty big transition.

212
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,833
Is this seat taken?

213
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:27,708
Go ahead.

214
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,666
Phillip Roseman.

215
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,875
Uh, J.D. Vance. Thanks.

216
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,000
That's the thing to do.
That's what I did my first summer.

217
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:42,666
…cutthroat nature of it all.
I wanted to focus on the laws. [laughs]

218
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,958
You on the Journal?

219
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,791
-No, I didn't get in this time.
-Too bad.

220
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:00,083
-I'm gonna try again, though.
-Lot of firms won't touch you without it.

221
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,583
Yes, sir. That's what I've heard.

222
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,875
Will you excuse me? I'm sorry.

223
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,500
[cell phone vibrates]

224
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,458
J.D.?

225
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,583
Why are there so many fuckin' forks?

226
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,291
Usha, what am I supposed to do
with all these forks?

227
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,250
They had two different kinds
of white wine. It's like a test.

228
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,250
[Usha] It is a test.

229
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,041
Next time
just say you'll have whatever's driest.

230
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:28,958
[J.D.] Driest, okay.

231
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,875
Listen,
use the silverware from the outside in.

232
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,125
If the knife has a funny edge,
it's for fish.

233
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,458
If the spoon's too big, it's for soup,

234
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,208
and the spoon at the top,
that's for dessert.

235
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:45,666
Try this: put your first finger
and your thumb together on each hand.

236
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,125
-What?
-[Usha] Do it. Just do it.

237
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,666
You have "D" for drink on the right
and "B" for bread on the left.

238
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,083
-Got it?
-Okay.

239
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,916
Now put your hands up to your eyes.

240
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:03,333
-Now what?
-Oh, my God. You actually did it?

241
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,500
[chuckling] Oh, my God.

242
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,791
Oh, my God. I'm such an idiot.
Why are you with me?

243
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:12,458
Well, because you're not a douchebag
and you don't know how to use forks.

244
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:16,000
You got a callback at the best firm.
Are you registering that?

245
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,541
It's just a dinner, right?

246
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:22,958
Just a dinner, piece of cake.
Thank you, spirit guide.

247
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:27,625
-Ah, don't mention it. Okay, bye.
-Bye.

248
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,250
[cell phone vibrates]

249
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,166
Jesus, Linds. What is it?
I'm at a dinner interview thing.

250
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,583
[Lindsay] It's Mom.

251
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,625
She's in the hospital.

252
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,875
Well, is she okay? What happened?

253
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,125
She started using again.

254
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,208
[sighs]

255
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,958
I can't do this right now.

256
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,166
Heroin.

257
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,500
What?

258
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,500
She OD'd.

259
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,666
[breathing heavily]

260
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,750
"'Class, this is a tadpole,'
said Mr. Shepherd."

261
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,625
What do you think a tadpole becomes?

262
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,791
-Frog!
-[Bev] A frog!

263
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,791
-J.D., go long! It's for you!
-[all cheer]

264
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,583
-[Bev] That's my boy! [laughs]
-[J.D. laughs]

265
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,500
[Bev sobbing]

266
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,208
Mom?

267
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,916
[inhales sharply]

268
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,541
Did I do something?

269
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,875
[continues sobbing]

270
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,541
[Brett] I told her the only progeny
I want are billable hours.

271
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,625
[all laugh]

272
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,958
-[Rich] That's good.
-You all right?

273
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,708
Yes, sir. I'm fine. Thank you.

274
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,708
Did you meet Rich and Pamela?

275
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,958
-Hi.
-[J.D.] Hello.

276
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,000
-Great to meet you, J.D.
-Good to meet you, sir.

277
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,875
[Rich] Brett was just telling us
about his remarkable transformation

278
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:37,416
from Harvard Business School grad
to Yale law student.

279
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,541
So… what's your story?

280
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,833
Well, I'm from Ohio,
but my family is from Kentucky.

281
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,208
-Bluegrass State.
-Yes, sir.

282
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,208
I joined the Marines out of high school,
served in Iraq.

283
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,708
-Wow.
-It was a great experience.

284
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,375
It helped pay for college.

285
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,375
-It's the American dream.
-[J.D.] Exactly.

286
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,500
Then I finished up
and got my degree in two years.

287
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,500
So your family, were they, uh,
coal miners?

288
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,916
No, actually, my grandfather went north
to work at a steel plant

289
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,375
like a lot of folks from Appalachia did.

290
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,791
They were actually
sort of hillbilly royalty

291
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,791
because my Papaw was related to the guy
who started the Hatfield-McCoy feud.

292
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,000
-Really?
-Yes, ma'am.

293
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,666
-No kidding.
-I just saw that miniseries.

294
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,750
[Rich chuckling]

295
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,833
What's it like when you go back?

296
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,750
I don't really get
a lot of chances to go back.

297
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,833
It must feel
like you're from another planet.

298
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,125
Yeah, uh, you know, I guess.

299
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:43,208
Like, you know,
"Who are all these rednecks?" [laughs]

300
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,208
We don't really use that term.

301
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,333
Oh, no. Yeah, that's not at all what…

302
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,625
It's just, you know,

303
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:54,125
I mean, you're at a top
educational institutions in the world--

304
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,750
My mother was salutatorian
of her high school.

305
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:00,208
Smartest person I've met,
probably smarter than anyone in this room.

306
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,666
Maybe so.

307
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,625
Well, I didn't mean any disrespect.

308
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,375
Looks like you failed on that one.

309
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,250
It sounds like we should
be offering your mother a position.

310
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,916
[all chuckling]

311
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,875
How'd it get so bad?
You had to have known.

312
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,416
[Lindsay]
I can't be with her every minute.

313
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,916
I've got my own shit.

314
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,541
Kevin's Bronco keeps breaking down,
and now he's working nights

315
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,208
and I'm the one
that's got to get it fixed.

316
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:41,958
And this dirtbag
Mom's been screwing, Ray, is a junkie.

317
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,083
And with Aunt Lori gone, it's all on me.

318
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,500
-Guys!
-[girl] No, he did not!

319
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,958
[shouting] Guys, I am trying to talk
to your uncle! Stop it!

320
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,000
Sorry for yelling.

321
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,875
-I'm sorry I haven't been there, Lindsay.
-Can you come now?

322
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:07,791
I can't. It's Interview Week
and if I'm not here, I just--

323
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,166
Can't you come home?

324
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:21,625
-["I Wanna Dance with Somebody" playing]
-Why do we do this every year?

325
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,708
'Cause it's what we do. That's why.

326
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,291
Couldn't we hide the old ones?

327
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,875
At Christmas, I can rewrap your presents
and put it under a fake tree.

328
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,041
Would you like that?

I can't hear Whitney.

331
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,916
She sounds better that way.

332
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:37,416
Wiseass.

333
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,916
Come on. Mom, I'm watching Gore.

334
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,125
[Bev] You made this one
when you were five.

335
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:46,250
I was ten.

336
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,333
Whatever. It's a memory
and I'm gonna have it when I'm old.

337
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,083
-I just have to--
-[Bev] Lindsay?

338
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,791
What?

339
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,458
-It's Kevin.
-I don't care if it's the baby Jesus.

340
00:22:57,541 --> 00:23:00,000
It's Easter, God damn it.
Get your ass in here.

341
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,375
[Lindsay] I gotta go.

342
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,833
[Bev] "It's Kevin."

343
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,791
It's always Kevin.

344
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:09,500
What do you want me to do?

345
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:12,541
Blow an egg or help out
with Mamaw's basket. Git!

346
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,333
-[Lindsay] Ugh!
-What do I even put on it?

347
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,583
-Be creative. What will she like?
-Menthols.

348
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:20,291
-[J.D. laughs]
-She likes flowers. Make one out of this.

349
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,458
[knocking on door]

350
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,958
[Chip] Hey-hey!
Hope someone's home.

351
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,625
I hope that's Chip.
He got something for you two.

352
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,541
Come in! Come on.

353
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,208
-[J.D.] What?
-Hey.

354
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,708
-What do you think, J.D.?
-[Bev] Don't just sit there. It's yours!

355
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:39,708
[Lindsay] Aww!

356
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,458
[J.D.] What do we name him?
This is great.

357
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,541
-Jesus. How big is that thing gonna get?
-He was the best one.

358
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,500
[Lindsay laughs]

359
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,083
-What do you say?
-[Lindsay] Hi.

360
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:50,333
-What do you say?
-Thank you.

361
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,916
Take him outside.

362
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,833
-[J.D.] He's good-looking.
-Look at his paws.

363
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,500
-Take him outside.
-[Lindsay] Come here.

364
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,833
-Get him!
-[J.D.] I got him!

365
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,500
Get him before he pisses!

366
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,458
-[J.D.] Come here.
-He is sniffing around--

367
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,041
-He's going in my room!
-Oh, no.

368
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,958
Get him before he ruins my rug!

369
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:10,958
Bad dog. You are a bad dog!

370
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,875
He does that again,
I'll fucking kill him!

371
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,125
-You're the one that wanted a dog!
-[Lindsay] Mom!

372
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,000
He just pisses wherever the hell he wants.

373
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,791
Should fit in just fine around here.
[laughs]

374
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,750
You take him outside.
[sniffles] I'll pick up the piss.

375
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,541
-[J.D.] I can take him.
-Making messes.

376
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,875
-Here's the leash.
-Give me that, okay?

377
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,625
-I can take him!
-Okay, but be careful.

378
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,500
-[dog barking]
-[J.D. grunting]

379
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,541
-[J.D.] I got him!
-[Lindsay] Get it!

380
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,083
-[Bev] J.D.!
-[J.D.] I didn't mean--

381
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,041
How many times have I told you
not to be so fucking careless?

382
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,458
-I'm sorry!
-You're sorry?

383
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:50,333
"I'm sorry." Go to your room!

384
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,541
C'mon, babe. They're just eggs.`

385
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:56,416
Oh, fuck you. Those are heirlooms.
My family heirlooms.

386
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
-[door thuds]
-[Bev grunts and sniffles]

387

[door opens]

388
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:24,208
Who's that? One of them chatterboxes
in a haunted house? [chuckles]

389
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,208
Atog.

390
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,250
How long are you gonna be mad at me, huh?

391
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,666
[man screams]
'Cause I don't have the money!

392
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,291
Why didn't you tell me?
Wasn't it important?

393
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,916
No, you stupid bitch!

394
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,708
[woman] Oh, I'm the stupid bitch?

395
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,541
-Those two.
-[woman] I could pay the bills!

396
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,708
-Never gets old.
-[clattering]

397
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,916
[woman] Come back here!

398
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,833
-[car starts and drives away]
-Look, I'm sorry.

399
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:49,375
Sometimes I just fuck up, but…

400
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,208
Wanna go to your favorite store?

401
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,291
Get some football cards…

402
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,375
'Cause I'm gonna go
with or without you right now.

403
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,083
Then it'll be me standing there

404
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,583
staring at all those
cute men in tight pants.

405
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,541
-Come on. [laughs]
-All right. Okay. [chuckles]

406
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,583
-See ya next time.
-[man] Thanks, Steve.

407
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,833
[rock music playing on stereo]

408
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:22,333
Who you got?

409
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,666
[chuckles]

410
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:30,375
[Bev] You need to find a new favorite.
Joe Montana's not playing anymore.

411
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,583
He's a four-time Super Bowl champion,
three-time MVP,

412
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,875
All-Pro First Team three times
and 117 career wins.

413
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:38,666
You sound like an automaton.

414
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,583
40,551 career passing yards.

415
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:42,041
-[chuckles] Okay.
-Yeah.

416
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,500
-How'd you get so smart?
-I dunno.

417
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,375
Who do you think it came from?

418
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,458
[J.D. chuckles]

419
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,958
-Sure.
-Me! It's true.

420
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,791
-Okay.
-You remember that.

421
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,916
-Whatever you say.
-Joe Montana has all of that.

422
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,333
But who has the best touchdown dance, huh?

423
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:01,791
Deion.

424
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,000
-Mm-hmm.
-Of course.

425
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,708
-Mom! Mom, stop!
-That's how it goes, right?

426
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,250
-No! Not at all. It's like this.
-Okay.

427
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,541
[Bev laughing]

428
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,333
Hey, pick those up.

429
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:20,041
-[Bev laughing]
-You shouldn't be dancing in the store.

430
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,916
[mockingly] "Don't dance in the store."

431
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,625
Pick those up now!

432
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,708
He's doing it!

433
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:27,375
Just… get out!

434
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:31,000
-He hasn't bought his cards!
-Get out!

435
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,958
Fine! Come on, J.D.

436
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Bitch!

437
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,125
["Bound for the Floor" playing]

438
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,041
[Bev] Quick!

439
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,458
Take it. Hide it.

440
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,750
[Bev laughing] Go get in the car! Come on!

441
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,166
Chip would've lost his shit
if he'd been there.

442
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,458
[laughs] I might not even tell him.

443
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,791
Of course I'll tell him.
It's too good. Come on.

444
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,416
You like Chip, right?

445
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,208
Yeah, he's okay. He just…
He talks about police all the time.

446
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,541
Well, he's a cop.

447
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,958
Yeah, but he could
still talk about other stuff, I guess.

448
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,958
We've been talking about moving in…

449
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:20,000
to Chip's house, all of us.

450
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:25,375
You'd have your own room,
and he's got a ping-pong table.

451
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,166
That'd be good, right?

452
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,166
[sighs] I don't know.

453
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:32,958
Why not?

454
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:38,333
We'd just move out again.
And then we'd have to find a new place.

455
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,166
It's kinda what always happens.

456
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,708
You know, Chris, he calls him
your flavor of the month. [chuckles]

457
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,333
What?

458
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:49,416
He's met a few of your boyfriends--

459
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,625
You let that little shit
talk about your mom like that?

460
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:56,083
-I don't let him! He just said it.
-After everything that I do for you?

461
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:03,041
You think
I'd give these losers the time of day?

462
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,666
What do you think I do it for?

463
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,708
So you and Lindsay will have
everything I never had.

464
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,000
You have no clue.

465
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,166
I was second in my whole class,
out of 400 people. Did you know that?

I coulda done whatever I wanted,

but I didn't have somebody
taking me to the library

468

and telling me I could go to college,
and gonna help me pay for it.

-I could crash.
-Mom!

471
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,625
I could crash this car
and I could kill us.

-Then you would know how lucky you are!
-Stop the car please!

-Yeah?

480

Just look at yourself, you little fat ass!

481
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:06,541

659
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,541
We'd like to invite you to
a final interview tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

660
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:27,375
Uh, that's amazing. [chuckles]
Thank you so much. That's so great.

661
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,750
But 10:00 a.m. tomorrow…

662
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:31,500
Is there another time
Mr. Roseman can meet me?

663
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:33,833
I'm a ten-hour drive away from New Haven.

664
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,125
[woman] I'm afraid not.

665
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,750
Mr. Roseman's only in New Haven
for one more day.

666
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:44,916
Okay, 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.
Uh, thank you. Bye.

667
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,458
-What?
-Summer internship.

668
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:52,500
My final interview's tomorrow.
It's the only one I got.

669
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,916
-I gotta be there.
-One day?

670
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:58,333
-Short visit.
-Yeah.

671
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:01,916
Yeah, just about a day too long.
Heroin, Lindsay? Jesus.

672
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,750
When did she go off a cliff?

673
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,333
-Dad?
-[J.D. banging on door] Papaw!

674
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,875
-[Bev] Do you hear anything?
-[J.D.] No!

675
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,375
-[Mamaw] I can see him!
-I see him!

676
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:14,291
He got the TV on too loud.
I'm breaking it.

677
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,958
-What?
-I'm breaking it.

678
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:18,875
[J.D.] Just move!

679
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,750
[Bev banging on door]
J.D.! Unlock the door!

680
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,958
Dad! Dad!

681
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,541
-Oh, my God. Call an ambulance.
-[Bev] Dad?

682
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:34,583
[Mamaw] Call!

683
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,041
-It's too late.
-How do you know?

684
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:44,625
'Cause I'm a nurse, Mom.
I know. He's dead.

685
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:46,958
[Bev sobbing]

686
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:58,958
[Bev] No, it's not an emergency.
We just need a coroner.

687
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:02,583
Yeah, I'm sure.

688
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,125
Jimmy…

689
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:16,083
[Mamaw sobbing]

690
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:25,333
[somber fiddle music playing]

691
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,500
[thunder rumbling]

692
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,791
Why do they do that, Mamaw?

693
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:18,541
'Cause we're hill people, honey.
We respect our dead.

694
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:35,541
[J.D.] I didn't know
till after he was gone

695
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:38,291
how Papaw had protected my mom
from the world.

696
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,416
Now the only person
who ever got her was gone.

697
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,458
Whatever dreams she or any of us had…

698
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,875
they all just seemed
that much further away.

699
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,000
Hey, you all right, babe?

700
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,625
[Bev] Matt, I'm fine.

701
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,416
[Mamaw sobbing]

702
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,666
[Mamaw continues sobbing]

703
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:39,625
-[woman] Is this going to hurt?
-[Bev] I already did it.

704
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,250
I give you the special treatment, Janice.
You know that.

705
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,875
That other one sure don't.

706
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:49,458
[laughs] Kit? She's new, she'll learn.

707
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:55,000
-Can I get you anything else?
-No, I'm good.

708
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:57,500
-[Bev] All right. Here.
-[woman] Thank you.

709
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:22,666
You're back. How was the funeral?

710
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:25,625
Oh, you know, same old family bullshit.

711
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,833
Oh, my God, are those yours?

712
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:36,041
Mm. I go after work.
The parking lot is perfect for it.

713
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:38,375
Oh, my God, I used to…

714
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,458
-Can I try 'em? What size are they?
-[Katrina] Um, they're a seven.

715
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,375
[Bev] Wow.

716
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:47,791
-[Katrina] Do they fit?
-Like a glove.

717
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:49,416
[Bev laughs]

718
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,041
Wow.

719
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,916
I used to love these.
You know, the roller rink.

720
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,916
-Yeah, and go on dates?
-[chuckles] Oh, I was so hot.

721
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:02,041
I went dancing and everything.
Can I try them out?

722
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:05,333
-Where're you gonna go?
-[laughing]

723
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,416
Sorry!

724
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:13,916
♪ Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning ♪

725
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,708
♪ I sit around ♪

726
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:23,375
♪ It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go… ♪

727
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:26,750
[laughing] Hello!

728
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:30,416
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey!

729
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,958
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. [laughing]
-Nurse! Nurse!

730
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,791
-Somebody call security!
-Security!

731
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:40,083
So what did they do?

732
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:42,708
They fired my ass.
What do you think they did?

733
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:45,791
-Oh, Beverly!
-[Bev] I was sick of that place anyway.

734
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,583
Gainful employment was cramping her style.

735
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,000
[Bev] I will get another job.

736
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:52,000
You could lose your fucking license.

737
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:53,916
What are you doing?

738
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,458
[Bev] I got a headache. I need a--

739
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:59,625
[Mamaw] You can't have a goddamn hissy
every time you have an off day.

740
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:01,375
You gotta think about these kids.

741
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:05,041
What do you think I've been thinking about
since I was 18 years old, huh?

742
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,166
Never had a life
where I wasn't thinking about the kids.

743
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,708
It's all about us.

744
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:16,125
-[Mamaw] So what are you gonna do?
-Figure something out.

745
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,625
Great plan, Mom.

746
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,083
It isn't easy, all right?
Just wait till you get pregnant.

747
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,583
I'm not having a kid.

748
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:30,000
You think you're special?
That's what happens to girls.

749
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,708
Only girls that are stupid.

750
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:34,625
-Beverly!
-[Bev] You wanna call me stupid?

751
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:36,583
-Little bitch!
-[Lindsay] I'm going to Kevin's!

752
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:39,291
[Bev] It's easy when someone else
is paying the bills!

753
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:42,583
-[Lindsay] I'm smarter than you!
-[Bev] You gotta respect your mother!

754
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:51,041
Can I put on Meet the Press?
There's a special about Monica Lewinsky.

755
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:54,041
[sniffles] I don't want
to hear any more of that filth.

756
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:56,166
-What's the name of this game?
-Son of a bitch!

757
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,916
[chuckles] Watch your mouth. Gin.

758
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,125
-[Mamaw chuckles]
-I never win.

759
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:05,041
Well, if you don't like it,
find some lame-ass loser to play with.

760
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:06,541
[laughs]

761
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:08,333
Deal.

762
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:20,958
-[Mamaw] Oh, my God.
-Shit!

763
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:24,291
You are the worst fucking card player
I ever met.

764
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:26,708
[chuckles]

765
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:31,000
Hasta la vista, baby.

766
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,416

-[Mamaw laughing]

768
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,916
-How many times you've seen this movie?
-Oh, about a hundred.

769
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,416
Why do you keep watching it?

770
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,458
Like it, I figure.

771
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:49,333
Everyone in this world
is one of three kinds:

772
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:53,750
a good Terminator,
a bad Terminator, and neutral.

773
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:55,375
You're a good Terminator.

774
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:58,583
Well, wasn't always. I had to learn.

775
00:48:58,666 --> 00:48:59,666
[sighs]

776
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:03,291
You could be, too,
if you don't fuck it up.

777
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,208
You're like me.

778
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:08,291
Is Mom like you?

779
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:11,166
She and Papaw were more the same.

780
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,208
He was a good Terminator.

781
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:17,041
[sighs] At times, he could be the bad one.

782
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,000
Why do you think
he was living down the street there?

783
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,541
How was he bad?

784
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:28,291
He let things get to him,
make him feel small.

785
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:30,958
Could I be bad?

786
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:33,083

-What about me? Huh? Anybody?

-[man 2] Ma'am, get out of the road!
-Help me!

-You won't help me!
-[Lindsay] Please help her!

798
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:11,500
-Help me! Can anyone help me?
-[Matt] Calm down! Bev!

799

-Hey!

-Mom?
-Hey!

You're just upset! We all miss him!

803
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:24,291
Stop acting like he was your dad!
He was my dad!

804
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:26,666
-You little bitch!
-Hey! Stop!

805
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,750
-[Bev] He's my dad!
-Stop it, Bev! Stop it!

[sobbing] Mom, please…

807
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,500
[officer 1] Stand back!
Calm down, we just need you to breathe.

808
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:35,291
-Bev…
-He's my dad!

[breathing rapidly]

810
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,958
Hey! Hey!

811
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:49,916
Stand back!

[Bev screaming] No! No! No!

814
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,541
-[Mamaw] J.D.!
-[Bev] No!

815
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:11,333
Don't look at that! Come on!
Don't you look at…

816
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:12,541
-You look at me!
-Okay.

817
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,250
You look at me! All right?

818
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,458
Lindsay, honey!
Come back down to my house!

[Bev continues wailing]

823
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,458
Yes, I'm looking for a bed for my mother.

824
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:42,125
No, she doesn't have insurance. But, um…

825
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,083
No? Okay. Thanks.

826
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:48,333
Shit.

827
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:51,375
["Don't Stop" playing on stereo]

828
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:56,458
[J.D.] Please don't put me on hold.

829
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:01,125
Oh, my God.
Is that a fried baloney sandwich?

830
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:03,125
-[chuckles]
-My savior.

831
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:05,958
-[laughing]
-Come on, Linds. Seriously. I need this.

832
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,583
-Give me the damn sandwich.
-I saved you the last slice.

833
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:12,125
I figured they don't have that at Yale.

834
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:16,625
I think this might be outlawed at Yale.
My God.

835
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,125
I miss this.

836
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,916
[Louis] Hey! [laughs]

837
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,541
There they are. Oh, look at you, huh?

838
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:26,125
Keep it down! He's talking to Yale! Ooh!

839
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:28,291
I ain't seen you
since your Mamaw's funeral.

840
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,250
-[J.D.] Been that long?
-Hey, Linds.

841
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:32,125
-Was she a holy terror.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

842
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,583
-You got the beer.
-Yes, I do.

843
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:35,000
[Lindsay] Did you get the buns?

844
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,375
Uh… I…

845
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:40,791
Well, enjoy your bunless dogs then.

846
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,458
-I will.
-[Cheryl] Nice.

847
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:43,458
[chuckles]

848
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,416
So what are you doing here, man?

849
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,791
Taking care of my mother,
dealing with all that.

850
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,916
[Louis] I was there
when Lindsay brought her in.

851
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,375
-I'm sorry.
-[J.D.] I was trying to find her a rehab.

852
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:56,041
-Whatever you do, don't go to Cedar Creek.
-Trade ya.

853
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:57,583
[J.D.] Why? What's with Cedar Creek?

854
00:52:57,666 --> 00:53:00,541
-Cedar Creek? Food's shit.
-[Louis] My brother-in-law was there.

855
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:02,291
-What's that one…
-[Louis] Got bed mites.

856
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:05,166
Get her into Fairlawn. It's like a resort.

857
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,458
They don't have beds.
Plus, we can't afford that shit.

858
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:10,333
-Hey, honey!
-Yeah?

859
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:13,333
Doesn't your friend Sally
work over at that rehab…

860
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:14,375
New Beginnings.

861
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:17,750
-Call and see if they got anything open.
-[Cheryl] Sure.

862
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:20,125
Can you believe someone married this guy?

863
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:22,541
Hell no. You kidding me?
You blindfold her?

864
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:25,583
Yeah, I blindfolded her.
That's what I did.

865
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,083
[door opens]

866
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,375
Anything?

867
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,041
I'm still on hold. It's unbelievable.

868
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:41,625
[cell phone vibrating]

869
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:46,375
Have you even talked to her?

870
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:49,500
I just don't want to drag her into it,
you know?

871
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:52,083
-You don't think she's in it?
-[cell phone clicks]

872
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:02,625
-Don't be an asshole. Let her decide.
-[scoffs]

873
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:04,625
Damn.

874
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,375
But Parker has taken it a step further

875
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:11,041
-to say judges are inherently political…
-[cell phone vibrates]

876
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:12,666
…which isn't necessarily true.

877
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,375
-Be right back.
-Usha's right.

878
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:15,875
-Hey.
-[J.D.] Hey.

879
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:20,250
-Did you make it home all right?
-Yeah, sorry I didn't call sooner.

880
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:22,458
I've just been
dealing with all this stuff.

881
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:24,583
Um, is your mom okay?

882
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:26,916
It's hard to tell, honestly,

883
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,791
but the hospital's
kicking her out at 3:00 p.m.

884
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:33,500
and, uh, we're having a bitch of a time
finding her a rehab so…

885
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:38,458
But, uh… Oh! [chuckles]
Guess what?

886
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,375
[Usha] What?

887
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:43,583
I got a call from Glaston Hamburg.

888
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:46,083
You did? For a final interview?

889
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,166
-Yeah, uh, with Phillip Roseman…
-Yes!

890
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,958
-…tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
-That's incredible, J.D.

891
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,791
Yeah, if I can make it.

892
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,666
Listen. Let me come.

893
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,208
I can stay with your mom
and you come back and interview.

894
00:54:57,291 --> 00:54:58,500
Usha, I appreciate it.

895
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:01,166
But you'd have no idea
what you'd be walking into.

896
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,250
I've been in hospitals before,
when my grandmother was sick.

897
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:06,583
It's not the fucking flu, Usha!

898
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:10,708
Okay? My mom overdosed on heroin.

899
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:14,625
-What?
-Is that the kind of problem you want?

900
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,333
I didn't think so.

901
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,500
Look, I gotta get back
and deal with all this stuff. Bye.

902
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:42,333
-[Lindsay] J.D.!
-Yeah?

903
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:44,416
[Lindsay] Come here.

904
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:53,750
The guy said, "Objectivity doesn't exist
and legal interpretation is subjective."

905
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:57,833
Exactly. What does that mean?
We can't trust the judicial system?

906
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:16,541
Cheryl thinks they might have space.
Let's go.

907
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:17,916
Talk to Sally Coates.

908
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,958
She said there was a spot
that was spoken for, but go on down.

909
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:23,541
-Thank you, Cheryl.
-Yeah. You're welcome.

910
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,166
Mom, where are my cleats?

911
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,875
Check under your bed, honey.
Get me outta here.

912
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:34,166
-So you're a soccer mom.
-Such a fake.

913
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,541
I don't know.
I think I got you out-faked by a mile.

914
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:38,625
[laughs]

915
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:41,708
You really think rehab…

916
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:43,791
What?

917
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,583
Think it'll do any good this time?

918
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:50,666
[indistinct arguing]

919
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:56,416
You miss me?

920
00:56:57,666 --> 00:56:58,500
Yeah.

921
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,333
[Bev] Is Lindsay around?

922
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:04,500
Not spending all her time
with Prince Charming? [chuckles]

923
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:05,875
You know how it is.

924
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:14,333
I, uh…

925
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,708
-I brought you this.
-What's this?

926
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:21,625
Some stuff for you to do
while you're in here

927
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,000
so you don't get bored.

928
00:57:23,666 --> 00:57:28,208
It's got funny jokes and math problems
and some Bible stuff, too.

929
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:29,916
I made it.

930
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:32,166
[chuckles]

931
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:44,166
I love you.

932
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:49,791
When I get out of here,
I'm going to make a real home for us.

933
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:51,541
Okay?

934
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:55,708
You gotta help me do more cooking
and all that healthy stuff, okay?

935
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:00,791
It's gonna be different now.

936
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:10,208
[receptionist] New Beginnings.
How may I direct your call?

937
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:11,291
-Hi.
-[woman] Hi.

938
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:14,666
We're here to visit
my son Victor. Victor Boyd.

939
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,041
Oh, of course. Please have a seat.

940
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:19,708
Hi, sir. Yes?

941
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:23,041
Hello. I'm J.D. Vance.
I'm here to see Sally Coates.

942
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:28,291
[Sally] To be honest with you,
I know you and Cheryl go back,

943
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:32,625
I'd love to help, but there's a procedure
to getting on the wait list--

944
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:33,916
Ma'am, I understand.

945
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,791
Okay, but my mom's had a really tough time
since Mamaw died a few years back.

946
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:41,125
I wish I could help. It's just--

947
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,833
I respect your need to follow procedure.

948
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,000
I know she messed up.

949
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,541
And she's had a history of it,

950
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:51,791
but she also has a history
of being a pretty good person.

951
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,916
[sighs]

952
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,375
She put herself through
nursing school as a single mother,

953
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,833
and now I'm at law school.

954
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:05,958
I just… I really…
Ma'am, I really think that…

955
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,666
if my mom had somebody to believe in her…

956
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,166
You need to understand
that I can't leave here.

957
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,916
I can't until I've done
everything humanly possible.

958
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,333
All right? This is my family.

959
00:59:23,791 --> 00:59:27,958
So until you drag me out of here,
I'm gonna keep giving you reasons.

960
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:33,416
[man over PA] Jason Flip,
please report to the Group Room.

961
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,166
Jason Flip, to the group room please.
Thank you.

962
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:43,166
-Glad I was able to help.
-Thank you so much.

963
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,541
Good, Linds.

964
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,541
Okay, uh, bear with me here.

965
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:51,958
[receptionist scoffs]

966
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:56,583
Five hundred on this one
and a thousand on this one.

967
00:59:56,666 --> 01:00:00,208
Sorry. Five hundred on this one
and a thousand on this one.

968
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:01,208
This one?

969
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:04,625
[receptionist] We'll authorize it now,
but it won't charge till she's admitted.

970
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:08,291
[Lindsay] Yup. Okay.

971
01:00:08,375 --> 01:00:10,041
[J.D.] That should be for the first week.

972
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:11,208
Pick me up here.

973
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:14,208
I need payment
for the first two weeks to check her in.

974
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,458
Okay. Um…

975
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:21,333
Okay, put 500 more on this one

976
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:24,541
and, uh… 1,000 on that one.

977
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:28,333
And that should be… good.
Let me know if those all go through.

978
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:30,625
Sorry about this.

979
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:32,875
[receptionist] Last one.

980
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,250
Okay, you're good.

981
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:40,375
-Are you serious?
-I am! [chuckles]

982
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,041
Okay, perfect. Thank you.

983
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,208
That's done.

984
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:45,250
Amazing. I'll come back and sign those.

985
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:47,791
-I'll let my mom know what's going on.
-Yes, sir.

986
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:51,833
Okay, uh, you're good to go.

987
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:55,083
Once the doctor and the therapist
do their assessment of you.

988
01:00:55,166 --> 01:00:57,541
-No, thanks.
-[J.D.] What are you talking about?

989
01:00:58,041 --> 01:00:59,000
I changed my mind.

990
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,708
-Where are you going?
-What?

991
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:04,125
-I begged them to let you stay here.
-Nobody asked you to.

992
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:07,375
-I'm not a charity case.
-Why am I here, Mom?

993
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:11,375
-Feel superior maybe?
-[J.D.] How can you be so fucking selfish?

994
01:01:11,458 --> 01:01:13,875
-You even care what you do to Lindsay?
-J.D., shut up.

995
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:16,708
-Leave her out of this!
-You did the same thing to Mamaw.

996
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:20,291
You just took and took from her
until she was practically bankrupt.

997
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:23,791
-Yeah, she was a goddamn saint.
-All she ever did was bail you out!

998
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:25,541
Except when it mattered!

999
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Do you actually want to be dead?
Or you just too lazy to try?

1000
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,541
-[Lindsay] J.D.! Don't!
-Oh, I tried… plenty!

1001
01:01:39,708 --> 01:01:41,583
-[J.D.] I'm done with her.
-Don't be stupid.

1002
01:01:41,666 --> 01:01:44,666
We can't leave her here.
She's got no place to go.

1003
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:46,583
-You keep defending her.
-I'm not!

1004
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:49,791
She was worse to you than anybody.
Now she's making you feel guilty.

1005
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,333
Just like she did with Mamaw.

1006
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:56,208
You don't know everything, J.D.

1007
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:59,208
She's been doing this
since we were kids, Lindsay. Come on.

1008
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:02,833
Well, it didn't start with her.

1009
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:08,750
Mom and Aunt Lori,
they had it worse than us.

1010
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:11,250
It was a war in that house.

1011
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:14,916
[Mamaw] Beverly, hide your sister
in the closet! Go on!

1012
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,125
-[Papaw] Shut up!
-[Mamaw] What kinda man are you?

1013
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:21,125
You come home drunk one more time,
I'm gonna light your ass on fire!

1014
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,791
[Papaw] I'll come home
whenever I goddamn please!

1015
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:26,750
[Mamaw] Get out, you drunk asshole!
[groans]

1016
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:28,875
-Shut your mouth! See what happens!
-[Mamaw] Stop!

1017
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,708
Stop it! Get out!

1018
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:35,875
You goddamn son of a bitch.
You're lying there in your own piss!

1019
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:38,750
I told you what I was gonna do!

1020
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:43,375
-[gasps]
-[Papaw screaming in pain]

1021
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:44,833
[Mamaw] This is your own doing!

1022
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:47,291
You're no goddamn father!

1023
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:50,291
[Papaw continues screaming]

1024
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,208
I can't defend her…

1025
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:19,500
but I'm trying to forgive her.

1026
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:26,791
If you don't, you're never gonna get out
of what you're trying to get out of.

1027
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:02,583
[J.D. sighs]

1028
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:12,125
Mom, this is…

1029
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,208
This is my girlfriend. This is Usha.

1030
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,166
What is she?

1031
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,125
She's Indian.

1032
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,250
[chuckles]

1033
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:30,375
Well, she's really pretty.

1034
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:32,625
I think you'd like her a lot.

1035
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,333
You should bring her here.

1036
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:41,750
I've been doing real good.

1037
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:46,000
I've been working,
trying to get my license back. I…

1038
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:50,625
I just had a down…

1039
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:53,666
you know, month.

1040
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,666
[breath trembling]

1041
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,958
I got an interview tomorrow, Mom.

1042
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:08,458
-Otherwise, I'd--
-Yeah.

1043
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:11,250
[Bev sniffles]

1044
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,416
You sure you don't wanna stay here?

1045
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,000
-I got you the bed.
-Oh, no.

1046
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,708
Just take me to Ray's.

1047
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:21,375
-Mom, come on.
-Oh, you know me.

1048
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,750
I always land on my feet.

1049
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:32,416
Congratulate me, why don't you?
I'm a married woman.

1050
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,000
You're getting married?

1051
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,958
I got married. [laughs]

1052
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:38,666
Well?

1053
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:41,375
Aren't you happy for me? Hello?

1054
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,041
Why didn't you tell anybody?

1055
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:47,291
-I thought you two were gonna break up.
-I didn't marry Matt.

1056
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:48,500
I married Ken.

1057
01:05:48,583 --> 01:05:49,666
What?

1058
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,083
Who the hell's Ken?

1059
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:53,916
My boss at the dialysis center.

1060
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:57,500
Ugh. Kiss my ruby-red asshole.
When'd all this happen?

1061
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:58,791
[Bev] It's been going on.

1062
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:01,750
Anyway, it's been over
with Matt for a while.

1063
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,291
It's over with Matt?

1064
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:06,250
Well, obviously. I married somebody else.

1065
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,583
[chair thuds]

1066
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,958
[pop song playing in distance]

1067
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:25,875
This is a kitchen with kitchen stuff.

1068
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:28,583
And…

1069
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:32,583
this was a kegerator when we moved in.

1070
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:35,375
Yeah, I wanted to keep it, but… [chuckles]

1071
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,416
We keep sodas there now.

1072
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:43,541
Hey, I'm sorry about your dog.

1073
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,000
You know, I can't breathe.
It's the dander.

1074
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:50,291
Hey, let me show you your room.

1075
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:51,916
Over here.

1076
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:57,958
This is Travis.

1077
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:00,041
Uh, Travis, this is J.D.

1078
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,791
[video game playing]

1079
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:04,750
[Ken] Settle in.

1080
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:17,958
[Travis] You wanna see something?

1081
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,750
My dad smokes all the time.
He doesn't know I take it.

1082
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:26,500
He keeps it in here.

1083
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:30,291
Wanna get high?

1084
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,458
What? You never smoked?

1085
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:40,375
[J.D.] It's a gateway drug.

1086
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,916
-My mom's in recovery--
-Chickenshit!

1087
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:46,416
What do they do where you come from, hmm?

1088
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:48,958
-Whippits?
-No.

1089
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:52,958
[Travis] Come on! It's no big deal.

1090
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:55,708
-You gotta loosen up a bit, man.
-I, uh…

1091
01:07:55,791 --> 01:07:58,166
[Travis] You just gotta go for it.
Come on.

1092
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,125
[J.D.] I gotta go.

1093
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:01,083
-Maybe next time.
-Pussy!

1094
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:17,083
I'm Joie Chen. Coming up, reaction to
our interview with Iran's new president.

1095
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:19,916
-[Bev] J.D., I've been looking for you.
-[door closes]

1096
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,625
I need you to piss in this.

1097
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:26,083
I got a call from the nursing board.
I have to give them a sample today.

1098
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:27,583
-A sample?
-Clean piss.

1099
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:30,333
Mamaw's got
100 prescriptions in hers, so--

1100
01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:31,500
Why isn't yours clean?

1101
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:34,666
Just do it. Okay?

1102
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:37,541
-Why isn't yours clean?
-Come on now. Go do it!

1103
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:39,583
-No!
-Please!

1104
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,250
[Bev] Look…

1105
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,500
[voice breaks] I know that I messed up.

1106
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:55,500
I've been trying
really hard with Ken, but it just…

1107
01:08:57,083 --> 01:09:01,250
It isn't easy, and…
I promise that I'm gonna do better,

1108
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,750
but I can't lose my job.

1109
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:06,333
-You should've thought of that before.
-I know. I really need this.

1110
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:08,916
No! If you want clean piss,
stop fucking up your life

1111
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,583
and get it from your own bladder!

1112
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:12,416
What is going on down here?

1113
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,916
She wants my piss because hers is dirty.

1114
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,708
It's for the nursing board!

1115
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:25,333
[breathes deeply]

1116
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:41,791
J.D., you need to help your mama on this.

1117
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:48,666
You let her get away with this every time.
How is she gonna learn?

1118
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,291
I told you I would do better.

1119
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:52,875
-You always say that! You're lying!
-I always try!

1120
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:53,833
J.D.--

1121
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:57,791
If you'd put your foot down years ago,
she wouldn't be like this! She wouldn't!

1122
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:00,875
You're a shitty mom and so are you!

1123
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:01,958
[J.D. sniffles]

1124
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,916
[loud slamming]

1125
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:13,708
[ball slamming]

1126
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:19,291
-[Mamaw] J.D.
-What?

1127
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:24,041
[Mamaw] You may be right
about some of what you said.

1128
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:29,000
But things haven't exactly
worked out for your mama.

1129
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:30,583
[panting]

1130
01:10:31,916 --> 01:10:34,041
We can't let them take her license.

1131
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:36,916
Why? It's her own stupid fault.

1132
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:41,833
I know this ain't right, honey,
but she's your mother.

1133
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:45,541
And maybe
if we help her this one last time,

1134
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:48,791
she'll finally
learn her lesson and keep her job.

1135
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:51,083
Why can't we let her
clean her own mess up?

1136
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:55,166
'Cause family is the only thing
that means a goddamn.

1137
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:58,791
You'll learn that.

1138
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:05,750
Mamaw, I wanna stay with you.

1139
01:11:08,166 --> 01:11:09,333
Can I stay?

1140
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,916
Can't do that.
We're not gonna do that to her.

1141
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:17,416
But you always got me.

1142
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,458
Now…

1143
01:11:21,875 --> 01:11:23,250
do this for her.

1144
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:32,208
[door opens, closes]

1145
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:54,291
[train horn blaring]

1146
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:02,916
Mamaw!

1147
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:07,083
Mamaw!

1148
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,166
Mamaw!

1149
01:12:18,791 --> 01:12:20,541
-[Mamaw coughs]
-Mamaw!

1150
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:24,041
-[wheezing]
-Are you okay? Say something!

1151
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:25,833
[J.D. cries] Oh, no!

1152
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:28,083
Shit!

1153
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,375
-Mamaw?
-Hmm.

1154
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:46,541
Are you gonna die?

1155
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:52,500
-What the hell are you asking me that for?
-They said you have pneumonia.

1156
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:55,208
People can die from pneumonia.

1157
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:58,291
-Are you trying to kill me off?
-I know you know.

1158
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,083
People know.

1159
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:04,208
What kind of feather-brained idea is that?
Who knows they're gonna die?

1160
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:07,916
People do. Like… Native Americans.

1161
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:12,291
They're called "Indians."
Like the Cleveland Indians,

1162
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:14,916
and they don't know
more than other people.

1163
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:18,958
They're not magic
just 'cause they don't have microwaves.

1164
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:20,333
Just tell me!

1165
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:23,375
-I don't know.
-Are you gonna die now?

1166
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:24,916
You mean right now?

1167
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,416
[sighs] Are you gonna come home
from this hospital?

1168
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:32,416
I just told you, I don't goddamn know.

1169
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,583
Fine. Just go ahead and die.

1170
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:37,458
Oh, J.D.

1171
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,250
You might think
that algebra is jail, but it's not.

1172
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:47,083
It's freedom. Boil it down.

1173
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:50,166
Balance. If it's good on the left,
it's good on the right.

1174
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:53,791
-Boil it down. B-I-D.
-[bell rings]

1175
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:57,583
All right, next week, quadratic equations.
Bum-bum-bum.

1176
01:13:58,166 --> 01:14:01,375
We'll be putting
those graphing calculators to use, so,

1177
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:03,791
if you don't have one, go get one.

1178
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:05,708
J.D.

1179
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:13,250
You're gonna need
a parent's signature on that.

1180
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:19,083
You're gonna fail if you keep this up.

1181
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,000
I think you're smarter than that.

1182
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,375
["Metal on Metal" playing]

1183
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:46,791
-[Travis] Do it, man!
-[Doug] That's it. Under the shirt.

1184
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,916
-Breathe in. There you go.
-[Travis] Oh!

1185
01:14:49,416 --> 01:14:52,500
-[Doug] Stand up.
-No!

1186
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:54,333
All right, one foot. One foot.

1187
01:14:54,416 --> 01:14:56,250
[all] One foot, one foot, one foot.

1188
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:58,541
-[Doug] There you go.
-[Louis] Oh, shit!

1189
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:01,666
[Frank] Hey, check it out.

1190
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:12,500
Aren't you gonna work, man?

1191
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:16,333
[scoffs] Nah, dude. I quit.

1192
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:18,291
[Travis] Why?

1193
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:23,250
They fired Cheyenne. Said she
missed too many days or some shit.

1194
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,625
[Frank] There you go, Pee-Wee.

1195
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:29,208
It was all 'cause she was puking, mostly,
but that was just the first three months.

1196
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,000
Three months of what? [chuckles]

1197
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,500
She's pregnant, idiot.

1198
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:35,250
[Doug] Guy's such an asshole.

1199
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:38,458
Always bitching at me
to take shorter bathroom breaks.

1200
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:41,250
Anyway,
the guy fucked me out of a week's pay.

1201

-Get a fuckin' name, Trent!

I was thinkin' about going over there.

1204

Fuck shit up.

1205
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,666
How are we gonna get out there?

1206
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:55,333

Come on. Let's go.

-Come on, man!
-What are you waitin' for?

1216

[J.D.] Are you sure he's here?

1224
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:04,083
Well, where else would he be?
He hasn't worked since 2007.

1225
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:07,791
He inherited the top floor of this dump.
Thinks he's a land baron.

-The hell?

-Get down and talk to me, motherfucker!
-It's none of your goddamn business, boy!

You ain't even got any of your teeth.

Don't call my mom a whore,

I ever did in my life worth shit.

I don't know how you got so far.

They all coulda,
or he coulda gone to jail.

1259
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:01,958
He needed me
and I just kept leaving him there.

1260
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:04,708
What he needed was his damn mother.

1261
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:07,458
I just kept running off with Kevin.

1262
01:20:08,291 --> 01:20:10,791
Didn't even ask him if he wanted to come.

1263
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:15,458
Aw, honey, you got a right
to your own life.

1264
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:18,208

Why did J.D. think you was going
to kill him? What'd you do to him?

1271
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:49,750
Nothing. He said some shit. I got mad--

1272
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:51,666
-Did you hit him?
-It's not serious.

1273
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:53,708
Should I have let him get hit by a car?

1274
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:56,916
-If he wasn't being a little shit--
-You've always got a reason!

1275
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,666
It's always someone else's fault.

1276
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:01,916
Some point,
you're gonna have to take responsibility

1277
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
-or someone else is gonna have to…
-Or what?

1278
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:06,666
-…step in!
-Who, huh? Who?

1279
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:08,833
You?

1280
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,208

[Bev] Hey.

1284
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:20,000
Hello? What are you doing?

1285
01:22:22,166 --> 01:22:23,166
Mom?

1286
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:24,750
[Ken] What is she doing here, hon?

1287
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:27,750
I don't know.

1288
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:33,791
Get your stuff.

1289
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:39,375
I don't give a rat fart
what you're smoking, kid.

1290
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:43,166
If you think you're hiding it, honey,
you're dumb as a bag of hair.

1291
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,750
-Pack up.
-For what?

1292
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:45,958
What are you doing?

1293
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:49,250
-[panting] I'm taking him.
-Where?

1294
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:50,750
[Mamaw] To live with me.

1295
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:54,791
If you got a problem with that,
you can talk to the barrel of my gun.

1296
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:59,125
-[Bev] You can't just come in--
-He's gettin' in trouble. He's in trouble.

1297
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,250
-He's a teenager.
-It's not just that.

1298
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:04,666
He needs somebody to pay some
fucking attention before it's too late.

1299
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:07,958
What do you think I've been doing, huh?
I got us into this new house,

1300
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:10,875
-good new school--
-He coulda gone to jail, Beverly.

1301
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:16,000
He's got loser friends and he's gonna be
a loser if somebody don't do something.

1302
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:19,291
No, he's not, and you can't take him
because he's not yours.

1303
01:23:19,375 --> 01:23:20,541
He might as well be.

1304
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:21,500
I want to go.

1305
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:27,750
You want to go?

1306
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:29,958
And live with her?

1307
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:37,916
She's crazy, you know that.
She's been crazy my whole life.

1308
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,750
If you wanna live
with that crazy old witch, go right ahead.

1309
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:42,541
You two were made for each other.

1310
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:52,208
Go on. Get your stuff.

1311
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:07,125
Hey, Lindsay. Sorry to bother you at work.
I've been calling you.

1312
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,583
I couldn't get ahold of you.

1313
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:12,250
Mom's not staying at Ray's.
'Cause she can't.

1314
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:16,791
Big surprise. Guy's a piece of shit.

1315
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:18,250
Tell me about it.

1316
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:20,958
-Where is she at?
-She's out by the car.

1317
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,583
I'm trying to think of, uh…

1318
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:27,291
I don't know. I was wondering if…

1319
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:31,375
She can't stay with us.

1320
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:35,000

01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:52,375
-Please, stop it!
-[screaming] No!

1493
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:53,500
[Bev wailing]

1494
01:38:56,666 --> 01:38:57,750
Christ, Mom!

1495
01:38:57,833 --> 01:38:59,375
[Bev crying]

1496
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:00,666
[Bev screams]

1497
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,041
What's wrong with you, Mom? Come on!

1498
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:18,625
-Mom, I--
-Don't you touch me!

1499
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:21,000
You get away from me! Bastard!

1500
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:29,500
[Bev crying]

1501
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:41,791
Christ.

1502
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:48,250
-Let's get you to bed.
-I'm so sorry, baby.

1503
01:39:48,333 --> 01:39:49,916
-I know, Mom.
-I'm so sorry.

1504
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,166
I know, Mom. It's okay.

1505
01:39:57,833 --> 01:39:59,750
-[mumbles]
-I know, Mom.

1506
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:06,625
[Bev sobbing]

1507
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:23,375
[sighs]

1508
01:40:33,833 --> 01:40:35,291
[Bev] Stay with me.

1509
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:52,541
[sniffles]

1510
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,375
[no audible dialogue]

1511
01:41:14,791 --> 01:41:17,000
[no audible dialogue]

1512
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,791
[J.D.] "For now we see
through a glass darkly,

1513
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:41,916
but then face-to-face.

1514
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,333
Now I know in part,

1515
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:47,125
then shall I know
even as also I am known."

1516
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,875
Get the surp.

1517
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:06,583
-Get the what?
-The surp.

1518
01:42:07,625 --> 01:42:09,333
Can't have pancakes without surp.

1519
01:42:09,416 --> 01:42:12,500
Oh, my God, J.D.
It's not "surp," it's "syrup."

1520
01:42:12,583 --> 01:42:13,708
-Surp.
-Syrup.

1521
01:42:13,791 --> 01:42:15,000
[laughing] Oh, God.

1522
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:17,166
-If you think that--
-You're so cute!

1523
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,791
If you think this is so…

1524
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:21,375
-We're not gonna be able to eat. Usha.
-Say it again.

1525
01:42:21,458 --> 01:42:22,291
-Syrup.
-Surp.

1526
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:24,375
If I say it, will you get the damn surp?

1527
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:25,458
-Say it again.
-Surp.

1528
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:26,791
-Surp.
-Now please…

1529
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:27,958
[both laugh]

1530
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,041
I love you, Mom.

1531
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:55,416
I want you to get better.

1532
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,958
-I know.
-For you to be happy.

1533
01:43:01,125 --> 01:43:02,250
And I'll help you.

1534
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:04,375
I'll do everything I can.

1535
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,500
But I can't stay.

1536
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:17,583
I'm not saving anyone here.

1537
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:24,083
Lindsay's on her way.

1538
01:43:27,083 --> 01:43:29,166
I really hope you'll wait for her.

1539
01:43:30,625 --> 01:43:31,708
[Bev sobbing softly]

1540
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:34,875
But I have to go.

1541
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:18,875
Don't give up, Mom.

1542
01:44:23,541 --> 01:44:24,541
[door closes]

1543
01:44:29,416 --> 01:44:30,833
[exhales deeply]

1544
01:45:09,583 --> 01:45:13,291
[cell phone vibrating]

1545
01:45:16,208 --> 01:45:17,125
Hey.

1546
01:45:17,208 --> 01:45:18,750
[J.D. sighs] Hey.

1547
01:45:19,291 --> 01:45:20,333
Where are you?

1548
01:45:20,916 --> 01:45:21,750
I'm driving.

1549
01:45:22,375 --> 01:45:23,250
Back?

1550
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:25,083
Yeah.

1551
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:31,083
Yeah. uh…

1552
01:45:32,625 --> 01:45:35,416
Look, Usha, I'm… I'm sorry.

1553
01:45:36,416 --> 01:45:41,708
I'm sorry I didn't just come out
and tell you all this stuff before. Uh…

1554
01:45:43,208 --> 01:45:46,583
Guess I was just worried
that I'd scare you off.

1555
01:45:51,041 --> 01:45:52,000
Did I?

1556
01:45:54,791 --> 01:45:55,875
Not even close.

1557
01:45:58,833 --> 01:45:59,916
Where are you now?

1558
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,250
Uh, comin' up on Columbus.

1559
01:46:03,333 --> 01:46:07,000
Columbus? Unless you drive
like hell, you're not gonna make it.

1560
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:11,375
I survived Tactical Driving
in the Marines, okay? I can handle I-70.

1561
01:46:11,458 --> 01:46:13,750
Okay. I'm keeping you company.

1562
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:17,041
No, babe. Just go back to sleep.
Please, it's late.

1563
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:18,916
Nope. We're doin' this.

1564
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:22,875
Let's see, uh…

1565
01:46:24,333 --> 01:46:25,375
So, um…

1566
01:46:26,416 --> 01:46:28,125
Read any good books lately?

1567
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:32,416
Yeah. Yeah, Cases and Materials
on Statutory Interpretation.

1568
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:34,125
Oh, sounds hot.

1569
01:46:34,208 --> 01:46:35,833
[chuckles] It's a best seller.

1570
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:44,166
In boot camp, the only way you're allowed
to talk to your family is with letters.

1571
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:47,541
And my family, they--
yeah, they wrote me every day.

1572
01:46:48,583 --> 01:46:51,500
Mamaw's letters were just the greatest.

1573
01:46:52,125 --> 01:46:56,166
She would go from,
"Jesus walks with you, J.D. Stay strong.

1574
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:58,791
Don't forget that." To, uh… [laughs]

1575
01:46:59,375 --> 01:47:03,958
"I wish I had a gun so I could shoot
that dickhead drill sergeant of yours."

1576
01:47:04,041 --> 01:47:05,041
[chuckles]

1577
01:47:09,958 --> 01:47:11,083
[horn honks]

1578
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:14,500
[J.D.] My grandparents just
left everything they knew behind

1579
01:47:14,583 --> 01:47:18,000
and started over
with what they could fit in Papaw's truck.

1580
01:47:18,083 --> 01:47:19,750
Yeah.

1581
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:22,083
That's… that's like my dad.

1582
01:47:22,958 --> 01:47:24,500
He came here with nothing.

1583
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,208
He had to just find his way.

1584
01:47:34,458 --> 01:47:37,375
I think that's
what kills me the most about Mamaw.

1585
01:47:39,791 --> 01:47:42,166
I never got to tell people, uh…

1586
01:47:43,083 --> 01:47:45,416
just how much she meant to me.

1587
01:47:48,708 --> 01:47:50,625
She'd been sick a long time,

1588
01:47:50,708 --> 01:47:52,750
but when it happened, I couldn't…

1589
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:53,916
[sniffles]

1590
01:47:57,541 --> 01:48:01,500
[voice breaks] Yeah, I couldn't, like,
believe she was actually gone.

1591
01:48:02,833 --> 01:48:04,250
Wish I could have met her.

1592
01:48:06,416 --> 01:48:07,500
Yeah, me, too.

1593
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:14,125
[chuckles] Yeah.

1594
01:48:19,458 --> 01:48:20,500
Where are you now?

1595
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:23,916
I had to get off I-95
because the traffic was so bad.

1596
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,250
I'm on some side street.
I'll be there in about an hour.

1597
01:48:28,208 --> 01:48:29,291
An hour?

1598
01:48:30,125 --> 01:48:32,250
-You're not gonna make it.
-I know.

1599
01:48:32,333 --> 01:48:33,791
I don't know what to do, Usha.

1600
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:36,791
Can you go down there
and tell him I'm on my way, please?

1601
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:40,750
Yeah, yes, I can do that.

1602
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:43,291
Okay, I'll call you right back.

1603
01:48:43,375 --> 01:48:45,291
Okay? It's gonna be fine. Drive safe.

1604
01:49:03,833 --> 01:49:06,166
[J.D.] Twice I've needed to be rescued.

1605
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:09,875
The first time it was Mamaw who saved me.

1606
01:49:11,083 --> 01:49:12,250
[woman] J.D. Vance?

1607
01:49:12,333 --> 01:49:13,166
Yeah.

1608
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:15,666
[J.D.] The second,
it was what she taught me.

1609
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,875
That where we come from is who we are,

1610
01:49:17,958 --> 01:49:20,875
but we choose every day who we become.

1611
01:49:21,791 --> 01:49:25,166
My family's not perfect,
but they made me who I am

1612
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:27,625
and gave me chances that they never had.

1613
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:32,083
My future,
whatever it is, is our shared legacy.

1614
01:49:33,083 --> 01:49:34,375
Good to see you again.

1615
01:49:34,458 --> 01:49:35,458
Thank you.

1616
01:49:36,333 --> 01:49:37,583
I'm glad to be here.
