Yeah.

146

Good.

147
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,180
Better get in his good books
         soon or else...

Or else what?

149
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,084
Just go, be a nice guy,

So we have more time to travel.

Mm-hmm. More time
     for family. Been nice.

Hmm, no, not at the moment.

You remember Michael, right?

Uh, yeah. Hi.

Mya's in her second year
          at Georgetown.

She's going to be able to run
    the company in no time.

Alright, that's wishful
      thinking on my part.

        go to Stanford?

-Uh, yeah, she does.
      -Yeah, that's right.

288
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,713
And when you were there
        over the summer,

289
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,214
did you get to check out
           the campus?

290
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,550
Yeah, it's really nice.

291
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,953
So, Michael, whatever happened

292
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,522
to that girl that
       you were seeing?

293
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,657
Isabella.

294
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,059
We still keep in touch.

295
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:32,763
You were seeing each other
       for a long time, no?

296
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,298
Few years, yeah.

297
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,200
What happened? She wanted kids?

298
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,254
She's doing just fine.

299
00:25:40,255 --> 00:25:42,305
Well, you do want to get married
 and have kids one day though,

300
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,158
right?

301
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,009
Whoa, easy on the poor guy,
       he just got here.

302
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,645
It's okay, it's fine.

303
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,614
I guess anything can happen.

304
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,551
I'm sure
  if the right woman comes along

305
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,586
you'll be standing right next
 to her at the aisle one day.

306
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:57,888
Well,

307
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,126
right now I'm just enjoying
        the single life.

308
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,895
And you've always
         been that way.

309
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,801
So what made you decide to come
this way after all these years?

310
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:13,170
Well, that's just it, isn't it?

311
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,973
Time goes by
   and well before you know it,

312
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,610
it can be very unforgiving.

313
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,079
This doesn't stop, does it?

314
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,782
We keep getting older and time
    just doesn't give a damn.

315
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,116
I know it does not.

316
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,953
Except for Mya here.
  Time's certainly on your side.

317
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,120
I'm okay.

318
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,258
Although it does depend

319
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,226
what we do with our time
       though, doesn't it?

320
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:39,063
It certainly doesn't stop
 when the clock stops ticking.

321
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,197
How so?

322
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,633
In the physical sense, I mean,

323
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,269
of course, our bodies die,
           eventually,

324
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,704
but our souls never die,

325
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:48,906
we carry on

326
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,640
and we either go
up there or to the other place.

327
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:54,612
Hmm. I guess we never
     really do know, do we?

328
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:56,947
Hmm.

329
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,618
So, no kids, not into marriage,

330
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,188
would you say
you're a religious man, Michael?

331
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,322
You don't have to answer that.

332
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,193
No, I'm not.

333
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,329
Okay.

334
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,731
I don't think Michael shares

335
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,199
the same views
      on this one, honey.

336
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,702
That's okay. We don't have
   to all be on the same page

337
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:19,870
at the same time.

338
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:20,904
True.

339
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,375
Doesn't one get lonely

340
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:26,310
without God
     in their life though?

341
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,381
I suppose if you believed
      in God or religion,

342
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:31,982
that could be true, yes.

343
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,219
Well, even
   if you don't believe in Him,

344
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,420
God does believe in you.

345
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:41,358
Alright, I think I hear God
telling us to pick a new topic.

346
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,028
I think people spend too much
  time and energy on religion

347
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,764
and not enough time
   on practical common sense.

348
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:51,969
One can never spend
 too much time with God, honey.

349
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:55,072
It's our belief in God
  that keeps us safe and strong.

350
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,374
Yeah, unless, of course,

351
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,843
you don't believe
      in God or religion.

352
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:04,081
And faith is what gives us
         a moral compass

353
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,315
which gives us peace

354
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,850
and the freedom
     to do the right thing

355
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:09,186
without worrying
 about what some people think.

356
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,789
In fact, it's true believers

357
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,791
who are more likely
     to do the right thing

358
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,259
and be good citizens, right?

359
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,928
I believe quite
     the opposite actually.

360
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,165
Charity, feeding the poor,

361
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,000
providing hope
     for those who have none.

362
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,334
We can still do all those things

363
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,103
without believing
        in fairy tales.

364
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,007
No, come on, Michael.

365
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,842
You can't compare
       believing in God

366
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,711
to believing in fairy tales.

367
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,979
If you were raised
      in India or let's--

368
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,082
I don't know, say Syria,
would you believe in the Bible?

369
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,384
I don't know,
     I wasn't raised there.

370
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:44,254
The point is we believe
   what our parents teach us,

371
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,056
what we were taught as children.

372
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:50,060
That's a poor way to look
 at God, though, and religion.

373
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,197
You should read the Bible.

374
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,499
You might learn something.
     It might enlighten you.

375
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,267
The world is
     so connected nowadays

376
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,069
it's easy to see
        what's going on.

377
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,905
Religion is the cause
   of way too many problems.

378
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,508
It's all there,
 it's written in the scripture.

379
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,310
It's there to guide us
         on our journeys.

380
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:07,878
I have read the Bible,
           by the way,

381
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,914
and we really don't believe
 it should be taken literally,

382
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,866
do we?

383
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,817
Of course, it's God's Word
       to us, to the world.

384
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,354
But that's exactly
   what radical Islamists feel.

385
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,757
Oh, no, no, no,

386
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,192
they don't believe in God,
   they believe in pure evil.

387
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,827
No, they believe like you do,

388
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,763
that certain passages
         in their book

389
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:27,865
should be taken literally.

390
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:33,070
The Bible as we know it
       cannot be compared

391
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:36,373
to what those uncivilized,
        uneducated people

392
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,775
call a religion.

393
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:40,144
That would be ridiculous.

394
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:44,281
If a woman has sex
      before she is married,

395
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,849
the men in the city
         have the right

396
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,284
to stone her to death?

397
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,236
No.

398
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:51,187
And what did Jesus say
      when He was presented
        with the adulterer

399
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,956
before the men
     were going to stone her?

400
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,093
He said let he
        who is without sin

401
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:57,394
cast the first stone.

402
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,796
That's right.

403
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:00,998
But if this Bible
      is the perfect book,

404
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,967
written by the perfect being,
              God,

405
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,969
then why is it in there
         to begin with?

406
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,538
These are things
        that non-believers

407
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,508
try to argue to create
   contradictions in the Bible.

408
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,211
If we're meant
   to take the Bible literally,

409
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,513
then why did Jesus
         come down after

410
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:20,818
to correct God, who is
     His dad, who is Himself?

411
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,154
You have to read
      both the Old Testament
      and the New Testament.

412
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,490
And we know God works
      in mysterious ways.

413
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:31,862
Some of the most dangerous
        words ever spoken.

414
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:36,100
Wow.

415
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,068
Michael, I didn't know
     you're so into religion.

416
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:39,603
No, I'm not.

417
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,139
I just like to consider myself

418
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,908
a simple common sense
          kind of guy.

419
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,612
The most dangerous words
           ever spoken.

420
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,153
James, would you mind getting us
    another bottle of wine?

421
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,955
Allow me, please.

422
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,425
Saved by the bell, huh.

423
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,493
Well, I'm just trying
     to make myself useful.

424
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,029
I'm just gonna make sure
  he doesn't steal something.

425
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,464
You do that, honey.

426
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:12,202
And the nerve of him
           in our home.

427
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,971
I told you

428
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,405
not to bring up religion
         around Michael.

429
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,357
He's always been this way.

430
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:19,308
So what are we doing?
 Are we hiding what's right now

431
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,379
because he's your college buddy?

432
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,448
I know, I'm on your side.

433
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,483
But we can't force people

434
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,418
to share the same values
          that we have.

435
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,431
Mya and I
     can take care of this.

436
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,369
Let's have a drink
  in the games room, Michael.

437
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,417
So when did you start
     hating on your faith?

438
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,439
Hating?

439
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,656
Okay, I don't know
    what you're talking about.

440
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,126
Cut the bullshit.

441
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,927
You're taking Michael's side
       and he's an atheist.

442
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,064
I'm not taking anyone's side.
   I believe what I believe.

443
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,632
You've gone to church
        your whole life,

444
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,401
you go to Georgetown,
     for crying out loud,

445
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:19,336
and now you're acting
    like you've never heard
        of any of this.

446
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,239
What's going on with you?

447
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,275
I grew up, I got educated.

448
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,979
Honestly, mom, I stopped
believing in religion years ago.

449
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,982
Well, this is the first
       I've heard of it.

450
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,985
And the way
 you were talking at the table

451
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,688
is so disappointing.

452
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:40,691
Yeah, I kept it from you

453
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:43,026
because I knew it'd be
    an issue with you and dad.

454
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,497
Michael's wrong and so are you.

455
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:49,366
Okay.

456
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:52,135
Well, we all have
       our own opinions.

457
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,971
Oh, that's ridiculous.

458
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,038
Why?

459
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:57,207
'Cause I don't agree with you?

460
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,609
Okay, let me tell you something.

461
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,145
When the day comes
    when you really need help,

462
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,413
you know you'll pray
          to God, right?

463
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,649
And it's always
         the naysayers

464
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,352
who, when heaven forbid
    something does go wrong,

465
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,454
there they are
       asking for His help.

466
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,723
And they'd better hope
that He still has faith in them

467
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,358
because that time will come.

468
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,628
I'm not sure what this
     has to do with anything.

469
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,566
I guess I'll be judged
       when that day comes.

470
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:32,609
Listen, I'm sorry
      about that in there.

471
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:33,777
I hope it--

472
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,397
I didn't come off too harsh.

473
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:38,382
Don't worry about it.
  Look, I knew it was coming.

474
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:41,251
Just glad
that we got over it so quickly.

475
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:43,387
And she'll get over it.

476
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,489
I'm glad you're here.

477
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:48,291
I know I sound
  like a broken record but...

478
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:52,896
...it's been way too long.

479
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,130
I was surprised that you
  actually reached out to me.

480
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,601
Well, we get so preoccupied
       with work and life

481
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,537
and next thing you know,
      seven years passes by.

482
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,505
Wow.

483
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:03,206
Seven years.

484
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,475
Holy smokes.

485
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,209
You knowm the last time
 I saw you, Mya was just a kid.

486
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:10,614
Now she's a full-grown woman.
    She's got her own life.

487
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,517
It's just amazing.

488
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,120
She's a very beautiful woman,
            indeed.

489
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,222
You're very lucky.

490
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,058
Well,

491
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,593
as they say, at least I did
        something right.

492
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:24,795
That's for damn sure.

493
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,401
Listen, there's something
 I wanted to talk to you about.

494
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:34,171
Yeah.

495
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,339
Sure. What is it?

496
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:38,508
[Barbara] James!

497
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,511
Hold that thought.

498
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,285
I need you to get more stuff
    from the store for dinner.

499
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,287
Oh, I can get whatever we need.

500
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,122
No, no, you relax,
         enjoy yourself.

501
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:55,125
No, I insist.
   Besides, I like to drive.

502
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,560
[Barbara]
  Well, I'll write you a list.

503
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,628
I'll help. I can go with him.

504
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,097
No, you don't have to do that.

505
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,298
I want to.

506
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,701
Alright, Michael.
     Mind if Mya helps out?

507
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,771
Okay, sure.

508
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,406
Yeah. I'll go get you some cash.

509
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:13,176
No, no, I'll take care of it.
   I'm just getting my coat.

510
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:16,246
-Mya, you know where to find it?
             -Yeah.

511
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:18,281
Take your time, no rush.

512
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,362
[rock music
     playing on the radio]

513
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:48,778
Can you pull over?

514
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:51,515
Pull over? Why?

515
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,583
Can you-- do you mind
       just pulling over?

516
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,832
Everything alright?

517
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:28,885
That was nice.

518
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,801
Couldn't resist. Good deal.

519
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,270
You? No.

520
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,306
No, my parents.

521
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,576
Right. I did try.

522
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:56,279
My mom is so mad.

523
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,949
I know. It's not very good
      for our cause, is it?

524
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:02,385
No. No, it's fine.

525
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,957
It's okay. We will tell them
        when we get back.

526
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,827
Okay.
  It's the right thing to do.

527
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:13,296
Yeah.

528
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:14,864
Just need
    a few more drinks first.

529
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,666
Yes.

530
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,903
Okay, I have an idea.

531
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,305
What's that?

532
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,414
Yo, you alright?

533
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,286
Can I ask you a question, man?

534
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,856
Where are you going?
What are you running from, bro?

535
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,594
You didn't even notice them
      back there, did you?

536
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,746
Notice what?

537
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:48,897
Those two racist hit
      motherfuckers, man.

You think
   I didn't notice that shit?

541
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:59,776
You think I'd let
   these racist motherfuckers

542
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,877
get me down?

543
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,981
You know what gets me through?

544
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:06,449
My music.

545
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:11,021
My music brings me up,
        it keeps me high,

546
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,891
it keeps my mind going
        in a positive way.

00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:16,559
You know what I'm saying?

Positivity.

I'm gonna buy you a beer.

   of the greatest musicians
          of all time,

    I'm not stopping, alright?

     to meet the nice boys.

-Your old hangout.
              -Yeah.

559
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,073
[Mya] Thought we could use
        a temporary break.

560
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:04,841
[Michael] Sounds good.

561
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,746
I should have brought
         my cowboy hat.

00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:12,682
Where do you wanna sit?

Let's go back there.

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,852

        -[Michael] Yeah.

about prolonging the inevitable

I'll be right back.

-[Mya] Hey.
       -How is it going?

574
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,486
-Good.
       -What can I get you?

575
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:24,921
Just a couple of beers
            would do.

576
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,221
I don't know.

577
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,990
Buy a new home and tell them.

Like a young naive girl?

727
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:55,591
No, you're more mature
     than most people I know.

728
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:59,495
Like your students,
the only people you hang around?

729
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:03,732
No, like most people
        I know in general.

730

Okay. So,

and you like the way I talk.

Is that enough?

You are special for me.

You are to me.

-I like your lips.
       -What are you doing?

738
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:42,338
What are you doing?
           No, stop.

I like your neck.

Stop it.

So what do you do for work?

747

I used to drive a company truck.

748
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:30,619
Used to?

749
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,524

Not gonna believe you.

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,919
I did.

755
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:06,789
But she left.

756
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,626
Is that before or after
       you lost your job?

757
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:13,929
Today.

758
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:16,732
Man, that's
    some kicking in the ass

759
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:18,700
while you're down
       type of shit, man.

760
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:21,203
Don't worry about her, bro.

761
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:24,740
A girl leave you
 at a time like this, brother,

762
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:26,742
she not really worth anything.

763
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:29,611
I mean, that's what I think.

764
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:33,782
She's worth it, man.

765
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:42,858
You know, when we're happy,

766
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,160
we wake up and life is so good.

767
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:49,498
But when we're sad,
     shit not working out,

768
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,233
you won't even want
      to get out of bed.

769
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:57,172
It's like an ocean wave
         or some shit.

770
00:57:57,908 --> 00:57:59,641
You ride the wave.

771
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:03,512
But the wave comes crashing down

772
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:04,980
and you fall along

773
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:07,549
and you tread for a minute

774
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:10,486
and then you catch
          the next wave.

775
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:12,688
And you--

776
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:16,124
you just
    fell off the way, brother.

777
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:20,128
Just got to catch the next one.

778
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:24,199
Damn.

779
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:30,939
Man, do you always talk
  like this when you're high?

780
00:58:31,642 --> 00:58:35,077
It's just fucking killing
       my buzz, goddamn.

781
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,045
I philosophize when I'm high.

782
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:39,047
Welcome to the school of B.

783
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,685
Yeah, yeah, that's you.

784
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:44,753
Fuck you, man.

785
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,153
Oh...

786
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:27,996
[Ben] B!

787
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:31,733
Hey yo, B!

788
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:39,308
B!

789
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:50,686
Oh, shit.

790
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:55,958
Shit.

791
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:59,595
Oh, fuck!

792
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:10,839
Come on.

793
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:31,893
Hi.

794
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:33,795
Hi. Good morning.

795
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:36,632
-Coffee?
       -Yeah, perhaps some.

796
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:37,766
What are you reading?

797
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:39,868
The news.

798
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:51,279
[James] Good morning.

799
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:52,948
[Michael] Good morning.

800
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,049
[James] How did everybody sleep?

801
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:55,183
[Mya] Good.

802
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:56,685
[Michael] Well, thank you.

803
01:00:57,921 --> 01:01:01,023
So, what's
     on the agenda for today?

804
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:03,959
Uh, I actually was gonna
    ask you the same thing.

805
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:05,327
What are the options?

806
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,329
Well, we could head into town,

807
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,698
we could
     check out the old shops.

808
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:12,100
[James] Honey?

809
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:14,970
I want you to leave.

810
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,674
Hey, that's not funny.
     She doesn't mean that.

811
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:20,709
I want you to leave.

812
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:22,210
-[James] Honey
          -Right now.

813
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,713
-Excuse me, did I say something?
         -Don't speak.

814
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:26,281
Just get your things
     and get out of my house.

815
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,200
Mom, what is wrong with you?

816
01:01:28,201 --> 01:01:30,118
-We apologize
       for this, Michael.
       -[Barbara] Enough.

817
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,721
I want you to get
    your things and get out.

818
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,707
And I want you to go with him.

819
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,692
What has gotten into you?
 Look, enough of this nonsense.

820
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:37,959
[Michael] No, it's okay.

821
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,362
I think I understand.

822
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:42,097
I just saw you.

823
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,166
I saw both of you!

824
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,201
Mya?

825
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:51,774
Yeah, okay,

826
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:53,375
Michael and I are
       seeing each other,
        so fucking what?

827
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:58,914
[Michael] James.

828
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:02,818
I wanted to talk
        to you about it.

829
01:02:07,257 --> 01:02:10,125
Get out
    and don't you come back.

830
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,068
I'm sorry.

831
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,047
What the hell is going on?

832
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:36,284
Your daughter
      has lost her faith.

833
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,067
[Deb]
     Everything good, John?

834
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,368
Define good.

835
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,836
I'll have some more coffee, Deb.

836
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:55,871
Yeah.

837
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:06,014
[John] Thanks.

838
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,942
We stopped by the store,
         said hi to Sam.

839
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:37,212
-How is she?
          -Just good.

840
01:03:40,117 --> 01:03:41,049
[Deb] Coffees?

841
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:42,200
-Yeah.
             -Yeah.

842
01:03:42,201 --> 01:03:43,350
Can I have a slice
    of that apple pie, too?

843
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:44,419
[Deb] Okey-dokey.

844
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:47,088
No cream, right? Yourself?

845
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,890
No, I'm alright.

846
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:50,158
[Deb] Mm-hmm.

847
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:58,166
Well, the scrubs are out,
   you're not working today?

848
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:00,368
Scrubs?

849
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,903
[Tyler] Yeah, your work clothes.

850
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:03,238
Is that scrubs?

851
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:05,974
I just meant your uniform.

852
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,877
Well, if that's what you meant,
     why'd you say scrubs?

853
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:12,214
I don't know, just noticed
   you don't have them, is all.

854
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:13,915
I was just wondering

855
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:15,183
if you were working
         today or not.

856
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:17,886
Starting late, working late.

857
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:29,564
I'm assuming you'll be with Sam
    after she gets off work.

858
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:33,134
Yeah. I'm picking her up.

859
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,403
How's the house coming?

860
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:38,506
It's good. We're almost done.

861
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:40,475
Almost done?

862
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:42,510
Yeah, just a couple
    more things to the roof.

863
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,080
[John] What things are those?

864
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:47,249
-Just shingles and stuff.

865
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:50,418
Putting shingles on this week?

866
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:54,256
Oh, no, I got to replace
 some wood on the frame first.

867
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:57,125
So you're gonna
       replace some wood

868
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:59,261
on the frame of the house first?

869
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:03,098
Yeah. And once that is done,
  we can get the shingles on.

870
01:05:03,634 --> 01:05:05,033
You have the wood ready?

871
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:07,536
No, not yet,

872
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,571
just still trying to find
   the right type and stuff.

873
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,540
Stuff? What stuff?

874
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:18,013
Ah, well, just I got a measure
 where the old wood was and---

875
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:23,151
then find the new stuff and...

876
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,154
yeah, we'll just go out there
     and get it done, man.

877
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,957
Have you done the measurement?

878
01:05:29,993 --> 01:05:31,159
Not yet.

879
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,360
[John] Why not?

880
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,096
Just looking for somebody
          to do that.

881
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:37,065
You can't do it yourself?

882
01:05:46,677 --> 01:05:47,943
Who have you called?

883
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:53,248
I haven't called anyone yet.

884
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:54,348
But I'm gonna do that
   real soon. [clears throat]

885
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,185
Why haven't you called
           anyone yet?

886
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,424
I don't know, I just got busy
   with all the other stuff.

887
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:04,359
[John] Stuff?

888
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:06,995
What are you talking about?

889
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:12,067
I'm gonna get the shingles.

890
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:13,668
-[Kevin] And the wood.
       -Yeah, and the wood.

891
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:18,139
You just said seconds ago
 that you needed to find a guy

892
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,242
to measure the frame first,

893
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,211
right?

894
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:27,349
So you're not
      putting on shingles

895
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:29,284
or buying new wood yet, correct?

896
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,653
Well, no, but...

897
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,187
I'm gonna get someone
     to measure that frame.

898
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,223
Who are you gonna get?

899
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:42,230
[Kevin] An old guy.

900
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:44,632
Billy.

901
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:53,675
Now that you're here,

902
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:56,444
you two might as well
        learn something.

903
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,247
You can leave our shit alone.

904
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:01,516
Man, someone wanna take
    that motherfucker out.

905
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,318
That's the world we live in.

906
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,620
Well, thanks
    to some fucking nigger.

907
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:08,089
Terrorists run around here

908
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:09,524
and they want
     to take away our guns.

909
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,228
They aren't getting mine,
     that's for damn sure.

910
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:15,563
Did you vote?

911
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,699
[Kevin] Shit's rigged.

912
01:07:19,669 --> 01:07:21,069
Is that what you think?

913
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:25,206
Yeah.

914
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,410
To be a man,

915
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:31,079
you're gonna step up
         and do the work.

916
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:34,149
We're in a fight here.

917
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,051
It's us

918
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:39,220
versus them.

919
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,790
And better believe me,
     they got the numbers.

920
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,827
[John] So what are we
   gonna do to overcome them?

921
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:50,832
Can I get you guys
          anything else?

922
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:52,734
We're all good.

923
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:01,843
What's your plans with Sam?

924
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,414
What do you mean?

925
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:07,816
Long run,

926
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:10,752
planning on marriage, family?

927
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:12,821
Yeah, we want to.

928
01:08:15,092 --> 01:08:16,624
So what's the plan?

929
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:19,360
Well, I'm-- I'm--

930
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:21,863
I'm just gonna--

931
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,701
just gonna work
      on the house and...

932
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,306
yeah, maybe we plan
       for kids one day.

933
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:36,444
Well, Sam will be a good mother,
  no doubt about that, but...

934
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,114
how would you be a good father?

935
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,250
Well, I'm gonna do
       whatever it takes.

936
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:44,486
I'm gonna work real hard

937
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:47,255
and save up and all that stuff.

938
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:49,724
That's the easy part.

939
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:54,229
You've gotta get
      your shit together.

940
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:57,165
It's the things you do as a man

941
01:08:57,167 --> 01:09:01,536
to protect your family,
to protect what you believe in,

942
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:06,141
simple things like
you vote when it's time to vote.

943
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:14,315
You two must have things to do.

944
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:18,753
[John] Make sure you two
    have food in the fridge.

945
01:09:27,898 --> 01:09:30,465
Take it, buy something for Sam.

946
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:33,201
Appreciate it.

947
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:35,670
You're welcome.

948
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:39,440
Excellent pie and coffee.

949
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:40,875
[John] Not a problem.

950
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:45,880
Deb, check please.

951
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:47,749
You bet.

952
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:04,332
[Kevin] Thank fuck, that's done.

953
01:10:06,503 --> 01:10:07,702
Deb...

954
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,506
showing her titties once again.

955
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:16,544
I took her out last week.
     [his voice fades away]

956
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,223
[Kevin] Are we going?

957
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:38,666
[Ben] Yeah, wouldn't start.

958
01:10:42,272 --> 01:10:43,605
I told you.

959
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:48,576
I traded it in.

960
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:54,449
Yes, yes, I had
  to use the credit card, yes.

961
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:57,552
Or else I'll be stuck.
    What do you want me to do?

962
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,388
What does he got to do with it?

963
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,991
You can't just take my son.
       He's my son, too.

964
01:11:02,993 --> 01:11:04,626
I'm not a fucking loser.

965
01:11:04,628 --> 01:11:07,495
I don't care!
     I don't care anymore!

966
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,450
Can I help you, Sir?

967
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:05,553
Yeah. Looking for a gun.

968
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:08,389
Well, what kind of gun
       you're looking for?

969
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:10,458
Something cheap.

970
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:12,911
Well, it kind of depends

971
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,095
on what
   you need it for, I guess.

972
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:16,964
That one.

973
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:20,001
The Cobra 380.
   Well, that's cheap, alright.

974
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,969
Hundred and thirty bucks.

975
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:28,976
It's got a 3.5-inch-long barrel,

976
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:30,978
5.4-inch overall length,

977
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:35,083
weighs about twenty-two ounces,
I'd say, features fixed sights,

978
01:12:35,085 --> 01:12:38,886
single-action trigger,
    and she holds five rounds.

979
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:48,129
You're welcome
    to pick it up if you like.

980
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,703
You know shooting the Cobra 380,

981
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:57,572
it's not all that bad.

982
01:12:57,574 --> 01:13:00,041
It's similar, I'd say,
         to a high point,

983
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,410
meaning it works, but,

984
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:04,045
I'm not gonna pass it on
         down to my kids,

985
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:05,446
that's for sure.

986
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:07,815
What do you say, Sir?

987
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:11,236
I'll take it.

988
01:13:11,237 --> 01:13:12,787
Alright, I just need
      your driver's license.

989
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,389
You need ammo?

990
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,391
Yeah.

991
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,459
Standard 380 ammo.

992
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:41,549
Are we good?

993
01:13:42,652 --> 01:13:44,786
Yeah, I just need you to--

994
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:47,422
need you to sign
    the bottom of this form
        and finish off.

995
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:52,093
And how
  would you like to pay, Sir?

996
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:05,206
Great.

997
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,953
How's the day, Roger?

998
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,722
Not too bad. Yourself?

999
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:23,224
Just started.

1000
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:29,130
Okay,

1001
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:30,998
you are good to go.

1002
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,967
Let me get you
         a case for that.

1003
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:44,078
[shopkeeper] Okay.

1004
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:50,618
There you go.

1005
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,053
Have a good day.

1006
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:01,896
Something odd about that one.

1007
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:03,164
[John] Background checked out?

1008
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,198
Oh, yeah.

1009
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,867
Well, that's his right.

1010
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,135
Yeah, yeah.

1011
01:15:08,738 --> 01:15:10,538
What can I get you today, Chief?

1012
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:12,273
I'm gonna need some Gold Dots.

1013
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,942
Gold Dots. Yeah, got them.
       Just give me second.

1014
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:18,012
Gold Dots. Alright.

1015
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:39,884
I'm really sorry.

1016
01:15:39,885 --> 01:15:41,668
What for? You did
   absolutely nothing wrong.

1017
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:42,970
Who's putting you through this?

1018
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:46,841
We tried to do the right thing.

1019
01:15:47,577 --> 01:15:48,809
Didn't work out.

1020
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:55,249
I've never seen her that upset.

1021
01:15:56,953 --> 01:15:58,920
She's gonna be fine. It's just--

1022
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:01,556
it's gonna take
  a little time, is all. Hey.

1023
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:04,625
We have nothing but time, right?

1024
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:09,096
[Deb] Hi, how we doing?

1025
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,033
Want that coffee now?

1026
01:16:12,035 --> 01:16:13,267
Yes, please.

1027
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:17,939
[Michael] Two, please.

1028
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,646
Thank you.

1029
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:30,751
You okay?

1030
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,887
You?

1031
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,090
Shaky.

1032
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:26,407
You there? Huh?

1033
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:32,913
You there?

1034
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:36,984
I need to know.

1035
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:42,390
I need to know,
       I can't feel you.

1036
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:51,232
Son, I can't feel you.

1037
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,008
Where are you?

1038
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,146
Where are you at this moment?

1039
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:10,685
At this second,
        where are you?

1040

01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:46,480
Hey, hey.

1072
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:48,615
What's going on?

1073
01:24:48,617 --> 01:24:50,684
No, wait a second.
          Wait a second.

1074
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:53,420
[Michael] It's okay.
      Just-- just hold on.

1075
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,422
[yelling] Can somebody,
   please, call an ambulance?

1076
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:59,460
[girl] No, no. Get some help!

1077
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,430
[screaming] What did you do?

1078
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:05,299
Call an ambulance!

1079
01:25:09,872 --> 01:25:12,339
[Michael] It's okay.

1080
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,344
Is somebody
     gonna fucking help me?

1081
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:24,411
So, did you talk to my dad
   about working for him or?

1082
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:30,384
We talked about
  pretty much everything, so.

1083
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,888
Okay, but did you talk to him
  specifically about working?

1084
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:38,859
No, not exactly that way.

1085
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:51,805
He jumped down my throat
  before I even opened my mouth.

1086
01:26:53,576 --> 01:26:54,625
Yeah, okay.

1087
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:55,675
Tired of that old man's
        bullshit anyway.

1088
01:26:55,678 --> 01:26:58,812
Yeah, he's definitely
   the problem here, not you.

1089
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:00,447
You think I got something
     I got to prove to him?

1090
01:27:00,749 --> 01:27:02,516
I'm sure he loved
     the shaved head, too.

1091
01:27:03,285 --> 01:27:04,651
You know what, sweetheart?

1092
01:27:05,321 --> 01:27:07,221
He can kiss my white ass.

1093
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:08,755
And you can too.

1094
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:10,991
If y'all don't like it,

1095
01:27:12,494 --> 01:27:13,827
you can both fuck off.

1096
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:17,231
You know what, fuck it, I don't
   even fucking care anymore.

1097
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:18,933
You do whatever
       the fuck you want.

1098
01:27:18,934 --> 01:27:20,634
Yeah, that's right,
I'll do whatever the fuck I want

1099
01:27:20,636 --> 01:27:22,436
-whenever the fuck I want.
              -Yep.

1100
01:27:22,838 --> 01:27:23,770
Fuck!

1101
01:27:32,815 --> 01:27:34,815
I mean--
   I didn't mean to do that.

1102
