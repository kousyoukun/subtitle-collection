1
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:46,442
<i>The worst of the Eight Hells
is called Continuous Hell.</i>

2
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,600
<i>It has the meaning of Continuous
Suffering. Thus the name</i>

3
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,060
5 years ago

4
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:31,934
we started valet parking in Tuen Mun.

5
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:37,196
We were full of ambition.

6
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,124
But 2 weeks had hardly gone by

7
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,496
and the cops started busting us every day.

8
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:48,861
Within one year

9
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:52,592
6 of our brothers died.

10
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:03,586
Thanks to the Buddha, my life was spared.

11
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:15,587
What thousands must die
so that Caesar may become great.

12
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:18,254
But I don't believe in destiny.

13
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:25,856
The rule of this game
is to take fate in our own hands.

14
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,154
You are the newest in my gang.

15
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:32,983
Your records are the cleanest.

16
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:38,791
You can choose your own future.

17
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,549
OK.

18
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,345
I wish you guys

19
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:54,615
every success in the police force.

20
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:58,019
Bottoms up, officers

21
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:19,217
27149, you were here 10 minutes ago.

22
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,680
How many files were on my desk?

23
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:24,177
Six, sir. Four beige ones on the left

24
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:26,442
one red and one white on the right.

25
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:33,840
What do you think of me?

26
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:37,376
Sorry, I'm not sure, sir.

27
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:40,239
But I know you're in a hurry today

28
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:41,846
'coz your socks don't match

29
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:50,807
27149, you can go now.

30
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,010
Yes, sir.

31
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,776
You owe me $500.

32
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:03,071
OK, but wait till pay day next month

33
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,546
I told you he would make the best
undercover cop.

34
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:08,705
Now that you're in the cadet school
you should follow the rules.

35
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:11,138
Those who break the rules will be
like him.

36
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:12,401
They will be expelled.

37
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,834
Who wants to trade place with him?

38
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:31,873
I do.

39
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,636
27149
this is a long-term undercover mission.

40
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,872
Your records in the cadet school
will be erased.

41
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,832
Only Superintendent Wong and
I know of your identity.

42
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,731
This mission is highly dangerous
is that clear?

43
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:50,934
Yes, sir.

44
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,794
Sir, I can't stand it any longer

45
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm either harassed by cops
or beaten up by gangsters.

46
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,035
4927, you are still a rookie.

47
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:04,792
Give me a good reason
why I should promote you.

48
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,159
Hang on?
Why don't you go hang yourself instead?

49
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,429
I won the Silver Whistle Award
at the cadet

50
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,259
and have received numerous kudos as
an officer.

51
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,791
I am confident I can lead the police force
sir.

52
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:23,697
Boss.

53
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,298
OK, I got it.

54
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:35,858
Move forward.

55
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,224
Hurry up.

56
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,692
Please go over there to take your mugshot.

57
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:25,013
Excuse me.

58
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,583
Can I try this stereo?

59
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:30,488
What speakers are you using?

60
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,086
Nothing special, any recommendations?

61
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:38,611
Try this tube amplifier
made in Hong Kong, 10,000 only.

62
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,111
And use this cable, also locally made
about 1000.

63
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:44,683
The sound is as good as expensive
European amps.

64
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:48,916
Sweet high notes, crisp middle
strong bass.

65
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:51,220
In a word, transparent.

66
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:54,282
Come and listen.

67
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:03,711
Human voices are drifting towards you.

68
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:07,381
See that?

69
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,445
Voices are indeed drifting towards you.

70
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,943
Try this one.

71
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:29,611
This is ideal for listening to oldies.

72
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:36,704
What do you think?

73
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:38,239
Much better indeed.

74
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,773
Any discount if I buy the whole set?

75
00:09:44,444 --> 00:09:45,705
Buy the tube amp here

76
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,570
but not the speakers.

77
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:49,838
Go to Cheung Wai; It's cheaper there.

78
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,067
Whom should I ask for?

79
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,435
Just tell them Yan sent you.

80
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:03,036
Which one is mine?

81
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:04,002
The one in the middle.

82
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,674
Okay, thanks.

83
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:06,939
You're welcome.

84
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,364
Is Cheung Wai open yet?

85
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:10,562
Sure.

86
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:12,404
You bastard.

87
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:14,764
I told you to watch the store
not to send my customers away.

88
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:16,906
But your speakers are over-priced

89
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:21,039
if I don't sell them at this price how can
I afford to pay "protection money"?

90
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:22,998
You can try not paying for a change.

91
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:24,935
Hey, the cable

92
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:25,933
I'll return it in a few days

93
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:28,296
$4,000 for a few days?

94
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,297
Where are you rushing to?

95
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:30,500
A funeral.

96
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:00,931
Tell me.

97
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,390
How many times have you been busted
for assault?

98
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:05,558
I am trying to convince
the Department of Justice

99
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:07,988
that you need to see a shrink.

100
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:09,491
But you keep on beating people up.

101
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:14,358
Are you really going nuts?

102
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,558
Have you forgotten you're a cop?

103
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:23,253
You told me it's only for 3 years.

104
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,189
But after 3 years come another 3 years
and another

105
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,722
it's almost 10 years already, boss.

106
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:33,290
Can't you be a bit more courteous to me?

107
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,123
I'm the only one in Hong Kong
who knows your real identity now.

108
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:39,986
Maybe I'll just erase your file
so you can stick with the Triads for good.

109
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:43,718
What do you want me to do?

110
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:46,256
Remind myself I'm a cop every day?

111
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:51,825
Shouting "Drop your gun, I'm a cop"
even in my dreams?

112
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,821
When will Sam place his order?

113
00:11:58,058 --> 00:11:59,024
No idea.

114
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:08,780
Sometime this week.

115
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:09,680
What?

116
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:11,081
Sometime this week.

117
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:15,216
The Thais are here.

118
00:12:15,555 --> 00:12:17,418
Once the goods arrive
Sam will resell them.

119
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:21,384
Where is the warehouse?

120
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,519
How the hell do I know?

121
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:25,378
I started working for him only 3 years ago.

122
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:30,810
OK, I'll let you retire after this.

123
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:34,247
Bullshit
I heard this a zillion times already.

124
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,979
Shit. These mikes again?

125
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:54,239
The Police is loaded with cash
Tell them to get more advanced models.

126
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:56,843
How about implanting it into your body?

127
00:12:57,882 --> 00:12:59,041
Into which part of my body?

128
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:11,075
A pinhole camera?

129
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,902
Where's the lens?

130
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,173
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?

131
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:22,710
I never wear watches.

132
00:13:57,272 --> 00:14:00,433
If we got nothing for the Interpol by 5pm

133
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:02,765
the counterfeit passport case is off

134
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,233
3:15. Tea time.

135
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:06,834
What would you like, boss?

136
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:08,394
Tea with milk, please.

137
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,869
They won't talk without their attorney.

138
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:14,104
Has paged their lawyers
but he hasn't called back yet.

139
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:48,865
I won't talk without my attorney.

140
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:52,958
I am Mr. Lau, your attorney.

141
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:55,129
Did you call home?

142
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,585
Why should I call home?

143
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:03,555
It's good then.

144
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:07,989
Where were you last Friday
from 3:45 to 5:00 pm?

145
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:11,992
Brother Mo told me to ask you
if your family needs any help.

146
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,116
No need to look around.

147
00:15:16,326 --> 00:15:17,883
They won't record anything
when a lawyer is present

148
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,184
it's not admissible in court anyway.

149
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,388
Brother Mo sent you?

150
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:37,484
Those 2 kids next door

151
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,823
have squealed on the workshop already.

152
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,485
Cops are heading there now.

153
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:46,048
Brother Mo told you not to say anything

154
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:52,389
if your brother is there
tell him to leave right away.

155
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:54,542
Here.

156
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:10,977
What?

157
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:12,578
Scram.

158
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:14,984
I ask you to scram, do you hear?

159
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:16,774
Scram right away.

160
00:16:19,984 --> 00:16:22,474
All right. I'll leave you

161
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,846
if you don't trust me, so be it.

162
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,037
Take care.

163
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:36,508
Remember don't talk without your attorney.

164
00:16:36,814 --> 00:16:38,075
I don't need you to tell me that.

165
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,770
Fanny.

166
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:42,605
Yes?

167
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,438
Take this.

168
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:45,774
Check this number.

169
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:46,741
Sure.

170
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:48,104
Send this message for me.

171
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:58,578
Cheung Fai Industrial Building, 2nd Floor.

172
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,810
Cheung Fai Industrial Building, 2nd Floor
OK.

173
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:04,567
Boss.

174
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:05,799
All set.

175
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,235
A Triad member.

176
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:08,701
Where's my tea?

177
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:09,533
Here.

178
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:10,606
Thanks.

179
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:15,531
You're great.

180
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:17,273
How did you know it's Mo's hideout?

181
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:24,373
Thanks.

182
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,532
Hello, yes.

183
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,402
No problem. OK.

184
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:36,367
Sorry guys, over time tonight.

185
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:48,300
Our target tonight is a drug trafficking
cartel.

186
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,900
In an hour's time
they will be trading with a Thai seller.

187
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:56,826
Cash will be handed over in the building
across the street

188
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,365
in a unit on the 3rd floor.

189
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,626
Where the goods will be delivered is
still unknown.

190
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:10,234
CIB shall tag the target
and tap the phone lines.

191
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:16,300
Our unit will not take action till our
mole has pinned down the delivery location.

192
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,228
Let's take a look at our principal stars.

193
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:23,889
Here are our principal stars tonight:

194
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:26,655
Hon Sam, Chen Wing-yan, Del Piero.

195
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:33,588
We've been watching them for a long time.

196
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,089
We'd better nail them tonight.

197
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:36,653
OK? No more questions?

198
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:37,590
Let's get to work.

199
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,090
Sorry for paging you so urgently.

200
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:58,782
But our mission is kept confidential till
the last moment.

201
00:18:59,026 --> 00:18:59,650
No problem.

202
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:00,552
Do you have confidence?

203
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,084
Yes, it should be OK.

204
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:03,019
Hello, Dad.

205
00:19:03,426 --> 00:19:04,391
Pass the phone to Dad.

206
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:07,980
I can't come home for dinner.

207
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:11,385
Too bad
Dinner has been prepared already.

208
00:19:11,624 --> 00:19:13,386
Call me when you're back
I'll heat it up for you.

209
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,584
You look so relaxed

210
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,653
it's only work
We can always work on it next time.

211
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:22,186
Sorry.

212
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:52,017
All cell phone signals in this area
are under surveillance.

213
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:56,050
SP Wong.

214
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,981
SP Wong, which channel?

215
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,611
Channel 454870.

216
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:01,839
Channel 454870.

217
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:39,336
Attention. Our prey is in sight.

218
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:48,474
Big Brother.

219
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,398
Boss.

220
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:12,328
Take out all your cell phones.

221
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:20,437
You two, go get the car.

222
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:22,460
Wait.

223
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,357
Yan

224
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:27,533
escort the Thais here.

225
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:29,901
You two, follow me.

226
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:39,333
Lau.

227
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:40,397
Yes.

228
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,794
Did Sam and his gang make any calls?

229
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,130
No. They probably changed their phones.

230
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:47,528
Let's search randomly for calls
made from this area.

231
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:48,930
Searching.

232
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:51,360
Some 6,500 cell phones

233
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,428
are being connected in this area right now.

234
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,894
267 cell phones are making calls
on this street alone.

235
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:58,663
Give me 10 minutes.

236
00:21:58,864 --> 00:21:59,659
Good.

237
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:01,192
Thank you.

238
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,789
Did they spot us?

239
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:10,459
Are those two over there watching us?

240
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:13,528
Which two?

241
00:22:13,762 --> 00:22:15,251
Those two.

242
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:19,026
No one is watching you.

243
00:22:19,262 --> 00:22:22,229
Those two making out over there.

244
00:22:22,695 --> 00:22:25,026
They are just making out
Why would they be watching you?

245
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,193
You think you're a movie star?

246
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,026
Our prey is back.

247
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:31,324
Yip, watch our prey closely.

248
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:45,480
Boss. The Thais are here.

249
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:47,682
Hey man.

250
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,455
What's up?

251
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:50,088
How are you?

252
00:22:50,856 --> 00:22:51,879
Cigar?

253
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,556
Is that any good?

254
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:58,446
Excellent.

255
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:05,911
Is it cold in Hong Kong?

256
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:07,744
Very cold.

257
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,850
You even know how to speak Cantonese.

258
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,549
How fantastic.

259
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,815
Marvelous indeed.

260
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,241
AA+

261
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,509
Deal.

262
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:05,902
Automobile license plate number HN397
is taking off.

263
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,044
Repeat, Helen, Nelson
HN397 is taking off.

264
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:09,335
Attention. HN397 is taking off.

265
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:11,736
Repeat, Helen, Nelson, 397.

266
00:24:17,177 --> 00:24:18,336
Should we send a car to tail them?

267
00:24:30,474 --> 00:24:32,202
Elephant
Kwai Chung Container Terminus

268
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,797
Roger.

269
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:43,702
Piero. You're being tailed.

270
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:44,961
Lead them in circles.

271
00:24:55,238 --> 00:24:56,602
They know which channel we are on.

272
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:58,995
Switch to channel 456855.

273
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:08,267
Boss, where are those two going?

274
00:25:09,902 --> 00:25:12,528
Don't worry, take it easy.

275
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:24,200
Take care of the Thais for me.

276
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:40,892
Sorry, sir.

277
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:47,726
Hello?

278
00:25:48,863 --> 00:25:51,386
Why don't you use the walkie talkie?
We've switched channels?

279
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:52,525
Are you done yet?

280
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:54,788
Beat it.

281
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:01,489
Piero, are you being tailed?

282
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:04,786
Keep driving around.

283
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,721
Cheung.

284
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,357
Use the current channel to tell Elephant
that action has been canceled.

285
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:34,420
Yes, sir.

286
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:40,380
Elephant, no hunting tonight.

287
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:42,483
Come back to the station

288
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,078
it's done.

289
00:26:52,253 --> 00:26:52,946
What the hell is going on?

290
00:26:54,786 --> 00:26:57,685
Our guys are freezing to death out there.

291
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,179
What's so funny?

292
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,416
I speak Thai. I know what they're saying.

293
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:04,580
Really?

294
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:08,582
Yes. They are bitching at the boss.

295
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:11,483
What are they bitching about?

296
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:15,445
Those Thais at Lung Koo Bay
are freezing to death.

297
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,947
You know they can't stand the cold.

298
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:21,074
That's right.

299
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:23,147
You're sharp.

300
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,166
Cheung, call Elephant.

301
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:58,534
Goods to be delivered at Lung Koo Bay.

302
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,203
Boss, I found it.

303
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:19,406
Tell Keung to check the goods
And make sure no one is around.

304
00:28:21,406 --> 00:28:22,303
Not a soul.

305
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:30,830
A boat is approaching
Probably for checking the goods.

306
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:41,629
The cocaine is all here.

307
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:43,369
Keung, are you an idiot or what?

308
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:44,659
Boss.

309
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:45,823
I heard it.

310
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:49,692
Tell Keung to shout a loud
that the cocaine is his.

311
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:52,200
Keung, the Boss

312
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:54,833
asks you to shout aloud that the cocaine
is yours.

313
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:58,692
The cocaine is yours.

314
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,230
Take delivery.

315
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,329
They are taking delivery
Get ready for action.

316
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,456
Thanks. Thanks.

317
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:21,824
Thank you.

318
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:31,490
Double Eight.

319
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:36,617
As soon as the Thais step out, arrest them.

320
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,147
There's a stooge. Stop the deal.

321
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,223
There's a stooge. Stop the deal.

322
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:02,318
Wait.

323
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:04,579
There's a stooge. Stop the deal.

324
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:09,911
Hello?

325
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:11,451
Cast all the goods into the sea. Now.

326
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:14,779
Keung. Cast all the goods into the sea.

327
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:16,419
Police. Freeze.

328
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,686
We got the men but lost the goods.

329
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:32,680
They have cast everything into the sea.

330
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:34,113
Double Eight, hold it.

331
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,672
All of you, follow me.

332
00:30:54,382 --> 00:30:55,746
What are you looking at?

333
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:28,943
Boss. Let's...

334
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:52,704
Police, don't move

335
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:40,254
Sam.

336
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:42,863
Your food looks good.

337
00:32:43,198 --> 00:32:44,164
Not bad.

338
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:46,957
We've straightened it out.

339
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:49,065
Your boys are only strolling on the beach.

340
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,622
So they can go now?

341
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:52,190
Sure, any time.

342
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:54,464
We don't want to waste any more of
your precious time.

343
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:57,328
We've known each other for so long.
Don't give me that.

344
00:32:57,964 --> 00:32:59,453
I haven't had my dinner here
for quite a while

345
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,157
if you like it, you're always welcome here.

346
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,091
How about tomorrow?

347
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:04,887
I'll take a rain check.

348
00:33:06,262 --> 00:33:08,161
I feel bad coming here empty-handed.

349
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:09,589
Don't stand on ceremonies.

350
00:33:09,928 --> 00:33:11,394
I' should feel bad

351
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:13,594
for making you drop several grand
tonight.

352
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:37,591
You think planting a mole in us will do
us in?

353
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:39,115
Same here.

354
00:33:58,054 --> 00:33:59,645
I remember a story.

355
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:03,318
Two fools are waiting for their
kidney transplants

356
00:34:03,587 --> 00:34:04,746
but only one kidney is available.

357
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:07,078
The two guys thus play a game.

358
00:34:08,154 --> 00:34:10,451
They each put a playing card
into the other's pocket.

359
00:34:10,653 --> 00:34:14,313
Whoever guesses the card in his own
pocket wins.

360
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:18,108
You know I can see your card.

361
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:21,977
I think so too.

362
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:28,015
I will beat you.

363
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:29,279
Let's see.

364
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:32,708
We should be more careful.

365
00:34:32,915 --> 00:34:33,778
I will.

366
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,104
By the way

367
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:38,441
whoever loses the game will die.

368
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:43,047
Let's see when you're gonna die.

369
00:34:48,012 --> 00:34:50,377
Ever seen someone shakes
a corpse's hand?

370
00:34:54,746 --> 00:34:55,541
Let's go.

371
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:17,772
Put it next to the couch.

372
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:18,703
OK

373
00:35:19,008 --> 00:35:19,905
Thanks

374
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:24,871
Mary.

375
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,902
What's interior designer's number?

376
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:31,097
The interior designer... 90255047.

377
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,638
How many boxes have I counted?

378
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,030
24? Are you sure?

379
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:40,364
Positive.

380
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:43,934
Pass me the phone.

381
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:45,233
Coming.

382
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:51,096
Hello?

383
00:35:51,804 --> 00:35:52,201
Hold on please.

384
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:53,198
Who is it?

385
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:54,130
I don't know.

386
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:55,427
Hello

387
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,599
it's me.

388
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:58,565
Yes, I'm moving in.

389
00:35:58,803 --> 00:36:00,793
Don't eavesdrop. It's confidential

390
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:02,759
I lost all of my goods.

391
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:04,495
There's a mole.

392
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:05,732
Dig him out for me.

393
00:36:05,935 --> 00:36:07,367
Hold on, too many people around here.

394
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,499
Hold on.

395
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,590
I have no access to those undercover files.
I can't dig him out.

396
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:14,230
I don't care how difficult it is.

397
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,690
I only know he uses Morse codes.

398
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:29,558
Give me all the information on the people
around you last night.

399
00:36:29,798 --> 00:36:33,425
Their real names, ID card no.
Account no., etc.

400
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:36,357
See you tonight, at the cinema.

401
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:37,424
OK.

402
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:44,026
What's the matter?

403
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:55,460
I'm talking about my novel

404
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:57,284
I know what I'm going to write about
Come here

405
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:01,585
I can write about a man with 28 different
personalities.

406
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:02,988
Are you talking about me?

407
00:37:03,226 --> 00:37:04,556
Be more serious.

408
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:05,991
Think about it.

409
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,089
A man with 28 personalities.

410
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:11,156
That means he starts role playing
the minute he wakes up.

411
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:13,881
He is no longer certain
which personality is the real him

412
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:16,245
isn't it scary?

413
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:17,287
Very much.

414
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:18,719
Good?

415
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,047
Yeah. Will be a bestseller for sure.

416
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,845
Wait...

417
00:37:21,056 --> 00:37:21,612
What is it?

418
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,046
Why is the ottoman so big?

419
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:24,487
Which one?

420
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:28,090
I must have gotten the measurements
wrong.

421
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:30,954
Take it easy.

422
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:32,618
You women...

423
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:34,718
Let me see. Get up slowly.

424
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,677
Don't be mad.

425
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:43,642
Meet up?

426
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,817
You want me dead?

427
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:46,519
There's a mole in the police station.

428
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:48,112
Dig him out first.

429
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:50,944
So who is he?

430
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:53,776
I can't talk anymore.

431
00:37:55,118 --> 00:37:56,049
What?

432
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:57,940
Just now?

433
00:37:58,584 --> 00:37:59,641
I was at a Chinese chiropractor.

434
00:38:01,184 --> 00:38:02,673
I'm seeing the shrink now.

435
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:05,350
I'm going psycho. That's it.

436
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,971
This chair is really... incredible.

437
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:09,873
You should get one for yourself?

438
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:11,868
So you don't need to come here
and sleep every time

439
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:13,629
it's more comfortable here.

440
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:16,369
Don't be so peevish.

441
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,038
During these 4 months, if it weren't for me

442
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:21,099
you wouldn't have the time to play

443
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:24,665
it's 5 months computer games.

444
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:28,466
In one more month
your mandatory therapy will be over.

445
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,227
You can sleep peacefully at home then.

446
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,069
So soon?

447
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:36,870
I don't seem to have improved at all.

448
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,966
Why don't you just prolong my treatment.

449
00:39:40,235 --> 00:39:44,168
Besides, my head is splitting these days.

450
00:39:44,435 --> 00:39:46,265
Could it be schizophrenia?

451
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,700
This is called "headache"
I'll prescribe some Panadol for you.

452
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:55,057
Actually
there's something I want to ask you

453
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,726
but...

454
00:39:56,966 --> 00:39:58,795
it's kind of embarrassing.

455
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,529
What do you think of me?

456
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:09,055
Do you think I'm a good guy or a bad guy?

457
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:11,954
I hardly know who you are.

458
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:22,823
Tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone.

459
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:28,920
I'm actually a cop.

460
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:35,554
So am I.

461
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:44,986
Let's continue next week.

462
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:46,824
Try to remember your dreams.

463
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:48,845
Of course.

464
00:40:49,924 --> 00:40:50,855
I will dream about you.

465
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:53,812
See you next week.

466
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,115
Just Panadol?

467
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:06,052
Bye.

468
00:41:11,854 --> 00:41:13,753
Your promotion should be OK.

469
00:41:15,321 --> 00:41:16,911
You will be transferred to Internal Affairs

470
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:19,086
but you will work at OCTB.

471
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,016
I don't understand.

472
00:41:23,752 --> 00:41:26,810
I suspect Sam has a mole
in the department.

473
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,108
I want you to investigate.

474
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,740
Why me?

475
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:33,641
We have scrutinized all possible
candidates.

476
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,516
You have an immaculate record.

477
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:38,084
You have solved many cases in CIB.

478
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:42,545
Working in LA, you will get in touch
with senior officials.

479
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:44,381
That's a good opportunity.

480
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,416
I've arranged for you to appear on TV.

481
00:41:48,948 --> 00:41:50,141
Remember to spruce up a bit.

482
00:41:53,548 --> 00:41:54,809
When will I meet the Board?

483
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:56,640
You just did.

484
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:01,075
Come, take a stab.

485
00:42:05,578 --> 00:42:06,475
Thanks.

486
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:08,434
By the way

487
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,337
how's the wedding?

488
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:12,902
Everything's on schedule.

489
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:14,901
That's good.

490
00:42:15,444 --> 00:42:18,274
You'll be more stable after marriage.

491
00:42:18,576 --> 00:42:19,974
Your image will improve too.

492
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:22,132
You have chance of further promotion.

493
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,273
Yes, broaden your horizon.

494
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:32,243
Fill in your real name.

495
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:33,634
This is my real name.

496
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,730
You don't know Del Piero is my real name?

497
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:36,669
Is that so?

498
00:42:36,874 --> 00:42:37,771
Yes.

499
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,036
What are you guys writing?

500
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:51,497
The Boss told us to fill in these forms.

501
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,328
Must be setting up mandatory
provident funds for us.

502
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:55,628
You know, MPF.

503
00:42:58,738 --> 00:42:59,567
Are you serious?

504
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:01,269
You don't know to spell BODYGUARD?

505
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:02,027
Isn't it supposed to look like this?

506
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,463
Of course not.

507
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,901
Should be B-O-D-Y-G-A-R-D.

508
00:43:19,169 --> 00:43:20,362
That's it.

509
00:43:46,296 --> 00:43:47,353
A shipment will come in next week.

510
00:43:48,964 --> 00:43:50,021
They are watching closely.

511
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:52,357
You do what you need to do.

512
00:43:53,629 --> 00:43:54,925
I'll handle the rest.

513
00:43:56,728 --> 00:43:59,127
The file is open. I'm
afraid I can't handle it.

514
00:43:59,628 --> 00:44:01,390
So you're not worried about me.

515
00:44:02,862 --> 00:44:05,056
You are worried about yourself
Inspector Lau.

516
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,956
Those girls are so ugly.

517
00:44:21,626 --> 00:44:23,115
I'll take care of it as soon as I can.

518
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,002
Hello?

519
00:45:30,748 --> 00:45:32,112
I'm on my way back.

520
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,337
Yan.

521
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:20,268
How long have you worked for me?

522
00:46:21,107 --> 00:46:22,471
3 or 4 years already.

523
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,131
That long?

524
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,136
Doesn't seem that long to me.

525
00:46:29,438 --> 00:46:31,371
I have another shipment next week.

526
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,728
But this time

527
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:36,430
I'm using some tough, new faces.

528
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:37,796
So you guys can rest.

529
00:46:41,471 --> 00:46:42,835
Even Keung and the others?

530
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:44,797
Keung?

531
00:46:47,669 --> 00:46:49,829
Don't you know he's nuts?

532
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,926
There's a mole within us. You know that?

533
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:12,192
What do you think we should do?

534
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:14,921
I'll take care of it.

535
00:47:15,898 --> 00:47:17,023
How?

536
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:32,359
I'll find out who he is in a couple of days
Get ready for action.

537
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:36,320
Yan.

538
00:47:39,261 --> 00:47:40,955
Of all the brothers, I trust you the most.

539
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:08,450
Lau.

540
00:48:15,756 --> 00:48:16,847
No, thanks.

541
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:23,348
These folks.

542
00:48:23,754 --> 00:48:25,948
You know most of them
no need for introduction, right?

543
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,410
No, but...

544
00:48:29,654 --> 00:48:30,551
they are so...

545
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:35,810
Who doesn't know you're sent here
to find the mole?

546
00:48:36,019 --> 00:48:37,986
What do you want them to do?
Pour you a cup of coffee?

547
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:41,514
Only an idiot will not be envied, right?

548
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,443
They all want to know who the mole is.

549
00:48:44,818 --> 00:48:46,512
Just tell me whom you want to investigate.

550
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:47,482
OK

551
00:48:48,418 --> 00:48:49,509
Any clues?

552
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:53,312
Two days ago, my informer

553
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:55,743
nearly found out who he was.

554
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,812
Too bad he lost him.

555
00:48:59,115 --> 00:49:00,775
But if Sam is getting a new shipment
he must contact the mole again.

556
00:49:01,082 --> 00:49:03,049
Just follow Sam and we'll get
what we want.

557
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:06,142
That's right. I've much to learn from you.

558
00:49:06,547 --> 00:49:07,604
Don't say that.

559
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:10,348
Our seniors sent you here
because they think you can do it.

560
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:12,546
Not everyone can handle LA tasks

561
00:49:12,814 --> 00:49:13,609
it's stuffy here.

562
00:49:14,013 --> 00:49:15,001
Let's get out of here.

563
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,338
The coffee here is the best
in the headquarters.

564
00:49:17,547 --> 00:49:18,444
I'll pour you a cup.

565
00:49:43,475 --> 00:49:47,375
My informer nearly found out
who the mole was.

566
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,173
But if Sam is getting a new shipment

567
00:49:49,475 --> 00:49:51,339
he must contact the mole again.

568
00:50:56,364 --> 00:50:57,092
Yes?

569
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,522
Hey.

570
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:01,026
The bed has arrived.

571
00:51:01,398 --> 00:51:02,922
Is that so? Comfortable?

572
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:05,124
You want to try it?

573
00:51:05,367 --> 00:51:07,961
Don't be silly. I have work to do.

574
00:51:09,235 --> 00:51:10,463
Think about it.

575
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,367
No, I can't.

576
00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:15,399
Come on.

577
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:16,558
Saturday.

578
00:51:17,004 --> 00:51:18,198
I'll be free next Saturday
We can try it then.

579
00:51:18,904 --> 00:51:19,962
OK.

580
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:21,101
OK, next Saturday then.

581
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:21,736
Bye.

582
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:22,767
Bye.

583
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:27,733
Up already?

584
00:51:27,907 --> 00:51:29,033
Yes.

585
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:32,872
We just tested the bed
and you are working again?

586
00:51:33,643 --> 00:51:35,406
I'm very hardworking.

587
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,534
What are you writing now?

588
00:51:37,778 --> 00:51:39,040
Here.

589
00:51:40,712 --> 00:51:43,509
The more I think of it, the more
pathetic the main character appears.

590
00:51:44,078 --> 00:51:45,102
Pathetic indeed.

591
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,603
Perhaps I should make him a happier guy.

592
00:51:47,948 --> 00:51:48,676
Good.

593
00:51:48,948 --> 00:51:50,609
Should I turn him into a good guy?

594
00:51:53,316 --> 00:51:56,410
Even though he is good
he has done bad things.

595
00:51:56,716 --> 00:51:57,842
So how should it end?

596
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,614
That's a good question.

597
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,078
I'll leave this to you writers.

598
00:52:04,085 --> 00:52:05,780
You're not going to sleep?
Help me, please.

599
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,954
Help me, please?

600
00:52:08,254 --> 00:52:09,186
I can't.

601
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:11,388
Go to sleep. You are tired.

602
00:52:28,995 --> 00:52:30,757
From now on

603
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:32,120
follow SP Wong around the clock.

604
00:52:35,663 --> 00:52:40,032
Piero, I know how to spot a plainclothes.

605
00:52:40,865 --> 00:52:41,797
How?

606
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:43,725
If he seems to be doing something

607
00:52:43,932 --> 00:52:46,229
but is paying attention to us instead

608
00:52:46,732 --> 00:52:48,063
then he is a cop.

609
00:53:08,273 --> 00:53:10,002
Is that so?

610
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:11,932
Then the whole place is filled with cops.

611
00:53:12,175 --> 00:53:13,369
They're everywhere.

612
00:53:23,246 --> 00:53:24,144
Yan.

613
00:53:25,012 --> 00:53:25,842
Boss.

614
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:41,585
Watching something?

615
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,042
You are a cop.

616
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,180
We are guessing who a cop is.

617
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:48,549
How trivial.

618
00:53:50,653 --> 00:53:51,585
I'm going for a massage, wanna come?

619
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:52,810
I hate it.

620
00:53:53,622 --> 00:53:54,816
Don't tell.

621
00:53:56,656 --> 00:53:57,623
Tell on him.

622
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:58,686
I won't.

623
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:07,149
What a coincidence.

624
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,623
Yes, I was shopping in the hood.

625
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:11,820
Haven't seen you for ages

626
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:14,460
6 or 7 years already.

627
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:18,318
How are you?

628
00:54:18,996 --> 00:54:21,328
I'm married. How about you?

629
00:54:21,764 --> 00:54:24,062
Still working in...?

630
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,256
Mommy.

631
00:54:34,502 --> 00:54:35,331
Your daughter?

632
00:54:35,502 --> 00:54:36,366
Yes.

633
00:54:39,036 --> 00:54:39,934
How old is she?

634
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:41,203
5 years old.

635
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:46,205
I'm waiting for my husband's car, so...

636
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,732
I'm also in a hurry.

637
00:54:48,673 --> 00:54:49,401
Bye.

638
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:50,498
Bye.

639
00:54:54,408 --> 00:54:57,002
Mommy, I'm 6 already.

640
00:54:57,376 --> 00:54:59,901
Sorry, I always get it wrong.

641
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:36,287
Where are you now?

642
00:55:36,457 --> 00:55:37,354
On my way.

643
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:46,987
Hello?

644
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,729
Boss, he is taking the subway.

645
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:53,558
Keep following him.

646
00:56:16,336 --> 00:56:19,772
Boss, he has gone to the 24th floor.

647
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,298
Stay put. Don't do anything rash.

648
00:56:37,943 --> 00:56:39,672
Boss, we've got him.

649
00:56:41,877 --> 00:56:42,741
I don't know yet.

650
00:56:43,311 --> 00:56:44,710
But I know where he is now.

651
00:56:51,331 --> 00:56:52,423
Keep watch over here.

652
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:11,269
So? Any good news?

653
00:57:11,537 --> 00:57:12,469
A shipment will come in next week.

654
00:57:12,737 --> 00:57:13,999
Time and location yet to be confirmed.

655
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:16,334
I still don't know who Sam's mole is

656
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:18,674
but he seems confident he can blow
my cover.

657
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:22,731
In that case

658
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:31,237
we'd better stop it
We're gonna lose for sure.

659
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:33,206
You are kidding, right?

660
00:57:33,478 --> 00:57:35,708
What else can we do? It's deadly business.

661
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:43,918
Hello?

662
00:57:44,147 --> 00:57:45,079
Boss said he had found the mole.
He told us to take care of him.

663
00:57:46,582 --> 00:57:47,571
I'll be right there.

664
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,122
Hello?

665
00:58:10,457 --> 00:58:11,082
Keep an eye on SP Wong.

666
00:58:26,728 --> 00:58:28,889
You two, take the stairs.

667
00:58:29,796 --> 00:58:31,286
Keung, take the elevator.

668
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:33,929
Anyone knows you're seeing me today?

669
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:34,859
No.

670
00:58:35,164 --> 00:58:36,188
They are downstairs now.

671
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:05,630
What are you doing?

672
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,202
Put it away.

673
00:59:33,217 --> 00:59:34,445
Take the window-washing scaffolding.

674
00:59:34,617 --> 00:59:35,515
How about you?

675
00:59:36,084 --> 00:59:37,108
I'll take the elevator.

676
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:40,308
Be careful.

677
00:59:41,889 --> 00:59:44,439
- Hey.
- What?

678
00:59:44,588 --> 00:59:45,520
Nothing.

679
01:00:24,734 --> 01:00:27,669
Darling, the apartment is superb.

680
01:00:27,902 --> 01:00:30,632
A 180-degree window facing
the golf course

681
01:00:30,936 --> 01:00:32,426
plus club membership costs less than
a million.

682
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:39,994
Superintendent Wong?

683
01:00:50,842 --> 01:00:52,173
Turn around to the main entrance.

684
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:46,892
What do you think of me?

685
01:01:53,796 --> 01:01:56,287
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?

686
01:02:16,871 --> 01:02:17,838
Let's go.

687
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:19,130
Police. Let's go.

688
01:02:50,483 --> 01:02:51,848
Bad news, Boss.

689
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:53,105
Something happened to SP Wong.

690
01:03:44,999 --> 01:03:47,695
There's a gunfight in Sheung Wan
this afternoon.

691
01:03:47,755 --> 01:03:48,847
Three suspects were dead;

692
01:03:49,088 --> 01:03:51,579
Several suspects and pedestrians
were injured.

693
01:03:51,822 --> 01:03:56,054
The police confirmed that
one of the victims

694
01:03:56,258 --> 01:03:57,316
was superintendent in OCTB
Mr. Wong Chi-shing.

695
01:03:57,592 --> 01:03:58,717
The motive is unknown.

696
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:02,416
Possibility of gang feud is not ruled out.

697
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:04,455
They are now after several triad members
active in the Southern Kowloon area.

698
01:04:04,693 --> 01:04:06,160
The Police Commissioner

699
01:04:06,395 --> 01:04:09,023
expressed condolence

700
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,025
and pledged to solve the case
as soon as possible

701
01:04:12,297 --> 01:04:13,821
It was a close shave

702
01:04:14,362 --> 01:04:16,023
10 minutes after you went to your massage.

703
01:04:16,263 --> 01:04:17,992
Boss told us to get ready.

704
01:04:19,299 --> 01:04:20,823
I was scared stiff.

705
01:04:21,332 --> 01:04:24,358
You know
I hide under the car in every fight.

706
01:04:26,401 --> 01:04:28,164
And there were guns up there.

707
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:32,099
I wanted to sneak out of there.

708
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:40,370
Two days ago
Boss told me to go to his room.

709
01:04:40,806 --> 01:04:43,070
He asked me how long I'd worked for him.

710
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:44,601
How the hell could I remember?

711
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,564
He then said: Keung

712
01:04:48,742 --> 01:04:50,334
it's been 5 years already.

713
01:04:52,143 --> 01:04:54,668
You've performed well all these years.

714
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,541
I have a question for you

715
01:04:58,846 --> 01:05:01,541
if one of your brothers is a mole

716
01:05:01,879 --> 01:05:03,141
will you dare to take him out?

717
01:05:04,012 --> 01:05:06,446
Of course I said yes to his face.

718
01:05:06,747 --> 01:05:08,339
You think I'm an idiot?

719
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,449
What's the result?

720
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:16,248
Of course they couldn't find the mole.

721
01:05:18,284 --> 01:05:19,979
The cop was tough.

722
01:05:20,718 --> 01:05:21,878
They dragged him upstairs

723
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,743
and beat him up for a good 10 minutes

724
01:05:25,854 --> 01:05:27,185
10 minutes...

725
01:05:31,323 --> 01:05:32,653
10 minutes...

726
01:05:34,356 --> 01:05:35,983
He didn't say a word.

727
01:05:42,626 --> 01:05:43,524
Keung.

728
01:05:46,128 --> 01:05:47,288
Boss said...

729
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,629
the cop was hot on his trail.

730
01:05:54,296 --> 01:05:57,322
Who didn't show up today is the mole.

731
01:05:58,364 --> 01:05:59,524
I didn't...

732
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:01,862
tell him you went for a massage

733
01:06:03,466 --> 01:06:06,798
if Boss knew, you're dead meat.

734
01:06:09,635 --> 01:06:12,798
Yan, I want to ask you something.

735
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:15,264
How was the masseuse today?

736
01:06:17,438 --> 01:06:18,700
Because...

737
01:06:20,072 --> 01:06:22,632
if she's ugly, it's not worth it.

738
01:06:28,508 --> 01:06:29,770
Leave right away.

739
01:06:30,776 --> 01:06:33,244
There will be lots of
cops after a car crash.

740
01:06:36,943 --> 01:06:39,571
Anyway, remember this:

741
01:06:41,712 --> 01:06:43,737
If you see someone

742
01:06:45,013 --> 01:06:50,212
doing something
but at the same time watching you...

743
01:06:53,382 --> 01:06:55,179
then he is a cop.

744
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,830
According to the closed-circuit TV.

745
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:44,294
SP Wong entered that building at 4:15 pm.

746
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:47,228
The suspects entered 20 minutes later.

747
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,397
At 4:38 pm

748
01:07:50,735 --> 01:07:52,532
we received Inspector Lau's report

749
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:57,899
8 minutes before we arrived
someone fell off the building.

750
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:00,633
That was SP Wong.

751
01:08:01,571 --> 01:08:05,029
All the suspects killed or
injured belong to Sam's gang.

752
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,397
Many suspects escaped.

753
01:08:08,241 --> 01:08:09,434
The actual numbers are unknown.

754
01:08:10,107 --> 01:08:12,098
Do you know why SP Wong went to
that building?

755
01:08:16,644 --> 01:08:17,838
It was me.

756
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:19,777
I told CIB to follow him.

757
01:08:20,044 --> 01:08:21,773
Why was CIB following him?

758
01:08:22,313 --> 01:08:23,746
That's IA's business.

759
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:26,011
Now that SP Wong is dead

760
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,577
it is OCTB's business.

761
01:08:27,914 --> 01:08:29,142
What kind of attitude is that?

762
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:31,611
SP Wong was dedicated to the police force
and you investigated him?

763
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:33,542
What kind of attitude is that?

764
01:08:33,783 --> 01:08:36,479
So we senior officers have to ask
for your approval, huh?

765
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,217
Your people have made a mistake now.
Or SP Wong wouldn't have died.

766
01:08:38,484 --> 01:08:39,451
I am talking business here.

767
01:08:39,717 --> 01:08:40,774
I am talking personal matters.

768
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,746
Nobody wanted this, OK?

769
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:49,646
Sorry, sir

770
01:08:52,192 --> 01:08:53,489
it's my negligence.

771
01:08:56,027 --> 01:08:57,789
I will give everybody an answer.

772
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,424
Sorry.

773
01:09:04,363 --> 01:09:05,955
SP Wong has a file

774
01:09:06,231 --> 01:09:08,199
with information on our undercover
in Sam's gang

775
01:09:08,831 --> 01:09:10,594
it is locked by a password.

776
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:12,861
The technical staff can't decipher it.

777
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:14,321
Inspector Lau.

778
01:09:14,533 --> 01:09:15,192
Yes.

779
01:09:15,466 --> 01:09:17,559
Work with CIB

780
01:09:17,801 --> 01:09:18,733
to unlock it.

781
01:09:19,034 --> 01:09:20,934
Find our man and get him out of there.

782
01:09:23,002 --> 01:09:24,026
By the way.

783
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:27,094
SP Wong was a good cop.

784
01:09:28,203 --> 01:09:31,695
We should give him a grand funeral.

785
01:09:32,371 --> 01:09:33,065
Okay?

786
01:09:33,705 --> 01:09:34,729
Yes, sir.

787
01:09:46,543 --> 01:09:47,339
Hello?

788
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:51,378
Boss. Why made such a scene?

789
01:09:52,211 --> 01:09:53,371
He was following me all the time.

790
01:09:53,612 --> 01:09:55,011
One of us would have to die.

791
01:09:55,247 --> 01:09:56,646
I'm now in charge of everything here

792
01:09:56,914 --> 01:09:58,438
if you're having any transactions
just let me know

793
01:09:58,715 --> 01:09:59,703
it's done.

794
01:10:00,047 --> 01:10:02,743
We got the goods when they killed
the cop today.

795
01:10:03,448 --> 01:10:07,179
I won't bother you now.

796
01:12:14,358 --> 01:12:15,552
What did you call me for?

797
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,622
So you're the one?

798
01:12:22,028 --> 01:12:22,995
Who are you?

799
01:12:23,228 --> 01:12:24,718
Inspector Lau of OCTB.

800
01:12:30,564 --> 01:12:32,828
SP Wong is gone. We're all upset.

801
01:12:33,732 --> 01:12:35,222
I still have unfinished business.

802
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:39,563
SP Wong wouldn't want you to
take law in your own hands.

803
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,060
What do you want?

804
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:43,723
Co-operation.

805
01:12:53,405 --> 01:12:56,101
The police has discovered

806
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:58,000
the body of a fugitive suspect
He was involved in

807
01:12:58,272 --> 01:13:01,264
the Sheung Wan shooting earlier today.

808
01:13:01,508 --> 01:13:02,497
The police has confirmed

809
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:05,904
the body to be an undercover cop
Tsui Wai-keung.

810
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:08,109
The police has expressed their condolence

811
01:13:08,409 --> 01:13:09,273
and promised a thorough investigation.

812
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:10,636
Boss, Yan is back.

813
01:13:11,344 --> 01:13:14,177
Three vehicles collided in Yuen Long
today.

814
01:13:14,445 --> 01:13:15,878
The driver of the private car was trapped

815
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:17,704
until firefighters came and rescued him.

816
01:13:20,881 --> 01:13:21,779
Boss.

817
01:13:22,814 --> 01:13:23,712
What is it, Yan?

818
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:26,548
I have taken care of Keung already.

819
01:13:28,449 --> 01:13:29,973
Did you ever send him to the warehouse?

820
01:13:31,551 --> 01:13:33,212
It will be disastrous
if he knows where it is.

821
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:44,713
Boss. It's me.

822
01:13:45,055 --> 01:13:46,079
You don't have to go yourself.

823
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,413
I don't want anyone to know the password.

824
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:48,721
I understand.

825
01:13:49,222 --> 01:13:50,382
I'll send everyone away.

826
01:13:59,426 --> 01:14:00,256
Inspector Cheung.

827
01:14:02,594 --> 01:14:04,221
Tell those boys to stop
following Sam's gang.

828
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:11,856
I got information that Sam is
heading towards the warehouse.

829
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,294
He won't go if he's being tailed.

830
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:17,697
Just call them back.

831
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:19,432
Let's do something for SP Wong.

832
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:20,997
Please help me, OK?

833
01:14:21,834 --> 01:14:23,768
Say something.

834
01:14:24,702 --> 01:14:26,430
This is not my case.

835
01:14:26,968 --> 01:14:28,993
Officer Chan told me not to get involved

836
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:33,606
if they're willing to stop
then it's up to them.

837
01:14:34,172 --> 01:14:36,936
I know I'm responsible for
SP Wong's death.

838
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:38,035
I am also a cop, like you.

839
01:14:38,306 --> 01:14:40,331
I want to solve the case too.

840
01:14:41,006 --> 01:14:42,564
I thought you only want promotion.

841
01:14:45,275 --> 01:14:47,004
It's SP Wong's mole who tipped me off.

842
01:14:47,242 --> 01:14:48,004
Do you believe it or not?

843
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:50,244
This is our last chance
Are you ready to take the risk?

844
01:15:39,093 --> 01:15:40,924
Attention: Target vehicle

845
01:15:41,194 --> 01:15:43,128
on Highway no.3.

846
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:52,056
U-turn at Pier 3

847
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,695
to Lung Cheung Road.

848
01:16:06,836 --> 01:16:07,825
They have been here for 20 minutes

849
01:16:08,103 --> 01:16:09,730
they are going to the 4th floor of
the car park.

850
01:16:29,609 --> 01:16:32,509
Officer Chan won't let me touch this case

851
01:16:33,243 --> 01:16:35,473
if anything goes wrong
you'll take the blame.

852
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,638
They are loading the goods at 4P.

853
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,814
Elephant, stand by at the exit at 3P.

854
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:46,742
Double Eight, watch the entrance at 2P.

855
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:49,212
Fishball and Cheung, stand by here.

856
01:16:49,449 --> 01:16:50,973
All of you, wait for my signal.

857
01:17:10,089 --> 01:17:11,954
Oh, I forgot Boss told me to stay behind.

858
01:17:12,223 --> 01:17:13,212
Drop me off here.

859
01:17:59,406 --> 01:18:00,065
Run him over.

860
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:52,917
My Master always said that about my life:

861
01:18:53,889 --> 01:18:57,381
What thousands must die so that
Caesar may become great.

862
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:01,654
You choose your own future.

863
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:17,160
That's what you have chosen.

864
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,448
Coffee for you.

865
01:20:04,151 --> 01:20:05,140
He's waited a long time for you.

866
01:20:15,188 --> 01:20:16,382
So it's you?

867
01:20:21,857 --> 01:20:22,846
Was the stereo OK?

868
01:20:23,124 --> 01:20:24,148
Pretty good.

869
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:26,355
Those tube amps have to be warmed up.

870
01:20:26,658 --> 01:20:28,785
Wait 10 minutes and it sounds great.

871
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:30,683
Should I salute you?

872
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:31,916
Not, don't.

873
01:20:33,827 --> 01:20:35,021
How long have you been an undercover?

874
01:20:35,827 --> 01:20:37,488
I've followed Sam for 3 years.

875
01:20:37,895 --> 01:20:39,362
I had several other bosses before.

876
01:20:39,929 --> 01:20:41,328
All together it's been 10 years

877
01:20:41,596 --> 01:20:42,688
10 years?

878
01:20:42,996 --> 01:20:44,327
I should salute you instead.

879
01:20:44,564 --> 01:20:45,895
I just want an identity.

880
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:47,528
I want to be a normal man.

881
01:20:48,865 --> 01:20:49,763
Getting tired?

882
01:20:51,633 --> 01:20:54,431
You've never been a mole
you won't understand.

883
01:20:57,935 --> 01:20:59,562
Too bad I still can't find the stooge

884
01:20:59,901 --> 01:21:01,232
I'll take him down if I find him.

885
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:11,170
Don't worry
Let me give you back your identity

886
01:21:11,573 --> 01:21:13,199
I'll open your file but...

887
01:21:13,574 --> 01:21:14,632
I don't have the password.

888
01:21:16,741 --> 01:21:18,299
What's the Morse code for
"undercover"?

889
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:21,604
That's it?

890
01:22:08,258 --> 01:22:08,917
Are you serious?

891
01:22:09,159 --> 01:22:10,649
You don't even know to
spell BODYGUARD?

892
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:11,591
Isn't it supposed to look like this?

893
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:13,121
Of course not.

894
01:24:26,336 --> 01:24:27,268
Dr. Lee.

895
01:24:28,671 --> 01:24:29,831
I thought you wouldn't come.

896
01:24:30,171 --> 01:24:31,604
You're wanted by the police.

897
01:24:33,506 --> 01:24:34,973
Can I sleep in your chair again?

898
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,104
Let's talk upstairs.

899
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:42,804
Last time you said you're a cop.

900
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:44,735
Is it true?

901
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:46,399
It was true.

902
01:24:47,478 --> 01:24:48,706
But I'm not so sure now.

903
01:24:54,046 --> 01:24:55,604
So what's your plan?

904
01:24:56,413 --> 01:24:59,109
I don't know. Still thinking.

905
01:25:13,386 --> 01:25:15,320
There's one thing I've been trying to
tell you for a while.

906
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,447
But it's too embarrassing.

907
01:25:25,089 --> 01:25:27,023
I told you I dreamt about you all the time

908
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:29,015
it's true.

909
01:25:37,394 --> 01:25:38,588
Me too.

910
01:26:22,575 --> 01:26:26,135
Remember my secret. Goodbye

911
01:26:42,882 --> 01:26:43,849
Mary.

912
01:26:44,915 --> 01:26:47,406
What is it? Has it broken down?

913
01:26:58,453 --> 01:27:00,580
This morning
the guys from the stereo shop came.

914
01:27:01,689 --> 01:27:03,520
They have tuned it up already.

915
01:27:05,356 --> 01:27:07,620
They also left a CD sampler for you.

916
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:10,155
I've listened to it.

917
01:27:16,559 --> 01:27:18,151
Have you had breakfast yet?

918
01:27:18,593 --> 01:27:19,719
I'll get you some.

919
01:27:21,061 --> 01:27:22,221
Iced tea?

920
01:27:23,329 --> 01:27:24,523
Chinese buns?

921
01:27:25,797 --> 01:27:26,855
Sure.

922
01:27:42,669 --> 01:27:45,432
I can't finish my novel.

923
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:51,631
I don't know whether he's good or bad.

924
01:27:54,972 --> 01:27:57,406
I think only he knows.

925
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,638
A shipment will come in next week.

926
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,302
They are watching closely.

927
01:28:04,242 --> 01:28:05,766
You do what you need to do.

928
01:28:06,609 --> 01:28:08,201
I will handle the rest.

929
01:28:09,811 --> 01:28:12,541
The file is open. I can't handle it.

930
01:28:12,846 --> 01:28:14,438
So you're not worried about me.

931
01:28:15,978 --> 01:28:17,878
You are worried about yourself
Inspector Lau.

932
01:28:22,581 --> 01:28:23,809
Are the voices crisp enough?

933
01:28:24,116 --> 01:28:25,174
The precious recording

934
01:28:26,016 --> 01:28:28,007
was taken from Sam's office

935
01:28:29,017 --> 01:28:30,109
it's not your lucky day.

936
01:28:31,085 --> 01:28:33,348
Don't threaten me. What do you want?

937
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:35,081
I want my identity back

938
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:38,613
3 pm, Central Ferry Pier.
Keep your cell on.

939
01:29:02,428 --> 01:29:04,952
The number you have dialed cannot be
connected.

940
01:29:05,196 --> 01:29:07,255
Please leave a message after the beep.

941
01:29:08,496 --> 01:29:10,430
Mary, I'm sorry.

942
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:13,154
I've chosen to be the good guy.

943
01:29:13,865 --> 01:29:15,526
I'm going to meet Yan now.

944
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:18,965
No matter what
I'll give him back his identity.

945
01:29:19,433 --> 01:29:21,162
The file is in my computer.

946
01:29:21,767 --> 01:29:23,428
The password is your birthday.

947
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:41,622
You sure know what you're doing.

948
01:30:41,961 --> 01:30:43,428
I also went to the cadet school.

949
01:30:47,063 --> 01:30:50,089
Do all undercover cops like rooftops?

950
01:30:52,131 --> 01:30:55,031
Unlike you, I'm not afraid of light.

951
01:30:56,899 --> 01:30:58,161
So where's the stuff I want?

952
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,964
I don't think you've brought
what I want either.

953
01:31:07,103 --> 01:31:08,194
So what does this mean?

954
01:31:09,236 --> 01:31:10,863
We came up here to sunbathe?

955
01:31:12,904 --> 01:31:14,371
Give me a chance.

956
01:31:15,738 --> 01:31:17,103
How?

957
01:31:19,306 --> 01:31:20,705
I have no choice before

958
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,907
but now I want to turn over a new leaf.

959
01:31:28,076 --> 01:31:29,100
Good.

960
01:31:31,344 --> 01:31:32,470
Try telling that to the judge.

961
01:31:33,978 --> 01:31:35,468
See what he has to say.

962
01:31:38,847 --> 01:31:40,336
You want me dead?

963
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:43,442
Sorry, I'm a cop.

964
01:31:43,614 --> 01:31:44,581
Who knows that?

965
01:32:01,554 --> 01:32:02,680
Don't move. Police.

966
01:32:03,888 --> 01:32:05,856
Drop your weapon and let Inspector Lau
go first.

967
01:32:06,321 --> 01:32:07,948
Your boss is Sam's mole.

968
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,383
I got evidence.

969
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,179
Let's clear this up at the station.

970
01:32:11,656 --> 01:32:13,681
Drop your weapon now.

971
01:32:13,957 --> 01:32:15,049
I've called the police.

972
01:32:15,291 --> 01:32:16,258
Why should I trust you?

973
01:32:16,525 --> 01:32:17,719
You don't have to.

974
01:32:41,434 --> 01:32:42,661
You'd better watch out.

975
01:32:44,167 --> 01:32:45,498
Look who's talking.

976
01:33:30,382 --> 01:33:33,840
I wish you every success in
the police force.

977
01:33:36,285 --> 01:33:37,616
Bottoms up, officers.

978
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:43,517
No sweat. We are brothers.

979
01:33:44,787 --> 01:33:46,186
Sam is dead now.

980
01:33:48,788 --> 01:33:49,982
You have to look after me.

981
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,490
I joined the cadet school in 1994.

982
01:33:59,026 --> 01:34:02,017
But my career never really takes off.

983
01:34:03,394 --> 01:34:05,089
Sam looked down on me.

984
01:34:05,894 --> 01:34:07,657
I've taken care of Sam's tape.

985
01:34:08,295 --> 01:34:10,593
Don't worry. I'll follow you from now on.

986
01:34:12,697 --> 01:34:15,791
Our folks will be here any minute
Let's give them a good show

987
01:34:21,799 --> 01:34:25,257
I'm actually quite smart.
Too bad Sam never knew that.

988
01:35:06,114 --> 01:35:07,445
I'm a cop.

989
01:35:32,656 --> 01:35:35,021
<i>Six months later, Dr. Lee Sum Yee

<i>Chen Wing-yan is now buried
next to SP Wong Chi-shing.</i>

993
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:29,009
How are you, Mr. Policeman?

994
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:11,355
Those who break the rules will be like him.

995
01:37:11,755 --> 01:37:12,949
They will be expelled.

996
01:37:14,023 --> 01:37:15,991
Anybody wants to trade place with him?

997
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,758
I do.

998
01:37:33,670 --> 01:37:35,237
