00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,150
<涅盘经>第十九卷
< Nirvana Sutra > Verse 19

2
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,640
八大地狱之最 称为无间地狱
The worst of the Eight Hells is called Continuous Hell

3
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,820
为无间断遭受大苦之意 故有此名
It has the meaning of Continuous Suffering. Thus the name

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,250
五年前
5 years ago

5
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,670
屯门大兴村
we started valet parking in Tuen Mun.

6
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,210
皇宫大酒楼门口的停车档
at Palace Restaurant in Tai Hing Estate

7
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,340
开张大吉
Tuen Mun.

8
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,390
我和弟兄们雄心壮志
We were full of ambition.

9
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,320
谁知道开张还不到半个月
But 2 weeks had hardly gone by

10
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,710
每天平均被人扫荡一点三次
and the cops started busting us every day.

11
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,080
一年内
Within one year

12
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,790
死了六个兄弟
6 of our brothers died.

13
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,800
佛祖保佑
Thanks to the Buddha, my life has been spared.

14
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,790
算命的说我是 "一将功成万骨枯"
"What thousands must die so that Caesar may become great."

15
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,460
不过我不同意
But I don't believe in destiny.

16
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,380
我认为出来混的
The rule of this game

17
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,080
是生是死要由自己决定
is to take fate in our own hands.

18
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,380
你们跟着我的日子最短
You are the newest in my gang.

19
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,210
底子最干净
Your records are the cleanest.

20
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,020
路怎么走 让你们自己挑啊
You can choose your own future.

21
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,780
好了
OK.

22
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,570
祝你们
I wish you guys

23
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,830
在警察部一帆风顺
every success in the police force.

24
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,230
干杯 各位长官
Bottoms up, officers.

27149
27149

26
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
十分钟前你进来过
you were here 10 minutes ago.

27
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,920
我桌上有几个档案夹?
How many files were on my desk?

28
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,420
六个 四个米色在左边
Six, sir. Four beige ones on the left

29
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,690
一个红色和一个白色在右边 长官
one red and one white on the right.

30
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,060
你觉得我这人人怎么样?
What do you think of me?

31
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,600
对不起长官 不清楚
Sorry, I'm not sure, sir.

32
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,490
不过长官今天早上应该很匆忙
But I know you're in a hurry today

33
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,060
因为您穿了不同的袜子
'coz your socks don't match.

34
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,030
27149 先出去
27149, you can go now.

35
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,260
是 长官
Yes, sir.

36
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,000
五百 快点给钱
You owe me $500.

37
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,320
行了 下个月发了薪水再给你
Okay, but wait till pay day next month.

38
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,800
我说了,他最适合做卧底
I told you he would make the best undercover cop

39
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,950
进了警校,就要遵守警校的规矩
Now that you're in the cadet school you should follow the rules

40
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,360
不守规矩的人,就好像他这样
Those who break the rules will be like him

41
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,640
滚蛋
They will be expelled

42
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,080
有没有人想跟他交换?
Who wants to trade place with him?

43
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,130
我想跟他换
I do

44
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,440
27149
27149

45
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,860
这是个长时间的卧底计划
this is a long-term undercover mission

46
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,100
你在警察学校的记录会被删除
Your records in the cadet school will be erased

47
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,740
只有我和重案组的黄督察
Only Superintendent Wong and I

48
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,050
知道你的身份
know of your identity

49
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,430
你接受的是一个非常危险的任务
This mission is highly dangerous

50
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,950
你清楚了吗?
is that clear?

51
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,190
是,长官
Yes, sir

52
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,020
黄Sir,我真的撑不下去啦
Sir, I can't stand it any longer

53
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,050
不是被警察骚扰
I'm either harassed by cops

54
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,760
就是被古惑仔打
or beaten up by gangsters

55
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,280
4927,你是新人
4927, you are still a rookie

56
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,030
凭什么令我满意推荐你升级?
Give me a good reason why I should promote you

57
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,400
撑,你来试试啊,怎么撑啊
Hang on? Why don't you go hang yourself instead?

58
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,680
我在警校拿了优异奖
I won the Silver Whistle Award at the cadet

59
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,540
在学期间获得了高度评价
and have received numerous kudos as an officer

60
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,050
长官,我有信心可以领导警队
I am confident I can lead the police force sir

61
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,930
琛哥
Boss

62
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,550
是，知道了
OK, I got it

63
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,120
走
Move forward

64
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,480
快点
Hurry up

65
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,950
现在你到那边去拍张照
Please go over there to take your mugshot

66
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,050
请问
Excuse me

67
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,300
- 有没有人? - 什么事
- Hello? - Can I help you?

68
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,860
啊 没有没有 我想试试那个
Can I try this stereo?

69
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,750
你用什么喇叭?
What speakers are you using?

70
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,340
没有 有什么好介绍的?
Nothing special, any recommendations?

71
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,860
这部 标准港产货 一万多
Try this tube amplifier, made in Hong Kong, 10 grand only.

72
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,380
加上千多块的本地线
And use this cable, also locally made about 1000.

73
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,960
比得上十几万的欧洲货
The sound is as good as expensive European amps.

74
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,180
高音甜 中音准 低音沉
Sweet high notes, crisp middle, strong bass.

75
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,460
总之一句话 就是通透
In a word, transparent.

76
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,560
来 过来听听
Come and listen.

77
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,990
立体感多强
Human voices are drifting towards you.

78
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,650
感觉到没有?
See that?

79
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,730
就好像在你面前唱一样
Voices are indeed drifting towards you.

80
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,220
你试试这个
Try this one.

81
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,860
你听老音乐呢 这种好
This is ideal for listening to oldies.

82
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,950
怎么样?
What do you think?

83
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,510
真的不错
Much better indeed.

84
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,020
要是我买一整套 有折扣没有?
Any discount if I buy the whole set?

85
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,970
胆机在这儿买
Buy the tube amp here

86
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,820
喇叭就不要了
but not the speakers.

87
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,090
祥威便宜点
Go to Cheung Wai; it's cheaper there.

88
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,350
我找谁啊?
Whom should I ask for?

89
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,700
你就说阿仁介绍的
Just tell them Yan sent you.

90
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,300
哪张是我的?
Which one is mine?

91
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,260
中间那张
The one in the middle.

92
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,960
OK 谢谢
Okay, thanks.

93
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,220
谢了
You're welcome.

94
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,650
现在去祥威有人在吗?
Is Cheung Wai open yet?

95
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,820
有啦
Sure.

96
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,680
喂 你臭小子
You bastard.

97
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,050
我叫你帮我看着 你吃里爬外
I told you to watch the store not to send my customers away.

98
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,190
你的喇叭是卖得贵嘛
But your speakers are over-priced.

99
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,500
我不卖贵点
If I don't sell them at this price

100
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,310
哪有钱交保护费给你们这些老大呀?
how can I afford to pay "protection money"?

101
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,280
那你不交试试看啦
You can try not paying for a change.

102
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,230
哎 我的线
Hey, the cable.

103
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,220
借用两天
I'll return it in a few days.

104
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,590
四千多块 你借用两天
$4,000 for a few days?

105
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,560
去哪儿呀?
Where are you rushing to?

106
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,770
去送殡
A funeral.

107
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,210
你说
Tell me.

108
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,680
你光是伤人已经好几次了
How many times have you been busted for assault?

109
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,830
我千方百计和律政司说
I am trying to convince the Department of Justice

110
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,950
你心理有问题
that you have psychological problems

111
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,380
叫你看心理医生
and need to see a shrink.

112
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,770
你还到处打人
But you keep on beating people up.

113
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,630
你是不是真的心理变态?
Are you really going nuts?

114
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,850
你忘了自己是好人还是坏人了?
Have you forgotten you're a cop?

115
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,540
明明说好三年 三年之后又三年
You told me it's only for 3 years.

116
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,490
三年之后又三年
But after 3 years come another 3 years, and another.

117
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,020
就快十年了 老大
It's almost 10 years already, boss.

118
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,580
你对我态度好点行不行?
Can't you be a bit more courteous to me?

119
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,430
现在全香港只有我知道你的身份
I'm the only one in Hong Kong who knows your real identity now.

120
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,300
我回去把你的档案全都删除掉
Maybe I'll just erase your file

121
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,270
你一辈子做古惑仔 我也不用烦了
so you can stick with the Triads for good.

122
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,000
你想我怎么样
What do you want me to do?

123
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,530
天天提醒自己 我是警察
Remind myself I'm a cop every day?

124
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,750
做梦的时候都说
Shouting out "Drop your gun, I'm a cop."

125
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,110
"放下枪 我是警察!"这样?
even in my dreams?

126
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,100
韩琛什么时候进货?
When will Sam place his order?

127
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,300
不知道
No idea.

128
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,080
这个星期
Sometime this week.

129
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:09,990
什么?
What?

130
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,360
这个星期之内
Sometime this week.

131
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,510
泰国佬已经来了
The Thais are here.

132
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,690
韩琛收了货 去卖给别人
Once the goods arrive, Sam will resell them.

133
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,680
货仓在哪儿?
Where is the warehouse?

134
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,810
我怎么知道那货仓在哪儿?
How the hell do I know?

135
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,670
我才跟了他三年
I started working for him only 3 years ago.

136
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,090
这案子一破就退休
Okay, I'll let you retire after this.

137
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,490
你少来
Bullshit.

138
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,550
这句话我听了九千多次
I heard this a zillion times already.

139
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,280
又是这些破玩意儿(偷听器)?
Shit. These mikes again?

140
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,620
警察部那么有钱
The Police is loaded with cash

141
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,540
能不能换点先进的
tell them to get more advanced models.

142
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,140
植入体内的 要不要?
How about implanting it into your body?

143
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,320
植在哪儿?

You know they can't stand the cold.

329
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,500

嘿 这连鬼影子都没有

大家都一样
Same here.

390
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,130
哦 我想起一个故事
I remember a story.

391
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,830
有两个傻瓜在医院里边等着换肾
Two fools are waiting for their kidney transplants

392
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,240
但肾呢 就只有一个
but only one kidney is available.

393
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,590
那么两个人就玩一个游戏

394
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,960
一个人把一张牌摆在对方的口袋里
They each put a playing card into the other's pocket.

Whoever guesses the card in their own pocket wins.

396
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,600

397

I will.

402
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,610

By the way

403
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,950
如果谁输的话就会死
whoever loses the game will die.

404
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,560
看你什么时候死
Let's see when you're gonna die.

405
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,860
你见过有人去摈仪馆和死尸握手吗

00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,220
我只知道他用的是摩斯密码
I only know he uses Morse codes.

435
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,070
那好 你把昨天晚上那些人的资料全都给我
Give me all the information on the people around you last night.

436
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,960
真名啦 身份证啦 银行号码
Their real names, ID card no., account no., etc.

437
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,860
今晚见 13楼
See you tonight, at the cinema

438
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,960
就这样
OK.

439
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,560
怎么了?
What's the matter?

440
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,630
29
29

441
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,150
28
28

442
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,830
29啊
29

443
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,970
我在说我的小说 我写的那本小说
I'm talking about my novel.

444
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,800
我想到写什么了 来来来 过来 过来
I know what I'm going to write about. Come here.

445
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,100
我可以写那个男主角有二十八种性格
I can write about a man with 28 different personalities.

446
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,490
你是说我啊?
Are you talking about me?

447
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,080
你正经一点嘛
Be more serious.

448
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,500
喂 你想一想啊
Think about it.

449
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,610
一个人有二十八种性格
A man with 28 personalities.

450
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,660
也就是说 他每天起床就自己跟自己演戏
That means he starts role playing the minute he wakes up.

451
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,070
演得他连自己的
He is no longer certain

452
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,390
真实性格都忘了
which personality is the real him.

453
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,780
是不是很恐怖啊?
Isn't it scary?

454
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,830
很恐怖嘛
Very much.

455
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,250
很棒的
Good?

456
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,550
很棒 一定很畅销
Yeah. Will be a bestsellerfor sure.

457
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,380
喂 等等等等
Wait...

458
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,140
干嘛?
What is it?

459
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,550
凳子为什么这么大啊?
Why is the ottoman so big?

460
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,010
哪张啊?
Which one?

461
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,630
哎呀 我尺寸量大了 量错了
I must have gotten the measurements wrong.

462
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,470
你别这样 你别这样哦
Take it easy.

463
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,150
你们这些女孩子啊...
You women...

464
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,240
行了 行了 让我来看啊
Let me see. Get up slowly.

465
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,210
你别发脾气
Don't be mad.

466
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,190
见面?
Meet up?

467
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,350
你想我死呀?
You want me dead?

468
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,050
现在警局里有鬼
There's a mole in the police station

469
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,640
你先把他揪出来
Dig him outfirst.

470
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,490
那谁是啊?
So who is he?

471
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,290
好 我不跟你说了
I can't talk anymore.

472
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,590
什么?
What?

473
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,470
刚才?
Just now?

474
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,180
看跌打医生啊
I was at a Chinese chiropractor.

475
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,190
现在看心理医生
I'm seeing the shrink now.

476
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,900
我心理变态呀!就这样
I'm going psycho. That's it.

477
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,590
哇 这张椅子真是...太棒了
This chair is really... incredible.

478
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,300
那你应该买一张回家
Why don't you get one for yourself?

479
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,050
不用每次都来这边睡
So you don't need to come here and sleep every time.

480
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,670
你这里舒服一点嘛
It's more comfortable here.

481
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,460
别这么小器
Don't be so peevish.

482
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,320
这四个月 要不是我每个星期来睡一觉
During these 4 months, if it weren't for me

483
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,300
你那有时间打游戏机
you wouldn't have the time to play computer games.

484
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,800
是五个月
It's 5 months.

485
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,640
还有一个月 你的强制性治疗就结束
In one more month, your mandatory therapy will be over.

486
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,530
到时你能回家慢慢睡了
You can sleep peacefully at home then.

487
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,220
这么快结束啊?
So soon?

488
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,740
但是我好像没什么进展
I don't seem to have improved at all.

489
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,930
要不你写个报告 让我多看一段时间
Why don't you just prolong my treatment.

490
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,250
哦对 还有 最近我的头呢...好像要裂开似的
Besides, my head is splitting these days.

491
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,480
会不会是精神分裂啊??
Could it be schizophrenia?

492
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,860
这叫头痛 我开点必理痛给你
This is called "headache". I'll prescribe some Panadol for you.

493
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,260
其实有件事我想问你
Actually, there's something I want to ask you

494
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,460
但又觉得
but...

495
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,600
好像有点不太好意思
it's kind of embarrassing.

496
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,390
你觉得我人怎么样?
What do you think of me?

497
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,680
就是说 你觉得我是一个好人呢 还是个坏人?
Do you think I'm a good guy or a bad guy?

498
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,550
我都不知道你是什么人
I hardly know who you are.

499
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,520
告诉你一个秘密 不要告诉别人
Tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone.

500
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,200
其实我是警察
I'm actually a cop.

501
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,100

So am I.

00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,960
这两天我会把他揪出来 你准备一下
I'll find outwho he is in a couple of days. Get ready for action.

578
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,950
阿仁
Yan.

579
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,570
这么多兄弟 我最信你了
Of all the brothers, I trust you the most.

580
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,080
小刘 小刘 早啊 来来来来
Lau.

581
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,460
来一根 不要了
No, thanks

582
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:23,970
兄弟们
These folks.

583
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:26,570
差不多你都认识 用不着介绍了
You know most of them no need for introduction, right?

584
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,900
不是 我是说...
No, but...

585
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,970
怎么?
Why?

586
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:31,190
他们怎么?
They are so...

587
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,940
在这时候来啊 谁都知道你查内鬼
Who doesn't know you're sent here to find the mole?

588
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,130
怎么样?来杯咖啡吧?
What do you want them to do? Pour you a cup of coffee?

589
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,640
不遭人嫉是庸才 对不对?
Only an idiot will not be envied, right?

590
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,560
不不过他们谁都想查出来那个内鬼到底是谁
They all want to know who the mole is

591
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,650
如果你想查谁尽管说
Just tell me whom you want to investigate.

592
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,590
好
OK.

593
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,630
有线索吗?
Any clues?

594
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,460
两天以前呢 我的卧底
Two days ago, my informer

595
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,860
差一点查到这个内鬼是谁
nearly found outwho he was.

596
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,290
不过可惜被他跑了
Too bad he lost him.

597
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,950
但我想韩琛要出货呢
But if Sam is getting a new shipment

598
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,910
他一定会再找这个内鬼的
he must contact the mole again.

599
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,170
我想盯着韩琛 应该行
Justfollow Sam and we'll getwhatwe want.

600
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,270
有道理 多教我两招
That's right. I've much to learn from you.

601
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,720
你千万别这么说
Don't say that.

602
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,460
上头一定觉得你有本事才派你来的
Our seniors sent you here because they think you can do it.

603
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,680
你以为内务部的工作谁做都行啊?
Not everyone can handle IA tasks.

604
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,750
这里太闷了
It's stuffy here.

605
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,150
出去聊吧
Let's get out of here.

606
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,470
重案组的咖啡啊 是总部最好的
The coffee here is the best in the headquarters.

607
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,560
你也来一杯
I'll pour you a cup.

608
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:47,520
我的卧底差一点查到这个内鬼是谁
My informer nearly found outwho the mole was.

609
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:49,310
但我想韩琛要出货呢
But if Sam is getting a new shipment

610
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,490
他一定会再找那个内鬼
he must contact the mole again.

611
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,430
喂?
Yes?

612
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,570
喂
Hey.

613
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:59,880
怎么?
Yes?

614
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,390
床到了
The bed has arrived.

615
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,270
到啦?舒不舒服?
Is that so? Comfortable?

616
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,470
你要不要试一试啊?
You want to try it?

617
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,300
神经 赶稿子呢
Don't be silly. I have work to do.

618
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,810
考虑一下
Think about it.

619
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,690
不考虑 不考虑
No, I can't.

620
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:15,740
来嘛
Come on.

621
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:16,900
下个星期六
Saturday.

622
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,520
下个星期六有空再跟你试
I'll be free next Saturday. We can try it then.

623
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,300
好吧
OK.

624
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,460
星期六
OK, next Saturday then.

625
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,070
再见
Bye.

626
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,100
Bye
Bye.

627
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,060
醒了?
Up already?

628
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,370
醒了
Yes.

629
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,230
你刚刚试完床 又工作啦?
We just tested the bed and you are working again?

630
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,760
勤奋嘛
I'm very hardworking.

631
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:37,850
写到哪儿啦?
What are you writing now?

632
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,380
写到这里了
Here.

633
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,840
其实这本书的男主角挺惨的
The more I think of it, the more pathetic the main character appears.

634
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:45,440
恩 很惨
Pathetic indeed.

635
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,940
真的?那写好一点
Perhaps I should make him a happier guy.

636
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:49,020
好 好
Good.

637
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,950
写他做回好人吧
Should I turn him into a good guy?

638
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,760
他是个好人 不过他又做错事
Even though he is good he has done bad things.

639
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,160
那结局应该怎么样啊?
So how should it end?

640
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,930
结局呢也是个问题
That's a good question.

641
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,410
不过就留给你们这些文人吧
I'll leave this to you writers.

642
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,110
你不睡?帮帮忙嘛
You're not going to sleep? Help me, please.

643
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,260
你不睡?
Help me, please?

644
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:09,510
我不行
I can't.

645
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,720
你先睡吧 你太累了
Go to sleep. You are tired.

646
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,090
大B 从今天开始
From now on

647
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:32,420
二十四小时跟着黄警官
follow SP Wong around the clock.

648
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,360
迪路啊 我知道怎么样分辨谁是警察了
Piero, I know how to spot a plainclothes.

649
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,090
怎么分?
How?

650
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,040
总之那个人在做事情
If he seems to be doing something

651
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,540
但又不专心的做事情看着我们的
but is paying attention to us instead

652
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,370
那就应该是警察
then he is a cop.

653
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,310
对呀
Is that so?

654
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,230
满街都是警察?
Then the whole place is filled with cops.

655
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,690
好多的啊
They're everywhere.

656
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,440
阿仁
Yan.

657
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,160
琛哥
Boss.

658
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:41,880
看什么?
Watching something?

659
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,350
你是警察
You are a cop.

660
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,490
我们在猜谁是警察
We are guessing who a cop is.

661
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,840
靠 这么无聊
How trivial.

662
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:51,890
按摩去不去?
I'm going for a massage, wanna come?

663
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,110
我最讨厌了
I hate it.

664
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,110
别跟人说哦
Don't tell.

665
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:57,920
我就说
Tell on him.

666
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,960
我不说
I won't.

667
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,440
这么巧?
What a coincidence.

668
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,930
对呀 刚好在这附近买东西
Yes, I was shopping in the hood.

669
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,120
很久没见了
Haven't seen you for ages.

670
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:14,740
六 七年了吧
6 or 7 years already

671
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,610
还好吗?
How are you?

672
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,620
我结婚了 你呢?
I'm married. How about you?

673
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,340
还在道上混?
Still working in...?

674
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,530
妈咪
Mommy.

675
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:35,620
你女儿啊?
Your daughter?

676
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:36,650
嗯
Yes.

677
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,230
多大了?
How old is she?

678
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,460
五岁
5 years old.

679
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:46,460
我在等我老公来接我 所以...
I'm waiting for my husband's car, so...

680
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,000
我也赶时间
I'm also in a hurry.

681
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:49,680

妈咪 我今年六岁啦
Mommy, I'm 6 already.

684
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,190
对不起 妈咪说错了
Sorry, I always get itwrong.

685
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,550
你在哪啊?
Where are you now?

686
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,600
正过来啦
On my way.

687
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,220
喂
Hello?

688
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,960

跟着他
Keep following him.

690
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:20,010
喂 头 他上了24楼
Boss, he has gone to the 24th floor.

691
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:21,560
继续监视他
Stay put. Don't do anything rash.

692
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,890
琛哥 查到了
Boss, we've got him.

693
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,980
不知道
I don't know yet.

694
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,940
不过我知道他现在在哪
But I know where he is now.

695

在这里盯着
Keep watch over here.

696
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,060
怎么样?有什么好消息?
So? Any good news?

下个星期有批货到

时间地点还不知道
Time and location yet to be confirmed.

699
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:17,100
韩琛的卧底到现在还没有查到
I still don't know who Sam's mole is

700
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,460
不过他好像很有把握把我挖出来
but he seems confident he can blow my cover.

701
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,390
把你挖出来?
In that case

702
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:31,410
这样的话不要玩啦 我们输定了
we'd better stop it. We're gonna lose for sure.

703
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,380
不会吧?
You are kidding, right?

704
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,890
什么不会?会死人的
What else can we do? It's deadly business.

705
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,150
喂

714
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,010

No.

They are downstairs now.

00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:05,780
干什么?
What are you doing?

717
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,320
把它收起来
Put it away.

718
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:34,560
你从上面走吧
Take the window-washing scaffolding.

你跟我五年了

如果我有个问题想问你

761
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:02,150
就是说如果有兄弟是卧底
If one of your brothers is a mole

762
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,760
你敢不敢杀了他?
will you dare to take him out?

763
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:07,050
他就这样面对面问我 我当然说敢啦
Of course I said yes to his face.

764
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:08,920
你当我真的是傻瓜啊?

结果怎么样呢
What's the result?

766
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,830
当然是找不到那个卧底啦
Of course they couldn'tfind the mole.

767
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:20,570
哇 那个警察硬骨头
The cop was tough.

768
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:22,490
把他抓了上去
They dragged him upstairs

769
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,320
他们把他抓了上去 足足打了十分钟
and beat him up for a good 10 minutes.

770
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:27,780
十分钟
10 minutes...

771
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,240
十分钟
10 minutes...

772
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,580
一句话都没有说过
He didn't say a word.

773
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,100
傻强
Keung.

774
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:47,860
琛哥说
Boss said...

775
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:51,220
那个警察很会掩饰
the cop was hot on his trail.

776
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:57,900
今天谁没出现 谁就是卧底
Who didn't show up today is the mole.

777
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,110
我没有
I didn't...

778
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,430
我没说你去按摩
tell him you wentfor a massage.

779
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,370
让琛哥知道你去按摩 你肯定倒霉了
If Boss knew, you're dead meat.

780
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,370
仁哥 我好想问你
Yan, I want to ask you something.

781
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,820
今天那个按摩女郎漂亮吗?
How was the masseuse today?

782
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,260
你知道
Because...

783
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,220
按摩女郎不漂亮那就没劲了
if she's ugly, it's notworth it.

784
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,340
快走
Leave right away.

785
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,800
撞了车 很多警察会来
There will be lots of cops after a car crash.

786
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,120
总之呢 你要记住
Anyway, remember this:

787
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,310
如果哪个人
If you see someone

788
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:50,780
他做事不专心 又看着你的话
doing something without paying attention to it but at the same time watching you

789
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:55,750
他就是警察
then he is a cop.

790
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,390

你们CIB为什么跟踪黄警司?

这是内务部的事
That's IA's business.

805
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,530
现在黄警司死了

806
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:28,130
就和我们重案组有关系

What kind of attitude is that?

810
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:35,660
我们高层的事用不着你管?
So we seniors have to ask for your approval, huh?

811
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:37,000
现在你的人做错了
Your people have made a mistake now.

812
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:38,750
不然黄警司不会死 知道吗?

813
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,960

01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,710
黄警司的计算机里面
SP Wong has a file

821
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,960
有他派去韩琛那里做卧底的档案

不过有密码锁着

黄警司是个好警察

那警察整天跟着我

01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,440
琛哥
Boss.

865
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,390
怎么样?阿仁
What is it, Yan?

866
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,210
我干掉了傻强
I have taken care of Keung already.

867
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,640
有没有找人看过那货仓?
Did you ever send him to the warehouse?

868
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,860
如果他知道在哪就麻烦了
Itwill be disastrous if he knows where it is.

869
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,370
琛哥
Boss. It's me.

870
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,730
你用不着自己去吧
You don't have to go yourself.

871
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,050
我不想有人知道密码
I don'twant anyone to know the password.

872
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,390
明白
I understand.

873
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:51,030
我帮你把人调开
I'll send everyone away.

874
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:00,910
张警官
Inspector Cheung.

875
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,870
叫跟踪韩琛的人回来
Tell those boys to stop following Sam's gang.

876
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,500
我收到消息 韩琛正要去他的货仓
I got information that Sam is heading towards the warehouse.

877
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,930
不撤走跟踪他的人 他是不会去货仓的
He won't go if he's being tailed.

878
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:18,340
要是真想帮黄警司
Just call them back.

879
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,100
做点事的话就现在下班
Let's do something for SP Wong.

880
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,660
你们帮帮忙好不好?
Please help me, OK?

881
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,430
你说句话嘛
Say something.

882
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,060
这件事跟我无关
This is not my case.

883
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,650
陈警司叫我别碰这件事
Officer Chan told me not to get involved.

884
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:34,260
如果大家肯下班 那下班咯
If they're willing to get off duty then it's up to them.

885
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:37,590
我知道黄警司的事情我要负上责任
I know I'm responsible for SP Wong's death.

886
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:38,670
但我跟大家一样
I am also a cop, like you.

887
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,980
我也是警察 我也是为了破案
I want to solve the case too.

888
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:43,220
你不是只想升职的吗?
I thought you only want promotion.

889
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,640
哪 是黄警司的卧底给的情报
It's SP Wong's mole who tipped me off.

890
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:48,630
你们信不信?
Do you believe it or not?

891
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:50,880
过了今晚可能就没机会了 你们想清楚啊
This is our last chance Are you ready to take the risk?

892
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,530
各单位注意 目标车辆
Attention: Target vehicle

893
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,760
现在由广东道转至三号干线

895
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:54,320
上龙翔道往观塘方向

896
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,440
张警官 他们来了二十分钟
They have been here for 20 minutes

897
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,330
上了大厦停车场四楼
they are going to the 4th floor of the car park.

898
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,100
干什么?这案子陈警司不让我碰
Officer Chan won't let me touch this case.

899
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:35,680
出了娄子 你可自己负责
If anything goes wrong, you'll take the blame.

900
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,850
他们正在4P点货
They are loading the goods at 4P.

901
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,010
大象 在3P的出口准备

904

所有人等我的命令
All of you, waitfor my signal.

905
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:12,150
唉 忘了琛哥叫我垫后了
Oh, I forgot Boss told me to stay behind.

906
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:13,400
在前面放下我
Drop me off here.

907
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:00,240
撞他!
Run him over.

908
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,060
我算过命
My Master always said that about my life:

909
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57,530
算命的说我是:一将功成万骨枯
"What thousands must die so that Caesar may become great."

910
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:01,830
路怎样走 你们自己挑了
You choose your own future.

911
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:17,400
你挑的
That's what you have chosen.

912
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:56,920
这杯咖啡是给你的
Coffee for you.

913
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:05,610
他等了你很久了
He's waited a long time for you.

914
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,860
是你呀?
So it's you?

915
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:23,320
那台机器怎么样?
Was the stereo OK?

916
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:24,600
很好
Pretty good.

917
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,830
胆机要预热
Those tube amps have to be warmed up.

918
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,250
预热十数分钟 声音更漂亮
Wait 10 minutes and it sounds great.

919
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,140
要不要给你送礼啊?
Should I salute you?

920
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:32,350
不用
Not, don't.

921
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,480
喂 做卧底多久了?
How long have you been an undercover?

922
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,950
我跟了韩琛三年多
I've followed Sam for 3 years.

923
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:39,800
以前跟过几个老大
I had several other bosses before.

924
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:41,770
加起来差不多有十年吧
All together it's been 10 years.

925
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,130
十年?
10 years?

926
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:44,780
那应该我送礼给你才行啊
I should salute you instead.

927
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,330
恢复我身份就行了
I just want an identity.

928
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:47,960
我只想做个普通人
An identity as a normal man.

929
01:20:49,330 --> 01:20:50,230
厌了?
Getting tired?

930
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,880
你没做过卧底 你不懂
You've never been a mole, you won't understand.

931
01:20:58,370 --> 01:21:00,000
可惜找不到那个内鬼
Too bad I still can'tfind the stooge.

932
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:01,660
找到了我一定不放过他
I'll take him down if I find him.

933
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:11,590
别想那么多了 给你恢复身份
Don'tworry. Let me give you back your identity.

934
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,620
我帮你打开那个档案 可是
I'll open your file but...

935
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,050
我没有密码
I don't have the password.

936
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,720
卧底摩斯密码是什么?
What's the Morse code for "undercover"?

937
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:22,050
就这么简单?
That's it?

938
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:09,320
哇 你这么大个人
Are you serious?

939
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,070
保镖的镖字都写错?
You don't even know to spell "bodyguard"?

940
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:12,010
不是这个?
Isn't it supposed to look like this?

941
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:13,550
当然不是这个啦
Of course not.

942
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:27,640
李医生
Dr. Lee.

943
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,200
还以为你不会来呢
I thought you wouldn't come.

944
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:31,970
警方在通缉你
You're wanted by the police.

945
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:35,340
能不能借你椅子睡一下?
Can I sleep in your chair again?

946
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,490
上去慢慢说吧
Let's talk upstairs.

947
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,180
你上次说你是警察
Last time you said you're a cop

948
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,090
是真的?
Is it true?

949
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:46,780
本来是
It was true.

950
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:49,060
不知道现在还是不是
But I'm not so sure now.

951
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:55,970
那你有什么打算?
So what's your plan?

952
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:59,480
不知道 正在想
I don't know. Still thinking.

953
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,680
有件事我早就想跟你说了
There's one thing I've been trying to tell you for a while.

954
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,790
不过一直觉得不好意思
But it's too embarrassing.

955
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:27,390
我整天做梦见到你这件事
I told you I dreamt about you all the time.

956
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,380
是真的
It's true.

957
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:38,940
我也是
Me too.

958
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:26,470
记着我们的秘密 再见
Remember my secret. Goodbye.

959
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,170
Mary
Mary

960
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:47,740
怎么了 坏了?
What is it? Has it broken down?

961
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:00,910
今天早上音响铺的人来过
This morning the guys from the stereo shop came.

962
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,830
他们帮你调过机器
They have tuned it up already.

963
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,930
还留了张CD给你试机
They also left a CD samplerfor you.

964
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,490
我听了
I've listened to it.

965
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,460
你吃早餐没有?
Have you had breakfast yet?

966
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:20,040
我去帮你买
I'll get you some.

967
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:22,530
冻奶茶?
Iced tea?

968
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:24,860
菠萝包?
Chinese buns?

969
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:27,180
好
Sure.

970
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,760
这本小说我写不下去了
I can'tfinish my novel.

971
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:51,950
我都不知道那个人是好人坏人
I don't know whether he's good or bad.

972
01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:57,720
这个我看只有他自己清楚
I think only he knows.

973
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:00,940
下个礼拜进货
A shipmentwill come in nextweek.

974
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:03,590
风声紧
They are watching closely.

975
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:06,060
你做你的事
You do what you need to do.

976
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:08,500
我这边你不用担心
I will handle the rest.

977
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,850
正在查内鬼 我怕我帮不了你
The file is open. I can't handle it.

978
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,750
原来你不是担心我
So you're notworried about me.

979
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,190
是担心你自己啊 刘警官
You are worried about yourself, Inspector Lau.

980
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:24,100
声音漂亮吗?
Are the voices crisp enough?

981
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:25,470
这些珍贵的录音
The precious recording

982
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:28,320
是我在韩琛的办公室找到的
was taken from Sam's office.

983
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,420
你不走运
It's not your lucky day.

984
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:33,630
用不着唬我 想怎么样?
Don't threaten me. What do you want?

985
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,380
我想恢复身份
I want my identity back.

986
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:38,920
三点钟 港外线码头 开着电话
3 pm, Central Ferry Pier. Keep your cell on.

987
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,230
你现在拨的电话暂时未能接通
The number you have dialed cannot be connected.

988
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,550
请在讯号声后留下您的口讯
Please leave a message after the beep.

989
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,720
Mary 对不起
Mary, I'm sorry.

990
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,440
我选了做好人
I've chosen to be the good guy.

991
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,820
我现在就去见陈永仁

992
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:19,250
不管怎么样 我会恢复他的身份
No matterwhat, I'll give him back his identity.

993
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,430
档案就在我的计算机里面
The file is in my computer

994
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,700
密码是你的生日
and the password is your birthday.

995
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:41,890
挺利索的
You sure know what you're doing.

996
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,670
我也读过警校
I also went to the cadet school.

997
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:50,350
你们卧底可真有意思 老在天台见面
Do all undercover cops like rooftops?

998
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:55,270
我不像你 我光明正大
Unlike you, I'm not afraid of light.

999
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,420
我要的东西呢?
So where's the stuff I want?

1000
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:02,220
我要的你还未必带来呢
I don't think you've broughtwhat I want either.

1001
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,420
什么意思?
So what does that mean?

1002
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,120
你上来晒太阳的?
We came up here to sunbathe?

1003
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,630
给我一个机会
Give me a chance.

1004
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,360

你不用相信我

我是警察

1046
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:34,630

寿长乃无间地狱中之大劫,」
Longevity is a big hardship in Continuous Hell"
