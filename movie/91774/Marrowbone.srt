1
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,780
我們走得很遠，忍受著許多艱辛。

2
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,300
但最後，我們找到了一個我們可以安全的地方。

3
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,120
一起。

4
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,650
在海洋的另一端。

5
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,700
這不是我記得的。

6
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,300
媽媽把她所有的希望寄託了

7
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,680
在她長大的房子裡。

8
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
它一直在等我們，

9
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,550
及時凍結30多年。

10
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,540
有人在嗎？

11
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,300
薩姆，只有一件大衣站在鏡子裡。

12
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,320
不要害怕。

13
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,760
這不是一個輕率的步驟。

14
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,460
我們不再是Fairbairns。

15
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,050
從現在起，我們的姓氏將是“Marrowbone”。

16
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,600
就像這座房子一樣，

17
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,650
這將是我們的新家。

18
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,180
一旦你越過這條線，就沒有回憶。

19
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,980
我們的故事從此開始。

20
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,350
他會找到我們嗎，媽媽？

21
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,810
誰？

22
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,990
你看，我已經越過了界限。

23
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,870
我一定已經忘記了。

24
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,890
沒有人會再打擾我們。

25
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,750
永遠。

26
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,570
我們想相信我們會安全。

27
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,240
我們也有幸福的機會。

28
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,510
隨著我們其餘的問題，媽媽的病消失了。

29
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,920
我們留下的黑暗似乎消失了

30
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,160
鑒於那些夏日。

31
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,380
沒有人知道我們。

32
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,470
我們可以第一次免費。

33
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,310
我們即將結交一位新朋友

34
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,740
那會永遠改變我們的生活。

35
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,450
哦，看那個，山姆！

36
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,500
這一定是他們稱之為“紅魔女岩”的地方。

37
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,840
這是一個頭骨。

38
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,280
讓我們回去吧，比利。我不喜歡它。

39
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,520
誰去那裡？

40
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,220
你怎麼敢侵入我的住宅。

41
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,130
我是Sam Marrowbone。

42
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,790
這是我的兩個兄弟比利和傑克。

43
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,910
這是我的妹妹簡。

44
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,790
你已經進入了紅女巫的土地。

45
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,380
看到你的權利？

46
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,480
你必須穿過它。

47
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,520
如果你的意思是好的，你可以自由走。

48
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,230
但是，如果你將邪惡藏在心中，

49
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,540
牆壁會關閉並永遠陷入你的心裡。

50
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,530
你敢穿嗎？

51
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,470
傑克，不。

52
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,000
-來吧！ - 上，薩米！

53
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,570
勇敢起來。

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,740
牆壁正在關閉，我們不應該在這裡。

55
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,850
你的靈魂一定很好。

56
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,220
這裡非常活潑。

57
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,350
你好，小人物。

58
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,540
靠近點。

59
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,750
我的名字是艾莉。

60
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,240
你是紅魔女的囚犯嗎？

61
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,590
是。

62
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,710
她因為闖入她的花園而懲罰我。

63
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,930
讓我陷入困境直到有人

64
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,050
敢穿過通道並救我。

65
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,040
現在，你是誰？

66
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,190
換取這些橡子。

67
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,280
現在他們不多，但是

68
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,190
他們會與我們的友誼一起成長壯大。

69
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,820
他們是魔術。

70
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,430
所以，現在你是免費的，

71
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,290
你想去哪裡？

72
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,150
在那令人難忘的一天結束時，

73
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,340
艾莉已經是我們中的一員了。

74
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,450
停止。等等，好吧，向前走。

75
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
為什麼？

76
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,460
太漂亮了。我可以嗎...？

77
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,760
靠近在一起，來吧。

78
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,040
你們準備好了嗎？

79
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,380
一二...

80
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,040
大。

81
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,930
完善。

82
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,850
我們再次開始。

83
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,210
我們忘了過去。

84
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,420
我們開始了新的生活。

85
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,810
有一段時間，我們都買了這種幻想。

86
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,410
但是，去美國的旅程已經採取了一點力量

87
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,070
媽媽離開了她。

88
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,070
我們知道的很少，

89
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,700
那將是我們最後一個夏天。

90
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,090
把我埋在花園裡。

91
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,000
我告訴你在哪裡。

92
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,590
你只需要轉21。

93
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,340
保持隱藏，直到那時

94
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,500
沒有法律會從你那裡拿走它們。

95
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,130
向我發誓。

96
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,490
你會留在一起。

97
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,150
始終保持在一起。

98
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,270
我發誓。

99
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,320
準備好安全的地方。

100
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,270
如果他找到你。

101
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,170
在櫃子裡。

102
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,140
在左邊。

103
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,490
你撒謊。

104
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,460
你在法庭上撒謊

105
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,190
你一直都在保存他的錢。

106
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,300
“我最親愛的傑克，

107
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,800
“我很抱歉，隨著你的成長，我不會陪伴你。

108
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,670
“我不再有實力。

109
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,290
“簡將是山姆的母親，因為它本來就是。

110
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,160
“告訴比利不要讓他發怒

111
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,230
“帶著他美麗的心。

112
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,120
“而你，我的傑克，當時機到來的時候，

113
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,770
“不要忘記打開你的心去愛。

114
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,300
“你必須保持安全。

115
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,800
“總是。

116
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,270
你愛的母親Rose Marrowbone“。

117
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,700
沒有，

118
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,920
沒有人，

119
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,330
曾...

120
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,560
將分開我們。

121
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,230
我們是一個。

122
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,820
跟著我重複一遍。

123
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,050
沒有。

124
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,070
沒有。

125
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,100
沒有人。

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,020
-沒有人。 -沒有人。

127
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,770
永遠。

128
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,810
-Ever。 -Ever。

129
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,720
永遠。

130
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,040
我們是一個。

131
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,420
- 我們是一個。 - 我們是一個。

132
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,170
我們封了我們的承諾。

133
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,050
我們開始躲避世界......

134
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,730
直到我21歲。

135
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,690
插口！

136
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
插口！插口！

137
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,990
六個月後

138
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,070
我厭倦了被關在這個房子裡。

139
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,560
傑克，在你生日前不久。

140
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,090
我們應該開始考慮你的派對。

141
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,220
波特律師上周再次掛在圍欄上。

142
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,230
我們很快就會完成他。

143
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,650
耶誕節的時候，情況會有所不同。

144
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,010
你會看到，比利。

145
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,420
比利！比利！

146
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,140
山姆？

147
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,590
我聽到鏡子後面有一個聲音

148
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,100
蓋子脫落。

149
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,330
如果你不做點什麼，

150
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,060
幽靈可能會再次看到我們。

151
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,430
不要成為這樣的寶貝。

152
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,490
你不需要害怕。

153
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,630
山姆，這個幽靈已經走了好幾個月了。

154
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,280
在這裡，給我這個。

155
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,330
惡棍？

156
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,640
來吧，惡棍，來拿你的早餐。

157
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,600
所以這就是在牆後發出噪音的原因。

158
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,160
它是那個大老鼠。

159
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,010
薩姆，別再喂它了。

160
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,260
它正在房子周圍打洞。

161
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,870
你想讓我讓她餓嗎？

162
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,200
你不知道那件事情在哪裡。

163
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,590
好吧？你可能會得到狂犬病。

164
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,670
她不會咬我，她是我的朋友。

165
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,570
可怕的是，狂犬病。

166
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,020
你會從你的嘴裡得到泡沫

167
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,520
直到你的內心都爛掉了。

168
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,100
我將不得不把最後一顆子彈放在你身上。

169
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,560
然後，我會隱藏在鏡子後面，整晚都在尖叫和哭泣

170
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,210
你永遠不會再睡了。

171
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,330
是的，但死者不哭或尖叫。

172
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,950
告訴我，下次你在半夜聽到這個幽靈。

173
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,010
哦，他媽的。

174
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
啊!

175
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,640
插口！

176
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,090
沒有額外的錢，沒有廢話。

177
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,810
我們拭目以待。

178
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,320
你好。

179
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,720
我們會在地圖上跟隨你，傑克，所以你不會感到孤單。

180
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,350
他剛剛離開了Marrowbone的家。

181
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,490
他正在穿過森林。

182
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,580
那是一隻鳥。

183
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,760
然後他走下隧道。

184
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,620
通過隧道。

185
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,400
然後，他走出隧道......

186
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,930
並在橋上...

187
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,760
接著...

188
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,890
哦，他現在應該看看艾莉的農場。

189
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,190
- 說，“嗨，艾莉”！ - 艾莉。

190
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,170
- 我們想你！ -我們想念你。

191
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,560
他經歷了顛簸的泥土。

192
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,320
他走過了這條路。

193
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,960
他一路走來。

194
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,720
現在他正在靠近城鎮。 -哦。

195
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,410
他幾乎在那裡。

196
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,970
然後他走進那家商店。

197
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,950
小心，傑克。

198
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,540
勇敢，傑克。

199
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,660
抓住我，如果你可以！

200
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,700
兩周前的今天...

201
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,340
哦，傑克。

202
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,950
我開始認為你本周不會出現。

203
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,110
嗯，他們聞起來很美味。

204
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,980
你帶來一個清單？

205
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,560
數千人向美國國旗致敬

206
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,380
電線僵硬，以便它會波動。

207
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
然後檢查了登月艙的狀況......

208
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,650
你媽媽的感覺如何？好點？

209
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,290
不是真的。

210
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,250
正是這種天氣變化。

211
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,810
我很遺憾聽到。

212
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,760
不過，我相信她很快會好起來的。

213
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,530
給她我的愛，是嗎？

214
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,360
這些書是什麼？

215
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,690
他們星期五來了。

216
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,120
從曾經在波特蘭工作過的地方在圖書館裡除草。

217
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,460
我說我們讓他們的雜草成為我們的花朵。

218
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,310
我很想你。

219
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,670
我很抱歉上周我沒有做到這一點。

220
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,850
沒關係。

221
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,840
哦，我有你要求的書。

222
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,310
謝謝。

223
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,070
不用謝。

224
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,080
呃，山姆過得怎麼樣？他需要另一個嗎？

225
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,700
他怎麼能讀得這麼快？

226
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,550
它幾乎至少有300頁長。

227
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,070
我想念那個小傢伙。

228
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,810
簡和比利。

229
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,130
對我來說，這很容易就會流行，我可以......

230
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,820
也許我媽媽更好。

231
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,910
你好。

232
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,150
波特先生。

233
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,020
所以？

234
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,470
你怎麼看？

235
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,160
很聰明。

236
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,960
你還記得我在紐約告訴你的那個職位嗎？

237
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,870
Parker＆Jameson。

238
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,220
意思是不是...？

239
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,450
那麼，這意味著它們落在了我的魅力之下，我得到了這份工作。

240
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,330
湯姆，這太棒了。我對你很開心。

241
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,550
無論如何，我碰巧在這條街上漫步，...

242
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,480
我忍不住想...

243
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,320
您。

244
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,900
那是什麼？

245
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,080
這是一個捐贈，如果你願意，為圖書館。

246
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,570
這是第一版，我不可能接受這個。

247
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,460
我只是希望你能看到這個地方。

248
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,700
你會喜歡的。也許我應該帶你一段時間。

249
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,530
你去過紐約市嗎？

250
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,510
傑克費爾貝恩。

251
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,440
現在是Marrowbone。

252
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,420
我們按照我母親的姓氏去。

253
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,730
對，恩，呃...

254
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,590
其中，其他繼承人已經簽署。

255
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,440
我需要收取房地產的轉帳費用。

256
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,950
明天我會到家。

257
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,530
告訴你的母親有一張銀行支票準備好200美元。

258
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,530
她很不舒服。

259
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,490
如果我拿走報紙和報紙，這可能是最好的

260
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,090
我讓我的母親在他們身上簽名並將他們帶回給你。

261
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,300
我需要證明簽名。

262
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,350
我明天會在那裡。中午。

263
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,260
再見，傑克。

264
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,060
我很快就會與你見面。

265
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,470
他媽的律師。

266
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,900
哦，上帝，我知道這個令人毛骨悚然的混蛋會給我們帶來麻煩。

267
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,040
我們在母親的儲蓄中有多少錢？

268
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,900
拉屎。

269
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,560
甚至不到50美元。

270
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,560
即使我賣了一千塊蛋糕，我們也沒有錢。

271
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,230
傑克，我們打算做什麼？

272
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,130
我不知道，但如果真相出來了，他們會分開我們。

273
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,850
插口。

274
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,270
插口。

275
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,790
盒子。

276
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,940
有什麼關係？我們已經沒有了。

277
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,930
- 我可以拿回來。 -沒有！

278
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,640
我們還有什麼要做？

279
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,150
傑克，你答應我，我們再也不會碰那些錢了。

280
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,370
請？

281
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,140
我向你承諾了很多東西。

282
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,000
傑克，我能把它弄回來。

283
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,690
我們有很多錢！

284
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,070
是的，山姆！

285
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,670
是的，我們很有錢！

286
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,310
哦，來吧！

287
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,160
哦，簡，來吧，這是怎麼回事？

288
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,820
這是血錢。我們都知道它來自哪裡。

289
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,130
我們甚至不應該觸摸它。

290
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,370
'這被詛咒。

291
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,870
插口。

292
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,780
我們沒有選擇。

293
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,490
波特明天要來。我們必須做好準備。

294
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,030
這是行不通的。

295
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,260
它會。

296
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,560
它需要看起來像媽媽的。

297
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,070
-請！ -沒有。

298
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,590
這是媽媽的房間。我也應該被允許進去。

299
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,940
這裡有鏡子，你不能進去。

300
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,830
請。

301
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,000
我們要做什麼關於要塞？

302
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,610
我們不會進來。

303
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,080
你在做什麼？

304
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,910
止痛藥媽媽從未參加過。

305
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,110
比利，那可以讓他上山。

306
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,020
只是在緊急情況下。

307
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,150
他在這裡。

308
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,630
每個人都清楚這個計畫？

309
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,240
我忘了打開門。非常抱歉。

310
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,990
毫米。

311
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,890
這是什麼？

312
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,750
母親的積蓄。

313
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,630
我們沒有時間做出改變的安排。

314
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,860
這些是磅。

315
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,400
是的，200磅。

316
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,010
所以？

317
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,850
英鎊的價值是美元的兩倍。

318
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,130
這應該涵蓋所有成本

319
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,870
和...任何費用。

320
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,360
我說了一張銀行支票。

321
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,980
讓我給你喝點東西。

322
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,500
我想請求最後一個人的幫助。

323
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,680
如果沒有太多要問。

324
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,380
我們的母親，她不能起床。

325
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,920
她感到羞恥，你以這種方式看到她的想法。

326
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,620
你介意我把樓上的文件帶上去嗎？

327
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,460
並為他們簽下你的簽名？

328
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,450
讓她簽名兩份。

329
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,220
你會忘記該死的檸檬水嗎？我沒有一整天。

330
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,850
您只需簽署兩份副本。

331
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,960
都？

332
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,050
傑克，不可能兩次簽名！

333
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,900
他會注意到他們不一樣。

334
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,290
你必須這樣做。

335
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,960
- 簡，請，現在。 -一秒！

336
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,070
沒時間了。

337
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,440
簽下第二個。標誌。

338
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,420
簡，他在外面。

339
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,000
簡，他在外面。 - 閉嘴，傑克。

340
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,520
簡，沒有時間。

341
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,280
請。

342
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,910
媽媽，留在床上。

343
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,280
不，媽媽，醫生說你不能起床。

344
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,030
標誌。

345
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,910
幾乎完成。

346
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,090
你不能出來。

347
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,600
他來了，簡。

348
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,620
媽媽。

349
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,610
媽媽，留在床上。

350
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,110
現在！

351
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,650
媽媽，我會去看看波特。

352
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,250
我會在一分鐘後回來。

353
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,950
我很抱歉，我只是......

354
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,950
她是對的嗎？

355
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,120
她只是沒有力量。

356
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,420
我不知道它變得如此糟糕。

357
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,310
所以，這解決了它。

358
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,080
骨髓房現在正式屬於你的母親。

359
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,960
我很高興我們可以......

360
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,520
在有人發現之前將這件事包起來......

361
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,620
你知道，呃...

362
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,200
那個關於你父親的事。

363
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,510
我們非常感謝。

364
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,120
特別是對於您的判斷。

365
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,520
那麼，我最好在下雨之前離開這裡。

366
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,310
祝你好運，Marrowbone先生。

367
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,650
然後他說：“我沒有來這裡野餐，馬羅伯恩先生，

368
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,980
我來這裡進行銀行支票“。

369
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
所以，我浪費了給他另一個檸檬水。

370
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,720
不要拖延不可避免的事情。

371
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,710
親愛的兄弟，是時候認識你的逝世了。

372
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,660
今天，阿拉斯加遊行...

373
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,000
北部西部領土

374
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,550
不能被擊敗。

375
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,250
請記住，勇敢的小兵，

376
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,520
西北地方從未被征服過。

377
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,130
哦，直到今天。

378
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,190
六！

379
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,910
是!

380
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,630
沒有！

381
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,990
哦，哦！

382
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,210
- 你完成了。 -插口！

383
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,700
這是什麼，山姆？

384
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,240
六！

385
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,590
去找骰子。

386
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,740
這並不算數，死亡消失了。

387
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,960
它不會！

388
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,150
-抱歉！ - 快點，山姆。

389
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,350
你這樣殺了我的蒙古人！

390
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,470
那 - 這是真的。

391
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,650
精細。

392
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,560
-精細。 - 抱歉，比利！

393
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,900
不，不，很好，很好。

394
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,150
由於地板算作董事會。

395
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,200
啊，比利！

396
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,800
你是一個痛苦的輸家！

397
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,740
你說地板算作董事會。

398
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,910
山姆，那麼分數是多少？他得到了什麼？

399
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,730
檢查一下，山姆。

400
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,950
一。

401
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,510
哦，艱難的去！

402
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,600
哦，對不起，比利。 - 走了。

403
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,050
另一個是什麼？

404
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,240
比利，我覺得你很緊張。

405
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,830
你是一個緊張的人。

406
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,060
一。

407
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,900
六！

408
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,560
六！

409
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,550
他最好不要攻擊巴西。

410
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,040
插口？

411
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,780
傑克，鬼魂回來了！

412
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,560
去堡壘。

413
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,920
他出門之前先蓋上這個人。

414
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,710
? Wouldn't it be nice if we were older? ?

415
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,020
待在這。
?然後我們不會?

416
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,550
? have to wait so long ?

417
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,220
? And wouldn't it be nice to live together ?

418
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,600
? Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up ?

419
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,990
他永遠不會離開我們。

420
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,430
甚至沒有死亡。

421
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,850
你變黑了。

422
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,960
我不得不出來帶你回來。

423
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,860
我討厭和鬼魂一起生活。

424
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,840
這是錢。

425
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,920
他的幽靈回來了，因為我們用它。

426
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,850
一旦太陽升起，你會放棄它。

427
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,940
讓他把它下地獄。

428
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,380
嘿!

429
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,090
哦你好。

430
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,220
嘿，我可以送你回家嗎？

431
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,070
謝謝波特先生，

432
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,140
但老實說，巴士是沒有麻煩的。

433
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,760
波特先生？湯姆發生了什麼事？

434
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,490
我堅持。

435
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,270
我打算問你一件事，艾莉。

436
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,110
嘿，這些Marrowbone的孩子們......

437
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,960
你對他們有多瞭解？

438
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,940
我想我們是好朋友。

439
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,030
呵呵。

440
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,530
只是他們擔心我。

441
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,840
你知道，他們生活如此孤立。

442
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,130
永遠躲避社區。

443
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,420
他們沒有隱藏。

444
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,970
艾莉，來吧。

445
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,720
這個可憐的孩子，山姆甚至沒有去上學。

446
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,240
他們住得太遠了。

447
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,660
山姆在家接受教育。

448
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,430
簡幫忙做作業，我檢查他的筆記本。

449
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,240
呵呵。

450
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,750
那麼，我想這是一些東西。

451
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,690
這真是太不幸了

452
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,280
他因為他的父親而被迫以這種方式生活。

453
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,210
我的意思是，我想傑克已經告訴了你關於他的一切。

454
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,190
我知道他是一個殘酷的人。

455
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,570
殘忍的人？

456
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,780
這是溫和的。

457
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,390
我曾試圖幫助他們。

458
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,100
至少，我已經能夠把他們的房子安全

459
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,990
在我離開之前，但仍然...

460
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,820
如果真相出來了，

461
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,920
我不知道他們會有什麼樣的未來。

462
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,810
你知道人們在這裡。

463
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,160
薩姆？

464
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
山姆！

465
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,380
山姆，你在哪裡？

466
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,500
還是害怕？

467
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,020
你必須最終走出堡壘。

468
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,090
我想念媽咪。

469
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,440
我也想念她。

470
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,550
她現在在哪兒？

471
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,640
她處於一個好地方。

472
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,560
好吧，我想和她一起去。

473
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,080
我不喜歡躲在這裡，始終獨處。

474
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,720
我們並不孤單。

475
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,660
我們有艾莉。

476
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,720
我會告訴你一些事情。

477
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,130
你看？遵循我的觀點。

478
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,910
看看艾莉的農場？

479
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,560
是啊。

480
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,950
我們在尋找什麼？

481
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,480
等一下。

482
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,840
那真的是她嗎？

483
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,630
她在說什麼？

484
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,660
她說，你好。

485
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,630
- 你想和她說話嗎？ -我說了什麼？

486
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,780
你的名字怎麼樣？

487
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,550
所以她知道你今天在說什麼。

488
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,920
點，點。

489
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,430
點，短劃線。

490
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,530
你好山姆。

491
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,410
她問你好嗎。

492
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,080
我很高興。我怎麼說？

493
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,580
點，點。

494
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,520
點，破折號...

495
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,000
我需要離開這個房子。

496
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,820
大家都這樣做。

497
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,670
插口。

498
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,890
你從來沒有真正告訴過我你的父親。

499
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,970
他是個怪物。

500
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,480
他所做的事情，他們無法形容。

501
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,170
他是我們在這裡跑步的原因。

502
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,250
我們不得不離開他。

503
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,970
他還在英國嗎？

504
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,850
他現在已經死了。

505
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,250
他再也不能傷害我們了。

506
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,540
簡？

507
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,390
薩姆？

508
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,260
我在家！

509
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,650
你去哪兒了？

510
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
出。

511
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,940
出來嗎？

512
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,740
哦，但沒有人離開房子

513
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,300
除非絕對必要，傑克。

514
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,340
你的規則，不是我的。

515
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,480
你知道，我可以聞到她的香水。

516
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,080
每一次。

517
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,430
這很奇怪。

518
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,710
你知道我的意思。

519
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,410
不能指望他一直在這裡。

520
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,080
他們相愛。

521
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,660
簡並不瞭解他的第一件事。

522
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,410
她有問過我們嗎？

523
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,410
當然，她一直都這樣。

524
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,400
是嗎？你告訴她什麼？

525
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,760
是的，我是這麼認為的。

526
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,810
你說的太多了。你會讓我們陷入麻煩。

527
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,570
呃，有人嫉妒。

528
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,390
閉嘴，山姆。為什麼我會嫉妒？

529
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,570
因為傑克有女朋友，你不知道。

530
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,150
我不在乎。

531
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,890
你有吻過她嗎？

532
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,600
這不關你的事。

533
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,670
如果她有一天和我們一起生活會怎樣？

534
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,070
與她在一起的家會是一個更好的地方。

535
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,680
簡，你不可能是認真的。

536
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,410
為什麼我不能和我愛的女孩生活在一起？

537
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,510
我們的承諾呢？

538
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,750
這對你來說意味著什麼？

539
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,210
我做的事情是為了保證你的安全。

540
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,710
安全？

541
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,890
哦，告訴我，這感覺安全嗎？

542
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,580
當你做任何你喜歡的事情時，我們都被困在這裡。

543
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,210
但傑克，那很好。

544
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,320
-安靜。 -精細。

545
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,550
- 也許她應該來 - 保持安靜。

546
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,600
和她住在一起吧，是吧？

547
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,870
為什麼？為什麼要安靜？

548
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,260
-閉嘴。 - 告訴她關於媽媽。

549
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,610
比利！ - 告訴她關於爸爸的真相。

550
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,850
- 為什麼你不能處理它？ -出去！

551
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,650
因為你知道這是事實。

552
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,040
- 你為什麼不告訴她真相？ -出去！

553
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,130
比利！ - 簡，別碰我！

554
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,520
不要關上我的門！

555
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:37,860
-出去！ -為什麼？

556
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,210
-出去！出去！ - 為什麼，因為你要我離開？

557
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,560
- 你想讓我離開嗎？ - 離開我 -

558
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,110
你需要我比我需要你更多！

559
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,030
離開！

560
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,120
你感覺好些了嗎？

561
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,670
噓。

562
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,360
我的頭爆炸了。

563
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,630
輕鬆點他。

564
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,840
他就像一隻籠中的鳥，傑克。

565
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,300
你有薩姆。

566
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,960
你有Allie。

567
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,090
他沒有人。

568
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,230
木乃伊。

569
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:16,710
? I'll keep you safe tonight ?

570
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:25,100
? Promise I won't leave your sight ?

571
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,690
? Should you get lost ?

572
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:35,790
? Follow my voice ?

573
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:41,410
? You and I, we will be ?

574
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,570
? will bring us out ?

575
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:03,660
? No one will tear us apart ?

576
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,270
鬼。

577
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:08,760
? You'll find me here ?

578
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,960
? You and I will ?

579
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,030
插口！

580
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,640
鏡子！

581
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:55,650
什麼？

582
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,940
山姆去過母親的房間。

583
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,420
他說他看到了一些東西。

584
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,810
在衣櫃鏡子裡。

585
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,030
他認為他看到了那個鬼，傑克。

586
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:18,670
那麼，那只是我們告訴薩姆的謊言

587
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,370
所以他不知道真相。

588
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,720
事實是我們圍住了一個男人

589
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,500
讓他死在我們的頭上並腐爛。

590
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,440
我們自己的父親。

591
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,960
他是個兇手，簡。

592
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,210
他來這裡殺了我們。

593
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,920
那我們又是什麼？

594
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,320
我仍然可以記得那些尖叫聲。

595
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,520
那些第一周。

596
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,720
他似乎永遠不會死。

597
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:52,220
覺得他的鬼魂還在那裡真瘋狂嗎？

598
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,100
他現在不能傷害我們。他已經死了，走了。

599
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,150
他沒有離開。

600
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:02,270
我們需要給他一個適當的埋葬。

601
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,710
我們永遠不會回到那個地方。

602
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,750
懂了嗎？

603
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,840
決不。

604
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:14,020
我們不能生活在墳墓裡。

605
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,110
哦，艾莉！

606
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,790
你好。

607
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,440
- 包裝已經？ -是。

608
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,450
呃，其實，我能否看到你一會兒？

609
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,600
-當然。 -大。

610
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,510
謝謝。

611
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,840
天哪，我對這個爛攤子感到抱歉。

612
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,760
這很好。

613
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,440
所以？

614
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,750
有一些我...

615
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,340
這裡。

616
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,870
這是什麼？

617
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,460
打開它。

618
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,150
湯姆，我......

619
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,160
你願意做我的客人嗎？

620
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,600
有很多地方我很樂意告訴你。

621
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,940
湯姆，我......

622
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,220
我真的希望你不會。

623
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,250
I'm rushing too much, aren’t I?

624
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,250
不，它是...

625
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,460
不是那只是呃......

626
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:51,840
我太老了？

627
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,300
你知道我父親比我母親大15歲嗎？

628
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,990
他們結婚愉快

629
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,930
- 40年。請給我。停止。

630
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,800
我從來沒有這樣想過你。

631
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,650
對不起。

632
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,800
呃，關於傑克，不是嗎？

633
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,720
我真的不認為這是你的任何擔憂。

634
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,480
你不知道他的第一件事。

635
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,040
你不知道...

636
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,220
你正在進入什麼。

637
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,030
我只是想保護你。

638
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,570
你知道，我可以讓你離開你不屬於的地方。

639
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,890
你應該考慮一下。

640
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,030
惡棍？

641
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,910
你去哪兒了？

642
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:54,610
最好不要咬我，否則我會把你變成午餐。

643
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,570
出來吧。

644
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,670
不要害怕。

645
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,960
湯瑪斯D.波特。

646
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,940
波特先生，這是薩姆古爾德曼。

647
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,460
古爾德曼先生！

648
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,360
很高興收到你的來信。其實，我剛剛完成...

649
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:35,770
那麼，我們剛剛出席董事會會議

650
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,880
經過一番深思熟慮後，

651
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,200
做出了重要的決定

652
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,950
關於我們公司的未來。

653
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:42,770
洗耳恭聽。

654
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,680
現在是我們成長的時候了。

655
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,580
所以，而不是我們所說的立場，

656
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,180
我們決定讓您成為我們公司的合作夥伴。

657
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,140
那聲音怎麼樣？

658
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,110
那麼，我很榮幸，先生。

659
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:57,550
但為了確保我明白...

660
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,750
我們為您提供很好的機會

661
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,360
購買百分之十的股份。

662
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,460
你在嗎？

663
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,700
我們大概在談論多少？

664
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,820
那麼這是一個5000美元以下的社區。

665
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,560
我認為這不會是一個問題。

666
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,240
對，波特先生？

667
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,640
對。

668
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,680
但是，如果我只想...

669
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,710
我相信我已經明確表達了我的觀點。

670
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:30,890
我們現在需要的是合作夥伴，而不是員工。

671
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,280
搬運工？

672
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,900
搬運工？

673
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,050
那麼，那麼我將不得不考慮它。

674
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,000
那麼不要坐太久。

675
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,110
如果你不感興趣，我們必須轉到我們的下一位候選人。

676
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,080
我相信你明白這一點。

677
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,150
我會在星期一給你打電話。

678
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,040
謝謝，古爾德曼先生。謝謝。

679
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,620
沒有！沒有！沒有！

680
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,190
不，不。

681
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,070
比利？

682
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,670
簡？

683
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:49,620
你媽媽今天感覺如何？

684
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,460
傑克，我們似乎有一個問題。

685
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:57,840
我不能成為偽造的幫兇。

686
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,170
請。

687
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:02,710
我只是想照顧我的家人。

688
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,560
你騙了我。

689
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,610
你試圖欺騙我，這樣做，

690
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,700
你讓我成為你的小玩意兒的配件。

691
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:11,060
所以，我認為你給我提供某種補償是公平的。

692
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,270
我們什麼都沒有！

693
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,480
你有一萬磅，你會把它們交給我

694
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:18,950
所以我可以擺脫這個牛皮並再次穿上真正的鞋子。

695
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,740
現在我假設你會和你的兄弟姐妹討論這個問題。

696
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,160
我明天會來。

697
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,110
我們會做什麼？

698
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:53,180
我們把錢扔到煙囪裡。

699
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,540
我們現在無法讓它恢復。

700
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,980
這一切都結束了。

701
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,860
啊!

702
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:57,020
比利，給我 - 給我......

703
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,380
給我！

704
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,250
- 是的，抱著這個。 -好吧好吧。

705
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,310
啊!

706
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,630
比利。 -什麼？什麼？

707
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:05,010
你做了什麼？

708
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,780
您...

709
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,700
你不敢拆牆。

710
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:13,670
所以......所以它找到了另一條通往閣樓的路。

711
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,630
有人不得不嘗試把這筆錢拿回來。

712
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:17,840
我告訴過你不要進去！

713
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,450
他活了下來，傑克。

714
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:23,560
啊!他活了下來，傑克。

715
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:25,950
他一直在那裡吃東西。

716
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,810
我用我自己的雙眼看到了它。

717
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,440
它會殺死我們所有人。我看到了。

718
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,950
這個地方被動物骨骼覆蓋了！

719
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,470
鴿子，浣熊，老鼠。

720
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,260
你湊 - 你無法想像那裡的惡臭。

721
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,400
他找到了一種存儲雨水的方式。

722
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,500
這是下雨。

723
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,170
- 他還活著......他整個時間都活著。

724
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,960
出去走走。

725
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,290
他得走了。 -請你停下來。

726
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,080
沒有！停下來？

727
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,460
停下來？有人聽我說話嗎？他還活著！

728
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:56,080
並等待一些更多的傷害！

729
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,270
我完成了那個婊子的兒子！

730
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,370
你知道我會的。

731
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,180
我會上去，我會結束這件事，我向上帝發誓！

732
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,780
你在聽我說嗎？你在聽麼？

733
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,180
插口！

734
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:07,810
插口！

735
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:15,560
插口。

736
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,810
噓，冷靜，傑克。

737
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,250
噓。插口！

738
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,700
插口！

739
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,040
我們必須告訴Allie。

740
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,950
她是唯一能幫助他的人。

741
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,100
不，她會很害怕，她......

742
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:42,070
她不想再見到他。

743
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:44,370
她愛他，比利。

744
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,750
現在唯一重要的是節省傑克。

745
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:51,000
我們必須告訴Allie真相。

746
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,850
你好？

747
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,180
有人在家嗎？

748
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:33,790
我來為我的錢！

749
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:35,570
你好！

750
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:54,680
“我們把父親鎖起來的那天，和其他人一樣。

751
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:58,390
沒有人能夠警告我們，他終於找到了我們“。

752
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,880
插口！

753
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,210
山姆！

754
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,610
以山姆為例。

755
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,110
來吧，這樣！

756
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:23,290
- 讓我和你一起去。 - 不，你留在簡和薩姆。

757
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,690
沒有！插口！

758
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,190
-插口！ -插口？

759
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,660
在這裡應該是安全的。

760
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,150
嘿，傑克！

761
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,410
-插口！ - 我會處理他。

762
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:34,420
插口！不，傑克！

763
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,990
我已經知道了！

764
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,150
我就在這裡！

765
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,940
這是你和我之間的！

766
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,600
遠離房子，我會放棄！

767
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,770
這是我和我一個人。

768
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,380
我把你嚇跑了。

769
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:43,920
我拿走了你的錢。

770
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,470
他們沒有任何關係。

771
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,690
拿去

772
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,490
並留下我們一個人。

773
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,520
插口？

774
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,260
殺他，比利。

775
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:28,550
我來了！

776
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:30,410
我來了！

777
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:36,190
山姆！

778
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,260
山姆，我來了！

779
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,490
簡。

780
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:50,690
簡，比利，山姆！

781
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:04,210
山姆！

782
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,370
開門，傑克。

783
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,580
如果你敢。

784
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:52,430
你做了什麼？！

785
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,970
你做了什麼？！

786
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,080
簡，比利，山姆！

787
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,520
山姆！

788
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:04,800
請簡，比利！

789
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,850
對不起，我無法保證你的安全。

790
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,830
但我遵守我的承諾。

791
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:17,520
? I'll keep you safe tonight ?

792
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:26,610
? Promise I won't leave your sight ?

793
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:32,810
? Should you get lost ?

794
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:36,880
? Follow my voice ?

795
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:44,360
? You and I, we will be one ?

796
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:51,560
? We'll build a stronghold ?

797
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,600
? Where we'll be safe ?

798
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,400
比利。
?我們將在哪裡安全?

799
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:58,780
? There'll be no wrong ?

800
01:26:58,920 --> 01:26:59,920
簡。

801
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:03,320
山姆。

802
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:10,960
? If you just stay by my side ?

803
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,260
插口！

804
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:59,000
沒有回憶。

805
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,720
這一切都從這裡開始。

806
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:09,600
我們的故事從此開始。

807
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,610
當我們越過這條線時，

808
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:17,770
過去會留下來。

809
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,460
“他打了幾個鐘門。

810
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,900
但他沒有辦法逃脫。

811
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,520
傑克砌起了門。

812
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:15,600
比利關閉了煙囪。

813
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:19,490
我們等了好幾天。

814
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:22,440
直到噪音消失“。

815
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,680
插口？

816
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,760
湯姆？

817
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,510
你聽到了嗎？

818
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:35,590
外面有人。

819
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:43,690
傑克離開後，我得到了指揮。

820
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:45,500
你不能。

821
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:46,790
噓。

822
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,460
安靜。

823
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:52,150
沒事。

824
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,970
山姆，別害怕。

825
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,000
我的手，握住我的手。

826
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,870
我們需要為傑克呆在一起。

827
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,130
沒有。

828
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,380
沒有。

829
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:04,470
沒有人。

830
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:07,320
沒有人。

831
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:08,710
沒有人。

832
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:11,070
永遠。

833
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,760
我們是一個。

834
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:16,190
我們是一個。

835
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,100
我們是一個。

836
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:21,490
我還有我的子彈，我可以上去！

837
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,550
我可以完成這個。

838
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,090
比利，我們不能。

839
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:29,220
他正試圖讓我們留在這裡。他不會讓我搬家。

840
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,470
別打了。

841
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:32,680
噓。

842
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:35,000
插口。

843
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:39,380
傑克在睡覺，他的頭很疼。

844
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:51,440
傑克試圖自殺。

845
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,120
這就是我們回來的原因。

846
01:31:57,730 --> 01:31:59,140
拜託，艾莉。

847
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:03,790
我們需要你照顧傑克。

848
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,700
簡？

849
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:31,420
原諒我。

850
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:33,720
什麼？

851
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,360
您。

852
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:39,140
你不能在這裡。

853
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:41,170
他們會離開，如果你留下。

854
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,430
請留下我們一個人。

855
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:44,840
傑克，你在流血。

856
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:46,480
-Jane。 -讓我看看。

857
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:48,040
山姆。

858
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:50,820
比利。

859
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:52,170
噢！

860
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,490
讓我看看，傑克。停下來。

861
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,250
我知道所有的東西。

862
01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:00,310
插口。

863
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,460
- 傑克，看看我。 -他們在哪？

864
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,120
薩姆。 -插口。

865
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:05,720
薩姆！ -插口。

866
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,590
-Jane！簡！ -插口。

867
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:09,510
傑克，看著我。停下來！

868
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:10,540
-Jane。 -停止。

869
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:11,860
薩姆。下車。 -停下來。停止

870
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,840
-沒有！ -停下來！

871
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:15,510
-插口。 -請。他們會離開，如果你留下。

872
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:21,420
我無法保證他們的安全。

873
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,390
沒有。

874
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,040
只是讓我們一個人！

875
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:28,000
請，請留下我們一個人。

876
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,550
留下我們一個人。

877
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:37,540
走！

878
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:41,810
-走！ -沒有。

879
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,400
走！

880
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:08,380
湯姆？

881
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:07,390
湯姆？

882
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:29,120
湯姆！

883
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:34,160
湯姆，讓我看看。好的？只是...

884
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:38,930
插口！

885
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:47,360
湯姆，誰給你做的？

886
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,840
傑克，幫幫我！

887
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:27,770
插口！

888
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:32,360
插口。

889
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,720
你為什麼藏起來？

890
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:19,050
你以為你會嚇到我嗎？

891
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:23,270
那麼，不要想一會兒就會那麼簡單。

892
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,830
出來！

893
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:27,490
我並不孤單。

894
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:33,230
你可以在這些牆內聽到他們的聲音

895
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:35,490
你知道嗎？我也可以聽到他們。

896
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:39,180
你以為你可以像蠟燭一樣熄滅他們的光，

897
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:40,230
但你不能。

898
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:41,430
艾莉。

899
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,550
你沒有這種力量。

900
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:57,220
你是一個死了的人。

901
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:01,390
簡。

902
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:06,920
山姆，比利，我知道你能聽到我的聲音！

903
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:08,740
我知道你在那裡。

904
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,300
比利，從那裡出來。

905
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,450
比利！

906
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:17,190
傑克，讓我這樣做。

907
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:27,590
沒有！

908
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:41,370
遠離她！

909
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,880
你不屬於這裡。

910
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:54,090
這是我們的地方。

911
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:30,990
你告訴我的是一個非常好的消息。

912
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:35,430
傑克沒有多重人格的12周。

913
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:40,140
簡，比利和薩姆終於在傑克的腦子裡睡了。

914
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:42,710
但是這樣的創傷

915
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:45,270
他的想法可能會有不可預測的後果，

916
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:47,060
所以我們必須保持警惕。

917
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:51,620
我知道我們之前討論過這個問題。

918
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:54,050
但你是一個健康的年輕女人

919
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,490
在你前方有一個光明的未來。

920
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:01,130
我不明白你為什麼選擇住在房子裡

921
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:04,650
那將永遠記住那個可怕的事件。

922
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,840
這將是悲傷的。

923
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:08,030
插口？

924
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:09,690
這將是孤獨的。

925
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:13,330
他是一位精神病患者，永遠無法妥善照顧你。

926
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,480
插口？

927
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,230
沒有理由為什麼你應該

928
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:19,060
為你的餘生帶上這種負擔。

929
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:27,580
愛不能在病態的心靈中成長。

930
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:31,430
你永遠不會有真正的家庭

931
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:33,870
如果你選擇和傑克一起生活。

932
01:41:36,410 --> 01:41:40,140
謝謝你的關心，醫生。

933
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:45,940
請確定他服用了他的藥物。

934
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:53,260
這是我們讓Jane，Billy和Sam遠離他的唯一途徑。

935
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:20,150
你到家了。

936
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:21,630
來吧，起床。

937
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:31,050
我們從來沒有慶祝你的生日。

938
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:46,030
這不是很棒嗎？

939
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:50,570
畢竟這一次，它並沒有破壞。

940
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:08,910
我會在裡面等他們回來。

941
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,780
We have come very far, enduring many hardships.

942
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,300
But at last, we found a place where we can be safe.

943
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,120
Together.

944
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,650
At the other end of the ocean.

945
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,700
It's not how I remember it.

946
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,300
Mum had put all her hopes

947
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,680
on the house where she had grown up.

948
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
It had been waiting for us,

949
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,550
frozen in time for over thirty years.

950
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,540
Is someone there?

951
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,300
Just a coat stand in the mirror, Sam.

952
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,320
Don't be afraid.

953
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,760
It's not a step to take lightly.

954
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,460
We're no longer Fairbairns.

955
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,050
From now on, our last name will be "Marrowbone".

956
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,600
Just like this house,

957
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,650
which will be our new home.

958
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,180
Once you cross that line, there'll be no memories.

959
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,980
Our story begins here.

960
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,350
Will he ever find us, Mummy?

961
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,810
Who?

962
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,990
You see, I've crossed the line.

963
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,870
I must've forgotten already.

964
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,890
No one will bother us again.

965
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,750
Ever.

966
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,570
We wanted to believe that we would be safe.

967
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,240
That we too had a chance of happiness.

968
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,510
That Mum's illness had disappeared with the rest of our problems.

969
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,920
The darkness we'd left behind seem to vanish

970
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,160
in the light of those summer days.

971
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,380
Nobody knew us.

972
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,470
We could be free for the first time.

973
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,310
And we were about to make a new friend

974
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,740
that would change our lives forever.

975
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,450
Oh, look at that, Sam!

976
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,500
This must be the place they call "The Red Witch Rock".

977
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,840
It's a skull.

978
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,280
Let's go back, Billy. I don't like it.

979
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,520
Who goes there?

980
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,220
How dare you invade my dwellings.

981
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,130
I'm Sam Marrowbone.

982
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,790
These are my two brothers, Billy and Jack.

983
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,910
And this is my sister Jane.

984
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,790
You have entered the Red Witch lands.

985
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,380
See that passage to your right?

986
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,480
You must cross it.

987
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,520
If you mean well, you'd be free to go.

988
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,230
But if you hide evil within your heart,

989
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,540
the walls would close in and trap you forever.

990
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,530
Do you dare cross it?

991
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,470
Jack, no.

992
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,000
-Come on! -Come on, Sammy!

993
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,570
Be brave.

994
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,740
The walls are closing in, we shouldn't be here.

995
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,850
Your soul must have been good.

996
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,220
It's very slippy here.

997
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,350
Hello, little one.

998
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,540
Come closer.

999
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,750
My name is Allie.

1000
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,240
Are you a prisoner of the Red Witch?

1001
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,590
Yes.

1002
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,710
She punished me for breaking into her garden.

1003
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,930
Leaving me trapped until someone

1004
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,050
dared cross the passageway and rescue me.

1005
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,040
Now, is that someone you?

1006
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,190
Take these acorns in return.

1007
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,280
They aren't much now, but

1008
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,190
they'll grow big and strong with our friendship.

1009
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,820
They're magic.

1010
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,430
So now that you're free,

1011
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,290
where would you like to go?

1012
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,150
At the end of that unforgettable day,

1013
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,340
Allie was already one of us.

1014
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,450
Stop. Wait, okay, move forward.

1015
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
Why?

1016
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,460
It's too beautiful. Can I...?

1017
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,760
Get close together, come on.

1018
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,040
You guys ready?

1019
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,380
One, two...

1020
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,040
Great.

1021
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,930
Perfect.

1022
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,850
We began again.

1023
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,210
We forgot the past.

1024
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,420
And we started a new life.

1025
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,810
For a while, we all bought in to that illusion.

1026
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,410
But the journey to America had taken what little strength

1027
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,070
Mum had left in her.

1028
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,070
Little did we know,

1029
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,700
that would be our last summer together.

1030
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,090
Bury me in the garden.

1031
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,000
I showed you where.

1032
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,590
You just have to turn 21.

1033
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,340
Stay hidden until then

1034
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,500
and no law will take them from you.

1035
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,130
Swear to me.

1036
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,490
You'll stay together.

1037
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,150
Always stay together.

1038
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,270
I swear.

1039
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,320
Have a safe place ready.

1040
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,270
In case he finds you.

1041
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,170
In the cupboard.

1042
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,140
On the left.

1043
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,490
You lied.

1044
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,460
You lied in court.

1045
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,190
You kept his money all this time.

1046
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,300
"My dearest Jack,

1047
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,800
"I'm so sorry I won't be there for you as you grow up.

1048
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,670
"I no longer have the strength.

1049
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,290
"Jane will be Sam's mother, as it was meant to be.

1050
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,160
"Tell Billy to not let his anger

1051
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,230
"take his beautiful heart.

1052
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,120
"And you, my Jack, when the time comes,

1053
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,770
"do not forget to open your heart to love.

1054
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,300
"You must keep them safe.

1055
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,800
"Always.

1056
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,270
Your loving mother, Rose Marrowbone".

1057
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,700
Nothing,

1058
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,920
no one,

1059
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,330
ever...

1060
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,560
will separate us.

1061
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,230
We are one.

1062
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,820
Repeat after me.

1063
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,050
Nothing.

1064
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,070
Nothing.

1065
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,100
No one.

1066
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,020
-No one. -No one.

1067
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,770
Ever.

1068
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,810
-Ever. -Ever.

1069
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,720
Ever.

1070
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,040
We are one.

1071
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,420
-We are one. -We are one.

1072
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,170
We sealed our promise.

1073
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,050
And we started hiding from the world...

1074
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,730
until I turned 21.

1075
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,690
Jack!

1076
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
Jack! Jack!

1077
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,990
Six months later

1078
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,070
I'm tired of being locked up in this house.

1079
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,560
It won't be long before your birthday, Jack.

1080
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,090
We should start thinking about your party.

1081
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,220
That lawyer Porter was hanging on the fence last week again.

1082
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,230
We'll be done with him soon enough.

1083
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,650
Come Christmas time it will all be different.

1084
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,010
You'll see, Billy.

1085
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,420
Billy! Billy!

1086
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,140
What Sam?

1087
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,590
I heard a noise behind the mirror

1088
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,100
and the cover is falling off.

1089
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,330
If you don't do something,

1090
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,060
ghost might be able to see us again.

1091
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,430
Stop being such a baby.

1092
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,490
You don't need to be scared.

1093
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,630
Sam, the ghost has been gone for months.

1094
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,280
Here, give me this.

1095
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,330
Scoundrel?

1096
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,640
Come on, Scoundrel, come get your breakfast.

1097
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,600
So that's what's making the noises behind the walls.

1098
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,160
It's that big rat.

1099
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,010
Sam, stop feeding it.

1100
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,260
It's making holes all over the house.

1101
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,870
Do you want me to let her starve?

1102
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,200
You don't know where that thing has been.

1103
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,590
All right? You could get rabies.

1104
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,670
She won't bite me, she's my friend.

1105
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,570
Terrible thing, rabies.

1106
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,020
You'll get foam coming out your mouth

1107
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,520
until your insides are all rotten.

1108
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,100
I'll have to spend my last bullet on you.

1109
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,560
Then I'll hide behind the mirror and scream and cry all night

1110
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,210
and you'll never sleep again.

1111
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,330
Yeah, but the dead don't cry or scream.

1112
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,950
Tell me that next time you hear the ghost in the middle of the night.

1113
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,010
Oh, fuck.

1114
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Ah!

1115
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,640
Jack!

1116
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,090
No extra money, no nonsense.

1117
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,810
We'll see.

1118
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,320
Hello.

1119
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,720
We'll follow you on the map, Jack, so you don't feel alone.

1120
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,350
He's just left the Marrowbone home.

1121
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,490
He's going through the forest.

1122
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,580
That was a bird.

1123
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,760
And then he goes down the tunnel.

1124
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,620
Through the tunnel.

1125
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,400
And then, he goes out of the tunnel...

1126
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,930
and goes on the bridge...

1127
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,760
and then...

1128
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,890
Oh, he should see Allie's farm by now.

1129
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,190
-Say, "Hi, Allie"! -Hi, Allie.

1130
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,170
-Hi, we miss you! -We miss you.

1131
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,560
And he goes through the bumpy mud.

1132
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,320
And he goes through the path.

1133
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,960
He goes all the way up.

1134
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,720
-And now he's getting near town. -Oh.

1135
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,410
He's almost there.

1136
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,970
And then he goes into that shop.

1137
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,950
Careful, Jack.

1138
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,540
Be brave, Jack.

1139
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,660
Catch me if you can!

1140
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,700
Two weeks ago today...

1141
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,340
Oh, Jack.

1142
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,950
I was beginning to think you wouldn't show up this week.

1143
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,110
Hm, they smell delicious.

1144
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,980
You bring a list?

1145
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,560
Thousands saluted the American flag

1146
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,380
stiff with wires so that it would wave.

1147
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
Then inspected the conditions of the lunar module...

1148
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,650
How's your mother feeling? Any better?

1149
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,290
Not really.

1150
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,250
It's this change in weather.

1151
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,810
I'm sorry to hear that.

1152
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,760
I'm sure she'll get well soon, though.

1153
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,530
Give her my love, will you?

1154
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,360
What's with all of these books?

1155
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,690
They came in on Friday.

1156
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,120
From a library weeding in a place I used to work in Portland.

1157
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,460
I say we let their weeds become our flowers.

1158
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,310
I've missed you.

1159
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,670
I'm sorry I didn't make it last week.

1160
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,850
It's okay.

1161
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,840
Oh, I have the book that you asked for.

1162
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,310
Thank you.

1163
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,070
You're welcome.

1164
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,080
Uh, how's Sam coming along? Does he need another one?

1165
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,700
How can he read so fast?

1166
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,550
It's almost at least 300 pages long.

1167
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,070
I miss the little guy.

1168
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,810
And Jane, and Billy.

1169
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,130
It's so easy for me to just pop by, I could...

1170
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,820
Perhaps my mother's better.

1171
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,910
Hello there.

1172
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,150
Mr. Porter.

1173
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,020
So?

1174
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,470
What do you think?

1175
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,160
Very smart.

1176
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,960
Do you remember that position I told you about in New York?

1177
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,870
Parker & Jameson.

1178
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,220
Does this mean...?

1179
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,450
Well, it means that they fell under my charm and I got the job.

1180
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,330
It is wonderful, Tom. I'm just so happy for you.

1181
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,550
Anyway, I happen to stroll past the strand and...

1182
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,480
I couldn't help thinking of...

1183
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,320
you.

1184
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,900
What is that?

1185
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,080
It's a donation, if you will, for the library.

1186
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,570
This is a first edition, I can't possibly accept this.

1187
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,460
I just wish you could've seen the place.

1188
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,700
You would love it. Maybe I should take you sometime.

1189
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,530
You ever been to New York City?

1190
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,510
Jack Fairbairn.

1191
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,440
It's Marrowbone now.

1192
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,420
We go by my mother's last name.

1193
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,730
Right, well, uh...

1194
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,590
speaking of which, the other heirs have already signed off.

1195
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,440
And I need to collect the transfer charges on the estate.

1196
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,950
I'll come around the house tomorrow.

1197
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,530
Tell your mother have a bank check ready for 200 dollars.

1198
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,530
She's quite unwell.

1199
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,490
Perhaps it would be best if I took the papers and

1200
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,090
I have my mother sign them and bring them back to you.

1201
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,300
I need to certify the signatures.

1202
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,350
I'll be there tomorrow. Noon.

1203
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,260
Bye, Jack.

1204
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,060
I'll see you soon.

1205
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,470
Fucking lawyers.

1206
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,900
Oh, God, I knew that creepy bastard would bring us trouble.

1207
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,040
How much money do we have in Mother's savings?

1208
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,900
Shit.

1209
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,560
Not even 50 dollars.

1210
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,560
Even if I sold a thousand cakes, we wouldn't have the money.

1211
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,230
What are we going to do, Jack?

1212
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,130
I don't know, but if the truth comes out, they will separate us.

1213
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,850
Jack.

1214
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,270
Jack.

1215
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,790
The box.

1216
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,940
What does it matter? We don't have it anymore.

1217
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,930
-I could get it back. -No!

1218
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,640
What else are we gonna do?

1219
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,150
Jack, you promised me we would never touch that money again.

1220
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,370
Please?

1221
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,140
I promised you a lot of things.

1222
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,000
I can get it back, Jack.

1223
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,690
We're rich!

1224
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,070
Yes, Sam!

1225
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,670
Yes, we're rich!

1226
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,310
Oh, come on!

1227
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,160
Oh, Jane, come on, what's the matter?

1228
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,820
It's blood money. We all know where it comes from.

1229
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,130
We shouldn't even touch it.

1230
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,370
'Tis cursed.

1231
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,870
Jack.

1232
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,780
We don't have a choice.

1233
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,490
Porter is coming tomorrow. We have to be ready.

1234
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,030
This isn't going to work.

1235
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,260
It will.

1236
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,560
It needs to look just like Mum's.

1237
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,070
-Please! -No.

1238
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,590
It's Mum's room. I should be allowed in there, too.

1239
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,940
There are mirrors in here, you can't go in.

1240
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,830
Please.

1241
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,000
What are we going to do about the fortress?

1242
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,610
We won't come inside.

1243
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,080
What are you doing?

1244
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,910
Painkillers Mum never took.

1245
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,110
Billy, that could hill him.

1246
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,020
Just in case of emergency.

1247
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,150
He's here.

1248
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,630
Everyone is clear on the plan?

1249
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,240
I forgot to open the gate. So sorry.

1250
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,990
Mm.

1251
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,890
What's this?

1252
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,750
Mother's savings.

1253
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,630
We haven't had time to make arrangements to change it.

1254
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,860
These are pounds.

1255
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,400
Yeah, 200 pounds.

1256
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,010
So?

1257
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,850
Pounds are worth twice as much as dollars.

1258
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,130
That should cover all the costs

1259
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,870
and...any fees.

1260
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,360
I said a bank check.

1261
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,980
Let me get you something to drink.

1262
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,500
I'd like to beg one last favor.

1263
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,680
If it's not too much to ask.

1264
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,380
Our mother, she can't get out of bed.

1265
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,920
And she feels humiliated, the idea of you seeing her this way.

1266
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,620
Would you mind if I bring the papers upstairs

1267
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,460
and bring them down signed for you?

1268
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,450
Have her sign both copies.

1269
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,220
Would you forget the damn lemonade? I don't have all day.

1270
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,850
You just need to sign both copies.

1271
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,960
Both?

1272
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,050
Jack, can't possibly get the signature right two times!

1273
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,900
He'll notice they're not the same.

1274
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,290
You have to do it.

1275
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,960
-Jane, please, now. -One second!

1276
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,070
There's no time.

1277
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,440
Sign the second one. Sign.

1278
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,420
Jane, he's outside.

1279
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,000
-Jane, he's outside. -Shut up, Jack.

1280
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,520
Jane, there's no time.

1281
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,280
Please.

1282
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,910
Mum, stay in bed.

1283
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,280
No, Mum, the doctor said you can't get up.

1284
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,030
Sign.

1285
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,910
Almost done.

1286
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,090
You can't come out.

1287
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,600
He's coming, Jane.

1288
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,620
Mum.

1289
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,610
Mum, stay in bed.

1290
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,110
Now!

1291
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,650
Mum, I'll go to see Porter.

1292
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,250
I'll be back in a minute.

1293
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,950
I'm sorry, I was just...

1294
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,950
Is she all right?

1295
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,120
She just has no strength.

1296
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,420
I had no idea it had gotten so bad.

1297
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,310
So, this solves it.

1298
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,080
Marrowbone house now officially belongs to your mother.

1299
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,960
I'm glad we could...

1300
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,520
wrap this thing up before someone discovered...

1301
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,620
You know, um...

1302
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,200
that business about your father.

1303
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,510
We're most grateful.

1304
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,120
Especially for your discretion.

1305
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,520
Well, I better get out of here before the rain catches me.

1306
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,310
Good luck, Mr. Marrowbone.

1307
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,650
And then he says, "I didn't come here for a picnic, Mr. Marrowbone,

1308
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,980
I came here for a bank check".

1309
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
So, I wasted to give him the other lemonade.

1310
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,720
Stop delaying the inevitable.

1311
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,710
It's time to meet your demise, my dear brother.

1312
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,660
Today, Alaska march...

1313
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,000
of the Northern Western territories

1314
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,550
can't be defeated.

1315
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,250
Remember, brave little soldier,

1316
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,520
the northwestern territories have never been conquered.

1317
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,130
Oh, until today.

1318
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,190
Six!

1319
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,910
Yes!

1320
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,630
No!

1321
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,990
Oh-oh!

1322
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,210
-You are done. -Jack!

1323
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,700
What is it, Sam?

1324
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,240
Six!

1325
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,590
Go find the dice.

1326
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,740
That doesn't count, the die went off the table.

1327
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,960
The hell it don't!

1328
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,150
-Sorry! -Shut up, Sam.

1329
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,350
You killed my Mongolians that way!

1330
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,470
That-That's true.

1331
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,650
Fine.

1332
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,560
-Fine. -Sorry, Billy!

1333
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,900
No, no, fine, fine.

1334
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,150
Since the floor counts as board.

1335
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,200
Ah, Billy!

1336
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,800
You're such a sore loser!

1337
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,740
You said the floor counts as board.

1338
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,910
Sam, w-what's the score? What's he got?

1339
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,730
Check it, Sam.

1340
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,950
One.

1341
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,510
Oh, tough go!

1342
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,600
-Ooh, sorry, Billy. -Tough go.

1343
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,050
What's the other one?

1344
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,240
I think you're nervous, Billy.

1345
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,830
You're a nervous one.

1346
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,060
One.

1347
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,900
Six!

1348
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,560
Six!

1349
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,550
He better not be attacking Brazil next.

1350
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,040
Jack?

1351
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,780
Jack, the ghost is back!

1352
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,560
To the fortress.

1353
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,920
Cover the man before he gets out.

1354
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,710
?如果我們長大了會不會很好？ ?

1355
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,020
? Then we wouldn't ?
Stay here.

1356
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,550
?不得不等待這麼久?

1357
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,220
?和?住在一起不是很好

1358
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,600
?如果我們可以喚醒?不是很好嗎？

1359
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,990
He'll never leave us.

1360
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,430
Not even death.

1361
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,850
You blacked out.

1362
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,960
I had to come out to bring you back again.

1363
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,860
I hate living with a ghost.

1364
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,840
It's that money.

1365
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,920
His ghost is back because we used it.

1366
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,850
As soon as the sun rises, you'll give it back.

1367
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,940
Let him take it to hell.

1368
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,380
Hey!

1369
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,090
Oh, hello.

1370
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,220
Hey, can I give you a lift home?

1371
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,070
Thank you, Mr. Porter,

1372
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,140
but honestly, the bus is no bother.

1373
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,760
Mr. Porter? What happened to Tom?

1374
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,490
I insist.

1375
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,270
I meant to ask you something, Allie.

1376
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,110
Hey, so these Marrowbone kids...

1377
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,960
How well do you know them?

1378
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,940
We're good friends, I guess.

1379
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,030
Huh.

1380
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,530
It's just that they worry me.

1381
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,840
You know, the fact that they live so isolated.

1382
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,130
Always hiding away from the community.

1383
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,420
They're not hiding.

1384
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,970
Allie, come on.

1385
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,720
The poor kid, Sam doesn't even go to school.

1386
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,240
They live too far away.

1387
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,660
And Sam is home schooled.

1388
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,430
Jane helps with his homework and I check his notebooks.

1389
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,240
Huh.

1390
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,750
Well, I guess that's something.

1391
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,690
It's just so unfortunate that

1392
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,280
he's forced to live that way because of his father.

1393
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,210
I mean, I guess Jack has told you all about him.

1394
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,190
I know he was a cruel man.

1395
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,570
Cruel man?

1396
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,780
That's putting it mildly.

1397
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,390
I've tried to help them.

1398
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,100
And at least, I've been able to secure them the house

1399
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,990
before I leave, but still...

1400
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,820
If the truth ever got out,

1401
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,920
I don't know what kind of future there would be for them.

1402
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,810
And you know how people are around here.

1403
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,160
Sam?

1404
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Sam!

1405
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,380
Sam, where are you?

1406
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,500
Still scared?

1407
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,020
You'll have to come out of the fortress eventually.

1408
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,090
I miss Mummy.

1409
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,440
I miss her too.

1410
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,550
Where is she now?

1411
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,640
She's in a good place.

1412
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,560
Well, I want to go with her.

1413
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,080
I don't like hiding here and being alone all the time.

1414
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,720
We're not alone.

1415
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,660
We have Allie.

1416
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,720
I'll show you something.

1417
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,130
You see? Follow my point.

1418
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,910
See Allie's farm?

1419
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,560
Yeah.

1420
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,950
What we looking for?

1421
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,480
Just wait.

1422
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,840
Is that really her?

1423
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,630
What's she saying?

1424
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,660
She says hello.

1425
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,630
-Do you want to talk to her? -What do I say?

1426
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,780
How about your name?

1427
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,550
So she knows it's you talking today.

1428
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,920
Dot, dot.

1429
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,430
Dot, dash.

1430
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,530
Hi, Sam.

1431
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,410
She's asking how are you.

1432
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,080
I'm very happy. How do I say that?

1433
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,580
Dot, dot.

1434
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,520
Dot, dash...

1435
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,000
I need to get out of this house.

1436
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,820
We all do.

1437
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,670
Jack.

1438
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,890
You never really told me much about your father.

1439
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,970
He was a monster.

1440
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,480
The things he did, they're unspeakable.

1441
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,170
He was the reason we ran here.

1442
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,250
We had to get away from him.

1443
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,970
Is he still in England?

1444
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,850
He's dead now.

1445
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,250
He can't hurt us anymore.

1446
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,540
Jane?

1447
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,390
Sam?

1448
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,260
I'm home!

1449
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,650
Where have you been?

1450
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
Out.

1451
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:12,940
Out?

1452
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,740
Oh, but nobody leaves the house

1453
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,300
unless it's absolutely necessary, Jack.

1454
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,340
Your rule, not mine.

1455
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,480
I can smell her perfume, you know.

1456
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,080
Every single time.

1457
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,430
That's strange.

1458
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,710
You know what I mean.

1459
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,410
Can't expect him to be here all the time.

1460
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,080
They love each other.

1461
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,660
She doesn't know the first thing about him, Jane.

1462
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,410
Does she ever ask about us?

1463
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,410
Of course she does, all the time.

1464
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,400
Yeah? What do you tell her?

1465
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,760
Yeah, I thought so.

1466
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,810
You talk too much. You'll get us in trouble.

1467
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,570
Uh-oh, someone's jealous.

1468
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,390
Shut up, Sam. Why would I be jealous?

1469
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,570
'Cause Jack has a girlfriend and you don't.

1470
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,150
I don't care.

1471
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,890
Have you kissed her yet?

1472
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,600
It's none of your business.

1473
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,670
What if she comes to live with us someday?

1474
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,070
Home would be a better place with her in it.

1475
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,680
You can't be serious, Jane.

1476
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,410
Why can't I live with the girl that I love?

1477
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,510
What about our promise?

1478
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,750
Does that mean nothing to you anymore?

1479
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,210
The things that I do to keep you all safe.

1480
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,710
Safe?

1481
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,890
Oh, tell me, what about this feels safe?

1482
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,580
We're trapped in here while you go around doing whatever you please.

1483
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,210
But that's just fine, Jack.

1484
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,320
-Be quiet. -Fine.

1485
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,550
-Maybe she should come -Be quiet.

1486
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,600
and live her then, huh?

1487
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,870
Why? Why be quiet?

1488
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,260
-Shut up. -Tell her about Mum.

1489
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,610
-Billy! -Tell her the truth about Dad.

1490
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,850
-Why can't you handle it? -Get out!

1491
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,650
'Cause you know it's the truth.

1492
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,040
-Why don't you tell her the truth? -Get out!

1493
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,130
-Billy! -Jane, don't touch me!

1494
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,520
Don't shut the door on me!

1495
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:37,860
-Get out! -Why?

1496
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,210
-Get out! Get out! -Why, because you want me to leave?

1497
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,560
-You want me to leave? -Leave me--

1498
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,110
You need me more than I need you!

1499
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,030
Leave!

1500
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,120
Are you feeling better?

1501
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,670
Shhh.

1502
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,360
My head has exploded.

1503
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,630
Take it easy on him.

1504
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,840
He's like a caged bird, Jack.

1505
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,300
You have Sam.

1506
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,960
You have Allie.

1507
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,090
He has no one.

1508
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,230
Mummy.

1509
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:16,710
?今晚我會保持安全?

1510
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:25,100
?諾言我不會離開你的視線?

1511
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,690
?如果你迷路?

1512
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:35,790
?按照我的聲音?

1513
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:41,410
?你和我，我們將是?

1514
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,570
?會帶我們出去?

1515
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:03,660
?沒有人會把我們分開?

1516
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,270
The ghost.

1517
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:08,760
?你會在這裡找到我?

1518
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,960
?你和我會?

1519
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,030
Jack!

1520
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,640
The mirror!

1521
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:55,650
What?

1522
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,940
Sam has been to Mother's room.

1523
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,420
He said he saw something in there.

1524
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,810
In the wardrobe mirror.

1525
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,030
He thinks he saw the ghost, Jack.

1526
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:18,670
Well, that was just a lie we told Sam

1527
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,370
so he wouldn't know the truth.

1528
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,720
And the truth is we walled up a man

1529
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,500
and let him die and rot over our heads.

1530
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,440
Our own father.

1531
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,960
He was a murderer, Jane.

1532
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,210
He came here to kill us.

1533
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,920
And what are we then?

1534
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,320
I can still remember those screams.

1535
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,520
Those first weeks.

1536
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,720
It seemed like he would never die.

1537
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:52,220
Is it so crazy to think his ghost is still up there?

1538
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,100
He can't hurt us now. He's dead and gone.

1539
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,150
He's not gone.

1540
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:02,270
We need to give him a proper burial.

1541
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,710
We are never going back to that place.

1542
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,750
Understood?

1543
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,840
Never.

1544
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:14,020
We can't live in a tomb.

1545
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,110
Oh, Allie!

1546
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,790
Hello.

1547
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,440
-Packing already? -Yes.

1548
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:46,450
Uh, actually, can I see you for a moment?

1549
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,600
-Of course. -Great.

1550
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,510
Thank you.

1551
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,840
Gosh, I'm sorry about the mess.

1552
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,760
That's quite all right.

1553
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:06,440
So?

1554
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,750
There's something I...

1555
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,340
Here.

1556
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,870
What is this?

1557
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,460
Open it.

1558
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,150
Tom, I...

1559
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,160
Would you be my guest?

1560
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,600
There's so many places I would love to show you.

1561
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,940
Tom, I...

1562
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,220
I really wish you wouldn't.

1563
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,250
我沖得太厲害了，不是嗎？

1564
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,250
No, it's...

1565
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,460
It's not that, it's just um...

1566
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:51,840
I'm too old?

1567
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,300
You know my father is 15 years older than my mother?

1568
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,990
And they've been happily married

1569
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,930
-for 40 years. -Tom, please. Stop.

1570
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,800
I just never thought about you that way.

1571
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,650
I'm sorry.

1572
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,800
It's uh, about Jack, isn't it?

1573
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,720
I really don't think that's any of your concern.

1574
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,480
You don't know the first thing about him.

1575
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,040
You have no idea...

1576
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,220
what you are getting into.

1577
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,030
I am only trying to protect you.

1578
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,570
You know, I can get you out of this place where you don't belong.

1579
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,890
You should think about that.

1580
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,030
Scoundrel?

1581
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,910
Where have you been?

1582
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:54,610
Better not bite me, or I'll turn you into lunch.

1583
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,570
Come on out of there.

1584
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,670
Do not be afraid.

1585
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,960
Thomas D. Porter.

1586
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,940
Mr. Porter, This is Sam Gouldman.

1587
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,460
Mr. Gouldman!

1588
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,360
What a pleasure to hear from you. Actually, I was just finishing...

1589
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:35,770
Well, we just came out of a board meeting

1590
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,880
and after some heartfelt deliberations,

1591
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,200
important decisions have been made

1592
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,950
about the future of our firm.

1593
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:42,770
I'm all ears.

1594
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,680
The time has come for us to grow.

1595
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,580
So, instead of the position we spoke about,

1596
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,180
we have decided to offer you to become a partner in our firm.

1597
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,140
How's that sound?

1598
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,110
Well, I'm honored, sir.

1599
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:57,550
But just to make sure I understand...

1600
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,750
We're offering you the great opportunity

1601
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,360
of buying ten percent of our shares.

1602
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,460
Are you there?

1603
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,700
And how much are we talking about roughly?

1604
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,820
Well, it's a little neighborhood south of $5,000.

1605
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,560
I assume this won't be a problem.

1606
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,240
Right, Mr. Porter?

1607
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:19,640
Right.

1608
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,680
But the position is still secured, if I just want to...

1609
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,710
I believe I've made my point clear.

1610
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:30,890
What we need right now is a partner, not an employee.

1611
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,280
Porter?

1612
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,900
Porter?

1613
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,050
Well, I'll have to think about it, then.

1614
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,000
Well, don't sit on it too long.

1615
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,110
If you're not interested, we have to move on to our next candidate.

1616
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,080
I'm sure you understand it.

1617
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,150
I'll call you Monday.

1618
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,040
Thank you, Mr. Gouldman. Thank you.

1619
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,620
No! No! No!

1620
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,190
No. No.

1621
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:05,070
Billy?

1622
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,670
Jane?

1623
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:49,620
How's your mother feeling today?

1624
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,460
It seems we have a problem, Jack.

1625
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:57,840
I can't be an accomplice to a forgery.

1626
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,170
Please.

1627
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:02,710
I'm just trying to look after my family.

1628
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,560
You lied to me.

1629
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,610
You tried to cheat me and in doing so,

1630
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,700
you made me an accessory in your little charade.

1631
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:11,060
So, I think it's fair you offer me some kind of compensation.

1632
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,270
We have nothing!

1633
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,480
You have 10,000 pounds and you will hand them over to me

1634
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:18,950
so I can get out of this cowshit and wear real shoes again.

1635
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,740
Now I assume you will discuss this with your siblings.

1636
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,160
I'll come by tomorrow.

1637
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,110
What are we going to do?

1638
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:53,180
We threw that money down the chimney.

1639
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,540
We have no way of getting it back now.

1640
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,980
It's all over.

1641
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,860
Ah!

1642
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:57,020
Billy, give me-give me...

1643
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,380
Give me that!

1644
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,250
-Yeah, hold this. -Okay, okay.

1645
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,310
Ah!

1646
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,630
-Billy. -What? What?

1647
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:05,010
What have you done?

1648
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,780
You...

1649
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,700
You didn't dare to tear down the wall.

1650
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:13,670
So...so it found another way to the attic.

1651
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,630
Someone had to try and get that money back.

1652
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:17,840
I told you not to go in there!

1653
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,450
He survived, Jack.

1654
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:23,560
Ah! He survived, Jack.

1655
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:25,950
He's been eating up there.

1656
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,810
I saw it with my own two eyes.

1657
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,440
It will kill us all. I saw it.

1658
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,950
The place is covered in-- in animal bones!

1659
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,470
Doves, raccoons, rats.

1660
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,260
You cou--You couldn't imagine the stench in there.

1661
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,400
And he's found a way to store rain water.

1662
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,500
It's the rain.

1663
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,170
-He's alive...again. -He's alive this whole time.

1664
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,960
Get out, get out.

1665
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,290
-He's got to go. -Please stop it.

1666
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,080
No! Stop it?

1667
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,460
Stop it? Is anybody listening to me? He's still alive!

1668
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:56,080
And waiting to do some more damage!

1669
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:57,270
I'm done with that son of a bitch!

1670
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,370
You know I will.

1671
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,180
I will go up there and I will end this, I swear to God!

1672
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,780
Are you listening to me? Are you listening?

1673
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,180
Jack!

1674
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:07,810
Jack!

1675
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:15,560
Jack.

1676
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,810
Shh, calm, Jack.

1677
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,250
Shh. Jack!

1678
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,700
Jack!

1679
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,040
We have to tell Allie.

1680
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,950
She's the only one who can help him.

1681
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,100
No, she'll be scared, she...

1682
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:42,070
She won't want to see him again.

1683
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:44,370
She loves him, Billy.

1684
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,750
The only thing that matters now is saving Jack.

1685
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:51,000
We have to tell Allie the truth.

1686
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,850
Hello?

1687
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,180
Anybody home?

1688
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:33,790
I've come for my money!

1689
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:35,570
Hello!

1690
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:54,680
"The day we locked father up was a day like any other.

1691
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:58,390
Nothing could have warned us that he finally found us".

1692
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:10,880
Jack!

1693
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,210
Sam!

1694
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,610
Take Sam.

1695
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,110
Come on, this way!

1696
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:23,290
-Let me go with you. -No, you stay with Jane and Sam.

1697
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,690
No! Jack!

1698
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,190
-Jack! -Jack?

1699
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,660
Should be safe here.

1700
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,150
Hey, Jack!

1701
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,410
-Jack! -I will deal with him.

1702
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:34,420
Jack! No, Jack!

1703
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,990
I've got it!

1704
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,150
I'm right here!

1705
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,940
This is between you and me!

1706
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,600
Stay away from the house and I will give it back!

1707
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,770
It was me and me alone.

1708
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,380
I ratted you out.

1709
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:43,920
I took your money.

1710
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,470
They had nothing to do with it.

1711
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,690
Take it

1712
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,490
and leave us alone.

1713
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,520
Jack?

1714
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,260
Kill him, Billy.

1715
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:28,550
I'm coming!

1716
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:30,410
I'm coming!

1717
01:23:35,130 --> 01:23:36,190
Sam!

1718
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:38,260
Sam, I'm coming!

1719
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,490
Jane.

1720
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:50,690
Jane, Billy, Sam!

1721
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:04,210
Sam!

1722
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,370
Open the door, Jack.

1723
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,580
If you dare.

1724
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:52,430
What have you done?!

1725
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,970
What have you done?!

1726
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:00,080
Jane, Billy, Sam!

1727
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,520
Sam!

1728
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:04,800
Please, Jane, Billy!

1729
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,850
I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe.

1730
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,830
But I'm keeping my promise.

1731
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:17,520
?今晚我會保持安全?

1732
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:26,610
?諾言我不會離開你的視線?

1733
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:32,810
?如果你迷路?

1734
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:36,880
?按照我的聲音?

1735
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:44,360
?你和我，我們將是一個?

1736
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:51,560
?我們會建立一個據點?

1737
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,600
?我們將在哪裡安全?

1738
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,400
? Where we'll be safe ?
Billy.

1739
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:58,780
?沒有錯的?

1740
01:26:58,920 --> 01:26:59,920
Jane.

1741
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:03,320
Sam.

1742
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:10,960
?如果你只是在我身邊?

1743
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,260
Jack!

1744
01:27:56,910 --> 01:27:59,000
There will be no memories.

1745
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,720
It all starts here.

1746
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:09,600
Our story begins here.

1747
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,610
When we cross that line,

1748
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:17,770
the past will stay behind.

1749
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,460
"He banged on the door for hours.

1750
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,900
But there was no way for him to escape.

1751
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,520
Jack bricked up the door.

1752
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:15,600
Billy closed up the chimney.

1753
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:19,490
And we waited for days.

1754
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:22,440
Until the noises died out".

1755
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,680
Jack?

1756
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,760
Tom?

1757
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,510
Did you hear that?

1758
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:35,590
There's someone outside.

1759
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:43,690
I am in command, when Jack is gone.

1760
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:45,500
You can't.

1761
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:46,790
Shh.

1762
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,460
Be quiet.

1763
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:52,150
It's fine.

1764
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,970
Sam, don't be scared.

1765
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,000
My hand, hold my hand.

1766
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,870
We need to stay together for Jack.

1767
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,130
Nothing.

1768
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,380
Nothing.

1769
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:04,470
No one.

1770
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:07,320
No one.

1771
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:08,710
No one.

1772
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:11,070
Ever.

1773
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,760
We are one.

1774
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:16,190
We are one.

1775
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,100
We are one.

1776
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:21,490
I've still got my bullet, I can go up there!

1777
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,550
I-I can finish this.

1778
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,090
Billy, we can't.

1779
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:29,220
He's trying to keep us here. He won't let me move.

1780
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,470
Stop fighting.

1781
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:32,680
Shh.

1782
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:35,000
Jack.

1783
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:39,380
Jack's sleeping, his head hurts.

1784
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:51,440
Jack tried to kill himself.

1785
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,120
That's why we came back.

1786
01:31:57,730 --> 01:31:59,140
Please, Allie.

1787
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:03,790
We need you to take care of Jack.

1788
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,700
Jane?

1789
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:31,420
Forgive me.

1790
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:33,720
What?

1791
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:37,360
You.

1792
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:39,140
You can't be here.

1793
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:41,170
They'll go if you stay.

1794
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,430
Please leave us alone.

1795
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:44,840
Jack, you're bleeding.

1796
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:46,480
-Jane. -Let me see.

1797
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:48,040
Sam.

1798
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:50,820
Billy.

1799
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:52,170
Ow!

1800
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,490
Let me look, Jack. Stop it.

1801
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:59,250
I know everything.

1802
01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:00,310
Jack.

1803
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,460
-Jack, look at me. -Where are they?

1804
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,120
-Sam. -Jack.

1805
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:05,720
-Sam! -Jack.

1806
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,590
-Jane! Jane! -Jack.

1807
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:09,510
Jack, look at me. Stop it!

1808
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:10,540
-Jane. -Stop.

1809
01:33:10,650 --> 01:33:11,860
-Sam. Get off. -Stop it. Stop

1810
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,840
-No! -Stop it!

1811
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:15,510
-Jack. -Please. They'll go if you stay.

1812
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:21,420
I couldn't keep them safe.

1813
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,390
No.

1814
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,040
Just leave us alone!

1815
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:28,000
Please, please leave us alone.

1816
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,550
Leave us alone.

1817
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:37,540
Go!

1818
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:41,810
-Go! -No.

1819
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,400
Go!

1820
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:08,380
Tom?

1821
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:07,390
Tom?

1822
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:29,120
Tom!

1823
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:34,160
Tom, let me see. Okay? Just...

1824
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:38,930
Jack!

1825
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:47,360
Tom, who did this to you?

1826
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,840
Jack, help me!

1827
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:27,770
Jack!

1828
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:32,360
Jack.

1829
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:11,720
Why are you hiding?

1830
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:19,050
You think you can scare me?

1831
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:23,270
Well, don't think for a second it's gonna be that easy.

1832
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,830
Come out of there!

1833
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:27,490
I'm not alone.

1834
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:33,230
You can hear them within these walls

1835
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:35,490
and you know what? I can hear them too.

1836
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:39,180
You thought you could put out their light like a candle,

1837
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:40,230
but you can't.

1838
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:41,430
Allie.

1839
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:44,550
You don't have that power.

1840
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:57,220
You're the one who's dead.

1841
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:01,390
Jane.

1842
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:06,920
Sam, Billy, I know you can hear me!

1843
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:08,740
I know you're there.

1844
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,300
Billy, come out of there.

1845
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,450
Billy!

1846
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:17,190
Jack, let me do this.

1847
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:27,590
No!

1848
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:41,370
Get away from her!

1849
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,880
You don't belong here.

1850
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:54,090
This is our place.

1851
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:30,990
What you're telling me is very good news.

1852
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:35,430
Twelve weeks where Jack has had no episodes of multiple personality.

1853
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:40,140
Jane, Billy and Sam had finally gone to sleep in Jack's mind.

1854
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:42,710
But such a trauma

1855
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:45,270
may have unpredictable consequences on his mind,

1856
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:47,060
so we have to be vigilant.

1857
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:51,620
I know we have discussed this before.

1858
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:54,050
But you are a healthy young woman

1859
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,490
with a bright future ahead of you.

1860
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:01,130
I don't understand why you choose to live in a house

1861
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:04,650
that will always bear the memory of that terrible event.

1862
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:06,840
It will be sad.

1863
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:08,030
Jack?

1864
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:09,690
It will be lonely.

1865
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:13,330
He is a mentally ill man who can never take proper care of you.

1866
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,480
Jack?

1867
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,230
There's no reason why you should

1868
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:19,060
carry that burden for the rest of your life.

1869
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:27,580
Love cannot grow in a sick mind.

1870
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:31,430
And you will never have a real family

1871
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:33,870
if you choose to live with Jack.

1872
01:41:36,410 --> 01:41:40,140
Thank you for your concern, doctor.

1873
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:45,940
Please make sure he takes his medication.

1874
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:53,260
It's the only way we can keep Jane, Billy and Sam away from him.

1875
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:20,150
You're home.

1876
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:21,630
Come on, get up.

1877
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:31,050
We never got to celebrate your birthday.

1878
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:46,030
Isn't that amazing?

1879
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:50,570
After all this time, it didn't spoil.

1880
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:08,910
I'll wait inside till they come back.
