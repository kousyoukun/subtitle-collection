1
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:47,786
<i>We have come very far, enduring many hardships.</i>

2
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,304
<i>But at last, we found a place where we can be safe.</i>

3
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:55,123
<i>Together.</i>

4
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,659
<i>At the other end of the ocean.</i>

5
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,706
It's not how I remember it.

6
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:19,305
<i>Mum had put all her hopes</i>

7
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:21,688
<i>on the house where she had grown up.</i>

8
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:24,086
<i>It had been waiting for us,</i>

9
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:27,551
<i>frozen in time for over thirty years.</i>

10
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:42,548
Is someone there?

11
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,300
Just a coat stand in the mirror, Sam.

12
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:50,324
Don't be afraid.

13
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,760
It's not a step to take lightly.

14
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:07,467
We're no longer Fairbairns.

15
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:12,055
From now on, our last name will be "Marrowbone".

16
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,608
Just like this house,

17
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,654
which will be our new home.

18
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:23,184
Once you cross that line, there'll be no memories.

19
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:26,987
Our story begins here.

20
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,354
Will he ever find us, Mummy?

21
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:31,816
Who?

22
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:35,996
You see, I've crossed the line.

23
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:37,875
I must've forgotten already.

24
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:40,891
No one will bother us again.

25
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,753
Ever.

26
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:15,578
<i>We wanted to believe that we would be safe.</i>

27
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:19,248
<i>That we too had a chance of happiness.</i>

28
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:24,517
<i>That Mum's illness had disappeared with the rest of our problems.</i>

29
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,926
<i>The darkness we'd left behind seem to vanish</i>

30
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,164
<i>in the light of those summer days.</i>

31
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,389
<i>Nobody knew us.</i>

32
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:35,473
<i>We could be free for the first time.</i>

33
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,316
<i>And we were about to make a new friend</i>

34
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:42,747
<i>that would change our lives forever.</i>

35
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,458
Oh, look at that, Sam!

36
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:47,500
This must be the place they call "The Red Witch Rock".

37
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:48,844
It's a skull.

38
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:51,288
Let's go back, Billy. I don't like it.

39
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,523
<i>Who goes there?</i>

40
00:04:53,664 --> 00:04:56,226
<i>How dare you invade my dwellings.</i>

41
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,130
I'm Sam Marrowbone.

42
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,794
These are my two brothers, Billy and Jack.

43
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:03,919
And this is my sister Jane.

44
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,791
<i>You have entered the Red Witch lands.</i>

45
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:09,388
<i>See that passage to your right?</i>

46
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:11,485
<i>You must cross it.</i>

47
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,524
<i>If you mean well, you'd be free to go.</i>

48
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:17,232
<i>But if you hide evil within your heart,</i>

49
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,544
<i>the walls would close in and trap you forever.</i>

50
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:22,534
<i>Do you dare cross it?</i>

51
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,474
Jack, no.

52
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,000
-Come on! -Come on, Sammy!

53
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,576
Be brave.

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,748
The walls are closing in, we shouldn't be here.

55
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:33,851
Your soul must have been good.

56
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:36,229
It's very slippy here.

57
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,351
Hello, little one.

58
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:43,542
Come closer.

59
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,754
My name is Allie.

60
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,241
Are you a prisoner of the Red Witch?

61
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:51,592
Yes.

62
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,718
She punished me for breaking into her garden.

63
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,930
Leaving me trapped until someone

64
00:05:57,025 --> 00:06:00,053
dared cross the passageway and rescue me.

65
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:02,045
Now, is that someone you?

66
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,192
Take these acorns in return.

67
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:09,289
They aren't much now, but

68
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:12,195
they'll grow big and strong with our friendship.

69
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,824
They're magic.

70
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,439
So now that you're free,

71
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,293
where would you like to go?

72
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:52,150
<i>At the end of that unforgettable day,</i>

73
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,345
<i>Allie was already one of us.</i>

74
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,454
Stop. Wait, okay, move forward.

75
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,780
Why?

76
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:59,460
It's too beautiful. Can I...?

77
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,767
Get close together, come on.

78
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,041
You guys ready?

79
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:06,385
One, two...

80
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,041
Great.

81
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:10,930
Perfect.

82
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,852
<i>We began again.</i>

83
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:16,210
<i>We forgot the past.</i>

84
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:20,429
<i>And we started a new life.</i>

85
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:24,816
<i>For a while, we all bought in to that illusion.</i>

86
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,414
<i>But the journey to America had taken what little strength</i>

87
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:31,079
<i>Mum had left in her.</i>

88
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:33,070
<i>Little did we know,</i>

89
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,703
<i>that would be our last summer together.</i>

90
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:46,090
Bury me in the garden.

91
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,003
I showed you where.

92
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:53,591
You just have to turn 21.

93
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:57,343
Stay hidden until then

94
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:01,500
and no law will take them from you.

95
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,134
Swear to me.

96
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,494
You'll stay together.

97
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:14,154
Always stay together.

98
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,277
I swear.

99
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:23,322
Have a safe place ready.

100
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:27,275
In case he finds you.

101
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,173
In the cupboard.

102
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:35,142
On the left.

103
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:01,490
You lied.

104
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,467
You lied in court.

105
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,193
You kept his money all this time.

106
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,306
"My dearest Jack,

107
00:09:16,532 --> 00:09:19,804
"I'm so sorry I won't be there for you as you grow up.

108
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:22,676
"I no longer have the strength.

109
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,298
"Jane will be Sam's mother, as it was meant to be.

110
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:31,164
"Tell Billy to not let his anger

111
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,235
"take his beautiful heart.

112
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:37,124
"And you, my Jack, when the time comes,

113
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,773
"do not forget to open your heart to love.

114
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:43,304
"You must keep them safe.

115
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:45,808
"Always.

116
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:51,273
Your loving mother, Rose Marrowbone".

117
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,708
Nothing,

118
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:04,925
no one,

119
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:06,333
ever...

120
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,564
will separate us.

121
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:12,239
We are one.

122
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,826
Repeat after me.

123
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:21,058
Nothing.

124
00:10:23,736 --> 00:10:25,072
Nothing.

125
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:27,109
No one.

126
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:30,029
-No one. -No one.

127
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:31,777
Ever.

128
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:34,818
-Ever. -Ever.

129
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:37,725
Ever.

130
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,044
We are one.

131
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,427
-We are one. -We are one.

132
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:49,175
<i>We sealed our promise.</i>

133
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,050
<i>And we started hiding from the world...</i>

134
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:54,730
<i>until I turned 21.</i>

135
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:36,692
Jack!

136
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:42,482
Jack! Jack!

137
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,993
Six months later

138
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:31,076
I'm tired of being locked up in this house.

139
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,561
It won't be long before your birthday, Jack.

140
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:37,092
We should start thinking about your party.

141
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:43,220
That lawyer Porter was hanging on the fence last week again.

142
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:45,236
We'll be done with him soon enough.

143
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:47,657
Come Christmas time it will all be different.

144
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,017
You'll see, Billy.

145
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,421
Billy! Billy!

146
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:52,148
What Sam?

147
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:53,594
I heard a noise behind the mirror

148
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,102
and the cover is falling off.

149
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:56,331
If you don't do something,

150
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,064
ghost might be able to see us again.

151
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,433
Stop being such a baby.

152
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,491
You don't need to be scared.

153
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:04,632
Sam, the ghost has been gone for months.

154
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,286
Here, give me this.

155
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:11,338
Scoundrel?

156
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,641
Come on, Scoundrel, come get your breakfast.

157
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:20,608
So that's what's making the noises behind the walls.

158
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:22,165
It's that big rat.

159
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:25,018
Sam, stop feeding it.

160
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:27,260
It's making holes all over the house.

161
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,877
Do you want me to let her starve?

162
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,205
You don't know where that thing has been.

163
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:31,596
All right? You could get rabies.

164
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:33,674
She won't bite me, she's my friend.

165
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:35,572
Terrible thing, rabies.

166
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:37,025
You'll get foam coming out your mouth

167
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,526
until your insides are all rotten.

168
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:40,103
I'll have to spend my last bullet on you.

169
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,569
Then I'll hide behind the mirror and scream and cry all night

170
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:44,215
and you'll never sleep again.

171
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:46,339
Yeah, but the dead don't cry or scream.

172
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:49,950
Tell me that next time you hear the ghost in the middle of the night.

173
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:48,017
Oh, fuck.

174
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:49,885
Ah!

175
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,647
Jack!

176
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:05,099
No extra money, no nonsense.

177
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:06,814
We'll see.

178
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:10,323
Hello.

179
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:13,723
We'll follow you on the map, Jack, so you don't feel alone.

180
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,358
He's just left the Marrowbone home.

181
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:28,491
He's going through the forest.

182
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,585
<i>That was a bird.</i>

183
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:37,766
And then he goes down the tunnel.

184
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:39,622
<i>Through the tunnel.</i>

185
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,403
And then, he goes out of the tunnel...

186
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,939
<i>and goes on the bridge...</i>

187
00:15:51,223 --> 00:15:52,767
and then...

188
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:56,890
<i>Oh, he should see Allie's farm by now.</i>

189
00:15:56,988 --> 00:15:59,196
-Say, "Hi, Allie"! -Hi, Allie.

190
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:03,171
-Hi, we miss you! -We miss you.

191
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:09,569
<i>And he goes through the bumpy mud.</i>

192
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:12,320
<i>And he goes through the path.</i>

193
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:14,962
He goes all the way up.

194
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:20,722
-And now he's getting near town. -Oh.

195
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,417
<i>He's almost there.</i>

196
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,972
And then he goes into that shop.

197
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:34,954
<i>Careful, Jack.</i>

198
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,545
<i>Be brave, Jack.</i>

199
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,668
Catch me if you can!

200
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,707
<i>Two weeks ago today...</i>

201
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:47,345
Oh, Jack.

202
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,954
I was beginning to think you wouldn't show up this week.

203
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,118
Hm, they smell delicious.

204
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:54,983
You bring a list?

205
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,566
<i>Thousands saluted the American flag</i>

206
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,381
<i>stiff with wires so that it would wave.</i>

207
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,640
<i>Then inspected the conditions of the lunar module...</i>

208
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:07,653
How's your mother feeling? Any better?

209
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,292
Not really.

210
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,253
It's this change in weather.

211
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,811
I'm sorry to hear that.

212
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,766
I'm sure she'll get well soon, though.

213
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,536
Give her my love, will you?

214
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:23,363
What's with all of these books?

215
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:25,691
They came in on Friday.

216
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:30,123
From a library weeding in a place I used to work in Portland.

217
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:34,468
I say we let their weeds become our flowers.

218
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:57,313
I've missed you.

219
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:00,671
I'm sorry I didn't make it last week.

220
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:02,858
It's okay.

221
00:19:03,593 --> 00:19:05,846
Oh, I have the book that you asked for.

222
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:12,316
Thank you.

223
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,071
You're welcome.

224
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:17,083
Uh, how's Sam coming along? Does he need another one?

225
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:21,707
How can he read so fast?

226
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:24,552
It's almost at least 300 pages long.

227
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:28,072
I miss the little guy.

228
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:30,817
And Jane, and Billy.

229
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,136
It's so easy for me to just pop by, I could...

230
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,827
Perhaps my mother's better.

231
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:40,919
Hello there.

232
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:43,155
Mr. Porter.

233
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,029
So?

234
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,474
What do you think?

235
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:52,169
Very smart.

236
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,963
Do you remember that position I told you about in New York?

237
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,877
Parker & Jameson.

238
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:02,229
Does this mean...?

239
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,454
Well, it means that they fell under my charm and I got the job.

240
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:09,338
It is wonderful, Tom. I'm just so happy for you.

241
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:14,551
Anyway, I happen to stroll past the strand and...

242
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:18,487
I couldn't help thinking of...

243
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:20,323
you.

244
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:21,909
What is that?

245
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:25,081
It's a donation, if you will, for the library.

246
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:35,573
This is a first edition, I can't possibly accept this.

247
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:37,468
I just wish you could've seen the place.

248
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:40,703
You would love it. Maybe I should take you sometime.

249
00:20:40,827 --> 00:20:42,538
You ever been to New York City?

250
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,514
Jack Fairbairn.

251
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:10,443
It's Marrowbone now.

252
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,426
We go by my mother's last name.

253
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,736
Right, well, uh...

254
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,595
speaking of which, the other heirs have already signed off.

255
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:21,446
And I need to collect the transfer charges on the estate.

256
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,958
I'll come around the house tomorrow.

257
00:21:24,004 --> 00:21:26,536
Tell your mother have a bank check ready for 200 dollars.

258
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,536
She's quite unwell.

259
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,499
Perhaps it would be best if I took the papers and

260
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,093
I have my mother sign them and bring them back to you.

261
00:21:35,423 --> 00:21:37,301
I need to certify the signatures.

262
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:41,359
I'll be there tomorrow. Noon.

263
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:55,264
Bye, Jack.

264
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:57,060
I'll see you soon.

265
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:12,471
Fucking lawyers.

266
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:15,908
Oh, God, I knew that creepy bastard would bring us trouble.

267
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:18,041
How much money do we have in Mother's savings?

268
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:18,901
Shit.

269
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:20,565
Not even 50 dollars.

270
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:23,564
Even if I sold a thousand cakes, we wouldn't have the money.

271
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:25,236
What are we going to do, Jack?

272
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:28,135
I don't know, but if the truth comes out, they will separate us.

273
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,852
Jack.

274
00:22:31,187 --> 00:22:32,273
Jack.

275
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:34,798
The box.

276
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:36,943
What does it matter? We don't have it anymore.

277
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,934
-I could get it back. -No!

278
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,642
What else are we gonna do?

279
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:44,158
Jack, you promised me we would never touch that money again.

280
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:46,378
Please?

281
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:51,142
I promised you a lot of things.

282
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:55,001
I can get it back, Jack.

283
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:24,692
We're rich!

284
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:28,075
Yes, Sam!

285
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,677
Yes, we're rich!

286
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,317
Oh, come on!

287
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:35,169
Oh, Jane, come on, what's the matter?

288
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,820
It's blood money. We all know where it comes from.

289
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,130
We shouldn't even touch it.

290
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:43,376
'Tis cursed.

291
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:45,871
Jack.

292
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,786
We don't have a choice.

293
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,499
Porter is coming tomorrow. We have to be ready.

294
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:12,034
This isn't going to work.

295
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:14,266
It will.

296
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:20,564
It needs to look just like Mum's.

297
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:23,074
-Please! -No.

298
00:25:25,353 --> 00:25:28,596
It's Mum's room. I should be allowed in there, too.

299
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:30,940
There are mirrors in here, you can't go in.

300
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:32,839
Please.

301
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:15,009
What are we going to do about the fortress?

302
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:17,618
We won't come inside.

303
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,080
What are you doing?

304
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:38,915
Painkillers Mum never took.

305
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:42,114
Billy, that could hill him.

306
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:44,024
Just in case of emergency.

307
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:49,150
He's here.

308
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:55,636
Everyone is clear on the plan?

309
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:04,243
I forgot to open the gate. So sorry.

310
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:16,992
Mm.

311
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:20,897
What's this?

312
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:22,758
Mother's savings.

313
00:27:23,148 --> 00:27:25,633
We haven't had time to make arrangements to change it.

314
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:27,861
These are pounds.

315
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:30,400
Yeah, 200 pounds.

316
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:32,014
So?

317
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,850
Pounds are worth twice as much as dollars.

318
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:36,131
That should cover all the costs

319
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:38,878
and...any fees.

320
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,362
I said a bank check.

321
00:27:49,222 --> 00:27:50,986
Let me get you something to drink.

322
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:05,502
I'd like to beg one last favor.

323
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:07,682
If it's not too much to ask.

324
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:12,384
Our mother, she can't get out of bed.

325
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:15,922
And she feels humiliated, the idea of you seeing her this way.

326
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:17,628
Would you mind if I bring the papers upstairs

327
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:19,464
and bring them down signed for you?

328
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:27,453
Have her sign both copies.

329
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:30,226
Would you forget the damn lemonade? I don't have all day.

330
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:43,857
You just need to sign both copies.

331
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:44,966
Both?

332
00:28:45,051 --> 00:28:48,058
Jack, can't possibly get the signature right two times!

333
00:29:39,052 --> 00:29:40,904
He'll notice they're not the same.

334
00:29:56,993 --> 00:29:58,298
You have to do it.

335
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:44,961
-Jane, please, now. -One second!

336
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,071
There's no time.

337
00:30:46,157 --> 00:30:48,446
Sign the second one. Sign.

338
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:56,429
Jane, he's outside.

339
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:59,007
-Jane, he's outside. -Shut up, Jack.

340
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:00,529
Jane, there's no time.

341
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:01,284
Please.

342
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:02,917
Mum, stay in bed.

343
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:06,284
No, Mum, the doctor said you can't get up.

344
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:08,037
Sign.

345
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:09,914
Almost done.

346
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:13,095
You can't come out.

347
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:18,609
He's coming, Jane.

348
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:19,625
Mum.

349
00:31:19,756 --> 00:31:21,617
Mum, stay in bed.

350
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:27,117
Now!

351
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:32,650
Mum, I'll go to see Porter.

352
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:34,250
I'll be back in a minute.

353
00:31:38,412 --> 00:31:39,951
I'm sorry, I was just...

354
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:42,951
Is she all right?

355
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:51,124
She just has no strength.

356
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:53,427
I had no idea it had gotten so bad.

357
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:58,312
So, this solves it.

358
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,085
Marrowbone house now officially belongs to your mother.

359
00:32:05,546 --> 00:32:07,966
I'm glad we could...

360
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:12,527
wrap this thing up before someone discovered...

361
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:15,625
You know, um...

362
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:20,202
that business about your father.

363
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,513
We're most grateful.

364
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:29,124
Especially for your discretion.

365
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:36,524
Well, I better get out of here before the rain catches me.

366
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:40,319
Good luck, Mr. Marrowbone.

367
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,655
And then he says, "I didn't come here for a picnic, Mr. Marrowbone,

368
00:32:46,803 --> 00:32:48,983
I came here for a bank check".

369
00:32:50,122 --> 00:32:52,122
So, I wasted to give him the other lemonade.

370
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:53,726
Stop delaying the inevitable.

371
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:56,718
It's time to meet your demise, my dear brother.

372
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,666
Today, Alaska march...

373
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,008
of the Northern Western territories

374
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,556
can't be defeated.

375
00:33:07,813 --> 00:33:09,255
Remember, brave little soldier,

376
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,529
the northwestern territories have never been conquered.

377
00:33:12,685 --> 00:33:14,130
Oh, until today.

378
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:19,193
Six!

379
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:19,912
Yes!

380
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:20,638
No!

381
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,990
Oh-oh!

382
00:33:22,422 --> 00:33:24,217
-You are done. -Jack!

383
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:31,709
What is it, Sam?

384
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,240
Six!

385
00:33:37,772 --> 00:33:39,593
Go find the dice.

386
00:33:43,831 --> 00:33:45,745
That doesn't count, the die went off the table.

387
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,964
The hell it don't!

388
00:33:47,022 --> 00:33:48,159
-Sorry! -Shut up, Sam.

389
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:50,354
You killed my Mongolians that way!

390
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:51,479
That-That's true.

391
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:52,651
Fine.

392
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:54,565
-Fine. -Sorry, Billy!

393
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:55,901
No, no, fine, fine.

394
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:58,151
Since the floor counts as board.

395
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:00,209
Ah, Billy!

396
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:01,803
You're such a sore loser!

397
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:03,740
You said the floor counts as board.

398
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,912
Sam, w-what's the score? What's he got?

399
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:07,732
Check it, Sam.

400
00:34:25,956 --> 00:34:26,957
One.

401
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:28,510
Oh, tough go!

402
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:30,605
-Ooh, sorry, Billy. -Tough go.

403
00:34:30,707 --> 00:34:32,059
What's the other one?

404
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,246
I think you're nervous, Billy.

405
00:34:35,316 --> 00:34:36,839
You're a nervous one.

406
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,062
One.

407
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:20,903
Six!

408
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:35,567
Six!

409
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,551
He better not be attacking Brazil next.

410
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,042
Jack?

411
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:04,780
Jack, the ghost is back!

412
00:36:05,398 --> 00:36:06,567
To the fortress.

413
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,928
Cover the man before he gets out.

414
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:29,718
♪ Wouldn't it be nice if we were older? ♪

415
00:36:29,781 --> 00:36:31,022
Stay here.
♪ Then we wouldn't ♪

416
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:33,557
♪ have to wait so long ♪

417
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:36,221
♪ And wouldn't it be nice to live together ♪

418
00:36:53,263 --> 00:36:56,607
♪ Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up ♪

419
00:37:05,502 --> 00:37:06,995
He'll never leave us.

420
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:10,433
Not even death.

421
00:38:18,572 --> 00:38:19,856
You blacked out.

422
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,968
I had to come out to bring you back again.

423
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:25,869
I hate living with a ghost.

424
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:31,848
It's that money.

425
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:35,926
His ghost is back because we used it.

426
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,855
As soon as the sun rises, you'll give it back.

427
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:44,942
Let him take it to hell.

428
00:39:58,364 --> 00:39:59,380
Hey!

429
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:03,092
Oh, hello.

430
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,222
Hey, can I give you a lift home?

431
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,070
Thank you, Mr. Porter,

432
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:09,148
but honestly, the bus is no bother.

433
00:40:09,593 --> 00:40:12,768
Mr. Porter? What happened to Tom?

434
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:18,496
I insist.

435
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:25,275
I meant to ask you something, Allie.

436
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:28,117
Hey, so these Marrowbone kids...

437
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,965
How well do you know them?

438
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:34,946
We're good friends, I guess.

439
00:40:36,232 --> 00:40:37,037
Huh.

440
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,538
It's just that they worry me.

441
00:40:40,812 --> 00:40:42,842
You know, the fact that they live so isolated.

442
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:45,132
Always hiding away from the community.

443
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:47,423
They're not hiding.

444
00:40:47,563 --> 00:40:48,976
Allie, come on.

445
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:51,726
The poor kid, Sam doesn't even go to school.

446
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:54,241
They live too far away.

447
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:56,667
And Sam is home schooled.

448
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:59,437
Jane helps with his homework and I check his notebooks.

449
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:01,242
Huh.

450
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:03,756
Well, I guess that's something.

451
00:41:04,718 --> 00:41:06,695
It's just so unfortunate that

452
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:09,289
he's forced to live that way because of his father.

453
00:41:16,363 --> 00:41:20,211
I mean, I guess Jack has told you all about him.

454
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:24,197
I know he was a cruel man.

455
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:26,574
Cruel man?

456
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:30,787
That's putting it mildly.

457
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:36,392
I've tried to help them.

458
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,102
And at least, I've been able to secure them the house

459
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:41,994
before I leave, but still...

460
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:44,821
If the truth ever got out,

461
00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:47,923
I don't know what kind of future there would be for them.

462
00:41:50,513 --> 00:41:53,810
And you know how people are around here.

463
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:14,162
Sam?

464
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:16,503
Sam!

465
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:20,386
Sam, where are you?

466
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:27,503
Still scared?

467
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:30,029
You'll have to come out of the fortress eventually.

468
00:42:33,315 --> 00:42:35,096
I miss Mummy.

469
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:38,444
I miss her too.

470
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:40,557
Where is she now?

471
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,643
She's in a good place.

472
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,565
Well, I want to go with her.

473
00:42:49,411 --> 00:42:53,080
I don't like hiding here and being alone all the time.

474
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,728
We're not alone.

475
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,662
We have Allie.

476
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,729
I'll show you something.

477
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:08,132
You see? Follow my point.

478
00:43:09,345 --> 00:43:10,910
See Allie's farm?

479
00:43:11,558 --> 00:43:12,560
Yeah.

480
00:43:23,372 --> 00:43:24,958
What we looking for?

481
00:43:25,194 --> 00:43:26,488
Just wait.

482
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:34,848
Is that really her?

483
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:38,636
What's she saying?

484
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:41,668
She says hello.

485
00:43:42,035 --> 00:43:44,637
-Do you want to talk to her? -What do I say?

486
00:43:46,028 --> 00:43:47,785
How about your name?

487
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,551
So she knows it's you talking today.

488
00:43:50,674 --> 00:43:51,927
Dot, dot.

489
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:55,432
Dot, dash.

490
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:12,537
Hi, Sam.

491
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:21,418
She's asking how are you.

492
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,089
I'm very happy. How do I say that?

493
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,586
Dot, dot.

494
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:30,526
Dot, dash...

495
00:44:40,022 --> 00:44:42,003
I need to get out of this house.

496
00:44:42,405 --> 00:44:43,824
We all do.

497
00:44:50,465 --> 00:44:51,673
Jack.

498
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,897
You never really told me much about your father.

499
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:05,970
He was a monster.

500
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:11,488
The things he did, they're unspeakable.

501
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,171
He was the reason we ran here.

502
00:45:23,403 --> 00:45:25,250
We had to get away from him.

503
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:27,977
Is he still in England?

504
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:31,859
He's dead now.

505
00:45:33,517 --> 00:45:35,255
He can't hurt us anymore.

506
00:46:42,456 --> 00:46:43,541
Jane?

507
00:46:48,312 --> 00:46:49,397
Sam?

508
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:54,262
I'm home!

509
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:06,650
Where have you been?

510
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:10,963
Out.

511
00:47:11,864 --> 00:47:12,949
Out?

512
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,744
Oh, but nobody leaves the house

513
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:17,300
unless it's absolutely necessary, Jack.

514
00:47:18,008 --> 00:47:20,345
Your rule, not mine.

515
00:47:20,678 --> 00:47:22,486
I can smell her perfume, you know.

516
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:24,080
Every single time.

517
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,431
That's strange.

518
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:26,714
You know what I mean.

519
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:29,410
Can't expect him to be here all the time.

520
00:47:29,901 --> 00:47:31,088
They love each other.

521
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:34,664
She doesn't know the first thing about him, Jane.

522
00:47:34,783 --> 00:47:36,411
Does she ever ask about us?

523
00:47:36,484 --> 00:47:38,416
Of course she does, all the time.

524
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:40,401
Yeah? What do you tell her?

525
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:43,761
Yeah, I thought so.

526
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,817
You talk too much. You'll get us in trouble.

527
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:48,575
Uh-oh, someone's jealous.

528
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,392
Shut up, Sam. Why would I be jealous?

529
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,572
'Cause Jack has a girlfriend and you don't.

530
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:55,158
I don't care.

531
00:47:55,616 --> 00:47:56,897
Have you kissed her yet?

532
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:58,608
It's none of your business.

533
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:00,678
What if she comes to live with us someday?

534
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,070
Home would be a better place with her in it.

535
00:48:03,202 --> 00:48:04,687
You can't be serious, Jane.

536
00:48:04,805 --> 00:48:07,417
Why can't I live with the girl that I love?

537
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,515
What about our promise?

538
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,755
Does that mean nothing to you anymore?

539
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,211
The things that I do to keep you all safe.

540
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:15,717
Safe?

541
00:48:15,883 --> 00:48:17,890
Oh, tell me, what about this feels safe?

542
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,586
We're trapped in here while you go around doing whatever you please.

543
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,219
But that's just fine, Jack.

544
00:48:22,257 --> 00:48:23,322
-Be quiet. -Fine.

545
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:24,557
-Maybe she should come -Be quiet.

546
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:25,609
and live her then, huh?

547
00:48:25,671 --> 00:48:26,877
Why? Why be quiet?

548
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,260
-Shut up. -Tell her about Mum.

549
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:29,611
-Billy! -Tell her the truth about Dad.

550
00:48:29,682 --> 00:48:30,853
-Why can't you handle it? -Get out!

551
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:31,659
'Cause you know it's the truth.

552
00:48:31,736 --> 00:48:33,041
-Why don't you tell her the truth? -Get out!

553
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:35,135
-Billy! -Jane, don't touch me!

554
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:36,529
Don't shut the door on me!

555
00:48:36,695 --> 00:48:37,864
-Get out! -Why?

556
00:48:37,975 --> 00:48:40,210
-Get out! Get out! -Why, because you want me to leave?

557
00:48:40,288 --> 00:48:41,561
-You want me to leave? -Leave me--

558
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,116
You need me more than I need you!

559
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:44,038
Leave!

560
00:49:29,202 --> 00:49:31,121
Are you feeling better?

561
00:49:32,106 --> 00:49:33,676
Shhh.

562
00:49:36,548 --> 00:49:38,363
My head has exploded.

563
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:44,638
Take it easy on him.

564
00:49:45,546 --> 00:49:47,841
He's like a caged bird, Jack.

565
00:49:49,522 --> 00:49:51,304
You have Sam.

566
00:49:52,303 --> 00:49:53,968
You have Allie.

567
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,093
He has no one.

568
00:51:40,957 --> 00:51:42,232

Jack!

580
00:53:58,314 --> 00:53:59,648
The mirror!

581
00:54:54,517 --> 00:54:55,650
What?

582
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:58,947
Sam has been to Mother's room.

583
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:09,420
He said he saw something in there.

584
00:55:09,917 --> 00:55:11,811
In the wardrobe mirror.

585
00:55:13,031 --> 00:55:15,038
He thinks he saw the ghost, Jack.

586
00:55:17,112 --> 00:55:18,678
Well, that was just a lie we told Sam

587
00:55:18,703 --> 00:55:20,374
so he wouldn't know the truth.

588
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,729
And the truth is we walled up a man

589
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:26,505
and let him die and rot over our heads.

590
00:55:29,016 --> 00:55:30,448
Our own father.

591
00:55:31,877 --> 00:55:33,963
He was a murderer, Jane.

592
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:36,213
He came here to kill us.

593
00:55:36,418 --> 00:55:37,920
And what are we then?

594
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:42,324
I can still remember those screams.

595
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:44,523
Those first weeks.

596
00:55:46,595 --> 00:55:48,723
It seemed like he would never die.

597
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:52,222
Is it so crazy to think his ghost is still up there?

598
00:55:52,685 --> 00:55:56,106
He can't hurt us now. He's dead and gone.

599
00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:58,157
He's not gone.

600
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:02,274
We need to give him a proper burial.

601
00:56:04,282 --> 00:56:06,715
We are never going back to that place.

602
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:08,757
Understood?

603
00:56:09,843 --> 00:56:10,845
Never.

604
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:14,025
We can't live in a tomb.

605
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,113
Oh, Allie!

606
00:56:39,726 --> 00:56:40,797
Hello.

607
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:43,441
-Packing already? -Yes.

608
00:56:43,555 --> 00:56:46,451
Uh, actually, can I see you for a moment?

609
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:48,607
-Of course. -Great.

610
00:56:50,425 --> 00:56:51,511
Thank you.

611
00:56:54,063 --> 00:56:56,840
Gosh, I'm sorry about the mess.

612
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,765
That's quite all right.

613
00:57:05,273 --> 00:57:06,442
So?

614
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:12,757
There's something I...

615
00:57:18,344 --> 00:57:19,345
Here.

616
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:21,873
What is this?

617
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,466
Open it.

618
00:57:23,772 --> 00:57:25,150
Tom, I...

619
00:57:34,657 --> 00:57:36,160
Would you be my guest?

620
00:57:36,421 --> 00:57:38,606
There's so many places I would love to show you.

621
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:39,949
Tom, I...

622
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:43,223
I really wish you wouldn't.

623
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:46,255
I'm rushing too much, aren’t I?

624
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,256
No, it's...

625
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:50,466
It's not that, it's just um...

626
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:51,846
I'm too old?

627
00:57:51,939 --> 00:57:54,306
You know my father is 15 years older than my mother?

628
00:57:54,463 --> 00:57:55,994
And they've been happily married

629
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:57,932
-for 40 years. -Tom, please. Stop.

630
00:57:59,462 --> 00:58:02,800
I just never thought about you that way.

631
00:58:03,152 --> 00:58:04,654
I'm sorry.

632
00:58:15,628 --> 00:58:17,808
It's uh, about Jack, isn't it?

633
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:19,729
I really don't think that's any of your concern.

634
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:21,487
You don't know the first thing about him.

635
00:58:21,603 --> 00:58:24,040
You have no idea...

636
00:58:25,137 --> 00:58:27,224
what you are getting into.

637
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:37,035
I am only trying to protect you.

638
00:58:37,162 --> 00:58:40,574
You know, I can get you out of this place where you don't belong.

639
00:58:42,063 --> 00:58:43,899
You should think about that.

640
01:00:04,598 --> 01:00:06,033
Scoundrel?

641
01:00:08,164 --> 01:00:09,917
Where have you been?

642
01:00:51,275 --> 01:00:54,619
Better not bite me, or I'll turn you into lunch.

643
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,571
Come on out of there.

644
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:18,673
Do not be afraid.

645
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,964
Thomas D. Porter.

646
01:02:28,003 --> 01:02:29,948
<i>Mr. Porter, This is Sam Gouldman.</i>

647
01:02:30,068 --> 01:02:31,463
Mr. Gouldman!

648
01:02:32,268 --> 01:02:34,361
What a pleasure to hear from you. Actually, I was just finishing...

649
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:35,775
<i>Well, we just came out of a board meeting</i>

650
01:02:35,893 --> 01:02:37,884
<i>and after some heartfelt deliberations,</i>

651
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,204
<i>important decisions have been made</i>

652
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:40,955
<i>about the future of our firm.</i>

653
01:02:41,718 --> 01:02:42,775
I'm all ears.

654
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,681
<i>The time has come for us to grow.</i>

655
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,580
<i>So, instead of the position we spoke about,</i>

656
01:02:46,665 --> 01:02:50,188
<i>we have decided to offer you to become a partner in our firm.</i>

657
01:02:50,763 --> 01:02:52,140
<i>How's that sound?</i>

658
01:02:52,322 --> 01:02:54,117
Well, I'm honored, sir.

659
01:02:55,097 --> 01:02:57,551
But just to make sure I understand...

660
01:02:57,621 --> 01:02:59,755
<i>We're offering you the great opportunity</i>

661
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:02,364
<i>of buying ten percent of our shares.</i>

662
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:06,464
<i>Are you there?</i>

663
01:03:07,678 --> 01:03:10,709
And how much are we talking about roughly?

664
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:12,826
<i>Well, it's a little neighborhood south of $5,000.</i>

665
01:03:12,928 --> 01:03:15,560
<i>I assume this won't be a problem.</i>

666
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,245
<i>Right, Mr. Porter?</i>

667
01:03:18,557 --> 01:03:19,645
Right.

668
01:03:20,614 --> 01:03:23,689
But the position is still secured, if I just want to...

669
01:03:23,753 --> 01:03:25,714
<i>I believe I've made my point clear.</i>

670
01:03:26,158 --> 01:03:30,896
<i>What we need right now is a partner, not an employee.</i>

671
01:03:33,111 --> 01:03:34,280
<i>Porter?</i>

672
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,905
<i>Porter?</i>

673
01:03:38,045 --> 01:03:40,059
Well, I'll have to think about it, then.

674
01:03:40,131 --> 01:03:42,008
<i>Well, don't sit on it too long.</i>

675
01:03:42,201 --> 01:03:45,116
<i>If you're not interested, we have to move on to our next candidate.</i>

676
01:03:45,308 --> 01:03:47,081
<i>I'm sure you understand it.</i>

677
01:03:47,568 --> 01:03:49,154
<i>I'll call you Monday.</i>

678
01:03:51,512 --> 01:03:54,044
Thank you, Mr. Gouldman. Thank you.

679
01:04:23,183 --> 01:04:25,621
No! No! No!

680
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,191
No. No.

681
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,074
Billy?

682
01:05:14,505 --> 01:05:15,674
Jane?

683
01:05:47,398 --> 01:05:49,621
How's your mother feeling today?

684
01:05:51,709 --> 01:05:53,465
It seems we have a problem, Jack.

685
01:05:55,093 --> 01:05:57,847
I can't be an accomplice to a forgery.

686
01:05:58,718 --> 01:06:00,171
Please.

687
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:02,716
I'm just trying to look after my family.

688
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:04,561
You lied to me.

689
01:06:04,986 --> 01:06:06,619
You tried to cheat me and in doing so,

690
01:06:06,689 --> 01:06:08,704
you made me an accessory in your little charade.

691
01:06:08,774 --> 01:06:11,063
So, I think it's fair you offer me some kind of compensation.

692
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:12,273
We have nothing!

693
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:15,480
You have 10,000 pounds and you will hand them over to me

694
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:18,957
so I can get out of this cowshit and wear real shoes again.

695
01:06:24,254 --> 01:06:26,746
Now I assume you will discuss this with your siblings.

696
01:06:29,722 --> 01:06:31,160
I'll come by tomorrow.

697
01:06:46,463 --> 01:06:48,113
What are we going to do?

698
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:53,182
We threw that money down the chimney.

699
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:55,543
We have no way of getting it back now.

700
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:57,983
It's all over.

701
01:08:43,763 --> 01:08:44,865
Ah!

702
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:57,024
Billy, give me-give me...

703
01:11:57,122 --> 01:11:58,383
Give me that!

704
01:11:58,543 --> 01:12:01,254
-Yeah, hold this. -Okay, okay.

705
01:12:01,352 --> 01:12:02,312
Ah!

706
01:12:02,367 --> 01:12:03,633
-Billy. -What? What?

707
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:05,016
What have you done?

708
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:07,786
You...

709
01:12:07,926 --> 01:12:10,700
You didn't dare to tear down the wall.

710
01:12:11,019 --> 01:12:13,676
So...so it found another way to the attic.

711
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:15,630
Someone had to try and get that money back.

712
01:12:15,655 --> 01:12:17,841
I told you not to go in there!

713
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:19,454
He survived, Jack.

714
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:23,569
Ah! He survived, Jack.

715
01:12:23,794 --> 01:12:25,957
He's been eating up there.

716
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:28,817
I saw it with my own two eyes.

717
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:31,445
It will kill us all. I saw it.

718
01:12:31,516 --> 01:12:33,954
The place is covered in-- in animal bones!

719
01:12:34,024 --> 01:12:35,477
Doves, raccoons, rats.

720
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:38,266
You cou--You couldn't imagine the stench in there.

721
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:40,404
And he's found a way to store rain water.

722
01:12:40,444 --> 01:12:41,505
It's the rain.

723
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:44,170
-He's alive...again. -He's alive this whole time.

724
01:12:45,482 --> 01:12:46,961
Get out, get out.

725
01:12:47,126 --> 01:12:49,296
-He's got to go. -Please stop it.

726
01:12:49,367 --> 01:12:51,083
No! Stop it?

727
01:12:51,255 --> 01:12:54,468
Stop it? Is anybody listening to me? He's still alive!

728
01:12:54,551 --> 01:12:56,083
And waiting to do some more damage!

729
01:12:56,114 --> 01:12:57,271
I'm done with that son of a bitch!

730
01:12:57,341 --> 01:12:58,377
You know I will.

731
01:12:58,486 --> 01:13:01,182
I will go up there and I will end this, I swear to God!

732
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:03,783
Are you listening to me? Are you listening?

733
01:13:03,952 --> 01:13:05,187
Jack!

734
01:13:06,812 --> 01:13:07,813
Jack!

735
01:13:14,717 --> 01:13:15,561
Jack.

736
01:13:15,702 --> 01:13:17,810
Shh, calm, Jack.

737
01:13:18,006 --> 01:13:19,256
Shh. Jack!

738
01:13:22,623 --> 01:13:23,709
Jack!

739
01:13:25,236 --> 01:13:27,049
We have to tell Allie.

740
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,950
She's the only one who can help him.

741
01:13:38,531 --> 01:13:40,106
No, she'll be scared, she...

742
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,072
She won't want to see him again.

743
01:13:42,212 --> 01:13:44,377
She loves him, Billy.

744
01:13:44,622 --> 01:13:47,751
The only thing that matters now is saving Jack.

745
01:13:48,498 --> 01:13:51,002
We have to tell Allie the truth.

746
01:16:15,509 --> 01:16:16,853
Hello?

747
01:16:29,683 --> 01:16:31,185
Anybody home?

748
01:16:31,711 --> 01:16:33,798
I've come for my money!

749
01:16:34,314 --> 01:16:35,575
Hello!

750
01:17:51,372 --> 01:17:54,685
<i>"The day we locked father up was a day like any other.</i>

751
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:58,397
<i>Nothing could have warned us that he finally found us".</i>

752
01:18:09,828 --> 01:18:10,884
Jack!

753
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,213
Sam!

754
01:18:18,447 --> 01:18:19,616
Take Sam.

755
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,117
Come on, this way!

756
01:18:21,215 --> 01:18:23,298
-Let me go with you. -No, you stay with Jane and Sam.

757
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,696
No! Jack!

758
01:18:25,728 --> 01:18:27,197
-Jack! -Jack?

759
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:28,664
Should be safe here.

760
01:18:28,744 --> 01:18:30,150
Hey, Jack!

761
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:32,411
-Jack! -I will deal with him.

762
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:34,429
Jack! No, Jack!

763
01:18:37,445 --> 01:18:38,991
I've got it!

764
01:18:39,566 --> 01:18:41,151
I'm right here!

765
01:18:42,688 --> 01:18:44,941
This is between you and me!

766
01:18:51,525 --> 01:18:54,608
Stay away from the house and I will give it back!

767
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,770
It was me and me alone.

768
01:19:40,882 --> 01:19:42,384
I ratted you out.

769
01:19:42,559 --> 01:19:43,926
I took your money.

770
01:19:44,707 --> 01:19:46,478
They had nothing to do with it.

771
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:48,692
Take it

772
01:19:48,886 --> 01:19:50,496
and leave us alone.

773
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,527
Jack?

774
01:22:11,646 --> 01:22:13,260
Kill him, Billy.

775
01:23:27,195 --> 01:23:28,558
I'm coming!

776
01:23:28,913 --> 01:23:30,415
I'm coming!

777

782

Open the door, Jack.

784
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:52,438

Our story begins here.

When we cross that line,

808
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:17,776
the past will stay behind.

Billy, we can't.

01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,473
Stop fighting.

841
01:31:31,721 --> 01:31:32,682
Shh.

842
01:31:34,015 --> 01:31:35,001
Jack.

843
01:31:36,627 --> 01:31:39,380
Jack's sleeping, his head hurts.

844
01:31:49,385 --> 01:31:51,444
Jack tried to kill himself.

845
01:31:52,368 --> 01:31:54,120
That's why we came back.

846
01:31:57,730 --> 01:31:59,149
Please, Allie.

847
01:32:01,038 --> 01:32:03,791
We need you to take care of Jack.

848
01:32:23,086 --> 01:32:24,703
Jane?

849
01:32:29,789 --> 01:32:31,428
Forgive me.

850
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:33,729
What?

851
01:32:36,135 --> 01:32:37,369
You.

852
01:32:37,477 --> 01:32:39,147
You can't be here.

853
01:32:39,572 --> 01:32:41,173
They'll go if you stay.

854
01:32:41,761 --> 01:32:43,431
Please leave us alone.

855
01:32:43,635 --> 01:32:44,846
Jack, you're bleeding.

856
01:32:45,119 --> 01:32:46,484
-Jane. -Let me see.

857
01:32:46,837 --> 01:32:48,048
Sam.

858
01:32:49,819 --> 01:32:50,821
Billy.

859
01:32:51,182 --> 01:32:52,174
Ow!

860
01:32:54,621 --> 01:32:56,499
Let me look, Jack. Stop it.

861
01:32:57,751 --> 01:32:59,254
I know everything.

862
01:32:59,311 --> 01:33:00,313
Jack.

863
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:02,465
-Jack, look at me. -Where are they?

864
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:04,127
-Sam. -Jack.

865
01:33:04,337 --> 01:33:05,720
-Sam! -Jack.

866
01:33:06,166 --> 01:33:07,595
-Jane! Jane! -Jack.

867
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:09,517
Jack, look at me. Stop it!

868
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:10,548
-Jane. -Stop.

869
01:33:10,658 --> 01:33:11,869
-Sam. Get off. -Stop it. Stop

870
01:33:11,924 --> 01:33:12,846
-No! -Stop it!

871
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:15,517
-Jack. -Please. They'll go if you stay.

872
01:33:19,583 --> 01:33:21,422
I couldn't keep them safe.

873
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,392
No.

874
01:33:23,861 --> 01:33:25,041
Just leave us alone!

875
01:33:25,158 --> 01:33:28,009
Please, please leave us alone.

876
01:33:28,965 --> 01:33:30,551
Leave us alone.

877
01:33:36,457 --> 01:33:37,542
Go!

878
01:33:40,066 --> 01:33:41,812
-Go! -No.

879
01:33:43,403 --> 01:33:44,404
Go!

880
01:34:07,299 --> 01:34:08,384
Tom?

881
01:35:06,225 --> 01:35:07,394
Tom?

882
01:35:27,917 --> 01:35:29,127
Tom!

883
01:35:31,621 --> 01:35:34,160
Tom, let me see. Okay? Just...

884
01:35:37,684 --> 01:35:38,936
Jack!

885
01:35:45,691 --> 01:35:47,363
Tom, who did this to you?

886
01:36:23,129 --> 01:36:24,844
Jack, help me!

887
01:36:26,771 --> 01:36:27,773
Jack!

888
01:36:31,108 --> 01:36:32,360
Jack.

889
01:37:09,966 --> 01:37:11,725
Why are you hiding?

890
01:37:16,973 --> 01:37:19,053
You think you can scare me?

891
01:37:20,717 --> 01:37:23,274
Well, don't think for a second it's gonna be that easy.

892
01:37:23,401 --> 01:37:24,834
Come out of there!

893
01:37:25,732 --> 01:37:27,498
I'm not alone.

894
01:37:31,657 --> 01:37:33,233
You can hear them within these walls

895
01:37:33,311 --> 01:37:35,499
and you know what? I can hear them too.

896
01:37:37,339 --> 01:37:39,183
You thought you could put out their light like a candle,

897
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:40,230
but you can't.

898
01:37:40,434 --> 01:37:41,435
Allie.

899
01:37:42,303 --> 01:37:44,556
You don't have that power.

900
01:37:55,134 --> 01:37:57,221
You're the one who's dead.

901
01:38:00,268 --> 01:38:01,395
Jane.

902
01:38:04,331 --> 01:38:06,921
Sam, Billy, I know you can hear me!

903
01:38:07,095 --> 01:38:08,745
I know you're there.

904
01:38:10,324 --> 01:38:12,300
Billy, come out of there.

905
01:38:13,364 --> 01:38:14,450
Billy!

906
01:38:14,775 --> 01:38:17,196
Jack, let me do this.

907
01:38:26,297 --> 01:38:27,597
No!

908
01:38:39,894 --> 01:38:41,372
Get away from her!

909
01:38:49,021 --> 01:38:50,883
You don't belong here.

910
01:38:52,231 --> 01:38:54,094
This is our place.

911
01:40:28,669 --> 01:40:30,992
<i>What you're telling me is very good news.</i>

912
01:40:31,135 --> 01:40:35,430
Twelve weeks where Jack has had no episodes of multiple personality.

913
01:40:35,601 --> 01:40:40,148
Jane, Billy and Sam had finally gone to sleep in Jack's mind.

914
01:40:40,317 --> 01:40:42,711
But such a trauma

915
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:45,273
may have unpredictable consequences on his mind,

916
01:40:45,414 --> 01:40:47,062
so we have to be vigilant.

917
01:40:48,064 --> 01:40:51,627
I know we have discussed this before.

918
01:40:51,713 --> 01:40:54,057
But you are a healthy young woman

919
01:40:54,128 --> 01:40:56,495
with a bright future ahead of you.

920
01:40:56,768 --> 01:41:01,135
<i>I don't understand why you choose to live in a house</i>

921
01:41:01,252 --> 01:41:04,658
<i>that will always bear the memory of that terrible event.</i>

922
01:41:05,221 --> 01:41:06,848
<i>It will be sad.</i>

923
01:41:06,991 --> 01:41:08,035
Jack?

924
01:41:08,193 --> 01:41:09,695
<i>It will be lonely.</i>

925
01:41:09,903 --> 01:41:13,333
<i>He is a mentally ill man who can never take proper care of you.</i>

926
01:41:13,487 --> 01:41:14,488
Jack?

927
01:41:14,606 --> 01:41:16,239
<i>There's no reason why you should</i>

928
01:41:16,293 --> 01:41:19,065
<i>carry that burden for the rest of your life.</i>

929
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:27,582
<i>Love cannot grow in a sick mind.</i>

930
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:31,431
<i>And you will never have a real family</i>

931
01:41:31,557 --> 01:41:33,871
<i>if you choose to live with Jack.</i>

932
01:41:36,416 --> 01:41:40,143
Thank you for your concern, doctor.

933
01:41:42,861 --> 01:41:45,947
Please make sure he takes his medication.

934
01:41:49,179 --> 01:41:53,268
<i>It's the only way we can keep Jane, Billy and Sam away from him.</i>

935
01:42:18,865 --> 01:42:20,159
You're home.

936
01:42:20,445 --> 01:42:21,639
Come on, get up.

937
01:42:28,706 --> 01:42:31,053
We never got to celebrate your birthday.

938
01:42:44,531 --> 01:42:46,031
Isn't that amazing?

939
01:42:48,318 --> 01:42:50,572
After all this time, it didn't spoil.

940
01:43:07,159 --> 01:43:08,919
I'll wait inside till they come back.
