1
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,431
<i>Where's my suitcase?</i>

2
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:33,215
Miss. Young lady!

3
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:35,302
Excuse me. Girls!

4
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,303
Hey, little fella. Hey!

5
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:40,912
Excuse me, girls. Girls!

6
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:42,695
Hey, big fella!

7
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,174
Help me make the beds
in the living room.

8
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:46,523
Come on down here!

9
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,654
Hey, son!

10
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,915
Big fella.
Hey, little guy! Little guy!

11
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:57,046
Pete's brother
and his family are here.

12
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:58,830
<i>Trish is going to Montreal.</i>

13
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:01,657
Montreal? Oh, her family's there.

14
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,353
<i>- Then we're off.
- When?</i>

15
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,701
<i>- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready, are you?</i>

16
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,963
Uncle Frank won't let me
watch the movie...

17
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,529
...but the big kids can.

18
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:11,963
Why can't I?

19
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:13,356
I'm on the phone.

20
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,487
When do you come back?
Not till then?

21
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,444
It's not even rated R.
He's just being a jerk.

22
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:23,140
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no...

23
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:25,054
...then it must be really bad.

24
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,403
No, we put the dog in the kennel...
Hey, get off!

25
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:29,837
Kevin, out of the room.

26
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:32,317
Hang up the phone and make me,
why don't you?

27
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:33,622
This kid.

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,274
Did you pick up
a voltage adaptor thing?

29
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:38,015
No, I didn't have time.

30
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:41,015
- Then how do I shave in France?
- Grow a goatee.

31
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,364
Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

32
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:47,844
I've got something, pick up those
MicroMachines that are all over.

33
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:50,061
Aunt Leslie almost broke her neck.

34
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,584
He was playing
with the glue gun again.

35
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,063
We talked about that.

36
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:57,324
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

37
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,455
I made ornaments out of fish hooks.

38
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,542
- My new fish hooks?
- I can't make them out of old ones...

39
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:06,152
...with dry worm guts stuck on them.

40
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:10,066
- Peter.
- Come on, Kevin. Out.

41
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,545
Do you guys have a voltage adaptor?

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,198
Here's a voltage adapter!

43
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:18,024
God, you're getting heavy!
Go pack your suitcase.

44
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:22,288
Pack my suitcase?

45
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:25,026
- Where's the shampoo?
- I don't live here.

46
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:27,418
This many people here and no shampoo.

47
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:29,680
- Are your folks home?
- They don't live here.

48
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:32,507
- Tracy, did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.

49
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:34,724
Excuse me. Are your parents here?

50
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:36,508
My parents live in Paris.

51
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:37,769
- Hi!
- Hi!

52
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:39,422
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:41,510
- Do they live here?
- No.

54
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:45,206
Why should they?
All kids, no parents.

55
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,772
Probably a fancy orphanage.

56
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,903
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done it once.

57
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,296
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

58
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:54,687
What did I say?

59
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:55,948
You told him "Tough."

60
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,601
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What was I supposed to say?

61
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:01,559
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

62
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:03,211
- I'm not an idiot!
- Really?

63
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:06,385
You're helpless! We have to do
everything for you.

64
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,908
- She's right, Kev.
- Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm small.

65
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,649
I don't know how to pack.

66
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,258
- I hope you didn't just pack crap.
- Shut up, Linnie.

67
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:16,954
You know what I should pack?

68
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:20,434
Buzz told you, cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

69
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:23,477
What are you so worried about?

70
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:26,435
You know Mom's gonna
pack your stuff, anyway.

71
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:29,697
<i>You're what the French call
les incompetents.</i>

72
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,913
What?

73
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,742
Bombs away!

74
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:41,700
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

75
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,614
If he has something to drink,
he'll wet the bed.

76
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,658
This house is so full of people
it makes me sick!

77
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:51,616
When I grow up and get married,
I'm living alone!

78
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:52,832
Did you hear me?

79
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:54,617
I'm living alone!

80
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:57,444
I'm living alone!

81
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,140
Who's gonna feed your spider?

82
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,664
He just ate a load of mice guts.
He'll be good for a couple weeks.

83
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:11,317
Is it true French babes
don't shave their pits?

84
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,056
Some don't.

85
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,144
But they got nude beaches.

86
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:17,448
Not in the winter.

87
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:27,669
Don't you know how to knock,
phlegm-wad?

88
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:31,321
Can I sleep here?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

89
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:33,322
If he drinks, he'll wet the bed.

90
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:38,063
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.

91
00:05:41,412 --> 00:05:43,586
Check it out.
Old man Marley.

92
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:48,588
Who's he?

93
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:53,110
You ever heard of the South Bend
Shovel Slayer?

94
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:54,850
That's him.

95
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:59,939
In '58 he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...

96
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,026
...with a snow shovel.

97
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:06,548
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.

98
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,376
If he's the shovel slayer,
how come the cops don't arrest him?

99
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:12,333
Not enough evidence to convict.

100
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:15,159
They never found the bodies.

101
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,334
Everyone around here knows he did it.

102
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,943
It'll just be a matter of time...

103
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,118
...before he does it again.

104
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:23,293
What's he doing?

105
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:27,162
He walks up and down the streets
every night...

106
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,685
...salting the sidewalks.

107
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,773
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

108
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:35,208
No way.

109
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,340
See that garbage can full of salt?

110
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,775
That's where he keeps his victims.

111
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:46,776
The salt turns the bodies
into mummies.

112
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:50,778
Mummies!

113
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:56,432
Look out!

114
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:30,614
How you kids doing?

115
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,963
Good?

116
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,616
Lot of action around here today, huh?

117
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,441
Going on vacation?

118
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:38,182
Where you going?

119
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,921
You hear me, or what?

120
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,878
Going on a trip?

121
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:44,053
Where you going, kid?

122
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:56,405
Okay, that's $122.50.

123
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:58,927
Not from me, kid. I don't live here.

124
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:01,101
You just around for the holidays?

125
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:02,536
You could say that.

126
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:04,319
- Pizza's here!
- There you go.

127
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:06,494
That's $122.50.

128
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:08,798
It's my brother's house.
He'll get it.

129
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,104
Hey, listen...

130
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,322
- Are you Mr. McCallister?
- Yeah.

131
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,454
The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

132
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:21,106
Good, because somebody owes me $122.50.

133
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,325
I'd like a word with you.

134
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,803
Am I under arrest or something?

135
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:28,847
There's always a lot of burglaries
around the holidays.

136
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:33,197
We're checking the neighborhood to see
if the proper precautions are taken.

137
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,458
We have automatic timers for our
lights, locks for our doors.

138
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:39,633
That's about as well
as anybody can do.

139
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,895
- Did you get some eggnog?
- Come on.

140
00:08:42,112 --> 00:08:43,590
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

141
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:44,722
- Eggnog?
- Pizza!

142
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:48,244
- Are you gonna be leaving...?
- Pizza!

143
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,245
Grab a napkin
and pour your own drinks.

144
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:56,116
- Does Santa go through customs?
- What time do we have to go to bed?

145
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,160
Early. We're leaving at 8 a.m.
On the button.

146
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:03,205
I hope you're all drinking milk.
I want to get rid of it.

147
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:07,946
- Pizza boy needs $122.50, plus tip.
- For pizza?

148
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,858
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

149
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:12,555
- You've got money.
- Traveler's checks.

150
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,817
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.

151
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:18,295
You probably got the checks
that don't work in France.

152
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:21,384
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

153
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,558
Yeah. But if you want any...

154
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:27,254
...somebody's gonna have to barf it up
because it's gone.

155
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,256
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

156
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:40,084
Kev! Kev, get a plate.

157
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,871
- Passports!
- Watch it!

158
00:09:56,307 --> 00:09:58,741
No, no. Get these passports
out of here.

159
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,222
Are you okay, honey? Come here.

160
00:10:05,352 --> 00:10:06,265
Are you all right?

161
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,179
What is the matter with you?

162
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:11,136
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.

163
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:13,398
He knows I hate sausage and olives...

164
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,050
Look what you did, you little jerk!

165
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,924
Get upstairs now.

166
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:32,185
Why?

167
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,012
You're such a disease.

168
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,621
- Shut up!
- Kevin, upstairs!

169
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,969
- Say good night, Kevin.
- "Good night, Kevin."

170
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,883
Why do I get treated like scum?

171
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:46,624
I'm sorry. This house is just crazy.

172
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:49,973
We've got all these extra kids
running around.

173
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:52,364
My brother's in from Ohio.
It's nuts.

174
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:55,104
How come you didn't bring
more cheese pizzas?

175
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:57,236
Nice tip. Thanks.

176
00:10:58,671 --> 00:10:59,976
Having a reunion?

177
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:04,281
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris. His kids are still here.

178
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,194
He missed the family,
so he invited us to Paris...

179
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:08,499
...so we'll be together.

180
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:10,151
You're taking a trip to Paris?

181
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:12,370
Yes, we leave tomorrow morning.

182
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:14,719
Excellent. Excellent.

183
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:17,980
If you'll excuse me, this one's
a little out of sorts.

184
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,893
Don't worry about me.
I spoke to your husband.

185
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:25,896
And don't worry about your home.
It's in good hands.

186
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:32,027
There are 15 people, and only you
have to make trouble.

187
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:33,592
I'm getting dumped on.

188
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:36,594
You're the only one acting up.
Now get upstairs.

189
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:39,072
I am upstairs, dummy!

190
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,508
The third floor?

191
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,900
- Go.
- It's scary up there.

192
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:45,943
Fuller'll be up in a little while.

193
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:49,205
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
He wets the bed.

194
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:51,641
He'll pee all over me. I know it.

195
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:53,642
We'll put him somewhere else.

196
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,295
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,904
It's too late. Get upstairs.

198
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,035
Everyone in this family hates me!

199
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:06,341
Then ask Santa for a new family.

200
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:10,081
I don't want a new family. I don't
want any family. Families suck!

201
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,386
Stay up there. I don't want
to see you again tonight.

202
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:16,082
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

203
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:18,778
I don't want to see
anybody else either.

204
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:21,084
I hope you don't mean that.

205
00:12:21,302 --> 00:12:25,042
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up
and didn't have a family.

206
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:27,259
No, I wouldn't.

207
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:30,086
Then say it again.
Maybe it'll happen.

208
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:33,435
I hope I never see any
of you jerks again!

209
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:57,355
<i>I wish they would all just disappear.</i>

210
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:57,501
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8 sharp.

211
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:07,329
Peter!

212
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,200
We slept in!

213
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,119
Hi, I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

214
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:33,163
You guys going out of town?

215
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:34,685
We're going to Florida.

216
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:38,468
Well, first we're going to Missouri
to pick up my grandma.

217
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:41,252
You know the McCallisters
are going to France?

218
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:42,817
Do you know if it's cold?

219
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:47,602
- Do these vans get good mileage?
- Kid, I don't know. Hit the road!

220
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,516
Do a head count.
Get everyone in the vans.

221
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:54,995
Where are the passports?

222
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,083
I put them in the microwave to dry.

223
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,040
How fast does this go?
Does it have automatic transmission?

224
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:03,041
Does it have 4-wheel drive?

225
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:07,128
Look, I told you before, kid.
Don't bother me. Now, beat it!

226
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:20,828
Line up in front of the van.

227
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:24,698
- Line up and shut up!
- Wow!

228
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,220
Shut up!

229
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:27,656
I need a head count.

230
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:29,525
One, two, three...

231
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:31,918
Eleven, 92, 12...

232
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:34,353
Buzz, don't be a moron.

233
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:37,527
Six, seven, eight...

234
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:40,354
...nine, 10, 11.

235
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:44,398
Okay, half in this van,
half in this one. Let's go.

236
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,487
Have a good trip.
Bring me back something French.

237
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:54,836
There's no way we'll make this plane.
It leaves in 45 minutes.

238
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,489
Think positive!

239
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,447
You be positive.
I'll be realistic.

240
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:02,143
Excuse me, your power is fixed...

241
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,883
...but the phones are a mess.
It'll take a couple of days to fix...

242
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:08,667
...especially around the holidays.
- Thanks.

243
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,232
Did you count heads?

244
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,145
Eleven, including me.

245
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:15,407
Five boys, six girls,
two drivers...

246
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,018
...and a partridge in a pear tree.

247
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,200
Hold the plane!

248
00:16:54,636 --> 00:16:56,332
- Did we miss it?
- You just made it.

249
00:16:58,202 --> 00:17:02,203
Single seats only in coach.
Take whatever's free.

250
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,987
I get a window seat!

251
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,726
- Kids are in coach, we're first class.
- Seats Four A and B.

252
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:13,423
Four A and B. I'll take your coats.

253
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:17,076
- Fasten your seat belts.
- Champagne, please.

254
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:19,425
- It's free, isn't it?
- Oh, yes.

255
00:17:20,425 --> 00:17:21,382
We made it.

256
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,948
Do you believe it?

257
00:17:23,948 --> 00:17:25,382
Hope we didn't forget anything.

258
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,405
Mom?

259
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:58,321
- That's real. It's real crystal.
- Yeah, so?

260
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:01,408
- Put them in your purse.
- Frank, I can't do that.

261
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:04,366
Just... Put them in your purse!

262
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:07,149
Yeah. Fill it up.
Fill it up.

263
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,672
Fill it up, please.

264
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:10,802
Thank you.

265
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:14,456
Don't you feel like a heel, flying
first class with the kids in coach?

266
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,109
No. The kids are fine.

267
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:20,588
The only time I ever flew as a kid was
in the station wagon, not to France.

268
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,676
We had to go to Aunt Laura
and Uncle Arthur's.

269
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,198
Kids are okay. They're having
the time of their lives.

270
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:29,851
Hello?

271
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,721
Mom?

272
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:36,591
Dad?

273
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:47,378
Where are you guys?

274
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,683
Buzz?

275
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,121
Megan?

276
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:05,949
Hello?

277
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:10,166
Rod?

278
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:11,775
Uncle Frank?

279
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:14,515
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?

280
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:19,385
Megan? Linnie?

281
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,735
Is this a joke?

282
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:49,264
It's only my imagination.

283
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,351
Only my imagination.

284
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:11,922
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport!

285
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:33,319
I made my family disappear.

286
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,625
<i>You're completely helpless.</i>

287
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:37,799
<i>You know, Kevin...</i>

288
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:41,625
<i>... you're what the French call
les incompetents.</i>

289
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:44,801
<i>Kevin, I'm going to feed you
to my tarantula.</i>

290
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:47,888
<i>Kevin, you are such a disease.</i>

291
00:21:48,063 --> 00:21:53,021
<i>There are 15 people, and you're
the only one who has to make trouble.</i>

292
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:56,760
<i>Look what you did, you little jerk!</i>

293
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,936
I made my family disappear.

294
00:22:18,027 --> 00:22:19,723
I'm free!

295
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:32,988
Wow!

296
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:43,077
No clothes on anybody.
Sickening!

297
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:46,165
Cool! Firecrackers!

298
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:47,861
I'll save these for later.

299
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:51,036
Buzz, I'm going through
all your private stuff.

300
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,819
You better come out and pound me!

301
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,820
Buzz, your girlfriend! Woof!

302
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,181
<i>Who is it?</i>

303
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:56,227
<i>It's me. Snakes.</i>

304
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,705
<i>I got the stuff.</i>

305
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:00,750
<i>Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.</i>

306
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:04,185
<i>All right, Johnny,
but what about my money?</i>

307
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,359
<i>What money?</i>

308
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,795
<i>A.C. Said you had some dough for me.</i>

309
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,927
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

310
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:13,058
<i>A.C. Said ten percent.</i>

311
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:16,624
<i>Too bad A.C. Ain't in charge no more.</i>

312
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,841
Guys, I'm eating junk
and watching rubbish!

313
00:24:20,017 --> 00:24:22,408
You better come out and stop me!

314
00:24:22,843 --> 00:24:24,886
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

315
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:30,063
<i>I'll tell you what I'm gonna
give you.</i>

316
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,976
<i>I'm gonna give you to
the count of ten...</i>

317
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:37,021
<i>... to get your ugly, yellow...</i>

318
00:24:37,238 --> 00:24:39,413
<i>... no-good keister off my property...</i>

319
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,587
<i>... before I pump your guts
full of lead.</i>

320
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:43,239
<i>All right, I'm sorry.</i>

321
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:44,457
<i>I'm going.</i>

322
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,980
<i>One, two... ten.</i>

323
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:04,637
<i>Keep the change,
you filthy animal.</i>

324
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,680
Mom!

325
00:25:19,032 --> 00:25:20,424
What's the matter?

326
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:22,990
Honey?

327
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:26,861
I have a terrible feeling.

328
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:27,947
About what?

329
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,122
That we didn't do something.

330
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,558
You feel that way because
we left in a hurry.

331
00:25:34,776 --> 00:25:36,471
We took care of everything.

332
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:37,993
Did I turn off the coffee?

333
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:39,559
No.

334
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:40,864
I did.

335
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,559
Did you lock up?

336
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:45,082
Yeah.

337
00:25:46,474 --> 00:25:47,822
Did you close the garage?

338
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,954
That's it.

339
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:53,520
I forgot to close the garage.
That's it.

340
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:01,131
No, that's not it.

341
00:26:03,174 --> 00:26:05,000
What else could we be forgetting?

342
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:09,872
Kevin!

343
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:56,753
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are out of order.

344
00:26:56,971 --> 00:26:59,493
We'll call when we land.
I'm sure it's okay.

345
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:03,233
Horrible. Horrible.

346
00:27:03,712 --> 00:27:04,973
Just horrible.

347
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:07,931
How could we do this?
We forgot him.

348
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:10,583
We didn't forget him,
we just miscounted.

349
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,975
What kind of mother am I?

350
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:17,760
If it makes you feel any better,
I forgot my reading glasses.

351
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,240
<i>Five families gone
on one block alone.</i>

352
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:28,371
<i>They all told me from their
own mouths.</i>

353
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:30,110
<i>It's almost too easy.</i>

354
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:31,763
Check it out:

355
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:34,068
All the houses with nobody home...

356
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:37,069
...have automatic timers
on their lights.

357
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:40,678
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.

358
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,898
Number 664 will be going on
right about...

359
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:49,463
...now.

360
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:52,464
Wait, wait, wait.

361
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:56,552
Number 682...

362
00:27:57,379 --> 00:27:59,858
...right now.

363
00:28:02,207 --> 00:28:03,337
Wait a minute.

364
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,382
681...

365
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,729
...now.

366
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:13,774
And that's the one, Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

367
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,426
It's very G.

368
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:18,515
Very G, huh? It's loaded.

369
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:20,994
It's got lots of top-flight goods.

370
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:24,516
- Stereos, VCRs...
- Toys?

371
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:27,300
Probably looking at some
very fine jewelry.

372
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:29,169
Possible cash horde.

373
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:32,389
Odd marketable securities.

374
00:28:32,954 --> 00:28:35,302
Who knows? It's a gem.

375
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:38,085
Grab your crowbar.

376
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:40,739
Crowbars up.

377
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:47,522
<i>You're a rotter,
Mr. Grinch</i>

378
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:51,611
<i>You're the king
Of sinful sots</i>

379
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:54,308
<i>Your heart's a dead tomato</i>

380
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:59,048
<i>Blotched with moldy purple spots,
Mr. Grinch</i>

381
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:41,058
Which way?

382
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:44,060
We'll go around back,
down the basement.

383
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:07,718
- You said they were gone.
- They were gonna leave today.

384
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:09,544
Let's get out of here.

385
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:48,338
We have to use the phone, please.

386
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:51,904
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

387
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:54,600
Please! Our brother's home alone.

388
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,079
Give us the phone!

389
00:30:57,427 --> 00:30:58,601
I'm sorry. Thank you.

390
00:30:58,862 --> 00:31:01,471
I'm calling the police.
Book us a flight home.

391
00:31:01,689 --> 00:31:04,603
Get change out of here.
Call everybody you know.

392
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:08,909
Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everyone on our street.

393
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,952
Maybe somebody can help us.

394
00:31:11,127 --> 00:31:14,518
Hello? Hello?
Oh, she'll have to call you back.

395
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:22,259
This is ridiculous.

396
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:24,783
Only a wimp would be
hiding under a bed.

397
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,958
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

398
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:39,656
Hey, I'm not afraid anymore!

399
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:44,265
I said, I'm not afraid anymore!

400
00:31:44,745 --> 00:31:48,615
Do you hear me?
I'm not afraid anymore.

401
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:20,492
Village police department.

402
00:32:20,754 --> 00:32:24,146
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

403
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:29,322
<i>I'd like somebody to go there. Tell
him that we're coming home to get him.</i>

404
00:32:29,496 --> 00:32:33,062
Okay, let me connect you
with Family Crisis Intervention.

405
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,714
Hold on.

406
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:40,019
Larry, can you pick up?
There's some hyper lady on hold.

407
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:42,672
- What line, Rose?
- Two.

408
00:32:43,326 --> 00:32:45,717
Family Crisis Intervention,
Sergeant Balzac.

409
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:48,805
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

410
00:32:49,023 --> 00:32:53,719
Has the child been involved in
violence with a drunk family member?

411
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:54,893
No!

412
00:32:55,198 --> 00:32:57,764
Has he been involved
in a household accident?

413
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:00,069
I don't know. I hope not.

414
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:05,505
Has the child ingested any poison
or is an object lodged in his throat?

415
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:09,201
No, he's home alone! I'd like
somebody to go over to the house...

416
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,116
...and see if he's all right.

417
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:15,855
You want us to go to your house,
just to check on him.

418
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:17,247
Yes!

419
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,378
Let me connect you to the police.

420
00:33:19,596 --> 00:33:21,030
They just transferred me.

421
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,205
- Rose!
- Yeah.

422
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,422
- Hyper.
- Hang on.

423
00:33:23,597 --> 00:33:27,206
- Hold on, please.
- No, please don't hang up. Please!

424
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,337
Any luck?

425
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:33,730
- I couldn't get anybody.
- Leslie?

426
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:36,208
Nothing but a bunch
of answering machines.

427
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:41,385
Somebody pick up. Pick up!

428
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,602
Oh, hi, ma'am. It's you again.

429
00:33:43,777 --> 00:33:47,734
Look, I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone, and l...

430
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:51,648
We'll send a policeman over
to your house to check on your son.

431
00:34:22,004 --> 00:34:24,613
There's nobody home.
The house looks secure.

432
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:26,875
Tell them to count their kids again.

433
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,528
You can't bump somebody or ask or...?

434
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:32,571
There's no way I can do that.

435
00:34:32,702 --> 00:34:34,877
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?

436
00:34:35,094 --> 00:34:36,529
If you said it's an emergency...

437
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:38,139
I cannot ask them.

438
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:40,531
She's sending a policeman
over to the house.

439
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:43,618
Well, that's a relief.
Everything here is booked.

440
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:44,923
Nothing to Chicago?

441
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:48,359
There's nothing to Chicago,
New York, Nashville.

442
00:34:49,794 --> 00:34:52,881
- What about a private plane?
- Sorry. We don't do that.

443
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,013
The only thing is a booking
for us on Friday morning.

444
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:58,709
Friday morn... That's two days away.

445
00:34:58,928 --> 00:35:00,884
The kids are exhausted and so are you.

446
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:03,015
There's nothing we can do here.

447
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:07,842
I say we go over to Rob's, and that
way we can call the police again.

448
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,321
I'm not leaving here unless
it's on an airplane.

449
00:35:11,495 --> 00:35:13,539
Madame, we are doing
everything we can.

450
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:17,757
If you want to stay at the airport,
maybe we can get you on standby.

451
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,933
It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.

452
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:24,542
- Is that okay?
- Yes. I'll wait.

453
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,458
I'll miss you, honey.

454
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:38,155
Don't you get lost.

455
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:40,894
Goodbye.

456
00:35:56,812 --> 00:36:00,030
I took a shower, washing every
body part with actual soap.

457
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:01,987
Including all my major crevices...

458
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:04,596
...between my toes
and in my belly button...

459
00:36:04,815 --> 00:36:07,206
...which I never did before
but enjoyed.

460
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:12,686
I washed my hair with adult formula
shampoo and used creme rinse.

461
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,121
I can't find my toothbrush,
so I'll pick one up today.

462
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,427
Other than that, I'm in good shape.

463
00:37:10,049 --> 00:37:13,267
All right! Buzz's life savings.

464
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,753
I thought the Murphys
went to Florida.

465
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,150
You're one of the great
cat burglars of the world.

466
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:04,976
You think you can keep it
down a little in there?

467
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:09,370
<i>You've reached the Murphy's.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

468
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:14,196
<i>This is Peter McCallister again.
We're in Paris at my brother's.</i>

469
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:17,850
<i>Let me give you the number here.
The country code is 33.</i>

470
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:22,981
<i>The area code is 1-4 and the number
is 694-876...</i>

471
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:25,286
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah?

472
00:38:25,548 --> 00:38:28,939
That house we ran last night,
was that the McCallister's?

473
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:33,637
<i>- Call me in Paris.
- You're right. They're gone.</i>

474
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:40,595
- I knew they were.
- Silver tuna tonight.

475
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:43,814
Wow!

476
00:38:49,772 --> 00:38:51,076
How may I help you?

477
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:55,033
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

478
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:57,425
Well, I don't know.

479
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,165
It doesn't say, hon.

480
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,818
Can you please find out?

481
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,689
- Herb.
- Yeah?

482
00:39:06,907 --> 00:39:10,168
I got a question here
about a toothbrush.

483
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:21,389
Do you know, is this brush approved
by the American Dental Association?

484
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,606
I don't know.

485
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,525
Oh, hon, you pay for that here.

486
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:51,483
Wait, you have to pay for that.

487
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,527
Son! Son!

488
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:58,267
Jimmy, stop that boy!

489
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:03,834
Hey!

490
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,662
Shoplifter!

491
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,751
Hey! Hey, kid!

492
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:23,101
Come back here!

493
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,276
Stop it, will you?

494
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:27,972
Come here.

495
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:07,894
I'm a criminal.

496
00:41:35,295 --> 00:41:36,208
What's so funny?

497
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:39,077
What's so funny?

498
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:40,687
Why are you laughing?

499
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:45,297
You did it again.

500
00:41:46,646 --> 00:41:48,080
You left the water running.

501
00:41:49,038 --> 00:41:51,516
Why do you do that?
I told you not to do it.

502
00:41:51,646 --> 00:41:54,037
- It's our calling card.
- Calling card.

503
00:41:54,256 --> 00:41:56,430
All the great ones leave their mark.

504
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:58,213
We're the wet bandits.

505
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:01,171
You're sick, you know?
You're really sick.

506
00:42:01,998 --> 00:42:03,781
- I'm not sick.
- Yes, you are.

507
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:05,214
It's a sick thing to do.

508
00:42:12,043 --> 00:42:13,913
- We don't need that.
- Don't tell me...

509
00:42:14,044 --> 00:42:15,957
I can do it if I want to.

510
00:42:18,045 --> 00:42:20,350
It's not sick. Hey, watch out!

511
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,048
Hey! Hey!

512
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:32,179
You've gotta watch for traffic.

513
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:34,440
- Sorry.
- Damn.

514
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:37,050
Santy don't visit
the funeral homes, buddy.

515
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,354
Okay, okay.

516
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,311
Merry Christmas.

517
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:53,792
What's the matter?

518
00:42:54,142 --> 00:42:56,533
I don't like the way
that kid looked at me.

519
00:42:56,752 --> 00:43:00,143
- Ever seen him before?
- I saw a hundred kids this week.

520
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:02,926
Let's see what house he goes into.

521
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:36,849
Why's he going faster?

522
00:43:37,022 --> 00:43:39,109
I told you something's wrong.

523
00:43:39,371 --> 00:43:41,328
He looked at me weird.
Why would he run?

524
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:19,208
Maybe he went in the church.

525
00:44:19,513 --> 00:44:22,252
- I'm not going in there.
- Me neither.

526
00:44:22,557 --> 00:44:23,688
Let's get out of here.

527
00:44:42,518 --> 00:44:45,823
When those guys come back,
I'll be ready.

528
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:12,047
Did they come back?

529
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:14,310
From Paris?

530
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:52,319
We'll come back tomorrow.
Maybe they'll be gone.

531
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:55,625
We better go before somebody sees us.

532
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:29,243
Look what I found in the kitchen.

533
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,591
Frank, those are for later.

534
00:46:36,332 --> 00:46:38,723
Do you want a little shrimp, huh?

535
00:46:39,854 --> 00:46:41,594
Do you speak English?

536
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:46,464
Well, is there...

537
00:46:52,249 --> 00:46:55,467
- Did you get anybody?
- I am looking for my son!

538
00:46:55,684 --> 00:46:57,336
No, I can't find anybody.

539
00:46:57,555 --> 00:47:00,686
They're all shopping.
Nobody's home for the holidays.

540
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,468
Never mind, forget it.

541
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:06,121
- This is so pointless.
- What?

542
00:47:06,644 --> 00:47:08,731
We're here rotting in this apartment.

543
00:47:08,949 --> 00:47:11,167
Kevin's at home.
Mom's at the airport.

544
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,124
- So?
- You're not worried about Kevin?

545
00:47:14,342 --> 00:47:19,213
Why should I be? He acted like a jerk
and now he caught it in the butt.

546
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,213
He's so little and helpless.

547
00:47:22,387 --> 00:47:23,822
Don't you think he's freaked?

548
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,084
The trout can use a couple of days
in the real world.

549
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,563
You're not worried
something might happen?

550
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,347
No. For three reasons:

551
00:47:32,564 --> 00:47:37,217
A. I'm not that lucky.
Two: We have smoke detectors...

552
00:47:37,435 --> 00:47:41,349
...and D: We live in the most boring
street in the United States...

553
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,828
...where nothing even remotely
dangerous will ever happen. Period.

554
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:13,966
<i>Who is it?</i>

555
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,401
It's Little Nero's.
I have your pizza.

556
00:48:16,967 --> 00:48:19,620
<i>Leave it on the doorstep
and get out of here.</i>

557
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:22,055
Okay.

558
00:48:23,491 --> 00:48:24,795
What about the money?

559
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:27,666
<i>What money?</i>

560
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:31,145
Well, you have to pay
for your pizza, sir.

561
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:35,494
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

562
00:48:36,973 --> 00:48:38,843
That'll be $11.80, sir.

563
00:48:46,236 --> 00:48:48,932
<i>Keep the change, you filthy animal.</i>

564
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:52,542
<i>- Cheapskate.
- Hey.</i>

565
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:55,064
<i>I'm gonna give you
to the count of ten...</i>

566
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:57,673
<i>... to get your ugly, yellow...</i>

567
00:48:57,892 --> 00:48:59,979
<i>... no-good keister
off my property...</i>

568
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:02,283
<i>... before I pump you full of lead.</i>

569
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:05,197
<i>One, two... ten.</i>

570
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:36,467
A lovely cheese pizza, just for me.

571
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:41,425
<i>- To Dallas/Forth Worth.</i>

572
00:49:41,643 --> 00:49:43,468
<i>American Airlines...</i>

573
00:49:45,209 --> 00:49:47,687
So we have the $500,
the pocket translator...

574
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:50,296
...the two first-class seats,
that's an upgrade...

575
00:49:50,514 --> 00:49:51,688
Is that a real Rolex?

576
00:49:53,428 --> 00:49:55,733
- Do you think it is?
- No.

577
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,168
But who can tell?
I also have a ring.

578
00:49:59,343 --> 00:50:01,300
Oh, that is beautiful!

579
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:02,734
They're boarding.

580
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:06,605
She's offered us two first-class
tickets if we go Friday.

581
00:50:06,823 --> 00:50:11,084
Plus a ring, a watch,
a pocket translator, $500 and...

582
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:12,563
The earrings.

583
00:50:12,868 --> 00:50:16,652
She's got her own earrings.
A whole shoebox full of them.

584
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:18,434
- Come on, come on.
- No, but...

585
00:50:19,957 --> 00:50:20,869
I'm desperate.

586
00:50:21,957 --> 00:50:25,784
I'm begging you.
From a mother to a mother. Please!

587
00:50:27,873 --> 00:50:30,525
- Oh, Ed.
- Please!

588
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:33,264
Oh, all right.

589
00:50:39,006 --> 00:50:41,484
<i>"Dear Santa, I got a little sister
last year.</i>

590
00:50:41,702 --> 00:50:44,268
<i>This year I'd rather have
some Clay-Doh. "</i>

591
00:50:58,184 --> 00:50:59,271
I didn't mean it.

592
00:50:59,446 --> 00:51:02,533
If you come back, I'll never be
a pain in the butt again.

593
00:51:02,882 --> 00:51:06,099
I promise. Good night.

594
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:28,758
<i>I'm dreaming</i>

595
00:51:28,976 --> 00:51:30,193
<i>Of a white</i>

596
00:51:31,324 --> 00:51:33,324
<i>Christmas</i>

597
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:37,760
<i>Just like the ones
I used to know</i>

598
00:51:39,935 --> 00:51:43,719
<i>Where those treetops glisten</i>

599
00:51:43,936 --> 00:51:47,633
<i>And children listen</i>

600
00:51:47,894 --> 00:51:52,808
<i>To hear sleigh bells
In the snow</i>

601
00:51:53,503 --> 00:51:55,199
<i>The snow</i>

602
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:49,214
Are those microwave dinners good?

603
00:52:49,954 --> 00:52:52,606
- I don't know.
- I'll give them a whirl.

604
00:52:58,174 --> 00:52:59,652
For the kids.

605
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,174
Hold on, I got a coupon for that.

606
00:53:05,523 --> 00:53:07,393
It was in the paper this morning.

607
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,003
$19.83.

608
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:13,916
Okay.

609
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:19,395
Are you here all by yourself?

610
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,484
Ma'am, I'm 8 years old.

611
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:27,006
You think I'd be here alone?
I don't think so.

612
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,789
Where's your mom?

613
00:53:29,008 --> 00:53:30,573
- In the car.
- Where's your dad?

614
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,704
- He's at work.
- What about brothers and sisters?

615
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:35,226
I'm an only child.

616
00:53:35,749 --> 00:53:37,879
- Where do you live?
- I can't tell you.

617
00:53:38,053 --> 00:53:40,923
- Why not?
- Cause you're a stranger.

618
00:54:19,587 --> 00:54:22,761
<i>Hello, Kevin!</i>

619
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,501
Shut up!

620
00:54:41,157 --> 00:54:42,418
I don't get it.

621
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,202
It looks like there's nobody's home.

622
00:54:46,202 --> 00:54:48,289
Last night the place is jumping.

623
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:50,638
Something ain't right.

624
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:52,682
Go check it out.

625
00:55:01,684 --> 00:55:02,771
Now?

626
00:55:03,294 --> 00:55:06,816
No, tomorrow, egghead!
Now! Go ahead.

627
00:55:09,122 --> 00:55:10,252
"Now."

628
00:55:27,605 --> 00:55:28,691
Shit!

629
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:33,563
<i>Get the hell out of here.</i>

630
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,911
<i>All right, Johnny.
But what about my money?</i>

631
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:38,172
<i>What money?</i>

632
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,607
<i>A.C. Said you had
some dough for me.</i>

633
00:55:40,782 --> 00:55:43,696
<i>Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?</i>

634
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,653
<i>A.C. Said ten percent.</i>

635
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:49,480
<i>Too bad A.C.
Ain't in charge no more.</i>

636
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:50,785
<i>What do you mean?</i>

637
00:55:51,003 --> 00:55:53,525
<i>He's upstairs, taking a bath.</i>

638
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:56,525
<i>He'll call you when he gets out.</i>

639
00:55:58,004 --> 00:56:02,221
<i>Hey, I tell you what I'm
gonna give you, Snakes.</i>

640
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:06,136
<i>- Snakes?
- I'll give you to the count of ten...</i>

641
00:56:06,355 --> 00:56:08,572
<i>... to get your ugly,
yellow, no-good...</i>

642
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:10,746
<i>... keister off my property...</i>

643
00:56:10,964 --> 00:56:13,007
<i>... before I pump you full of lead.</i>

644
00:56:13,182 --> 00:56:15,878
<i>All right, Johnny. I'm sorry.
I'm going.</i>

645
00:56:16,096 --> 00:56:18,923
<i>One, two... ten.</i>

646
00:56:38,232 --> 00:56:41,189
<i>Keep the change, you filthy animal.</i>

647
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:46,799
What happened?

648
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:49,713
I don't know who, but somebody
just got blown away.

649
00:56:49,932 --> 00:56:52,280
Somebody beat us,
they're in there.

650
00:56:52,497 --> 00:56:53,628
Two of them.

651
00:56:53,802 --> 00:56:56,454
There was arguing.
One blew the other one away.

652
00:56:56,672 --> 00:56:58,238
- Who?
- I don't know.

653
00:56:59,151 --> 00:57:04,065
I recognized one of their voices.
I heard that name "Snakes" before.

654
00:57:04,283 --> 00:57:08,023
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes.
I don't know no Snakes.

655
00:57:08,197 --> 00:57:11,546
Snakes. Let's get out of here.

656
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,111
Hold it. Hold it.

657
00:57:15,286 --> 00:57:18,634
Let's wait and see who it is.
We work this neighborhood too.

658
00:57:19,461 --> 00:57:21,460
Suppose the cops finger us
for a job...

659
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,679
...and they ask us about
a murder in the area.

660
00:57:24,897 --> 00:57:27,854
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a face to go with it?

661
00:57:30,464 --> 00:57:31,681
That's a good idea.

662
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:35,247
Of course it's a good idea.
Snakes?

663
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:37,596
He sounded like a snake.

664
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,424
Everything's full.

665
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:47,076
Everything's full?

666
00:57:47,294 --> 00:57:50,164
I'm very sorry, but
it is Christmas Eve.

667
00:57:50,904 --> 00:57:52,643
What about another airline?

668
00:57:57,384 --> 00:58:00,210
Nothing available.
May I help you get a hotel room?

669
00:58:00,385 --> 00:58:02,342
Tomorrow we can get you a flight.

670
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,255
I can't wait that long.

671
00:58:04,516 --> 00:58:08,474
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we're
doing absolutely everything we can.

672
00:58:12,649 --> 00:58:15,693
I'm in your way. I'm sorry.
You've places to go.

673
00:58:15,911 --> 00:58:18,302
Got a ticket there, good. Excuse me.

674
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:21,869
Look, I have been awake
for almost 60 hours.

675
00:58:22,087 --> 00:58:23,565
I'm tired and I'm dirty.

676
00:58:23,782 --> 00:58:27,870
I have been from Chicago to Paris,
to Dallas, to... Where am I?

677
00:58:28,436 --> 00:58:29,740
Scranton.

678
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,784
I'm trying to get home
to my 8-year-old son.

679
00:58:33,698 --> 00:58:36,132
Now you're telling me it's hopeless?

680
00:58:36,351 --> 00:58:38,829
- I'm sorry.
- No. No way.

681
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:40,135
This is Christmas!

682
00:58:40,352 --> 00:58:42,787
The season of perpetual hope.

683
00:58:43,005 --> 00:58:45,919
If I have to get on
your runway and hitchhike...

684
00:58:46,136 --> 00:58:48,093
...if it costs me everything I own...

685
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:51,181
...if I have to sell my soul
to the Devil himself...

686
00:58:51,399 --> 00:58:54,182
...I am going to get home to my son.

687
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,487
Ma'am, if there was anything...

688
00:58:57,705 --> 00:58:59,183
Do it. Do anything.

689
00:58:59,444 --> 00:59:01,401
- I can get you a hotel room.
- What?

690
00:59:01,662 --> 00:59:05,662
Can you excuse us for a sec?
Can I see you for a second, please?

691
00:59:05,881 --> 00:59:07,794
Excuse us.

692
00:59:09,882 --> 00:59:12,273
You got a little bit of a dilemma.

693
00:59:12,492 --> 00:59:14,926
We got a crisis ourselves.

694
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:17,710
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski.

695
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:22,363
Polka King of the Midwest?

696
00:59:25,582 --> 00:59:27,843
The Kenosha Kickers?

697
00:59:28,452 --> 00:59:29,756
- Hi there.
- Hiya.

698
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:34,018
That's okay. I thought you might
have recognized...

699
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:37,845
I had a few hits a few years ago.
That's why I just...

700
00:59:38,063 --> 00:59:42,716
<i>"Polka, Polka, Polka"?
Polka, polka, polka</i>

701
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:43,890
"Twin Lakes Polka"?

702
00:59:44,109 --> 00:59:48,935
"Yamahoozie Polka," a.k.a.
"Kiss Me Polka"? "Polka Twist"?

703
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,631
These are songs?

704
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:53,763
Yeah. Yeah, we...
Some fairly big hits for us.

705
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,763
You know, in the early '80s.

706
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:58,808
Yeah, we sold about 623
copies of that.

707
00:59:59,026 --> 01:00:00,547
- In Chicago?
- No, Sheboygan.

708
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:02,374
Very big in Sheboygan.

709
01:00:02,635 --> 01:00:04,157
Did you say you could help?

710
01:00:04,331 --> 01:00:08,115
Anyway, I'm rambling on here.
Our flight was canceled...

711
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:12,681
...so we're gonna drive. See the guy
in the yellow jacket over there?

712
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,334
He's gonna rent us a nice big van
to drive to Milwaukee.

713
01:00:16,508 --> 01:00:19,813
Now, I heard you had some problems
getting to Chicago?

714
01:00:20,248 --> 01:00:21,596
To see your kid or something?

715
01:00:21,771 --> 01:00:25,641
Uh, my son. He...
We left, and he's there.

716
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:29,555
If you have to get to Chicago,
we'll gladly drive you.

717
01:00:29,686 --> 01:00:31,729
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

718
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,686
- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure, why not?

719
01:00:34,861 --> 01:00:36,427
You've got to get home.

720
01:00:36,644 --> 01:00:39,602
- A ride to Chicago?
- Sure, it's Christmastime.

721
01:00:40,298 --> 01:00:41,820
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

722
01:00:42,037 --> 01:00:44,212
You don't mind going with polka bums?

723
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:46,212
No, I'd love to.

724
01:01:08,653 --> 01:01:11,349
Hey, Marv. Marv, Marv!

725
01:01:11,523 --> 01:01:12,393
Look at this.

726
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:22,787
I think we're getting scammed
by a kindergartner.

727
01:01:53,186 --> 01:01:55,403
Dad, can you come here
and help me?

728
01:02:00,276 --> 01:02:02,493
Remember that kid
we saw the other day?

729
01:02:03,494 --> 01:02:04,972
He lives here.

730
01:02:05,277 --> 01:02:07,755
If the kid's here,
the parent's got to be.

731
01:02:08,408 --> 01:02:09,974
He's home alone.

732
01:02:17,976 --> 01:02:20,193
What? You want to come
back tonight?

733
01:02:20,412 --> 01:02:21,846
Even with the kid here?

734
01:02:22,063 --> 01:02:24,107
I don't think that's a good idea.

735
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:27,065
That house is the reason
we worked this block.

736
01:02:27,282 --> 01:02:29,631
Ever since I saw that house,
I wanted it.

737
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:31,893
Let's take it one step at a time.

738
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:36,763
We'll unload the van, get a bite
to eat, we'll come back about 9:00.

739
01:02:36,938 --> 01:02:38,198
Nine o'clock.

740
01:02:38,372 --> 01:02:39,764
This way it's dark then.

741
01:02:39,981 --> 01:02:42,981
Yeah, kids are scared of the dark.

742
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,939
You're afraid of the dark too.
You know you are.

743
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,765
No, I'm not.

744
01:02:48,984 --> 01:02:50,853
- Yes, you are.
- Not, not, not.

745
01:02:51,028 --> 01:02:52,159
You are so.

746
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:54,332
Mom, where are you?

747
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,337
Do you play?

748
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:14,382
Do you want to try? Go ahead,
try it. Try it!

749
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:44,259
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

750
01:03:45,782 --> 01:03:47,521
Hey, nice shoes.

751
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:49,347
Oh, thanks.

752
01:03:49,566 --> 01:03:53,174
Is he still here? It's really
important that I see him.

753
01:03:53,827 --> 01:03:57,349
He's getting in his car.
If you hurry, you can catch him.

754
01:03:58,698 --> 01:04:02,916
How low! Giving Kriss Kringle
a parking ticket on Christmas Eve!

755
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:05,743
What's next, rabies shots
for the Easter Bunny?

756
01:04:05,962 --> 01:04:07,440
Santa, hold on.

757
01:04:09,788 --> 01:04:11,788
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Quickly.

758
01:04:12,006 --> 01:04:13,658
Santa's running late.

759
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:16,311
I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

760
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:20,313
Huh, what makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

761
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:23,921
- I'm old enough to know how it works.
- All right.

762
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,183
But I also know you work for him.

763
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:29,359
- I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.

764
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:34,534
Kevin McCallister, 681 Lincoln Blvd.
Do you need the phone number?

765
01:04:34,926 --> 01:04:36,186
No, that's all right.

766
01:04:36,491 --> 01:04:38,274
This is extremely important.

767
01:04:38,448 --> 01:04:43,406
Please tell him instead of presents,
I just want my family back.

768
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:48,537
No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate,
Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff.

769
01:04:48,756 --> 01:04:50,755
And my aunt and my cousins.

770
01:04:50,973 --> 01:04:54,104
And if he has time,
my Uncle Frank. Okay?

771
01:04:55,801 --> 01:04:56,931
Okay.

772
01:04:57,889 --> 01:05:00,193
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

773
01:05:00,411 --> 01:05:04,846
Wait. My elf took the last of the
candy canes home to her boyfriend.

774
01:05:05,064 --> 01:05:06,978
- That's okay.
- No, don't be silly.

775
01:05:07,195 --> 01:05:10,065
Everybody who sees Santa
has got to get something.

776
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:14,414
Here, hold out your little paw there.
There you go.

777
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:17,198
- Don't spoil your dinner.
- I won't.

778
01:05:17,676 --> 01:05:19,024
Thanks.

779
01:05:30,245 --> 01:05:31,810
Son of a...!

780
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:30,596
Merry Christmas.

781
01:08:33,077 --> 01:08:34,337
May I sit down?

782
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:47,123
That's my granddaughter.

783
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:49,341
The little red-haired girl.

784
01:08:51,603 --> 01:08:54,387
She's about your age.
You know her?

785
01:08:54,648 --> 01:08:55,605
No.

786
01:08:55,822 --> 01:08:57,648
You live next to me, don't you?

787
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:02,606
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

788
01:09:03,693 --> 01:09:08,520
There's a lot of things going around
about me, but none of it's true. Okay?

789
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:11,565
- You've been good this year?
- I think so.

790
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:13,391
You swear to it?

791
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,999
No.

792
01:09:15,174 --> 01:09:19,827
Yeah. Well, this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.

793
01:09:20,176 --> 01:09:22,828
- It is?
- I think so.

794
01:09:23,047 --> 01:09:25,612
- Are you feeling bad about yourself?
- No.

795
01:09:30,049 --> 01:09:32,136
I've been kind of a pain lately.

796
01:09:32,614 --> 01:09:35,049
I said some things I shouldn't have.

797
01:09:35,268 --> 01:09:38,007
I really haven't been
too good this year.

798
01:09:38,659 --> 01:09:39,615
Yeah.

799
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:43,051
I'm kind of upset
because I really like my family.

800
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:48,183
Even though sometimes I say I don't.
Sometimes I even think I don't.

801
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:51,271
- Do you get that?
- I think so.

802
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:53,967
How you feel about family
is a complicated thing.

803
01:09:54,794 --> 01:09:57,185
Especially with an older brother.

804
01:09:57,968 --> 01:10:00,273
Deep down, you'll always love him.

805
01:10:00,491 --> 01:10:04,840
But you can forget that you love him.
You can hurt them, they can hurt you.

806
01:10:05,014 --> 01:10:07,014
That's not just because you're young.

807
01:10:09,145 --> 01:10:11,841
You want to know the real
reason why I'm here?

808
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,277
Sure.

809
01:10:13,712 --> 01:10:15,755
I came to hear my granddaughter sing.

810
01:10:16,104 --> 01:10:17,669
I can't come hear her tonight.

811
01:10:18,148 --> 01:10:19,191
You have plans?

812
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:20,757
No.

813
01:10:21,714 --> 01:10:23,018
I'm not welcome.

814
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:25,019
At church?

815
01:10:25,236 --> 01:10:27,324
You're always welcome at church.

816
01:10:27,586 --> 01:10:29,585
I'm not welcome with my son.

817
01:10:31,108 --> 01:10:34,804
Years back, before you and your family
moved on the block...

818
01:10:35,588 --> 01:10:37,240
...I had an argument with my son.

819
01:10:38,066 --> 01:10:39,197
How old is he?

820
01:10:39,414 --> 01:10:40,936
He's grown up.

821
01:10:42,372 --> 01:10:47,024
We lost our tempers, and I said
I didn't care to see him anymore.

822
01:10:47,547 --> 01:10:51,852
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

823
01:10:52,983 --> 01:10:55,288
If you miss him,
why don't you call him?

824
01:10:55,854 --> 01:10:58,029
I'm afraid if I call,
he won't talk to me.

825
01:10:58,246 --> 01:10:59,768
How do you know?

826
01:11:00,768 --> 01:11:02,160
I don't know.

827
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:03,552
I'm just afraid.

828
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,291
No offense, but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

829
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,771
You can be old for a lot of things.

830
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:13,772
- You're never too old to be afraid.
- That's true.

831
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,903
I was afraid of our basement.

832
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,381
It's dark. There's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.

833
01:11:19,599 --> 01:11:23,208
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

834
01:11:23,426 --> 01:11:24,731
Basements are like that.

835
01:11:25,992 --> 01:11:28,427
I made myself go down
to do some laundry...

836
01:11:28,602 --> 01:11:30,732
...and I found out it's not so bad.

837
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:35,603
I worried about it, but if you
turn on the lights, it's no big deal.

838
01:11:35,951 --> 01:11:36,908
What's your point?

839
01:11:37,343 --> 01:11:40,126
My point is,
you should call your son.

840
01:11:41,084 --> 01:11:43,824
- What if he won't talk to me?
- At least you'll know.

841
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:48,433
Then you could stop worrying about it.
You won't have to be afraid anymore.

842
01:11:49,216 --> 01:11:54,130
No matter how mad I was, I'd talk to
Dad. Especially around the holidays.

843
01:11:55,913 --> 01:11:57,435
I don't know.

844
01:11:57,697 --> 01:11:58,783
Just give it a shot.

845
01:11:59,002 --> 01:12:00,610
For your granddaughter anyway.

846
01:12:00,828 --> 01:12:04,089
I'm sure she misses you.
And the presents.

847
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:06,046
I send her a check.

848
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:08,569
I wish my grandparents did that.

849
01:12:08,786 --> 01:12:10,264
They always send me clothes.

850
01:12:10,483 --> 01:12:13,440
Last year I got a sweater
with a bird knitted on it.

851
01:12:13,657 --> 01:12:14,658
Oh, that's nice.

852
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:16,962
Not for a guy in the second grade.

853
01:12:17,224 --> 01:12:19,832
You can get beat up for wearing
something like that.

854
01:12:21,181 --> 01:12:23,224
I have a friend who got nailed...

855
01:12:23,443 --> 01:12:26,356
...because there was a rumor
he wore dinosaur pajamas.

856
01:12:27,487 --> 01:12:29,661
You better run home where you belong.

857
01:12:30,531 --> 01:12:31,662
Think about what I said.

858
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:33,619
- All right?
- Okay.

859
01:12:34,446 --> 01:12:35,533
It's nice talking to you.

860
01:12:36,577 --> 01:12:38,229
Nice talking to you.

861
01:12:44,622 --> 01:12:46,839
- What about you?
- Me?

862
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:48,884
Yeah. You and your son.

863
01:12:50,841 --> 01:12:52,711
We'll see what happens.

864
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,364
Merry Christmas.

865
01:12:56,452 --> 01:12:58,365
Merry Christmas.

866
01:13:50,379 --> 01:13:53,945
This is my house.
I have to defend it.

867
01:15:21,882 --> 01:15:24,926
We'll check it out.
We can come back for the truck.

868
01:15:33,233 --> 01:15:34,537
How do you want to go in?

869
01:15:35,016 --> 01:15:37,973
We'll go to the back door.
Maybe he'll let us in.

870
01:15:38,191 --> 01:15:41,582
Yeah, he's a kid. Kids are stupid.

871
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:47,584
Bless this nutritious, microwaveable
macaroni and cheese dinner...

872
01:15:47,845 --> 01:15:50,454
...and the people who sold
it on sale.

873
01:16:15,636 --> 01:16:18,419
This is it. Don't get scared now.

874
01:16:31,509 --> 01:16:34,162
Merry Christmas, little fella.

875
01:16:35,076 --> 01:16:39,858
We know that you're in there,
and that you're all alone.

876
01:16:40,337 --> 01:16:42,554
Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.

877
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,165
It's Santy Claus and his elf.

878
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:50,253
We're not gonna hurt you.

879
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:53,950
No, no. Got some nice
presents for you.

880
01:16:54,298 --> 01:16:57,906
Be a good little fella now
and open the door.

881
01:17:02,691 --> 01:17:03,865
What?

882
01:17:05,692 --> 01:17:07,649
What? What?

883
01:17:08,563 --> 01:17:09,476
What?

884
01:17:09,606 --> 01:17:11,911
- What happened?
- Get that little...

885
01:17:23,654 --> 01:17:25,044
Hello.

886
01:17:30,786 --> 01:17:33,090
Yes! Yes!

887
01:17:33,308 --> 01:17:34,874
The little jerk is armed!

888
01:17:35,048 --> 01:17:39,266
That's it! I'm going in the front.
You go down the basement!

889
01:20:12,003 --> 01:20:16,743
Oh, boy. That's it, you little...
You little...

890
01:20:17,657 --> 01:20:19,788
No, not this time, you little brat.

891
01:20:23,224 --> 01:20:26,093
You little creep, where are you?

892
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:51,405
Yes!

893
01:21:25,153 --> 01:21:26,805
- Rip his head off...!

894
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:38,331
You're dead, kid.

895
01:22:25,648 --> 01:22:28,431
Where are you, you little creep?!

896
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:47,436
Harry, I'm coming in!

897
01:22:52,003 --> 01:22:54,134
Oh, no! I'm really scared.

898
01:22:54,351 --> 01:22:58,221
It's too late for you, kid, we're
in the house. We're gonna get you.

899
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:00,526
Okay, come and get me!

900
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:01,918
Why, you...!

901
01:23:08,529 --> 01:23:09,790
Now you're dead!

902
01:23:35,492 --> 01:23:38,058
I'm gonna kill that kid!

903
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:57,325
Why'd you take your shoes off?

904
01:23:57,890 --> 01:23:59,586
Why are you dressed like a chicken?

905
01:24:01,543 --> 01:24:03,151
I'm up here, you morons.

906
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,979
Come and get me.

907
01:24:08,371 --> 01:24:11,676
You guys give up, or are you
thirsty for more?

908
01:24:21,505 --> 01:24:22,853
Heads up!

909
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:28,463
Don't worry, Marv.
I'll get him for you.

910
01:24:32,552 --> 01:24:33,551
Yes!

911
01:24:38,814 --> 01:24:41,118
He's only a kid, Harry.
We can take him.

912
01:24:41,293 --> 01:24:44,380
Ah, shut up, will you?
What is it?

913
01:24:44,598 --> 01:24:46,772
You're missing some teeth.

914
01:24:46,946 --> 01:24:49,033
Where? It's my gold tooth.

915
01:24:49,295 --> 01:24:52,295
My gold tooth. I'll kill him.
I'll kill him!

916
01:24:54,687 --> 01:24:56,862
You bomb me with
one more can, kid...

917
01:24:57,037 --> 01:25:01,298
<i>...and I'll snap off your cojones
and boil them in motor oil!</i>

918
01:25:04,647 --> 01:25:05,733
<i>911 emergency.</i>

919
01:25:05,996 --> 01:25:07,821
Hello, my house is being robbed.

920
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:12,735
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name is Murphy.

921
01:25:16,302 --> 01:25:17,650
You never know what's up there.

922
01:25:18,824 --> 01:25:19,650
There he is!

923
01:25:25,305 --> 01:25:27,044
I got you! I got him, Harry.

924
01:25:28,827 --> 01:25:30,088
I got him.

925
01:25:31,307 --> 01:25:32,524
Harry, give me a hand!

926
01:25:35,873 --> 01:25:36,786
I got him!

927
01:25:38,004 --> 01:25:39,396
Harry, help me. Get up!

928
01:25:40,961 --> 01:25:42,178
I got him.

929
01:26:21,972 --> 01:26:23,059
What are you doing?

930
01:26:23,885 --> 01:26:26,581
Harry, don't move.

931
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:30,495
Don't move.

932
01:26:30,931 --> 01:26:32,496
Marv, what are you doing?

933
01:26:37,237 --> 01:26:38,236
Did I get him?

934
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:40,760
Did I get him?!

935
01:26:41,151 --> 01:26:43,195
Where is it? Where is it?

936
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:47,065
Never mind that. Here!
How do you like it, huh? You jerk!

937
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,979
Get that kid, before l...
Get that kid!

938
01:27:16,726 --> 01:27:18,030
Where'd he go?

939
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:20,770
Maybe he committed suicide.

940
01:27:21,206 --> 01:27:26,076
Down here, you big horse's ass!
Come get me before I call the police.

941
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,207
- Let's get him!
- Wait, wait.

942
01:27:28,468 --> 01:27:30,294
It's just what he wants us to do:

943
01:27:30,512 --> 01:27:33,643
Go back through his fun house
so we get all tore up.

944
01:27:33,861 --> 01:27:35,339
He's gonna call the cops!

945
01:27:35,557 --> 01:27:37,252
From a tree house?!

946
01:27:37,514 --> 01:27:38,645
Come on.

947
01:27:39,863 --> 01:27:41,253
Out the window?

948
01:27:41,732 --> 01:27:43,080
I'm not going out the window.

949
01:27:43,299 --> 01:27:47,212
Why, you scared? Are you afraid?
Come on, get out here.

950
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:53,387
Come on.

951
01:27:59,434 --> 01:28:00,912
Come on!

952
01:28:06,826 --> 01:28:09,739
- Come on. Keep going.
- Let's go back, Harry.

953
01:28:15,393 --> 01:28:16,480
Shut it, Marv.

954
01:28:20,091 --> 01:28:20,960
Hey, guys!

955
01:28:21,613 --> 01:28:22,830
Check this out.

956
01:28:23,961 --> 01:28:25,700
Go back. Go back.

957
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,062
There he is!

958
01:29:15,671 --> 01:29:17,846
Hey, I'm calling the cops!

959
01:29:19,106 --> 01:29:21,585
Wait, wait!
He wants us to follow him.

960
01:29:21,759 --> 01:29:23,759
I got a better idea. Come on.

961
01:29:41,722 --> 01:29:43,026
Hiya, pal.

962
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:46,636
We outsmarted you this time.
Get over here!

963
01:29:52,594 --> 01:29:54,072
What are you gonna do, Harry?

964
01:29:54,464 --> 01:29:56,464
I'll do exactly what he did to us.

965
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:58,508
Burn his head with a blowtorch.

966
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,769
I'll smash his face with an iron.

967
01:30:00,987 --> 01:30:03,813
I'd like to slap him
in the face with a paint can!

968
01:30:04,032 --> 01:30:05,598
Shove a nail through his foot!

969
01:30:05,815 --> 01:30:10,773
I'm gonna bite off every one of
these little fingers, one at a time.

970
01:30:20,036 --> 01:30:22,427
Come on. Let's get you home.

971
01:30:45,347 --> 01:30:48,087
Wow! This is great.

972
01:30:51,436 --> 01:30:53,827
Nice move,
leaving the water running.

973
01:30:54,002 --> 01:30:57,786
Now we know each and every house
that you've hit.

974
01:31:01,264 --> 01:31:04,048
We've been looking for you guys
for a long time.

975
01:31:04,265 --> 01:31:07,135
Yeah. Well, remember,
we're the "Wet Bandits."

976
01:31:07,353 --> 01:31:11,354
- Wet Bandits, that's W-E-T...
- Shut up! Get in the car!

977
01:31:11,571 --> 01:31:13,310
Hey, come on. Come on.

978
01:31:13,963 --> 01:31:16,441
- Hand off the head, pal!
- Come on.

979
01:32:12,023 --> 01:32:14,066
<i>I'm a bad parent. I'm a bad parent.</i>

980
01:32:14,327 --> 01:32:15,414
No, you're not.

981
01:32:15,633 --> 01:32:18,285
You're beating yourself up there.
This happens.

982
01:32:18,502 --> 01:32:20,154
These things happen, you know.

983
01:32:20,373 --> 01:32:24,069
You want to talk about bad parents?
Look at us.

984
01:32:24,287 --> 01:32:29,027
We're on the road 48, 49 weeks a year.
We hardly see our families.

985
01:32:29,723 --> 01:32:32,028
Joe, over there. Gosh, you know...

986
01:32:32,201 --> 01:32:35,071
...he forgets his kids' names
half the time.

987
01:32:35,246 --> 01:32:38,637
Ziggy over there,
he's never even met his kid.

988
01:32:38,856 --> 01:32:42,682
Eddy... Let's just hope
none of them write a book about him.

989
01:32:43,857 --> 01:32:47,380
Tell me, have you gone on vacation
and left your child home?

990
01:32:50,772 --> 01:32:52,120
No.

991
01:32:52,904 --> 01:32:55,817
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

992
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:59,905
Yeah, it was terrible too.
I was all distraught and everything.

993
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:04,340
The wife and I, we left the little
tyke there in the funeral parlor.

994
01:33:04,558 --> 01:33:08,255
All day. You know, we went
back at night, when we...

995
01:33:08,472 --> 01:33:10,689
...came to our senses,
there he was.

996
01:33:10,864 --> 01:33:14,039
Apparently, he was there
all day with a corpse.

997
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:18,388
Now, he was okay.
You know, after six, seven weeks.

998
01:33:18,605 --> 01:33:21,084
He came around
and started talking again.

999
01:33:22,433 --> 01:33:25,432
They get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

1000
01:33:25,651 --> 01:33:27,347
We shouldn't talk about this.

1001
01:33:27,564 --> 01:33:29,434
I was just trying to cheer you up.

1002
01:33:29,652 --> 01:33:31,783
I'm sorry I did.

1003
01:33:58,007 --> 01:33:59,137
Mom?

1004
01:34:04,357 --> 01:34:05,574
Mom?

1005
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,328
Kevin!

1006
01:35:33,338 --> 01:35:35,381
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1007
01:35:44,645 --> 01:35:47,254
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

1008
01:36:07,086 --> 01:36:08,955
Where's everybody else?

1009
01:36:09,695 --> 01:36:11,695
Oh, baby, they couldn't come.

1010
01:36:11,913 --> 01:36:13,087
They wanted to so much...

1011
01:36:13,349 --> 01:36:17,784
I didn't fall asleep in the back
and drool all over you, did I?

1012
01:36:18,001 --> 01:36:20,306
- You do drool!
- Shut up!

1013
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:26,308
Kevin, my boy. How are you?

1014
01:36:27,048 --> 01:36:28,743
You're all right.

1015
01:36:29,222 --> 01:36:30,439
I love you. You okay?

1016
01:36:35,354 --> 01:36:37,962
It's cool that you didn't
burn the place down.

1017
01:36:40,529 --> 01:36:42,095
Thanks, Buzz.

1018
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:45,747
Wait a minute.
How'd you guys get home?

1019
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:48,532
On the morning flight you didn't
want to wait for.

1020
01:36:48,749 --> 01:36:51,924
- Oh, no. Oh! Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

1021
01:36:52,185 --> 01:36:53,619
Merry Christmas.

1022
01:36:54,186 --> 01:36:56,316
Someone has to find an open store.

1023
01:36:56,534 --> 01:36:58,142
I went shopping yesterday.

1024
01:37:00,753 --> 01:37:02,361
You, shopping?

1025
01:37:02,578 --> 01:37:05,362
I got some milk, eggs
and fabric softener.

1026
01:37:07,232 --> 01:37:09,102
- What?
- No kidding?

1027
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,103
What a funny guy.

1028
01:37:11,277 --> 01:37:13,452
What else did you do
while we were away?

1029
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,800
Just hung around.

1030
01:37:18,888 --> 01:37:20,322
Bring your stuff upstairs.

1031
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:25,019
He went shopping? He doesn't know how
to tie his shoe. He's going shopping?

1032
01:37:51,897 --> 01:37:53,462
Honey, what's this?

1033
01:38:51,870 --> 01:38:55,261
Kevin! What did you do
to my room?

1034
01:38:57,906 --> 01:39:26,685
