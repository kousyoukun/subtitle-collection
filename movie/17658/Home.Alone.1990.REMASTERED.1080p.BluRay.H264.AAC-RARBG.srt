46
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,070

-  Where's the shampoo? -  I don't live here.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,450
这房子里有这么多人住居然连瓶洗发精都没有
This many people here and no shampoo.

48
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,790

Excuse me. Are your parents here?

51
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,540
我父母住在巴黎

这是孤儿院还是什么地方
Probably a fancy orphanage.

57
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,060
我不知道怎么收拾行李 我这一辈子还从来没有收拾过行李呢
I don't know how to pack a suitcase. I've never done it once.

58
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,390
- 厉害啊 - 梅根也是这么说的

-  What did I say? -  You told him, "Tough."

60
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,650
这家伙嘀咕行李半天了 我能说什么?
The dope was whining about a suitcase. What was I supposed to say?

61
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,530
恭喜他 恭喜他是白痴吗?
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

62
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,280
- 我才不是白痴! - 是吗?
-  I'm not an idiot! -  Really?

63
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,570
你根本不会照顾自己! 什么事都要别人帮你做
You're helpless! We have to do everything for you.

还不会收拾行李呢
I don't know how to pack.

66
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,370
- 希望你别放乱七八糟的东西在行李里 - 闭嘴 琳妮
-  I hope you didn't just pack crap. -  Shut up, Linnie.

67
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,260
那我应该带什么东西
Do you know what I should pack?

68
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,650
巴兹叫你多带些卫生纸和水
Buzz told you, cheek- face. Toilet paper and water.

69
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,630
你干嘛这么担心?
What are you so worried about?

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,430
你知道 不管怎么样 妈会帮你收拾东西的
You know Mom's gonna pack your stuff, anyway.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,760
你就是法语中说的那种"无能之辈"
You're what the French call les incompetents.

72
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,010

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,850
投弹啦! 躲开!
Bombs away!

74
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,820
看来你得和富勒睡一张沙发床了
P.S. You have to sleep on the hide- a- bed with Fuller.

75
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,150
他睡前只要喝点东西就会尿床
If he has something to drink, he'll wet the bed.

76
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,700
这房子里这么多人 真烦死人了!
This house is so full of people it makes me sick!

77
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,660
等我长大了就结婚 我要自己一个人住!
When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone!

78
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,810
听见没有? 我要自己住!

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,540
我要自己住!
I'm living alone!

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,300
谁来喂你的蜘蛛啊?
Who's gonna feed your spider?

81
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,800
他刚刚吃了很多老鼠内脏 应该能顶几个星期
He just ate a load of mice guts. He'll be good for a couple weeks.

82
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,430
法国妞是不是真的不刮腋毛?
Is it true French babes don't shave their pits?

83
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,140
有些妞是不刮
Some don't.

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,180
法国有裸体海滩
But they got nude beaches.

85
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,600
冬季没有
Not in the winter.

86
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,490
巴兹?
Buzz?

87
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,780
你不会敲门啊? 浑蛋
Don't you know how to knock, phlegm- wad?

88
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,410
我在你的房里睡觉好吗? 我不要和富勒一起睡
Can I sleep here? I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

89
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,450
他喝点水就尿床
If he drinks, he'll wet the bed.

90
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,250
就算你长在我的屁股上 我也不会让你睡在我的房间里
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you were growing on my ass.

91
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,670
看外面 是老家伙马利
Check it out. Old man Marley.

92
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
他是谁?
Who's he?

93
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,970
听说过南弯雪锹杀手吗?
You ever heard of the South Bend Shovel Slayer?

94
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,110
- 没有 - 就是他
-  No. -  That's him.

95
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,100
在1958年 他用铲雪锹把他家人和半数以上的邻居...
In '58 he murdered his whole family and half the people on his block...

96
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,230
打死了
...with a snow shovel.

97
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,740
自从那次事件以后 他就一直隐居在这里
Been hiding out in this neighborhood ever since.

98
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,490
他是杀人犯 警察干嘛不抓他?
If he's the shovel slayer, how come the cops don't arrest him?

99
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,450
证据不足 无法定罪
Not enough evidence to convict.

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,200
警察从没有找到过尸体
They never found the bodies.

101
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,500
可是这里每个人都知道 是他干的
Everyone around here knows he did it.

102
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,960
我看他还会杀人
It'll just be a matter of time...

103
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,210
只不过是迟早的问题
...before he does it again.

104
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,090
那他现在干嘛?
What's he doing now?

105
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,210
他每天夜里都在街上...
He walks up and down the streets every night...

106
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,720
走来走去
...salting the sidewalks.

107
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,890
他也许是在做好事吧
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

108
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,310
不可能
No way.

109
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,390
看那垃圾桶是不是装满了盐?
See that garbage can full of salt?

110
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,850
被杀了的人就放在那里面
That's where he keeps his victims.

111
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,860
然后盐就把尸体
The salt turns the bodies...

112
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,900
变成了木乃伊
...into mummies.

113
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,900
木乃伊
Mummies!

114
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,700
别让他看见!
Look out!

115
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,590
小尼罗披萨二十分钟内送达 不然免费!

116
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,170
小朋友你们好吗? 很好吧?
How you kids doing? Good?

117
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,780
今天这儿有好多玩的 对不对?
Lot of action around here today, huh?

118
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,580

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,150
听到我说的吗? 要去旅行吗?
You hear me, or what? Going on a trip?

121
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,210
你们去哪啊孩子?
Where you going, kid?

122
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,470
一共是122块半
Okay, that's $122.50.

123
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,970
这不是我叫的 小子 我不住这
Not from me, kid. I don't live here.

124
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,220
你是来过节的吧?
You just around for the holidays?

125
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,730
算是吧
You could say that.

126
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,480
- 披萨送来了! - 是的
-  Pizza's here! -  There you go.

127
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,650
一共122块半
That's $122.50.

128
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
这是我弟弟的家 他会给你钱的
It's my brother's house. He'll get it.

129
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,240
哎 听我说...
Hey, listen....

130
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,030
- 嘿 - 嘿

-  Are you Mr. McCallister? -  Yeah.

132
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,490
是住这的麦卡利斯特先生吗?
The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

133
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,160
好 披萨一共122块半
Good, because somebody owes me $122.50.

- 我想跟你谈谈 - 要抓我还是怎样?
-  I'd like a word with you, sir. -  Am I under arrest or something?

135
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,090
一般入室抢劫多在节日期间发生
No, no, no. There's always a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

136
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,540
所以我们要对周围进行检查
We're checking the neighborhood

137
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,300
看看大家是不是采取了适当的防范措施
to see if the proper precautions are taken.

138
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,550
我们有装自动照明计时器 每个门也都装有门锁
We have automatic timers for our lights, locks for our doors.

139
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
这些都是每户人家可以做得到的
That's about as well as anybody can do.

140
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,020
- 你喝了蛋酒之类的东西吗? - 走吧
-  Did you get some eggnog? -  Come on.

141
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,640
- 吃东西去 - 快点
-  Let's eat. -  Come on.

142
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,850
- 蛋酒? - 吃披萨啦
-  Eggnog? -  Pizza!

143
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,400
- 你是要走了吗? - 吃披萨啦!
-  Are you gonna be leaving... ? -  Pizza!

144
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,360
自己拿餐巾纸 自己倒饮料啊
Grab a napkin and pour your own drinks.

145
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,280
- 圣诞老人也要过海关检查吗? - 我们几点要上床睡觉?
-  Does Santa go through customs? -  What time do we have to go to bed?

146
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,320
要早点睡 明早8点出发
Early. We're leaving at 8 a.m. on the button.

147
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,290
喝牛奶啊 走之前我们要喝完所有的牛奶
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want to get rid of it.

148
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,080
- 卖披萨的要122块半加小费 - 光是披萨?
-  Pizza boy needs $122.50, plus tip. -  For pizza?

149
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,040
十个乘12块
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

150
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,670
- 你身上有带钱 - 我带的是旅行支票
-  You've got money. -  Traveler's checks.

151
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,970
算了 法兰克 我们有现金
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.

152
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,340
你的那种旅行支票 在法国可能不能用
You probably got the checks that don't work in France.

153
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,470
有起司披萨吗?
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

154
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,810
有 不过你要是要的话...
Yeah. But if you want any...

155
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,310
等人家吐出来吧 因为已经没有了
...somebody's gonna have to barf it up because it's gone.

156
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,400
富勒 慢慢来 别猛灌
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

157
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,200
凯文 快拿个盘子来接着!
Kev! Kev, get a plate.

158
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,000
- 护照! - 小心点!
-  Passports! -  Watch it!

159
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,930
快把护照拿走
No, no. Get these passports out of here.

160
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,520
你没事吧? 快过来 你没事吧?
Are you okay, honey? Come here. Are you all right?

161
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,270
你发什么神经啊你?
What is the matter?

162
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,230
是他先惹我的 他故意吃了我的披萨
He started it! He ate my pizza on purpose.

163
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,480
他知道我讨厌香肠和橄榄口味...
He knows I hate sausage and olives...

164
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,150
看你干的好事! 你这个小浑蛋!
Look what you did, you little jerk!

165
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,080
给我上楼
Get upstairs now.

166
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,290
为什么?
Why?

167
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,170
你真是个衰鬼
You're such a disease.

168
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,760
- 闭上你的嘴巴 - 凯文 上楼去!
-  Shut up! -  Kevin, upstairs!

169
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,130
- 说晚安 凯文 - 晚安 凯文
-  Say good night, Kevin. -  "Good night, Kevin."

170
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,970
为什么我待遇这么差
Why do I get treated like scum?

171
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,770
对不起 家里乱糟糟的
I'm sorry. This house is just crazy.

172
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,230
家里又多了些孩子
We've got all these extra kids running around.

173
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,610
我哥哥也从俄亥俄州过来了 真是乱上加乱
My brother's in from Ohio. It's nuts.

174
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,230
怎么不多送些起司披萨来?
How come you didn't bring more cheese pizzas?

175
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,490
- 这么多小费 - 谢谢
-  Nice tip. Thanks. -  Thanks.

176
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,900
亲朋好友都来过节啦?
Having a reunion?

177
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,410
我先生的哥哥被调到巴黎工作 孩子们还留在这里上学
My husband's brother transferred to Paris. His kids are still here.

178
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,290
他想他家人了 所以叫我们全都去巴黎过节
He missed the family, so he invited us to Paris...

179
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,660
我们就可以全在一起了
...so we'll be together.

180
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,590
- 你们要去巴黎吗? - 是的 明天就动身
-  You're taking a trip to Paris? -  Yes, we leave tomorrow morning.

181
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,830
太好了 真是太好了
Excellent. Excellent.

182
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,090
真是抱歉 这孩子闹别扭
If you'll excuse me, this one's a little out of sorts.

183
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,010
不用招呼我 我今天已经跟你丈夫聊过了
Don't worry about me. I spoke to your husband.

184
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,050
也不用担心你家了 有我们呢
And don't worry about your home. It's in good hands.

185
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,100
这房子里有15个人 就是你老惹麻烦
Fifteen people in this house, and only you have to make trouble.

186
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,690
我是个受气包
I'm getting dumped on.

187
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,690
你是个淘气包 好了 上楼去吧
You're the only one acting up. Now get upstairs.

188
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,230
我不是已经在楼上了吗 白痴
I am upstairs, dummy!

189
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,610
还上三楼呀?
The third floor?

190
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,990
- 上去吧 - 上面太恐怖了
-  Go. -  It's scary up there.

191
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,070
富勒马上就会上去的
Fuller'll be up in a while.

192
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,330
我不要和他一起睡 他尿床
I don't want to sleep with Fuller. He wets the bed.

193
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,750
他会把我浇湿 我知道他会
He'll pee all over me. I know it.

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,750
我让他睡别的地方
We'll put him somewhere else.

195
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,380
对不起
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,000
时间不早了 快上楼睡吧
It's too late. Get upstairs.

197
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,090
家里的每个人都讨厌我!
Everyone in this family hates me!

198
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,470
那你应该叫圣诞老人帮你换个新家
Then ask Santa for a new family.

199
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,140
我才不要什么新家呢! 我什么家都不要! 家太让人讨厌了
I don't want a new family. I don't want any family. Families suck!

200
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,480
就待在上面吧! 今天晚上我再也不要看见你了
Stay up there. I don't want to see you again tonight.

201
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,190
我以后一辈子也不想再看见你了
I don't want to see you for the rest of my life.

202
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,860
还有其他人我也都不想再看到
I don't want to see anybody else either.

203
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,070
你最好不是认真的
I hope you don't mean that.

204
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,160
要是明天早上醒来家没了 你会伤心的
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up and didn't have a family.

205
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,370
不 我才不会
No, I wouldn't.

206
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,160
那你再讲一次啊 说不定真会发生呢
Then say it again. Maybe it'll happen.

207
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,580
我想永远再也不要看见你们这些讨厌鬼!
I hope I never see any of you jerks again!

208
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,440
我希望他们全都消失
I wish they would all just disappear.

209
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,660
- 人在哪? - 谁知道? 她说了8点整的
-  Where are they? -  I don't know. She said 8 sharp.

210
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,590
彼得!
Peter!

211
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,470
- 睡过头了! - 睡过头了!
-  We slept in! -  We slept in!

212
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,200
嗨 我是米奇·墨菲 住在对面
Hi, I'm Mitch Murphy. I live across the street.

213
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,200
你们要出远门吗?
You guys going out of town?

214
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,780
我们要去佛罗里达
We're going to Florida.

215
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,620
其实我们得先去密苏里接我奶奶
Well, first we're going to Missouri to pick up my grandma.

216
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,330
麦卡利斯特先生全家是要去法国
You know the McCallisters are going to France?

217
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,920
那里冷吗?
Do you know if it's cold?

218
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,710
- 这些车费油吗? - 小子 不知道 闪开!
-  Do these vans get good mileage? -  Kid, I don't know. Hit the road!

219
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,640
先点一下人头 然后叫他们全上车
Do a head count. Get everyone in the vans.

220
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,050
护照和飞机票在哪里?
Where are the passports?

221
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,180
在微波炉里烘干
I put them in the microwave to dry.

222
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,190
这车能跑多快? 是自排的吗?
How fast does this go? Does it have automatic transmission?

223
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,190
有四轮驱动吗?
Does it have 4- wheel drive?

224
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,280
我说过了 小子 别烦我 快闪!
Look, I told you before, kid. Don't bother me. Now, beat it!

225
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,960
在车前面排好队!
Line up in front of the van.

226
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,880
排好了 别说话!
Line up and shut up!

227
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,880
安静点! 我要点人数了
Shut up! I gotta take a head count.

228

230
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,550

233
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,520
好了 一半人上那辆车 另一半上这辆车
Okay, half in this van, half in this one. Let's go.

234
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,480
旅途愉快! 从法国带点东西回来给我
Have a good trip. Bring me back something French.

235
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,030
我们绝对赶不上飞机了 剩下不到45分钟了
There's no way we'll make this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

236
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,490
多往好处想
Think positive!

237
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,620
想有什么用 还是实际点
You be positive. I'll be realistic.

238
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,390
你家的电线修好了
Ma'am. Ma'am. Excuse me, your power is fixed...

239
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,210
但是你家的电话线绕得乱七八糟的 要好几天才能整理好
...but the phones are a mess. It'll take a couple of days to fix.

"这房子里有15个人 就是你老惹麻烦"
There are 15 people, and you're the only one who has to make trouble.

294
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,060
"瞧你干的好事 你这个小浑蛋!"

老大说过 十分之一
A.C. said 10 percent.

311
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,870
可惜老大说的不算了
Too bad A.C. ain't in charge no more.

312
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,040
我边吃零食边看烂电影

-  I have a terrible feeling. -  About what?

328
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,270
好像有什么事我们没做
That we didn't do something.

329
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,780
你有这感觉是因为我们走得太急了
You feel that way because we left in a hurry.

330
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,260
- 我们该做的都做了 - 我关咖啡壶了吗?
-  We took care of everything. -  Did I turn off the coffee?

331
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,780
没有
No.

332
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,080
是我关的

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,290
锁了
Yeah.

335
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,000
车库门关了吗?
Did you close the garage?

336
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,090
这个我没关
That's it.

337
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,710
我把车库门忘了 就这一件事
I forgot to close the garage. That's it.

338
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,350
不 不是这件事
No, that's not it.

339
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,100
我们还会忘记什么事呢?
What else could we be forgetting?

340
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,060

The captain's doing all he can. Your phones are out of order.

345
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,160
我们怎么会这样呢? 怎么会忘记他了呢?
How could we do this? We forgot him.

346
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,660
我们没忘记他 就是没点对人数
We didn't forget him, we just miscounted.

347
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,210
我算是怎样的母亲啊?
What kind of mother am I?

348
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,880
你听了也许会好过点 我连我的眼镜都忘记带了
If it makes you feel any better, I forgot my reading glasses.

都是他们亲口跟我说的

351
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,390
真是天赐良机
It's almost too easy.

352
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,980

Check it out:

373
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,290
拿好你的铁橇

This is ridiculous. Only a wimp would be hiding under a bed.

390

402
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,830
家庭危机解救中心 我是鲍沙警官
Family Crisis Intervention, Sergeant Balzak.

403
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,920
我现在在巴黎 我儿子独自在家
I'm calling from Paris. I have a son who's home alone.

404
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,800
这孩子家里有没有酒鬼 对他使用过暴力?
Has the child been involved in violence with a drunk family member?

405
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,050
没有!
No!

406
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,840
他在家发生过意外吗?
Has he been involved in a household accident?

407
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,220
我不知道 希望他没有
I don't know. I hope not.

408
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,600
这孩子吃了有毒的东西 还是有什么硬东西卡在喉咙里了?
Has the child ingested any poison or is an object lodged in his throat?

409
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,310
就是他单独一人在家里! 我想请个人到我家里...
No, he's home alone! I'd like somebody to go over to the house...

410
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,320
看一下他有没有事!
...and see if he's all right.

411
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,030
你想让我们到你家去 就是看一下你的孩子?
You want us to go to your house, just to check on him.

412
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,320
没错!
Yes!

413
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,570
那我帮你转接到警察局
Let me connect you to the police.

414
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,240
刚刚就是他们把我转接到你这里的
They just transferred me.

415
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,580
- 罗丝? 神经质在2线 - 等等
-  Rose! Hyper on 2. -  Hang on.

00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:27,420
- 等一下 - 请等一下 别挂电话
-  Hold on, please. -  No, please don't hang up. Please!

417
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,500
谁打通了?
Any luck?

418
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,090
没有
No.

419
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,920
- 我们一个人也没找到 - 莱丝莉?
-  I couldn't get anybody. -  Leslie?

420
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,430
都是电话录音
Nothing but a bunch of answering machines.

421
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,560
谁来接电话吧! 快接电话!
Somebody pick up. Pick up!

422
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,770
嗨 女士 又是你
Oh, hi, ma'am. It's you again.

423
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:47,890
我现在在巴黎 我儿子现在独自在家
I'm calling from Paris. I have a son who's home alone, and I...

424
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,900
我们派一个警官到你家去看一下你儿子吧
We'll send a policeman over to your house to check on your son.

425
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,850
家里没有人 房子看起来很安全
There's no one home. The house looks secure.

426
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,140
让他们再数数孩子
Tell them to count their kids again.

427
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,650
你不能换掉一个乘客或者...
You can't bump somebody or ask or... ?

428
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,690
我真的不能那么做
There's no way I can do that.

429
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,980
你能不能问问看?
Isn't there a way if you ask somebody?

430
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,690
这是一件紧急事件...
If you said it's an emergency...

431
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,150
可是我不能要求别人
I cannot ask them.

432
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,700
他们要派警官到家里
A policeman's going over to the house.

433
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,830
很好 可是机位全都满了
Well, that's a relief. Everything here is booked.

434
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,080
没有去芝加哥的航班了吗?
Nothing to Chicago?

435
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,500
芝加哥 纽约 那什维尔都满了
There's nothing to Chicago, New York, Nashville.

436
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,000
- 私人飞机呢? - 对不起 我们没有这个业务
-  What about a private plane? -  Sorry. We don't do that.

437
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,130
他们现在能做的就是 为我们订星期五早上的机位
The only thing is a booking for us on Friday morning.

438
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,840
星期五? 还有两天
Friday morn... That's two days away.

439
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,350
孩子们都累了 你也累坏了
The kids are exhausted and so are you.

440
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,760
我们待在机场实在没有什么事能做了
There's nothing we can do.

441
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,970
我们先去罗伯家 在那里我们再给警察局打电话
I say we go over to Rob's, and that way we can call the police again.

442
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,480
我不会离开机场的 除非坐上飞机
I'm not leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

443
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,770
夫人 我们就是要尽一切可能帮助乘客
Madame, we are doing everything we can.

444
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,980
如果你留在机场候补 或许能碰上空位
If you want to stay at the airport, maybe we can get you on standby.

445
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,110
是有这种可能的
It is a possibility that a seat will open up.

446
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,660
- 这下行了吧 - 好吧 我等着
-  Is that okay? -  Yes. I'll wait.

447
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,620
- 我会想你的 - 再见
-  Bye. I'll miss you, honey. -  Bye.

448
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,380
别把你自己搞丢了
Don't you get lost.

449
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,130
拜拜
Goodbye.

450
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,990
洗澡 擦香皂 全身上下都洗洗
I took a shower, washing every body part with actual soap.

451
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,110
手指缝...
Including all my major crevices...

452
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,740
脚指缝 还有肚脐
...between my toes and in my belly button...

453
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,410
虽然从来没洗过 不过感觉还不错
...which I never did before but enjoyed.

454
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:13,000
像大人那样用洗发精还有润发乳洗头
I washed my hair with adult formula shampoo and used cream rinse.

455
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,250
好像没有牙刷了 一会儿出去买一枝
I can't find my toothbrush, so I'll pick one up today.

456
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,590
没什么事了 还满像样子的嘛
Other than that, I'm in good shape.

457
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,480
好耶! 巴兹存的零用钱
All right! Buzz's life savings.

458
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,920
我还以为墨菲全家都去佛罗里达了
I thought the Murphys went to Florida.

459
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,230
你可真是天下名偷
You're one of the great cat burglars of the world.

460
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,110
你能不能小声一点?
You think you can keep it down a little in there?

461
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,530
家中无人 有事请留话
You've reached the Murphys. Please leave a message after the beep.

462
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,290
我是彼得·麦卡利斯特 现在在我哥巴黎的公寓里
This is Peter McCallister again. We're in Paris at my brother's.

463
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,960
我现在把这里的电话号码留给你 国码是33
Let me give you the number here. The country code is 33.

464
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:23,130
区码是14 电话号码是694876
The area code is 14 and the number is 694- 876...

465
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,340
- 嘿 哈利! - 干嘛?
-  Hey, Harry. -  Yeah?

466
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,430
昨晚我们去的那家 是彼得的家吗?
That house we ran last night, was that the McCallister's?

467
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,090
是啊
Yeah.

468
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,760
- 打电话到巴黎给我 - 你说的对 他们早走了
-  Call me in Paris. -  You're right. They're gone.

469
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,730
- 我就知道他们不在 - 今晚搞定那个金库
-  I knew they were. -  Silver tuna tonight.

470
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,200
能帮你什么吗?
How may I help you?

471
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,160
这种牙刷是不是美国牙医协会认可的?
Is this toothbrush approved by the American Dental Association?

472
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,500
不知道
Well, I don't know.

473
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,000
- 上面没有说明 - 请你查一下好吗?
-  It doesn't say, hon. -  Can you please find out?

474
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,880
- 贺伯! - 什么事?

475
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,340
我这里有人对牙刷有疑问
I got a question here about a toothbrush.

476
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,440
你知不知道这种牙刷有没有经过牙医协会认可?
Do you know, is this brush approved by the American Dental Association?

477
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,770
不知道
I don't know.

478
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,670
到这来付钱
Oh, hon, you pay for that here.

479
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,630
等一下 你得付钱
Wait, you have to pay for that.

480
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,470
孩子 孩子
Son! Son! Hey!

481
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,390

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,090
回来
Come here.

489
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,130
我是罪犯
I'm a criminal.

490
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,160
有什么好笑的?
What's so funny?

491
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,240
笑什么?
What's so funny?

492
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,870
你笑什么啊?
Why are you laughing?

493
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,370
又犯老毛病了吧?
You did it again.

494
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,250
又没关水了对吧?
You left the water running.

495
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,590
你这是什么毛病? 我早跟你说过不要这样
Why do you do that? I told you not to do it.

496
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,170
- 这叫雁过留声人过留名 - 雁过留声人过留名
-  It's our calling card. -  Calling card.

497
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,510
天下所有的大盗都要留下他们的标记
All the great ones leave their mark.

498
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,340
我们就是"水盗"
We're the Wet Bandits.

499
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,300
你有病你知不知道? 真的有病
You're sick, you know? You're really sick.

500
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,970
- 我没病 - 你有
-  I'm not sick. -  Yes, you are.

501
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,390
这么搞就是有病
It's a sick thing to do.

502
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,030
- 不许再这么搞了! - 不要教我怎么搞
-  We don't need that. -  Don't tell me...

503
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,110
我爱怎么搞就怎么搞
I can do it if I want to.

504
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,490
我没有病! 小心点!
It's not sick. Hey, watch out!

505
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,120
嘿! 嘿!
Hey! Hey!

506
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,290
走路得小心
You gotta watch out for traffic.

507
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,590
- 对不起 - 气死人
-  Sorry. -  Damn.

508
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,170
圣诞老人可不去殡仪馆送礼物
Santy don't visit the funeral homes, buddy.

509
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,430
好了 好了
Okay, okay.

510
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,390
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

511
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,900
你怎么了?
What's the matter?

512
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,440
我不喜欢他的眼神
I don't like the way that kid looked at me.

513
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:00,240
- 以前你见过他吗? - 我这个星期见了几百个小孩子
-  Ever seen him before? -  I saw a hundred kids this week.

514
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,120
我们看看他去哪家?
Let's see what house he goes into.

515
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,030
他干嘛走那么快?
Why's he going faster?

516
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,360
我跟你说过不对劲的嘛
I told you something's wrong.

517
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,570
他的眼神很怪 他跑什么?
He looked at me weird. Why would he run?

518
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,480
也许他进教堂了
Maybe he went in the church.

519
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,490
- 我可不到里面去 - 我也不去
-  I'm not going in there. -  Me neither.

520
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,610
离开这吧
Let's get out of here.

521
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,140
我要做好准备 等这些家伙过来
When those guys come back, I'll be ready.

522
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,200
他们回来了吗?
Did they come back?

523
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,500
从巴黎?
From Paris?

524
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,490
我们明天再来 说不定他们就走了
We'll come back tomorrow. Maybe they'll be gone.

525
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,000
我们赶快走吧 别被人看见
We better go before somebody sees us.

526
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,360
看我在厨房找到了什么东西?
Look what I found in the kitchen.

527
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,740
法兰克 那个晚点才能吃
Frank, those are for later.

528
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,960
孩子们 吃小虾子吗?
Do you want a little shrimp, huh?

529
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,790
你会说英语吗?
Do you speak English?

530
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,670
有没有...
Well, is there... ?

531
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:55,680
- 找到人了? - 我正在找儿子!
-  Did you get anybody? -  I am looking for my son!

532
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,600
一个人都找不到
No, I can't find anybody.

533
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,900
全都出去逛街了 一过节不会有人在家
They're all shopping. Nobody's home for the holidays.

534
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,810
别在意
Never mind, forget it.

535
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,400
- 这节过得真无聊 - 怎么了?
-  This is so pointless. -  What?

536
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,860
我们在这公寓里憋到烂掉
We're here rotting in this apartment.

537
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,280
凯文在家 妈在机场
Kevin's at home. Mom's at the airport.

538
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,240
- 那又怎样? - 你就不担心凯文出事吗?
-  So? -  You're not worried about Kevin?

539
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:19,330
我干嘛担心他? 他这个讨厌鬼 自己自作自受
Why should I be? He acted like a jerk, and now he caught it in the butt.

540
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,140
但是他还小啊 又没人帮他! 你就不想想他可能会吓坏的
He's so little and helpless. Don't you think he's flipped out?

541
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,260
他应该在真实世界里过几天
The trout can use a couple of days in the real world.

542
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,670
你就一点儿都不担心 他可能会发生什么事?
You're not worried something might happen?

543
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,470
不担心 三个理由
No. For three reasons:

544
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,430
第一 我就没这么幸运
A, I'm not that lucky.

545
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,350
第二 我们家里装了烟雾警报器
Two, we have smoke detectors...

546
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,440
最后 我们住在全美国最无聊的街上
...and D, we live in the most boring street in the United States...

547
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:46,020
也就是最不会发生危险的地方 就这样
...where nothing even remotely dangerous will ever happen. Period.

548
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,270
请走后门

549
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,180
谁呀?
Who is it?

550
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,550
小尼罗披萨
It's Little Nero's. I have your pizza.

551
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,850
放在台阶上 然后滚蛋
Leave it on the doorstep and get the hell out.

552
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,230
好吧
Okay.

553
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,020
那我的钱呢?
What about the money?

554
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,900
要钱吗?
What money?

555
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,360
吃披萨是要付钱的 先生
Well, you have to pay for your pizza, sir.

556
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,700
是吗? 该给多少?
Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?

557
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,040
11块8毛 先生
That'll be $11.80, sir.

558
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,090
不用找了 畜生!
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

559
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:52,760
- 小气鬼 - 嘿
-  Cheapskate. -  Hey.

560
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,260
我数十下
I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...

561
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,850
你这个杂种...
...to get your ugly, yellow...

562
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,180
赶快滚蛋
...no- good keister off my property...

563
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,520
不然就请你吃子弹
...before I pump your guts full of lead.

564
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:05,480
1 2... 10!
One, two...10.

565
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,800
这次就我一个人独享起司披萨了
A lovely cheese pizza, just for me.

566
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,600
飞往达拉斯的班机

567
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:43,640
就要起飞了

568
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,940
我还有500美元 一个快译通
So we have the $500, the pocket translator...

569
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,480

...the two first- class seats, that's an upgrade...

570
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,860
你的表是真的劳力士吗?
Is that a real Rolex?

571
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,900
- 你看呢? - 假的
-  Do you think it is? -  No.

572
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:59,320
谁能看得出来? 我这还有个戒指
But who can tell? I also have a ring.

573
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,410
真漂亮!
That is beautiful!

574
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,950
开始登机了
They're boarding.

575
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,790
她愿意出星期五的两张头等舱机票跟我们换
She's offered us two first- class tickets if we go Friday.

外加一个戒指 一只表
Plus a ring, a watch,

577
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:11,250
一个快译通 还有500美元 还有...

578
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,750

The earrings.

579
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,800
她有一大盒子的耳环呢
She's got her own earrings. A whole shoebox full of them.

580
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:18,590
- 快点 - 那...
-  Come on, come on. -  No, but...

581
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,050
我很急
I'm desperate.

582
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,930
我求求你们 你也是母亲吧 求你了
I'm begging you. From a mother to a mother. Please!

583

-  Oh, Ed. -  Please!

584
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,440
噢 好吧
Oh, all right.

585
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,280
亲爱的圣诞老人 去年我的礼物是个妹妹
"Dear Santa, I got a sister last year.

586
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,690
今年我想要粘土
This year I'd rather have Clay- Doh."

587
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,430
我不是有意的
I didn't mean it.

588
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,800
都回来吧 我不再惹你们了
If you come back, I'll never be a pain in the butt again.

589
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:06,310
我保证 晚安
I promise. Good night.

590
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,410
微波炉快餐好吃吗?
Are those microwave dinners good?

591
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,790
- 不知道 - 那我试一次好了
-  I don't know. -  I'll give them a whirl.

592
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,840
给孩子的
For the kids.

593
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,340
等一下 我有折价券
Hold on, I got a coupon for that.

594
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,550
是早上从报纸上剪下来的

596
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,100
好
Okay.

597
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,610
你自己一个人来的吗?
Are you here by yourself?

598
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,690
女士我才8岁
Ma'am, I'm 8 years old.

599
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:27,160
你说我会一个人来吗? 当然不会
You think I'd be here alone? I don't think so.

600
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,950
你妈妈在哪?
Where's your mom?

601
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,740
- 在车上 - 那你爸爸呢?

我是独生子
I'm an only child.

604
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,040
- 你住哪里? - 我不能告诉你
-  Where do you live? -  I can't tell you.

605
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,130
- 干嘛不告诉我? - 因为我不认识你
-  Why not? -  Because you're a stranger.

606
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:23,050
哈啰 凯文
Hello, Kevin!

607
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,760
闭嘴
Shut up!

608
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:42,560
真搞不懂
I don't get it.

609
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,360
这家现在看上去好像又没人在里面了
It looks like there's nobody's home.

610
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,570
昨晚上满屋子都是人
Last night the place is jumping.

611
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,070
不对劲
Something ain't right.

612
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,870
去看看
Go check it out.

613
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,040
现在吗?
Now?

614
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,920
不是现在还是明天呀? 猪脑啊你! 去啊
No, tomorrow, egghead! Now! Go ahead.

615
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,430
就现在
"Now? "

616
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,900
妈的!
Shit!

617
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,780
你快滚蛋
Get the hell out of here.

618
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:37,080
可以 强尼 钱呢?
All right, Johnny. But what about my money?

619
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,370
要钱吗?
What money?

620
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,790
老大说有我的一份
A.C. said you had some dough for me.

621
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,880
是吗? 该给多少?
Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?

622
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,880
老大说过 十分之一
A.C. said 10 percent.

623
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,630
可惜老大说的不算了
Too bad A.C. ain't in charge no more.

624
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,010
什么意思?
What do you mean?

625
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,720
他在楼上洗澡
He's upstairs, taking a bath.

626
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,810
他洗完澡后会打电话给你的
He'll call you when he gets out.

627
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:02,350
嘿 告诉你要给你什么 小蛇...
Hey, I tell you what I'm gonna give you, Snakes.

628
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,270
- 小蛇? - 我数十下
-  Snakes? -  I'll give you to the count of 10...

629
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,690
你这个杂种...
...to get your ugly, yellow, no- good...

630
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,860
赶快滚蛋
...keister off my property...

631
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,110
不然就请你吃子弹
...before I pump your guts full of lead.

632
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,990
好好 强尼 对不起 我马上走
All right, Johnny. I'm sorry. I'm going.

633
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,120
1 2...10!
One, two...10.

634
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,310
不用找了 畜生!
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

635
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,190
出什么事了?
What happened?

636
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,900
里面不知道是什么人让人打死了
I don't know who, but somebody got blown away.

637
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,400
有人抢了我们的生意 他们就在里面!
Somebody beat us, they're in there.

638
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,740
是两个人
Two of them.

639
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,570
他们正在吵架 一个人拿枪把另一个给干掉了
There was arguing. One blew the other one away.

640
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,370
- 谁? - 不知道
-  Who? -  I don't know.

641
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,020
我认出他们当中一个人的声音
I recognized one of their voices.

642
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,290
我想我以前听到过小蛇这个名字
I heard that name "Snakes" before.

643
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:08,210
小蛇? 小蛇 我不认识叫小蛇的
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes. I don't know no Snakes.

644
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,670
小蛇 我们还是快走吧!
Snakes. Let's get out of here.

645
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:15,300
别慌 别慌
Hold it. Hold it.

646
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:18,850
我们等在这里看看到底是谁干的 这块地盘也是我们的
Let's wait and see who it is. We work this neighborhood too.

647
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,680
说不定警察会问我们...
Suppose the cops finger us for a job...

648
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,850
然后他们问这附近的谋杀案的事
...and they ask us about a murder in the area.

649
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,020
要是能指认出个人不是很好吗?
Won't it be nice to have a face to go with it?

650
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:31,860
这可是个好主意
That's a good idea.

651
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,450
当然是 小蛇?
Of course it's a good idea. Snakes?

652
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:37,870
他的名字听起来像是小蛇
He sounded like a snake.

653
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,620
班机全部客满
Everything's full.

654
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,330
班机全部客满?
Everything's full?

655
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,380
没办法 圣诞前夕
I'm very sorry, but it is Christmas Eve.

656
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,920
其他航空公司呢?
What about another airline?

657
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:00,390
都满了 我可以帮您在饭店订个房间吗?
Nothing available. May I help you get a hotel room?

658
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,830
您可以搭明天下午的航班去芝加哥
Tomorrow we can get you a flight.

659
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,770
我等不了那么长时间
I can't wait that long.

660
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:08,650
对不起 女士 我们已经尽力了
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we're doing absolutely everything we can.

661
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,860
我挡到你了 对不起 你有地方度假
I'm in your way. I'm sorry. You've places to go.

662
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,450
你有机票 很好 对不起
Got a ticket there, good. Excuse me.

663
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,510
我差不多有60个小时没睡觉了
Look, I have been awake for almost 60 hours.

664
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,170
累得要死 身上又脏兮兮的
I'm tired and I'm dirty.

665
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:26,930
我从芝加哥到了巴黎 去了达拉斯
I have been from Chicago to Paris, to Dallas to...

666
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:28,040
这是什么鬼地方?
Where am I?

667
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,080
斯克蓝顿
Scranton.

668
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,920
我急着回家去看我8岁的儿子!
I'm trying to get home to my 8- year- old son.

669
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,260
你却告诉我没有办法?
Now you're telling me it's hopeless?

670
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,930
- 对不起 - 不 不用
-  I'm sorry. -  No. No way.

671
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,600
这是圣诞节 是充满希望的时候
This is Christmas! The season of perpetual hope.

672
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:46,020
到跑道上去拦飞机也无所谓...
If I have to get on your runway and hitchhike...

673
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,270
不管花多大代价...
...if it costs me everything I own...

674
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,310
如果需要把灵魂卖给魔鬼...
...if I have to sell my soul to the devil himself...

675
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,320
为了能回家去看我的儿子 我也卖
...I am going to get home to my son.

676
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,650
如果我今天能帮你任何忙...
Ma'am, if there was anything...

677
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,450
那就做吧!
Do it. Do anything.

678
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,570
- 我能帮你订一间的房 - 干嘛?
-  I can get you a hotel room. -  What?

679
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:05,870
不好意思 打搅一下行吗?
Can you excuse us for a sec? Can I see you for a second, please?

680
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,960
对不起
Excuse us.

681
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,460
我无意中听到你说的话
You got a little bit of a dilemma.

682
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,090
我们也遇到了危机
We got a crisis ourselves.

683
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,920
允许我自我介绍一下 我叫卡斯·波林斯基
Allow me to introduce myself. Gus Polinski.

684
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,550
中西部波卡音乐之王
Polka King of the Midwest?

685
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:27,310
听说过肯诺夏舞者吗?
The Kenosha Kickers?

686
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,940
- 嗨 - 你好
-  Hi there. -  Hi.

687
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:34,190
没关系 我以为你能认出我们来
That's okay. I thought you might have recognized...

688
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,900
几年前我出了几首曲子 轰动一时
I had a few hits a few years ago. That's why I just...

689
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,320
"波卡 波卡 波卡"
"Polka, Polka, Polka"?

690
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,290
没听过吗? 那么"双湖波卡"呢?
No? "Twin Lakes Polka"?

691
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,910
还有"亚犸乎兹亚波卡"
"Yamahoozie Polka, "

692
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:49,490
就是"亲亲我波卡"? 还有"旋转波卡"...
a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka"? "Polka Twist"?

693
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,830
这些都是歌曲吗?
These are songs?

694
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,920
是的 我们这帮人相当受欢迎
Yeah. Yeah, we... Some fairly big hits for us.

695
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:55,960
特别是在70年代早期
You know, in the early '70s.

696
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,960
我们卖了623张唱片
Yeah, we sold about 623 copies of that.

697
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:00,760
- 在芝加哥吗? - 不 在希波干市
-  In Chicago? -  No, Sheboygan.

698
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,630
全市都轰动了
Very big in Sheboygan.

699
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,340
你是说能帮我吗?
Did you say you could help?

700
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:08,270
我在喃喃自语 我们的航班取消了...
Anyway, I'm rambling on here. Our flight was canceled...

701
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,850
所以我们准备开车去 看到那个穿黄夹克上有标记的人吗?
...so we gotta drive. See the guy in the yellow jacket over there?

702
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:16,480
是他租给我们一辆漂亮的大车 我们开着去密尔瓦基
He's gonna rent us a nice big van to drive to Milwaukee.

703
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:20,030
我刚才听你说要去芝加哥?
Now, I heard you had some problems getting to Chicago?

704
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,650
去看你的孩子还是什么?
To see your kid?

705
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,870
我们走的时候把他忘在家里了
My son. He... We left, and he's there.

706
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:29,660
你要是去芝加哥 我们很高兴可以开车送你去
If you have to get to Chicago, we'll gladly drive you.

707
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,960
正好是去密瓦基的路上
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

708
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,880
- 你们可以送我? - 当然要送
-  You'd give me a ride? -  Sure, why not?

709
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,590
你还是早点回家看孩子吧
You gotta get home.

710
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,800
- 坐车去芝加哥? - 现在是圣诞节嘛
-  A ride to Chicago? -  Sure, it's Christmastime.

711
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,010
谢谢你! 噢 谢谢!
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

712
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,380
你不介意和波卡流浪艺人一起坐车吧?
You don't mind going with polka bums?

713
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,390
不 不介意
No, I'd love to.

714
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:11,410
嘿 马文
Hey, Marv. Marv, Marv!

715
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,460
看看
Look at this.

716
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:23,010
我看我们是让这个小子骗了
I think we're getting scammed by a kindergartner.

717
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:55,620
爸爸 过来帮帮忙好不好?
Dad, can you come here and help me?

718
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,750
还记得那天我们见到的那个小孩吗?
Remember that kid we saw the other day?

719
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,220
就住这
He lives here.

720
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,010
那要是孩子在家 父母肯定也在家
If the kid's here, the parents got to be.

721
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,010
他可是单独一人在家
He's home alone.

722
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,400
你白痴啊! 你要晚上才来吗?
What? You want to come back tonight?

723
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:21,980
这个孩子在这你也敢来?
Even with the kid here?

724
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,360
我觉得不能这样搞
I don't think that's a good idea.

725
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:27,280
就是这房子使我们决定要在这个街区动手的
That house is the reason we worked this block.

726
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,780
自从我第一次看到这栋房子 我就想要
Ever since I saw that house, I wanted it.

727
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,160
我们一步步来
Let's take it one step at a time.

728
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:36,910
先把卡车给腾空了 再吃点饭 九点左右我们再回来
We'll unload the van, get a bite to eat, we'll come back about 9:00.

729
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:38,420
九点左右
Nine o'clock.

730
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:39,920
那时候天就黑了
This way it's dark.

731
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,210
对啊 小孩子怕黑
Yeah, kids are scared of the dark.

732
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:46,090
你也怕黑 你自己知道
You're afraid of the dark too. You know you are.

733
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:48,930
我不怕黑
No, I'm not.

734
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,010
- 你就是怕! - 不怕不怕不怕!
-  Yes, you are. -  Not, not, not.

735
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,390
就是怕
You are so.

736
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,600
妈妈 你在哪呢?
Mom, where are you?

737
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,570
你会吹这个吗?
Do you play?

738
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,580
要不要试试看? 来嘛 试试 试试
Do you want to try? Go ahead, try it. Try it!

739
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,160
圣诞老人

740
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,400
- 对不起 - 什么事?
-  Excuse me. -  Yeah?

741
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,650
嘿 这双鞋真漂亮!
Hey, nice shoes.

742
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,610
噢 谢谢
Oh, thanks.

743
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:53,280
圣诞老人还在这吗? 我有重要的事要跟他说
Is he still here? It's really important that I see him.

744
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,450
他正要上车呢 你要是跑快点还能赶上他
He's getting in his car. If you hurry, you can catch him.

745
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:03,170
真该死! 居然在圣诞前夕 给圣诞老人开罚单
How low! Giving Kriss Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve!

746
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,960
那下次是什么? 难道还要给复活节兔子打狂犬病疫苗吗?
What's next, rabies shots for the Easter Bunny?

747
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:07,670
圣诞老人 等一下
Santa, hold on.

748
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:14,100
- 能耽误你一下吗? - 要快一点 圣诞老人快迟到了
-  Can I talk to you? -  Make it quick. Santa's running late.

749
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:16,430
我知道你不是真的圣诞老人
I know you're not the real Santa Claus.

750
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,390
你怎么会这样说? 我想知道为什么
What makes you say that? Just out of curiosity.

751
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,100
- 我能明白是怎么回事了 - 是的
-  I'm old enough to know how it works. -  All right.

752
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:26,310
但是我也知道你在为圣诞老人做事
But I also know you work for him.

753
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:29,480
- 我想请你帮我传话给他 - 说吧
-  I'd like you to give him a message. -  Shoot.

754
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:34,700
我是凯文·麦卡利斯特 住林肯大道671号 要电话号码吗?
Kevin McCallister, 671 Lincoln Blvd. Do you need the phone number?

755
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,280
不用了
No, that's all right.

756
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,410
这件事非常重要
This is extremely important.

757
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:41,970
请你告诉圣诞老人 今年不要送礼物了
Please tell him instead of presents,

758
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,670
就把我的全家人送回来就行了
I just want my family back.

759
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,750
不要玩具 什么都不要 就要彼得 凯蒂
No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate,

760
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,630
巴兹 梅根 琳妮 杰夫
Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff.

761
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,880
还有我的婶婶和表兄弟姐妹们
And my aunt and my cousins.

762
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:54,220
如果有时间的话 还有我的叔叔法兰克 好吗?
And if he has time, my Uncle Frank. Okay?

763
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,140
好的
Okay.

764
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:00,310
- 我会想办法的 - 谢谢
-  I'll see what I can do. -  Thanks.

765
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,060
等等! 我的小矮人把剩下的棒棒糖给她的男朋友了
Wait. My elf took the last of the candy canes home to her boyfriend.

766
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:07,150
- 没关系 - 不用 别傻了
-  That's okay. -  No, don't be silly.

767
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,230
见到圣诞老人的人 一定要得到点东西
Everybody who sees Santa has gotta get something.

768
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,570
在这儿 伸出你的小爪子 拿去
Here, hold out your little paw there. There you go.

769
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:17,410
- 别吃多了 不然吃不下饭 - 不会的
-  Don't spoil your dinner. -  I won't.

770
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,240
谢谢
Thanks.

771
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,050
妈的
Son of a... !

772
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:30,770
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

773
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:34,560
我可以坐下吗?
May I sit down?

774
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:47,280
我的孙女在那上面
That's my granddaughter.

775
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,870
那个红头发的小女孩
The little red- haired girl.

776
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:54,620
她和你差不多大 你认识她吗?
She's about your age. You know her?

777
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:55,920
不认识
No.

778
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:59,170
你住我隔壁 是吧?
You live next to me, don't you?

779
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,920
你见到我可以跟我打招呼 你不用害怕
You can say hello when you see me. You don't have to be afraid.

780
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:08,890
城里有很多关于我的传言 但都不是真的 懂吗?
There's a lot of things going around about me, but none of it's true. Okay?

781
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,720
- 你今年有当个乖孩子吗? - 我想有吧
-  You've been good this year? -  I think so.

782
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,730
敢发誓吗?
You swear to it?

783
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,150
不
No.

784
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,980
只有你觉得自己不好 才会到这个地方来
Yeah. Well, this is the place to be if you're feeling bad about yourself.

785
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,030
- 是吗? - 我是这么想的
-  It is? -  I think so.

786
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,820
- 你觉得自己不好吗? - 没有
-  Are you feeling bad about yourself? -  No.

787
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:35,580
最近我一直惹人厌 尽说些不该说的话
I've been kind of a pain lately. I said some things I shouldn't have.

788
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:38,210
今年我的表现真的不太好
I really haven't been too good this year.

789
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,880
是的
Yeah.

790
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:43,300
我满难过的 我真的很爱我的家人
I'm kind of upset because I really like my family.

791
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:48,430
尽管有时我嘴上说我不爱他们 我甚至心里想过我不爱他们
Even though sometimes I say I don't. Sometimes I even think I don't.

792
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:51,470
- 你明白了吗? - 差不多吧
-  Do you get that? -  I think so.

793
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:54,770
家家都有一本难念的经
How you feel about your family is a complicated thing.

794
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,440
特别是和哥哥的关系
Especially with an older brother.

795
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:00,520
内心深处虽然总是爱着他们
Deep down, you'll always love them.

796
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:05,030
但却不知怎样去表现 于是就伤害了他们也伤害了自己
But you can forget that you love them. You can hurt them, they can hurt you.

797
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,660
这跟年纪大小好像没有关系
And that's not just because you're young.

798
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:12,080
你是不是想知道我到这里的真正原因?
You want to know the real reason why I'm here?

799
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,540
是的
Sure.

800
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,130
我是来听我孙女唱歌的 而今晚我是不能来的
I came to hear my granddaughter sing. I can't come hear her tonight.

801
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,460
你有约会吗?
You have plans?

802
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,710
不是
No.

803
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,210
他们不欢迎我
I'm not welcome.

804
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,220
教堂不欢迎你?
At church?

805
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:27,550
教堂总是欢迎你的
You're always welcome at church.

806
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,840
是我的儿子不欢迎我
I'm not welcome with my son.

807
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:35,060
几年前 你们家搬来这个区前...
Years back, before you and your family moved on the block...

808
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:37,480
我和我儿子大吵了一架
...I had an argument with my son.

809
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:39,310
他多大了?
How old is he?

810
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:41,190
他是大人了
He's grown up.

811
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:47,240
我们都发了火 我说我不想再看见他了
We lost our tempers, and I said I didn't care to see him anymore.

812
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:52,080
他也是这么说的 从那时起 我们就没讲过话了
He said the same, and we haven't spoken to each other since.

813
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,500
既然你想他 干嘛不打电话给他?
If you miss him, why don't you call him?

814
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,250
我害怕我要是打电话给他 他不会理我
I'm afraid if I call, he won't talk to me.

815
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,000
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

816
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,010
我也不知道 就是害怕他不理我
I don't know. I'm just afraid he won't.

817
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:07,510
不是我存心冒犯你 你岁数大了 是不是不该害怕了?
No offense, but aren't you a little old to be afraid?

818
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,050
人一天天变老...
You can be old for a lot of things.

819
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:14,060
- 但总是会害怕的 - 这倒是
-  You're never too old to be afraid. -  That's true.

820
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,180
我一直害怕地下室
I was afraid of our basement.

821
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:19,690
太黑 总觉得有些怪东西在下面 里面的味道也怪怪的
It's dark. There's weird stuff down there, and it smells funny.

822
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,360
这样的事烦我好多年了
That sort of thing. It's bothered me for years.

823
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,900
地下室给人的感觉都是那个样子
Basements are like that.

824
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,610
后来我壮着胆子下去洗衣服
I made myself go down to do some laundry...

825
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,950
发觉并不那么可怕
...and I found out it's not so bad.

826
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,790
开始我一直很害怕 后来把灯一打开 就什么事都没了
I worried about it, but if you turn on the lights, it's no big deal.

827
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,120
你是什么意思?
What's your point?

828
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,330
我的意思是 你应该打电话给你儿子
My point is, you should call your son.

829
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:44,040
- 他要是不理我怎么办? - 至少你会知道
-  What if he won't talk to me? -  At least you'll know.

830
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:48,630
也就不必担心这件事了 也就不会再害怕了
Then you could stop worrying about it. You won't have to be afraid anymore.

831
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:54,350
我不管多生我爸的气 总会跟他讲话的 特别是在过节的时候
No matter how mad I was, I'd talk to my dad. Especially around the holidays.

832
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,680
我不知道
I don't know.

833
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:01,100
你试一试吧 就算是为了你的孙女
Just give it a shot. For your granddaughter anyway.

834
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:04,230
我保证她很想你和你的礼物
I'm sure she misses you. And the presents.

835
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,270
我寄过一张支票给她
I send her a check.

836
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:10,770
我希望我爷爷奶奶也寄支票给我 他们总是寄衣服给我
I wish my grandparents did that. They always send me clothes.

837
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,610
去年就给了我一件上面织着大鸟的毛衣
Last year I got a sweater with a bird knitted on it.

838
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:14,910
啊 那不错啊
Oh, that's nice.

839
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,240
二年级的男生不适合穿那个
Not for a guy in the second grade.

840
01:12:17,450 --> 01:12:20,080
要是穿了会被打的
You can get beat up for wearing something like that.

841
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,500
我一个朋友 因为听说他穿过...
I have a friend who got nailed...

842
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:26,590
有恐龙图案的睡衣 就被打了
...because there was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

843
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:32,200
你还是赶快回家吧 想想我对你说的话
You better run home where you belong. Think about what I said.

844
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,760
- 怎么样? - 好吧
-  All right? -  Okay.

845
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,720
跟你聊天真高兴
It's nice talking to you.

846
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,640
我也是
Nice talking to you.

847
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,980
- 你怎么办? - 我?
-  What about you? -  Me?

848
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:49,150
是 你和你儿子
Yeah. You and your son.

849
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:52,990
再看看吧
We'll see what happens.

850
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,530
圣诞快乐!
Merry Christmas.

851
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,660
圣诞快乐!
Merry Christmas.

852
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:54,170
这是我的房子 我必须保卫它!
This is my house. I have to defend it.

853
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:02,520
战略计划图

854
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:28,980
柏油

855
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:25,260
先过去看看 然后回来收拾卡车
We'll check it out. We can come back for the truck.

856
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,650
我们怎么进去?
How do we go in?

857
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,190
到后门去 也许他会让我们进去
We'll go to the back door. Maybe he'll let us in.

858
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,780
是的 他是个孩子 小孩子都傻
Yeah, he's a kid. Kids are stupid.

859
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:47,790
感谢主赐我营养的微波炉快餐
Bless this nutritious, microwaveable macaroni and cheese dinner...

860
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,790
并祝福那些低价卖东西的人们
...and the people who sold it on sale. Amen.

861
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,530
就这样 现在起不再害怕
This is it. Don't get scared now.

862
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,420
圣诞快乐 小子
Merry Christmas, little fella.

863
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:40,010
我们知道你在里面 而且只有你一个人
We know that you're in there and that you're all alone.

864
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:42,840
快点 小子 开门!
Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.

865
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,390
是圣诞老人和小精灵来啦
It's Santy Claus and his elf.

866
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,060
我们不会伤害你的
We won't hurt you.

867
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:54,150
不 不会的 我们还带了礼物来给你呢
No, no. Got some nice presents for you.

868
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,150
好孩子 来开门吧
Be a good little fella now and open the door.

869
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,110
怎么了?
What?

870
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,950
怎么了? 怎么了?
What? What?

871
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:09,700
怎么了?
What?

872
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:12,370
- 怎么搞的? - 抓住那...
-  What happened? -  Get that little...

873
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,300
你好
Hello.

874
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,390
太好了! 太好了!
Yes! Yes!

875
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,100
这兔崽子有枪!
The little jerk is armed!

876
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:39,520
好吧 我从前门进去 你从地下室进去
That's it! I'm going in the front. You go down the basement!

877
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,090
自作聪明!
That smart aleck!

878
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:16,890
这小兔崽子 死定了你
Oh, boy. That's it, you little... You little...

879
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:20,060
这次可不会了 你这个小兔崽子
No, not this time, you little brat.

880
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,270
小混蛋 你在哪?
You little creep, where are you?

881
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,630
干得好!
Yes!

882
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,170
我要把你的脑袋扯下来!
... rip his head off... !

883
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:38,470
你死定了 小子
You're dead, kid.

884
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:28,690
小浑蛋 你在哪?
Where are you, you little creep?

885
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:47,620
哈利! 我来了
Harry, I'm coming in!

886
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,340
噢 不 我真的好害怕!
Oh, no! I'm really scared.

887
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:58,380
太晚了 小子! 我们已经在房子里 就要抓到你了!
It's too late for you, kid, we're in the house. We're gonna get you.

888
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,720
好吧! 过来抓我吧!
Okay, come and get me!

889
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,220
你这个...!
Why, you... !

890
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:10,020
你死定了!
Now you're dead!

891
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,300
我非杀了那小子不可!
I'm gonna kill that kid!

892
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:55,480
- 马文 - 哈利!
-  Marv. -  Harry?

893
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:57,570
你干嘛脱鞋?
Why'd you take your shoes off?

894
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:59,820
你干嘛弄得像只鸡一样?
Why are you dressed like a chicken?

895
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:05,450
我在上面 你们两个白痴 快过来抓我呀!
I'm up here, you morons. Come and get me.

896
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:11,870
你们要投降还是要再来一点?
You guys give up, or are you thirsty for more?

897
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,090
小心头!
Heads up!

898
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,640
别担心 马文 我会帮你抓到他
Don't worry, Marv. I'll get him for you.

899
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,480
太棒了!
Yes!

900
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:41,320
他不过是个孩子 哈利 我们能抓到他的
He's only a kid, Harry. We can take him.

901
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,570
闭嘴! 你看什么看?
Shut up, will you? What is it?

902
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,950
你缺牙了
You're missing some teeth.

903
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,330
是哪颗? 我的金牙!
Where? It's my gold tooth.

904
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:52,500
我的金牙没了! 我非杀了他不可!
My gold tooth. I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

905
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:57,040
你再用罐子打...
You bomb me with one more can, kid...

906
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:01,510
老子一定把你的小鸡鸡扯下来放在油锅里煎!
...and I'll snap off your cojones and boil them in motor oil!

907
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:06,050
911紧急专线
911 emergency.

908
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:08,100
喂 有人在我家行窃
Hello, my house is being robbed.

909
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:13,020
地址是林肯大道656号 我的名字叫墨菲
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard. My name is Murphy.

910
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,940
不知道上面有什么东西
You never know what's there.

911
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:20,690
他在那里!
There he is!

912
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,280
抓到你了! 我抓到他了! 哈利!
I got you! I got him, Harry.

913
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,370

I got him.

914
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,790
哈利 快起来 帮我!
Harry, give me a hand!

915
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:38,090
我抓到他了
I got him!

916
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,590
哈利 帮我一把! 快起来呀!
Harry, help me. Get up!

917
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:42,420
我抓到他了!
I got him.

918
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:23,420
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

919
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,840
哈利 不要动!
Harry, don't move.

920
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:28,180
马文?
Marv?

921
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:30,760
不要动!
Don't move.

922
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,810
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

923
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,230
打死了吗?
Did I get him?

924
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:41,060
打死了吗?
Did I get him?

925
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,530
在哪里? 在哪里?
Where is it? Where is it?

926
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:47,360
别管它 爽了没有? 你这个浑蛋
Never mind that. Here! How do you like it, huh? You jerk!

927
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:50,450
快去抓那个小孩! 快去! 抓住他!
Get that kid, before I... Get that kid!

928
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,390
跑哪去了?
Where'd he go?

929
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:21,150
说不定自杀了吧
Maybe he committed suicide.

930
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:26,280
在下面! 你们两个大坏蛋 来抓我呀 要不然我报警了!
Down here, you big horse's ass! Come get me before I call the police.

931
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:28,490
- 我去把这小子抓来! - 等等
-  Let's get him! -  Wait, wait.

932
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,570
这小子就是要我们...
It's just what he wants us to do:

933
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,870
从楼下过去中他的机关! 想狠狠修理我们
Go back through his fun house so we get all tore up.

934
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,620
他就要报警了!
He's gonna call the cops!

935
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:37,500
在树屋怎么报警?
From a tree house?

936
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:38,870
过去
Come on.

937
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:41,710
从窗户过去?
Out the window?

938
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,290
我可不行
I'm not going out the window.

939
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:47,510
怎么? 你害怕了? 你是不是怕了?
Why, you scared? Are you afraid? Come on, get out here.

940
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,680
快点啦你
Come on.

941
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:01,190
快点啦
Come on!

942
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:10,260
- 快点! - 哈利 还是回去吧
-  Come on. Keep going. -  Let's go back, Harry.

943
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:16,790
马文! 别叫啦!
Shut it, Marv.

944
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:21,290
你好!
Hey, guys!

945
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:23,170
再看看这个!
Check this out.

946
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,960
快回去! 快回去!
Go back. Go back.

947
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:15,840
他在那里!
There he is!

948
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:18,100
我要去报警!
Hey, I'm calling the cops!

949
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:21,850
等等 他就是想我们跟着他
Wait, wait! He wants us to follow him.

950
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,020
看我的 这边走
I got a better idea. Come on.

951
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,250
嗨 兄弟
Hi, pal.

952
01:29:43,660 --> 01:29:46,920
这回栽在我们手里了吧 过来吧你
We outsmarted you this time. Get over here!

953
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,300
我们怎么修理他?
What are you gonna do?

954
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,760
以牙还牙
I'll do exactly what he did to us.

955
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:58,800
我要用喷灯烧他的头!
Burn his head with a blowtorch.

956
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,010
我要用熨斗烫他的脸!
I'll smash his face with an iron.

957
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:04,060
再用油漆桶往他的脸上摔!
I'd like to slap him in the face with a paint can!

958
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:05,890
要不就把钉子插到脚掌里去!
Shove a nail through his foot!

959
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:11,020
把他的小嫩手指一根一根咬下来 一次咬一根
I'm gonna bite off every one of these little fingers, one at a time.

960
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:22,700
快走 快回家去
Come on. Let's get you home.

961
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,400
哇! 这下可好了!
Wow, this is great.

962
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:54,030
做得很好 每次做案都放水
Nice move, leaving the water running.

963
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:58,070
现在知道了 有水的房子就是你们干的
Now we know each and every house that you've hit.

964
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:04,200
找你们两个很久了
We've been looking for you guys for a long time.

965
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:07,330
好啊 记住了 我们就是有名的"水盗"
Yeah. Well, remember, we're the Wet Bandits.

966
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:11,710
- 我们就是水盗 就是流水的水... - 闭嘴! 上车!
-  Wet Bandits, that's W- E- T... -  Shut up! Get in the car!

967
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,500
快点!
Hey, come on. Come on.

968
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,800
- 别碰我的头 朋友 - 上车!
-  Hands off the head, pal! -  Come on.

969
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,310
我不是个好母亲 不是好母亲
I'm a bad parent. I'm a bad parent.

970
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:15,770
不 你是个好母亲
No, you're not.

971
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:18,440
你太自责了
You're beating yourself up there.

972
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:20,360
这是常有的事
These things happen.

973
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:24,450
要是说起不称职的父母 看看我们吧
You want to talk about bad parents? Look at us.

974
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:29,410
我们一年中有48到49个星期在外巡回演出 几乎见不到家人
We're on the road 48, 49 weeks a year. We hardly see our families.

975
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,370
那边的乔治...
Joe, over there. Gosh, you know...

976
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:35,420
不记得自己孩子的名字
...he forgets his kids' names half the time.

977
01:32:35,630 --> 01:32:38,920
那边的兹吉根本就还没见过自己的孩子呢
Ziggy over there, he's never even met his kid.

978
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:42,930
还有艾迪 他对不起家里的事就更多了
Eddy.... Let's just hope none of them write a book about him.

979
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:47,560
你们有因为去度假 把孩子忘在家里吗?
Tell me, have you gone on vacation and left your child home?

980
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,350
没有
No.

981
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:56,020
但是我倒是有一次把孩子忘在殡仪馆了
But I did leave one at a funeral parlor once.

982
01:32:56,860 --> 01:33:00,110
那也是同样让人很难受
Yeah, it was terrible too. I was all distraught and everything.

983
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:04,570
我和我太太把孩子留在殡仪馆了
The wife and I, we left the little tyke there in the funeral parlor.

984
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:08,490
孩子被忘在殡仪馆里整整一天 到了晚上...
All day. You know, we went back at night, when we...

985
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:10,950
才想起他来 我们赶紧去找他
...came to our senses, there he was.

986
01:33:11,210 --> 01:33:14,330
他在遗体旁待了整整一天
Apparently, he was there all day with a corpse.

987
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:18,670
六七个星期之后 他就好了 你知道的...
He was okay. You know, after six, seven weeks.

988
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,340
就又说又蹦又跳了
He came around and started talking again.

989
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,720
小孩子很快就恢复了 不像大人那样
They get over it. Kids are resilient like that.

990
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:27,640
我们或许不应该谈论这个话题
We shouldn't talk about this.

991
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:32,320
- 我只是想让你振作起来 - 对不起
-  I was just trying to cheer you up. -  I'm sorry I did.

992
01:33:58,290 --> 01:33:59,420
妈!
Mom?

993
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:05,880
妈!
Mom?

994
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:11,970
妈?
Mom?

995
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:59,650
凯文!
Kevin!

996
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:02,320
凯文!
Kevin!

997
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:35,560
圣诞快乐! 宝贝
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

998
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:47,490
凯文 妈妈真的对不起你
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

999
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:09,220
其他人都去哪了?
Where's everybody else?

1000
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:11,930
噢 他们回不来
Oh, baby, they couldn't come.

1001
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:13,390
他们是想回来的...
They wanted to so much...

1002
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,060
我才没有流口水呢! 有吗?
I didn't fall asleep in the back and drool all over you, did I?

1003
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:20,600
- 你流了 - 别吵了
-  You do drool! -  Shut up!

1004
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:27,070
凯文 你还好吧?
Kevin, my boy. How are you? It's good to see you.

1005
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,030
你没事吧
You're all right.

1006
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:30,740
我爱你 你还好吗?
I love you. You okay?

1007
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:33,530
凯文
Hey, Kev.

1008
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:38,540
你还没把房子给烧了 真是了不起
It's cool that you didn't burn the place down.

1009
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:42,330
谢谢 巴兹
Thanks, Buzz.

1010
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:46,040
等一下 你们是怎么回来的?
Wait a minute. How'd you guys get home?

1011
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:48,760
我们坐的是你不愿意等的那班飞机
On the morning flight you didn't want to wait for.

1012
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,220
- 喔! 谢谢 - 圣诞快乐!
-  Oh, no. Thank you. -  Merry Christmas.

1013
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:53,840
圣诞快乐!
Merry Christmas.

1014
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:56,550
谁去找间开门的商店
Someone has to find an open store.

1015
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,390
我昨天去店里买了
I went shopping yesterday.

1016
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,600
你? 买东西?
You, shopping?

1017
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,610
我买了牛奶 买了鸡蛋 还有柔软精
I got some milk, eggs and fabric softener.

1018
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:09,440
- 什么? - 真的假的?
-  What? -  No kidding?

1019
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:11,360
这孩子还真好玩
What a funny guy.

1020
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:13,700
我们不在家的时候你还做了什么?
What else did you do while we were away?

1021
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:17,120
只是在屋里东摸西摸
Just hung around.

1022
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,660
把东西拿上楼
Bring your stuff upstairs.

1023
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:25,420
买东西? 他连自己的鞋带都不会绑 还会买东西?
Shopping? He doesn't know how to tie his shoe. He's going shopping?

1024
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:28,630
凯文才不会这么做呢
This is not the Kevin I knew.

1025
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,780
宝贝 这是什么东西?
Honey, what's this?

1026
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:55,670
凯文! 看你把我的房间搞成什么样子?
Kevin! What did you do to my room?
