1
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,993
Are you the guys from Washington?

2
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,912
You get many other visitors out here?

3
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,580
How long you been on-site?

4
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,040
Since this morning.

5
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,793
A Russian oil team
called it in about 18 hours ago.

6
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,378
How come nobody spotted it before?

7
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,172
It's really not that surprising.

8
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,758
This landscape's changing all the time.

9
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,718
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

10
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,887
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

11
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,305
I don't think so.

12
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,474
You know, we don't have
the equipment for a job like this.

13
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,185
How long before
we can start craning it out?

14
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,187
I don't think you quite understand.

15
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:46,232
You guys are gonna need
one hell of a crane.

16
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,738
<i>Base, we're in.</i>

17
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,163
<i>What is this?</i>

18
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,596
<i>Careful.</i>

19
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,784
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

20
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,206
<i>What is it?</i>

21
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,874
<i>My God.</i>

22
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,627
<i>Base, get me a line to the Colonel.</i>

23
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:31,795
<i>It's 3:00 a.m., sir.</i>

24
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,467
<i>I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.</i>

25
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,150
They've come for it!

26
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,860
They have before.

27
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,863
Not like this.

28
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,031
Let them come.

29
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,699
They'll never find it.

30
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,415
Open it!

31
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,876
Quickly, before he...

32
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,726
It has taken me a long time
to find this place.

33
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,980
You should be commended.

34
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,106
Help him up.

35
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:22,031
I think that you are
a man of great vision.

36
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,533
And, in this way, we are much alike.

37
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,076
I am nothing like you.

38
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,745
No, of course, but

39
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,375
what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be a science.

40
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,711
What you seek is just a legend.

41
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,380
Then why make such an effort
to conceal it?

42
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:03,572
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

43
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,288
It is not something one buries.

44
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:16,085
But I think it is close, yes?

45
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,128
I cannot help you.

46
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,841
No. But maybe
you can help your village.

47
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:28,222
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?

48
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,308
I have no need for them to die.

49
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,074
Yggdrasil.

50
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,327
Tree of the world.

51
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,331
Guardian of wisdom.

52
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,252
And fate, also.

53
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,871
And the Fuhrer digs for trinkets
in the desert.

54
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,294
You have never seen this, have you?

55
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:44,381
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

56
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,049
Exactly.

57
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,555
Give the order to open fire.

58
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,932
Fool!

59
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,852
You cannot control the power you hold.

60
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,020
You will burn!

61
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,856
I already have.

62
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,245
<i>O'Connell, Michael.</i>

63
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,123
Kaminsky, Henry.

64
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,459
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

65
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,419
Rogers, Steven.

66
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,256
It kind of makes you think twice
about enlisting, huh?

67
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:27,925
Nope.

68
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,387
Rogers.

69
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,230
- What did your father die of?
- Mustard gas.

70
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,234
He was in the 107th Infantry.
I was hoping I could be assigned...

71
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,070
- Your mother?
- She was a nurse in a TB ward.

72
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,280
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

73
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,870
- Sorry, son.
- Look, just give me a chance.

74
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,540
You'd be ineligible
on your asthma alone.

75
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,041
Is there anything you can do?

76
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,834
I'm doing it.

77
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,545
I'm saving your life.

78
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,051
<i>War continues to ravage Europe.</i>

79
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,054
<i>But help is on the way.</i>

80
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:19,476
<i>Every able-bodied young man is

<i>Even little Timmy is doing his part</i>

82
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,150
<i>collecting scrap metal.</i>

83
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,402
<i>Nice work, Timmy!</i>

84
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,778
Who cares?

85
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,531
Play the movie already!

86
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,324
Hey, you wanna show some respect?

87
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,784
<i>Meanwhile, overseas,</i>

88
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,954
<i>our brave boys are showing

89
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,789
<i>of freedom is never too high.</i>

90
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,208
Let's go! Get on with it!

91
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,877
Hey, just start the cartoon!

92
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,129
Hey, you wanna shut up?

93
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,674
<i>Together with Allied forces,
we'll face any threat,</i>

94
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,134
<i>no matter the size.</i>

95
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,361
You just don't know when to give up,
do you?

96
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,864
I can do this all day.

97
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,494
Hey!

98
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,079
Pick on someone your own size.

99
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,299
Sometimes I think
you like getting punched.

100
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,635
I had him on the ropes.

101
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,887
How many times is this?

102
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,223
You're from Paramus now?

103
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,226
You know it's illegal to lie
on the enlistment form.

104
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,811
And seriously, Jersey?

105
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,065
You get your orders?

106
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,735
The 107th.

107
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,487
Sergeant James Barnes,

108
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,989
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

109
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,994
I should be going.

110
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,582
Come on, man.

111
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,252
My last night!
I got to get you cleaned up.

112
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,921
Why? Where are we going?

113
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,339
The future.

114
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,221
I don't see what the problem is.

115
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,932
You're about to be
the last eligible man in New York.

116
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,518
You know there's
three and a half million women here?

117
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,894
Well, I'd settle for just one.

118
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,313
Good thing I took care of that.

119
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,023
Hey, Bucky!

120
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,444
What'd you tell her about me?

121
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,488
Only the good stuff.

122
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,742

Hey, Steve, what do you say
we treat these girls...

137
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,423
Come on, soldier.

138
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,472
Come on. You're kind of
missing the point of a double date.

139
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,057
We're taking the girls dancing.

140
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,226
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

141
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,147
You're really going to do this again?

142
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,774
Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.

143
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,567
As who, Steve from Ohio?

144
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,028
They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.

145
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:41,988
Look, I know
you don't think I can do this.

146
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,490
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.

147
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,534
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?

148
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,494
- There are so many important jobs
- What do you want me to do?

149
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,496
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

150
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,206
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

151
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,917
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

152
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,003
I got no right to do any less than them.

153
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,756
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.

154
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,343
Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.

155
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,099
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?

156
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,102
Yes, we are.

157
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,193
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

158
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,319
How can I?

159
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,613
You're taking all the stupid with you.

160
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,952
- You're a punk.
- Jerk.

161

Be careful.

162
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,334
Don't win the war till I get there!

163
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:44,384
Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.

164
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,155
Wait here.

165
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,617
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.

166
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,845
Thank you.

167
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,767
So,

168
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:37,938
you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.

169
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,607
Excuse me?

170
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,567
Dr Abraham Erskine.

171
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,362
I represent
the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

172
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,821
Steve Rogers.

173
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,869
Where are you from?

174
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,457
Queens. 73rd Street
and Utopia Parkway.

175
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,876
Before that, Germany.

176
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,796
- This troubles you?
- No.

177
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,924
Where are you from, Mr Rogers?

178
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,968
Is it New Haven?

179
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,470
Or Paramus?

180
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,723
Five exams in five different cities.

181
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,849
That might not be the right file.

182
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,810
No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.

183
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,062
It's the five tries.

184
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:24,234
But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?

185
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,238
Is this a test?

186
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,907
Yes.

187
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,662
I don't want to kill anyone.

188
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:39,541
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.

189
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,502
Well, there are already

190
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,587
so many big men fighting this war.

191
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,631
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

192
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,468
I can offer you a chance.

193
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,722
Only a chance.

194
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,598
- I'll take it.
- Good.

195
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,603
So where is
the little guy from? Actually?

196
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,939
Brooklyn.

197
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,610
Congratulations, soldier.

198
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,887
Are you ready, Dr Zola?

199
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,975
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

200
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,604
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

201
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,273
Are you certain
that those conductors of yours

202
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:49,486
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

203
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,154
With this artefact

204
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,156
I am certain of nothing.

205
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,825
I fear it may not work at all.

206
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,155
Twenty percent.

207
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,700
Forty.

208
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,746
Sixty.

209
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,459
Stabilising at 70%.

210
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,298
I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

211
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,402
What was that?

212
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,114
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

213
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,367
Your designs do not disappoint.

214
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,788
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

215
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,791
The exchange is stable.

216
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,835
Amazing!

217
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,504
The energy we have just collected

218
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,591
could power my designs.
All my designs.

219
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,554
This will change the war.

220
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,015
Dr Zola,

221
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,352
this will change the world.

222
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,732
Ready, exercise!

223
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,609
Recruits, attention!

224
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,153
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

225
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,114
I supervise all operations
for this division.

226
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,366
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

227
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,578
I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

228
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,787
What's your name, soldier?

229
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,873
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

230
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,708
Step forward, Hodge.

231
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,836
Put your right foot forward.

232
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,631
We gonna wrassle?

233
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,801
'Cause I got a few moves
I know you'll like.

234
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,972
Agent Carter!

235
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:24,682
Colonel Phillips.

236
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,769
I can see that you are
breaking in the candidates. That's good!

237
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:29,729
Get your ass up out of that dirt

238
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,565
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do.

239
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,150
Yes, sir!

240
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,781
General Patton has said

241
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,952
that wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

242
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,622
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

243
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,170
And because they are
going to get better.

244
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,256
Much better.

245
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,843
<i>The Strategic Scientific Reserve
is an Allied effort</i>

246
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,972
<i>made up of
the best minds in the free world.</i>

247
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,558
<i>Our goal is
to create the best army in history.</i>

248
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,019
<i>But every army starts with one man.</i>

249
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,230
Rogers! Get off of there!

250
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,440
<i>At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.</i>

251
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,653
He will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier.

252
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,287
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!

253
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,041
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

254
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,502
Pick up the pace, ladies!

255
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,631
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

256
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,759
Come on! Faster! Faster!

257
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,554
Move! Move!

258
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,889
Squad, halt!

259
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,767
That flag means
we're only at the halfway point.

260
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,896
First man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

261
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,732
Move, move!

262
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,484
Come on! Get up there!

263
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,446
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble!

264
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,114
Get up there, Hodge!

265
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,742
Come on! Get up there!

266
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,871
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!

267
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,834
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

268
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,211
Let's go! Get back into formation!

269
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,924
Rogers! I said fall in!

270
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,776
Thank you, sir.

271
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,787
Faster, ladies! Come on.

272
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,373
My grandmother has more life in her,
God rest her soul.

273
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,833
Move it!

274
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,044
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

275
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,047
I'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

276
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,467
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

277
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,968
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."

278
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,762
Maybe he'd be useful to you,
like a gerbil.

279
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:08,888
I never thought you'd pick him.

280
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,181
Up.

281
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,019
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's gonna go right through him.

282
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,605
- Come on, girls.
- Look at that.

283
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:19,899
He's making me cry.

284
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,568
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

285
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:25,279
Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?

286
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,489
All the grovelling I had to do

287
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,740
in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?

288
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,076
Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.

289
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,413
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

290
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,415
He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.

291
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,958
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.

292
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,961
You don't win wars
with niceness, Doctor.

293
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,092
You win wars with guts.

294
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,387
Grenade!

295
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,226
Get away!

296
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,145
Get back!

297
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:05,987
It was a dummy grenade.

298
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,073
All clear. Back in formation.

299
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,454
Is this a test?

300
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,373
He's still skinny.

301
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,550
- May I?
- Yeah.

302
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,221
Can't sleep?

303
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:34,682
I got the jitters, I guess.

304
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,559
Me, too.

305
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,854
Can I ask you a question?

306
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,355
Just one?

307
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,984
Why me?

308
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,823
I suppose that is
the only question that matters.

309
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,996
This is from Augsburg. My city.

310
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:00,708
So many people forget

311
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,294
that the first country the Nazis invaded
was their own.

312
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:07,423
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

313
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,426
They felt weak. They felt small.

314
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,261
And then Hitler comes along
with the marching

315
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,389
and the big show and the flags.

316
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,686
And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.

317
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,104
And he says, "You."

318
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,815
He says, "You will make us strong."

319
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,236
Well, I am not interested.

320
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,989
So he sends the head of Hydra,

321
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,450
his research division.

322
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,370
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

323
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,039
Now, Schmidt is
a member of the inner circle.

324
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,457
And he is ambitious.

325
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:47,171
<i>He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.</i>

326
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,925
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

327
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,802
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

328
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,305
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced

329
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,933
that there is a great power
hidden in the earth,

330
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,268
<i>left here by the gods,</i>

331
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,187
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

332
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:08,818
So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he cannot resist.

333
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,407
<i>Schmidt must become
that superior man.</i>

334
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,205
Did it make him stronger?

335
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,665
Yes.

336
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,002
But there were other effects.

337
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:31,632
The serum was not ready.

338
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,845
But more important, the man.

339
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,056
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

340
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,268
so good becomes great.

341
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,103
Bad becomes worse.

342
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,027
This is why you were chosen.

343
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,656
Because a strong man
who has known power all his life

344
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,700
may lose respect for that power,

345
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,995
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

346
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,372
And knows

347
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,207
compassion.

348
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,130
Thanks. I think.

349
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,972
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

350
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,269
That you will stay who you are.

351
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,774
Not a perfect soldier,

352
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,150
but

353
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,611
a good man.

354
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,284
To the little guys.

355
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,330
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?

356
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,582
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.

357
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,710
All right. We'll drink it after.

358
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,381
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? I drink it now.

359
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,774
Is there something in particular
you need?

360
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,449
I understand you found him.

361
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:22,910
See for yourself.

362
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,549
You disapprove.

363
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:40,261
I just don't see
why you need concern yourself.

364
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,138
I can't imagine he will succeed.

365
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,350
Again.

366
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:50,730
His serum is the Allies' only defence
against this power we now possess.

367
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,483
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

368
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,321
Shall I give the order?

369
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,324
It has been given.

370
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,828
Good.

371
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,457
Dr Zola!

372
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:15,045
What do you think?

373
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,846
A masterpiece.

374
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,858
I know this neighbourhood.

375
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,736
I got beat up in that alley.

376
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,405
And that parking lot.

377
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,618
And behind that diner.

378
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,537
Did you have something against
running away?

379
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,667
You start running,
they'll never let you stop.

380
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,836
You stand up, you push back.

381
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,254
They can't say no forever, right?

382
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:01,550
I know a little of what that's like,
to have every door shut in your face.

383
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,804
I guess I just don't know
why you'd want to join the Army

384
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,263
if you were a beautiful dame.

385
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,890
Or a... A woman.

386
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,391
An agent. Not a dame.

387
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,352
You are beautiful, but...

388
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,355
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

389
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,899
I think this is the longest conversation
I've had with one.

390
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,904
Women aren't exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

391
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,572
You must have danced.

392
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,367
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

393
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,411
And the past few years, it just

394
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,414
didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.

395
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:33,958
For what?

396
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,919
The right partner.

397
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,935
This way.

398
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,607
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.

399
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,623
Wonderful weather this morning,
isn't it?

400
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,959
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

401
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,143
Good morning.

402
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,021
Please, not now.

403
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:24,985
Are you ready?

404
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:30,616
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie,
and your hat.

405
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,957
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

406
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,625
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

407
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,627
We needed access to
the city's power grid.

408
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,837
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

409
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,131
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

410
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:47,633
This is...

411
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,385
Fred Clemson, State Department.

412
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,970
If this project of yours comes through,

413
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,681
we'd like to see it used
for something other than headlines.

414
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:57,559
Jesus. Somebody get that kid
a sandwich.

415
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:11,615
Comfortable?

416
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:14,868
It's a little big.

417
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,747
You save me any of that schnapps?

418
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,626
Not as much as I should have. Sorry.

419
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,336
Next time.

420
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,506
Mr Stark, how are your levels?

421
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,842
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.

422
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,927
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

423
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,222
but we are ready as we'll ever be.

424
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,224
Agent Carter?

425
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,601
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

426
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,311
- Yes, of course. Sorry.
- Good.

427
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,534
<i>Do you hear me? Is this on?</i>

428
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,619
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

429
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,790
<i>today we take not another step
towards annihilation,</i>

430
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,459
<i>but the first step</i>

431
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,836
<i>on the path to peace.</i>

432
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,216
<i>We begin with a series
of microinjections into</i>

433
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,137
<i>the subject's major muscle groups.
The serum infusion</i>

434
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:18,307
<i>will cause immediate cellular change.</i>

435
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,810
<i>And then, to stimulate growth,</i>

436
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:25,439
<i>the subject will be
saturated with Vita-Rays.</i>

437
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,281
That wasn't so bad.

438
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,241
That was penicillin.

439
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,081
Serum infusion beginning in

440
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:43,499
five,

441
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,542
<i>four,</i>

442
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,003
three,

443
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,923
two,

444
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:53,342
one.

445
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,270
Now, Mr Stark.

446
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:31,672
Steven? Can you hear me?

447
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:35,217
It's probably too late
to go to the bathroom, right?

448
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,387
We will proceed.

449
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:51,900
That's 10%.

450
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,069
Twenty percent.

451
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,612
Thirty.

452
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,324
<i>That's 40%.</i>

453
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,827
Vital signs are normal.

454
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,078
That's 50%.

455
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,872
Sixty.

456
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,833
Seventy.

457
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:13,422
Steven!

458
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,966
- Steven!
- Shut it down!

459
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,343
Shut it down!

460
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,179
Kill the reactor, Mr Stark!

461
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,972
Turn it Off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!

462
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,390
No!

463
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,393
Don't! I can do this!

464
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,359
Eighty.

465
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:36,069
Ninety.

466
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,448
That's 100%.

467
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,971
Mr Stark?

468
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,734
Steven. Steven.

469
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,821
The son of a bitch did it.

470
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:27,621
- I did it.
- Yeah, yeah.

471
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,456
I think We did it.

472
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,749
You actually did it.

473
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,338
How do you feel?

474
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,759
Taller.

475
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,097
You look taller.

476
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,015
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

477
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:51,311
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

478
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:55,941
Congratulations, Doctor.

479
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,734
Thank you, sir.

480
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,455
Stop him!

481
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:17,064
What are you doing?
Buddy, are you all right?

482
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,815
Hey, this guy's been shot!

483
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,078
I had him!

484
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,372
Sorry!

485
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,601
I'm sorry!

486
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,718
No! No! Not my son!

487
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,137
- Stop it!
- Don't hurt him!

488
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,390
Get back!

489
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,893
Let me go!

490
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,355
Let go of my son!

491
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:26,318
Don't hurt him!

492
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,407
Wait, don't! Don't!

493
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,202
No! Don't!

494
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,251
Go get him! I can swim!

495
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:37,764
- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.

496
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:39,849
Cut off one head,

497
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,728
two more shall take its place.

498
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,024
Hail Hydra.

499
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,879
The Fuhrer is not accustomed
to being ignored, <i>Herr</i> Schmidt.

500
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:12,882
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

501
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:14,884
You serve at his pleasure.

502
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,846
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

503
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,473
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

504
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:23,226
I no longer reflect his image
of Aryan perfection.

505
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,729
You think this is about appearances?

506
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:30,233
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver
so much as a rifle in over a year.

507
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:32,736
And we had learned
through local intelligence

508
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,905
you had mounted a full-scale incursion
into Norway.

509
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,907
The Fuhrer feels... How does he put it?

510
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:41,244
"The Red Skull has been indulged
long enough!"

511
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,758
Gentlemen,

512
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:00,847
you have come to see
the results of our work.

513
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:03,433
Let me show you.

514
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,771
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,

515
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,773
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.

516
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:13,193
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

517
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:17,364
but still he is no closer to
achieving his goals.

518
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:20,992
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

519
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:25,538
Science. But I understand
your confusion.

520
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:28,792
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

521
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:33,171
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

522
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,675
wherever they are, regardless of
how many forces they possess,

523
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:37,926
all in a matter of hours.

524
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:39,511
Your enemies?

525
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,263
My weapons contain
enough destructive power

526
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:45,016
to decimate
every hostile capital on Earth.

527
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:49,145
Quite simply, gentlemen,

528
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,607
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

529
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,694
Thank you, Schmidt.

530
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:56,778
For what?

531
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,448
For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.

532
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:01,950
Berlin is on this map!

533
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,452
So it is.

534
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,124
You will be punished for your insolence!

535
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,793
You will be brought
before the Fuhrer himself!

536
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,971
Schmidt...

537
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,853
My apologies, Doctor,

538
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:34,941
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.

539
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:37,318
Hail Hydra.

540
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:39,821
Hail Hydra!

541
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,161
Hail Hydra!

542
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,424
Think you got enough?

543
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:05,096
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

544
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,349
But without Dr Erskine,
it would take years.

545
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,394
He deserved more than this.

546
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:16,274
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

547
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:22,071
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

548
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:23,990
Great. Why don't we start with how

549
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:27,285
a German spy got a ride to
my secret installation in your car?

550
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,870
What have we got here?

551
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:32,040
Speaking modestly, I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

552
00:46:32,332 --> 00:46:35,043
But I don't know what's inside this thing
or how it works.

553
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,961
We're not even close to this technology.

554
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:38,713
- Then who is?
- Hydra.

555
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,715
I'm sure you've been
reading our briefings.

556
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:43,218
I'm on a number of
committees, Colonel.

557
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,512
Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division.

558
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:49,224
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.

559
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:50,517
Hydra is practically a cult.

560
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,227
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

561
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:53,895
So, what are you going to do about it?

562
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:56,231
I spoke to the President this morning.

563
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:59,734
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
- Colonel?

564
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:03,154
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

565
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,572
You, too, Stark.

566
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,574
We're flying to London tonight.

567
00:47:06,658 --> 00:47:08,993
Sir? If you're going after Schmidt,
I want in.

568
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:11,246
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

569
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:12,914
The serum worked.

570
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,833
I asked for an army
and all I got was you.

571
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,044
You are not enough.

572
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,508
With all due respect to the Colonel,

573
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,969
I think we may be missing the point.

574
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:30,640
I've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly, the country's seen it.

575
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:31,975
Paper

576
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,644
The enlistment lines
have been around the block

577
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,938
since your picture hit the newsstands.

578
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:40,567
You don't take a soldier,
a symbol like that,

579
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,610
and hide him in a lab.

580
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:47,031
Son, do you want to serve your country

581
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:50,118
on the most important battlefield
of the war?

582
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,454
Sir, that's all I want.

583
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:57,458
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.

584
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,754
I don't know if I can do this.

585
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:06,509
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

586
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:08,469
You're an American hero.

587
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,847
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

588
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,558
The Senator has got
a lot of pull up on the Hill.

589
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,767
You play ball with us,

590
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,811
you'll be leading your own platoon
in no time.

591
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,438
Take the shield.

592
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:20,815
Go.

593
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,821
<i>Who's strong and brave
Here to save the American way?</i>

594
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,825
Not all of us can storm a beach
or drive a tank.

595
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,619
But there's still a way all of us can fight.

596
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:37,415
<i>Who vows to fight like a man
For what's right, night and day?</i>

597
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,417
Series E Defence Bonds.

598
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,212
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

599
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:46,799
<i>Who will campaign door-to-door
for America ?</i>

604
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:08,696
<i>We can't ignore there's a threat
and a war we must win</i>

605
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,616
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

606

<i>Who'll hang a noose on the

<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

611
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,600
We all know this is about
trying to win the war.

612
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:40,853
We can't do that without bullets
and bandages, tanks and tents.

613
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:43,147
That's where you come in.
Every bond you buy

614
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,524
will help protect someone you love.

615
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:47,485
- Turn around! He's right behind you!
- Keep our boys armed and ready,

616
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,321

trying to get the drop on us.

Bring back the girls!

643

Don't worry, pal. They'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.

Hello, Steve.

Hi.

00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,961
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

647
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,296
Officially, I'm not here at all.

648
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,674
That was quite a performance.

649
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,050
Yeah.

650
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:18,886
I had to improvise a little bit.

651
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,722
The crowds I'm used to
are usually more

652
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,308
twelve.

653
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,310
I understand you're
"America's New Hope."

654
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,980
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state I visit.

655
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,648
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

656
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,318
At least he's got me doing this.

657
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:35,987
Phillips would have had me
stuck in a lab.

658
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,739
And these are your only two options?

659
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,409
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

660
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,745
You were meant for more than this,
you know.

661
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:51,669
What?

662
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:55,882
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about

663
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:59,760
coming overseas
and being on the front lines,

664
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,596
serving my country.

665
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,432
I finally got everything I wanted

666
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,020
and I'm wearing tights.

667
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,113
They look like they've been through hell.

668
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,157
These men more than most.

669
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:29,957
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.
Two hundred men went up against him,

670
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,960
and less than 50 returned.

671
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,297
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

672
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,050
The rest were killed or captured.

673
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:40,843
The 107th?

674
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:41,928
What?

675
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:43,721
Come on.

676
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,765
Colonel Phillips.

677
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,725
Well, if it isn't
the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

678
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,101
What's your plan today?

679
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,394
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

680
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:51,812
You don't get to give me orders, son.

681
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,066
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

682
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,152
You and I are gonna have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.

683
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:01,364
- Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...
- I can spell.

684
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:11,874
I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

685
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,293
But the name does sound familiar.

686
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:15,920
I'm sorry.

687
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,551
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?

688
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,178
Yes, it's called "winning the war."

689
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,223
But if you know where they are,
why not at least...

690
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,058
They're 30 miles behind the lines

691
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,936
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

692
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,521
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

693
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,315
But I don't expect you to understand that
because you're a chorus girl.

694
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:39,986
I think I understand just fine.

695
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,154
Well, then understand it
somewhere else.

696
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:46,701
If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

697
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:54,208
Yes, sir. I do.

698
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:03,301
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

699
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:08,389
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

700
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:09,890
If that's what it takes.

701
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:12,101
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

702
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:13,144
You don't know that.

703
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,229
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...

704
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:18,149
By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.

705
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,275
Steve!

706
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,869
You told me you thought I was meant
for more than this. Did you mean that?

707
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:32,872
Every word.

708
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:35,583
Then you got to let me go.

709
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,005
I can do more than that.

710
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,383
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

711
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,136
Where's my helmet?

712
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,637
Anyone seen Rogers?

713
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:54,518
<i>The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,</i>

714
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:56,645
tucked between
these two mountain ranges.

715
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:57,813
It's a factory of some kind.

716
00:55:57,897 --> 00:56:00,149
We should be able to
drop you right on the doorstep.

717
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,942
Just get me as close as you can.

718
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,694
You two are gonna be
in a lot of trouble when you land.

719
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:04,779
And you won't?

720
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:07,365
Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me,
I can just shoot them.

721
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:09,075
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

722
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:11,160
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

723
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:12,286
Agent Carter?

724
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:13,704
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

725
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:17,333
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne
for a late-night fondue.

726
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:25,424
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.

727
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:28,135
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

728
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,680
So, are you two... Do you...

729
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,267
...fondue?

730
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,646
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready

731
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,148
and the signal will lead us
straight to you.

732
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,110
Are you sure this thing works?

733
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:46,487
It's been tested more than you, pal.

734
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:54,161
Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!

735
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:58,958
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here!

736
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,168
You can't give me orders!

737
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,130
The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!

738
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:26,777
As you can see, production of
the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,

739
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,196
even with components of this size.

740
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,199
Increase the output by 60%

741
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:36,162
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

742
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:41,000
But these prisoners,
I'm not sure they have the strength.

743
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:44,336
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

744
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:47,673
There are always more workers.

745
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:50,843
Not now!

746
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:08,027
You know, Fritz,

747
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,363
one of these days,
I'm gonna have a stick of my own.

748
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:45,606
Fellas.

749
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:48,520
Who are you supposed to be?

750
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:52,149
I'm Captain America.

751
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,860
I beg your pardon?

752
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,074
What, are we taking everybody?

753
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,034
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

754
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:04,953
Is there anybody else? I'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.

755
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:08,248
There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

756
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:09,458
All right.

757
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,585
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

758
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,879
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

759
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,673
I'll meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.

760
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:18,342
Wait. You know what you're doing?

761
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,261
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler
over 200 times.

762
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,038
You know how to use that thing?

763
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,001
Okay.

764
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,797
What is happening?

765
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:07,099
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

766
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,519
- That one. <i>"Zündung."
- Zündung?</i>

767
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,396
Get this thing going, Dugan!

768
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,856
I didn't know you spoke German.

769
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:17,151
Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.

770
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,235
Didn't ask for the resume.

771
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:32,374
- On your left!
- Up top!

772
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,311
No, no! What are you doing?

773
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:56,356
Our forces are outmatched.

774
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,717
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!

775
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,343
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.

776
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:08,428
Bucky?

777
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:10,514
Oh, my God.

778
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,104
- Is that...
- It's me.

779
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,189
- It's Steve.
- Steve?

780
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:20,732
- Come on.
- Steve.

781
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,029
I thought you were dead.

782
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,323
I thought you were smaller.

783
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:37,291
Come on.

784
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,546
- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.

785
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,971
- Did it hurt?
- A little.

786
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:52,723
Is this permanent?

787
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:53,974
So far.

788
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:25,672
Captain America!

789
01:05:25,881 --> 01:05:27,549
How exciting!

790
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:31,053
I am a great fan of your films!

791
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:36,725
So, Dr Erskine managed it after all.

792
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:38,894
Not exactly an improvement,

793
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:42,314
but still, impressive.

794
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:46,568
You've got no idea.

795
01:05:49,655 --> 01:05:50,739
Haven't I?

796
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,424
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

797
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:12,886
you see, I was his greatest success!

798
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,193
You don't have one of those, do you?

799
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,779
You are deluded, Captain.

800
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,116
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

801
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,618
but in reality, you are just afraid

802
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:40,372
to admit that
we have left humanity behind.

803
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:44,876
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

804
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,129
Without fear!

805
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:48,714
Then how come you're running?

806
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,853
Come on, let's go. Up.

807
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,150
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

808
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:12,988
What about me?

809
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,032
Where will I sit?

810
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,367
Not a scratch, Doctor.

811
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:18,994
Not a scratch.

812
01:07:52,027 --> 01:07:54,237
Let's go. One at a time.

813
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:25,894
- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!

814
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,354
No! Not without you!

815
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,606
Hell.

816
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:54,131
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that

817
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:59,010
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing
behind enemy lines on the third.

818
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:01,263
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

819
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:05,350
As a result,
I must declare Captain Rogers

820
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:08,353
killed in action. Period.

821
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:14,109
The last surveillance flight is back.

822
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,530
No sign of activity.

823
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:22,075
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

824
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:25,871
I can't touch Stark.

825
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:28,790
He's rich and he's the Army's
number one weapons contractor.

826
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:30,375
You are neither one.

827
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,961
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

828
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:34,713
And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.

829
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:37,632
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?

830
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:39,509
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

831
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:43,180
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead

832
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:44,264
'cause you had a crush.

833
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,725
It wasn't that. I had faith.

834
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:51,813
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

835
01:09:54,316 --> 01:09:55,650
What the hell's going on out there?

836
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,362
Look who it is!

837
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:09,641
Some of these men
need medical attention.

838
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,643
- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.

839
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:14,354
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

840
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,399
That won't be necessary.

841
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:22,529
Yes, sir.

842
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,532
Faith, huh?

843
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:33,540
You're late.

844
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,087
Couldn't call my ride.

845
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:42,841
Hey!

846
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:44,759
Let's hear it for Captain America!

847
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:05,071
<i>I am honoured
to present this medal for valour</i>

848
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:08,825
to my personal friend, Captain America!

849
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,079
Captain America!

850
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,666
Captain, that's your cue!

851
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,255
I thought he'd be taller.

852
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:37,562
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

853
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,814
And the sixth one was

854
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:45,320
about here, 30, 40 miles west
of the Maginot Line.

855
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,990
I just got a quick look.

856
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:51,659
Well, nobody's perfect.

857
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,332
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

858
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,626
Sergeant Barnes said
that Hydra shipped

859
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,253
all the parts to another facility
that isn't on this map.

860
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:04,005
Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6.

861
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:06,758
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

862
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:07,884
What about us?

863
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,762
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

864
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,847
What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.

865
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:16,559
- You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
- Yes, sir. I'll need a team.

866
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:19,020
We're already putting together
the best men.

867
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:22,190
With all due respect, sir, so am I.

868
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:24,901
So, let's get this straight.

869
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,028
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

870
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:29,989
Pretty much.

871
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:32,409
Sounds rather fun, actually.

872
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,078
I'm in.

873
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:49,050
We're in.

874
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:53,263
Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.

875
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:54,347
What's that?

876
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:57,559
Open a tab.

877
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:02,897
Well, that was easy.

878
01:14:03,231 --> 01:14:05,692
- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?

879
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,906
See? I told you.

880
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:14,534
They're all idiots.

881
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,411
How about you?

882
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,248
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

883
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,666
Hell, no.

884
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:26,254
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

885
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:29,090
I'm following him.

886
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,012
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

887
01:14:36,306 --> 01:14:37,390
You know what?

888
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:40,727
It's kind of growing on me.

889
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:53,281
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.

890
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:56,993
Ma'am.

891
01:14:57,076 --> 01:15:00,038
Howard has some equipment for you
to try. Tomorrow morning?

892
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,456
Sounds good.

893
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:08,880
I see your top squad
is prepping for duty.

894
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:10,298
You don't like music?

895
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,758
I do, actually.

896
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:17,055
I might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.

897
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:18,723
Then what are we waiting for?

898
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:21,226
The right partner.

899
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:23,645
0800, Captain.

900
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:27,148
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

901
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:29,067
I'm invisible.

902
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:32,654
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.

903
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:36,324
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.

904
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,662
Emission signature is unusual.

905
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,164
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

906
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,001
Though I doubt
Rogers picked up on that.

907
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,004
Seems harmless enough.

908
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:53,258
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

909
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,102
Write that down.

910
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,731
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr Stark.

911
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:10,942
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

912
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:18,533
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

913
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:27,125
I read about what you did.

914
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,294
Oh, the... Yeah.

915
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,629
Well, that's, you know.

916
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,674
Just doing what needed to be done.

917
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:37,844
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

918
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:46,144
Really, it's not a big deal.

919
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:49,188
Tell that to their wives.

920
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,152
I don't think they were all married.

921
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:55,903
You're a hero.

922
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,489
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

923
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:01,909
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

924
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:06,039
And seeing as they're not here...

925
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:15,715
Captain!

926
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:18,468
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

927
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,054
Agent Carter, wait.

928
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:23,473
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

929
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:25,183
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

930
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:27,894
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

931
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:31,856
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.

932
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:33,191
Well, what about you and Stark?

933
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:35,777
How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?

934
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:43,034
You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.

935
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,621
<i>Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.</i>

936
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,499
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.

937
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,626
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

938
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:54,087
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

939
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,839
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

940
01:17:56,923 --> 01:17:59,801
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

941
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:01,761
Carbon polymer.

942
01:18:02,428 --> 01:18:04,806
Should withstand
your average German bayonet.

943
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:08,393
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

944
01:18:08,726 --> 01:18:11,479
I hear you're kind of attached.

945
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:12,980
It's handier than you might think.

946
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:15,233
I took the liberty
of coming up with some options.

947
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:16,943
This one's fun.

948
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:20,321
She's been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to...

949
01:18:20,405 --> 01:18:21,989
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.

950
01:18:22,073 --> 01:18:24,242
- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.

951
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:27,954
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

952
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:31,416
It's completely vibration absorbent.

953
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:34,961
How come it's not standard issue?

954
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:36,379
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

955
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,172
What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.

956
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:40,466
You quite finished, Mr Stark?

957
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:42,385
I'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

958
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,429
What do you think?

959
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:56,274
Yes, I think it works.

960
01:19:05,533 --> 01:19:07,702
I had some ideas about the uniform.

961
01:19:07,952 --> 01:19:08,995
Whatever you want, pal.

962
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,497
You are failing!

963
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:20,668
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

964
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,712
yet we are continually delayed

965
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:25,464
because you cannot outwit
a simpleton with a shield!

966
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:27,550
This is hardly my area of expertise.

967
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:31,345
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.

968
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:35,933
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

969
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:37,685
Sir!

970
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:41,022
I'm sorry, <i>Herr</i> Schmidt.

971
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:44,400
We fought to the last man.

972
01:21:47,653 --> 01:21:49,655
Evidently not.

973
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:05,087
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

974
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:06,839
Yeah, and I threw up?

975
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,592
This isn't payback, is it?

976
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,427
Now why would I do that?

977
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,263
We were right. Dr Zola's on the train.

978
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:17,934
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

979
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:19,936
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

980
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:29,403
Let's get going,
because they're moving like the devil.

981
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:31,739
We only got about a 10-second window.

982
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:34,408
You miss that window,
we're bugs on a windshield.

983
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:35,993
Mind the gap.

984
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:37,995
Better get moving, bugs!

985
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,940
Stop him! Fire again!

986
01:24:40,493 --> 01:24:43,120
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.

987
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:44,830
Get down!

988
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,375
Fire again!

989
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:50,669
<i>Kill him! NOW!</i>

990
01:24:57,927 --> 01:24:58,928
Bucky!

991
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:04,475
Hang on!

992
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:07,186
Grab my hand!

993
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,086
Sit down.

994
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,845
- What is this?
- Steak.

995
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:24,930
What is in it?

996
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:27,349
Cow.

997
01:26:30,436 --> 01:26:33,439
Doctor, do you realise how difficult it is

998
01:26:33,522 --> 01:26:36,358
to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?

999
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:39,195
I don't eat meat.

1000
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:41,238
Why not?

1001
01:26:41,322 --> 01:26:43,032
It disagrees with me.

1002
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:46,035
How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?

1003
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:52,124
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive

1004
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:57,046
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

1005
01:26:58,047 --> 01:27:00,883
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1006
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:04,470
You want to live.

1007
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,973
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1008
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:10,184
I bought you dinner.

1009
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:18,484
"Given the valuable information
he has provided

1010
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:22,821
"and in exchange for
his full cooperation,

1011
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:26,116
"Dr Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland"?

1012
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:30,204
I sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.

1013
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:34,500
You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

1014
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,585
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1015
01:27:36,669 --> 01:27:40,256
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.

1016
01:27:40,673 --> 01:27:42,675
You know more about Schmidt
than anyone.

1017
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:48,138
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1018
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:51,183
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

1019
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:54,603
It's you or Schmidt.

1020
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,273
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1021
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,987
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1022
01:28:04,697 --> 01:28:07,491
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1023
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:09,785
You do realise that's nuts, don't you?

1024
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:10,869
What?

1025
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:14,123
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

1026
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,375
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!

1027
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:18,377
What's his target?

1028
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,006
His target

1029
01:28:23,549 --> 01:28:24,633
is everywhere.

1030
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:47,072
Tomorrow,

1031
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:51,160
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1032
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,413
borne to victory on the wings
of the Valkyrie.

1033
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:59,460
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1034
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:05,090
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1035
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,930
If they cut off one head,

1036
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:15,267
two more shall take its place.

1037
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:16,935
Hail Hydra.

1038
01:29:17,186 --> 01:29:18,187
- Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra!

1039
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:21,523
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

1040
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:36,288
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London</i> area.

1041
01:29:36,622 --> 01:29:38,624
<i>Please wait for the all-clear.</i>

1042
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:43,962
<i>Your attention, please. All citizens shall
remain indoors until further notice.</i>

1043
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:47,758
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London</i> area.

1044
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,726
Dr Erskine said that

1045
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,562
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles,

1046
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:02,731
it would affect my cells.

1047
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:07,569
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1048
01:30:07,653 --> 01:30:09,321
Which means

1049
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:13,242
I can't get drunk.

1050
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:16,328
Did you know that?

1051
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:20,999
Your metabolism burns four times faster
than the average person.

1052
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:25,379
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

1053
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:32,344
It wasn't your fault.

1054
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:35,180
- Did you read the report?
- Yes.

1055
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:37,641
Then you know that's not true.

1056
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:39,518
You did everything you could.

1057
01:30:42,855 --> 01:30:45,023
Did you believe in your friend?

1058
01:30:45,107 --> 01:30:46,608
Did you respect him?

1059
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:50,154
Then stop blaming yourself.

1060
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:52,865
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1061
01:30:53,365 --> 01:30:54,700
He damn well must have thought
you were worth it.

1062
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:58,871
I'm going after Schmidt.

1063
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:03,834
I'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra
is dead or captured.

1064
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,379
You won't be alone.

1065
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,177
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

1066
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,220
and he's willing to blow up
half the world to prove it,

1067
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:16,889
starting with the USA.

1068
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:20,100
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1069
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:21,935
He gets across the Atlantic,

1070
01:31:22,019 --> 01:31:24,438
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1071
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:30,486
How much time we got?

1072
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:32,863
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

1073
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,949
- Where is he now?
- Hydra's last base is here.

1074
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:40,245
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1075
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:43,665
So what are we supposed to do?

1076
01:31:43,749 --> 01:31:46,335
I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.

1077
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,295
Why not?

1078
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:55,594
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1079
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:05,307
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,

1080
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,517
but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.

1081
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:13,065
But there are limits

1082
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,734
to what even you can do, Captain.

1083
01:34:16,193 --> 01:34:19,446
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1084
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:20,989
He told me you were insane.

1085
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,663
He resented my genius

1086
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:31,333
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

1087
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:33,043
But he gave you everything.

1088
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:36,713
So,

1089
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:41,093
what made you so special?

1090
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:45,430
Nothing.

1091
01:34:46,598 --> 01:34:48,141
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1092
01:34:59,653 --> 01:35:01,238
I can do this all day.

1093
01:35:01,321 --> 01:35:03,365
Of course you can, of course.

1094
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:06,785
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.

1095
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:13,834
So am I.

1096
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,974
Rogers! You might need this!

1097
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:30,392
Thanks!

1098
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:44,156
We're in! Assault team, go!

1099
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:45,657
Move out!

1100
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:48,326
Move!

1101
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,293
Keep your spacing!

1102
01:36:35,874 --> 01:36:38,043
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1103
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:41,254
Let's go find two more!

1104
01:37:07,948 --> 01:37:08,949
You're late.

1105
01:37:11,952 --> 01:37:13,954
- Weren't you about to...
- Right.

1106
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:29,654
Get in!

1107
01:38:58,308 --> 01:38:59,643
- Keep it steady!
- Wait!

1108
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:06,399
Go get him.

1109
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:10,028
I'm not kissing you!

1110
01:42:49,497 --> 01:42:52,667
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope!

1111
01:44:01,486 --> 01:44:04,113
You could have the power of the gods!

1112
01:44:04,781 --> 01:44:09,452
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations!

1113
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:12,497
I have seen the future, Captain!

1114
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:16,501
- There are no flags!
- Not my future!

1115
01:44:30,348 --> 01:44:31,391
What have you done?

1116
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:33,351
No!

1117
01:45:41,586 --> 01:45:43,713
<i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i>

1118
01:45:43,921 --> 01:45:45,131
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1119
01:45:45,214 --> 01:45:46,632
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1120
01:45:46,716 --> 01:45:48,259
<i>Peggy, Schmidt's dead!</i>

1121
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:50,470
<i>What about the plane?</i>

1122
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:53,806
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1123
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:56,642
Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.

1124
01:45:57,935 --> 01:46:00,063
There's not gonna be a safe landing.

1125
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:01,898
<i>But I can try and force it down.</i>

1126
01:46:01,981 --> 01:46:03,983
I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.

1127
01:46:04,067 --> 01:46:05,068
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

1128
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:07,779
<i>This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.</i>

1129
01:46:12,367 --> 01:46:14,160
I got to put her in the water.

1130
01:46:14,619 --> 01:46:17,330
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

1131
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:18,748
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1132
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:21,292
If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are gonna die.

1133
01:46:26,798 --> 01:46:28,007
Peggy,

1134
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:31,094
this is my choice.

1135
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:56,494
Peggy?

1136
01:46:57,328 --> 01:46:58,663
<i>I'm here.</i>

1137
01:47:01,499 --> 01:47:04,335
I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.

1138
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:13,678
All right.

1139
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:19,058
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

1140
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:21,853
You got it.

1141
01:47:23,729 --> 01:47:27,733
<i>8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late. Understood?</i>

1142
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:32,196
You know,
I still don't know how to dance.

1143
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:41,372
I'll show you how. Just be there.

1144
01:47:42,707 --> 01:47:44,375
We'll have the band
play something slow.

1145
01:47:48,421 --> 01:47:50,047
<i>I'd hate to step on your...</i>

1146
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,051
Steve?

1147
01:47:56,554 --> 01:47:57,889
Steve?

1148
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:02,435
Steve?

1149
01:49:01,452 --> 01:49:02,954
To the Captain.

1150
01:49:15,132 --> 01:49:16,133
Sir?

1151
01:49:26,227 --> 01:49:28,229
Take us to the next grid point.

1152
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:30,565
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1153
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:33,901
And the energy signature stops here.

1154
01:49:34,986 --> 01:49:36,737
Just keep looking.

1155
01:50:45,222 --> 01:50:48,434
<i>Curve ball,
high and outside for ball one</i>

1156
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:51,896
<i>So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.</i>

1157
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:55,149
<i>And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat,</i>

1158
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:58,110
<i>this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.</i>

1159
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:02,740
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.</i>

1160
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:06,744
<i>The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.</i>

1161
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:09,914
<i>But the Dodgers have three men on.</i>

1162
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:17,254
<i>Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.</i>

1163
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:20,508
<i>Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here
to return the favour?</i>

1164
01:51:20,925 --> 01:51:23,094
<i>Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.</i>

1165
01:51:23,427 --> 01:51:26,514
<i>Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.</i>

1166
01:51:28,432 --> 01:51:29,767
<i>Three runs will score.</i>

1167
01:51:30,101 --> 01:51:33,604
<i>Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.</i>

1168
01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:36,941
<i>Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.</i>

1169
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:39,360
Good morning.

1170
01:51:41,362 --> 01:51:43,114
Or should I say afternoon?

1171
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:45,282
Where am I?

1172
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:48,077
You're in a recovery room
in New York City.

1173
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:53,457
<i>The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!</i>

1174
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,626
<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

1175
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:59,296
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

1176
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:00,631
Where am I really?

1177
01:52:01,966 --> 01:52:03,968
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1178
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:06,053
The game.

1179
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:09,140
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.

1180
01:52:13,144 --> 01:52:15,146
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

1181
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:16,647
Where am I?

1182
01:52:17,982 --> 01:52:19,316
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?

1183
01:52:26,949 --> 01:52:28,617
Captain Rogers, wait!

1184
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:32,163
All agents, code 13!

1185
01:52:32,621 --> 01:52:35,499
<i>I repeat. All agents, code 13!</i>

1186
01:52:56,103 --> 01:52:57,688
At ease, soldier!

1187
01:53:06,197 --> 01:53:09,158
Look, I'm sorry about that little show
back there,

1188
01:53:10,451 --> 01:53:13,454
but we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1189
01:53:13,621 --> 01:53:14,955
Break what?

1190
01:53:17,374 --> 01:53:19,043
You've been asleep, Cap.

1191
01:53:19,502 --> 01:53:21,545
For almost 70 years.

1192
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:37,394
You gonna be okay?

1193
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:39,563
Yeah.

1194
01:53:39,897 --> 01:53:41,232
Yeah, I just...

1195
01:53:44,401 --> 01:53:46,028
I had a date.

1196
02:03:07,798 --> 02:03:09,466
Trouble sleeping?

1197
02:03:12,302 --> 02:03:13,637
You're here with a mission, sir?

1198
02:03:14,596 --> 02:03:15,639
I am.

1199
02:03:16,306 --> 02:03:18,141
Trying to get me back in the world?

1200
02:03:19,351 --> 02:03:20,644
Trying to save it.

1201
02:03:29,653 --> 02:03:31,488
<i>You think you're the only hero
in the world?</i>

1202
02:03:45,669 --> 02:03:46,837
Gentlemen?

1203
02:03:47,629 --> 02:03:48,713
You're up.

1204
02:03:54,678 --> 02:03:55,679
Got a mean swing.
