你到这儿多久了

早上就到了

18小时前  一个俄罗斯石油小队发现的
A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago.

12
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,200
之前怎么没发现
How come nobody's spotted it before?

13
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,000
没什么好奇怪的
It's really not that surprising.

14
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,540
这里的地貌一直在变

你知道这到底是什么玩意吗

16
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,170
不知道  可能是个气象气球
I don't know, it's probably a weather balloon.

17
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,460
我觉得不是
I don't think so.

18
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,340
我们没有专用的设备
You know we don't have the equipment for a job like this.

19
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,010
什么时候才能开始挖
How long before we can start craning it out?

20
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,640
我觉得你还没搞清楚
I don't think you quite understand.

21
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,850
你们得要一架终极起重机才行
You guys are going to need one hell of a crane.

22

我才不管现在几点

30

他已经等得够久了

1942年3月  挪威  滕斯贝格市

33
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,890
以前也来过
They have before.

34
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,860
这次不一样
Not like this.

35
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,150
让他们来吧
Let them come.

36
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,690
他们找不到的
They'll never find it.

37
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,370
快打开
Open it.

38
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,490
你们怎么就找不到
Why can't you find it?

39
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,090
我花了很久才找到这里
It has taken me a long time to find this place.

40
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,390
真是不得不称赞你

扶他起来

我想你是个很有远见的人

43
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,930
这点我们很像
And in this way we are much alike.

44
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,070
我们根本不像
I am nothing like you.

45
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,820
是吗  但其他人看做是迷信的东西
Of course but what others see as superstition,

46
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,200
你我却都认为是科学
you and I know to be as science.

47
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,500
你要找的东西并不存在
What you seek is just a legend.

48
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,790
那又何必这么大费周章地藏起来
Then why make such an effort to conceal it?

49
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,940
超立方体是奥丁的瑰宝
The tesseract was the jewel of Odin's treasure room.

50
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,910
这东西不该被藏起来
It's not something one buries.

51
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,080
但我觉得已经很接近了
But I think it is close, yes.

52
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,950
我帮不了你
I cannot help you.

53
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,040
是啊
No.

54
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,710
但也许你能帮帮你的村子
But maybe you can help your, uh village?

55
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
那里一定有你的朋友
You must have some friends out there.

56
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,670
可能还有一些小孩子
Some little grandchildren, perhaps.

57
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,590
我想你不希望他们死

65
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,990
是吧
Have you?

66
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,120
这不是给凡人看的
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

67
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,750

你会下地狱
You will burn.

这可不是打架  史蒂夫  这是打仗
This isn't a back alley, Steve, it's war.

你不会了解这点

178
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,710
我不是想证明什么
This isn't about me.

179
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,750
才怪
Right.

180
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,670
你就是想证明自己

00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,260
不好意思  我们还去跳舞吗

你把傻气都带走了

我感兴趣的不是文件

能接受这种变形吗

241
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,190
在这个装置面前
With this artifact.

242
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,190
我什么都不能确定

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,010
我们的目标
Our goal.

292
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,140
是建立史上最优秀的军队
Is to create the best army in history.

293
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,850
而所有军队都有一个先行者
But every army starts with one man.

294
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,100
罗杰斯  快起来
Rogers! Get up from there.

295
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,140
这周过后  我们就要选出那个人
At the end of this week, we will chose that man.

296
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,810
他将会是第一个
He'll be the first.

297
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,520
我们新一代的超级战士
Our new breed of super soldiers.

298
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,990
罗杰斯  快从那爬出来
Rogers, get your ass out of that line.

299
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,240
而他们  将亲手把阿道夫・希特勒
And they, will personally escort Adolph Hitler

300
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,780
送进地狱
Through the gates of hell.

301
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,950
跟上  姑娘们
Pick up the pace, ladies.

302
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,540
快跑
Let's go, let's go.

303
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,080
跑起来
Double time.

304
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,540
快点  跑快点

动起来
Move.

307
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,880
立定
Squad halt.

308
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,640
这面旗子说明你们只跑了一半
That flag means you're only at the half way point.

309
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,300
第一个拿到旗子的人
First man to bring it to me,

310
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,220
就能和卡特特工一起搭车

快去
Move, move!

312
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,480
快点  爬上去
Come on, get up there.

313
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,900
你们就这点能耐吗  这支部队完了
That's what you got? This army is in trouble.

314
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,320
上去啊  霍奇
Get up there, Hodge.

315
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,480
上啊  爬上去
Come on, get up there.

316
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,610
17年来没人能拿到那面旗子
Nobody's got that flag in seventeen years.

317
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,330
快点  排队
Come on, come on, fall in.

318
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,660
快点  回来排好队
Let's go, get back in a formation.

319
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,250
罗杰斯
Rogers!

320
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,880
我说排队
I said, fall in.

321
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,100
谢了  长官
Thank you, Sir.

322
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,700
快点  姑娘们
Faster ladies, come on.

323
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,590
连我奶奶都比你们强力
My grandmother has more life in her,

324
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,450
上帝保佑她  动起来
God rest her soul. Move it!

325
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,500
你不是真想选罗杰斯吧
You're not really thinking of picking Rogers, are you?

326
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,620
不是想  我已经决定选他了
I am more than just thinking about it.

327
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,830
这是个明智的选择
It is a clear choice.

328
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,000
你当时把个90磅的哮喘病猫
When you brought a 90 pounds

329
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,460
带进我部队的时候
modicum asthmatic onto my army base.

330
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,630
我没反对  我想管他呢
I let it slide. I thought what the hell.

331
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,340
也许你只把他当做小白鼠
Maybe he could be useful to you, like a gerbil.

332
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,470
-我从没想过你会选他  -起来
- Never thought you'd pick him. - Up.

333
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,490
这孩子的胳膊
Stick a needle in that kids arm,

334
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,970
比面条都细
it's going to go right through him.

335
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,970
快点  姑娘们
Come on, girls.

336
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,430
看看他
Look at that.

337
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,100
我看着他都快哭了
He's making me cry.

338
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,440
我更看重品质  而不是体型
I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.

339
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,690
你知道我们为这项目付出多少心血
Do you know how long it took to set up this project.

340
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,480
-我知道  -我还不得不对那些
- Yes. - All the groveling I had to do in front...

341
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,570
天知道叫什么名字的狗屁委员会低声下气
...of Senator whats-his-name committees.

342
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,610
是的  我清楚你付出了多少努力
Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.

343
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,700
那就给我点回报
Then throw me a bone.

344
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,860
霍奇通过了所有测试
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

345
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,160
他强壮  动作又快
He's big, he's fast.

346
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,830
他遵守命令  是个军人
He obeys orders, he's a soldier.

347
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,660
他是个恶霸
He's a bully.

348
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,250
靠善良可打不了胜仗  博士
You don't win wars with niceness, Doctor.

349
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,380
打胜仗  靠的是胆量
You win wars, with guts.

350
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,760
有手榴弹
Grenade!

351
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,390
快跑
Stay away.

352
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,220
躲起来
Get back.

353
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,400
是假手榴弹
Phony grenade.

354
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,690
警报解除  归队
All clear, back in formation.

355
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,820
这是测试吗
Is this a test?

356
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,870
他还是太瘦弱了
He's still skinny.

357
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,790
-我能进来吗  -当然
- May I? - Yeah.

358
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
睡不着吗
Can't sleep?

359
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,720
可能是紧张吧
Got the jitters I guess.

360
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,510
我也是
Oh, me too.

361
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,060
我能问个问题吗
Can I ask you a question?

362
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,470
就一个吗
Just one?

363
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,060
为什么选我
Why me?

364
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,940
只要这一个问题就够了
I suppose that is the one question that matters.

365
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,950
这个产自奥格斯堡[德国城市]
This is from Augsburg.

366
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,410
我的故乡
My City.

367
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,580
很多人都忘了
So many people forget that the

368
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,870
纳粹第一个侵略的就是自己的国家
first country the Nazi's invaded was their own.

369
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,250
一战结束后
You know after the last war they,

370
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,500
我的同胞们生活在水深火热中
my peoples struggled, they..They..

371
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,880
他们感到无能为力
They felt weak, they felt..

372
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,300
然后希特勒出现了
...slow, then Hitler comes along.

373
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,970
军队  党旗  大肆宣扬  各种煽动
With the marching and the big show, and the flags and all that

374
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,970
接着他听说了我
And he, hears of me.

375
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,260
还有我的工作  他找到了我
My work, and he finds me.

376
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,560
他说  你
Then he says, you.

377
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,730
你要让我们变强
He says, you will make us strong.

378
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,230
而我不感兴趣
I am not interested.

379
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,440
他把我送到海德拉总部
So he sends the head of Hydra.

380
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,440
希腊神话中的九头蛇  被砍去一头会长出两个头  后被大力神赫拉克勒斯杀死

381
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,480
东线研究部门
East research division.

382
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,700
有位天才科学家  叫约翰・施密特
A brilliant Scientist by the name of, Johann Schmidt.

383
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,120
现在施密特已经是核心成员了
Now Schmidt is a member of the inner circle.

384
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,910
他野心勃勃
And he's ambitious.

385
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,540
他甚至和希特勒一样
Even Hitler shares his passion for,

386
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,540
痴迷于超能力和大陆神话
occult power and tatanic myth.

387
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,290
希特勒用他的幻想煽动他的追随者
Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers.

388
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,590
而对施密特来说那不是幻想
But for Schmidt it is not fantasy.

389
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,460
对他来说  这是真的
For him, it is real.

390
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,510
他相信在这个世界上
He has become convinced that there is a great power.

391
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,970
隐藏着一股强大的力量
Hidden in the earth.

392
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,010
是众神留下的
Left here by the gods.

393
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,720
有待一个超人去发现
Waiting to be seized by superior men.

394
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,980
所以当他发现我血清配方的能耐
So when he has found my formula and what it can do.

395
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,390
他无法抗拒
He cannot resist.

396
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,230
施密特想成为那个超人
Schmidt wants to become that superior man.

397
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,870
他变强了吗
Did it make him stronger?

398
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,870
是的
Ja.

399
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,700
不过也有副作用
But, it has other effects.

400
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,420
那血清还未完全成熟
The serum wasn't ready.

401
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,540
但更重要的是
But more important.

402
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,800
是使用的人
The man.

403
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,260
血清能增强人的各个方面  所以
The serum amplifies everything that is inside, so..

404
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,340
好的变得更好
Good becomes great.

405
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,010
坏的则变得更坏
Bad becomes worse.

406
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,480
所以我选择了你
This is why you were chosen.

407
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,320
因为强者的力量与生俱来
Because a strong man who has known power all his life.

408
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,150
他们失去了对力量的敬畏
They lose respect for that power.

409
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,360
而弱者
But a weak man.

410
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,950
才懂得力量的价值
Who values of strength.

411
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,700
有爱心
And loves

412
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,530
懂得怜悯
Compassion.

413
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,120
谢谢  虽然不太懂
Thanks. I think.

414
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,040
来喝点
Give this.

415
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,050
不管明天发生什么  答应我一件事
Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing.

416
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,260
永远别忘了你是谁
That you must stay who you are.

417
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,980
不要当一个好兵
Not a perfect soldier.

418
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,640
而要当
But.

419
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,560
一个好人
A good man.

420
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,440
敬小个子们
To the little guys.

421
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,990
慢着  看我做了什么
No, wait, wait. What am I doing?

422
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,620
你明天要进行测试
No, you have procedure tomorrow.

423
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,580
不能喝酒
No fluids.

424
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,950
好吧  那我们以后再喝
All right, we'll drink it after.

425
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,210
不  我明天又不用测试
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.

426
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,710
我不用等  我现在就喝
I can't after, I can now.

427
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,020
你有什么特别需要吗
Is there something in particular you need?

428
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,820
我听说你找到他了
I uh, understand you found him.

429
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,030
你自己看吧
See for yourself.

430
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,920
你不赞成吗
You disapprove.

431
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,380
我只是不明白你为什么要在意他
I just don't see why you need concern yourself.

432
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,630
他不可能成功
I can't imagine he'll succeed.

433
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,640
再次成功
Again.

434
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,300
血清是同盟国最后的防线
The serum is the allies only defense.

435
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,100
来抵抗我们掌握了的力量
against this power we now possess.

436
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,100
若是我们将其摧毁  就能确保胜利
If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.

437
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,610
那我要下令吗
Shall I give the order?

438
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,110
我已经下令了
It has been given.

439
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,740
很好
Good.

440
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,080
佐拉博士
Doctor Zola.

441
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,000
你觉得怎样
What do you think?

442
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,670
杰作
Masterpiece.

443
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,100
这个街区我很熟悉
I know this neighborhood.

444
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,440
我在那条巷子里被打过
I got beat up in that alley.

445
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,070
还有那个停车场
And that parking lot.

446
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,440
还有那个餐厅后面
And behind that dinner.

447
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,490
你为什么不逃跑
Did you have something against running away?

448
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
你要是跑了一次  就会一直跑下去
You start running they'll never let you stop.

449
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,910
而你要是站起来反击
You stand up, push back.

450
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,830
总有一天会有机会的吧
You can't say no forever, right.

451
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,170
我和你有一点同感
I know a little of what that's like.

452
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,040
总是被拒绝的感觉
To have every door shut in your face.

453
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,880
我不明白你为什么要参军
I guess I just don't know why you would want to join the army.

454
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,720
你是位漂亮的女士  我是说漂亮的女人
You're a beautiful dame. Beautifu..Oh a woman. I mean...

455
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,720
是位特工  不是女士
An agent, not a Dame.

456
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,470
你很漂亮
You are beautiful.

457
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,430
你不知道怎么跟女人搭讪吧
You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?

458
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,930
这大概是我和女人的最长一次对话了
I think this is the longest conversation I've had with a woman.

459
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,330
她们才不愿意和一个
They're not exactly lining

460
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,310
会踩到她们脚的男人跳舞
up to dance with a guy that might step on them.

461
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,770
你肯定跳过舞吧
You must have danced.

462
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,690
我不敢邀女人跳舞
Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying.

463
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,740
而这么些年过去
And the past few years just...

464
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,950
我已经不怎么在意了
Didn't seem to matter that much.

465
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,320
我想我在等吧
Figured I'd wait.

466
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,620
等什么
For what?

467
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,620
合适的舞伴
Right partner.

468
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,180
这边走
This way.

469
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,310
我们来这儿干什么
What are we doing here?

470
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,930
跟我来
Follow me.

471
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,900
布鲁克林古董店

472
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,700
今天天气很棒吧
Wonderful weather this morning. Isn't it.

473
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,490
是啊  但我总是带着伞
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

474
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
早上好
Good morning.

475
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,600
拜托  别拍
Please, not now.

476
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
准备好了吗
You ready?

477
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,270
很好
Good.

478
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,150
脱掉衬衣和领带  摘掉帽子
Take off your shirt your tie and your hat.

479
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,620
布兰德议员  很高兴你能来
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

480
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,540
我到底来这儿干什么来了
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

481
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,330
我们需要使用城市电网
We needed access to the cities power grid.

482
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,410
当然如果你之前批准了我的申请
Of course if you had given me a generalized requisition.

483
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,920
很多人都在申请经费
A lot of people are asking for funds, ....

484
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,290
这位是克雷...
Oh, this is Clem uh...

485
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,670
格雷格・克雷姆森  国务院的
Gregg Clemson, state department.

486
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,630
如果你们的项目获得成功
If this project of yours comes through.

487
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,380
我们可不能让媒体抢了先机啊
We'd like to see that it doesn't get into the headlines.

488
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,470
老天爷
Jesus.

489
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,430
给那孩子吃点东西吧
Somebody get that kid a sandwich.

490
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,360
舒服吗
Comfortable?

491
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,900
有点大
It's a little big.

492
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,410
那酒有没有给我留
You save me any of that schnapps?

493
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,040
没留多少
Not as much as I should have.

494
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,580
不好意思  下次吧
Sorry, next time.

495
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,960
史塔克先生
Mr. Stark.

496
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,210
基线如何
How are your levels?

497
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,840
-100%  -很好
- Levels at 100%. - Good.

498
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,300
我们可能会用掉布鲁克林一半电力
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn.

499
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,170
但我们准备好了
But we are ready.

500
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,300
一如既往
Good as we'll ever be.

501
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,260
卡特特工  要是你待在
Agent Carter, don't you think

502
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,430
控制室里会不会更好点
you would be more comfortable in the booth?

503
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,810
好的  抱歉
Oh yes, ah, sorry.

504
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,280
能听到吗
Can you hear me, is this on?

505
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,450
女士们  先生们
Ladies and Gentlemen.

506
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,530
今天我们不是进一步走向灭绝
Today we take not another step towards annihilation.

507
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,290
而是迈上和平之路的第一步
But the first step towards the path to peace.

508
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,000
首先是一系列微创注射
We begin with a series of micro injections,

509
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,420
将血清注入肌肉群
into the subjects major muscles.

510
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,260
血清注入后会引发细胞的急速改变
The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change.

511
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,800
之后会刺激生长
Then to stimulate growth.

512
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,310
接着会通过生命射线
The subject will be saturated,

513
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,020
渗透主体
...with Vita rays

514
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,230
感觉还行
That wasn't so bad.

515
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,240
这只是青霉素
That was penicillin.

516
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,530
注射血清
Serum infusion.

517
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,740
倒计时五秒
Beginning in, five...

00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,810
开始吧  史塔克先生
Now, Mr. Stark.

523
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,370
史蒂文
Steven.

524
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,000
能听到我说话吗
Can you hear me?

525
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,920
现在想去厕所是不是有点晚了
Probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?

526
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,260
继续
We will proceed.

527
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,600
百分之十
That's ten percent.

528
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,690
百分之二十
Twenty percent.

529
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
三十

530
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,240
百分之四十
That's forty percent.

531
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,570
各项指标正常
All signs are normal.

532
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,780
百分之五十
That's fifty percent.

533
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,410
六十
Sixty.

534
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
七十
Seventy.

535
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,380
史蒂文
Steven, Steven.

536
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,750
-快关掉  -史蒂文
- Shut it down! - Steven.

537
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,880
快关掉
Shut it down.

538
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,510
往回转  史塔克先生  关掉  往回转
Turn back, Mr. Stark. Turn it off kill it, turn back.

539
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,880
不
No!

540
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,010
别关
Don't

541
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,760
我扛得住
I can do this.

542
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,400
八十  九十
Eighty...Ninety.

543
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,650
百分之百了
That's one hundred percent!

544
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,220
史塔克先生
Mr. Stark.

545
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,690
这小子还真成功了
Son of a bitch did it.

546
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,410
-我做到了  -是的
- I did it, - Yes, yes.

547
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,280
我们成功了
I think we did it.

548
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,450

00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,750
感觉怎样
How do you feel?

550
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,750
长高了

551
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,550
看起来是高了
You look taller.

552
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,630
下去看看吧  议员先生
How do we look now, Senator?

553
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,220
这下柏林那帮家伙该紧张了
I guess the folks in Berlin are about to get very nervous.

554
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,480
祝贺你

555
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:56,730
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,370
拦住他
Stop him!

557
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,660
-他们来了  快走  -快
- They're coming, come on. - Now.

558
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,430

You all right? Hey!

559
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,810
他中枪了
This guy's been shot.

560
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,990
我瞄准他了
I had him.

561
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,490
抱歉
Sorry.

-妈妈  -不要  别伤害他

565
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,930
走开
Go on.

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,260
放开我
Let me go.

567

00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,190
等等  不要
Wait don't.

569
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,190
不要
Don't.

570
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,950
住手
No, don't.

571
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,790
去抓他  我会游泳
Go get him, I can swim.

572
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,380
你到底是谁
Who the hell are you?

573
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,720
先行军而已
The first of many.

574
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,010
砍掉一个头
Got off one head.

575
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,680
还会长出两个新的
Two more shall take its place.

576
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,140
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra.

577
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,710
元首可不喜欢被无视  施密特先生
The Fürer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.

578
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,590
你承诺为他提供武器  他才资助你的研究
He funds your research because you promised him weapons.

579
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,590
你得听从他的命令
You serve at his pleasure.

580
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,800
因为你负伤  他才将这个研究所给你作为奖励
He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.

581
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,050
奖励  这算什么奖励  这是流放
Reward, call it what it is, exile.

582
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,970
我不再符合他心目中雅利安人的完美形象
I no longer effect his image of Aryan perfection.

583
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,810
你觉得这只是外表的问题吗
You think this is about appearances?

584
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,180
你的海德拉部门让人失望
Your Hydra division has failed,

585
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,810
一年来提供的武器比步枪强不了多少
...to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year.

586
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,190
而且我们从当地情报部门获知
And we have learned through local intelligence.

587
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,360
你们还在策划全面入侵挪威
You have mounted a full scaled incursion into Norway.

588
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,690
元首他担心  他怎么说的来着
The Fürer fears, how does he put it?

589
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,240
不能再继续放纵红骷髅了
The Red Skull has been indulged long enough.

590
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
先生们
Gentlemen.

591
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,430
你们来看看我们的研究成果吧
You have come to see the results of our work, hmm?

592
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,840
我给你们展示一下
Let me show you.

593
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,850
希特勒口口声声说德意志千秋万代
Hitler speaks of a thousand year Reich.

594
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,560
事实上却拿不出军队一个月的给养
But he cannot feed his armies for a month is truth.

595
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,350
他的部队在欧洲战场上流血牺牲
His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe.

596
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,570
可他的目标却还是遥遥无期
But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.

597
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,070
这么说你想用魔法来打赢战争
And I suppose you still aim to win this war through magic.

598
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,370
是科学  但我理解你的困惑
Science, but I understand your confusion.

599
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:28,580
强大的力量总是令愚昧之人感到迷惑
Great power has always baffled primitive men.

600
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,500
海德拉正在组建一支军队
Hydra is assembling an arsenal

601
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,120
能将我的敌人一网打尽
that will destroy my enemies in one stroke.

602
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,210
不管他们是谁  拥有多少兵力
Wherever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess.

603
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:37,670
只需几个小时就能搞定
All in a matter of hours.

604
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,170
你的敌人吗
Your enemies?

605
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,840
我的武器具有足够破坏力
My weapons contain enough destructive power,

606
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,970
能摧毁世界上所有敌国的首都
...to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.

607
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,680
轻而易举  先生们
Quite simply, gentlemen.

608
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,140
我已从诸神那里获得神力
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

609
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,610
谢谢  施密特
Thank you, Schmidt.

610
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,730
谢什么
For what?

611
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,780
让我们明白你有多疯狂
For making it clear how obviously mad you are.

612
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,690
柏林也在地图上
Berlin is on this map!

613
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,570
当然了
So it is.

614
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,370
你要为你的傲慢付出代价
You will be punished for your insolence.

615
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,910
你要被带到元首面前...
You will be brought before the Fürer and ....

616
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,310
抱歉了  博士
My apologies, Doctor.

617
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:34,390
但我们都知道  在希特勒的阴影下  海德拉无法壮大
But we both knew Hydra could grow no further in Hitler's shadow.

618
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,270
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra.

619
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,230
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra!

620
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,280
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra.

621
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,580
可以了吗
Think you got enough?

622
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,870
重新制造血清的方法
Any hope of reproducing

623
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:04,300
锁进了你的基因序列
the program is locked in your genetic code

624
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,510
没有厄斯金博士  这得花上好多年
But without Erskine it would take years.

625
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,680
他不该就这么死了
He deserved more than this.

626
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,060
就算只成功了这么一次
If it could work only once.

627
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,480
他也会以你为傲
He'd be proud of you.

628
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:21,770
菲利普斯上校  委员会需要答复
Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.

629
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,400
好啊  那你先说说怎么有个德国间谍
Great, why don't we start with how a German spy,

630
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,110
坐在你车上混进了我的秘密基地
..Got a ride to my secret installation in your car?

631
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,110
情况怎么样
What do we got here?

632
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,670
虽然我是本国
Speaking modestly I'm the

633
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,620
最好的机械工程师
best mechanical engineer in this country.

634
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,750
但我也搞不清这东西的构造
But I don't know what's inside this thing.

635
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:34,750
还有它如何运转
Or how it works.

636
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,750
我们连这项技术的皮毛都没摸清
We're not even close to this technology.

637
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,750
那谁清楚
Then who is?

638
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:40,710
海德拉  你应该看过我们的简报了
Hydra, I'm sure you've been reading our briefings.

639
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,050
我还有很多事要忙  上校
I'm on a number of committees, Colonel.

640
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,340
海德拉是纳粹的秘密科研部门
Hydra is a Nazi Deep science division.

641
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,880
由约翰・施密特领导
It's led by Johann Schmidt.

642
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,630
不过他有更大的野心
But he has much bigger ambitions.

643
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,120
海德拉其实是个邪教组织
Hydra's practically a cult,

644
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,430
他们把施密特奉为神  认为他无所不能
they worship Schmidt, they think he's invincible.

645
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,680
那你打算怎么做
So what are you going to do about it?

646
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,140
今天早上我和总统通过话
I spoke to the President this morning.

647
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,900
从今天起  战略科学部门有了新任务
As of today, the S.S.R. is being retasked.

648
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,060
-上校  -我们要和海德拉决一死战
- Colonel? - We are taking the fight to Hydra.

649
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,900
收拾行李  卡特特工
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

650

651
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,990
我们今晚就飞往伦敦
We're flying to London tonight.

652
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,240
先生
Sir.

653
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,030
如果你们要对付施密特  我也要加入
If you're going after Schmidt, I want in.

654
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,820
你是个实验品  你得去阿拉莫多[美国城市]
Your an experiment, you're going to Alamogordo.

655
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,580
血清起作用了
The serum worked.

656
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,830
我要的是一支军队  结果却只有你
I asked for an army, and all I got was you.

657
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,200
你一个人
You.

658
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,790
还远远不够
You're not enough.

659
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,540
不是我对上校有意见
With all due respect to the Colonel.

660
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:25,550
我觉得我们没看到重点
I think we may be missing the point.

661
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,670
我看到了你的能力  史蒂夫
I've seen you in action, Steve.

662
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,430
更重要的是
More importantly.

663
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:30,680
整个国家都看到了

664
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,680
拿报纸来
Paper.

665
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,900
自从你的事迹登报后
The enlistment lines have been

666
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,270
纽约参考报
纽约惊现纳粹  神秘人拯救儿童

667
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,270
大街上排满了想入伍的人
around the block since your picture hit the news stands.

668
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,850
你可不能让一个偶像级人物
You don't take a soldier, a symbol like that.

669
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,110
藏在实验室里
And hide him in a Lab.

670
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,560
孩子
Son.

671
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,980
你在最重要的战场
You want to serve your country.

672
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,900
为国家效力吗
On the most important battlefield of the war.

673
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,910
长官
Sir.

674
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,370
我求之不得
That's all I want.

675
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,160
那恭喜你
Then congratulations.

676
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,200
你升官了
You just got promoted.

677
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,370
我不知道我行不行
I don't know if I can do this.

678
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,500
这没什么大不了

682
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,130
我只是觉得这我想的不一样
It's just I don't think I'm getting there.

683
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,180
参议员他很有势力
The senator's got a lot of pull up on the hill.

684
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,550
你和我们一起好好干
You play ball, with us.

685
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:16,390
很快就能领导自己的队伍了
You'll be leading your own platoon in no time.

686
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,890
那才是你

687
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
上吧

开动坦克

691
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,740
但我们仍然可以战斗

好了  别看镜头

我们不能忘记  还存在巨大威胁

716
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,860
看看他是怎么打败敌人的吧
See how this guy can shoot!

717
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,790
我们都知道没有候补人员
We can tell that there's no substitute.

718
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:07,670
他很坚强并时刻准备好保护美国
Forceful and ready to defend the Red, White and Blue!

719
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,380
谁将会打败轴心国  谁和狐狸一样聪明
Who'll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox?

720
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,260
我们会像雄鹰一样高飞
Far as an eagle we'll soar.

721
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,760
谁让纳粹不敢踏出自己的地盘
Who's making Adolph afraid to step out of his bunk?

722
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,640
他知道我们为何而战
He knows what we're fighting for.

723
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,480
我们唤醒了沉睡的巨人
Who waked the giant that napped in America?

724
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,110
我们知道  他就是美国队长
We know it's no one but, Captain America.

725
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,570
谁将完成我们的使命
Who'll finish what they began?

726
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,900
谁将把鬼子踢回日本
Who'll kick the krauts to Japan?

727
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,820
星光闪烁的男人
The Star Spangled Man.

728
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:43,330
胸怀
With the...

729
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:49,080
计划
Plaaaaaaaaaan.

730
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,510
你们准备好和我一起去修理希特勒了吗
How many of you are ready to help me sock ol' Adolph on the jaw?

731
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,720
好吧
Okay.

732
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,690
1943年11月  意大利
距前线五英里处

733
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,690
有志愿者吗
I need a volunteer.

734
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:11,360
不志愿的话我们在这干嘛
We already volunteered, how do you think I got here?

735
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,190
我们要看妹子
Bring back the girls.

736
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:19,860
我想她们只唱一首歌
I think they only know the one song.

737
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,870
但是
But, um...

738
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,410
我看看我能做什么
Let me...I'll see what I can do.

739
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,830
去吧  甜心
You do that, sweetheart.

740
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,710
你的靴子不错  小仙女
Nice boots, Tinkerbell.

741
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,330
拜托  伙计们
Come on guys.

742
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,090
我们是一队的
We're all on the same team here.

743
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,210
队长
Hey, Captain.

744
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,420
在这签个名吧
Sign this.

745
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,690
别在意  他们会喜欢你的
Don't worry about it, they'll warm up to you. Don't worry.

746
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,280
你好  史蒂夫
Hello Steve.

747
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,160
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

748
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,370
我其实不该来这
Officially I'm not here at all.

749
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,580
你的表演不错
That was quite a performance.

750
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,000
是啊
Yeah, uh...

751
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,340
我得即兴表演一下
I had to improvise a little bit.

752
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,840
我以前的观众通常都是...
The crowds I'm used to are usually are, uh...

753
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,810
-小孩  -我知道你是美国的新希望
- twelve. - I understand you're America's new hope.

754
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,640
我每到一个州国债销售额就上升百分之十
Bond sales take a ten percent bump on every state I visit.

755
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,060
听起来是布拉德参议员的主意
That's Senator Brandt's idea.

756
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,230
至少他还让我做这些
At least he's got me doing this.

757
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,860
菲利普斯还想把我关在实验室里
Phillips would have had me stuck in a lab.

758
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,610
你只有这两个选择吗
And these are you only two options?

759
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,610
实验室小白鼠或是跳舞的猴子
A lab rat or a dancing monkey.

760
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,410
要知道  你能做的远不止这些
You were meant for more than this, you know.

761
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,080
怎么了
What?

762
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,460
我长久以来的梦想
You know, for the longest time I dreamed about,

763
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,050
就是去国外战场
...coming over seas and...

764
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,590
到最前线
..Being on the front lines.

765
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,880
为我的国家效力
Serving my country.

766
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,430
等到我终于如愿以偿
Finally got everything I wanted.

767
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:08,810
却是穿着紧身衣
And I'm wearing tights.

768
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:18,480
他们好像刚打了一场恶仗
Look like they've been through hell.

769
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,190
这些士兵最惨
These men move the most.

770
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,160
施密特派出了一支部队
Schmidt sent out a force to a zone.

771
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:29,740
两百名士兵去迎战
200 men went up against him.

772
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,910
回来的不到五十个
Less than 50 returned.

773
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,920
你的观众里就有107步兵团的人
Your audience contained what was left of the 107th.

774
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,420
其他人的不是被杀就是被俘
The rest were killed or captured.

775
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,090
107步兵团
The 107th?

776
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,760
怎么了
What?

777
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,090
快来
Come on.

778
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,430
菲利普斯上校
Colonel Phillips.

779
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,050
这不是胸前顶着星星藏着计划的男人嘛
Well, if it isn't the Star Spangled Man with the plan.

780
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,640
你今天有什么计划呀
What is your plan today?

781
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,180
我要博尔扎诺战役的伤亡名单
I need the causality list from Bolzano.

782
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,600
你没资格命令我  小子
You don't get to give me orders, son.

783
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,480
我只想知道107步兵团的詹姆斯・巴恩斯中士的情况
I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

784
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,940
等我之后再找你算账
You and I are going to have a conversation later that you won't enjoy.

785
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,690
拜托你告诉我他还活着  B A R
Please tell me he's alive, sir. B-A-R...

786
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:00,690
我知道怎么拼
I can spell.

787
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,140
我今天签了很多哀悼信
I've signed more of these

788
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,790
名字我都记不清了
condolence letters today than I would care to count.

789
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,660
但是
But...

790
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,040
这个名字我有印象
The name does sound familiar.

791
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,500
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

792
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,630
那其他人呢
What about the others?

793
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,420
你们准备去营救吗
Are you planning a rescue mission?

794
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,840
必须以大局为重
Yeah, it's called winning the war.

795
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,930
但既然你知道他们在哪  为什么...
But if you know where they are, why not...

796
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,180
他们在敌阵后方三十英里
They're thirty miles behind the lines.

797
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,600
得穿过欧洲戒备最森严的地区
Through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe.

798
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,350
去营救只会损失更多人
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

799
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:34,680
我不指望你能理解这些
I don't expect you to understand that,

800
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,100
因为你只是个跳舞的小丑
because you're a chorus girl.

801
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,560
我想我能理解
I think I understand just fine.

802
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,440
那去其他地方理解吧
Well then understand it somewhere else.

803
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,980
如果我没看错海报的话
If I read the posters correctly,

804
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,610
你得在三十分钟内赶到其他地方
you've got someplace to be in thirty minutes.

805
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,080
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

806
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,700
我会的
I do.

807
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:58,910
如果你有什么想说
If you have something to say,

808
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:00,880
现在最好别说
right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

809
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,130
你有什么计划  走去奥地利吗
What do plan to do, walk to Austria.

810
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,260
如果可以的话
If that's what it takes.

811
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,800
你听到上校说的了  你朋友可能已经死了
You heard the Colonel, your friend is most likely dead.

812
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,970
但不能确定
You don't know that.

813
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,560
即便如此  制定计划需要时间
Even so, he's devising a strategy, it takes time.

814
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,190
等他计划好了就已经晚了
By the time he's done that, it could be too late.

815
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:18,900
史蒂夫
Steve.

816
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,070
你说过我能做的远不止这些
You told me you thought I was meant for more than this.

817
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,740
是真的吗
Did you mean that?

818
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,030
千真万确
Every word.

819
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,500
那就让我去
Then you gotta let me go.

820
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,920
我能做的不止这点
I can do more than that.

821
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,380
上台了  姑娘们
On stage, girls.

822
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,550
我的头盔呢
Where's my helmet?

823
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,260
有人看到罗杰斯吗
Anyone seen Rogers?

824
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,430
海德拉军营在克劳斯堡
The Hydra camp is in Krossberg.

825
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,430
在两座山脉之间
It's up between these two mountain ranges.

826
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:57,600
就像一个工厂
It's a factory of some kind.

827
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,770
我们会把你送到门口
We should be able to drop you around the doorstep.

828
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,270
尽可能地接近目标
Just get me as close as you can.

829
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:02,370
你们着陆后
You know you two are going

830
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,730
会有很多麻烦
to be in a lot of trouble when you land.

831
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,530
-你不也是  -我要是遇到麻烦
- And you won't. - Where I'm going if any anybody,

832
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,110
开枪打他们就行
...yells at me I can just shoot them.

833
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,650
他们也会开枪打你
And they will undoubtedly shoot back.

834
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,820
那就指望这玩意有用吧
Well lets hope this is good for something.

835
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,030
卡特特工
Agent Carter.

836
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,410
如果你不是那么赶时间
If you're not in too much of a hurry I thought

837
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:16,370
我想我们过会可以去享受一下芝士火锅
we could stop off in Usurea for a late night Fondue.

838
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,000
史塔克是我见过最好的平民飞行员
Stark is the best civilian pilot I've ever seen.

839
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,760
只有他敢在这种气候起飞  有他在是我们走运
He's mad enough to brave this air space. We're lucky to have him.

840
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,550
所以你们俩
So you two?

841
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,550
你真要去
Do you?

842
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,720
芝士火锅吗
Fondue?

843
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:38,220
这是收发器  准备好就启动
This is your transponder, active it when you're ready.

844
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,180
我们会根据信号找到你
And the signal will lead us straight to you.

845
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,980
你确定这管用吗
Are you sure this thing works?

846
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,520
它测试的次数比你还多  伙计
It tested more than you, pal.

847
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,610
回来  我们要把你送到门口
Get back here, we're taking you all the way there.

848
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,590
我要跳了
I'm jumping this plane,

849
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,700
你们赶紧掉头离开这鬼地方
turn this thing around and get the hell out of here.

850
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,370
你不能命令我
You can't give me orders.

851
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,120
我当然可以
The hell I can't.

852
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:03,580
我是队长
I'm a Captain.

853
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,190
正如你所见
As you can see.

854
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,020
瓦尔基里正按计划在建造中
Production of Valkyrie is progressing on schedule.

855
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:28,150
即使是这种大小的零件
Even with components of this size.

856
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:31,940
将进度提高百分之六十
Increase the output by sixty percent.

857
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:35,450
其他研究所也一样
And speak with our other facilities to do the same.

858
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,370
但这些都是囚犯  我想他们没这力气
But these prisoners, I'm not sure they have the strength.

859
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,500
那就用尽他们的力气  博士
Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor.

860
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,790
工人永远都不会缺
There are always more workers.

861
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,420
现在别烦我
Not now.

862
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,360
告诉你  德国佬
You know, Fritz.

863
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,110
总有一天  老子也会有根棍子
One of these days I'm going to have a stick of my own.

864
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,140
伙计们
Fellas.

865
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,310
你是谁
Who are you suppose to be?

866
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,770
美国队长
Captain America.

867
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,020
你说啥
I, beg your pardon?

868
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,610
怎么着  所有人都走吗
What are we taking, everybody?

869
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,950
我来自夫勒斯诺  帅哥
I'm from Fresno, ace.

870
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,030
还有其他人吗
There anybody else?

871
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,820
我在找詹姆斯・巴恩斯中士
I'm looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.

872
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,620
工厂里有个隔离病房
There's an isolation ward in the factory.

873
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,790
被带去那的人都没回来
No one's ever come back from it.

874
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:08,830
好吧
All right.

875
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,540
林木线在西北方  离大门八十码
The tree line is northwest, it's eighty yards past the gate.

876
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,000
你们出去  给他们点颜色看看
Get out fast, and give them hell.

877
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,630
我找到其他人后和你们会合
I'll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.

878
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,710
等等  你知道你在做什么吗
Wait. You know what you're doing?

879
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:20,590
当然  我揍了阿道夫・希特勒两百多次了
Yeah. I knocked out Adolph Hitler over 200 times.

880
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:46,910
你知道怎么用吗
You know how to use that thing?

881
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,160
好吧
Okay.

882
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,170
怎么回事
What is happening?

883
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,260
这货可不是别克
Not exactly a Buick.

884
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,060
-这是点火器  -啥
- That's Zündung. - Zündung?

885
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,390
快启动
Get going, Dum Dum.

886
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,480
我不知道你还会说德语
I didn't know you spoke German.

887
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,040
最近在勒阿弗尔学的
I recently mastered at Le Havre.

888
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,650
顺便  法国妞正点多了
Plus the French girls much cuter.

889
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:18,150
这还用说吗
That's the resume.

890
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:51,560
不  你在干什么
No, no, what are you doing?

891
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,350
我们的士兵不是对手
Our forces are out matched.

892
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:21,540
继续走
Keep moving.

893
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,880
拿手榴弹
Grab a grenade.

894
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:07,760
鹿仔
Bucky.

895
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,300
我的天
Oh my God.

896
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,930
是我  史蒂夫
It's me, it's Steve.

897
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:19,310
史蒂夫
Steve.

898
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:20,560
-来  -史蒂夫
- Come on. - Steve.

899
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,820
我还以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

900
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:28,150
我还以为你更矮
I thought you were smaller?

901
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,200
快来
Come on.

902
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,830
你是怎么回事
What happened to you?

903
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:41,960
我加入了军队
I joined the army.

904
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:49,720
痛吗
Did it hurt?

905
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,720
有点
A little.

906
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,680
-会一直痛吗  -目前为止还在痛
- Permanent? - So far.

907
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,250
美国队长
Captain America.

908
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,960
我真激动
How exciting.

909
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,630
我可是你的粉丝
I am a great fan of your films.

910
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:36,390
这么说厄斯金博士还是成功了
So Doctor Erskine managed it after all.

911
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:40,770
虽然没什么进步  但是
Not exactly an improvement, but, still.

912
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,020
还是很不错
Impressive.

913
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,520
你等着瞧吧
You've got no idea.

914
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,530
是吗
Haven't I.

915
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,420
不管厄斯金对你说了什么
No matter what lies Erskine told you.

916
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:12,170
我才是他最成功的成果
You see I was his greatest success.

917
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:27,980
你没有变成这鬼模样吧
You don't have one of those, do you?

918
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:30,230
你被骗了  队长
You are deluded, Captain.

919
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,780
你假装自己是个普通士兵
You pretend to be a simple soldier.

920
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,780
但你却不敢承认现实
But in reality you are just afraid to admit,

921
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,410
我们都已经不是人类了
...that we have left humanity behind.

922
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:43,250
像我们这种人
Men like you.

923
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,120
应该对自己的力量感到自豪
They embrace it proudly.

924
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,330
无所畏惧
No fear.

925
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:48,460
那你为什么要跑
Then how come you're running?

926
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,970
来  我们走
Come on, let's go.

927
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:07,850
先生  我们去楼顶吗
Sir, we go to the roof?

928
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,610
那我怎么办
What about me?

929
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,530
那飞机只能坐一个人
Where will I sit?

930
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,200
别划花我的车  博士
Not a scratch, Doctor.

931
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,740
记住了
Not a scratch.

932
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,360
来  我们一个个过去
Let's go. One at a time.

933
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,850
这儿肯定有绳子
Gotta get a rope or something.

934
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,640
走吧  快离开这儿
Just go, get out of here.

935
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,140
我不会丢下你一个人走
No, not without you.

936
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:53,960
布兰德议员  很遗憾地告知您
Senator brandt, I regret to inform you,

937
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,380
史蒂文 G. 罗杰斯队长
Captain Stephen G. Rogers

938
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:56,800
在敌后第三区域失踪
went missing behind enemy lines,

939
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:02,470
侦察队搜索过后也没有结果
on the third area. Reconnaissance has proven unfruitful as a result,

940
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,220
我只能宣布罗杰斯队长
...I must declare Captain Rogers,

941
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,140
在行动中阵亡
...killed in action. Period.

942
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:13,730
最后一架侦察机回来了
The last surveillance flight is back.

943
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:17,860
没有生命迹象
No sign of activity.

944
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,950
去喝杯咖啡吧  下士
Go get a cup of coffee, corporal.

945
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,580
我们不能拿史塔克怎么样  他是富豪
We can't touch Stark, he's rich.

946
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:29,370
也是军队最大的武器赞助商
And he's the army's number one weapons contractor.

947
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,000
-而你什么也不是  -恕我直言  长官
- You are neither one. - With respect, sir.

948
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,460
我不后悔我的行为
I don't regret my actions.

949
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,790
我认为罗杰斯队长也不后悔
And I don't think Captain Rogers did, either.

950
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:37,170
你觉得我在意你的想法吗
What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions.

951
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:39,260
我给过你机会  卡特特工
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

952
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,650
而现在美国的黄金男孩死了
And now America's golden boy,

953
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:42,430
还有很多优秀的士兵
and a lot of other good men are dead.

954
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,430
就因为你喜欢人家
'Cause you had a crush.

955
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,430
不是
It wasn't that.

956
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,800
我是有信念
I had faith.

957
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:49,140
那等到这个部门被关闭的时候
Well I hope that's a big comfort to you,

958
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,770
希望你的信念能给你点安慰
...when they shut this division down.

959
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:53,440
他们回来了  真不敢相信
There they are, I can't believe it.

960
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,690
那边在搞什么飞机
What the hell's going on out there?

961
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,140
他们有些人需要医治
Some of these men need medical attention.

962
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,180
医生  我受伤了
Medic, I got wounded.

963
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,100
我愿意接受处分
I'd like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.

964
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,980
没这必要
That won't be necessary.

965
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:22,230
是  长官
Yes, Sir.

966
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:24,940
信念哈
Faith, huh?

967
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:32,740
你迟到了
You're late.

968
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:38,620
这玩意坏了
Couldn't call my ride.

969
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:44,840
为美国队长欢呼
Let's hear it for, Captain America.

970
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,020
我荣幸地在此
I am honored to present,

971
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,480
将这个英勇奖章
...this medal for valor.

972
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,360
颁给我的好朋友
To my personal friend.

973
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,990
美国队长
Captain America.

974
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,330
美国队长
Captain America?

975
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,790
队长  该你出场了
Captain, that's your cue.

976
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,040
我还以为他更高点
I thought he'd be taller.

977
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,350
一个在波兰和波罗的海
This one here in Poland, and the Baltic.

978
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,270
第六个在...
and the sixth one was...

979
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:40,980
大概
about...

980
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,150
在这  离边境三四十英里
...here. 30, 40 miles west of the maginal line.

981
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,990
我只大概看了一眼
I just got a quick look.

982
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,820
没人能做到十全十美
Well nobody's perfect.

983
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:56,290
这些是我们已知的武器工厂
These are the weapon factories we know about.

984
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:58,570
据巴恩斯中士说
Sergeant Barnes said that

985
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:00,790
海德拉把所有装备都运到了另一个地方
Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility,

986
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:01,790
而在地图上没有
...that isn't on this map.

987
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,580
卡特特工在和军情六处协商
Agent Carter co-ordinate with MI6.

988
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,550
我要每个同盟国都去找海德拉总部
I want every allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.

989
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:07,550
那我们呢
What about us?

990
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,130
我们去给约翰・施密特一个下马威
We are going to set a fire under Johann Schmidt's ass.

991
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,550
怎么样  罗杰斯
What do say, Rogers?

992
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,390
你背出了地图  你觉得你能搞定海德拉吗
It's your map. You think you can wipe Hydra off of it?

993
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,390
是的  长官
Yes, Sir.

994
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,680
我需要一支队伍
I'll need a team.

995
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,640
我们已经有了最出色的士兵
We're already putting together the best men.

996
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:20,310
恕我直言  长官
With all due respect, Sir.

997
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,020
我也有
So am I.

998
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:24,690
那我们直话直说吧
So let's get this straight.

999
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:26,940
我们好不容易逃出来  你又想让我们去吗
We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?

1000
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,400
差不多
Pretty much.

1001
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:32,450
貌似听起来很有趣
Sounds rather, fun actually.

1002
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,780
我加入
I'm in.

1003
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,960
我们也加入
We're in.

1004
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,220
日啊我也去
Hell, I'll always play.

1005
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:53,130
但你得为我做一件事
But you gotta do one thing for me.

1006
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,140
什么事
What's that?

1007
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,430
请客喝酒
Open a tab.

1008
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,190
这容易
Well that was easy.

1009
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,560
再来一轮
Another round.

1010
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,400
他们怎么喝得下这么多
Where are they putting all this stuff?

1011
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,570
看吧  告诉过你
See, told you.

1012
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,570
他们都是笨蛋
They are all idiots.

1013
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,740
那你呢
What about you?

1014
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:20,160
你准备跟随美国队长去赴汤蹈火吗
You ready to follow Captain America into the jowls of death?

1015
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,160
当然不
Hell, no.

1016
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,960
那个和我一样从布鲁克林来的小个子
That little guy from Brooklyn. I was too.

1017
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,710
打起架来从不放弃
Don't like to run away from a fight.

1018
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:28,420
我得看着他
I'm following him.

1019
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,130
你还穿紧身衣吗
Hey, you keeping your outfit, right?

1020
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:37,430
知道吗
You know what?

1021
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:37,930
巡演取消

1022
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,100
我还真习惯了
It's kinda growing on me.

1023
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:43,940
好哥们要记住  天下没有不散的宴席
And remember that the best of friends must part, must part

1024
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,310
再见  再见了
Adieu, adieu...

1025
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,240
-队长  -卡特特工
- Captain. - Agent Carter.

1026
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:56,700
女士
Ma'am.

1027
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,530
霍华德为你准备了些新装备
Howard has some equipment for you to try.

1028
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:00,790
-明早去看看  -听起来不错
- Tomorrow morning. - Sounds good.

1029
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,130
看来你的精英部队已经准备好了
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.

1030
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,210
你不喜欢音乐吗
You don't like music?

1031
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:11,630
我喜欢
I do, actually.

1032
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:15,380
没准等战争结束
I might even, when this is all over,

1033
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,470
我还会去跳个舞
...go dancing.

1034
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,970
那我们还等什么
Then what are we waiting for?

1035
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:20,760
合适的舞伴
The right partner.

1036
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:23,640
记住明天  队长
Pay attention, Captain.

1037
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,730
是的  女士
Yes, Ma'am.

1038
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:26,730
我会来的
I'll be there.

1039
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:28,440
我小透明了
I'm invisible.

1040
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,770
这下换成我了
I'm turning into you.

1041
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,110
感觉真不好受
It's a horrible dream.

1042
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:33,860
别想太多
Don't take it so hard.

1043
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,530
也许她还有个闺蜜
Maybe she's got a friend.

1044
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:40,120
初始特征不同寻常
Initial signature is unusual.

1045
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,330
初始阶段一直是中性
Alpha beta remain neutral.

1046
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,250
难怪罗杰斯能承受住
No doubt Rogers picked up on that.

1047
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:49,880
看上去倒是挺无害
Seems harmless enough.

1048
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,090
不像有什么值得担心的样子
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

1049
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:03,720
把这记下来
Write that down.

1050
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,520
打扰一下  我找史塔克先生
Excuse me. I'm looking for a Mr. Stark.

1051
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:08,520
四百余俘虏被解救

1052
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,060
他跟菲利普斯上校在里面
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

1053
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:18,110
想等的话当然也欢迎
Oh, of course you're welcome to wait.

1054
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,120
我
I uh,

1055
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,750
在报上看到你的所作所为
Read about what you did.

1056
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,080
那事儿...
Oh, that...yeah.

1057
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,170
那件事...
Well that's, you know...

1058
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,380
略尽绵力而已
Just doing what needed to be done.

1059
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,880
说话还真谦虚
Sounded like more than that.

1060
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,550
你差不多救了四百人
You saved nearly 400 men.

1061
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,770
说真的  没什么大不了
Really, it's not a big deal.

1062
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,640
对他们的老婆来说可不是
Tell that to their wives.

1063
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,860
我觉得不是所有人都结婚了
Uh, I don't think they were all married.

1064
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,020
你是个英雄
You're a hero.

1065
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:56,730
那个嘛...
Well, that...you know.

1066
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:58,400
取决于你怎么定义...
Tha..That depends on the definition of...

1067
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,780
而美国的女人
And the Women of America.

1068
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:01,410
都欠你的情
They owe you their thanks.

1069
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,700
而既然她们不在这儿
And um, seeing as they're not here.

1070
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,500
队长
Captain!

1071
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,130
大家都在等你  没事要忙的话就快来
We're ready for you. If you're not otherwise occupied.

1072
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:20,760
卡特特工  等等
Agent Carter, wait.

1073
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,140
看来找个伴也没什么难
Looks like finding a partner wasn't that hard after all.

1074
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:24,930
不是你想的那样
Hey, that's not what you thought it was.

1075
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:27,390
我什么都没想  队长  完全没有
I don't think anything, Captain. Not one thing.

1076
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,930
你一直想成为军人  如今得偿所愿
Always wanted to be a soldier, and now you are.

1077
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,190
就跟其他人没什么两样
Just like all the rest.

1078
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:32,980
那你跟史塔克又算什么
Well what about you and Stark?

1079
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,610
我怎么知道你们有没有...
How do I know you two haven't been...

1080
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:35,860
去吃什么芝士火锅
...fondueing.

1081
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:43,030
你还是一丁点儿都不懂女人
You still don't know a bloody thing about women.

1082
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:46,410
芝士火锅只是奶酪和面包  哥们
Fondue's just cheese and bread, my friend.

1083
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:47,410
真的吗
Really?

1084
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:47,970
我不知道...
I didn't think...

1085
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:48,870
或许你该动动脑子  伙计
Or should you, pal.

1086
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,750
有时候你自以为你摸透女人了
The moment you think you know what's going on in...

1087
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:51,720
结果发现
a woman's head. Is the

1088
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,540
根本就不是那么回事儿
moment your goose is well and truly cooked.

1089
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,340
我嘛  更注重工作
Me, I concentrate on work.

1090
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,770
就现在来说
Which at the moment, is about

1091
01:17:56,770 --> 01:17:59,090
就是保证你和你的人都不送命
making sure you and your men do not get killed.

1092
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,010
材质是碳的聚合物
Carbon polymer.

1093
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,300
应该可以承受德国军刺
Should withstand your average German bayonet.

1094
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:07,850
但海德拉可不会用小刀对付你
Although, Hydra's not going to attack you with a pocket knife.

1095
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,140
我听说你有些装备
I hear you're uh, kinda attached.

1096
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:12,770
用起来很顺手
It's handier than you might think.

1097
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:14,810
有几个选项供你选择
I took the liberty of coming up with some options.

1098
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:16,900
这个很有趣
This one's fun.

1099
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,530
里面装了继电器
She's being fitted with electrical relays.

1100
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:20,940
-能让你...  -那这个呢
- That will allow you to.. - What about this one?

1101
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:21,940
不不  那件还未完工
No, no that's just a prototype.

1102
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:22,950
是什么材质
What's it made of?

1103
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,320
吸音金属
Vibranium.

1104
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,120
比钢更强  重量则只有其三分之一
It's stronger than steel, and a third of the weight.

1105
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:31,040
它可以使攻击无效化
It's completely vibration absorbent.

1106
01:18:32,910 --> 01:18:34,460
为何不作为全军配备
How come it's not standard issue?

1107
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,130
这种材料在地球上实为罕见
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

1108
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:37,210
你手中这一件
What you're holding there.

1109
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:38,250
是绝无仅有的孤品
That's all we got.

1110
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,550
快好了吗  史塔克
Are you quite finished, Mr. Stark?

1111
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:42,300
我确信队长还有些未完的任务
I'm sure the Captain has some unfinished business.

1112
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,300
你觉得如何
What do you think?

1113
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:55,690
很好  能派上用场
Yes, I think it works.

1114
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,820
对服装我还有些想法
I had some ideas about the uniform.

1115
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:08,830
听你的  伙计
Whatever you want, pal.

1116
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,990
你一直在失败
You are failing!

1117
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:20,580
我们征服这个星球的计划就要成功了
We are close to an offensive that will shake the planet.

1118
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,630
现在却一推再推  就因为
And we are continually delayed because,

1119
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:25,250
你搞不定一个带盾牌的白痴
...you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield.

1120
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:27,210
这不是我的专长
It's hardly my area of expertise.

1121
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,840
我只会发明武器
I, I merely develop weapons.

1122
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,470
我又不会用
I..I..I cannot fire them.

1123
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:33,730
完成你的使命  博士
Finish your mission, Doctor.

1124
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:36,010
别在那之前就被美国佬给搞死了
Before the American finishes his.

1125
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:37,310
长官
Sir!

1126
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:41,100
我很抱歉  施密特长官
I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.

1127
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:43,900
我们全军覆灭了
We fought to the last man.

1128
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:49,150
显然还没有全灭
Evidently not.

1129
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:04,170
还记得在科尼岛我逼你玩旋风飞车吗
Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone on Coney Island?

1130
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,170
记得  我吐了
Yeah, and I threw up.

1131
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,090
这不会是报复吧
This isn't pay back, is it?

1132
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,550
怎么会呢
Why would I do that?

1133
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:13,470
你是对的  佐拉博士在火车上
You were right, Doctor Zola is on the train.

1134
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:16,760
海德拉的人让他打开节流阀
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle.

1135
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:19,560
不管他去哪  他们肯定很需要他
Wherever he's going, they must need him bad.

1136
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:29,190
他们快得像要去投胎  我们要快行动
Let's get going because they're moving like the devil.

1137
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,440
我们只有十秒钟空隙
We only got about a ten second window.

1138
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,700
错过了那个间隙
You miss that, window.

1139
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:34,360
就要被火车撞死了
We're bugs on a windshield.

1140
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,620
小心脚下
Mind the gap.

1141
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,030
准备上了  兄弟们
Gotta get moving, buds.

1142
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:46,640
拖住他
Stop him.

1143
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,100
继续攻击
Fire again.

1144
01:24:40,490 --> 01:24:41,740
我就要打败他了
I had him on the ropes.

1145
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:42,740
我知道
I know you did.

1146
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:44,700
趴下
Get down!

1147
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:48,160
继续攻击
Fire again.

1148
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,330
快杀了他
Kill him, now.

1149
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:58,880
鹿仔
Bucky!

1150
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:03,970
坚持住
Hang on.

1151
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,180
抓住我的手
Grab my hand.

1152
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:08,940
不
No!

1153
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,540
坐下
Sit down.

1154
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,340
这是什么
What is this?

1155
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:22,180
牛排
Steak.

1156
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,010
里面是什么
What is in it?

1157
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:26,640
牛肉
Cow.

1158
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,730
博士  你知不知道
Doctor, do you realize,

1159
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,900
...这么一块高级牛肉
...how difficult it is to get a hold,

1160
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,770
...在这可是很难搞到
...of a prime cut like that out here?

1161
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,150
我不吃肉
I don't eat meat.

1162
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,860
-为什么不吃  -不合口味
- Why not? - It disagrees with me.

1163
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:46,030
氰化物怎么样  也让你肚子不舒服吗
How about Cyanide, does that give you the rumbly tummy too?

1164
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:52,410
每次我们想活捉海德拉的特工
Every Hydra agent that we've tried to take alive,

1165
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:54,920
...都在我们能阻止前服毒自尽了
...consumed a little pill before we can stop them.

1166
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,580
可你没有
But not you.

1167
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:00,550
所以聪明过人的我推论
So, here's my brilliant theory.

1168
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:03,880
你不想死
You want to live.

1169
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:07,680
你在威胁我  上校
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1170
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,640
我给你带了晚餐
I brought you dinner.

1171
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:18,650
由于他所提供的宝贵信息
Given the valuable information that he has provided,

1172
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:22,070
以及作为他大力合作的交换条件
And in exchange for his full co-operation.

1173
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:26,030
佐拉博士将被送返瑞士
Doctor Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.

1174
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:28,030
今早我把消息发去了华盛顿
I sent that message to Washington this morning.

1175
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,080
当然是被加密了
Of course it was encoded.

1176
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,540
你们的人还没解开吧
You guys haven't broken those codes, have you?

1177
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:34,370
不然可就尴尬了
That would be awkward.

1178
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:36,330
施密特不会相信的
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1179
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:37,630
不管怎样他都会杀了你  博士
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.

1180
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:39,880
你成了他的障碍
You're a liability.

1181
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:42,170
你知道他最多的秘密
You know more about Schmidt than anyone.

1182
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:43,460
而且...
And...

1183
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,600
最后一个被你害死的人
And the last guy you cost us

1184
01:27:45,610 --> 01:27:47,760
是罗杰斯队长最好的朋友
was Captain Rogers closest friend.

1185
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,300
所以我可不敢打包票你会有什么下场
So I wouldn't count on the very best of protection.

1186
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,810
自保
It's you,

1187
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,230
...还是保施密特
...or Schmidt.

1188
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:56,730
你自己选吧
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1189
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:02,860
施密特坚信他是在追随众神的脚步
Schmidt believes he walks in the footsteps of the gods.

1190
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,360
只有得到整个世界他才会满足
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1191
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,320
你也知道他疯了吧
You do realize that's nuts, don't you.

1192
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,740
当然
Of course.

1193
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:13,870
疯不疯狂已经不重要了
The sanity of the plan is of no consequence.

1194
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:16,210
-为什么  -因为他做得到
- And why is that? - Because he can do it.

1195
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:18,120
他的目标是什么
What's his target?

1196
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:21,960
他的目标
His target,

1197
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,010
是整个世界
is everywhere.

1198
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,610
明天...
Tomorrow...

1199
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,570
海德拉将会称霸世界
Hydra will stand master of the world.

1200
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:54,830
在瓦尔基里女神的庇佑下赢得胜利
Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie.

1201
01:28:55,290 --> 01:28:59,250
敌人的武器对我们都不堪一击
Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us.

1202
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,790
若是一架飞机被击落
If they shoot down one plane.

1203
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:04,630
还有数百架飞机会予以猛烈回击
Hundreds more will rain fire upon them.

1204
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,340
砍掉一个头
If they cut off one head.

1205
01:29:12,010 --> 01:29:14,760
还会长出两个新的
Two more shall take its place.

1206
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,930
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra.

1207
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:18,430
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra!

1208
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:20,020
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra!

1209
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:23,110
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra...Heil Hydra!

1210
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:25,940
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra, Heil Hydra!

1211
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,610
海德拉万岁
Heil Hydra.

1212
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,390
厄斯金博士说过
Doctor Erskine said that,

1213
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:00,310
...血清不光会影响肌肉
...the serum wouldn't just affect my muscles.

1214
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:02,060
也会影响细胞
It would affect my cells.

1215
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,730
产生一个再生和愈合的
Create a protective system,

1216
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,570
...保护系统
...Of regeneration and healing.

1217
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:08,740
也就是说...
Which means, um...

1218
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,860
我不会醉
I can't get drunk.

1219
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,080
你知道吗
Did you know that?

1220
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:20,660
你的新陈代谢速率是常人的四倍
Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person.

1221
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,540
博士觉得那可能是副作用之一
He thought it could be one of the side effects.

1222
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,510
那不是你的错
It wasn't your fault.

1223
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:34,590
你看了报告吗
Did you read the report?

1224
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:35,600
看了
Yes.

1225
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,510
那你该知道是我害死了他
Well, then you know that's not true.

1226
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:38,930
你尽力了
You did everything you could.

1227
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,230
你相信你朋友吗
Did you believe in your friend?

1228
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,480
你尊重他吗
Did you respect him?

1229
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:49,480
那就别再自责
Then stop blaming yourself.

1230
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:52,070
这样才不会有损他的尊严
And that was the dignity of his choice.

1231
01:30:52,450 --> 01:30:54,570
他肯定认为值得为你赴汤蹈火
He damn well must have thought you were worth it.

1232
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:58,580
我要杀了施密特
I'm going after Schmidt.

1233
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:01,850
只要海德拉还没被赶尽杀绝
I'm not going to stop

1234
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:03,250
我就不会停手
'til all of Hydra is dead, or captured.

1235
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,750
你不是一个人
You won't be alone.

1236
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:11,800
约翰・施密特该被扔进疯人院
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house.

1237
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,010
他觉得自己是神
He thinks he's a god and he's

1238
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:14,930
还要炸掉半个世界
willing to blow up half the world to prove it.

1239
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:16,680
就从美国开始
Starting with the U.S.A.

1240
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,100
施密特的力量超出我们的能力
Schmidt's working with powers beyond our capabilities.

1241
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,140
他只要穿过大西洋
He gets across the Atlantic.

1242
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:24,600
就能在一小时内抹平整个东海岸
He'll wipe out the entire eastern seaboard in an hour.

1243
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:29,770
我们有多少时间
How much time we got?

1244
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:32,490
据那位新朋友的说法  不到24小时
According to my new best friend, in twenty four hours.

1245
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:33,780
他现在人在哪
Where is he now?

1246
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,570
海德拉最后的基地
Hydra's last base is here.

1247
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:37,410
在阿尔卑斯山脉
In the Alps.

1248
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:39,280
地表下五百英尺
500 feet below the surface.

1249
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,250
那我们该怎么做
So what are we suppose to do?

1250
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,750
又不能直接敲门进去
It's not like we can just knock on the front door.

1251
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:47,460
怎么不能
Why not?

1252
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,510
我们就这么做
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1253
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:05,050
自大也许不是美国人的独有特征
Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait.

1254
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:07,520
但不得不说你诠释的比别人都出色
But I must say you do it better than anyone.

1255
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:11,760
然而即便是你
But, there are limits,

1256
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,360
也有做不到的事  队长
to what even you can do, Captain.

1257
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:19,280
还是厄斯金的说法不同
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1258
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:20,990
他跟我说你疯了
He told me you were insane.

1259
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,370
他嫉妒我天赋异禀
He resented my genius,

1260
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:30,830
还想否认本就属于我的东西
and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine.

1261
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:33,120
可他却给了你一切
But he gave you everything.

1262
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,040
那么
So.

1263
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:40,510
你有什么特别之处吗
What made you so special?

1264
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,760
没有
Nothing.

1265
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,060
我就是个布鲁克林的小个子
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1266
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:00,990
我可以和你耗一整天
I can do this all day.

1267
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:03,200
你当然可以  当然了
Oh of course you can, of course.

1268
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:06,370
但可惜的是我有点忙
But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule.

1269
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:13,620
我也是
So am I.

1270
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:26,970
罗杰斯
Rogers.

1271
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,060
你可能用得上
You might need this.

1272
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:30,060
谢了
Thanks.

1273
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:44,110
我们进去了  立即进攻
We're in, assaulting now!

1274
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:45,110
行动
Move out!

1275
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,790
砍掉一个头  还会长出两个...
Got off one head, two more...

1276
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:40,880
那就把这两个也砍掉
Let's go find two more.

1277
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:05,820
停火
Cease fire.

1278
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:08,950
你迟到了
You're late.

1279
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,160
你不是要去...
Weren't you about to...

1280
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:14,330
哦对
Right.

1281
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:47,330

稳住
Keep it steady.

1284
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,270
等等
Wait!

1285
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:06,020
去杀了他
Go get him.

1286
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,530
我可不会吻你
I'm not kissing you.

1287
01:40:07,250 --> 01:40:09,650
芝加哥

1288
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:12,150
纽约

1289
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:51,250
你就是怎么也不放弃是吧
You don't give up, do you?

1290
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:52,710
没错
Nope.

1291
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,950
你本可以拥有神的力量
You could have the power of the gods.

1292
01:44:04,900 --> 01:44:06,620
你以为自己胸前顶着面旗子
Yet you wear a flag on your

1293
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:09,530
就是为国而战了吗
chest and think you fight a battle of nations.

1294
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,870
我已经看见了未来  队长
I have seen the future, Captain.

1295
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:15,920
-未来可没有国旗  -这不是我的未来
- There are no flags. - Not my future.

1296
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:31,470
你都干了什么
What have you done?

1297
01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:32,810
不
No!

1298
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,750
我是罗杰斯队长  收到吗
Come in this is, Captain Rogers. Do you read me?

1299
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,090
罗杰斯队长  你...

1300
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:46,460
史蒂夫  是你吗  你没事吗
Steve is that you, are you all right?

1301
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:48,220
没事  施密特死了
Great, Schmidt's dead.

1302
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,130
飞机呢
What about the plane?

1303
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:53,720
这个比较难解释
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1304
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:56,600
告诉我坐标  我给你找个安全降落点
Give me your coordinates I'll find you a safe landing site.

1305
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,560
可能没功夫顾及安全了
There's not going to be a safe landing.

1306
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:01,650
我要尝试迫降
I'm going to try and force it down.

1307
01:46:01,650 --> 01:46:03,860
我让霍华德来听  他知道怎么做
I'll get Howard on the line, he'll know what to do.

1308
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:04,860
没时间了
There's not enough time.

1309
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:07,400
这架飞机太快  正往纽约飞
This thing's moving too fast and it's heading for New York.

1310
01:46:12,070 --> 01:46:13,620
我得让他落在海里
I gotta put her in the water.

1311
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:15,240
拜托  别这么做
Please, don't do this.

1312
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,290
时间来得及  我们可以想想办法
We have time, we can work it out.

1313
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:18,710
我正在无人地带
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1314
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:20,670
要是不立即行动  会有很多人丧命
If I wait any longer a lot of people are going to die.

1315
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:27,420
佩姬

1316
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:30,720
这是我的选择
This is my choice.

1317
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:56,080
佩姬

1318
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:58,200
我在
I'm here.

1319
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,370
看来要改天和你跳舞了
I'm going to need a rain check on that dance.

1320
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,340
好吧
All right.

1321
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:19,270
下周六在鹳鸟俱乐部
A week next Saturday at the Stork Club.

1322
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,600
没问题
You got it.

1323
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:24,850
八点整
Eight o'clock, on the dot.

1324
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:26,230
不准迟到
Don't you dare be late.

1325
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,360
明白吗
Understood?

1326
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:31,780
我还是不会跳舞
You know I still don't know how to dance.

1327
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:39,620
我会教你
I'll show you how.

1328
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,200
你来就好
Just be there.

1329
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:44,580
记得让乐队演奏柔缓的曲子
We'll have the band play something slow.

1330
01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:49,920
我可不想踩到你的...
I'd hate to step on your....

1331
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:53,970
史蒂夫
Steve?

1332
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,510
史蒂夫
Steve.

1333
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:02,230
史蒂夫
Steve.

1334
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,190

1335
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:02,290
敬队长
To the Captain.

1336
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:16,090
先生
Sir.

1337
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:27,810
去下一个坐标点
Take us to the next grid point.

1338

但这里没有残骸的痕迹

1339
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:33,150
能量信号也在这终止了
And the energy signal trace stops here.

1340
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:36,570
继续找就是了
Just keep looking.

1341
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:52,570
已退役

1342
01:50:43,260 --> 01:50:46,010
又一记投球  是高飞界外球
There's a pitch, it's a ball high outside.

1343
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:50,690
那么与道奇队比分为四比四平手
So, the dodges tied four to four.

1344
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:55,190
计分毫无悬念  他挥动球棒
At the count no doubt, one swing of his bat.

1345
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:57,900
这位小伙子有能力再次让对方三振出局
This fella is capable of making it a brand new game again

1346
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:02,200
本场在埃比茨棒球场进行的比赛太精彩了
Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets field.

1347
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,870

But the Dodgers have three men on.

1349
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:15,670
投球  好球

He leans in, here's the pitch, swung on, it's a line drive.

1351

越过了格里姆森
It gets past Grissom.

1352
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:30,980
瑞佐得分了  雷瑟跑向三垒
Rizzo will score, Reiser heads to third.

1353
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:33,060
杜罗歇在等着接替他
Durocher is going to wave him in.

1354
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:36,400
他们正要交接  但保持着稳定
They look to relay but they hold steady.

1355
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,390
彼得・雷瑟以一记投入公园的...

1358

你在纽约的一间术后恢复室里
You're in a recovery room in New York city.

1361
01:51:49,790 --> 01:51:55,210

我们认为最好让你慢慢接受这些

接受什么

1379

你一直在沉睡  队长
