{\an8}<Many years later</b>

13
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,832
The final half-barrel of mixed energy

14
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,624
Second Master, no more job vacancies.

15
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,374
We can' t sail
this boat anymore.

16
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,624
Not that I won't tell you, Second Master.

17
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,040
It has been a long time
since we've had a job.

18
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,249
Time to get some money to buy gas.

19
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,165
Old Yao

20
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,040
Once upon a time everyone
could fly in the clouds.

21
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,874
But after that natural disaster

22
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,624
Except for those with wings.

23
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,874
The fairies and monsters

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,540
With this boat you can fly.

25
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,207
That natural disaster

26
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,790
When did it happen?

27
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,207
It's been too long.

28
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,165
Right

29
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,374
I forgot how I used to fly.

30
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,415
It sounds like something
out of a legend.

31
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,832
There's a new notice board

32
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,832
Issued by Penglai Divine Palace.

33
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:45,207
Finally, a change in fortune

34
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,499
We are here - Penglai

35
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,790
Don't let other bounty
hunters take this job!

36
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,082
Why only 20 Guan from the
Treasure of the Three Worlds?

37
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,790
He looks like a tough guy too.

38
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,124
Penglai's mansion is also poor

39
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,749
No more work.

40
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,040
We are going out of business.

41
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,749
Then, let's take our chances

The Vermilion Bird Gate opens

45
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,415
Freedom and Magnificence

00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,540

Each in its own place

50
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,499
Each in its own way.

51
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,207
Seeking the Elixir of Immortality

52
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,582
Pay for it.

53
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,665
Or get out!

54
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,790
I can'! Take fake medicine.

55
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,457
If you can't afford it, get out!

56
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,332
A Fairy

57
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,582
A Monster.

58
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,707
Quite a nice combination we have here

59
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,290
Down and out.

60
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,957
Any combination desired.

61
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,165
You've never heard
of dogs at night?

62
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:39,832
That's right.

63
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,207
My dog has a better
life than I do.

64
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,457
Look at the way he kisses me again.

65
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,499
Twenty Guan

66
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,790
I thought, a sheriff of a cave.

67
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,790
But he is a bounty hunter.

68
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,165
Ow! Ow!

69
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,207
That's a tough head.

70
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,582
What are you running away for?

71
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,540
I want money, not life.

72
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,124
Be careful where you fall.

73
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,374
What are you doing?

74
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,790
Unbelievable,
It's out of gas at this point.

75
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,124
Trying to catch me.

76
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:53,832
You're just in time.

77
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,832
Almost.

78
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,874
You don't know that.

79
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,499
He smells you and he's chasing you.

80
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,790
You're back!

81
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,415
All right, all right

82
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,665
What is all this?

83
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,332
It's embarrassing.

84
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:16,999
I liked him.

85
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,082
Are you jealous?

86
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:18,707
Brother

87
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,582
You're doing this for money, aren't you?

88
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,415
Let me go.

89
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,624
I'll give you five times as much.

90
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,415
One hundred Guan

91
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,790
You're a fake drug dealer.

92
00:10:26,903 --> 00:10:27,624
Who will believe you?

93
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,957
Oh, yes.

94
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,124
Buried right beside the bridge

95
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,832
Only I know.

96
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,499
Second Master.

97
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,332
Sounds good.

98
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,332
How about this?

99
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,374
I'll help you ask.

100
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,624
How about it?

101
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,332
Ask heaven and earth
about everything.

102
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,290
Whether to release
or not to release

103
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,332
How?

104
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,832
20 Guan

105
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:11,707
Second Master

106
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,165
Only harmonica

107
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,665
Heads let him go.

108
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,957
Or tail let him go

109
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,207
You didn't say it before.

110
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,415
All right

111
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,040
There's money.

112
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,665
Someone is looking for

113
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,040
and business at the door

114
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,957
Yes, and a beautiful woman too.

115
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,499
A beautiful woman.

116
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,915
Home visit.

117
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,749
You are Mu Erlang

118
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,999
Surname Mu 2nd order

119
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,290
Mu Er is me

120
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,165
I'm looking for someone

121
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,165
We are silver bounty hunters.

122
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,665
We catch people,
not find them.

123
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,249
I want you to help
me catch someone.

124
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,207
That's my job here.

125
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,874
He stole the treasure from my sister.

126
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,499
What treasure?

127
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,207
I can't tell you.

128
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:24,790
Ok

129
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:26,749
I'm the one.

130
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,415
Headache when
thinking about things

131
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,832
Don't tell me if you have a headache.

132
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,415
Drink

133
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,582
Sister and I grew up together.

134
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,156
She disappeared, after
Great Tribulation 12 years ago

135
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,332
He bequeathed the treasure to me.

136
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,374
Our family heirloom

137
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,582
Can you help me?

138
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,374
Anything for a fee.

139
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,249
That's all I have for you.

140
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,353
All right, I'll tell you.

141
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,915
"Everything is as it should be"

142
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,205
It can hold everything that nothing
else in the world can hold.

143
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,165
He stole this treasure

144
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,957
and fled to the island of
the Divine Island Fang Hu

145
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,207
So, you're looking for this person?

146
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,749
He should have a name

147
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:46,874
Chen Xiang

148
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,853
Chen Xiang

149
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,540
Why, have you heard of it?

150
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,332
It's a rare name.

151
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,540
Be careful

152
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,124
Xiao Yuan Luo is waiting
for news from Yingzhou.

153
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,749
Have a History

154
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,374
That's right.

155
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,582
Look at his robe and this boat

156
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:17,999
<i>and its appearance</i>

157
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,749
<i>But why did she come to us?</i>

158
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,082
<i>We are no better than the cheap ones</i>

159
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,874
<i>For 15 days</i>

160
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,540
<i>As long as supplies last.</i>

161
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,665
<i>High quality blended energy</i>

162
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,499
<i>Helps to travel smoothly</i>

163
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,082
<i>3 pouches received</i>

164
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,332
<i>Sir, that's the
way to go.</i>

165
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,957
<i>Received 3 pouches.</i>

166
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,040
<i>Come on, let's go</i>

167
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,957
{\an8}You're blocking my way, son.

168
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:35,915
Don't fight. Don't fight.

169
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:36,665
Don't you dare hit me.

170
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,790
Stop it! Stop it!

171
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,832
Who caused the trouble? There is no fight.

172

You've got a lot of courage.

174
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,165
Come on out, you!

175
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,165
Don't move!

176
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,332
Bos, the Celestial Soldiers are here.

177
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,332
Who triggered the smoke wolf?

178
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,415
Let's go!

179
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,415
There!

180
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,749
You guys go forward

181
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,249
Get in the boat.

182
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,832
Let's go!

183
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,296
Wait!

184
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,082
You rascal!

185
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:26,749
Stop!

Let's go

00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:21,915

Welcome, sir.

Inside, please

196
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,457
What's the point of playing
if you've lost everything?

197
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,624
Put it down

198
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,624
Second Master.

199
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,540
Second Master, you're here.

Old Gao

201
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,707
What can be expected of you?

202
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,415
Let me ask you something

203
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,249
My ears

204
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,374
I can't hear anymore.

205
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,173
Even if you can't,
you still have good ears.

206
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,707
For what I owe you.

207
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,207
What do you want to ask me?

208
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,415
Find someone named Chen Xiang

209
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:56,457
Chen Xiang

210
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,082
Never heard of him

211
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,207
I'll go first.

212
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:14,582
How are the three of you?

213
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,124
An unexpected meeting.

214
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,915
Let me take a good look at you.

215
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,457
Don't be too harsh.

216
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:42,481
Blind, really blind.

217
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,832
Mu Erlang

00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,790
Silver Bounty Hunter

219
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,290
I said Mu. No no no

220
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:53,790
Your brother

221
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,957
Where is your three-edged
and double-edged sword?

222
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,124
And the catapult with its silver bullets?

223
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,374
They are gone.

224
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:04,790
All of them!

225
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:08,749
This is the famous Yang Jian

226
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:09,832
He is the God of Erlang

227
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,249
No way. So downtrodden

228
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,415
Why are you so down?

229
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,874
No, let me speak for you.

230
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,165
12 years ago

231
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,957
Yang Jian,
because of the Three Saints Yang Chan

232
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,082
eloped with a human

233
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,457
Breaking the rules of heaven

234
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,874
and he was put under Huashan

235
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,374
It was his own sister

236
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:44,665
The Yang Chan fought against
before being subdued to the mountain

237
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,707
Using the precious Bao
Lian Lantern from Huashan

238
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,207
injuring his celestial eye.

239
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,582
Negate his magic power.

240
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:55,540
Since then,
her spirit has never been able to leave.

241
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:00,249
All of you

242
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:01,874
What kind of people

243
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,165
for the sake of a piece of crap

244
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:07,457
putting his own sister under Huashan

245
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:11,874
to divide the family
and scatter their family.

246
00:24:15,227 --> 00:24:16,060
Yang Jian

247
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:19,290
When you captured our three brothers

248
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,165
You were so strong.

249
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,874
Today

250
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,457
I'll give you a good beating.

251
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,624
Keep playing.

252
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,874
Devil brothers

253
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,457
Moli Hong, Moli Hai

254
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,332
Yang Jian, didn't expect it.

255
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,088
One day you were in such dire straits-

256
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:05,825
-that you needed me
to come save you-.

257
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:10,558
Since that moment in
Huashan 12 years ago.

258
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,457
I haven't heard from you since then.

259
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:17,124
I can't believe you've
become a silver bounty hunter.

260
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:18,957
I also need to eat.

261
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,707
I'm in the corner.

262
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,999
I heard you're looking for someone.

263
00:25:23,512 --> 00:25:24,332
Part of the prize

264
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:25,249
Don't look for it.

265
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,457
He's the one we're looking for here.

266
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,457
Don't you dare interfere.

267
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:30,790
Or.

268
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,082
How dare you threaten Yang Jian?

269
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,665
Yang Jian,
You're not the same Erlang God anymore

270
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,124
Thanks to you guys

271
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:52,499
Don't run

272
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,082
Get out of the way!

273
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,374
Look where it's blurring

274
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:27,165
Finally,
I'll chase you out in the open.

275
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:31,665
Boss,
this is the new maid you found.

276
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:36,082
You got all my men killed on that ship.

277
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,165
Hand over your stuff.

278
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:39,499
What's that?

279
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,665
The things you stole when
you went down to the cabin.

280
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,665
Who told you?

281
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:45,790
I did,

282
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,457
I looking for Bos Hai

283
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,415
Boss Hai, New Pet

284
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,874
The most precious thing on the boat

285
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,415
That's what you stole.

286
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,249
You handed it over.

287
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,999
Maybe I'll take one of your
arms and one of your legs.

288
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,082
Don't get involved in
this if you have eyes.

289
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,165
Excuse me

290
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,415
Boss Hai, you have a backup.

291
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:24,832
I have a backup too.

292
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,374
You can keep this for a while.

293
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,665
No, no, no, I'm with him.

294
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,290
Misunderstanding

295
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:38,124
I'll kill you both today.

296
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,665
I have nothing to do with him.

297
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:42,707
Beat him up.

298
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,582
Thanks for your help.

299
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:16,082
I'll pay you when I'm done.

300
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,832
You're a little too
hard on yourself.

301
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,249
If they catch me.

302
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,290
I'll be twice as bad as dead.

303
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,207
What the hell is this?

304
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:38,124
You really gave me this treasure.

305
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,415
If not, how can they believe it?

306
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:42,749
Aren't you afraid that
I won't return it?

307
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,915
Then I'll kill you.

308
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,457
You have a lot of courage.

309
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,249
Do you know who I am?

310
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:52,290
I'll kill you no
matter who you are.

311
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,582
I'm Meishan Yang Jian.

312
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:03,790
Chen Xiang

313
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,582
How do you know my name?

314
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,082
That's right.

315
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,665
I was asked to look for you.

316
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,915
Yang Jian, why are you here again?

317
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,499
Why are you two
brothers here again?

318
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:35,957
You're not even

319
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,624
I'll say it first.

320
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,040
I was just passing by.

321
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:46,540
The first murder is not Yang Jian

322
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,332
Of course it wasn't.

323
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,624
The guy who just escaped is the one
you're looking for Chen Xiang.

324
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,374
Is it a coincidence?

325
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,790
A little thief

326
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,165
What's all the fuss about?

327
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:02,624
You really don't know
who Chen Xiang is

328
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:03,957
He comes from your sect.

329
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,207
He is your subordinate.

330
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,999
Now that you're in it today

331
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,415
Where did he come from?

332
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,040
Ask your Master.

333
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:25,686
{\an9}<b> Divine Realm Jinxia Cave</b>

334
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:14,874

335
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,583
Please tell Master

336
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,749

Please come with me, Master.

340
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,355
Your eyes haven't improved yet.

341
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:22,520
Yes

342
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,624
Very powerful.

343
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,582
I could barely open
the gap if I tried.

344
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,249
But there was only a bright
golden light in front of me.

345
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:34,165
I couldn't see anything.

346
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:38,665
It's hard to understand.

347
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,999
Perhaps the barrier can be broken by
an extremely powerful external force.

348
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:49,290
But the fear is,
it will only add to the wound.

349
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,290
Yes

350
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,790
You've been under my guidance
since you were a child.

351
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,415
I treated you like a child.

352
00:32:58,756 --> 00:33:00,171
12 years ago

353
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,999
You sealed the Lotus Peak

354
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,874
But there were many disasters

355
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:10,457
The world of gods is in decline

356
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:14,499
demons and monsters rise

357
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:17,540
Maybe I was wrong.

358
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:24,670
All life will eventually
experience another disaster.

359
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,749
Your four words of advice, Master

360
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,124
Do your best

361
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,790
Yes

362
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,332
Do your best.

363
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,332
For the truth to live

364
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,374
How could you not try
to make up for it?

365
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:43,249
I understand.

366
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:50,624
Master

367
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,207
I met a young man at
the bottom of the hill

368
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,290
He said that he was
under my supervision.

369
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,457
His name is Chen Xiang.

370
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:57,790
Chen Xiang

371
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,624
The good boy you sent up the hill

372
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,749
You really don't know about this

373
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,165
When you sent him up the mountain.

374
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:12,457
He was just a crying baby.

375
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:16,040
You haven't seen him in a while.

376
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:20,624
I named him Chen Xiang

377
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:27,165
I hope his heart will be as peaceful
and restrained as Chen Xiang's wood.

378
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,499
He turned out to be

379
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,249
My students

380
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,832
A rebellious disciple
who killed his teacher.

381
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:43,165
Go with your
Your senior and take a look.

382
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,790
Master has sealed the
body of Second Brother.

383
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:52,457
To be destroyed someday.

384
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,290
Chen Xiang Why would
he do such a thing?

385
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:58,249
I've seen it before

386
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,874
He's a born rebel.

387
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:01,124
A disobedient
and unruly man.

388
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:04,475
But Master remembers
the Lotus Peak incident

389
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,249
Reluctant to expel him from the mountain

390
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:07,499
just to make Brother
Second took him as his disciple

391
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,165
to teach him well.

392
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,124
Second Brother has
a violent temper

393
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,874
What hurt him?

394
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,540
He and Shen Gong Bao joined forces.

395
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,207
He killed second brother
when he wasn't ready.

396
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,249
Shen Gong Bao

397
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:24,946
He has reappeared

398
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,157
Yes

399
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,874
I wonder how this child
knows Shen Gong Bao.

400
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:33,499
Shen Gong Bao's diversion skills are
truly amazing.

401
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,207
They also stole Second Brother's
newly created magic treasure.

402
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:37,624
What treasure?

403
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,124
"Everything is as it should be"

404
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:48,401
{\an9}<b>Divine Realm
Fang Yi Wine Trail</b>

405
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,790
Good

406
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:23,082
Next step

407
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,999
With the lamp oil from the
Bao Lian Sacred Lamp.

408
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,165
The next step, of course, picking up
the lampshade from the Bao Lian Lantern.

409
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,457
Good

410
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,915
I met a man

411
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:38,707
Who' s that?

412
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,915
My fellow teacher Yang Jian

413
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,124
Him.

414
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,540
He said he was looking for me.

415
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,457
Because your Master

416
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,124
No.

417
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,665
He doesn't seem to know about it.

418
00:36:57,958 --> 00:36:58,499
Here

419
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,124
Here

420
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:15,207
here

421
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:20,832
You only know Yang
Jian as your teacher's uncle.

422
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:24,249
In fact, he is your own uncle.

423
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,207
He is my uncle.

424
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:28,999
That's him too.

425
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,749
He is the one who put your
mother under Lotus Peak.

426
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:37,915
Yang Jian's magic is naturally strong

427
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:40,707
His power is also countered
by Bao Lian's Lantern.

428
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,499
Shattered into pieces

429
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,290
If we can find all these parts

430
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,624
Bao Lian Lantern

431
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,832
and you can use the power
of the Bao Lian Lantern.

432
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,832
Splitting the Lotus Peak

433
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,624
and save your mother

434
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,540
Your teacher

435
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,040
Your teacher's family.

436
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,499
They are all the same

437
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,207
Those people

438
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:18,582
They gave me the name
General Shen Gong Bao

439
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:22,332
but put me in the eyes
of the East China Sea

440
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,290
All this talk of
virtue and morality

441
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,749
The hypocrisy is incredible.

442
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:36,832
So I gritted my teeth and endured.

443
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:42,082
After all these years

444
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,665
A good chance for revenge.

445
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,332
I finally got it.

446
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:02,040
Why is Yang Jian looking for me?

447
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:05,790
For the Bao Lian Lantern, of course.

448
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,082
Bao Lian Lantern

449
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:12,624
Only your mother's
bloodline can use it

450
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,665
You

451
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,749
They also stole the Second Master's
newly created magic weapon.

452
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,790
"All things are as they should be"

453
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,374
He stole the treasure from my brother.

454
00:39:41,155 --> 00:39:43,141
"All things are as they should be"

455
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,457
I am Wan Luo is waiting
for news from Yingzhou.

456
00:39:58,253 --> 00:40:05,160
{\an9}<b>Divine Realm
The Island of Gods</b>

457
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:27,665
There

00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:34,575
This hybrid energy can
really make you fly!

459
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,374
It' s amazing!

460
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:01,790
A mix of music and bamboo, no drums

461
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,540
Maid, serve tea.

462
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,457
How Erlang entered,

463
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,540
You surprised me.

464
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:00,040
I' m sorry.

465
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,290
Just passing by here.

Listen to Miss Wanluo's dance.

467
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,415
I guess I forgot to remember
it for a long time.

468
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:14,249
You like to hear my music.

469
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:15,999
The sound from beyond the sky

470
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:17,415
That sound

471
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,207
It' a pity that
Luo Shen Fu of Cao Zijian

472
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,415
But it' s a sad song.

473
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,457
This unspeakable pain

474
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:31,999
The pain of longing.

475
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,957
What a song.

476
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:55,082
Why does Erlang stay?

477
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,332
I don't know why

478
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,249
The last time I saw you

479
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:02,374
I felt like I knew you.

480
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:04,665
But I don't know
where I've seen you.

481
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,665
Maybe it was in Erlang's dream.

482
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,582
Or maybe

483
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,790
I

484
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,999
The person in the dream

485
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:23,582
Probably

486
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,749
I've found Chen Xiang

487
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:29,540
The little thief

488
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,040
Where is he?

489
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:34,707
He got away again.

490
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:37,249
Chen Xiang is from my college.

491
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:38,832
He is my disciple.

492
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,457
You - Mu Erlang

493
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:44,386
Both surnamed Yang

494
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,207
You are Yang Jian

"Everything as it should be"

496
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:50,290
is a treasure created
by Chen Xiang's Master.

497
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:52,457
I want to ask you

498
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,124
Why did you lie about Ruyi?

499
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,457
It's your sister.

500
00:44:58,548 --> 00:44:59,548
Yang Jian

501
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:00,665
There is something

502
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,124
It's better not to know

503
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:20,125
Mom

504
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
Jian'er

00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:27,957
Splitting the Mountain

506
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:28,957
Don't go

507
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,124
Splitting Mountain

508
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:32,082
Mother

509
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,550
Mother

510
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:45,083
{\an9}<b>Human Realm
Fang Hu Shipwreck</b>

511
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,749
It was a good defense move

512
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:28,957
It' just a little more difficult.

513
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:34,207
This is a

514
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,832
You will find the Bao Lian Lantern

515
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:40,499
What does it have to do with you?

516
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,374
I guess you already know.

517
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:45,582
I' m your uncle.

518
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:49,499
Yes,
I'm the one who sent you to Jinxia Cave.

519
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,207
At that time you were just born.

520
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:53,457
You didn't even have a name yet.

521
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:54,665
Just

522
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:56,957
Just a little bigger.

523
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,540
My Junior

524
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:01,624
I know he' s grumpy

525
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,874
I don't know why Master
gave you to him.

526
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,124
Did you have a hard time there?

527
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,540
I' m fine.

528
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:12,392
Just not having anything taught to me.

529
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,707
Beating me every day.

530
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,040
Made me starve.

531
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:17,415
Called me an illegitimate child.

532
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:23,999
Sorry, I didn't know.

533
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:27,290
But even so

534
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:28,707
You can't kill her.

535
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,249
Then, you shouldn't have destroyed
my mother under Lotus Peak.

536
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,415
Let go of me!

537
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,332
Well done, Yang Jian.

538
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,332
Chen Xiang, you have killed your fellow
disciples and destroyed your ancestors.

539
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,874
I was ordered to arrest you.

540
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:49,665
You

541
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:51,165
Surrender now.

542
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:24,665
This time we saw it
with our own eyes

543
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:26,540
You let it go.

544
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:29,707
We'll catch you.

545
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:31,332
Don't bother.

546
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:33,582
When I'm done with this job

547
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:35,874
I'll tie myself up
and give myself up.

548
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:02,082
Yang Jian, sorry to offend

549
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,332
Fire and Wind

550
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:50,540
Binding Strings

551
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,999
Your teacher is also here

552
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:05,749
Very cunning.

553
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,124
It's not like your brothers.

554
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,915
Last time in the battle of the gods

555
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,832
You defeated the four of us.

556
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:17,082
Didn't you also use
cunning methods?

557
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,707
That's right,

558
00:51:20,708 --> 00:51:23,749
Yang Jian, I always advise them.

559
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:26,249
That you can't possibly do it.

560
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,415
You admit your mistake in this matter.

561
00:51:31,583 --> 00:51:33,540
If you have difficulties.

562
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:36,040
I'll break it down for you in heaven.

563
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,499
What have I done to me?

564
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,665
What is it?

565
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:41,249
You conspired with Chen Xiang

566
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,665
..in the murder of a fellow student

567
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:44,832
I

568
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:45,499
No.

569
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,290
New people, making a lot of noise

570
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:57,499
What's going on?

571
00:51:57,575 --> 00:52:00,006
You're in prison for the first time.

572
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,707
It's Yang Jian!

573
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:09,624
Who are you?

574
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,124
I'm

575
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:15,040
You, you, you, you

576
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:16,957
Pumpkin Potion

577
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,874
The Big Tall Man beside
me is the Big Tall Man.

578
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:21,082
You two... Then you
hurt hurt hurt hurt

579
00:52:21,083 --> 00:52:22,290
I doo doo doo...

580
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:23,874
You're in the back.

581
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:25,332
You then...

582
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:33,874
Twenty Guan

583
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,624
Don't look like you're Yang Jian

584
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,624
You are nothing to me.

585
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:51,207
If you don't pay me,
I'll kill you too.

586
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,249
Be careful, brother.

587
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:55,707
Be careful

588
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:57,082
What is it?

589
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,457
Yang Jian, even though I caught you.

590
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:07,957
You brought me in.

591
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,374
But it's not like we hate
each other to death.

592
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,082
I'm generous.

593
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:18,540
You are...

594
00:53:20,295 --> 00:53:21,828
You ignore people like that.

595
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,957
He will come back to haunt you.

596
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,124
Do you hear me?

597
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,707
This is a fight.

598
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,040
Now there is

599
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:17,957
Now can see interesting things.

600
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,457
Will someone break through the prison?

601
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,374
Don't you want to see it?

602
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,499
They're not here to
save you, are they?

603
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,040
Behave yourself.

604
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,457
Don't get me in trouble.

605
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:36,582
Do you understand?

606
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,249
Let's go.

607
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,790
Let's go!

608
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:09,374
Go back to where you came from.

609
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:13,207
What the hell are you selling?

610
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:13,957
No.

611
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:15,290
Does it matter?

612
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,290
What matters is
what we do next.

613
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,624
Xiao Tian, where is Second Master?

614
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:24,374
There he is.

615
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,499
That's the next step.

616
00:55:50,128 --> 00:55:51,208
Yang Jian

617
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:53,040
Catch me.

618
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:09,624
Second Master

619
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:22,457
from civilians to Meishan officials

620
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,290
to the Silver Bounty Hunter

621
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:28,082
and then fugitives from
justice in Penglai

622
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:37,749
Brothers and sisters

623
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:38,915
You follow me.

624
00:56:38,916 --> 00:56:40,415
You guys are getting worse and worse.

625
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,874
But it's fun.

626
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,749
Comfortable

627
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:56,832
Xiao Tian

628
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,624
Very hot

629
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,415
Erlang,
where are we going next?

630
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:39,683
{\an9}<b>Divine Realm
The Clarity Tower of Fang Yi</b>

631
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:42,207
The lampshade is in the tower

632
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:48,457
The lights come from the lampshade

633
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:52,124
I don't know who found
this lampshade.

634
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,665
It was used as a navigation light.

635
00:57:58,875 --> 00:57:59,957
Do you have to drink so much?

636
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:04,207
Long ago in heaven and earth

637
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,415
All dynasties must...

638
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:09,957
The only thing that matters is wine

639
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:13,332
How can we know the rest?

640
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:38,749
King Zeng Chang

641
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:42,082
Long time no see.

642
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:46,374
Waiting for a long time

643
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,582
Nice to meet you.

644
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:51,915
This is Chen Xiang

645
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,165
Kill Master

646
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:57,124
King Zeng Chang

647
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,249
You Know

648
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:05,165
Sooner or later,
the birds will fly out

649
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:10,290
We demon brothers don't want
to see that side of the world.

650
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:12,082
From now on there will be chaos.

651
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,499
But that group of birds

652
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,457
how can they survive for long?

653
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:21,249
This Huashan

654
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:24,290
Although it looks shaky today

655
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:29,124
It took our lives to
hold that bird at bay.

656
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,124
For one more day

657
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,332
As long as we can

658
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:37,457
Mo Liqing

659
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,457
Then this time

660
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,415
You and I are now enemies,

661
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:29,290
This is real.

662
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,249
Doppelganger

663
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:46,290
You can do it too.

664
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:02,332
At a young age

665
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:05,540
How dare you learn the
evil art of Shen Gong Bao?

666
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:07,749
And trained as a genin.

667
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:11,249
I can win, anything goes.

668
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:48,957
Run, boy!

669
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:04,874
{\an9}Chen Xiang

670
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:07,790
Hurry up and leave!

671
01:05:22,145 --> 01:05:24,055
Hurry up and leave!

672
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,540
Brother

673
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,790
We meet again

674
01:06:06,416 --> 01:06:08,957
You still look good.

675
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,249
Shen Gong Bao

676
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:47,342
Yang Jian

677
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,790
Long time no see.

678
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,749
I heard you were very late.

679
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,582
The eyes of heaven have been damaged.

680
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:04,249
How unfortunate, the young Yang
Jian who defended Lotus Mountain.

681
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:08,165
I like that Yang Jian

682
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,165
What about Chen Xiang, Shen Gong Bao?

683
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,374
He escaped on his own.

684
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:24,540
That cruel kid.

685
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:27,415
Like when I was young.

686
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,749
He is my heir.

687
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,957
Do you know where Chen Xiang went?

688
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:40,582
His little secret

689
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:45,767
Lishan

690
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:48,540
Du Yue's pond

691
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,249
Your wounds

692
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:08,290
Who is it?

693
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:13,124
Life is like a Parasite

694
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,707
What's the point of
worrying too much?

695
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:22,915
I' m not happy today.

696
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:27,040
The years...

697
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:30,415
such a rush

698
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:53,586
<b>Divine Realm
Toudu Kou</b>

699
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:06,165
reliable?

700
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:10,582
It' s done.

701
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,915
What's going on? I snuck
in some stowaways.

702
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,332
Clear

703
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,374
Anyway,
it' just a small stowaway device.

704
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:19,290
Only one person can be sent there

705
01:10:36,663 --> 01:10:37,663
It was long,

706
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,082
I' ll also go.

707
01:11:13,538 --> 01:11:16,016
I forgot to say, back then.

708
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:17,040
A bit shaky.

709
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:18,124
What do you mean?

710
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:21,332
Long peace on earth

711
01:12:06,218 --> 01:12:11,883
<b>Human Realm
Chang'an</b>

712
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,124
This is Chang'an?

713
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:39,957
There is a war on earth

714
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:46,370
<b>Lishan</b>

715
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:25,790
You' re coming.

716
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:35,499
New Lamp

717
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,165
Oil for the lamp

718
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,499
Old lampshades

719
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,124
Bao Lian lantern

720
01:13:54,791 --> 01:13:56,124
What is this?

721
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:01,832
Since you' ve come.

722
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:02,874
No need to hide.

723
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:04,726
You tell Chen Xiang

724
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,749
The real purpose of the Bao Lian Lantern

725
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:10,707
Why are you here?

726
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,540
Under the Lotus Peak in Huashan

727
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,332
The flock of Xuan birds has been subdued

728
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:25,707
They are the spirits of all fire

729
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,832
They have the power to
destroy the earth and the sky.

730
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:30,957
When they explode,
heaven and earth will be destroyed.

731
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:34,040
Nüwa gave your mother the Lantern
This precious Bao Lian lantern

732
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:36,832
She guards the Lotus Peak day and night.

733
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,624
But twelve years ago

734
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,165
The birds were restless

735
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:43,540
Bao Lian's lantern couldn't hold them back.

736
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:46,499
I have been ordered by
Master to help your mother.

737
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:49,415
But Xuan's strength
is too strong.

738
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:52,290
The lamp is broken.

739
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,165
Last Moment

740
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:01,249
Your mother jumped from Lotus Peak

741
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,040
Trying to block
Xuan with her own body.

742
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,290
Brother, I'm counting on you.

743
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:08,499
Sister!

744
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,207
You must guard Lotus Peak.

745
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:29,957
I used the axe and drove it into the rock.

746
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,874
Finally, the bird was stopped.

747
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:41,980
And the Eye of the heavens

748
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:45,207
Can never be opened again

749
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:58,457
That is why my mother was
sealed under the Lotus Peak.

750
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,124
Not because she
married a human

751
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:03,415
Chen Xiang

752
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:06,249
My mom married a human too

753
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:08,374
She gave birth to me and your mother

754
01:16:09,833 --> 01:16:12,540
I was too injured to take care of you.

755
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:14,374
So I sent you to Jinxia Cave.

756
01:16:14,383 --> 01:16:16,434
Then why did you never visit me?

757
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:17,832
You're my uncle!

758
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:24,290
Master said I'm not allowed
to visit you until you grow up.

759
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:30,332
Is he telling the truth,
Granny Wan?

760
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,073
Granny Wan

761
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:36,874
he' s telling
the truth

762
01:16:38,213 --> 01:16:39,213
Yang Jian

763
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:41,790
Your mother, You Ji, is my sister.

764
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:44,665
I have a name.

765
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,040
Goddess Wushan

766
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:50,415
There's more to it than that.

767
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:53,332
Follow me.

768
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,290
Huashan

769
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,457
That's Lotus Peak

770
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:13,624
That light

771
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,749
The birds at the
bottom of the peak

772
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,082
in a state of restlessness

773
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,582
My mother,
she is trapped under that mountain.

774
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,332
The beacon on this hill

775
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:33,707
It is said that king Zhou
tried to make her laugh

776
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:35,415
Fire Beacon

777
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:36,582
The result

778
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:39,957
death of the body and
destruction of the kingdom

779
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,874
Everything is the woman's fault

780
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:52,207
Do you know why the Bao Lian
was used to prevent Xuan?

781
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,415
Because of Jinxia Cave.

782
01:17:58,666 --> 01:18:01,999
In the beginning,
your master used the power of the Xuan bird

783
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,832
This is how the cave was built

784
01:18:04,541 --> 01:18:05,624
The xuan bird came out

785
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:07,415
Jinxia Cave will collapse as a result.

786
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:09,874
Subdue the Xuan Bird

787
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,540
Keep Jinxia Cave from collapsing.

788
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:15,290
That is the true purpose of your master's
request that you restrain Bird Xuan.

789
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,582
{\an9}Master only told me

790
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,707
that you can save the
world by stopping that bird.

791
01:18:19,723 --> 01:18:20,892
Endure the Great Tribulation

792
01:18:20,916 --> 01:18:22,749
He didn't tell me that it had
something to do with Jinxia Cave.

793
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:24,499
Your master is only for himself.

794
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:28,790
Everything must go full circle

795
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,415
The Xuan bird must finally fly away.

796
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:32,665
Can it be stopped?

797
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,124
Remember when you split the Lotus Mountain?

798
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:46,415
When was that?

799
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,915
I cleaved the Lotus Mountain

800
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:51,999
The last great disaster

801
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:55,457
Your master is just a man
who protects his Jinxia Cave.

802
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,499
Your master lied to you.

803
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:00,499
We split Huashan

804
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,874
Save Yang Chan.

805
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:26,249
Miss Wan Luo,
even if what you say is true

806
01:19:26,666 --> 01:19:27,665
But it's a big deal.

807
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,207
I must take you to see my Master.

808
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,249
And face it head-on

809
01:19:32,916 --> 01:19:34,790
Chen Xiang, you come too.

810
01:19:35,565 --> 01:19:37,085
Who wants to come?

811
01:19:37,458 --> 01:19:39,415
You're the same as that cave man.

812
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,790
If you don't go,
I'll go alone.

813
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:43,290
Chen Xiang

814
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:46,624
It has come to this

815
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:48,165
You still want to find your teacher?

816
01:20:54,166 --> 01:20:55,332
Goddess Wushan

817
01:20:55,958 --> 01:20:57,957
I'm just afraid Chen Xiang is with you.

818
01:20:57,958 --> 01:20:59,624
Will end up like Shen Gong Bao

819
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:05,540
Why are you saying that?

820
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,415
That time at the Ying Chau Music Hall.

821
01:21:08,416 --> 01:21:09,749
.. I was mesmerized in my dreams

822
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,374
In that dream,
mother told me to go to the mountain

823
01:21:12,402 --> 01:21:13,402
Jian'er

824
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:14,790
Splitting the mountain

825
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,707
That person is not really my mother

826
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,165
That's you.

827
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:19,999
Goddess Wushan

828
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,915
The dream is upside down and confusing

829
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:24,290
This is your way.

830
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:28,332
Chen Xiang's Master

831
01:21:28,464 --> 01:21:30,130
Of course Chen Xiang didn't hurt him

832
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:32,332
Neither did Shen Gong Bao.

833
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:34,832
The wound on my brother's body

834
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:36,374
Is a piece of silk screen

835
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:39,040
When I found Shen Gong Bao

836
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:40,415
He was still alive.

837
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,707
Although he was first injured
by a powerful magic weapon

838
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,540
But what really
killed him was...

839
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,707
The same silk screen wound

840
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:50,540
Just before

841
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:52,790
The net that you threw in the
middle of a precarious situation.

842
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,290
And the net

843
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:57,332
Is your unique magic.

844
01:21:58,541 --> 01:21:59,540
Chen Xiang's Master

845
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:00,874
And Shen Gong Bao

846
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:04,332
You killed them all.

847
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:09,790
You

848
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:19,749
Great

849
01:22:20,708 --> 01:22:22,582
Why did you kill them?

850
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:23,874
Your teacher isn't dead yet.

851
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:25,874
How did you leave Jinxia Cave?

852
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:28,707
Unfortunately Shen Gong Bao

853
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,374
We agreed to work together

854
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:33,582
How could he be injured so badly?

855
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:34,832
It's better that he dies.

856
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:37,665
I must help him end it.

857
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,665
Why did you do it?

858
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,040
Chen Xiang, I did all these things

859
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,624
To split the mountain.

860
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,999
To save your mother

861
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,124
Not like you.

862
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:51,457
But you still
can't kill them.

863
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:01,415
Stop it!

864
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,040
I

865
01:24:32,625 --> 01:24:33,499
Give it back to me.

866
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:38,082
It's too hot.

867
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:39,540
I took it off for you.

868
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:43,249
It was on the wrist
the whole time.

869
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:44,749
No one can take it off.

870
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:46,665
How can you

871
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,124
Maybe...

872
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:51,624
Because I am your blood uncle.

873
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:57,415
Your mother wove this from her hair.

874
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:00,499
Before she jumped from Lotus Peak.

875
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,499
Asked me to give you this hair rope.

876
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:11,249
This hair rope is the wick

877
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:13,874
Ignite the wick of the Bao Lian Lantern.

878
01:25:22,708 --> 01:25:24,457
I miss mom so much.

879
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:34,374
Let's go to Huashan

880
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:39,874
On the way we discuss this

881
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:05,457
Nine Revolving Mysteries

882
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:49,648
{\an7}<b>Human Realm
Huashan</b>

883
01:27:57,333 --> 01:27:58,374
your home

884
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,124
This is my home.

885
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:20,832
Mom

886
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:39,499
Let's go.

887
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,707
These are the characters
in the list of deities

888
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:39,582
I'm too familiar with them.

889
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:43,624
There really are gods in Huashan

890
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:10,582
This is my mountain axe.

891
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:13,749
It seals the mountain you split

892
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,624
Not completely.

893
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:18,749
The power of the Xuan Bird that appeared

894
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:20,457
You can see it.

895
01:31:47,277 --> 01:31:48,277
Yang Jian

896
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:49,790
Hurry up and leave!

897
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:55,124
Strap on

898
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:56,249
Chen Xiang, go back!

899
01:32:08,493 --> 01:32:09,493
Uncle!

900
01:32:45,208 --> 01:32:47,749
Finally caught you, you traitor!

901
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,915
How precious is Taiji's diagram?

902
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,040
When you think of something,
it will appear.

903
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:59,999
The mind thinks of everything
and everything comes.

904
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:05,999
Only this Taiji diagram
can trap Yang Jian.

905
01:33:32,637 --> 01:33:33,637
Jian'er

906
01:33:40,485 --> 01:33:41,485
Jian'er

907
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:46,124
Mom? Mom!

908
01:33:51,073 --> 01:33:51,726
Jian'er

909
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,249
Splitting the Mountain

910
01:34:17,698 --> 01:34:18,698
Jian'er

911
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:21,582
Mom

912
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,207
Lotus Mountain has been opened

913
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,999
It's time for me to go.

914
01:34:33,791 --> 01:34:34,832
Why?

915
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:37,749
This is destiny.

916
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:40,374
The fate of the women in our family

917
01:34:40,583 --> 01:34:42,207
Is to defend the mountain

918
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:45,207
To protect the peace of the world

919
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:51,290
Mom

920
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:55,915
No need to cry

921
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:58,207
You see?

922
01:34:59,291 --> 01:35:01,332
This little fire

923
01:35:01,916 --> 01:35:03,082
It's all mom.

924
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:06,499
All things are alive and well

925
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:09,540
I live in this heaven and earth

926
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:10,082
No

927
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,570
Longing for me...

928
01:35:12,333 --> 01:35:14,832
Look at all the light in the world

929
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:17,457
And you see me.

930
01:35:17,791 --> 01:35:19,790
Mom

931
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,624
I have split the Lotus mountain

932
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:28,082
Where is Mother?

933
01:35:31,208 --> 01:35:33,332
Defend Huashan

934
01:35:33,915 --> 01:35:35,435
Defend Huashan

935
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,249
Peace in the World

936
01:35:37,416 --> 01:35:39,249
Defend Huashan

937
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,540
Peace in the World

938
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:44,249
I'm counting on you, brother

939
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,780
Your eyes haven't improved

940
01:36:25,416 --> 01:36:26,915
12 years ago

941
01:36:27,625 --> 01:36:29,957
You sealed the Lotus Peak

942
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:32,082
but

943
01:36:32,583 --> 01:36:34,457
there were many disasters

944
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:37,540
Maybe I was wrong.

945
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:42,415
All things must suffer
again after all

946
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:44,582
Master

947
01:36:47,125 --> 01:36:50,749
To keep the truth alive

948
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:58,999
How can we not try
to redeem it?

949
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,207
Master

950
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:40,082
This is the Taiji diagram

951
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:42,374
You trapped me in a Taiji diagram.

952
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:47,082
My wonderful student.

953
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,457
You were able to slow down
the illusion of the taiji diagram.

954
01:37:52,875 --> 01:37:53,749
I remember

955
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:55,499
I remember the Taiji diagram.

956
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:57,749
I remember Yin Hong
being attacked by his master.

957
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,749
Turning into flying ashes
in the Taiji diagram.

958
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,999
Master, what did I do wrong?

959
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:06,510
Yang Jian

960
01:38:07,791 --> 01:38:10,374
I can't allow Chen
Xiang to split Huashan

961
01:38:10,833 --> 01:38:14,082
It's really all because of Jinxia Cave

962
01:38:15,708 --> 01:38:16,915
You know

963
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,874
Jinxia Cave must not fall

964
01:38:21,958 --> 01:38:23,441
I've worked very hard

965
01:38:23,475 --> 01:38:26,915
to keep Jinxia Cave
from falling overnight.

966
01:38:27,666 --> 01:38:28,749
So

967
01:38:29,416 --> 01:38:31,207
Yang Chan is under Huashan

968
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:32,790
That is his destiny.

969
01:38:38,545 --> 01:38:39,545
Jian'er

970
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:42,124
You don't know.

971
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,915
Your Yang family

972
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:45,540
Mother and child

973
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:49,749
are born into a great tribulation
that will shake heaven and earth.

974
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:52,915
For the sake of world peace

975
01:38:53,333 --> 01:38:55,582
Mothers hold back the mountains

976
01:38:57,375 --> 01:38:57,999
And the son

977
01:38:58,791 --> 01:39:00,249
To free the mother

978
01:39:00,666 --> 01:39:02,457
he had to struggle to split the mountain

979
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:04,915
You don't know.

980
01:39:05,083 --> 01:39:05,457
Splitting the mountain

981
01:39:06,125 --> 01:39:08,499
Bird Xuan came out of
the Jinxia Cave collapse.

982
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:13,582
Bringing great tribulation to the world.

983
01:39:19,125 --> 01:39:21,624
Until the Great Tribulation ends

984
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:24,790
the world will not be calm once again

985
01:39:26,291 --> 01:39:30,801
Jian'er

986
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:35,832
You are the one who will split the mountain

987
01:39:37,166 --> 01:39:41,249
This time it's Chen Xiang's turn

988
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:50,665
Master

989
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:53,957
I didn't have a father and mother back then

990
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:57,624
You took me in and raised me.

991
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,957
You taught me all kinds of
mystical arts and techniques.

992
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:02,457
Used me so that I could someday

993
01:40:02,916 --> 01:40:05,040
have the power to split Peach Mountain

994
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:08,874
And you took Chen
Xiang under your wing

995
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:11,006
Not to teach him the mystic
arts and not to tell him-.

996
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:12,499
-about his life so that he
could understand the folly of

997
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:15,624
You deceived him so that he
couldn't go and split Huashan.

998
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:17,165
Right

999
01:40:19,916 --> 01:40:21,624
I'm just like your mom.

1000
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:24,499
I'm here to keep the world safe.

1001
01:40:25,083 --> 01:40:27,624
As long as Bird Xuan stays at the
bottom of the mountain for a while.

1002
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,665
Jinxia Cave will last a moment longer.

1003
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:34,249
Jinxia Cave will not last long.

1004
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:37,082
Xuan Bird is becoming stronger
the longer it is suppressed.

1005
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:38,957
One day it will explode.

1006
01:40:39,458 --> 01:40:40,999
You protect your Jinxia Cave

1007
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:44,374
It's not about disaster at all,
it's about protecting yourself.

1008
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:48,957
This Jinxia Cave is the
result of my life's work.

1009
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:51,832
We're all in this together.

1010
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:55,749
And lost it all.

1011
01:40:57,625 --> 01:40:59,165
Even if it's wrong

1012
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:02,165
It's only wrong until the end.

1013
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:10,915
Master

1014
01:41:12,458 --> 01:41:15,582
I'm just a pawn for you.

1015
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:21,374
To me Jinxia Cave

1016
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:25,290
I can only bring you together.

1017
01:41:25,291 --> 01:41:27,957
With Taiji's diagram

1018
01:42:07,416 --> 01:42:09,624
Tying the Eternal Rope with Taiji Diagram

1019
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:13,665
I borrowed it from your
brothers and uncles.

1020
01:42:14,541 --> 01:42:16,582
We have the same plan.

1021
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:19,707
The world can't get any messier.

1022
01:42:46,041 --> 01:42:46,457
Chen Xiang

1023
01:42:48,333 --> 01:42:49,207
guard the Bao Lian Lantern

1024
01:43:01,764 --> 01:43:02,764
Bao LIan Lantern

1025
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,082
Nine Mystical Turns

1026
01:43:27,083 --> 01:43:28,082
Not a bad improvement

1027
01:44:01,958 --> 01:44:03,874
Bird Xuan's strength is very strong.

1028
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:05,874
Cutting the Taiji diagram

1029
01:45:37,375 --> 01:45:38,707
He used the power of Bird Xuan

1030
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:40,082
opened the eyes of the heavens

1031
01:45:57,541 --> 01:45:58,874
Master

1032
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,749
Don't make a
single mistake.

1033
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:10,249
Heaven and Earth

1034
01:46:53,833 --> 01:46:54,374
Not good.

1035
01:46:54,666 --> 01:46:55,540
Stop him!

1036
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:41,832
Master!

1037
01:48:42,458 --> 01:48:44,082
My mother's guard,

1038
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:46,749
That's not your
Jinxia Cave.

1039
01:48:47,083 --> 01:48:49,540
But all things are alive and well.

1040
01:50:56,413 --> 01:50:57,413
Uncle!

1041
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:08,790
Lotus Peak can no longer be sealed

1042
01:51:09,458 --> 01:51:10,582
If it continues like this

1043
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:11,499
The sky will collapse.

1044
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:13,665
Chen Xiang

1045
01:51:14,666 --> 01:51:16,749
My mother and I keep the peace of the world

1046
01:51:17,458 --> 01:51:18,540
Not Jinxia Cave

1047
01:51:20,416 --> 01:51:21,957
Go split the mountain

1048
01:52:50,541 --> 01:52:53,891
Mom!

1049
01:53:05,875 --> 01:53:07,040
My son

1050
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:18,665
Mom!

1051
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:23,790
My son

1052
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,707
{\an7}You've grown up.

1053
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:30,790
Mom!

1054
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:03,957
How is it possible

1055
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:11,665
My son!

1056
01:54:44,958 --> 01:54:45,832
Brother,

1057
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:49,290
I'll need you to
take care of him.

1058
01:55:02,833 --> 01:55:03,499
Mom

1059
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:04,415
Where are you going?

1060
01:55:05,833 --> 01:55:07,707
I'm going with Bird Xuan.

1061
01:55:08,333 --> 01:55:09,915
To protect the world

1062
01:55:10,375 --> 01:55:11,540
Protect you.

1063
01:55:16,958 --> 01:55:17,707
Mom

1064
01:55:18,208 --> 01:55:19,124
Don't go!

1065
01:55:21,416 --> 01:55:22,124
Mom

1066
01:55:59,625 --> 01:56:03,243
WHY

1067
01:56:12,083 --> 01:56:14,749
Your mother has become
one with Xuan Bird Qi.

1068
01:56:15,791 --> 01:56:16,957
Huashan has split

1069
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,249
Xuan Bird flew away.

1070
01:56:19,291 --> 01:56:20,749
And he went with it.

1071
01:56:24,708 --> 01:56:25,957
With you there.

1072
01:56:27,166 --> 01:56:28,999
With everything in this world

1073
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,249
He will return

1074
01:56:50,543 --> 01:56:54,363
Light Chaser
Animation Works

1075
02:01:53,416 --> 02:01:56,207
Sun Wu Kong comes out
of the Water Curtain Cave.

1076
02:01:56,458 --> 02:01:57,707
Raising his eyes to see

1077
02:01:58,666 --> 02:02:01,124
What a graceful face!

1078
02:02:01,298 --> 02:02:04,047
This person is the Jade
Emperor's own nephew.

1079
02:02:04,375 --> 02:02:09,499
Erlang, the god who conquered the
Xuan with his axe on Peach Mountain

1080
02:02:14,298 --> 02:02:15,298
Yang Jian

1081
02:02:16,416 --> 02:02:17,749
Yang Jian, what happened to Yang Jian?

1082
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:21,832
Erlang God is amazing!

1083
02:02:27,708 --> 02:02:29,165
You can't beat Yang Jian

1084
02:02:31,708 --> 02:02:34,707
That's a story

1085
02:02:35,598 --> 02:02:37,976
I'll tell you.
Here's the deal.

1086
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:38,790
This is...

1087
02:02:48,833 --> 02:02:51,945
Please look forward to
The sequel to the New Gods series

1088

Moving to a place like Changsha

1089
02:03:07,708 --> 02:03:10,707
Looking west from Chang'an,
no home in sight.

1090
02:03:13,666 --> 02:03:16,374
Playing the Jade Flute at
the Yellow Crane Tower.

1091
02:03:17,583 --> 02:03:22,499
Jiang City in May,
but the winter plum blossoms are falling
