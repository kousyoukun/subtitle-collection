3
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,510
A long, long time ago,

4
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:55,931
a calamity broke out
between heaven and earth.

5
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:01,187
Life hung in the balance.

6
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,190
As the world filled
with violence and destruction,

7
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,904
the forces of Shang and Zhou
fought for supremacy

8
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,114
and humans and gods united

9
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,450
to get through the Catastrophe.

10
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,620
The Order of the Gods was set.

11
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,415
Since then, each god
returned to their place

12
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,751
and each created their own cave realm.

13
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,129
The world returned to peace.

14
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,660
This is our last half barrel
of Cosmic Gas.

15
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,370
Erlang, without more jobs

16
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,205
our ship won't be going anywhere.

17
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,382
Listen, Boss.

18
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,884
We haven't worked in a while.

19
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,094
We have to buy gas.

20
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,310
Yao,

21
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,896
in the past, we all danced in the clouds.

22
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,731
But since that Cosmic Catastrophe,

23
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,482
except for those with wings,

24
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,775
immortals and demons

25
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,402
have to rely on flying boats.

26
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,071
That Catastrophe...

27
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,573
When was that exactly?

28
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:20,951
Too long ago.

29
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,077
Too true.

30
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,246
I already forgot how to fly.

31
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,291
Talking about it
feels like a fairy tale...

32
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,643
There's a job notice.

33
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,979
It's from Penglai, Home of the Gods.

34
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:51,440
Finally, our luck's changing.
We're right in Penglai.

35
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,610
We have to beat
other bounty hunters to it.

36
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,906
Only twenty thousand?

37
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,619
The guy looks pretty ruthless.

38
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,871
Even the Penglai gods are poor.

39
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,581
If we don't work soon,

40
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,667
we'll starve.

41
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,595
Well, let's try our luck then.

42
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,067
It's that time of morning.

43
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,861
Vermillion Bird Gate is now open.

44
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,530
Carefree and harmonious,

45
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,323
Penglai welcomes

46
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,035
all gods and spirits

47
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,745
and wishes security and prosperity.

48
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,539
May you all be safe,

49
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,416
and stay in your lane.

50
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,174
Want the Elixir of Life?

51
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,717
Show me the money.

52
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,636
Or get lost.

53
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,764
Not interested in fake meds.

54
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,432
If that's the case, get lost.

55
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,310
One immortal,

56
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:34,561
one demon.

57
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,688
That's quite a pair.

58
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,273
When times are tough,

59
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,942
any pair will do.

60
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,153
Better a dog than a washed up god, right?

61
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,030
True.

62
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,199
My dog has an easier life than me.

63
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,453
See, it got its smell all over me.

64
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,510
Twenty thousand.

65
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,809
I thought you were some kind of sheriff.

66
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,812
Turns out you're a bounty hunter.

67
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,218
Ow, ow, ow!

68
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,262
Still got a hard head.

69
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:56,727
Where are you going?

70
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,604
I'm after money, not your life.

71
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,191
Be careful!

72
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,490
MEDS

73
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,686
What the--

74
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:45,502
Great, now I run out of gas.

75
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,297
Want to catch me?

76
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,220
What the hell?!

77
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,182
Excellent timing.

78
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,018
It's her nose.

79
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,185
You know how it is.

80
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,688
She caught your scent, we chased you up.

81
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,985
You're back!

82
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:14,614
Enough, enough.

83
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,867
What's all this?

84
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,452
An offense to public decency.

85
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,290
I like it. You jealous?

86
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,792
Bro, you're in it for the money, yeah?

87
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,170
Let me go.
I'll pay five times the reward.

88
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,088
One hundred thousand.

89
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,841
You little snake oil peddler.
Who'd believe you?

90
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,176
It's true. Really.

91
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,635
It's buried by a bridge.

92
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,054
Only I know about it.

93
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:38,972
Boss,

94
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,557
that doesn't sounds so bad.

95
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,477
Let's see...

96
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,561
I'll ask for you.

97
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,855
What's that?

98
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,566
I'm asking the cosmos,

99
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,526
do I release you or not?

100
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,569
How's that sound?

101
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,704
DETENTION

102
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:04,915
Twenty thousand.

103
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,345
Boss, when you
threw the harmonica,

104
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,846
was it heads up you let him go

105
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,139
or tails up you let him go?

106
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,474
You didn't say.

107
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:42,786
Enough.

108
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,038
We have money!

109
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:46,957
Someone's asking for you.

110
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,333
We've got a customer.

111
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:51,253
Yes, and it's a pretty lady.

112
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,712
Really pretty.

113
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,214
Coming here to see me?

114
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,137
Are you Mu Erlang?

115
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,308
Surname Mu, second in line,

116
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,601
so Mu Erlang,
that's me.

117
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,603
I'm looking for someone.

118
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,480
We're bounty hunters.

119
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,983
We catch people, we don't look for them.

120
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:15,777
I want you to catch someone.

121
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,530
That fits the job description.

122
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,200
He stole a treasure. It was my sister's.

123
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,827
What was it?

124
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,539
I can't tell you.

125
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,375
Cool.

126
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,127
Me...

127
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,753
Thinking gives me a headache.

128
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,174
My head already hurts.
So don't tell me.

129
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,011
Have a cup.

130
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,931
My sister and I were always close.

131
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,311
She disappeared after
the upheaval 12 years ago.

132
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,732
All she left behind was that treasure.
It's a family heirloom.

133
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,942
Can you help me?

134
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,737
At your service, but it'll cost.

135
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,621
This is all I have. Take it all.

136
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,857
Okay, I'll tell you.

137
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,318
It's called the "Lamp of Wishes."

138
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,490
They say it contains
all that other vessels cannot.

139
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,369
That's the treasure he stole.
He fled to Square Pot Fairy Island.

140
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,621
This person you seek...

141
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,164
he has a name, right?

142
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,541
Chenxiang.

143
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,417
Chenxiang.

144
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,962
What, have you heard of him?

145
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,757
It's an uncommon name.

146
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,973
Take care!

147
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm Wanluo.
I'll wait in Yingzhou for news.

148
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,191
There's a story there.

149
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,818
Definitely.

150
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,028
Her way of dressing, this ship,

151
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,446
and those manners.

152
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,200
But why'd she come to us?

153
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,537
Other than being the cheapest,
we don't have much going for us.

154
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,250
Next 15 days only!

155
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,002
While supplies last.

156
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,046
Highest quality,

157
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,965
smoothest flying.

158
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,926
Next order, three bags of Cosmic Gas.

159
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:46,803
Collect it over there, sir.

160
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,430
Three bags, coming right up.

161
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,550
Alright, you can pass.

162
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,398
You're in my way, squirt.

163
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,358
No fighting!

164
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,567
You got some nerve!

165
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,320
No fighting! Stop it!

166
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,202
You got some nerve!

167
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,663
Do it!

168
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,325
You're asking for trouble.

169
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:34,786
Get outta there!

170
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,746
Shut up and don't move.

171
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,297
Boss, Heaven's Army is coming.

172
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,007
Who raised the alarm?

173
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,179
Run!

174
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:26,648
Over there!

175
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,442
You guys, get them!

176
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:43,998
Get on the boat!

177
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,249
Start it up!

178
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,129
Wait for me.

179
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,839
- You little jerk.
- Stop!

180
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,845
Ready for take-off.

181
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,894
Initialization complete.

182
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,855
Next station is Square Pot.

183
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,859
Estimated time of arrival, 7:45 PM.

184
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,153
Please be securely seated.

185
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,322
Wishing you safe soaring.

186
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,846
Welcome, sir.

187
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,100
This way, please.

188
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,312
Beat it. No money, no play.

189
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,488
CASINO

190
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:29,664
Here goes!

191
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,501
Place your bets.

192
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,798
Erlang.

193
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,426
Erlang, you're back.

194
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,553
Gao.

195
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,096
What can I do for you?

196
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,305
I need to ask you something.

197
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:49,267
These ears of mine...
not hearing so well these days.

198
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,188
Even deaf you'd still be Big Ears.

199
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,608
Well, I do owe you.

200
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:58,901
What do you want to know?

201
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,487
I'm looking for someone. Chenxiang.

202
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,530
Chenxiang?

203
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,033
Never heard of him.

204
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,374
I gotta go.

205
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,381
Hello, gentlemen.

206
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,052
What a surprise.

207
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,849
Let me get a good look at you.

208
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,402
Don't be so rough.

209
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,699
Blind!

210
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,409
It's really blind!

211
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,164
"Mu Erlang,

212
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,708
bounty hunter."

213
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,252
I say Mu--
Ah no, no, no...

214
00:22:58,628 --> 00:22:59,754
Brother Mu.

215
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,923
So your Three-Pointed Double Spear,

216
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,093
and your Silver-Bullet Slingshot...

217
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,345
They're all gone!

218
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,765
Everyone!

219
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:14,644
This is the legendary Yang Jian.

220
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,812
That's Erlang?

221
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,230
How'd he fall so low?

222
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,733
Exactly. How did you fall so low?

223
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,861
No problem. I'll tell them for you.

224
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,076
They say that 12 years ago,

225
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,870
the Goddess Yang Chan

226
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,997
fell in love with a mortal,

227
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,374
breaking Heaven's laws.

228
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,877
So Yang Jian trapped her under Mount Hua.

229
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,381
But she's his own sister.

230
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:50,596
Before she was trapped,
Yang Chan fought back hard,

231
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,641
using Mount Hua's Legendary Lotus Lamp

232
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,143
to blind his Third Eye

233
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,519
and destroy his magic powers.

234
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:01,190
Since then his powers have disappeared.

235
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,445
I ask you...

236
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:07,905
What kind of person,

237
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,199
on account of some dumb laws,

238
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,870
would trap his own sister
under a mountain,

239
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,915
wrecking a marriage and family?

240
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,170
Yang Jian,

241
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,339
back then when you arrested us three

242
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,216
you were so high and mighty.

243
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:28,926
Today,

244
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,388
I'm going to give you a good beating.

245
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,693
Keep playing.

246
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,950
The Mo Brothers?

247
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,536
Mo Lihong, Mo Lihai?

248
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,382
Yang Jian. I never imagined

249
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:11,677
it would be me saving you one day.

250
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,807
For 12 years, since Mount Hua,

251
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,560
there's been no news of you.

252
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:23,231
And here you are, a bounty hunter.

253
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,066
I have to eat somehow.

254
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:26,817
Just now, from over there

255
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,861
I heard you ask about someone.

256
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,363
The bounty.

257
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,697
Don't go looking for him.

258
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,574
It's him we're after.

259
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:35,576
Do not get involved.

260
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,036
Otherwise...

261
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,205
Are you really threatening Yang Jian?

262
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,709
Yang Jian, you really aren't
the god you used to be.

263
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,253
Thanks, gentlemen.

264
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:58,808
Come back here!

265
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,315
Move!

266
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,402
Just try and get away!

267
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,342
At last, I've got you. There's no escape.

268
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,847
Boss Hai, are these your new men?

269
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:42,268
You killed the others on that boat.

270
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,353
Hand it over.

271
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:45,688
What?

272
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,858
What you stole from the hold.

273
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,776
Says who?

274
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,986
Me.

275
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,656
I went and got Boss Hai.

276
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,617
Boss Hai, your new pet?

277
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,998
The most valuable thing on that boat

278
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,625
was the thing you stole.

279
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,377
Hand it over

280
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:13,215
and maybe I'll just take an arm and a leg.

281
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,308
Blindy, stay out of it.

282
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,186
Excuse me.

283
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,648
Boss Hai, you have your men,

284
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:30,900
I have mine.

285
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,613
Take this. Now, fight!

286
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,908
No, you got it wrong.

287
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,410
You got it wrong.

288
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:44,080
I'll kill you all today.

289
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,498
I don't even know him!

290
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:48,959
Do it!

291
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,368
Thank you for your help.
Later, I'll repay you in spades.

292
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,122
Did you have to be so violent?

293
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,541
If I'd fallen into their hands

294
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,585
it would've been
ten times worse than death.

295
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,512
What is this?

296
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,140
You actually gave me your treasure.

297
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,725
So they'd think you were on my side.

298
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:48,978
You didn't worry I'd keep it?

299
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,062
I'd kill you then.

300
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,773
You talk big.

301
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:54,567
Do you know who I am?

302
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,612
It doesn't matter who. I'd still kill you.

303
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,911
I'm Yang Jian, from Plum Hill.

304
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,166
Chenxiang...

305
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:12,710
How do you know my name?

306
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,421
So it's true.

307
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,008
Someone asked me to find you.

308
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,984
Yang Jian, you again?

309
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,736
And you, what's this about?

310
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:42,490
You actually--

311
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:44,992
Listen,

312
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,411
I just bumped into him.

313
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,833
Knifed to death. That's not Yang Jian.

314
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,710
Of course not.

315
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:59,006
The guy who ran off is your Chenxiang.

316
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,758
Really? What a coincidence.

317
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,177
A petty thief.

318
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,554
Is he worth all that fuss?

319
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:08,933
You really don't know who he is?

320
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,519
He is from your master's school.
A disciple of the younger generation.

321
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,399
Since you're already involved,

322
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:18,817
ask about him

323
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:22,446
from your Master Yuding.

324
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,338
Sir, that was amazing!

325
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,220
Please ask the Master
if he'd receive his disciple Yang Jian.

326
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,973
Elder Disciple Yang!

327
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,142
Elder Disciple, follow me!

328
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,477
Jian, you're here.

329
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,155
Your Third Eye is still closed?

330
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,698
Yes.

331
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,159
It's that bad.

332
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,121
If I try hard, I can open it a crack.

333
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,791
But I only see bright,
flashing gold light.

334
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,709
Nothing else.

335
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,214
Hard to remedy.

336
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:51,553
Maybe something could force it open

337
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,849
but it might make the wound worse.

338
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,309
True.

339
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,354
You came here as a child.

340
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,981
I treated you like a son.

341
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,735
12 years ago,

342
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,571
you sealed Lotus Peak.

343
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,450
But the disasters rolled on.

344
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,037
The godly realm weakened by the day

345
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:21,083
and demons and monsters arose.

346
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,128
Maybe I was wrong.

347
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:31,510
Catastrophe will return to the world.

348
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,055
Master, you teach us,

349
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:36,724
"Do everything you can."

350
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,600
Yes.

351
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,936
"Do everything you can."

352
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,856
To restore the righteous order,

353
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,651
shouldn't one try to heal the world?

354
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:49,903
I understand.

355
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:57,453
Master...

356
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,830
Down there, I met a boy.

357
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:03,208
They say he's your disciple.
He's called Chenxiang.

358
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:04,418
Chenxiang?!

359
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,212
He's your nephew. You brought him here.

360
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,384
You wouldn't know that.

361
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,721
When you brought him here

362
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:19,099
he was just a squalling infant.

363
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,686
You haven't seen him in years.

364
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,274
I named him Chenxiang, "Agarwood,"

365
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:33,822
so he'd be as serene and steady
as the agarwood tree.

366
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,158
Who'd have thought

367
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,913
my school

368
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:44,500
produced a murderous traitor.

369
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,838
Go have a look.

370
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,471
The Master sealed his corpse

371
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,139
until he can treat it.

372
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,976
Why would Chenxiang do this?

373
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,145
I saw it coming.

374
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,981
He's a born troublemaker.
An uneducable, sinful creature.

375
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,069
But because of your deeds at Lotus Peak,
Master didn't expel him.

376
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,196
So he asked Second Disciple

377
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,697
to teach and raise him well.

378
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,076
Second Disciple had a bad temper.

379
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,581
What is this wound?

380
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,166
He did it with Shen Gongbao.

381
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,669
They ambushed and killed Second Disciple.

382
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,962
Shen Gongbao...

383
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:31,630
He's back?

384
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,589
Yes.

385
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:35,592
No idea how the kid joined up with him.

386
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:40,222
Shen Gongbao is a master of multiplying.

387
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,933
And they took Second Disciple's
new magic treasure.

388
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,351
What treasure?

389
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,853
The Lamp of Wishes.

390
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,558
Bravo!

391
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,644
Bravo!

392
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,355
Next step?

393
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,693
You have the lamp oil.

394
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:38,947
Next, of course, you need the lamp lid.

395
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,242
Bravo!

396
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,702
I ran into someone.

397
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,495
Who?

398
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,707
Yang Jian. An older disciple of my master.

399
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,043
Him!

400
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,669
He said he's looking for me.

401
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,255
Because of your master?

402
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,467
No. He seems not
to know about that.

403
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:05,766
Come.

404
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:18,946
Come.

405
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,365
Come on.

406
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,663
You know him only as an older disciple.

407
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:31,083
He's actually your uncle.

408
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,044
He... he's my uncle?

409
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,754
It's also him

410
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:39,591
who trapped your mother under Lotus Peak.

411
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,680
Yang Jian's powers are naturally strong.

412
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,474
He repelled the force of the Lotus Lamp

413
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,101
and it shattered into pieces.

414
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,145
If you put it back together

415
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,481
it'll be restored as it once was.

416
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,609
You can use its force

417
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,695
to crack open Lotus Peak

418
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,488
and save your mother.

419
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,205
Yang Jian,

420
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,415
your master,

421
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,917
the lot of them,

422
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,378
they're a pack of wolves.

423
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,090
That group of guys

424
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:25,470
they made me, Shen Gongbao,
a general

425
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,224
and stuffed me out
in a grotto in the East Sea.

426
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:33,186
They talk benevolence and morality

427
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,648
but they're such hypocrites.

428
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,739
So I grit my teeth and put up with it.

429
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,994
So many years have passed.

430
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,580
The chance for revenge

431
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:55,250
is mine at last.

432
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,972
Why is Yang Jian after me?

433
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,726
The Lotus Lamp of course.

434
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,020
That lamp,

435
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:19,566
only your mother's flesh and blood
can activate it.

436
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,611
You.

437
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,712
And they took Second Disciple's
new magic treasure.

438
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,756
The Lamp of Wishes.

439
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,344
He stole a treasure. It was my sister's.

440
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,679
It's called the "Lamp of Wishes."

441
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,433
I'm Wanluo.
I'll wait in Yingzhou for news.

442
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,225
It's starting!

443
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,565
Cosmic Gas really lets people fly.

444
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,400
It's marvelous.

445
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,661
Her modest beauty charms me

446
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:59,958
But my trembling heart is sad

447
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:09,634
For there is no go-between here for us

448
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:24,065
So I offer my jade belt as a pledge

449
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:36,369
To this refined and learned lady

450
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:47,964
She gives me a garnet in return

451
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:53,970
And points me to the river

452
00:41:54,054 --> 00:42:03,188
But I hesitate, unable to go

453
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:08,902
Strings and drums, music with no player.

454
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:43,687
Come, bring my tea.

455
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:49,818
Bring my tea.

456
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,622
Erlang, coming in like that,

457
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,708
you scared me.

458
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,585
My apologies.

459
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,462
I was lost in thought

460
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,715
about your beautiful performance

461
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,592
and forgot myself. It was rude of me.

462
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:21,433
You liked my song?

463
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:24,602
The ethereal sound
still lingers in the air.

464
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,398
Cao Zhi's "Goddess of the Luo River"

465
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:30,817
unfortunately has such sorrowful lyrics.

466
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,657
Such inexpressible pain

467
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:39,200
and anguish...

468
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,162
It's so melancholic.

469
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,973
Why are you staring, Erlang?

470
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:05,560
I don't know.

471
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,479
The last time I saw you,

472
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,606
I felt like I'd met you before.

473
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,900
But I had no idea where.

474
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,905
Maybe it was in your dreams.

475
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,284
Maybe...

476
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,244
I...

477
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,247
am the woman of your dreams.

478
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:30,835
Maybe.

479
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,006
I found Chenxiang.

480
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:37,050
The little thief.

481
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,303
Where is he?

482
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:41,971
He got away again.

483
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,516
Chenxiang was also at my school.

484
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,101
A younger generation.

485
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,728
Mu Erlang, you--

486
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,689
My real name is Yang Jian.

487
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,108
You're Yang Jian!

488
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,318
That Lamp of Wishes

489
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,570
belonged to Chenxiang's master.

490
00:44:58,488 --> 00:44:59,697
So, I'd like to ask

491
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:02,617
why you lied
saying it was your sister's.

492
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,621
Yang Jian...

493
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,081
Some things

494
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,417
are best left unknown.

495
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:20,802
Jian.

496
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:24,973
Mother...

497
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,434
Mother!

498
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:29,936
Jian.

499
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,187
Mother...

500
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,148
- Mother!
- Jian...

501
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,317
- split open the mountain.
- Don't go.

502
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,402
Split open the mountain.

503
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:39,404
Mother!

504
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,751
Mother...

505
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,938
CHENXIANG IS AT SQUARE POT
SHIP GRAVEYARD

506
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:34,185
Not a bad defensive move.

507
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,020
Bit over the top, though.

508
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,068
This...

509
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,113
You're after the Lotus Lamp?

510
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:47,949
What's it to you?

511
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,411
I think you already know.

512
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,662
I'm your uncle.

513
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,958
It's true, I took you to Jin Xia Cave.

514
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,668
You'd only just been born.

515
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:00,920
You didn't even have a name.

516
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,380
You were only...

517
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,090
only a tiny little thing.

518
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,010
That Second Disciple,

519
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:08,970
I knew he had a nasty temper.

520
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,348
I don't know why
Master put you in his care.

521
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,101
Was it hard for you there?

522
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,021
It was fantastic.

523
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,814
Except he didn't teach me anything.

524
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,190
He beat me every day

525
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:22,525
and starved me.

526
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,652
Called me a motherless,
fatherless bastard.

527
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,159
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

528
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:36,122
But even so,
you didn't have to kill him.

529
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,750
And you didn't have to
bury my mother under Lotus Peak.

530
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,756
Let me go.

531
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,843
Yang Jian, well done!

532
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,848
Chenxiang, you killed your teacher.

533
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,142
We have orders to arrest you.

534
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,226
You!

535
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,686
Give yourself up.

536
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:32,220
Yang Jian, this time we saw you do it.

537
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:33,888
You let him go.

538
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,225
We have to take you in.

539
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,268
Don't trouble yourselves.

540
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:40,853
Once I'm done with this job,

541
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,439
I'll tie myself up and surrender.

542
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:09,674
Yang Jian, apologies in advance.

543
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,945
Release the fiery winds!

544
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:58,181
Heavenly strings, bind him!

545
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:10,735
So your fourth brother's here too.

546
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,196
That was pretty sneaky.

547
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,781
It's not really your style.

548
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:18,493
During the the last war of the gods,

549
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,495
you defeated the four of us

550
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:24,749
using pretty sneaky methods too, right?

551
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:26,375
I suppose.

552
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:31,422
Yang Jian, I told them

553
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,841
that you didn't do this.

554
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:34,926
But...

555
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,846
Just admit your guilt.

556
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,140
If you run into trouble,

557
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:43,726
I'll support you at the Celestial Court.

558
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,937
But what did I do?

559
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,271
What did you do?!

560
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:48,856
You conspired with Chenxiang

561
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,359
in affairs that brought murder
and harm to your school.

562
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:52,485
Me?

563
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:53,528
No, this is--

564
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,913
New guy, cut the racket.

565
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:05,122
What's your problem?

566
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,208
First time in jail?

567
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:09,961
Yang Jian?

568
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,423
Well if it isn't Yang Jian.

569
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,468
Who are you?

570
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:19,637
Me?

571
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,015
You, you, you...

572
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,684
The gourd, the Elixir of Life.

573
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:26,602
The tall guy, the tall guy next to me...

574
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:28,729
You two—Bang! Then, ow, ow, ow...

575
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:29,939
I was like doo-doo-doo...

576
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,524
You came from behind and swish!

577
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:32,900
Then you...

578
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:41,534
Twenty thousand.

579
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,378
You might be Yang Jian,

580
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,381
but you're a nobody to me.

581
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:58,968
Show some respect
or I'll beat it into you.

582
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:02,263
Take it easy, sir.

583
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:03,848
Watch out.

584
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,057
Cut the noise.

585
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,183
Stop yelling.

586
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,150
Yang Jian, even though
I caught you--

587
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,735
I mean, you caught me.

588
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,154
No big deal.
I don't hold a grudge.

589
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:19,864
I'm a generous guy.

590
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:26,454
If you--

591
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,707
If you ignore the guards like that,

592
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,751
they'll punish you bad next time.

593
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:34,921
You listening?

594
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,593
A fight!

595
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:23,928
It's on!

596
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:25,763
This will be fun.

597
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:27,348
Maybe it's a breakout?

598
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,226
Yang Jian, won't you even look?

599
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:36,399
Do you think they've come for you?

600
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:41,946
Behave, you two.

601
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:43,364
Don't give me any trouble.

602
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:44,448
You got me?

603
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,461
Coming?

604
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:00,715
Coming!

605
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:17,398
Back in your cells!

606
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:21,152
What medicine were you selling?

607
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,237
What? Is that important?

608
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,489
What's important is our next move.

609
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:30,578
Xiaotian, where is he?

610
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:32,788
Over there!

611
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:37,460
This is the next move.

612
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,231
Yang Jian!

613
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,025
Help me!

614
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:17,833
Erlang!

615
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:22,797
Yang Jian!

616
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,137
From generals on Plum Hill,

617
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,473
to wandering bounty hunters,

618
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,102
and then fugitives in Penglai.

619
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:48,239
Brothers, following me
has left you worse and worse off.

620
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:50,950
But we're happy and free.

621
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:51,992
Free.

622
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,828
Free!

623
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:04,880
Xiaotian.

624
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,700
Hot! Hot! Hot!

625
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,494
Erlang, where to now?

626
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,925
The lamp's lid is in the pagoda.

627
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:56,348
The light comes from the lamp's lid.

628
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:00,227
No idea who found it,

629
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,771
but they use it to guide the ships.

630
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,068
Must you drink so much?

631
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:12,698
The cosmos in a day.

632
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,534
A lifetime in moments.

633
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,078
Drink is my only concern.

634
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:21,415
What else can one know?

635
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,899
Mo Liqing...

636
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,236
Long time no see.

637
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,531
I've been waiting.

638
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:56,742
Well met.

639
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:00,079
This must be Chenxiang.

640
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,331
Murderer and fugitive.

641
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,501
Mo Liqing,

642
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,338
of course you know

643
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:13,342
the phoenixes will escape one day.

644
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:18,472
We Mo brothers dread the day,

645
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:20,266
for chaos will erupt.

646
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,601
But the phoenixes

647
00:59:22,685 --> 00:59:26,647
cannot be suppressed forever.

648
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,275
This Mount Hua

649
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:32,319
may look on the verge of collapse

650
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:37,324
but we risked life and limb for this.

651
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,326
If it can hold on another day,

652
00:59:39,702 --> 00:59:41,412
it should hold on another day.

653
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,666
Mo Liqing,

654
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,668
then this time

655
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,629
you're my enemy, not my friend.

656
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:38,987
So, we're doing this for real.

657
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:17,693
Duplication trick.

658
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:54,688
You can do split-body magic too.

659
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,746
So young

660
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,874
to have mastered Shen Gongbao's
demonic magic

661
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,168
and achieve your original god form.

662
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,671
If I can win, I'll do anything.

663
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,417
Run, kid!

664
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:13,725
Chenxiang!

665
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,330
Go!

666
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,888
Go!

667
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,718
My fellow disciple...

668
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,388
We meet again.

669
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:17,557
You're as elegant as ever.

670
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:51,943
Shen Gongbao.

671
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:56,406
Yang Jian.

672
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,493
It's been a long time.

673
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:02,329
I heard you fell on hard times.

674
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:05,290
Your Third Eye went blind.

675
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:12,964
Pity. That Yang Jian
who split Mount Tao...

676
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:16,843
I like that Yang Jian.

677
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,889
Shen Gongbao, where's Chenxiang?

678
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,103
He ran off by himself.

679
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:33,276
That's one heartless, ruthless kid.

680
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:36,154
Just like me at that age.

681
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:41,493
My true successor.

682
01:08:44,246 --> 01:08:45,705
Do you know where he went?

683
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:49,334
That little secret place of his.

684
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:54,714
Mount Li,

685
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,300
Cross-Moon Pool.

686
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:16,027
These wounds...

687
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:17,445
who did this?

688
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:22,742
Life is but a brief sojourn on this world,

689
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,496
what is the use of too much worry?

690
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:31,710
Today I am unhappy,

691
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,839
but time

692
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:39,217
rushes forward.

693
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,003
Is this reliable?

694
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:19,466
It's taken care of.

695
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:21,760
Relax, I've done it before.

696
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,178
It's very safe.

697
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:26,222
But it's a little machine.

698
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:28,141
He can only send him over.

699
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:46,743
Hurry up.

700
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,651
I wanna go too!

701
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,780
I forgot to say...

702
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,949
The trip can make you
a bit dizzy.

703
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,200
Huh?

704
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:29,661
Mortal realm, Chang'an!

705
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,089
This is Chang'an?

706
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,948
The Mortal Realm is at war.

707
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:04,297
CROSS-MOON POOL

708
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:34,828
You've come.

709
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,546
A new lamp,

710
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:46,256
lamp oil,

711
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:48,550
the old lamp lid...

712
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:50,802
The Lotus Lamp.

713
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:05,191
What's this?

714
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:08,778
Yang Jian,

715
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:10,864
since you're here,

716
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:12,115
don't hide.

717
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,741
Tell Chenxiang

718
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,410
the true use of the Lotus Lamp.

719
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:19,789
Why are you here?

720
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,633
Mount Hua's Lotus Peak

721
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,427
sits atop a nest of phoenixes.

722
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:35,096
As the spirits of the ten thousand flames,

723
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:36,931
they have world-destroying powers.

724
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:40,059
If they break out, the cosmos splinters.

725
01:14:40,852 --> 01:14:43,146
Goddess Nüwa gave your mother the lamp

726
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,940
so she could keep watch on the peak.

727
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,693
But 12 years ago,

728
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,069
the phoenixes grew restless.

729
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:52,530
The lamp couldn't seem to keep them down.

730
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:55,450
My master told me to help her.

731
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,119
But the power of the phoenix
was too strong.

732
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,414
The lamp broke.

733
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:08,296
At the last minute,

734
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:10,298
your mother leapt off

735
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,175
to try to hold them down herself.

736
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:15,428
Brother, look after my son!

737
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,555
Sister!

738
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:19,349
You must seal Lotus Peak.

739
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,993
Turning the axe, I drove it into the rock.

740
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:49,045
Finally the phoenixes were sealed in.

741
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,422
Your Third Eye

742
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,384
hasn't opened since.

743
01:16:04,018 --> 01:16:07,230
That's why my mother is under Lotus Peak.

744
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:09,315
Not because she married a mortal.

745
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:12,902
Chenxiang,

746
01:16:13,361 --> 01:16:15,446
my mother also married a mortal

747
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:17,573
and had me and your mom.

748
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,744
I was wounded and couldn't look after you.

749
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,496
So I took you to Jin Xia Cave.

750
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,415
But you never came to see me.

751
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:27,041
You're my uncle.

752
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:33,298
My master said
until you grew up, I couldn't.

753
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:39,262
Is he telling the truth, Granny Wanluo?

754
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,139
Granny Wanluo?

755
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:43,808
Yes,

756
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:45,727
it's true.

757
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:48,354
Yang Jian,

758
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,024
your mother, Yaoji, was my best friend.

759
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:53,860
I have another name...

760
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,278
Goddess of Mount Wu.

761
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,657
There's more to this matter as well.

762
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:02,702
Come with me.

763
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:18,551
Mount Hua.

764
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:20,720
That's Lotus Peak.

765
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:23,181
Those rays of light

766
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:24,932
are the agitation of the phoenixes

767
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:26,351
confined under the mountain.

768
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:29,854
My mother is trapped underneath.

769
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,614
This beacon tower on Mount Li...

770
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:42,909
King You would light it up for
the amusement of his concubine,

771
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,702
thus sending out false alarms.

772
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:46,079
As a result,

773
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:48,915
he perished with his kingdom.

774
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:54,170
It's always the woman to blame,
isn't it?

775
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:57,799
Yang Jian,

776
01:17:58,049 --> 01:18:01,511
do you know why we use the lamp
to control the phoenixes?

777
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,556
To save Jin Xia Cave.

778
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:11,229
Your Master used
the power of the phoenix

779
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,147
to keep the cave standing.

780
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:14,857
When they get free,

781
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,734
Jin Xia Cave will collapse.

782
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:20,863
The suppression of the phoenixes
keeps Jin Xia Cave standing.

783
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:24,617
That's really why your master
told you to suppress them.

784
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:26,911
My master only told me

785
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:30,164
that this would save lives
and prevent Cosmic Catastrophe.

786
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:31,874
He said nothing about the cave.

787
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,751
He thought only of himself.

788
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:38,047
Cycles rule heaven and earth.

789
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:39,757
The phoenixes will fly again.

790
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,009
Can you stop that?

791
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:52,979
Yang Jian,

792
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,648
do you remember when it was
you broke open Mount Tao?

793
01:18:56,816 --> 01:18:58,276
I split Mount Tao

794
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,320
during the last Cosmic Catastrophe.

795
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:04,824
Your master only cared about maintaining
his influence over Jin Xia Cave.

796
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,868
Your master tricked you.

797
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:09,787
We'll break open Mount Hua

798
01:19:09,871 --> 01:19:11,122
and rescue your sister.

799
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,646
Miss Wanluo,
I'm assuming that's all true

800
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:37,315
but in this serious situation,

801
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:39,859
I want to take you to see my master
and confront him.

802
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,197
Chenxiang, you'll come too.

803
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:46,616
Who wants to go with you?

804
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,367
You're just the same as
the other elders.

805
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:51,204
If you're not coming to Mount Hua,
I'll go myself.

806
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:52,747
Chenxiang!

807
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,793
With things as they are
you still want to talk to your master?

808
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:04,735
Goddess of Mount Wu,

809
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:09,240
I fear that if Chenxiang stays with you,
he'll share the same fate as Shen Gongbao.

810
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:15,037
Why do you say that?

811
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:17,832
In Yingzhou,

812
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,250
I was enchanted into a dream

813
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,669
where Mother told me
to split the mountain.

814
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:22,962
Jian,

815
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:24,297
split the mountain!

816
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,215
But it wasn't my mother.

817
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:27,758
It was you.

818
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,510
The Goddess of Mount Wu.

819
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:32,430
Confusing people through dreams

820
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:33,889
is what you do.

821
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:37,768
Chenxiang's master

822
01:21:37,977 --> 01:21:39,645
wasn't killed by Chenxiang.

823
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:41,564
Nor by Shen Gongbao.

824
01:21:42,857 --> 01:21:44,317
The wounds on his body

825
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,901
resembled a silken web.

826
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:48,571
When I found Shen Gongbao,

827
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:49,947
he was still alive.

828
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:53,242
A powerful magic weapon
dealt the first blow,

829
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:55,077
but what really killed him

830
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:57,246
was the wound from a silken web.

831
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:00,082
Just now,

832
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,209
you flung out your web in a fury.

833
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:04,837
That silken web

834
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,881
is your special magic weapon.

835
01:22:08,299 --> 01:22:09,300
Chenxiang's master

836
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:10,426
and Shen Gongbao

837
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:13,888
were murdered by you.

838
01:22:18,351 --> 01:22:19,352
You?

839
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:27,526
Yang Jian...

840
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:29,028
You're smart.

841
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,572
Why did you have to kill them?

842
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:35,451
If your master hadn't died,
you never would have left Jin Xia Cave.

843
01:22:36,494 --> 01:22:38,287
Shen Gongbao was a real shame.

844
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,956
We agreed to work together.

845
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,959
I never thought he'd get hurt so bad.
Death was preferable.

846
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,254
I just helped him along.

847
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:49,256
But why did you do all that?

848
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,634
Chenxiang, these things I did

849
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:53,135
were all to split the mountain

850
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,595
and release your mother.

851
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:56,722
Unlike Yang Jian.

852
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:01,060
But whatever the case,
you shouldn't have killed them.

853
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:14,448
Stop!

854
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,577
My...

855
01:24:42,328 --> 01:24:43,329
Give it back.

856
01:24:47,041 --> 01:24:48,083
It was burning hot.

857
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,251
I removed it for you.

858
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:52,963
It's always been on my wrist.

859
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:54,673
No one could get it off.

860
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:56,550
How did you do it?

861
01:24:57,635 --> 01:24:58,844
Maybe

862
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,347
it's because I'm your blood uncle.

863
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:07,144
Your mother wove it from her own hair.

864
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,231
Before she made the leap,

865
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:12,399
she told me to give it to you.

866
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,991
This rope of hair is a wick

867
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:23,619
for lighting the Lotus Lamp.

868
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,213
I really miss my mother.

869
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:44,139
Let's go to Mount Hua

870
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,645
and get to the bottom of all this.

871
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:13,919
Attacks come low and high

872
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:15,254
Nine-Turns Kungfu!

873
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:19,174
Untruths so hard to defy

874
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:21,927
People's thoughts dark as night

875
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:29,685
Yet in me the moon shines bright.

876
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:32,897
So even if on this path I die

877
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:35,858
I'll break through to clear sky

878
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:51,790
Such is joy!

879
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,589
Bring on your armies, I'm not afraid

880
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,885
Let them say

881
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,970
I'm just a gadfly

882
01:27:09,934 --> 01:27:12,603
Amidst the fear and hatred

883
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,357
I look back

884
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,401
You are there for me

885
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:08,283
Your home.

886
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:11,036
This is my home?

887
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:30,824
Mother.

888
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:49,718
Let's go.

889
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,234
These are all members
of the Order of the Gods.

890
01:30:48,193 --> 01:30:49,653
How'd I not notice before?

891
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:53,699
There really is a record of
the Order on Mount Hua.

892
01:31:19,266 --> 01:31:20,893
That's my mountain-splitting axe.

893
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:23,812
It's sealing the peak you split.

894
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:26,732
Not completely.

895
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:28,817
The power of the phoenix
spilling out...

896
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:30,569
You can see it.

897
01:31:57,346 --> 01:31:58,430
Yang Jian,

898
01:31:58,680 --> 01:31:59,973
run!

899
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:05,437
Celestial Ropes.

900
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,521
Chenxiang, run!

901
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,493
Uncle!

902
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:57,948
Finally, got you, you traitor!

903
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,119
This Taiji Scroll is such a treasure.

904
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:06,164
It makes manifest your desires,

905
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:10,794
and resolves your anxieties.

906
01:33:11,295 --> 01:33:16,216
Only the Taiji Scroll can trap Yang Jian.

907
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:43,660
Jian!

908
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:51,418
Jian!

909
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:56,381
Mother! Mother!

910
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:57,674
Jian!

911
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:02,054
Jian!

912
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:03,513
Split the mountain.

913
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:28,747
Jian!

914
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:30,707
Mother!

915
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:31,875
Mother!

916
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:38,215
- Jian...
- Mother!

917
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,510
Once the mountain is open,

918
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:43,678
I too must go.

919
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:45,138
Why?

920
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:48,058
It's fated.

921
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:50,685
The destiny of the women in our family

922
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:53,021
is to hold down the mountain

923
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:55,524
and secure peace in the world.

924
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:01,613
Mother.

925
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:04,032
Jian.

926
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:06,243
You needn't cry.

927
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:08,578
See?

928
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,665
These sparks...

929
01:35:12,249 --> 01:35:13,417
They're all me.

930
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:17,254
Life continues in an endless succession.

931
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,714
I live on in all things.

932
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,715
No!

933
01:35:20,799 --> 01:35:22,592
If you miss me,

934
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:25,178
look at the lamps burning in every window

935
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:27,764
and you'll see me there.

936
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:30,142
Mother!

937
01:35:31,435 --> 01:35:32,436
Mother!

938
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:35,897
I've already split Mount Tao!

939
01:35:35,981 --> 01:35:36,982
Mother!

940
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:38,442
Where's my mother?

941
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:43,697
Secure Mount Hua.

942
01:35:44,322 --> 01:35:45,532
Secure Mount Hua.

943
01:35:45,866 --> 01:35:47,826
Restore peace to the world.

944
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,536
Secure Mount Hua.

945
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:50,912
Restore peace to the world.

946
01:35:51,872 --> 01:35:54,916
- Brother, look after my son.
- Sister!

947
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:26,740
Your Third Eye is still closed?

948
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:33,538
Yes.

949
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:37,334
12 years ago,

950
01:36:37,918 --> 01:36:40,253
you sealed Lotus Peak.

951
01:36:41,755 --> 01:36:44,883
But the disasters rolled on.

952
01:36:45,509 --> 01:36:47,552
Maybe I was wrong.

953
01:36:48,053 --> 01:36:52,682
Catastrophe will return to the world.

954
01:36:54,059 --> 01:36:55,060
Master.

955
01:36:57,562 --> 01:37:01,066
To restore the righteous order,

956
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:09,449
shouldn't one try to heal the world?

957
01:37:44,985 --> 01:37:45,986
Master...

958
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:50,574
This is the Taiji Scroll.

959
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:52,867
It's you who trapped me inside it.

960
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:57,581
My excellent disciple.

961
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:02,627
I can't believe you can
slow down the Scroll's magic.

962
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:04,379
I remember...

963
01:38:04,671 --> 01:38:06,006
I remember the Taiji Scroll.

964
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:08,258
I remember Yin Hong's master

965
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:10,260
turning him to ashes inside the Scroll.

966
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:14,514
Master, what crime did I commit?

967
01:38:15,974 --> 01:38:17,183
Yang Jian,

968
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:21,271
I can't let Chenxiang split Mount Hua.

969
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:24,482
So this was all to protect Jin Xia Cave.

970
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:27,777
You know

971
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:31,698
Jin Xia Cave mustn't fall.

972
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:37,454
I do all I can to preserve Jin Xia Cave.

973
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:39,289
So...

974
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,666
My sister is trapped under Mount Hua--

975
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,293
Because it's her fate.

976
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:50,508
Jian,

977
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:52,427
you didn't know

978
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:54,471
that in your family

979
01:38:54,804 --> 01:39:00,310
mother and son
are linked by fate to the cyclical crises.

980
01:39:01,311 --> 01:39:03,480
To preserve the peace,

981
01:39:03,897 --> 01:39:06,149
the mothers hold down the mountains.

982
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:08,943
As for the sons,

983
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:10,820
to save their mothers,

984
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:13,031
they try to split the mountains.

985
01:39:14,324 --> 01:39:15,492
You aren't aware,

986
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:19,204
if you split the mountain,
the phoenixes fly, the cave collapses,

987
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:24,167
bringing catastrophe and chaos.

988
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:32,217
Only after that,

989
01:39:32,384 --> 01:39:35,303
can peace return to the world.

990
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:37,931
Jian...

991
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:40,767
Jian...

992
01:39:42,936 --> 01:39:46,439
Last time, you split the mountain.

993
01:39:47,774 --> 01:39:51,820
This time, it's Chenxiang's turn.

994
01:40:00,078 --> 01:40:01,287
Master,

995
01:40:02,706 --> 01:40:04,582
when I was an orphan,

996
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,919
you raised me, made me your disciple,

997
01:40:08,253 --> 01:40:10,588
and taught me all kinds of magic.

998
01:40:11,256 --> 01:40:13,091
You used me so that one day,

999
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:15,677
I'd be able to split Mount Tao.

1000
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:19,514
Meanwhile, you kept Chenxiang

1001
01:40:19,973 --> 01:40:23,143
ignorant of his powers,
origins, everything,

1002
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:26,271
so he'd be unable to split Mount Hua.

1003
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:27,814
That's right.

1004
01:40:28,398 --> 01:40:29,858
Jian,

1005
01:40:30,567 --> 01:40:32,277
like your mother,

1006
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,155
I only want to preserve the peace.

1007
01:40:35,739 --> 01:40:38,283
While the phoenixes remain
under the mountain,

1008
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:41,327
Jin Xia Cave will remain.

1009
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:44,914
Your cave is doomed.

1010
01:40:45,415 --> 01:40:47,751
Suppress phoenixes and their force grows.

1011
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:49,627
They will break out in the end.

1012
01:40:50,128 --> 01:40:51,671
Protecting Jin Xia Cave

1013
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:55,049
has nothing to do with catastrophe,
it's only to protect yourself.

1014
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:59,637
That cave is our life's work.

1015
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,515
Its glory belongs to all.

1016
01:41:03,558 --> 01:41:06,436
Harm to it is harm to all.

1017
01:41:08,313 --> 01:41:09,856
Say I'm wrong,

1018
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:12,859
then I'll be wrong to the end.

1019
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:21,618
Master...

1020
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:26,289
So I was only ever a pawn in your game.

1021
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:28,833
Jian,

1022
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:32,086
for the sake of Jin Xia Cave,

1023
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:35,507
I have to let you all

1024
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:38,676
be turned to ash by the Scroll.

1025
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:20,385
The Celestial Rope and Taiji Scroll

1026
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:24,430
are magic weapons of the older masters.

1027
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:27,350
We all want the same thing,

1028
01:42:27,976 --> 01:42:30,353
to prevent another outbreak of chaos.

1029
01:42:56,838 --> 01:42:57,839
Chenxiang!

1030
01:42:58,423 --> 01:43:00,008
Chenxiang,
protect yourself with the Lamp!

1031
01:43:12,437 --> 01:43:13,521
The Lotus Lamp!

1032
01:43:37,045 --> 01:43:38,922
Your Nine-Turns Kungfu
has improved.

1033
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:14,666
The power of the phoenix is so fierce.

1034
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,126
I can't believe it
can tear the Taiji Scroll.

1035
01:45:27,488 --> 01:45:29,073
Uncle!

1036
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:51,179
He used the power of the phoenix
to force open his Third Eye.

1037
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:09,864
Master,

1038
01:46:10,490 --> 01:46:12,742
you can't be so stubborn
about your mistakes.

1039
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:21,250
Heaven and Earth, I rise to thee!

1040
01:47:04,877 --> 01:47:06,712
This is bad. Hurry, stop him.

1041
01:48:51,943 --> 01:48:52,985
Master,

1042
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:55,238
what my mother wanted to protect

1043
01:48:55,905 --> 01:48:57,907
wasn't your Jin Xia Cave,

1044
01:48:58,241 --> 01:49:01,369
but life on earth.

1045
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:08,788
Uncle!

1046
01:51:18,839 --> 01:51:20,091
Lotus Peak can't hold.

1047
01:51:20,758 --> 01:51:22,843
If this continues,
everything will fall apart.

1048
01:51:24,053 --> 01:51:25,054
Chenxiang,

1049
01:51:25,971 --> 01:51:28,057
your mother and I wanted
to preserve peace,

1050
01:51:28,766 --> 01:51:29,850
not Jin Xia Cave.

1051
01:51:31,727 --> 01:51:33,270
Split open the mountain.

1052
01:53:01,942 --> 01:53:02,943
Mother!

1053
01:53:04,487 --> 01:53:05,488
Mother!

1054
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:10,367
Mother!

1055
01:53:17,291 --> 01:53:18,459
Son.

1056
01:53:29,094 --> 01:53:30,095
Mother.

1057
01:53:34,433 --> 01:53:35,434
Son,

1058
01:53:36,936 --> 01:53:38,145
you're all grown up.

1059
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,441
Mother!

1060
01:53:50,866 --> 01:53:51,867
Mother!

1061
01:54:14,265 --> 01:54:15,432
Why?

1062
01:54:22,273 --> 01:54:23,274
Son.

1063
01:54:56,473 --> 01:54:57,474
Brother.

1064
01:54:58,767 --> 01:55:00,811
I still need you to look after him.

1065
01:55:14,366 --> 01:55:15,868
Mother, where are you going?

1066
01:55:17,369 --> 01:55:19,246
The phoenixes and I

1067
01:55:19,872 --> 01:55:21,457
will look after the world,

1068
01:55:21,915 --> 01:55:23,083
and you.

1069
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:29,381
Mother...

1070
01:55:29,757 --> 01:55:30,758
Don't go!

1071
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:33,969
Mother!

1072
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:36,013
Mother!

1073
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:38,641
Mother!

1074
01:55:47,691 --> 01:55:48,776
Mother!

1075
01:55:54,698 --> 01:55:57,743
Mother!

1076
01:56:11,215 --> 01:56:12,466
Why?

1077
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:15,928
Why?

1078
01:56:23,686 --> 01:56:26,355
Your mother is already
one with the phoenixes.

1079
01:56:27,398 --> 01:56:28,565
The mountain has split.

1080
01:56:28,857 --> 01:56:30,067
The phoenixes have flown

1081
01:56:30,901 --> 01:56:32,361
and she has followed them.

1082
01:56:36,323 --> 01:56:37,574
So long as you're here

1083
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:40,619
and there's life on earth,

1084
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:42,871
she'll be back.

1085
01:57:02,474 --> 01:57:05,519
A LIGHT CHASER ANIMATION PRODUCTION

1086
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:15,738
As a boy I went to the woods

1087
01:57:16,071 --> 01:57:21,076
To hear the wind in the trees

1088
01:57:22,494 --> 01:57:28,250
Standing there, I'd sing to you

1089
01:57:28,459 --> 01:57:34,339
The wind was your smile

1090
01:57:34,548 --> 01:57:39,887
As a boy I sat by the stream

1091
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:45,726
To watch the wind ripple the grass

1092
01:57:46,477 --> 01:57:52,316
Running, I'd sing to you

1093
01:57:52,649 --> 01:57:58,405
Your breath in the wind

1094
01:58:01,158 --> 01:58:07,080
All my memories

1095
01:58:07,247 --> 01:58:13,086
Suddenly return to me

1096
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:18,842
The rustling wind

1097
01:58:19,259 --> 01:58:25,182
So warm and familiar

1098
01:58:25,349 --> 01:58:31,188
It's me embracing the wind

1099
01:58:31,271 --> 01:58:37,069
It's me embracing you

1100
01:58:37,236 --> 01:58:43,033
I still want to hear the wind's voice

1101
01:58:44,034 --> 01:58:46,495
Hualalala...

1102
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:59,091
So lovely and clear

1103
01:59:42,593 --> 01:59:47,639
Yesterday's memories feel like today

1104
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:53,395
The wind on my heartstrings plays

1105
01:59:53,979 --> 01:59:59,443
Hidden in the wind, I talk to you

1106
01:59:59,693 --> 02:00:05,240
The wind is me gazing your way

1107
02:00:05,532 --> 02:00:10,913
My sole wish, never forgotten

1108
02:00:10,996 --> 02:00:16,960
Is to wait for the rippling wind

1109
02:00:17,044 --> 02:00:22,591
To scatter my words to you

1110
02:00:22,925 --> 02:00:28,055
The wind is your answer

1111
02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:37,105
It's me embracing the wind

1112
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:42,861
It's me embracing you

1113
02:00:43,028 --> 02:00:48,659
The rustling wind

1114
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:54,164
So warm and familiar

1115
02:00:54,665 --> 02:00:59,795
Those sparks that fill the sky

1116
02:01:00,253 --> 02:01:05,676
Are your smiling face

1117
02:01:05,968 --> 02:01:11,598
I still want to hear your laugh

1118
02:01:11,682 --> 02:01:17,104
So lovely and clear

1119
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:23,151
The warm breeze enfolds me

1120
02:01:23,318 --> 02:01:28,740
In your embrace

1121
02:01:29,074 --> 02:01:34,705
I yearn to hear your song

1122
02:01:34,788 --> 02:01:38,000
Hualalala...

1123
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:50,345
The rustling wind so lovely

1124
02:02:05,152 --> 02:02:08,155
The Monkey King
came out of Waterbead Cave,

1125
02:02:08,405 --> 02:02:10,449
looked up... and who did he see?

1126
02:02:10,615 --> 02:02:13,076
A most handsome youth!

1127
02:02:13,243 --> 02:02:15,996
None other than
the Jade Emperor's nephew...

1128
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:21,334
Erlang, who split Mount Tao
and quelled the phoenixes!

1129
02:02:26,089 --> 02:02:27,090
Yang Jian!

1130
02:02:28,258 --> 02:02:29,718
Yang Jian... what about him?

1131
02:02:31,011 --> 02:02:34,097
Wow, that Erlang was really something!

1132
02:02:39,686 --> 02:02:41,146
You couldn't beat him?

1133
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:46,693
That's just a story.

1134
02:02:47,444 --> 02:02:49,905
Listen, what really happened

1135
02:02:49,988 --> 02:02:50,989
was this...

1136
02:03:00,624 --> 02:03:03,460
COMING SOON THE NEXT INSTALLMENT
OF THE NEW GODS SERIES

1137
02:03:06,338 --> 02:03:10,592
A LIGHT CHASER ANIMATION PRODUCTION

1138
02:03:14,471 --> 02:03:17,682
Upon exile, headed to Changsha.

1139
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:22,729
Looking west to Chang'an,
home is nowhere in sight.

1140
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:28,401
From within Yellow Crane Tower,
the sound of a flute.

1141
02:03:29,402 --> 02:03:34,074
In this river city, May time
is when plum blossoms fall.

1142
02:03:39,287 --> 02:03:43,041
30,000 MILES FROM CHANG'AN

1143
02:03:43,125 --> 02:03:45,335
SUMMER 2023
STAY TUNED

1144
02:04:02,185 --> 02:04:05,021
I fear this big world

1145
02:04:05,647 --> 02:04:08,984
Has no place for me

1146
02:04:09,568 --> 02:04:12,404
I fear that the lights

1147
02:04:12,904 --> 02:04:16,199
Will be blown out by the wind

1148
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:20,078
What can stop me from living easy

1149
02:04:20,162 --> 02:04:23,665
Let them gossip, let them talk

1150
02:04:24,166 --> 02:04:28,920
Fame and fortune are grains of sand

1151
02:04:29,296 --> 02:04:31,047
Why worry if they flee

1152
02:04:31,381 --> 02:04:33,341
I have my joys and sorrows

1153
02:04:33,425 --> 02:04:34,885
Others can think what they like

1154
02:04:34,968 --> 02:04:38,555
My heart is as big as the sky

1155
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:40,599
Life is full of surprises

1156
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:42,142
My hope, for peace

1157
02:04:42,225 --> 02:04:46,396
The lamps burn brightly

1158
02:04:47,731 --> 02:04:50,692
Protect the simple things in life

1159
02:04:50,734 --> 02:04:54,946
Courage when darkness closes in

1160
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:57,699
Disperse the cold

1161
02:04:57,782 --> 02:05:01,995
Light up the night

1162
02:05:02,245 --> 02:05:05,165
Protect every romantic notion

1163
02:05:05,248 --> 02:05:09,461
Every face, every connection

1164
02:05:09,544 --> 02:05:12,547
Let troubles come

1165
02:05:12,631 --> 02:05:18,428
I'll bravely let fly my dreams

1166
02:05:32,776 --> 02:05:36,529
Seasons pass in an instant

1167
02:05:36,696 --> 02:05:39,950
Chasing sunsets, the world my home

1168
02:05:40,533 --> 02:05:45,747
In the Three Realms, my legend lies

1169
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:47,958
Full of righteousness

1170
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,793
I have my joys and sorrows

1171
02:05:49,876 --> 02:05:51,378
Others can think what they like

1172
02:05:51,461 --> 02:05:55,257
My heart is as big as the sky

1173
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:56,967
The world is full of surprises

1174
02:05:57,050 --> 02:05:58,677
My hope, for peace

1175
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:03,139
The lamps burn brightly

1176
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:07,102
Protect the simple things in life

1177
02:06:07,185 --> 02:06:11,398
Courage when darkness closes in

1178
02:06:11,481 --> 02:06:14,442
Disperse the cold

1179
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:18,697
Light up the night

1180
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:21,533
Protect every romantic notion

1181
02:06:21,616 --> 02:06:25,829
Every face, every connection

1182
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:28,999
Let troubles come

1183
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:35,338
I'll bravely let fly my dreams

1184
02:06:49,686 --> 02:06:52,605
Protect the simple things in life

1185
02:06:52,689 --> 02:06:56,860
Courage when darkness closes in

1186
02:06:56,901 --> 02:06:59,863
Disperse the cold

1187
02:06:59,946 --> 02:07:03,950
Light up the night

1188
02:07:04,034 --> 02:07:07,203
Protect every romantic notion

1189
02:07:07,287 --> 02:07:11,416
Every face, every connection

1190
02:07:11,499 --> 02:07:14,461
