00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:07,695
<i>THE FILM YOU ARE ABOUT
TO SEE WON TWO AWARDS</i>

2
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:11,756
<i>AT THE 1956 VENICE FILM FESTIVAL:</i>

3
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:17,773
<i>THE FIPRESCI PRIZE</i>

4
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:23,779
<i>AND
THE BEST ACTRESS AWARD</i>

5
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,269
<i>Morning came</i>

6
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,600
<i>and he still hadn't returned.</i>

7
00:02:58,698 --> 00:03:00,935
<i>He'd been out all night.</i>

8
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:03,139
<i>It was the first time.</i>

9
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:06,591
<i>I was so proud to have
the handsomest guy around,</i>

10
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:10,016
<i>me, the gimp.</i>

11
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:11,529
Already up, Gervaise?

12
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:14,407
Coming to the washhouse?

13
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:16,416
I 'll save you a spot.

14
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:18,529
Is Lantier still asleep?

15
00:03:18,635 --> 00:03:20,708
Yes, he's a bit tired.

16
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:32,544
She's still there.

17
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,435
She's not afraid to catch cold.

18
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,898
She's patient.

19
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:45,922
It's yours if you promise
to go home with it.

20
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:47,850
- Dare me?
- Dare you.

21
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:57,985
I don't give a damn.

22
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,130
- Bye, Virginie.
- Have a nice trip!

23
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:17,475
- I salute you, Mr. Boche.
- I return the salute.

24
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,620
Like you turn out a coat.

25
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,634
Like you turn the ladies' heads.

26
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,944
Go ahead, she's gone.

27
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,411
Don't you think
that's going too far?

28
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:30,152
- Why? I like flowers.
- Go on, you rascal.

29
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,487
There you are!

30
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:47,306
- Where'd you spend the night?
- What night?

31
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:50,187
You were with that whore next door!

32
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:52,357
Take that back.

33
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:54,665
You're picky!
Who were you with?

34
00:04:56,301 --> 00:05:00,578
- Why don't you shut up?
- You dare come in with a flower!

35
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:03,052
Girls who sleep
with the whole neighborhood!

36
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:05,036
Nice girls!

37
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,060
Mommy!

38
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:09,157
Shut them up or I'm leaving!

39
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:12,163
If it weren't for them...
Poor babies!

40
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:15,979
And your reputation!
- Fine.

41
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:17,637
Listen, I'll tell you -

42
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:19,813
I'll kill her!

43
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:22,022
With my bare hands if I have to!

44
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,784
And me too?

45
00:05:23,885 --> 00:05:26,536
Oh, no. Not you.

46
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,044
Thanks.

47
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,985
See? You're all worked up.

48
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:33,157
Why? You didn't sleep?

49
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:35,465
What did I do to you?

50
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:40,865
Keep scrubbing!

51
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,033
- It's filthy!
- I do my best.

52
00:05:47,086 --> 00:05:49,704
- Got money for lunch?
- How could l?

53
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,529
By stealing?

54
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:55,526
- Take this to the pawnshop.
- Again?

55
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,645
Yes.

56
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:58,604
I can't, I'm going to the washhouse.

57
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:00,295
Why not say so?
I'll hock it, then.

58
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:01,899
So...

59
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,318
you'll bring back lunch?

60
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,234
Not at the cheese shop,
we owe them for last week.

61
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,820
Buy bread and some chops.

62
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:12,935
Breaded chops?

63
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:14,183
Yes.

64
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:16,266
And a bottle of wine.

65
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:20,137
- Red?
- Of course.

66
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:25,901
See?

67
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:32,685
It was all right, once again.

68
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:37,635
All he had to do was smile at me

69
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:39,979
and I'd end up saying, "Fine".

70
00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:51,565
They'll be clean, mutton chop.

71
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,473
Hey, Gervaise!

72
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:05,420
I saved you a spot!

73
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,591
That's kind of you!

74
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,854
You should've soaked those.

75
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,085
I swear, those kids
with their sooty backsides!

76
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,224
Get some soapy water.

77
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,367
Don't worry,
just hot water will do fine.

78
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:31,214
You know your stuff! You were
a laundress back home, weren't you?

79
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:32,872
Yes, from the age of 10.

80
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:34,863
Been in Paris long?

81
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,643
- Two months.
- Been married long?

82
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,680
We're not married.

83
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:43,304
No shame in that!

84
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:44,968
It's for the best.

85
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:47,439
He's not nice enough
to want to be his wife.

86
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:49,391
What's his profession?

87
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:53,711
- I'll get a bucket of hot water.
- Me too.

88
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:00,107
Hello!

89
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,866
Hello, Gervaise.

90
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:04,107
It's his first birthday.

91
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:06,636
He's teething.

92
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:15,113
What's his profession?

93
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,934
Hatter.

94
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,407
Or it was.

95
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:23,301
Since we've been in Paris,
he doesn't do much of anything.

96
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,264
So he's not nice?

97
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:29,453
Oh, not nice...

98
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,296
It's been eight years.

99
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:34,953
You can't ask much from a man.

100
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,682
Skirt-chaser?

101
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:41,161
- Why do you say that?
- No reason.

102
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:42,988
Come on, why'd you say that?

103
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,496
I thought you had.

104
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:46,797
I was just repeating it.

105
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:49,101
What about those
two girls at your house?

106
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:51,023
Adèle and Virginie?

107
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:53,488
Gervaise, what are you imagining?

108
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:56,463
No need to imagine.
I know!

109
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:59,082
- What do you know?
- It's either Adèle or Virginie!

110
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:03,146
Nonsense! He might pinch them
on the stairs, but...

111
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:06,249
On the stairs?
What's he doing on the stairs?

112
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:10,477
Nothing!
I just said "on the stairs,"

113
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:12,617
Iike I'd say "on the street."

114
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:15,111
I said "on the stairs"
because it's my job to wash them.

115
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:19,089
- Looking for someone?
- My mommy.

116
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:21,968
- Who is she?
- My name's Etienne Lantier.

117
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,921
- Charles!
- What?

118
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:25,741
Two kids looking for their mother.

119
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:27,664
I'll announce it.

120
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:31,084
"Two kids are
looking for their mother!"

121
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:01,553
- Why'd you bring me the key?
- Daddy left.

122
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,170
Yes, to buy lunch.

123
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,958
- He told you to get me?
- Daddy left.

124
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:11,019
He put all his things in a trunk
and put it in the carriage

125
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:12,530
and then he left.

126
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:15,310
Was there a lady in the carriage?

127
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:18,160
He packed all his things
and he left.

128
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,088
Tell me who it was,
now that he's gone.

129
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:28,432
Sure, now I will.
With her sister.

130
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:31,474
Looks like she's here
just to see your face.

131
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,923
What's your problem, ragamuffin?

132
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:47,502
And a gimp, too!

133
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:49,932
You don't scare me.

134
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:51,661
I don't want to scare you.

135
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:55,986
I want to hurt you!
- Tell me, what have I done to you?

136
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,472
You know quite well!
My husband was seen -

137
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,402
"My husband!"

138
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
What husband?
She's not married!

139
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,475
Attention! Lost husband!
Without a collar, no reward!

140
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:16,844
Leave me alone.

141
00:11:16,948 --> 00:11:18,192
I've got work to do!

142
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,181
It's your sister! I know it!

143
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,488
Yes, it is.
Now you know! Happy?

144
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:28,881
I didn't say a word
to that bitch.

145
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,540
The nerve...

146
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,007
Take that!

147
00:11:33,108 --> 00:11:35,148
Another dress ruined!

148
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,189
Take that!

149
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,541
And that!

150
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,964
Not hot water!

151
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:15,187
Charles!
Pull them apart!

152
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,522
No way, last time
I almost lost an eye!

153
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:33,876
We should stop them!

154
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:02,484
Mommy!

155
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:25,199
- No, l...
- Mommy!

156
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:43,666
Now you'll see!

157
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:45,708
This is for you!

158
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:50,223
This is for your sister!
For your sister's sister!

159
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:53,676
For Lantier!
For you!

160
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:57,012
For your sister!

161
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:59,893
Take that and that!

162
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:14,197
Come on, Virginie.

163
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:18,573
You haven't seen
the last of me, bitch!

164
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:32,051
That'll be two cents.

165
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:43,479
If that's the way it is,
I'll fight back.

166
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,744
Alone

167
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:47,921
with my two children.

168
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:53,517
First of all, you say
I don 't have a husband?

169
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:57,814
Yes, I do.
I got married.

170
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:03,313
Yes, I got married.

171
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,375
Mr. Coupeau married me.

172
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:11,827
Even though, naturally,
I couldn 't be married in white like her.

173
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:18,641
I borrowed a dress
from Coupeau 's sister.

174
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:20,632
What misers they are!

175
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:25,362
They work with gold,
making little chains.

176
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,832
Working with gold
makes you nasty, it seems.

177
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,838
- Hey, Lorilleux.
- What?

178
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,465
Doesn't she look like Thérèse?

179
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:35,187
You know, our neighbor
who died of pneumonia?

180
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,296
There's a resemblance.

181
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,216
And you have two children?

182
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:43,859
I told my brother, why marry
a woman with two children?

183
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:47,890
Don't be offended, I'm just
looking out for his best interests!

184
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,544
What's more,
you don't look very healthy.

185
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:53,681
- Doesn't look healthy, does she?
- Not really.

186
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:57,047
That's enough! The wedding is tomorrow.
You don't have to come.

187
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:59,000
Of course we're coming!
You're so touchy!

188
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:00,658
Want the money
for our two dinners?

189
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,249
Don't bother. Everyone will pay
their share afterwards. Good night.

190
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:06,998
- Wait!
- Here comes the ceremony...

191
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:13,106
We're careful because bits of gold might
stick to the soles and get carried off.

192
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,701
Don't get mad! She'll show
her soles like everyone else!

193
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,887
Of course he wasn't as classy as...

194
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:31,768
But he was so nice!

195
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,866
And roofing is a fine profession.

196
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,031
You're so handsome!

197
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,654
What about me?

198
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,236
It looks great on you!

199
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,998
But that's not all...

200
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:49,651
That slob Mes Bottes stole
one of my patent-leather shoes!

201
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,328
So we can't get married?

202
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,178
I'll hop down the aisle!

203
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:13,684
Perfect. Thank you, madam.

204
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:16,730
Your turn, sir.

205
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:22,873
Second thoughts?

206
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:25,494
It's not that...

207
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:32,120
- That counts, right?
- Naturally!

208
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:36,891
BLlND

209
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:39,890
Spare some change,
ladies and gents?

210
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:07,095
- Blasted holy water!
- You're too late.

211
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,716
That's quick work!

212
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,024
It's like at the dentist's:
over before you can say "ouch!"

213
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,098
Completely painless.

214
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:16,408
The pain comes later.

215
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:21,368
DEAF AND DUMB

216
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,994
- What are you doing here?
- We came to get you.

217
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,776
I said I'd come to dinner.
I don't have time now.

218
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:38,521
- No protests!
- We need you to have fun!

219
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,460
Have fun without me.

220
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:44,951
Gervaise, ask him. He won't come.

221
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:48,312
Careful with my dress!

222
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:54,394
Ask him to come.

223
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,226
Please come,
it'd make us so happy!

224
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:03,509
In that case, I'll come.

225
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:06,556
Come on.

226
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,273
See those two kids?
My brother has a lot on his hands.

227
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:15,991
- Stop it.
- But it's true.

228
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:18,810
I've got hands too, I work.

229
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:20,949
She's my best worker.

230
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:23,126
She'll have her own shop
within 10 years.

231
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,077
- If only it'd let up.
- It will never let up.

232
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:28,694
We could take the avenue
up past the cemetery.

233
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:31,765
You fetch me from the forge
to take me to a cemetery!

234
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:33,364
That's a good one!

235
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:35,127
I've got an idea.

236
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,855
How about going to the museum?

237
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:39,291
- What for?
- To have a look.

238
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:41,331
Ever been to the Louvre?

239
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:43,642
You should see it at least once.

240
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,557
Fine.

241
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,958
Etienne, Claude!

242
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,370
What?

243
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,634
- We're leaving.
- Sure, we're not going to rot here!

244
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:59,484
It'll do everyone good.

245
00:20:34,622 --> 00:20:37,078
This one's really worth a look!

246
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:40,150
It's all on the table, what a spread!

247
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:43,386
I hope it'll whet your appetites for later.

248
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:45,943
Look at that one puke!

249
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:51,383
And that guy's watering the dandelions!

250
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:55,448
Hey!

251
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,755
Over here! Some real marvels!

252
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,031
Now that's something!

253
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,759
Look at the bride!

254
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,994
She's blushing!

255
00:21:16,095 --> 00:21:19,095
My word, getting married
made her a virgin!

256
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,396
This isn't for kids! Come on,
there's some battles over here.

257
00:21:25,024 --> 00:21:27,544
Look over here, it's even better!

258
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:34,398
With a swan!
Can you believe it?

259
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:37,660
It was in ancient times, but still...

260
00:21:43,456 --> 00:21:45,049
Like it?

261
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:48,381
Yes, I prefer that.
It's about something.

262
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,174
I'm glad I wasn't there.

263
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,840
I wish I had been.

264
00:21:57,408 --> 00:22:00,092
- Who is that lady?
- Liberty.

265
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:04,535
No, he wasn't like everyone else.

266
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:11,896
I wondered, "Why did he insist
that he come to the wedding?"

267
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,598
He 's not cheerful,
he doesn 't make people laugh,

268
00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:19,574
his mind seems elsewhere.

269
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:23,038
Then I thought,

270
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:25,503
"lt must be because
Coupeau respects him."

271
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,862
Watch out!

272
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,301
My poor feet!

273
00:23:26,402 --> 00:23:28,573
Paris is so big!

274
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:31,324
Please, you needn't bother.

275
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,825
Must you be so formal?

276
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:38,553
Don't bother, dear.

277
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,916
Thanks.

278
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:51,261
Walking in the streets wasn't bad,

279
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:54,264
but the museum...

280
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:03,419
That's enough.

281
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:08,667
- That's enough, dear.
- Fine.

282
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:27,041
Know how much we have
to set up housekeeping?

283
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:29,154
Seven cents.

284
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,135
Seven cents, seven cents

285
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:37,624
To set up a home for two

286
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:42,462
Seven cents, seven cents,

287
00:24:43,236 --> 00:24:44,643
Wife...

288
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:47,931
What shall we do

289
00:24:58,052 --> 00:25:00,223
Time passed.

290
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:01,982
The children grew.

291
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,418
And then, I had Nana.

292
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,744
We worked hard,

293
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,660
he on the roofs,

294
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:39,870
I at the laundry,

295
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:44,508
because I was determined
to rent a shop

296
00:25:45,189 --> 00:25:49,313
and be my own boss.

297
00:25:58,245 --> 00:26:01,725
It's nice to bring me flowers.
Thanks.

298
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:12,581
The shop is still for rent,
you know.

299
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,048
But it's too expensive.

300
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:21,182
It's not that.
Do you want to be the boss?

301
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:22,267
Why not?

302
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:25,538
You'll be good at it, I know you.

303
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:27,198
Then what?

304
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:29,668
No one likes the boss.

305
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:32,132
I don't like
people not liking you.

306
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,466
You're so silly!

307
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:42,176
SHOP FOR RENT

308
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:44,001
You don't understand.

309
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,418
- But I have the money!
- He has to sign. That's the law.

310
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,628
I'll go get him.

311
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:52,898
- I'll be right back.
- We'll save it for you.

312
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:08,484
There's Gervaise!

313
00:27:08,582 --> 00:27:10,851
Put the iron on the fire.

314
00:27:13,126 --> 00:27:16,388
Well? Did you rent the shop?

315
00:27:17,062 --> 00:27:18,688
No! You have to come!

316
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,416
Why?

317
00:27:21,414 --> 00:27:22,342
To sign!

318
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,999
I don't know how.

319
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:28,325
- Make a cross. It's the law.
- Well, if it's the law...

320
00:27:28,422 --> 00:27:30,626
I'll be down in five minutes.

321
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:35,555
Look at me, I have to sign!

322
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:39,776
Cover the irons, lazybones!

323
00:27:41,735 --> 00:27:43,142
Damn it!

324
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:45,983
Zidore!

325
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:19,621
Not the hospital!
Bring him home!

326
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:21,542
You're all the same!

327
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:23,581
We build hospitals
and you won't use them.

328
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:25,728
The hospital is free.

329
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,620
I have money!

330
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,567
I'd go if I could,
but they don't want me.

331
00:28:30,664 --> 00:28:34,079
Be sensible.
Save your money for when he's out.

332
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,041
It might be a long time
before he's on a roof again.

333
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:40,770
I have all that's needed!

334
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:42,279
Step aside.

335
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:44,743
Rue Polonceau!

336
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,887
The hospital is free.

337
00:28:46,984 --> 00:28:49,351
I want to care for him.
He's my husband.

338
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:51,172
So, no shop?

339
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,312
No shop.
You can't have everything.

340
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,732
I'll work it out with the landlord.

341
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:12,803
Six months later, he was healed.

342
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:16,549
But after paying the doctor's fees,

343
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:18,471
we had nothing left.

344
00:29:23,145 --> 00:29:26,309
Know what time it is?
Bedtime.

345
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:28,612
We're up to our ears in work.

346
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:30,655
I have to go back
right after dinner.

347
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:32,321
Again?

348
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:37,769
- How was work?
- I worked the bellows.

349
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:39,589
He's doing well.

350
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,577
In a bad mood?

351
00:29:41,673 --> 00:29:43,877
I don't have the time.

352
00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:46,530
You should've put me in the hospital.
I'd be healed,

353
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,119
and you'd have your shop.

354
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:50,632
Oh, be quiet.

355
00:29:56,265 --> 00:29:57,988
You need 500 francs to rent it?

356
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,129
Yes, 500.

357
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:01,313
Why?

358
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,622
I'll lend them to you.

359
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:08,864
My mother left me 500 francs.
I'm not doing anything with them.

360
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:16,641
I won't take your money.

361
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,428
Why not?

362
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:21,826
There's no reason to.

363
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,337
Yes, there is.

364
00:30:23,434 --> 00:30:25,638
Having a shop would make you happy

365
00:30:26,378 --> 00:30:29,062
and making you happy
makes me happy.

366
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:31,845
No better reason than that.

367
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:48,778
SHOP FOR RENT

368
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:56,104
What are you doing in there?

369
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:59,200
Nothing.

370
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:02,471
- And you?
- Me? Nothing.

371
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,131
I came to have a look.

372
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:05,663
To look at the shop?

373
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:08,522
Sure.

374
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:11,075
Me too!

375
00:31:16,939 --> 00:31:17,867
Well?

376
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:24,326
No, all that money to pay back,
I wouldn't sleep a wink.

377
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,655
I got my shop.

378
00:31:28,811 --> 00:31:31,528
And two weeks ago, what did I see?

379
00:31:31,627 --> 00:31:33,034
Virginie.

380
00:31:33,707 --> 00:31:36,555
I'd forgotten all about her.

381
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:45,475
- Are they fresh?
- Check the eyes. Fresh from Dieppe.

382
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:47,489
That's what they say.

383
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:21,355
My word!
It's Gervaise!

384
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:23,275
Yes, it is.

385
00:32:23,372 --> 00:32:24,933
An old friend.

386
00:32:25,036 --> 00:32:27,557
How funny!

387
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,221
Hilarious...

388
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,212
My husband, Mr. Fish.

389
00:32:31,308 --> 00:32:33,032
Married? Congratulations.

390
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:36,613
A policeman, as you see. I was so glad
when he was offered a job here,

391
00:32:36,717 --> 00:32:39,083
all the memories and friends
I'd left behind!

392
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,668
And you, dear?
Working around here?

393
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:44,228
- I'm a laundress.
- It's not too heavy?

394
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:46,885
Heavier it is, happier I am.
I'm my own boss.

395
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:48,199
Really?

396
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:49,861
Yes.

397
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:52,867
That's great.
She's her own boss.

398
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,696
Married, too!

399
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:56,837
My dear, you've come a long way!

400
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,981
Drafty here, isn't it?

401
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:02,085
- Yes, it certainly is.
- It's from downstairs.

402
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,775
- Won't you come in?
- You live there?

403
00:33:04,877 --> 00:33:07,081
What's funny about that?

404
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:09,003
I lived there for three years.

405
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:11,468
How funny...

406
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:13,125
Hilarious.

407
00:33:13,229 --> 00:33:15,433
Please, come in.

408
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:18,533
- I have laundry to deliver.
- My neighbor's out shopping.

409
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,500
You know how it is
when you first move in...

410
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:33,414
It's changed.

411
00:33:35,118 --> 00:33:36,906
The bed used to be this way.

412
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:39,046
I had my daughter there.

413
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:42,466
- You have a daughter, too?
- Yes, Nana.

414
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:46,984
A year after I married Coupeau.

415
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:51,175
You might remember him,

416
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:54,982
he's the roofer
who lived in my building.

417
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:58,253
Sorry to interrupt,
but I'm back on duty at 2:00

418
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,172
and you won't have time
to cook my mackerel.

419
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,993
Sorry, it's my fault.

420
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:04,966
Clean it, it'll keep you busy.

421
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,845
He likes it. He enjoys popping
the bladder with this foot!

422
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:12,423
Well, see you soon, Mrs. Fish.

423
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:14,250
See you soon, Mrs. Coupeau.

424
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:17,612
I'm glad to see you.
It's been so long.

425
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:20,909
Shall we talk about it or not?

426
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,534
It's up to you.

427
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:27,242
Then we'll never mention
the washhouse again.

428
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:28,139
Okay.

429
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,311
You had a good reason.

430
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:33,895
You did! She might be my sister,
but she's a nasty bitch.

431
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:36,999
- Let's not discuss that.
- And you know Lantier.

432
00:34:37,102 --> 00:34:38,663
Listen.

433
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:41,863
This might make you happy.

434
00:34:43,055 --> 00:34:44,779
They're not together anymore.

435
00:34:45,455 --> 00:34:47,342
- They're not?
- No.

436
00:34:48,015 --> 00:34:50,502
What if he came back to you?

437
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:52,167
Lantier?

438
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:55,238
- Why do you say that?
- No reason.

439
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,165
Men are so funny.

440
00:34:57,999 --> 00:34:59,942
He'd be wasting his time.

441
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:02,152
All that's over.

442
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:05,133
Dead and buried.

443
00:35:05,232 --> 00:35:06,639
See you soon, Mrs. Coupeau.

444
00:35:09,584 --> 00:35:11,144
Ready?

445
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,142
That was a nice one!

446
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,996
- Hello, Gervaise.
- Hello.

447
00:35:34,992 --> 00:35:36,880
Etienne!

448
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:40,327
Hello.

449
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:42,254
- Bye, mother.
- Bye.

450
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,225
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

451
00:36:04,272 --> 00:36:05,833
Hello!

452
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:09,163
Hello.

453
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:12,077
I'd never have recognized Coupeau.

454
00:36:12,177 --> 00:36:13,453
Who?

455
00:36:13,552 --> 00:36:16,869
That's not him.
That's Goujet, the blacksmith.

456
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:22,601
He's our best friend.

457
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:24,623
He took my son as an apprentice.

458
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:27,184
Blacksmith?

459
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:30,151
Why not a roofer like his -
like Coupeau?

460
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:32,145
A roofer?

461
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:34,762
Coupeau refused
after he hurt his leg.

462
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:36,589
- Accident?
- Yes.

463
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,250
Let me help you.

464
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:39,914
No, thanks.

465
00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:42,793
He fell off a roof, poor dear.

466
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,785
He's better now.

467
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,105
You've got a fine shop!

468
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:53,357
Not bad, is it?

469
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:55,440
How about a coffee?

470
00:36:55,538 --> 00:36:58,702
I don't want to bother you.

471
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:01,169
It's no bother. It's ready.

472
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:04,080
What's the blacksmith's name?
Goujet?

473
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,370
Yes, Goujet.

474
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:11,980
Between a blacksmith and a roofer,
you chose the roofer!

475
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:14,537
I didn't choose.

476
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:18,384
I only met Goujet
the day I married Coupeau.

477
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:22,473
- Too late.
- I didn't say that.

478
00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:27,116
For me, Coupeau is the best.

479
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:28,146
Here.

480
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:30,897
It looks good.

481
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:33,842
I didn't really want
to get married,

482
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:35,761
as I had two children already.

483
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:38,063
This is Nana. Say hello.

484
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,146
Hello.

485
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:44,462
- All the more reason!
- No. It's like I told him,

486
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,123
it's no gift to give a man.

487
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:49,226
Why did I tell her all that?

488
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,896
I even told her that Goujet
lent us the money for the shop.

489
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:57,163
I told her,
"l didn 't really want to,

490
00:37:57,267 --> 00:37:59,820
but Coupeau accepted. "

491
00:38:01,938 --> 00:38:04,142
Coupeau did the right thing!

492
00:38:04,818 --> 00:38:06,728
Yes, he did.

493
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:11,537
At first, I was afraid,
but each month we've repaid him.

494
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:16,620
Already 200 francs -

495
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:20,520
No, 200 francs as of tomorrow.

496
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:22,831
- Hello, Gervaise.
- Hello.

497
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,986
- I'll be off.
- Stay a while.

498
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,807
I can't, and you're busy.

499
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,755
Besides, with a husband like mine...

500
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:35,631
He can't survive
without milk in his coffee!

501
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,139
- See you soon.
- Good-bye.

502
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:40,747
- Sorry!
- Don't worry about it.

503
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,842
Hey!

504
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,909
- Mrs. Boche!
- In person!

505
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:50,605
What are you doing here?

506
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:52,268
I take care of the building.

507
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,062
Didn't Gervaise tell you?

508
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:55,986
How about that?

509
00:38:56,084 --> 00:39:00,143
We helped her get that pretty shop.
- It seems to be doing well.

510
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:01,650
Depends on the day.

511
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:02,992
Why?

512
00:39:03,956 --> 00:39:06,345
Got time for a coffee?

513
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:08,973
Come on.
- Of course.

514
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:23,953
One...

515
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:26,607
two...

516
00:39:27,636 --> 00:39:29,043
three...

517
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:31,883
four.

518
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:36,176
Mine's rounder.

519
00:39:36,276 --> 00:39:37,837
Mine looks like a heart!

520
00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:45,234
There!
Now we'll be cooler.

521
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:50,000
I must have caught cold last night.

522
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:52,949
When you sleep with men,
they're always uncovering you!

523
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:54,932
Don't talk that way
in front of the child!

524
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:57,134
Put that on!

525
00:39:58,037 --> 00:40:01,037
Naughty, naughty!
Need help?

526
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:06,004
Here's Coupeau!

527
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:08,240
What an entrance!

528
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:14,580
Don't touch anything!
We're busy.

529
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:18,253
I haven't been drinking,
it's the sun.

530
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:19,917
Sure, it's the sun!

531
00:40:20,022 --> 00:40:23,819
Yes, the sun.
Finally, a woman who understands me.

532
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:26,925
- You mixed them up!
- Oh, you.

533
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,972
"Handkerchiefs."

534
00:40:32,086 --> 00:40:34,290
My wife writes so well!

535
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,756
Especially the numbers!

536
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:40,017
They're so pretty,
like little critters.

537
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:45,523
I must kiss you.
You're too good of a wife!

538
00:40:45,622 --> 00:40:47,662
Leave me alone! We're working.

539
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:50,449
So what if I want to kiss you
in front of everyone?

540
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,070
Let him, he's allowed!

541
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:55,378
Give him a kiss already!

542
00:40:56,694 --> 00:40:58,418
Those are mine, too!

543
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:05,358
Be good now.

544
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:08,821
I'll be good.

545
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:24,277
"The farmer takes a wife.

546
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,317
Heigh-ho, the derry-o."

547
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:30,383
Just wine, never moonshine!

548
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:36,238
Any moonshine in there?

549
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:38,165
Oh, yes!

550
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:46,101
Nice boobies.

551
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:48,663
What? I'm not touching.
Just looking.

552
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:50,963
Tell him to be good.

553
00:41:51,063 --> 00:41:54,063
Leave her alone.
You're being a pain.

554
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:57,331
Look how she handles men's shirts!

555
00:41:58,103 --> 00:42:00,307
She knows what she's doing.

556
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:01,968
She knows them well.

557
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:06,931
She's handled a lot of shirts
without men in them!

558
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,763
And men without shirts!

559
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:18,479
Now that's a collar!

560
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,032
Madam, if he keeps this up,
I'm leaving!

561
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,982
- That's enough, go to bed.
- Easy...

562
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:31,478
Nice and easy.

563
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:34,935
Oh, no. Come on.

564
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,238
- I brought you our washing.
- It's a pleasure.

565
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:45,904
It's only normal.

566
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:48,945
It's nice of you.

567
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:51,252
Don't you recognize Virginie?

568
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:52,913
I told you I saw her.

569
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:57,108
Now I get it.
I heard you're Mrs. Fish now?

570
00:42:57,209 --> 00:42:58,769
A policeman?

571
00:42:58,873 --> 00:43:00,596
Coupeau is very well, I see.

572
00:43:00,697 --> 00:43:03,861
This is one of my good days.

573
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:08,627
Did you invite Mrs. Fish
to your name-day party?

574
00:43:09,465 --> 00:43:11,669
I haven't had time, silly!

575
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:15,085
Then I will.
Please come to dinner.

576
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:19,573
That way, we'll have Fish!

577
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:27,799
- Have a seat, Mrs. Fish.
- It seems occupied.

578
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:31,157
- Don't sit, then.
- I'd better run.

579
00:43:31,257 --> 00:43:33,624
He's never like this, I swear.

580
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:37,463
This time, you've gone too far.
Come on.

581
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:44,725
I'll go to bed, but Clemence
has to come warm my feet.

582
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:49,205
Wait.

583
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:59,537
Whoever wants a roof on their house
can go up there themselves.

584
00:43:59,642 --> 00:44:01,202
I'm not moving.

585
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:04,786
Forget about roofs.
No one's talking about roofs.

586
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,759
I've realized that roofs
aren't for climbing on.

587
00:44:08,698 --> 00:44:11,065
I'll tell you about roofs.

588
00:44:11,162 --> 00:44:13,071
I know about climbing on roofs.

589
00:44:13,178 --> 00:44:16,342
Clemence!
I'm waiting for you, honey!

590
00:44:28,602 --> 00:44:30,806
- You had no money this morning.
- No.

591
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,624
I'll explain.

592
00:44:35,898 --> 00:44:37,458
Oh, no!

593
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:50,032
That money was for Goujet!

594
00:44:51,195 --> 00:44:52,984
Think that's honest?

595
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:58,099
Drinking away his money
while he slaves 12 hours a day?

596
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:00,978
How can I pay him back?

597
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,058
We'll cancel the party, that's how!

598
00:45:04,155 --> 00:45:05,715
I'll repay him.

599
00:45:08,635 --> 00:45:10,261
That would be best.

600
00:45:10,363 --> 00:45:11,988
You don't care?

601
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:15,801
You said there'd be no dinner,
I just repeated it.

602
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:18,738
Me, I'd rather have the dinner.

603
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:22,552
- With what money?
- Exactly.

604
00:45:23,228 --> 00:45:25,050
With what money?

605
00:45:25,148 --> 00:45:26,741
So, no dinner.

606
00:45:26,843 --> 00:45:30,553
What'll they think of me?
We've been talking about it for a week.

607
00:45:31,227 --> 00:45:34,391
We talked about it too soon.

608
00:45:37,147 --> 00:45:39,930
I don't know,
work it out with him.

609
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,251
You think it's easy?

610
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:48,631
Easy with him?
For you, yes.

611
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:53,177
- Do you think I like it?
- I'm not saying you do.

612
00:45:53,724 --> 00:45:56,091
I'm saying you could.

613
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:57,748
Go to sleep.

614
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:04,091
I'll work it out.

615
00:46:04,604 --> 00:46:06,262
I'll work it out.

616
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,983
What's wrong?

617
00:46:10,556 --> 00:46:13,556
It's Coupeau.
I'm worried about him.

618
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,957
I thought as much.

619
00:46:17,597 --> 00:46:19,320
What can you expect
after falling off a roof?

620
00:46:19,421 --> 00:46:22,268
I know, but that was a long time ago.

621
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:24,535
Sure, but don't hold it against him.

622
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,762
He's healed now, but he's afraid.

623
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:32,436
That's what I told him,
but he said he wasn't.

624
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,581
Of course he wouldn't tell you that.

625
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:36,245
That must be it.

626
00:46:37,405 --> 00:46:41,049
- Change professions, maybe.
- Maybe.

627
00:46:43,645 --> 00:46:45,467
Blacksmith.

628
00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:49,531
He's not strong enough, is he?
- No, it's too hard.

629
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:52,946
Now is not a good time,
they just refused to give us a raise.

630
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,324
I heard about that.

631
00:46:55,997 --> 00:46:58,037
All the money you lent me -

632
00:46:58,141 --> 00:46:59,963
I lent you money?

633
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:02,843
Besides, about the money,
I wanted to tell you -

634
00:47:02,941 --> 00:47:05,112
All you think about is money!

635
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:08,955
- I wanted to ask you -
- Do you want me to shush you?

636
00:47:15,806 --> 00:47:19,188
That day, two good things happened:

637
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:22,652
First, he wanted to kiss me,

638
00:47:22,749 --> 00:47:26,066
and second, he left me
enough to pay for my dinner.

639
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,310
Isn't it gorgeous!

640
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,750
I can't wait to see
the Lorilleux's faces.

641
00:47:47,806 --> 00:47:49,213
Hello.

642
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:56,029
Nice work.

643
00:47:56,127 --> 00:47:57,850
Mrs. Gervaise!

644
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:05,853
You're doing well.
Mother! It's Virginie.

645
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,511
Show her the beast!

646
00:48:12,447 --> 00:48:14,007
Happy name day!

647
00:48:16,446 --> 00:48:18,007
Here it is!

648
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:21,366
- It's gorgeous!
- Did you see the thighs?

649
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:23,293
We'll eat it as is!

650
00:48:23,391 --> 00:48:26,042
Twelve and a half pounds!
Same as a pair of fat twins!

651
00:48:26,558 --> 00:48:28,217
Got a minute?

652
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,399
Sure.

653
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,039
What is it?
- Guess who I saw on the corner?

654
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:37,021
Lantier, my dear.

655
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:39,582
Come in.

656
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:46,458
What's he doing here?

657
00:48:47,616 --> 00:48:49,754
Did you talk to him?
- We're not on speaking terms.

658
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,798
I came to warn you, of course.

659
00:48:52,895 --> 00:48:54,172
Lantier?

660
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,678
Bravo!

661
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:59,223
If he starts sniffing around,
I'll rip him to shreds!

662
00:48:59,328 --> 00:49:01,695
Good God, I have the worst luck!

663
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,384
Just when I'm getting ready
for my party.

664
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,876
Will I never have peace?

665
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,880
I thought I'd forgotten Lantier.

666
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,375
A man who took you at 15,
who made you so unhappy,

667
00:49:16,479 --> 00:49:18,040
can 't be forgotten.

668
00:49:22,048 --> 00:49:24,415
Not those napkins for the Lorilleux.

669
00:49:25,888 --> 00:49:28,888
Use the two beautiful damask ones!
- They'll choke!

670
00:49:30,848 --> 00:49:32,255
Sad, isn't it?

671
00:49:32,352 --> 00:49:34,294
Being mean to them
is so much fun!

672
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:36,667
Why did they start it?

673
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,656
- It's the Lorilleux.
- If it isn't the Boches.

674
00:49:54,753 --> 00:49:55,800
Evening.

675
00:49:55,904 --> 00:49:58,108
Isn't that lovely?

676
00:49:58,208 --> 00:49:59,288
What is it?

677
00:49:59,393 --> 00:50:01,215
- And mine?
- Yes, it's very pretty.

678
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:02,873
Yours is pretty too.

679
00:50:02,977 --> 00:50:04,864
- Quit it.
- Anyway, it smells good.

680
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:06,073
Here!

681
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:09,151
You carry it.

682
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:15,711
You're here.

683
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:18,176
It's over, isn't it?
We'll both be nice.

684
00:50:18,273 --> 00:50:19,996
That's all I ever wanted.

685
00:50:21,153 --> 00:50:23,836
Hope it lasts...
- All's well that ends well.

686
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,719
You invited your employees?

687
00:50:26,817 --> 00:50:29,184
They're been hearing about it
for over a month.

688
00:50:29,282 --> 00:50:30,842
I'm not criticizing.

689
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,872
Thank you.

690
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:42,264
Let's get started.
- But Coupeau isn't here.

691
00:50:43,682 --> 00:50:45,504
We can't start without your husband.

692
00:50:45,602 --> 00:50:47,424
I'm sorry. He's probably nearby.

693
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:50,301
Let's look for him.

694
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,021
- Okay.
- I'll come with you.

695
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,177
What is it?

696
00:51:06,273 --> 00:51:08,313
Nothing, I slipped.

697
00:51:12,129 --> 00:51:13,853
Your wife is here.

698
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,490
Of course.

699
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,730
Don't touch me.
- Come home, everyone's waiting.

700
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:26,395
This is my home.

701
00:51:27,331 --> 00:51:29,153
Be sensible, everyone's there.

702
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:32,026
You sure it's me
you're looking for?

703
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:34,528
Who else?

704
00:51:35,523 --> 00:51:37,890
I'm coming, this could get ugly.

705
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:41,498
I saw your Lantier.
- Lantier?

706
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:43,425
My wife's old tomcat.

707
00:51:43,522 --> 00:51:45,562
He's at The Two-Headed Calf.

708
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:48,187
Want me to point him out?
You bet! Let's go.

709
00:51:49,347 --> 00:51:51,714
Don't do that to her on her name-day.

710
00:51:52,515 --> 00:51:54,075
You're so sweet.

711
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:05,020
Hello everybody.
You shouldn't have waited.

712
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:08,123
- It's about time. Sit.
- Everybody's here?

713
00:52:08,803 --> 00:52:12,099
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

714
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,301
10, 11, 12...

715
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,982
- Thirteen? That takes the cake.
- No way!

716
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:20,734
Sit down.

717
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:22,429
One, two, three...

718
00:52:23,747 --> 00:52:26,781
- How'd this happen?
- My husband's sick. I told you.

719
00:52:26,883 --> 00:52:28,989
Go take care of him,
then we'll be twelve!

720
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:32,415
Don't talk nonsense.

721
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,239
- Then I'll go.
- You're staying.

722
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:36,860
I'll find a fourteenth.

723
00:52:36,964 --> 00:52:37,979
Who?

724
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,740
Whoever I want.

725
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,615
Mrs. Gervaise!

726
00:52:43,716 --> 00:52:45,276
It's burning.

727
00:52:48,868 --> 00:52:51,551
It's not burning!
You scared me.

728
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:06,332
Bread?

729
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:10,435
Old Bru!

730
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:12,354
Are you hungry?

731
00:53:12,452 --> 00:53:14,557
Me? I haven't eaten.

732
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,383
Come on, then!

733
00:53:27,013 --> 00:53:29,052
You did well to invite him.

734
00:53:29,157 --> 00:53:31,524
- Glad you're here, Old Bru.
- I don't mind.

735
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:34,304
Here, honey,
I didn't forget about you!

736
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,064
A day like today,
we still get along!

737
00:53:47,652 --> 00:53:50,336
Mommy, Augustine
wants to kiss the boys!

738
00:53:50,437 --> 00:53:53,601
Liar! She put food in my glass!

739
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:56,477
What nerve! That's a lie!

740
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:59,778
Stop bothering me!
Get busy eating.

741
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:07,613
Go ahead kids,

742
00:54:07,717 --> 00:54:09,440
that's fine gravy!

743
00:54:21,253 --> 00:54:23,141
Beautiful!

744
00:54:25,253 --> 00:54:26,814
Let's get down to business!

745
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:28,957
That's what I call a lady!

746
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:30,850
Look at those thighs!

747
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,511
She didn't get that fat
by eating stones!

748
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,714
- Who'll carve?
- It's not hard,

749
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,701
you grab a piece and pull.

750
00:54:37,798 --> 00:54:39,653
The pieces are still good.

751
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,270
- Don't ruin it!
- You don't know how.

752
00:54:42,374 --> 00:54:46,051
- Then who?
- Mr. Fish. He's had weapons training!

753
00:55:15,014 --> 00:55:16,607
Imagine that were a Cossack...

754
00:55:18,279 --> 00:55:21,345
- You fought the Cossacks?
- There's none left.

755
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:32,741
The parson's nose!

756
00:55:41,095 --> 00:55:42,786
- Where were you?
- Guess!

757
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:44,862
You don't ask
about such things!

758
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:50,050
- If only she'd pee in my mouth like that!
- Don't be disgusting!

759
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:50,751
Well?

760
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:52,579
He's still there,
pretending to read the paper.

761
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:55,549
- Is he drunk?
- Not at all.

762
00:55:55,655 --> 00:55:58,110
Good. Sober, he's not mean.

763
00:56:08,296 --> 00:56:10,118
I want the parson's nose!

764
00:56:10,888 --> 00:56:12,611
You deserve it.

765
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:15,648
Looks good.

766
00:56:23,432 --> 00:56:24,609
Once every 12 years.

767
00:56:40,968 --> 00:56:43,488
Another nice morsel for connoisseurs!

768
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:48,103
You shouldn't have.

769
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,924
It's good.

770
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:54,148
I don't know. My two sons died
in the Crimean War.

771
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:57,664
Enough about war!

772
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,810
Don't be so sad.

773
00:56:59,912 --> 00:57:05,411
If they hadn't died in Crimea,
I'd eat every day.

774
00:57:06,601 --> 00:57:09,186
So enjoy it now.

775
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:11,012
I ask for work

776
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:13,857
and they say, "Too old."

777
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:17,312
They're right.

778
00:57:19,529 --> 00:57:22,496
If you can't work anymore,
you might as well die.

779
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:25,383
Don't talk that way, Old Bru.

780
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:27,172
If you do, how can
things ever change?

781
00:57:28,554 --> 00:57:29,481
Change what?

782
00:57:30,474 --> 00:57:32,197
Lots of things.

783
00:57:32,297 --> 00:57:36,192
Soldiers get pensions.
Why not workers?

784
00:57:36,297 --> 00:57:37,857
Excuse me!

785
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:39,903
My apologies, soldier.

786
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,213
- Some goose.
- "Some goose."

787
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:46,181
She's so funny!

788
00:57:47,178 --> 00:57:49,000
They only left us the carcass!

789
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,890
Soldiers are soldiers
and workers are workers.

790
00:57:53,994 --> 00:57:55,401
They shouldn't ask for much.

791
00:57:55,497 --> 00:57:57,385
We won't ask, we'll take it!

792
00:58:00,106 --> 00:58:02,113
If we weren't
both guests here...

793
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:04,040
Enough! Drop it!

794
00:58:04,138 --> 00:58:05,152
No politics!

795
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:10,182
Let's drink to the boss!

796
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:11,940
That's better!

797
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:21,865
Give me some!

798
00:58:26,698 --> 00:58:28,902
The salad!

799
00:58:29,002 --> 00:58:31,239
I'm wild about salad!

800
00:58:32,394 --> 00:58:33,955
Clemence?

801
00:58:36,234 --> 00:58:38,122
There's always room for salad!

802
00:58:38,794 --> 00:58:40,103
Missed the plate!

803
00:58:41,259 --> 00:58:43,626
I'd eat it on all fours
in a field!

804
00:58:43,723 --> 00:58:45,283
Mrs. Boche!

805
00:58:51,115 --> 00:58:53,417
Some water, please!

806
00:58:53,515 --> 00:58:56,417
Water?
You're not that dirty!

807
00:58:59,179 --> 00:59:02,528
At my house, we only drink wine.
Workers need wine, believe me!

808
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:07,147
No water in my house!

809
00:59:08,459 --> 00:59:11,142
Because, here's an example:
The Emperor -

810
00:59:11,243 --> 00:59:13,283
Show some respect!

811
00:59:14,923 --> 00:59:18,239
Maybe the Emperor
is drunk right now too!

812
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:22,891
That makes us the same,
us and the Emperor.

813
00:59:22,988 --> 00:59:25,126
Come on.

814
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:27,561
Because he couldn't be drunker than us!

815
00:59:32,684 --> 00:59:34,407
How about a song?

816
00:59:36,588 --> 00:59:37,995
Your turn!

817
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:43,558
Of all the things we plant
one never grows tall

818
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,883
Of all the things we plant
one never grows at all

819
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:52,198
Those under the dirt
ain 't got no need to worry

820
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,130
But to go down and join them,
we ain 't in no hurry!

821
00:59:57,132 --> 01:00:01,988
Of war we 'd had enough
We 've been to hell and back

822
01:00:02,092 --> 01:00:07,657
Of dirt we 've had enough
Once under, you don 't come back

823
01:00:11,597 --> 01:00:13,419
Gervaise, sing us something.

824
01:00:13,517 --> 01:00:16,681
- No, I can't sing.
- Sure you can!

825
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,208
- What?
- He's outside.

826
01:00:23,309 --> 01:00:25,097
Let's hear the boss sing!

827
01:00:26,572 --> 01:00:30,347
Sing "Let Me Sleep."
You know it well.

828
01:00:31,757 --> 01:00:34,277
- Come on, Gervaise!
- Go on, boss!

829
01:00:37,389 --> 01:00:40,356
I'll sing "Let Me Sleep."

830
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,632
Trying to give your guests a hint?

831
01:00:44,589 --> 01:00:49,291
What's the use of dreaming
of birds and nests

832
01:00:49,389 --> 01:00:54,627
If the bird flies away
and abandons the nest

833
01:00:54,733 --> 01:00:59,971
If the pigeon dies
so does his mate

834
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:06,438
What's the use of dreaming
of birds and nests

835
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:12,458
What's the use of sleeping
if the night disappears

836
01:01:12,557 --> 01:01:17,707
If I must wake
and face the day

837
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:23,499
If I only wake
to shed more tears

838
01:01:23,598 --> 01:01:28,038
What's the use of sleeping

839
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:31,525
If the night disappears

840
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:37,004
Days and nights
whirl through my head

841
01:01:37,102 --> 01:01:44,423
Days and nights
fill me with dread

842
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:56,586
What's the use of dreaming -

843
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:04,196
Let me sleep

844
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:06,244
Let me -

845
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:09,799
I can 't remember!
- You did fine.

846
01:02:09,902 --> 01:02:11,910
- Bravo!
- Good job!

847
01:02:15,502 --> 01:02:17,575
Well, imagine that! It's Mr. -

848
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:19,592
Who?

849
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,220
Nothing.

850
01:02:23,055 --> 01:02:25,510
Now you, Mrs. Putois.

851
01:02:26,191 --> 01:02:28,100
You don't have to ask twice!

852
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:34,916
What are you doing?

853
01:02:35,023 --> 01:02:36,550
Prepare to attack!

854
01:02:36,655 --> 01:02:39,819
On the frigate La Jolie
we were 36 to be hung

855
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:47,467
If the king catches us
we 'll all be hung

856
01:03:04,271 --> 01:03:08,395
If the king catches us
we 'll all be hung

857
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,963
A friend!

858
01:03:31,344 --> 01:03:32,904
Good evening.

859
01:03:33,584 --> 01:03:35,144
Good evening.

860
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:39,984
Care for a coffee?

861
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:47,817
Get moving!
Make some coffee!

862
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:50,985
Fine.

863
01:03:51,985 --> 01:03:53,545
If you think so.

864
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:08,360
Who's that guy?

865
01:04:08,465 --> 01:04:10,407
What's it matter to you?

866
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,007
It's Lantier, right?

867
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:14,576
Yes, it's him.

868
01:04:14,673 --> 01:04:17,226
Bravo. Good night.

869
01:04:19,761 --> 01:04:21,168
Don't go yet.

870
01:04:21,265 --> 01:04:22,825
Seeing him means
that much to you?

871
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,647
No, I swear. It's nothing.

872
01:04:25,745 --> 01:04:30,023
- It doesn't look like nothing.
- I was afraid, just afraid.

873
01:04:30,706 --> 01:04:32,942
He only makes me afraid.

874
01:04:35,346 --> 01:04:36,753
Kiss me.

875
01:04:38,161 --> 01:04:40,431
You've had too much to drink.

876
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:43,082
You too.

877
01:04:43,186 --> 01:04:44,746
Let's take advantage of it.

878
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:23,081
I see I'm the last.
I'd better go.

879
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:24,593
What's the rush?

880
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:26,894
I have a long road home
to Glacière.

881
01:05:26,995 --> 01:05:29,297
You didn't even say hello to the kids.

882
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:31,854
That's true.

883
01:05:31,954 --> 01:05:34,802
I'll say good-bye while I'm at it.
- This way.

884
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:42,192
He won't wake up,
he's drunk as a lord, but look.

885
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:45,130
Has his mother's eyes, right?

886
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:50,990
- Yes, I remember.
- I raised him well.

887
01:05:51,091 --> 01:05:52,913
He's a good worker!

888
01:05:53,971 --> 01:05:56,208
This means a lot to me.

889
01:05:56,883 --> 01:05:58,792
It's a pleasure I've long denied myself.

890
01:05:58,899 --> 01:06:02,215
I thought "She's moved on, just drop it.

891
01:06:03,347 --> 01:06:05,289
Don't be selfish."

892
01:06:06,931 --> 01:06:09,135
Well, that's that.

893
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:12,434
Thanks for fulfilling my wish.

894
01:06:12,531 --> 01:06:14,091
I've seen my kid.

895
01:06:14,195 --> 01:06:16,529
Come see him whenever you like!

896
01:06:18,547 --> 01:06:20,587
Want to hear about Claude?

897
01:06:20,692 --> 01:06:23,823
- That's right! How's little Claude?
- Fine.

898
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,147
He's living with an aunt.

899
01:06:28,212 --> 01:06:29,618
Wait.

900
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:32,748
He's at the aunt's?

901
01:06:33,747 --> 01:06:35,569
He's happy, then.

902
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:37,161
Yes.

903
01:06:38,356 --> 01:06:39,338
He's happy.

904
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,641
No!

905
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:55,308
Wake up, Lalie.

906
01:06:58,068 --> 01:07:00,305
Time to go home.

907
01:07:00,404 --> 01:07:02,957
- Thank you.
- For your children.

908
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,067
Good-bye, Mr. Coupeau.

909
01:07:05,173 --> 01:07:06,995
Good-bye, Miss.

910
01:07:07,828 --> 01:07:09,716
Go home quickly!

911
01:07:09,813 --> 01:07:12,017
Damn it!

912
01:07:12,116 --> 01:07:13,261
Hell!

913
01:07:14,388 --> 01:07:16,755
- What are you doing?
- You won't beat me!

914
01:07:21,044 --> 01:07:22,538
Glacière!

915
01:07:22,645 --> 01:07:24,368
It's too far. Help me.

916
01:07:25,205 --> 01:07:26,765
Grab that side.

917
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:50,739
- What's going on?
- We're stopping work.

918
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:52,561
- I'm with you.
- It's not up to you.

919
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,418
Go inside, I'll ask your father.

920
01:08:54,518 --> 01:08:56,885
Which one?
I've got too many fathers!

921
01:08:56,983 --> 01:08:59,404
Want me to get mad?
Stop grumbling and go to work.

922
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:01,333
Yes, Daddy.

923
01:09:02,006 --> 01:09:05,006
Lazy dogs, coming in or not?

924
01:09:05,686 --> 01:09:08,053
- First, we'll talk to the boss.
- First, go to work.

925
01:09:08,151 --> 01:09:10,453
- First, our five-cent raise.
- You refuse to work?

926
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:12,176
No, but we want our five cents.

927
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:15,443
Never! Those five cents
will cost you!

928
01:09:26,519 --> 01:09:29,137
That's when Terrasse told me,

929
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:33,134
"Mr. Tom, we want
a five-cent raise."

930
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:39,277
I said, "Dear boy, you're better off working
than asking me for such things."

931
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:42,384
He answered,
"We know what we have to do."

932
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:46,994
That night, a policeman urged me
to inform the police chief,

933
01:09:47,096 --> 01:09:49,135
and several workers were arrested.

934
01:09:50,136 --> 01:09:54,893
What did Goujet do?
They say he's one of the leaders.

935
01:09:54,999 --> 01:09:58,065
I've been told he threatened
those who continued working,

936
01:09:58,168 --> 01:10:00,917
but I didn't hear him

937
01:10:01,015 --> 01:10:03,634
and I'd be surprised if he had.

938
01:10:03,736 --> 01:10:07,119
Goujet has worked for me for a long time
and has always behaved well.

939
01:10:07,224 --> 01:10:10,573
It seems Goujet said,

940
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,548
"lf anybody tries to return to work,
I'll make sure they don't."

941
01:10:15,352 --> 01:10:17,360
I never heard anything like that.

942
01:10:19,544 --> 01:10:23,767
Bretonnière, didn't you report
this threat of Goujet's?

943
01:10:23,864 --> 01:10:25,686
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Liar!

944
01:10:25,784 --> 01:10:27,988
What do you have to say?
Stand up!

945
01:10:28,697 --> 01:10:30,519
I say Bretonnière is a liar.

946
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,207
We thought we were acting lawfully.

947
01:10:33,304 --> 01:10:34,864
Sit down.

948
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:38,515
It's not against the law
to ask for a raise,

949
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:41,560
but stopping work is.

950
01:10:43,576 --> 01:10:47,024
I pass sentence as follows:
Terrasse, two years imprisonment.

951
01:10:47,704 --> 01:10:49,559
Goujet, one year imprisonment.

952
01:10:49,657 --> 01:10:53,519
Lapeyre, repeat offender,
16 months and a 16-franc fine.

953
01:11:05,273 --> 01:11:09,070
- You've got a nice place.
- Yes, it is.

954
01:11:14,073 --> 01:11:16,593
Could you find me a room
like this in the area?

955
01:11:21,273 --> 01:11:22,834
Come with me.

956
01:11:30,234 --> 01:11:31,794
A room like this?

957
01:11:35,097 --> 01:11:36,658
It's yours.

958
01:11:37,337 --> 01:11:38,898
Go on!

959
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:40,910
I'll make you a deal.

960
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:45,489
I couldn't, buddy.

961
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:47,958
It'd be no fun for you.

962
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:50,425
I'd have to cross
your room every night.

963
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:57,328
We'll make this a door.
It'll only take a few hours.

964
01:11:57,434 --> 01:12:00,500
- What about your mother?
- She'll sleep with Nana.

965
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,774
Come on.

966
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,879
You can't understand.
Friendship between men,

967
01:12:05,978 --> 01:12:07,538
nothing's better.

968
01:12:07,642 --> 01:12:10,424
I don't know,
what will people say?

969
01:12:10,522 --> 01:12:12,409
I don't give a damn.

970
01:12:17,275 --> 01:12:18,835
I'm ashamed.

971
01:12:18,939 --> 01:12:21,622
Someone had you before me,
and I'm glad it was him.

972
01:12:26,523 --> 01:12:28,410
I get a kick out of that guy.

973
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:14,196
Not through here.

974
01:13:14,299 --> 01:13:16,023
That way.

975
01:13:30,876 --> 01:13:34,454
- What class!
- More that that!

976
01:13:34,556 --> 01:13:37,239
- Coming from you -
- I say what I think.

977
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,674
All he has to do is ask.

978
01:13:39,772 --> 01:13:42,292
- Oh, Clemence!
- Perhaps he's already asked?

979
01:14:20,637 --> 01:14:23,190
Coupeau? Gervaise?

980
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:24,854
Who is it?

981
01:14:30,813 --> 01:14:33,334
I'm Lantier.
- Of course.

982
01:14:33,437 --> 01:14:34,997
Are the Coupeaus out?

983
01:14:35,101 --> 01:14:36,661
They'll be back soon.

984
01:14:36,765 --> 01:14:39,002
It hasn't been a year.

985
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:40,727
Not quite.

986
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:43,251
They released you
for the Emperor's celebration.

987
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:47,068
They owe you that.

988
01:14:48,797 --> 01:14:51,383
I'm taking apart
the old lady's bed.

989
01:14:52,669 --> 01:14:54,393
She's in the hospital.

990
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:57,020
Since it's Sunday, they're visiting her.

991
01:15:02,334 --> 01:15:05,017
Between us,
I think she's done for.

992
01:15:05,118 --> 01:15:07,125
It'll free up some space.

993
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:10,229
It's better than mine,
so it'll go in my room.

994
01:15:14,237 --> 01:15:15,961
Mr. Goujet!

995
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:35,227
Leave some for me!

996
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:41,085
Honestly, Lantier, get dressed!

997
01:15:41,759 --> 01:15:43,646
You'll stay for lunch, of course.

998
01:15:43,742 --> 01:15:45,465
- No thanks.
- Please stay!

999
01:15:45,566 --> 01:15:47,573
Don't push him.

1000
01:15:47,678 --> 01:15:51,769
Let Goujet do as he wishes.
- Stay. He has lots to tell.

1001
01:15:52,702 --> 01:15:54,263
Lots of things?

1002
01:15:55,774 --> 01:15:58,196
Nothing of interest.
Good-bye.

1003
01:15:58,879 --> 01:16:00,766
Wait, I'll walk with you.

1004
01:16:02,398 --> 01:16:03,959
He looked funny, the prisoner.

1005
01:16:05,599 --> 01:16:08,119
Staying in your nightshirt all day?

1006
01:16:08,223 --> 01:16:09,946
Think that's what shocked him?

1007
01:16:12,703 --> 01:16:15,004
It shocks me too.

1008
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:16,183
Not me.

1009
01:16:16,287 --> 01:16:18,327
Let people think what they want!

1010
01:16:18,431 --> 01:16:21,017
I'm above that!
- Oh, you!

1011
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,843
What about me?

1012
01:16:22,943 --> 01:16:24,504
You?

1013
01:16:26,559 --> 01:16:27,966
Nothing.

1014
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:37,373
Let her pout,
it's good for her.

1015
01:16:37,471 --> 01:16:39,893
Get dressed.
We'll have lunch, just us men.

1016
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:41,406
With what?

1017
01:16:45,599 --> 01:16:47,487
Where'd you get that?

1018
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,815
Someone must've "kindly" told him
what I did while he was in jail.

1019
01:16:58,975 --> 01:17:00,382
Virginie.

1020
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,040
I wouldn 't put it past her.

1021
01:17:02,144 --> 01:17:04,184
She 's behind everything that happened.

1022
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:12,606
No!

1023
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,447
Stop, I ' ll never drink all that!

1024
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:20,025
- It's nothing.
- I 'm not used to it!

1025
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,961
Amanda!

1026
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,924
You're not interested
in my soul

1027
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:43,708
My body is all you want

1028
01:17:44,737 --> 01:17:48,349
How can she be naked like that
in front of everyone?

1029
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,804
It's part of the job!

1030
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:58,172
Instead of the treasure within

1031
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:02,267
All you want is my skin

1032
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:05,050
She does have gorgeous skin.

1033
01:18:05,153 --> 01:18:06,877
Gorgeous.

1034
01:18:06,977 --> 01:18:09,433
I weep, I weep, I weep,
for after all

1035
01:18:09,537 --> 01:18:11,359
It's just skin-deep

1036
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:17,120
I want romance, love unique

1037
01:18:17,217 --> 01:18:19,738
But all you ever desire

1038
01:18:19,841 --> 01:18:22,362
Is to caress my physique

1039
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:25,149
Can 't you aim any higher

1040
01:18:25,249 --> 01:18:27,671
Why regard breadth and girth

1041
01:18:27,778 --> 01:18:30,777
As if they were my only worth

1042
01:18:30,881 --> 01:18:32,823
But I have heart

1043
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,653
Feelings too

1044
01:18:34,754 --> 01:18:39,675
And ideals
under what's in view

1045
01:18:41,697 --> 01:18:44,697
I weep
when gentlemen come to call

1046
01:18:44,802 --> 01:18:47,322
I weep, I weep, I weep,
for after all

1047
01:18:47,426 --> 01:18:49,946
It's just skin-deep

1048
01:18:50,882 --> 01:18:54,231
Poets say women are

1049
01:18:54,338 --> 01:18:56,705
Flowers, roses and dears

1050
01:18:56,802 --> 01:18:59,485
What we want is their hearts

1051
01:18:59,586 --> 01:19:02,269
But they think only of our rears

1052
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,890
They may call us heavenly

1053
01:19:04,994 --> 01:19:07,896
Or name us as goddesses triumphant

1054
01:19:08,002 --> 01:19:12,193
Still they return obstinately

1055
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:16,830
To our little firmament

1056
01:19:18,338 --> 01:19:19,767
What's so funny?

1057
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:22,875
"Her little firmament."
Don't you get it?

1058
01:19:25,922 --> 01:19:27,745
Didn't you teach her anything?

1059
01:19:31,362 --> 01:19:33,337
Mes Bottes!

1060
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,742
What did you do with Coupeau?

1061
01:19:35,843 --> 01:19:38,047
Come here!
- I didn't eat him!

1062
01:19:39,715 --> 01:19:42,202
- Where is he?
- Hey! What's your problem?

1063
01:19:46,211 --> 01:19:48,600
He didn't come home last night,
you know.

1064
01:19:49,635 --> 01:19:52,002
I know, neither did l!

1065
01:19:53,475 --> 01:19:55,842
We were together.
- Where's he now?

1066
01:19:57,795 --> 01:20:00,478
He mentioned going to Les Halles
for some snails.

1067
01:20:04,483 --> 01:20:07,483
Thanks, Virginie.
I had a great time.

1068
01:20:07,588 --> 01:20:09,955
- Good night.
- Be good!

1069
01:20:11,683 --> 01:20:13,723
She's so silly, Virginie.

1070
01:20:13,827 --> 01:20:15,802
There you are!

1071
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:19,647
- About time.
- What is it? Is he hurt?

1072
01:20:20,676 --> 01:20:25,662
In his state,
I should have put him in jail,

1073
01:20:25,764 --> 01:20:27,422
but since we're friends -

1074
01:20:27,524 --> 01:20:29,564
- Did you see?
- Even though he puked on me.

1075
01:20:29,668 --> 01:20:32,516
- Did you see my sidewalk?
- It really stinks.

1076
01:20:48,132 --> 01:20:49,758
He'll be in so much trouble!

1077
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,800
Go to bed.
It's none of our business.

1078
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:07,811
The slob.

1079
01:21:08,484 --> 01:21:10,524
He didn't.

1080
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,407
Come, my little Gervaise.

1081
01:22:57,511 --> 01:23:00,359
No, I'm staying here.

1082
01:23:01,191 --> 01:23:03,362
What are you afraid of?

1083
01:23:03,463 --> 01:23:05,536
He can't hear us.

1084
01:23:05,639 --> 01:23:07,549
I promise I won't touch you.

1085
01:23:09,831 --> 01:23:11,392
You're hurting me.

1086
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:13,990
No!

1087
01:23:15,815 --> 01:23:18,335
Oh, God!

1088
01:23:19,175 --> 01:23:21,117
He threw me out of bed.

1089
01:23:22,599 --> 01:23:24,421
I don't even have a bed.

1090
01:24:24,808 --> 01:24:27,175
- Awake already?
- It's time.

1091
01:24:39,049 --> 01:24:41,121
I slept on a chair.

1092
01:24:42,281 --> 01:24:44,964
I'd have given you my bed.

1093
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:59,519
My poor child, what could I tell him?

1094
01:25:00,681 --> 01:25:01,609
Nothing.

1095
01:25:01,705 --> 01:25:03,528
He no longer loves his mother,
that's all.

1096
01:25:06,121 --> 01:25:10,725
And the only one who loved me,
the only one who could've stopped it,

1097
01:25:10,825 --> 01:25:12,386
had to be in prison.

1098
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:17,349
And now that he 's back,

1099
01:25:18,345 --> 01:25:20,287
how can I tell him?

1100
01:25:21,289 --> 01:25:23,493
He 'd never understand.

1101
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:27,813
It seems I 'm too late,

1102
01:25:28,649 --> 01:25:30,853
from what I 've seen.
- What did you see?

1103
01:25:31,689 --> 01:25:33,577
I told you, nothing's going on!

1104
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:37,438
Don't you believe me?

1105
01:25:39,305 --> 01:25:40,712
I believe you.

1106
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,163
You see?

1107
01:25:45,002 --> 01:25:46,563
Because it's the truth.

1108
01:25:47,306 --> 01:25:48,484
Come on.

1109
01:25:48,586 --> 01:25:49,993
Dance with me.

1110
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:10,050
I was wrong to go to jail.

1111
01:26:10,154 --> 01:26:11,715
That's for sure!

1112
01:26:13,162 --> 01:26:14,722
But I went,

1113
01:26:15,402 --> 01:26:17,126
and in the meantime,
Lantier moved in.

1114
01:26:17,803 --> 01:26:19,843
It was Coupeau who wanted it!

1115
01:26:20,523 --> 01:26:22,410
Sure it was.

1116
01:26:26,411 --> 01:26:28,233
Why'd you let him?

1117
01:26:28,331 --> 01:26:30,153
I was wrong, I know.

1118
01:26:33,066 --> 01:26:35,816
Gervaise always wants
to please everyone.

1119
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,858
If I had slept with him,

1120
01:26:38,955 --> 01:26:40,711
you know I'd tell you.

1121
01:26:41,227 --> 01:26:42,340
No.

1122
01:26:43,019 --> 01:26:44,425
Why would you?

1123
01:26:45,803 --> 01:26:47,777
I tell you everything.

1124
01:26:47,883 --> 01:26:49,770
You wouldn't tell me.

1125
01:26:49,867 --> 01:26:52,551
You'd be ashamed.
- Good God, yes.

1126
01:26:52,651 --> 01:26:54,277
I would be ashamed.

1127
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:57,571
Do you believe me?

1128
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:02,852
I believe you.

1129
01:28:12,045 --> 01:28:13,289
I knew it.

1130
01:28:41,294 --> 01:28:42,854
- Not finished?
- No.

1131
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,518
I'm in no mood to laugh.

1132
01:28:45,517 --> 01:28:47,339
And you, what do you think?

1133
01:28:47,437 --> 01:28:49,641
- Of what?
- Etienne.

1134
01:28:50,349 --> 01:28:51,909
Should we let him go
with Goujet?

1135
01:28:52,013 --> 01:28:54,380
A worker should travel!

1136
01:28:54,478 --> 01:28:56,845
I thought you'd come
to help raise him.

1137
01:28:56,942 --> 01:29:00,422
- He's already been raised.
- I already said no.

1138
01:29:00,526 --> 01:29:03,842
He's just starting out,
it's crazy. I said no.

1139
01:29:03,949 --> 01:29:06,153
- I say yes.
- Who asked you?

1140
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:09,292
I'm his father.

1141
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:14,313
That's true.
You're right. Sorry.

1142
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:20,393
- Got any tobacco?
- Who knows? Look around.

1143
01:29:28,014 --> 01:29:29,421
Why are mornings so rough?

1144
01:29:30,734 --> 01:29:32,141
It's simple:
You drink too much.

1145
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:34,442
It's not too much,
it does me good!

1146
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:36,746
- If you say so.
- I'm healthier than you!

1147
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:40,518
Look at that!
Tight as a drum!

1148
01:29:40,622 --> 01:29:43,688
You should get one.

1149
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:45,613
Unhealthy fat.

1150
01:29:45,711 --> 01:29:47,653
You're jealous because
you don't have any.

1151
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:52,998
Typical, no matches.

1152
01:29:53,102 --> 01:29:54,509
Lantier was right.

1153
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:56,647
Drink was killing Coupeau.

1154
01:29:57,358 --> 01:30:00,141
There were days I thought,
"Good riddance."

1155
01:30:01,455 --> 01:30:03,495
- What are you looking for?
- My suitcase.

1156
01:30:04,815 --> 01:30:07,019
Is Etienne leaving tomorrow?

1157
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:09,159
You know he is. Go to sleep.

1158
01:30:09,263 --> 01:30:11,086
Daddy took your suitcase.

1159
01:30:13,839 --> 01:30:14,766
Why?

1160
01:30:14,863 --> 01:30:16,685
For the pawnshop.

1161
01:30:20,527 --> 01:30:24,324
He put sheets in it,
your customers' sheets.

1162
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:35,438
Thief.

1163
01:30:46,511 --> 01:30:47,591
Thief!

1164
01:31:04,784 --> 01:31:06,508
Shut the door!

1165
01:31:19,312 --> 01:31:22,062
The sheets. Tell me!

1166
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:24,844
Where are my sheets?
- Your sheets.

1167
01:31:24,945 --> 01:31:26,767
Did you pawn them?

1168
01:31:27,856 --> 01:31:29,679
They weren't your sheets!

1169
01:31:30,353 --> 01:31:31,760
Thief!

1170
01:31:31,857 --> 01:31:34,856
That's enough, I said!

1171
01:31:35,536 --> 01:31:38,536
Give me the pawn slip!

1172
01:31:38,641 --> 01:31:40,201
That tickles!

1173
01:31:48,273 --> 01:31:49,931
It's a pawn slip.

1174
01:31:50,609 --> 01:31:52,813
Here's what I think
of your pawn slip!

1175
01:31:55,889 --> 01:31:57,449
I ate your sheets!

1176
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:03,529
Slob!

1177
01:32:06,513 --> 01:32:08,968
- Leaving so soon?
- I'll be back!

1178
01:32:21,553 --> 01:32:24,073
Gervaise!

1179
01:32:28,273 --> 01:32:30,575
This can't go on.
I'm not leaving.

1180
01:32:30,674 --> 01:32:33,194
You must leave.

1181
01:32:34,289 --> 01:32:36,013
"You must leave."

1182
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:39,952
He must leave.
Obey your father.

1183
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:41,610
You must leave.

1184
01:34:09,556 --> 01:34:11,760
They were the only
good things in my life.

1185
01:34:12,436 --> 01:34:14,258
Maybe that's why they left.

1186
01:34:30,356 --> 01:34:33,039
- Virginie's pillowcase.
- So what?

1187
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:34,547
Smell it.

1188
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:37,267
Heliotrope.

1189
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:39,762
Remind you of anything?

1190
01:35:18,997 --> 01:35:20,721
What's your problem?

1191
01:35:38,998 --> 01:35:41,616
Gervaise, this is the last straw!

1192
01:35:41,717 --> 01:35:43,441
You call this clean?

1193
01:35:43,542 --> 01:35:45,102
It's still greasy.

1194
01:35:47,957 --> 01:35:50,739
Maybe if Mr. Boche didn't put
that dirty pomade in his hair!

1195
01:35:50,837 --> 01:35:52,244
Mr. Boche?

1196
01:35:52,342 --> 01:35:54,065
He does his hair as he likes!

1197
01:35:55,158 --> 01:35:57,427
Fine, I'll do it again.

1198
01:35:58,102 --> 01:36:00,142
And you, my dear,
are losing your touch!

1199
01:36:00,245 --> 01:36:01,969
I'm not losing my touch,
I'm working alone

1200
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:03,793
and I've only got
one set of hands!

1201
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:07,793
One last thing,
the owner comes tomorrow.

1202
01:36:07,894 --> 01:36:09,301
I know.

1203
01:36:09,398 --> 01:36:12,464
I'm only 10 days late.
- Only 10?

1204
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:15,029
First, it's 13.

1205
01:36:15,126 --> 01:36:18,126
And second,
he's thrown people out for less!

1206
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:22,034
More respectable people!

1207
01:36:33,527 --> 01:36:35,567
That's one less client.

1208
01:36:36,534 --> 01:36:38,574
One less source of disgust.

1209
01:36:40,183 --> 01:36:41,743
And 10 francs less every month.

1210
01:36:41,847 --> 01:36:43,635
Don't bug me!

1211
01:36:43,735 --> 01:36:45,491
Mind your own business!

1212
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:48,274
It is my business when
you owe me two weeks pay!

1213
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:50,197
I never said I didn't.

1214
01:36:52,951 --> 01:36:54,358
They don't deprive themselves.

1215
01:36:56,599 --> 01:36:58,421
Where's my glass?

1216
01:36:58,519 --> 01:37:00,275
Come and get it, lazybones.

1217
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:02,197
Is that how you
speak to your father?

1218
01:37:03,383 --> 01:37:04,944
It wasn't me.

1219
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:09,072
Stew, again!

1220
01:37:09,751 --> 01:37:11,791
Drat! I've had it!

1221
01:37:15,959 --> 01:37:16,887
Slob!

1222
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:23,120
Who did that?
- We're sick of potatoes.

1223
01:37:23,223 --> 01:37:25,492
Give me money
and we'll have meat.

1224
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:28,302
Give me that!
- Bye! I'm going to eat.

1225
01:37:28,407 --> 01:37:30,546
You're lucky, I'm sick of potatoes!

1226
01:37:30,647 --> 01:37:33,964
It might not be your fault,
but lately, you must admit -

1227
01:37:34,968 --> 01:37:37,488
And you,
do you pay my alimony?

1228
01:37:37,592 --> 01:37:38,672
Come on.

1229
01:37:38,775 --> 01:37:42,256
"Come on," what's that mean?
Come on, come on.

1230
01:37:43,256 --> 01:37:45,078
You'll drive me crazy.

1231
01:37:49,848 --> 01:37:51,888
I don't like potatoes either!

1232
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,062
If that's how you feel, I'll leave.

1233
01:38:01,016 --> 01:38:03,886
Great! Go away.

1234
01:38:04,888 --> 01:38:06,448
And don't come back.

1235
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,604
- We can't go on like this.
- No.

1236
01:38:11,704 --> 01:38:13,613
To say such things...

1237
01:38:14,456 --> 01:38:16,496
When the trough is empty,
we fight like beasts.

1238
01:38:20,056 --> 01:38:22,096
What if I found someone
to take over the shop?

1239
01:38:22,201 --> 01:38:25,517
Right away!
I'll close up shop and good riddance!

1240
01:38:25,625 --> 01:38:27,031
Are you crazy?

1241
01:38:28,921 --> 01:38:30,895
We'll find someone.

1242
01:38:31,576 --> 01:38:32,983
I don't know.

1243
01:38:33,817 --> 01:38:35,377
Think about it.

1244
01:38:38,297 --> 01:38:40,119
I can't believe it.

1245
01:38:40,217 --> 01:38:41,940
Why did you say that?

1246
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,863
Your shop, don't you remember?

1247
01:38:44,985 --> 01:38:46,392
Your shop.

1248
01:38:47,065 --> 01:38:48,887
Yes, I wanted my shop.

1249
01:38:50,201 --> 01:38:52,089
Lord, how I wanted it!

1250
01:38:52,601 --> 01:38:54,161
And I got it.

1251
01:38:54,265 --> 01:38:57,811
And now, where's my shop?

1252
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:01,272
You two ate it.

1253
01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:03,410
It's in your belly and his.

1254
01:39:04,729 --> 01:39:07,413
My God, we were
better off as employees.

1255
01:39:08,473 --> 01:39:12,751
I don't want it anymore.
I can't stand it. They can have it.

1256
01:39:29,338 --> 01:39:32,338
Get your crocks and china
fixed here!

1257
01:39:37,562 --> 01:39:39,122
May I join you?

1258
01:39:40,025 --> 01:39:41,848
Not having lunch at home?

1259
01:39:42,362 --> 01:39:44,336
Give him a bag, too.

1260
01:39:44,442 --> 01:39:46,646
You're right, it's gone too far.

1261
01:39:47,642 --> 01:39:49,465
You won't see me around there
much longer!

1262
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:52,018
What a pity.

1263
01:39:52,122 --> 01:39:54,010
As if you care.

1264
01:39:54,106 --> 01:39:56,048
That's not a nice thing to say!

1265
01:40:07,003 --> 01:40:09,686
Isn't it beautiful?
Care to join me?

1266
01:40:09,786 --> 01:40:13,015
- Are you alone?
- If I were, I wouldn't invite you.

1267
01:40:13,115 --> 01:40:14,937
In that case, thanks.

1268
01:40:15,035 --> 01:40:16,442
Good-bye, Clemence.

1269
01:40:16,539 --> 01:40:17,946
I'll bring my fries.

1270
01:40:18,043 --> 01:40:19,603
If you want.

1271
01:40:20,923 --> 01:40:22,832
My regards to Mr. Fish!

1272
01:40:27,643 --> 01:40:29,683
Actually, no.

1273
01:40:31,803 --> 01:40:34,105
I have no desire
to give up my shop.

1274
01:40:34,203 --> 01:40:35,610
Sorry!

1275
01:40:35,963 --> 01:40:38,963
Make up your mind.
Didn't you say you did?

1276
01:40:39,067 --> 01:40:40,627
Give up my shop?

1277
01:40:40,731 --> 01:40:42,968
On the contrary!

1278
01:40:43,803 --> 01:40:45,526
I'll hire new workers,

1279
01:40:45,627 --> 01:40:47,831
I'll pay my debts,
I'll begin afresh!

1280
01:40:47,932 --> 01:40:50,136
You'll see,
don't you worry!

1281
01:40:50,812 --> 01:40:53,594
I wanted to help you,
out of friendship.

1282
01:40:53,692 --> 01:40:55,099
Oh, yes!

1283
01:40:55,771 --> 01:40:57,397
Out of friendship.

1284
01:40:58,267 --> 01:41:00,122
Friendship is a fine thing,

1285
01:41:01,499 --> 01:41:03,442
and fine friends you are!

1286
01:41:03,547 --> 01:41:07,289
- Or you simply changed your mind?
- I changed my mind

1287
01:41:07,387 --> 01:41:10,038
as soon as I saw her nasty puss
behind you!

1288
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:12,441
You haven't changed!

1289
01:41:13,468 --> 01:41:16,948
You're still the same trash
I spanked at the wash house.

1290
01:41:17,052 --> 01:41:18,939
- Come on.
- You shouldn't have said that.

1291
01:41:19,036 --> 01:41:20,858
I get it now.

1292
01:41:21,532 --> 01:41:23,987
Ever since then,
this is what you wanted,

1293
01:41:24,092 --> 01:41:26,459
with those big innocent eyes!

1294
01:41:26,556 --> 01:41:28,411
You won't get my shop!

1295
01:41:29,404 --> 01:41:30,965
Don't be so proud.

1296
01:41:31,068 --> 01:41:33,207
We know how you bought it,

1297
01:41:33,308 --> 01:41:35,348
with money from a jailbird.

1298
01:41:35,452 --> 01:41:38,136
He's worth more than your cop,

1299
01:41:38,236 --> 01:41:39,643
slut!
- Slut?

1300
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:42,904
And you? How can you talk,
with what goes on here?

1301
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:45,147
Everyone knows.

1302
01:41:46,781 --> 01:41:50,577
- What about you two?
- You're nuts!

1303
01:41:50,685 --> 01:41:54,165
Except everyone
doesn't know about you!

1304
01:41:55,388 --> 01:42:00,058
- Madam, let's go.
- Don't call her "Madam" for my sake!

1305
01:42:00,893 --> 01:42:03,446
Heliotrope seller!

1306
01:42:03,549 --> 01:42:04,956
Get out of my sight!

1307
01:42:05,053 --> 01:42:07,387
- I'm not scared of you.
- You should be!

1308
01:42:08,541 --> 01:42:10,101
You'll end up in prison too!

1309
01:42:10,205 --> 01:42:13,205
Send Fish to arrest me,
because I've got something to tell him!

1310
01:42:13,309 --> 01:42:16,408
- Don't you dare!
- If one spanking wasn't enough,

1311
01:42:17,405 --> 01:42:19,380
I've got another one!

1312
01:42:19,485 --> 01:42:20,892
Piping hot

1313
01:42:20,989 --> 01:42:22,550
and ready to go!

1314
01:42:25,117 --> 01:42:26,677
Get your backside ready!

1315
01:42:26,781 --> 01:42:29,148
Mind your manners!

1316
01:42:40,446 --> 01:42:42,813
It's normal you don't want
Virginie to get your shop.

1317
01:42:43,486 --> 01:42:46,169
- Not that.
- It doesn't matter.

1318
01:42:51,006 --> 01:42:53,111
I don't give a damn
about my shop anymore.

1319
01:42:54,205 --> 01:42:55,133
Your shop?

1320
01:42:57,886 --> 01:43:01,083
- Nothing. Don't tire yourself.
- You're quitting?

1321
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:02,588
Of course not.

1322
01:43:02,686 --> 01:43:05,141
- lt'll work out. You'll see.
- Sure.

1323
01:43:05,822 --> 01:43:07,383
- lt'll work out.
- Careful!

1324
01:43:11,006 --> 01:43:13,373
- Smells like roast pig.
- That's the name for it.

1325
01:43:15,326 --> 01:43:17,846
What a Balthazar's feast.

1326
01:43:19,007 --> 01:43:21,428
Red balls.
It jumps. It flies.

1327
01:43:22,878 --> 01:43:24,766
It jumps.

1328
01:43:24,863 --> 01:43:26,008
All fine.

1329
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:27,998
Lanterns in the trees.

1330
01:43:28,095 --> 01:43:30,550
What? Bastard! Bastard!

1331
01:43:31,231 --> 01:43:33,086
What is it? Calm down!

1332
01:43:33,182 --> 01:43:35,070
Leave me alone!

1333
01:43:41,087 --> 01:43:43,258
Calm down.

1334
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:44,286
Stop!

1335
01:43:45,311 --> 01:43:47,831
Bastard!

1336
01:43:48,734 --> 01:43:50,622
- It's the fever.
- Leave me alone!

1337
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,239
Close your skirts!

1338
01:43:53,343 --> 01:43:54,903
It's you he's after!

1339
01:43:55,007 --> 01:43:56,894
He wants to screw you, this guy!

1340
01:43:56,991 --> 01:43:58,649
- Stupid lout!
- He's dancing.

1341
01:43:58,751 --> 01:44:00,638
He's laughing.

1342
01:44:08,127 --> 01:44:09,687
Look out!

1343
01:44:18,847 --> 01:44:22,011
- Tell Boche to warn the hospital.
- Fetch an ambulance.

1344
01:44:27,487 --> 01:44:29,309
That's brandy! It burns!

1345
01:44:29,407 --> 01:44:31,131
I want water!

1346
01:44:38,688 --> 01:44:40,248
And that's acid!

1347
01:44:44,959 --> 01:44:47,993
Clemence, take that!

1348
01:44:48,095 --> 01:44:50,878
Clemence, you piece of dirt!

1349
01:44:52,991 --> 01:44:54,552
Shirts everywhere!

1350
01:45:02,368 --> 01:45:03,929
Come to bed.

1351
01:45:12,033 --> 01:45:13,593
Your shop!

1352
01:45:13,697 --> 01:45:16,599
I'll take care of your shop, Goujet!

1353
01:45:16,704 --> 01:45:18,526
The shop!

1354
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,917
Look at Goujet's shop!

1355
01:46:10,465 --> 01:46:12,026
Look out!

1356
01:46:42,850 --> 01:46:44,257
Gervaise!

1357
01:48:43,652 --> 01:48:45,539
No, not those.

1358
01:48:45,636 --> 01:48:47,458
Those are better.

1359
01:48:59,813 --> 01:49:01,635
What is it, Nana dear?

1360
01:49:03,269 --> 01:49:04,829
Let me see your hands.

1361
01:49:07,877 --> 01:49:09,437
Disgusting.

1362
01:49:10,117 --> 01:49:13,249
Doesn't your mother clean you?
- Mommy is even dirtier than me.

1363
01:49:15,685 --> 01:49:18,205
Put your hand out. Here.

1364
01:49:20,934 --> 01:49:22,340
Happy?

1365
01:49:23,493 --> 01:49:26,810
- I'd like a ribbon.
- You would?

1366
01:49:31,334 --> 01:49:35,262
Remember when Coupeau died,
you said they'd be better off?

1367
01:49:35,942 --> 01:49:36,924
Take a look.

1368
01:49:38,054 --> 01:49:39,134
Here.

1369
01:49:50,534 --> 01:49:52,738
- Six of Cups.
- The Hermit.

1370
01:49:52,838 --> 01:49:54,398
The Hermit, The Strength.

1371
01:49:55,462 --> 01:49:57,022
The Emperor.

1372
01:49:57,126 --> 01:49:58,532
My turn.

1373
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:00,289
- Knight of Cups.
- Ace!

1374
01:50:04,102 --> 01:50:06,469
- Your turn.
- The Death.

1375
01:50:06,566 --> 01:50:07,972
The Devil.

1376
01:50:11,174 --> 01:50:12,897
I cut with Coins.

1377
01:50:12,998 --> 01:50:14,405
Four of Coins.

1378
01:50:47,175 --> 01:50:50,077
Mommy, some candy.
