1
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:02,680
Morning, Stosh.

2
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,515
- Morning.

3
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,151
Chase Research.

4
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:09,520
- Have
you seen Paul?

5
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,321
- No,
I haven't seen him.

6
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:14,525
- You with the railroad?

7
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:15,593
- No, I'm Maindrian Pace,
I'm with Chase Research,

8
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:16,527
I'm here to investigate
the accident

9
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:17,795
for the insurance company.

10
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:19,564
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:30,775
- Morning, Paul,
what a way to start a day.

12
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:33,311
- Yeah, morning, Pace.

13
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:34,779
- Well, I
always get the biggies.

14
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:36,180
- What
do you got so far?

15
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,282
- Well, not
much, no skid marks.

16
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:40,718
I'm thinking maybe a
possible brake failure.

17
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:42,386
- How's the driver?

18
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:43,654
- Well, he died
en route to the hospital.

19
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:45,890
Looks like we're gonna
lose the brakeman, too.

20
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,325
- What's
your liability?

21
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:48,993
- The whole package.

22
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:50,962
Hope you can find something
mechanically wrong

23
00:01:50,962 --> 00:01:52,296
with that truck.

24
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:53,431
- You know
me, Paul, if it's there

25
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:54,865
I'll find it.

26
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,667
- Do your best.

27
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:58,202
- Stosh, just
get it back to the shop.

28
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,605
Taylor Webb may be buying
another car to switch over.

29
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:02,840
It's about time you
learned the business.

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,976
I'll stay here and make
sure I get all the pieces.

31
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:05,910
I'll see you later.

32
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,811
- All Auto,

33
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:08,512
five 15.

34
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:11,983
B20.

35
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:12,984
96 oh seven.

36
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:15,786
Number 19.

37
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:17,288
Warrens.

38
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:18,122
268-99.

39
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:21,726
Number 22.

40
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,227
Taylor Webb Used cars.

41
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,462
- Yeah.

42
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:25,630
- 333 dollars.

43
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:33,537
- 1973
Challenger, number 22.

44
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:53,157
- Hey, Atlee,
how come you never get called

45
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:54,525
at five o'clock in the morning?

46
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:55,793
- 'Cause I live right.

47
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:57,361
- Well, I'll
fix your living habit.

48
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,629
Tomorrow morning you
can get up at five

49
00:02:58,629 --> 00:02:59,864
and start tearing
down that truck

50
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:01,532
to find out how come
he hit the train.

51
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,100
- Okay, if
Stanley helps me.

52
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,536
I think two years in the
Army gave him brain damage.

53
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:07,905
- Hey, hey, I'll
learn the business next week.

54
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:10,474
I don't even know how
these switch-overs work.

55
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:12,376
- Well Stanley,
it goes like this.

56
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,111
Taylor Webb buys a wrecked car.

57
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,180
We cut it up, and save
the serial numbers,

58
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,649
the engine and trans,
and junk the rest.

59
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:20,451
Then we go out and
steal one identical,

60
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,486
and put these serial
number from the wrecked car

61
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:23,888
on the new one.

62
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:25,256
- Well
don't the police

63
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:27,091
and the insurance
companies check these guys?

64
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,360
- Oh, the odds
about 5,000 to one.

65
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,196
Do you know how many cars are
in Los Angeles County alone?

66
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,631
Over two million.

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,435
- Hey, Stanley,

68
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:38,235
what's your new
girlfriend's name?

69
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:39,870
- Jill, why?

70
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,105
- Gonna
name this car after her,

71
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:42,640
'cause she's a wreck, too.

72
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,375
- Hey, Maindrian, I
need your trunk-locking key.

73
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,643
- Hey,
Stanley, got the mileage?

74
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:49,413
- Yeah, it's
uh, 6891, five tenths.

75
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,719
- Hey, Atlee,
what kind of tires are those?

76
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,754
- They're
Goodyear E7814.

77
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,022
- Two-stripe
or one-stripe?

78
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:59,724
- They're two-stripe.

79
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:01,325
- I'm
going back in the Army.

80
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,626
- I think
that's a good idea.

81
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:04,829
Take Corlis with,
he's in a bad mood.

82
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:06,897
- Ah,
cram it, you guys.

83
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:10,901
- Ah, that's 'cause
his sweetie is in New York.

84
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,984
- Corlis, Why
don't you give me a hand,

85
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:28,586
get those doors over there.

86
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,520
- Do I have to do
everything while I'm here?

87
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,821
- Why you have to--

88
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,324
- Hey, I'm hungry.

89
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,298
- Come on, let's go.

90
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:42,533
- Come on.

91
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,001
- Want this
motor over there now?

92
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,469
- Yeah, let's go Atlee,
Atlee, get the truck in here

93
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:48,205
get this back body section
of these doors loaded.

94
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,642
Now all we gotta do
is go steal her twin.

95
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,879
- Please
lock your car.

96
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,714
Do not leave
articles on the seat.

97
00:04:56,714 --> 00:05:00,084
Do not leave parking
ticket in your car.

98
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,385
Please lock your car.

99
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,220
Do not leave
articles on the seat.

100
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,457
Do not leave parking
ticket in your car.

101
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:08,292
Please lock your car.

102
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,394
Do not leave
articles on the seat.

103
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,730
Do not leave parking
ticket in your car.

104
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:48,365
Please lock your car.

105
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:50,501
Do not leave
articles on the seat.

106
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:54,004
Do not leave parking
ticket in your car.

107
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:55,239
- Hey Atlee,

108
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:57,041
how'd you get mixed
up with Pace, anyway?

109
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,642
- Well, I'll
tell you Stanley,

110
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:00,311
I used to steal trucks,

111
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:02,112
and one day this dude comes in,

112
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,882
he say he's Maindrian Pace
for some insurance company,

113
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:07,585
and he's here to investigate
a truck I bought.

114
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:10,888
Well, he walks around the
truck, opens his briefcase,

115
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:12,656
and right away I see
these pictures of my truck

116
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,124
all wrecked up and stuff.

117
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,860
Then he said, "Mr.
Jackson, do you realize

118
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,929
"you can to jail for stealing,
like you can for lying?"

119
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:22,666
Right then I knew he had
me, but he made me an offer.

120
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:26,637
And here I is, me, Investigator
Jackson, stealing cars,

121
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,138
I still haven't been caught.

122
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,340
- Atlee, when
you came to work for me,

123
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,774
you became a pro.

124
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:33,677
The amateurs are in jail,
professionals never get caught.

125
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:35,145
- What
about Bush Doctor?

126
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,014
He was a pro, over 400
cars and they nailed him.

127
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:38,449
- Well, he got sloppy.

128
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,651
- You don't get
sloppy in this business.

129
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,753
- Jill just
became a statistic.

130
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:44,588
One of the 32 percent
of the cars stolen

131
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:46,824
never to be recovered again.

132
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,393
Holy Christ, I gotta be
in Vilas' in 20 minutes.

133
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:50,661
- Hey, you
want me to come with you?

134
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,962
- No, they
said to come alone.

135
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,231
And for 400,000 dollars,
I'm going alone.

136
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,934
See you guys later, get
this place cleaned up.

137
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,142
- Mr. Pace,
you came highly recommended

138
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:07,545
from our associates
in Argentina.

139
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:09,013
- Thank
you, Mr. Vilas.

140
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:12,650
- Like you asked,
200,000 dollars up front.

141
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,451
This is a lot of money.

142
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:15,853
Those cars must be at the docks

143
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,323
for transfer delivery
Saturday, no later than five.

144
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:20,925
They must be there.

145
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:24,562
Now, I don't need to
tell you the consequences

146
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:26,697
if you fail to perform.

147
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,266
- Don't
worry, Mr. Vilas.

148
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:32,069
- I
don't worry, that's your job.

149
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,571
Saturday, by five.

150
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,978
- Here's a list

151
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:42,947
and the code names of the
cars we're gonna need.

152
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:44,181
What was that black
football player

153
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:45,716
that played for the
Green Bay Packers?

154
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,384
Remember, we handled
loss on his trucks

155
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,619
at the distributing company?

156
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:49,787
- Oh, yeah, you
mean Willie Davis.

157
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,956
- Yeah, that's him, Davis.

158
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:58,529
Yeah, he drives
a burgundy Rolls.

159
00:07:58,529 --> 00:07:59,997
Here's his address.

160
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:01,265
Now I want you to have as
much of this information ready

161
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:03,500
as you can by the time
we get back on Sunday.

162
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,170
Now, here's how we'll handle it.

163
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,740
What are the uh, the
first two are Stutzes.

164
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,242
Let's see, I code named
'em Donna and Karen.

165
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,744
- Yeah.

166
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,579
- But, you'll have to redo
this so we can read it.

167
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,047
- Yeah.

168
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:18,515
- But just go down the line
here and code name 'em.

169
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:20,217
I want all of 'em listed
this way, all the way down.

170
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:21,552
- Okay, I'll put
'em in order, yeah.

171
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:22,920
- Get the rest of this
junk cleaned off here.

172
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,154
- Yeah.

173
00:08:24,154 --> 00:08:26,290
- Also, uh, lemme
see what was it,

174
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,158
oh, I want you to get both
undercover cars serviced

175
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:29,326
and ready to go.

176
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:30,594
- Okay.
- Okay?

177
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,829
And you'll pick us
up at the airport

178
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:32,630
or take us to the
airport at 8:30.

179
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,075
- Here they come!

180
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:04,128
- Hello, this is
the long-distance operator.

181
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,897
Is this the Kosciuszko
Club in Dunkirk, New York?

182
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,299
- Yes, it is.

183
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,067
- I have a
collect person-to-person call

184
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,202
for a Mandrian Pace
from an Atlee Jackson

185
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,871
of Chase Research
in Los Angeles.

186
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:15,873
Will you accept the charges?

187
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:17,341
- Uh, hold
on a moment, operator,

188
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,642
I think he's with
the wedding party.

189
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:19,910
I'll have to find him.

190
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,279
- All
right, I'll hold.

191
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:23,947
- This
is Maindrian Pace.

192
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,149
- Will you
accept a collect call

193
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,750
from an Atlee Jackson?

194
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,018
- Yes,
I will, operator.

195
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:29,153
Atlee, how come you're
calling collect?

196
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:30,454
You in jail or something?

197
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,022
- No, but I
think we all gonna be.

198
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,090
I been going over this list,

199
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,491
And I think you lost your mind.

200
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,760
Do you realize there are
48 cars on this list,

201
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,496
and nine are Rolls
Royce, seven limousines.

202
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,066
They even want Parnelli
Jones' Big Oly Bronco.

203
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,600
Four Ferraris--

204
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,169
- Atlee, Atlee,
what are you trying to say?

205
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,704
- There's
no way we can steal

206
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:48,572
and switch over this
many cars by Friday.

207
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:49,873
- We don't
have to switch 'em,

208
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,442
just clean 'em up, take
off the license plates

209
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:52,910
and deliver them to the docks.

210
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,611
- We're still
gonna need some more help.

211
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:55,946
- Just getting
ready to tell Eugenius

212
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:58,015
to hold off his
honeymoon for a week.

213
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,216
- You gonna tell a boss

214
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:00,484
to wait a week
for his honeymoon?

215
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:01,418
Good luck.

216
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,653
- Listen, Atlee.

217
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:04,054
You just get to work on
those insurance files.

218
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:06,023
I can think of at least
25 cars in those files

219
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,157
right off-hand.

220
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:08,358
And don't worry about Eugene.

221
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,929
You just be at the
airport to pick us up.

222
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:40,457
- Okay, why you
wanna talk to me?

223
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:42,526
- We got a little problem.

224
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:45,562
We have to deliver over 40
cars to the docks by Saturday.

225
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,598
- What do
you want me to do?

226
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:49,133
- I want you to
postpone your honeymoon.

227
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,201
- Hey, I'd like to help
you out, it's my wedding!

228
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,836
- You don't seem to understand.

229
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:56,006
We gotta deliver over 40 cars
to the docks by Saturday.

230
00:10:56,006 --> 00:10:57,474
We've got all our regular work,

231
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,576
plus we got three court
appearances this week.

232
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,811
- That's a sad story.

233
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,045
Why don'tcha call
me up in three weeks

234
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,147
when I get back
from my honeymoon?

235
00:11:03,147 --> 00:11:04,615
- I want you to listen.

236
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:05,716
- You goddamn--
- Hey, hey.

237
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:08,218
- Please, Maindrian, not here.

238
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:10,687
- You might've inherited
most of the shares

239
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:12,122
when your old man died,

240
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:13,724
but your brother and sister
have held up your end,

241
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,893
plus theirs, ever since.

242
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,195
Now it's about
time you shape up.

243
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:22,366
Because the three of
us can vote you out.

244
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:25,169
Pumpkin, I want him on
that plane tomorrow,

245
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:26,170
or he's out.

246
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,808
- Maindrian,
I worry about you

247
00:11:30,808 --> 00:11:32,876
and Eugene, you're
always fighting.

248
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:34,878
- Do me a favor,
let's not talk about him.

249
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,980
Just make sure he's on
that plane tomorrow, okay?

250
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,782
- Hey, I
saw the nicest house,

251
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,384
can we go look at
it when we get back?

252
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:41,685
- Oh boy.

253
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:43,654
- Come on,
you know I love you.

254
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:45,589
Besides that, it was
always Papa's dream

255
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:46,990
that we get married someday.

256
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,258
- I know.

257
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:49,560
- I'm
a good cook, too.

258
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,527
- You
just want me to be fat

259
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:51,795
like all the other Polacks.

260
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,330
- Yeah, then no
one will look at you.

261
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,932
- Hey, we
got a contract to fill.

262
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:56,433
- How about
after the contract?

263
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,901
- We'll talk
about it then, okay?

264
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:58,735
- Promise?

265
00:11:58,735 --> 00:11:59,970
- I promise.

266
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,238
- Look
at the house, too?

267
00:12:01,238 --> 00:12:02,039
- Well,
we'll talk about it.

268
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,240
- Okay.

269
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,448
- Mr. Eugene Chase.

270
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:12,382
- Yeah, right here.

271
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,618
- Hello, Mr. Chase.

272
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,860
- Atlee, Atlee!

273
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,497
Old blue eyes is back.

274
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:27,898
Hey, you been workin' hard?

275
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:29,533
- Hi,
Atlee, how ya doin'?

276
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,269
- Just can't trust
nobody, Atlee.

277
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,107
- Hey, thanks for coming by

278
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:38,041
but actually I'm going.

279
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:38,775
We got lots of work to do.

280
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:39,610
- You do?

281
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,444
- Yeah.

282
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:00,130
Hey, I want you
to go with Jenny.

283
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,665
- Okay.

284
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:04,101
Bye bye!
- Bye!

285
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:06,236
- Go with Jenny and help
her get settled down.

286
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:07,638
- Okay, fine.

287
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:09,606
- You get everything ready?

288
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:10,641
- Hold everything,
hold everything.

289
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:11,975
There's Eleanor.

290
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,378
Get the briefcase.

291
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,813
- Let me do it,
my knack is back.

292
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,049
I can feel it in my bones,
just let me handle it.

293
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,617
- You'll handle it.

294
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:22,486
Okay.

295
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:39,870
- Left the key in the car.

296
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,704
- Really?

297
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:43,140
Stosh?

298
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:47,711
Okay, Stosh, let's go.

299
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:04,695
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

300
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:07,364
May the Lord be with you, child.

301
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,339
- What in the world?

302
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:18,575
- Sorry, lady, I
thought it was my car.

303
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,277
Wrong car!

304
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,082
Pretty damn funny.

305
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:28,051
You said I'd be picking my
ass up off the sidewalk.

306
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:32,622
- Don't
worry, Corlis,

307
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,491
I got Eleanor's license number.

308
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:36,994
Come on, Atlee, let's take
a ride around the airport.

309
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:39,563
Gotta go to work now.

310
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,435
- Lucky.

311
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:47,104
- All right, pay up.

312
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,740
- Bet you
can't do it again.

313
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,774
- Double or nothing?

314
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:51,975
- You're on.

315
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:52,909
- Game's
over, let's go.

316
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,444
- Easy money.

317
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:56,013
- I don't wanna sound
like a drill sergeant,

318
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:58,315
but this is the biggest
contract we've ever handled.

319
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,018
I don't want any mistakes,
so pay attention.

320
00:15:01,018 --> 00:15:02,586
- Doesn't he look good
with his gray hair?

321
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,388
- Ah, he looks like a Polack.

322
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,089
- At least my mother
didn't name me Atlee.

323
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,593
Atlee, you've been with
us for three years,

324
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:11,061
and you're about
as good as I am.

325
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,796
There's Corlis's wig, we're
gonna do this different.

326
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,297
You're gonna be
working with Corlis.

327
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:15,999
Stosh, you're coming
off shop detail,

328
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,734
and you're gonna
learn all about it.

329
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:19,970
Here's a list of the code names.

330
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,239
I want you to look at
'em, study 'em carefully,

331
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,774
and get to know 'em.

332
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:24,675
That's the only way you're
gonna refer to these cars

333
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:26,143
from the day on.

334
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:27,611
Pumpkin, I want you to
get on this list of cars,

335
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,247
check 'em all out, see if the
addresses are all current.

336
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,616
And I want you
using only the phone

337
00:15:32,616 --> 00:15:34,484
that Atlee here has got
tied in to the switchboard

338
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:35,419
next door.

339
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:36,686
- Now, Maindrian, remember

340
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,688
we're only going after
cars that are insured.

341
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,123
- Right, if you guys
have any questions

342
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:42,626
just have Pumpkin
run a 10-28 on them.

343
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:43,860
If there's a legal indicated,

344
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,329
that means they're
usually insured.

345
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:47,564
I know it's been a long day

346
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,666
but we got some
easy hits tonight.

347
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,168
I've got the DMV info on Eleanor

348
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:52,969
and she lives over in Torrance.

349
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:54,471
- I found the Italia.

350
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:56,406
I remember seeing this
picture of Lyle Waggoner

351
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:57,941
in Playgirl magazine.

352
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:59,376
- You got any more?

353
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,411
- Yeah, we can get Parnelli
Jones' Big Oly Bronco,

354
00:16:01,411 --> 00:16:03,313
it'd be on display
at the racing today.

355
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:04,881
- Good, you
and Corlis handle it.

356
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:05,816
- Okay.

357
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,317
- Now one more thing, you guys.

358
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:09,986
All the personal effects
go into duffel bags

359
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:11,221
that go to the shredder.

360
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,956
We don't wanna keep any
cameras, typewriters,

361
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:14,691
all that stuff can be traced.

362
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:17,227
Now there are some new
additions to the briefcases.

363
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,129
Make sure the walkie-talkies
are always on.

364
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:20,797
Same for the police
radios in your cars.

365
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:24,067
That'll keep you on top
of things and outta jail.

366
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,136
Now this is our new
compact key cutter.

367
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:27,571
Take a look at that, Atlee.

368
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,207
- Oh, yeah, I'll
brief Corlis on this.

369
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,675
- Pumpkin, I want you to get

370
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:33,410
as many of the code numbers
for the keys as you can.

371
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,778
That'll keep us
from popping locks,

372
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:36,413
especially the foreign cars.

373
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,247
Any questions?

374
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,482
- Nope.

375
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:40,383
Good. Let's go to work.

376
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:48,859
Okay, Atlee, go by and
pick up Corlis, huh?

377
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:49,793
- Yeah, I'll go get him.

378
00:16:49,793 --> 00:16:50,694
- Okay, meet here.

379
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:51,962
- Yeah.

380
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,398
- Atlee,
don't take any chances,

381
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:56,967
check on all your equipment.

382
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,769
- I'm not a Polack.

383
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,771
- Let's go, Stosh.

384
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,707
Damn, tired of this.

385
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,979
Make sure you always have
your walkie-talkie on,

386
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:11,014
and there's your, your squelch.

387
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:12,415
- Okay?
-  - Okay.

388
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:13,683
Okay, let's go.

389
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:24,528
- Annual Grand
Prix, 23rd running of this

390
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:27,297
national championship
event for the

391
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,233
United States Auto
Club division.

392
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:32,502
Tonight we will be pitting
some of the fine driving talent

393
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:35,505
of the United States
Auto Club organization

394
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:36,673
against some of our very fine

395
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:39,843
local Southern
California drivers.

396
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:41,578
We have a fine
variety of automobiles

397
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:42,812
in attendance here tonight.

398
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,015
We have Sesco Chevys,
Offenhausers, and

399
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:46,349
Mighty Mite Vws.

400
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:11,474
Moving down to trackside

401
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:13,410
for this evening's
trophy presentation

402
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,178
to our featured winner,

403
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,014
a gentleman whose name is
synonymous in automobile racing

404
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,084
here in the Southern
California area,

405
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:25,121
championship car owner
of the Indianapolis 500

406
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:29,125
for the past 26 years, your
host here at Ascot Park,

407
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,529
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. J.C. Agajanian.

408
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:53,049
- - Harold?

409
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:53,883
Harold!

410
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:56,119
- What?

411
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:59,356
- The dog's in the house again.

412
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:00,824
- That's all right, he--

413
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:02,359
- Will you get the dog
out of the house, Harold?

414
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,193
Your dog!

415
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:04,394
Take him out.

416
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,197
- Take him, take
him out, nag woman.

417
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:17,774
- He brought mud in last night.

418
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:20,076
I'm sick of the dog
in the house, Harold.

419
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,578
- Ah, you're crazy.

420
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,013
You're absolutely nuts.

421
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:24,347
- Tomorrow morning
this thing's gonna be--

422
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:26,516
- Stay out there with him.

423
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,654
I'm sick of your dog, Harold.

424
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:34,257
- Ah, crazy women, they're
all nuts, every one.

425
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,659
- Don't slam the door!

426
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,596
- Come on, walk.

427
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,430
Walk.

428
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:50,907
Hey, hey, hey!

429
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:52,142
Fella, that's my car!

430
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:54,010
That's my car!

431
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,912
Son of a bitch!

432
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,852
Steal my car, I'll show ya!

433
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:26,109
- Hey, you kids,
get the cars outta the street!

434
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:27,377
- Drive
around the block.

435
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:28,912
- Yeah,
go up the sidewalk.

436
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,613
- You're
stealing my car!

437
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,048
- Hey, Smith,
too bad he didn't just

438
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:34,617
steal your old lady
and your stupid dog!

439
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,485
- WJ 90,

440
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:09,753
I'm in pursuit of a
blue Plymouth two-door

441
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:11,721
southbound Crenshaw, from 186.

442
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:14,758
License unknown,
one male occupant.

443
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:17,026
- 10-four,
all units stand by.

444
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,662
WJ-90 in pursuit of a
blue Plymouth two-door

445
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:21,765
southbound Crenshaw, from 186.

446
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:24,000
One male occupant,
license unknown.

447
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,635
- Really
bowled a terrific game.

448
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:27,137
I hope she gets in our league,

449
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:29,005
I think that she is really good.

450
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:30,807
- Oh, I know it.

451
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:33,810
- Look out!

452
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:39,282
- WJ-90, suspect
vehicle involved in TA

453
00:21:39,282 --> 00:21:41,584
at Crenshaw and 210th Street.

454
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:44,888
Suspect's still southbound
on Crenshaw towards the bowl.

455
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,289
- 10-4
all units in the area

456
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:48,057
to Crenshaw and
two-one-O Street,

457
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,661
a blue Plymouth is southbound,
with a TA at that location.

458
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:55,265
- WJ-seven, we
have spotted suspect vehicle.

459
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:56,633
At the bath ramp.

460
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:59,002
He just turned
south on Van Ness.

461
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:15,685
- Not me!
They've got my car!

462
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:18,988
No, no, no, hey, fellas,
I didn't do anything.

463
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:22,058
The guy took my goddamn car.

464
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:23,259
- Why don't
you break his arm?

465
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,462
- No, you're
making a mistake.

466
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:27,864
Oh, guys, they have
my car, running down

467
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,937
Look for my car, yellow
Mustang down there.

468
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,339
- WJ-seven,
request assistance.

469
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:39,442
To Vanness, possible major 4-15.

470
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,578
Suspect in custody.

471
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:43,713
- WJ-seven
requests backup

472
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:46,382
to possible major
4-15 at Midtown.

473
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:48,017
- WJ-seven,
our ETA three seconds.

474
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:53,990
- WK-nine,
give town report.

475
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:03,132
- This is the fella who
was driving the other car.

476
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,501
- Well,
they made it all right,

477
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:06,503
got out of it pretty good.

478
00:23:06,503 --> 00:23:09,239
See what's you caused now?

479
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:11,140
- He says his car was stolen
and he was chasing it,

480
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,976
we'll go back and check it out.

481
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,244
- Yeah,
that sounds good.

482
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:15,745
- Okay.

483
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:16,846
- I'll take
care of everything here.

484
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:23,953
- Mr. Smith,

485
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:25,688
is that your yellow Mustang
with the black trim?

486
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:27,757
- What the
hell's my car doing here?

487
00:23:27,757 --> 00:23:30,860
Honest, fellas, that
guy, he was in it,

488
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,495
he took it and he
went out that way.

489
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,831
The big, a guy dressed
in black, honest.

490
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,332
I mean I, what the
hell was I doing out,

491
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:40,003
driving around in my pajamas,
I was out walking my dog.

492
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:43,406
- AK-seven, taking
19-50 to Harbor Division,

493
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:44,908
231 on 2A booking.

494
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:48,945
- Copy,
AK-seven, 10-4.

495
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:54,450
- Why don't you knock?

496
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,922
Damn.

497
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:00,189
- I closed the
door, what do you want?

498
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,357
- Where were
you raised, in a barn?

499
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,660
- What do you want?

500
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,564
- What's this I hear about
you giving a car back?

501
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:08,765
- You called me
in here for that?

502
00:24:08,765 --> 00:24:10,400
- Yeah, Mr. Bigshot.

503
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,467
- That's why.

504
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,504
- So what?

505
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:16,206
- I didn't connect the two
until I found that card

506
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,740
on the sun visor.

507
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,544
"H.D. Smith" is none other
than Harold Dwight Smith.

508
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,947
Senior Claims Supervisor
and head idiot

509
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:25,848
for the Kenden
Insurance company.

510
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:27,817
- What difference
does that make?

511
00:24:27,817 --> 00:24:28,985
- He's denied more claims

512
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:31,220
and screwed more
people than you have.

513
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,723
And I wanna see him get
his ass outta this one.

514
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,125
- J and I wanna
go on our honeymoon.

515
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,860
- The bulletin board says
you're supposed to be in court

516
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,397
in 20 minutes, or are
you on your period again?

517
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,566
- One of these days, Pace.

518
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:48,605
- Yes, yes, he passed away
this morning in Santa Barbara.

519
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:49,906
Of course we would
like very much

520
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:52,642
for you folks to take
care of things for us.

521
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:55,278
- All right, Mrs. Weatherton.

522
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,082
That's 3700 Artesia
Boulevard, apartment four,

523
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:02,418
that's upstairs in the rear.

524
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,920
- That's right.

525
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,489
- Fine, will there be more
than yourself coming in

526
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:07,724
for the arrangements?

527
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:09,959
- Yes, there are several
members in the family

528
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:12,495
and a limousine would be needed.

529
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:13,963
- There will.

530
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:16,399
Okay, fine, then we'll send our
limousine right out for you.

531
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:19,002
- All right, we appreciate it.

532
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:21,137
- Thank
you very much.

533
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:22,138
- Thank you.

534
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,477
That's right, it'll
be in the lobby

535
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:31,414
of the Laguna Riveria
building, 2206 Ocean Boulevard,

536
00:25:31,414 --> 00:25:32,649
in Long Beach.

537
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:34,784
Yes, at 2 P.M. this afternoon.

538
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,119
There will be a party of six

539
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,855
going to the convention
center in Anaheim.

540
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:40,657
Hello, yes, I would
like a limousine

541
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:44,827
to pick up a party of five
at 1:30 this afternoon.

542
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:48,564
They'll be going to the airport

543
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:53,403
and the address they need to
be picked up is 8253 Artesia.

544
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:57,040
All right then,
thank you very much.

545
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,275
Hello, this is Haynes
and Purcell Realtors.

546
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,344
I would like a limousine
to pick up Mrs. Haynes

547
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,114
and her party at the
Tijuana Cafe in Gardena.

548
00:26:05,114 --> 00:26:08,384
And would you please be there
at three o'clock prompt?

549
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:09,218
Thank you.

550
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,379
- This working
is ruining my sex life.

551
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:38,014
- Who would
have sex with you anyway?

552
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,415
- Nobody you
know, that's for su...

553
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:40,850
Will ya look at that?

554
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,385
- Hey, I
think I'm in love.

555
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:43,786
- I'm talking
about the car, Stanley.

556
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:46,622
10 to one she left
the keys in it.

557
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,539
You know, Stanley,
I'm gettin' tired

558
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,907
of stealing this Eleanor car.

559
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:06,409
- Yeah,
but just think,

560
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:09,579
some Venezuelan general's
son is just waiting for her.

561
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:10,546
- This
time I've got her.

562
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,715
She's about to go bye-bye.

563
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:06,729
- No, baby, I promise ya.

564
00:29:06,729 --> 00:29:09,498
We'll be in London by
this time next week.

565
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:12,501
I love you too,
okay, bye-bye honey.

566
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,838
You blew it this time.

567
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:18,875
- What's wrong today, Eugene?

568
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,309
- We've been asked

569
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:22,078
to investigate Taylor Webb
Used Cars, that's what's wrong.

570
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:23,346
The adjustor that
handled that total loss

571
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:25,114
on that Challenger you did?

572
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:26,315
Well, he drove by his car lot,

573
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:27,817
and saw that darned
thing sitting out there

574
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:29,652
and recognized the
license number.

575
00:29:29,652 --> 00:29:31,854
Now he wanna ask to find out
how come that basket case

576
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:36,058
that he bought five days
ago is back out on the road.

577
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:37,927
- Well, I'll tell
you what to do.

578
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:39,128
- What's that?

579
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:40,930
- Why don't you just
investigate Taylor Webb

580
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,365
in your usual manner,

581
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:45,301
and by the time you get around
to it, it'll be history.

582
00:29:45,301 --> 00:29:47,069
- Maindrian, be serious.

583
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:48,905
- How can I, in this nuthouse?

584
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:51,207
Eugene, Pumpkin called
me earlier and told me

585
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,909
that Jill was sick.

586
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:54,944
I called Taylor Webb,
and he wholesaled it

587
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:56,712
to Prince Chrysler
Plymouth today.

588
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,448
Don't worry, I'll have the
fairy godmother take care of it.

589
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:00,917
- Maindrian.

590
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:04,687
- Don't anybody worry,
by morning it'll be gone.

591
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:51,434
- KV-L, four seven two.

592
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:56,639
- One nine four.

593
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:59,208
- KV-L, this is K9-five.

594
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:01,210
I'm at Prince Chrysler,

595
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,979
there's a tow truck
hooking up to a car,

596
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:05,014
I'm gonna check it out.

597
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:07,850
- One
nine four, 10-4.

598
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:34,296
- You son of a bitch!

599
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:17,099
- Chase Research?

600
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,601
- Hello,
Pumpkin, did you call me?

601
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:20,169
- Yeah, Maindrian, we have
a meeting this afternoon

602
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:22,037
at two o'clock
with Parnelli Jones

603
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,539
and the insurance company,

604
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,541
about his Big Oly Bronco
that was stolen yesterday.

605
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,309
- Oh, you mean Janet, yeah.

606
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:28,944
Yeah, I think I
better handle that.

607
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:30,412
- All right, it's all set then.

608
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:31,614
- Let's go, Stosh.

609
00:35:31,614 --> 00:35:33,582
I gotta go investigate a theft.

610
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:35,784
Somebody stole Parnelli
Jones's Big Oly Bronco

611
00:35:35,784 --> 00:35:37,319
and I think it was Atlee.

612
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:38,954
- I hope it was Atlee.

613
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:40,256
- Hey, Stosh,
lookit, three o'clock,

614
00:35:40,256 --> 00:35:41,924
the dude with the goatee.

615
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:43,158
Another Eleanor.

616
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:44,093
- When
you don't need 'em,

617
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:45,594
they're all over the place.

618
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:47,029
- Yeah, she's
sure been a lot of trouble,

619
00:35:47,029 --> 00:35:49,999
right, because she's the
last of the Mustangs.

620
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,433
- Sure
is a pretty color.

621
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,068
- Yeah, sure is.

622
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,336
She lives at the
International Towers,

623
00:35:54,336 --> 00:35:55,804
we'll have to keep her in mind.

624
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:59,441
Never know when you might
need another Eleanor.

625
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:09,818
Hello.

626
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:12,955
- Hello, Pace,
you're right on time.

627
00:36:12,955 --> 00:36:13,889
- You look a little tired.

628
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:15,190
- Oh I'm nervous and upset.

629
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,358
- What's the matter?

630
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:17,660
- Well it all
started Sunday night

631
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,596
when J.C. Agajanian's
Rolls Royce was stolen.

632
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,165
And yesterday four more
expensive cars we insured

633
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:24,300
were stolen.

634
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,601
If they're not recovered
within 30 days,

635
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,237
we stand to lose
150,000 dollars.

636
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:29,505
- You know I read about that,

637
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:30,472
J.C.'s car was at
Ascot, wasn't it?

638
00:36:30,472 --> 00:36:32,641
- Yes, but here's the clincher.

639
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:33,909
Last night,

640
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:36,011
someone stole Parnelli
Jones's Big Oly Bronco

641
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:38,247
which we insure for
100,000 dollars.

642
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:39,915
And, if it's not recovered

643
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:41,950
within 15 days before the race,

644
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,987
we stand to lose a
quarter of a million.

645
00:36:44,987 --> 00:36:47,323
- I'll bet the odds against
that are one in 10,000.

646
00:36:47,323 --> 00:36:48,824
- One in 22,000.

647
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:50,793
- I'll bet underwriting
is just delighted.

648
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:51,927
- Gentlemen.
-  - Yes.

649
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:52,761
- Mr. Jones can see you now.

650
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,363
- Thank you.

651
00:36:54,363 --> 00:36:55,831
- Parnelli, nice seeing you.

652
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:57,032
- Yeah, see you later Bob.
-  - See you again.

653
00:36:57,032 --> 00:36:58,467
- Okay, bye Lisa.

654
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,769
- Much luck at Indy.
-  - Lisa.

655
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:03,339
- Mr. Jones, I'm Frank Acrino
from your insurance company

656
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:05,107
and I talked to you earlier.

657
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:07,643
This is Mr. Maindrian
Pace, with Chase Research.

658
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,111
- Pleasure.

659
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:13,415
I understand if anybody can
find my Bronco, you can.

660
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:14,650
- Thank you.

661
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,151
What can you tell
us about the theft?

662
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:19,254
- We definitely think it
was done by professionals.

663
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:21,724
The police just couldn't
find anything, and--

664
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:23,759
- Are you sure it was stolen,
I mean, not just misplaced

665
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:26,161
or left in one of the
trucks or something?

666
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,465
- Well, I'm sure that
it wasn't misplaced.

667
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:31,400
- Is this a
picture of it here on the wall?

668
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,635
- Yes, as a matter of fact
that was taken last year

669
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:35,070
down in Mexico.

670
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,373
- Can we see the area where
the Bronco was stolen?

671
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:39,775
- Sure, right this way.

672
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:41,210
- Well, they
definitely couldn't drive it

673
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,011
or put it on the street
or anything like that.

674
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,714
- Well it is
one of a kind, and uh,

675
00:37:45,714 --> 00:37:47,649
I'd really like to have it back.

676
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:48,851
- Well, we'll
do everything we can

677
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:50,285
to get it back
for you, Parnelli.

678
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:52,187
Tell me, Frank, does your
company have an insurance policy

679
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,355
on these too?

680
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,724
- Yes x

681
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:58,761
to the tune of 8
million dollars.

682
00:37:58,761 --> 00:37:59,962
- Oh, it
isn't that bad, Frank,

683
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:01,897
it's all your imagination.

684
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:04,233
You shouldn't let little
things like that bother you.

685
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:07,169
- Right here's where
the Bronco was stolen from.

686
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:09,104
- Well it's
definitely not there now.

687
00:38:09,104 --> 00:38:10,606
- Excuse me, Parnelli, but
Jim Cook is on the line.

688
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:12,374
- Okay, I'll just
take it down here.

689
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:13,909
- Okay.

690
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:16,678
- Excuse me, gentlemen, but
uh, just get my Bronco back.

691
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:18,981
- If we can't find it, Frank's
company will just have to

692
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:20,682
pay your 350,000 dollars.

693
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:22,284
- Well I'd rather
have my Bronco back.

694
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:23,719
- We'll do our best.

695
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,921
- I'll drop by the police
department, pick up the report,

696
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:27,456
and have it in your
office right away.

697
00:38:27,456 --> 00:38:29,391
- Okay, Frank, I got work
to do, I'll see ya later.

698
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,225
- Bye.

699
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:46,909
- I'm here for
Lyle Waggoner's car.

700
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,143
- What, man?

701
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:49,411
- I'm here for
Lyle Waggoner's car.

702
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,380
- What?
Oh, wait a minute.

703
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,614
What'd you say?

704
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:53,649
- I'm here for
Lyle Waggoner's car.

705
00:38:53,649 --> 00:38:54,883
- But the car's not ready, man.

706
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:56,151
- But I gotta go,
he's in a hurry.

707
00:38:56,151 --> 00:38:57,352
- You're not Lyle
Waggoner, either.

708
00:38:57,352 --> 00:38:58,020
- I know.
-  - He's a lot taller

709
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,521
than you are.

710
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:00,856
- I know, I'm just
here to pick his car up.

711
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:01,523
- Oh, I, well--
- I really gotta go.

712
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:02,991
He's in a hurry.

713
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:03,792
- The thing is, man, we
haven't had time to wax it.

714
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:04,593
- This is good enough.

715
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,028
- But that's a bummer,

716
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:07,262
you're taking it when
we're not finished the job.

717
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,063
- Yeah but
he's in a hurry.

718
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:09,298
- It's not even ready.

719
00:39:09,298 --> 00:39:11,633
- I gotta
go, I gotta go.

720
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:21,477
- Hey, where's
Lyle Waggoner's car goin', man?

721
00:39:21,477 --> 00:39:23,445
- Oh, man, it just
uh, you guys are...

722
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,347
- No, I just saw some
guy drive Lyle's car.

723
00:39:25,347 --> 00:39:27,049
Now I'm here to pick it up,
now where the hell did it go?

724
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:29,017
- Hey, no, wait a minute,
he doesn't have a beard.

725
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:30,519
- No, I'm not Lyle
Waggoner, man.

726
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:32,554
I am here to pick his car
up, now where did it go?

727
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:35,090
- Uh, uh, you got a breath mint?

728
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,025
- Lemme ask you one question.

729
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:38,827
Got your insurance
policy paid up?

730
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:40,562
- You got any uppers?

731
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:47,169
- Okay,
stand by and cover.

732
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,374
- Good
afternoon, upstairs gallery.

733
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:53,909
- Hello,
this is Eileen Bates

734
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:57,246
with Studson Owner Cars, does
Mr. Simon still own his Studs?

735
00:39:57,246 --> 00:39:59,815
I'm calling to see if he's
pleased with the performance

736
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:00,983
of the automobile.

737
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:01,917
- He certainly is,

738
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,452
he drives it to work every day.

739
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:05,020
- Very good,
that's what I like to hear.

740
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:06,788
Thank you very much.

741
00:40:06,788 --> 00:40:08,056
- Glad to help.

742
00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:11,393
- Bye bye.
-  - Goodbye.

743
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:53,235
- I still say we're lucky.

744
00:40:53,235 --> 00:40:54,937
- Pumpkin sent a letter
to the insurance company,

745
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:56,972
telling them that Taylor
Webb was not in possession

746
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:58,240
of the car and we
couldn't locate--

747
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,174
- We only have
Taylor Webb's car--

748
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:01,410
- Just lay off of me, huh?

749
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:05,881
- Pace, he's
here, open the gate.

750
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:07,849
- I don't suppose you'd
open the damn door?

751
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:08,784
- No way.

752
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:10,819
- Here, hold this.

753
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:12,788
- What do you want me to
do with this darned thing?

754
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:15,023
- Shove it up your doo-bob!

755
00:41:22,664 --> 00:41:24,099
- How do
I look in this one?

756
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:25,834
- Like a
Polack, where's your wig?

757
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:27,202
- It itches.

758
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:28,670
- I'll itch ya,

759
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,741
get this damned thing in
there and get it cleaned up.

760
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:35,644
- Atlee,
get the trunk.

761
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:38,080
- Oh, this
is loaded with junk,

762
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,582
better bring the uh
duffel bags over.

763
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,451
- Come on, let's
get this cleaned up today, huh?

764
00:41:42,451 --> 00:41:43,285
Let's go.

765
00:41:43,285 --> 00:41:44,519
- Here you are.

766
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:46,021
- Thanks.

767
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:47,923
Hey, look at the
junk in this car.

768
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,191
- Yeah.

769
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:51,927
- Work,
work, work, work.

770
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:56,498
Holy shit!

771
00:41:59,835 --> 00:42:01,670
- Hey, let's see that.

772
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,174
Heroin.

773
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:07,009
- You're kidding.

774
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:07,976
- No shit.

775
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:09,611
- Lemme see that.

776
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,881
- Goddamn, we're
rich, we're really rich.

777
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:14,149
Look at all this.

778
00:42:14,149 --> 00:42:15,651
- What the
hell is going on here?

779
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:17,185
- How much you
think this stuff is worth?

780
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:18,787
- Yeah, there must
be a million bucks' worth.

781
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,055
- Think
we could peddle it?

782
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:21,056
- Oh, you can
always get rid of it.

783
00:42:21,056 --> 00:42:23,392
- Oh, damn.

784
00:42:23,392 --> 00:42:24,960
- Atlee, where'd
you get this piece?

785
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,095
- I picked it up on Vermont
in front of a poker parlor.

786
00:42:27,095 --> 00:42:28,263
- Well take it back.

787
00:42:28,263 --> 00:42:29,364
- What do you
mean, take it back?

788
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:31,166
- You heard me, take it back.

789
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,535
- I'll
take care of that!

790
00:42:36,772 --> 00:42:37,606
- Who is it?

791
00:42:37,606 --> 00:42:38,540
- Police!

792
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,809
- Whole damn thing's loaded.

793
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,323
- In a second!

794
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:06,168
Oh, it's you, Hawkins.

795
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:07,803
- Working nights
now, eh, Vicinski?

796
00:43:07,803 --> 00:43:10,939
- You know how it is.
-  - I know how it is.

797
00:43:10,939 --> 00:43:11,907
Gentlemen!

798
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:12,841
- Hi, Hawkins.

799
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:13,675
- Hi Atlee.

800
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:14,776
- Hi, Sarge.

801
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:15,711
- Evening, Eugene.

802
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:17,212
- Hey, how you doing, Hawkins?

803
00:43:17,212 --> 00:43:19,314
- Come on, you
guys, let's get to work.

804
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:20,449
What's up, Hawkins?

805
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:22,117
- The shit's really in the fan.

806
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:23,819
Leiutenant's really
on my ass this time.

807
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:26,154
Figures, you're too
hard on me, Pace.

808
00:43:26,154 --> 00:43:27,389
- Hey boss.

809
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:28,657
- Atlee, just get to
work on the Pinto.

810
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:29,591
- What's this?

811
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:30,425
- Cadillac.

812
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:31,460
- What's wrong with it?

813
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,729
- Oh, it's uh, theft recovery.

814
00:43:33,729 --> 00:43:35,163
- Mm, nice.

815
00:43:35,163 --> 00:43:36,398
- Like that, uh?

816
00:43:36,398 --> 00:43:37,799
What are you doing out
this late at night?

817
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:38,967
- I just finished
taking a report

818
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:41,269
down at Whittle Sea Motors.

819
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:42,871
Seems someone
ripped off a Manta.

820
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,306
- What's a Manta?

821
00:43:44,306 --> 00:43:45,774
- It's the
35th expensive car stolen

822
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:47,275
in three days.

823
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:48,543
You heard about
that, didn't you?

824
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,678
- Listen, all I hear

825
00:43:49,678 --> 00:43:50,912
is the insurance
company screaming at us

826
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:53,548
every time they
lose a lousy dime.

827
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,150
- Maindrian!

828
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,318
- Mm, comfort.

829
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:04,893
- Why
don't you back this up

830
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:06,394
so Eugene can get in
the office there, yeah.

831
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,696
- Yeah sure.
- Would ya?

832
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:09,898
- Yeah.
-  - Thanks.

833
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:15,737
All right!

834
00:44:16,638 --> 00:44:17,806
- That's good.

835
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:28,183
- Mm, I've been
working too hard.

836
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:30,819
Look, do me a favor and keep
your ears open for me, will ya?

837
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:31,753
- Sure, Hawkins.

838
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,221
- You know something, Vicinski?

839
00:44:33,221 --> 00:44:35,023
There's probably been
five more cars stolen

840
00:44:35,023 --> 00:44:36,691
in just the time I've been here.

841
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,827
- Nah, I don't
think so, Hawkins.

842
00:44:38,827 --> 00:44:39,728
Good night.

843
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:46,067
- Goddamn, are we lucky.

844
00:44:49,004 --> 00:44:50,839
- Look, I say we peddle
the stuff right now!

845
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:51,773
- We'll talk about
it in the morning.

846
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:53,041
- No, we're gonna talk about--

847
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:56,178
- We'll talk about
it in the morning.

848
00:46:22,664 --> 00:46:25,267
- Maindrian, we have
to give Eleanor back.

849
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:27,369
- What are you talking
about, the contract's filled.

850
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:31,539
- She's not insured,
here, look for yourself.

851
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,508
- You've gotta be kidding.

852
00:46:33,508 --> 00:46:36,111
"Owner desperate, '73
Ford Mustang stolen

853

Pumpkin, I'm tired.

I'm not Superman.

858

Look at that.

859
00:46:47,822 --> 00:46:49,157
That contract is filled.

860
00:46:49,157 --> 00:46:50,158
- Maindrian.

861
00:46:51,026 --> 00:46:51,860
- Damn you, Pace!

862
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,395
Where's the El Dorado?

863
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:54,896
- It's gone, Eugene.

864
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,731
- What'd you do
with it, you son of bitch?

865
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,466
- I burned it.

866
00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:01,870
- You burned a million
dollars worth of heroin?

867
00:47:05,473 --> 00:47:06,508
- I'm gonna give Eleanor back,

868
00:47:06,508 --> 00:47:07,609
but only because of one reason.

869
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:08,843
I know where there's another

870
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:11,579

Towers of Long Beach.

871
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:12,614
Get 'em cleaned up!

872
00:47:12,614 --> 00:47:13,915
- Maindrian.

873
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:17,852
- We go out
and we do the impossible,

874
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:20,555
steal 48 cars, get 'em to the
warehouse with hours to spare,

875
00:47:20,555 --> 00:47:23,024
and only Eleanor gives
us all the trouble.

876
00:47:23,024 --> 00:47:26,061
- Do we really have
to put her back on the street?

877
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:28,029
- Yeah,
I promised Pumpkin.

878
00:47:28,029 --> 00:47:29,631
Hell, if we're lucky
the one we saw yesterday

879
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:31,700
may still be at the
International Towers.

880
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,234
- Light your
cigar and calm down,

881
00:47:33,234 --> 00:47:35,203
before you bite the end off.

882
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:41,449
- Let me
speak to Sergeant Hawkins.

883
00:51:44,152 --> 00:51:45,687
- Hawkins.

884
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:46,654
- You wanna
catch that car-theft ring

885
00:51:46,654 --> 00:51:47,956
that's been bothering you?

886
00:51:47,956 --> 00:51:48,856
Well, put a stake-out at
the International Towers

887
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,058
in Long Beach.

888
00:51:50,058 --> 00:51:51,226
- Who is this?

889
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:00,301
- That'll fix you, Mr. Bigshot.

890
00:52:53,388 --> 00:52:55,156
- Man, I got to hit the head.

891
00:52:55,156 --> 00:52:57,725
How long before our
shift relief get here?

892
00:52:57,725 --> 00:53:01,663

and we're all through.

- Soon as I find out
if Eleanor is here

896
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:25,620
I'll give you a call
and you can take off.

897
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,587

Nothing on it.

What do you think,
think he's our dude?

905
00:53:57,852 --> 00:54:00,955
- Ah, probably a
salesman, let's wait.

906
00:54:34,756 --> 00:54:35,990
- There's
your salesman.

907
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,359
Sounds like he forgot
about his alarm system.

908
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:40,695
- Could be he didn't know
the car had one on it.

909
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:43,698
Pull around to the corner,
we'll run some film on it.

921
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,275
- I
think that we have

922
00:57:07,275 --> 00:57:08,709
a large police chase going on,

923
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:09,977

- Good afternoon,
I'm Darryl Forrest,

1120
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:07,267
here with Mayor Sak Yamamoto
of the city of Carson

1121
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:09,302
for the groundbreaking
ceremonies

1122
01:18:09,302 --> 01:18:12,071
of the new sheriff's station
being built here in Carson.

1123
01:18:12,071 --> 01:18:14,274
In February of 1968,

1124
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,576
the city of Carson was
incorporated and since then

1125
01:18:16,576 --> 01:18:19,379
it has grown to be one of
the fastest-growing cities

1126
01:18:19,379 --> 01:18:21,347
in the Southern California area,

1127
01:18:21,347 --> 01:18:23,817
with a population of over 82,000

1128
01:18:23,817 --> 01:18:27,353
and an assessed valuation of
nearly 350 million dollars

1129
01:18:27,353 --> 01:18:29,622
and no property taxes.

1130
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:31,124
Mayor, how does the city feel

1131
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:34,460
about the new sheriff's station
being built here in Carson?

1132
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,729
- We really all feel
that this is an asset

1133
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:39,132
to the community and it'll
give us better service

1134
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:42,435
to all the outlying
community, from Palos Verdes

1135
01:18:42,435 --> 01:18:44,370
all through in this
community, you see.

1136
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:46,039
In fact, this will
be the headquarter

1137
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:47,540
for all the sheriffs

1138
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:49,909
and we feel it'll be a big
asset to the city, sir.

1139
01:18:49,909 --> 01:18:51,611
- Where did the funds
come from, to build this?

1140
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,949
- Well it came from
uh, the city has--

1141
01:18:55,949 --> 01:18:57,517
- Excuse me, Mayor.

1142
01:18:59,285 --> 01:19:00,720
There's something going on here

1143
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,921
and it's some kind of action.

1144
01:19:01,921 --> 01:19:03,823
Let's find out
from this officer,

1145
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:06,559
exactly what's happening.

1146
01:19:06,559 --> 01:19:09,162
What's happening here, officer?

1147
01:19:12,799 --> 01:19:14,734

1148
01:19:14,734 --> 01:19:17,504

happening right now?

1149
01:19:17,504 --> 01:19:20,473
- Units from another city
are in pursuit in our area.

1150
01:19:20,473 --> 01:19:22,942
I was advising the dispatcher
and they're aware of it.

1151
01:19:22,942 --> 01:19:24,310
- Yes, there's a pursuit.

Units have been advised.

1153
01:19:25,778 --> 01:19:28,248
As of right now, we don't
know exactly what's happening.

1154
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,167
- I don't know what happened,

1155
01:19:48,167 --> 01:19:49,569
but I just came out of that
store and here comes this car

1156
01:19:49,569 --> 01:19:51,204
barreling down the
street, and I just,

1157
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:53,239
I was so scared I ran
back in the store,

1158
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:54,474
and I thought--

1159
01:19:54,474 --> 01:19:55,708
- He was going down the
street? And you ran--

1160
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:56,910
- He was coming
down the sidewalk!

1161
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:59,612
- The sidewalk?
-  - Yes.

1162
01:20:26,139 --> 01:20:27,707
- He was barreling
down the road, man,

1163
01:20:27,707 --> 01:20:29,442
it was unreal, man, he
almost ran the trees down

1164
01:20:29,442 --> 01:20:30,810
and killed about 500 people.

1165
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:32,378
It was unreal, man.

1166
01:20:53,733 --> 01:20:55,234

where the traffic
isn't moving too well.

1230
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:21,173
It's all jammed up with
wrecked cars, tow trucks,

Good, would you mind coming
