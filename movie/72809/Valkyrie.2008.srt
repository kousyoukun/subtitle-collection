1
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:36,901
THE FOLLOWING IS BASED
ON A TRUE STORY

2
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:46,301
WALKÜRE

3
00:00:46,302 --> 00:00:52,901
VALKYRIE

4
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,436
I swear by God this sacred oath:

5
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:04,022
That I shall render unconditional
obedience to Adolf Hitler

6
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:07,122
Führer of the German Reich and people,

7
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:10,058
Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces.

8
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:13,323
And that I shall at all times be ready,
as a brave soldier,

9
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:20,013
to give my life for this oath...

10
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:50,398
The promises of the Führer about peace
and prosperity have been destroyed...

11
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,411
and left nothing
but destruction.

12
00:01:56,646 --> 00:01:59,943
The pestilence
Hitler has brought with his SS,

13
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:03,343
are shame and a disgrace
to the German army.

14
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:09,747
In the Officers Choir
there is widespread disgust,

15
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:14,332
about all the atrocities
committed by the Nazis.

16
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,951
The killing of civilians,

17
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:23,304
the torture and starvation
of prisoners,

18
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:26,697
the mass execution of Jews.

19
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,208
My duty as an Officer,
is no longer to save my country...

20
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,553
but to save human lifes.

21
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,722
I can not find one General...

22
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,609
in the position to confront Hitler,
with the courage to do it.

23
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,665
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir,
the General will be here in 4 hours.

24
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:47,547
Thank you.
I need to see him, when he arrives.

25
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:52,725
I found myself surrounded by men...

26
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:55,885
unwilling... or unable...
to face the truth.

27
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:59,490
Hitler is not only the arch enemy
of the entire world.

28
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:02,784
but the arch-enemy of Germany.

29
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:07,482
Change... must be made.

30
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:12,092
Colonel, my orders are to advance
to Sidi Mansour and hold it.

31
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:13,548
That what we'll do.

32
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,261
The British are moving up from the south,
Patton is closing in on the coast,

33
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:20,761
- you know we should've left 2 days ago.
- No, Colonel, we'll keep fighting...

34
00:03:20,762 --> 00:03:22,182
until the final victory.

35
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:26,835
North Africa is lost, and you're gonna need
those men a year from now to defend Berlin.

36
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:31,434
We can serve Germany,
or the Führer, not both.

37
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:35,734
It's just that sort of talk,
that had you sent here, Colonel.

38
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:39,272
What I said was much worse.

39
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:42,563
General...

40
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:46,955
I'm just trying to get these men
out of here alive.

41
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,825
What would you have me do, huh?

42
00:03:55,826 --> 00:03:57,998
You tell headquarters we're low
on water, we have to re-route, so...

43
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:03,594
we can join with the 21st Panzer's.
At least then we'll have a chance.

44
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:06,005
And records will show
we didn't have enough water...

45
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:10,884
- to reach Sidi Mansour?
- I can guarantee that.

46
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:22,070
See that it's done.

47
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:24,344
General.

48
00:07:54,823 --> 00:07:57,396
Up!

49
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,511
Down!

50
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:26,274
- Hurry, Hitler's leaving!
- Now?

51
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,174
Yeah!
Let me set the fuse.

52
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:01,520
Colonel Brandt!

53
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:03,557
Colonel Brandt.

54
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:07,158
My regards to Colonel Stief.

55
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,342
Cointreau.

56
00:09:09,343 --> 00:09:13,275
Let's hope I don't get thirsty
on that flight.

57
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,692
Tchekhov here.

58
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:47,492
What happened?

59
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,622
He's landed.

60
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:03,185
This is General Tchekhov... Connect me
with Operation's, Colonel Brandt.

61
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,097
Colonel!
Tchekhov.

62
00:10:07,098 --> 00:10:09,019
I'm glad you arrived safely.

63
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,130
I hate to trouble you, but it seems you
have the wrong bottles for Colonel Stief.

64
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,710
You do still have the package?

65
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:23,365
Oh, no, as it happens I've been
called to Berlin unexpectedly.

66
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:26,191
I can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up.

67
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:29,929
Sorry for the inconvenience, Colonel.
Yes, thank you.

68
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,489
Do you think he knows?

69
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:37,298
There's only one way to find out.

70
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:51,649
- We've been discovered.
- What makes you think that?

71
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,831
Oster has been arrested.
The Gestapo came for him last night.

72
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:56,723
The Gestapo could've arrested
him for anything.

73
00:10:56,787 --> 00:10:59,380
- What'd you think went wrong?
- We don't know.

74
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:04,849
The fuse, the temperature, altitude,
the point is, the damn thing didn't go off.

75
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,261
General Tchekhov to see
Colonel Brandt.

76
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:19,182
The Colonel is expecting you, sir.

77
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:30,521
At ease.

78
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:39,101
Sit.

79
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:40,550
You'll forgive me General,

80
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:44,650
this little roundup is having me
writing reports... all day.

81
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:47,650
- Roundup?
- Dissidenters.

82
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,865
Another plot against the Führer.

83
00:11:50,866 --> 00:11:53,274
Who are these people?

84
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:58,054
You'd be surprised.

85
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:08,298
Is... this what you've come for?

86
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:15,762
Perhaps we should... open it.

87
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:17,808
I beg your pardon?

88
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:23,609
Well, you've come a long way,
you must be... thirsty?

89
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:30,006
You know, I wonder how the Führer,
who... does not partake,

90
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:34,746
would feel about a soldier
who did so on... duty.

91
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:42,768
Colonel Brandt.

92
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:47,093
I took you for
an honest sort, General.

93
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,403
And I, you.

94
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:00,828
We are still in business.

95
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,197
Find a replacement for Oster.

96
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:06,053
There's no one we can trust,
not in Berlin.

97
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:08,619
Then stop looking in Berlin.

98
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:36,531
Frau von Stauffenberg?

99
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:39,774
Perhaps, before you go in, we could
have a word together in my office.

100
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:42,064
I will see my husband now.

101
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:52,451
His right hand has been
amputated above the wrist.

102
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:55,619
He's missing the 4th and
5th fingers on the left hand.

103
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:58,584
We... couldn't save the left eye.

104
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,974
Colonel?

105
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,887
Are you ready, sir?

106
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,966
I'm a soldier, I serve my country.

107
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,115
But this is not my country.

108
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,036
When I was lying there,
bleeding to death, thinking:

109
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:54,822
If I die now, I leave nothing
to my children, but shame.

110
00:15:57,134 --> 00:16:01,385
I know now there's only
one way to serve Germany.

111
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:04,174
And in doing so,
I'll be a traitor.

112
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:06,649
I accept that.

113
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,798
Just tell me,
can these men see it through?

114
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:16,073
We need to reorganize,
reconsider our strategy...

115
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:18,412
and recruit new men.

116
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:21,297
That's why we want you.

117
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:25,646
You understand what will happen
to my wife and children...

118
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:29,146
if these men can't see it through?

119
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:34,828
Come and hear what
they have to say.

120
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,104
You know where to find us.

121
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:16,587
It's enough! Enough!

122
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:19,705
I'm not gonna listen to another word
of this, you had your chance, you failed.

123
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,763
Your so-called simple solution
didn't work.

124
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:26,354
Our only option now
is to confront Hilter openly...

125
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:27,860
This is a military operation.

126
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:30,266
It's not a military operation!
It's a political organization,

127
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:33,252
and one that's given it's
military-arm too much control...

128
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,364
In any military exercise, you have to
expect a certain measure of deviation.

129
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:39,122
A measure? A measure? What about...
total, complete, utter failure?

130
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:41,906
Gentlemen, I think it's time
we face the fact...

131
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:45,506
the allies are coming,
sooner or later, I say, we sit back...

132
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:47,154
and let them wipe out the Nazis.

133
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:50,658
And ask every living soul in Europe
to pay the price? Use your head.

134
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:51,742
Karl, please!

135
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:54,224
I'm sorry, Ludwig.
I've held my tounge too long.

136
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:56,427
We must confront Hitler now.

137
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:57,598
Force him out!

138
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,235
And then what?

139
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:02,092
I beg your pardon?

140
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,368
When Hilter is gone, then what?

141
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,767
I'm sorry, who is this man?

142
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:12,411
Colonel Stauffenberg
is Oster's replacement.

143
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:15,991
He's been transferred to my office,
at the War Ministry.

144
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:18,374
How is your uncle?

145
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,145
He's well, sir.
He sends his regards.

146
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:21,671
He speaks very highly of you.

147
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:23,538
And of you, General.

148
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:26,106
There was one thing that made
Oster such a great organizer,

149
00:18:26,107 --> 00:18:29,591
he kept his opinions
to himself.

150
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,809
I'm simply asking what you intend
to do when Hitler is gone.

151
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,356
You don't really believe you can
just walk into the Reich-chancellery,

152
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:38,956
and command the army
to end the war?

153
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:41,573
Yes, we do.

154
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,178
You're in the presence of men who
could have been Hitler's inner circle.

155
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:52,267
Instead, we refused, Colonel.

156
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:55,981
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

157
00:18:55,982 --> 00:18:57,905
We have the respect of the people...

158
00:18:57,906 --> 00:19:00,346
and the army.

159
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:03,940
Then you don't need me.

160
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:07,279
Gentlemen.

161
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:12,495
Those men are confusing
respect with popularity.

162
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:14,478
The Army swore an oath,

163
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:17,178
an oath that won't just die...
with Hitler.

164
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,472
What 're you gonna do?

165
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:20,573
How will you deal with Göbbels,
Himmler and the SS?

166
00:19:20,574 --> 00:19:23,350
- They will wipe you out!
- It doesn't matter!

167
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:30,009
It only matters that we act, now,
before we lose the war.

168
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:34,239
Otherwise, this will always
be Hitler's Germany,

169
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,542
And we have to show the world...
not all of us were like him.

170
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:43,819
That's not enough for me.

171
00:19:44,078 --> 00:19:47,272
There has to be
a chance of success.

172
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:49,552
Then find a way.

173
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:52,549
- Papi! Papi!
- Papi is home!

174
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,997
- Papi!
- Papi!

175
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:55,002
- Papi is home!
- Papi!

176
00:19:55,003 --> 00:20:00,150
- Papi, Papi!
- Papi is here!

177
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:11,981
I thought we agreed...
I'd come see you in Bamberg.

178
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:14,000
The children couldn't wait.

179
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:15,929
The children?

180
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,598
Valkyrie.

181
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,235
We've already considered Valkyrie,
it isn't suitable...

182
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,535
Not as it is currently written...

183
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:45,617
but the Colonel has an idea
I think we should consider.

184
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:47,077
Excuse me, what is Valkyrie?

185
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:48,775
Operation Valkyrie.

186
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:51,872
The reserve army has
thousands of men, all over Berlin.

187
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:55,804
Valkyrie is... Hitler's contingency plan
to mobilize those men...

188
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:57,278
during a national emergency.

189
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,394
The sole purpose of the order is
to protect Hitler's government...

190
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:02,359
- if he's cut-off or killed.
- And... what use is this to us?

191
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,585
Valkyrie is designed
to contain... civil unrest.

192
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:09,539
But what if the S.S.
were staging a coup?

193
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:15,125
State Security is trying
to overthrow Hitler...

194
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:17,096
How would High Command respond?

195
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:19,020
We would have no choice... but to
declare a military state of emergency.

196
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:21,120
Exactly... and initiate Valkyrie.

197
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:23,740
Hitler's own reserve army
using Hitler's own plan.

198
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:26,520
We'll have no choice
but to cease power in Berlin,

199
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:30,032
to prevent the SS take-over.

200
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,196
They'll think they're fighting for
Hilter's government, not against it.

201
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:37,373
While we quietly put
a new government in place.

202
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,098
But only if he's dead.

203
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:42,227
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

204
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:45,742
How else you're gonna convince people
the SS is trying to seize power?

205
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:48,504
- We have to kill Hitler.
- I'm disappointed in you, Colonel.

206
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:50,894
I thought a man
of your background...

207
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:53,194
would suggest a more
honorable approach.

208
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:57,026
Your plan has a few
minor obstacles, Colonel.

209
00:23:57,027 --> 00:24:00,559
Firstly, Valkyrie would have to be
rewritten to exclude the SS!

210
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,958
And I'll need your help
to get a copy.

211
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:06,370
Rewriting an order is one thing.

212
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,892
Distributing it, is another.

213
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:14,888
In this case we'd be willfully circulating
written evidence of high treason.

214
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:17,543
Evidence requiring Hitler's signature.

215
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:25,547
Well, we can all draw straws
for the job.

216
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:29,009
- And what about Fromm?
- Fromm? Who is Fromm?

217
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,545
He's the commander
of the reserve army.

218
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:35,153
I can put the reserve troops on alert,
but only Fromm can initiate Valkyrie.

219
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,550
Can you get to him?

220
00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:42,840
I don't know.

221
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:45,641
We're running out of time.
Can you get to Fromm?

222
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:47,224
He is a careerist pig.

223
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:49,769
But one who has gone as far
as he can go in Hitler's army.

224
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,708
It's no secret
he's not happy about it.

225
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:54,448
Offer him a key position
in the new regime.

226
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:57,551
Make him see the light.

227
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,516
You have to put it in there.

228
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:13,094
Colonel Stauffenberg
for General Fromm.

229
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,803
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
Welcome back to the War Ministry.

230
00:25:15,804 --> 00:25:17,845
It's an honor, sir.

231
00:25:18,938 --> 00:25:21,534
I'd send you to the front,
but I think you'd surrender...

232
00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:24,604
just to be Montgomery's whore!

233
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:31,518
The General will see you now.

234
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:47,643
What is it you want?

235
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:52,674
I wanted to introduce our new man,
Colonel Stauffenberg.

236
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:55,716
Ah! From Africa!

237
00:25:55,783 --> 00:26:00,537
Well, I... I'd offer you my hand,
but I... I might not get it back.

238
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:04,471
I'd say the General has lost more
important things this morning.

239
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,513
It's about time they put somebody
with balls into this office.

240
00:26:13,514 --> 00:26:15,356
Please sit down, Colonel.

241
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:18,358
And you, Olbricht, if you must.

242
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,955
They tell me
you're critical of the war, Colonel.

243
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:34,555
Not that you don't...
seem to have good reasons.

244
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:36,622
I'm critical of indecision, General.

245
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:39,256
- In the field?
- In Berlin.

246
00:26:40,942 --> 00:26:45,009
So, that's why you're here I take it,
to... huh, to make decisions.

247
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,714
I've already made my decision.

248
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:49,693
I'm here to help others
make theirs.

249
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:56,356
They say
when there's no clear option...

250
00:26:56,757 --> 00:26:58,556
the best thing is... to do nothing.

251
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:01,932
We're at war... we must act.

252
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:04,738
Sometimes... rushing.

253
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:09,397
And what rash action
did you have in mind, Colonel?

254
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:15,760
That would be a decision for the
supreme military commander... Sir.

255
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:18,993
A supreme... commander?

256
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:23,338
Second only to the Chancellor.

257
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:35,461
If I were that man... this war
would be going quite differently.

258
00:27:35,462 --> 00:27:38,584
Well, we were thinking
the same thing, really.

259
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:54,668
I don't need to remind you...
that we've all sworn an oath...

260
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,405
to the Führer.

261
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:03,871
And...

262
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:07,572
Having said that, I'm gonna forget
this conversation ever took place.

263
00:28:07,573 --> 00:28:10,581
In the strict understanding
that such talk never occurs again...

264
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:12,588
- under this roof. Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:13,665
Yes, sir.

266
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:17,456
You can tell your friends, Colonel,
that I always come down on the right side.

267
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:23,801
And as long as the Führer is alive,
you know what side that is.

268
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,549
Heil, Hitler.

269
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,724
- Heil, Hitler.
- Heil, Hitler.

270
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:32,613
Do you realize
how close I am to Hitler?

271
00:29:32,926 --> 00:29:36,334
With one word,
I can make you disappear.

272
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:39,063
My associates don't know we've been
talking, if that's what you're afraid of.

273
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:43,360
When the SS catch you, they will
pull you apart, like warm bread.

274
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:46,606
It would be a crime
just to have known you then.

275
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:49,468
I warn you,
don't you try to contact me again.

276
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:51,311
You won't report me.

277
00:29:51,312 --> 00:29:54,066
Maybe if you'd had,
when I first approached you,

278
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:57,292
you might've been
keeping your oath then.

279
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:58,980
Now you're just as guilty
as we are.

280
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,655
And I guess that makes me
a sympathizer, hey?

281
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:03,671
Give a man a choice to betray
his fellow officer's or his Führer,

282
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:06,046
and you think his action
will show you his heart?

283
00:30:06,047 --> 00:30:08,776
- It is not that simple.
- Yes... It is.

284
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:12,513
For the last time,
don't push me to make a decision.

285
00:30:12,514 --> 00:30:15,429
I don't have a choice.
It's clear now.

286
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:20,329
Without you,
there is no hope of success.

287
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:22,850
You're nothing but rats,
jumping from a sinking ship!

288
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:25,231
What makes you think
you'll be any different?

289
00:30:25,232 --> 00:30:27,046
What makes you think
you're stronger than the people?

290
00:30:27,047 --> 00:30:29,325
The Reich?
The very momentum of history?

291
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:31,893
This is going to happen.
Action is inevitable...

292
00:30:31,894 --> 00:30:33,555
as are the consequences.

293
00:30:33,556 --> 00:30:35,822
When they'll come for me,
I'll do everything I can, to hide...

294
00:30:35,823 --> 00:30:38,234
what you are doing...
but don't delude yourself...

295
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:43,274
you were invloved in a crime against
your country long before you met me.

296
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,077
And there may still be time
to redeem yourself.

297
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,428
Only God can judge us now.

298
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,342
Hitler had
Operation Valkyrie designed...

299
00:31:01,343 --> 00:31:04,042
to completely secure
his government in 6 hours.

300
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:08,679
I'm rewriting the order so we can
seize control of the government in 3.

301
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:10,619
As written, the orders
spreads reserve troops across...

302
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,751
all of Germany's 19 military districts,

303
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:17,058
including occupied cities
like Paris, Vienna and Prague.

304
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:19,294
This is a waste of resources,
since all these districts...

305
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:22,221
follow orders from Berlin
without question.

306
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:25,868
If you take Berlin,
you take Germany.

307
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:27,331
I'm rewriting Valkyrie...

308
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:32,431
to direct the majority of our strongest
units to focus entirely on Berlin.

309
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,846
We'll surround the government quarter,
occupy all SS and police barracks.

310
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:37,443
Once we have control
of the government,

311
00:31:37,444 --> 00:31:40,330
we'll shut down
all concentration camps.

312
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,861
Any officers who resist
will be arrested.

313
00:31:42,862 --> 00:31:45,740
I've been transferred to the front.

314
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:52,096
Anyway, it doesn't matter...
you know these orders better than anyone.

315
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:55,790
That's why I'm putting you in charge
of the military wing of the operation.

316
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,568
- Beck agrees.
- Why not Olbricht?

317
00:31:58,569 --> 00:32:00,906
No, it's your plan.

318
00:32:00,907 --> 00:32:03,416
It's you.
And one more thing...

319
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,861
you need to be absolutely certain...

320
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:06,861
no conflicting orders
get out after the flash.

321
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:09,088
It is not enough to kill Hitler.

322
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,047
You need to isolate
his chain of command...

323
00:32:11,048 --> 00:32:13,547
and cut them off from
the outside world immediately.

324
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:16,289
Yes, I already
considered that.

325
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,077
I think I have just the man
who can help.

326
00:32:18,078 --> 00:32:20,006
Who is he?

327
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:23,313
Perhaps it's better if I didn't say.

328
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,298
You know, God promised Abraham
he would not destroy Sodom...

329
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:32,098
if he could find just
10 righteous men.

330
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:37,079
I have a feeling that for Germany,
it may come down to one.

331
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:44,132
Let's begin.

332
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:46,632
The Führer...

333
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,132
Adolf Hitler...

334
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:53,432
is dead.

335
00:32:58,072 --> 00:33:00,792
Heil Hitler, General.

336
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,323
Would you excuse us?

337
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:15,186
You play the part
of bureaucrat beautifully.

338
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:17,934
Well, I don't feel like
I get to relax.

339
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:21,764
You've been promoted chief of staff
for the reserve army.

340
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:25,533
- Excuse me?
- Congratulations.

341
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:28,557
I am busy with other things.

342
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,587
Unfortunately, your nocturnal activities
don't count as service to the 'Reich'.

343
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:35,569
- I'll refuse the promotion.
- You'll do no such thing.

344
00:33:36,249 --> 00:33:38,011
Tchekhov may have left you
in charge of the operation...

345
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:40,194
but in this world I still outrank you.

346
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:42,231
You will accept the promotion.

347
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:46,252
You'll have real access to Hitler,
his advisers, his schedule.

348
00:33:46,253 --> 00:33:49,124
We need this.

349
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:53,328
I've looked through
your changes to Valkyrie.

350
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:58,492
I approve.
I need you to get Hitler to sign it.

351
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:04,490
Now, there's a man here
to interview as your adjudant.

352
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:07,461
He comes highly recommended.

353
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,574
Close the door.

354
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:20,812
Be seated.

355
00:34:23,592 --> 00:34:26,624
Do you know how
this world will end, Lieutenant?

356
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:33,295
The portrait will be unhung,
and that man will be hung.

357
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:43,121
I'm engaged in high treason
with all means available to me.

358
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,558
Can I count you in?

359
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,901
For anything, sir.
Anything at all.

360
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,367
Come.
Come Stephan.

361
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,767
Pappa is real busy.

362
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,659
Colonel Brandt, operations.

363
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,245
Colonel Stauffenberg, I'd like to review
your presentation to the Führer.

364
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:10,039
Strictly routine.

365
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,442
Sir, the contents of the Colonel's
bag are for the Führer's eyes only.

366
00:36:12,443 --> 00:36:14,429
I'm the Führer's eyes, Lieutenant.

367
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,572
The Colonel is a member
of my staff at the War Ministry.

368
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:19,231
He doesn't answer to you.

369
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:22,540
They're waiting.

370
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:24,903
This way.

371
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,433
My Führer!... May I present
Colonel Stauffenberg,

372
00:37:01,434 --> 00:37:04,133
our new chief of staff
in the reserve army.

373
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:06,474
Heil, my Führer.

374
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,773
I can't tell you, what an honor
this is to meet an officer who has...

375
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:20,073
sacrificed so much for Germany.

376
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:28,347
If only more of my men
were like you.

377
00:37:29,156 --> 00:37:31,253
Let this man stand as an example
for all of you here.

378
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:34,953
He is the ideal
German... Officer.

379
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:38,997
My Führer...
Colonel Stauffenberg...

380
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:41,623
was asked to come here today
to brief us on mobilizing...

381
00:37:41,624 --> 00:37:46,517
Troops of the reserve army,
to... to repell the invasion.

382
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:49,402
Invasion?

383
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:51,138
At...

384
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,563
Normandy, my Führer.

385
00:37:54,317 --> 00:37:57,056
Oh, yes.

386
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:00,010
Normandy.

387
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:02,884
That will not be necessary.

388
00:38:03,026 --> 00:38:08,634
Reichsmarshall Göring assures me
that everything is completely under control.

389
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:12,611
Thank you, Colonel.

390
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:18,668
My Führer, if I may...
I have an amended copy...

391
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:22,291
of Operation Valkyrie,
for your approval.

392
00:39:11,196 --> 00:39:15,153
You know your Wagner, Colonel?

393
00:39:19,603 --> 00:39:23,955
The Valkyrie,
handmaidens of the gods.

394
00:39:23,956 --> 00:39:26,869
Choosing who will live
and who will die.

395
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,980
Sparing the most heroic...

396
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:33,580
from an agonizing death.

397
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:41,693
One cannot understand
National-Socialism...

398
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:45,750
if one does not
understand Wagner.

399
00:40:00,345 --> 00:40:05,007
I'm sure whatever changes
you've made are for the best.

400
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:11,131
You' re dismissed.
Send your man home. And Fromm!

401
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:15,573
Have some fresh tea
brought in, will you?

402
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,090
I don't know
what you're brewin' now.

403
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,919
And I don't wanna know.

404
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,558
But when the music stops,

405
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:36,158
I'd be obliged if Keitel
found himself without a chair.

406
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,922
Any problem on earth
can be solved...

407
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:53,227
with the careful application
of high-explosives.

408
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:56,570
The of trick is not to be around
when they go off.

409
00:40:56,571 --> 00:41:00,134
Two 975 gram packs of plastic
explosives, enough explosive...

410
00:41:00,135 --> 00:41:02,004
to cripple a Panzer.

411
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:04,328
Your detonators, your fuses.

412
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,147
British time pencils.

413
00:41:06,148 --> 00:41:08,317
This acid capsule is your trigger.

414
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:09,648
When you're ready to to arm...

415
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:12,548
attach the detonator
to the bottom of the time pencil.

416
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,044
Like so.

417
00:41:14,045 --> 00:41:17,965
Insert the entire device into
either end of the plastic "W".

418
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:21,004
Crush the acid capsule...

419
00:41:21,005 --> 00:41:23,586
and you're live.

420
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:28,253
When the acid eats through the wire
holding back the firing pin, well...

421
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:31,253
you'll wanna be very far away.

422
00:41:33,479 --> 00:41:36,750
- For you.
- How much time do we have?

423
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:39,249
Theoretically there's a 30 minute
delay, but with the kind of heat...

424
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,832
you can expect at the Wolf's Lair,
I give you 10, 15 minutes, tops.

425
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,784
That's hardly precise.

426
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:48,525
This is state-of-the-art. You can
have small or precise, not both.

427
00:41:48,526 --> 00:41:51,279
- Might this just be a little too small?
- No.

428
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,527
Hitler bunker
will magnify the blast.

429
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:57,347
It's constructed of reinforced concrete,
with steel doors, no windows.

430
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,048
The air-pressure generated by just one
of these explosives in a space like that...

431
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:04,948
Will kill everyone, instantly, the 2nd
charge will be entirely redundant.

432
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:08,467
If, by some miracle,
Hiltler does survive, what then?

433
00:42:08,468 --> 00:42:10,533
We sitll initiate Valkyrie.

434
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:13,433
At that point
there'll be no turning back.

435
00:42:13,434 --> 00:42:15,912
But we'll have an advantage.

436
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:19,046
We have an inside man
at the Wolf's Lair.

437
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:21,760
After the flash he'll cut off
communication with the outside world.

438
00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:24,004
While Hitler's inner-circle
is struggling to regroup...

439
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:28,152
We'll have the momentum
we need to seize control in Berlin.

440
00:42:28,153 --> 00:42:31,859
Himmler is expected to be at
the meeting as well. Don't proceed...

441
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,032
- unless you can get them both.
- What?

442
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:39,934
Don't proceed unless you're confident
you can get both Himmler and Hitler.

443
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:48,443
This is Gördeler, isn't it?

444
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:52,832
Yeah, I'll hold off.

445
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:54,265
If the decision is unanimous.

446
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:56,813
But I want another man
on the committee.

447
00:42:56,814 --> 00:42:59,451
- Not a politician.
- Who?

448
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,786
- Him.
- Him?

449
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:07,678
- Fine.
- But remember...

450
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:10,163
this is a military operation.

451
00:43:10,164 --> 00:43:13,566
Nothing ever goes
according to plan.

452
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:44,636
I'll take the children to Bamberg.

453
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:52,391
If I fail...

454
00:43:55,095 --> 00:43:57,334
They'll come for you.

455
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:00,597
All of you.

456
00:44:03,302 --> 00:44:05,641
I know.

457
00:44:30,778 --> 00:44:32,554
Gentlemen, good morning.

458
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:36,125
Hitler has scheduled a military briefing
for today, at one o'clock.

459
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:38,487
Stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present.

460
00:44:38,488 --> 00:44:39,860
They're here.

461
00:44:39,861 --> 00:44:44,540
Before arming the explosives, Stauffenberg
will call for authorization to proceed.

462
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:49,126
After the flash, his inside man
wil sever all communication.

463
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:52,767
Assuming Fromm refuses to join us,
Olbricht will take command...

464
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:55,524
of the reserve army
and initiate Valkyrie.

465
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:57,153
Then you'll notify
all district commanders...

466
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:59,996
that the SS is attempting
to seize power.

467
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:04,293
The reserve army will arrest all SS,
Gestapo and Nazi officials.

468
00:45:04,294 --> 00:45:06,373
By then Stauffenberg
will have returned to Berlin...

469
00:45:06,374 --> 00:45:08,897
and taken command
of the reserve army.

470
00:45:08,898 --> 00:45:12,101
Witzleben and I will assume the role
of commander of the armed forces,

471
00:45:12,102 --> 00:45:14,141
and are head of state.

472
00:45:14,142 --> 00:45:16,726
With Berlin secured, Dr. Gördeler
will address the nation...

473
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:18,664
as our new Chancellor.

474
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:23,082
Then, God willing, we can negotiate
a truce with the allies.

475
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:26,734
Save Europe
from total destruction.

476
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:30,623
This will identify you
as a member of the operation,

477
00:45:30,624 --> 00:45:35,003
Nobody goes in or out
of the parimeter without one.

478
00:45:35,247 --> 00:45:37,169
Gentlemen.

479
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,554
This is the most important day
of your lives.

480
00:45:42,112 --> 00:45:44,990
Long live sacred Germany.

481
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,861
- Captain.
- What is it?

482
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,442
An order
from General Olbricht's office.

483
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:26,110
He is calling the reserve army
for some sort of standby action...

484
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:29,386
in all the military districts,
including Berlin.

485
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:33,462
Looks like a drill of some kind.
Send it through, Sergeant.

486
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,620
Sir?

487
00:46:58,205 --> 00:47:01,552
Standby action,
what the hell for?

488
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:03,779
The order doesn't say.

489
00:47:04,103 --> 00:47:06,053
Assemble the men.

490
00:47:06,054 --> 00:47:08,702
This better not be a drill.

491
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:48,275
The men are assembled
and awaiting further orders.

492
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:51,855
What do you suppose
this is really all about?

493
00:50:39,288 --> 00:50:41,688
Can pass. [Kann durch. ]

494
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,358
Your man?

495
00:51:19,629 --> 00:51:22,384
He is now.

496
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:28,214
Continue. [Weiter]

497
00:52:37,624 --> 00:52:40,766
Colonel.

498
00:52:50,352 --> 00:52:53,556
Attention!

499
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:04,127
Gentlemen!

500
00:53:04,128 --> 00:53:06,296
For our first order of business...

501
00:53:06,297 --> 00:53:10,210
General Fromm, will present his plans
for the re-allocation of troops...

502
00:53:10,211 --> 00:53:12,825
from the reserve army
on the Eastern front.

503
00:53:12,826 --> 00:53:14,753
Well' as you know, last night
the Russians launched...

504
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:17,326
a new offensive against
army group North Ukrain, in...

505
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,518
the south Poland sector.

506
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:21,117
General Harpel was brought in...

507
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:25,317
to replace... Model and bring
a swift end to this confrontation.

508
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:27,929
- Himmler is not here.
- ... we could tranfer three divisions,

509
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:33,078
to... huh, fortify... huh,
General Harpels troops.

510
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:37,407
Now these divisions will stick
to a mobile defense plan...

511
00:53:37,408 --> 00:53:42,019
rather than holding
any one particular...

512
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:48,467
Operator.

513
00:53:48,468 --> 00:53:50,803
Connect me to the War Ministry,
General Olbricht's office.

514
00:53:50,804 --> 00:53:53,003
One moment, please...

515
00:53:57,116 --> 00:53:59,171
- General Olbricht's office.
- Himmler's not at the briefing,

516
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:01,136
Awaiting word
on permission to proceed.

517
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,090
Hold the line.

518
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:06,778
Stauffenberg says Himmler's not
at the briefing. He wants to proceed.

519
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:10,402
Call Beck.

520
00:54:10,776 --> 00:54:14,452
- Beck.
- Himmler's not at the briefing.

521
00:54:14,582 --> 00:54:16,620
Himmler is not at the briefing.

522
00:54:26,418 --> 00:54:29,112
...with a diminished reserve...

523
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,348
No.

524
00:54:36,348 --> 00:54:38,762
They say no.

525
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:42,984
What'd you say?

526
00:54:46,864 --> 00:54:49,009
I say do it.

527
00:55:24,274 --> 00:55:26,373
Whatever it was, Colonel...

528
00:55:26,374 --> 00:55:28,712
I hope it was important.

529
00:55:29,578 --> 00:55:32,954
Colonel?
Your bag.

530
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:59,426
This has been a drill...
you're dismissed!

531
00:55:59,427 --> 00:56:01,626
Disperse!

532
00:56:03,267 --> 00:56:06,311
How dare you put the reserve army
on standby without my knowledge?

533
00:56:06,312 --> 00:56:07,925
You damn near
cost me my comission.

534
00:56:07,926 --> 00:56:10,834
And what in God's name made you think
you even had the authority?

535
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:13,772
- It was only a drill, an exercise.
- Don't lie to me Olbright,

536
00:56:13,773 --> 00:56:16,513
not to me!
We both know it wasn't a drill.

537
00:56:16,514 --> 00:56:17,912
General, if I may...

538
00:56:17,913 --> 00:56:21,031
No, you may not. Colonel,
you may not do anything.

539
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:23,202
Because not only have you
proved to me you can't deliver,

540
00:56:23,203 --> 00:56:25,803
you've painted
a target on my back.

541
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:29,023
If I so much as sense you're trying
to move the reserve army again...

542
00:56:29,024 --> 00:56:32,872
I will personally
have you both arrested.

543
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:37,101
Do I make myself
abundantly clear?

544
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,312
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

545
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:46,484
- Heil, Hitler.
- Heil, Hitler.

546
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,095
I didn't hear you say it, Colonel.

547
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:00,638
Heil Hitler!

548
00:57:10,147 --> 00:57:13,175
The point of replacing Hitler
is to negotiate a truce with the allies.

549
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:15,828
The allies I suspect, would be more
amenable to a truce...

550
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:18,617
if we offered it to them
before they get to fucking Berlin.

551
00:57:18,618 --> 00:57:21,914
There's no point in killing Hitler
unless you kill Himmler too.

552
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:24,244
Why remove a madman
just to have a lunatic take his place.

553
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:26,860
Todays failure had nothing to do
with Himmler, and you know it.

554
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:30,343
This is a military operation in the hands
of a politician, nothing more.

555
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:31,395
What are you suggesting?

556
00:57:31,396 --> 00:57:33,009
I'm not suggesting anything.

557
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,879
I'm stating the facts
as I see them.

558
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,445
You don't have the courage
to kill Hitler,

559
00:57:36,446 --> 00:57:37,789
so you're making
the task impossible.

560
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:39,618
Nothing seems to stop
you and your henchmen...

561
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:41,004
from trying it on your own.

562
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:43,517
What I regret is, that I waited
for you to find your backbone.

563
00:57:43,518 --> 00:57:46,299
I don't think I'm alone when I say
your judgement is in question.

564
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,113
I'd like to call a vote.

565
00:57:48,114 --> 00:57:52,319
I propose that we relieve
Colonel Stauffenberg.

566
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:55,509
Carl, can I have a word
with you in private?

567
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,328
If you got something to say,
say it.

568
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:01,748
Very well. I heard from the chief
of police this evening...

569
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:04,743
that Himmler has issued
a warrant for your arrest.

570
00:58:07,391 --> 00:58:09,952
You have to leave Germany tonight.

571
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,763
When we succeed
with the central solution...

572
00:58:12,764 --> 00:58:15,463
you'll return as Chancellor.

573
00:58:15,464 --> 00:58:20,385
Disappear, Carl.
Avoid contact with anyone.

574
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:35,590
Good luck, Colonel.

575
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:46,406
No more indecision... From now on
Stauffenberg has the full discretion.

576
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:49,122
I can't issue the alert again
unless we follow through.

577
00:58:49,123 --> 00:58:50,996
I'll do my job.

578
00:58:51,129 --> 00:58:54,074
You just take Berlin.

579
00:58:59,989 --> 00:59:02,091
Hold on. sir.
I have a connection right now.

580
00:59:02,092 --> 00:59:03,275
Thank you.

581
00:59:03,276 --> 00:59:06,466
- Hello?
- Hello.

582
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:09,377
- Hello?
- Who's this?

583
00:59:09,756 --> 00:59:12,033
- Hello?
- Hello.

584
00:59:13,234 --> 00:59:15,704
I'm sorry, sir.
There's bombing in Emmingen,

585
00:59:15,705 --> 00:59:17,873
We've been disconnected.

586
00:59:18,351 --> 00:59:20,639
Emmingen is a long way
from Bamberg.

587
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,639
- I'm sure your family is safe.
- Thank you.

588
01:00:58,353 --> 01:00:59,876
Welcome, Colonel.

589
01:00:59,877 --> 01:01:03,318
Do you have a place
where I can change, Major?

590
01:01:03,319 --> 01:01:05,553
Please follow me.

591
01:01:12,048 --> 01:01:14,082
Please, put the reserve army
on standby alert.

592
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:15,335
Not until I've heard
from Stauffenberg.

593
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:17,009
- Not until I'm sure.
- That's not what he would...

594
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,673
Noted, Colonel.
Thank you.

595
01:01:31,098 --> 01:01:33,641
The meeting has been moved
up to 12.30.

596
01:01:33,642 --> 01:01:36,385
Mussolini's arriving
on the afternoon train.

597
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:37,967
The Führer
wants to have luncheon.

598
01:01:37,968 --> 01:01:41,569
Yes, sir... Will Mussolini
be joining us in the briefing, sir?

599
01:01:42,082 --> 01:01:44,725
I only wish he were.
Then some ambitious officer...

600
01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:48,567
might take the opportunity
to shoot that deigo bastard.

601
01:01:50,004 --> 01:01:52,624
Excuse me, General. I'm expecting
an important call.

602
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,706
Could you please have someone
come and get me?

603
01:01:54,707 --> 01:01:57,025
Even if I'm with the Führer.

604
01:01:57,026 --> 01:02:00,693
- Of course, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

605
01:02:00,694 --> 01:02:03,041
Colonel.

606
01:02:34,193 --> 01:02:37,016
Major Freyend speaking.

607
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,674
Colonel?

608
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:49,246
They insist you hurry.

609
01:02:50,028 --> 01:02:51,692
The briefing's about to begin.

610
01:02:51,693 --> 01:02:53,977
One moment please, Major.

611
01:02:59,303 --> 01:03:04,918
10 minutes: 2 for the welcome, 1 for the
checkpoint, 1 for the bunker, 6 to get out.

612
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:07,516
Plenty of time.

613
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,050
Excuse me, Colonel.

614
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,559
Sir! The Führer's at the briefing.

615
01:03:22,936 --> 01:03:25,531
The Colonel is changing, Major.

616
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:30,775
Well, you understand
this can be difficult.

617
01:03:30,776 --> 01:03:32,609
Of course.

618
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:38,655
Okay...

619
01:03:45,709 --> 01:03:47,655
Plenty of time.

620
01:04:11,252 --> 01:04:13,997
- Get the car.
- Sir?

621
01:04:13,998 --> 01:04:16,384
I've got everything I need.
Get the car.

622
01:04:44,016 --> 01:04:46,395
I can manage this.

623
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:00,224
- Where're they going?
- It is too hot.

624
01:05:00,225 --> 01:05:02,975
The briefing has been moved
to the conference hut.

625
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,023
Major, my injuries
have left me hard of hearing.

626
01:05:29,024 --> 01:05:31,850
Could you place me
as close to the Führer as possible.

627
01:05:31,851 --> 01:05:34,316
I'll see what I can do.

628
01:05:34,335 --> 01:05:36,890
Not only have they been
advancing from the east...

629
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:40,745
but they're coming down on the northern
and the southern fronts as well.

630
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:43,946
As you can see, my Führer...

631
01:05:43,947 --> 01:05:46,161
if the enemy continues
at this rate...

632
01:05:46,162 --> 01:05:49,773
the situation in the east
Prussian sector is critical.

633
01:05:49,774 --> 01:05:52,805
Lack of supplies is continuing
to weaken our main units.

634
01:05:52,806 --> 01:05:55,522
Our reserves
are severely depleted.

635
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:58,307
My Führer, you remember
Colonel Stauffenberg?

636
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,958
As you are all aware,
in the past 2 days alone,

637
01:06:08,959 --> 01:06:11,430
the 10th Army
has given up Ancona.

638
01:06:11,431 --> 01:06:14,189
The 14th Division has been
pushed out of Khartoum.

639
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:18,246
Army Group Center has already
lost 28 of their 40 divisions.

640
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:22,483
That is a total
of almost 350.000 men.

641
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:30,606
Since the Red Army first attacked
nearly a month ago...

642
01:06:30,607 --> 01:06:34,533
our troops have already been
pushed back to the Polish border.

643
01:06:34,722 --> 01:06:37,221
Wolf Lair's hut.

644
01:06:37,222 --> 01:06:39,563
...common with the loss
of the 4th Army in Minsk...

645
01:06:39,564 --> 01:06:41,963
...let us be advised...

646
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,421
Yes, sir.

647
01:06:43,422 --> 01:06:48,117
...from Army Group North Ukraine
as well as the Romanian...

648
01:06:52,712 --> 01:06:55,162
...to prevent further losses.

649
01:06:55,163 --> 01:06:58,557
Unless we can quickly dispatch
new blocking divisions,

650
01:06:58,558 --> 01:07:01,308
at vital points
along the German Reich...

651
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:03,952
- Army Group will be swallowed...
- You have phone call, sir.

652
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,058
by the enemie
in less than a fortnight...

653
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:09,766
and we run the risk of losing all
the ground we have managed to gain...

654
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:11,566
in the last three years.

655
01:07:13,094 --> 01:07:16,547
General Fellgiebel, sir.
He said it's urgent.

656
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,587
Yes General,
this is Stauffenberg.

657
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,659
Russian air activity has proven...

658
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:30,338
just as impregnable
as their ground forces.

659
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:32,366
My Führer?

660
01:07:38,216 --> 01:07:40,802
...in some areas
they outnumber...

661
01:07:44,004 --> 01:07:46,551
...along the Italian front,
I further...

662
01:07:48,965 --> 01:07:51,863
One thing is certain,
the Red Army...

663
01:07:51,864 --> 01:07:54,634
will continue
an agressive push west.

664
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:56,356
Even at the expense...

665
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:03,207
In order to rebuild, the...

666
01:08:07,805 --> 01:08:12,632
...already southwest of Lüneburg
and closing on Army Group...

667
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:18,210
It will be a catastrophe.

668
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:40,615
Get in!

669
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:43,529
Drive!

670
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,049
I've got orders from the Führer.
Drive!

671
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:49,238
Drive!
Drive!

672
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:54,299
Back to work.

673
01:09:23,992 --> 01:09:26,188
Get me the War Ministry,
General Olbricht...

674
01:09:26,189 --> 01:09:29,508
tell General Olbricht
it's urgent.

675
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:35,456
General Olbricht's office.

676
01:09:35,457 --> 01:09:41,771
...calling... from the... lair... speak...
General Olbright... Führer... flash...

677
01:09:41,772 --> 01:09:44,371
...General Fellgiebel...

678
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:47,471
How did it go?
How did it...?

679
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,534
- Sever all communications.
- Sir?

680
01:09:49,535 --> 01:09:51,334
Just do it!

681
01:09:53,948 --> 01:09:55,455
Well, what did he say?

682
01:09:55,456 --> 01:09:56,495
Sir...

683
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:59,045
I can't be sure.

684
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:01,281
Well, get him back
on the line.

685
01:10:03,356 --> 01:10:05,628
Sir, the bomb did go off,
that much was clear.

686
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:09,399
Fellgiebel's next step will be
to sever all communications.

687
01:10:18,612 --> 01:10:20,887
Sorry, Colonel.
No one gets in or out.

688
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:22,058
We have an order
from the Führer.

689
01:10:22,059 --> 01:10:24,148
We have to get to the airfield
immediately, open the gate.

690
01:10:24,149 --> 01:10:26,445
I'm very sorry sir.
But my orders are to keep you...

691
01:10:26,446 --> 01:10:28,737
I just gave you an order, Sergeant.

692
01:10:28,738 --> 01:10:30,564
Sir!
Sir!

693
01:10:30,565 --> 01:10:32,325
Excuse me.

694
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:41,878
Colonel Stauffenberg
for Fieldmarshall Keitel.

695
01:10:47,936 --> 01:10:51,197
Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit.
We initiate Valyrie, regardless...

696
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:53,180
Only Fromm can initiate Valyrie...

697
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:56,398
Then tell him Hitler is dead
or arrest him. But do it now.

698
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:58,893
You have to give the order
to initiate Valkyrie, this is our only...

699
01:10:58,894 --> 01:11:01,258
I'm not doing anything
until I hear from Fellgiebel.

700
01:11:01,259 --> 01:11:02,743
Get him back on the phone now.

701
01:11:02,744 --> 01:11:04,993
Every second we stand here
arguing is a second lost.

702
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:06,641
The risk is too great.

703
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:09,467
What about Stauffenberg?
What about his risk?

704
01:11:09,468 --> 01:11:12,460
He did his part, and now
you're abandonning him.

705
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:15,728
Fieldmarshall, sir.
Stauffenberg here, Sergeant...?

706
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,180
Kobel, sir.

707
01:11:17,181 --> 01:11:18,542
- What?
- Kobel.

708
01:11:18,543 --> 01:11:21,227
Kobel won't let me past
the main gate.

709
01:11:21,228 --> 01:11:22,952
Yes sir, I explained that.

710
01:11:22,953 --> 01:11:26,073
Perhaps
you can make him understand, sir.

711
01:11:30,671 --> 01:11:33,891
Everything is fine now,sir.
Thank you.

712
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:38,616
Open the gate.

713
01:11:46,954 --> 01:11:49,867
- Please put the reserve army on alert.
- When Stauffenberg returns...

714
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:53,012
When he gives me confirmation
that Hitler is dead.

715
01:11:53,013 --> 01:11:54,778
Then we'll proceed.

716
01:11:59,894 --> 01:12:01,840
Where are you going?

717
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:03,412
The same place as you are...

718
01:12:03,413 --> 01:12:05,213
Lunch.

719
01:13:41,696 --> 01:13:44,795
Another standby alert.

720
01:13:46,185 --> 01:13:49,638
Send it through
and keep me informed.

721
01:14:11,913 --> 01:14:13,750
Sir?

722
01:14:14,142 --> 01:14:16,020
Another standby order.

723
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:21,179
In ancient Greece
you would've been killed for this.

724
01:14:21,978 --> 01:14:25,195
Lucky for you we've evolved.

725
01:14:27,648 --> 01:14:29,763
Assemble the men.

726
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:18,746
Quiet, isn't it?

727
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:22,211
I'll see where our driver is.

728
01:15:25,058 --> 01:15:29,457
The Colonel and I are at the airfield.
There is no car, there's no one here.

729
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:33,552
You mean to tell me the alert's
only just gone out?

730
01:15:34,369 --> 01:15:37,471
This is Stauffenberg,
give me General Olbricht.

731
01:15:44,589 --> 01:15:47,058
What's this?

732
01:15:52,858 --> 01:15:54,995
- Explain this!
- We did something, while you...

733
01:15:54,996 --> 01:15:56,860
We don't know
that Hitler is not alive.

734
01:15:56,861 --> 01:15:59,579
This is about Germany,
for God's sake, not you.

735
01:16:08,969 --> 01:16:11,357
General Olbricht's office.

736
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:14,857
Colonel Stauffenberg.
For you, sir.

737
01:16:20,815 --> 01:16:22,905
- This is Olbricht.
- It's been 3 hours Olbricht.

738
01:16:22,906 --> 01:16:24,501
What the hell
have you been doing?

739
01:16:24,502 --> 01:16:27,351
We've had no confirmation
that Hitler was dead.

740
01:16:27,352 --> 01:16:28,656
Damn-it!

741
01:16:28,657 --> 01:16:31,149
I saw the explosion myself!

742
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:33,844
- We are committed.
- Dear god.

743
01:16:33,845 --> 01:16:36,355
Now where is Fromm?
Is he with us?

744
01:16:36,356 --> 01:16:39,834
- Is he with us?
- No one has spoken to him yet.

745
01:16:51,177 --> 01:16:55,189
Listen to me. Never mind Germany,
never mind Europe.

746
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,298
Your life... is at stake now.

747
01:16:57,299 --> 01:16:58,718
And if you wanna live
through the night,

748
01:16:58,719 --> 01:16:59,876
you'll do exactly as I say.

749
01:16:59,877 --> 01:17:03,027
The second you hang up the phone
initiate Valkyrie in Fromm's name.

750
01:17:03,028 --> 01:17:04,617
Give him the choice to join us...

751
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:06,835
or place him under immediate arrest,
you understand me?

752
01:17:06,836 --> 01:17:08,090
Yes.

753
01:17:08,091 --> 01:17:11,324
I'll be at Fromm's office
in 15 minutes. Be there when I arrive.

754
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:44,714
Call Beck and others.
Tell them it's time.

755
01:17:49,293 --> 01:17:51,959
Put me through
to communications.

756
01:17:52,758 --> 01:17:56,655
This is General Olbricht.
Calling on behalf of General Fromm...

757
01:17:56,656 --> 01:18:00,712
Commander of the reserve army.
The Führer, Adolf Hitler, is dead.

758
01:18:00,713 --> 01:18:02,346
A group of radicals in the SS...

759
01:18:02,347 --> 01:18:04,791
are attempting to seize control
of the government.

760
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:08,260
Initiate operation Valkyrie.

761
01:18:41,624 --> 01:18:45,392
You have your orders.
Pass them along.

762
01:19:20,764 --> 01:19:22,771
Battalion.

763
01:19:22,772 --> 01:19:24,611
Attention!

764
01:19:28,862 --> 01:19:30,661
The Führer...

765
01:19:32,462 --> 01:19:36,463
Our Führer, Adolf Hitler...

766
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,611
is dead.

767
01:19:40,612 --> 01:19:42,727
Who told you
the Führer was dead?

768
01:19:42,728 --> 01:19:45,462
General Fellgiebel,
at the Wolf's Lair.

769
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:50,334
There's no use calling.
All communication lines are down.

770
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:52,413
Get me the Wolf's Lair.

771
01:19:56,435 --> 01:19:57,755
Wolf's Lair.

772
01:19:57,756 --> 01:20:01,545
Yes, General Fromm for
Fieldmarshall Keitel, urgent.

773
01:20:05,331 --> 01:20:08,784
- Keitel.
- I'm sorry to... huh, disturb you, sir.

774
01:20:08,785 --> 01:20:10,221
But I wonder if you could tell me
what's happening?

775
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,270
The most incredible rumours
are circulating in Berlin.

776
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:14,021
I don't know what you mean.

777
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:18,165
There's talk that the Führer
has been assassinated.

778
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:24,040
Another failed attempt.
The Führer was never in danger.

779
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:27,817
By the way, where's your man,Stauffenberg?

780
01:20:27,818 --> 01:20:31,752
Stauffenberg? On his way back
to Berlin, I would think.

781
01:20:31,753 --> 01:20:36,157
Let me know when he arrives.
I'd like a word with him.

782
01:20:42,508 --> 01:20:44,849
- The Führer's fine.
- That is a lie.

783
01:20:44,850 --> 01:20:47,455
Adolf Hitler is dead.
Operation Valkyrie is in effect.

784
01:20:47,456 --> 01:20:49,146
Only I can initiate Valkyrie.

785
01:20:49,147 --> 01:20:51,002
You did.

786
01:20:59,322 --> 01:21:00,657
This is treason...

787
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:03,277
Right now, the reserve army
is assuming control of Berlin.

788
01:21:03,278 --> 01:21:05,110
Are you with us or not?

789
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:07,039
Do you realise what you've done?

790
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,932
The Führer is alive.

791
01:21:08,933 --> 01:21:13,131
I delivered the bomb myself,
I saw the blast. He is dead.

792
01:21:14,561 --> 01:21:15,640
Are you with us or not?

793
01:21:15,641 --> 01:21:17,820
I don't believe this is happening.
This is some kind of...

794
01:21:17,821 --> 01:21:19,339
Are you with us or not?

795
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:25,506
Colonel, if what you say is true
you should shoot yourself immediately.

796
01:21:25,507 --> 01:21:26,944
The rest of you are under arrest.

797
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:29,082
No General, you are.

798
01:21:34,091 --> 01:21:37,488
I don't know
where you think this is going.

799
01:21:39,643 --> 01:21:41,443
Get me operations.

800
01:21:42,557 --> 01:21:43,998
This is Colonel Stauffenberg,

801
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,533
seal off the War Ministery
per operation Valkyrie.

802
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:47,793
No one gets in or out...

803
01:21:47,794 --> 01:21:50,893
without authorization
from General Olbricht's office.

804
01:22:06,576 --> 01:22:08,376
General Beck.

805
01:22:08,869 --> 01:22:10,894
You're not wearing your uniform, sir.

806
01:22:10,895 --> 01:22:13,922
This should be seen
as a movement of the people.

807
01:22:19,807 --> 01:22:22,252
Colonel Stauffenberg?

808
01:22:22,253 --> 01:22:24,720
Yes.

809
01:22:27,226 --> 01:22:30,830
The chief has guaranteed
the full support of the Berlin police.

810
01:22:32,792 --> 01:22:37,510
You will have no interference
from my men, you have my word.

811
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:41,525
Thank you.

812
01:23:15,406 --> 01:23:19,174
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
We are reporting for duty.

813
01:23:23,869 --> 01:23:26,101
Thanks for coming.

814
01:23:30,135 --> 01:23:31,934
Gentlemen...

815
01:23:31,935 --> 01:23:33,934
in 3 hours I want confirmation...

816
01:23:33,935 --> 01:23:35,917
that the government quarters
is ours,

817
01:23:35,918 --> 01:23:39,359
and SS command has been cleared
of every living soul.

818
01:23:39,601 --> 01:23:41,837
You all know what must be done.

819
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:48,209
By nightfall I wanna know that Hitler's
Germany has seen it's last sunrise.

820
01:24:15,731 --> 01:24:17,501
Yes sir, the broadcast
has been approved.

821
01:24:17,502 --> 01:24:20,238
Feldmarschall Witzleben
has been appointed...

822
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:23,175
commander in chief
of the armed forces.

823
01:24:23,176 --> 01:24:25,308
That's exactly
why he's been appointed...

824
01:24:25,309 --> 01:24:27,424
if he was a member of the Party
he'd be locked up as a suspect.

825
01:24:27,425 --> 01:24:29,205
Yes sir, I understand.
This is an emergency.

826
01:24:29,206 --> 01:24:31,401
Commanding officer
of the 11th district...

827
01:24:31,402 --> 01:24:33,031
I need a decision, Major.

828
01:24:33,032 --> 01:24:35,399
Tell your men that acts of
vengeance will not be tolerated.

829
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,308
Connect me to the commanding
officer in Hannover...

830
01:24:37,309 --> 01:24:39,315
We represent a different
form of government.

831
01:24:39,316 --> 01:24:42,308
I'd be careful who you said that to.
Loyalty to the Party isn't what it used to be.

832
01:24:42,309 --> 01:24:44,001
Yes, Paris, France.

833
01:24:44,002 --> 01:24:46,049
Heads of state
murdered the Führer.

834
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,155
Thank you,

835
01:24:47,156 --> 01:24:49,329
you made the right decision.

836
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:51,868
District 13 is ours.

837
01:25:02,706 --> 01:25:07,183
You're under arrest
for crimes against the state.

838
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:18,219
This is Stauffenberg, I'm trying
to connect with Major-General Todt.

839
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,134
...413 battalion,
you have no trouble getting...

840
01:25:21,135 --> 01:25:24,319
...This is Colonel Stauffenberg...
... will explain everything...

841
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,319
Excellent.

842
01:25:27,631 --> 01:25:29,798
My wife is at Bamberg
with my children,

843
01:25:29,799 --> 01:25:32,394
would you please try
to reach them with the phone?

844
01:25:32,395 --> 01:25:33,795
Thank you.

845
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:37,001
General Scheidler has issued the Valkyrie
orders and has sealed off headquarters.

846
01:25:37,002 --> 01:25:41,031
Check the radio stations every 20 minutes
until we have confirmation they're ours.

847
01:25:52,831 --> 01:25:55,296
With all due respect, sir.
You can't believe everything you hear.

848
01:25:55,297 --> 01:25:57,497
That is SS propaganda, he's dead.

849
01:25:57,498 --> 01:26:00,304
The commander of the home army
is authorized to give orders.

850
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:02,900
General?

851
01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:06,298
Our men in the transport office
have secured...

852
01:26:06,299 --> 01:26:07,872
the railways
communications network.

853
01:26:07,873 --> 01:26:10,403
...repeat to stations...

854
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,078
- ... we need more men...
- I'm glad you showed up.

855
01:26:15,079 --> 01:26:17,272
He's with us.

856
01:26:17,323 --> 01:26:20,924
Mertz, call Potsdam, tell them place
all available units under our control.

857
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:22,779
You have your men,
now get control...

858
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,732
We have control
of the government quarter.

859
01:26:24,733 --> 01:26:26,962
We don't have Berlin yet.

860
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,676
- What is it now, Sergeant?
- Arrest orders, sir.

861
01:26:51,677 --> 01:26:53,734
One from Colonel Stauffenberg
in the War Ministry.

862
01:26:53,735 --> 01:26:55,590
To arrest Reichsminister Göbbels.

863
01:26:55,591 --> 01:27:00,825
The other is from the Wolfs Lair
to arrest Colonel Stauffenberg.

864
01:27:05,326 --> 01:27:07,617
Send them both through.

865
01:27:08,119 --> 01:27:11,165
Our job is not to interpret orders.

866
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:13,697
Our job is to pass them
along, regardless...

867
01:27:13,698 --> 01:27:17,007
- Yes, but...
- That will be all, Sergeant.

868
01:27:51,629 --> 01:27:55,940
New arrest orders, sir.
For Stauffenberg and Göbbels.

869
01:27:56,527 --> 01:27:59,379
Do we arrest them both?

870
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:02,238
I would hate to find out
I am being taken advantage of.

871
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:06,079
- You really think it's a coup?
- I'm afraid so.

872
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,903
But I can't say which side we're on.

873
01:28:09,424 --> 01:28:11,684
Come with me.

874
01:28:21,237 --> 01:28:23,247
I've just spoken to Colonel...

875
01:28:23,248 --> 01:28:27,085
They've arrested 1200 SS
and Gestapo officials in Paris.

876
01:28:27,086 --> 01:28:29,075
Not a single shot fired.

877
01:28:29,076 --> 01:28:33,201
Early reports from Vienna are good.
I'm waiting on word from Prague.

878
01:29:06,204 --> 01:29:08,876
I'm ready to be connected.

879
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,608
Minister Göbbels?

880
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:25,498
What can I do for you, Major?

881
01:29:25,499 --> 01:29:28,835
My battalion has an order to block
every government quarter,

882
01:29:28,836 --> 01:29:32,072
and place you under arrest.

883
01:29:33,846 --> 01:29:37,325
Are you a dedicated
National-Socialist, Major?

884
01:29:38,426 --> 01:29:40,695
Yes, Sir.

885
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:56,211
Major Remer here.

886
01:29:56,212 --> 01:29:58,294
Hello.

887
01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:03,258
Do you recognize my voice?

888
01:30:03,851 --> 01:30:07,783
- Yes, my Führer.
- Then listen to me very carefully.

889
01:30:09,578 --> 01:30:13,048
I want these traitors taken alive.

890
01:30:13,049 --> 01:30:16,997
Yes, my Führer.

891
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:25,463
You heard what he said. The Führer
wants the traitors taken alive.

892
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:28,380
Yes, sir.

893
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:53,933
It is a coup alright.

894
01:30:53,934 --> 01:30:57,494
We can't afford
to remain neutral any longer.

895
01:30:59,922 --> 01:31:03,221
You have to make a decision.

896
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:08,028
When it's over we better land
on the right side.

897
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:15,996
We better.

898
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,853
Send through all communication
with the Wolf's Lair.

899
01:31:19,854 --> 01:31:22,699
Stop all communications
with Stauffenberg.

900
01:31:28,355 --> 01:31:29,920
Release these men.

901
01:31:29,921 --> 01:31:31,404
Why, sir?

902
01:31:31,405 --> 01:31:33,280
they're part of the coup.

903
01:31:33,281 --> 01:31:36,213
I've just been on the phone
with Hitler himself.

904
01:31:36,214 --> 01:31:39,132
We are the coup
We've been duped.

905
01:31:41,937 --> 01:31:45,084
We've lost contact with district 11.

906
01:31:47,449 --> 01:31:51,578
The switchboard is overloaded.
Give it ten minutes, then try again.

907
01:31:55,325 --> 01:31:58,145
Give me General Vieler, district 11.

908
01:31:58,146 --> 01:32:02,494
- We still need our...
- Keep trying.

909
01:32:03,869 --> 01:32:06,266
Where is General Fromm?

910
01:32:07,807 --> 01:32:11,188
General Fromm is no longer
in command, I am.

911
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:14,012
Beck, what are you doing here?
What is going on?

912
01:32:14,013 --> 01:32:15,431
The Führer is dead.

913
01:32:15,432 --> 01:32:17,063
The SS are staging a coup,

914
01:32:17,064 --> 01:32:18,660
initiated operation Valkyrie...

915
01:32:18,661 --> 01:32:21,219
To crush the uprising
and save Hitler's Germany.

916
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:23,992
You'll present the order
to your troops.

917
01:32:24,493 --> 01:32:27,657
I will do no such thing
until I speak to General Fromm.

918
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:31,496
You'll follow your orders
or you are arrested.

919
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:34,459
This is treason.

920
01:32:34,504 --> 01:32:38,511
I will take no part.
The Führer is not dead.

921
01:32:38,843 --> 01:32:40,666
- The Führer is not dead!
- Stop him!

922
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:44,274
The Führer is not dead!
The Führer is not dead!

923
01:32:44,275 --> 01:32:49,114
I sworn an oath! This is treason!
You all sworn an oath!

924
01:32:49,115 --> 01:32:54,005
Listen to what I have to say!
You are all making a terrible mistake!

925
01:32:54,006 --> 01:32:57,454
The Führer is not dead!

926
01:32:58,772 --> 01:33:01,659
The Führer is not dead!

927
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:04,775
Please, try my wife again...

928
01:33:13,385 --> 01:33:15,720
Bamberg, please...

929
01:33:21,397 --> 01:33:23,777
Take your hands off!

930
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:30,148
Sir...

931
01:33:40,776 --> 01:33:42,947
...Over 215 enemy tanks
have been annahilated...

932
01:33:42,948 --> 01:33:44,847
in the past week alone...

933
01:33:44,848 --> 01:33:49,268
The Airforce engaged a low-flying
offensive on enemy concentrations...

934
01:33:49,513 --> 01:33:51,123
Sir? I can't get through
to General Görlock.

935
01:33:51,124 --> 01:33:54,120
Send a runner down to his office,
bring him here.

936
01:33:56,466 --> 01:33:59,005
Yes, thank you.

937
01:33:59,006 --> 01:34:01,334
Yes, this is Stauffenberg.

938
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,753
I was speaking to the
General 5 minutes ago.

939
01:34:03,754 --> 01:34:05,737
He told me he'll return my call...

940
01:34:05,738 --> 01:34:09,355
I trust everything in your district
is under control.

941
01:34:12,038 --> 01:34:14,723
And the General knows I'm waiting?

942
01:34:14,724 --> 01:34:16,724
I'm ordering you to put him
on the phone immediately.

943
01:34:16,725 --> 01:34:18,775
...the army gave their oath
to a liar, Hans...

944
01:34:18,776 --> 01:34:19,775
Hello?

945
01:34:19,776 --> 01:34:21,575
...One who has broken his own oath
to the people a hundred times over...

946
01:34:21,576 --> 01:34:23,460
Hello?

947
01:34:23,461 --> 01:34:25,539
Hans, listen to me.

948
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:54,359
This operation has been terminated!
Stand down!

949
01:34:58,781 --> 01:35:01,773
Today an attempt
was made on the Führer's life.

950
01:35:01,774 --> 01:35:06,616
The Führer himself suffered no major
injuries beyond light burns and bruises.

951
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:08,743
He resumed his work immediately.

952
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:15,369
No seriously wounded include General...
Colonel Brandt and staff-officer Berger...

953
01:35:19,493 --> 01:35:22,702
Send the following orders to all
reserve army commanders:

954
01:35:22,703 --> 01:35:26,411
"Broadcast incorrect.
The Führer is dead...

955
01:35:28,313 --> 01:35:30,400
Operation Valkyrie still in effect.

956
01:35:30,401 --> 01:35:36,261
Reich Marshal Goering, and has
scheduled to receive Mussolini...

957
01:35:36,262 --> 01:35:38,435
Long live our Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler,

958
01:35:38,436 --> 01:35:42,112
whom the Almighty God
has so visibly blessed today.

959
01:35:45,127 --> 01:35:47,005
I saw the blast.

960
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:53,817
I saw the blast.

961
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:04,775
Today an attempt was made
on the Führer's life.

962
01:36:04,776 --> 01:36:09,632
The Führer himself suffered no major
injuries beyond light burns and bruises...

963
01:36:09,633 --> 01:36:10,890
I'm sorry...

964
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:15,390
...resumed his work immediately.
No seriously wounded...

965
01:36:39,598 --> 01:36:42,024
Stay tuned for the Fuhrer's
address to the German people.

966
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:44,505
My family?

967
01:36:44,506 --> 01:36:47,486
Our lines have been cut.

968
01:36:50,215 --> 01:36:52,054
I'm sorry.

969
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,628
Go.

970
01:36:55,925 --> 01:36:58,512
It's alright. Go.

971
01:37:13,723 --> 01:37:17,255
General, sir.
We have to get you out of here.

972
01:38:39,772 --> 01:38:41,545
Get back.

973
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:43,657
- Stop.
- Stand down.

974
01:38:43,658 --> 01:38:46,284
- I said stop.
- I said stand down.

975
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:14,123
Hold your fire.

976
01:39:22,364 --> 01:39:24,833
Colonel Stauffenberg.

977
01:39:26,932 --> 01:39:30,385
By orders of the Führer,
you are under arrest.

978
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:56,577
If you have any last messages
to your wives and children,

979
01:39:56,578 --> 01:39:58,443
I will hear them now.

980
01:39:58,472 --> 01:40:01,936
Very well, a court martial
convened by me...

981
01:40:01,937 --> 01:40:03,827
in the Führer's absence,
will pronounce sentence.

982
01:40:03,828 --> 01:40:05,598
Beck, you are under arrest.

983
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:10,835
Coronel Mertz Von Quirnheim,
General Olbricht, Tenente Hiften...

984
01:40:10,836 --> 01:40:14,458
And the Colonel, whose name I will
not mention, are condemned to death.

985
01:40:14,459 --> 01:40:16,939
General, my orders are
to take these men alive.

986
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:18,700
Noted, Major.

987
01:40:19,932 --> 01:40:22,637
I'd like a pistol, please.

988
01:40:24,461 --> 01:40:27,126
For personal reasons.

989
01:40:43,676 --> 01:40:46,116
- Get on with it.
- With all respect, sir.

990
01:40:46,117 --> 01:40:47,691
That will be all, Major.

991
01:40:47,692 --> 01:40:49,857
Killing us won't hide
your involvement.

992
01:40:49,858 --> 01:40:52,574
My involvement?
I don't know what you're talking about?

993
01:40:52,575 --> 01:40:55,842
- You knew and did nothing.
- You're as guilty as any of us.

994
01:40:55,843 --> 01:41:00,478
- Spare me Lieutenant.
- No one will be spared.

995
01:41:14,586 --> 01:41:17,606
I'm thinking of earlier times.

996
01:41:21,871 --> 01:41:26,201
This is an outrage. It has never
before been perpetrated here.

997
01:41:26,202 --> 01:41:29,588
A Field Marshal and a General declare
that they could do things better than he...

998
01:41:29,589 --> 01:41:33,525
Who is the Füher of us all.

999
01:41:33,526 --> 01:41:36,664
You'll protest to having said this?

1000
01:41:37,026 --> 01:41:38,740
Yes.

1001
01:41:42,031 --> 01:41:46,952
My fellow Germans. I speak to you
tonight for two reasons.

1002
01:41:46,953 --> 01:41:51,914
First, so that you can hear my voice
and know that I am unhurt.

1003
01:41:51,915 --> 01:41:56,324
Second, so that you can know
the details of a crime...

1004
01:41:56,325 --> 01:41:59,148
without parallel in German history.

1005
01:41:59,396 --> 01:42:02,605
A small clique of ambitious,

1006
01:42:02,606 --> 01:42:06,315
dishonorable officers
had conspired to eliminate me.

1007
01:42:07,193 --> 01:42:09,869
Except for a few bruises and burns...

1008
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:13,048
I was completely untouched.

1009
01:42:14,005 --> 01:42:17,340
I see in this the hand of Providence...

1010
01:42:17,864 --> 01:42:21,317
Directing me to complete my work.

1011
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:31,752
Look them in the eye.

1012
01:42:36,071 --> 01:42:37,824
Olbricht.

1013
01:42:47,555 --> 01:42:49,844
Men, ready!

1014
01:43:02,989 --> 01:43:07,978
And we have to show the world,
that not all of us were like him.

1015
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,700
Agh...

1016
01:43:18,701 --> 01:43:22,369
Fire!
Stand!

1017
01:43:42,694 --> 01:43:44,520
Stauffenberg

1018
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:51,449
People know we put our principles
above personal gains.

1019
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,629
Men, Ready!

1020
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:58,054
Aim!

1021
01:44:11,844 --> 01:44:14,524
Stand still.

1022
01:44:20,638 --> 01:44:25,362
You may hand us over to
the executioner, but in 3 months time...

1023
01:44:25,363 --> 01:44:29,143
The disgusted and tired people
will bring you to book.

1024
01:44:29,144 --> 01:44:33,177
And drag you alive through
the dirt in the streets.

1025
01:44:33,291 --> 01:44:36,204
Take him away.

1026
01:44:40,113 --> 01:44:43,275
Men, Ready!

1027
01:44:44,573 --> 01:44:46,729
Aim!

1028
01:44:47,251 --> 01:44:49,812
- Long live sacred Germany!
- Fire.

1029
01:44:51,018 --> 01:44:52,853
Stand.
