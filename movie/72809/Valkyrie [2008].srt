1
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,693
...the mass
execution of Jews.

2
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:38,073
My duty as an officer is no
longer to save my country,

3
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,909
but to save human lives.

4
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,831
I cannot find one general in
a position to confront Hitler

5
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,000
with the courage to do it.

6
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,085
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.

7
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,254
The General will be
here in four hours.

8
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,465
Thank you. I'll need to
see him when he arrives.

9
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,971
I find myself
surrounded by men

10
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,557
unwilling or unable
to face the truth.

11
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,978
Hitler is not only the
archenemy of the entire world

12
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,272
but the archenemy of Germany.

13
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,776
A change must be made.

14
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,283
Colonel, my orders are to advance
to Sidi Mansour and hold it.

15
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,367
That's what we'll do.

16
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,994
The British are moving up
from the south,

17
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,370
Patton is closing
in on the coast.

18
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,788
You know, we should
have left two days ago.

19
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,540
No, Colonel.

20
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,710
We keep fighting
until the final victory.

21
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,836
North Africa's lost,

22
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,379
and you're going to need
these men a year from now

23
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,131
to defend Berlin.

24
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,843
We can serve Germany
or the F黨rer, not both.

25
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,724
It's just that sort of talk
that had you sent here, Colonel.

26
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,935
What I said
was much worse.

27
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,271
General.

28
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,985
I'm just trying to get
these men out of here alive.

29
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,578
What would you
have me do?

30
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,288
Tell Command
we're low on water.

31
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,583
We'd have to reroute to
Mezzouna, join the 21st Panzer.

32
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,127
At least then
we'd have a chance.

33
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:19,341
And the records will show that we didn't
have enough water to reach Sidi Mansour?

34
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,176
I can guarantee it.

35
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,063
See that it's done.

36
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,023
General.

37
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,870
Up!

38
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,964
Down!

39
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,568
Hitler's leaving.
Now?

40
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,945
Ja. Fuse.

41
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,189
Colonel Brandt!
Colonel Brandt!

42
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,819
My regards to
Colonel Stieff.

43
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,322
Cointreau?

44
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,575
Let's hope I don't get
thirsty on the flight.

45
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,226
This is Tresckow.

46
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,865
He's landed.

47
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,499
This is General Tresckow.

48
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,461
Connect me with Operations,
Colonel Brandt.

49
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,381
Colonel! Tresckow.

50
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,885
I'm glad you arrived safely.
I hate to trouble you,

51
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,722
but it seems you have the wrong
bottles for Colonel Stieff.

52
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,600
You do still have
the package?

53
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,896
Oh, no, no, no.

54
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,815
As it happens, I've been
called to Berlin unexpectedly.

55
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,194
I can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up.

56
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,904
Sorry for the inconvenience, Colonel.

57
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,697
Yes, thank you.

58
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,243
Do you think he knows?

59
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,121
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

60
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,345
We've been discovered.
What makes you think that?

61
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,596
Oster's been arrested.

62
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,098
The Gestapo came
for him last night.

63
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,308
The Gestapo could have
arrested him for anything.

64
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,851
What do you think
went wrong?

65
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,687
We don't know.

66
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,605
Fuse. Temperature.
Altitude.

67
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,191
All I know is the damn
thing didn't go off.

68
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,162
General Tresckow to
see Colonel Brandt.

69
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,790
The Colonel's
expecting you, sir.

70
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,176
At ease.

71
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,146
You'll forgive me, General.

72
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,691
This little roundup has had
me writing reports all day.

73
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,027
Roundup?
Dissenters.

74
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,072
Another plot
against the F黨rer.

75
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,283
Who are these people?

76
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,663
You'd be surprised.

77
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:36,963
Now, is this
what you've come for?

78
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,182
Perhaps we should open it.

79
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,143
I beg your pardon?

80
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,103
Well, you've come
a long way.

81
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,439
You must be thirsty.

82
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,364
You know, I wonder how the
F黨rer, who does not partake,

83
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,826
would feel about a soldier
who did so on duty.

84
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,084
Colonel Brandt.

85
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,548
I took you for
another sort, General.

86
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,718
And I you.

87
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,814
We're still in business.

88
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,357
Find a replacement
for Oster.

89
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,984
There's no one we can
trust, not in Berlin.

90
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,570
Well, then stop
looking in Berlin.

91
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,975
Countess von Stauffenberg?

92
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,562
Perhaps before you go in, we could
have a word together in my office.

93
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,730
I will see
my husband now.

94
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,741
The right hand has been
amputated above the wrist.

95
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,537
He's missing the fourth and
fifth fingers on the left hand.

96
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,873
We couldn't save
the left eye.

97
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,974
Colonel.

98
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,228
When you're ready, sir.

99
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,731
I'm a soldier.
I serve my country.

100
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,860
But this is not my country.

101
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,824
I was lying out there bleeding
to death, thinking, "If I die now,

102
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,785
"I leave nothing to
my children but shame. "

103
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,083
I know now there's only
one way to serve Germany.

104
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:47,380
In doing so, I'll be a
traitor. I accept that.

105
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,051
Just tell me, can these
men see it through?

106
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:59,767
We need to reorganize. Reconsider
our strategy, recruit new men.

107
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,104
That's why we want you.

108
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,943
You understand what will
happen to my wife and children

109
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,487
if these men
can't see it through?

110
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,618
Come and hear what
they have to say.

111
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,592
You know where to find us.

112
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,039
Enough! Enough. I'm not going to
listen to another word of this.

113
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,333
You had your chance,
you failed.

114
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,961
Your so-called "central
solution" didn't work.

115
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,964
Our only option now is
to confront Hitler openly.

116
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,174
This is
a military operation...

117
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,425
It's not
a military operation,

118
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,760
it's a political
organization,

119
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,262
and one that's given its
military arm too much control.

120
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,430
In any
military exercise,

121
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,349
you have to expect a
certain measure of deviation.

122
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,144
A measure? A measure? What about
total, complete, utter failure?

123
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,438
Gentlemen, I think it's
time we face the fact

124
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,025
that the Allies are coming,
sooner or later.

125
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,611
I say we sit back and let
them wipe out the Nazis.

126
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,446
And ask every
living soul in Europe

127
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,906
to pay the price?
Use your head.

128
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,950
Carl, please.
I'm sorry, Ludwig.

129
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,618
I've held
my tongue too long.

130
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:44,330
We must confront Hitler
now. Force him out!

131
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,957
And then what?

132
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,252
I beg your pardon?

133
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,130
When Hitler is gone,
then what?

134
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,801
I'm sorry,
who is this man?

135
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,846
Colonel Stauffenberg
is Oster's replacement.

136
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,432
He's been transferred to my
office at the War Ministry.

137
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,893
How's your uncle?

138
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,812
He's well, sir.
He sends his regards.

139
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,522
He speaks very
highly of you.

140
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,315
And of you, General.

141
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,776
Of course, one of the things that
made Oster such a great organizer

142
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,154
was that he kept
his opinions to himself.

143
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,868
I'm simply asking what you
intend to do when Hitler is gone.

144
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,996
You don't really believe you could
just walk into the Reich Chancellery

145
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,331
and command the army
to end the war?

146
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,916
Yes. We do.

147
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,843
You are in the presence of men who
would have been Hitler's inner circle.

148
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,429
Instead,
we refused, Colonel.

149
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,974
The people know we put our
principles above personal gain.

150
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,477
We have the respect of
the people. And the army.

151
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,693
Then you don't need me.
Gentlemen.

152
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,158
Those men are confusing
respect with popularity.

153
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:07,330
The army swore an oath, an oath
that won't just die with Hitler.

154
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,539
What are you going to do?

155
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,042
How are you going to deal
with Goebbels? Himmler? The SS?

156
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,045
They will wipe you out!
It doesn't matter!

157
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,009
It only matters that we act,
now, before we lose the war.

158
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,305
Otherwise, this will
always be Hitler's Germany.

159
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,145
And we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him.

160
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,814
That is not enough for me.

161
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,693
There has to be
a chance of success.

162
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,863
Then find a way.

163
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,616
Poppy!
Poppy!

164
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,577
Poppy's home! Poppy's home!
Poppy's here! Poppy's here!

165
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,828
Mommy, he's here!

166
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,623
Mom, come down!
Poppy's here!

167
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,303
I thought we agreed I'd
come see you in Bamberg.

168
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,515
The children couldn't
wait. The children?

169
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,891
Super!

170
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,958
Valkyrie.

171
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,419
We've already considered
Valkyrie. It isn't suitable.

172
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,629
Not as it's currently written,
but the Colonel has an idea

173
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,922
I think we should consider.

174
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,257
Excuse me.
What is Valkyrie?

175
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,925
Operation Valkyrie.

176
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,303
The Reserve Army has thousands
of men all over Berlin.

177
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,931
Valkyrie is Hitler's
contingency plan

178
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,559
to mobilize those men
during a national emergency.

179
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,061
The sole purpose of the order
is to protect Hitler's government

180
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,521
if he's cut off
or killed.

181
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,273
And what use
is this to us?

182
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:06,026
Valkyrie is designed
to contain civil unrest.

183
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,863
But what if the SS
were staging a coup?

184
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,911
State Security is trying
to overthrow Hitler.

185
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,164
How would High Command respond?
We would have no choice.

186
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,957
We would declare a
military state of emergency.

187
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,750
Exactly,
and initiate Valkyrie.

188
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,712
Hitler's own Reserve Army,
using Hitler's own plan,

189
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,425
will have no choice but to seize power
in Berlin to prevent the SS takeover.

190
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,180
They'll think they're fighting for
Hitler's government, not against it.

191
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,558
While we quietly
put a new government in place.

192
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,895
But only if he's dead.

193
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,814
That's what you're
saying, isn't it?

194
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,401
How else are you going to convince
people the SS are trying to seize power?

195
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,361
We have to kill Hitler.

196
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm disappointed
in you, Colonel.

197
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,781
I thought a man
of your background

198
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,826
would suggest a more
honorable approach.

199
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:59,538
Your plan has a few
minor obstacles, Colonel.

200
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,000
Firstly, Valkyrie would have to
be rewritten to exclude the SS.

201
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,836
Then I'll need
your help to get a copy.

202
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,089
Rewriting an order
is one thing.

203
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,843
Distributing it is another.

204
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,220
In this case,

205
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,848
we'd be willfully circulating
written evidence of high treason.

206
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,601
Evidence requiring
Hitler's signature.

207
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,193
Well, we can all draw
straws for that job.

208
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,111
And what about Fromm?

209
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,363
Fromm? Who is Fromm?

210
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,073
He's the commander
of the Reserve Army.

211
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,866
I can put the reserve troops on alert,

212
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,452
but only Fromm
can initiate Valkyrie.

213
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,874
Can you get to him?

214
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,297
We're running out of time.
Can you get to Fromm?

215
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,590
He's a careerist pig.

216
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,260
But one who's gone as far as
he can go in Hitler's army.

217
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,387
It's no secret he's not happy about it.

218
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,390
Offer him a key position
in the new regime.

219
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,059
Make him see the light.

220
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,528
Your office
is through there.

221
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,534
I have Colonel Stauffenberg
for General Fromm.

222
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,702
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.

223
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,453
Welcome back to
the War Ministry.

224
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,663
It's an honor, sir.

225
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,748
You're an old woman, Fromm!

226
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,083
I'd send you to the front

227
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,585
if I didn't think
you'd surrender

228
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,045
just to be
Montgomery's whore!

229
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,844
The General
will see you now.

230
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,194
What is it you want?

231
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,365
I wanted to introduce our
new man, Colonel Stauffenberg.

232
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,369
Ah! From Africa.

233
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,832
I... I'd offer you my hand,
but I might not get it back.

234
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,463
I'd say the General has lost more
important things this morning.

235
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,889
It's about time they put somebody
with balls into this office.

236
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,724
Please, sit down, Colonel.

237
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,643
And you, Olbricht,
if you must.

238
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,991
They tell me you're
critical of the war, Colonel,

239
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,619
not that you don't seem
to have good reason.

240
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,663
I am critical of indecision, General.

241
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,748
In the field?
In Berlin.

242
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,170
So that's why you're
here, I take it, to...

243
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,421
To make decisions.

244
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,256
I've already
made my decision.

245
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,926
I'm here to help
others make theirs.

246
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,225
They say when there's
no clear option,

247
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,811
the best thing
is to do nothing.

248
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:12,106
We're at war.
We must act.

249
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,108
Sometimes rashly.

250
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,613
And what rash action did
you have in mind, Colonel?

251
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,953
That would be a decision for the
supreme military commander, sir.

252
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,539
A supreme commander.

253
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,877
Second only to
the Chancellor.

254
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,260
If I were that man,

255
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,515
this war would be
going quite differently.

256
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,601
Well, we were thinking
the same thing.

257
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,238
I don't need to remind you

258
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,659
that we've all sworn an oath

259
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,747
to the F黨rer.

260
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,591
Having said that, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place,

261
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,092
in the strict understanding

262
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,012
that such talk never occurs
again under this roof.

263
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,722
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.

264
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,599
Now, you can tell
your friends, Colonel,

265
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,268
that I always come down
on the right side.

266
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:36,148
And as long as the F黨rer is
alive, you know what side that is.

267
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,741
Heil Hitler.

268
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,868
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.

269
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,736
Of course! Yes!
Very good guess!

270
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,471
You realize how close
I am to Hitler.

271
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,266
With one word I can make you disappear.

272
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,018
My associates don't know
we've been talking,

273
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,144
if that's what
you're afraid of.

274
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,187
When the SS catch you,

275
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,607
they will pull you apart
like warm bread.

276
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,652
It will be a crime just
to have known you then.

277
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:07,197
I warn you, don't try
to contact me again.

278
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,782
You won't report me.

279
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,368
Maybe if you had when
I first approached you,

280
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:14,830
you might have been
keeping your oath.

281
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,373
Now you're just as
guilty as the rest of us.

282
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,792
And you think that makes
me a sympathizer, hey?

283
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,503
Give a man a choice of betraying
his fellow officer or his F黨rer

284
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,089
and you think his actions
will show you his heart.

285
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,092
It is not that simple.
Yes. Yes, it is.

286
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,888
For the last time, don't
push me to make a decision.

287
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,640
I don't have a choice.
It's clear now.

288
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,437
Without you, there
is no hope of success.

289
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,523
You're nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship!

290
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,942
What makes you think
you'll be any different?

291
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,570
What makes you think you're
stronger than the people, the Reich?

292
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,238
The very momentum
of history!

293
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,573
This is going to happen.

294
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:53,118
Action is inevitable,
as are the consequences.

295
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,703
When they come for me,
I'll do everything I can

296
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,371
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it,

297
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,165
but don't delude yourself.

298
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,292
You were involved in a
crime against your country

299
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,294
long before you met me.

300
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,382
There may still be time
to redeem yourself.

301
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,013
Only God can
judge us now.

302
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,939
Hitler had
Operation Valkyrie designed

303
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,775
to completely secure his
government in six hours.

304
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:29,488
I'm rewriting the order so we can seize
control of the government in three.

305
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,239
As written, the order
spreads reserve troops

306
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,742
across all of Germany's
19 military districts,

307
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:37,871
including occupied cities
like Paris, Vienna and Prague.

308
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,665
This is a waste
of resources.

309
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:43,627
Since all of these districts follow
orders from Berlin without question,

310
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,129
you take Berlin,
you take Germany.

311
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,132
I'm rewriting Valkyrie

312
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,842
to direct the majority
of our strongest units

313
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,095
to focus
entirely on Berlin.

314
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,722
We'll surround
the government quarter,

315
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,891
occupy all SS
and police barracks.

316
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,601
Once we have control
of the government,

317
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,396
we'll shut down
all concentration camps.

318
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,148
Any officers who resist
will be arrested or shot.

319
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,734
I've been transferred
to the front.

320
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,572
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

321
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,492
You know these orders
better than anyone.

322
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,162
That's why I'm putting you in charge
of the military wing of the operation.

323
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,372
Beck agrees.

324
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,540
Why not Olbricht?

325
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,710
No. It's your plan. It's you.

326
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,921
One more thing. You need
to be absolutely certain

327
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,007
no conflicting orders
get out after the flash.

328
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,592
It is not enough
to kill Hitler.

329
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,428
We need to isolate
his chain of command

330
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,055
and cut them off from the
outside world immediately.

331
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,017
Yes, I've already
considered that.

332
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,893
I think I have just
the man who can help.

333
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,812
Who is he?

334
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,314
Perhaps it's better
I don't say.

335
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,238
You know, God promised Abraham
he would not destroy Sodom

336
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,700
if he could find
just 10 righteous men.

337
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,537
I have a feeling that, for
Germany, it may come down to one.

338
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,462
Let's begin.

339
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,257
"The F黨rer, Adolf Hitler,

340
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,595
"is dead. "

341
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,479
Heil Hitler, General.

342
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:31,943
Would you excuse us,
please? Thank you.

343
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,245
You play the part
of bureaucrat beautifully.

344
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,914
It's the only time
I get to relax.

345
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:47,542
You've been promoted Chief
of Staff for the Reserve Army.

346
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,754
Excuse me?
Congratulations.

347
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,967
I am busy with other
things. Unfortunately,

348
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,596
your nocturnal activities don't
count as service to the Reich.

349
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,806
I'll refuse the promotion.

350
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,016
You'll do no such thing.

351
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,685
Tresckow may have left you
in charge of the operation,

352
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,604
but in this world
I still outrank you.

353
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,107
You will accept
the promotion.

354
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,150
You'll have real
access to Hitler,

355
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,362
his advisers, his
schedule. We need this.

356
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,034
I've looked through
your changes to Valkyrie.

357
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,161
I approve.

358
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,830
I'll need you to get
Hitler to sign it.

359
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,712
Now. There's a man here
to interview as your adjutant.

360
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,965
He comes highly recommended.

361
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,306
Close the door.

362
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,020
Be seated.

363
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,819
Do you know how this war
will end, Lieutenant?

364
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,780
The portrait
will be unhung,

365
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,075
and the man will be hung.

366
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,794
I'm engaged in high treason
with all means available to me.

367
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,629
Can I count you in?

368
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,098
For anything, sir.
Anything at all.

369
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,661
Come. Come, come.

370
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,212
Colonel Brandt, Operations.

371
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:42,259
Colonel Stauffenberg, I'd like to
review your presentation to the F黨rer.

372
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,385
Strictly routine.

373
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,761
Sir, the contents
of the Colonel's bag

374
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:45,929
are for the F黨rer's
eyes only.

375
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,056
I am the F黨rer's eyes,
Lieutenant.

376
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,225
The Colonel is a member of
my staff at the War Ministry.

377
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,352
He doesn't answer to you.

378
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,816
They're waiting.
This way.

379
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,147
My F黨rer. May I present
Colonel Stauffenberg,

380
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,150
our new chief of staff
for the Reserve Army.

381
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,569
Heil, my F黨rer.

382
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,452
May I say what an honor
it is to meet an officer

383
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:55,248
who has sacrificed
so much for Germany.

384
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,215
If only more of my men
were like you.

385
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,219
Let this man stand as
an example to all of you.

386
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,097
He is the ideal
German officer.

387
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,354
My F黨rer. Colonel Stauffenberg
was asked to come here today

388
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,483
to brief us on mobilizing
troops of the Reserve Army to...

389
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,443
To repel the invasion.

390
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,363
Invasion?

391
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,450
At Normandy, my F黨rer.

392
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,745
Oh, yes.

393
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,748
Normandy.

394
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,043
That will not
be necessary.

395
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:46,174
Reichsmarschall G鰎ing assures me that
everything is completely under control.

396
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,720
Thank you, Colonel.

397
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,893
My F黨rer, if I may.

398
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,939
I have an amended copy of Operation
Valkyrie for your approval.

399
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,534
You know your Wagner, Colonel?

400
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:05,378
The Valkyrie.
Handmaidens of the Gods,

401
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:10,550
choosing who will live and who
will die, sparing the most heroic

402
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,387
from an agonizing death.

403
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,729
One cannot understand
National Socialism

404
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,108
if one does not
understand Wagner.

405
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,128
I'm sure whatever changes
you've made are for the best.

406
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,386
You're dismissed. Send
your man home. And, Fromm?

407
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,098
Have some fresh tea
brought in, will you?

408
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,364
I don't know what you're brewing
up, and I don't want to know.

409
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,241
But when
the music stops,

410
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,827
I'd be obliged if Keitel
found himself without a chair.

411
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,343
Any problem on Earth
can be solved

412
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,721
with the careful application
of high explosives.

413
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:42,183
The trick is not to be
around when they go off.

414
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,228
Two 975-gram
packs of Plastit W.

415
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,730
Enough explosive
to cripple a panzer.

416
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,484
Your detonators, your
fuses. British time pencils.

417
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,613
This acid capsule is your
trigger. When you're ready to arm,

418
00:42:55,698 --> 00:43:00,577
attach the detonator to the
bottom of the time pencil, like so,

419
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,497
insert the entire device into
either end of the Plastit W,

420
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:08,668
crush the acid capsule,
and you're live.

421
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:14,924
When the acid eats through the
wire holding back the firing pin,

422
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,677
well, you'll want
to be very far away.

423
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,181
For you.

424
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,975
How much time
will we have?

425
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,768
Theoretically
there's a 30-minute delay,

426
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,271
but with the kind of heat you
can expect at the Wolf's Lair,

427
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,523
I'd give you
10, 15 minutes, tops.

428
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,483
That's hardly precise.

429
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,029
This is state-of-the-art. You can
have small or precise, not both.

430
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,281
Might this just be
a little too small?

431
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,743
No. Hitler's bunker
will magnify the blast.

432
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,788
It is constructed of reinforced
concrete. Steel door, no windows.

433
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,208
The air pressure generated by just one
of these explosives in a space like that

434
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,044
will kill everyone
instantly.

435
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,379
The second charge
will be entirely redundant.

436
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:57,300
Lf, by some miracle, Hitler
does survive, what then?

437
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,719
We still initiate Valkyrie.

438
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,138
At that point, there
will be no turning back.

439
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,390
But we'll have
an advantage.

440
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,144
We have an inside man
at the Wolf's Lair.

441
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:11,105
After the flash, he'll cut off
communication with the outside world.

442
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,483
While Hitler's inner circle
is struggling to regroup,

443
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:17,278
we'll have the momentum we
need to seize control in Berlin.

444
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,573
Himmler is expected to be
at the meeting as well.

445
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,493
Don't proceed unless
you can get them both.

446
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,078
What?

447
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:29,707
Don't proceed unless you're confident
you can get both Himmler and Hitler.

448
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,091
This is Goerdeler, isn't it?

449
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,847
I'll hold off, if the
decision is unanimous,

450
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,893
but I want another man on the
committee. Not a politician.

451
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,270
Who?
Him.

452
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,232
Him?
Him.

453
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,275
Fine.

454
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,822
But remember,
this is a military operation.

455
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,450
Nothing ever goes
according to plan.

456
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,441
I'll take the children
to Bamberg.

457
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,824
If I fail,

458
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,329
they'll come for you.

459
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,458
All of you.

460
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,546
I know.

461
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,283
Gentlemen.
Good morning.

462
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:31,287
Hitler has scheduled a military
briefing for today at 1:00.

463
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,873
Stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present.

464
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,709
They're here. Before
arming the explosives,

465
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,670
Stauffenberg will call
for authorization to proceed.

466
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,964
After the flash,
his inside man

467
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,634
will sever all communications.

468
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,220
Assuming Fromm
refuses to join us,

469
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,472
Olbricht would take command
of the Reserve Army

470
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,474
and initiate Valkyrie.
Initiate Valkyrie.

471
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,226
Then he'll notify
all district commanders

472
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,895
that the SS is attempting
to seize power.

473
00:46:55,979 --> 00:47:00,399
The Reserve Army will arrest all
SS, Gestapo and Nazi officials.

474
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,652
By then, Stauffenberg
will have returned to Berlin

475
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:05,154
and taken command
of the Reserve Army.

476
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,908
Witzleben and I will assume the
roles of commander of the armed forces

477
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,493
and head of state.

478
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,744
With Berlin secured,

479
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,872
Dr. Goerdeler will address the
nation as our new chancellor.

480
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,792
Then, God willing,

481
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,044
we can negotiate a truce
with the Allies

482
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,755
and save Europe from
total destruction.

483
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,010
This will identify you
as a member of the operation.

484
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,389
Nobody gets in or out of
the perimeter without one.

485
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,978
Gentlemen, this is the most
important day of your lives.

486
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,149
Long live sacred Germany.

487
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,230
Captain.
What is it?

488
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,982
An order from General Olbricht's office.

489
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,610
It's calling the Reserve Army
for some sort of standby action

490
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:29,322
in all the military
districts, including Berlin.

491
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,158
Looks like a drill of some
kind. Send it through, Sergeant.

492
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,512
Sir?

493
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,897
"Standby action"?
What the hell for?

494
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,357
The order doesn't say.

495
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:09,111
Assemble the men.
This better not be a drill.

496
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:54,341
The men are assembled
and awaiting further orders.

497
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,386
What do you suppose
this is really all about?

498
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,738
Your man?

499
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,417
He is now.

500
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,206
Colonel.

501
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,761
Attention!

502
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,319
Gentlemen. For our
first order of business,

503
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,946
General Fromm
will present his plans

504
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:29,825
for the reallocation of troops from
the Reserve Army on the eastern front.

505
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,870
Now, as you know, last night the
Russians launched a new offensive

506
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:36,999
against Army Group North Ukraine
in the South Poland section.

507
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:40,210
General Harpe was brought
in to replace Model

508
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,005
and bring a swift end
to this confrontation.

509
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,423
Himmler is not here.

510
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,799
Hence the transfer
of three divisions

511
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:50,471
to fortify
General Harpe's troops.

512
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:55,684
Now, these divisions will
stick to a mobile defense plan

513
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,062
rather than holding
any one particular...

514
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,320
Yes, sir. I'll put that
right through. Connecting now.

515
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,447
Operator. Direct me to the War Ministry.

516
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,199
General Olbricht's office.
One moment, please.

517
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,326
Yes, sir.
Connecting now.

518
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,289
General Olbricht's office.

519
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,457
Himmler's not
in the briefing.

520
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,167
I'm ready to arm.
Permission to proceed.

521
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,211
Hold the line.

522
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:26,173
Stauffenberg says Himmler's not at
the briefing. He wants to proceed.

523
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,591
Call Beck.

524
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,387
Beck.

525
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,055
Himmler is not
at the briefing.

526
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,809
Himmler's not
at the briefing.

527
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,071
Already
diminished reserves.

528
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,075
No.

529
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,414
They say no.

530
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,502
What do you say?

531
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,758
I say do it.

532
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,010
Attention!

533
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:50,591
Whatever it was, Colonel,
I hope it was important.

534
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,512
Colonel? Your bag.

535
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,582
This has been a drill!
You're dismissed!

536
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,964
How dare you put the Reserve Army
on standby without my knowledge?

537
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,674
Damn near cost me
my commission.

538
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,385
And what in God's name made you
think you even had the authority?

539
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,887
It was only a drill,
an exercise.

540
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,765
Oh, don't lie, Olbricht!
Not to me.

541
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:41,892
We both know it
wasn't a drill.

542
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,018
General, if I may...

543
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,478
No, you may not, Colonel.

544
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,188
You may not do anything.

545
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,357
Because not only have you
proved to me you can't deliver,

546
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,109
you've painted
a target on my back.

547
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:55,155
If I so much as sense you trying
to move the Reserve Army again,

548
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,075
I will personally
have you both arrested.

549
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,163
Do I make myself
abundantly clear?

550
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,040
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

551
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,505
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.

552
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,926
I'll hear you
say it, Colonel.

553
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,520
Heil Hitler!

554
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,576
The point of replacing Hitler is to
negotiate a truce with the Allies.

555
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,078
The Allies, I suspect, would
be more amenable to a truce

556
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,206
if we offer it to them before
they get to fucking Berlin!

557
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,668
There's no point in killing Hitler
unless you kill Himmler, too.

558
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,254
Why remove a madman just to
have a lunatic take his place?

559
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:55,090
Today's failure had nothing to
do with Himmler, and you know it.

560
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,802
This is a military operation in the
hands of a politician, nothing more.

561
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,221
What are you suggesting?
I'm not suggesting anything.

562
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,307
I'm stating the facts
as I see them.

563
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,850
You don't have the
courage to kill Hitler,

564
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,351
so you are making
the task impossible.

565
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,563
Nothing seemed to stop you and your
henchman from trying it on your own.

566
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,815
My only regret is that I waited
for you to find your backbone.

567
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,985
I don't think I'm alone when I
say your judgment is in question.

568
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,987
I'd like to call a vote.
Carl.

569
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:20,407
I propose that we relieve
Colonel Stauffenberg.

570
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,620
Carl, can I have a word
with you in private?

571
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,623
No, Ludwig. If you've got
something to say, say it.

572
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:31,126
Very well. I heard from the
Chief of Police this evening

573
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,463
that Himmler has issued
a warrant for your arrest.

574
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,801
You have to leave
Germany tonight.

575
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:42,929
When we succeed with
the central solution,

576
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,474
you'll return
as chancellor.

577
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:49,311
Disappear, Carl.
Avoid contact with anyone.

578
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,286
Good luck, Colonel.

579
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,961
No more indecision.

580
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,631
From now on, Stauffenberg
has full discretion.

581
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,842
I can't issue the alert again
unless we follow through.

582
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:24,179
I'll do my job.
You just take Berlin.

583
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:32,896
Hold on, sir.

584
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,314
I'll try to connect
you right now.

585
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,774
Thank you.

586
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,442
Hello?
Hello?

587
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,070
Hello?

588
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,282
Hello?

589
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:50,205
I'm sorry, sir. There is bombing
in Ebingen. We've been disconnected.

590
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,250
Ebingen is a long
way from Bamberg.

591
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,210
I'm sure your family is safe.

592
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,628
Thank you.

593
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,145
Welcome, Colonel.

594
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,398
Do you have a place
where I could change, Major?

595
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:42,734
Please follow me.

596
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,077
At least put the Reserve Army
on standby alert.

597
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,162
Not until I've heard from
Stauffenberg. Not until I'm sure.

598
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:57,707
But that's not what he...
Noted, Colonel. Thank you.

599
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:12,180
The meeting has been
moved up to 12:30.

600
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:15,141
Mussolini is arriving
on the afternoon train.

601
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,519
The F黨rer wants to have
lunch with him. Yes, sir.

602
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:21,022
Will Mussolini be joining us
in the briefing, sir?

603
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,440
I only wish he were.

604
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,151
Then some ambitious officer
might take the opportunity

605
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,362
to shoot that dago bastard.

606
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,950
Excuse me, General. I'm
expecting an important call.

607
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,244
Could you please have
someone come and get me?

608
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:37,038
Even if I'm with
the F黨rer.

609
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,708
Of course, Colonel.
Thank you, sir.

610
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,252
Colonel.

611
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,829
Major Freyend speaking.

612
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,592
Colonel?
They insist you hurry.

613
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,637
The briefing's
about to begin.

614
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,889
One moment,
please, Major.

615
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,439
Ten minutes. Two for the
walk, one for the checkpoint,

616
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:47,025
one for the bunker,
six to get out.

617
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,194
Plenty of time.

618
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,991
Excuse me, Colonel.

619
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:59,996
Sir! The F黨rer's
at the briefing!

620
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,296
The Colonel
is changing, Major.

621
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:15,095
You understand this can
be difficult. Of course.

622
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,653
Plenty of time.

623
01:06:56,637 --> 01:06:59,347
Get the car.
But, sir...

624
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,100
I have everything
I need. Get the car.

625
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,797
I can manage this.

626
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,645
Where are they going?
It's too hot.

627
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,982
The briefing has been moved
to the conference hut.

628
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,926
Major, my injuries
have left me hard of hearing.

629
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,386
Would you place me as close
to the F黨rer as possible?

630
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:21,429
I'll see what I can do.

631
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,555
...against the Red Army.

632
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:25,850
Not only have they been
advancing from the east,

633
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:30,355
but they're coming down on the northern
and the southern fronts as well.

634
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:35,360
As you can see, my F黨rer, if
the enemy continues at this rate,

635
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,863
the situation in the East
Prussian sector is critical.

636
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:43,201
Lack of supplies is continuing
to weaken our main units,

637
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,286
and reserves are
severely depleted.

638
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:48,373
My F黨rer, you remember
Colonel Stauffenberg?

639
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,924
As you are all aware,

640
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:01,886
in the past two days alone, the
10th Army has given up Ancona,

641
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,973
the 14th Division has
been pushed out of Livorno.

642
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:08,810
Army Group Center has already
lost 28 of their 40 divisions.

643
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,730
That is a total of
almost 350,000 men.

644
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:21,865
Since the Red Army first
attacked nearly a month ago,

645
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:25,243
our troops have already been
pushed back to the Polish border.

646
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,204
Conference hut.

647
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,833
This, compounded with the
loss of the 4th Army in Minsk,

648
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,878
threatens the entire
eastern perimeter. Yes, sir.

649
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:38,339
We must consider pulling men
from Army Group North Ukraine,

650
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,924
as well as the Romanian...

651
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,724
...and prevent
further losses.

652
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:50,810
Unless we can quickly
dispatch new blocking divisions

653
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,938
at vital points
along the German right,

654
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,356
Army Group
will be swallowed...

655
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,066
Colonel. There's a
telephone call for you.

656
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,526
...by the enemy in
less than a fortnight.

657
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:02,405
And we run the risk of losing all
the ground we have managed to gain

658
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:06,326
in the last three years.
Our spearhead...

659
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,454
General Fellgiebel, sir.
He says it's urgent.

660
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:15,376
Yes, General,
this is Stauffenberg.

661
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:23,092
...Russian air activity has proven just
as impregnable as their ground force.

662
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,303
Why?
My F黨rer...

663
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:35,438
In some areas they
outnumber us seven to one.

664
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:38,274
If we can afford
to give ground

665
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,777
along the Italian
front, I further...

666
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,032
One thing is certain,

667
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:49,869
the Red Army will continue
an aggressive push west,

668
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:50,995
even at the expense...

669
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,502
In order to
rebuild at this...

670
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:06,261
...already southwest
of D黱aburg

671
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:09,180
and closing on
Army Group at Lake Peipus.

672
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:13,726
If they are not immediately
withdrawn, it will be a catastrophe.

673
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39,210
Get in. Drive.

674
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,673
I have orders
from the F黨rer. Drive.

675
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,634
Drive! Drive!

676
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,597
As you were.

677
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:26,507
Get me the War Ministry.
General Olbricht. Olbricht!

678
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,343
The call is urgent!

679
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,015
General Olbricht's office.

680
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:35,641
I'm calling
from the Wolf's Lair

681
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,436
with an urgent message
for General Olbricht.

682
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,523
Something terrible has
happened. The F黨rer is...

683
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,152
Fellgiebel?

684
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,364
Sever all communications.

685
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,115
Sir?
Just do it!

686
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:58,289
Well, what did he say?
I couldn't be sure.

687
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,751
Well, get him
back on the line.

688
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:06,339
Sir, the bomb did go off.
That much was clear.

689
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:09,467
Fellgiebel's next step will be
to sever all communications.

690
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:21,979
Sorry, Colonel.
No one gets in or out.

691
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,314
We have an order
from the F黨rer.

692
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,566
We have to get to the airfield
immediately. Open the gate.

693
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:27,402
I'm very sorry, but my
orders are to keep the gate...

694
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,320
I just gave you
an order, Sergeant.

695
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:31,322
Sir!

696
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,574
Sir. Excuse me.

697
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:44,252
Colonel Stauffenberg
for Field Marshal Keitel.

698
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,051
Colonel Stauffenberg
was explicit.

699
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,719
We initiate
Valkyrie regardless.

700
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,430
Only Fromm can initiate.
You know that.

701
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,597
Then tell him
Hitler's dead.

702
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,391
Or arrest him.
But do it now.

703
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:02,311
Sir, you have to give the order to
initiate Valkyrie. This is our only...

704
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,480
I'm not doing anything
until I hear from Fellgiebel.

705
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,815
Get him back
on the phone now.

706
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:08,276
Every second we stand here
arguing is a second lost.

707
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,777
The risk is too great.

708
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,780
What about Stauffenberg?
What about his risk?

709
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:15,199
He did his part, and now
you're abandoning him.

710
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,119
Field Marshal, sir.
Stauffenberg here.

711
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:19,787
A Sergeant...

712
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,122
Kolbe, sir.

713
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:22,832
What?
Kolbe.

714
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:25,460
...Kolbe won't let me
pass the main gate.

715
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,587
Yes, sir, I explained that.

716
01:14:27,671 --> 01:14:30,423
Perhaps you can make
him understand, sir.

717
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:38,389
Everything's fine now, sir.
Thank you.

718
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,227
Open the gate!

719
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,654
At least put the Reserve Army on alert.

720
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,323
When Stauffenberg returns,

721
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:59,660
when he gives me confirmation that
Hitler is dead, then we'll proceed.

722
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:07,418
And where are you going?

723
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,004
The same place
as you are. Lunch.

724
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,191
Another standby alert.

725
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,655
Send it through.
But keep me informed.

726
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,557
Sir. Another standby order.

727
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:33,230
In ancient Greece, you would
have been killed for this.

728
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,525
Lucky for you we've evolved.

729
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:41,530
Assemble the men.

730
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:32,248
Quiet, isn't it?

731
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:36,794
I'll see where
our driver is.

732
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,674
This is von Haeften. The Colonel
and I are at the airfield.

733
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:43,300
There's no car.
There's no one here.

734
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:48,806
You mean to tell me the
alert's only just gone out?

735
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,308
This is Stauffenberg.
Get me General Olbricht.

736
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,318
What's this?

737
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:09,869
Explain this! Someone
had to do something

738
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:10,953
while you were
playing dead!

739
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:12,079
We don't know that
Hitler is not alive.

740
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:15,249
This is about Germany,
for God's sake, not you!

741
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,678
General Olbricht's office.

742
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:30,431
Colonel Stauffenberg.
For you, sir.

743
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,565
This is Olbricht. It's
been three hours, Olbricht.

744
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:40,900
What the hell
have you been doing?

745
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:43,319
We've had no confirmation
that Hitler was dead.

746
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:49,867
Damn it! I saw the explosion
myself! We are committed.

747
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,370
Dear God. Now, where
is Fromm? Is he with us?

748
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,166
Is he with us? No one
has spoken to him yet.

749
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:13,307
You listen to me. Never mind
Germany. Never mind Europe.

750
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,643
Your life is at stake now.

751
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:18,145
And if you want to live through the
night, you'll do exactly as I say.

752
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:19,522
The second you
hang up the phone,

753
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,273
initiate Valkyrie
in Fromm's name.

754
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:24,401
Give him the choice to join us, or
place him under immediate arrest.

755
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:26,362
Do you understand?
Yes.

756
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:27,947
I'll be in Fromm's
office in 15 minutes.

757
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,406
Be there when I arrive.

758
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,483
Call Beck and the others.
Tell them it's time.

759
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,533
Put me through
to Communications.

760
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:15,035
This is General Olbricht,

761
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:17,204
calling on behalf
of General Fromm,

762
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,373
commander of
the Reserve Army.

763
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:21,750
The F黨rer,
Adolf Hitler, is dead.

764
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,377
A group of radicals
in the SS

765
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,880
are attempting to seize
control of the government.

766
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,132
Initiate Operation Valkyrie.

767
01:22:04,502 --> 01:22:07,630
You have your orders.
Pass them along.

768
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:48,003
Battalion. Attention!

769
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,135
The F黨rer...

770
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,224
Our F黨rer, Adolf Hitler,

771
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:05,145
is dead.

772
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:07,815
Who told you
the F黨rer was dead?

773
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:10,109
General Fellgiebel.
At the Wolf's Lair.

774
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:15,614
There's no use calling. All
communication lines are down.

775
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:17,199
Yes. Get me
the Wolf's Lair.

776
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:18,784
One moment, sir.

777
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:24,331
Wolf's Lair.
May I connect you?

778
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,710
Yes. General Fromm for
Field Marshal Keitel. Urgent.

779
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:35,050
Keitel. Yes, I'm sorry
to disturb you, sir,

780
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:36,844
but I wonder if you could
tell me what's happening.

781
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:39,680
The most incredible rumors
are circulating in Berlin.

782
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,348
I don't know what you mean.

783
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,727
There's talk that the
F黨rer has been assassinated.

784
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,938
Another failed attempt.

785
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:51,108
The F黨rer was
never in danger.

786
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:54,570
By the way, where's
your man Stauffenberg?

787
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:59,199
Stauffenberg? He... On his way
back to Berlin, I would think.

788
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,203
Let me know when he arrives.
I'd like a word with him.

789
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,964
The F黨rer's fine. That is
a lie. Adolf Hitler's dead.

790
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,549
Operation Valkyrie
is in effect.

791
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:17,718
Only I can
initiate Valkyrie.

792
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:19,053
You did.

793
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:29,271
This is treason.

794
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:32,191
Right now, the Reserve Army's
assuming control of Berlin.

795
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:34,026
Are you with us or not?

796
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,695
Do you realize
what you've done?

797
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:38,822
The F黨rer is alive.
I delivered the bomb myself.

798
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,075
I saw the blast.
He is dead.

799
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:44,912
Are you with us?

800
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:46,413
I don't believe
this is happening.

801
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:49,792
This is some kind of a joke.
Are you with us or not?

802
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:52,461
Colonel, if what
you say is true,

803
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,172
you should shoot
yourself immediately.

804
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,590
The rest of you
are under arrest.

805
01:24:56,674 --> 01:24:58,383
No, General. You are.

806
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:07,267
I don't know where
you think this is going.

807
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,939
Get me Operations.

808
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:14,566
This is Colonel Stauffenberg.

809
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,111
Seal off the War Ministry
per Operation Valkyrie.

810
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:18,237
No one gets in or out

811
01:25:18,321 --> 01:25:20,781
without authorization from
General Olbricht's office.

812
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:40,509
General Beck.

813
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:42,970
You're not wearing
your uniform, sir.

814
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:46,140
This should be seen
as a movement of the people.

815
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:55,149
Colonel Stauffenberg?
Yes.

816
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,740
The chief has guaranteed the
full support of the Berlin Police.

817
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:09,454
You will have no interference
from my men. You have my word.

818
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:14,209
Thank you.

819
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:53,415
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
We are reporting for duty.

820
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,881
Thank you for coming.

821
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,264
Gentlemen, in three hours
I want confirmation

822
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,183
that the government
quarter is ours

823
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:14,645
and SS Command has been
cleared of every living soul.

824
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,564
You all know
what must be done.

825
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:20,943
By nightfall, I want to know
that Hitler's Germany

826
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:22,778
has seen its last sunrise.

827
01:27:54,727 --> 01:27:56,478
Yes, sir. All replacements
have been authorized.

828
01:27:56,562 --> 01:27:57,980
In fact,
Field Marshal Witzleben

829
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:00,023
has been appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces.

830
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:02,484
That's exactly why
he's been appointed.

831
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:03,694
If he was a member
of the Party,

832
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:05,112
he'd be locked up
as a suspect.

833
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:07,364
Yes, sir, I understand your
concern, but this is an emergency.

834
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,157
The commanding officer
at the 11 th District, please.

835
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,284
I need a decision, Major.

836
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,160
Tell your men that acts of
vengeance will not be tolerated.

837
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:14,371
Why hasn't anyone occupied
the Tegel broadcasting station?

838
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,039
Can I speak to the commanding
officer in Hannover, please?

839
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,291
We represent a different
form of government.

840
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,792
I'd be careful
who you said that to.

841
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:20,460
Loyalty to the Party
isn't what it used to be.

842
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:21,878
Yes, Paris. France.

843
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:23,338
Not since they
murdered the F黨rer.

844
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:24,965
And, Josef. Thank you.

845
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:26,383
You've made
the right decision.

846
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:29,553
District 13 is ours.

847
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,608
By order of Field Marshal von Witzleben,

848
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:46,903
you are under arrest
for crimes against the state.

849
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:57,998
This is Stauffenberg. I'm trying to
connect with Major-General Thadden.

850
01:28:58,082 --> 01:28:59,499
No, I've already spoken
to 413 Battalion.

851
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,209
You'll have no trouble
getting reinforcements.

852
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:03,170
The order explaining everything
will be in your hand shortly.

853
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,922
No, these are your orders.
Excellent.

854
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:10,510
My wife is in Bamberg
with my children.

855
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,012
Would you please try to
raise them on the phone?

856
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:14,139
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

857
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:16,099
General Schwedler has
issued the Valkyrie orders

858
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:17,225
and has sealed off
headquarters.

859
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,186
Good. Check on the radio
stations every 20 minutes

860
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:21,480
till we have confirmation they're ours.

861
01:29:33,993 --> 01:29:35,202
Well,
with all due respect, sir,

862
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:36,578
you can't believe
everything you hear.

863
01:29:36,662 --> 01:29:38,497
That is SS propaganda.
He's dead.

864
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:42,626
Only the commander of the Home
Army is authorized to give orders.

865
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,878
General? Sir.

866
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:47,714
Hello, Christian? Our men
in the transport offices

867
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,341
have secured the railway
communications network,

868
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:50,425
but there are
repeater stations...

869
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:52,386
Yes. I give you my word. ...
telephone and telegraph offices,

870
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,554
emergency broadcast
outposts. We need more men.

871
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,182
Thank you. Give my best to your family.

872
01:29:57,266 --> 01:29:58,725
He's with us.

873
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:00,852
Mertz? Call Potsdam.

874
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:03,355
Tell them to place all available
units under our control.

875
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:05,232
You have your men. Now
get control of the radio.

876
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:07,234
We have control
of the government quarter.

877
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:09,319
We don't have Berlin yet.

878
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:35,429
What is it now, Sergeant?
Arrest orders, sir.

879
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:37,389
One from Colonel Stauffenberg
in the War Ministry

880
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:40,100
to arrest Reich
Minister Goebbels.

881
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:42,102
The other is from
the Wolf's Lair,

882
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,187
to arrest
Colonel Stauffenberg.

883
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,903
Send them both through.

884
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,198
Our job is not to
interpret orders,

885
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:57,951
our job is to pass
them along, regardless.

886
01:30:58,035 --> 01:31:00,745
Yes, but... That will be all, Sergeant.

887
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,976
This is treason! You're
all going to pay for this!

888
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:25,061
Do you hear me?

889
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:39,826
New arrest orders, sir.

890
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,578
For Stauffenberg
and Goebbels.

891
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:45,165
Do we arrest them both?

892
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:48,710
I would hate to find out
I'm being taken advantage of.

893
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:50,545
You really think
it's a coup?

894
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:53,089
Of that I am certain.

895
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,967
What I can't say is
which side we're on.

896
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,345
Come with me.

897
01:31:58,429 --> 01:31:59,971
District 4,
Dresden and Leipzig.

898
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:01,431
District 12, Wiesbaden.
District 9...

899
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,141
They've had no trouble
getting reinforcements,

900
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:06,186
and I rely on you seeing
that this gets done.

901
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,899
I've just spoken
to Colonel Linstow.

902
01:32:10,983 --> 01:32:14,986
They've arrested 1,200 SS and
Gestapo officials in Paris.

903
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:16,655
Not a single shot fired.

904
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:18,406
Early reports
from Vienna are good.

905
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:20,825
I'm waiting on word
from Prague.

906
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,285
Incredible.

907
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,320
I'm ready to be connected.

908
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,795
Minister Goebbels?

909
01:33:14,046 --> 01:33:15,880
What can I do
for you, Major?

910
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:19,092
My battalion has an order to
blockade the government quarter

911
01:33:19,176 --> 01:33:21,303
and place you
under arrest.

912
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:27,684
Are you a dedicated
National Socialist, Major?

913
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:30,228
Yes, sir.

914
01:33:44,535 --> 01:33:48,330
Major Remer here.
Hello?

915
01:33:51,375 --> 01:33:53,418
Do you recognize my voice?

916
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,130
Yes, my F黨rer.

917
01:33:57,214 --> 01:33:59,341
Then listen to me
very carefully.

918
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,471
I want these traitors
taken alive.

919
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:08,350
Yes, my F黨rer.

920
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:14,856
You heard what he said.

921
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,317
The F黨rer wants
the traitors taken alive.

922
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:20,737
Yes, sir.

923
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:50,684
It's a coup, all right. We can't
afford to remain neutral any longer.

924
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:57,107
You have to make
a decision.

925
01:34:58,859 --> 01:35:02,195
When it's over, we better
wind up on the right side.

926
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:10,120
Very well.

927
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:14,874
Send through all communications
from the Wolf's Lair.

928
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:17,752
Stop all communications
from Stauffenberg.

929
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,468
Release these men!

930
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:29,180
But they're part
of the coup.

931
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:31,725
I've just been on the
phone with Hitler himself.

932
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,226
We are the coup,
you idiot.

933
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:34,978
We've been duped.

934
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:40,483
We've lost contact
with District 11.

935
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:45,739
The switchboard
is overloaded.

936
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:47,824
Give it 10 minutes
and try again.

937
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:55,039
Give me General Bieler,
District 11.

938
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:56,499
We still need...

939
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:58,293
I don't want to leave any
section... Keep trying.

940
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:02,130
Out of my way.
Where is General Fromm?

941
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:08,678
General Fromm is no longer
in command. I am.

942
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,389
Beck? What are you doing
here? What is going on?

943
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:12,974
The F黨rer is dead.

944
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:14,601
The SS are staging a coup.

945
01:36:14,685 --> 01:36:17,312
We've initiated Operation
Valkyrie to crush the uprising

946
01:36:17,396 --> 01:36:18,938
and save Hitler's Germany.

947
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:22,317
You will present the order
to your troops.

948
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:25,570
I will do no such thing until
I speak to General Fromm.

949
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:29,032
You will follow your orders,
or you are under arrest.

950
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:36,080
This is treason. I will take no
part. The F黨rer is not dead.

951
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,958
The F黨rer is not dead!
Stop him!

952
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:42,545
The F黨rer is not dead!
The F黨rer is not dead!

953
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:46,049
I have sworn an oath!
This is treason!

954
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:49,302
You all swore an oath!
Listen to what I have to say.

955
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:52,931
You are all making
a terrible mistake!

956
01:36:53,766 --> 01:37:00,230
The F黨rer is not dead!

957
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,234
Please try
my wife again.

958
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,786
Bamberg, please.

959
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,169
Take your hands off me!

960
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:30,218
Sir.

961
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,148
Over 215 enemy tanks
have been annihilated

962
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,150
in the past week alone.

963
01:37:46,235 --> 01:37:48,778
The air force, engaged in
low-flying offensives

964
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:51,364
on enemy concentrations...
Lieutenant.

965
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:52,490
I can't get through
to General Gerlach.

966
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:55,785
Send a runner down to his
office. Bring him here.

967
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:00,331
Yes, thank you.

968
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:02,792
Yes, this is Stauffenberg.

969
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,295
I was speaking to the General
about five minutes ago.

970
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:06,671
He told me
he'd return my call.

971
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:08,172
I've yet to
hear from him.

972
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:10,758
I trust everything in your
district is under control?

973
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:13,303
Hans,
I need your answer.

974
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:15,054
There's no more time
for indecision.

975
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:17,765
And the General knows
I'm waiting?

976
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,309
I'm ordering you to put him
on the phone immediately.

977
01:38:19,393 --> 01:38:21,227
The army gave their oath
to a liar, Hans.

978
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,562
Hello?

979
01:38:22,646 --> 01:38:23,897
One who's broken
his own oath...

980
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:26,357
Hello? ... to the people
a hundred times over.

981
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:28,276
Hans, listen to me...

982
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,847
This operation has been
terminated! Stand down!

983
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:06,814
Today, an attempt was
made on the F黨rer's life.

984
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:09,359
The F黨rer himself
suffered no major injuries

985
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:11,319
beyond light burns
and bruises.

986
01:39:11,403 --> 01:39:13,780
He resumed his work
immediately.

987
01:39:13,864 --> 01:39:16,449
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

988
01:39:16,533 --> 01:39:19,369
Colonel Brandt
and staff assistant Berger.

989
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,871
Lighter injuries were
sustained by General Jodl

990
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:25,083
and Generals Korten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger...

991
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:28,544
Send the following orders to
all Reserve Army commanders.

992
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:31,547
"Broadcast incorrect.
F黨rer is dead.

993
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:36,886
"Operation Valkyrie
still in effect. "

994
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:41,975
...and, as scheduled, received
Mussolini for an afternoon briefing.

995
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:44,769
Long live our F黨rer,
Adolf Hitler,

996
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:48,106
whom the almighty God
has so visibly blessed today.

997
01:39:51,944 --> 01:40:00,076
I saw the blast.

998
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:12,505
Today an attempt was made
on the F黨rer's life.

999
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:15,008
The F黨rer himself
suffered no major injuries

1000
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,093
beyond light burns
and bruises.

1001
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:18,261
I'm sorry.

1002
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:20,179
He resumed
his work immediately.

1003
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:23,016
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

1004
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:26,644
Colonel Brandt
and staff assistant Berger.

1005
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:29,772
Lighter injuries were
sustained by General Jodl

1006
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:33,443
and Generals Korten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger...

1007
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:41,576
Shortly after the attempt
on his life,

1008
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:44,203
the F黨rer was joined
by Reichsmarschall G鰎ing

1009
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:47,915
and, as scheduled, received
Mussolini for an afternoon briefing.

1010
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,544
Stay tuned for the F黨rer's
address to the German people.

1011
01:40:51,628 --> 01:40:52,962
My family?

1012
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,466
Our lines have been cut.

1013
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:01,763
I'm sorry.

1014
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,891
Go.

1015
01:41:05,434 --> 01:41:07,226
It's all right. Go.

1016
01:41:23,994 --> 01:41:26,954
General. Sir. We have
to get you out of here.

1017
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:55,751
Get him out of here.

1018
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:57,503
Stop!
Stand down!

1019
01:42:57,588 --> 01:42:59,922
I said stop!
I said stand down!

1020
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:28,993
Hold your fire!

1021
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:40,004
Colonel Stauffenberg?

1022
01:43:43,425 --> 01:43:46,385
By orders of the F黨rer,
you're under arrest.

1023
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:12,578
If you have any last messages
to your wives and children,

1024
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:14,497
I will hear them now.

1025
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:17,875
Very well.

1026
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,086
A court-martial convened by me
in the F黨rer's absence

1027
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:21,295
will pronounce sentence.

1028
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,256
Beck, you're under arrest.

1029
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:28,636
Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim,
General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften,

1030
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,930
and the Colonel whose name
I will not mention,

1031
01:44:31,014 --> 01:44:32,390
are condemned to death.

1032
01:44:32,474 --> 01:44:34,934
General. My orders are
to take these men alive.

1033
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:36,519
Noted, Major.

1034
01:44:38,146 --> 01:44:40,189
I'd like a pistol,
please.

1035
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:44,777
For personal reasons.

1036
01:45:03,088 --> 01:45:04,588
Get on with it.

1037
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:06,882
With all respect...
That will be all, Major.

1038
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:09,260
Killing us won't hide
your involvement.

1039
01:45:09,344 --> 01:45:12,596
My involvement? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1040
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:13,973
You knew and did nothing.

1041
01:45:14,057 --> 01:45:15,516
You're as guilty
as any of us.

1042
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,435
Spare me, Lieutenant.

1043
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:19,770
No one will be spared.

1044
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,413
I'm thinking of
earlier times.

1045
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:47,006
This is an outrage that has never
before been perpetrated here!

1046
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:49,842
A field marshal
and a general

1047
01:45:49,926 --> 01:45:52,136
declare that they could
do things better

1048
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,930
than he who is
the F黨rer of us all!

1049
01:45:55,015 --> 01:45:58,642
You confess to having said this? Yes.

1050
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:05,358
My fellow Germans.

1051
01:46:05,442 --> 01:46:08,110
I speak to you tonight
for two reasons.

1052
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:13,616
First, so that you can hear my
voice and know that I am unhurt.

1053
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:18,621
Second, so that you may know
the details of a crime

1054
01:46:18,705 --> 01:46:21,791
without parallel
in German history.

1055
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:26,045
A small clique of ambitious,
dishonorable officers

1056
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:28,464
have conspired
to eliminate me.

1057
01:46:29,966 --> 01:46:35,471
Except for a few bruises and
burns, I was completely untouched.

1058
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,809
I see in this
the hand of Providence,

1059
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:43,604
directing me
to complete my work.

1060
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,074
Look them in the eye.

1061
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:59,412
They'll remember you.

1062
01:46:59,496 --> 01:47:00,871
Olbricht!

1063
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:12,758
Make ready.

1064
01:47:28,191 --> 01:47:30,526
Well,
we have to show the world

1065
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:32,570
that not all of us
were like him.

1066
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:39,618
Safe! Stand!

1067
01:47:43,707 --> 01:47:44,874
Fire!

1068
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:47,543
Stand!

1069
01:48:08,857 --> 01:48:10,357
Stauffenberg!

1070
01:48:14,362 --> 01:48:17,781
The people know we put our
principles above personal gain.

1071
01:48:17,866 --> 01:48:19,241
Make ready!

1072
01:48:22,996 --> 01:48:24,079
Aim!

1073
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:42,473
Safe! Stand!

1074
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:52,358
You may hand us over
to the executioner,

1075
01:48:52,442 --> 01:48:54,068
but in three months' time,

1076
01:48:54,152 --> 01:48:58,030
the disgusted and harried
people will bring you to book

1077
01:48:58,114 --> 01:49:02,284
and drag you alive through
the dirt in the streets.

1078
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:05,204
Take him away.

1079
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:11,961
Make ready.

1080
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:15,422
Aim.

1081
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:18,551
Long live sacred Germany!
Fire!

1082
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,720
Stand.
