1
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:22,542
Morning.

2
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,208
Ward.

3
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,542
Red sauce? Green sauce?

4
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,500
Babe, you up?

5
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,250
It's after noon, you gotta get up.

6
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,458
I made some coffee, come on.

7
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,083
There he is.

8
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,083
- Morning.
- Afternoon.

9
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,958
- Hi.
- Hi.

10
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:13,875
Hi.

11
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,375
- Coffee.
- I know.

12
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,583
What the hell's this in my...

13
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,250
- What's that shit in there?
- What?

14
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,625
- Whoops.
- Yeah.

15
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,625
Ran out of coffee filters,
had to use a napkin.

16
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,875
- It'll be fine.
- I'll just chew that up next time.

17
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,167
Oh, come on.

18
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,750
Why is the Fairy in the bird feeder again?

19
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,125
- I... I thought...
- You told me that you killed it.

20
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,875
All right, I'm gonna be honest with you.
All right?

21
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,500
- Please.
- I don't fuck with no Fairies.

22
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,000
You need to fuck with that one.

23
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,917
When I was little, my cousin DayDay
was throwing rocks at this Fairy.

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,292
- The Fairy shit in his own hand...
- Uh-huh.

25
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,250
...threw the shit,
and it went in DayDay's eye,

26
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,000
and it was like a fucking cantaloupe.

27
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,125
- Bullshit story.
- No, he almost lost his eye.

28
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,292
- I'm telling you. Listen...
- That's not true.

29
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,042
$200. Pay the man.
Same man that does the bees.

30
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,583
No, I'm not paying $200.

31
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:03,750
I got this big, handsome, strapping man
standing right in front of me.

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,667
Go kill that Fairy, please.
Thank you so much.

33
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,500
I'll kill the Fairy.
Let me finish my coffee.

34
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,167
- I'mma kill the Fairy. All right?
- Okay.

35
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,250
That may kill you. You should do it
before you finish the coffee.

36
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,333
- How was work?
- Eh, work. Work is good, you know?

37
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:18,458
Just, a lot of stab wounds lately.
There's, uh...

38
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:21,792
We had this homeless guy come in,
throwing equipment everywhere.

39
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,958
It was wild.

40
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,583
A lot of traffic accidents,

41
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,875
<i>- and this older guy, he coded out on me.
- What about that cop that's an Orc</i>

42
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,292
<i>that's now on the LAPD force?</i>

43
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,042
<i>- How does that work?
- He's not blooded.</i>

44
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,167
<i>He's not part of any blooded clan.</i>

45
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:37,417
<i>He's like a finger
that got cut off the hand.</i>

46
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,792
<i>He's dead to us.</i>

47
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:42,708
This is shock trauma at its finest.

48
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:45,083
<i>...and then you see the humans
and the Elves...</i>

49
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,875
I don't want this guy in my car either.

50
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,167
Baby, I don't want you to get shot again.

51
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:58,125
Five years, I'm gonna retire.

52
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,792
But... I can't fuck up my pension.

53
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:07,708
All right? I mean,
that's my fucking worst nightmare.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,917
You know what my worst nightmare is?

55
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,792
It's them wheeling you in
when I'm at work.

56
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,750
That's my nightmare.

57
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,542
Come on. Come here.

58
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,250
Fairy. Now.

59
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey, y'all, I want y'all to trip off
my police-ass neighbor. He's a trip.

60
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,750
- Good afternoon, Officer.
- Hey. What up, Mike?

61
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,792
Yo, that Fairy been all up in my crib,

62
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,708
eating up my dog food and shit.

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,458
I'm about to call the city, man.

64
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,375
I am the city.

65
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,750
All right? You save your dime.

66
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,292
Fairy lives don't matter today.

67
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,458
Check this out, y'all.
This is probably gonna be good.

68
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,375
It's on now!

69
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,042
Ring the bell, y'all.

70
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,958
Oh!

71
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,250
Damn. Look at this nigga, man.

72
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,417
Oh, that's it right there.

73
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,667
Oh, you got it now. Take the homie out
LAPD-style like you do.

74
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,750
Oh!

75
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,250
You ain't gotta do him like that. Damn!

76
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,625
That was nasty.

77
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,292
- Man.
- Come on, G.

78
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:31,167
- It's what I do.
- Oh, shit.

79
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,542
Oh, and, uh, you keep doing
all your gangsta stuff.

80
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,417
I'm just trying to sell my house.
Don't worry about that.

81
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,958
Thanks for the show, Officer.

82
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:42,000
He's a trip. That motherfucker's crazy.
Got a fine-ass wife, too.

83
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:44,292
Are you in trouble?

84
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,792
Am I in trouble?
What your mother say to you?

85
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,083
Mom said that Nick got you in trouble
because Orcs are dumb.

86
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,875
That's not true, all right?
Orcs are not dumb.

87
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:58,375
Just, uh... All of the races
are-are different. Okay?

88
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:02,417
And just 'cause they're different
doesn't mean anybody's smarter

89
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,208
or dumber, you know,

90
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,458
better or worse than anybody.

91
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,375
All right? It's just-just...

92
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:11,833
You know, everybody's just trying
to get along and-and...

93
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:13,625
have a good life.

94
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:16,875
What the hell?

95
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,458
Hey, baby, you gotta take some clothes.
Get some clothes.

96
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,417
Fine.

97
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,625
Hey, hey!

98
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:23,875
Hey, partner.

99
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,708
Ready to get back to work? All healed up?

100
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:28,708
What the hell are you doing at my house?

101
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,958
Why are you at my house?
Why are you on my lawn?

102
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,292
Your lawn's dead, Ward.

103
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,125
Exactly. Which is why I seeded it

104
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,250
and spread cow shit everywhere
so it grows back.

105
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,583
That's not really cow shit.

106
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,000
- What do you mean it's not cow shit?
- It's sewage, from toilets.

107
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,250
From the treatment plant, swear to God.

108
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,875
I paid $400 for this.

109
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,750
- That's bullshit.
- Human shit.

110
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:50,125
- Why do you think I compost?
- Whatever. Whatever. Whatever.

111
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,333
You don't ever come here in that
ever again.

112
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:57,208
I was at diversity training. Your house
is on the way to the bar. I thought...

113
00:07:57,292 --> 00:08:00,167
- Hi, Nick.
- Hey, Sophia. What's up, rock star?

114
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,500
We're gonna go to Grandma's.

115
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,167
- Grandma's? Hop in, we'll give you a ride.
- Shut up.

116
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,292
- This ain't no Uber, man.
- Don't tell Nick to shut up.

117
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,750
He's a person, too.

118
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

119
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,208
That's an enlightened kid you got there,
Daryl.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,625
Don't worry about me.

121
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,708
Just Crip-walk your asses
on back to the barbecue.

122
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,958
Be nice to give you a ride...

123
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,958
- Shut up.
- ...on your first day back.

124
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,625
Lovely song.

125
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:52,542
There's Grandma.

126
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:54,708
Hey. Uh, I'm...

127
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,708
Okay. Good to see you.

128
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,833
Uh...

129
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,375
All right, baby. What's up?

130
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,125
What's happening? What's up?
Why you sad?

131
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:08,958
What happened?

132
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,458
I don't want you to die.

133
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,833
I'm not gonna die. What are you...

134
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:18,250
- What you talking about?
- Mama said Nick's gonna get you killed.

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,292
I don't know why she said...

136
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,500
Nick is not gonna get me killed,
all right?

137
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,833
Why do you have to be a policeman?

138
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,208
Everybody hates policemen.

139
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,250
Hey...

140
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,167
Know what?
You smell like you haven't slept.

141
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,750
I have melatonin in my war bag.
You take one before bed,

142
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,458
- turn off the laptop, get...
- Maybe I'm having trouble sleeping

143
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:02,000
because of the nightmares I'm having

144
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,500
from being blasted across the street
with a shotgun

145
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,458
while your ass was getting a burrito.

146
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,542
But I was getting a burrito for you.

147
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,542
- Yeah...
- I don't eat cow flesh.

148
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,125
Do you think that you could get a burrito

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,125
and do your job?

150
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,875
You think you could get a burrito
and watch my back

151
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,542
- like every other cop manages to do?
- Yes.

152
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,875
Look, I know... you're disappointed in me.

153
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,792
I know that you think that I let you down.

154
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,542
- Yeah. You know what?
- But I...

155
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,792
You know what? It's a new day.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,917
Back to work. We hitting the reset button.

157
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,792
Copy that. Copy that.
We're hitting the reset button.

158
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,500
Moving forward together.

159
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,542
As friends, together.

160
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,542
We will not be listening
to no Orkish music.

161
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,875
That is one of the greatest love songs
ever written.

162
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,750
That's a love song in prison.

163
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,083
I believe that you're lacking in love,
Ward.

164
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:05,208
- I'm what?
- By love, I mean...

165
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,542
like... physical love.

166
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,375
Yeah. Um...

167
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,417
Right?

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,208
I'm straight. I don't need
no physical love. Trust me, I'm good.

169
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:20,750
You can't hide it, Ward.

170
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,292
Humans have physical tells.

171
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,458
- Tells, huh?
- Yeah.

172
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,917
- It's called a face.
- I ain't making no face.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,125
- Like the face you're making right now.
- I ain't making no face.

174
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,250
All right.

175
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,167
What face am I making?

176
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,083
"A human who needs a lot more
conjugal love" type face.

177
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:44,125
"Conjugal love" face.
So you know human face...

178
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,542
Show me another human face.

179
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,292
- What's another one we make?
- Oh, uh...

180
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:54,042
- What's that face?
- Human who doesn't get anymore pancakes.

181
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,750
- We do like our pancakes, for real.
- I got a lot of 'em.

182
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,333
- You got a lot?
- I got a lot of them.

183
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:04,833
Show me the face an Orc makes
when he just shut the fuck up,

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,250
and don't say shit,
and just drive to work.

185
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,708
Yeah, that's it! That's it!
Oh, you got that one!

186
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,625
Yeah, you killing that one.

187
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,625
You should do that one.
Do that one, like, all the time.

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Whoa. Whoa. Why you going this way?

189
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,167
It's fine, it's a shortcut.

190
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,583
See? They're very nice here.

191
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,083
Dude, you can't go through Elftown.

192
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:39,375
You are killing me. Killing me, dude.

193
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:44,542
So, what, you trying to...
get yourself some designer shoes?

194
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,708
Ain't nothing over here but rich-ass Elves

195
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,125
just running the world and shopping.

196
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:11,000
I hate Elftown.

197
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,583
Even the chauffeurs are snobs.

198
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,917
Hey. Back already, Ward?

199
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,792
Where's the, uh,
diversity hire you ride with?

200
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,125
Yeah, what kind of partner is Jakoby?
Is he your dance partner?

201
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,375
Your sexual partner?

202
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,500
'Cause he fucking sucks
at catching bad guys.

203
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,250
That's Clan Law shit, dog.

204
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,292
Orcs got each other's backs.

205
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,333
Hey, look, why y'all acting like
I put this dude in my car?

206
00:13:57,417 --> 00:14:00,250
So what are you doing to get him
the fuck out of this division?

207
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,833
Hey, long as he pull his weight,
I ain't got no beef with him.

208
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:04,417
No. No, no, no. You could do shit, man.

209
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,542
You could write a letter.
His ass would be gone if we back you up.

210
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:08,833
That's a fact.

211
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,167
- But you only care about yourself, Ward.
- Right.

212
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,542
Did I... Did I ask you for advice?

213
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:17,833
'Cause I'll probably wait till I'm on my,
like, ninth divorce,

214
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,875
then your advice
will come in really handy.

215
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,542
That's good. That's fucking good. Noted.

216
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,583
Meanwhile, that Orc fuck
is still out there

217
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,833
because Jakoby chose clan blood
over the badge.

218
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,708
Or the motherfucker just got away.

219
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,417
He got away 'cause Jakoby let him.

220
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,458
What happens next?

221
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:35,667
What happens the next time
this pig motherfucker

222
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,125
makes a cop suck-start
his fucking 12-gauge?

223
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,000
Only this time, it's Brown,

224
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,167
or it's Hicks, or it's fucking me.

225
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,417
How you gonna feel, Ward?
'Cause that shit is on you.

226
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,125
Well, if you in the box,
I'll probably be like...

227
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,000
Ward, you son of a bitch.

228
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,708
Hey, look, I got a dude in my car,

229
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,958
the whole world is watching, all right?

230
00:14:57,042 --> 00:15:00,500
I didn't ask for it, I don't want it,
but I don't get a vote.

231
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,083
And what happens if they hire more?
You know what they say.

232
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,167
Once with the Dark Lord,
always with the Dark Lord.

233
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,542
They chose evil.

234
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,708
Here's the thing I can't understand.

235
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:13,083
How do a bunch of dudes who can barely
remember their baby mama's birthday

236
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,292
have beef with a whole race

237
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,833
over some shit that happened
2,000 years ago?

238
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,125
Here's the fucking deal, man.

239
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,875
You keep Jakoby
the fuck away from me. Okay?

240
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,833
I'll drop an Orc.  I don't give a fuck.

241
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:27,083
My ancestors killed them
by the fucking thousands in Russia.

242
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,000
- Attaboy, Ward!
- About time, Ward.

243
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,417
All right, settle down,
settle down. The captain's coming.

244
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,542
Ward, I saved you a seat.

245
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,125
Take it away, boss.

246
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,708
Ward, nice to see you back.

247
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:45,750
Cap.

248
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,750
- Tonight's the trifecta.
- Hey, is that your cousin?

249
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,250
Full moon, Friday night...

250
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,083
- No.
- ...summer heat wave.

251
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:55,250
Clear your calls fast,

252
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,000
help your colleagues clear theirs,

253
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,125
get me out of this deployment period
without another murder,

254
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,333
I'll buy you all coffee.

255
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:02,958
Sergeant Ching, all yours.

256
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,875
All right, after I call your name,
get your shotguns and radios and deploy.

257
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,542
I don't want to see you here
unless there's bad guys under the desks.

258
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,167
Three-Mary-25, Pollard.

259
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,000
Three-Mary-55, Kim.

260
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,042
Three-Mary-60, Thomas.

261
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,833
Three-A-21, Pippen and Gosser.

262
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,750
Three-A-54, Hancock and Wheeler.

263
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,042
Three-A-80, Crawford and Duncan.

264
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,333
Three-A-9, Jakoby and Ward.

265
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,250
- Three-A-34, Jones and Morengo.
- Hey, uh, hit the kit room.

266
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,125
- Three-A-82, Ortiz and Mencia...
- I'll meet you at the gas pumps.

267
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,333
- I'll be right down. I just need to...
- Okay.

268
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,083
Three-A-99...

269
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,583
- No.
- Yes. Put him in another car.

270
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,583
What the fuck about my demeanor
gives you the impression

271
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:49,042
that I want to be a target
on the department's Orc-diversity radar?

272
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,542
These decisions are made
nine miles above me.

273
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:56,667
No. They're made right on your paper,
right there.

274
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,708
Scratch him out.

275
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,208
Scratch his name out.
Put another name, anybody.

276
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:03,000
Ward, no one wants to ride with you.

277
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,375
Goodbye. Don't get shot again.

278
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,417
Good luck.

279
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,750
- Hey, looking good, bud.
- Looking real good. Real good.

280
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,292
Be safe, guys.

281
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,125
What's up, homies?

282
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,875
Your ass still alive?

283
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,958
You know something about that?

284
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:54,417
It wasn't me.

285
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,083
Get the fuck off of the street
or I'mma call your PO,

286
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,000
tell him you out drinking
with the homies.

287
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,458
I ain't gonna tell you two times.

288
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,792
Let's go.

289
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,667
I need to know if the shit pop off
with these Fogteeth fools

290
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,083
that you got my back,
that you a cop first.

291
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,292
Are we clear?

292
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:35,625
Clear.

293
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,500
I'm about dope, money, and guns.
That's my job.

294
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,250
Your job is to make sure
I go home at night.

295
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,083
- I don't like this small talk.
- This ain't no small talk.

296
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,625
This is big-ass talk.

297
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,000
We doing real shit out here.

298
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,708
<i>All Westlake units,
three-A-4 is requesting assistance.</i>

299
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:54,167
<i>Sixth and Whitmore. Sixth and Whitmore.</i>

300
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,542
<i>All Westlake units, Three-A-4...</i>

301
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,917
Get him the fuck on the ground!

302
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,625
Back the fuck up!

303
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,542
Stay there! Stay right fucking there!

304
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,042
- Do not resist! Don't...
- Shut the fuck up!

305
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,167
I need to know if you're a cop first...

306
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,333
or an Orc first.

307
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,750
- I need to hear you say it.
- Ward, I...

308
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,833
I wanted to be a cop
since I was a little kid.

309
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:27,083
I am nothing else.

310
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,542
My badge means more to me
than the air I breathe.

311
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,208
So don't question me.

312
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:44,083
<i>Three-A-9, 415. Fifth and Westlake.</i>

313
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,167
<i>Code two,  incident 2415.</i>

314
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,750
Three-Adam-9. Roger, show us en route.

315
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,625
<i>Three-A-9, roger.</i>

316
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,667
The fuck outta here.

317
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,417
God damn it!

318
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,208
Rodriguez. Hey.

319
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, shit, man. I thought you were dead.

320
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,000
Nah, man, too many bills to pay.

321
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,250
I hear ya.

322
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,000
I thought you were out
having your, like, zillionth baby.

323
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,792
Ah, nah, man. Marisol's a week late.
We're inducing next week, though.

324
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,875
Number five.

325
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,708
- Five.
- Lot of mouths to feed.

326
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:23,667
Yeah, man.

327
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,667
Sir...

328
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,875
drop the sword.

329
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,292
You.

330
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,542
The Army of Nine Races
fought shoulder to shoulder

331
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,000
to give you the world you neglect.

332
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,125
- Hey, tell him to shut up.
- 2,000 years ago,

333
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,292
- we fought them with swords and arrows.
- Sir...

334
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:46,708
And now, the Dark One returns
to reclaim Orc hearts!

335
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,625
Everywhere I go, why have Orcs
always gotta be the bad guys?

336
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,542
Hey, don't look at me, man.
Mexicans still get shit for the Alamo.

337
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,792
Get back! Get back!

338
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:02,500
Sir, unless you wanna die,
you drop that sword right fucking now!

339
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,375
Hey, you got me shot,
don't get me stabbed.

340
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,250
Turn around, sir.

341
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,083
- Hands on your head.
- I'm doing it, man. Jeez.

342
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:17,792
- On your knees.
- I... All right.

343
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,292
Don't move.

344
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,500
Having a little fun.

345
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,417
Aah! Shit!

346
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:27,875
All right. Damn.

347
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,083
I'm not resisting, man.

348
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,917
Three-Adam-9, one in custody.

349
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,375
<i>All units, code four.
Fifth and Westlake, suspect in custody.</i>

350
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:45,250
Okay, man, easy. Gimme a... Gimme a... Ow!

351
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:50,542
- Hey.
- Hey.

352
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,458
Real quick.

353
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,792
Gang intel said Fogteeth's been smashing
like a motherfucker,

354
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,875
and Altamira's gangbanging like it's 1999.

355
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,833
- Watch your backs out there.
- Hey, you too.

356
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,917
- All right, brother.
- Kiss your family.

357
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,042
Sir, can you sit back?

358
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,083
You-You stink like shit. Can you sit back?

359
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,208
Thank you.

360
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,417
Come on.

361
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,208
That's bad.

362
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,875
I have a message
from the Shield of Light.

363
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,042
Remember the old ways.

364
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,000
Remember what you are.

365
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,542
Is that Orkish?

366
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,375
How the hell do you know
how to speak Orkish?

367
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:45,833
What'd he say?

368
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,750
Remember your traditions.

369
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,542
Only clan ways can save you.

370
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,167
The Prophecy has chosen you.

371
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,625
The man with you is blessed.

372
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,667
Jakoby!

373
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,667
Come on, man.

374
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,250
What the hell is your problem?
What'd he say?

375
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,583
He's not making any sense.

376
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:32,833
Where's Jakoby?

377
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,083
Uh, booking our body, ma'am.

378
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,333
Um, I love your hair.

379
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,083
Who are you?

380
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:43,625
I'm the unemployment line,
or a prison sentence.

381
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:47,333
I could be the Angel of Mercy,
but it's up to you, buddy.

382
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,375
Ah.

383
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:50,500
Internal Affairs.

384
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:54,292
That's right, all fucking day long.
Now, let's review, kids.

385
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:58,625
Some pigskin piece of shit puts a load
of buckshot into your trauma plate.

386
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,000
<i>- Shithead foot-bails, Jakoby pursues...
- Hey!</i>

387
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,542
Hey!

388
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,417
Police! Stop!

389
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,208
<i>...corners his asshole in, what,
a dead-end alley?</i>

390
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,917
<i>Jakoby states dude tackled
and disarmed him.</i>

391
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,125
Then jumped on a fire escape ladder
and evaded arrest.

392
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,208
Jakoby's signed statement.

393
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,417
<i>Ladder's 13 feet off the ground.
We measured.</i>

394
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,833
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- No Orc has a six-foot vertical.</i>

395
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:25,583
Perhaps the suspect
was light on his feet, sir.

396
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:28,083
Do Orcs have, uh, mad hops?

397
00:24:28,417 --> 00:24:29,708
How many Orcs are ballers?

398
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,000
- Excuse me?
- You fuckin' heard the detective.

399
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,417
- How many Orcs play pro basketball?
- None.

400
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:35,958
They're slow, they're heavy.

401
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,333
That's why half the NFL
defensive lines are Orkish.

402
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:39,708
It's not racism, it's physics.

403
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:42,458
Jakoby kicked loose that pigskin fuck
who blasted you.

404
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:43,750
Do the math.

405
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,750
Orcs hold Clan Law above all else.
That's a fact.

406
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,542
The Jakoby issue is sensitive.
The world's watching.

407
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,417
- We can't fire him without cause.
- Which is why...

408
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,083
you're gonna get him to admit it...

409
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,500
and you're gonna record him.

410
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,750
The fuck outta here.

411
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:08,708
I want the guy out of my car, but...

412
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,333
I snitch, I'm done as a street cop.

413
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:15,375
We know, uh, you got a house note
you can't pay down.

414
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,042
Right? Drowning in debt.

415
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,208
Raising a little girl
you can't afford to pay for.

416
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,583
Mmm.

417
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,083
Father of the fucking year.

418
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:32,083
You talk about my family again,
I'll split your fucking head open.

419
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:33,000
Ward.

420
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,083
You need this job.

421
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,333
Don't throw it away for Jakoby.

422
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:41,292
Get off me. Get off me.

423
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,667
Give it to me.

424
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,458
No testifying...

425
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,000
no depositions,

426
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,292
no paperwork.

427
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,250
Good man.

428
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,000
Very smart.

429
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,000
Shave your mustache, bitch.

430
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,625
It's just business.

431
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,208
Place is a shithole.

432
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:36,625
An Orc with a badge.

433
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:38,417
Incredible.

434
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,250
That's some shit you don't see every day.
Like an Elf with a mop.

435
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,000
Did you see those two guys?

436
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:48,125
I think they're feds.
Could they be here for me?

437
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:51,875
Feds don't give a shit
about the LA Orc community.

438
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,333
Yeah, you're right.

439
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,250
S... So, my-my daughter...

440
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,042
um...

441
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,333
Sophia...

442
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:25,500
she be doing shit all the time, man,
that she don't have no business doing.

443
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,667
Um...

444
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,792
But... she comes clean.

445
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,625
She always tells the truth.

446
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:37,542
'Cause she realized it feels good.

447
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:41,542
Feels good to her, feels good to me.

448
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:44,208
And, uh, truth just has a way...

449
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,750
of clearing the air between people.

450
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,458
If it cleanses...
cleanses some shit, you know,

451
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,500
it's like, just tell the truth.

452
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,708
I know something very bad happened
at the station.

453
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,833
I know.

454
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,667
So are you gonna tell me about it or no?

455
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,042
I'm talking about you. All right?

456
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:06,417
Don't be trying to twist this.
Nothing happened at the...

457
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,375
<i>- I'm not...

462
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,292
How long you been in Shield of Light?

463
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:28,917
What's that?

464
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,208
God!

465
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:32,917
You little fuck-up.

466
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,875
Aah! Shit! What are you doing, man?

467
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,667
No questions, just shut up.

468
00:28:40,042 --> 00:28:42,417
Hey, nice Shield of Light tattoo!

469
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,625
- Good one.
- You know who we are?

470

Housekeeping.

471
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,708
You might wanna look at this.

472
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,083
Fuck. Magic Task Force.

473
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:55,458
Right. The magic feds.

474
00:28:55,792 --> 00:28:59,958
You know, Serling,
if you're gonna play stupid games,

475
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,417
you're gonna win stupid prizes.

476
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,333
Fuck you.

477
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:04,917
You wanna test me, asshole?

478
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,583
Okay! I'm not your enemy, man.

479
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,167
What do you know about the Inferni?

480
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,750
Um... they're Elves.

481
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,375
Renegade Elves.

482
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:19,125
Renegade Elves, sorry.

483
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,083
Because Elves are awesome, right?

484
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,500
They're gonna bring back the Dark Lord.

485
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,833
Fairy fucking tales.

486
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,583
How do they plan to do that?

487
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:35,500
When they get three Magic Wands,
they can raise him from the dead.

488
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,583
You recognize her?

489
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,417
That's Leilah.

490
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:45,000
She's an Inferni coven leader.

491
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,667
She's a Bright.

492
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,792
You ever notice how
most Brights are Elves,

493
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,083
and Elves run the world?

494
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,250
Coincidence?

495
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,333
There are human Brights.

496
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:01,250
One in a million.

497
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,250
But you know how you know
if you're a Bright?

498
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,083
When you touch a Wand...

499
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,292
with your bare hand...

500
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,292
and don't explode.

501
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:18,708
Would you do that?

502
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,708
Would you die to learn the truth
about yourself?

503
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:26,750
If I had a Wand... I'd try.

504
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,208
Let's get back on track.

505
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:32,125
So Leilah has a Magic Wand,
and she's coming after Tikka, right?

506
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,917
And she'll shred this city to do it.

507
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,833
We get Tikka,
we can set a trap for Leilah.

508
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,625
We hunt Wands, we hunt Brights.

509
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,917
That's what we do,
and we're pretty fucking good at it.

510
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,208
You wanna help us?

511
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:46,375
Come on.

512
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,500
The Dark Lord's coming.

513
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:56,333
What, are you gonna to fight him with,
with tanks?

514
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:59,167
Huh? You gonna drone him?

515
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:05,625
Two thousand years ago, magic stopped him.

516
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,083
And magic will stop him again.

517
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:14,458
One day, you all are gonna come begging
for our help.

518
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:16,625
And we'll be there. We'll stop him.

519
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,083
The Shield of Light will stop him.

520
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:22,750
I'm done.

521
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:25,833
We're done.

522
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,458
If you act like my enemy...

523
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,000
you become my enemy.

524
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:43,375
See that?

525
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,292
- Oh, it's a spotter.
- Mm-hmm.

526
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,667
Get down! Down! Go!

527
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:12,625
Oh. Yeah, that's... That's not good.

528
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,042
- Yeah.
- We could die.

529
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:18,750
- First time being shot at?
- Yeah.

530
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:21,292
I have to say, I dislike it very much.

531
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,083
Yeah, it fucking sucks.

532
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:27,708
All right, look... on three,
we're gonna dump this asshole.

533
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,167
All right?

534
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,083
- Right. That makes sense.
- Use force.

535
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,333
- All right.
- Yeah.

536
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,333
One, two, three.

537
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:44,750
- You all right?
- Hmm? Yeah.

538
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,583
- No holes?
- Huh? Uh...

539
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,500
Only the ones that I was born with.

540
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,333
How are your holes?

541
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
The fuck can you make
a shootout awkward?

542
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:55,000
Sorry.

543
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,792
Sorry.

544
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,125
Wait for the reload! All right?

545
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,125
- He's gonna have to reload.
- Reload.

546
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,458
Now!

547
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,458
Shit.

548
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,250
We got him.

549
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,000
Get the door. Get the door.

550
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:32,083
- Shouldn't we wait for the cavalry?
- We are the cavalry.

551
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,042
Ward, can't we wait for backup? Ward.

552
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,000
Go, go, go.

553
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,417
I smell blood, Ward.

554
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,708
Lots of blood.

555
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,500
- What's that?
- Don't know.

556
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:55,375
Oh, shit.

557
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:00,958
- Body. Body.
- What?

558
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,250
Shit. Shit.

559
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,458
Cover the hall.

560
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,083
- What the fuck is that?
- Cover the hall.

561
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,042
Okay.

562
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,708
Oh, shit.

563
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,208
Don't touch anything.

564
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:24,542
Yeah.

565
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,000
- Body.
- Wh...?

566
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,375
That's our shooter, he's down.

567
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,833
Someone's in here. I can smell them.

568
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:44,542
These people died so bad.

569
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,708
Clear.

570
00:34:56,792 --> 00:35:00,125
Something unusual has happened here.

571
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,542
Three-Adam-9, 341 Abrams.

572
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,667
Possible Bright at our location.

573
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,750
Request additional units and a supervisor.

574
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,417
Possible magic-user on scene.

575
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,625
Hey! Freeze!

576
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,625
You! Wait, stop!

577
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,208
Hey! Hey!

578
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,792
Stop running!

579
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,292
- Hold her, hold her!
- Stop! Stop!  Stop!

580
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,375
What has she got?

581
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,208
What is that? What is that?

582
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,458
Go get the homies.

583
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,833
Put it down or I'm gonna shoot you
in your face!

584
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:57,667
Is that...?

585
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,458
It's a Magic Wand.

586
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,208
Who, uh...

587
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,625
Who are you?

588
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,542
Please protect me.

589
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,167
She's speaking Elvish.

590
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,042
I don't speak Elvish.

591
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,125
Well, I took two years in high school,
but, uh...

592
00:36:21,292 --> 00:36:23,292
She said somebody's coming.

593
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,417
Please protect me and the Wand.

594
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,125
As far as I can tell, a Bright came in,
used the Wand, and...

595
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,583
magicked everybody the fuck up. Uh...

596
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:40,833
We need to evacuate this neighborhood,
secure the scene,

597
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:42,708
hold the perimeter till the feds get here.

598
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:44,333
What the fuck are you, new?

599
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:48,292
- This is way above our pay grade.
- That's magic right there.

600
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,375
That's whatever you want.

601
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,208
You want a million dollars?

602
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,333
You want ten million?

603
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,083
You wanna be taller or shorter?

604
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,208
Make your dick bigger?

605
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:04,958
You wanna go back in time, marry the girl
who didn't blow you on prom night?

606
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,708
That's how you do it, right there.

607
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,417
Well, clearly,
we had different prom nights.

608
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:13,417
But that is a Magic Wand,

609
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,292
and you don't know how to use it.

610
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,625
And you're gonna kill us all trying.

611
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:22,042
Only a Bright can use a Wand,
and you don't look like a wizard to me.

612
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:25,167
Don't put your hands on that Wand.

613
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,500
- Hey, don't touch the Wand.
- I got it.

614
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,917
Don't touch it.

615
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,000
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be...

616
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,167
Fucking ice cold.

617
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,792
- All right, you're not stealing that Wand.
- Nobody's coming, Ward.

618
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,167
Whoa. Hey...

619
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,167
Fuck is you squaring off on, bitch?

620
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,667
Hey, Sarge,
you need to talk to your boys right now.

621
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,125
You need this just as much as we do,
maybe more.

622
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,375
Your family depends on you.
Don't you wanna be there for them?

623
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,125
What about Jakoby?

624
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:12,042
Can you tell me your name?

625
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,208
- Tikka.
- Tikka.

626
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,625
My name is Tikka.

627
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,292
We have to leave before she comes.

628
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,542
Before who comes?

629
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,417
It's not happening.

630
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,417
No. No.

631
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Pollard, he's spinning.

632
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,292
- No, he's not spinning worth shit.
- He's fine, he's fine.

633
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,583
- This is stupid.
- Calm down.

634
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,667
- Hey, fucking chill. He's fine.
- Back up.

635
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,583
- He's fin... Hey, hey!
- The fuck you gonna do?

636
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,667
Calm down. Fucking calm down.
Back the fuck up.

637
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,417
Back the fuck up. Listen. Listen.

638
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,625
This is happening.

639
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:55,000
- This is fucking happening.
- Fuck off of me.

640
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,208
All right?

641
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,583
- Fuck.
- It's okay.

642
00:38:58,583 --> 00:38:59,458
It's okay.

643
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:04,458
There's no version of you walking out
of here with life as you know it intact.

644
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,208
Fuck this. We are taking the Wand,
and the Orc dies.

645
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:09,125
And you got a big decision right now.

646
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:13,458
<i>Either your little girl grows up
without a daddy and Jakoby dies,</i>

647
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:17,042
or just Jakoby dies.
And it is time to make a choice.

648
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,500
You or him, Ward. You or him.

649
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:23,083
<i>Is tomorrow's LA Times gonna say
one cop died here, or two?</i>

650
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:27,125
<i>Yeah, there it is.
He just caught up to it.</i>

651
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,333
Everyone wins.

652
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:33,250
Department gets rid of Jakoby,
he dies a hero, public's happy.

653
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:35,333
This report writes itself.

654
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,375
The perfect storm, bro.

655
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,708
It's the perfect storm.

656
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,958
You okay?

657
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:56,500
Hey. Take Sophia,
get out of town right now.

658
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:57,833
What? Why?

659
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:01,125
Get out of town right now. I love you.

660
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:09,042
Ward, where is everyone?
We haven't even set a perimeter.

661
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,750
I'm pretty certain that pee-wee gangster
saw the Wand.

662
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,667
And she is spooked.
Says somebody's coming.

663
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,833
Like... Like, someone bad.

664
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:18,875
But what's...?

665
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,792
You seem like you-you have
bigger troubles.

666
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:25,208
You let the shooter go, didn't you?

667
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,417
'Cause he was clan blood?

668
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,875
Now? You wanna fucking go through this
right now?

669
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,875
What else you lie about, pigface?

670
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:35,042
Don't put your fucking hands on me!

671
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,625
You fucked me.

672
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,125
You fucked us both.

673
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,208
Pigskin piece of shit.

674
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:47,250
You fucked my whole life
over some stupid Orc knucklehead.

675
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:49,458
Fuck you, Ward.

676
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:50,458
Fuck off.

677
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,958
- What...?
- I dare you.

678
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,333
I dare you to pull your gun. Please.

679
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:58,583
Go ahead.

680
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:02,375
I will fuck you up in a gunfight.

681
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,875
I gave you plenty of time
to talk about this shit.

682
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:12,583
- Karma is a bitch, and here it come.
- I let him go.

683
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,708
So what's the real plan?

684
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:17,792
Two cops die tonight.

685
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:19,833
What about the Elf?

686
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,542
I'll kill her.

687
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,125
- You good?
- Yes, sir.

688
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,083
- Yeah.
- Sarge?

689
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,625
You see my teeth? They're filed.

690
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:33,333
I'm not blooded, my father's not blooded,
his father's not blooded.

691
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,958
I've been shit on by Orcs
my whole fucking life.

692
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:40,875
Huh? You know what that feels like,
when your own people hate you?

693
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,708
Why'd you lie, Nick?

694
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,625
It wasn't clan politics.

695
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,083
I just had the wrong guy.

696
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:49,417
Oh.

697
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:50,542
Story time?

698
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:53,292
<i>The guy that shot you,
I lost him in the crowd.</i>

699
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:57,708
<i>I circled back, and I thought I had
that fucking guy dead to rights.</i>

700
00:41:57,792 --> 00:42:00,208
But it was a different kid.
He was just tagging.

701
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:01,583
<i>And the troops are coming.</i>

702
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:05,167
Jacked-up humans with guns
looking for an Orc who'd shot a cop.

703
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:08,083
<i>You think that kid had a chance?</i>

704
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,167
Go, go, go!

705
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,542
They would've dropped him on the spot,
so I did the right thing.

706
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:14,292
- Code four.
- Clear.

707
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:18,458
You never saw his face. How'd you know
it wasn't the motherfucker that shot me?

708
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,125
His fucking smell.

709
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:24,792
Yeah, years of evolution haven't
taken away our sense of smell.

710
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,208
And he smelled different.

711
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:29,542
- What human jury would believe me?
- What, he have Axe body spray?

712
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,792
Yeah, see, this is what
I have to fucking deal with.

713
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,917
The Orc that shot you...

714
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,500
- got away.
- Ward!

715
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:39,250
It's time.

716
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,667
"It's... time"?

717
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:45,167
Time for... Time for what?

718
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,208
All four of 'em standing there?

719
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,875
- Yeah.
- Your left to right, who is it?

720
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:58,000
Brown, Hicks, Pollard, and Ching.
What's going on, Ward?

721
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:52,042
Don't, don't, don't, don't...

722
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:53,375
Don't.

723
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,542
Partner, no!

724
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Drop it, or I will fucking kill you.

725
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,250
Hey, listen to me.

726
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:01,792
This isn't like you.

727
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,667
All right, calm down.

728
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,208
- I know it looks bad.
- Shut up. Shut up, show me your hands.

729
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:12,292
- I didn't have a choice, Nick.
- Shut up.

730
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:13,708
Now turn back around!

731
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:15,375
What's your plan?

732
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:16,792
I'm...

733
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,917
I'm gonna arrest you, so... so shut up!

734
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,208
First of all, stop telling me to shut up.

735
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,000
<i>Second, I need you to shut up</i>

736
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,625
- and listen to me.
- Shut up!

737
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:28,250
Turn around! Get on your fucking knees!

738
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:32,375
Gonna have to fuckin' kill me if you think
you're gonna put me in handcuffs.

739
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:39,625
Ward...

740
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:46,667
Three-Adam-9.

741
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:50,708
I got four officers down,
one officer conscious and breathing.

742
00:44:50,792 --> 00:44:51,875
Three officers...

743
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:53,500
KMA.

744
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,833
<i>All units,
officer needs help, 341 Abrams.</i>

745
00:44:55,917 --> 00:44:57,792
<i>Officer needs help, 341 Abrams.</i>

746
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,792
<i>- Roger on the RA.
- Oh, this is bad.</i>

747
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:01,500
This is so bad.

748
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,958
Put your big girl panties on.

749
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:09,667
They were gonna kill us...
over that Wand, all right?

750
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,750
They were acting crazy.

751
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,625
Don't you say a word.
Not to me, not to anybody.

752
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,667
Jakoby?
Jakoby, who are these people?

753
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,167
Oh, shit. Put her in the truck.
Put her in the truck.

754
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,083
Keep the Wand safe!

755
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:24,958
Motherfucker, what?

756
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,875
Protect the Wand.

757
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:30,208
Those cops there... they okay?

758
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:32,750
That's a lot of blood, homes.

759
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:35,000
That ain't none of your concern.

760
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:38,667
Maybe you should go over and give 'em
a little mouth-to-mouth. Huh?

761
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:40,958
This is an active crime scene.

762
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:44,708
We ain't never had no beef, Poison.
Why don't you take your people home.

763
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,625
Word on the street,
there's a Wand in this hood.

764
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:48,958
Where's it at, man?

765
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:50,833
- My hood.
- Altamira.

766
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:52,583
Alta-fucking-mira, eh?

767
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That's right.

768
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:58,583
So, when the little homies tell
that the cops are shooting each other

769
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,083
in my hood...

770
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,458
makes me wonder. Hmm?

771
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,292
Where's the Wand?

772
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:07,667
Ghetto rumors, homie.

773
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:11,292
Don't wanna get shot in your face
over a rumor, do you?

774
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,833
Why don't you go head home?

775
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:14,667
The Wand belongs to the people.

776
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,667
- To the barrio.
- Get back!

777
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,792
Homeboy.

778
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,750
- You heard me.
- Smooth.

779
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,667
It's mine...

780
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,167
if I have to kill every fucking cop in LA.

781
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,625
You're gonna get your chance,
'cause SWAT is about 90 seconds out.

782
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,083
Nick, get in the truck.

783
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:34,875
Get in the fucking truck, Nick!

784
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,292
- Listen to your master. Get in the truck.
- Fuck you.

785
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:38,875
- Fuck you, homie.
- Fuck you.

786
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,542
What is that,
a fuckin' Labradoodle you dipped in ink?

787
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,708
<i>- Messed with puerco, homie.
- Fucking ugly-ass motherfucker.</i>

788
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:47,417
<i>Looks like a puerco to me.</i>

789
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:52,500
Get me that Wand.

790
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,792
Windows up, bulletproof.

791
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:57,125
- Is a SWAT team coming?
- No, Nick. Go. Go!

792
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,625
- Wrong way, Nick.
- Yeah, well, someone was on the car.

793
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:13,500
Come back, you motherfucker!

794
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:16,542
Bulletproof, dickhead.

795
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,708
Go, go, go, go!

796
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,333
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Drive like you stole it.

797
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,125
Altamira gang, homie.
Let's get these motherfuckers.

798
00:47:50,792 --> 00:47:52,125
Go! Go!

799
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:13,667
Drive straight, not sideways!

800
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:23,750
Shit, I'm out.

801
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,250
- Shit.
- Butterfingers.

802
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:30,500
We were doing so good.

803
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,708
They don't teach that at the academy.

804
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,125
No, they do not.

805
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:20,417
We have to turn back.
Stop the car. Inferni!

806
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,333
- Inferni! Inferni!
- Relax, relax.

807
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,792
- The hell is she saying?
- She won't let it go!

808
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,708
Oh, shit!

809
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,208
What's happening? Hey!

810
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:31,958
Hey, shut up! Shut up! What is that?

811
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:35,000
Shut up!

812
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:57,542
- The fuck?
- Problem?

813
00:49:57,625 --> 00:50:00,708
Tech services is flagging
some weird-ass cell phone inter...

814
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,417
Talking about a Magic Wand.

815
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,875
Help me. Help.

816
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,375
Larika.

817
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:02,750
Oh...

818
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:07,125
Leilah. The traitor escaped.

819
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:14,333
She has your Wand.

820
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:36,708
I got blood in my eye.
What the fuck did we hit?

821
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:37,750
Oh, that was the Wand.

822
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:40,042
You know what a binding spell is?

823
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:43,167
It stops it from getting too far away
from its owner.

824
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Pulls it back.

825
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,875
Owner? Who owns a Wand?

826
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,792
A Bright.

827
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,667
Please, sir.

828
00:53:15,417 --> 00:53:17,083
Tell me what happened.

829
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,375
Tell me.

830
00:53:21,542 --> 00:53:24,833
Cops started shooting at each other,

831
00:53:25,292 --> 00:53:27,875
and a black cop killed them all.

832
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,417
He left with an Orc cop and an Elf girl.

833
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,708
An Elf?

834
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:41,417
No! No!

835
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:02,417
Okay, you know what?
You need to sit your crazy ass down.

836
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:06,583
Look, half of our division is on some
old-school Rampart shit, a'ight?

837
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:09,792
They're gonna kill you first,
then they're gonna kill me,

838
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,000
they're gonna take the Wand,

839
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:13,250
and that's when the stupid shit's
gonna start.

840
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:17,250
And by the way, that's only
if the gangstas don't get it first.

841
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,542
And that's when the triple stupid shit's
gonna start.

842
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,375
We gotta get out of this neighborhood.

843
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:26,458
Yeah, but the Wand is gonna stop us.
The binding spell is gonna stop us.

844
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,458
We'll hide the Wand.

845
00:54:28,542 --> 00:54:30,375
We'll hide it here
and come back and get it.

846
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:32,083
I am not abandoning the Wand.

847
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:36,417
- We are not the fucking Wand police.
- You want bodies on the street? Huh?

848
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:37,792
All of LA on fire?

849
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:41,083
This is like a nuclear weapon
that grants wishes.

850
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:44,542
No. The feds have people

851
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:46,000
that deal with magic.

852
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,917
- We call them. We ask...
- You wanna call the feds?

853
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,958
I got bodies on my gun, remember?

854
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:53,625
Yeah, well, don't look at me,
I just let an Orc go.

855
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:54,542
Really, Nick?

856
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,333
Really?

857
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:57,250
That was irony.

858
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,917
- No, that's just being an asshole.
- Oh.

859
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:03,125
Gonna call Rodriguez.
He's a sheriff, he's not LAPD.

860
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:05,667
- He's solid as fuck. We can trust him.
- That's a good idea.

861
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,125
Shh, shh.

862
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,708
- They're coming for the Wand.
- Ah, shit.

863
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:14,250
- What is it?
- The lock.

864
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:17,583
We left the lock outside on the ground.
Go.

865
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,167
Partner, look out!

866
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,208
Come on! Come on! Come on!

867
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:48,583
Let's go! Let's go!

868
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:53,500
Nick, let's go.

869
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,083
Come on, let's go!

870
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:56,292
What is your problem?

871
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,208
Wait! I dropped the Wand.

872
00:55:58,292 --> 00:55:59,875
Don't you fucking touch that!

873
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:16,167
Where did they all go?

874
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,667
I think we're breathing 'em.

875
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:32,292
- Hey, do me a favor.
- Uh-huh?

876
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,250
Don't drop that shit no more.

877
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,542
What? No.

878
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:38,083
Why would I?

879
00:56:49,417 --> 00:56:52,167
Ah, shit! Ah!

880
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,917
Ward...

881
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:00,792
I shot a human. Did you see?

882
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,333
Yeah, I'll get you some ice cream later.
Damn.

883
00:57:07,042 --> 00:57:08,833
- I'm hit.
- What?

884
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:13,708
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna keep coming. Let's go.

885
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,333
What are you doing here?

886
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,083
You fucking traitor.

887
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:27,500
Keep walking.

888
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,375
Tikka!

889
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:28,000
Where's Tikka?

890
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,917
Tikka!

891
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:32,333
On my back! Get on my back!

892
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:52,833
Get those fucking cops.

893
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:54,375
Tikka!

894
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:01,333
Ward?

895
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:05,042
Ward!

896
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:07,833
You want some of this?

897
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:11,792
I found Tikka. Let's go!

898
00:59:15,042 --> 00:59:16,708
Tikka! Get down!

899
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,292
Ward, this way!

900
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:34,417
- Execute.
- Sir.

901
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:38,583
- Move! Let's go! Move!
- Confirmed use of magic.

902
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,500
She's Inferni.

903
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:11,667
What a shitshow.

904
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:15,167
You want to, uh, unpack this for me, boss?

905
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,917
Leilah.

906
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:22,750
Leilah was here.

907
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,750
What are you talking about?

908
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,292
She was sent to kill Tikka,

909
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,208
- then Tikka did that.
- She wants her Wand back, right?

910
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:34,750
- Yes.
- And Tikka has it.

911
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:38,875
- Yes.
- And those cops she ran off with, uh...

912
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:42,042
Ward and...

913
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,917
What? Jakoby.

914
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,875
The Orc cop we saw at the station.

915
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,083
They have no idea who Tikka is.

916
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,292
It's been 20 years.

917
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:51,958
What does that even mean?

918
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:53,833
Twenty years I've been hunting Leilah.

919
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:56,083
Without her Wand...

920
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,125
she's vulnerable.

921
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,792
Now's a bad time to go shopping, Ward.

922
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,625
Everybody's looking for two cops.
We gotta switch it up.

923
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,417
Oh, yeah.

924
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:19,708
Running through a Fogteeth party
is not good community policing.

925
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:22,792
Yeah, well, we're alive,
and we got the Wand.

926
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:25,792
Orcs hold grudges. That's all I'm saying.

927
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,667
Tell me about it.
Hey, follow me. Let's go.

928
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,375
Tikka.

929
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:32,958
<i>- Oh, thank you, ma'am.
- Go.</i>

930
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,917
- That's good.
- Thank you.

931
01:02:11,792 --> 01:02:14,875
Take your old lady,
get the fuck outta here. Go. Go.

932
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:21,000
I need you to get the fuck outta here.
All right? Go.

933
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:21,958
Jesus.

934
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:41,958
Whoo!

935
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:50,583
Seven dudes with choppers
down the right, five down the left.

936
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:52,000
Bunch of motherfuckers in the middle.

937
01:02:58,417 --> 01:02:59,500
Officer Ward...

938
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,167
I think we need to talk.

939
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,833
Hey, Poison, how you doing?

940
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:06,042
Some fucked-up shit went down tonight.

941
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:09,542
My homies wanna cut your fucking head off,
the cops wanna cut your fucking head off,

942
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,833
the Fogteeth gang
wanna cut your fucking head off.

943
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:14,042
Yeah, I got that effect on people, Poison.

944
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:15,750
Imagine how my old lady feels.

945
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,000
Me? I just wanna protect you.

946
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,583
Mmm.

947
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:24,083
Get you home safe and sound,
with all your sins forgiven.

948
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,750
But you gotta give me that Wand.

949
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,542
You wanna do the right thing?

950
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,083
Help me walk again.

951
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,500
Help me make love to my old lady again.

952
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,333
Help me get rid of this shit again.

953
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:40,750
Give me the fucking Wand, or I will nail
every door in this place shut

954
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,083
and burn this place down
to the fucking ground.

955
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:47,958
And then I will pick up the Wand
from the ashes, and I will laugh.

956
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,292
Chopping it up with the homie for a sec,
Poison.

957
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:55,250
I'm running out of patience, Officer Ward.

958
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:07,292
- Let's give this motherfucker the Wand.
- What?

959
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:10,167
Look, we gonna get
everybody in here killed,

960
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,208
and then he's gonna
take the damn Wand anyway.

961
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:14,250
I'm not giving that guy the Wand.

962
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,458
Over my dead body.

963
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:18,833
He's gonna have to kill me first.

964
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:21,000
So you wanna die in a gunfight

965
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,500
in a nasty-ass titty bar?

966
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:25,083
That's what you want?

967
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,292
I don't wanna die anywhere.

968
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:31,542
You know what? Now I do. Fuck it.
I wanna die. Let's do it right now.

969
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:33,083
We gonna titty-bar-gunfight die.

970
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:34,958
Let's do it right here, right now. Ready?

971
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:36,875
I just wish your dumb ass
was a better shot.

972
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,875
- What she say?
- She says the devil is coming.

973
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,042
The devil's ass is out there
in that wheelchair.

974
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,125
- Let's go. On three. One...
- Let's do it.

975
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:48,750
- ...two... three.
- Yeah.

976
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:11,500
Oh, shit.

977
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:13,542
Go, go, go!

978
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,083
Go! Go, go, go!

979
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:22,417
Move!

980
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:32,250
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

981
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,167
Hurry!

982
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:38,542
LAPD!

983
01:05:40,042 --> 01:05:42,333
- Oh, fuck. Come on!
- Who is she?

984
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,083
Inferni! She wants her Wand.

985
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:49,500
Move!

986
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,792
I'm not a cop after tonight, am I?

987
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,417
No. Neither am I.

988
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:28,750
I think we should probably spend our time

989
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:32,333
- just trying to survive this shit.
- Survive?

990
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,833
Being a cop is all I've got.

991
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:39,750
Right now I'm still a cop,
and if I die tonight,

992
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:41,792
I'll be a cop forever. I'll be a...

993
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:43,375
I'll be a hero forever.

994
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,250
Why the fuck do you wanna die for a world
that doesn't give a shit about you?

995
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,458
Orcs chose the wrong side a long time ago

996
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:54,417
and they've been paying for it ever since.

997
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,375
You know, when an Orc sees me...

998
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:02,083
they see a man... a wannabee human.

999
01:07:02,167 --> 01:07:04,792
When humans see me, they see an animal.

1000
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:06,125
They hate me.

1001
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,417
They don't hate you.

1002
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,458
We know when people like us
and when they don't.

1003
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:12,792
Like you, Ward.

1004
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:17,708
When you came out of that house
with pure hatred in your eyes.

1005
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:21,250
Pure... hatred.

1006
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,583
Look, I told you what that was, all right?

1007
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:34,125
Why didn't you tell me the truth
about helping the Orc kid?

1008
01:07:36,042 --> 01:07:37,917
I'm not saying it would've changed...

1009
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:41,208
anything, but, shit, it might have.

1010
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,500
I got confused.

1011
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:48,917
And with humans, you understand,
everything is so definite.

1012
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,375
Like, you say something,
and all of a sudden it's law,

1013
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,125
and you can't walk it back.

1014
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:55,458
You gotta tell me...

1015
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:58,083
if I'm supposed to be your partner.

1016
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,500
I don't care what we'll say to them,
but you gotta tell me the truth.

1017
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:03,250
<i>You can't lie to me.</i>

1018
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:06,792
Oh, so I'm supposed to trust you
when you don't trust me?

1019
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:10,667
That's a good point.

1020
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:18,667
You're a good cop.

1021
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,208
And people are really hard on you, so...

1022
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:26,417
you're really hard on yourself.

1023
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:39,917
Come on, crazy.

1024
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:44,042
Ward, do you know that you are
who I wish I was?

1025
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:45,708
You're fearless.

1026
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,375
You always know what to do.

1027
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,375
What you did tonight,

1028
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,875
that's what it takes for an Orc
to get blooded.

1029
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,417
An act of great bravery.

1030
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:00,375
To me, you're like a blooded human.

1031
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,667
I used to be like you.

1032
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:08,083
Think you can save everybody
and fix everything and...

1033
01:09:11,167 --> 01:09:13,417
Now I just pretend to be a good dude.

1034
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:18,917
You still are one.

1035
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,708
Are we friends?

1036
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:26,875
Nah, Nick. We're not friends, man.

1037
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,792
You don't want me as a friend.

1038
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,208
Show me your fucking hands, Ward.

1039
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:04,958
Whoa, Rodriguez, what are you doing?

1040
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:06,750
Show me your fucking hands.

1041
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:09,125
- Hey! I called you.
- Show me your fucking hands.

1042
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:11,292
- Are you a part of this?
- Part of what?

1043
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:14,500
All I know is I heard chatter on the radio
saying you killed a bunch of cops.

1044
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:17,125
- Put your gun down. Listen, the guys...
- Shut the fuck up.

1045
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:19,042
- Hey!
- Yo! Drop the weapon.

1046
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:22,250
- Tikka, stop. All right. Relax.
- Drop the fucking weapon!

1047
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,500
Drop it now!

1048
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:26,292
- Rodriguez. Listen to me.
- Get away from the gun!

1049
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:27,208
Listen!

1050
01:10:27,792 --> 01:10:32,083
The guys on our watch tried to do us
over a Wand.

1051
01:10:32,417 --> 01:10:33,750
We have a Wand.

1052
01:10:34,042 --> 01:10:35,458
We have a Magic Wand.

1053
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,417
- All right, show me the Wand.
- Don't show him shit.

1054
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,042
- He's gonna shoot us and take it.
- Slow.

1055
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,917
Jakoby!

1056
01:10:58,625 --> 01:10:59,792
Shit.

1057
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:06,125
Okay, first thing we gotta do
is keep that away from the bad guys.

1058
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,833
- I'm gonna make a phone call. Put it down.
- All right.

1059
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:11,083
- Put it down. Now step back!
- Rodriguez...

1060
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:13,833
Step the... God damn it!
What the fuck? Is that an Elf?

1061
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:16,000
- Rodriguez, put the phone down.
- Step the fuck back!

1062
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:18,250
- Put your phone down.
- I'm calling the feds.

1063
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:20,417
- It's what we're supposed to do.
- Listen to me.

1064
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,583
- Chill. Chill. Chill.
- Listen. We don't know who's dirty.

1065
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:25,708
- Rodriguez, put the phone down.
- Shut the fuck up.

1066
01:11:25,792 --> 01:11:26,917
- Put the phone do...
- Hold on!

1067
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,083
Don't tell 'em shit.

1068
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:31,792
I got a deputy claiming to have the Wand.

1069
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,208
Yes?

1070
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:36,833
They wanna know where we're at.

1071
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,583
Give me the phone.

1072
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,458
Give me the phone.

1073
01:11:42,292 --> 01:11:43,292
Who is this?

1074
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:44,875
Who's this?

1075
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:46,958
The motherfucker with the Wand.

1076
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:53,167
<i>You called us. Where are you?</i>

1077
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:55,458
All right, look...

1078
01:11:57,167 --> 01:11:59,625
I got the Wand, but I need something.

1079
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:03,458
<i>- You need forgiveness.
- If I give you this Wand.</i>

1080
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:05,333
And let's just say...

1081
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:10,417
I don't know, somebody accused me of,
uh, some dumb shit, like...

1082
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:12,292
killing a bunch of cops.

1083
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:14,792
<i>A man like you could fix that shit, right?</i>

1084
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:20,042
If you were protecting a weapon of magic
from, let's say, corrupt individuals...

1085
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,042
there would be no charges.

1086
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,833
That's exactly what happened.

1087
01:12:24,042 --> 01:12:24,958
Hypothetically.

1088
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:27,167
<i>A man like you could dead that noise,
right?</i>

1089
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:30,250
<i>- Do you have the Elf girl?
- Yeah.</i>

1090
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:33,750
Yo.

1091
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,917
- Can only narrow it down to a few blocks.
- Okay.

1092
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,250
Come on, let's go! Move out! Move out!

1093
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:51,042
- The phone died.
- Shit.

1094
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:56,042
- All right, look...
- Okay. No, hold the... Hold the fuck up.

1095
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,875
- Hey, Rodriguez...
- Have to cuff your partner.

1096
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,667
- Nobody's handcuffing anybody.
- It doesn't look good.

1097
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,625
A fucking Orc and a bunch of dead cops?

1098
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:04,708
All right.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1099
01:13:04,792 --> 01:13:06,500
I'm just being real with you, man.

1100
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,083
They want it to be Jakoby.

1101
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:09,625
Okay? Whether it's him or not.

1102
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,667
If he's not cuffed
by the time they get here,

1103
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,375
they're gonna smoke
both of you motherfuckers.

1104
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:14,583
- Cuff your partner.
- Don't...

1105
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:16,917
- Ward, it's okay.
- Don't reach on me like that.

1106
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:19,458
We can't run all night.

1107
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,542
Let's do it.

1108
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,125
It's time to end this.

1109
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,292
Let's go in.

1110
01:13:29,667 --> 01:13:31,750
Take my gun.

1111
01:13:34,417 --> 01:13:35,250
Turn around.

1112
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:37,500
Hey, Ward...

1113
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:39,458
I can't go to prison.

1114
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,542
They'll skin me alive.

1115
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:44,292
You're not going to jail.
You didn't do shit.

1116
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:45,750
I shot everybody.

1117
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:48,292
Ward, shut the fuck up and lawyer up.

1118
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,375
Aah!

1119
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:52,542
Get inside! Get inside! Go!

1120
01:13:57,625 --> 01:14:00,083
Shit. What was that?

1121
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,208
Good girl. Let me out. Let me out.
You see anything?

1122
01:14:04,292 --> 01:14:07,208
- No, I can't see anything.
- Sir, get away from that window!

1123
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:12,083
Oh, shit! Move! Come on!

1124
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:07,250
Traitor.

1125
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:37,625
Oh, shit, shit.

1126
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:53,708
Get me out. Get me out.

1127
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,958
Get me out!

1128
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,042
Oh, God.

1129
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,750
Oh, shit.

1130
01:16:39,042 --> 01:16:41,292
I told you Orcs hold grudges.
Huh? What'd I say?

1131
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:44,208
All right, look. I'm gonna cut you a break
on the reckless driving.

1132
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:47,875
But I need you to return to your vehicles
and drive home safely.

1133
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:52,000
So I need you to take your fat
Shrek-looking ass

1134
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:56,250
back to your vehicle
and drive the fuck home to Fiona. A'ight?

1135
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:58,333
- Do you wanna go to jail?
- Fiona?

1136
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,958
Tell these dickheads in Orkish

1137
01:17:01,542 --> 01:17:04,583
to get the fuck back in their vehicles
and drive home,

1138
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:08,208
- or they're all going to jail.
- But... they speak English.

1139
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:11,833
But... You understand, right?
Speak English?

1140
01:17:11,917 --> 01:17:13,542
Yeah. Of course.

1141
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,750
Take 'em to the church!

1142
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:42,625
You know...

1143
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,417
I'm not from here.

1144
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:47,958
I grew up in Miami.

1145
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:52,583
Great Orc communities there,
strong Orc communities.

1146
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:55,750
We'd have block parties
with dwarves and humans.

1147
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:58,417
It was fucking fun, man.

1148
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,375
I wasn't in the game then.

1149
01:18:03,667 --> 01:18:04,958
I was a bus driver.

1150
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:08,583
Then I moved to LA.

1151
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,875
Fucking City of Angels, right?

1152
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,292
Listen, I would really appreciate it

1153
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:16,000
if you gave me the respect
of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

1154
01:18:17,417 --> 01:18:20,083
I get here and I see
how broke the system is.

1155
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,417
Orcs caught between the police
and the gangsters.

1156
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,625
Elves making money off us.

1157
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:29,083
- So I organize...
- Tikka.

1158
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,583
...my community.

1159
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:33,500
We got our own thing now.

1160
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:36,042
Every month...

1161
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:40,792
- Look at me, motherfucker.
- Sorry.

1162
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Every month...

1163
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:46,208
I throw a big party.

1164
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:49,292
Get everyone drunk, feed 'em.

1165
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:51,667
All races...

1166
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:54,542
partying together, with one rule.

1167
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:57,250
No guns.

1168
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,833
After years of peace...

1169
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:04,208
who brings in the guns?

1170
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,083
We did, yeah.

1171
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:09,500
- The drama?
- Us.

1172
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:14,083
Disrespects our celebration?

1173
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,000
The motherfucking police!

1174
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:21,417
An unblooded Orc.

1175
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:26,458
Grew up with humans. Never had a hand
raised for him in respect.

1176
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:28,792
What's he saying?

1177
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:32,417
- Playing the nice guy.
- Nothing I haven't heard before.

1178
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:36,125
Your buddy's so happy to say
he's got a Orc friend.

1179
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:41,375
Shit. I'm stuck with this motherfucker.

1180
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:42,792
- Seriously?
- I'm just saying,

1181
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:45,500
ain't like we's stomping
through the club together.

1182
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:46,542
Ward.

1183
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:52,417
Where is the Wand?

1184
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:54,542
What Wand?

1185
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,583
- Hey, man, we're family.
- Hey, Nick.

1186
01:19:57,917 --> 01:20:00,500
He's just trying to get in your head.
Don't let him in your head.

1187
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:03,542
I'm not trying to get in his head, man.
I'm in his soul.

1188
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:06,458
We're the same thing.

1189
01:20:07,292 --> 01:20:09,875
- I'll tell you where the Wand is.
- Yeah?

1190
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:13,667
It's up your fucking ass.

1191
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,667
Where's the Wand?

1192
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,333
Whip these motherfuckers.

1193
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:49,417
Get them!

1194
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:51,625
Don't hurt 'em.

1195
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:53,208
Pussy.

1196
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,167
Roundtooth.

1197
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,417
False Orc.

1198
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:02,625
Unblooded coward.

1199
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:07,667
Where is the Wand?

1200
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,833
What... What Wand?

1201
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:16,083
You motherfucking dickhead!

1202
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:20,583
Where is the Wand?

1203
01:21:23,042 --> 01:21:24,792
What Wa... Wand?

1204
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,625
There's no Wand!

1205
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Altamira thinks there's a Wand.

1206
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:40,375
The police think there's a Wand.

1207
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:43,875
The feds think there's a Wand.

1208
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:48,292
I think there's a Wand!

1209
01:21:50,042 --> 01:21:52,500
There's no Wand.

1210
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:54,458
Ghetto Fairy tales.

1211
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,792
Bring me the Elf.

1212
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:08,875
I will cover you with her hot blood.

1213
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,792
She don't have shit to do with this.

1214
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:13,958
Where is the Wand?

1215
01:22:14,042 --> 01:22:16,250
We are police off...

1216
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:17,750
officers.

1217
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,583
And you can't do this to us.

1218
01:22:34,792 --> 01:22:35,958
Kill them!

1219
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:47,417
Watch your friends die, Elf.

1220
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,917
You didn't break.

1221
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,750
You deserve to be blooded.

1222
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:06,792
You would have made a great Orc.

1223
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,542
I am... a great Orc.

1224
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,250
My son earns his colors tonight.

1225
01:23:26,292 --> 01:23:27,208
Mikey.

1226
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:48,792
Bye, partner.

1227
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:57,125
Why are you waiting?

1228
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,958
Father... I know him.

1229
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:09,875
Ward...

1230
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,917
He helped me escape from the police.

1231
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,500
That's the guy...

1232
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:17,667
that I let go.

1233
01:24:19,417 --> 01:24:22,417
He saved my life. I cannot kill him.

1234
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:30,292
Go home.

1235
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:34,792
You can't be here.

1236
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:18,833
Fuck you, you green pig-nose
piece of shit.

1237
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:19,833
Shoot, bitch.

1238
01:25:19,917 --> 01:25:22,167
- Beg for it! Beg!
- Shoot me, bitch. Shoot, bitch!

1239
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,417
Fuck you.

1240
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,875
- Show your respect!
- Fuck you! Do it! Shoot!

1241
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:29,042
- Shoot, motherfucker! Bring it!
- Give us respect! Here it comes!

1242
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:28,583
This is a Prophecy, for he has risen.

1243
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:59,583
Hey, hey.

1244
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:07,208
W- Ward?
What happened?

1245
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:09,708
Uh... Nothing. Why?

1246
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:12,792
Well, something happened. I feel great.

1247
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:14,208
Uh...

1248
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:17,583
- Nah, just go, go, go.
- Okay.

1249
01:27:31,792 --> 01:27:32,958
You're a Bright?

1250
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:34,917
You're a fucking Bright?

1251
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:38,792
Would've been nice to know that
when we was getting fucked up.

1252
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:41,917
Could've had a magic helicopter
take us somewhere.

1253
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,125
I only started my training.

1254
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,292
I only know a few spell words.

1255
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:49,750
She speaks English pretty good now, too.

1256
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:52,292
- Now I trust you.
- Um...

1257
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:55,667
You gonna need to unfuck this, okay?

1258
01:27:55,917 --> 01:27:59,083
A'ight? You gonna magic us to Palm Springs
or some shit.

1259
01:27:59,167 --> 01:28:01,083
I saved your friend's life.

1260
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:03,625
Isn't that enough?

1261
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,333
It's a start, but...

1262
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:10,292
Uh, Ward, stop.
I happen to think it's a pretty big deal.

1263
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:12,250
Thank you.

1264
01:28:13,542 --> 01:28:17,250
Now, Tikka, who are these Elves
who are hunting us?

1265
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:20,542
They're aiding the return
of the Dark Lord...

1266
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:24,125
so he can slaughter billions

1267
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:27,958
and enslave the survivors
to serve him in a new age of magic.

1268
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:29,875
Oh. That's all.

1269
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,333
Just some Illuminati shit.

1270
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:33,583
They're Inferni.

1271
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,833
They destroyed the Illuminati
a hundred years ago.

1272
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:38,208
How do you know all this?

1273
01:28:38,917 --> 01:28:40,583
I, too, am Inferni.

1274
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:45,125
But I escaped.

1275
01:28:46,917 --> 01:28:49,000
<i>The Shield of Light hid me.</i>

1276
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,042
<i>Leilah gave an assassin her Wand
to kill me.</i>

1277
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:02,333
<i>But I got the Wand from her.</i>

1278
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,542
Keep it away from Leilah.

1279
01:29:09,417 --> 01:29:11,708
She mustn't get her Wand back.

1280
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:15,000
With it,
she can restore the Dark Lord to power.

1281
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,500
Hey, what is that? What's the shit?
What's the black stuff?

1282
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:20,917
Hey. Look... All right.

1283
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:25,000
All right, hey, look,
don't-don't-don't check out on us.

1284
01:29:25,292 --> 01:29:29,792
Keep it away from her.
Keep the Wand away from Leilah.

1285
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:31,583
- Promise me.
- Yes.

1286
01:29:31,667 --> 01:29:34,667
All right. She needs medical attention.
We gotta get her to an emergency room.

1287
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,833
But how?

1288
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:40,750
Got it. Let's go!

1289
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:42,333
Go, go!

1290
01:29:45,417 --> 01:29:46,667
We won't let you die.

1291
01:29:47,292 --> 01:29:48,667
How do we save you?

1292
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:52,458
Only the Shield of Light can help me.

1293
01:29:53,167 --> 01:29:54,375
Where are they?

1294
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,083
Home.

1295
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,125
- Home.
- Home? Where's home?

1296
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:02,417
Wait, home.
Uh... the Abrams' house?

1297
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:04,708
Everybody was dead there.

1298
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:07,375
There's a pool.

1299
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:13,667
The pools are... connected like...

1300
01:30:14,667 --> 01:30:17,708
the roots of a holy tree.

1301
01:30:19,917 --> 01:30:22,750
Ward, she's dying. We have to take her
back to where we found her.

1302
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:24,917
- No. We are not going back to that house.
- Yes.

1303
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,667
We're gonna get to the hospital.
There's doctors there.

1304
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,292
We're gonna turn her and the Wand
over to the feds.

1305
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,000
- Ward. Ward.
- I want my life back.

1306
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:35,833
She brought me back from the dead.

1307
01:30:35,917 --> 01:30:38,417
Hey, don't kook out on me right now,
all right?

1308
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,583
We don't know exactly what happened.

1309
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:42,292
You have to accept the miracle.

1310
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:46,625
- We're not going back to that house.
- You and me are simple people.

1311
01:30:47,083 --> 01:30:48,333
We mean nothing.

1312
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,333
People don't write about us.

1313
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:53,583
But this, don't you see,
is like a time of heroes?

1314
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:57,667
Jirak was unblooded like me.

1315
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,167
An Orc that nobody cared about.

1316
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:01,708
He...

1317
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:07,375
He united the Nine Armies,
and they defeated the Dark Lord. He...

1318
01:31:07,542 --> 01:31:11,125
He was a farmer who changed the world.

1319
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:14,792
They raised their blades to him.

1320
01:31:14,917 --> 01:31:17,833
He was blooded in that very moment.

1321
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:21,083
He fulfilled a great Prophecy, Ward.

1322
01:31:22,875 --> 01:31:24,792
I think we might be in a Prophecy.

1323
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:28,625
- We're not in a Prophecy, all right?
- How do you know?

1324
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,417
We're in a stolen Toyota Corolla.

1325
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:34,250
- No.
- Okay? Look at my face.

1326
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:37,875
All right? This is not a Prophecy face.

1327
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:40,458
This is a bad-night face.

1328
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:43,250
Okay? And we're gonna get to the hospital,

1329
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:44,958
and the feds are gonna put an end to it.

1330
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:48,208
Shut the fuck up, Ward, and listen to me.

1331
01:31:48,292 --> 01:31:49,750
We have to go back.

1332
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:51,625
There's nothing ahead of us.

1333
01:32:08,667 --> 01:32:11,083
Ah, man. These guys are feds.

1334
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,542
Oh, shit.

1335
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:44,625
I get the big gun.

1336
01:32:48,167 --> 01:32:49,083
Ah.

1337
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:51,708
I didn't mind having the big gun.

1338
01:33:13,542 --> 01:33:15,083
That... That's a bomb.

1339
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:16,000
Yes, it is.

1340
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:19,292
- You want me to hold it?
- Yes, I do.

1341
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:21,083
W... Why?

1342
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:22,708
You never know.

1343
01:33:30,208 --> 01:33:34,417
I sit before you, Lord of Darkness.

1344
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,542
Serving your will is my honor.

1345
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,708
I will return you to this world.

1346
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:46,250
They're coming!
There! In the wall!

1347
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:47,458
Shoot through the wall!

1348
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,875
Ward!

1349
01:34:09,542 --> 01:34:11,250
Nick!

1350
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,458
Nick! Let's go!

1351
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:20,917
Jakoby!

1352
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,500
I gave her the bomb.

1353
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,167
You never know.

1354
01:34:37,708 --> 01:34:38,625
Swipe left.

1355
01:34:58,458 --> 01:34:59,542
Oh, shit.

1356
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,958
Shoot her!

1357
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:49,750
Shoot her!

1358
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:51,750
Nick, will you please shoot her!

1359
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:53,208
Shoot! Shoot her!

1360
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:13,083
Good work.

1361
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:35,750
The water. Put me in the water.

1362
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:39,375
Hey. You're done. I got it from here.

1363
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:22,875
So what now?

1364
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:26,125
Have faith.

1365
01:37:39,708 --> 01:37:41,083
She's coming.

1366
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:45,875
Nick!

1367
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,042
The hell are you?

1368
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:44,958
I'm a warrior.

1369
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,458
A priestess, a lover.

1370
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:51,167
I am whatever my Lord needs me to be.

1371
01:38:58,458 --> 01:39:00,083
Come home.

1372
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:04,042
Please, come home.

1373
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:07,417
I can't go back.

1374
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:11,250
Dream with me again.

1375
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:16,125
What you love is broken, rotten.

1376
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:23,208
This man and the Orc...

1377
01:39:24,417 --> 01:39:26,333
...what are they to you?

1378
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:30,667
- They're good.
- No.

1379
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:43,125
It's time to come home.

1380
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:46,583
It's time to come home.

1381
01:39:46,875 --> 01:39:50,917
- It's too late. I can't come home.
- It's time to wake up.

1382
01:39:58,333 --> 01:40:01,500
So just shut up and kill me.

1383
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:03,500
Just shut up and kill me!

1384
01:40:03,583 --> 01:40:06,000
- This is not you!
- Shut up and kill me!

1385
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,917
This is not you! This is you!

1386
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:12,375
What have you done to my sister?

1387
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:16,292
What have you done to her?
What did you do?

1388
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,375
Shit.

1389
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:31,542
Nick, if you were aiming at the Wand,
that was a really good shot.

1390
01:40:31,625 --> 01:40:33,458
But shoot her in her head!

1391
01:40:34,667 --> 01:40:35,542
Like this?

1392
01:40:39,083 --> 01:40:40,083
I can't.

1393
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:42,417
I'm out.

1394
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,750
No!

1395
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:51,792
You're not a Bright.

1396
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:54,917
You touch my Wand...

1397
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:58,958
and it will splatter you
all over the walls.

1398
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:01,792
I think that's kind of the plan.

1399
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,333
Think I'mma just kill us all.

1400
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:12,542
Ward...

1401
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:14,583
I wouldn't do that.

1402
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:16,167
It's all right.

1403
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,042
We're in a Prophecy, right?

1404
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,125
Oh... Oh!

1405
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:32,875
This is impossible.

1406
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:38,917
Hey, Nick, I got the Wand.

1407
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:40,375
Um, what now?

1408
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:44,000
Maybe you're a... You're a Bright, Ward.

1409
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:47,208
Use it!

1410
01:41:47,583 --> 01:41:48,833
Oh, good idea.

1411
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:51,083
Give it to me...

1412
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,000
or she dies.

1413
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,375
<i>Vykwarus.</i>

1414
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:01,083
<i>The war word is Vykwarus.</i>

1415
01:42:01,333 --> 01:42:03,750
<i>Vykwarus!</i>

1416
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:13,208
We got a Bright in there!

1417
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:20,125
Aah!

1418
01:42:24,042 --> 01:42:25,583
Tikka. Tikka.

1419
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:30,667
- Tikka!
- Ward! It's okay.

1420
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:32,667
- She just... She rolled in.
- Come on, Ward!

1421
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:35,042
- She's gone. It's okay.
- I didn't hurt her.

1422
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:37,917
- Tikka!
- Ward, Tikka's okay.

1423
01:42:38,167 --> 01:42:39,167
She's gone.

1424
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:41,250
- Tikka!
- Ward, think of Sophia.

1425
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:42,333
Come on, Ward!

1426
01:42:58,792 --> 01:42:59,708
Orc!

1427
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:01,875
Stand down.

1428
01:43:02,417 --> 01:43:03,542
Stand down.

1429
01:43:03,625 --> 01:43:04,750
Ward!

1430
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:08,208
Ward!

1431
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:11,083
No!

1432
01:43:11,167 --> 01:43:12,000
Daryl!

1433
01:43:13,083 --> 01:43:14,208
You're safe now.

1434
01:43:14,792 --> 01:43:17,125
Ward!

1435
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:24,042
Daryl!

1436
01:43:28,583 --> 01:43:30,333
Ward!

1437
01:43:31,042 --> 01:43:32,500
Ward!

1438
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:55,833
I know. I gotcha.

1439
01:44:06,292 --> 01:44:07,375
Got him!

1440
01:44:07,583 --> 01:44:10,000
Ward! We made it!

1441
01:44:10,417 --> 01:44:11,583
We got out!

1442
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,667
I got you. You're okay.

1443
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,333
Are you okay?

1444
01:44:16,417 --> 01:44:18,375
Breathe, Ward.

1445
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:20,875
Say something.

1446
01:44:24,917 --> 01:44:27,917
Nick... look.

1447
01:44:29,958 --> 01:44:30,875
Oh.

1448
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:15,167
Still not my friend.

1449
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:22,542
I never really liked you anyway.

1450
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:26,917
Think you're a big dog
now you're blooded, huh?

1451
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,292
Yeah, pretty big.

1452
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:32,708
Hey, Nick.

1453
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:34,583
Yeah.

1454
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:36,917
Fuck magic.

1455
01:45:38,167 --> 01:45:42,042
Well, I don't know.
I still think it's kinda cool.

1456
01:45:45,958 --> 01:45:47,333
How you doing, fellas?

1457
01:45:47,833 --> 01:45:49,792
- Good?
- Hey.

1458
01:45:50,833 --> 01:45:53,417
Nick, the firemen are here.

1459
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,167
- We should've been firemen.
- Yeah.

1460
01:45:56,708 --> 01:45:59,417
Hey, can I get a aspirin?

1461
01:46:25,792 --> 01:46:27,250
Hey, Clan Blood.

1462
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:28,792
Daryl.

1463
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:31,083
Oh, Daryl.

1464
01:46:31,667 --> 01:46:32,875
How are you feeling?

1465
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:35,167
You feeling okay?

1466
01:46:38,292 --> 01:46:39,375
Uh, yeah.

1467
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:41,167
Okay, I get it.

1468
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:45,833
Oh, shit.

1469
01:46:46,042 --> 01:46:47,542
Well, that can't be good.

1470
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:48,583
Yeah.

1471
01:46:49,417 --> 01:46:50,833
Why you not locked up?

1472
01:46:51,625 --> 01:46:54,750
I think they think
you're more dangerous than me.

1473
01:46:57,125 --> 01:46:57,958
Hey.

1474
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:02,542
Don't say shit.

1475
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:19,625
- Sir, we were just responding to a call.
- Mmm.

1476
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:23,125
My partner and I, we...
But there was all this crazy magic stuff.

1477
01:47:23,208 --> 01:47:25,208
I mean, everything that happened
with Brown...

1478
01:47:25,292 --> 01:47:27,583
- Hey, hey, hey.
- ...and Hicks and Pollard and Ching...

1479
01:47:27,667 --> 01:47:30,167
- They wanted Officer Ward to shoot me.
- Hey. Nick.

1480
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:34,125
They wanted to him to kill me
so they could get the Wand, remember?

1481
01:47:34,208 --> 01:47:36,458
And he wouldn't do it
'cause he's a stand-up guy.

1482
01:47:36,542 --> 01:47:39,292
He wouldn't do it. But then they said
they would kill me, so he...

1483
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:40,875
he had to take action,

1484
01:47:40,958 --> 01:47:43,583
- like, with his gun, right?
- No. That's not my recollection.

1485
01:47:43,667 --> 01:47:45,458
Hey, Nick, why don't you just...

1486
01:47:45,542 --> 01:47:46,583
If you hold up a second...

1487
01:47:46,667 --> 01:47:49,125
- What?
- ...they'll ask us questions.

1488
01:47:49,208 --> 01:47:51,875
It's what happened, I swear to God.
We just returned to the call.

1489
01:47:51,958 --> 01:47:55,667
But there are forces at play
that are beyond.

1490
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:57,625
- There was, uh, an Elf woman.
- Hey, Nick.

1491
01:47:57,708 --> 01:47:59,250
She owned the Wand. Right?

1492
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:02,625
It must've been hers. Not a nice lady.
Dressed very well, but... Like you.

1493
01:48:02,708 --> 01:48:05,042
But she was a terrible woman. She...

1494
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:07,500
- Uh, she served the Dark Lord.
- Nick...

1495
01:48:07,583 --> 01:48:08,667
- I know it.
- Let them...

1496
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:11,083
- Let them ask us questions.
- They need to know this.

1497
01:48:11,167 --> 01:48:13,458
- Let him ask us questions.
- There was an Angel.

1498
01:48:13,542 --> 01:48:16,292
All right. That was then
when the gangsters were chasing us.

1499
01:48:16,375 --> 01:48:19,417
- Uh, the context is a little off.
- Tikka.

1500
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,458
Oh, Tikka.

1501
01:48:21,542 --> 01:48:24,375
So sad. Tikka...
Tikka was a young Bright.

1502
01:48:24,458 --> 01:48:25,833
She... She... She...

1503
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:29,583
She... She used the Wand
and she saved my life.

1504
01:48:29,708 --> 01:48:34,833
I was... My soul was leaving my body,
and she brought me back.

1505
01:48:37,083 --> 01:48:37,917
Officer Ward?

1506
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:40,708
We responded to a 415 disturbance call.

1507
01:48:41,208 --> 01:48:45,542
Uh, upon approaching the residence,
we realized that it was a safe house

1508
01:48:45,625 --> 01:48:48,833
- for an extremist group.
- Full of weird...

1509
01:48:48,917 --> 01:48:50,833
We immediately took fire,

1510
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:53,792
uh, at which point we called for backup.

1511
01:48:54,208 --> 01:48:56,750
And... unfortunately...

1512
01:48:57,292 --> 01:49:01,750
- officers were killed in the exchange.
- I've never seen shooting like it.

1513
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:03,792
He turned around, sight unseen,

1514
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:06,917
four of them, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Dropped...

1515
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:09,375
like it was one bullet.

1516
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:10,833
Sorry, keep going.

1517
01:49:12,208 --> 01:49:14,458
Gangsters showed up,

1518
01:49:14,542 --> 01:49:17,750
and it just went really sideways
from that point.

1519
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:19,875
And had you guys not shown up...

1520
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,708
it would've... it would've been really bad.

1521
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:26,875
Uh, so the real heroes in this
are you guys.

1522
01:49:27,417 --> 01:49:29,042
So we wanna say thank you.

1523
01:49:29,167 --> 01:49:32,792
Nick, thank the nice federal agents.

1524
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:35,542
Thank you.

1525
01:49:36,042 --> 01:49:40,042
So, let me say, unequivocally...

1526
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:45,000
there was no Wand.

1527
01:49:46,375 --> 01:49:49,125
And there was no magic.

1528
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:51,333
Just a couple of street cops...

1529
01:49:52,417 --> 01:49:53,833
doing our job.

1530
01:49:55,583 --> 01:49:57,583
Oh, I know what this is.

1531
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:00,417
Then that's what happened?

1532
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,167
Yes, sir. That's exactly what happened.

1533
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:04,667
Yes?

1534
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,292
No, I'm with him.

1535
01:50:07,917 --> 01:50:10,125
Unequivocally.

1536
01:50:10,458 --> 01:50:14,625
Faced with armed terrorists obsessed
with myths from thousands of years ago,

1537
01:50:15,042 --> 01:50:17,167
two of our officers held the line.

1538
01:50:17,792 --> 01:50:21,000
I hate seeing those scumbags
up there with Rodriguez.

1539
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:23,042
Let it go, Ward.

1540
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,292
We know, okay? That's enough.

1541
01:50:27,375 --> 01:50:32,250
Officer Daryl Ward, and our nation's first
Orkish police officer, Nicholas Jakoby.

1542
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:35,167
Officer Jakoby.

1543
01:50:46,417 --> 01:50:47,542
Congratulations, Ward.
