Morning.

Ward.

29
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,541
Red sauce? Green sauce?

30
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,500
Babe, you up?

31
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,250
It's after noon, you gotta get up.

32
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,458
I made some coffee, come on.

33
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,083
There he is.

34
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,083
Morning.
- Afternoon.

35
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,958
Hi.
- Hi.

36
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:13,875
Hi.

37
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,375
Coffee.
- I know.

38
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,583
What the hell's this in my...

39
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,250
What's that shit in there?
- What?

40
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,625
Whoops.
- Yeah.

41
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,625
Ran out of coffee filters,
had to use a napkin.

42
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,875
It'll be fine.
- I'll just chew that up next time.

43
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,166
Oh, come on.

44
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,750
Why is the Fairy in the bird feeder again?

45
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,125
I... I thought...
- You told me that you killed it.

46
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,875
All right, I'm gonna be honest with you.
All right?

47
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,500
Please.
- I don't fuck with no Fairies.

48
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,000
You need to fuck with that one.

49
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,916
When I was little, my cousin DayDay
was throwing rocks at this Fairy.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,291
The Fairy shit in his own hand...
- Uh-huh.

51
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,250
...threw the shit,
and it went in DayDay's eye,

52
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,000
and it was like a fucking cantaloupe.

53
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,125
Bullshit story.
- No, he almost lost his eye.

54
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,291
I'm telling you. Listen...
- That's not true.

55
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,041
$200. Pay the man.
Same man that does the bees.

56
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,583
No, I'm not paying $200.

57
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,750
I got this big, handsome, strapping man
standing right in front of me.

58
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,666
Go kill that Fairy, please.
Thank you so much.

59
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,500
I'll kill the Fairy.
Let me finish my coffee.

60
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,166
I'mma kill the Fairy. All right?
- Okay.

61
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,250
That may kill you. You should do it
before you finish the coffee.

62
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,333
How was work?
- Eh, work. Work is good, you know?

63
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,458
Just, a lot of stab wounds lately.
There's, uh...

64
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,791
We had this homeless guy come in,
throwing equipment everywhere.

65
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:22,958
It was wild.

66
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,583
A lot of traffic accidents,

67
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,875
and this older guy, he coded out on me.
- What about that cop that's an Orc

68
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,291
that's now on the LAPD force?

69
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,041
How does that work?
- He's not blooded.

70
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,166
He's not part of any blooded clan.

71
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:37,416
He's like a finger
that got cut off the hand.

72
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,791
He's dead to us.

73
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,708
This is shock trauma at its finest.

74
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,083
...and then you see the humans
and the Elves...

75
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,875
I don't want this guy in my car either.

76
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,166
Baby, I don't want you to get shot again.

77
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,125
Five years, I'm gonna retire.

78
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,791
But... I can't fuck up my pension.

79
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,708
All right? I mean,
that's my fucking worst nightmare.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,916
You know what my worst nightmare is?

81
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,791
It's them wheeling you in
when I'm at work.

82
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,750
That's my nightmare.

83
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,541
Come on. Come here.

84
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,250
Fairy. Now.

85
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey, y'all, I want y'all to trip off
my police-ass neighbor. He's a trip.

86
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,750
Good afternoon, Officer.
- Hey. What up, Mike?

87
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,791
Yo, that Fairy been all up in my crib,

88
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,708
eating up my dog food and shit.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,458
I'm about to call the city, man.

90
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,375
I am the city.

91
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,750
All right? You save your dime.

92
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,291
Fairy lives don't matter today.

93
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,458
Check this out, y'all.
This is probably gonna be good.

94
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,375
It's on now!

95
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,041
Ring the bell, y'all.

96
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,958
Oh!

97
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,250
Damn. Look at this nigga, man.

98
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,416
Oh, that's it right there.

99
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,666
Oh, you got it now. Take the homie out
LAPD-style like you do.

100
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,750
Oh!

101
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,250
You ain't gotta do him like that. Damn!

102
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,625
That was nasty.

103
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,291
Man.
- Come on, G.

104
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,166
It's what I do.
- Oh, shit.

105
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,541
Oh, and, uh, you keep doing
all your gangsta stuff.

106
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,416
I'm just trying to sell my house.
Don't worry about that.

107
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,958
Thanks for the show, Officer.

108
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:42,000
He's a trip. That motherfucker's crazy.
Got a fine-ass wife, too.

109
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,291
Are you in trouble?

110
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,791
Am I in trouble?
What your mother say to you?

111
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,083
Mom said that Nick got you in trouble
because Orcs are dumb.

112
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,875
That's not true, all right?
Orcs are not dumb.

113
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:58,375
Just, uh... All of the races
are-are different. Okay?

114
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:02,416
And just 'cause they're different
doesn't mean anybody's smarter

115
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,208
or dumber, you know,

116
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,458
better or worse than anybody.

117
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,375
All right? It's just-just...

118
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,833
You know, everybody's just trying
to get along and-and...

119
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,625
have a good life.

120
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,875
What the hell?

121
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,458
Hey, baby, you gotta take some clothes.
Get some clothes.

122
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,416
Fine.

123
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,625
Hey, hey!

124
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,875
Hey, partner.

125
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,708
Ready to get back to work? All healed up?

126
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,708
What the hell are you doing at my house?

127
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,958
Why are you at my house?
Why are you on my lawn?

128
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,291
Your lawn's dead, Ward.

129
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,125
Exactly. Which is why I seeded it

130
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,250
and spread cow shit everywhere
so it grows back.

131
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,583
That's not really cow shit.

132
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you mean it's not cow shit?
- It's sewage, from toilets.

133
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,250
From the treatment plant, swear to God.

134
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,875
I paid $400 for this.

135
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,750
That's bullshit.
- Human shit.

136
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,125
Why do you think I compost?
- Whatever. Whatever. Whatever.

137
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,333
You don't ever come here in that
ever again.

138
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:57,208
I was at diversity training. Your house
is on the way to the bar. I thought...

139
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,166
Hi, Nick.
- Hey, Sophia. What's up, rock star?

140
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,500
We're gonna go to Grandma's.

141
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,166
Grandma's? Hop in, we'll give you a ride.
- Shut up.

142
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,291
This ain't no Uber, man.
- Don't tell Nick to shut up.

143
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,750
He's a person, too.

144
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

145

Daryl.

146

Don't worry about me.

147
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,708
Just Crip-walk your asses
on back to the barbecue.

148
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,958
Be nice to give you a ride...

149
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,958
Shut up.

158
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,375
All right, baby. What's up?

159
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,125
What's happening? What's up?
Why you sad?

160
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:08,958
What happened?

161
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,458
I don't want you to die.

162
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,833
I'm not gonna die. What are you...

163
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,250
What you talking about?
- Mama said Nick's gonna get you killed.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,291
I don't know why she said...

165
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,500
Nick is not gonna get me killed,
all right?

166
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,833
Why do you have to be a policeman?

167
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,208
Everybody hates policemen.

168
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,250
Hey...

169
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,166
Know what?
You smell like you haven't slept.

170
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,750
I have melatonin in my war bag.
You take one before bed,

171
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:00,458
turn off the laptop, get...
- Maybe I'm having trouble sleeping

172
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,000
because of the nightmares I'm having

173
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,500
from being blasted across the street
with a shotgun

174
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,458
while your ass was getting a burrito.

175
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,541
But I was getting a burrito for you.

176
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,541
Yeah...
- I don't eat cow flesh.

177
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,125
Do you think that you could get a burrito

178
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,125
and do your job?

179
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,875
You think you could get a burrito
and watch my back

180
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,541
like every other cop manages to do?
- Yes.

181
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,875
Look, I know... you're disappointed in me.

182
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,791
I know that you think that I let you down.

183
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,541
Yeah. You know what?
- But I...

184
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,791
You know what? It's a new day.

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,916
Back to work. We hitting the reset button.

186
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,791
Copy that. Copy that.
We're hitting the reset button.

187
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:42,500
Moving forward together.

188
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,541
As friends, together.

189
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,541
We will not be listening
to no Orkish music.

190
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,875
That is one of the greatest love songs
ever written.

191
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,750
That's a love song in prison.

192
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,083
I believe that you're lacking in love,
Ward.

193
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,208
I'm what?
- By love, I mean...

194
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:10,541
like... physical love.

195
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,375
Yeah. Um...

196
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,416
Right?

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,208
I'm straight. I don't need
no physical love. Trust me, I'm good.

198
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,750
You can't hide it, Ward.

199
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,291
Humans have physical tells.

200
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,458
Tells, huh?
- Yeah.

201
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,916
It's called a face.
- I ain't making no face.

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,125
Like the face you're making right now.
- I ain't making no face.

203
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,250
All right.

204
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,166
What face am I making?

205
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,083
"A human who needs a lot more
conjugal love" type face.

206
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,125
"Conjugal love" face.
So you know human face...

207
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,541
Show me another human face.

208
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,291
What's another one we make?
- Oh, uh...

209
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:54,041
What's that face?
- Human who doesn't get anymore pancakes.

210
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,750
We do like our pancakes, for real.
- I got a lot of 'em.

211
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,333
You got a lot?
- I got a lot of them.

212
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:04,833
Show me the face an Orc makes
when he just shut the fuck up,

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,250
and don't say shit,
and just drive to work.

214
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,708
Yeah, that's it! That's it!
Oh, you got that one!

215
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,625
Yeah, you killing that one.

216
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,625
You should do that one.
Do that one, like, all the time.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Whoa. Whoa. Why you going this way?

218
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,166
It's fine, it's a shortcut.

219
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,583
See? They're very nice here.

220
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,083
Dude, you can't go through Elftown.

221
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,375
You are killing me. Killing me, dude.

222
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,541
So, what, you trying to...
get yourself some designer shoes?

223
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,708
Ain't nothing over here but rich-ass Elves

224
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,125
just running the world and shopping.

225
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,000
I hate Elftown.

226
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,583
Even the chauffeurs are snobs.

227
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,166
♪ I'm running for the crown ♪

228
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,041
♪ Running for the crown ♪

229
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,041
♪ So heavy on my, heavy on my bones ♪

230
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,666
♪ When I'm sittin' on my
Sittin' on my throne ♪

231
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,000
♪ I'm running for the ♪

232
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,916
Hey. Back already, Ward?

233
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,791
Where's the, uh,
diversity hire you ride with?

234
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,125
Yeah, what kind of partner is Jakoby?
Is he your dance partner?

235
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,375
Your sexual partner?

236
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,500
'Cause he fucking sucks
at catching bad guys.

237
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,250
That's Clan Law shit, dog.

238
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,291
Orcs got each other's backs.

239
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,333
Hey, look, why y'all acting like
I put this dude in my car?

240
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,250
So what are you doing to get him
the fuck out of this division?

241
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,833
Hey, long as he pull his weight,
I ain't got no beef with him.

242
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,416
No. No, no, no. You could do shit, man.

243
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,541
You could write a letter.
His ass would be gone if we back you up.

244
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:08,833
That's a fact.

245
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,166
But you only care about yourself, Ward.
- Right.

246
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,541
Did I... Did I ask you for advice?

247
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,833
'Cause I'll probably wait till I'm on my,
like, ninth divorce,

248
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,875
then your advice
will come in really handy.

249
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,541
That's good. That's fucking good. Noted.

250
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,583
Meanwhile, that Orc fuck
is still out there

251
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,833
because Jakoby chose clan blood
over the badge.

252
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,708
Or the motherfucker just got away.

253
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,416
He got away 'cause Jakoby let him.

254
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,458
What happens next?

255
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,666
What happens the next time
this pig motherfucker

256
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,125
makes a cop suck-start
his fucking 12-gauge?

257
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,000
Only this time, it's Brown,

258
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,166
or it's Hicks, or it's fucking me.

259
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,416
How you gonna feel, Ward?
'Cause that shit is on you.

260
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,125
Well, if you in the box,
I'll probably be like...

261
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,000
Ward, you son of a bitch.

262
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,708
Hey, look, I got a dude in my car,

263
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,958
the whole world is watching, all right?

264
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,500
I didn't ask for it, I don't want it,
but I don't get a vote.

265
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,083
And what happens if they hire more?
You know what they say.

266
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,166
Once with the Dark Lord,
always with the Dark Lord.

267
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,541
They chose evil.

268
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,708
Here's the thing I can't understand.

269
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:13,083
How do a bunch of dudes who can barely
remember their baby mama's birthday

270
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,291
have beef with a whole race

271
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,833
over some shit that happened
2.000 years ago?

272
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,125
Here's the fucking deal, man.

273
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,875
You keep Jakoby
the fuck away from me. Okay?

274
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,833
I'll drop an Orc. I don't give a fuck.

275
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,083
My ancestors killed them
by the fucking thousands in Russia.

276
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,000
Attaboy, Ward!
- About time, Ward.

277
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,416
All right, settle down,
settle down. The captain's coming.

278
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,541
Ward, I saved you a seat.

279
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,125
Take it away, boss.

280
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,708
Ward, nice to see you back.

281
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,750
Cap.

282
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,750
Tonight's the trifecta.
- Hey, is that your cousin?

283
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,250
Full moon, Friday night...

284
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,083
No.
- ...summer heat wave.

285
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,250
That means: clear your calls fast,

286
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,000
help your colleagues clear theirs,

287
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,125
get me out of this deployment period
without another murder,

288
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,333
I'll buy you all coffee.

289
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,958
Sergeant Ching, all yours.

290
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,875
All right, after I call your name,
get your shotguns and radios and deploy.

291
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,541
I don't want to see you here
unless there's bad guys under the desks.

292
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,166
Three-Mary-25, Pollard.

293
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,000
Three-Mary-55, Kim.

294
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,041
Three-Mary-60, Thomas.

295
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,833
Three-A-21, Pippen and Gosser.

296
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,750
Three-A-54, Hancock and Wheeler.

297
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,041
Three-A-80, Crawford and Duncan.

298
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,333
Three-A-9, Jakoby and Ward.

299
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,250
Three-A-34, Jones and Morengo.
- Hey, uh, hit the kit room.

300
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,125
Three-A-82, Ortiz and Mencia...
- I'll meet you at the gas pumps.

301
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,333
I'll be right down. I just need to...
- Okay.

302
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,083
Three-A-99...

303
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,583
No.
- Yes. Put him in another car.

304
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,583
What the fuck about my demeanor
gives you the impression

305
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:49,041
that I want to be a target
on the department's Orc-diversity radar?

306
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,541
These decisions are made
nine miles above me.

307
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,666
No. They're made right on your paper,
right there.

308
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,708
Scratch him out.

309
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,208
Scratch his name out.
Put another name, anybody.

310
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,000
Ward, no one wants to ride with you.

311
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,375
Goodbye. Don't get shot again.

312
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,416
Good luck.

313
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,750
Hey, looking good, bud.
- Looking real good. Real good.

314
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,291
Be safe, guys.

315
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,125
What's up, homies?

316
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,875
Your ass still alive?

317
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,958
You know something about that?

318
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,416
It wasn't me.

319
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,083
Get the fuck off of the street
or I'mma call your PO,

320
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000
tell him you out drinking
with the homies.

321
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,458
I ain't gonna tell you two times.

322
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:06,791
Let's go.

323
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,666
I need to know if the shit pop off
with these Fogteeth fools

324
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,083
that you got my back,
that you a cop first.

325
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,291
Are we clear?

326
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,625
Clear.

327
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,500
I'm about dope, money, and guns.
That's my job.

328
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,250
Your job is to make sure
I go home at night.

329
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,083
I don't like this small talk.
- This ain't no small talk.

330
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,625
This is big-ass talk.

331
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,000
We doing real shit out here.

332
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,708
All Westlake units,
three-A-4 is requesting assistance.

333
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,166
Sixth and Whitmore. Sixth and Whitmore.

334
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,541
All Westlake units, Three-A-4...

335
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,916
Get him the fuck on the ground!

336
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,625
Back the fuck up!

337
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,541
Stay there! Stay right fucking there!

338
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,041
Do not resist! Don't...
- Shut the fuck up!

339
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,166
I need to know if you're a cop first...

340
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,333
or an Orc first.

341
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,750
I need to hear you say it.
- Ward, I...

342
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,833
I wanted to be a cop
since I was a little kid.

343
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,083
I am nothing else.

344
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,541
My badge means more to me
than the air I breathe.

345
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,208
So don't question me.

346
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,083
Three-A-9, 415. Fifth and Westlake.

347
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,166
Code two, incident 2415.

348
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,750
Three-Adam-9. Roger, show us en route.

349
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,625
Three-A-9, roger.

350
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,666
The fuck outta here.

351
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,416
God damn it!

352
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,208
Rodriguez. Hey.

353
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, shit, man. I thought you were dead.

354
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,000
Nah, man, too many bills to pay.

355
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,250
I hear ya.

356
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,000
I thought you were out
having your, like, zillionth baby.

357
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,791
Ah, nah, man. Marisol's a week late.
We're inducing next week, though.

358
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,875
Number five.

359
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,708
Five.
- Lot of mouths to feed.

360
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,666
Yeah, man.

361
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,666
Sir...

362
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,875
drop the sword.

363
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,291
You.

364
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,541
The Army of Nine Races
fought shoulder to shoulder

365
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,000
to give you the world you neglect.

366
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,125
Hey, tell him to shut up.
- 2.000 years ago,

367
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,291
we fought them with swords and arrows.
- Sir...

368
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:46,708
And now, the Dark One returns
to reclaim Orc hearts!

369
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:50,625
Everywhere I go, why have Orcs
always gotta be the bad guys?

370
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,541
Hey, don't look at me, man.
Mexicans still get shit for the Alamo.

371
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,791
Get back! Get back!

372
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:02,500
Sir, unless you wanna die,
you drop that sword right fucking now!

373
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,375
Hey, you got me shot,
don't get me stabbed.

374
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,250
Turn around, sir.

375
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,083
Hands on your head.
- I'm doing it, man. Jeez.

376
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,791
On your knees.
- I... All right.

377
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,291
Don't move.

378
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,500
Having a little fun.

379
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,416
Aah! Shit!

380
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,875
All right. Damn.

381
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,083
I'm not resisting, man.

382
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,916
Three-Adam-9, one in custody.

383
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,375
All units, code four.
Fifth and Westlake, suspect in custody.

384
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,250
Okay, man, easy. Gimme a... Gimme a... Ow!

385
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:50,541
Hey.
- Hey.

386
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,458
Real quick.

387
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,791
Gang intel said Fogteeth's been smashing
like a motherfucker,

388
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,875
and Altamira's gangbanging like it's 1999.

389
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,833
Watch your backs out there.
- Hey, you too.

390
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,916
All right, brother.
- Kiss your family.

391
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,041
Sir, can you sit back?

392
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,083
You-You stink like shit. Can you sit back?

393
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,208
Thank you.

394
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:23,416
Come on.

395
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,208
That's bad.

396
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,875
I have a message
from the Shield of Light.

397
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,041
Remember the old ways.

398
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,000
Remember what you are.

399
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,541
Is that Orkish?

400
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,375
How the hell do you know
how to speak Orkish?

401
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:45,833
What'd he say?

402
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,750
Remember your traditions.

403
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,541
Only clan ways can save you.

404
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,166
The Prophecy has chosen you.

405
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,625
The man with you is blessed.

406
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,666
Jakoby!

407
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,666
Come on, man.

408
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,250
What the hell is your problem?
What'd he say?

409
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,583
He's not making any sense.

410
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:32,833
Where's Jakoby?

411
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,083
Uh, booking our body, ma'am.

412
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,333
Um, I love your hair.

413
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,083
Who are you?

414
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,625
I'm the unemployment line,
or a prison sentence.

415
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:47,333
I could be the Angel of Mercy,
but it's up to you, buddy.

416
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,375
Ah.

417
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,500
Internal Affairs.

418
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:54,291
That's right, all fucking day long.
Now, let's review, kids.

419
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:58,625
Some pigskin piece of shit puts a load
of buckshot into your trauma plate.

420
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:01,000
Shithead foot-bails, Jakoby pursues...
- Hey!

421
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,541
Hey!

422
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,416
Police! Stop!

423
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,208
...corners his asshole in, what,
a dead-end alley?

424
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,916
Jakoby states dude tackled
and disarmed him.

425
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,125
Then jumped on a fire escape ladder
and evaded arrest.

426
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,208
Jakoby's signed statement.

427
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,416
Ladder's 13 feet off the ground.
We measured.

428
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,833
Mm-hmm.
- No Orc has a six-foot vertical.

429
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,583
Perhaps the suspect
was light on his feet, sir.

430
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:28,083
Do Orcs have, uh, mad hops?

431
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,708
How many Orcs are ballers?

432
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,000
Excuse me?
- You fuckin' heard the detective.

433
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:34,416
How many Orcs play pro basketball?
- None.

434
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,958
They're slow, they're heavy.

435
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,333
That's why half the NFL
defensive lines are Orkish.

436
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,708
It's not racism, it's physics.

437
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:42,458
Jakoby kicked loose that pigskin fuck
who blasted you.

438
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:43,750
Do the math.

439
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,750
Orcs hold Clan Law above all else.
That's a fact.

440
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,541
The Jakoby issue is sensitive.
The world's watching.

441
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,416
We can't fire him without cause.
- Which is why...

442
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,083
you're gonna get him to admit it...

443
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,500
and you're gonna record him.

444
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,750
The fuck outta here.

445
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,708
I want the guy out of my car, but...

446
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,333
I snitch, I'm done as a street cop.

447
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:15,375
We know, uh, you got a house note
you can't pay down.

448
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,041
Right? Drowning in debt.

449
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,208
Raising a little girl
you can't afford to pay for.

450
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,583
Mmm.

451
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,083
Father of the fucking year.

452
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:32,083
You talk about my family again,
I'll split your fucking head open.

453
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,000
Ward.

454
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,083
You need this job.

455
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,333
Don't throw it away for Jakoby.

456
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,291
Get off me. Get off me.

457
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,666
Give it to me.

458
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,458
No testifying...

459
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,000
no depositions,

460
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,291
no paperwork.

461
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,250
Good man.

462
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,000
Very smart.

463
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:10,000
Shave your mustache, bitch.

464
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,625
It's just business.

465
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,208
Place is a shithole.

466
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,625
An Orc with a badge.

467
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,416
Incredible.

468
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,250
That's some shit you don't see every day.
Like an Elf with a mop.

469
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,000
Did you see those two guys?

470
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,125
I think they're feds.
Could they be here for me?

471
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:51,875
Feds don't give a shit
about the LA Orc community.

472
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,333
Yeah, you're right.

473
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,250
S... So, my-my daughter...

474
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,041
um...

475
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,333
Sophia...

476
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:25,500
she be doing shit all the time, man,
that she don't have no business doing.

477
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,666
Um...

478
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:30,791
But... she comes clean.

479
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,625
She always tells the truth.

480
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:37,541
'Cause she realized it feels good.

481
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:41,541
Feels good to her, feels good to me.

482
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:44,208
And, uh, truth just has a way...

483
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,750
of clearing the air between people.

484
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,458
If it cleanses...
cleanses some shit, you know,

485
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:53,500
it's like, just tell the truth.

486
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,708
I know something very bad happened
at the station.

487
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,833
I know.

488
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,666
So are you gonna tell me about it or no?

489
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,041
I'm talking about you. All right?

490
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:06,416
Don't be trying to twist this.
Nothing happened at the...

491
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,375
I'm not...
- ...trouble, 341 Abrams.

492
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,583
Code two, incident 2815.

493
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:14,708
Three-Adam-9, show us en route.

494
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,041
341 Abrams.

495
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:19,458
Three-A-9, roger.

496
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,291
How long you been in Shield of Light?

497
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:28,916
What's that?

498
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,208
God!

499
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:32,916
You little fuck-up.

500
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,875
Aah! Shit! What are you doing, man?

501
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,666
No questions, just shut up.

502
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:42,416
Hey, nice Shield of Light tattoo!

503
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,625
Good one.
- You know who we are?

504
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,791
Housekeeping.

505
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,708
You might wanna look at this.

506
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,083
Fuck. Magic Task Force.

507
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:55,458
Right. The magic feds.

508
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:59,958
You know, Serling,
if you're gonna play stupid games,

509
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:02,416
you're gonna win stupid prizes.

510
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,333
Fuck you.

511
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:04,916
You wanna test me, asshole?

512
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,583
Okay! I'm not your enemy, man.

513
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,166
What do you know about the Inferni?

514
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,750
Um... they're Elves.

515
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,375
Renegade Elves.

516
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:19,125
Renegade Elves, sorry.

517
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,083
Because Elves are awesome, right?

518
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:26,500
They're gonna bring back the Dark Lord.

519
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,833
Fairy fucking tales.

520
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,583
How do they plan to do that?

521
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:35,500
When they get three Magic Wands,
they can raise him from the dead.

522
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,583
You recognize her?

523
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,416
That's Leilah.

524
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:45,000
She's an Inferni coven leader.

525
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,666
She's a Bright.

526
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,791
You ever notice how
most Brights are Elves,

527
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,083
and Elves run the world?

528
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,250
Coincidence?

529
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,333
There are human Brights.

530
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,250
One in a million.

531
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,250
But you know how you know
if you're a Bright?

532
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,083
When you touch a Wand...

533
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,291
with your bare hand...

534
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,291
and don't explode.

535
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:18,708
Would you do that?

536
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:22,708
Would you die to learn the truth
about yourself?

537
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:26,750
If I had a Wand... I'd try.

538
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,208
Let's get back on track.

539
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:32,125
So Leilah has a Magic Wand,
and she's coming after Tikka, right?

540
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,916
And she'll shred this city to do it.

541
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,833
We get Tikka,
we can set a trap for Leilah.

542
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:40,625
We hunt Wands, we hunt Brights.

543
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,916
That's what we do,
and we're pretty fucking good at it.

544
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,208
You wanna help us?

545
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:46,375
Come on.

546
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,500
The Dark Lord's coming.

547
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:56,333
What, are you gonna to fight him with,
with tanks?

548
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:59,166
Huh? You gonna drone him?

549
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:05,625
Two thousand years ago, magic stopped him.

550
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,083
And magic will stop him again.

551
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:14,458
One day, you all are gonna come begging
for our help.

552
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,625
And we'll be there. We'll stop him.

553
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,083
The Shield of Light will stop him.

554
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:22,750
I'm done.

555
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:25,833
We're done.

556
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,458
If you act like my enemy...

557
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:33,000
you become my enemy.

558
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:43,375
See that?

559
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,291
Oh, it's a spotter.
- Mm-hmm.

560
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,666
Get down! Down! Go!

561
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:12,625
Oh. Yeah, that's... That's not good.

562
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,041
Yeah.
- We could die.

563
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,750
First time being shot at?
- Yeah.

564
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:21,291
I have to say, I dislike it very much.

565
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,083
Yeah, it fucking sucks.

566
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,708
All right, look... on three,
we're gonna dump this asshole.

567
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,166
All right?

568
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,083
Right. That makes sense.
Use force.

569
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,333
All right.
- Yeah.

570
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,333
One, two, three.

571
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,750
You all right?
- Hmm? Yeah.

572
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,583
No holes?
- Huh? Uh...

573
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,500
Only the ones that I was born with.

574
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,333
How are your holes?

575
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
The fuck can you make
a shootout awkward?

576
00:32:54,166 --> 00:32:55,000
Sorry.

577
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,791
Sorry.

578
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,125
Wait for the reload! All right?

579
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,125
He's gonna have to reload.
- Reload.

580
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:08,458
Now!

581
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,458
Shit.

582
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,250
We got him.

583
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:25,000
Get the door. Get the door.

584
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:32,083
Shouldn't we wait for the cavalry?
- We are the cavalry.

585
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,041
Ward, can't we wait for backup? Ward.

586
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,000
Go, go, go.

587
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,416
I smell blood, Ward.

588
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,708
Lots of blood.

589
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,500
What's that?
- Don't know.

590
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:55,375
Oh, shit.

591
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:00,958
Body. Body.
- What?

592
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,250
Shit. Shit.

593
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,458
Cover the hall.

594
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,083
What the fuck is that?
- Cover the hall.

595
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,041
Okay.

596
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,708
Oh, shit.

597
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,208
Don't touch anything.

598
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:24,541
Yeah.

599
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,000
Body.
- Wh...?

600
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,375
That's our shooter, he's down.

601
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,833
Someone's in here. I can smell them.

602
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,541
These people died so bad.

603
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,708
Clear.

604
00:34:56,791 --> 00:35:00,125
Something unusual has happened here.

605
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:02,541
Three-Adam-9, 341 Abrams.

606
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,666
Possible Bright at our location.

607
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,750
Request additional units and a supervisor.

608
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,416
I repeat: Possible magic-user on scene.

609
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,625
Hey! Freeze!

610
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,625
You! Wait, stop!

611
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,208
Hey! Hey!

612
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,791
Stop running!

613
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,291
Hold her, hold her!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

614
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,375
What has she got?

615
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,208
What is that? What is that?

616
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,458
Go get the homies.

617
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,833
Put it down or I'm gonna shoot you
in your face!

618
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:57,666
Is that...?

619
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,458
It's a Magic Wand.

620
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,208
Who, uh...

621
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,625
Who are you?

622
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,541
Please protect me.

623
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,166
She's speaking Elvish.

624
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,041
I don't speak Elvish.

625
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,125
Well, I took two years in high school,
but, uh...

626
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,291
She said somebody's coming.

627
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,416
Please protect me and the Wand.

628
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,125
As far as I can tell, a Bright came in,
used the Wand, and...

629
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,583
magicked everybody the fuck up. Uh...

630
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,833
We need to evacuate this neighborhood,
secure the scene,

631
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,708
hold the perimeter till the feds get here.

632
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:44,333
What the fuck are you, new?

633
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:48,291
This is way above our pay grade.
- That's magic right there.

634
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,375
That's whatever you want.

635
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:54,208
You want a million dollars?

636
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,333
You want ten million?

637
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,083
You wanna be taller or shorter?

638
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,208
Make your dick bigger?

639
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:04,958
You wanna go back in time, marry the girl
who didn't blow you on prom night?

640
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,708
That's how you do it, right there.

641
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,416
Well, clearly,
we had different prom nights.

642
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:13,416
But that is a Magic Wand,

643
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,291
and you don't know how to use it.

644
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,625
And you're gonna kill us all trying.

645
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:22,041
Only a Bright can use a Wand,
and you don't look like a wizard to me.

646
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:25,166
Don't put your hands on that Wand.

647
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,500
Hey, don't touch the Wand.
- I got it.

648
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,916
Don't touch it.

649
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,000
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be...

650
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,166
Fucking ice cold.

651
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,791
All right, you're not stealing that Wand.
- Nobody's coming, Ward.

652
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,166
Whoa. Hey...

653
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,166
Fuck is you squaring off on, bitch?

654
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,666
Hey, Sarge,
you need to talk to your boys right now.

655
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,125
You need this just as much as we do,
maybe more.

656
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,375
Your family depends on you.
Don't you wanna be there for them?

657
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,125
What about Jakoby?

658
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:12,041
Can you tell me your name?

659
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,208
Tikka.
- Tikka.

660
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,625
My name is Tikka.

661
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,291
We have to leave before she comes.

662
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,541
Before who comes?

663
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,416
It's not happening.

664
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,416
No. No.

665
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Pollard, he's spinning.

666
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,291
No, he's not spinning worth shit.
- He's fine, he's fine.

667
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,583
This is stupid.
- Calm down.

668
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:41,666
Hey, fucking chill. He's fine.
- Back up.

669
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,583
He's fin... Hey, hey!
- The fuck you gonna do?

670
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:46,666
Calm down. Fucking calm down.
Back the fuck up.

671
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,416
Back the fuck up. Listen. Listen.

672
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,625
This is happening.

673
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:55,000
This is fucking happening.
- Fuck off of me.

674
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,208
All right?

675
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,583
Fuck.
- It's okay.

676
00:38:58,583 --> 00:38:59,458
It's okay.

677
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:04,458
There's no version of you walking out
of here with life as you know it intact.

678
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,208
Fuck this. We are taking the Wand,
and the Orc dies.

679
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,125
And you got a big decision right now.

680
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:13,458
Either your little girl grows up
without a daddy and Jakoby dies,

681
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:17,041
or just Jakoby dies.
And it is time to make a choice.

682
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,500
You or him, Ward. You or him.

683
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:23,083
Is tomorrow's LA Times gonna say
one cop died here, or two?

684
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:27,125
Yeah, there it is.
He just caught up to it.

685
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,333
Everyone wins.

686
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:33,250
Department gets rid of Jakoby,
he dies a hero, public's happy.

687
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:35,333
This report writes itself.

688
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,375
The perfect storm, bro.

689
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,708
It's the perfect storm.

690
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,958
You okay?

691
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,500
Hey. Take Sophia,
get out of town right now.

692
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:57,833
What? Why?

693
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:01,125
Get out of town right now. I love you.

694
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:09,041
Ward, where is everyone?
We haven't even set a perimeter.

695
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,750
I'm pretty certain that pee-wee gangster
saw the Wand.

696
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:14,666
And she is spooked.
Says somebody's coming.

697
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,833
Like... Like, someone bad.

698
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:18,875
But what's...?

699
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,791
You seem like you-you have
bigger troubles.

700
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,208
You let the shooter go, didn't you?

701
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,416
'Cause he was clan blood?

702
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,875
Now? You wanna fucking go through this
right now?

703
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,875
What else you lie about, pigface?

704
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:35,041
Don't put your fucking hands on me!

705
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:37,625
You fucked me.

706
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,125
You fucked us both.

707
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,208
Pigskin piece of shit.

708
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:47,250
You fucked my whole life
over some stupid Orc knucklehead.

709
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:49,458
Fuck you, Ward.

710
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,458
Fuck off.

711
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,958
What...?
- I dare you.

712
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,333
I dare you to pull your gun. Please.

713
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:58,583
Go ahead.

714
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,375
I will fuck you up in a gunfight.

715
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,875
I gave you plenty of time
to talk about this shit.

716
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:12,583
Karma is a bitch, and here it come.
- I let him go.

717
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,708
So what's the real plan?

718
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:17,791
Two cops die tonight.

719
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:19,833
What about the Elf?

720
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,541
I'll kill her.

721
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,125
You good?
- Yes, sir.

722
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,083
Yeah.
- Sarge?

723
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,625
You see my teeth? They're filed.

724
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:33,333
I'm not blooded, my father's not blooded,
his father's not blooded.

725
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,958
I've been shit on by Orcs
my whole fucking life.

726
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:40,875
Huh? You know what that feels like,
when your own people hate you?

727
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,708
Why'd you lie, Nick?

728
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,625
It wasn't clan politics.

729
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,083
I just had the wrong guy.

730
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:49,416
Oh.

731
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:50,541
Story time?

732
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:53,291
The guy that shot you,
I lost him in the crowd.

733
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:57,708
I circled back, and I thought I had
that fucking guy dead to rights.

734
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:00,208
But it was a different kid.
He was just tagging.

735
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,583
And the troops are coming.

736
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:05,166
Jacked-up humans with guns
looking for an Orc who'd shot a cop.

737
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,083
You think that kid had a chance?

738
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:09,166
Go, go, go!

739
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,541
They would've dropped him on the spot,
so I did the right thing.

740
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,291
Code four.
- Clear.

741
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:18,458
You never saw his face. How'd you know
it wasn't the motherfucker that shot me?

742
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:20,125
His fucking smell.

743
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:24,791
Yeah, years of evolution haven't
taken away our sense of smell.

744
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,208
And he smelled different.

745
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:29,541
What human jury would believe me?
- What, he have Axe body spray?

746
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,791
Yeah, see, this is what
I have to fucking deal with.

747
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,916
The Orc that shot you...

748
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,500
got away.
- Ward!

749
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:39,250
It's time.

750
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,666
"It's... time"?

751
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,166
Time for... Time for what?

752
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,208
All four of 'em standing there?

753
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,875
Yeah.
- Your left to right, who is it?

754
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:58,000
Brown, Hicks, Pollard, and Ching.

Don't.

766
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,541
Partner, no!

767
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Drop it, or I will fucking kill you.

768
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,250
Hey, listen to me.

769
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:01,791
This isn't like you.

770
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,666
All right, calm down.

771
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,208
I know it looks bad.
- Shut up. Shut up, show me your hands.

772
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:12,291
I didn't have a choice, Nick.
- Shut up.

773
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:13,708
Now turn back around!

774
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:15,375
What's your plan?

775
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:16,791
I'm...

776
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,916
I'm gonna arrest you, so... so shut up!

777
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,208
First of all, stop telling me to shut up.

778
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,000
Second, I need you to shut up

779
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:25,625
and listen to me.
- Shut up!

780
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:28,250
Turn around! Get on your fucking knees!

781
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,375
Gonna have to fuckin' kill me if you think
you're gonna put me in handcuffs.

782
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:39,625
Ward...

783
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:46,666
Three-Adam-9.

784
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:50,708
I got four officers down,
one officer conscious and breathing.

785
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:51,875
Three officers...

786
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:53,500
KMA.

787
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,833
All units,
officer needs help, 341 Abrams.

788
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,791
Officer needs help, 341 Abrams.

789
00:44:57,875 --> 00:44:59,791
Roger on the RA.
- Oh, this is bad.

790
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:01,500
This is so bad.

791
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,958
Put your big girl panties on.

792
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:09,666
They were gonna kill us...
over that Wand, all right?

793
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,750
They were acting crazy.

794
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,625
Don't you say a word.
Not to me, not to anybody.

795
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,666
Jakoby?
Jakoby, who are these people?

796
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,166
Oh, shit. Put her in the truck.
Put her in the truck.

797
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,083
Keep the Wand safe!

798
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:24,958
Motherfucker, what?

799
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,875
Protect the Wand.

800
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:30,208
Those cops there... they okay?

801
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:32,750
That's a lot of blood, homes.

802
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:35,000
That ain't none of your concern.

803
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:38,666
Maybe you should go over and give 'em
a little mouth-to-mouth. Huh?

804
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:40,958
This is an active crime scene.

805
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:44,708
We ain't never had no beef, Poison.
Why don't you take your people home.

806
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,625
Word on the street,
there's a Wand in this hood.

807
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:48,958
Where's it at, man?

808
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,833
My hood.
- Altamira.

809
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,583
Alta-fucking-mira, eh?

810
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That's right.

811
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:58,583
So, when the little homies tell
that the cops are shooting each other

812
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:00,083
in my hood...

813
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,458
makes me wonder. Hmm?

814
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,291
Where's the Wand?

815
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:07,666
Ghetto rumors, homie.

816
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:11,291
Don't wanna get shot in your face
over a rumor, do you?

817
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,833
Why don't you go head home?

818
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:14,666
The Wand belongs to the people.

819
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,666
To the barrio.
- Get back!

820
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,791
Homeboy.

821
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,750
You heard me.
- Smooth.

822
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,666
It's mine...

823
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,166
if I have to kill every fucking cop in LA.

824
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,625
You're gonna get your chance,
'cause SWAT is about 90 seconds out.

825
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:33,083
Nick, get in the truck.

826
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:34,875
Get in the fucking truck, Nick!

827
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,291
Listen to your master. Get in the truck.
- Fuck you.

828
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:38,875
Fuck you, homie.
- Fuck you.

829
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:41,541
What is that,
a fuckin' Labradoodle you dipped in ink?

830
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,708
Messed with puerco, homie.
- Fucking ugly-ass motherfucker.

831
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:47,416
Looks like a puerco to me.

832
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,500
Get me that Wand.

833
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,791
Windows up, bulletproof.

834
00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:57,125
Is a SWAT team coming?
- No, Nick. Go. Go!

835
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,625
Wrong way, Nick.
- Yeah, well, someone was on the car.

836
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:13,500
Come back, you motherfucker!

837
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:16,541
Bulletproof, dickhead.

838
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,708
Go, go, go, go!

839
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,333
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Drive like you stole it.

840
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,125
Altamira gang, homie.
Let's get these motherfuckers.

841
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:52,125
Go! Go!

842
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:13,666
Drive straight, not sideways!

843
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:23,750
Shit, I'm out.

844
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,250
Shit.
- Butterfingers.

845
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,500
We were doing so good.

846
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,708
They don't teach that at the academy.

847
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,125
No, they do not.

848
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:20,416
We have to turn back.
Stop the car. Inferni!

849
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,333
Inferni! Inferni!
- Relax, relax.

850
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,791
The hell is she saying?
- She won't let it go!

851
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,708
-
- Oh, shit!

852
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,208
What's happening? Hey!

853
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:31,958
Hey, shut up! Shut up! What is that?

854
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:35,000
Shut up!

855
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:57,541
The fuck?
- Problem?

856
00:49:57,625 --> 00:50:00,708
Tech services is flagging
some weird-ass cell phone inter...

857
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,416
Talking about a Magic Wand.

858
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,875
Help me. Help.

859
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,375
Larika.

860
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:02,750
Oh...

861
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:07,125
Leilah. The traitor escaped.

862
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:14,333
She has your Wand.

863
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:36,708
I got blood in my eye.
What the fuck did we hit?

864
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:37,750
Oh, that was the Wand.

865
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:40,041
You know what a binding spell is?

866
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:43,166
It stops it from getting too far away
from its owner.

867
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Pulls it back.

868
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,875
Owner? Who owns a Wand?

869
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,791
A Bright.

870
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,666
Please, sir.

871
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:17,083
Tell me what happened.

872
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,375
Tell me.

873
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,833
Cops started shooting at each other,

874
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:27,875
and a black cop killed them all.

875
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,416
He left with an Orc cop and an Elf girl.

876
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,708
An Elf?

877
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:41,416
No! No!

878
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:02,416
Okay, you know what?
You need to sit your crazy ass down.

879
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:06,583
Look, half of our division is on some
old-school Rampart shit, a'ight?

880
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:09,791
They're gonna kill you first,
then they're gonna kill me,

881
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,000
they're gonna take the Wand,

882
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:13,250
and that's when the stupid shit's
gonna start.

883
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:17,250
And by the way, that's only
if the gangstas don't get it first.

884
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,541
And that's when the triple stupid shit's
gonna start.

885
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,375
We gotta get out of this neighborhood.

886
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:26,458
Yeah, but the Wand is gonna stop us.
The binding spell is gonna stop us.

887
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,458
We'll hide the Wand.

888
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,375
We'll hide it here
and come back and get it.

889
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:32,083
I am not abandoning the Wand.

890
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:36,416
We are not the fucking Wand police.
- You want bodies on the street? Huh?

891
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:37,791
All of LA on fire?

892
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:41,083
This is like a nuclear weapon
that grants wishes.

893
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:44,541
No. The feds have people

894
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:46,000
that deal with magic.

895
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:48,916
We call them. We ask...
- You wanna call the feds?

896
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,958
I got bodies on my gun, remember?

897
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,625
Yeah, well, don't look at me,
I just let an Orc go.

898
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:54,541
Really, Nick?

899
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,333
Really?

900
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:57,250
That was irony.

901
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,916
No, that's just being an asshole.
- Oh.

902
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:03,125
Gonna call Rodriguez.
He's a sheriff, he's not LAPD.

903
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:05,666
He's solid as fuck. We can trust him.
- That's a good idea.

904
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,125
Shh, shh.

905
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,708
They're coming for the Wand.
- Ah, shit.

906
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:14,250
What is it?
- The lock.

907
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:17,583
We left the lock outside on the ground.
Go.

908
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:26,166
Partner, look out!

909
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,208
Come on! Come on! Come on!

910
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,583
Let's go! Let's go!

911
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:53,500
Nick, let's go.

912
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,083
Come on, let's go!

913
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:56,291
What is your problem?

914
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,208
Wait! I dropped the Wand.

915
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,875
Don't you fucking touch that!

916
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,166
Where did they all go?

917
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,666
I think we're breathing 'em.

918
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:32,291
Hey, do me a favor.
- Uh-huh?

919
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,250
Don't drop that shit no more.

920
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,541
What? No.

921
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:38,083
Why would I?

922
00:56:49,416 --> 00:56:52,166
Ah, shit! Ah!

923
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,916
Ward...

924
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:00,791
I shot a human. Did you see?

925
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,333
Yeah, I'll get you some ice cream later.
Damn.

926
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:08,833
I'm hit.
- What?

927
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:13,708
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna keep coming. Let's go.

928
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,333
What are you doing here?

929
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,083
You fucking traitor.

930
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,500
Keep walking.

931
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,375
Tikka!

932
00:58:26,916 --> 00:58:28,000
Where's Tikka?

933
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,916
Tikka!

934
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,333
On my back! Get on my back!

935
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:52,833
Get those fucking cops.

936
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:54,375
Tikka!

937
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:01,333
Ward?

938
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:05,041
Ward!

939
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:07,833
You want some of this?

940
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:11,791
I found Tikka. Let's go!

941
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,708
Tikka! Get down!

942
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,291
Ward, this way!

943
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:34,416
Execute.
- Sir.

944
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:38,583
Move! Let's go! Move!
- Confirmed use of magic.

945
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:05,500
She's Inferni.

946
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:11,666
What a shitshow.

947
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:15,166
You want to, uh, unpack this for me, boss?

948
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,916
Leilah.

949
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:22,750
Leilah was here.

950
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,750
What are you talking about?

951
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,291
She was sent to kill Tikka,

952
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,208
then Tikka did that.
- She wants her Wand back, right?

953
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:34,750
Yes.
- And Tikka has it.

954
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:38,875
Yes.
- And those cops she ran off with, uh...

955
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:42,041
Ward and...

956
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,916
What? Jakoby.

957
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,875
The Orc cop we saw at the station.

958
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,083
They have no idea who Tikka is.

959
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,291
It's been 20 years.

960
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:51,958
What does that even mean?

961
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:53,833
Twenty years I've been hunting Leilah.

962
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:56,083
Without her Wand...

963
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,125
she's vulnerable.

964
01:01:08,375 --> 01:01:10,791
Now's a bad time to go shopping, Ward.

965
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,625
Everybody's looking for two cops.
We gotta switch it up.

966
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,416
Oh, yeah.

967
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:19,708
Running through a Fogteeth party
is not good community policing.

968
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:22,791
Yeah, well, we're alive,
and we got the Wand.

969
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:25,791
Orcs hold grudges. That's all I'm saying.

970
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,666
Tell me about it.
Hey, follow me. Let's go.

971
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,375
Tikka.

972
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:32,958
Oh, thank you, ma'am.
- Go.

973
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,916
That's good.
- Thank you.

974
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:14,875
Take your old lady,
get the fuck outta here. Go. Go.

975
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:21,000
I need you to get the fuck outta here.
All right? Go.

976
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:21,958
Jesus.

977
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:41,958
Whoo!

978
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:50,583
Seven dudes with choppers
down the right, five down the left.

979
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,000
Bunch of motherfuckers in the middle.

980
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,500
Officer Ward...

981
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,166
I think we need to talk.

982
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,833
Hey, Poison, how you doing?

983
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:06,041
Some fucked-up shit went down tonight.

984
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:09,541
My homies wanna cut your fucking head off,
the cops wanna cut your fucking head off,

985
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:11,833
the Fogteeth gang
wanna cut your fucking head off.

986
01:03:11,916 --> 01:03:14,041
Yeah, I got that effect on people, Poison.

987
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:15,750
Imagine how my old lady feels.

988
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:18,000
Me? I just wanna protect you.

989
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,583
Mmm.

990
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:24,083
Get you home safe and sound,
with all your sins forgiven.

991
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,750
But you gotta give me that Wand.

992
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,541
You wanna do the right thing?

993
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:30,083
Help me walk again.

994
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,500
Help me make love to my old lady again.

995
01:03:32,583 --> 01:03:34,333
Help me get rid of this shit again.

996
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:40,750
Give me the fucking Wand, or I will nail
every door in this place shut

997
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,083
and burn this place down
to the fucking ground.

998
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:47,958
And then I will pick up the Wand
from the ashes, and I will laugh.

999
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:52,291
Chopping it up with the homie for a sec,
Poison.

1000
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:55,250
I'm running out of patience, Officer Ward.

1001
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:07,291
Let's give this motherfucker the Wand.
- What?

1002
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:10,166
Look, we gonna get
everybody in here killed,

1003
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,208
and then he's gonna
take the damn Wand anyway.

1004
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:14,250
I'm not giving that guy the Wand.

1005
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,458
Over my dead body.

1006
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:18,833
He's gonna have to kill me first.

1007
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:21,000
So you wanna die in a gunfight

1008
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,500
in a nasty-ass titty bar?

1009
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:25,083
That's what you want?

1010
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:27,291
I don't wanna die anywhere.

1011
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:31,541
You know what? Now I do. Fuck it.
I wanna die. Let's do it right now.

1012
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:33,083
We gonna titty-bar-gunfight die.

1013
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:34,958
Let's do it right here, right now. Ready?

1014
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,875
I just wish your dumb ass
was a better shot.

1015
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,875
What she say?
- She says the devil is coming.

1016
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,041
The devil's ass is out there
in that wheelchair.

1017
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:47,125
Let's go. On three. One...
- Let's do it.

1018
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:48,750
...two... three.
- Yeah.

1019
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:11,500
Oh, shit.

1020
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:13,541
Go, go, go!

1021
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,083
Go! Go, go, go!

1022
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:22,416
Move!

1023
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:32,250
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

1024
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,166
Hurry!

1025
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:38,541
LAPD!

1026
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:42,333
Oh, fuck. Come on!
- Who is she?

1027
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,083
Inferni! She wants her Wand.

1028
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:49,500
Move!

1029
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,791
I'm not a cop after tonight, am I?

1030
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,416
No. Neither am I.

1031
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:28,750
I think we should probably spend our time

1032
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:32,333
just trying to survive this shit.
- Survive?

1033
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,833
Being a cop is all I've got.

1034
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:39,750
Right now I'm still a cop,
and if I die tonight,

1035
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:41,791
I'll be a cop forever. I'll be a...

1036
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:43,375
I'll be a hero forever.

1037
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,250
Why the fuck do you wanna die for a world
that doesn't give a shit about you?

1038
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:52,458
Orcs chose the wrong side a long time ago

1039
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,416
and they've been paying for it ever since.

1040
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,375
You know, when an Orc sees me...

1041
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:02,083
they see a man... a wannabee human.

1042
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:04,791
When humans see me, they see an animal.

1043
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:06,125
They hate me.

1044
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,416
They don't hate you.

1045
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,458
We know when people like us
and when they don't.

1046
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:12,791
Like you, Ward.

1047
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:17,708
When you came out of that house
with pure hatred in your eyes.

1048
01:07:18,666 --> 01:07:21,250
Pure... hatred.

1049
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,583
Look, I told you what that was, all right?

1050
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:34,125
Why didn't you tell me the truth
about helping the Orc kid?

1051
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:37,916
I'm not saying it would've changed...

1052
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:41,208
anything, but, shit, it might have.

1053
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,500
I got confused.

1054
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:48,916
And with humans, you understand,
everything is so definite.

1055
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,375
Like, you say something,
and all of a sudden it's law,

1056
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,125
and you can't walk it back.

1057
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:55,458
You gotta tell me...

1058
01:07:56,291 --> 01:07:58,083
if I'm supposed to be your partner.

1059
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,500
I don't care what we'll say to them,
but you gotta tell me the truth.

1060
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:03,250
You can't lie to me.

1061
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:06,791
Oh, so I'm supposed to trust you
when you don't trust me?

1062
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:10,666
That's a good point.

1063
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,666
You're a good cop.

1064
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,208
And people are really hard on you, so...

1065
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:26,416
you're really hard on yourself.

1066
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:39,916
Come on, crazy.

1067
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:44,041
Ward, do you know that you are
who I wish I was?

1068
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:45,708
You're fearless.

1069
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,375
You always know what to do.

1070
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,375
What you did tonight,

1071
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,875
that's what it takes for an Orc
to get blooded.

1072
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,416
An act of great bravery.

1073
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:00,375
To me, you're like a blooded human.

1074
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:03,666
I used to be like you.

1075
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:08,083
Think you can save everybody
and fix everything and...

1076
01:09:11,166 --> 01:09:13,416
Now I just pretend to be a good dude.

1077
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:18,916
You still are one.

1078
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,708
Are we friends?

1079
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:26,875
Nah, Nick. We're not friends, man.

1080
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,791
You don't want me as a friend.

1081
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,208
Show me your fucking hands, Ward.

1082
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:04,958
Whoa, Rodriguez, what are you doing?

1083
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:06,750
Show me your fucking hands.

1084
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:09,125
Hey! I called you.
- Show me your fucking hands.

1085
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:11,291
Are you a part of this?
- Part of what?

1086
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:14,500
All I know is I heard chatter on the radio
saying you killed a bunch of cops.

1087
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:17,125
Put your gun down. Listen, the guys...
- Shut the fuck up.

1088
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:19,041
Hey!
- Yo! Drop the weapon.

1089
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:22,250
Tikka, stop. All right. Relax.
- Drop the fucking weapon!

1090
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,500
Drop it now!

1091
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:26,291
Rodriguez. Listen to me.
- Get away from the gun!

1092
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:27,208
Listen!

1093
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:32,083
The guys on our watch tried to do us
over a Wand.

1094
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:33,750
We have a Wand.

1095
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,458
We have a Magic Wand.

1096
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,416
All right, show me the Wand.
- Don't show him shit.

1097
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,041
He's gonna shoot us and take it.
- Slow.

1098
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,916
Jakoby!

1099
01:10:58,625 --> 01:10:59,791
Shit.

1100
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:06,125
Okay, first thing we gotta do
is keep that away from the bad guys.

1101
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,833
I'm gonna make a phone call. Put it down.
- All right.

1102
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:11,083
Put it down. Now step back!
- Rodriguez...

1103
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,833
Step the... God damn it!
What the fuck? Is that an Elf?

1104
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:16,000
Rodriguez, put the phone down.
- Step the fuck back!

1105
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:18,250
Put your phone down.
- I'm calling the feds.

1106
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:20,416
It's what we're supposed to do.
- Listen to me.

1107
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,583
Chill. Chill. Chill.
- Listen. We don't know who's dirty.

1108
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:25,708
Rodriguez, put the phone down.
- Shut the fuck up.

1109
01:11:25,791 --> 01:11:26,916
Put the phone do...
- Hold on!

1110
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,083
Don't tell 'em shit.

1111
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:31,791
I got a deputy claiming to have the Wand.

1112
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,208
Yes?

1113
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,833
They wanna know where we're at.

1114
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,583
Give me the phone.

1115
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,458
Give me the phone.

1116
01:11:42,291 --> 01:11:43,291
Who is this?

1117
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:44,875
Who's this?

1118
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:46,958
The motherfucker with the Wand.

1119
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:53,166
You called us. Where are you?

1120
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:55,458
All right, look...

1121
01:11:57,166 --> 01:11:59,625
I got the Wand, but I need something.

1122
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:03,458
You need forgiveness.
- If I give you this Wand.

1123
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:05,333
And let's just say...

1124
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:10,416
I don't know, somebody accused me of,
uh, some dumb shit, like...

1125
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:12,291
killing a bunch of cops.

1126
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:14,791
A man like you could fix that shit, right?

1127
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:20,041
If you were protecting a weapon of magic
from, let's say, corrupt individuals...

1128
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,041
there would be no charges.

1129
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:23,833
That's exactly what happened.

1130
01:12:24,041 --> 01:12:24,958
Hypothetically.

1131
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,166
A man like you could dead that noise,
right?

1132
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:30,250
Do you have the Elf girl?
- Yeah.

1133
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:33,750
Yo.

1134
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,916
Can only narrow it down to a few blocks.
- Okay.

1135
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,250
Come on, let's go! Move out! Move out!

1136
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:51,041
The phone died.
- Shit.

1137
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:56,041
All right, look...
- Okay. No, hold the... Hold the fuck up.

1138
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,875
Hey, Rodriguez...
- Have to cuff your partner.

1139
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,666
Nobody's handcuffing anybody.
- It doesn't look good.

1140
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,625
A fucking Orc and a bunch of dead cops?

1141
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:04,708
All right.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1142
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:06,500
I'm just being real with you, man.

1143
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,083
They want it to be Jakoby.

1144
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:09,625
Okay? Whether it's him or not.

1145
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,666
If he's not cuffed
by the time they get here,

1146
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,375
they're gonna smoke
both of you motherfuckers.

1147
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:14,583
Cuff your partner.
- Don't...

1148
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:16,916
Ward, it's okay.
- Don't reach on me like that.

1149
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,458
We can't run all night.

1150
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,541
Let's do it.

1151
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,125
It's time to end this.

1152
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,291
Let's go in.

1153
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:31,750
Take my gun.

1154
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:35,250
Turn around.

1155
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:37,500
Hey, Ward...

1156
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:39,458
I can't go to prison.

1157
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,541
They'll skin me alive.

1158
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:44,291
You're not going to jail.
You didn't do shit.

1159
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:45,750
I shot everybody.

1160
01:13:45,958 --> 01:13:48,291
Ward, shut the fuck up and lawyer up.

1161
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,375
Aah!

1162
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:52,541
Get inside! Get inside! Go!

1163
01:13:57,625 --> 01:14:00,083
Shit. What was that?

1164
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,208
Good girl. Let me out. Let me out.
You see anything?

1165
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:07,208
No, I can't see anything.
- Sir, get away from that window!

1166
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:12,083
Oh, shit! Move! Come on!

1167
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:07,250
Traitor.

1168
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:37,625
Oh, shit, shit.

1169
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,708
Get me out. Get me out.

1170
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,958
Get me out!

1171
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,041
Oh, God.

1172
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,750
Oh, shit.

1173
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,291
I told you Orcs hold grudges.
Huh? What'd I say?

1174
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:44,208
All right, look. I'm gonna cut you a break
on the reckless driving.

1175
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:47,875
But I need you to return to your vehicles
and drive home safely.

1176
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:52,000
So I need you to take your fat
Shrek-looking ass

1177
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:56,250
back to your vehicle
and drive the fuck home to Fiona. A'ight?

1178
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:58,333
Do you wanna go to jail?
- Fiona?

1179
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,958
Tell these dickheads in Orkish

1180
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:04,583
to get the fuck back in their vehicles
and drive home,

1181
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:08,208
or they're all going to jail.
- But... they speak English.

1182
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:11,833
But... You understand, right?
Speak English?

1183
01:17:11,916 --> 01:17:13,541
Yeah. Of course.

1184
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,750
Take 'em to the church!

1185
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:42,625
You know...

1186
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:45,416
I'm not from here.

1187
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,958
I grew up in Miami.

1188
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:52,583
Great Orc communities there,
strong Orc communities.

1189
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:55,750
We'd have block parties
with dwarves and humans.

1190
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:58,416
It was fucking fun, man.

1191
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:02,375
I wasn't in the game then.

1192
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:04,958
I was a bus driver.

1193
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,583
Then I moved to LA.

1194
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,875
Fucking City of Angels, right?

1195
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:13,291
Listen, I would really appreciate it

1196
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:16,000
if you gave me the respect
of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

1197
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:20,083
I get here and I see
how broke the system is.

1198
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,416
Orcs caught between the police
and the gangsters.

1199
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,625
Elves making money off us.

1200
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:29,083
So I organize...
- Tikka.

1201
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:30,583
...my community.

1202
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:33,500
We got our own thing now.

1203
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:36,041
Every month...

1204
01:18:37,666 --> 01:18:40,791
Look at me, motherfucker.
- Sorry.

1205
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Every month...

1206
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:46,208
I throw a big party.

1207
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:49,291
Get everyone drunk, feed 'em.

1208
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:51,666
All races...

1209
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:54,541
partying together, with one rule.

1210
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:57,250
No guns.

1211
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:00,833
After years of peace...

1212
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:04,208
who brings in the guns?

1213
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,083
We did, yeah.

1214
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:09,500
The drama?
- Us.

1215
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:14,083
Disrespects our celebration?

1216
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:17,000
The motherfucking police!

1217
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:21,416
An unblooded Orc.

1218
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:26,458
Grew up with humans. Never had a hand
raised for him in respect.

1219
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:28,791
What's he saying?

1220
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:32,416
Playing the nice guy.
- Nothing I haven't heard before.

1221
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:36,125
Your buddy's so happy to say
he's got a Orc friend.

1222
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:41,375
Shit. I'm stuck with this motherfucker.

1223
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:42,791
Seriously?
- I'm just saying,

1224
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:45,500
ain't like we's stomping
through the club together.

1225
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:46,541
Ward.

1226
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:52,416
Where is the Wand?

1227
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:54,541
What Wand?

1228
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,583
Hey, man, we're family.
- Hey, Nick.

1229
01:19:57,916 --> 01:20:00,500
He's just trying to get in your head.
Don't let him in your head.

1230
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:03,541
I'm not trying to get in his head, man.
I'm in his soul.

1231
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:06,458
We're the same thing.

1232
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:09,875
I'll tell you where the Wand is.
- Yeah?

1233
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:13,666
It's up your fucking ass.

1234
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:22,666
Where's the Wand?

1235
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,333
Whip these motherfuckers.

1236
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:49,416
Get them!

1237
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:51,625
Don't hurt 'em.

1238
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:53,208
Pussy.

1239
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,166
Roundtooth.

1240
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,416
False Orc.

1241
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:02,625
Unblooded coward.

1242
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:07,666
Where is the Wand?

1243
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,833
What... What Wand?

1244
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:16,083
You motherfucking dickhead!

1245
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:20,583
Where is the Wand?

1246
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:24,791
What Wa... Wand?

1247
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,625
There's no Wand!

1248
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Altamira thinks there's a Wand.

1249
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:40,375
The police think there's a Wand.

1250
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:43,875
The feds think there's a Wand.

1251
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:48,291
I think there's a Wand!

1252
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:52,500
There's no Wand.

1253
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:54,458
Ghetto Fairy tales.

1254
01:21:58,750 --> 01:21:59,791
Bring me the Elf.

1255
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:08,875
I will cover you with her hot blood.

1256
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,791
She don't have shit to do with this.

1257
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:13,958
Where is the Wand?

1258
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:16,250
We are police off...

1259
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:17,750
officers.

1260
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:20,583
And you can't do this to us.

1261
01:22:34,791 --> 01:22:35,958
Kill them!

1262
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:47,416
Watch your friends die, Elf.

1263
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,916
You didn't break.

1264
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,750
You deserve to be blooded.

1265
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:06,791
You would have made a great Orc.

1266
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:12,541
I am... a great Orc.

1267
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,250
My son earns his colors tonight.

1268
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:27,208
Mikey.

1269
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:48,791
Bye, partner.

1270
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:57,125
Why are you waiting?

1271
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,958
Father... I know him.

1272
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:09,875
Ward...

1273
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,916
He helped me escape from the police.

1274
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,500
That's the guy...

1275
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:17,666
that I let go.

1276
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:22,416
He saved my life. I cannot kill him.

1277
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:30,291
Go home.

1278
01:24:33,666 --> 01:24:34,791
You can't be here.

1279
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:18,833
Fuck you, you green pig-nose
piece of shit.

1280
01:25:18,916 --> 01:25:19,833
Shoot, bitch.

1281
01:25:19,916 --> 01:25:22,166
Beg for it! Beg!
- Shoot me, bitch. Shoot, bitch!

1282
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,416
Fuck you.

1283
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,875
Show your respect!
- Fuck you! Do it! Shoot!

1284
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:29,041
Shoot, motherfucker! Bring it!
- Give us respect! Here it comes!

1285
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:28,583
This is a Prophecy, for he has risen.

1286
01:26:57,083 --> 01:26:59,583
Hey, hey.

1287
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:07,208
W-Ward?
What happened?

1288
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:09,708
Uh... Nothing. Why?

1289
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:12,791
Well, something happened. I feel great.

1290
01:27:13,166 --> 01:27:14,208
Uh...

1291
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:17,583
Nah, just go, go, go.
- Okay.

1292
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:32,958
You're a Bright?

1293
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:34,916
You're a fucking Bright?

1294
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:38,791
Would've been nice to know that
when we was getting fucked up.

1295
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:41,916
Could've had a magic helicopter
take us somewhere.

1296
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,125
I only started my training.

1297
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:46,291
I only know a few spell words.

1298
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:49,750
She speaks English pretty good now, too.

1299
01:27:49,916 --> 01:27:52,291
Now I trust you.
- Um...

1300
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:55,666
You gonna need to unfuck this, okay?

1301
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:59,083
A'ight? You gonna magic us to Palm Springs
or some shit.

1302
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:01,083
I saved your friend's life.

1303
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:03,625
Isn't that enough?

1304
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,333
It's a start, but...

1305
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:10,291
Uh, Ward, stop.
I happen to think it's a pretty big deal.

1306
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:12,250
Thank you.

1307
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:17,250
Now, Tikka, who are these Elves
who are hunting us?

1308
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:20,541
They're aiding the return
of the Dark Lord...

1309
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:24,125
so he can slaughter billions

1310
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:27,958
and enslave the survivors
to serve him in a new age of magic.

1311
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:29,875
Oh. That's all.

1312
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,333
Just some Illuminati shit.

1313
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:33,583
They're Inferni.

1314
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,833
They destroyed the Illuminati
a hundred years ago.

1315
01:28:36,916 --> 01:28:38,208
How do you know all this?

1316
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:40,583
I, too, am Inferni.

1317
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:45,125
But I escaped.

1318
01:28:46,916 --> 01:28:49,000
The Shield of Light hid me.

1319
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,041
Leilah gave an assassin her Wand
to kill me.

1320
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:02,333
But I got the Wand from her.

1321
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,541
Keep it away from Leilah.

1322
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:11,708
She mustn't get her Wand back.

1323
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:15,000
With it,
she can restore the Dark Lord to power.

1324
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,500
Hey, what is that? What's the shit?
What's the black stuff?

1325
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:20,916
Hey. Look... All right.

1326
01:29:21,791 --> 01:29:25,000
All right, hey, look,
don't-don't-don't check out on us.

1327
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:29,791
Keep it away from her.
Keep the Wand away from Leilah.

1328
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:31,583
Promise me.
- Yes.

1329
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,666
All right. She needs medical attention.
We gotta get her to an emergency room.

1330
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,833
But how?

1331
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:40,750
Got it. Let's go!

1332
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:42,333
Go, go!

1333
01:29:45,416 --> 01:29:46,666
We won't let you die.

1334
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:48,666
How do we save you?

1335
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:52,458
Only the Shield of Light can help me.

1336
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:54,375
Where are they?

1337
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:56,083
Home.

1338
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:59,125
Home.
- Home? Where's home?

1339
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:02,416
Wait, home.
Uh... the Abrams' house?

1340
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:04,708
Everybody was dead there.

1341
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:07,375
There's a pool.

1342
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:13,666
The pools are... connected like...

1343
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:17,708
the roots of a holy tree.

1344
01:30:19,916 --> 01:30:22,750
Ward, she's dying. We have to take her
back to where we found her.

1345
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:24,916
No. We are not going back to that house.
- Yes.

1346
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,666
We're gonna get to the hospital.
There's doctors there.

1347
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:30,291
We're gonna turn her and the Wand
over to the feds.

1348
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,000
Ward. Ward.
- I want my life back.

1349
01:30:32,083 --> 01:30:35,833
She brought me back from the dead.

1350
01:30:35,916 --> 01:30:38,416
Hey, don't kook out on me right now,
all right?

1351
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,583
We don't know exactly what happened.

1352
01:30:40,666 --> 01:30:42,291
You have to accept the miracle.

1353
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:46,625
We're not going back to that house.
- You and me are simple people.

1354
01:30:47,083 --> 01:30:48,333
We mean nothing.

1355
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,333
People don't write about us.

1356
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:53,583
But this, don't you see,
is like a time of heroes?

1357
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:57,666
Jirak was unblooded like me.

1358
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,166
An Orc that nobody cared about.

1359
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:01,708
He...

1360
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:07,375
He united the Nine Armies,
and they defeated the Dark Lord. He...

1361
01:31:07,541 --> 01:31:11,125
He was a farmer who changed the world.

1362
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:14,791
They raised their blades to him.

1363
01:31:14,916 --> 01:31:17,833
He was blooded in that very moment.

1364
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:21,083
He fulfilled a great Prophecy, Ward.

1365
01:31:22,875 --> 01:31:24,791
I think we might be in a Prophecy.

1366
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:28,625
We're not in a Prophecy, all right?
- How do you know?

1367
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,416
We're in a stolen Toyota Corolla.

1368
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:34,250
No.
- Okay? Look at my face.

1369
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:37,875
All right? This is not a Prophecy face.

1370
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:40,458
This is a bad-night face.

1371
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:43,250
Okay? And we're gonna get to the hospital,

1372
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:44,958
and the feds are gonna put an end to it.

1373
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:48,208
Shut the fuck up, Ward, and listen to me.

1374
01:31:48,291 --> 01:31:49,750
We have to go back.

1375
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:51,625
There's nothing ahead of us.

1376
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:11,083
Ah, man. These guys are feds.

1377
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,541
Oh, shit.

1378
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:44,625
I get the big gun.

1379
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:49,083
Ah.

1380
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:51,708
I didn't mind having the big gun.

1381
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:15,083
That... That's a bomb.

1382
01:33:15,166 --> 01:33:16,000
Yes, it is.

1383
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:19,291
You want me to hold it?
- Yes, I do.

1384
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:21,083
W... Why?

1385
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:22,708
You never know.

1386
01:33:30,208 --> 01:33:34,416
I sit before you, Lord of Darkness.

1387
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,541
Serving your will is my honor.

1388
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,708
I will return you to this world.

1389
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:46,250
They're coming!
There! In the wall!

1390
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:47,458
Shoot through the wall!

1391
01:33:51,291 --> 01:33:52,875
Ward!

1392
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:11,250
Nick!

1393
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,458
Nick! Let's go!

1394
01:34:19,666 --> 01:34:20,916
Jakoby!

1395
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,500
I gave her the bomb.

1396
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:37,166
You never know.

1397
01:34:37,708 --> 01:34:38,625
Swipe left.

1398
01:34:58,458 --> 01:34:59,541
Oh, shit.

1399
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,958
Shoot her!

1400
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:49,750
Shoot her!

1401
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:51,750
Nick, will you please shoot her!

1402
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:53,208
Shoot! Shoot her!

1403
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:13,083
Good work.

1404
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:35,750
The water. Put me in the water.

1405
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:39,375
Hey. You're done. I got it from here.

1406
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:22,875
So what now?

1407
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:26,125
Have faith.

1408
01:37:39,708 --> 01:37:41,083
She's coming.

1409
01:37:45,041 --> 01:37:45,875
Nick!

1410
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:43,041
The hell are you?

1411
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:44,958
I'm a warrior.

1412
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,458
A priestess, a lover.

1413
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:51,166
I am whatever my Lord needs me to be.

1414
01:38:58,458 --> 01:39:00,083
Come home.

1415
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:04,041
Please, come home.

1416
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:07,416
I can't go back.

1417
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:11,250
Dream with me again.

1418
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:16,125
What you love is broken, rotten.

1419
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:23,208
This man and the Orc...

1420
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:26,333
...what are they to you?

1421
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:30,666
They're good.
- No.

1422
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:43,125
It's time to come home.

1423
01:39:44,750 --> 01:39:46,583
It's time to come home.

1424
01:39:46,875 --> 01:39:50,916
It's too late. I can't come home.
- It's time to wake up.

1425
01:39:58,333 --> 01:40:01,500
So just shut up and kill me.

1426
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:03,500
Just shut up and kill me!

1427
01:40:03,583 --> 01:40:06,000
This is not you!
- Shut up and kill me!

1428
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,916
This is not you! This is you!

1429
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:12,375
What have you done to my sister?

1430
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:16,291
What have you done to her?
What did you do?

1431
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,375
Shit.

1432
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:31,541
Nick, if you were aiming at the Wand,
that was a really good shot.

1433
01:40:31,625 --> 01:40:33,458
But shoot her in her head!

1434
01:40:34,666 --> 01:40:35,541
Like this?

1435
01:40:39,083 --> 01:40:40,083
I can't.

1436
01:40:40,583 --> 01:40:42,416
I'm out.

1437
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:49,750
No!

1438
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:51,791
You're not a Bright.

1439
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:54,916
You touch my Wand...

1440
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:58,958
and it will splatter you
all over the walls.

1441
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:01,791
I think that's kind of the plan.

1442
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,333
Think I'mma just kill us all.

1443
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:12,541
Ward...

1444
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:14,583
I wouldn't do that.

1445
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:16,166
It's all right.

1446
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,041
We're in a Prophecy, right?

1447
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,125
Oh... Oh!

1448
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:32,875
This is impossible.

1449
01:41:36,166 --> 01:41:38,916
Hey, Nick, I got the Wand.

1450
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:40,375
Um, what now?

1451
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:44,000
Maybe you're a... You're a Bright, Ward.

1452
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:47,208
Use it!

1453
01:41:47,583 --> 01:41:48,833
Oh, good idea.

1454
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:51,083
Give it to me...

1455
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,000
or she dies.

1456
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,375
Vykwarus.

1457
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:01,083
The war word is Vykwarus.

1458
01:42:01,333 --> 01:42:03,750
Vykwarus!

1459
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:13,208
We got a Bright in there!

1460
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:20,125
Aah!

1461
01:42:24,041 --> 01:42:25,583
Tikka. Tikka.

1462
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:30,666
Tikka!
- Ward! It's okay.

1463
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:32,666
She just... She rolled in.
- Come on, Ward!

1464
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:35,041
She's gone. It's okay.
- I didn't hurt her.

1465
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:37,916
Tikka!
- Ward, Tikka's okay.

1466
01:42:38,166 --> 01:42:39,166
She's gone.

1467
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:41,250
Tikka!
- Ward, think of Sophia.

1468
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:42,333
Come on, Ward!

1469
01:42:58,791 --> 01:42:59,708
Orc!

1470
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:01,875
Stand down.

1471
01:43:02,416 --> 01:43:03,541
Stand down.

1472
01:43:03,625 --> 01:43:04,750
Ward!

1473
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:08,208
Ward!

1474
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:11,083
No!

1475
01:43:11,166 --> 01:43:12,000
Daryl!

1476
01:43:13,083 --> 01:43:14,208
You're safe now.

1477
01:43:14,791 --> 01:43:17,125
Ward!

1478
01:43:22,833 --> 01:43:24,041
Daryl!

1479
01:43:28,583 --> 01:43:30,333
Ward!

1480
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:32,500
Ward!

1481
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:55,833
I know. I gotcha.

1482
01:44:06,291 --> 01:44:07,375
Got him!

1483
01:44:07,583 --> 01:44:10,000
Ward! We made it!

1484
01:44:10,416 --> 01:44:11,583
We got out!

1485
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,666
I got you. You're okay.

1486
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,333
Are you okay?

1487
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:18,375
Breathe, Ward.

1488
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:20,875
Say something.

1489
01:44:24,916 --> 01:44:27,916
Nick... look.

1490
01:44:29,958 --> 01:44:30,875
Oh.

1491
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:15,166
Still not my friend.

1492
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:22,541
I never really liked you anyway.

1493
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:26,916
Think you're a big dog
now you're blooded, huh?

1494
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,291
Yeah, pretty big.

1495
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:32,708
Hey, Nick.

1496
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:34,583
Yeah.

1497
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:36,916
Fuck magic.

1498
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:42,041
Well, I don't know.
I still think it's kinda cool.

1499
01:45:45,958 --> 01:45:47,333
How you doing, fellas?

1500
01:45:47,833 --> 01:45:49,791
Good?
- Hey.

1501
01:45:50,833 --> 01:45:53,416
Nick, the firemen are here.

1502
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,166
We should've been firemen.
- Yeah.

1503
01:45:56,708 --> 01:45:59,416
Hey, can I get a aspirin?

1504
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:27,250
Hey, Clan Blood.

1505
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:28,791
Daryl.

1506
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:31,083
Oh, Daryl.

1507
01:46:31,666 --> 01:46:32,875
How are you feeling?

1508
01:46:33,875 --> 01:46:35,166
You feeling okay?

1509
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:39,375
Uh, yeah.

1510
01:46:39,458 --> 01:46:41,166
Okay, I get it.

1511
01:46:44,666 --> 01:46:45,833
Oh, shit.

1512
01:46:46,041 --> 01:46:47,541
Well, that can't be good.

1513
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:48,583
Yeah.

1514
01:46:49,416 --> 01:46:50,833
Why you not locked up?

1515
01:46:51,625 --> 01:46:54,750
I think they think
you're more dangerous than me.

1516
01:46:57,125 --> 01:46:57,958
Hey.

1517
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:02,541
Don't say shit.

1518
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:19,625
Sir, we were just responding to a call.
- Mmm.

1519
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:23,125
My partner and I, we...
But there was all this crazy magic stuff.

1520
01:47:23,208 --> 01:47:25,208
I mean, everything that happened
with Brown...

1521
01:47:25,291 --> 01:47:27,583
Hey, hey, hey.
- ...and Hicks and Pollard and Ching...

1522
01:47:27,666 --> 01:47:30,166
They wanted Officer Ward to shoot me.
- Hey. Nick.

1523
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:34,125
They wanted to him to kill me
so they could get the Wand, remember?

1524
01:47:34,208 --> 01:47:36,458
And he wouldn't do it
'cause he's a stand-up guy.

1525
01:47:36,541 --> 01:47:39,291
He wouldn't do it. But then they said
they would kill me, so he...

1526
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:40,875
he had to take action,

1527
01:47:40,958 --> 01:47:43,583
like, with his gun, right?
- No. That's not my recollection.

1528
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:45,458
Hey, Nick, why don't you just...

1529
01:47:45,541 --> 01:47:46,583
If you hold up a second...

1530
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:49,125
What?
- ...they'll ask us questions.

1531
01:47:49,208 --> 01:47:51,875
It's what happened, I swear to God.
We just returned to the call.

1532
01:47:51,958 --> 01:47:55,666
But there are forces at play
that are beyond.

1533
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:57,625
There was, uh, an Elf woman.
- Hey, Nick.

1534
01:47:57,708 --> 01:47:59,250
She owned the Wand. Right?

1535
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:02,625
It must've been hers. Not a nice lady.
Dressed very well, but... Like you.

1536
01:48:02,708 --> 01:48:05,041
But she was a terrible woman. She...

1537
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:07,500
Uh, she served the Dark Lord.
- Nick...

1538
01:48:07,583 --> 01:48:08,666
I know it.
- Let them...

1539
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:11,083
Let them ask us questions.
- They need to know this.

1540
01:48:11,166 --> 01:48:13,458
Let him ask us questions.
- There was an Angel.

1541
01:48:13,541 --> 01:48:16,291
All right. That was then
when the gangsters were chasing us.

1542
01:48:16,375 --> 01:48:19,416
Uh, the context is a little off.
- Tikka.

1543
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,458
Oh, Tikka.

1544
01:48:21,541 --> 01:48:24,375
So sad. Tikka...
Tikka was a young Bright.

1545
01:48:24,458 --> 01:48:25,833
She... She... She...

1546
01:48:26,208 --> 01:48:29,583
She... She used the Wand
and she saved my life.

1547
01:48:29,708 --> 01:48:34,833
I was... My soul was leaving my body,
and she brought me back.

1548
01:48:37,083 --> 01:48:37,916
Officer Ward?

1549
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:40,708
We responded to a 415 disturbance call.

1550
01:48:41,208 --> 01:48:45,541
Uh, upon approaching the residence,
we realized that it was a safe house

1551
01:48:45,625 --> 01:48:48,833
for an extremist group.
- Full of weird...

1552
01:48:48,916 --> 01:48:50,833
We immediately took fire,

1553
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:53,791
uh, at which point we called for backup.

1554
01:48:54,208 --> 01:48:56,750
And... unfortunately...

1555
01:48:57,291 --> 01:49:01,750
officers were killed in the exchange.
- I've never seen shooting like it.

1556
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:03,791
He turned around, sight unseen,

1557
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:06,916
four of them, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Dropped...

1558
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:09,375
like it was one bullet.

1559
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:10,833
Sorry, keep going.

1560
01:49:12,208 --> 01:49:14,458
Gangsters showed up,

1561
01:49:14,541 --> 01:49:17,750
and it just went really sideways
from that point.

1562
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:19,875
And had you guys not shown up...

1563
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,708
it would've... it would've been really bad.

1564
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:26,875
Uh, so the real heroes in this
are you guys.

1565
01:49:27,416 --> 01:49:29,041
So we wanna say thank you.

1566
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:32,791
Nick, thank the nice federal agents.

1567
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:35,541
Thank you.

1568
01:49:36,041 --> 01:49:40,041
So, let me say, unequivocally...

1569
01:49:40,958 --> 01:49:45,000
there was no Wand.

1570
01:49:46,375 --> 01:49:49,125
And there was no magic.

1571
01:49:49,208 --> 01:49:51,333
Just a couple of street cops...

1572
01:49:52,416 --> 01:49:53,833
doing our job.

1573
01:49:55,583 --> 01:49:57,583
Oh, I know what this is.

1574
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:00,416
Then that's what happened?

1575
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,166
Yes, sir. That's exactly what happened.

1576
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:04,666
Yes?

1577
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,291
No, I'm with him.

1578
01:50:07,916 --> 01:50:10,125
Unequivocally.

1579
01:50:10,458 --> 01:50:14,625
Faced with armed terrorists obsessed
with myths from thousands of years ago,

1580
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:17,166
two of our officers held the line.

1581
01:50:17,791 --> 01:50:21,000
I hate seeing those scumbags
up there with Rodriguez.

1582
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:23,041
Let it go, Ward.

1583
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,291
We know, okay? That's enough.

1584
01:50:27,375 --> 01:50:32,250
Officer Daryl Ward, and our nation's first
Orkish police officer, Nicholas Jakoby.

1585
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:35,166
Officer Jakoby.

1586
01:50:46,416 --> 01:50:47,541
Congratulations, Ward.
