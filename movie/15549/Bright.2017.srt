00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,280
- 什麼東西？
- 怎麼了？　
- What's that shit in there? - What?

38
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,650
　　　
我的天
- Whoops. - Yeah

39

咖啡濾紙用光了 我只好用餐巾
Ran out of coffee filters, had to use a napkin.

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,190
拜託

你說過已經殺掉了

44
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,900
好吧 我跟你說實話
All right, I'm gonna be honest with you. All right?

45
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,580
- 請說　　　
- 我不惹妖精
- Please. - I don't fuck with no Fairies.

46
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,030
你要去惹惹外面的那只妖精
You need to fuck with that one.

47
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,940
小時候 我表哥戴戴 拿石頭扔妖精
When I was little, my cousin DayDay was throwing rocks at this Fairy.

48
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,320
　　　　　　　　　　　　
那妖精把屎拉在自己手掌
- The Fairy shit in his own hand... - Uh-huh.

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,280
然後把屎扔到戴戴的眼睛堨h了
...threw the shit, and it went in DayDay's eye,

50
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,030
他的眼睛腫得跟哈蜜瓜一樣大
and it was like a fucking cantaloupe.

51
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,150
- 你在胡扯　
- 他差點瞎了
- Bullshit story. - No, he almost lost his eye.

52
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,320
- 是真的
- 才怪　
- I'm telling you. Listen... - That's not true.

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,070
讓趕走蜜蜂那個人來處理好了 兩百塊搞定
$200. Pay the man. Same man that does the bees.

54
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,610
我才不要花兩百塊
No, I'm not paying $200.

55
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,780
我眼前就有個高大猛男
I got this big, handsome, strapping man standing right in front of me.

56
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,690
去殺掉那只妖精 多謝您了
Go kill that Fairy, please. Thank you so much.

57
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,540
我去殺吧 先讓我喝完咖啡
I'll kill the Fairy. Let me finish my coffee.

58
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,250
- 好吧
- 好　
- I'mma kill the Fairy. All right? - Okay.

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,280
喝完可能會死 你還是弄完再喝好了
That may kill you. You should do it before you finish the coffee.

60
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,360
　　　　　
工作怎樣？
- How was work? - Eh, work. Work is good,you know?

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,480
還好 挺好的 你聽說了麼 最近很多人挨刀子
Just, a lot of stab wounds lately. There's, uh...

62
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,820
今天 有個流浪漢進來 到處亂扔東西
We had this homeless guy come in, throwing equipment everywhere.

63
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,980
搞得一團糟
It was wild.

64
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,610
很多交通意外
A lot of traffic accidents,

65
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,960
- 有個老頭死掉了　　　
- 不是有個獸人警察嗎？
- and this older guy, he coded out on me. - What about that cop that's an Orc

66
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,320
洛杉磯警局那個?
that's now on the LAPD force?

67
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,070
- 他又怎麼算？
- 他沒受過血禮
- How does that work? - He's not blooded.

68
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,190
他不屬於任何氏族
He's not part of any blooded clan.

69
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
對我們來說 他就像斷掉的手指一樣
He's like a finger that got cut off the hand.

70
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,820
我們就當他死了
He's dead to us.

71
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,730
簡直譁眾取寵
This is shock trauma at its finest.

72
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,110
然後你看那些人類 還有精靈
...and then you see the humans and the Elves...

73
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,900
我也不想跟他坐同一輛車
I don't want this guy in my car either.

74
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,190
親愛的 我不想你再挨槍子了
Baby, I don't want you to get shot again.

75
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,150
再過五年 我就能退休了
Five years, I'm gonna retire.

76
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,820
但…我得拿到我的養老金
But... I can't fuck up my pension.

77
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,730
那是我最擔心的
All right? I mean, that's my fucking worst nightmare.

78
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,940
你知道我最擔心什麼嗎?
You know what my worst nightmare is?

79
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,820
我擔心我上班的時候 有人把病床上或者輪椅上的你送到我面前
It's them wheeling you in when I'm at work.

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,780
那是我最擔心的
That's my nightmare.

81
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,570
過來親一個
Come on. Come here.

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,280
快去殺了那妖精
Fairy. Now.

83
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,030
看 我的警察鄰居來了
Hey, y'all, I want y'all to trip off my police-ass neighbor. He's a trip.

84
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,780
- 警官下午好
- 麥克你好啊
- Good afternoon, Officer. - Hey. What up, Mike?

85
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,820
那妖精在我家到處亂搞
Yo, that Fairy been all up in my crib,

86
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,730
還吃我的狗食
eating up my dog food and shit.

87
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,480
我剛要打電話給市政府呢
I'm about to call the city, man.

88
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,400
我代表的就是市政府
I am the city.

89
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,780
你的電話費省著
All right? You save your dime.

90
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,320
今天妖精的命 算個屁
Fairy lives don't matter today.

91
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,480
大家看著啊 有好戲了
Check this out, y'all. This is probably gonna be good.

92
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,400
開打了
It's on now!

93
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,070
上啊
Ring the bell, y'all.

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,280
挺溜的 你看這黑鬼
Damn. Look at this nigga, man.

95
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,440
就是這樣
Oh, that's it right there.

96
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,690
幹掉他 拿出你警察的樣子來
Oh, you got it now. Take the homie out LAPD-style like you do.

97
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,280
沒必要那麼狠吧 媽的
You ain't gotta do him like that. Damn!

98
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,650
真是慘不忍睹
That was nasty.

99
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,320
- 拜託　　　
- 別這樣兄弟
- Man. - Come on, G.

100
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,190
- 我就是這麼做事的
- 媽的　　　　　　
- It's what I do. - Oh, shit.

101
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,570
你們繼續當你們的小混混
Oh, and, uh, you keep doing all your gangsta stuff.

102
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,440
我只是想把房子給賣了 不用擔心
I'm just trying to sell my house. Don't worry about that.

103
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,010
謝謝你表演 警官
Thanks for the show, Officer.

104
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,030
那個混蛋真是個瘋子 他老婆挺性感的
He's a trip. That motherfucker's crazy. Got a fine-ass wife, too.

105
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,320
你有麻煩了麼?
Are you in trouble?

106
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,820
有麻煩了? 你媽說了什麼?
Am I in trouble? What your mother say to you?

107
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,110
媽媽說尼克讓你惹上麻煩了 因為獸人都是笨蛋
Mom said that Nick got you in trouble because Orcs are dumb.

108
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,900
她說的不對 獸人不是笨蛋
That's not true, all right? Orcs are not dumb.

109
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,400
只是每個種族都各有不同啦
Just, uh... All of the races are-are different. Okay?

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,440
各種族之間的不同 不代表哪個種族就比較聰明
And just 'cause they're different doesn't mean anybody's smarter

111
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,230
或者哪個比較笨什麼的
or dumber, you know,

112
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,480
沒有誰比誰好的
better or worse than anybody.

113
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,400
行嗎? 只是...
All right? It's just-just...

114
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,860
大家只是想要和諧共處 然後...
You know, everybody's just trying to get along and-and...

115
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,650
過好日子
have a good life.

116
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
什麼情況
What the hell?

117
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,480
寶貝 你去穿好衣服 穿好衣服
Hey, baby, you gotta take some clothes. Get some clothes.

118
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,440
知道了
Fine.

119
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,650
嘿
Hey, hey!

120
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,900
嘿 搭檔
Hey, partner.

121
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,730
準備好復工了嗎? 傷勢都好了?
Ready to get back to work? All healed up?

122
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,730
你來我家幹嘛?
What the hell are you doing at my house?

123
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,990
你幹嘛來這? 還站在我家的草坪上?
Why are you at my house? Why are you on my lawn?

124
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,320
你的草坪早死光了
Your lawn's dead, Ward.

125
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,150
沒錯 所以我才在這播種了
Exactly. Which is why I seeded it

126
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,280
然後灑滿牛糞 讓草長回來
and spread cow shit everywhere so it grows back.

127
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,610
那才不是牛糞
That's not really cow shit.

128
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,030
- 什麼意思？　　　　　
- 明明是下水道堛瑭T便
- What do you mean it's not cow shit? - It's sewage, from toilets.

129
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,280
從污水處理廠找來的 肯定是這樣
From the treatment plant, swear to God.

130
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,900
我花了四百塊買回來的
I paid $400 for this.

131
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,780
- 是牛屎　
- 是人的屎
- That's bullshit. - Human shit.

132
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,150
- 你以為我是來這跟你談化肥的？
- 算了　　　　　　　　　　　　
- Why do you think I compost? - Whatever. Whatever. Whatever.

133
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,360
以後你都不准再來我家了
You don't ever come here in that ever again.

134
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,230
我剛去進行多元化培訓 準備去酒吧 剛好經過你家 我以為
I was at diversity training. Your house is on the way to the bar. I thought...

135
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,190
- 嗨尼克　　　　　　　
- 蘇菲雅你好嗎大明星？
- Hi, Nick. - Hey, Sophia. What's up, rock star?

136
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,530
我們要去奶奶家
We're gonna go to Grandma's.

137
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,190
- 去奶奶家？上車我們送你去
- 別扯了　　　　　　　　　
- Grandma's? Hop in, we'll give you a ride. - Shut up.

138
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,320
- 這又不是出租車
- 別叫尼克閉嘴　
- This ain't no Uber, man. - Don't tell Nick to shut up.

139
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,780
他也是個人啦
He's a person, too.

140
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,030
謝謝你 親愛的
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

141
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,230
你女兒還真懂事
That's an enlightened kid you got there, Daryl.

142
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,650
別管我
Don't worry about me.

143
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,730
繼續搞你們的燒烤
Just Crip-walk your asses on back to the barbecue.

144
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,980
我只是想載你一程...
Be nice to give you a ride...

145
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,980
- 閉嘴　　　　　　　　
- ．．．你第一天復工呢
- Shut up. - ...on your first day back.

146
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,650
這歌很好聽
Lovely song.

147
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,610
外婆家到了
There's Grandma.

148
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,730
我...
Hey. Uh, I'm...

149
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,730
好 能見到你真好
Okay. Good to see you.

150
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,400
寶貝 怎麼了?
All right, baby. What's up?

151
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,150
怎麼了? 你怎麼悶悶不樂的?
What's happening? What's up? Why you sad?

152
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,110
怎麼了?
What happened?

153
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,480
我不想你死掉
I don't want you to die.

154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,860
我不會死啦 怎麼了?
I'm not gonna die. What are you...

155
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,280
- 我怎麼會死？　　　　
- 媽媽說尼克會把你害死
- What you talking about? - Mama said Nick's gonna get you killed.

156
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,320
她怎麼會說那種話?
I don't know why she said...

157
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,530
尼克不會害死我啦
Nick is not gonna get me killed, all right?

158
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
你為什麼要當警察?
Why do you have to be a policeman?

159
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,230
大家都討厭警察
Everybody hates policemen.

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
嘿
Hey...

161
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,190
你聞起來好像挺久沒睡覺了
Know what? You smell like you haven't slept.

162
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,780
我的工作包埵鹵げ簪 你晚上睡前吃一顆
I have melatonin in my war bag. You take one before bed,

163
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,480
- 關掉筆記本然後．．
- 也許我晚上會睡不著
- turn off the laptop, get... - Maybe I'm having trouble sleeping

164
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,030
是因為我經常做噩夢
because of the nightmares I'm having

165
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,530
夢見有人用散彈鎗轟我
from being blasted across the street with a shotgun

166
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,480
而你跑去買卷餅了
while your ass was getting a burrito.

167
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,570
我是要買卷餅給你吃啊
But I was getting a burrito for you.

168
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,570
- 對啊　　　　
- 我不吃牛肉的
- Yeah... - I don't eat cow flesh.

169
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,150
你覺得 你去買卷餅的時候
Do you think that you could get a burrito

170
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,150
能同時做好工作嗎?
and do your job?

171
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,900
你覺得 你可以像個人類警察那樣
You think you could get a burrito and watch my back

172
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,570
- 邊買卷餅邊保護好我嗎？
- 可以　　　　　　　　　
- like every other cop manages to do? - Yes.

173
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,900
我知道 你對我失望
Look, I know... you're disappointed in me.

174
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,820
我知道你覺得我沒做好工作 讓你失望了
I know that you think that I let you down.

175
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,570
- 但是你知道嗎？
- 我．．．　　　
- Yeah. You know what? - But I...

176
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,820
新的一天了
You know what? It's a new day.

177
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,940
回去報到後 我們就重頭開始
Back to work. We hitting the reset button.

178
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,820
知道 重頭開始
Copy that. Copy that. We're hitting the reset button.

179
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,530
咱們一起邁步向前
Moving forward together.

180
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,570
咱倆是朋友 並肩作戰
As friends, together.

181
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,570
我們以後不聽獸人音樂了
We will not be listening to no Orkish music.

182
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,900
這是史上最棒的情歌之一
That is one of the greatest love songs ever written.

183
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,780
那是監獄媔ヶ菄滷◇q吧
That's a love song in prison.

184
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,110
我覺得你缺愛了 沃德
I believe that you're lacking in love, Ward.

185
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,230
- 你說什麼？　　
- 我說的愛．．．
- I'm what? - By love, I mean...

186
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,570
我是說肉體上的愛
like... physical love.

187
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,400
對哦
Yeah. Um...

188
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
是吧?
Right?

189
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,230
我是直男 我才不需要那種愛 我挺好的
I'm straight. I don't need no physical love. Trust me, I'm good.

190
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,780
你掩蓋不了的 沃德
You can't hide it, Ward.

191
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,320
人類會顯示出一些外部特徵
Humans have physical tells.

192
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,480
- 特徵？
- 對啊　
- Tells, huh? - Yeah.

193
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,940
- 都在你的臉上寫著呢
- 我現在面無表情　　
- It's called a face. - I ain't making no face.

194
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,150
- 你現在就挺有表情的
- 根本沒有任何表情　
- Like the face you're making right now. - I ain't making no face.

195
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
行吧
All right.

196
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,190
我現在是什麼表情?
What face am I making?

197
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,110
一副"慾求不滿的人類"的表情
"A human who needs a lot more conjugal love" type face.

198
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,150
"慾求不滿"的表情? 所以你很瞭解人類的表情
"Conjugal love" face. So you know human face...

199
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,570
再來一個 人類還有什麼表情?
Show me another human face.

200
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,320
- 人類還有什麼表情
- 額．．　　　　　
- What's another one we make? - Oh, uh...

201
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,070
- 那是什麼表情？　　　　　　　　
- 人類煎餅不夠吃了就是這樣的表情
- What's that face? - Human who doesn't get anymore pancakes.

202
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,780
- 人類確實很喜歡吃煎餅
- 我還能學很多表情呢　
- We do like our pancakes, for real. - I got a lot of 'em.

203
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,380
- 還有很多？
- 確實有很多
- You got a lot? - I got a lot of them.

204
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,860
給我看看一個獸人把嘴閉起來
Show me the face an Orc makes when he just shut the fuck up,

205
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,280
不說話 開車去上班的表情
and don't say shit, and just drive to work.

206
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,730
沒錯 就是這樣!你演得很好
Yeah, that's it! That's it! Oh, you got that one!

207
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,650
真是惟妙惟肖啊
Yeah, you killing that one.

208
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,650
你應該多做那個表情 保持下去就好
You should do that one. Do that one, like, all the time.

209
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,030
你走這邊幹嘛?
Whoa. Whoa. Why you going this way?

210
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,190
沒事 我們這是抄近路
It's fine, it's a shortcut.

211
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,610
這人的人很好的
See? They're very nice here.

212
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,110
夥計 你不能開車經過精靈區啊
Dude, you can't go through Elftown.

213
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,400
你這是要害死我啊 夥計
You are killing me. Killing me, dude.

214
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,570
你是要幹嘛? 去買名牌鞋子嗎?
So, what, you trying to... get yourself some designer shoes?

215
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,730
這堻ㄛO超有錢的精靈
Ain't nothing over here but rich-ass Elves

216
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,150
操控世界 一直在瘋狂購物
just running the world and shopping.

217
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,030
我最討厭精靈區了
I hate Elftown.

218
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,610
連司機都瞧不起人
Even the chauffeurs are snobs.

219
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,940
沃德 這麼快就回來了?
Hey. Back already, Ward?

220
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,820
跟你同車的那個外族獸人呢?
Where's the, uh, diversity hire you ride with?

221
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,150
你跟雅各比是什麼搭檔? 跳舞的舞伴嗎?
Yeah, what kind of partner is Jakoby? Is he your dance partner?

222
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,400
是炮友嗎?
Your sexual partner?

223
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,530
我覺得他抓壞人方面不怎麼在行
'Cause he fucking sucks at catching bad guys.

224
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,280
那是氏族法規
That's Clan Law shit, dog.

225
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,320
獸人得互相照應的
Orcs got each other's backs.

226
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,360
你們怎麼說得好像是我特意選他做我的搭檔?
Hey, look, why y'all acting like I put this dude in my car?

227
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,280
所以你打算要怎樣把他趕走?
So what are you doing to get him the fuck out of this division, my friend?

228
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,860
要是他能幹好工作的話 我沒什麼辦法趕他走
Hey, long as he pull his weight, I ain't got no beef with him.

229
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,500
你可以想想辦法啊
No. No, no, no. You could do shit, man.

230
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,570
寫封信之類的 我們配合你 他就死定了
You could write a letter. His ass would be gone if we back you up.

231
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,860
肯定沒錯
That's a fact.

232
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,190
- 沃德你不在乎就算了
- 嗯　　　　　　　　
- But you only care about yourself, Ward. - Right.

233
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,570
我也沒有徵求你的建議啊
Did I... Did I ask you for advice?

234
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,860
我大概等到第九次離婚的時候 再問問你的意見
'Cause I'll probably wait till I'm on my, like, ninth divorce,

235
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,900
到時候你的建議 大概會很有用
then your advice will come in really handy.

236
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,570
好啊 真他媽好 我會記住
That's good. That's fucking good. Noted.

237
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,610
那個獸人混蛋 依然逍遙法外
Meanwhile, that Orc fuck is still out there

238
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,860
就因為雅各比 更看重氏族血統 而不是他的警徽
because Jakoby chose clan blood over the badge.

239
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,730
可能那個嫌犯只是逃走了而已
Or the motherfucker just got away.

240
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,440
雅各比放他走了 他才逃得掉
He got away 'cause Jakoby let him.

241
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,480
然後呢?
What happens next?

242
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,690
要是這個臭豬頭
What happens the next time this pig motherfucker

243
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,150
　　　　　　　　
再找警察下手呢？
makes a cop suck-start his fucking 12-gauge?

244
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,030
萬一倒霉的是布朗
Only this time, it's Brown,

245
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,190
或者是希克斯 或者是我呢?
or it's Hicks, or it's fucking me.

246
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,440
那時候你會怎麼想 沃德? 到時候你可就要負責了
How you gonna feel, Ward? 'Cause that shit is on you.

247
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,150
如果是你的話 我大概...
Well, if you in the box, I'll probably be like...

248
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,030
沃德 你這個狗娘養的
Ward, you son of a bitch.

249
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,730
聽著 他跟我同車
Hey, look, I got a dude in my car,

250
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,980
全世界都盯著我們看呢
the whole world is watching, all right?

251
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,530
我沒有主動要求跟他同車 我不想這樣 但沒有人徵求過我的意見
I didn't ask for it, I don't want it, but I don't get a vote.

252
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,110
要是上頭僱用更多的獸人怎麼辦? 他們都說
And what happens if they hire more? You know what they say.

253
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,190
跟隨過魔君的 永遠都是魔君的爪牙
Once with the Dark Lord, always with the Dark Lord.

254
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,570
他們選擇邪惡的一方
They chose evil.

255
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,730
我就不明白了
Here's the thing I can't understand.

256
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,110
你們這群笨蛋 連自己孩子媽媽的生日都記不清楚
How do a bunch of dudes who can barely remember their baby mama's birthday

257
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,320
怎麼會對兩千年前的事情念念不忘
have beef with a whole race

258
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,860
就因為這屁事仇視一整個種族?
over some shit that happened 2,000 years ago?

259
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,150
你聽好了 夥計
Here's the fucking deal, man.

260
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,900
你他們的讓雅各比離我遠點
You keep Jakoby the fuck away from me. Okay?

261
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,860
逼急了我會把這獸人給斃了 我他媽的天不怕地不怕
I'll drop an Orc. I don't give a fuck.

262

The Prophecy has chosen you.

392
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,650
跟你一起的那個人受到了祝福
The man with you is blessed.

393
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,690
雅各比!
Jakoby!

394
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,690
小心點 兄弟
Come on, man.

395
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,280
你到底是怎麼了? 他說了什麼?
What the hell is your problem? What'd he say?

396
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,610
他在胡說八道
He's not making any sense.

397
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,860
雅各比在哪?
Where's Jakoby?

398
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,110
在記錄我們逮捕的犯人
Uh, booking our body, ma'am.

399
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,360
我很喜歡你的髮型
Um, I love your hair.

400
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,110
你是哪位?
Who are you?

401
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,650
我可以解雇你 或者送你去坐牢
I'm the unemployment line, or a prison sentence.

402
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,360
我也可以是救贖你的天使 你的命運掌握在自己手上 夥計
I could be the Angel of Mercy, but it's up to you, buddy.

403
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,530
內務部
Internal Affairs.

404
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:54,320
沒錯 來找你好幾次了 我們來回顧一下案情
That's right, all fucking day long. Now, let's review, kids.

405
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,650
有個豬頭混蛋 用霰彈槍擊中你的防彈衣
Some pigskin piece of shit puts a load of buckshot into your trauma plate.

406
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,030
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
那個混帳徒步逃走雅各比去追捕．．．
- Shithead foot-bails, Jakoby pursues... - Hey!

407
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,570
嘿
Hey!

408
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,440
警察 別跑!
Police! Stop!

409
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,230
然後把犯人追到了一個死胡同?
...corners his asshole in, what, a dead-end alley? 

410
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,940
雅各比聲稱和疑犯扭打在一起 他的武器掉在地上
Jakoby states dude tackled and disarmed him.

411
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,150
然後跳上放火梯 逃離追捕
Then jumped on a fire escape ladder and evaded arrest.

412
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,230
這是雅各比簽名的口供
Jakoby's signed statement.

413
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,440
我們測量過了 那條梯子離地有4米高
Ladder's 13 feet off the ground. We measured.

414
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,860
　　　　　　　　　
沒有獸人能跳那麼高
- No Orc has a six-foot vertical.

415
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,610
也許疑犯身手很好 長官
Perhaps the suspect was light on his feet, sir.

416
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,110
獸人懂輕功嗎?
Do Orcs have, uh, mad hops?

417
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,730
有多少獸人打籃球?
How many Orcs are ballers?

418
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,030
- 什麼意思？　　　
- 你聽到他說的話了
- Excuse me? - You fuckin' heard the detective.

419
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,440
- 有多少獸人打職業籃球？
- 沒有　　　　　　　　　
- How many Orcs play pro basketball? - None.

420
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,980
他們行動緩慢 很笨拙
They're slow, they're heavy.

421
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,360
所以職業足球 有一半的防守線鋒都是獸人
That's why half the NFL defensive lines are Orkish.

422
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,730
這不是種族歧視 是物理定律
It's not racism, it's physics.

423
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,480
肯定是雅各比放走了 拿槍轟你的那個豬頭混蛋
Jakoby kicked loose that pigskin fuck who blasted you.

424
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,780
你自己想想
Do the math.

425
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,780
在獸人眼中 氏族法規高於一切 那是事實
Orcs hold Clan Law above all else. That's a fact.

426
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,570
雅各比的事非常敏感 全世界都在看
The Jakoby issue is sensitive. The world's watching.

427
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,440
- 我們不能無緣無故就解雇他
- 所以．．．　　　　　　　
- We can't fire him without cause. - Which is why...

428
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,110
你要讓他認罪
you're gonna get him to admit it...

429
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,530
而且要錄音
and you're gonna record him.

430
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,780
走開啦
The fuck outta here.

431
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,730
我也不想跟他同車
I want the guy out of my car, but...

432
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,360
要是我告密的話 我巡警就混不下去了
I snitch, I'm done as a street cop.

433
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,400
我們知道你還不起房貸
We know, uh, you got a house note you can't pay down.

434
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,070
對吧? 債台高築
Right? Drowning in debt.

435
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,230
還有一個女兒 你都要養不起了
Raising a little girl you can't afford to pay for.

436
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,110
還真是他們的模範父親
Father of the fucking year.

437
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,110
你再提起我的家人 我就把你的頭劈成兩半
You talk about my family again, I'll split your fucking head open.

438
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,190
沃德
Ward.

439
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,110
你要保住這份工作
You need this job.

440
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,360
別為了雅各比 放棄這一切
Don't throw it away for Jakoby.

441
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
別碰我
Get off me. Get off me.

442
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,780
錄音筆給我
Give it to me.

443
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,480
我不出庭作證
No testifying...

444
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,030
不會作供
no depositions,

445
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,320
也不寫報告
no paperwork.

446
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
沒問題
Good man.

447
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,110
很識相
Very smart.

448
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,030
把你的小鬍子剃掉 混蛋
Shave your mustache, bitch.

449
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,650
公事公辦而已
It's just business.

450
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,230
這個地方一團糟
Place is a shithole.

451
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,650
獸人還戴警章
An Orc with a badge.

452
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,440
真是難以置信
Incredible.

453
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:42,280
這種事可不常見 就像精靈拿著拖把
That's some shit you don't see every day. Like an Elf with a mop.

454
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,030
你看到他們嗎?
Did you see those two guys?

455
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,150
他們好像是聯邦探員 是來找我麻煩的嗎?
I think they're feds. Could they be here for me?

456
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,900
聯邦探員才不在乎 洛杉磯的獸人社區呢
Feds don't give a shit about the LA Orc community.

457
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,360
你說的也對
Yeah, you're right.

458
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,280
我女兒...
S... So, my-my daughter...

459
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
蘇菲雅
Sophia...

460
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,530
她常常做一些不該做的事情
she be doing shit all the time, man, that she don't have no business doing.

461
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,820
但她很誠實
But... she comes clean.

462
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,650
每次都會說實話
She always tells the truth.

463
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,570
因為知道 說實話是很好的
'Cause she realized it feels good.

464
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,570
她好我也好
Feels good to her, feels good to me.

465
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,230
有時候
And, uh, truth just has a way...

466
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,780
真相能掃除兩個人之間的陰霾
of clearing the air between people.

467
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,480
可以讓一些事情更明瞭 你懂嗎?
If it cleanses... cleanses some shit, you know,

468
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,530
所以說實話就行了
it's like, just tell the truth.

469
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,730
我知道局埵酗@些很不好的事情
I know something very bad happened at the station.

470
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,030
我知道的
I know.

471
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,690
所以你打算告訴我麼?
So are you gonna tell me about it or no?

472
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,100
我是在說你的事情
I'm talking about you. All right?

473
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,440
你不用迴避話題 警局沒事發...
Don't be trying to twist this. Nothing happened at the...

474
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,460
- 我沒有迴避．．．　　　　　
- 亞布罕街３４１號有不明騷動
- I'm not... - ...trouble, 341 Abrams.

475
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,610
事件編號2815
Code two, incident 2815.

476
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,730
　　　　　　　　　　　　
３Ａ９小隊報告我們在路上
Three-Adam-9, show us en route.

477
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,070
去亞布罕街341號
341 Abrams.

478
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,480
　　　　　
３Ａ９明白
Three-A-9, roger.

479
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,320
你加入光明之盾組織有多久了?
How long you been in Shield of Light?

480
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,110
那是什麼東西?
What's that?

481
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,230
天
God!

482
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,940
你個小混帳
You little fuck-up.

483
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,900
該死的!你在幹嘛?
Aah! Shit! What are you doing, man?

484
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,780
別發問 給我閉嘴
No questions, just shut up.

485
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,440
這個光明之盾紋身不錯啊
Hey, nice Shield of Light tattoo!

486
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,650
- 真不錯啊　　　　
- 知道我們是誰嗎？
- Good one. - You know who we are?

487
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,820
打掃房間的
Housekeeping.

488
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,730
你看看這個
You might wanna look at this.

489
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,110
該死的 魔法調查隊
Fuck. Magic Task Force.

490
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,480
對 我們是魔法聯邦探員
Right. The magic feds.

491
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,980
沙堮 要是你繼續耍小聰明
You know, Serling, if you're gonna play stupid games,

492
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,440
下場會很慘
you're gonna win stupid prizes.

493
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,530
去死吧
Fuck you.

494
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,940
混蛋 你再惹我試試?
You wanna test me, asshole?

495
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,610
好了 我不是你的敵人
Okay! I'm not your enemy, man.

496
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,190
你瞭解煉獄黨的情況麼
What do you know about the Inferni?

497
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,780
他們是精靈
Um... they're Elves.

498
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,400
是叛亂的精靈
Renegade Elves.

499
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,150
叛亂精靈 不好意思
Renegade Elves, sorry.

500
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,110
因為精靈們都超棒的 對吧?
Because Elves are awesome, right?

501
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,530
他們要讓魔君復活
They're gonna bring back the Dark Lord.

502
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,860
天方夜譚
Fairy fucking tales.

503
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,610
他們打算怎麼讓他復活?
How do they plan to do that?

504
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,530
他們獲得三根魔杖 就能讓他死而復生
When they get three Magic Wands, they can raise him from the dead.

505
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,610
你認得這個人嗎?
You recognize her?

506
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,440
那是莉拉
That's Leilah.

507
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,030
她是煉獄黨的頭目
She's an Inferni coven leader.

508
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,690
她是個光靈
She's a Bright.

509
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,820
你有沒有注意到到大部分的光靈都是精靈
You ever notice how most Brights are Elves,

510
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,110
然後整個世界都是精靈說了算嗎?
and Elves run the world?

511
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,280
是巧合嗎?
Coincidence?

512
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,360
光靈中也有人類
There are human Brights.

513
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,280
一百萬個人類中才有一個吧
One in a million.

514
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,280
你知道怎樣才能判別一個人是不是光靈麼?
But you know how you know if you're a Bright?

515
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,110
光靈能徒手
When you touch a Wand...

516
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,320
觸碰魔杖
with your bare hand...

517
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,320
還不會把自己炸死
and don't explode.

518
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,730
你會去試試麼?
Would you do that?

519
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,730
為了發現真相 你願意拿自己的命去冒險嗎?
Would you die to learn the truth about yourself?

520
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,780
要是我有魔杖的話 我會試試
If I had a Wand... I'd try.

521
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,230
我們言歸正傳
Let's get back on track.

522
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,150
所以莉拉手上有一根魔杖 然後她在追殺媞卡 對吧?
So Leilah has a Magic Wand, and she's coming after Tikka, right?

523
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,940
她寧可把整個城市鬧個底朝天 也要達成自己的目標
And she'll shred this city to do it.

524
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,860
我們只要找到媞卡 就能設陷阱抓獲莉拉
We get Tikka, we can set a trap for Leilah.

525
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,650
我們要找到魔杖 追捕光靈
We hunt Wands, we hunt Brights.

526
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,940
我們就是幹這行的 而且我們挺擅長幹這個的
That's what we do, and we're pretty fucking good at it.

527
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,230
你要不要幫助我們?
You wanna help us?

528
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,570

Come on.

魔君要歸來了

531
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,190
拿無人機炸他?
Huh? You gonna drone him?

532
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,650
兩千年前 魔法的力量阻止了他
Two thousand years ago, magic stopped him.

533
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,110
只有魔法能再次擊倒他
And magic will stop him again.

534
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,480
總有一天 你們會乞求我們幫忙
One day, you all are gonna come begging for our help.

535
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,650
我們會阻止魔君的
And we'll be there. We'll stop him.

536
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,110
光明之盾會阻止他
The Shield of Light will stop him.

537
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
說完了
I'm done.

538
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
我們說完了
We're done.

539
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,480
如果你跟我作對
If you act like my enemy...

540
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,030
你就是我的敵人
you become my enemy.

541
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
看到了麼?
See that?

542
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,320
　　　　　
是個把風的
- Oh, it's a spotter. - Mm-hmm.

543
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,690
趴下 找掩護
Get down! Down! Go!

544
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,650
這可不太妙
Oh. Yeah, that's... That's not good.

545
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,070
　　　　　　
我們可能會死
- Yeah. - We could die.

546
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,780

- 對　　　　　　　　　
- First time being shot at? - Yeah.

547
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,320
不得不說 這挺不妙的
I have to say, I dislike it very much.

548
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,110
對 糟透了
Yeah, it fucking sucks.

549
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,730
聽著 數三聲 我們就反擊
All right, look... on three, we're gonna dump this asshole.

550
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,190
行嗎?
All right?

551
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,110
- 很合理

00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,780
- 你還好嗎？
- 還好　　　
- You all right? - Hmm? Yeah.

555
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,610
　　　　　　　　　
身上沒多幾個洞吧？
- No holes? - Huh? Uh...

556
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,530
身上只有生下來那幾個洞
Only the ones that I was born with.

557
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
你呢?
How are your holes?

558
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,530
你怎麼能讓槍戰的氣氛都變的這麼尷尬?
The fuck can you make a shootout awkward?

559
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,190
對不起
Sorry.

開門 去開門
Get the door. Get the door.

很多血
Lots of blood.

572

00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,150
這媯o生了怪事
Something unusual has happened here.

現場可能有光靈
Possible Bright at our location.

590
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,780
要求其他小隊增援 請魔法監督員到場
Request additional units and a supervisor.

591
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,440
我重複一遍 現場可能有魔法使用者
I repeat: Possible magic-user on scene.

592
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,650
別跑!
Hey! Freeze!

593
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,650

別動！抓住她
- Hold her, hold her! - Stop! Stop! Stop!

597
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
她拿著什麼?
What has she got?

598
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,230
那是什麼?
What is that? What is that?

599
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,480
去找其他兄弟
Go get the homies.

600
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,860
把它放下 否則我打死你!
Put it down or I'm gonna shoot you in your face!

601
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,860
那是...?
Is that...?

602
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,480
是魔杖
It's a Magic Wand.

603
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,230
什麼...? 誰...?
Who, uh...

604
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,650
你是誰?
Who are you?

605
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,570
求你們保護我
Please protect me.

606
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,190
她在說精靈語
She's speaking Elvish.

607
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,070
我不懂精靈語
I don't speak Elvish.

608
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,150
我高中的時候學了兩年精靈語
Well, I took two years in high school, but, uh...

609
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
她說有人要來了
She said somebody's coming.

610
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,440
求你們保護我和魔杖
Please protect me and the Wand.

611
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:34,150
依我所見 有光靈來到這 使用了魔杖
As far as I can tell, a Bright came in, used the Wand, and...

612
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,610
用魔法把所有人弄成那樣
magicked everybody the fuck up. Uh...

613
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,860
我們要撤離這個區域 清空現場
We need to evacuate this neighborhood, secure the scene,

614
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,730
設立警戒線 等聯邦探員抵達
hold the perimeter till the feds get here.

615
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,360
你們他媽的在想什麼 都是新來的嗎?
What the fuck are you, new?

616
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,320
- 這情況我們處理不了
- 那是魔法　　　　　
- This is way above our pay grade. - That's magic right there.

617
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,400
可以達成任何願望
That's whatever you want.

618
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,230
想要一百萬嗎?
You want a million dollars?

619
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,360
一千萬?
You want ten million?

620
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,110
想長高或者矮一點麼?
You wanna be taller or shorter?

621
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,230
想讓老二變大麼?
Make your dick bigger?

622
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,980
想回到過去 娶那個沒在高中舞會給你口交的女孩結婚麼?
You wanna go back in time, marry the girl who didn't blow you on prom night?

623
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,730
用這個就行
That's how you do it, right there.

624
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,440
顯然 我們的高中舞會沒你們那麼開放
Well, clearly, we had different prom nights.

625
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,440
但那是一根魔杖啊
But that is a Magic Wand,

626
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,320
你根本不懂怎麼用它
and you don't know how to use it.

627
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,650
亂來的話 只會害死我們
And you're gonna kill us all trying.

628
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,070
只有光靈能用魔杖 我看你就不像個巫師
Only a Bright can use a Wand, and you don't look like a wizard to me.

629
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,190
別碰那根魔杖
Don't put your hands on that Wand.

630
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,530
- 別碰它　
- 我能搞定
- Hey, don't touch the Wand. - I got it.

631
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,940
別碰
Don't touch it.

632
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,030
嘿... 不要...
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be...

633
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,190
好涼啊
Fucking ice cold.

634
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,830
- 你不能把魔杖偷走
- 沒有人會來的沃德
- All right, you're not stealing that Wand. - Nobody's coming, Ward.

635
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,190
你們這是要幹嘛?
Fuck is you squaring off on, bitch?

636
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,690
警長 你得管好你的手下
Hey, Sarge, you need to talk to your boys right now.

637
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,150
你跟我們一樣 需要這根魔杖發家致富 也許比我們更需要
You need this just as much as we do, maybe more.

638
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,400
你的家人就靠你了 你不想幫他們嗎?
Your family depends on you. Don't you wanna be there for them?

639
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,150
那雅各比呢?
What about Jakoby?

640
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,070
你能告訴我 你的名字嗎?
Can you tell me your name?

641
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,230
- 媞卡
- 媞卡

642

我叫媞卡
My name is Tikka.

643
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,320
她要來了 我們要離開這
We have to leave before she comes.

644
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,570
誰要來?
Before who comes?

645
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,440
不能這樣
It's not happening.

646
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,440
不行
No. No.

647
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,530
伯拉德 他在猶豫
Pollard, he's spinning.

648
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,330
- 他根本沒猶豫的
- 他沒事　　　　
- No, he's not spinning worth shit. - He's fine, he's fine.

649
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,610
- 這不太妙
- 冷靜點　
- This is stupid. - Calm down.

650
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,690
- 冷靜點他沒事的
- 別過來　　　　
- Hey, fucking chill. He's fine. - Back up.

651
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,660
- 他沒事　　　
- 別他媽的碰我
- He's fin... Hey, hey! - The fuck you gonna do?

652
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,690
冷靜點 別亂來 退後
Calm down. Fucking calm down. Back the fuck up.

653
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,440
退後點 聽著
Back the fuck up. Listen. Listen.

654
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,650
我們事在必行
This is happening.

655
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,030
- 已經決定了
- 別碰我　　
- This is fucking happening. - Fuck off of me.

656
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,230

657
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,610
- 該死的

658
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,610
沒事的
It's okay.

659
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,480
你走出這道門 你的人生軌跡就徹底改變了
There's no version of you walking out of here with life as you know it intact.

660
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:07,230
我不管了 我們拿走魔杖 殺了那個獸人
Fuck this. We are taking the Wand, and the Orc dies.

661
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,150
你現在必須做決定
And you got a big decision right now.

662
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,480
你是想讓自己女兒變成孤兒 然後雅各比再步你的後塵
Either your little girl grows up without a daddy and Jakoby dies,

663
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,070
還是只有雅各比死 你自己選吧
or just Jakoby dies. And it is time to make a choice.

664
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,530
你或他 沃德 你死還是他死
You or him, Ward. You or him.

665
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:23,110
明天的報紙會說什麼來著 有一個警察死在這 還是兩個?
Is tomorrow's LA Times gonna say one cop died here, or two? 

666
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,150
看他這樣子 他明白我們的意思了
Yeah, there it is. He just caught up to it.

667
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,360
這真是皆大歡喜啊
Everyone wins.

668
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,280
咱們警局能擺脫雅各比 他死得風光 大眾也會高興
Department gets rid of Jakoby, he dies a hero, public's happy.

669
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,360
報告也不用多寫了
This report writes itself.

670
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,400
一切都很完美啊
The perfect storm, bro.

671
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,730
這麼完美的機會
It's the perfect storm.

672
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,030
你沒事吧?
You okay?

673
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,530
你帶上蘇菲雅 馬上離開城
Hey. Take Sophia, get out of town right now.

674
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,860
什麼? 怎麼了?
What? Why?

675
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,150
馬上出城去 我愛你
Get out of town right now. I love you.

676
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,070
沃德 其他人呢? 我們還沒設好警戒線
Ward, where is everyone? We haven't even set a perimeter.

677
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,780
我敢肯定 那個小混混一定看到魔杖了
I'm pretty certain that pee-wee gangster saw the Wand.

678
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,690
她怕得要命 她說有人要來
And she is spooked. Says somebody's coming.

679
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,860
好像是什麼壞傢伙要來了
Like... Like, someone bad.

680
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,900
怎麼...?
But what's...?

681
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,820
你看起來好像遇上了大麻煩
You seem like you-you have bigger troubles.

682
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,230
是你讓那個槍手跑掉的 對不對?
You let the shooter go, didn't you?

683
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,440
因為他也是獸人 有氏族血統?
'Cause he was clan blood?

684
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,900
你確定現在要跟我談這個?
Now? You wanna fucking go through this right now?

685
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,900
你還撒了什麼謊 豬頭?
What else you lie about, pigface?

686
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,070
你他媽的別碰我
Don't put your fucking hands on me!

687
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,690
你把我害慘了
You fucked me.

688
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,150
你把我們都害慘了
You fucked us both.

689
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,230
你這個豬頭混帳
Pigskin piece of shit.

690
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,280
你為了一個獸人 把我一輩子都搞砸了
You fucked my whole life over some stupid Orc knucklehead.

691
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,480
你去死吧 沃德
Fuck you, Ward.

692
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,570
滾開
Fuck off.

693
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,980
- 什麼．．．　　
- 你有種就掏槍啊
- What...? - I dare you.

694
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,360
有種你就給我拔槍
I dare you to pull your gun. Please.

695
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,690
來啊
Go ahead.

696
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,400
跟我槍戰 你死定了
I will fuck you up in a gunfight.

697
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,900
我給了你很多機會 讓你說實話
I gave you plenty of time to talk about this shit.

698
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,610
- 天網恢恢這下報應來了
- 是我放他走的　　　　
- Karma is a bitch, and here it come. - I let him go.

699
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,730
所以我們打算怎樣?
So what's the real plan?

700
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,820
今晚死兩個警察
Two cops die tonight.

701
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,860
那個精靈怎麼處理?
What about the Elf?

702
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,570
我會殺了她
I'll kill her.

703
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,150
- 行嗎？
- 行　　
- You good? - Yes, sir.

704
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,110
- 好的
- 警長
- Yeah. - Sarge?

705
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,650
你看到我的獠牙嗎? 它們被磨掉了
You see my teeth? They're filed.

706
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:33,360
我沒受血禮 我爸沒受血禮 我的爺爺也沒受血禮
I'm not blooded, my father's not blooded, his father's not blooded.

707
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,980
我這輩子受盡同族人的羞辱
I've been shit on by Orcs my whole fucking life.

708
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,900
你知道被自己族人唾棄 是怎樣的一種感覺麼?
Huh? You know what that feels like, when your own people hate you?

709
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,730
你為什麼要說謊?
Why'd you lie, Nick?

710
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,650
跟什麼氏族血統無關
It wasn't clan politics.

711
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,110
我只是抓錯了人
I just had the wrong guy.

712
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,570
那你來解釋一下?
Story time?

713
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,320
開槍射你的那個人 混入人群 我跟丟了他
The guy that shot you, I lost him in the crowd.

714
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,730
繞了一圈 我以為我逮住他了
I circled back, and I thought I had that fucking guy dead to rights.

715
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,230
但那只是另一個小鬼 他只是在塗鴉而已
But it was a different kid. He was just tagging.

716
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,610
其他警察也快到了
And the troops are coming.

717
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,190
一群沖昏頭的人類拿著槍 要找槍擊警察的獸人
Jacked-up humans with guns looking for an Orc who'd shot a cop.

718
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,110
你覺得那孩子還能活命麼?
You think that kid had a chance? 

719
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,190
快走!
Go, go, go!

720
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,570
他們肯定當場斃了他 所以我做了正確的選擇 放他走了
They would've dropped him on the spot, so I did the right thing.

721
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
- 四級事態
- 安全　　
- Code four. - Clear.

722
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,480
你又沒看到他的臉 怎麼知道他不是開槍打我的那個人?
You never saw his face. How'd you know it wasn't the motherfucker that shot me?

723
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,150
因為他的氣味
His fucking smell.

724
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,820
進化並沒有我們喪失嗅覺能力
Yeah, years of evolution haven't taken away our sense of smell.

725
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,230
他聞起來不一樣
And he smelled different.

726
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,570
- 有哪個人類的陪審團會相信我說的這些話麼？
- 他是噴了體香劑嗎？　　　　　　　　　　　
- What human jury would believe me? - What, he have Axe body spray?

727
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,820
你看 他們也會用你這種鳥話質疑我
Yeah, see, this is what I have to fucking deal with.

728
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,940
開槍射你的獸人
The Orc that shot you...

729
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,530
- 逃了　
- 沃德！
- got away. - Ward!

730
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,320
時間到了
It's time.

731
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,690
時間...到了?
"It's... time"?

732
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,190
什麼時間?
Time for... Time for what?

733
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,230
他們四個都在?
All four of 'em standing there?

734
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,900
- 對　　　　　　　　　　
- 從你的左邊數起都是誰？
- Yeah. - Your left to right, who is it?

735
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,030
布朗 希克斯 伯拉德和程 怎麼了 沃德?
Brown, Hicks, Pollard, and Ching. What's going on, Ward?

736
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,070
不...不要...
Don't, don't, don't, don't...

737
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,400
不要
Don't.

738
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,570
搭檔 不要!
Partner, no!

739
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,530
放下槍 否則我打死你
Drop it, or I will fucking kill you.

740
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,280
聽我說
Hey, listen to me.

741
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,820
你不是這樣的人
This isn't like you.

742
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,690
好了 冷靜點
All right, calm down.

743
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,230
- 我知道這看起來挺糟的
- 閉嘴讓我看到你的雙手
- I know it looks bad. - Shut up. Shut up, show me your hands.

744
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,320
- 我別無選擇
- 閉嘴　　　
- I didn't have a choice, Nick. - Shut up.

745
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,730
轉過身去
Now turn back around!

746
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
你有什麼計劃?
What's your plan?

747
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,980
我...
I'm...

748
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,940
我要逮捕你 所以給我閉嘴!
I'm gonna arrest you, so... so shut up!

749
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,230
首先 別再叫我閉嘴
First of all, stop telling me to shut up.

750
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,030
第二 你給我閉嘴
Second, I need you to shut up

751
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,650
- 好好聽我說
- 閉嘴！　　
- and listen to me. - Shut up!

752
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,280
轉過身去 跪下!
Turn around! Get on your fucking knees!

753
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,440
你想把我銬上 除非你先殺了我
Gonna have to fuckin' kill me if you think you're gonna put me in handcuffs.

754
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,650
沃德
Ward...

755
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,690
　　　　　　　
３Ａ９小隊報告
Three-Adam-9.

現場有四位警員倒下 其中一人昏迷 還有呼吸
I got four officers down, one officer conscious and breathing.

757
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,900
三位警員
Three officers...

758
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,530
殉職
KMA.

00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,860
各小隊 有警員需要幫助 亞布罕街341號
All units, officer needs help, 341 Abrams.

760
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,820
有警員需要幫助 亞布罕街341號
Officer needs help, 341 Abrams.

761
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,820

- 這真是糟透了
- Roger on the RA. - Oh, this is bad.

762
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,530
糟透了
This is so bad.

763
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,980
你別慌
Put your big girl panties on.

764
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,690
他們本來打算殺了我們 偷走魔杖
They were gonna kill us... over that Wand, all right?

765
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,780
他們瘋掉了
They were acting crazy.

766
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,650
別說話 別告訴任何人
Don't you say a word. Not to me, not to anybody.

767
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,690
雅各比 這些人是誰?
Jakoby? Jakoby, who are these people?

768
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,190
讓她上車
Oh, shit. Put her in the truck. Put her in the truck.

769
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,110
保護魔杖
Keep the Wand safe!

770
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,980
你們想怎樣?
Motherfucker, what?

771
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,900
保護魔杖
Protect the Wand.

772
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,230
那幾位警察...他們還好嗎?
Those cops there... they okay?

773
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,780
他們流了很多血啊 夥計
That's a lot of blood, homes.

774
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,030
那不關你的事
That ain't none of your concern.

775
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,690
　　　　　　　　　　　　　
你該去替他們做一下人工呼吸
Maybe you should go over and give 'em a little mouth-to-mouth. Huh?

776
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,980
這是犯案現場
This is an active crime scene.

777
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,730
我們沒有過節 你們回家吧
We ain't never had no beef, Poison. Why don't you take your people home.

778
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,650
我聽說 這埵酗@根魔杖
Word on the street, there's a Wand in this hood.

779
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:48,980
在哪呢 夥計
Where's it at, man?

780
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:50,860
- 這是我的地盤　　　　
- 我們是阿爾塔米拉幫的
- My hood. - Altamira.

781
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,610
　　　　　　　　　　　
大名鼎鼎的阿爾塔米拉幫
Alta-fucking-mira, eh?

782
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,030
沒錯
That's right.

783
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,610
所以我的小兄弟告訴我 有一群警察在我的地盤
So, when the little homies tell that the cops are shooting each other

784
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,190
自相殘殺
in my hood...

785
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,480
我就很好奇
makes me wonder. Hmm?

786
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,320
魔杖在哪?
Where's the Wand?

787
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,690
那只是謠傳
Ghetto rumors, homie.

788
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:11,320
你不想為了謠傳吃子彈吧?
Don't wanna get shot in your face over a rumor, do you?

789
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:12,860
你們回家吧
Why don't you go head home?

790
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,690
魔杖是屬於人民的
The Wand belongs to the people.

791
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,690
- 屬於貧民窟的人民
- 退後點　　　　　
- To the barrio. - Get back!

792
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,820

是我的
It's mine...

795
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,190
我殺光洛杉磯所有警察也要拿到魔杖
if I have to kill every fucking cop in LA.

796
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,650
你來試試啊 特警隊還有90秒就到
You're gonna get your chance, 'cause SWAT is about 90 seconds out.

797
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,110
尼克 上車
Nick, get in the truck.

798
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,930
快他媽的上車去
Get in the fucking truck, Nick!

799
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,320

800
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,900
- 去死的是你
- 你去死　　
- Fuck you, homie. - Fuck you.

801
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,570
怎麼了 你把狗狗染黑了?
What is that, a fuckin' Labradoodle you dipped in ink?

802
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,730
- 跟小豬亂搞麼夥計
- 醜得要命的混蛋　
- Messed with puerco, homie. - Fucking ugly-ass motherfucker.

803
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,440
我看他就像豬
Looks like a puerco to me.

804
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,530
把魔杖拿給我
Get me that Wand.

805
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,820
把窗關上 防彈玻璃
Windows up, bulletproof.

806
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,150
- 特警隊要來嗎？

- Is a SWAT team coming? - No, Nick. Go. Go!

807
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,650
- 方向錯了　　　
- 車上有人趴著呢
- Wrong way, Nick. - Yeah, well, someone was on the car.

808
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,530
給我回來 狗娘養的!
Come back, you motherfucker!

809

811
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,390
我們快走 能開多快開多快
Let's get the fuck outta here. Drive like you stole it.

812
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,150
阿爾塔米拉幫的兄弟們 我們去追這混蛋
Altamira gang, homie. Let's get these motherfuckers.

813
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,150
快!...
Go! Go!

814
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,690
往前開 不要側著開
Drive straight, not sideways!

815
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,780
媽的 我沒子彈了
Shit, I'm out.

816
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,280
- 該死的　　　　
- 你這笨手笨腳的
- Shit. - Butterfingers.

817
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,530
我們剛剛還那麼順利
We were doing so good.

818
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,730
警校堨i不會教這個
They don't teach that at the academy.

819
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,150
確實不會
No, they do not.

820
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,440
我們要回頭 把車停下 煉獄幫
We have to turn back. Stop the car. Inferni!

821
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,360
- 是煉獄幫
- 冷靜點　
- Inferni! Inferni! - Relax, relax.

822
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,820
- 她說什麼呢　
- 她不會罷休的
- The hell is she saying? - She won't let it go!

823
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,730
該死的!
Oh, shit!

824
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,230
發生什麼事了?
What's happening? Hey!

825
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,980
閉嘴!這是什麼東西?
Hey, shut up! Shut up! What is that?

826
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,030
閉嘴!
Shut up!

827
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,570
- 什麼東西？
- 有問題嗎？
- The fuck? - Problem?

828
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,730
技術部監聽到一些手機通話...
Tech services is flagging some weird-ass cell phone inter...

829
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,440
提到了魔杖
Talking about a Magic Wand.

830
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,900
救命 救我
Help me. Help.

831
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,400
娜莉卡
Larika.

832
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,150
莉拉 那個叛徒逃了
Leilah. The traitor escaped.

833
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,360
她拿了你的魔杖
She has your Wand.

834
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,730
我的眼睛濺到血了 我們撞到什麼了?
I got blood in my eye. What the fuck did we hit?

835
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,820
那是魔杖
Oh, that was the Wand.

836
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,070
你知道捆綁咒麼?
You know what a binding spell is?

837
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:43,190
這種法術會阻止魔杖遠離它的主人
It stops it from getting too far away from its owner.

838
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,530
會把魔杖拉回去
Pulls it back.

839
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,900
主人? 魔杖還有主人的?
Owner? Who owns a Wand?

840
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,820
光靈啊
A Bright.

841
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,690
求求你 先生
Please, sir.

842
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,110
告訴我 發生了什麼事
Tell me what happened.

843
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,400
告訴我
Tell me.

844
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,860
一堆警察開槍互相射擊
Cops started shooting at each other,

845
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,900
然後黑人警察殺光了他們
and a black cop killed them all.

846
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:31,440
他帶著一個獸人警察和精靈女孩逃走了
He left with an Orc cop and an Elf girl.

847
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,730
精靈女孩
An Elf?

848
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,440
不要
No! No!

849
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,440
聽著 你要冷靜一點
Okay, you know what? You need to sit your crazy ass down.

850
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,610
我們警局的警員 有一半都守舊得要命
Look, half of our division is on some old-school Rampart shit, a'ight?

851
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,820
他們打算先殺了你 再殺我
They're gonna kill you first, then they're gonna kill me,

852
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,030
然後把魔杖據為己有
they're gonna take the Wand,

853
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,280
然後就要闖下一連串大禍了
and that's when the stupid shit's gonna start.

854
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,280
要是在他們手媮棳潀n的 幫要是魔杖落到幫派分子手
And by the way, that's only if the gangstas don't get it first.

855
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,570
闖下的大禍數量要翻三倍
And that's when the triple stupid shit's gonna start.

856
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:22,400
我們要離開這個區
We gotta get out of this neighborhood.

857
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,480
不行 魔杖會阻止我們 捆綁咒會阻止我們
Yeah, but the Wand is gonna stop us. The binding spell is gonna stop us.

858
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,480
好吧 我們把魔杖藏起來
We'll hide the Wand.

859
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,400
藏在這 然後再回來拿
We'll hide it here and come back and get it.

860
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,110
我不會丟下魔杖
I am not abandoning the Wand.

861
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:36,440
- 我們不是管魔杖的警察
- 你想看到屍橫遍野嗎？
- We are not the fucking Wand police. - You want bodies on the street? Huh?

862
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,820
整個洛杉磯陷入一片火海
All of LA on fire?

863
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,110
這玩意太強悍了 基本上可以實現任何願望
This is like a nuclear weapon that grants wishes.

864
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,570
不行 聯邦調查局
No. The feds have people

865
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,030
有負責處理魔法的探員
that deal with magic.

866
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,940
- 我們聯繫上他們請求他們．．
- 你要去聯繫聯邦探員？　　　
- We call them. We ask... - You wanna call the feds?

867
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,980
我射死了好幾個警員 記得嗎?
I got bodies on my gun, remember?

868
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:53,650
別看我 我還放走了一個獸人呢
Yeah, well, don't look at me, I just let an Orc go.

869
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:54,730
真的? 尼克?
Really, Nick?

870
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,360
真的?
Really?

871
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,280
這只是諷刺而已
That was irony.

872
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,940
　　　　　　　　　　　　　
不是說我真的放走了那個槍手
- No, that's just being an asshole. - Oh.

873
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:03,150
我們可以打給羅德古茲 他是縣治安官 不歸洛杉磯警局管
Gonna call Rodriguez. He's a sheriff, he's not LAPD.

874
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,690
- 他很可靠我們可以相信他
- 這是個好主意　　　　　
- He's solid as fuck. We can trust him. - That's a good idea.

875
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,790
　　　　　　　　
他們要來搶魔杖了
- They're coming for the Wand. - Ah, shit.

876
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,280
- 怎麼了？
- 鎖　　　
- What is it? - The lock.

877
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,610
我們把鎖留在外面地上了 快去
We left the lock outside on the ground. Go.

878
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,200
搭檔 小心!

快點 快走
Come on, let's go!

883
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,320
你有毛病麼
What is your problem?

884
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,230
我把魔杖掉在地上了
Wait! I dropped the Wand.

885
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,900
別碰!
Don't you fucking touch that!

886
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,190
他們去哪了?
Where did they all go?

887
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,690
我們大概在呼吸他們化成的粉末了
I think we're breathing 'em.

888
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,320
- 幫我一個忙
- 嗯？　　　
- Hey, do me a favor. - Uh-huh?

889
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,280
別再亂丟魔杖了
Don't drop that shit no more.

890
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,570
你說啥 不會
What? No.

891
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,110
我怎麼會亂丟?
Why would I?

892
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,190
- 阿爾塔米拉！
- 該死的！　　
- Altamira - Ah, shit! Ah!

893
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,030

我開槍打死了一個人類 你看見了麼

They're not gonna stop. They're gonna keep coming. Let's go.

898

有人派她來殺掉媞卡
She was sent to kill Tikka,

01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,070
沃德和...
Ward and...

926
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:43,940
怎麼? 雅各比
What? Jakoby.

927
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,900
我們在警局見過的那個獸人
The Orc cop we saw at the station.

928
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,110
他們根本不知道媞卡是誰
They have no idea who Tikka is.

929
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,320
已經20年了
It's been 20 years.

930
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,980
什麼已經20年了?
What does that even mean?

931
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:53,860
我追捕莉拉20年了
Twenty years I've been hunting Leilah.

932
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,110
現在她丟了魔杖
Without her Wand...

933
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,150
她很脆弱 我們就有機可乘了
she's vulnerable.

934
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,820
沃德 現在可不是購物的好時候啊
Now's a bad time to go shopping, Ward.

935
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,650
很多人都在追捕兩位警察 我們要換身衣服
Everybody's looking for two cops. We gotta switch it up.

936
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:15,440
說得對
Oh, yeah.

937
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:19,730
闖進霧牙幫的派對 對警民關係可沒什麼幫助
Running through a Fogteeth party is not good community policing.

938
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,820
我們還沒死 而且魔杖還在
Yeah, well, we're alive, and we got the Wand.

939
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,820
我只是說 獸人很記仇的
Orcs hold grudges. That's all I'm saying.

940
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:28,690
這還要你說 跟我來 我們走
Tell me about it. Hey, follow me. Let's go.

941
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,400
媞卡
Tikka.

942
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,980
- 謝謝你女士
- 快走　　　
- Oh, thank you, ma'am. - Go.

943
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,940
- 不錯
- 謝謝
- That's good. - Thank you.

944
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,900
帶上你的女伴 趕快滾吧 快點
Take your old lady, get the fuck outta here. Go. Go.

945
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,030
我要你馬上離開這 明白了麼 快點
I need you to get the fuck outta here. All right? Go.

946
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,110
天哪
Jesus.

947
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,610
右邊有七個拿著砍刀 左邊有五個
Seven dudes with choppers down the right, five down the left.

948
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:52,170
中間有一堆王八蛋
Bunch of motherfuckers in the middle.

949
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,530
沃德警官
Officer Ward...

950
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,190
我覺得 我們該好好談談了
I think we need to talk.

951
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,860
毒男 你過的還好麼
Hey, Poison, how you doing?

952
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,070
今天晚上動靜鬧得很大
Some fucked-up shit went down tonight.

953
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,570
我的兄弟們想要你們的人頭 警察想要你們的人頭
My homies wanna cut your fucking head off, the cops wanna cut your fucking head off,

954
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,860
霧牙幫也想要你們的人頭
the Fogteeth gang wanna cut your fucking head off.

955
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,070
對 我就是有這麼大的魅力
Yeah, I got that effect on people, Poison.

956
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,780
可把我老婆給迷死了
Imagine how my old lady feels.

957
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,030
我嘛 我是想保護你的
Me? I just wanna protect you.

958
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:24,110
讓你安全回家 整件事一筆勾銷
Get you home safe and sound, with all your sins forgiven.

959
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:25,780
但是你得把魔杖給我
But you gotta give me that Wand.

960
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,570
你想做好事麼?
You wanna do the right thing?

961
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:30,110
讓我能用自己的雙腿行走
Help me walk again.

962
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,530
讓我能跟我老婆做愛
Help me make love to my old lady again.

963
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,360
讓我擺脫這個狗屁輪椅
Help me get rid of this shit again.

964
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:40,780
把魔杖給我 否則我會把這棟房子的所有出口封上
Give me the fucking Wand, or I will nail every door in this place shut

965
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,110
然後把這個地方燒成灰燼
and burn this place down to the fucking ground.

966
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:47,980
然後我會從灰燼中撿起魔杖 放聲大笑
And then I will pick up the Wand from the ashes, and I will laugh.

967
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,320
我跟我兄弟商量一下
Chopping it up with the homie for a sec, Poison.

968
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,280
我快沒耐心了 沃德警官
I'm running out of patience, Officer Ward.

969
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:07,320
- 我們把魔杖給他
- 你說什麼？　　
- Let's give this motherfucker the Wand. - What?

970
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,190
聽著 就算我們拉著這堛漫狾酗H給我們陪葬
Look, we gonna get everybody in here killed,

971
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,230
到最後他還是會得到魔杖
and then he's gonna take the damn Wand anyway.

972
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:14,280
我才不會把魔杖給他
I'm not giving that guy the Wand.

973
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,480
讓他到我的屍體上來取魔杖
Over my dead body.

974
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:18,860
他得先殺了我再說
He's gonna have to kill me first.

975
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:21,030
所以你這是願意在槍戰中喪命
So you wanna die in a gunfight

976
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,530
願意死在這個狗屁脫衣舞酒吧?
in a nasty-ass titty bar?

977
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,110
你是想這樣死去麼
That's what you want?

978
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,320
我不想死啊
I don't wanna die anywhere.

979
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,570
我想死 動手吧 我們自尋死路吧 現在就開干
You know what? Now I do. Fuck it. I wanna die. Let's do it right now.

980
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,110
　　　　　　　　　　　　　
我們在脫衣舞酒吧媞j戰至死
We gonna titty-bar-gunfight die.

981
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:34,980
我們馬上動手 準備好了?
Let's do it right here, right now. Ready?

982
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,900
我希望你槍打的准一些
I just wish your dumb ass was a better shot.

983
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,900
- 她說什麼？　　
- 她說惡魔要來了
- What she say? - She says the devil is coming.

984
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:44,070
那個惡魔就在外面 坐在輪椅
The devil's ass is out there in that wheelchair.

985
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,150
- 上吧我數到三就上一．．
- 干死他們　　　　　　　
- Let's go. On three. One... - Let's do it.

986
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,780
- ．．．二．．．三
- 上啊　　　　　　
- ...two... three. - Yeah.

987
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:11,530
他媽的
Oh, shit.

988
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,570
快點 快跑
Go, go, go!

989
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,110
快點!
Go! Go, go, go!

990
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:22,570
讓開!
Move!

991
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,280
　　　
快點！
- Go, go, go! - Go, go, go!

992
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,280
快點!
Hurry!

993
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,570
我們是洛杉磯警察!
LAPD!

994
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,360
- 我的天　　　　
- 她是何方神聖？
- Oh, fuck. Come on! - Who is she?

995
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,110
煉獄黨 她要奪回魔杖
Inferni! She wants her Wand.

996
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:49,690
快走!
Move!

997
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,820
過了今晚 我就當不成警察了吧?
I'm not a cop after tonight, am I?

998
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,440
對 我也一樣
No. Neither am I.

999
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:28,780
我覺得我們還是專注於
I think we should probably spend our time

1000
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,360
- 想辦法活命吧
- 活命？　　　
- just trying to survive this shit. - Survive?

1001
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:36,860
警察就是我的一切
Being a cop is all I've got.

1002
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,780
現在我還算得上一位警察 如果我今晚死了
Right now I'm still a cop, and if I die tonight,

1003
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,820
那我永遠都是警察 我...
I'll be a cop forever. I'll be a...

1004
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,400
我永遠都是英雄
I'll be a hero forever.

1005
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:48,280
整個世界都不在乎你 你怎麼會願意為它送命?
Why the fuck do you wanna die for a world that doesn't give a shit about you?

1006
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:52,480
很久以前 獸人族站錯了邊
Orcs chose the wrong side a long time ago

1007
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:54,440
自那時起我們就一直飽受折磨 為此付出代價
and they've been paying for it ever since.

1008
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,400
獸人們看到我
You know, when an Orc sees me...

1009
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:02,110
他們覺得我是一個想變成人類的獸人
they see a man... a wannabee human.

1010
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:04,820
而人類覺得我是一個野獸
When humans see me, they see an animal.

1011
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,190
他們討厭我
They hate me.

1012
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,440
他們不討厭你啦
They don't hate you.

1013
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:11,480
我們能分辨出人類是喜歡 還是厭惡我們的
We know when people like us and when they don't.

1014
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,820
沃德 就比如你
Like you, Ward.

1015
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,730
你從那房子堨X來的時候 眼睛媞◇〞漱釩
When you came out of that house with pure hatred in your eyes.

1016
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:21,280
純粹的...仇恨
Pure... hatred.

1017
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,610
聽我說 我都跟你談過這個問題了
Look, I told you what that was, all right?

1018
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:34,150
你怎麼不告訴我真相 你就告訴我你是要幫那個獸人孩子啊
Why didn't you tell me the truth about helping the Orc kid?

1019
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,940
我不是說 說出真相就能起到什麼很大的作用
I'm not saying it would've changed...

1020
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:41,230
但也有可能會帶來一些改變啊
anything, but, shit, it might have.

1021
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,530
我糊塗了
I got confused.

1022
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:48,940
人類的世界 一切都黑白分明
And with humans, you understand, everything is so definite.

1023
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,400
就比如 你說一句話 突然就變成法律了
Like, you say something, and all of a sudden it's law,

1024
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,150
駟馬難追
and you can't walk it back.

1025
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:55,480
你得告訴我真相
You gotta tell me...

1026
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,110
因為我是你的搭檔
if I'm supposed to be your partner.

1027
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:01,530
我不管我們對外要怎麼說 但你得告訴我真相
I don't care what we'll say to them, but you gotta tell me the truth.

1028
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,280
你不能騙我啊
You can't lie to me.

1029
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,820
所以我得相信你 但是你可以不信我?
Oh, so I'm supposed to trust you when you don't trust me?

1030
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:10,690
你說的也有道理
That's a good point.

1031
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:18,690
你是個好警察
You're a good cop.

1032
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,230
別人對你不太好 於是
And people are really hard on you, so...

1033
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,440
你也對自己也不太好
you're really hard on yourself.

1034
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:39,940
別這樣 瘋婆子
Come on, crazy.

1035
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:44,070
沃德 你知道麼 你是我的偶像
Ward, do you know that you are who I wish I was?

1036
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:45,730
你無所畏懼
You're fearless.

1037
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:48,400
無論發生什麼 你總是會有對策
You always know what to do.

1038
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:50,400
你今天晚上所做的這些
What you did tonight,

1039
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,900
獸人就是要那樣子才能受血禮
that's what it takes for an Orc to get blooded.

1040
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:56,440
你的舉動充滿勇氣
An act of great bravery.

1041
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,400
對我來說 你就是一個 受了血禮的人類
To me, you're like a blooded human.

1042
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:03,690
我以前也像你這樣
I used to be like you.

1043
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,110
以為自己能拯救所有人 解決所有問題
Think you can save everybody and fix everything and...

1044
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:13,440
現在 我只是假裝自己是個好人
Now I just pretend to be a good dude.

1045
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,940
你真的是個好人
You still are one.

1046
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,730
我們是朋友嗎?
Are we friends?

1047
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,900
不是 尼克 我們不是朋友 夥計
Nah, Nick. We're not friends, man.

1048
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:31,820
你不想要我這種朋友
You don't want me as a friend.

1049
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,230
把你的雙手舉起來 沃德
Show me your fucking hands, Ward.

1050
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,980
羅德古茲 你在幹什麼呢?
Whoa, Rodriguez, what are you doing?

1051
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,780
把你的雙手舉起來
Show me your fucking hands.

1052
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:09,150
- 嘿是我叫你來的　
- 把你的雙手舉起來
- Hey! I called you. - Show me your fucking hands.

1053
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:11,320
- 你也是他們一夥的麼? - 什麼一夥的?- Are you a part of this? - Part of what?

1054
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,530
我聽到對講機上 有人說你殺了一堆警察
All I know is I heard chatter on the radio saying you killed a bunch of cops.

1055
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,150
- 把槍放下聽我說
- 閉嘴　　　　　
- Put your gun down. Listen, the guys... - Shut the fuck up.

1056
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:19,070
- 嘿　　　　
- 你把槍丟掉

1057
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:22,280
- 別動好了冷靜點
- 放下槍　　　　
- Tikka, stop. All right. Relax. - Drop the fucking weapon!

1058
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,530
馬上丟掉
Drop it now!

1059
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:26,320
- 羅德古茲聽我說
- 從槍旁邊走開　
- Rodriguez. Listen to me. - Get away from the gun!

1060
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,400
聽我說!
Listen!

1061
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:32,110
跟我們一個組的警察們 想殺掉我們 拿走魔杖
The guys on our watch tried to do us over a Wand.

1062
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,780
我們手上有魔杖
We have a Wand.

1063
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,480
我們有一根貨真價實的魔杖
We have a Magic Wand.

1064
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:40,440
- 行啊把魔杖給我看
- 別給他看　　　　
- All right, show me the Wand. - Don't show him shit.

1065
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:42,130
- 他會殺掉我們然後據為己有
- 動作慢點　　　　　　　　
- He's gonna shoot us and take it. - Slow.

1066
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,940
雅各比
Jakoby!

1067
01:10:58,650 --> 01:10:59,820
該死的
Shit.

1068
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:06,150
我們首先要確保 那玩意不會落到壞人手
Okay, first thing we gotta do is keep that away from the bad guys.

1069
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,860
- 我要打個電話先放下魔杖
- 行吧　　　　　　　　　
- I'm gonna make a phone call. Put it down. - All right.

1070
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:11,110
- 放下退後
- 羅德古茲
- Put it down. Now step back! - Rodriguez...

1071
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,860
退後 什麼鬼? 她是個精靈?
Step the... God damn it! What the fuck? Is that an Elf?

1072
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:16,060
- 羅德古茲

1074
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,440
- 我們應該這樣做的
- 聽我說　　　　　
- It's what we're supposed to do. - Listen to me.

1075
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:23,610
- 你冷靜點　　　　　　　　　　　　
- 聽我說我們不知道那邊是不是有內鬼
- Chill. Chill. Chill. - Listen. We don't know who's dirty.

1076
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,730
- 羅德古茲掛掉電話
- 你閉嘴　　　　　
- Rodriguez, put the phone down. - Shut the fuck up.

1077
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,000
- 把電話放下．．．
- 等一下　　　　　
- Put the phone do... - Hold on!

1078
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:28,110
你不能告訴他們
Don't tell 'em shit.

1079
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:31,820
有個警官說找到了魔杖
I got a deputy claiming to have the Wand.

1080
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:35,230
對
Yes?

1081
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,860
他們問我們目前在哪
They wanna know where we're at.

1082
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:38,610
把電話給我
Give me the phone.

1083
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,480
把電話給我
Give me the phone.

1084
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,320
你是誰?
Who is this?

1085
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,900
你又是誰呢?
Who's this?

1086
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:46,980
我是他媽的拿著魔杖的人
The motherfucker with the Wand.

1087
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:53,190
是你打給我們的 你在哪?
You called us. Where are you? 

1088
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,480
聽著
All right, look...

1089
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:59,650
魔杖在我手上 我有幾點要求
I got the Wand, but I need something.

1090
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:03,480
- 你要特赦　　　
- 如果我給你魔杖
- You need forgiveness. - If I give you this Wand.

1091
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,360
舉個例子
And let's just say...

1092
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:10,440
可能會有人指證我
I don't know, somebody accused me of, uh, some dumb shit, like...

1093
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,320
說我殺了一堆警察之類的
killing a bunch of cops.

1094
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,820
你這種當官的 應該有辦法解決這種問題吧?
A man like you could fix that shit, right? 

1095
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:20,070
如果你是防止魔法武器 落入某些 比如腐敗分子手中
If you were protecting a weapon of magic from, let's say, corrupt individuals...

1096
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:22,070
當然不會有任何針對你的指控
there would be no charges.

1097
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,860
沒錯 現在就是這種情況
That's exactly what happened.

1098
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,980
我就問你
Hypothetically.

1099
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:27,190
你應該可以擺平那些事吧
A man like you could dead that noise, right? 

1100
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,280
- 女精靈跟你在一起嗎？
- 對　　　　　　　　　
- Do you have the Elf girl? - Yeah.

1101
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,940
- 我們只能把信號範圍縮小至幾個街區內
- 行　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
- Can only narrow it down to a few blocks. - Okay.

1102
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:45,280
來吧 我們走! 出發!
Come on, let's go! Move out! Move out!

1103
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:51,070
- 信號斷掉了
- 該死的　　
- The phone died. - Shit.

1104
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,070
- 好吧聽我說　　
- 不等一下等一下
- All right, look... - Okay. No, hold the... Hold the fuck up.

1105
01:12:56,150 --> 01:12:57,960
- 羅德古茲　　
- 把你搭檔銬上
- Hey, Rodriguez... - Have to cuff your partner.

1106
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,690
- 不用給任何人銬上手銬
- 看起來情況很糟啊　　
- Nobody's handcuffing anybody. - It doesn't look good.

1107
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,650
現場他媽的有一個獸人 然後一堆警察死掉了?
A fucking Orc and a bunch of dead cops?

1108
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:04,730
你這是什麼意思?
All right. What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1109
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,530
夥計 我跟你說實話
I'm just being real with you, man.

1110
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,110
他們認定是雅各比干的
They want it to be Jakoby.

1111
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,650
不管是不是他幹的 他也難逃其咎
Okay? Whether it's him or not.

1112
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,690
如果聯邦探員到了 發現咱們沒把他被銬起來
If he's not cuffed by the time they get here,

1113
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,460
肯定會把你們兩個都斃了
they're gonna smoke both of you motherfuckers.

1114
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,670
- 把他銬起來吧
- 別爭了　　　
- Cuff your partner. - Don't...

1115
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,940
- 沃德沒關係的　
- 別那樣跟我說話
- Ward, it's okay. - Don't reach on me like that.

1116
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:19,480
我們不能就這麼逃下去
We can't run all night.

1117
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,570
就這麼幹吧
Let's do it.

1118
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:25,150
是時候了結這一切了
It's time to end this.

1119
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:26,320
給我銬上吧
Let's go in.

1120
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:31,780
把我的槍拿走
Take my gun.

1121
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,440
轉過身去
Turn around.

1122
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,570
嘿 沃德
Hey, Ward...

1123
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:39,480
我不能坐牢
I can't go to prison.

1124
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:41,570
他們會把我的皮都給扒了
They'll skin me alive.

1125
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,320
你不會坐牢的 你是清白的
You're not going to jail. You didn't do shit.

1126
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:45,780
那些人都是我殺的
I shot everybody.

1127
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:48,320
沃德 閉嘴吧你 找個律師
Ward, shut the fuck up and lawyer up.

1128
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,570
進去!...快點!
Get inside! Get inside! Go!

1129
01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:00,110
媽的 那是什麼情況?
Shit. What was that?

1130
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:04,230
好女孩 幫我把鎖打開 你有看到什麼嗎?
Good girl. Let me out. Let me out. You see anything?

1131
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,230
- 不什麼都沒看到　
- 先生請離窗戶遠點
- No, I can't see anything. - Sir, get away from that window!

1132
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:12,110
糟了 快跑
Oh, shit! Move! Come on!

1133
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,280
叛徒
Traitor.

1134
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:37,650
該死的
Oh, shit, shit.

1135
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:53,730
拉我出去
Get me out. Get me out.

1136
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,030
拉我出去!
Get me out!

1137
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:31,070
我的天
Oh, God.

1138
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:35,780
該死的
Oh, shit.

1139
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:41,320
我就說嘛 獸人會記仇
I told you Orcs hold grudges. Huh? What'd I say?

1140
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,230
聽著 你們魯莽駕駛 今天放你們一馬
All right, look. I'm gonna cut you a break on the reckless driving.

1141
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,900
你們現在回到車上 安全開回家
But I need you to return to your vehicles and drive home safely.

1142
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:52,030
我要你趕緊扭著你的那個丑屁股
So I need you to take your fat Shrek-looking ass

1143
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:56,280
坐回車子 開車回家找你老婆
back to your vehicle and drive the fuck home to Fiona. A'ight?

1144
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,360
- 你想要坐牢嗎？
- 找老婆　　　　
- Do you wanna go to jail? - Fiona?

1145
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:00,980
用獸人語跟這幫混蛋講
Tell these dickheads in Orkish

1146
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,610
叫他們滾回車上 開車回家
to get the fuck back in their vehicles and drive home,

1147
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:08,230
- 否則全部都要坐牢　　　　　　
- 但是．．．他們都聽得懂英語啊
- or they're all going to jail. - But... they speak English.

1148
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:11,860
你們聽得懂吧? 會講英語吧?
But... You understand, right? Speak English?

1149
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,580
是啊 當然
Yeah. Of course.

把他帶去教堂
Take 'em to the church!

1151

You know...

1152
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,440
我不是來自這堛
I'm not from here.

1153
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:47,980
我在邁阿密長大
I grew up in Miami.

1154
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:52,610
那堛疑~人社區很不錯 很強大
Great Orc communities there, strong Orc communities.

1155
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:55,780
我們會跟矮人和人類一起 在街上搞派對
We'd have block parties with dwarves and humans.

1156
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:58,440
很好玩的 夥計
It was fucking fun, man.

1157
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,400
我當時沒上黑道
I wasn't in the game then.

1158
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:04,980
我當時是個公交車司機

1159

然後我搬到洛杉磯

1161
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,320
聽著 我跟你說話的時候
Listen, I would really appreciate it

1162
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,080
你得看著我 這是基本的尊重
if you gave me the respect of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

1163
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,110
我來到這 看到的是腐敗的官僚系統
I get here and I see how broke the system is.

1164
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:24,440
獸人們牽扯在警察和黑幫之間
Orcs caught between the police and the gangsters.

1165
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:26,650

01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,530

1173
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,320
讓大家喝醉吃飽
Get everyone drunk, feed 'em.

1174
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,690
不分種族
All races...

1175
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:54,570
所有人一起玩 只有一個規則
partying together, with one rule.

1176
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,320
不能帶槍
No guns.

1177
01:18:59,190 --> 01:19:00,860
這麼多年 都相安無事
After years of peace...

1178
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,230
誰壞了規矩 把槍帶進來了?
who brings in the guns?

1179
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:07,150
是我們
We did, yeah.

1180
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:09,530
- 來惹禍的是誰？
- 是我們　　　　
- The drama? - Us.

1181
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,110
踐踏我們慶典的是誰?
Disrespects our celebration?

1182
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,030

根本就沒有魔杖!
There's no Wand!

1219
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:54,480
只是貧民窟的傳說而已
Ghetto Fairy tales.

1220
01:21:58,780 --> 01:21:59,820
把那個精靈女人帶來

1221
01:22:06,190 --> 01:22:08,900
我會讓她的鮮血濺你一臉

殺掉他們
Kill them!

1228
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,440
看著他們死吧 精靈
Watch your friends die, Elf.

1229

你沒有屈服
You didn't break.

1230

你應該接受血禮的
You deserve to be blooded.

1231

你在猶豫什麼?
Why are you waiting?

1237
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,980
爸爸 我認得他
Father... I know him.

1238
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:09,940

1252
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:59,610
沃德?

沒什麼 怎麼了?
Uh... Nothing. Why?

1255
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,820
肯定有事發生了 我感覺好極了

你他媽的是光靈
You're a fucking Bright?

1259
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:38,820
要是我們之前被圍住的時候 就告訴我們 那多好
Would've been nice to know that when we was getting fucked up.

1260
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,940
可以用魔法變一台直升機 然後逃走
Could've had a magic helicopter take us somewhere.

1261
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:44,150
我的訓練剛剛開始
I only started my training.

1262
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,320
我只認識幾個咒語而已

1263
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,780
她英語說的也很流利了

1264
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,320
- 現在我相信你了
- Now I trust you. - Um...

1265
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:55,690
你要給我們一點福利啊
You gonna need to unfuck this, okay?

1266
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:59,110
比如把我們送去泡溫泉之類的
A'ight? You gonna magic us to Palm Springs or some shit.

1267
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,110
我救了你朋友一命
I saved your friend's life.

1268
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,650
那還不夠嗎?
Isn't that enough?

1269
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,360
這只是個開始 但是...
It's a start, but...

1270
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,320
沃德 打住 有件事我覺得很重要

謝謝你
Thank you.

1272
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:17,280
媞卡 獵捕我們那些精靈 他們到底是誰?
Now, Tikka, who are these Elves who are hunting us?

1273
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:20,570
他們要幫助魔君回歸...
They're aiding the return of the Dark Lord...

1274
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,150
他會塗炭生靈
so he can slaughter billions

1275
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:27,980
奴役倖存者 服侍他 迎來新的魔法紀元
and enslave the survivors to serve him in a new age of magic.

1276
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:29,900
就這樣?
Oh. That's all.

1277
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:32,360
都是一些光明會說的屁話
Just some Illuminati shit.

1278
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,610
他們是煉獄黨的
They're Inferni.

1279
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:36,860
一百年前他們就把光明會給摧毀了
They destroyed the Illuminati a hundred years ago.

1280
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:38,230
你怎麼知道這些的?
How do you know all this?

1281
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,610
我也是煉獄黨的

1282
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:45,150
但是我逃走了
But I escaped.

1283
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:49,030
光明之盾把我藏起來
The Shield of Light hid me.

1284
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:53,070
莉拉把她的魔杖借給一個刺客 派她來殺我
Leilah gave an assassin her Wand to kill me.

1285
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:02,360
但是我從她手媟m走了魔杖
But I got the Wand from her.

1286
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:08,570
讓魔杖離莉拉遠點
Keep it away from Leilah.

1287
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,730
千萬不能讓她拿回魔杖
She mustn't get her Wand back.

1288
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:15,030
莉拉能讓魔君恢復力量
With it, she can restore the Dark Lord to power.

1289
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:17,530
那是什麼? 你臉上黑黑的是什麼東西?
Hey, what is that? What's the shit? What's the black stuff?

1290
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:20,940
聽著...
Hey. Look... All right.

1291
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:25,030
　　　　　　　　　　　　
好吧等一下你別就這麼死了
All right, hey, look, don't-don't-don't check out on us.

1292
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:29,820
別讓她拿到 別讓莉拉拿到魔杖
Keep it away from her. Keep the Wand away from Leilah.

1293
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,610
- 答應我　
- 我答應你
- Promise me. - Yes.

1294
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:34,770
她需要醫生 我們要送她去急救室
All right. She needs medical attention. We gotta get her to an emergency room.

1295
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,860
但怎麼去?
But how?

1296
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:40,780
行了 走吧
Got it. Let's go!

1297
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,360
快點
Go, go!

1298
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,690
我們不會讓你死的
We won't let you die.

1299
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,690
我們要怎麼救你
How do we save you?

1300
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:52,480
只有光明之盾能救我
Only the Shield of Light can help me.

1301
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:54,400
他們在哪?
Where are they?

1302
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,110
在家
Home.

1303
01:29:57,150 --> 01:29:59,150
- 家　　　　　
- 家？家在哪？
- Home. - Home? Where's home?

1304
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,440
亞布罕街那?
Wait, home. Uh... the Abrams' house?

1305
01:30:03,230 --> 01:30:04,730
那堛漱H全死了
Everybody was dead there.

1306
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,400
那埵陪茪籉
There's a pool.

1307
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:13,690
水池互相連結
The pools are... connected like...

1308
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:17,730
就像聖樹的根
the roots of a holy tree.

1309
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:22,780
沃德 她撐不住了 我們得送她回去
Ward, she's dying. We have to take her back to where we found her.

1310
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,940
- 我們不能去那個房子
- 我們別無選擇　　　
- No. We are not going back to that house. - Yes.

1311
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:27,690
我們得去醫院 那埵麻憟
We're gonna get to the hospital. There's doctors there.

1312
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:30,320
我們要把她和魔杖交給聯邦探員
We're gonna turn her and the Wand over to the feds.

1313
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,030
- 沃德　　　　　　　　　
- 我要讓我的人生回到正軌
- Ward. Ward. - I want my life back.

1314
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:35,860
她讓我死而復生
She brought me back from the dead.

1315
01:30:35,940 --> 01:30:38,440
你別跟我談這個
Hey, don't kook out on me right now, all right?

1316
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:40,610
我們還不知道當時究竟發生了什麼
We don't know exactly what happened.

1317
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:42,320
你得接受這個奇跡
You have to accept the miracle.

1318
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,650
- 我們不能回那個房子　　　
- 我們兩個．．．都是普通人
- We're not going back to that house. - You and me are simple people.

1319
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:48,360
沒什麼特別的
We mean nothing.

1320
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:50,360
沒有人會歌頌我們
People don't write about us.

1321
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,610
但你不明白麼 現在就像英雄時代一樣
But this, don't you see, is like a time of heroes?

1322
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:57,690
吉拉克跟我一樣 也是個沒受血禮的獸人
Jirak was unblooded like me.

1323
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:00,190
沒人正眼看他
An Orc that nobody cared about.

1324
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:01,900
他...
He...

1325
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:07,400
他一統了九族大軍 擊敗魔君
He united the Nine Armies, and they defeated the Dark Lord. He...

1326
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:11,150
他是農民 卻改變了世界
He was a farmer who changed the world.

1327
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,820
人們對他兵刃相向
They raised their blades to him.

1328
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:17,860
在那個瞬間 他就受了血禮
He was blooded in that very moment.

1329
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:21,110
他實現了偉大預言 沃德
He fulfilled a great Prophecy, Ward.

1330
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,820
我們可能也身處預言之中
I think we might be in a Prophecy.

1331
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,650
- 我們並沒有身處預言之中
- 你怎麼知道？　　　　　
- We're not in a Prophecy, all right? - How do you know?

1332
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:31,440
我們現在明明是身處一台偷來的豐田車
We're in a stolen Toyota Corolla.

1333
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:34,280
- 不　　　　　　　　
- 好嗎？你看我的表情
- No. - Okay? Look at my face.

1334
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:37,900
這個不是什麼「身處預言之中」的表情
All right? This is not a Prophecy face.

1335
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:40,480
而是"這天晚上糟透了"的表情
This is a bad-night face.

1336
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:43,280
行嗎? 我們要送她去醫院
Okay? And we're gonna get to the hospital,

1337
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,980
聯邦探員會解決這一切的
and the feds are gonna put an end to it.

1338
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:48,230
你給我閉嘴 沃德 聽我說
Shut the fuck up, Ward, and listen to me.

1339
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,780
我們要回去
We have to go back.

1340
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,650
我們前途一片迷茫
There's nothing ahead of us.

1341
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:11,110
我的天 這些是聯邦探員的屍體啊
Ah, man. These guys are feds.

1342
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:12,570
該死的
Oh, shit.

1343
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:44,650
我拿了把大傢伙
I get the big gun.

1344
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:51,730
我可不介意用這種大傢伙
I didn't mind having the big gun.

1345
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:15,110
那個...那是個炸彈
That... That's a bomb.

1346
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:16,190
沒錯
Yes, it is.

1347
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:19,320
- 你要我拿著？
- 沒錯　　　　
- You want me to hold it? - Yes, I do.

1348
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,110
為什麼?
W... Why?

1349
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:22,780
以防萬一
You never know.

1350
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:34,440
我坐在您跟前 黑暗之王
I sit before you, Lord of Darkness.

1351
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:38,570
侍奉您是我的榮幸
Serving your will is my honor.

1352
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:41,730
我會讓您回到這個世界
I will return you to this world.

1353
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:46,280
他們來了!那邊!在牆壁!
They're coming! There! In the wall!

1354
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,480
射穿牆壁!
Shoot through the wall!

1355
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:52,900
沃德!
Ward!

1356
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:11,280
尼克!
Nick!

1357
01:34:17,030 --> 01:34:18,480
快走!
Nick! Let's go!

1358
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:20,940
雅各比
Jakoby!

1359
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,530
我把炸彈給她了
I gave her the bomb.

1360
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,280
以防萬一嘛
You never know.

1361
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:38,730
往左劃
Swipe left.

1362
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,570
糟了
Oh, shit.

1363
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:45,980
開槍射她!
Shoot her!

1364
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:49,780
開槍射她!
Shoot her!

1365
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:51,780
尼克 開槍打她
Nick, will you please shoot her!

1366
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:53,230
開槍! 開槍打她
Shoot! Shoot her!

1367
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:13,280
幹得漂亮
Good work.

1368
01:36:31,690 --> 01:36:35,780
水 把我放在水
The water. Put me in the water.

1369
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:39,400
嘿 行了 接下來的交給我
Hey. You're done. I got it from here.

1370
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:22,900
現在要怎麼辦?
So what now?

1371
01:37:24,610 --> 01:37:26,150
要有信念
Have faith.

1372
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:41,110
她來了
She's coming.

1373
01:37:45,070 --> 01:37:46,070
尼克!
Nick!

1374
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:43,070
你到底是什麼東西?
The hell are you?

1375
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:44,980
我是位戰士
I'm a warrior.

1376
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:47,480
是女祭司 也是愛人
A priestess, a lover.

1377
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:51,190
我的君王要什麼 我就是什麼
I am whatever my Lord needs me to be.

1378
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,110
回來吧
Come home.

1379
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:04,070
請你回來
Please, come home.

1380
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:07,440
我不能回去
I can't go back.

1381
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:11,280
跟我一起進入夢境吧
Dream with me again.

1382
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:16,150
你所愛的一切 都是破敗不堪的
What you love is broken, rotten.

1383
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:23,230
這個人類和那個獸人
This man and the Orc...

1384
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:26,360
他們對你而言 有什麼意義?
...what are they to you?

1385
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,690
- 他們是好人
- 不　　　　
- They're good. - No.

1386
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:43,150
是時候回家了
It's time to come home.

1387
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:46,610
是時候回家了
It's time to come home.

1388
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:50,940
- 太遲了我不能回家
- 是時候醒來了　　
- It's too late. I can't come home. - It's time to wake up.

1389
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,530
別再說了 快殺了我!
So just shut up and kill me.

1390
01:40:01,610 --> 01:40:03,530
別再說了 快殺了我!
Just shut up and kill me!

1391
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:06,030
- 你本性並非如此！
- 別說了快殺了我！
- This is not you! - Shut up and kill me!

1392
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:08,940
你本性並非如此! 都是你幹的
This is not you! This is you!

1393
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:12,400
你對我妹妹做了什麼?
What have you done to my sister?

1394
01:40:12,980 --> 01:40:16,320
你對她做了什麼?
What have you done to her? What did you do?

1395
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:27,530
該死的
Shit.

1396
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:31,570
尼克 如果你瞄準的是魔杖 那你射得很好
Nick, if you were aiming at the Wand, that was a really good shot.

1397
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:33,480
但你要射她的頭!
But shoot her in her head!

1398
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:35,690
這樣嗎?
Like this?

1399
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:40,110
完了
I can't.

1400
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:42,440
沒子彈了
I'm out.

1401
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:49,780
不!
No!

1402
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:51,820
你不是光靈
You're not a Bright.

1403
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,940
你敢碰我的魔杖
You touch my Wand...

1404
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,980
它會把你炸成碎片
and it will splatter you all over the walls.

1405
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,820
我覺得這樣挺好的
I think that's kind of the plan.

1406
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:04,360
咱們一起死
Think I'mma just kill us all.

1407
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:12,570
沃德
Ward...

1408
01:41:13,230 --> 01:41:14,610
我覺得還是別那樣吧
I wouldn't do that.

1409
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:16,190
沒事的
It's all right.

1410
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:19,070
我們不是身處預言之中麼
We're in a Prophecy, right?

1411
01:41:31,230 --> 01:41:32,900
這不可能
This is impossible.

1412
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:38,940
尼克 我拿到魔杖了
Hey, Nick, I got the Wand.

1413
01:41:39,110 --> 01:41:40,400
現在怎麼辦?
Um, what now?

1414
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:44,030
也許...也許你是個光靈 沃德
Maybe you're a... You're a Bright, Ward.

1415
01:41:46,190 --> 01:41:47,230
使用魔杖啊!
Use it!

1416
01:41:47,610 --> 01:41:48,860
真是個好主意
Oh, good idea.

1417
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:51,110
把魔杖給我...
Give it to me...

1418
01:41:54,530 --> 01:41:56,030
否則我就殺了她
or she dies.

1419
01:41:56,780 --> 01:41:58,400
Vykwarus.

1420
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,110
那是攻擊的咒語
The war word is Vykwarus.

1421
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,780
Vykwarus!

1422
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:13,230
堶惘野靈
We got a Bright in there!

1423
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:25,610
媞卡!
Tikka. Tikka.

1424
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:30,690
- 媞卡！　　
- 沃德沒事了
- Tikka! - Ward! It's okay.

1425
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,690
- 她．．．她滾進去了
- 別急沃德　　　　　
- She just... She rolled in. - Come on, Ward!

1426
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:35,070
- 她消失了沒事的
- 我不想傷害她的
- She's gone. It's okay. - I didn't hurt her.

1427
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:37,940
- 媞卡！　　　　
- 沃德媞卡沒事的
- Tikka! - Ward, Tikka's okay.

1428
01:42:38,190 --> 01:42:39,190
她消失了
She's gone.

1429
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,280
- 媞卡！　　　　　　
- 沃德想想你的女兒吧
- Tikka! - Ward, think of Sophia.

1430
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,360
走吧 沃德
Come on, Ward!

1431
01:42:58,820 --> 01:42:59,820
獸人!
Orc!

1432
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:01,900
別開槍
Stand down.

1433
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,570
別開槍
Stand down.

1434
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:04,780
沃德!
Ward!

1435
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:08,230
沃德!
Ward!

1436
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,110
不要!
No!

1437
01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:12,190
達瑞!
Daryl!

1438
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:14,230
你現在安全了
You're safe now.

1439
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:17,150
沃德!
Ward!

1440
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:24,070
達瑞!
Daryl!

1441
01:43:28,610 --> 01:43:30,360
沃德!
Ward!

1442
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:32,530
沃德!
Ward!

1443
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,860
我把你救出來了!
I know. I gotcha.

1444
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:07,400
救出來了
Got him!

1445
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:10,030
沃德!我們沒事了!
Ward! We made it!

1446
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:11,610
我們出來了
We got out!

1447
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:14,690
你沒事了
I got you. You're okay.

1448
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:16,360
你還好嗎?
Are you okay?

1449
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:18,400
快呼吸 沃德
Breathe, Ward.

1450
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:20,900
說句話
Say something.

1451
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:27,940
尼克 你看
Nick... look.

1452
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:15,190
你還不是我的朋友
Still not my friend.

1453
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:22,570
我也不怎麼喜歡你
I never really liked you anyway.

1454
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:26,940
現在你受了血禮 就以為自己很了不起哦
Think you're a big dog now you're blooded, huh?

1455
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:29,320
對 我是挺了不起的
Yeah, pretty big.

1456
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:32,730
尼克
Hey, Nick.

1457
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:34,780
怎麼了
Yeah.

1458
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:36,940
去他媽的魔法
Fuck magic.

1459
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:42,070
我還是覺得有點酷啦
Well, I don't know. I still think it's kinda cool.

1460
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:47,360
你們怎樣?
How you doing, fellas?

1461
01:45:47,860 --> 01:45:49,820
- 還好嗎？
- 嘿　　　
- Good? - Hey.

1462
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:53,440
尼克 消防員來了
Nick, the firemen are here.

1463
01:45:53,530 --> 01:45:56,190
- 我們該去當消防員的
- 對　　　　　　　　
- We should've been firemen. - Yeah.

1464
01:45:56,730 --> 01:45:59,440
能給我片止痛藥嗎?
Hey, can I get a aspirin?

1465
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:27,280
嘿 氏族兄弟
Hey, Clan Blood.

1466
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:28,980
達瑞
Daryl.

1467
01:46:29,730 --> 01:46:31,110
達瑞
Oh, Daryl.

1468
01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:32,900
你感覺如何?
How are you feeling?

1469
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:35,190
還好嗎?
You feeling okay?

1470
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,400
好吧
Uh, yeah.

1471
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,190
好 我看懂了你的表情
Okay, I get it.

1472
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:45,860
糟了
Oh, shit.

1473
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:47,570
那可不太妙
Well, that can't be good.

1474
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:48,780
是啊
Yeah.

1475
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,860
怎麼沒把你銬起來?
Why you not locked up?

1476
01:46:51,650 --> 01:46:54,780
他們好像覺得你比我更危險
I think they think you're more dangerous than me.

1477
01:46:57,150 --> 01:46:58,150
嘿
Hey.

1478
01:47:00,230 --> 01:47:02,570
你什麼都別說
Don't say shit.

1479
01:47:16,730 --> 01:47:19,650
　　　　　　　　　　　
長官我們只是執行任務已
- Sir, we were just responding to a call. - Mmm.

1480
01:47:19,730 --> 01:47:23,150
我跟我搭檔 我們... 到處都是什麼魔法的玩意
My partner and I, we... But there was all this crazy magic stuff.

1481
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:25,230
我是說 布朗和希克斯
I mean, everything that happened with Brown...

1482
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:27,610
　　　　　　　　　　　　
還有伯拉德和程他們．．．
- Hey, hey, hey. - ...and Hicks and Pollard and Ching...

1483
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:30,190
- 他們要沃德警官殺我
- 嘿尼克　　　　　　
- They wanted Officer Ward to shoot me. - Hey. Nick.

1484
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:34,150
他們要沃德殺我 然後偷走魔杖 知道麼?
They wanted to him to kill me so they could get the Wand, remember?

1485
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:36,480
他不願意那樣做 因為他是好人
And he wouldn't do it 'cause he's a stand-up guy.

1486
01:47:36,570 --> 01:47:39,320
然後 他們說要殺我
He wouldn't do it. But then they said they would kill me, so he...

1487
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:40,900
於是他只好採取行動
he had to take action,

1488
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:43,610
- 開槍了　　　　　　　　
- 不對我印象中不是這樣的
- like, with his gun, right? - No. That's not my recollection.

1489
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:45,480
尼克 你怎麼...
Hey, Nick, why don't you just...

1490
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:46,610
你等一下
If you hold up a second...

1491
01:47:46,690 --> 01:47:49,150
- 怎樣？　　
- 等他們提問
- What? - ...they'll ask us questions.

1492
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:51,900
事實就是這樣的 我發誓 我們只是執行任務而已
It's what happened, I swear to God. We just returned to the call.

1493
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:55,690
但是這起事件中牽涉到的力量 超乎我們的想像
But there are forces at play that are beyond.

1494
01:47:55,780 --> 01:47:57,650
- 有個精靈女人
- 尼克　　　　
- There was, uh, an Elf woman. - Hey, Nick.

1495
01:47:57,730 --> 01:47:59,280
她是魔杖的主人 對吧?
She owned the Wand. Right?

1496
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,650
她肯定是魔杖的主人 是個壞人 很會打扮 跟你一樣
It must've been hers. Not a nice lady. Dressed very well, but... Like you.

1497
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:05,070
但她真的糟透了 她...
But she was a terrible woman. She...

1498
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:07,530
- 她服侍魔君
- 尼克．．．
- Uh, she served the Dark Lord. - Nick...

1499
01:48:07,610 --> 01:48:08,690
- 我敢肯定　　
- 讓他們．．．
- I know it. - Let them...

1500
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:11,110
- 讓他們提問　
- 他們必須知道
- Let them ask us questions. - They need to know this.

1501
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:13,480
- 他提問我們回答
- 然後有個天使　
- Let him ask us questions. - There was an Angel.

1502
01:48:13,570 --> 01:48:16,320
然後黑幫的人就開始追我們
All right. That was then when the gangsters were chasing us.

1503
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,440
- 情況不是這樣的
- 她叫媞卡　　　
- Uh, the context is a little off. - Tikka.

1504
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:21,480
媞卡
Oh, Tikka.

1505
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:24,400
很可憐 她是個年輕的光靈
So sad. Tikka... Tikka was a young Bright.

1506
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,860
她...
She... She... She...

1507
01:48:26,230 --> 01:48:29,610
她用魔杖救了我
She... She used the Wand and she saved my life.

1508
01:48:29,730 --> 01:48:34,860
我...我的靈魂脫離了身體 然後她讓我復活
I was... My soul was leaving my body, and she brought me back.

1509
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:38,110
沃德警官?
Officer Ward?

1510
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,730
我們接到報警電話 便出警 進行調查
We responded to a 415 disturbance call.

1511
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:45,570
我們接近那住宅之後 發現那是一個...
Uh, upon approaching the residence, we realized that it was a safe house

1512
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:48,860
- 極端分子的窩點　　　
- 現場有很多奇怪的玩意
- for an extremist group. - Full of weird...

1513
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,860
我們隨即遭遇襲擊
We immediately took fire,

1514
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:53,820
於是請求增援
uh, at which point we called for backup.

1515
01:48:54,230 --> 01:48:56,780
然後...不幸地...
And... unfortunately...

1516
01:48:57,320 --> 01:49:01,780
- 有警員在槍戰中遇害
- 我沒看過那種槍法　
- officers were killed in the exchange. - I've never seen shooting like it.

1517
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:03,820
他轉過身 都沒瞄準
He turned around, sight unseen,

1518
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:06,940
連開四槍 四個人應聲倒地
four of them, bang, bang, bang, bang. Dropped...

1519
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:09,400
就好像是一顆子彈把他們四個都打死了
like it was one bullet.

1520
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:10,860
不好意思 請繼續
Sorry, keep going.

1521
01:49:12,230 --> 01:49:14,480
緊接著黑幫成員到場
Gangsters showed up,

1522
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:17,780
然後情況急轉直下
and it just went really sideways from that point.

1523
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:19,900
如果你們聯邦探員沒出現...
And had you guys not shown up...

1524
01:49:20,530 --> 01:49:23,730
那後果不堪設想
it would've... it would've been really bad.

1525
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:26,900
所以你們是真正的英雄
Uh, so the real heroes in this are you guys.

1526
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,070
我們得謝謝你們
So we wanna say thank you.

1527
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:32,820
尼克 快謝謝這些聯邦探員們
Nick, thank the nice federal agents.

1528
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:35,650
謝謝你們
Thank you.

1529
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:40,070
所以 我明確表示
So, let me say, unequivocally...

1530
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:45,030
根本沒有魔杖
there was no Wand.

1531
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,150
也沒有什麼魔法
And there was no magic.

1532
01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:51,360
只是兩個巡警
Just a couple of street cops...

1533
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:53,860
做好本職工作而已
doing our job.

1534
01:49:55,610 --> 01:49:57,610
我明白這是什麼情況了
Oh, I know what this is.

1535
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:00,440
所以情況就是這樣麼
Then that's what happened?

1536
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:03,190
是的 長官 就是這樣
Yes, sir. That's exactly what happened.

1537
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:04,690
你也是這麼覺得的吧
Yes?

1538
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:06,320
對 我同意他的說法
No, I'm with him.

1539
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:10,150
我在此明確表態了
Unequivocally.

1540
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:14,650
面對著沉迷於遠古傳說的恐怖分子
Faced with armed terrorists obsessed with myths from thousands of years ago,

1541
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:17,190
兩位警員與持槍歹徒英勇作戰
two of our officers held the line.

1542
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:21,030
我真不想看到那些混蛋的照片跟羅德古茲放在一起
I hate seeing those scumbags up there with Rodriguez.

1543
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:23,070
算了 沃德
Let it go, Ward.

1544
01:50:24,030 --> 01:50:27,320
我們心堛器D就行 那就夠了
We know, okay? That's enough.

1545
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:32,280
達瑞·沃德警官 還有全國首位獸人警官 尼可拉斯·雅各比
Officer Daryl Ward, and our nation's first Orkish police officer, Nicholas Jakoby.

1546
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:35,280
雅各比警官
Officer Jakoby.

1547
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:47,570
恭喜沃德警官
Congratulations, Ward.
