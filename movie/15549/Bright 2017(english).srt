1
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,875
I have a message
from the Shield of Light.

2
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,041
Remember the old ways.

3
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,000
Remember what you are.

4
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,750
Remember your traditions.

5
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,541
Only clan ways can save you.

6
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,166
The Prophecy has chosen you.

7
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,625
The man with you is blessed.

8
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,416
Police! Stop!

9
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,541
Please protect me.

10
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,416
Please protect me and the Wand.

11
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:12,041
Can you tell me your name?

12
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,625
My name is Tikka.

13
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,291
We have to leave before she comes.

14
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,541
Before who comes?

15
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,666
Jakoby?
Jakoby, who are these people?

16
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,083
Keep the Wand safe!

17
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,083
Keep the Wand safe!

18
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,875
Protect the Wand.

19
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:20,416
We have to turn back.
Stop the car. Inferni!

20
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,333
-Inferni! Inferni!

21
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,791
She won't let it go!

22
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:07,125
Leilah. The traitor escaped.

23
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:14,333
She has your Wand.

24
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:03,666
Please, sir.

25
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:17,083
Tell me what happened.

26
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,375
-Tell me.

27
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,833
Cops started shooting at each other,

28
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:27,875
and a black cop killed them all.

29
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,416
He left with an Orc cop and an Elf girl.

30
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,708
-An Elf?

31
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,708
They're coming for the Wand.

32
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,083
Inferni! She wants her Wand.

33
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:07,250
Traitor.

34
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:21,416
An unblooded Orc.

35
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:26,458
Grew up with humans. Never had a hand
raised for him in respect.

36
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:32,416
Playing the nice guy.

37
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:52,416
Where is the Wand?

38
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,166
Roundtooth.

39
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,416
False Orc.

40
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:02,625
Unblooded coward.

41
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:07,666
Where is the Wand?

42
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,833
What-- What Wand?

44
01:22:34,791 --> 01:22:35,958
Kill them!

45
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:57,125
Why are you waiting?

46
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,958
Father... I know him.

47
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,916
He helped me escape from the police.

48
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:28,583
This is a Prophecy, for he has risen.

49
01:33:30,208 --> 01:33:34,416
I sit before you, Lord of Darkness.

50
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:38,541
Serving your will is my honor.

51
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,708
I will return you to this world.

52
01:38:58,458 --> 01:39:00,083
Come home.

53
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:04,041
Please, come home.

54
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:07,416
I can't go back.

55
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:11,250
Dream with me again.

56
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:16,125
What you love is broken, rotten.

57
01:39:58,333 --> 01:40:01,500
So just shut up and kill me.
