1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500


3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,750
...

4
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,583
...

5
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:23,708
My name is Steve, and as
a child, I yearn for the mines.

6
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:27,583
...

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,625
But it didn't really work out.

8
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,333
Go on, get out of here!

9
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,041
So I did a terrible thing.

10
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,375
I grew up.

11
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,541
And just as I
expected, it was a massive bummer.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,250
Hey Steve, your
presentation's in five minutes.

13
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,041
...

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,750
Welcome to Steve's
Ultimate Resort Condominium.

15
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,833
Dubs are in the leg, tennis in the back.

16
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,291
Every room has the
koozie and a mini-ball.

17
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,000
Welcome to Steve's!

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,333
Welcome to Steve's!

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,583
I really put myself out
there, and it totally blew up in my face.

20
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,625
It was the kind of life that
made a man stare into his potatoes.

21
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,125
And then I remembered.

22
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,583
I couldn't give up on my dream.

23
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,041
Not yet.

24
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:34,583
The mines!

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,333
So I bought a pickaxe and a sweet
helmet, and this time, I was unstoppable.

26
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:51,833
...

27
00:02:51,833 --> 00:03:03,000
Turns out my
adventure was just beginning.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,541
I mined my brains out, until
I found two mysterious artifacts.

29
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:14,166
This thingy, and that cool thingy.

30
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:20,791
And when I put those two
thingies together, you guessed it!

31
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,000
It opened a portal to another world.

32
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:26,500
...

33
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,958
The Overworld!

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,458
...

35
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,708
This place blew my mind.

36
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:41,125
...

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,958
I'd never seen anything like it.

38
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,083
...

39
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:52,208
Turns out it was the place
I'd been looking for my whole life.

40
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,291
A world where anything
you can imagine, you can create.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,958
This is my first house.

42
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:05,375
My second house, and my third
house made entirely of sheep's wool.

43
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,500
Big house!

44
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,875
Life was good.

45
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,333
The only thing missing
was a friend to share it with.

46
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,500
And then this super angry wolf showed up.

47
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,375
So I tamed him with a crusty femur bone.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,666
Yeah!

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,250
What?

50
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,375
Ah, boy!

51
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,833
Dennis, he like a
scratchy scratch on a not ease.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,916
With him by my
side, my confidence soared.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,333
Woohoo!

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,250
Together we built endless masterpieces.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,166
The more I built, the better I got.

56
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,416
Dennis, check it out!

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,958
Welcome to Steve!

58
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:56,000
...

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,666
Turns out pandas love to party.

60
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,375
And cows!

61
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,458
...

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,041
Life was perfect.

63
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,875
And the years simply flew by.

64
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,541
Until one day I came
across some strange ruins.

65
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,875
Flint and Steve!

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,458
...

67
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:35,625
Dennis!

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,250
...

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,666
Turns out we just opened a
portal to a totally new dimension.

70
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,208
The Nether.

71
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,458
There was no joy or creativity at all.

72
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,000
...

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,416
Dennis!

74
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:04,000
These piglet brutes had
mined this realm into oblivion.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,166
Led by Mount Gosha, the evil
piglet sorceress who ruled the place.

76
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,958
Who are you and why are you so round?

77
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,291
Leave the dark!

78
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,333
Take me instead.

79
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,416
No, thanks. I'll
take both of you and that orb.

80
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,208
Let's get one thing straight.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,750
Where I come from, we call this cube.

82
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,625
Leave them!

83
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,000
Mount Gosha had finally
got what she'd always wanted.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,750
The orb of dominance.

85
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,250
The most powerful
cube-shaped orb in the entire universe.

86
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,916
Listen up, you pigs!

87
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:42,333
With this orb, I will pillage the
overworld and all of its gold will be ours!

88
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:43,375
[Laughter]

89
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,750
I couldn't let this happen.

90
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:49,000
The overworld had saved me
and now I had to try to save it.

91
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,875
We have to stop her, Dennis.

92
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:56,208
So we escaped and stole back the orb.

93
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,000
...

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,083
The wrongling has escaped!

95
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,541
Find him and bring me that orb!

96
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,083
Hurry, Dennis. Take this to Earth.

97
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,375
Follow my set to 149
Holly Oak Drive. You got that, boy?

98
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,000
Good boy. You're the
last hope for this world!

99
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,625
Run! Go, boy! Run!

100
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,416
You got this, Dennis! I love you!

101
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:17,708
Run!

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,791
Dennis was a hero that day.

103
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,583
He ran like the wind.

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,583
I didn't know if I'd ever see
him again, but we had a world to save.

105
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,833
So he ran all the
way back to my house on Earth

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,166
and hid the most powerful
object in existence under my waterbed.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,375
As long as the orb stays
hidden, the overworld will be safe.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,458
...

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I just pray some doofus doesn't find it.

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,333
...

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,125
In the late 1980s, Garrett
Garrison took the gaming world by storm,

112
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,000
becoming the undisputed
champion of the hit arcade game,

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,666
Hunt City Rampage.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,916
His mastery of this
two-player co-op shocked the world.

115
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:10,291
His effective use of the
garbage toss move earned him the nickname,

116
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,291
The Garbage Man.

117
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,916
He became the envy
of the gaming world after

118
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:19,458
landing a lucrative
six-figure deal with Sizzler.

119
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:35,000
One thing's for sure.

120
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,000
This kid had it all.

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,375
...

122
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,916
Here's the Garbage Man, Garrison.

123
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,958
No autographs.

124
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,708
Have a nice day.

125
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,000
...

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,833
...

127
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,125
Yeah! Super cool!

128
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,791
Garrett, The Garbage Man.

129
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,875
What do we owe this pleasure?

130
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:28,625
Pleasure?

131
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,875
I think I come to
storage auctions for fun.

132
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,166
I'm a businessman, Darrell.

133
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,083
An investor.

134
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,375
Well, I'm about to shovel
some coal into your choo-choo trade.

135
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,000
You're gonna love this next unit.

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,333
It's got a water bin.

137
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,916
It's got some pickaxes.

138
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,000
It's got a huge can of mixed nuts.

139
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:51,125
It's got an array of
unisex turquoise blouses.

140
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,541
That sounds terrible.

141
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,791
I think it's also
got a 1978 Atari Cosmos.

142
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:56,916
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

143
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,458
1978 Atari Cosmos?

144
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,875
That's what I say to you.

145
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,250
Those things are
worth the frickin' fortune.

146
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,500
Heck yeah, they are.

147
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Bro, if you make this happen for me, I
will strongly consider hanging out with you.

148
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You serious, bro?

149
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:10,625
Yep.

150
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,625
Two big buffaloes
like us out there in the wild.

151
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,916
We're in unisex turquoise blouses.

152
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,583
Oh boy, that's gonna cause a commotion.

153
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,083
The ladies aren't gonna know what.

154
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,250
Listen, if you keep
the hammer price under on you,

155
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,708
I'll make all your
weird fanboy dreams come true.

156
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:28,666
Okay?

157
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,500
Two loose cannons.

158
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,458
We're in turquoise blouses.

159
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,041
Yep.

160
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:35,541
Let's do it.

161
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,000
And we got $500. $500 over here.

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,916
We got $500. We got $600.

163
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,208
Do we have $600?

164
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,708
We got $600 over here.

165
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:43,583
Oh, can we hear you?

166
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,875
$700. We got $700.

167
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,291
We got $700 here.

168
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,500
We got $800 over here.

169
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,041
We got $850. Do we hear $850?

170
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,500
$850 over here. Do we hear any more?

171
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,375
Do we hear 900, 900, 900 going once,
900 going twice, and 900 going three times

172
00:11:56,375 --> 00:12:01,500
and sold to hometown hero,
Garak the garbage man Garrison, for $900.

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,750
I wouldn't cash
that for about six months.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,583
What?

175
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,291
Yeah. Come to Papa.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,583
Cosmics.

177
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,208
Whoo!

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,208
Darryl, where is it?

179
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,916
I'm sorry. I didn't check the box.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

181
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:30,333
Where's the authority?

182
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,916
There's no authority in here.

183
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,708
That does not mean
you can trash this unit.

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,541
I'm up against it, man. I'm...

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Oh, no. My store.

186
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:44,958
I just...

187
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,541
I need to win, man. I need...

188
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,208
I need to win.

189
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,000
Let's roll, everyone.

190
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,000
This man has no
respect for the storage community.

191

...

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Look, Chugless was
not my first choice either,

194
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,083
but it was Mom's
dying wish for us to live here.

195
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,666
Or at least that's how I interpreted it.

196
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,250
Yeah. I read
something online. This place sucks.

197
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,291
Anyways, rent is super low
and I've got a full-time gig here,

198
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,791
so it's not really an offer
we're gonna turn down right now.

199
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,458
Yeah, I get it.

200
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,208
Look, I think you're
really gonna like it here.

201
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,500
Oh, what's going on with that dude?

Oh, my gosh, Henry, we're in Chugless.

205
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,541
Say hi to Chubby the chap.

206
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:18,916
All right, this is the new neighborhood.

207
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,541

Oh.

213
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,500
Yeah, people love
working at a potato chip factory.

214
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, well, I'm running
their socials for a little bit.

215

their father account past 75.

alpaca hanging out of your car?

estate's not my only hustle.

220

mobile zoo stuff on the side.

221

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,458
Okay.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,791
Also, uh, I'm
really sorry about your mom.

225
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,791
She's really brave what you're doing.

226
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,375

I'm coming!

Check it out.

236
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,875
I made you mom's
signature tater-top breakfast pizza.

237
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,208
So you can hand out
slices on your first day?

238
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,333
I thought you wanted me to seem normal.

239
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,125
I do!

240
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,208
Who do you think I am?

241
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,416
I got you some body spray.

242
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,000
Signature scents are huge here.

243
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,541
Velvet mischief?

244
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,000
You're gonna wanna
spray it and then walk into it.

245
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,625
Don't be too
direct. It's really powerful.

246
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:26,750
Okay.

247
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:27,583
Love you.

248
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,416
Love you too.

249
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,000

Yeah, I know.

Classic loser mentality.

I can help.

258
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:21,041
I'm starting a mentorship program
for people who wanna win at the game of life.

259
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,041
Fifty bucks an hour.

260
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,875
Cool. How do you actually win at life?

261
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,291
That's literally the
answer I charge money for.

00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,458
My sister made it.

265
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,500
I'm supposed to hand out
slices at school to make friends.

266
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,583
A little desperate
for day one, don't you think?

267
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,416
I also noticed that
you're wearing velvet mischief.

268
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,333
It's a wonderful cologne.

269
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,875
And I strongly believe that every
young man should have his own signature sent.

270
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,000
I didn't think I applied very much.

271

Listen, I'm gonna
give you a hot garbage tip.

272
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:54,458
Friendship is like a puzzle.

273
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,000
Sometimes you think you
need lots of pieces to be cool,

274
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,916
and sometimes it's
just one piece to be cool.

275
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,791
Then people will be like,
"That's not a puzzle. That's a picture."

276
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,416
And they have a right to speak too.

277
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,833
Okay, well, I gotta go to school.

278
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,625

have an exclamation point?

Oh, Henry, we're
just so thrilled to have you.

You know, you're the
first student to enroll here

285

came out about the school rankings.

Anyway, I'm Vice
Principal Marlene, and I'm an open book.

287
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,333
You probably heard that my
husband Clemente recently divorced me.

288
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,875
And to be honest, I
expected it to hurt more than it does.

289
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,000
You know, the fire went
out on our marriage 20 years ago.

290
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,958
But we stuck it out for the dogs.

291
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,291

little something about myself.

Financially, I'm
living in a nightmare, okay?

296
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,458
I wouldn't wish my
life on my worst enemy.

297
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,708
Last year, I
claimed $4,000 on my tax return.

298
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,000
I also have
several pending lawsuits, okay?

299
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,458
But most of my money is
tied up in a drone kiosk at the mall.

00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,083
Okay, today we're gonna do a still life.

you know what a still life is?

foolproof, actually. It's just math.

00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:21,250
What?

733
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:22,875
[screams]

734
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:26,416
General Chugga, get over here!

735
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:32,958
[growling]

736
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,458
[screams]

737
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,458
[coughs]

738
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:40,500
Hey, Melgosia, what's going on?

739
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:44,500
Your old dungeon
buddy, Steve, has betrayed us.

740
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Well, that's a bummer.

741
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,000
The orb is with four roundlings.

742
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,333
My spies tell me he has
taken them to his lava chicken shack.

743
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,333
No way! I love that place.

744
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,375
La-la-la-lava, ch-ch-ch-ch-chicken.

745
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:00,083
Shut up! Take your finest warriors,

746
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,875
bring me that orb,
and kill the roundlings.

747
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,833
So, like, you want me
to end his life or whatever?

748
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,291
Are you serious?

749
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,500
What do you think I'm talking about?

750
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:13,375
Okay, I was just kind
of confused there for a second.

751
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:17,000
Take this from me, the
warts, so you don't zombify.

752
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:21,625
Um, Your Majesty, I don't think
this is going to be enough to go around.

753
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,458
Deal with it!

754
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,500
No worries.

755
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,375
All right, drink up, guys.

756
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:30,666
You don't want to zombify
up there, but just tiny sips, okay?

757
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:38,375
Okay, so how do we find
this woodland mansion thing?

758
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:42,583
Over the mountains into the dark
forest right beyond the massive red shrooms.

759
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:44,458
Massive red shrooms?

760
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,166
Mm-hmm. Big old red ones.

761
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,041
We need to find a real map, Steve.

762
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:52,041
This place is dangerous, and I
need to get my brother out of here.

763
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,166
Well, it seems like
he's having a pretty good time.

764
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:57,250
Look, your brother has
a gift. You know that, right?

765
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,375
You should let him explore it.

766
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:01,833
Creativity in this
world is key to survival.

767
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:05,041
Okay, well, in the real
world, things are a little bit different.

768
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,458
Creative kids get
picked last for a gym, they sit

769
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,416
at the bummer lunch
table, and they get bullied.

770
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:12,666
Don't I know it.

771
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:14,208
Do you even
realize what he did back home?

772
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,291
He blew up chuggy the chip.

773
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,250
Maybe I belong in this rock.

774
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,000
Henry, that's not what I meant.

775
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:23,666
It's not what I was saying at all.

776
00:43:25,541 --> 00:43:29,791
Just so you know, I'm more of
a sister to Hank than you'll ever be.

777
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:31,958
Yeah.

778
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:35,458
Bighead!

779
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,000
You okay?

780
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:39,583
Fine.

781
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:44,125
Look, I found one of these
big-headed looking dudes that sells maps.

782
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:45,875
Looks legit. Come on.

783
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:50,333
Welcome to the stash.

784
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:52,250
TNT.

785
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:55,291
Firework rockets,
also good for propulsion.

786
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:57,083
Boots of swiftness.

787
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:58,916
Diamond armor, full set.

788
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,041
And blades for days.

789
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:04,000
Everything will need to
make it to Woodland Mansion.

790
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:05,791
Whoa.

791
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,375
Focus loud, bro.

792
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:12,791
Look, but don't touch.

793
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:15,416
Those are some of my favorite treasures.

794
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:27,166
What's this junk?

795
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,666
That is an ender pearl.

796
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,000
Teleports you to wherever you throw it.

797
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:33,791
Yeah, right.

798
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:41,875
And that was the only one I had.

799
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:45,666
You know, Biggie, I almost
died fighting an enderman for it.

800
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:47,000
Come with me.

801
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,000
This is a crafting table.

802
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:57,166
Here's how it works.

803
00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:01,125
You place these
elements in different patterns and...

804
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:02,000
(GUNSHOT)

805
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,625
You got yourself a sweet blade.

806
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,791
You want to see a blade?

807
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:13,583
I'll show you a blade.

808
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:15,666
Yeah!

809
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:19,416
Heather.

810
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,000
Goodness!

811
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:27,625
That's okay, bud.
Buck-cuts are useful here.

812
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:30,708
Yeah, they're cool,
Garrett. They're like nunchucks.

813
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,291
Yeah, I know. That's why I made them.

814
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,416
They're...

815
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:37,250
Buck-chuckets.

816
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:39,166
Uh, they're what?

817
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:43,833
Hey, can I try something else?

818
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:45,625
Absorutantoodly.

819
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:51,833
Bro, you had tots the whole time?

820
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:52,583
Yeah, sorry.

821
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:57,208
...

822
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:58,875
It's a tot launcher.

823
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:03,583
Dude, you just took boring junk from
the real world to create something amazing.

824
00:46:03,916 --> 00:46:05,000
That is next level!

825
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,750
Hank, get a plate with
your tot launcher when you're done.

826
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:08,416
Yeah.

827
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:12,041
Hey, Steve. Can I
talk to you for a second?

828
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:15,125
Sure thing.

829
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:21,791
What's up?

830
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:23,833
You know that note you left with the orb?

831
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:25,333
You want about the riches?

832
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,250
I read it.

833
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:27,750
Yeah.

834
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:32,041
There's riches everywhere. Keep a
fat stash of diamonds at the redstone mines.

835
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,875
So this treasure load is
on the way to this mansion place?

836
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:38,875
Not really. It's a major
detour. Plus, the mines can be perilous.

837
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:40,958
I'm gonna keep it simple for you, Steve.

838
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:44,458
No diamonds.

839
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:46,166
No orb.

840
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,291
You smell them stepping in.

841
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:55,958
Good day.

842
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:57,375
(SIGHING)

843
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:02,041
We need a map to the Woodland Mansion.

844
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:02,958
(SIGHING)

845
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:05,166
We just need a map.

846
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:09,625
Nat?

847
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:10,541
It's gone.

848
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:12,083
Something's going down.

849
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:37,833
All right, guys. Just
start trashing their priorities.

850
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:40,166
Villagers hate that.

851
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:54,000
Whoa!

852
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:06,166
...

853
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,166
Who are these guys?

854
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:13,125
England. They must react to the orb.

855
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,250
Hey, Steve! What's going on, dude?

856
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:20,208
Crap!

857
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:21,583
Shrummus.

858
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:25,708
I'm really sorry that I
have to annihilate you and stuff.

859
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:26,958
...

860
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:28,708
Malth Coast should double-cross me.

861
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:31,500
We just need that orb thingy.

862
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,375
You rode this guy?

863
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:34,875
Yeah, we used to
get into some dungeon stuff.

864
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:37,083
He seems nice, but he's a coward.

865
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:39,541
Wow! You look good, bro-hammer.

866
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You lose some weight.

867
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,500
Stand back, boys.

868
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,291
This pig is mine.

869
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:44,958
No.

870
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,500
I'm tired of you getting all the glory.

871
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:50,916
This pig is mine.

872
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:00,416

00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:19,583
We have to get to Henry. Do
you think we can take these guys?

875
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:20,625
You are?

876
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:23,916
Yeah, you got me, Celine.

This guy is feeling brand new!

880
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:48,500
Woo-hoo!

881
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:51,125
This guy is feeling brand new!

882
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:53,416
This guy is feeling brand new!

This guy is feeling brand new!

00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:09,500
Sorry!

888
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:28,041
The party's over,
bud. Just give me the orb.

889
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,166
I'm gonna do
something! I'm gonna do something!

890
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:34,833
Ninja roll.

891
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:38,083
What happened?

892
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:40,208
I saved your butt. That's what happened.

893
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:41,458
He thanks me later.

894
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,083
We gotta get to the rampart. Follow me!

895
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,750
Henry!

896
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:58,333
Matt, we have to go now!

897
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:00,250
Don, I can't leave
him! He's my entire family!

898
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,250
We need you! I'm live!

899
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,000
Okay, we'll meet him
back at the Woodland mansion.

900
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,750
We gotta go find him! Matt, come on!

901
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:08,500
Garrett, what about Natalie?

902
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,500
We'll meet her at the mansion!

903
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:20,916
Whoa!

904
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,875
Oh, great. Now what?

going to the Woodland mansion!

00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:42,208
Those things work, right?

914
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:42,958
Absolutely.

915
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:47,166
...

916
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:48,541
...

917
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:52,500
Check it out! I'm flying!

918
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:53,708
Yeah!

919
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:01,000
Buenos dias. Let me see you later.

920
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:03,500
...

921
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:08,666
I thought I grabbed three! Wait for me!

922
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:12,000
Coming in hot!

923
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:21,500
(THUNDER)

924
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,291
...

925
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:24,875
No! No way, dude!

926
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,541
Look over my hair!

927
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:30,166
Just relax. Let my hips
guide you. It's the only way!

928
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:30,833
What?

929
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,041
(LAUGHING)  

930
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:34,125
Hey!

931
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,000
We'll have a
better chance if we split up!

932
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:43,708
What?

933
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:46,791
...

934
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:48,041
Can you hear me?

935
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,583
...

936
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:55,416
...

937
00:52:55,416 --> 00:52:59,083
...

938
00:52:59,083 --> 00:52:59,791
...

939
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,125
Get out of here, stupid pig!

940
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:03,416
...

941
00:53:03,416 --> 00:53:04,875
(THUNDER)

942
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,125
...

943
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:12,791
...

944
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:17,833
...

945
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,583
...

946
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:22,166
Woo-hoo!

947
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,208
(LAUGHING)

948
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:26,583
...

949
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:30,916
We got hot graters!
They're at three o'clock!

950
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:33,375
...

951
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:37,708
...

952
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:42,916
I got us boxed in!

953
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:43,083
Oh!

954
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:44,208
Head for the tunnel!

955
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:47,250
We're not gonna fit! We're too chunky!

956
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,416
We're gonna have to go
nose to nose! Full man sandwich!

957
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:52,666
What? No! I'm not gonna do that!

958
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:55,375
I have ordered you
to make a full man sandwich!

959
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:56,041
Okay!

960
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:00,833
Oh my God!

961
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:01,541
Oh my God!

962
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:01,916
Oh my God!

963
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:04,625
Yeah!

964
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:08,583
Dang it! A lava bucket!

965
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,791
Okay! Tighten up!

966
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:11,500
What?

967
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:15,041
There's still some negative
space back there! We both know it!

968
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,583
I'm trying to close the gaps!

969
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,291
I'm gonna squeeze for your safety!

970
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,500
I understand!

971
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:20,625
Wow!

972
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:23,833
...

973
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:28,916
...

974
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,708
...

975
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:31,416
Woo-hoo!

976
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:38,375
...

977
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:42,166
Get off me, you stupid pig! Get off me!

978
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:51,625
...

979
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:52,291
Help me!

980
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:56,416
Oh crap!

981
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:03,583
Help me!

982
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:11,208
Don't worry! I'm gonna
cushion up all with this water bucket!

983
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:12,375
Really?

984
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:25,750
You couldn't really
fight, Matt! You were kicking butt!

985
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,833
Thanks! I have no
idea where it came from!

986
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,041
There he is! He's getting away!

987
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,958
Hey! Get back here! We need a map!

988
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:32,000
We need a boat!

989
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,416
Okay, okay, uh...

990
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:34,208
Okay, hurry!

991
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,625
The map guy's flown away!

992
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:41,625
Boat matching!

993
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:48,500
Matt, that's the
worst boat I've ever seen!

994
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:50,416
I'm sorry, I have no idea what I'm doing.

995
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:51,958
Forget it! Let's go! Come on!

996
00:56:01,416 --> 00:56:03,541
(HORN HONKING)

997
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:14,208
Oh no, not again!

998
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:19,041
Oh! I am so sorry!
Oh my God, are you alright?

999
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:22,333
Oh my God! Oh my God, are you alright?

1000
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,833
Your head is huge!

1001
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:30,333
You're not gonna sue me, are you?

1002
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:34,666
Because everyone wants to sue me
once I hit them with my Jeep Grand Cherokee!

1003
00:56:35,416 --> 00:56:39,875
Oh my! How about this?
What if I just take you to dinner?

1004
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,250
Would you like to go to dinner?

1005
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:48,041
You got some talking to do,
buddy. Hank and I want some answers.

1006
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:51,375
Like, how are we gonna stop those
pigs and why is my beard smell like gorgonzola?

1007
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,125
Yeah, and who's that evil
sorceress you were talking about?

1008
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:57,291
Look! The sorceress is a
pigling queen called Nalgosha.

1009
00:56:57,416 --> 00:57:01,500
Those are her minions. She rules over
them in a dark hellscape called the Nether.

1010
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:05,583
And I always keep a chunk of
gorgonzola in my front pocket, okay?

1011
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,833
It's my best
friend's favorite snacky snack.

1012
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:12,750
My best friend Dennis.

1013
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:17,583
Nalgosha's path to villainy
started the way these things often do.

1014
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,375
During the semi-finals
of the Nether Scott talent.

1015
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:30,083
Young Nalgosha always
dreamed of being a world-class dancer.

1016
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:36,625
Her moves were pretty out there.
No one in the Nether was ready for it.

1017
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,250
It crushed her.

1018
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:46,375
What'd I tell you about all
that dancing? You deserve to fail.

1019
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:50,541
Creativity will never make you happy. But

1020
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:54,583
you know what
will? Gold! Now go find some!

1021
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,958
So from that day forward, she
denounced all forms of creativity.

1022
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:06,000
If she ever gets that orb, she'll
block out the sun. Netherward will flourish.

1023
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:09,083
This beautiful world and
everything in it will wither and die!

1024
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:11,375
And you were gonna
give it to her? Great idea.

1025
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:17,000
I'm not gonna give it to her, but I
need that orb for leverage. Gotta save Dennis.

1026
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:18,458
Come.

1027
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:26,583
Woodland Mansion is just beyond the
Redstone Mountains. We can go over or through.

1028
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:28,083
Whatever's fastest.

1029
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:31,375
Through will be faster.

1030
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:42,916
Get her up, Chungus! You
have failed me for the last time!

1031
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:44,916
Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

1032
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:47,208
Ah! Bring out the beast!

1033
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,083
What? What do you mean
you just have to put the bride in?

1034
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,375
Well, here's a big deal. Get it done!

1035
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:57,666
Look, everybody knows it wasn't my best day. But I'm really trying to set some new goals. I'm
not gonna give it to you. I'm not gonna give it to you. Look, everybody knows it wasn't my best day.

1036
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,208
But I'm really
trying to set some new goals.

1037
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:14,083
The Great Hawk! My ultimate weapon.

1038
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:19,375
There it is!

1039
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:23,625
Can't help!

1040
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,875
Wait, does this mean you're firing me?

1041
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:34,583
Well done. Now find the
roundlings and bring me they all!

1042
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:39,375
We are so lost.

1043
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:51,541
My one job was to
protect Henry and I blew it.

1044
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:54,958
I just promise my mom I'd
never let anything happen to him.

1045
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,125
I guess I'm just not cut
out for this parenting stuff.

1046
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:06,083
I just wish I could've been a
kid for a little bit longer, you know?

1047
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:08,416
I just have that feeling
like I could've done anything.

1048
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:11,416
I hear ya. Being a grown-up sucks.

1049
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:16,333
You got all these responsibilities
and you just stopped chasing your dreams.

1050
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:21,000
You think I like having fifteen hustles?

1051
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,625
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold up, hold up. Let's just calm down.

1052
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:37,958
I think this one just needs some TLC.

1053
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:41,458
Yeah? You like bones?

1054
01:00:42,666 --> 01:00:46,500
I bet you like
bones as you go. That you do?

1055
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:47,958
Yes?

1056
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:54,750
Aren't you a beautiful
one? Yes you are. Yes you are.

1057
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:58,458
I cannot believe Hugh just did that.

1058
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:04,250
Dennis? Steve's Dennis?

1059
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:07,041
Well, can you take us to him?

1060
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:13,833
Oh, Nat, I think this might
be our way to the Woodland Mansion.

1061
01:01:15,416 --> 01:01:17,250
Let's follow this pooch.

1062
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:21,833
Right this way, gentlemen.

1063
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:25,541
Looky, looky here.

1064
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:28,166
Welcome to the Redstone Mines.

1065
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:32,208
See that glowy stuff? That's Redstone.

1066
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:33,625
It conducts energy.

1067
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:36,375
You can build some
crazy contraptions with it.

1068
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:40,083
I thought you said
this was a diamond mine.

1069
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,458
Easy, big dog. They're here.

1070
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:46,541
But be careful. I set
some booby traps a long time ago.

1071
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,416
They came for the life
of me. Remember where they are?

1072
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:54,416
[Hoot!]

1073
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:57,083

1074

1078

[Screaming] [Screaming] Help me, Steve!

1079
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:03,833

1080
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:04,708

[Screaming]

1083
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:11,791
Ha! Here it is! Thanks, Garrett.

1084
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:13,458
Yeah.

1085
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:18,541
Yes. We're diamonds.

1086
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,916
That's what I'm talking about.

1087
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,083
Steve delivers the goods.

1088
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:24,708
Did you guys plan this?

1089
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:26,833
I'm sorry, Henry.

1090
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:29,375
Whoo! Yeah!

1091
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:30,500
I'm not.

1092
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:32,916
Yeah.

1093
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,375
What the heck, man?

1094
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:35,625
Overlax.

1095
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,416
Not only could we
hit the mansion already.

1096
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:40,250
Too far?

1097
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:41,333
Uh-huh.

1098
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:43,291
Oh, no.

1099
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:45,166
Neither what?

1100
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:47,000
What does that mean?

1101
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:55,041
Oh! The Great Hawk!

1102
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:57,208
She finally put the brain in.

1103
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,041
Run for the mine, Terz!

1104
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:07,375
Hit it, Henry! Hit it!

1105
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:10,000
[Screaming]

1106
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,625
If memory serves, I built a
kick-ass safe room just up the head!

1107
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:21,666
Dang it! My corpse blew out!

1108
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:22,916
Why are we stopping?

1109
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:26,500
We're a husky load, gents.
We're gonna need a redstone booth fast.

1110
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,000
What's that sound?

1111
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:31,000
Crap!

1112
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:32,791
My creeper farm.

1113
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:39,041
What kind of idiot
would breathe these things?

1114
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:45,250
Up ahead, look!

1115
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:48,375
We gotta get to the redstone rail!

1116
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,041
Garrett, you guys are in
this mess. Get him and punch!

1117
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:52,541
Okay.

1118
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,375
Okay.

1119
01:03:58,416 --> 01:04:01,041
Don't get her in this mess, man!

1120
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,083
We're not gonna beat this!

1121
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:05,500
Come on, Garrett!
You've got to go faster!

1122
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,375
Stop slumping, Hank!

1123
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:10,958
Garrett, get her!

1124
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,416
He's right behind us!

1125
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:37,208
Woo-hoo!

1126
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:38,875
Yeah!

1127
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:48,208
Nice work, Gar-Gar. Your
little detour almost got us killed.

1128
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,958
I'm a liar. So
dramatic. We're still alive.

1129
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:54,000
What's her problem, man? We
didn't need those stupid diamonds.

1130
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:57,083
I swear, you were literally
the most selfish person I've ever met.

1131
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:58,958
Whatever. I need them.

1132
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,375
Okay? I need the diamonds,
because I need the money, because I'm broke.

1133
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:05,416
You wouldn't know anything about that.

1134
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,916
My life sucks, kid. All
right? I'm a frickin' loser.

1135
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:13,166
There, I said it.

1136
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,500
I know it looks like I
got it all put together, right?

1137
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:18,083
I'm smart, funny, bilingual.

1138
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,750
El humble, tu un el faulto.

1139
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:26,750
That's not the reality.

1140
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:30,416
I'm not doing well. I'm bad.

1141
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,750
I'm washed up, Hank.
I'm gonna lose everything.

1142
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,333
And that's not the worst part.

1143
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:40,000
I'm alone.

1144
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:41,916
You're alone.

1145
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:44,166
I was your friend.

1146
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:50,583
Sorry about your finances.

1147
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:52,791
The shop's not...

1148
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:10,041
Halt!

1149
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:11,708
Aw.

1150
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:14,458
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1151
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:17,583
Aw, ne esposi, buh.

1152
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:24,541
You know, I gotta tell
you, I'm having a great time.

1153
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:29,375
I recently got
divorced from my husband Clemente,

1154
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:35,458
and the main reason is, you
know, he didn't have any personality.

1155
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:38,333
Not like you.

1156
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:40,750
Are you finished?

1157
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:44,791
No, I think he's
Swedish. But we're done with our meal.

1158
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:49,625
There it is. The Woodland Mansion.

1159
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:53,333
We're gonna get in there, get
the Earth Crystal, and get you guys home.

1160
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,416
Follow me!

1161
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:56,375
Check this out.

1162
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:00,375
Let's do this. Pay
close attention to Papa Steve.

1163
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:02,625
The Woodland Mansion has three floors.

1164
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:05,958
The first floor is
loaded with vindicators.

1165
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,166
Axe murderers, basically.

1166
01:07:08,166 --> 01:07:10,666
Why is it third floor on
the first floor? I'm very confused.

1167
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:14,541
I was trying to make three floors, but
I didn't have time to make like a dollhouse.

1168
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,500
The second floor crawls with evokers.

1169
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:20,125
They wield powerful dark magic.

1170
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:22,000
This is the worst model I've ever seen.

1171
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,250
Garrett, stop talking.
We're trying to figure out a plan.

1172
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:25,375
Bro, how long you been mad at me for?

1173
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,083
I just got mad at you.

1174
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:29,250
Please don't be mad
at me for this, okay? But I

1175
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,000
accidentally stole the
orb while you were crafting.

1176
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:33,708
Are we cool now?

1177
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:37,500
You are literally the
worst person in the entire world.

1178
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,000
Guys! Both of you!
Eyes on my demonstration!

1179
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:43,291
Third floor. How's it's the loot chamber?

1180
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:47,500
That's where the Earth
Crystal is. But it's guarded by endermen.

1181
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:52,000
Whatever you do, do not look them
in the eye. They'll fry your brains out.

1182
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:54,375
Okay, well, I could build stairs to
the second floor, sneak in through the window,

1183
01:07:54,416 --> 01:07:56,166
and snag the Earth Crystal.

1184
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:57,625
That's a great idea, Hank.

1185
01:07:57,916 --> 01:08:00,333
But to pull it off, we're
gonna need a pretty sweet diversion.

1186
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:04,208
You know what could work
on these guys? It sounds crazy.

1187
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,166
Hit me.

1188
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:13,958
Someone order a saxophone birthday party?

1189
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:18,750
Looks like it's everyone's birthday.

1190
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:19,500
Get it!

1191
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:23,375
Friendship is the wish you make

1192
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:25,916
when you blow on out the
candles on your birthday cake!

1193
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,000
Don't be a bully and don't be a boo.

1194
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:30,291
Time to put on your birthday suit.

1195
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:32,291
Today is the best.
It's the day you were born.

1196
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,416
Time for us to blow the birthday horn.

1197
01:09:23,416 --> 01:09:26,541
...

1198
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:38,791
You gotta be kidding me.

1199
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,958
You got this, Darkheart!

1200
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:44,416
Reach down, Jeeves!

1201
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:46,333
You're the sharkless kitten!

1202
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:47,208
I love you!

1203
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,625
What's going on, Steve?

1204
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:51,250
It's some kind of
sadistic vindicator fight club.

1205
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,750
I've heard of
these, but I've never seen one.

1206
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:55,208
They want me to fight the chicken?

1207
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:55,750
Wait!

1208
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,375
It's a fight to the death, kid!

1209
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:10,583
...

1210
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:17,916
[GIGGLING]

1211
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:19,666
...

1212
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:20,500
...

1213
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:22,666
Chicken jockey!

1214
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:26,000
...

1215
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,458
...

1216
01:10:27,458 --> 01:10:28,875
...

1217
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,958
Watch out!

1218
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,500
...

1219
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,250
Get them away from your face!

1220
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:37,500
...

1221
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,708
...

1222
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:43,791
...

1223
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:45,000
...

1224
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,916
...

1225
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:46,583
...

1226
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:50,250
...

1227
01:10:52,125 --> 01:11:11,791
...

1228
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:25,750
...

1229
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:28,041
Finally.

1230
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:42,041
...

1231
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:55,500
...

1232
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,541
...

1233
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:01,291
...

1234
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:02,458
Help me, help me!

1235
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:07,500
...

1236
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:14,166
(crying)

1237
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:17,416
I'm sorry little buddy.

1238
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,166
Don't fall for it, Gaga!

1239
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,500
That baby's got the heart of a demon.

1240
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:23,541
No, you're not a demon, are you?

1241
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,958
You're a cute little bugger face.

1242
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:28,541
I'm just gonna pet your little head.

1243
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,541
...

1244
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:41,541
You'll never be as cruel as me, Hank.

1245
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:43,041
She's give up.

1246
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:45,375
The overworld doesn't need you, Henry.

1247
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:46,791
Neither do I.

1248
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:49,000
This is all your fault, Henry.

1249
01:12:49,666 --> 01:12:51,000
Everything you do for me.

1250
01:12:52,916 --> 01:12:53,125
Stop.

1251
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:54,750
Try to get me.

1252
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,083
Just give up, you lads.

1253
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:01,916
...

1254
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:06,833
...

1255
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:15,916
I'm cut off!

1256
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,250
...

1257
01:13:19,708 --> 01:13:20,750
...

1258
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:28,041
...

1259
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:31,500
...

1260
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,958
...

1261
01:13:50,375 --> 01:13:52,541
You saved my life.

1262
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:54,541
That's what friends do, Garrett.

1263
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:55,791
...

1264
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:59,250
Hank, did you get the earth crystal?

1265
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,125
Yeah, I got it.

1266
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:02,583
Let's get out of this hellhole!

1267
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:07,166
...

1268
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:15,458
Where do you think you're going?

1269
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:17,375
It's her!

1270
01:14:18,416 --> 01:14:20,708
You doeys, you really thought

1271
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:22,625
you could defeat my great home.

1272
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:26,416
News flash, I built a new one.

1273
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:28,875
...

1274
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:29,958
Come go, chef!

1275
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:31,833
Your reign is over!

1276
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,250
You're wrong.

1277
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,083
It's just beginning.

1278
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:39,583
No!

1279
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:42,750
No!

1280
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,041
Kill them.

1281
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:46,041
We have work to do.

1282
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:49,166
Goodbye, Steve!

1283
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:56,833
Seeker piglins.

1284
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:59,000
They're gonna blow this bridge sky high!

1285
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:00,583
Sorry, Hank.

1286
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:01,166
What?

1287
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:03,916
...

1288
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:06,291
Yeah!

1289
01:15:09,208 --> 01:15:09,708
Slant cube!

1290
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,500
...

1291
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:21,166
Come on, Garrett, drop!

1292
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:22,958
No, Steve, get him out of here!

1293
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:24,208
Go, Hank!

1294
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:26,166
Save your sister and get home!

1295
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,750
Garrett, you don't have to do this!

1296
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:29,458
No, get him home, Steve!

1297
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,666
Tell my story in song!

1298
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,041
Keep it metal, keep it heavy.

1299
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:35,333
Real instruments.

1300
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:39,666
Besides, I love you, Owls.

1301
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:42,166
I love you, Owls.

1302
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:44,375
...

1303
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:51,958
...

1304
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:56,958
(exploding)

1305
01:15:56,958 --> 01:16:01,208
...

1306
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:05,833
We're going down!

1307
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:07,000
No!

1308
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:09,250
Race for impact!

1309
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:15,833
...

1310
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:23,750
Dennis.

1311
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:27,166
(laughing)

1312
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:30,500
Dennis?

1313
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:32,541
Dennis!

1314
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:34,791
Oh, oh, oh, it's you!

1315
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:36,375
It's really you!

1316
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:39,166
...

1317
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:42,208
(laughing)

1318
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:46,916
How'd you find me?

1319
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:48,291
He's one heck of a wolf.

1320
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,333
He led us right to you guys.

1321
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,958
Now I understand why
you kept yourself so filthy

1322
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:55,041
and smelly so
Dennis could find you one day.

1323
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:57,375
Is he okay?

1324
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:59,500
He's fine, he's just resting.

1325
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:02,916
Good, it's a pretty rough crash landing.

1326
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,833
Wait a minute, where are we?

1327
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:12,500
You guys both made this?

1328
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:15,291
Y'all, we're not messing around.

1329
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:16,750
We got the silk touch.

1330
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,750
No luck, Er.

1331
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:24,041
I was so afraid that I lost you.

1332
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,791
I was so afraid that I lost you, too.

1333
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:31,833
I'm really sorry about Garrett.

1334
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:40,041
...

1335
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:45,125
With this all
about dark in the overworld,

1336
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:47,916
never what will spread like wildfire,

1337
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:50,916
then all its gold will be ours!

1338
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:53,541
...

1339
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:16,500
...

1340
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:26,666
It has begun, the great darkening.

1341
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,583
Malgosia's gathering all her forces.

1342
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,541
She will destroy this land,

1343
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,125
unless we go get that orb.

1344
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:36,916
But what are we doing here?

1345
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:40,208
Let's go fight some pigs.

1346
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:42,916
I'm ready, I'm done with those pigs.

1347
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:43,916
Yeah, me too.

1348
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,375
Let's do it for Gaga.

1349
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:48,666
First we mine, then we craft.

1350
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,291
Let's Minecraft!

1351
01:18:50,875 --> 01:18:51,125
Mike!

1352
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:52,750
One, two, three.

1353
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:53,166
Jeez!

1354
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:53,958
Get the orb!

1355
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:55,000
What are you saying?

1356
01:18:55,041 --> 01:18:55,333
Minecraft.

1357
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:57,208
We should all say that on three.

1358
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:58,833
Forget it, there's no time!

1359
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:01,791
Show us what you got, Henry.

1360
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,625
Okay, I've got a plan.

1361
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:06,166
Killer recipes,
we're gonna have to move fast.

1362
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:07,208
Let's get to work.

1363
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:10,833
First, we're gonna need iron ingots.

1364
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:12,250
Coming in hot.

1365
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:16,125
Ow!

1366
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:17,458
Oh yeah!

1367
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:21,000
We're gonna need the boots of swiftness.

1368
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:25,250
Time to light this place up.

1369
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:26,875
Come on, boys.

1370
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:30,791
Have a nice ride!

1371
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:34,208
...

1372
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:40,625
We need a ton of diamonds.

1373
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:47,041
And it waits for days.

1374
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:52,000
You want somebody?

1375
01:19:58,291 --> 01:19:58,750
We're ready.

1376
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:00,500
Let's go save the overworld.

1377
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:03,500
...

1378
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:08,541
Listen up, my kiddies.

1379
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,375
Today, we take the overworld as ours.

1380
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:20,208
Attack their villages, burn their homes

1381
01:20:20,583 --> 01:20:22,500
and their symmetrical fires.

1382
01:20:23,458 --> 01:20:26,625
All they have created, we destroy!

1383
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:29,041
...

1384
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:33,666
Well, what are you standing around for?

1385
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:35,250
Get out of here!

1386
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:37,416
Go on, destroy something!

1387
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:41,875
...

1388
01:20:49,375 --> 01:20:49,666
Hey, Henry!

1389
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:58,875
...

1390
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:27,375
Ha!

1391
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:32,583
News flash, iron golems
will not attack unless provoked.

1392
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:34,041
Ha ha ha!

1393
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:43,500
Real smooth, Travis!

1394
01:21:47,916 --> 01:21:48,083
No?

1395
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:59,958
...

1396
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:04,416
You ready?

1397
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:06,791
Let's do this.

1398
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:22,083
Oh, for goodness sake!

1399
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,750
Enjoying the show, are you?

1400
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:28,375
Get down there and
take care of those roundlings!

1401
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:30,833
...

1402
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:33,875
(laughing)

1403
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:40,875
Daddy liked import jobs!

1404
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:45,166
...

1405
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:56,500
(laughing)

1406
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:57,083
Huh?

1407
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:02,375
Okay, Gosh.

1408
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,250
Let's dance.

1409
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:05,458
Bring it on!

1410
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:07,750
...

1411
01:23:11,958 --> 01:23:13,458
Kick it hard!

1412
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:19,791
Ha!

1413
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:28,708
My diamond armor!

1414
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:30,375
I'll take this hat!

1415
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:32,250
Friends!

1416
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:35,458
What is this, great festival?

1417
01:23:36,208 --> 01:23:39,333
Get off of me!

1418
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:43,958
Hurry, the orb's up there!

1419
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:54,291
...

1420
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:58,541
Do it, Henry!

1421
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:00,083
I got this.

1422
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:10,833
...

1423
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:11,708
Go, Henry, go!

1424
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,791
Hey, Captain, bookcrack!

1425
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:27,666
I got you.

1426
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,291
I got something for you!

1427
01:24:33,583 --> 01:24:34,916
...

1428
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,375
Get dense.

1429
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:49,541
Woo, quick, come on, out of that thing!

1430
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:52,000
Finish this, Henry!

1431
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:02,541
...

1432
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:16,000
(ominous music)

1433
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:17,250
Henry!

1434
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,208
No!

1435
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:34,500
...

1436
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,791
I got you, puppy!

1437
01:25:37,791 --> 01:25:40,250
Ah, yes!

1438
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:41,625
Yes!

1439
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,083
You're alive!

1440
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:45,375
Yes!

1441
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:49,458
Between us, I use
Steve's water bucket trick.

1442
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:50,708
Pretty cool, huh?

1443
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:52,000
A little bit.

1444
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:53,958
Let's get this orb and go home.

1445
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,500
...

1446
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:01,083
All right, heck, it's fireball time.

1447
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,500
Grab that spear, I want
you to jab it in the tentacles.

1448
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:06,625
...

1449
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:07,208
Woo!

1450
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:08,125
Jab it!

1451
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:11,375
Yeah!

1452
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:13,583
How'd you learn how to do that?

1453
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:14,708
Oh, yeah.

1454
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,541
...

1455
01:26:28,541 --> 01:26:33,041
...

1456
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:39,708
No!

1457
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:42,458
What have you done?

1458
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:44,458
Stay home!

1459
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:52,375
...

1460
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:18,125
...

1461
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:18,333
No!

1462
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:19,750
Oh my God!

1463
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,208
Stop!

1464
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:25,958
Good to see you, garbage man.

1465
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:30,375
...

1466
01:27:40,166 --> 01:27:41,166
You failed, witch.

1467
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,583
The overworld lives on.

1468
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:46,500
You too have fallen for the great lie.

1469
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:48,750
You'll never be happy.

1470
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:50,875
Deep down, you know.

1471
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:55,208
To hope, to dream,
to create is to suffer.

1472
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:56,125
You're right.

1473
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,458
It is harder to create than to destroy.

1474
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:03,500
That's why cowards
tend to choose the deuce.

1475
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:04,375
Nah.

1476
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:06,041
Later, gauche.

1477
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,791
Every minute knowing
you has been a horror show

1478
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,791
waste of time.

1479
01:28:12,875 --> 01:28:13,666
Wait, one more thing.

1480
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:15,708
Come close there.

1481
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,208
Do you have a little
knife that you're gonna try

1482
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:18,958
to stab me with?

1483
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:21,000
No, I know, I'm too weak.

1484
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:22,500
...

1485
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:23,500
All right.

1486
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:26,958
Ah, come on!

1487
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:28,541
It was worth a shot.

1488
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:30,750
Wait, wait, let me say one more thing.

1489
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:31,583
Come closer.

1490
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:32,458
No way!

1491
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,291
No, really, it's about you.

1492
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:36,500
Fine.

1493
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:40,791
Lean down here.

1494
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:45,208
You really are the worst.

1495
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:47,041
Goodbye.

1496
01:28:47,916 --> 01:28:49,583
This isn't really, come back!

1497
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:51,208
I don't even have a knife.

1498
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:52,625
How would I keep it?

1499
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:55,041
Stay, stay!

1500
01:28:55,791 --> 01:29:01,291
...

1501
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:06,833
Hey!

1502
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:09,750
You sure you wanna go back, Henry?

1503
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:12,083
It won't feel like this.

1504
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:16,500
There you got constraints, judgments,

1505
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:18,250
obstacles.

1506
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:19,500
Yeah, I know.

1507
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:21,625
But I'm gonna go make stuff anyway.

1508
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:26,208
I like that.

1509
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:29,000
You're a brave kid.

1510
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:33,250
Steve, you still cool with this?

1511
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,750
Yeah, come here, boy.

1512
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:43,708
Of course I still love you.

1513
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,916
That's why I think this is a good idea.

1514
01:29:47,083 --> 01:29:48,416
You changed my life.

1515
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,791
It's time for you to go change hers too.

1516
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,416
Go now, Dennis

1517
01:29:57,833 --> 01:30:00,458
Change Don's life, Dennis

1518
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:05,291
Go on a journey and think of me

1519
01:30:07,333 --> 01:30:07,583
Dennis

1520
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:12,958
Go now, legendary wolf of my dreams

1521
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:16,000
My doggy doggy doggy

1522
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:19,583
My Dennis

1523
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:27,250
(crying)

1524
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:28,000
God!

1525
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,500
If I would've known
you could sing like that,

1526
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:33,458
it would help me get past your smell.

1527
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:41,041
Garrett, you are a
truly bodacious warrior

1528
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:43,416
and a really good friend.

1529
01:30:44,791 --> 01:30:46,291
I wish you'd come home with us.

1530
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:53,083
Hangs cool, but I
don't have any friends my age.

1531
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:00,958
You would make a great team.

1532
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:07,458
Biocompteus, it means goodbye, brother.

1533
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:09,166
No, it doesn't.

1534
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:12,500
Don't look at her, it does.

1535
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:14,041
No, it does not.

1536
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:15,583
Yeah, it does.

1537
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:19,833
Love you guys.

1538
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,166
Are you sure you don't want to come back?

1539
01:31:23,125 --> 01:31:24,416
Yeah, I'm staying here.

1540
01:31:24,416 --> 01:31:26,041
I got a bunch more stuff I want to build.

1541
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,625
Why don't you bring some
of that magic to the real world?

1542
01:31:33,083 --> 01:31:33,958
...

1543
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:51,250
...

1544
01:31:52,083 --> 01:31:53,500
Screw it, I'm coming with.

1545
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:58,833
Turns out the overworld taught us

1546
01:31:58,833 --> 01:32:01,166
you can create the life you dream of,

1547
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:03,291
even in the real world.

1548
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:06,333
Garrett's store
became the hottest place in town

1549
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:10,375
and the best part, his
new friends were never far.

1550
01:32:11,666 --> 01:32:13,708
So if Henry and Natalie's helped,

1551
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:17,000
we created the hit
game, Block City Battle Buddies.

1552
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:21,791
All that time in the
overworld upped everyone's game.

1553
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:26,583
And every Friday, I would let it rip.

1554
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:28,625
...

1555
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,416
I used to wake up and
play back in my childhood days

1556
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:38,291
Getting old is such a dirty shame

1557
01:32:39,291 --> 01:32:40,958
They never gave me a chance

1558
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:43,083
To let my imagination dance

1559
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:45,708
Hell, I came up with a different game

1560
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:50,041
I'm in the mines all of the time

1561
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:52,208
Renting out the sun

1562
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:53,666
Having some fun

1563
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:57,875
Laughing, I'm never ever looking back

1564
01:32:58,291 --> 01:33:00,208
Cause I feel like

1565
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:06,375
Dawn finally got to
ditch her real estate job.

1566
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:09,625
She and Dennis brought
the party wherever they went.

1567
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:13,458
Natalie decided to
share her new skill set

1568
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:14,541
with the real world.

1569
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:16,750
Survival mode, self-defense.

1570
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:19,375
...

1571
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:23,666
The streets of
Chugless have never been safer.

1572
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:25,166
You get them Natalie.

1573
01:33:26,791 --> 01:33:30,500
And Henry, he finally
got that jet pack to work.

1574
01:33:36,083 --> 01:33:37,875
I feel the fire

1575
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:42,166
A moon mountain's wind in my mind

1576
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:45,416
I feel the fire

1577
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:49,083
Like a new moon on the right

1578
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,750
I feel the fire

1579
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,375
Like a red stone over dry

1580
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,208
I feel the fire

1581
01:34:01,458 --> 01:34:03,791
With the power of a world inside

1582
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:07,875
I feel the light

1583
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:09,416
Yeah

1584
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,250
...

1585
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:23,750
...

1586
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:27,041
I know how much you love bread.

1587
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:31,208
Marlene, your ex-husband's here.

1588
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:32,208
He said it was an emergency.

1589
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,125
Well, you tell him.

1590
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:36,125
I've got nothing to say to him.

1591
01:34:36,666 --> 01:34:38,000
You gotta be kidding me, Marlene.

1592
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,291
This is the guy.

1593
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:40,916
Too late, Clemente.

1594
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:42,666
You had your chance.

1595
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,458
She's right, Clemente.

1596
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:45,666
You totally blew it.

1597
01:34:45,666 --> 01:34:45,875
Enough, Marlene. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't know it.

1598
01:34:46,125 --> 01:34:49,833
And now I reap the
rewards of your mistake.

1599
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:54,208
You see, when Marlene's
Jeep Grand Cherokee ran me over,

1600
01:34:54,666 --> 01:34:57,000
I was struck by a love so powerful,

1601
01:34:57,291 --> 01:35:00,583
it transcended the
barriers of conventional speech.

1602
01:35:01,291 --> 01:35:04,500
Now, I speak human,
and she speaks villager.

1603
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:06,041
...

1604
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:08,083
Marlene?

1605
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:09,000
Uh-oh.

1606
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:11,875
Marlene, you're my baby.

1607
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:15,250
Marlene, ever since we met last night,

1608
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:18,416
I wanted to say, would you marry me?

1609
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:19,791
Yes.

1610
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:21,125
Yes.

1611
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,291
A thousand times, yes.

1612
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:25,291
