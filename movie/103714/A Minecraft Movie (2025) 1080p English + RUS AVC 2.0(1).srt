Subtitles from spidey

2
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:20,200
My name is Steve.

3
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,160
And as a child...
...you're in for the minds.

4
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,980
But it didn't really work out.

5
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,680
So I did a terrible thing.

6
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,880
I grew up.

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,780
And just as I expected...it was a
massive bummer.

8
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,380
I really put myself out there.

9
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,920
And it totally blew up in my face.

10
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,160
It was the kind of life that made a man
stare into his potatoes.

11
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,920
And then I remembered...

12
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,900
...I couldn't give up on my dream.

13
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
Not yet.

14
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,020
The lines!

15
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,740
So I bought a pickaxe and a sweet helmet.

16
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
And this time...

17
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
...I was unstoppable.

18
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,280
Turns out my adventure...

19
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,480
...was just beginning.

20
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,640
I've mined my brains out... ...until
I found two mysterious artifacts.

21
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,220
This thingy... ...and
that tool thingy.

22
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,160
And when I put those two
thingies together... ...you guessed it.

23
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,740
It opened a portal to another world.

24
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,940
This place blew my mind.

25
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,160
I've never seen anything like it.

26
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,060
Wow!

27
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
Turns out it was the place I've been
looking for my whole life.

28
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,780
A world where anything you
can imagine... ...you can create.

29
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,160
This is my first house.

30
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,060
My second house.

31
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,680
And my third house made entirely of sheep
wool.

32
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
My house!

33
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,140
Life was good.

34
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,480
The only thing missing...

35
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,660
...was a friend to share it with.

36
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,080
And then the super angry wolf showed up.

37
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,700
So I chained him with a crusty femur bone.

38
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,460
Yeah!

39
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,940
Whoa!

40
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,740
Ah, boy!

41
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,700
Dennis, you like a scratchy scratchy
scratch on a nutty.

42
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,280
With him by my side, my confidence soared.

43
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,940
Woo-hoo!

44
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,440
Together we built endless masterpieces.

45
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,680
The more I built, the better I got.

46
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Dennis!

47
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,520
Back on the sand!

48
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
Whoa!

49
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Whoa!

50
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,900
Turns out, pandas love to party...

51
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
...and cows!

52
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,360
Life was perfect.

53
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,340
And the year's simply flew by...

54
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,280
...until one day I came across some
strange ruins.

55
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,150
Flint and Steve!

56
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,780
Turns out, we just opened the portal to a
totally new dimension.

57
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,300
So, never.

58
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,780
There was no joy for creativity at all.

59
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Dennis!

60
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,060
These piglet broods had mined this realm
into oblivion.

61
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,460
Led by Mt.

62
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,300
Gosha, the evil piglet sorceress who ruled
the place.

63
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,200
Who are you and why are you so proud?

64
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,600
Leave the dog!

65
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,600
Take three instead!

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,580
Nine days!

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,720
I'll take both of you!

68
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,780
And at all!

69
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,540
Let's get one thing straight!

70
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
Where I come from?

71
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,300
We call this ew!

72
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Save them!

73
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:27,860
Mt.

74
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,240
Gosha had finally got what she'd always
wanted.

75
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,840
The orb of dominance.

76
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,660
The most powerful cube shaped orb in the
entire universe.

77
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,280
Let's set up your pace!

78
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,600
With this soul, I will pillage the
overworld in all of its gold will be ours!

79
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,960
I couldn't let this happen.

80
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,040
The overworld had saved me.

81
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,340
And now I had to try to save it!

82
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,960
We have to stop our Dennis!

83
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,180
So we escaped!

84
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,560
And stole back the orb!

85
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,640
A roundling of a kite!

86
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,580
Five heavens!

87
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,940
Bring me that orb!

88
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,140
Great, Dennis!

89
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,480
Take this to earth!

90
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,800
Follow my set for 149 Holy Old Drive.

91
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,900
You got that boy?

92
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,580
Who would pour?

93
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,200
You're the last hope for this world!

94
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,000
A round!

95
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Oh, stop boy!

96
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,760
A round!

97
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,980
You got this, Dennis!

98
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
I love you!

99
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
A round!

100
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,310
Dennis was a hero that day.

101
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,950
He ran like the wind.

102
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,650
I didn't know if I'd ever see him again.

103
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,110
But we had a world to save.

104
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,290
So he ran all the way back to my house on
earth.

105
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,370
And hit the most powerful, objective
existence under my water bed.

106
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:52,570
As long as the orb stays hidden,
the overworld will be safe.

107
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,320
I just pray some doofus doesn't find it.

108
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:40,740
In the late 1980s, Garrett Garrison took
the gaming world by storm, becoming the

109
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,020
undisputed champion of the hit arcade
game, Hunt City Rampage.

110
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,820
His mastery of this two-player co-op
shocked the world.

111
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,580
His effective use of the garbage toss move,
earned him the nickname The Garbage Man.

112
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,670
He became the envy of
the gaming world, after

113
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,840
landing a loop with its
six-figure deal with Sisler.

114
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,450
Thanks for sure.

115
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,850
This kid had it all.

116
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,330
Garrett the Garbage Man, Garrettson?

117
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,350
No autographs.

118
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,170
Have a nice day.

119
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,940
Garrett the Garbage Man.

120
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,140
What do we owe this passion?

121
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,260
Whether they got them the storage options
for fun?

122
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,540
I'm a businessman, though.

123
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,260
An investor.

124
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,680
Well, I'm about to shovel some coal into
your true-to-trane.

125
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,700
You're a bit of love this next year now.

126
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,620
It's got a water bed.

127
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,400
It's got some pick-outs.

128
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,320
It's got a huge game, mixed nuts.

129
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,600
It's got an array of unisex turquoise
glasses.

130
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,850
That sounds terrible.

131
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,260
I think it's also got a 1978 Atari cosmos.

132
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,800
1978 Atari cosmos.

133
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,940
That's what I said.

134
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh, thank you for the freaking fortune.

135
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Thank you.

136
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,220
If you make this happen for me, I'll be
strong to consider hanging out with you.

137
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
You serious, bro?

138
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Yep.

139
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,900
Two big both of those icons out there in
the wild.

140
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,280
We're in unisex turquoise glasses.

141
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,470
Oh, boy, that's going to cause it.

142
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,800
The ladies aren't going to know what this
is.

143
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,960
You can't get to hand or press under on
it.

144
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,180
I'll make all your weird family with
dreams come true.

145
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Yeah.

146
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Two loose cannons.

147
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,660
We're in turquoise glasses.

148
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,360
Let's do it.

149
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,600
We got five hundred dollars.

150
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,260
Five hundred dollars.

151
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,560
We got five hundred dollars.

152
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
We got six.

153
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,640
Do we have six hundred dollars?

154
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,120
That's six hundred dollars over here.

155
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,780
I'll give you here.

156
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
Eight hundred dollars.

157
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,860
Eight hundred dollars.

158
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,160
Eight hundred dollars.

159
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,460
Eight fifty.

160
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Do we hear eight fifty?

161
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:49,820
Do we do it?

162
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,400
Do we hear any more?

163
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,330
Do we hear not under nine hundred dollars?

164
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,720
Or what?

165
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,660
Nine hundred dollars.

166
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,100
We're going twice and nine hundred
dollars.

167
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,320
Three times and so.

168
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,960
The hometown hero.

169
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,940
The german's man, Garrison, for nine
hundred dollars.

170
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,320
Oh, I'm careful for about six months.

171
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
Yeah!

172
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,540
Home deposit.

173
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,540
Cosmic.

174
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
There.

175
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,640
Where is it?

176
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,180
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
I didn't check the box.

178
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,240
Come on, stop it.

179
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Hurry, Hurry, Hurry!

180
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,920
Let me hear you, sir.

181
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,320
Hurry, here, here, here!

182
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm up against you, man.

183
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,420
My story.

184
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,540
It's just...

185
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,340
I need a win, man.

186
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,600
I need a win.

187
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,600
That's all everyone.

188
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,860
This man has no respect for the stores
community.

189
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,490
Look, chunless is not my first choice
either, but it was mom's dying wish for us

190
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,210
to live here.

191
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,330
Alright, that's all I have to do there.

192
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,030
Yeah, I read something online.

193
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,910
This kind of sucks.

194
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,990
Anyways, right, it's
super low and I've got a

195
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,770
full-time kick here, so
it's not really enough.

196
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,390
We can turn down right now.

197
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,050
Yeah, I get it.

198
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,090
Look, I think you're really gonna like it
here.

199
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,670
Oh, what's going on with that?

200
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:07,170
Oh, my gosh, I read words.

201
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,310
I can't wait to tell you the truth.

202
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,360
Alright, this is the new neighborhood.

203
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860
That was built.

204
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,220
It's so nice to meet you.

205
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,640
Yeah, that's so chill.

206
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,080
You knew bosses such this.

207
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,980
Oh, yeah, people love working with you.

208
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,860
You can add a potato chip factory.

209
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,160
Yeah, well, I'm running their socials for
a little bit.

210
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,240
I said I'd get their follower account past
75.

211
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,440
Nice!

212
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
You must be in me.

213
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,520
Nice to meet you.

214
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm done.

215
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,920
Hi.

216
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,140
Why is there an alpaca hangout in your
car?

217
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,480
Well, real estate's my mommy hustles.

218
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,160
I'll also do some mobile zoos stuff on the
side.

219
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,560
Uh-huh.

220
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
I got a run.

221
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,480
Call me if you need anything.

222
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Oh, sorry.

223
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,180
Really sorry about your mom.

224
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
It's really great what you do.

225
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,480
I hope you know that.

226
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,960
Thank you.

227
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:04,220
Check it out.

228
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,180
I made you mom's signature tater top
breakfast pizza.

229
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,760
So you can hand out slices on your first
day.

230
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,120
I thought you wanted me to see him normal.

231
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,180
I thought I am.

232
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,100
I got you some body spray.

233
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,840
Signature sense are huge.

234
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,520
here.

235
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,880
Velvet mischief.

236
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,240
You're gonna want to spray it and then
walk into it.

237
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
Don't be too direct.

238
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
It's really powerful.

239
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
Love you.

240
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,920
Love you too.

241
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,320
It feels like banana burning.

242
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,320
Your story is really cool.

243
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,700
Yeah, I know.

244
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,020
Look at your everything in particular.

245
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,000
No, I'm just checking some stuff out.

246
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,900
Non-committal.

247
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,140
Classic was your maintainer.

248
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,620
I can help.

249
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,340
It's starting a mentorship program for
people who want to win at the game of life.

250
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
50 bucks an hour.

251
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:24,740
Cool.

252
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,640
I think that's what you went at nice.

253
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,740
That's literally the answer I charge money
for.

254
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,400
Tots.

255
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,100
Through the breakfast pizza.

256
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,120
This is your main app.

257
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,320
This is a handout size set.

258
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,360
It's going to make friends.

259
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,280
Well, that's for day one, don't stick.

260
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
I also noticed that you're wearing built
in mischief.

261
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's a wonderful cologne.

262
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,860
I strongly believe that every young man
trips don't stick with your scent.

263
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,580
I don't think I applied very much.

264
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,740
Listen, I'm gonna give you a hot garbage
too.

265
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,280
Friendship is like a puzzle.

266
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,620
Sometimes you think you need lots of
pieces to be cool.

267
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,680
And sometimes it's just one piece to be
cool.

268
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,360
And people will be like, that's not a
puzzle.

269
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
That's a picture.

270
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,080
They have already speak to.

271
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,460
Okay, well, I've got to go to school.

272
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,220
Or overnight, just leave the pizza.

273
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,580
Oh, right.

274
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,920
What's with this paint said on?

275
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,780
What is an amin' is commissioned for you?

276
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,440
Oh, a handreaguer just so thrilled to have
you.

277
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,680
You're the first student
to enroll here ever since

278
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,340
that article came out
at the school rankings.

279
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,640
Anyway.

280
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,660
I'm vice principal Marlene.

281
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
I've been open to work.

282
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,240
You probably heard that my husband
Clemente recently divorced me.

283
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,880
And to be honest, First, I expected it to
hurt more than it does.

284
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,960
You know, the fire went out on our
marriage 20 years ago.

285
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,740
But we stuck it up for the dogs.

286
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,820
Okay, let's get you to first class.

287
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,130
Good morning!

288
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,400
Just a little something about myself.

289
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,980
I teach Jim, I teach him.

290
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,580
But naturally, I'm living in nightmares.

291
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,240
Okay?

292
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,120
I wouldn't wish my life when they were
century.

293
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,320
Last year, I claimed $4,000 on my tax
return.

294
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,880
I also have several pending lawsuits.

295
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Okay?

296
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,260
But most of my money is tied up in a drone
kiosk at the mall.

297
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,080
Okay, time for you to do a still life.

298
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540
One orange?

299
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
One banana.

300
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,770
Let's get out for your people.

301
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,910
What is this?

302
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,460
Don't you know what a still life is?

303
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,040
That means you just draw the theme.

304
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,840
Did you saw him the next time?

305
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,300
It just happened never worked.

306
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,560
It's got a hope of actually.

307
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,580
My dad said that has been debunked.

308
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,530
Check it out!

309
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,230
New kid thinks he's a rocket scientist.

310
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,240
But to be rocket scientists, so prove it.

311
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,570
All right, count as to him, guys.

312
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,930
One, four, three, two, one.

313
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,910
Okay, so I know that we're all very
excited about the new rebrand.

314
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,070
But I don't think you should call your
party bags so it sucks.

315
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,030
I was never here, okay?

316
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,570
Well, the good news is nobody died.

317
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,590
But the bad news is you've destroyed the
American potato dichotomy.

318
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,310
I'm sorry, okay?

319
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,710
This could be grounds for expulsion,
Henry.

320
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,490
I need you to call your guardian.

321
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,340
Hey, Mr. garbage man.

322
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:47,920
It's Henry.

323
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,740
The camp with the tater-tat breakfast
pizza.

324
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
Oh, yeah.

325
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,780
I have a weird favorite ask.

326
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,240
Could you come to my school and pretend to
be my uncle?

327
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,620
No way.

328
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,160
I don't do that.

329
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,080
I am 26 bucks.

330
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,820
I'm Henry Zunkle.

331
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
You?

332
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,700
A trash bag?

333
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,260
There's some garbage man.

334
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,960
Garbage man, huh?

335
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,800
You can bag me up and take me to the curb
anytime.

336
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,960
But you got to punchy the lid.

337
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,020
Because I've got a lot of raccoons in
there.

338
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,380
I remember the horses used to complete
idiot.

339
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,020
It's don't get it.

340
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
It should have worked.

341
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,140
Not this race, but it probably just caused
my sister her job.

342
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,740
I was super creative.

343
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,300
Guess I'm not the only true talent in the
jugglers.

344
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,220
Hey, yeah, I was just going to juv you
mind if I get this photo back.

345
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,560
Keep it going wrong, trees, and I don't
think there was any more.

346
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,220
Well, you can have my book, too.

347
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Some dumbassers.

348
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,840
What's this stupid carrot?

349
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
The carrot?

350
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,740
That's a new way to build crap.

351
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,120
I don't know what it does.

352
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Hey, instructions.

353
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,220
Never under any circumstances can bind the
orb and crystal.

354
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,660
Sorry.

355
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:04,560
I tried everything.

356
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,780
I didn't know what was to call.

357
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,220
It was okay.

358
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
What's going on?

359
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,040
I'm resmitting.

360
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,960
I tried the school.

361
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,380
I tried to spawn a million times.

362
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,980
He's not answering.

363
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,560
He was supposed to tell hours ago.

364
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,360
I thought he was stupid and attention.

365
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,900
I'm going to check you to chip.

366
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,260
That was him.

367
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Oh my gosh.

368
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,580
I can't believe this were here for one
day.

369
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,140
And he's already even down building.

370
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,260
Yeah, I don't know.

371
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,000
He's fine.

372
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,160
He's just planning on a band in mind,
Chef.

373
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
What?

374
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
Come on.

375
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
I'll drive.

376
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:34,830
You can fee Mr. Scribbles
this quest to carrot

377
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,600
if you want to keep
that pretty face of yours.

378
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,620
What happened?

379
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Who came here?

380
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,270
You go first.

381
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,350
I'll come with six.

382
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,530
Ranger, whatever.

383
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,610
Oh my gosh.

384
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Henry!

385
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
What?

386
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,220
I'm stuck.

387
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
He's my new mentor.

388
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
Move me.

389
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Nice!

390
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
Go!

391
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,380
What's up?

392
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Wait,

393
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,100
who are you again?

394
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,820
Get the garbage, Rangers.

395
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,700
Get ready here, 19, 18, 18.

396
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Whatever.

397
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,700
I better think about it.

398
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,280
What the?

399
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,340
That's what I think it is.

400
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,620
It could be our first quest giver.

401
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,840
I'll do the talking.

402
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
All right!

403
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,160
Come here, you idiot!

404
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,510
Come back here!

405
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Let

406
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,400
me be very clear.

407
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:46,710
What are you making?

408
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,310
Come closer.

409
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,470
It's all right.

410
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,890
Come on, I'm not going to play it yet.

411
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,110
Oh, I'm not pretty.

412
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,610
We can't move into every final goal.

413
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,730
I'm fine.

414
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,830
Get me, get me, get me.

415
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,850
Oh, I'm fine.

416
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,150
Come on, come on.

417
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,170
Go, Sh received.

418
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:40,410
My leash was higher here when I did no
one, was to waste time on earth or leisure.

419
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,690
The war has returned.

420
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,570
You get me?

421
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,390
Dennis?

422
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,930
You stole it from me, and now you will
retrieve it.

423
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,050
It would be a privilege, my leash.

424
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,730
Be going to unbind you now.

425
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,150
Don't do anything.

426
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,150
It's stupid.

427
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,050
Of course not, you can trust this little
dungeon pup.

428
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,730
Let me just speak about it!

429
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,490
Go ahead, strike me down.

430
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,330
My piglins will make a meal of your
beautiful wolf.

431
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,170
How do I know you're telling a truth?

432
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,730
There's only one way to find out.

433
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,570
The orb, for your little dog's life.

434
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,570
Ah!

435
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,450
Ah!

436
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,180
Ah!

437
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,690
Ah!

438
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,940
What are you doing?

439
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,640
Come on, Henry.

440
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
We're going home.

441
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,420
Is that so quick to anyone else?

442
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Yeah!

443
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
All right, everyone.

444
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,050
Stay calm, rely.

445
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,270
Free garbage tip.

446
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,030
Fear is just weakness, hijacking your
body's cockpit.

447
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,190
What in the hell?

448
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:49,310
If that happens... You can say biocon
DS to your body plane's navigation system.

449
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,350
What?

450
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,870
Yeah, garbage man isn't speaking English
or Espin, y'all.

451
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,430
What am I doing here?

452
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,540
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

453
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

454
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,660
Who are you?

455
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,820
I... And Steve... Who are you people?

456
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,360
Where's Dennis?

457
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,500
Dennis, who's... we don't know any Dennis.

458
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,600
Then how'd you get that?

459
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Hey!

460
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,540
Align the chut-choke.

461
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
It's my property.

462
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,340
Do you even know what that is?

463
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,240
It's the orb of dominance.

464
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
It's a cube.

465
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,110
Okay, ho-ho!

466
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,660
You people seriously have no idea what
you're dealing with.

467
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,060
Hand it over and no one gets hurt.

468
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,120
No way!

469
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,780
Okay, we need the phone to get home.

470
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,160
I hate to take a big fat dumparoo on your
plans, but you can't get home.

471
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,280
Well, what do you mean we can't get home?

472
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,200
Not without the earth crystal.

473
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,820
You made that little box in there,
garbage man busted it!

474
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
Uh-huh.

475
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,680
Hey, Ma'am.

476
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,080
Why don't you hold these?

477
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,260
You got those good photo bars here.

478
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,620
Are you trying that we're stuck here?

479
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,220
Yes!

480
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,420
Unless you get the earth crystal it's your
only way home.

481
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,360
There's only one way you could ever
replace it at the woodland mansion,

482
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,540
but going there would get you all killed.

483
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,160
So would sing here!

484
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,440
Very enough.

485
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,260
Listen, I can get you home, but then you
got the earth crystal.

486
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,260
There's only one way you
could ever replace it at the

487
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,260
woodland mansion, but going
there would get you all killed.

488
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,260
But so would sing here!

489
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,260
Very enough.

490
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,500
Listen, I can get you home, but then you
got the earth crystal.

491
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,020
So, what are you going to do with it?

492
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
None of the attention!

493
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,080
So, what do you say?

494
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,220
Do we have a deal?

495
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,020
He did just kill like Pawny's armies.

496
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,800
Well, I 15, good.

497
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Okay.

498
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,240
Alright, Steve, I need two conditions.

499
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
One, always address me because I'm a
leader.

500
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,720
Two, if you double
cross us, I will crack

501
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,340
your compost with my
butchings like a walnut.

502
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,840
This guy is such a toolbug.

503
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,360
I'm so sorry.

504
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,920
We just met this man.

505
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
And he's not the leader.

506
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,600
Well, it looks like Dr. Swannstein here
just got himself a deal.

507
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,980
Oh, you guys.

508
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,140
Alright.

509
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,920
First, we need to load up on some gear or
we're all going to die.

510
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,480
Let's go to mid-port village.

511
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,760
She's got some boxes in mind.

512
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,220
Watch.

513
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,950
I've got a secret staff's belief that'll
help us survive the woodland mansion.

514
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:24,980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

515
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,320
are these guys?

516
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,060
Oh, these dots?

517
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
They're the villagers.

518
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,980
They're total pacifists and vegetarians.

519
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,100
You don't bug them.

520
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,260
They won't bug you.

521
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,920
They just like to kill, treat,
and eat butt loads of bread.

522
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,220
They love crush it alone.

523
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,600
So, we built all this?

524
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,240
Yeah, most of it.

525
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,700
But the good step you see is all me.

526
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,720
Whoa, see some kind of king?

527
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
No.

528
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,660
That's a legend.

529
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,380
Kid?

530
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:54,960
Anything you can do.

531
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,000
You can dream about here.

532
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,200
You can make zero limits.

533
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,820
You know what I'm talking about.

534
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,340
That was your tower, right?

535
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah.

536
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,880
Pretty killer for a first build.

537
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,380
You're pretty protein-like pronto.

538
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,560
I got just the place for the rest.

539
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,920
I've got goose pimples just walking up on
it.

540
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,260
You ever wonder what happens when you mix
hot lava and chicken?

541
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,460
I did.

542
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,960
And you're about to find out.

543
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:25,860
I have a small business, too.

544
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,480
The one thing I try to do is order my
jingle suck butt.

545
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,650
I'm not a little wind-like big Steve here.

546
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,290
I crave heat and I crave pain.

547
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:48,310
Here are my words.

548
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,240
That chicken was just cooked in hot lava.

549
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,470
Let it cool down, man.

550
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740
Not bad.

551
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,480
Garbage, man.

552
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,560
You're a big-time idiot.

553
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,630
What is it?

554
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,510
Get out of here!

555
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,300
Get out of here!

556
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,100
Hey, Melgosha.

557
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,260
What's going on?

558
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,900
You're all dungeon buddy, Steve.

559
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,220
He's betrayed us.

560
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,520
Well, that's a bummer.

561
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,040
The orbit's been full round late.

562
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,300
My spice tell me he has taken them to his
lava, chicken chain.

563
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,600
No way!

564
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,420
I love that place.

565
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,820
I love that!

566
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,680
Shat!

567
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,920
Take your finest warrior!

568
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,480
Bring me that orb and take it up!

569
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,860
So, you want me to end his life or
whatever?

570
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
Are you serious?

571
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,300
What do you think I'm talking about?

572
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,540
Okay.

573
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,100
I was just kinda confused there for a
second.

574
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,100
Take us clean the water and dump some of
mine.

575
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,220
Your majesty, I don't think this is going
to be enough to go around.

576
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,240
No worries.

577
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,440
Drink up, guys.

578
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,720
You don't want to dump a pipe there,
which is tiny steps, okay?

579
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay, so how do we find this woodland
mansion thing?

580
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,240
Over the mountains, into the dark forest,
right beyond the massive red shrubs.

581
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,140
The massive red shrubs.

582
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:49,680
We need to find a real map, Steve.

583
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,660
This place is dangerous and I need to get
my brother out of here.

584
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,810
It seems like he's having a pretty good
time.

585
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,940
Look, your brother has a gift.

586
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
You know that, right?

587
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,360
You should let him explore it.

588
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,260
Creativity in this world is key to
survival.

589
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,890
He will, in the real world, things are a
little bit different.

590
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,260
Creative kids get picked last for Jane.

591
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,050
They sit at the bummer lunch table and
they get bullied.

592
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,800
Don't I know it?

593
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,600
Do you even realize what he did back home?

594
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,620
He blew up, chuggy the chip.

595
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,600
Maybe I belong in this rock.

596
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,360
Henry, that's not what I meant.

597
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,240
It's not what I was saying at all.

598
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,940
Just so you know, I'm more of a sister to
hang me than I ever did.

599
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:44,530
Look, I found one of these big head of
looking dudes that sells maps.

600
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,830
Looks the chip.

601
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Come on.

602
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,710
Welcome to the stash.

603
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,970
T&T, the fire will rise.

604
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:59,330
Also good for propulsion, boots of
swiftness, diamond armor, full set,

605
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,490
and plates for days.

606
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,430
Everything will need to make it to
woodland mansion.

607
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,230
Wow.

608
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,450
Looks loud, bro.

609
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,390
Look, but don't touch.

610
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,910
Those are some of my favorite trame
shirts.

611
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,120
What's this, junkie?

612
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,100
That is an ender pearl.

613
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,220
Teleports you to wherever you throw it.

614
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Yeah, right.

615
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,920
And that was the only one I had.

616
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,540
no biggie.

617
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,620
Almost died fighting an enderment for it.

618
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,960
Come with me.

619
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,280
This is a crafting table.

620
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,780
Here's how it works.

621
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,740
You place these elements in different
patterns.

622
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,440
You got yourself a seed blade.

623
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,450
You want to see a blade.

624
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,880
I'll show you a blade.

625
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,060
Yeah.

626
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,560
That's okay, bud.

627
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,440
Buckets you're useful here.

628
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,520
Yeah, they're cool, Garrett.

629
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,520
Yeah, I know.

630
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,780
That's why I made them.

631
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,040
They're buck chuckets.

632
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,780
Uh, they're what?

633
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,000
Hey, can I trust anything else?

634
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,480
I'm so rootin' totally.

635
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,200
But you had touched the whole time?

636
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,160
Yeah, sorry.

637
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,200
The top launcher.

638
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:03,800
Dude, you just took boring junk from the
real world to create something amazing.

639
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,360
That is next level.

640
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,970
I can't believe the top launcher when
you're done.

641
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:09,240
Yeah.

642
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:09,780
Sweet.

643
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,020
He's cute.

644
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,640
What's that's you for a second?

645
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,820
Sure thing.

646
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,540
What's that?

647
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:23,760
You know that note, you know for the old
one.

648
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,700
What about the riches?

649
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,800
I read it.

650
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:28,680
Yeah.

651
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,760
There's riches everywhere.

652
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,520
Keep a fat stash of diamonds at the
redstone mines.

653
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,280
So this treasure goes on the way to this
mansion place.

654
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,240
Not really.

655
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,980
It's a major beach or a plus.

656
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,240
The mines can be perilous.

657
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:41,390
We can assemble for you, Steve.

658
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,520
No diamonds in the hand.

659
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,600
He's going to stepping in.

660
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,270
Good day.

661
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,830
We need a map to the Woodland mansion.

662
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,810
You see the map.

663
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,120
John, someone's going now.

664
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,220
Now, go sit down across me.

665
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,380
We just need a coffee.

666
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,920
You know this guy?

667
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,260
Yeah, we have to get him to the dungeon
stuff.

668
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,300
You see it's nice, but he's a cow.

669
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,480
Wow.

670
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,260
You look good.

671
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,420
You have this way?

672
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,840
Stand back, boys.

673
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,700
This peak is fine.

674
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,100
I'm tired of eating some of the glory.

675
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,260
This peak is fine.

676
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,460
I'm tired of eating some of the glory.

677
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,460
This peak is fine.

678
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,260
I

679
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,040
think he's going to take this guy.

680
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,160
I know.

681
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,730
The car is over, bud.

682
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,630
Just give me the horn.

683
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,590
You saved your foot.

684
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,770
That's what happened.

685
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:41,850
Take me later.

686
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,290
We got to get to the red part.

687
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,790
Follow me!

688
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:57,830
We have to go.

689
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,940
Let's go, my hair.

690
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Just relax.

691
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,580
Let my ex guide you with me on the way.

692
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,320
What?

693
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,400
Fuck

694
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,500
it.

695
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,660
Okay.

696
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,100
I'm still some negative space back there.

697
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,220
Please don't know it.

698
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,860
I'm trying to close the game.

699
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,660
I'm going to squeeze for your safety.

700
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I understand.

701
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,920
This is the worst boat I've ever seen.

702
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,420
I'm sorry.

703
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,840
I have to do what I'm doing.

704
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,100
Let's go.

705
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:20,940
Oh my god.

706
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,820
Oh my god.

707
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:25,040
Are you all right?

708
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,340
Your head is huge.

709
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,920
You're not supposed to see me,
are you?

710
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,540
Because everyone wants to see me once I
hit them with my deep frontier key.

711
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,320
Oh, mom.

712
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:38,980
How about this?

713
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,520
What if I just take you to dinner?

714
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,120
Would you like to put it dinner?

715
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,180
You guys are talking with you buddy.

716
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,660
Hank and I want some answers.

717
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,080
Like how are we going to stop those pigs?

718
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,100
And why is my ears full?

719
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,580
Yeah, and who's that evil source as you
were talking about?

720
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,600
Look!

721
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,360
The sorceress is a pigling queen called
Nalgosha.

722
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,540
Those are her minions.

723
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,840
She rules over them in a dark hellscape
called the Nether.

724
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,400
And I always keep a chunk of gorgons all
in my front pocket.

725
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,400
That's my best friend's favorite snaggy
snack.

726
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,120
What best friend Dennis?

727
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,900
The Nalgosha's path to villainy started
the way these things often do.

728
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,000
During the semi-finals of the Nether's Got
Talent.

729
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,060
The Nalgosha always dreamed of being a
world-class dancer.

730
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,400
Her moves were pretty out there.

731
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,760
No one in the Nether was ready for it.

732
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,380
Eat crushed her.

733
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,840
Why tell you about all that tense?

734
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,360
You deserve to say it.

735
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,140
Create too many more never make you happy.

736
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,780
But you know what will?

737
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,380
Go!

738
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,940
Now, go find some.

739
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,220
So from that day forward, she denounced
all forms of creativity.

740
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,520
If she ever gets that orb, she'll block
out the sun.

741
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,220
Nether what would flourish?

742
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,410
This beautiful world and everything in it
will wither and die.

743
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,910
And you were going to give it to her?

744
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,020
Great idea.

745
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,700
Not going to give it to her, but I need
that orb for leverage.

746
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,300
I'm safe, Dennis.

747
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,440
Come.

748
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:24,200
Woodland Mansion is just beyond the
redstone muddles.

749
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,960
We can go over or through.

750
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,680
Well, that was fast.

751
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:31,960
Through will be faster.

752
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:43,220
You had failed me for the last time.

753
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,140
I'm really sorry about that.

754
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,940
Bring out the beast!

755
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:52,400
What do you mean you deserve to put the
bride in?

756
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,360
What reason did you get it?

757
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,840
Look, everybody knows it wasn't my best
day.

758
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,420
But I'm really trying to send some new
clothes.

759
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,520
My ultimate with it.

760
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,760
There it is.

761
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,480
Kill him!

762
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,860
Wait, does this mean you're firing?

763
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,100
Where are we going?

764
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,280
You'll find the ringlings.

765
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,980
And bring me down!

766
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:40,780
We are so lost.

767
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,060
My one job was to protect him and I blow
it.

768
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,900
I'm not going to let anything happen.

769
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:58,080
I'm just going to cut out this parenting
stuff.

770
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,800
Wish I could have been a kid for a little
bit longer or two.

771
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,200
It's so bad feeling if you could have done
anything.

772
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,320
I hear you.

773
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:11,900
Being a grown-up sucks.

774
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,620
You've got all these responsibilities and
you just stop chasing your dreams.

775
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:23,700
You think I would like to have a 15
hustles?

776
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,160
It was just on now.

777
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,680
I think this one just needs some TLC.

778
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,520
Yeah?

779
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:41,980
You like bones?

780
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,680
You like bones?

781
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:58,130
I cannot believe you just did that one.

782
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,130
This is...

783
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,670
Dennis?

784
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,670
Steve, Dennis?

785
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:05,470
Yeah.

786
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:07,410
Can you take us to her?

787
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,550
Who knew that?

788
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,230
I think this might be our way to the
women's mansion.

789
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,430
Just follow her, bitch.

790
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:22,030
Right, this way, gentlemen.

791
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:24,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

792
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,240
Looky, looky here.

793
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:28,110
Welcome to the redstone line.

794
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:31,290
See that glowy stuff?

795
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:32,710
That's redstone.

796
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:33,830
Got synergy.

797
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:37,130
You can build some crazy contraptions with
it.

798
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,430
I thought you said this was a diamond
mine.

799
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,950
Easy big dog.

800
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,250
They're here.

801
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:44,410
Be careful.

802
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,870
I said some booby traps a long time ago.

803
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,630
To keep a life on the remember where they
are.

804
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,340
Thanks, Garrett.

805
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:21,300
That's what I'm talking about.

806
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,400
Steve delivers the goods.

807
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,400
Did you guys plan this?

808
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,420
I'm sorry, Andre.

809
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Yeah, I am.

810
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,080
I'm not.

811
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,040
What the heck?

812
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:34,340
What is that, man?

813
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,440
Overlast.

814
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,940
No, you can be in the imaginary.

815
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,780
Too far?

816
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:43,740
Oh, no.

817
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,440
There's a what?

818
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,380
What does that mean?

819
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,560
I'm

820
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:57,330
going for the brain, man.

821
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:58,830
Run for the mind charge!

822
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:24,640
You're a husky low chance.

823
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,680
We're going to need a redstone boot back.

824
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,540
What's it sound like?

825
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,440
What's the problem, man?

826
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,280
We didn't need those stupid diamonds.

827
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:57,200
I swear you were literally the most
selfish person I've met.

828
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:57,920
Whatever.

829
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,380
I need them.

830
01:04:59,480 --> 01:04:59,960
Okay?

831
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:02,990
I need the diamonds, because I need the
money, because I'm a poke.

832
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:06,280
You wouldn't know anything about that.

833
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,880
My life sucks, Ken.

834
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,040
I'm a freaking loser.

835
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,200
There I said.

836
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,160
I know it looks like I'm going to put
together, right?

837
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:18,200
It's smooth, funny, bilingual.

838
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,020
I'm late.

839
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,080
Too old, full-time.

840
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,920
That's not the reality.

841
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:29,790
I'm not doing well.

842
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,480
I'm bad.

843
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,840
I must not pay.

844
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,180
I'm going to lose everything.

845
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,020
You must have the worst part.

846
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,740
I'm alone.

847
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,640
You're new.

848
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,680
What was your friend?

849
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,740
Sorry about your finances.

850
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,320
Shut up, Steve.

851
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,140
Oh, no, thank you.

852
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,000
You know, I got to tell you, I'm having a
great time.

853
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:31,320
I recently got divorced from my husband
Clemente, and...

854
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,660
the main reason is, you know, he didn't
have any personality.

855
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:38,740
Not like you.

856
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,340
Are you finished?

857
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,100
No, I think he's Swedish.

858
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:45,170
But we're done with our meal.

859
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,380
There it is.

860
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,860
The woodland mansion.

861
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,880
We're going to get in there and get the
earth crystal and get you guys home.

862
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,100
Follow me.

863
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,780
Check this out.

864
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:58,630
Let's do this.

865
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,600
May close attention to Papa Steve.

866
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,880
The woodland mansion has three floors.

867
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,580
The first floor is loaded with finger k
days.

868
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,160
Axmer to where, basically.

869
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,980
Why is it dirt floor on the first floor?

870
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,140
I'm very confused.

871
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,950
I was trying to make
three floors, but I

872
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:15,040
didn't have time to
make, like, a doll house.

873
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,760
The second floor crawls with the focus.

874
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,280
They wield powerful dark magic.

875
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,160
This is the worst model I've ever seen.

876
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,260
Garrett, stop talking.

877
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,740
We're trying to figure out a plan.

878
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,120
How long have you met him before?

879
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,280
I just got mad at you.

880
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,040
Please don't be mad at me for this,
okay?

881
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,420
But I accidentally stole the ore.

882
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
Why are you not?

883
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

884
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

885
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

886
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

887
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

888
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

889
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

890
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

891
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

892
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

893
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

894
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

895
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

896
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

897
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

898
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

899
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

900
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

901
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

902
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I'm not.

903
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,720
I'm not not your crafting.

904
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,340
We cool now?

905
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,540
You are literally the worst person in the
entire world.

906
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,020
Guys, both of you eyes on my denim.

907
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:41,220
Strange!

908
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:41,960
Third floor.

909
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,560
House is Luke chamber.

910
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,980
That's where they have a crystal lead.

911
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:51,050
But it's guarded byeng... What ever
you do to look at them in the eye..

912
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:52,280
the fire that brings out.

913
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,520
Okay, Will I can build
stairs to the second floor,

914
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,360
sneak of the window
and snag the earth crystal?

915
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,140
It's a great idea, Heath, but t drought
off, we're gonna need a pretty sweet.

916
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:03,520
You know what can work on these guys?

917
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,540
It sounds crazy.

918
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:07,620
Hit me.

919
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,470
What are you doing?

920
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,470
What's going on here?

921
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,390
That's a little birthday party.

922
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:18,970
Looks like it's everyone's birthday.

923
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:39,700
Hey, you gotta be kidding me.

924
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,600
You gotta be kidding me.

925
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,760
You got this dark eye.

926
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:44,640
Reach down, Dave.

927
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,740
You're the surplus technology.

928
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:48,940
Let's do it on Steve.

929
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,560
It's some kind of statistic vindicator
fight club.

930
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,960
I've heard of these, but I've never seen
one.

931
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,400
They want me to fight the chicken?

932
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,400
Hey!

933
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,520
It's a fight to the jackpot.

934
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:44,110
I'm

935
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:17,850
sorry, little buddy.

936
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,390
Don't fall for a cartoon!

937
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:21,650
That baby's done the whole of a demon.

938
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:24,070
No, you're not a demon, are you?

939
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:26,550
You're a cute little bugger face.

940
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:28,810
Paint your little head.

941
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:55,120
That's what friends do together.

942
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,520
Hey!

943
01:13:58,590 --> 01:13:59,790
Did you get the earth crystal?

944
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,360
Yeah, I got it.

945
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,800
Let's get out of this hell hole.

946
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:22,940
You tell me, you really thought you could
defeat my right home.

947
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,100
You smash, I built a new one.

948
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:32,100
Now, gosh, you're running this over.

949
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:33,620
You're wrong.

950
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:35,370
It's just beginning.

951
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:39,780
No!

952
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,460
Fire!

953
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:43,700
No!

954
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,840
We have worked!

955
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,760
The ice cream!

956
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,220
See the pigments.

957
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,080
They're going to blow this green sky.

958
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,520
I'm sorry.

959
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:03,660
Fire!

960
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,660
Fire!

961
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:10,100
It's hard to hear.

962
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:21,400
You're a scary trap!

963
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:23,520
No, Steve, get him out of here!

964
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,740
Go ahead!

965
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,320
Save your sister and get home!

966
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,960
Derek, you don't have to do that!

967
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,660
No, get him home, Steve!

968
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,040
Tell my story and song!

969
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,180
Keep it metal, keep it heavy.

970
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:35,760
We're going somewhere.

971
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,060
Science, we're going home.

972
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,200
I love the world.

973
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,640
Steve, come on!

974
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,270
I can hear her, huh?

975
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:29,810
I can hear her.

976
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:31,910
Dennis, all right?

977
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:33,370
Dennis!

978
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:35,130
I'll hold with you!

979
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:39,370
I can't really hear you!

980
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:43,180
Oh, my, my, my!

981
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:45,740
Oh, oh, oh!

982
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,140
How'd you find me?

983
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,240
He's one of them.

984
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:48,440
He's one of them.

985
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:48,900
He's one of them.

986
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,480
He's one of them.

987
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:49,660
He's one of them.

988
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,740
He's one of them.

989
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:55,720
He's one of them.

990
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:57,980
It's me, okay?

991
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,980
He's fine.

992
01:16:58,980 --> 01:16:59,980
He's just resting.

993
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:01,540
Good.

994
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,500
It's a pretty rough crash landing.

995
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,000
Wait a minute.

996
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,280
Where are we?

997
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:12,910
You guys won't make this!

998
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:13,730
Yeah!

999
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:16,730
When I messin' around, we got the silk.

1000
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,150
Oh, my God!

1001
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,020
Oh, my God!

1002
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:21,710
All right.

1003
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:23,990
I'm so afraid to do this.

1004
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:28,690
I'm so afraid that I lost you.

1005
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:33,090
I'm really sorry about Garrett.

1006
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:45,120
He did so well talking to the overworld.

1007
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,240
Neither walk or spring or warm fire.

1008
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,200
And oh, let's go!

1009
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:51,020
Move me out!

1010
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,960
It's me!

1011
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:25,090
He must be gone.

1012
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,090
The great jogging it.

1013
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:29,790
Now go just gathering over forces.

1014
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:31,850
We'll destroy this land.

1015
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:35,450
Unless we go just down over.

1016
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:37,470
But what are we doing here?

1017
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:40,690
Let's go start some pigs.

1018
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,150
I'm ready.

1019
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:43,210
I'm done with those pigs.

1020
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:44,570
Yeah, me too.

1021
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,290
Let's do it for guard guard.

1022
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:47,780
First we mine.

1023
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:49,170
Can we crack?

1024
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,830
Let's find crowds.

1025
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:54,090
Wait, one, two, three, two, four.

1026
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,070
What do you say?

1027
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:55,790
I'm going to crack.

1028
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:57,030
We should all say that.

1029
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,590
On three.

1030
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,470
One forget, there's no time!

1031
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:02,070
Show us what you got, man.

1032
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:02,470
Okay.

1033
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:04,070
We've got a plan.

1034
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,250
Killer recipes.

1035
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:06,890
We're going to have to move fast.

1036
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:07,930
Let's get to work.

1037
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:10,990
First, we're going to need ironing.

1038
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:12,730
We're going to need a car.

1039
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,090
Oh, yeah.

1040
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:21,390
We're going to need the food to flip this.

1041
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:25,530
Time to block this place.

1042
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,690
The knife.

1043
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:41,120
We need a ton of diamonds.

1044
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,880
It lays for days.

1045
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:52,610
You want some money?

1046
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,070
Let's go save the other world.

1047
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,640
We take the other world.

1048
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,400
Let's dance.

1049
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,900
Bring it up.

1050
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,280
Come on.

1051
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,080
Between us, I use these water bucket
tricks.

1052
01:25:50,340 --> 01:25:51,440
They go up.

1053
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:52,780
A little bit.

1054
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,500
Let's get this one.

1055
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:54,800
We go home.

1056
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,400
Let's fireball time.

1057
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,920
Grab that stair.

1058
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,520
Don't want you to jab in the tent.

1059
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,920
Oh, jab it.

1060
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,320
Yeah!

1061
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,140
How do you want to have a deal with that?

1062
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,360
Oh, yeah.

1063
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:42,530
What have you done?

1064
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:41,510
You failed which.

1065
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:44,070
The overworld lives on.

1066
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:47,010
You too have fallen for the great lie.

1067
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:49,290
You'll never be happy.

1068
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,330
Dig down, you know.

1069
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:55,430
To hope, to dream, to create, is to
suffer.

1070
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:56,730
You're right.

1071
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:59,570
It is harder to create than to destroy.

1072
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:03,630
That's why cowards tend to choose the
deuce.

1073
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:06,270
Later, gosh.

1074
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:11,910
Every minute knowing you has been a horror
show waste of time.

1075
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:14,650
Wait, what was that?

1076
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,290
Come close there.

1077
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:19,310
Do you have a little knife that you're
going to try to stab me with?

1078
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:21,450
No, I'm too late.

1079
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:27,210
Come on!

1080
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:28,810
Who's with the shot?

1081
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:29,830
Wait, wait.

1082
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:31,150
Let me say one more thing.

1083
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:31,970
Come close there.

1084
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:32,750
No way!

1085
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:33,550
No, really.

1086
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,530
It's about you.

1087
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:37,230
Fine.

1088
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:41,730
Lean down here.

1089
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:45,490
You really are the worst.

1090
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:47,850
Goodbye.

1091
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,020
This is it, really.

1092
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:50,270
Come back.

1093
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:51,470
I don't even have a noise.

1094
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,990
No, I can't bet.

1095
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:55,830
Sneakers, hey.

1096
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:07,540
Hey.

1097
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,880
Sure, you want to go back, Henry?

1098
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,920
You won't feel like this.

1099
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:18,600
There you got constraints, judgements,
obstacles.

1100
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,180
Yeah, I know.

1101
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:22,300
But I'm going to go make stuff anyway.

1102
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:26,700
I like that.

1103
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:29,400
You're a brave kid.

1104
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:31,620
Steve.

1105
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:33,760
You still cool with this?

1106
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:38,060
Yeah.

1107
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,340
Come and wait.

1108
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,040
Yeah.

1109
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:44,260
Of course, I still love you.

1110
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:46,300
That's why I think this is a good idea.

1111
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,840
You changed my life.

1112
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,500
It's time for you to go change hers,
too.

1113
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,120
Go now.

1114
01:29:58,150 --> 01:29:59,840
Change Dawn's life.

1115
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:01,300
Dennis.

1116
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,360
Go on a journey.

1117
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:05,720
And think of me.

1118
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,280
Dennis.

1119
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:13,460
Go now, legendary work for my dreams.

1120
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,440
Might don't get okay, don't get okay.

1121
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:19,340
Mike.

1122
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:20,380
Dennis.

1123
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,200
I won't.

1124
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:32,050
If I wasn't on, you could sing like that.

1125
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:33,930
It would help me get past your smell.

1126
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,230
Garrett, you are a truly bodacious
warrior.

1127
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:44,530
And a really good friend.

1128
01:30:44,930 --> 01:30:47,390
I wish you'd come home with us.

1129
01:30:48,230 --> 01:30:49,230
Hang school.

1130
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,730
But I'm having your friends my age.

1131
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,370
You can make a great team.

1132
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:04,890
But I'll come to you.

1133
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:07,610
It means goodbye, brother.

1134
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:09,850
No, it doesn't.

1135
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:12,030
Don't look at her.

1136
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:12,830
It does.

1137
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:14,470
No, it does not.

1138
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:16,110
That does.

1139
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:20,230
Let me, guys!

1140
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:22,590
Are you sure you don't want to come back?

1141
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:24,450
Yeah, I'm staying here.

1142
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:26,310
I got a bunch more stuff I want to build.

1143
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:30,290
Why don't you bring some of that magic to
the real world?

1144
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:52,810
Screw it.

1145
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:54,150
I'm coming with.

1146
01:31:56,910 --> 01:32:01,250
It turns out the overworld taught us you
can create the life you dream of.

1147
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:03,730
Even in the real world.

1148
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:06,870
Garrett's store became the hottest place
in town.

1149
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:10,790
And the best part is new friends were
never far.

1150
01:32:12,090 --> 01:32:17,750
So with Henry and Natalie's help we created
the hit game, block steady battle buddies.

1151
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:22,330
All that time in the overworld up
everyone's game.

1152
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:26,930
In every Friday, I would let it rip.

1153
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:28,170
Yeah!

1154
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:35,710
I used to wake up and lay back in my
childhood days.

1155
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:38,120
Dead, he knows it's such a dirty shame.

1156
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:43,410
They met my baby a chance to let my
imagination dance.

1157
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:45,930
Here I came up with a different game.

1158
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:48,890
Diamond the spines.

1159
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:52,550
All of the time that I'm on the side.

1160
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:53,930
I'm on the spines.

1161
01:32:54,670 --> 01:33:00,290
I will never have a look in fact cause
I'll be alive.

1162
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:06,790
John finally got to ditch a real estate
job.

1163
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:10,170
She and Dennis brought the party wherever
they went.

1164
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:15,050
Natalie decided to share her new skill set
with the real world.

1165
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:17,170
Survival mode self-defense.

1166
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,890
The streets that struggle us have never
been safer.

1167
01:33:24,110 --> 01:33:25,450
You got to, Natalie.

1168
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:31,590
As Henry, he finally got that jet back to
work.

1169
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:38,750
I feel the fire now.

1170
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:42,350
I move mountains with my mind.

1171
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:50,780
I feel the fire now.

1172
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:54,020
I feel the fire now.

1173
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:54,380
I feel the fire now.

1174
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:57,280
The rest don't know the dry eye.

1175
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:01,180
I feel the fire now.

1176
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:04,880
With the power of the world to die.

1177
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:09,400
I feel the fire now.

1178
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,400
I

1179
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,270
know how much you love bread.

1180
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,190
Marlene, your ex-husband's here.

1181
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:32,580
He said it was an emergency.

1182
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:36,510
Well, you tell him I've got nothing to say
to him.

1183
01:34:36,790 --> 01:34:38,310
You got to be kidding me, Marlene.

1184
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:39,710
This is the guy.

1185
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:41,290
Too late, Clemente.

1186
01:34:41,790 --> 01:34:42,990
You had your chance.

1187
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:44,550
She's right, Clemente.

1188
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:46,070
You've totally blew it.

1189
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:49,910
And now I reap the rewards of your
mistake.

1190
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:56,050
You see, when Marlene's Jeep Grand
Cherokee ran me over, I was struck by a

1191
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:57,200
love so powerful.

1192
01:34:57,330 --> 01:35:01,030
It transcended the barriers of
conventional speech.

1193
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:04,970
Now I speak human and she speaks villager.

1194
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:19,150
Marlene, ever since we met last night,
I wanted to say, would you marry me?

1195
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:20,510
Yes!

1196
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:22,390
Yes!

1197
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:23,390
A thousand times!
