[Dawn] Well, real estate's
not my only hustle.

304

I also do some mobile zoo stuff

My sister made it.

346
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,520
I'm supposed to hand out slices
at school to make friends.

347

A little desperate for day one,
don't you think?

348

I also notice that
you're wearing Velvet Mischief.

It's a wonderful cologne.

And I strongly believe
that every young man

351

should have his own
signature scent.

Friendship is like a puzzle.

Sometimes you think you need
lots of pieces to be cool.

357
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,474
And sometimes
it's just one piece to be cool.

358
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,176
And people will be like,

359

"That's not a puzzle,
that's a picture."

And they have a right to speak,
too.

Any questions?

362
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,519
Yeah. Quite a few, actually.

363
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:07,589
Listen, kid. The point is,
there's no "I" in team.

364
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:09,557

recently divorced me.

And to be honest, I expected it
to hurt more than it does.

4,000 dollars on my tax return.

388
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,693

00:44:43,184 --> 00:44:44,952
Look but don't touch.

966
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:47,087
Those are some
of my favorite treasures.

967
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:52,159
Hrr.

968
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:55,896
[hinges creaking]

969
00:44:57,932 --> 00:44:59,300
What's this junk?

970
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,302
That is an Ender Pearl.

971
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:03,070
Teleports you
to wherever you throw it.

972
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:06,407
-Yeah, right.
-No!

973
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,175
[yells, gasping]

974
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:09,977
Oh, God.

975
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,045
What the...

976
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:13,247
And that was the only one I had.

977
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,815
No biggie.

978
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:17,117
Almost died fighting
an Enderman for it.

979
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:18,485
Come with me.

980
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:27,027
This is a crafting table.

981
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:28,395
Here's how it works.

982
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:31,332
You place these elements
in different patterns,

983
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:33,200
and kaboom!

984
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,905
You got yourself a sweet blade.

985
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:40,542
[metallic ringing]

986
00:45:40,575 --> 00:45:41,775
[Garrett] You wanna see a blade?

987
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:44,912
I'll show you a blade.

988
00:45:45,846 --> 00:45:47,314
-Yeah!
-[objects clattering]

Kadoosh!

991
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:54,556
Ahh...

992
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:55,856
[wheezing cough]

993
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:58,459
That's okay, bud.
Buckets are useful here.

994
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,529
Yeah. They're cool, Garrett.
They're like nunchucks.

995
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:04,265
Yeah, I know.
That's why I made them.

996
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:06,033
They're...

997
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:08,235
Buck-Chuckets.

998
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:09,970
Uh... they're what?

999
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:14,275
Hey, can I try something else?

1000
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:15,976
Abso-rootin'-tootly.

1001
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:22,316
Bro, you had Tots
the whole time?

1002
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:23,117
Yeah. Sorry.

1003
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:27,421
[Steve] Ohh!

1004
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:29,823
It's a Tot Launcher.

1005
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,393
Dude, you just took boring junk
from the real world

1006
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:34,128
to create something amazing.

1007
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,462
That is next-level.

1008
00:46:35,496 --> 00:46:37,164
[Garrett] Hank?

1009
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:38,399
Can I play with your
Tot Launcher when you're done?

1010
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:40,134
-Yeah.
-Sweet.

1011
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:42,469
Hey, Steve.
Can I talk to you for a second?

1012
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,004
Sure thing.

1013
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:47,141
[launcher powers up]

[axe clanging]

1015
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:52,880
What's up?

1016
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:54,848
You know that note
you left with the Orb?

1017
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:55,983
The one about the riches?

1018
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:57,451
I read it.

1019
00:46:57,652 --> 00:46:59,920
Yeah. There's riches everywhere.

1020
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:02,389
I keep a fat stash of diamonds
at the Redstone Mines.

1021
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:03,591
So this treasure load,

1022
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,527
is it on the way
to this Mansion place?

1023
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,494
Not really. It's a major detour.

1024
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:09,597
Plus, the mines can be perilous.

1025
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:11,165
Let me keep it simple for you,
Steve.

1026
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:16,236
No diamonds, no Orb.

1027
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,039
You smell what I'm steppin' in?

1028

Hurr...

1029
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:26,313
Good day.

Huh...

1031
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:32,319
We need a map
to the Woodland Mansion.

1032

Uhhrr-uhr?

1033

We just need a map.

[Chungus] All right, guys,

Yeah, we used to get
into some dungeon stuff.

but he's a killer!

1454
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:42,537
Hm.

1455
01:06:43,437 --> 01:06:45,105
I wanna have the guts
to invite you

01:06:45,138 --> 01:06:46,674

1460

But we're done with our meal.

1461
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:59,621
There it is.
The Woodland Mansion.

1462
01:06:59,654 --> 01:07:01,623
We're gonna get in there,
get the Earth Crystal

1463
01:07:01,656 --> 01:07:03,357
and get you guys home.

1464
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:04,559
Follow me!

1465
01:07:05,225 --> 01:07:06,193
Check this out.

1466
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:08,295
Let's do this.

1467
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:10,532
Pay close attention
to Papa Steve.

1468
01:07:10,565 --> 01:07:12,767
The Woodland Mansion
has three floors.

1469
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:16,370
The first floor
is loaded with Vindicators.

1470
01:07:16,671 --> 01:07:18,205
Axe murderers, basically.

1471
01:07:18,238 --> 01:07:19,574
Why is the third floor
on the first floor?

1472
01:07:19,607 --> 01:07:21,308
I'm very confused.

1473
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:22,744
[Steve] I was trying
to make three floors,

1474
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:24,679
but I didn't have time to make,
like, a doll house.

1475
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:28,315
The second floor
crawls with Evokers.

1476
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:30,450
They wield powerful dark magic.

1477
01:07:30,484 --> 01:07:32,119
This is the worst model
I've ever seen.

1478
01:07:32,152 --> 01:07:33,320
Garrett, stop talking.

1479
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:34,656
We're trying
to figure out a plan.

1480
01:07:34,689 --> 01:07:36,156
Bro, how long are you
gonna be mad at me for?

1481
01:07:36,189 --> 01:07:37,391
I just got mad at you.

1482
01:07:37,759 --> 01:07:39,293
Please don't be mad at me
for this, okay?

1483
01:07:39,326 --> 01:07:41,361
But I accidentally stole the Orb
while you were crafting.

1484
01:07:43,263 --> 01:07:44,832
Are we cool now?

1485
01:07:44,866 --> 01:07:47,769
You are literally the worst
person in the entire world.

1486
01:07:47,802 --> 01:07:51,438
Guys! Both of you,
eyes on my demonstraysh!

1487
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:54,374
Third floor houses
the Loot Chamber.

1488
01:07:54,742 --> 01:07:56,343
That's where
the Earth Crystal is,

1489
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:58,680
but it's guarded by Endermen.

1490
01:07:58,713 --> 01:08:01,381
Whatever you do,
do not look them in the eye.

1491
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:03,116
They'll fry your brains out.

1492
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,185
Okay, well I could build stairs
to the second floor,

1493
01:08:05,218 --> 01:08:07,254
sneak in through the window,
and snag the Earth Crystal.

1494
01:08:07,287 --> 01:08:09,156
That's a great idea, Hank.

1495
01:08:09,189 --> 01:08:12,060
But to pull it off, we're gonna
need a pretty sweet diversion.

1496
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:14,428
You know what could work
on these guys?

1497
01:08:14,461 --> 01:08:15,429
