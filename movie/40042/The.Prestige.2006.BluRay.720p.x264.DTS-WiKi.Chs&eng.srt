00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,00

Build time 09.07.10 16:43:18

1
00:00:43,80 --> 00:00:48,90
片名：致命魔术/顶尖对决

2
00:00:57,75 --> 00:00:59,12
你在仔细看吗？
<i>Are you watching closely?</i>

3
00:01:06,09 --> 00:01:10,46
每一场魔术表演都有三个步骤
<i>Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts.</i>

4
00:01:11,26 --> 00:01:13,99
第一个步骤是“以虚代实”
<i>The first part is called "the pledge."</i>

5
00:01:14,17 --> 00:01:17,40
魔术师秀出一个真实的东西
<i>The magician shows you something ordinary.</i>

6
00:01:17,57 --> 00:01:20,90
一副牌、一只鸟或一个人
<i>A deck of cards, a bird or a man.</i>

7
00:01:27,51 --> 00:01:29,95
让你看这样东西
<i>He shows you this object.</i>

8
00:01:30,12 --> 00:01:32,11
叫你检视它
<i>Perhaps he asks you to inspect it,</i>

9
00:01:33,29 --> 00:01:35,91
看它的确是真的
<i>to see that it is indeed real,</i>

10
00:01:36,09 --> 00:01:39,22
平常的不得了
<i>unaltered, normal.</i>

11
00:01:42,50 --> 00:01:45,43
但是，其中一定有假
<i>But, of course, it probably isn't.</i>

12
00:01:45,90 --> 00:01:49,70
-你想去哪里？ -我是表演的一部分，猪头
Where do you think you're going?

13
00:01:47,07 --> 00:01:49,43
I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

14
00:02:02,65 --> 00:02:05,12
第二个步骤是“偷天换日”
<i>The second act is called "the turn."</i>

15
00:02:19,60 --> 00:02:22,57
魔术师利用这个普通的东西
<i>The magician takes the ordinary something</i>

16
00:02:24,50 --> 00:02:27,37
做出令人叹为观止的表演
<i>and makes it do something extraordinary.</i>

17
00:02:32,11 --> 00:02:35,74
现在你很想找出秘诀 但是绝对找不到
<i>Now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it,</i>

18
00:02:35,92 --> 00:02:39,22
因为你根本没有真正在看
<i>because, of course, you're not really looking.</i>

19
00:02:39,85 --> 00:02:41,48
你并不是真的想知道
<i>You don't really want to know.</i>

20
00:02:44,72 --> 00:02:47,09
你想要被骗
<i>You want to be... fooled.</i>

21
00:02:48,96 --> 00:02:50,73
但是你还不会鼓掌
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet,</i>

22
00:02:51,50 --> 00:02:55,49
因为把东西变不见还不够
<i>because making something disappear isn't enough.</i>

23
00:02:56,10 --> 00:02:59,44
你必须把它变回来
<i>You have to bring it back.</i>

24
00:03:00,74 --> 00:03:04,44
所以魔术都有第三个步骤
<i>That's why every magic trick has a third act.</i>

25
00:03:04,61 --> 00:03:06,17
最难的部分
<i>The hardest part.</i>

26
00:03:06,75 --> 00:03:10,18
我们称之为“化腐朽为神奇”
<i>The part we call...</i>

27
00:03:08,55 --> 00:03:09,88
<i>..."the prestige."</i>

28
00:03:20,96 --> 00:03:25,09
化腐朽为神奇？劳勃安杰 你的雇主丹顿大师
The prestige? And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer,

29
00:03:25,27 --> 00:03:27,89
那晚有完成表演吗？
get to that final part of his trick that night?

30
00:03:28,07 --> 00:03:29,73
-并没有，出了状况 -出了什么状况？
- No, sir. Something went wrong. - What went wrong?

31
00:03:31,04 --> 00:03:34,53
我看到有个人跑到舞台下方
I saw someone making their way below stage.

32
00:03:34,71 --> 00:03:36,44
我跟踪他
I followed him.

33
00:03:36,61 --> 00:03:39,84
那是波登，眼睁睁看着安先生溺死
It was Borden, watching Mr. Angier drown.

34
00:03:40,01 --> 00:03:43,24
柯特先生，请向陪审团说明你的职业
Would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter.

35
00:03:43,42 --> 00:03:44,51
我是机关师
<i>I'm an ingnieur, I design illusions</i>

36
00:03:44,68 --> 00:03:49,05
设计魔术表演 打造需要的道具和机关
and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them.

37
00:03:49,22 --> 00:03:50,21
柯先生
So, Mr. Cutter, was this water-filled tank beneath the stage

38
00:03:50,39 --> 00:03:53,55
舞台下方的水箱

39
00:03:53,73 --> 00:03:55,49
也是这个魔术的道具吗？
part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

40
00:03:55,66 --> 00:03:56,79
不，那是…
No. The tank was brought on for the first trick

41
00:03:56,96 --> 00:04:01,09
水箱是第一个表演用的 然后就被搬下台

42
00:03:58,87 --> 00:04:00,83
and then taken offstage.

43
00:04:01,27 --> 00:04:04,47
一定是波登把它移到机关门底下了
Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the end of it.

44
00:04:04,64 --> 00:04:06,04
水箱有多大？
How large was this tank?

45
00:04:06,21 --> 00:04:10,80
表演水底脱逃的一般大小 大约四、五百加仑吧
It's a normal tank for escape under water,

46
00:04:08,58 --> 00:04:10,70
about 400 or 500 gallons.

47
00:04:10,98 --> 00:04:12,34
波登怎么能一个人移动水箱
How do you think he was able to move the tank

48
00:04:12,51 --> 00:04:15,97
而没有让任何人发现？
under the trap door without anyone noticing?

49
00:04:16,15 --> 00:04:17,91
他是魔术师，你去问他
He's a magician, ask him.

50
00:04:18,08 --> 00:04:22,65
我要求你为我解释 安先生的魔术机关
I ask again,

51
00:04:19,39 --> 00:04:22,62
would this man explain the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

52
00:04:22,82 --> 00:04:24,31
真正的遁移术
The Real Transported Man is one of the most sought after illusions

53
00:04:24,49 --> 00:04:27,46
是这一行最抢手的魔术

54
00:04:26,09 --> 00:04:27,29
in this business.

55
00:04:27,63 --> 00:04:29,12
出售秘诀的权利在我手中
I have the right to sell it on.

56
00:04:29,30 --> 00:04:31,89
如果被揭穿就不值钱了
If I reveal the method here, the trick is worthless.

57
00:04:32,07 --> 00:04:36,09
我们怎么知道… 水箱不只是单纯出错？
How can we know that the tank wasn't simply

58
00:04:34,04 --> 00:04:36,50
some part of the trick that went wrong?

59
00:04:36,90 --> 00:04:38,93
我了解你的处境
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament.

60
00:04:39,11 --> 00:04:41,37
但是这攸关波登的生死
But Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.

61
00:04:41,74 --> 00:04:44,68
如果你私底下向我透露细节
If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private,

62
00:04:44,84 --> 00:04:47,40
我就能对此案做出中肯的判决
I might be able to judge their relevance to the case.

63
00:04:47,58 --> 00:04:50,18
你能接受这种妥协吗？
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

64
00:05:08,64 --> 00:05:11,76
麻烦你掏出口袋里的东西
I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.

65
00:05:16,21 --> 00:05:17,34
我不是故意找你碴
Not my idea, sir. The warden saw his show in Manchester last year

66
00:05:17,51 --> 00:05:21,50
典狱长看过他凭空消失的表演

67
00:05:19,38 --> 00:05:21,25
where he vanished into thin air.

68
00:05:21,68 --> 00:05:24,65
他觉得他会企图逃狱
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

69
00:05:27,65 --> 00:05:30,32
我说他能逃走的唯一机会
I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear

70
00:05:30,49 --> 00:05:33,65
就是和其它囚犯混在一起
is if I leave him out there with the other inmates.

71
00:05:38,77 --> 00:05:39,99
检查手铐的锁
Check the locks...

72
00:05:41,84 --> 00:05:43,83
检查两次
...twice.

73
00:05:50,41 --> 00:05:52,88
我叫欧文
My name is Owens.

74
00:05:53,05 --> 00:05:55,24
我是一名律师
I'm a solicitor.

75
00:05:55,42 --> 00:05:59,04
代表卡德洛爵士 一位业余魔术师兼历史学家
I represent Lord Caldlow, an accomplished amateur magician and...

76
00:05:59,22 --> 00:06:00,95
多少钱？
How much?

77
00:06:01,66 --> 00:06:04,12
-卡爵士有兴趣… -他出多少钱买我的魔术？
- He is interested... - How much for my tricks?

78
00:06:04,29 --> 00:06:05,59
五千英镑
Five thousand pounds.

79
00:06:05,76 --> 00:06:08,25
跟我的机关师法隆说钱归他
<i>Talk to Fallon, my ingnieur. Money's for him.</i>

80
00:06:08,43 --> 00:06:12,06
我说了，他答应出售你的秘诀
Yes, I did. He offered to sell me your tricks.

81
00:06:12,23 --> 00:06:14,96
除了最值钱的遁移术外
All except the most valuable one, The Transported Man.

82
00:06:15,14 --> 00:06:18,30
我绝不会出售我最伟大的魔术
Well, I won't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.

83
00:06:18,47 --> 00:06:19,77
即使是为了你女儿？
Even for your daughter?

84
00:06:21,61 --> 00:06:24,13
如果报纸没料错，你会被判死刑
If you are for the drop, your daughter is going to need looking after.

85
00:06:24,31 --> 00:06:27,68
-你女儿就需要别人照顾 -法隆会照顾她
Fallon will take care of her.

86
00:06:27,85 --> 00:06:31,25
伯纳法隆？ 他这个人跟你一样神秘
Perfect, Fallon.

87
00:06:29,25 --> 00:06:31,28
A man with a past as obscure as your own.

88
00:06:31,42 --> 00:06:34,05
法院一定会剥夺他的监护权
The courts have motioned she be removed from his care. She will be an orphan.

89
00:06:34,22 --> 00:06:36,65
你女儿就会变成孤儿

90
00:06:37,29 --> 00:06:41,69
你应该对童工工厂很熟吧 会比监狱好吗？
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse.

91
00:06:39,49 --> 00:06:41,33
It's better than here?

92
00:06:41,86 --> 00:06:44,89
我给你一个机会维护尊严
I'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

93
00:06:45,07 --> 00:06:46,93
也给你女儿一个未来
I'm offering your daughter a future.

94
00:06:47,10 --> 00:06:50,73
她被卡爵士领养 保证要什么就有什么
As Lord Caldlow's ward, she will want for nothing...

95
00:06:49,84 --> 00:06:51,67
...ever.

96
00:06:52,34 --> 00:06:54,83
好好考虑吧
Well, think it over.

97
00:06:55,64 --> 00:06:59,98
爵士给你这本日记以表诚意
And Lord Caldlow would like you to have this,

98
00:07:00,15 --> 00:07:03,51
也许你会有兴趣 这是劳勃安杰的日记
as a show of good faith. It might be of interest.

99
00:07:01,25 --> 00:07:04,78
Robert Angier's diary, including the time he spent in Colorado

100
00:07:03,68 --> 00:07:06,41
包括他在科罗拉多学会你的魔术
learning your trick.

101
00:07:06,59 --> 00:07:08,14
-他没学会我的魔术 -真的吗？
- He never learned it. - Really?

102
00:07:08,32 --> 00:07:11,78
他回来以后表演全新的遁移术
On his return, he mounted a version of The Transported Man

103
00:07:11,96 --> 00:07:15,79
报纸说比你的原版更棒
that the papers said was better even than your original.

104
00:07:15,96 --> 00:07:22,37
你想知道安杰的秘密 得把他从坟墓挖出来问
If you want Angier's secrets,

105
00:07:17,87 --> 00:07:22,43
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

106
00:07:22,87 --> 00:07:25,46
我想要你的秘密，波登
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

107
00:07:27,81 --> 00:07:28,97
为你的女儿着想吧！
Consider your daughter.

108
00:07:36,62 --> 00:07:40,55
字谜，一个大谜团
<i>A cipher,</i>

109
00:07:38,22 --> 00:07:40,24
<i>an enigma...</i>

110
00:07:42,42 --> 00:07:45,76
寻找，我要寻找答案
<i>...a search,</i>

111
00:07:44,06 --> 00:07:45,05
<i>a search for answers.</i>

112
00:07:53,00 --> 00:07:56,80
就算科罗拉多是我的终点站
<i>Even if Colorado is the end of my journey,</i>

113
00:07:56,97 --> 00:08:02,67
要解开波登的谜要花更久的时间
<i>it'll take much longer to unravel</i>

114
00:07:59,87 --> 00:08:01,77
<i>the rest of Borden's secrets.</i>

115
00:08:04,28 --> 00:08:08,84
他笔记的密码只有一个字
<i>See, the cipher in his notebook is</i>

116
00:08:05,88 --> 00:08:08,37
<i>unlocked by a single word,</i>

117
00:08:09,02 --> 00:08:14,82
但也得要花好几个月翻译 才能了解他的想法
<i>but it will still take months to translate his writing.</i>

118
00:08:11,49 --> 00:08:14,25
<i>And to know his mind.</i>

119
00:08:17,62 --> 00:08:20,99
我的执着经得起这场考验
<i>Well, my passion is equal to the task.</i>

120
00:08:25,53 --> 00:08:27,52
(科罗拉多 泉镇)

121
00:08:33,04 --> 00:08:36,84
安先生？欢迎光临泉镇
Mr. Angier, welcome to Colorado Springs.

122
00:08:51,89 --> 00:08:55,45
-整座小镇都有供电吗？ -是的
- The whole town has electricity. - Yes, sir.

123
00:09:12,18 --> 00:09:15,17
好隆重的欢迎
Well...

124
00:09:13,35 --> 00:09:14,84
...quite a reception.

125
00:09:15,35 --> 00:09:17,71
您是本季第一位客人，安先生
You're our first guest of the season, Mr. Angier.

126
00:09:17,88 --> 00:09:21,25
您的电报没提到您会待多久
Your telegram didn't indicate how long you'd be staying with us.

127
00:09:21,42 --> 00:09:22,95
能待多久就待多久
As long as it takes.

128
00:09:23,12 --> 00:09:26,29
我明天需要马车载我上山
I will need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.

129
00:09:26,46 --> 00:09:29,99
山顶关闭了，为了科学实验
Well, the peak's closed, sir.

130
00:09:27,90 --> 00:09:29,73
For scientific experimentation.

131
00:09:30,16 --> 00:09:33,39
我知道，这就是我来的目的
Yes, I know.

132
00:09:31,83 --> 00:09:33,13
That's why I'm here.

133
00:09:40,37 --> 00:09:42,60
Whoa. Whoa.

134
00:09:44,64 --> 00:09:48,01
先生，接下来您得自己走路了
You'll have to walk the rest, I'm afraid, sir.

135
00:10:06,13 --> 00:10:08,12
(电击危险)

136
00:10:23,12 --> 00:10:28,88
令人惊讶 你们记者都看不懂我的标志吗？
I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers

137
00:10:26,09 --> 00:10:28,15
can't read my sign.

138
00:10:33,79 --> 00:10:35,78
看来我并不受欢迎
Not the welcome I was expecting.

139
00:10:39,17 --> 00:10:40,79
我认得你
I know you.

140
00:10:44,70 --> 00:10:49,33
你是魔术大师丹顿 我在伦敦看了你七场表演
You're the Great Danton.

141
00:10:46,11 --> 00:10:48,41
I saw your show in London.

142
00:10:49,51 --> 00:10:53,81
你猜中观众口袋里的每样东西
Seven times you guessed every object

143
00:10:51,31 --> 00:10:53,54
the audience had in their pockets.

144
00:10:53,98 --> 00:10:55,35
我是艾利
I'm Alley. Sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.

145
00:10:55,52 --> 00:10:57,98
围栏的事真抱歉，太多人来干扰

146
00:10:58,15 --> 00:11:00,68
-我来见泰斯拉 -为什么？
- I've come to see Tesla. - Why?

147
00:11:00,85 --> 00:11:04,72
他为我的同行打造一架机器
He made a machine for a colleague of mine some time ago.

148
00:11:04,89 --> 00:11:08,38
-你能安排我们见面吗？ -恐怕是不太可能
- Can you get me a meeting with him? - Impossible, I'm afraid.

149
00:11:08,56 --> 00:11:10,72
我带了很多钱来
I've brought a lot of money.

150
00:11:10,90 --> 00:11:12,42
很抱歉，安先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

151
00:11:13,73 --> 00:11:16,46
我帮不上忙
I simply can't help.

152
00:11:17,44 --> 00:11:20,93
我会一直待在旅馆
I'll be staying at the hotel, indefinitely.

153
00:11:23,81 --> 00:11:25,00
我现在握着什么？
Hey, what am I holding?

154
00:11:25,88 --> 00:11:27,18
你的怀表
Your watch.

155
00:11:32,25 --> 00:11:37,69
波登的日记，1897年4月3日 记录了奥芬大剧院的演出
<i>Borden's journal entry for April 3, 1897,</i>

156
00:11:35,29 --> 00:11:37,38
<i>describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.</i>

157
00:11:37,86 --> 00:11:41,69
那时我们才刚认识
<i>That was just days after he first met me.</i>

158
00:11:43,66 --> 00:11:46,72
当时我们都是刚出道的魔术师
<i>We were two young men at the start of a great career,</i>

159
00:11:46,90 --> 00:11:49,42
我们完全献身于魔术
<i>two young men devoted to an illusion,</i>

160
00:11:49,60 --> 00:11:51,76
从没有想要伤害任何人
<i>two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.</i>

161
00:11:51,94 --> 00:11:56,40
谁有胆量上台绑住这位美女
Which of you brave souls

162
00:11:53,41 --> 00:11:56,14
is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

163
00:11:57,91 --> 00:11:59,85
Me!

164
00:12:08,72 --> 00:12:10,09
绑住她的手腕
If you would tie her wrists,

165
00:12:10,89 --> 00:12:15,73
绑住她的腿 脚踝也要绑紧
bind her feet...

166
00:12:12,89 --> 00:12:15,42
...around the ankle.

167
00:12:15,90 --> 00:12:17,89
你们是水手吗？
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

168
00:12:18,06 --> 00:12:19,76
-不是 -不是
- No. - No.

169
00:12:20,67 --> 00:12:24,07
我想你们打的结应该都很紧
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

170
00:13:27,13 --> 00:13:30,43
他太自满、毫无创意 又无趣
He's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring.

171
00:13:30,60 --> 00:13:33,20
米尔顿很成功
Milton has gotten success, whatever that means,

172
00:13:33,37 --> 00:13:36,14
但现在他很没种 不敢再冒任何风险
so now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all.

173
00:13:36,31 --> 00:13:39,04
他耍二流把戏
He's squandering the goodwill of his audience with tired,

174
00:13:39,21 --> 00:13:42,15
-糟蹋观众的热情 -大家爱看这些把戏
- second-rate tricks... - They're all favorites.

175
00:13:42,32 --> 00:13:45,68
拜托，让我试些新魔术吧 他甚至不敢尝试“接子弹”
Give me something fresh. He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.

176
00:13:45,85 --> 00:13:47,44
“接子弹”是自杀
A bullet catch is suicide.

177
00:13:47,62 --> 00:13:51,52
要是志愿者放钮扣进去就死定了
All it takes is some smartass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

178
00:13:51,69 --> 00:13:54,06
-那就用暗桩 -不能每个魔术都用暗桩
- Use a plant. - You can't for every trick.

179
00:13:54,23 --> 00:13:57,03
-不然客人就没位置坐了 -好吧，不表演“接子弹”
No seats left for the punters.

180
00:13:57,20 --> 00:14:01,57
重点是好魔术师会不断创新戏法
All right, no bullet catch, whatever, but the point is a real magician

181
00:13:59,70 --> 00:14:01,33
tries to invent something new

182
00:14:01,73 --> 00:14:04,50
让其他魔术师想破脑袋
that other magicians will scratch their heads over.

183
00:14:04,67 --> 00:14:06,83
然后你就能靠它小赚一笔
Then you sell it to him for a small fortune.

184
00:14:06,61 --> 00:14:09,70
- What? - I suppose you have such a trick?

185
00:14:08,17 --> 00:14:10,01
我猜你有惊人绝技？

186
00:14:10,18 --> 00:14:12,61
-没错 -你能卖给我吗？
- I sure do. - Would you care to sell it to me?

187
00:14:12,78 --> 00:14:14,30
不行，只有我做得到
No. No one else can do my trick.

188
00:14:14,48 --> 00:14:16,51
-每个魔术都能被模仿，对吧？ -错了
- Any trick can be duplicated. - Wrong.

189
00:14:16,68 --> 00:14:19,58
如果波登发明了他的杰作
If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece,

190
00:14:19,75 --> 00:14:21,91
大概只有他有办法演出
he's prepared to do it.

191
00:14:22,29 --> 00:14:24,45
米尔顿很会作秀，但波登说得对
Milton is a showman, but Borden is right,

192
00:14:24,62 --> 00:14:26,18
米尔顿不肯冒险
he won't get his hands dirty.

193
00:14:26,63 --> 00:14:30,76
想看真正的魔术就去天利剧院
If you want to see what it takes to make real magic,

194
00:14:30,93 --> 00:14:33,63
有位中国魔术师很厉害
go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there and he really has what it takes.

195
00:14:33,80 --> 00:14:36,03
-他叫钟林苏 -门票太贵，我看不起
- Chung Ling Soo. - I can't afford that.

196
00:14:36,20 --> 00:14:37,76
我认识看门的家伙
I know the bloke run the door.

197
00:14:37,94 --> 00:14:40,24
你们俩去看吧
You two go and see that show, and whichever one of you can tell me

198
00:14:40,41 --> 00:14:42,31
谁看出他的金鱼缸戏法窍门

199
00:14:42,48 --> 00:14:44,34
就有奖赏
how he does the goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.

200
00:14:45,88 --> 00:14:47,64
-什么奖赏？ -在我的老朋友艾克曼面前
- Which is? - Ten minutes onstage

201
00:14:47,81 --> 00:14:49,61
试演一段魔术
with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman.

202
00:14:49,78 --> 00:14:51,11
-真的假的？ -艾克曼是谁？
- Really? - Who's Ackerman?

203
00:14:51,28 --> 00:14:53,38
伦敦的顶尖经纪人
The top theatrical agent in London.

204
00:14:54,85 --> 00:14:56,48
我看到你绳结没打好
- I saw you drop the knot again. - I turned my wrists.

205
00:14:56,66 --> 00:14:59,99
-我的手腕动了一下 -你一直没搞懂，是吧？
Some nights you just don't get it, do you?

206
00:15:00,16 --> 00:15:04,12
要是绳结松掉 茱莉亚就会摔断腿
I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist,

207
00:15:02,76 --> 00:15:03,86
she'll break her leg.

208
00:15:04,30 --> 00:15:08,63
你教的绳结有问题 我说过，蓝氏结比较牢固
It's the wrong knot.

209
00:15:05,63 --> 00:15:08,50
Like I said, the Langford double will hold tighter.

210
00:15:08,80 --> 00:15:12,40
蓝氏结不能碰到水，太危险了
The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

211
00:15:12,57 --> 00:15:14,67
要是绳子膨胀她就无法松绑
If the rope swells, she can't slip it.

212
00:15:14,84 --> 00:15:17,97
-我可以在水底松脱蓝氏结 -她做得到，可以练习
- I can slip a Langford underwater. - We can practice.

213
00:15:18,14 --> 00:15:19,48
波登，他说不行
- Borden, he said no. - Oh, you know knots better than me?

214
00:15:19,65 --> 00:15:21,98
你对绳结懂得比我多吗？

215
00:15:22,15 --> 00:15:24,05
听好，不准再出错
Listen, no more mistakes.

216
00:15:24,52 --> 00:15:26,82
是吗？你想取代我？
All right. Yeah? Do you? You want to take over?

217
00:15:26,99 --> 00:15:29,78
-你走吧 -想都别想
- Just leave. - I didn't think so.

218
00:15:34,09 --> 00:15:36,86
-柯特，他打哪儿来的？ -你打哪儿来的？
Hey, Cutter, where's he from?

219
00:15:37,03 --> 00:15:41,30
-他以前帮魔术师佛吉搬道具 -你不担心他偷学你的魔术？
Where are you from? He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.

220
00:15:39,27 --> 00:15:42,43
- Worried he'll steal your tricks? - Doesn't deal in methods.

221
00:15:41,47 --> 00:15:43,77
-他只想创造全新魔术 -你怎么知道？
- How do you know? - Because I hired him

222
00:15:43,94 --> 00:15:49,03
我雇他去偷学佛吉的柳橙戏法

223
00:15:45,64 --> 00:15:48,87
to find out how Virgil does the orange trick.

224
00:15:49,21 --> 00:15:51,54
-我不信任他 -他是天生魔术师
- I don't trust him. - He's a natural magician.

225
00:15:51,71 --> 00:15:53,14
当然不能信任
'Course you can't trust him.

226
00:15:53,98 --> 00:15:55,04
我觉得波登没问题
I think he's all right.

227
00:15:55,21 --> 00:15:57,55
-你觉得大家都没问题 -连你也一样
- You think everyone's all right. - Even you.

228
00:15:57,72 --> 00:16:01,41
安杰，注意一点 就连我都看得到你亲老婆的腿
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you kiss your wife's leg every night,

229
00:16:01,59 --> 00:16:04,11
前排的观众一定也看得到
so can the blokes at the ends of rows three and four!

230
00:16:36,76 --> 00:16:38,69
-你错了，不可能 -错不了
You're wrong. It can't be.

231
00:16:38,86 --> 00:16:42,32
-你看看他 -这就是他的秘诀
- Look at the man. - This is the trick.

232
00:16:42,50 --> 00:16:47,02
这是他的表演 难怪没人看穿他的秘密
This is the performance. Right here.

233
00:16:44,40 --> 00:16:46,76
This is why no one can detect his method.

234
00:16:48,93 --> 00:16:50,40
他对魔术完全奉献
Total devotion to his art.

235
00:16:51,47 --> 00:16:55,57
彻底自我牺牲，你懂吗？
A lot of self-sacrifice.

236
00:16:52,94 --> 00:16:55,31
You know.

237
00:16:55,74 --> 00:17:01,34
这是扬名立万的唯一方法
It's the only way to escape...

238
00:16:58,15 --> 00:17:00,58
...all this, you know?

239
00:17:03,52 --> 00:17:04,51
好吧
I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water.

240
00:17:04,68 --> 00:17:08,62
这很难夹起来，而且还没有装水

241
00:17:09,99 --> 00:17:12,29
也没有金鱼，你看
Or fish, look.

242
00:17:12,46 --> 00:17:14,59
我不确定行不行，等一下
I don't know. Hang on a second.

243
00:17:17,06 --> 00:17:19,69
他一定壮得跟条牛一样
He must be strong as an ox.

244
00:17:22,03 --> 00:17:24,80
这么多年来他一直假装跛脚？
He's been pretending to be a cripple for years.

245
00:17:24,97 --> 00:17:27,23
每次他出门面对大众都得装
Any time he's in public, any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.

246
00:17:27,41 --> 00:17:28,40
不可思议
Borden saw it at once. But I couldn't fathom it.

247
00:17:28,57 --> 00:17:31,54
有一次波登看到他露出马脚 我没办法这样

248
00:17:31,71 --> 00:17:34,31
很难想像花一辈子去假装别人
Living my whole life pretending to be someone else.

249
00:17:34,48 --> 00:17:38,14
-你是在假装啊！ -换个名字并不算吧
You are pretending.

250
00:17:35,95 --> 00:17:37,97
I don't think changing a name compares.

251
00:17:38,32 --> 00:17:40,79
你也换了身分和来历
Not your name. Who you are and where you're from.

252
00:17:40,95 --> 00:17:45,19
因为我答应不能败坏家人名声
I promised I wouldn't embarrass my family with my theatrical endeavors.

253
00:17:46,43 --> 00:17:48,59
我帮你想到一个艺名
I thought of a name for you.

254
00:17:50,03 --> 00:17:52,00
魔术大师丹顿
The Great Danton.

255
00:17:53,63 --> 00:17:54,62
你喜欢吗？
Do you like it? But it's sophisticated.

256
00:17:55,74 --> 00:17:57,97
-这名字很炫 -那是法国人名
It's French.

257
00:18:04,64 --> 00:18:08,10
波登觉得只有他了解魔术的本质
<i>Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic.</i>

258
00:18:13,92 --> 00:18:16,82
但是他不了解自我牺牲
<i>But what does he know of self-sacrifice?</i>

259
00:18:21,93 --> 00:18:23,83
你这笨蛋
You bloody fool.

260
00:18:51,36 --> 00:18:53,79
-他杀了小鸟 -怎么了？
- He killed it. - It's OK.

261
00:18:53,96 --> 00:18:54,95
怎么了？
- He killed it. - He didn't.

262
00:18:55,13 --> 00:18:57,79
-小鸟死了 -没有啦

263
00:19:03,00 --> 00:19:04,56
瞧，他会把他变回来
Look, now he'll bring it back.

264
00:19:06,94 --> 00:19:09,70
不，他杀了小鸟
- No, he killed it. - No, he didn't.

265
00:19:10,88 --> 00:19:12,04
不

266
00:19:18,18 --> 00:19:21,05
看到没？他没事，他很好
Look, see, he's all right. He's fine.

267
00:19:21,22 --> 00:19:25,21
-看到没？ -那他的兄弟呢？
- Look at him. - But where's his brother?

268
00:19:28,13 --> 00:19:31,12
你儿子真是聪明
He's a sharp lad, your son.

269
00:19:31,30 --> 00:19:33,86
他是我外甥
Oh, he's my nephew.

270
00:19:33,67 --> 00:19:35,16
Ah.

271
00:19:39,71 --> 00:19:41,17
算你今天走运
You're the lucky one today.

272
00:20:01,79 --> 00:20:04,06
你在仔细看吗？
Are you watching closely?

273
00:20:07,73 --> 00:20:09,26
看清楚了
Look closer.

274
00:20:12,34 --> 00:20:14,07
绝对不要揭穿谜底
Never show anyone.

275
00:20:14,54 --> 00:20:18,87
他们会求你、奉承你 一旦你说出来
They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret,

276
00:20:16,68 --> 00:20:20,17
but as soon as you give it up, you'll be nothing to them.

277
00:20:19,04 --> 00:20:20,51
你就没有利用价值了
You understand? Nothing.

278
00:20:20,68 --> 00:20:22,87
懂吗？一文不值

279
00:20:23,05 --> 00:20:29,58
魔术的秘密没啥了不起 变魔术的技巧才重要
The secret impresses no one.

280
00:20:25,72 --> 00:20:29,31
The trick you use it for is everything.

281
00:20:34,09 --> 00:20:38,39
-谢谢你请客，波登先生 -不客气
Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.

282
00:20:36,56 --> 00:20:38,05
You're welcome.

283
00:20:39,90 --> 00:20:43,10
-艾佛，叫我艾佛 -艾佛
Alfred, it's Alfred.

284
00:20:41,24 --> 00:20:42,83
Alfred.

285
00:20:43,27 --> 00:20:46,14
我很想进去喝杯茶
So I could use a cup of tea.

286
00:20:46,31 --> 00:20:50,64
我怕房东说闲话，最好不要
I can't allow... It's the landlord. It's not...

287
00:20:51,31 --> 00:20:54,25
你以为这样我就进不去？
You think that's... Is that enough to keep me out?

288
00:20:54,21 --> 00:20:57,45
I think so.

289
00:20:56,48 --> 00:20:57,64
我想是吧

290
00:20:58,78 --> 00:21:00,41
我们会再见面吧？
So I'll see you again?

291
00:21:09,63 --> 00:21:11,99
牛奶或糖？
Milk and sugar?

292
00:21:33,22 --> 00:21:37,12
-那是什么东西？ -安杰的机关
What's in there?

293
00:21:34,89 --> 00:21:36,82
Angier's machine.

294
00:21:45,83 --> 00:21:47,26
这是你打造的吗？
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

295
00:21:47,43 --> 00:21:50,23
不，这不是魔术师打造的
Oh, no, sir. This wasn't built by a magician.

296
00:21:50,40 --> 00:21:52,34
这是天才的杰作
This was built by a wizard.

297
00:21:52,50 --> 00:21:57,13
他能让魔术师的戏法成真
A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do.

298
00:21:57,31 --> 00:22:01,68
法官大人，这些道具会怎么处理？
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens with these things after the trial?

299
00:22:01,85 --> 00:22:03,58
卖给卡德洛爵士
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

300
00:22:03,75 --> 00:22:06,55
他对这案子很有兴趣
An avid collector, very interested in the case.

301
00:22:06,72 --> 00:22:09,15
千万别让他拿走这样东西
Yeah. Well, don't let him take this.

302
00:22:09,32 --> 00:22:11,08
-为什么？ -太危险了
- Why ever not? - It's too dangerous.

303
00:22:12,06 --> 00:22:16,65
它只是造型很炫，但功能很简单
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles

304
00:22:14,03 --> 00:22:16,33
it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

305
00:22:16,83 --> 00:22:19,73
的确是简单得令人失望
The most disappointing of all, sir.

306
00:22:21,23 --> 00:22:23,26
因为这不是魔术
It has no trick.

307
00:22:25,57 --> 00:22:27,00
这是真的
It's real.

308
00:22:30,21 --> 00:22:34,54
-这就是淹死安杰的水箱？ -是的
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

309
00:22:32,21 --> 00:22:34,27
Yes.

310
00:22:34,71 --> 00:22:41,08
这就是机关 魔术师的手穿过这里打开假锁
This is the...

311
00:22:36,58 --> 00:22:39,64
...place where the performer's hand reaches through

312
00:22:39,72 --> 00:22:40,98
to the trick padlock.

313
00:22:41,25 --> 00:22:43,59
标准的魔术脱逃机关？
A standard magical apparatus for escapes?

314
00:22:43,76 --> 00:22:46,12
对，但是有一个地方不同
Yeah, with one important difference.

315
00:22:46,29 --> 00:22:48,19
这不是假锁
This isn't a trick lock.

316
00:22:48,36 --> 00:22:50,29
它被换成真锁
It's been switched for a real one.

317
00:22:50,46 --> 00:22:52,36
真是杀人的好方法
What a way to kill someone.

318
00:22:52,93 --> 00:22:56,37
他们是魔术师，法官大人 表演者…
They're magicians, Your Honor.

319
00:22:54,90 --> 00:23:00,31
Showmen, men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths,

320
00:22:56,54 --> 00:23:00,56
他们利用普通事物掩盖残酷真相

321
00:23:01,11 --> 00:23:03,63
让人感到惊奇…震撼
to amaze, to shock.

322
00:23:03,81 --> 00:23:06,18
就算没有观众？
Even without an audience?

323
00:23:07,28 --> 00:23:09,08
有一个观众
There was an audience.

324
00:23:09,98 --> 00:23:12,08
这座水箱
You see, this water tank

325
00:23:12,25 --> 00:23:16,45
对他们有特别的意义
was of particular significance to these two men.

326
00:23:16,89 --> 00:23:19,52
很可怕的意义
Particularly awful significance.

327
00:23:22,26 --> 00:23:27,26
谁有胆量上台绑住这位美女？
Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

328
00:23:29,20 --> 00:23:31,17
绑住她的手腕
If you would tie her wrists,

329
00:23:31,34 --> 00:23:33,50
还有她的腿和脚踝
bind her feet around the ankle.

330
00:23:46,92 --> 00:23:48,78
你们是水手吗？
- Are either of you gentlemen sailors? - No.

331
00:23:48,95 --> 00:23:49,98
不是

332
00:23:51,46 --> 00:23:54,36
我想你们应该都会打的很紧
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

333
00:24:48,85 --> 00:24:49,87
劳勃！
Robert!

334
00:25:10,44 --> 00:25:12,77
不！不！不！
No, no.

335
00:25:15,67 --> 00:25:20,01
茱莉亚…茱莉亚…

336
00:25:17,21 --> 00:25:19,74
Julia. Julia!

337
00:26:04,76 --> 00:26:07,49
我认识一名老水手
I knew an old sailor once.

338
00:26:07,66 --> 00:26:12,65
他说他曾经落水，被船帆缠住
They told me he went overboard,

339
00:26:10,33 --> 00:26:12,42
tangled in the sails.

340
00:26:12,83 --> 00:26:18,46
他们整整花了五分钟救活他
They pulled him out,

341
00:26:14,37 --> 00:26:18,27
but it took him five minutes to cough.

342
00:26:18,64 --> 00:26:22,57
他说感觉好像回到家
He said it was like...

343
00:26:20,44 --> 00:26:22,27
...going home.

344
00:26:27,81 --> 00:26:30,18
波登，你想干什么？
What do you want, Borden?

345
00:26:37,06 --> 00:26:39,02
请你节哀顺变，安杰
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

346
00:26:42,90 --> 00:26:45,92
你到底绑了什么结？
Which knot did you tie?

347
00:26:48,07 --> 00:26:49,59
我一直问我自己这件事
I keep asking myself that.

348
00:26:51,10 --> 00:26:53,83
结果呢？
- And? - And...

349
00:26:55,01 --> 00:26:57,67
抱歉 我…我真的不知道
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

350
00:26:59,81 --> 00:27:01,28
你不知道？
You don't know?

351
00:27:02,75 --> 00:27:04,77
对不起
I'm sorry.

352
00:27:06,05 --> 00:27:07,88
你不知道？
You don't know?

353
00:27:12,29 --> 00:27:14,35
你不知道？
You don't know?!

354
00:27:20,83 --> 00:27:21,96
艾佛？
- Alfred? - Good news. We got our first booking.

355
00:27:22,47 --> 00:27:23,93
好消息，我们今天有表演了

356
00:27:24,14 --> 00:27:27,54
-我们没见过面吧 -法隆是我的机关师
I don't think we've had the pleasure.

357
00:27:27,71 --> 00:27:31,20
-你从哪里拿到这些…？ -求来的、借来的，别问了
<i>- Mr. Fallon is my ingnieur. - Where did you get all...?</i>

358
00:27:29,31 --> 00:27:33,30
- I had to borrow and... don't ask. - He's a very enterprising soul

359
00:27:31,38 --> 00:27:35,47
这位法隆先生很有办法

360
00:27:33,38 --> 00:27:35,18
is... is Mr. Fallon. So...

361
00:27:35,65 --> 00:27:37,01
我们没钱支付他
- We can't afford to pay him. - The money will come with the audience.

362
00:27:37,18 --> 00:27:39,05
有观众就会有钱

363
00:27:39,22 --> 00:27:42,71
那现在呢？我赚的钱只够养活我们俩
But what about until then? What I earn, it's barely enough for us.

364
00:27:42,89 --> 00:27:46,02
别担心，我的食物分他一半
Don't worry about it. I'll share half my food with him or something.

365
00:27:46,99 --> 00:27:49,83
你得先分给另一个人
You're going to be doing that with someone else.

366
00:27:50,00 --> 00:27:54,09
-不会吧？你…？ -我要生宝宝了
No. You're...

367
00:27:51,56 --> 00:27:53,83
Having a baby.

368
00:27:54,77 --> 00:27:58,03
天啊，我们应该告诉法隆
Oh, my God.

369
00:27:58,20 --> 00:28:00,00
棒呆了，我们有孩子了
We should have told Fallon. That is great.

370
00:28:00,17 --> 00:28:02,87
-我们有孩子了 -过来
Oh, come here.

371
00:28:02,31 --> 00:28:05,28
Oh.

372
00:28:05,88 --> 00:28:07,17
艾佛，这是什么？
Alfred, what is this?

373
00:28:07,35 --> 00:28:11,37
这是用来吸引经纪人的戏法
Oh, this is just the trick to work Ackerman up at the end of my act.

374
00:28:11,55 --> 00:28:14,18
这就是你所谓的伟大魔术？
Is it the masterpiece, the great trick?

375
00:28:14,35 --> 00:28:16,91
不是，市场还不够成熟
No, no, no, the world is not ready for that one yet.

376
00:28:17,09 --> 00:28:21,39
这只是一般的“接子弹”把戏
This is just your run-of-the-mill, daring, spectacular bullet catch.

377
00:28:22,13 --> 00:28:26,36
-接子弹 -对，很安全，我保证，你看
- A bullet catch. - Yeah, but it's safe.

378
00:28:23,80 --> 00:28:26,10
I promise. Look.

379
00:28:28,87 --> 00:28:31,03
-向我开枪 -向你开枪？
- Shoot me. - Shoot you?

380
00:28:31,20 --> 00:28:32,26
来吧，开枪
Go on, shoot me.

381
00:28:34,67 --> 00:28:36,87
-射这里 -我办不到
- Right there. - No, I can't.

382
00:28:37,04 --> 00:28:39,91
不是射那里，射我胸口
No, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't...

383
00:28:44,58 --> 00:28:48,25
-怎么样？ -太神了
How's that?

384
00:28:46,39 --> 00:28:49,72
That's very good. Tell me how you do it.

385
00:28:48,42 --> 00:28:51,12
-你是怎么做到的？ -我不能告诉你
No, I can't do that.

386
00:28:53,39 --> 00:28:56,19
-那你就不准表演 -不准表演？
- Well, then you can't do it. - I can't do it?

387
00:28:56,36 --> 00:28:59,56
对不起，我不能一个人养孩子
I'm sorry, but I can't raise a child on my own.

388
00:29:00,20 --> 00:29:03,43
-那你不能告诉任何人 -好
You don't tell anybody that I told you.

389
00:29:01,74 --> 00:29:04,07
- OK. - Gunpowder.

390
00:29:03,60 --> 00:29:05,33
火药

391
00:29:07,01 --> 00:29:07,99
填弹塞
Wadding.

392
00:29:09,78 --> 00:29:11,50
子弹
Then the bullet.

393
00:29:12,44 --> 00:29:14,21
推弹杆
Ramrod.

394
00:29:18,85 --> 00:29:19,84
伸出你的手
Hold out your hand.

395
00:29:22,99 --> 00:29:26,82
点燃火药时枪管并没有子弹
The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired.

396
00:29:26,99 --> 00:29:30,62
知道了就没什么了不起
Once you know, it's actually very obvious.

397
00:29:31,83 --> 00:29:33,70
不过还是会…
Well, I mean, you still get...

398
00:29:33,87 --> 00:29:36,80
还是很危险，会出人命的
It's dangerous.

399
00:29:35,20 --> 00:29:37,40
- People still get killed doing that. - How?

400
00:29:36,97 --> 00:29:38,20
怎么会？
You get some smartass who could put a penny or a button

401
00:29:38,37 --> 00:29:41,34
有些笨蛋搞不好把铜板放进去

402
00:29:41,51 --> 00:29:43,87
甚至把子弹放进去
or, God forbid, Sarah, somebody could put a bullet down there.

403
00:29:44,48 --> 00:29:47,04
别担心，别担心
Don't worry. Don't worry,

404
00:29:47,21 --> 00:29:50,48
我不会让任何意外发生
because I'm not gonna let anything happen.

405
00:29:50,65 --> 00:29:52,24
一切都不会有事
Everything's gonna be all right because...

406
00:29:52,42 --> 00:29:58,58
因为我非常爱你

407
00:29:54,52 --> 00:29:57,79
...I love you very much.

408
00:30:00,79 --> 00:30:03,99
-再说一次 -我爱你
- Say it again. - I love you.

409
00:30:05,13 --> 00:30:07,50
-今天你不爱我 -什么？
- Not today. - What?

410
00:30:07,67 --> 00:30:10,79
有时你不真诚，今天你不是真心的
Well, some days it's not true, and today you don't mean it.

411
00:30:10,97 --> 00:30:14,06
也许今天你比较爱魔术
Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me.

412
00:30:14,24 --> 00:30:16,57
我能分辨个中的差别
I like being able to tell the difference.

413
00:30:16,74 --> 00:30:21,64
如果真心说爱我今天就更有意义
It makes the days it is true

414
00:30:19,45 --> 00:30:21,78
mean something.

415
00:30:23,85 --> 00:30:25,41
好吧
All right.

416
00:30:44,44 --> 00:30:47,53
各位，这是钢圈
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.

417
00:30:47,71 --> 00:30:50,33
现场有绅士淑女吗？
If there are any ladies and gentlemen here.

418
00:30:50,51 --> 00:30:53,77
-这是实心的 -这表演我看过了
- Solid metal. - Seen that already.

419
00:31:00,72 --> 00:31:03,62
把枪拿出来吧！小子

420
00:31:04,36 --> 00:31:06,35
-是谁丢的？ -是我！
Who threw that?

421
00:31:12,16 --> 00:31:14,96
把枪拿出来，魔术师 你会需要的

422
00:31:18,47 --> 00:31:20,40
拿出枪吧！

423
00:31:22,01 --> 00:31:24,31
你们是想看这个，对吧？
This is what you came for, is it?

424
00:31:27,61 --> 00:31:31,74
那么… 谁要当志愿者？
So...

425
00:31:29,88 --> 00:31:31,78
...who wants to volunteer?

426
00:31:31,92 --> 00:31:34,78
-我要！ -我！我！
- I do! - Me!

427
00:31:41,36 --> 00:31:42,42
Me.

428
00:31:44,70 --> 00:31:46,13
我！
Me.

429
00:32:00,05 --> 00:32:02,41
你够种吗？ 先生
Are you man enough, sir?

430
00:32:07,52 --> 00:32:09,08
是的
Yes.

431
00:32:20,17 --> 00:32:22,10
你到底绑什么结？
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

432
00:32:28,37 --> 00:32:30,53
你到底绑什么结？
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

433
00:32:31,84 --> 00:32:33,44
我不知道
I don't know.

434
00:32:49,06 --> 00:32:52,66
他要我回答，我说了实话
<i>He came in to demand an answer, and I told him the truth.</i>

435
00:32:52,83 --> 00:32:55,82
我为了那件事天人交战
<i>That I have fought with myself over that night,</i>

436
00:32:56,00 --> 00:32:59,46
一半的我发誓绑了简单的绳结
<i>one half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot,</i>

437
00:32:59,64 --> 00:33:02,87
另一半的我记得我绑了蓝氏结
<i>the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double.</i>

438
00:33:03,04 --> 00:33:05,24
我永远都无法确定
<i>I can never know for sure.</i>

439
00:33:07,65 --> 00:33:10,01
他怎么会不知道？
How can he not know!

440
00:33:10,18 --> 00:33:12,51
他怎么会不知道？
<i>How can he not know?</i>

441
00:33:13,59 --> 00:33:17,49
他一定知道自己做了什么 一定的
<i>He must know what he did.</i>

442
00:33:15,82 --> 00:33:17,22
<i>He must.</i>

443
00:33:20,23 --> 00:33:22,16
莎拉，很痛耶
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

444
00:33:23,30 --> 00:33:25,49
我不懂，怎么又流血了？
I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.

445
00:33:25,66 --> 00:33:28,00
根本就没有治好
It's as bad as the day it happened.

446
00:33:29,83 --> 00:33:35,03
-我去请大夫来 -我们请不起大夫
- We have to get a doctor back. - We can't afford the doctor back.

447
00:33:35,21 --> 00:33:37,97
-你吵醒她了 -太好了
- You've woken her. - Great.

448
00:33:38,94 --> 00:33:41,57
伤口愈合了我才能回去表演
I'm sorry, I need this to heal so I can get back to work.

449
00:33:41,75 --> 00:33:45,44
面对现实吧，伤成这样不能表演
You've got to face things. What tricks can you perform with this injury?

450
00:33:45,62 --> 00:33:49,11
我能耍扑克牌、用道具表演
I can do car pulls. I can do some prop tricks.

451
00:33:49,29 --> 00:33:53,59
我还是能表演我说的那个绝招
I can still do that. I can do the trick I've been telling you about.

452
00:33:53,76 --> 00:33:55,75
千古留名的伟大表演
The one that they're gonna remember me for.

453
00:33:58,23 --> 00:34:00,03
相信我
Come on.

454
00:34:25,86 --> 00:34:28,55
没想到答案就在酒杯底下
I never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.

455
00:34:28,73 --> 00:34:30,25
你随时都在找答案
Hasn't stopped your looking.

456
00:34:35,50 --> 00:34:36,73
听说有一场表演
Heard about a booking. Nice little theater.

457
00:34:36,90 --> 00:34:40,53
不错的小戏院 要魔术界的年轻新秀
- Young, up-and-coming magician. - Who?

458
00:34:40,71 --> 00:34:42,10
-要找谁？ -你
- You. - Me? Booking? Why?

459
00:34:42,27 --> 00:34:43,97
你替我找表演机会？为什么？

460
00:34:44,14 --> 00:34:46,04
我想继续工作
I want to keep on working.

461
00:34:46,21 --> 00:34:49,24
谁会雇用害死女助手的机关师？
<i>Who's going to hire the ingnieur that killed Julia McCullough</i>

462
00:34:49,41 --> 00:34:51,64
还是在满座的奥芬大剧院
in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?

463
00:34:52,48 --> 00:34:54,65
那并不是你的错
Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.

464
00:34:54,82 --> 00:34:58,19
波登绑错结，害死茱莉亚
Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.

465
00:34:58,36 --> 00:35:01,81
我听说他表演接子弹出了差错
I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river.

466
00:35:01,99 --> 00:35:04,39
那一招本来就很危险
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

467
00:35:10,10 --> 00:35:11,86
我们得把窗户刷白
We'll have to whitewash the windows,

468
00:35:12,04 --> 00:35:16,44
不要让好奇的行人看进来
confound the more curious members of the public, but it will do.

469
00:35:18,08 --> 00:35:21,01
-我们先得找一名助手 -我已经找到了
- We should see about an assistant. - I've made some arrangements.

470
00:35:22,08 --> 00:35:24,57
你想好艺名了吗？
You settled on a name?

471
00:35:24,75 --> 00:35:28,19
想好了，魔术大师丹顿
Yes, I have.

472
00:35:26,12 --> 00:35:27,98
The Great Danton.

473
00:35:28,35 --> 00:35:30,82
似乎有点老派？
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

474
00:35:32,36 --> 00:35:34,48
不，这对我意义非凡
No, it's sophisticated.

475
00:35:34,66 --> 00:35:37,09
大家都看过这招鸟笼魔术
The birdcage can't be our climax. Everybody knows it.

476
00:35:37,26 --> 00:35:39,79
-他们没看过这一招 -我不想杀鸽子
- Not like this. - I don't want to kill doves.

477
00:35:39,96 --> 00:35:43,49
那就别干这行 魔术师不是巫师
Then stay off the stage.

478
00:35:41,53 --> 00:35:43,23
You're a magician, not a wizard.

479
00:35:43,67 --> 00:35:47,54
你想成功，就得杀生
You got to get your hands dirty, if you're going to achieve the impossible.

480
00:35:48,97 --> 00:35:51,31
这边请，温小姐
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

481
00:35:51,48 --> 00:35:54,84
要是塞不进去你就白来了
No point in meeting Mr. Angier if you don't fit. On the right.

482
00:35:55,01 --> 00:35:56,98
站右边

483
00:35:59,02 --> 00:36:00,25
这有什么难？
- What's so hard about this? - Nothing.

484
00:36:00,42 --> 00:36:03,65
并不难，你要躺在下面
You're going... down here.

485
00:36:06,06 --> 00:36:09,36
握住它，这要绕到另一边

486
00:36:09,53 --> 00:36:11,62
-这样就能隐藏鸟笼？ -没错，当然
- And this will conceal, right? - Oh, sure.

487
00:36:11,80 --> 00:36:13,06
-好了吗？ -好了
- Tighten up on there. - Yep.

488
00:36:13,23 --> 00:36:15,67
把这个别在下面
OK.

489
00:36:15,83 --> 00:36:18,30
这绑在这里？

490
00:36:18,47 --> 00:36:20,27
-这绑在前面 -很好
This ties up here?

491
00:36:18,64 --> 00:36:20,04
- Ties in the back. - Good.

492
00:36:26,48 --> 00:36:29,24
尽量憋住气
Breathe as little as possible.

493
00:36:34,95 --> 00:36:37,72
看到没？它会被压扁
Now, you see?

494
00:36:37,89 --> 00:36:39,19
-我懂了 -好
- That's it. - OK.

495
00:36:42,66 --> 00:36:46,03
她没经验，不过很会秀自己
She's not experienced,

496
00:36:44,26 --> 00:36:46,29
but she knows how to present herself.

497
00:36:46,70 --> 00:36:51,00
美丽的女助手最能转移注意力
A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection.

498
00:36:51,40 --> 00:36:52,53
谢谢大家
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick,

499
00:36:52,70 --> 00:36:54,70
各位，最后的魔术表演

500
00:36:54,87 --> 00:36:57,54
需要两名志愿者
I will require the assistance of two volunteers.

501
00:36:57,71 --> 00:37:00,04
梅老板，麻烦你
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

502
00:37:01,85 --> 00:37:05,01
用手盖住
Yep.

503
00:37:05,38 --> 00:37:06,78
底下？
- Under? - Under, yeah.

504
00:37:07,52 --> 00:37:09,71
绕住他的脚
Come around his foot.

505
00:37:09,89 --> 00:37:11,12
-小心点 -他没问题
- Careful. - It's all right.

506
00:37:32,11 --> 00:37:34,94
一名志愿者把手放这里
- Your volunteer, put their hand there. - Yeah?

507
00:37:35,11 --> 00:37:36,17
另一名放在那里
And another one here.

508
00:37:36,35 --> 00:37:40,01
梅老板，把手放在鸟笼的两侧
If you'll place your hands on either side of the cage, please.

509
00:37:40,18 --> 00:37:41,17
谢谢你，奥莉薇雅
Thank you, Olivia.

510
00:37:41,35 --> 00:37:43,15
你最好别…
You best not be intending to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.

511
00:37:43,32 --> 00:37:45,79
-伤害小动物，安杰 -当然不会

512
00:37:45,96 --> 00:37:48,19
准备好了吗？
- Of course not. - Ready? Right.

513
00:37:48,36 --> 00:37:49,92
一…
- One... - Two...

514
00:37:50,09 --> 00:37:51,15
二…
Three.

515
00:37:51,83 --> 00:37:53,99
-三… -变

516
00:37:57,14 --> 00:37:58,80
太惊人了
That's bloody marvelous, Cutter.

517
00:37:59,90 --> 00:38:01,03
太棒了
Very nice.

518
00:38:01,21 --> 00:38:03,33
最棒的是…
And the best part is...

519
00:38:08,61 --> 00:38:10,74
我以为我得杀生
I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.

520
00:38:10,92 --> 00:38:14,32
将来也许，我只想确定你行不行
Someday, perhaps you will.

521
00:38:12,49 --> 00:38:14,04
I just had to know that you can.

522
00:38:14,49 --> 00:38:17,22
很不错，真的很棒
Very nice. Very nice, indeed.

523
00:38:17,39 --> 00:38:20,22
谢谢你，你的剧院也很棒
I haven't had the chance to compliment you on your beautiful theater.

524
00:38:20,39 --> 00:38:22,72
坐满了观众会更棒
It'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full.

525
00:38:22,89 --> 00:38:24,73
-别担心 -你们都这么说
Don't worry.

526
00:38:23,36 --> 00:38:25,59
You all say that. Why should I worry?

527
00:38:24,90 --> 00:38:28,70
我才不担心 你不行我换人就是了
If your tricks don't get them in, somebody else's will.

528
00:38:28,87 --> 00:38:33,03
或许有人愿意接子弹或水底脱逃
Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape?

529
00:38:33,20 --> 00:38:34,57
那是洒狗血的技俩
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

530
00:38:34,74 --> 00:38:38,37
大家只想看发生意外
People hoping for an accident, likely to see one too.

531
00:38:38,54 --> 00:38:41,07
那对你的生意有什么好处？
What would that do for your business?

532
00:38:40,21 --> 00:38:43,08
You got a week, John.

533
00:38:42,05 --> 00:38:44,48
-给你一个星期，约翰 -谢谢你，梅老板
Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

534
00:38:48,82 --> 00:38:50,05
(魔术大师丹顿)

535
00:38:54,89 --> 00:38:56,86
谢谢
Thank you.

536
00:38:59,00 --> 00:39:01,56
那位先生，第三排
Uh... Sir, in the third row there.

537
00:39:01,73 --> 00:39:04,53
请站起来让大家看你的手帕
Please stand up and show us your handkerchief.

538
00:39:07,01 --> 00:39:08,17
这不是我的
This isn't mine.

539
00:39:08,34 --> 00:39:11,43
请你把手帕还给第二排的女士
Perhaps you'd return it to the lady in the aisle of the second row.

540
00:39:11,61 --> 00:39:12,91
我相信她有你的手帕
I believe she has yours.

541
00:39:16,51 --> 00:39:18,11
谢谢

542
00:39:20,28 --> 00:39:22,68
抱歉，我一直出错
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making so many mistakes. I'm so nervous.

543
00:39:22,85 --> 00:39:24,69
我好紧张

544
00:39:25,36 --> 00:39:27,38
观众好像没什么反应
The audience doesn't seem to be responding.

545
00:39:27,56 --> 00:39:32,36
我保证下一个魔术他们从没看过
They've seen a lot of tricks before,

546
00:39:29,50 --> 00:39:31,99
but not this next one.

547
00:39:41,14 --> 00:39:43,33
拿一块布遮住
Cloth over.

548
00:39:43,51 --> 00:39:46,31
-祝我好运 -我会准备香槟庆祝
Keep your fingers crossed.

549
00:39:44,71 --> 00:39:46,97
I'll have the champagne ready.

550
00:40:02,19 --> 00:40:04,59
-你们看过这一招？ -老套了
- You've seen this one before? - We've seen them all before.

551
00:40:04,76 --> 00:40:07,20
那我就让它更具挑战性
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

552
00:40:07,37 --> 00:40:12,80
我要两位志愿者 一男一女跟我一起握住鸟笼
Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentlemen.

553
00:40:10,07 --> 00:40:13,27
To hold this cage with me.

554
00:40:13,44 --> 00:40:17,17
我要表演前所未有、世界首创
I'll perform this feat in a manner

555
00:40:15,37 --> 00:40:19,90
never before seen by yourselves or any other audience anywhere in the world.

556
00:40:17,34 --> 00:40:20,17
无人见识过的全新魔术

557
00:40:22,78 --> 00:40:26,88
一只手放后面，另一只放前面
Madame, place one hand on the back of the cage,

558
00:40:25,08 --> 00:40:26,61
one hand on the front.

559
00:40:27,05 --> 00:40:30,92
先生，一只手放底下 另一只放上面
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage

560
00:40:29,12 --> 00:40:30,65
one hand on the top.

561
00:40:44,34 --> 00:40:46,93
-我早该认出他来 -你忙着表演
- I should've spotted him. - You had a lot of plates going.

562
00:40:47,10 --> 00:40:49,37
-他们不会让我再秀这一招了 -没错
- Don't suppose we can do this again. - No.

563
00:40:49,54 --> 00:40:53,34
-那要用哪一招当压轴？ -压轴？你没得表演了
- So, what's the climax of our show? - Show?

564
00:40:51,85 --> 00:40:54,97
- You don't have a show. - We have a week's engagement.

565
00:40:53,51 --> 00:40:55,10
梅老板，我们的合约是一星期

566
00:40:55,28 --> 00:40:58,91
我要你变魔术 不是杀小鸟或折断客人手指
To perform magic, not butcher birds and break my customers' fingers.

567
00:40:59,08 --> 00:41:01,52
卷铺盖滚蛋，不然就全烧掉
Clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned.

568
00:41:01,69 --> 00:41:04,02
没得谈了
- Mr. Merrit... - It's done, John.

569
00:41:04,19 --> 00:41:07,82
我找了个谐星 你知道我最讨厌谐星
I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians.

570
00:41:09,33 --> 00:41:11,52
好吧，好剧院多得是
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.

571
00:41:11,70 --> 00:41:15,69
我们找个新魔术，换个艺名…
If we can come up with a new trick,

572
00:41:15,87 --> 00:41:17,73
我不换艺名
- change the name of the act. - The name stays.

573
00:41:19,70 --> 00:41:24,70
好吧，不过新魔术一定要很炫
Right, well, then the new trick's gonna have to be irresistible then.

574
00:41:24,88 --> 00:41:26,64
我还有好几招可以试
I have a couple of methods to try out.

575
00:41:26,81 --> 00:41:30,11
但要有新的表现方式
And then we need a new angle on the presentation.

576
00:41:30,28 --> 00:41:32,08
如果你要找灵感
And if you need some inspiration,

577
00:41:32,25 --> 00:41:35,24
皇家亚伯厅本周有个科技展
there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week.

578
00:41:35,42 --> 00:41:38,08
工程师、科学家都会去
Engineers, scientists, you know?

579
00:41:38,26 --> 00:41:41,42
这些事物吸引大众的好奇心
That sort of thing captures the public's imagination.

580
00:41:58,54 --> 00:42:01,88
我能坐这儿吗？ 泰斯拉在暴风雨时派我来
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me down here during the storms.

581
00:42:02,05 --> 00:42:05,17
是陪丹顿大师喝一杯的好借口
Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink.

582
00:42:06,38 --> 00:42:08,18
来两杯
Two of them.

583
00:42:08,72 --> 00:42:11,24
这雨下得真好，我好想念纽约
Beautiful, isn't it? God, I miss New York, though.

584
00:42:11,42 --> 00:42:13,79
-你来这里干嘛？ -这里有闪电，而且人烟稀少
- Why are you here? - The lightning lives here.

585
00:42:13,96 --> 00:42:17,05
我们的工作是秘密
And not much else.

586
00:42:15,43 --> 00:42:16,95
Our work is secret.

587
00:42:17,83 --> 00:42:19,59
这是字谜吗？
That a cipher?

588
00:42:21,80 --> 00:42:24,77
这本日记每天都换字母密码
A rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary.

589
00:42:24,94 --> 00:42:28,77
看似简单，就算有字母密码 解码也会花很多时间
Simple but time-consuming to translate, even with the five-letter keyword.

590
00:42:28,94 --> 00:42:30,70
密码是什么？
Which is?

591
00:42:30,88 --> 00:42:32,78
我们魔术师有道义要保密
We magicians have a circle of trust.

592
00:42:32,94 --> 00:42:36,88
你偷别人的日记也叫道义？
You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole?

593
00:42:37,05 --> 00:42:38,07
搞不好我是用买的
Maybe I bought it.

594
00:42:38,92 --> 00:42:41,58
你想从里面找出秘密
And you're hoping to find a great secret in there?

595
00:42:41,75 --> 00:42:45,42
我找到了，所以才来这里
I've already found it.

596
00:42:43,92 --> 00:42:45,32
That's why I'm here.

597
00:42:52,23 --> 00:42:54,72
泰斯拉替一名魔术师做了机关
Tesla built one for another magician.

598
00:42:54,90 --> 00:42:58,16
-你干嘛要同样的东西？ -这是同行间的较劲
Why would you want the same thing?

599
00:42:56,07 --> 00:42:58,06
Call it a professional rivalry.

600
00:42:58,70 --> 00:43:02,97
泰斯拉专门帮怪人做古怪的机关
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people.

601
00:43:03,14 --> 00:43:04,73
但我们不会说出去的
- But he would never talk about it. - I understand discretion.

602
00:43:04,91 --> 00:43:07,84
没问题，我只想要那台机关

603
00:43:06,45 --> 00:43:07,74
I just want the machine.

604
00:43:11,15 --> 00:43:13,05
把酒干了
Finish your drink.

605
00:43:14,05 --> 00:43:15,38
我带你去看样东西
I want to show you something. I think you'll have

606
00:43:15,55 --> 00:43:18,78
你会很佩服我们的工作
a special appreciation for our work.

607
00:43:18,96 --> 00:43:22,36
-我以为那是秘密 -你是魔术师
- I thought it was a secret. - You're a magician.

608
00:43:22,53 --> 00:43:24,19
谁会相信你说的话？
Who's gonna believe you?

609
00:43:25,50 --> 00:43:27,52
就快到了
Not long now.

610
00:43:27,70 --> 00:43:30,10
我们的装备需要大量的电力
Our equipment requires a great deal of current.

611
00:43:30,27 --> 00:43:34,10
泰斯拉替全镇提供电力 交换条件是使用发电机的权利
Tesla electrified the whole town

612
00:43:31,84 --> 00:43:34,90
in exchange for using the generators when we need them.

613
00:43:36,31 --> 00:43:39,37
我们趁镇民睡着时做实验
We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep.

614
00:43:39,54 --> 00:43:42,14
泰斯拉不想吓到大家
Mr. Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.

615
00:44:00,13 --> 00:44:02,03
电线在哪里？
Where are the wires?

616
00:44:03,17 --> 00:44:04,66
问得好
Exactly.

617
00:44:13,98 --> 00:44:18,07
-发电机呢？ -就是你上星期看到的那台
Where's the generator?

618
00:44:16,55 --> 00:44:17,98
You saw it last week.

619
00:44:18,25 --> 00:44:21,22
-离这里有十英里 -十五英里
- That must be ten miles from here. - Fifteen.

620
00:44:21,39 --> 00:44:25,38
每天都要骑这么远才能回家睡觉
And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed.

621
00:44:25,56 --> 00:44:28,18
过几天我会给你消息
I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr. Angier.

622
00:44:28,36 --> 00:44:32,39
魔法，真正的魔法
<i>Magic. Real magic.</i>

623
00:44:32,33 --> 00:44:34,46
Now appearing, only here at London's Royal Albert Hall,

624
00:44:34,60 --> 00:44:36,50
这一切都只在皇家亚伯厅展出

625
00:44:37,23 --> 00:44:38,86
这个时代的奇迹
one of the miracles of our age.

626
00:44:39,04 --> 00:44:41,16
科技的惊奇
A technological marvel. You've never seen anything like it in your lives.

627
00:44:41,34 --> 00:44:43,57
你这辈子从来没看过

628
00:44:43,74 --> 00:44:46,11
就算亲眼目睹也不敢相信
Your eyes will not believe what they're witnessing.

629
00:44:46,28 --> 00:44:49,34
各位先生女士，泰斯拉的奇迹
The miracle of Nikola Tesla, ladies and gentlemen.

630
00:44:49,51 --> 00:44:51,88
零污染的免费电力 你想看到未来吗？
Free, clean power. Like to know the future?

631
00:44:52,05 --> 00:44:54,42
那个人将改变世界
The man who's speaking right now is going to change the world.

632
00:44:54,59 --> 00:44:59,42
女士先生，快进来坐 位子很多，不用等
Come one, come all. Immediate seating, no waiting.

633
00:45:14,57 --> 00:45:17,87
各位女士先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

634
00:45:18,04 --> 00:45:19,74
有些观众有意见
objections have been raised...

635
00:45:19,91 --> 00:45:23,18
-担心安全的问题… -是应该有意见，你认为安全吗？
They should be raised. Does that look safe to you?

636
00:45:23,35 --> 00:45:25,87
这是爱迪生的毁谤行动
Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign

637
00:45:26,05 --> 00:45:29,92
故意中伤泰斯拉的交流电研究
against Mr. Tesla's superior alternating current.

638
00:45:30,09 --> 00:45:31,65
艾利，拜托

639
00:45:31,82 --> 00:45:34,31
我们要求泰斯拉…
We have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider.

640
00:45:34,49 --> 00:45:37,12
-放弃展出 -但是他不会
Which he will not!

641
00:45:37,29 --> 00:45:41,49
不过他拒绝在受限情况下现身
But I've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions.

642
00:45:42,57 --> 00:45:44,97
快走，这东西快爆炸了
This thing's gonna blow.

643
00:45:45,14 --> 00:45:47,73
-快出去！ -拜托大家别紧张
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

644
00:45:48,47 --> 00:45:50,44
开关在哪里？

645
00:45:54,34 --> 00:45:56,61
这百分之百安全

646
00:46:27,58 --> 00:46:28,60
嗨！
Hey.

647
00:46:30,51 --> 00:46:33,28
嗨，洁丝
Hello, Jess.

648
00:46:35,92 --> 00:46:38,44
你今天跟妈妈过得好吗？
Have you had a nice day with mommy? Huh?

649
00:46:40,56 --> 00:46:43,69
莎拉，我爱你
Sarah.

650
00:46:43,86 --> 00:46:47,23
你今天是真心说爱我
- I love you. - See, today it's true.

651
00:46:45,47 --> 00:46:48,03
- Yeah. - Hello.

652
00:46:47,40 --> 00:46:49,06
哈！

653
00:46:50,10 --> 00:46:52,40
我看见了幸福
<i>I saw happiness.</i>

654
00:46:52,74 --> 00:46:55,71
应该属于我的幸福
<i>Happiness that should have been mine.</i>

655
00:46:55,87 --> 00:46:57,20
但是我错了
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

656
00:46:57,37 --> 00:47:01,94
笔记中透露 他没有我所羡慕的生活
<i>His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied.</i>

657
00:47:02,11 --> 00:47:04,64
前一刻他渴望的家庭生活
<i>The family life that he craves one minute,</i>

658
00:47:04,82 --> 00:47:08,91
下一刻就想反抗、追求自由
<i>he rails against the next, demanding freedom.</i>

659
00:47:09,09 --> 00:47:11,95
他的精神分裂…
<i>His mind... his mind is a divided one.</i>

660
00:47:12,12 --> 00:47:13,95
心灵无法平静
<i>His soul is restless.</i>

661
00:47:14,12 --> 00:47:20,32
易变和矛盾的天性折磨着妻女
<i>His wife and child, tormented</i>

662
00:47:15,73 --> 00:47:19,69
<i>by his fickle and contradictory nature.</i>

663
00:47:24,10 --> 00:47:26,50
你要叫洋娃娃什么名字？
So, what do you think you'll call her?

664
00:47:26,67 --> 00:47:27,93
不知道
I don't know.

665
00:47:28,11 --> 00:47:30,34
大家都有名字啊，她呢？
Everybody needs a name, so, what's hers?

666
00:47:31,28 --> 00:47:33,00
那就叫莎拉吧
Maybe Sarah.

667
00:47:35,41 --> 00:47:37,78
很美的名字 很美的名字
That's a lovely name. That's a lovely name.

668
00:47:37,95 --> 00:47:41,08
你们聊聊今天想做的事
Well, you talk about what you want to do for the rest of the day.

669
00:47:41,25 --> 00:47:43,01
去跟她说吧
All right, go on, you talk with her.

670
00:47:45,56 --> 00:47:47,55
他们要把她带走？
Are they taking her away?

671
00:47:49,76 --> 00:47:50,75
送到童工工厂？
To the workhouse?

672
00:47:54,00 --> 00:47:56,02
来，你们继续说话
You keep talking.

673
00:47:58,74 --> 00:48:01,93
告诉欧文我答应了，拿去吧
Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it.

674
00:48:01,11 --> 00:48:02,90
Go on, take it.

675
00:48:06,71 --> 00:48:08,77
这样对大家最好
It's for the best.

676
00:48:13,92 --> 00:48:15,75
给我看
Let me see.

677
00:48:17,02 --> 00:48:21,82
-我要学会大师你所有的绝招 -我得先教你识字
I'm gonna learn all the professor's secrets.

678
00:48:18,79 --> 00:48:22,23
Only if I teach you how to read.

679
00:48:22,46 --> 00:48:24,65
这些魔术没有屁用
They're just stupid tricks, right?

680
00:48:24,83 --> 00:48:27,59
完全不能帮你逃出去
Haven't helped you get out of here, have they?

681
00:48:28,37 --> 00:48:31,63
大师，你能解开真的锁吗？
Or can't you undo real locks, professor?

682
00:48:32,84 --> 00:48:35,50
也许我只是在等待时机
Maybe I'm just biding my time.

683
00:48:35,67 --> 00:48:41,51
有一天我会张开双手请你看 然后问
Maybe one day I'll...

684
00:48:38,04 --> 00:48:40,67
...open my hand, get your attention,

685
00:48:41,68 --> 00:48:43,74
你在注意看吗？
ask, "Are you watching closely?"

686
00:48:43,91 --> 00:48:46,68
也许念一、两句咒语
Maybe a magic whirl or two.

687
00:48:48,75 --> 00:48:51,05
然后我就消失不见
And then I'll be gone.

688
00:48:54,32 --> 00:48:57,56
你凭什么这么出名？
How'd you get so famous then?

689
00:48:58,06 --> 00:48:59,69
魔术
Magic.

690
00:49:02,03 --> 00:49:04,90
Oi! Borden, get back here!

691
00:49:03,57 --> 00:49:05,00
波登，给我回来
Thank you.

692
00:49:05,17 --> 00:49:06,64
多谢啦！
Shut up!

693
00:49:07,27 --> 00:49:09,54
闭嘴 抓住他

694
00:49:10,21 --> 00:49:11,94
谢谢

695
00:49:12,11 --> 00:49:14,10
谁有钥匙？
Where's the bloody key?!

696
00:49:20,72 --> 00:49:23,21
1899年2月8日
<i>February 8, 1899.</i>

697
00:49:23,39 --> 00:49:25,36
今天终于有了突破
<i>Today, finally, a breakthrough.</i>

698
00:49:26,02 --> 00:49:28,15
泰斯拉同意见我
<i>Tesla's agreed to see me.</i>

699
00:49:35,93 --> 00:49:37,03
这很百分之百安全
Perfectly safe.

700
00:49:59,12 --> 00:50:02,22
你是魔术大师丹顿
So this is the Great Danton.

701
00:50:02,56 --> 00:50:07,02
艾利经常说你的表演很精彩
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions.

702
00:50:08,93 --> 00:50:10,40
伸出另一只手
Hold out other hand.

703
00:50:19,11 --> 00:50:20,94
电流从哪里通过？
- What's conducting the electricity? - Our bodies, Mr. Angier.

704
00:50:21,11 --> 00:50:24,41
我们的身体能生产

705
00:50:22,78 --> 00:50:26,98
Quite capable of conducting and, indeed, producing energy.

706
00:50:24,58 --> 00:50:27,07
并制造能源

707
00:50:28,65 --> 00:50:30,68
你吃过了吗？
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

708
00:50:33,76 --> 00:50:35,75
我需要惊世骇俗的魔术
I need something impossible.

709
00:50:37,59 --> 00:50:42,29
你听过这句俗话吗？ “心有余而力不足”
You're familiar with the phrase, "Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

710
00:50:42,83 --> 00:50:44,06
那不是真话
Is a lie.

711
00:50:44,23 --> 00:50:46,20
人类只是胆量不够
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

712
00:50:47,34 --> 00:50:50,24
社会一次只能接受一种改变
Society only tolerates one change at a time.

713
00:50:51,74 --> 00:50:54,97
我第一次试着改变世界…
First time I tried to change the world,

714
00:50:55,15 --> 00:50:56,77
被称为先知
I was hailed as a visionary.

715
00:50:57,38 --> 00:51:02,88
第二次他们却请我退休
Second time...

716
00:50:59,42 --> 00:51:02,44
...I was asked politely to retire.

717
00:51:03,95 --> 00:51:06,86
所以我在这里享受退休时光
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

718
00:51:07,39 --> 00:51:09,29
没有不可能的事
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive.

719
00:51:09,46 --> 00:51:11,15
只是很昂贵

720
00:51:11,80 --> 00:51:13,76
你只用这机器
If I were to build for you this machine,

721
00:51:13,93 --> 00:51:16,59
来表演魔术？
you would be presenting it merely as illusion?

722
00:51:16,77 --> 00:51:20,13
如果大家把我的表演当真
Well, if people actually believed the things I did on stage,

723
00:51:20,30 --> 00:51:23,90
就不会鼓掌，只会尖叫 想想看，把女人锯成两半
they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.

724
00:51:22,44 --> 00:51:24,43
Think of sawing a woman in half.

725
00:51:24,07 --> 00:51:26,94
你想过这机器的代价吗？
Have you considered the cost of this?

726
00:51:27,11 --> 00:51:28,94
钱不是问题
Price is not an object.

727
00:51:29,61 --> 00:51:32,98
或许吧，你有想过代价吗？
Perhaps not, but have you considered the cost?

728
00:51:34,02 --> 00:51:35,28
我不懂你的意思
I'm not sure I follow.

729
00:51:36,39 --> 00:51:38,18
回家吧，忘了这件事
Go home, forget this thing.

730
00:51:38,62 --> 00:51:40,45
我看得出你着了魔
I can recognize an obsession.

731
00:51:41,09 --> 00:51:42,62
这不会有好事
- No good will come of it. - Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

732
00:51:42,79 --> 00:51:44,59
你自己着了魔也没好事吗？

733
00:51:45,26 --> 00:51:47,86
一开始有，但我沉迷太久了
At first, but I have followed them too long.

734
00:51:48,03 --> 00:51:53,47
我成了它的奴隶 总有一天，它们会毁了我
I am their slave.

735
00:51:49,84 --> 00:51:52,93
And one day, they will choose to destroy me.

736
00:51:55,04 --> 00:51:58,84
既然着了魔 那你就该知道我不会改变心意
If you understand an obsession, then you know you won't change my mind.

737
00:52:00,18 --> 00:52:01,17
就这样吧
So be it.

738
00:52:02,78 --> 00:52:04,01
你愿意打造了吗？
Will you build it?

739
00:52:05,05 --> 00:52:08,54
我已经开始打造了
I've already begun to build it, Mr. Angier.

740
00:52:08,72 --> 00:52:11,08
希望你享受山上的空气
I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take some time.

741
00:52:11,25 --> 00:52:13,59
这得花点时间

742
00:52:15,99 --> 00:52:17,05
(魔术大师挑战死亡)

743
00:52:17,23 --> 00:52:19,22
(重返江湖的移形遁影术)

744
00:52:36,48 --> 00:52:39,18
Uh... I thought you'd gone.

745
00:52:38,05 --> 00:52:39,48
我以为你走了

746
00:52:40,45 --> 00:52:42,61
我没有地方可以去
I don't really have anywhere to go.

747
00:52:45,49 --> 00:52:46,75
你都睡在这里？
You've been sleeping here?

748
00:52:46,92 --> 00:52:51,33
柯特说我可以睡在这里 你在做什么？
Cutter said it'd be all right till we get another booking. What are you doing?

749
00:52:52,36 --> 00:52:53,73
做研究
Uh... research.

750
00:52:53,90 --> 00:52:58,33
魔术师得刺探对手表演什么…
Part of a magician's job

751
00:52:55,33 --> 00:52:58,20
is to... watch his competition, see what illusions...

752
00:52:58,50 --> 00:53:01,27
你打算对付他，对吧？
You're going to do something to that man, aren't you?

753
00:53:01,44 --> 00:53:03,24
柯特希望你忘了这件事
Cutter's hoping you let things lie.

754
00:53:03,41 --> 00:53:05,84
如果波登觉得你们扯平了…
He says if Borden thinks things are even between you...

755
00:53:06,01 --> 00:53:07,60
扯平？
Even?

756
00:53:08,18 --> 00:53:10,70
他用手指换我太太的命？
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

757
00:53:10,88 --> 00:53:13,78
他现在有家有室又能上台表演
He has a family now and he's performing again.

758
00:53:13,95 --> 00:53:17,68
波登假装没事发生 继续过着日子
Borden is out there living his life just as he intended,

759
00:53:17,85 --> 00:53:19,91
看看我
as if nothing had happened and look at me.

760
00:53:20,09 --> 00:53:22,96
-我孤家寡人，没戏院要请我表演 -是我们
I'm alone and no theater will touch me.

761
00:53:22,09 --> 00:53:23,69
Us.

762
00:53:23,93 --> 00:53:26,59
你需要更好的伪装
You're going to need a better disguise.

763
00:53:43,71 --> 00:53:44,74
我需要志愿者
I need a volunteer.

764
00:53:46,18 --> 00:53:47,48
发生什么事？
What happened?

765
00:53:48,59 --> 00:53:50,64
你伤了他吗？
Did you hurt him?

766
00:53:52,32 --> 00:53:53,55
怎么了，劳勃？
What happened, Robert?

767
00:53:55,99 --> 00:53:57,39
你
You, sir. Just a rubber ball, yes?

768
00:53:58,09 --> 00:54:00,93
这只是个皮球，对吧？谢谢

769
00:54:01,10 --> 00:54:03,59
只是个皮球
Thank you.

770
00:54:01,03 --> 00:54:03,63
Just a rubber ball? No.

771
00:54:03,77 --> 00:54:06,96
但它一点也不普通
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

772
00:54:07,14 --> 00:54:08,16
它有魔力
It's magic.

773
00:54:09,01 --> 00:54:10,94
波登有个新魔术
He had a new trick.

774
00:54:24,85 --> 00:54:25,84
很棒吗？
Was it good?

775
00:54:30,89 --> 00:54:32,79
那是我看过最棒的魔术戏法
It was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen.

776
00:54:39,47 --> 00:54:40,99
观众有没有鼓掌？
Did they applaud when you saw it?

777
00:54:41,17 --> 00:54:43,20
戏法太棒、太简单了
It was too good. It was too simple. The audience hardly had time to see it.

778
00:54:43,37 --> 00:54:46,43
-观众根本来不及看得懂 -他是个糟糕的魔术师

779
00:54:44,94 --> 00:54:47,81
- He's a dreadful magician. - A wonderful magician.

780
00:54:46,61 --> 00:54:49,14
不，他是很厉害的魔术师 只是一个糟糕的表演者
He's a dreadful showman. He doesn't dress it up,

781
00:54:49,31 --> 00:54:51,54
完全不懂得包装宣传他的魔术
- how to sell it. - How does he do it?

782
00:54:51,72 --> 00:54:53,34
-那他到底怎么变的？ -他使用替身
- He uses a double. - No, it's too simple.

783
00:54:53,52 --> 00:54:56,11
太简单了，一定更复杂
This is a complex illusion.

784
00:54:56,29 --> 00:54:58,69
你不知道窍门才会这么说
You say that because you don't know the method.

785
00:54:58,86 --> 00:55:01,02
后来现身的是替身，就是这样
It's a double that comes out. It's the only way.

786
00:55:01,19 --> 00:55:03,35
我看过三次
I've seen him perform it three times. The prestige is the same man.

787
00:55:03,53 --> 00:55:05,99
-是同一个人 -不，不是
- No, it's not. - The same man comes out of the cabinet.

788
00:55:06,16 --> 00:55:08,63
从第二道门出来的是同一人

789
00:55:08,80 --> 00:55:09,89
是同一个人
It's the same man.

790
00:55:11,13 --> 00:55:13,53
他戴着手套掩饰断指
He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers,

791
00:55:13,70 --> 00:55:15,53
仔细看就看得出来
but, if you look closely, you can tell.

792
00:55:18,34 --> 00:55:20,97
他不会吸引观众，但是我会
He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience, but I do.

793
00:55:21,14 --> 00:55:23,48
我们可以用来当压轴表演
Yeah, we could use it as a climax to the show.

794
00:55:23,91 --> 00:55:25,78
没错
Yes.

795
00:55:25,95 --> 00:55:29,18
他毁了我一生，我就偷他的戏法
The man stole my life, I'm gonna steal his trick.

796
00:55:29,35 --> 00:55:32,55
-我们要找个很像你的人 -他没有用替身
We got to find someone who looks like you.

797
00:55:32,72 --> 00:55:36,06
劳勃，我不知道波登的手法
- He doesn't use a double. - I don't know how Borden does it.

798
00:55:36,23 --> 00:55:39,59
你要不就等他退休向他买秘诀
Either... You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret,

799
00:55:39,76 --> 00:55:41,53
或是听我解释要怎么表演
or you listen to how I would do it.

800
00:55:41,70 --> 00:55:46,60
我知道唯一的手段就是用替身
And the only way that I know how to do it

801
00:55:44,04 --> 00:55:46,50
is to find you a bloody good double.

802
00:55:47,54 --> 00:55:49,16
好吧
All right.

803
00:55:50,44 --> 00:55:52,93
看清楚我的样子，去找我吧
Take a good look. Let's get out there and find me.

804
00:55:52,91 --> 00:55:55,04
Whoo!

805
00:55:55,15 --> 00:55:57,08
你看，你看
Look, look.

806
00:56:01,18 --> 00:56:02,78
这是什么？
What's that?

807
00:56:03,95 --> 00:56:07,05
这是给你的

808
00:56:07,22 --> 00:56:08,99
用来做什么呢？
- It's for you. - What's this for?

809
00:56:09,16 --> 00:56:10,79
过来
Come.

810
00:56:13,93 --> 00:56:15,70
You...

811
00:56:15,97 --> 00:56:19,70
-我上礼拜问过你… -那时候我心情不好
- I asked you last week... - You caught me in a wrong mood.

812
00:56:19,94 --> 00:56:21,27
但是你一直反对…
- But you won't ever... - Sarah,

813
00:56:21,44 --> 00:56:24,97
莎拉，我可以改变主意吧？
I'm gonna have to change my mind, aren't I?

814
00:56:25,48 --> 00:56:28,88
我的表演很成功 换一家大剧院表演
The act is taking off. Soon we'll be in a bigger theater, things will work out.

815
00:56:29,05 --> 00:56:30,27
就能赚大钱

816
00:56:32,72 --> 00:56:34,41
我不敢相信，谢谢你
I can't believe it. Thank you. Thank you. It's beautiful.

817
00:56:34,58 --> 00:56:36,48
谢谢你，好美喔

818
00:56:43,19 --> 00:56:44,96
杰瑞
- Gerry? - Darling, look at you.

819
00:56:45,40 --> 00:56:46,49
亲爱的，看看你
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier, I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

820
00:56:46,66 --> 00:56:49,29
两位，这是杰瑞路特

821
00:56:49,27 --> 00:56:51,43
Mm-hm.

822
00:56:54,47 --> 00:56:57,84
幸会了，很荣幸认识你们
A pleasure. Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

823
00:56:58,41 --> 00:57:00,97
你想听我说笑话吗？过来
Would you like for me to tell you a little joke? Come here.

824
00:57:04,15 --> 00:57:06,12
怎样？
Yes. Are you laughing now?

825
00:57:06,28 --> 00:57:08,31
你在笑吗？

826
00:57:10,52 --> 00:57:13,32
我得去尿尿
I have to take a piss.

827
00:57:15,02 --> 00:57:17,82
-他是个疯汉 -当然了，他是个失业演员
- He's out of his mind. - Of course, he's an out-of-work actor.

828
00:57:17,99 --> 00:57:19,79
他很好，外表修饰一下
He's perfect. He needs a little help.

829
00:57:19,96 --> 00:57:22,80
就能当你的兄弟
But when I get done with him, he could be your brother.

830
00:57:22,97 --> 00:57:25,49
我不要他当我兄弟，而是变成我
I don't need him to be my brother, I need him to be me.

831
00:57:25,67 --> 00:57:27,23
给我一个月的时间
Give me a month.

832
00:57:31,17 --> 00:57:32,97
过来

833
00:57:34,14 --> 00:57:38,51
你打开门，然后…
So you open the door...

834
00:57:36,65 --> 00:57:38,12
...and...

835
00:57:45,76 --> 00:57:47,31
跳下来吧
Come on.

836
00:57:51,23 --> 00:57:54,96
-你就不能找个软垫子吗？ -这又不是睡觉用的
Couldn't you have found a softer one?

837
00:57:52,97 --> 00:57:55,30
Well, it's not for sleeping on.

838
00:57:55,57 --> 00:57:57,50
你从那上面跳下来
So, if you come down through there...

839
00:58:00,24 --> 00:58:03,23
-路特就从那边上去吗？ -没错
- ...does Root go up through there? - Yep.

840
00:58:03,64 --> 00:58:05,37
这会令人叹为观止
It's going to be amazing.

841
00:58:05,91 --> 00:58:09,68
一定要，波登的魔术大受欢迎
Well, it has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed.

842
00:58:11,75 --> 00:58:14,11
今天已经客满了
The place was packed today.

843
00:58:15,79 --> 00:58:17,51
你又去看他的表演
You went and saw his show again.

844
00:58:17,69 --> 00:58:20,05
准备见你自己吗？安先生
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

845
00:58:28,70 --> 00:58:30,72
我只要喝得烂醉
All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk,

846
00:58:30,90 --> 00:58:33,16
就不会被识破
and no one will be able to tell the difference.

847
00:58:33,34 --> 00:58:35,24
你要有点信心
Have a little faith, sir.

848
00:58:35,41 --> 00:58:40,27
路先生，麻烦你表演吧
Now, would you favor us with a performance, Mr. Root?

849
00:58:44,18 --> 00:58:45,84
老天爷

850
00:59:01,00 --> 00:59:04,19
你若像我看尽人情冷暖 也会借酒浇愁
You'd drink, too, if you knew the world half as well as I do.

851
00:59:08,04 --> 00:59:09,60
你以为你很特别吗？
Did you think you were unique?

852
00:59:09,77 --> 00:59:12,26
我扮演过凯撒跟浮士德
I've been Caesar, I've played Faust.

853
00:59:12,44 --> 00:59:15,41
扮你这丹顿大师能有多难？
How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton?

854
00:59:15,58 --> 00:59:18,74
你可以变回自己了，不然开除你
You can go back to being yourself now, Root, for nothing.

855
00:59:18,92 --> 00:59:21,08
我宁愿变成他
I'd rather be him for now.

856
00:59:21,25 --> 00:59:24,05
我发现这还蛮好玩的
I find it, uh... amusing.

857
00:59:27,46 --> 00:59:31,52
吾王，我确实否认没有囚犯…
"My liege,

858
00:59:29,06 --> 00:59:32,39
I did deny no prisoners."

859
00:59:32,66 --> 00:59:34,56
-你扮得好像哦 -谢了
- You look wonderful. - Oh, thank you.

860
00:59:34,73 --> 00:59:37,83
路特必须保持低调 被人看到我们就玩完了
Root has to keep a low profile. Anyone sees him, the game's up.

861
00:59:38,00 --> 00:59:40,94
我不知道你的做法，我也不想知道
I don't know how you do things. I'm not sure I wanna know.

862
00:59:41,34 --> 00:59:43,50
你决定这魔术叫什么吗？
Have you thought what we should call it?

863
00:59:43,67 --> 00:59:44,87
没必要遮遮掩掩 波登称他的表演为“移形遁影术”
There's no point being coy. Borden calls his trick The Transported Man.

864
00:59:44,87 --> 00:59:47,24
没必要遮遮掩掩 波登称他的表演为“移形遁影术”

865
00:59:48,24 --> 00:59:50,94
(全新移形遁影术)

866
00:59:51,81 --> 00:59:54,15
各位，你们今晚看到的
Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen may be termed

867
00:59:54,32 --> 00:59:59,55
多半都是魔术或是小把戏
as illusions or entertaining trifles.

868
01:00:03,16 --> 01:00:04,29
但是…
Alas...

869
01:00:06,46 --> 01:00:08,93
下一个表演并不是魔术
...I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

870
01:00:09,83 --> 01:00:10,99
仔细看
Watch carefully.

871
01:00:12,47 --> 01:00:14,94
绝对看不到机关
You will see no trickery,

872
01:00:15,41 --> 01:00:16,96
因为这是真的
for no trickery is employed.

873
01:00:18,14 --> 01:00:21,47
只有遥远东方的奇人异士
Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the Orient

874
01:00:21,64 --> 01:00:23,84
以及喜马拉雅山的圣者才会
and various holy men of the Himalayas.

875
01:00:27,28 --> 01:00:30,01
的确，有些观众看过这个表演
Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique,

876
01:00:30,19 --> 01:00:33,21
没看过的请不要紧张
but for those of you who are not, do not be alarmed.

877
01:00:33,39 --> 01:00:36,45
这个表演绝对安全
What you're about to see is considered safe.

878
01:01:08,46 --> 01:01:10,52
敬我们的成功
To our achievement.

879
01:01:11,23 --> 01:01:13,86
经理说他没看过这种热烈反应
The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.

880
01:01:14,03 --> 01:01:17,26
至少他看到了，我只能躲在台下
At least he saw it. I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

881
01:01:17,43 --> 01:01:19,80
观众才懒得管消失的人
No one cares about the man who disappears.

882
01:01:19,97 --> 01:01:21,73
他们只在乎现身的大师
They care about the one who comes out.

883
01:01:21,90 --> 01:01:24,87
-我就关心消失的人 -谢谢你
I care about the man in the box.

884
01:01:25,04 --> 01:01:28,24
也许我们能换过来
Thank you. I don't know, maybe we could switch before the trick.

885
01:01:28,41 --> 01:01:30,50
由我来现身 让路特跳到舞台底下
I'm the prestige, and Root's below stage.

886
01:01:30,68 --> 01:01:33,41
不行，观众的期望最重要
No, the anticipation of the trick is everything.

887
01:01:33,58 --> 01:01:36,61
你的舞台魅力才能营造张力
We need your showmanship to build up the suspense.

888
01:01:36,79 --> 01:01:40,05
他一开口就完了，没办法表演
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over. He can't introduce this trick.

889
01:01:40,22 --> 01:01:43,06
我当然行，我是丹顿大师
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

890
01:01:43,23 --> 01:01:46,72
你这猪头，把这身装扮脱掉
Root, you bloody fool, get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

891
01:01:46,90 --> 01:01:49,42
随时都可能有人经过
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

892
01:01:49,60 --> 01:01:51,59
恭喜了，各位
Congratulations, all.

893
01:01:51,77 --> 01:01:55,33
成功不是偶然的，我们很努力
Life is not full of these moments. We worked hard.

894
01:01:55,51 --> 01:01:57,10
我们要好好庆祝
We need to celebrate properly.

895
01:02:00,78 --> 01:02:03,30
怎么了？想起你太太？
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

896
01:02:03,48 --> 01:02:05,71
不是，这魔术还不够好
No, it's the trick. It isn't good enough.

897
01:02:05,88 --> 01:02:09,08
波登比不上我们，他没有格调
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He has no style.

898
01:02:09,25 --> 01:02:13,09
他最后不必躲在舞台底下
He doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage.

899
01:02:13,26 --> 01:02:14,95
我要知道他的做法
- I need to know how he does it. - Why?

900
01:02:15,12 --> 01:02:18,49
-为什么？ -这样我就可以做得更好
So I can do it better.

901
01:02:20,70 --> 01:02:23,10
我要你去当他的助手
I need you to go and work for him.

902
01:02:26,24 --> 01:02:27,90
当他助手？你在开玩笑？
Work for him? Are you joking?

903
01:02:29,21 --> 01:02:30,33
你得当我的间谍
You'll be my spy.

904
01:02:30,51 --> 01:02:32,57
我们才刚成功，你就要我走？
We just got our start. You want me to leave?

905
01:02:32,74 --> 01:02:34,77
这样才能进步，想想看
That's how we advance. Think of it.

906
01:02:34,94 --> 01:02:38,57
柯特的技俩已经让观众兴奋了 用正版魔术岂不更受欢迎
People are excited by Cutter's version. Imagine what we'd do

907
01:02:38,75 --> 01:02:42,58
这将是前所未见的伟大魔术
with the real illusion. We'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

908
01:02:42,75 --> 01:02:44,15
他知道我是你的助手
- He knows I work for you. - Exactly why he'll want to hire you.

909
01:02:44,32 --> 01:02:47,59
他才会用你来打探我的秘诀

910
01:02:47,76 --> 01:02:51,82
-他凭什么信任我？ -因为你要告诉他真相
- He'll want my secret. - Why would he trust me?

911
01:02:49,11 --> 01:02:51,81
Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

912
01:02:54,72 --> 01:02:56,55
Hmm?

913
01:03:04,21 --> 01:03:05,20
乖女孩
Good girl.

914
01:03:09,28 --> 01:03:11,94
你一定想知道 花大钱买到的是什么
You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you.

915
01:03:12,58 --> 01:03:15,45
你正好来目睹我们的处女秀
Fitting you should be here for her maiden voyage.

916
01:03:15,62 --> 01:03:17,31
你的高帽
Your hat.

917
01:03:25,03 --> 01:03:27,69
你最好退后一点
You might want to stand back.

918
01:03:48,52 --> 01:03:49,51
我不明白
I don't understand.

919
01:03:49,69 --> 01:03:51,98
让我们来处理就好了
Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it.

920
01:03:52,16 --> 01:03:54,28
-有问题吗，泰斯拉？ -没有
Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?

921
01:03:54,46 --> 01:03:55,98
-下星期再回来 -下星期？
- No. Come back next week. - Next week?

922
01:03:56,16 --> 01:03:58,25
下星期就没问题
- Next week, it will be fine. - Tesla!

923
01:03:58,43 --> 01:04:01,19
机器有时候也会闹脾气
Just a little temperamental.

924
01:04:06,10 --> 01:04:08,90
-很不错的工作室 -我们尽力了
- Interesting workshop. - Yeah, we make do.

925
01:04:09,07 --> 01:04:11,40
-我是奥莉薇雅 -我知道
- My name is Olivia... - I know who you are.

926
01:04:11,57 --> 01:04:12,87
你来偷我的秘诀？
Here to steal the rest of my show?

927
01:04:13,04 --> 01:04:14,84
我有你缺少的东西
To give your show what it's missing.

928
01:04:15,01 --> 01:04:18,17
-我缺少什么？ -我
- Yeah, what might that be? - Me.

929
01:04:18,23 --> 01:04:22,69
I was just saying that, wasn't I?

930
01:04:19,75 --> 01:04:23,69
我刚才正在说… 我们需要女性魅力

931
01:04:23,85 --> 01:04:25,68
我离开安杰
- A woman's touch. - I've left Angier.

932
01:04:25,86 --> 01:04:28,59
需要工作
- All right. - I want a job.

933
01:04:28,76 --> 01:04:31,73
-我知道你一定不信任我 -我为什么不信任你？
Yeah.

934
01:04:28,68 --> 01:04:30,51
I know you've no reason to trust me.

935
01:04:31,89 --> 01:04:35,76
你是我敌手的情人，当然能信任
Why wouldn't I trust you?

936
01:04:32,21 --> 01:04:35,65
You're only the mistress of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

937
01:04:37,33 --> 01:04:39,23
-波登先生 -艾佛
- Mr. Borden. - Alfred.

938
01:04:41,67 --> 01:04:43,73
我要告诉你事实
I'm going to tell you the truth.

939
01:04:43,91 --> 01:04:46,57
干我们这行，没有所谓的事实
Now that is a slippery notion

940
01:04:46,74 --> 01:04:48,04
不是吗？温小姐
in our line of work, isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

941
01:04:50,18 --> 01:04:52,74
我会来这里 是安杰派我来的
I am here because he sent me here.

942
01:04:52,92 --> 01:04:55,38
他要我替你工作，偷你的秘诀
He wants me to work for you and steal your secret.

943
01:04:55,55 --> 01:04:57,21
为什么？
What does he need my secret for? His trick is topnotch.

944
01:04:57,39 --> 01:04:58,79
他的魔术算顶尖了
He vanishes, and then he reappears instantly

945
01:04:59,39 --> 01:05:02,62
他消失后立刻出现在舞台另一边

946
01:05:02,79 --> 01:05:06,63
痴肥又不开口，而且喝得烂醉
on the other side of the stage, mute, overweight

947
01:05:04,11 --> 01:05:06,67
and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

948
01:05:06,80 --> 01:05:08,46
不过还是很棒，何必偷我的？
It's astonishing. How does he do it? And tell me, Olivia,

949
01:05:08,90 --> 01:05:13,77
告诉我，他喜欢躲在台下吗？
does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

950
01:05:13,94 --> 01:05:14,96
他快抓狂了
It's killing him. He's obsessed with discovering your methods.

951
01:05:15,14 --> 01:05:17,13
他像着了魔似的

952
01:05:17,31 --> 01:05:18,50
只想知道你的手法
He thinks of nothing else, takes no pleasure in our success.

953
01:05:18,67 --> 01:05:21,73
表演成功还不满足，我受够了

954
01:05:20,36 --> 01:05:21,85
And I've had enough.

955
01:05:21,91 --> 01:05:23,34
跟他在一起没有未来
There is no future with him.

956
01:05:25,55 --> 01:05:29,18
他派我来偷你的秘诀 我来告诉你他的秘密
He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've come to offer you his.

957
01:05:29,69 --> 01:05:33,25
这是实话吗？
This is the truth... is it?

958
01:05:37,76 --> 01:05:39,46
你赶快把衣服穿好
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

959
01:05:40,76 --> 01:05:41,86
你迟到了，而且比平常更醉
Root, you're late and more drunk than usual. Get down below stairs right away.

960
01:05:42,03 --> 01:05:44,66
-立刻给我躲进舞台下面 -不

961
01:05:44,19 --> 01:05:45,91
No.

962
01:05:46,24 --> 01:05:49,33
我们得聊一聊，柯特先生
No, we need to have a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

963
01:05:49,51 --> 01:05:50,53
麻烦大了
We have a problem. Cutter, Borden is performing right across the street.

964
01:05:50,71 --> 01:05:53,27
波登就在对街表演

965
01:05:53,44 --> 01:05:56,07
这里的问题更大
Yeah, we have a bigger problem.

966
01:05:57,21 --> 01:06:00,15
路特他发现他可以狮子大开口
Root. He's realized that he can make demands.

967
01:06:01,02 --> 01:06:02,31
他要勒索我们？
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

968
01:06:02,49 --> 01:06:06,65
我倒是很惊讶 这种人通常过很久才会想通
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.

969
01:06:04,44 --> 01:06:07,03
It usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out.

970
01:06:06,82 --> 01:06:09,62
-他要多少？ -没差啦
- How much does he want? - It makes no difference.

971
01:06:09,79 --> 01:06:13,19
-我们得暂停演出 -暂停演出？你看看
- We've got to stop doing the trick. - Stop the trick? Look at this.

972
01:06:13,36 --> 01:06:15,49
你看看上礼拜的报纸
Last week they said you were the premier stage performer in London.

973
01:06:15,67 --> 01:06:19,03
他们说你是伦敦首席表演家

974
01:06:19,20 --> 01:06:20,76
不是魔术师
Not magician, mind you. Performer of any kind.

975
01:06:20,94 --> 01:06:23,53
-而是表演家 -你想说什么？

976
01:06:23,71 --> 01:06:25,97
你成名太快
- What's your point? - My point is, you've climbed too high

977
01:06:26,14 --> 01:06:28,34
不能出纰漏
to get away with professional embarrassment.

978
01:06:28,95 --> 01:06:31,74
最好别表演无法掌控的魔术
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

979
01:06:34,15 --> 01:06:35,74
他想要多少都给他
Just pay him for now. We keep doing the trick until Borden opens,

980
01:06:35,92 --> 01:06:39,32
继续表演 直到波登开幕，我们再喊停
and then we'll phase it out.

981
01:06:40,42 --> 01:06:41,86
好吧
All right.

982
01:06:45,09 --> 01:06:48,55
柯特很惊讶路特这么快就造反
<i>Cutter was always surprised</i>

983
01:06:46,68 --> 01:06:48,58
<i>how fast Root turned bad.</i>

984
01:06:49,13 --> 01:06:53,12
我何德何能被你请喝啤酒？
To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?

985
01:06:53,30 --> 01:06:56,67
你是丹顿大师，对吧？
- You're the Great Danton, aren't you? - Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

986
01:06:56,84 --> 01:07:00,17
当然，别声张，我怕被骚扰
Of course I am, but don't advertise it, because I'll be mobbed with fans.

987
01:07:00,34 --> 01:07:02,24
我们给他钱喝酒
<i>We paid him enough to keep him in beers.</i>

988
01:07:02,41 --> 01:07:04,54
以防他扯后腿
<i>You wouldn't expect him to rock the boat.</i>

989
01:07:04,71 --> 01:07:07,27
各位可能看过这个魔术
Many of you may be familiar with this technique,

990
01:07:07,45 --> 01:07:11,08
没看过的人不要紧张
but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed.

991
01:07:11,25 --> 01:07:14,28
这个魔术很安全
What you're about to see is considered safe.

992
01:07:14,46 --> 01:07:15,75
你是谁？
- And who are you? - I am a humble admirer

993
01:07:15,93 --> 01:07:21,76
我是个仰慕者，也是魔术师

994
01:07:18,08 --> 01:07:20,67
and a fellow practitioner.

995
01:07:21,93 --> 01:07:23,09
非常好
Mmm. Very good.

996
01:07:32,58 --> 01:07:35,27
-再来一杯？ -如果你要请客
- Another one? - Oh, if you insist.

997
01:07:35,44 --> 01:07:37,34
-再来一杯 -我今晚没有演出
- Another. - I'm not performing tonight.

998
01:07:37,51 --> 01:07:39,24
我只负责表演
I'm only doing one show, but to be frank,

999
01:07:39,42 --> 01:07:42,61
一切都由其他人安排
my people pretty much run things these days.

1000
01:07:42,79 --> 01:07:43,88
给我上去
Get up there.

1001
01:07:45,35 --> 01:07:46,34
上去
Get up!

1002
01:07:46,52 --> 01:07:48,68
你的移形遁影术
Your illusion, The Transported Man,

1003
01:07:48,86 --> 01:07:51,83
我并不知道个中秘密
I'm not claiming to know your methods,

1004
01:07:52,53 --> 01:07:58,99
但是我以前也有类似的表演 而且，我用一个替身
but I had a similar trick in my act,

1005
01:07:56,18 --> 01:07:59,02
and, uh... I used a double.

1006
01:08:00,40 --> 01:08:01,50
我懂了，很好
- Mm, I see, very good. - Well, it was, and then it went bad.

1007
01:08:01,67 --> 01:08:04,23
结果出了麻烦

1008
01:08:04,41 --> 01:08:09,81
我没料到替身竟然喧宝夺主
What I didn't count on was that when I incorporated this bloke

1009
01:08:07,83 --> 01:08:09,92
into my act,

1010
01:08:09,98 --> 01:08:11,95
把我的光彩全部夺走
he had complete power over me.

1011
01:08:13,28 --> 01:08:14,75
完全夺走？
Complete power, you say?

1012
01:08:30,75 --> 01:08:32,18
Ohh!

1013
01:08:32,33 --> 01:08:37,50
千万别让别人夺走你的光彩
Be very careful giving someone that power over you.

1014
01:08:37,59 --> 01:08:41,93
Huh. Thank you. Um...

1015
01:08:39,98 --> 01:08:41,94
谢谢你

1016
01:08:42,11 --> 01:08:44,27
谢谢你的忠告
Yes, thank you for the warning.

1017
01:08:44,93 --> 01:08:47,63
Hmm. Cheers.

1018
01:08:46,45 --> 01:08:48,44
干杯

1019
01:08:49,19 --> 01:08:51,18
下一个表演并不是魔术
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

1020
01:08:51,27 --> 01:08:54,64
What you're about to see is considered safe.

1021
01:08:52,86 --> 01:08:55,55
不过这个表演很安全

1022
01:08:58,95 --> 01:09:00,64
Ahh!

1023
01:09:32,88 --> 01:09:37,84
Oh! The Great Danton.

1024
01:09:35,56 --> 01:09:37,76
伟大的丹顿大师

1025
01:09:39,30 --> 01:09:41,46
(大师在潘提剧场表演)

1026
01:09:44,14 --> 01:09:45,80
我在此致歉
I apologize.

1027
01:09:45,98 --> 01:09:49,71
我在对街的表演太精彩
There simply is too much magic...

1028
01:09:49,88 --> 01:09:54,87
不小心把自己变到这里来
...for my stage at The Pantages

1029
01:09:52,67 --> 01:09:54,83
across the street.

1030
01:09:56,85 --> 01:09:58,79
太棒了！

1031
01:09:58,95 --> 01:10:02,36
抱歉打扰了
Pardon my intrusion.

1032
01:10:03,03 --> 01:10:05,86
-太棒了 -放过他吧
And go easy on the poor chap. He does try so very hard.

1033
01:10:06,03 --> 01:10:09,12
他已经很努力了

1034
01:10:11,73 --> 01:10:13,57
我不知道波登怎么找到他的
I don't know how Borden found him.

1035
01:10:13,74 --> 01:10:15,53
我很小心把他藏好
Kept him under wraps. I was careful.

1036
01:10:15,70 --> 01:10:17,64
还是被他找到了
Yeah, well, he did.

1037
01:10:18,47 --> 01:10:19,57
是她泄的密吗？
Do you think it was her?

1038
01:10:27,02 --> 01:10:29,64
你没料到是我吧？
You weren't expecting me?

1039
01:10:29,82 --> 01:10:32,48
你来晚了，你明明约下午
I expected you sooner. Your message said afternoon.

1040
01:10:32,66 --> 01:10:34,75
最近我的行动不便
It takes a bit for me to get around these days.

1041
01:10:35,26 --> 01:10:36,75
他从我身边夺走一切
He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career,

1042
01:10:36,93 --> 01:10:39,79
妻子、事业、还有你

1043
01:10:39,96 --> 01:10:40,95
是你派我来的
- now you. - You sent me.

1044
01:10:41,13 --> 01:10:44,00
我派你 是要你偷他的秘诀，不是帮助他
I sent you to steal his secret, not to improve his act.

1045
01:10:44,17 --> 01:10:45,63
-那是我的工作 -或是爱上他
- It's my job. - Or fall in love!

1046
01:10:45,80 --> 01:10:48,36
-我照你的话去做 -是吗？
- I did everything you asked! - Yes? Yes?

1047
01:10:48,54 --> 01:10:51,06
-他到底用什么手法？ -柯特说的对，他用替身
- How does he do it? - Cutter was right, a double.

1048
01:10:51,24 --> 01:10:54,51
-波登当然这么说 -他什么都没说
- 'Course he said that. - He didn't say it.

1049
01:10:54,68 --> 01:10:58,44
我看到化妆、眼镜、假发 我们没用到，不过都藏在后台
I've seen things, makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use for the show.

1050
01:10:56,93 --> 01:10:59,66
- I've seen it hidden backstage. - Misdirection.

1051
01:10:58,61 --> 01:11:02,41
他故意让你误以为他用替身
He leaves them lying around to make you think that.

1052
01:11:02,59 --> 01:11:04,35
随时随地吗？不可能
He doesn't know when I'm looking.

1053
01:11:04,52 --> 01:11:06,49
随时随地，他就是这种人
All the time, Olivia! That's who he is!

1054
01:11:06,66 --> 01:11:08,95
你不懂吗？
That's what it takes!

1055
01:11:09,12 --> 01:11:11,49
他一直在演戏
He lives his act, don't you see?

1056
01:11:13,63 --> 01:11:16,83
他跟你上床不代表他信任你
Just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.

1057
01:11:17,00 --> 01:11:19,33
你以为你什么都知道？
You think you can see everything, don't you?

1058
01:11:19,50 --> 01:11:23,13
丹顿大师是睁眼瞎子 这是他的笔记
The Great Danton is a blind fool.

1059
01:11:22,36 --> 01:11:23,76
His notebook.

1060
01:11:25,21 --> 01:11:27,33
你偷的？
You stole it?

1061
01:11:27,51 --> 01:11:29,27
借来的 只有今晚
I borrowed it for tonight.

1062
01:11:29,45 --> 01:11:31,47
我想你可以翻译…
I thought you could translate some of it...

1063
01:11:31,65 --> 01:11:32,64
-不行 -你不行？
I can't. No one can. It's a cipher.

1064
01:11:32,82 --> 01:11:35,65
没人能翻译，这是字谜

1065
01:11:35,82 --> 01:11:39,08
就算有关键字，也得花几个月
Even with the keyword, it will take months to decode.

1066
01:11:39,26 --> 01:11:42,19
-没有关键字呢？ -那就没辙了
- And without the keyword? - Perhaps never.

1067
01:11:42,36 --> 01:11:43,76
-等着瞧吧 -不能等了
- We'll see. - We will not see.

1068
01:11:43,93 --> 01:11:46,86
我明早不放回去 他就知道是我偷的
If I don't get that back by tomorrow he'll know I took it.

1069
01:11:47,03 --> 01:11:49,19
-离开他 -不行，他知道我住哪里
- Leave him. - I can't. He knows where I live.

1070
01:11:50,60 --> 01:11:52,53
这是他的日记
This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here in my hands.

1071
01:11:52,70 --> 01:11:55,33
他的秘密都掌握在我手里

1072
01:11:56,34 --> 01:11:57,57
这不能让你妻子复生
It won't bring your wife back.

1073
01:11:57,74 --> 01:12:00,90
我才不在乎，我只要他的秘密
I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret.

1074
01:12:13,72 --> 01:12:15,52
听着
Look, I'll, um...

1075
01:12:16,69 --> 01:12:18,72
我去他的工作室布置成闯空门
I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in.

1076
01:12:18,89 --> 01:12:23,06
-他会知道是你拿走的 -对，是我，不是你
- He'll know you took it. - Yes, me. Not you.

1077
01:12:23,23 --> 01:12:25,00
懂吗？
Understand?

1078
01:12:33,54 --> 01:12:34,53
劳勃？
Robert.

1079
01:12:37,11 --> 01:12:39,77
我已经爱上他了
I have fallen in love with him.

1080
01:12:40,78 --> 01:12:43,48
那我就知道你有多为难了
Then I know how hard this has been for you.

1081
01:12:51,86 --> 01:12:53,95
他偷了笔记？
Notebook?

1082
01:12:56,00 --> 01:12:57,86
他不会就此罢手
Then he's just getting started.

1083
01:12:58,13 --> 01:13:01,47
(潘提剧场)

1084
01:13:28,33 --> 01:13:29,89
晚安
Professor!

1085
01:13:30,07 --> 01:13:32,23
-能说句话吗？ -大师
Good evening.

1086
01:13:33,30 --> 01:13:36,60
我今晚走路回家

1087
01:13:34,99 --> 01:13:36,62
I'm walking tonight.

1088
01:13:36,77 --> 01:13:38,67
让他来吧，我不在乎
Let him come. I don't care.

1089
01:13:38,84 --> 01:13:41,24
-大师 -大师
Professor! Professor!

1090
01:15:04,41 --> 01:15:05,84
Ahh!

1091
01:15:05,99 --> 01:15:08,46
-你没事吧？ -死不了
- You all right? - I'm alive.

1092
01:15:08,63 --> 01:15:10,72
这样就省得我开个通风孔
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

1093
01:15:24,78 --> 01:15:27,27
-我很佩服你 -为什么？
- I'm impressed. - Why is that?

1094
01:15:27,45 --> 01:15:29,94
你终于动手杀生了
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

1095
01:15:30,59 --> 01:15:33,28
这就是伟大魔术的代价
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

1096
01:15:33,46 --> 01:15:34,79
冒险
Risk, sacrifice.

1097
01:15:34,96 --> 01:15:36,19
牺牲
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all gonna be yours,

1098
01:15:36,73 --> 01:15:40,39
不给我我要的，只有你会被牺牲

1099
01:15:38,81 --> 01:15:40,44
unless you give me what I want.

1100
01:15:41,70 --> 01:15:43,93
-你要什么？ -你的秘密
- Which is? - Your secret.

1101
01:15:44,47 --> 01:15:46,33
我的秘密？
My secret?

1102
01:15:46,50 --> 01:15:48,77
移形遁影术的手法
Your method for The Transported Man.

1103
01:15:48,94 --> 01:15:51,53
法隆不肯说，他根本不会说话
Fallon wouldn't tell me. He doesn't talk at all.

1104
01:15:51,71 --> 01:15:52,97
你拿到我的笔记
- You have my notebook. - Useless without the keyword.

1105
01:15:53,14 --> 01:15:55,08
少了关键字也没用

1106
01:15:56,58 --> 01:15:58,21
写出你的手法
Write down your method, Mr. Borden, describe it in full.

1107
01:15:58,38 --> 01:16:00,25
详细写出来

1108
01:16:13,33 --> 01:16:15,92
我要你的手法，不只是关键字
I want the whole method, not the keyword.

1109
01:16:16,10 --> 01:16:18,50
你的笔记也许根本没记载
I don't know if your secret's in your notebook.

1110
01:16:18,67 --> 01:16:20,93
关键字就是我的手法
The keyword is the method.

1111
01:16:24,74 --> 01:16:25,90
我的机关师呢？
<i>Where's my ingnieur?</i>

1112
01:16:33,22 --> 01:16:35,65
-他还活着吗？ -看你能挖多快
- Alive? - How fast can you dig?

1113
01:16:38,22 --> 01:16:41,19
法隆，听得见吗？ 法隆！
Fallon, you hear me? Fallon!

1114
01:16:42,72 --> 01:16:45,16
-你的手臂怎样？ -幸好还在
- How's the arm? - Still attached.

1115
01:16:46,70 --> 01:16:49,03
-找到你的答案了吗？ -我们的答案
Did you find your answer?

1116
01:16:49,20 --> 01:16:52,00
我还没看，我们一起看
Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet. I wanted you to share this.

1117
01:16:52,17 --> 01:16:54,64
我已经知道他是怎么变的
I already know how he does it, Robert.

1118
01:16:54,80 --> 01:16:57,67
他一贯的手法，跟我们一样
Same way he always has, the same way as we do.

1119
01:16:57,84 --> 01:17:00,21
但是你却不死心
It's just that you want something more.

1120
01:17:00,38 --> 01:17:01,93
我们一起看吧，好吗？
Well, let's find out then, shall we?

1121
01:17:07,48 --> 01:17:08,78
这是什么意思？
What does it mean?

1122
01:17:10,85 --> 01:17:12,62
(泰斯拉)

1123
01:17:16,86 --> 01:17:19,12
意思就是 我们得去旅行
It means, Cutter, we have a journey ahead of us.

1124
01:17:19,29 --> 01:17:22,02
-到美国 -劳勃
- To America. - Robert?

1125
01:17:22,20 --> 01:17:24,32
听我说
Listen to me.

1126
01:17:25,27 --> 01:17:28,63
着魔是年轻人玩的游戏
Obsession is a young man's game.

1127
01:17:28,80 --> 01:17:32,74
-别这么说 -我没办法再帮你了
Come on.

1128
01:17:30,29 --> 01:17:32,76
I can't follow you any further in it.

1129
01:17:33,98 --> 01:17:35,71
不行了，很抱歉
I can't, I'm sorry.

1130
01:17:40,02 --> 01:17:41,51
我只好一个人去了
Then the rest is up to me.

1131
01:17:43,62 --> 01:17:45,25
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1132
01:17:50,48 --> 01:17:54,07
Good evening. Hello, darling.

1133
01:17:52,23 --> 01:17:54,13
晚安，你好 亲爱的

1134
01:17:54,30 --> 01:17:55,66
来瓶最好的香槟
Champagne, your finest.

1135
01:17:56,40 --> 01:17:58,80
我不知道会有客人
I didn't know we were going to be joined for dinner.

1136
01:17:58,97 --> 01:18:01,90
-当然，大家要好好庆祝 -温小姐
Absolutely, we are celebrating.

1137
01:18:02,07 --> 01:18:05,01
法隆先生 我们要庆祝什么？
Miss Wenscombe, Mr. Fallon.

1138
01:18:03,56 --> 01:18:06,42
- What are we celebrating? - We've hit upon a new trick.

1139
01:18:05,17 --> 01:18:07,61
我们有新的魔术，对吧？
- Haven't we? - What trick, Freddie?

1140
01:18:07,78 --> 01:18:10,68
-佛迪，什么魔术？ -是啊，佛迪，什么魔术？
Yes, Freddie, what trick?

1141
01:18:10,85 --> 01:18:15,11
我每天晚上要把自己活埋
I am going to bury myself alive every night,

1142
01:18:15,28 --> 01:18:19,05
然后找人来把我挖出来
and then someone will come along and dig me up. Wonderful.

1143
01:18:19,22 --> 01:18:23,12
-我老公酒喝多了 -倒香槟，来吧
- I think he's had quite enough... - No, pour the champagne.

1144
01:18:23,29 --> 01:18:26,02
莎拉，别把我当三岁小孩
Pour the... Sarah, don't talk to me like that. I'm not a bloody child.

1145
01:18:26,19 --> 01:18:28,13
-我最好先走… -法隆
- Perhaps it would be better... - Mr. Fallon, escort her home.

1146
01:18:28,30 --> 01:18:31,36
请送温小姐回家 我老公很没礼貌
- My husband's being a bore. - Oh, please.

1147
01:18:31,53 --> 01:18:33,63
何必让你们受罪
- I see no reason you should suffer. - Don't ruin this evening.

1148
01:18:33,80 --> 01:18:35,10
别这么扫兴嘛

1149
01:18:38,57 --> 01:18:42,13
晚安，波登夫人 晚安，佛迪
Good night, Mrs. Borden. Good night, Freddie.

1150
01:18:45,95 --> 01:18:48,07
-佛迪？ -那是我的名字
- Freddie? - That's my name.

1151
01:18:48,25 --> 01:18:52,52
-在家里不是 -我又不常在家，对吧？
- Not at home. - I'm not always at home, am I?

1152
01:18:53,49 --> 01:18:56,39
你至少可以卸掉假胡子吧？
Couldn't you have at least taken off the beard?

1153
01:18:56,56 --> 01:19:00,22
莎拉，我才刚表演完
Sarah, I just came from the bloody theater just now.

1154
01:19:00,40 --> 01:19:02,09
大家都喜欢我这个模样
All right? I'm out in public. Everybody else loves it.

1155
01:19:02,26 --> 01:19:05,39
-大家都喜欢 -你怎么会变成这样？
Why are you being like this?

1156
01:19:06,03 --> 01:19:08,33
我今天真的很不顺
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1157
01:19:08,50 --> 01:19:13,13
差点失去一件
I thought that something very precious...

1158
01:19:13,31 --> 01:19:15,21
很宝贵的东西
...had been lost to me.

1159
01:19:15,38 --> 01:19:18,47
我只想稍微庆祝一下
So I just wanted to celebrate just a little.

1160
01:19:19,28 --> 01:19:20,91
什么？
All right, what? What did you lose?

1161
01:19:21,08 --> 01:19:22,81
你失去什么？

1162
01:19:27,39 --> 01:19:28,75
又是更多的秘密
I see, more secrets.

1163
01:19:29,73 --> 01:19:32,82
莎拉，秘密是我的生活重心
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1164
01:19:34,86 --> 01:19:36,89
-我们的生活 -艾佛，别再演了
- Our life. - No, Alfred, stop, this isn't you.

1165
01:19:37,07 --> 01:19:40,59
这不是你，别再演了
Stop performing.

1166
01:20:04,83 --> 01:20:07,35
我以为我是唯一的客人
I thought I had the place to myself.

1167
01:20:07,53 --> 01:20:08,89
有个不速之客
Unexpected guests, not very polite.

1168
01:20:09,06 --> 01:20:12,50
很没礼貌，问一大堆问题

1169
01:20:10,68 --> 01:20:12,52
A lot of questions.

1170
01:20:12,67 --> 01:20:15,30
我以为他们替政府工作
At first, I thought they worked for the government.

1171
01:20:15,47 --> 01:20:17,34
-不是吗？ -更糟
- No? - Worse, they work for Thomas Edison.

1172
01:20:17,51 --> 01:20:19,70
他们是爱迪生的手下

1173
01:20:21,08 --> 01:20:23,48
今天有不寻常的发展
<i>Today, a most curious development.</i>

1174
01:20:23,65 --> 01:20:27,67
他的女助手来找我
<i>His assistant came to us with a proposition.</i>

1175
01:20:28,48 --> 01:20:31,75
安杰派她来，承认自己卧底
<i>Obviously, Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much.</i>

1176
01:20:31,92 --> 01:20:34,65
他喜欢躲在台下吗？
Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

1177
01:20:34,82 --> 01:20:38,49
他派我来偷你秘诀 我来告诉你他的秘密
He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've come to offer you his.

1178
01:20:38,99 --> 01:20:42,56
这是实话吗？
This is the truth...

1179
01:20:41,58 --> 01:20:42,57
...is it?

1180
01:20:50,71 --> 01:20:54,00
不，这是他叫我说的
No, that's what he told me to tell you. The truth...

1181
01:20:54,18 --> 01:20:57,98
其实我是爱他的，一直在帮他
...is that I loved him and I stood by him and he sent me to you,

1182
01:20:58,15 --> 01:21:01,51
但是他把我当跑腿小妹派我来
like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts.

1183
01:21:01,68 --> 01:21:04,35
我恨他这样对我
I hate him for that.

1184
01:21:04,69 --> 01:21:08,52
我从大老远就看出安杰的手法
I could spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater.

1185
01:21:09,69 --> 01:21:11,72
你能给我什么？
So, what could you possibly have to offer me?

1186
01:21:12,23 --> 01:21:14,99
你或许知道他的手法 但是你不懂
You may know his tricks,

1187
01:21:13,51 --> 01:21:16,57
but you can't understand why no one sees yours are better.

1188
01:21:15,16 --> 01:21:17,63
大家看不出你比较厉害 你把断指包起来
You hide this. I had to look very closely

1189
01:21:17,80 --> 01:21:21,74
我要很仔细看才看得出来
to spot it during The Transported Man,

1190
01:21:21,90 --> 01:21:24,53
不过这是你的优势
but this makes you unique.

1191
01:21:24,71 --> 01:21:26,87
这代表你没有用替身
It shows you aren't using a double.

1192
01:21:27,04 --> 01:21:29,14
别把手包起来，要大方秀出来
You mustn't hide it. You must display it proudly.

1193
01:21:29,31 --> 01:21:33,58
你只用一只手变魔术一定很厉害
I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.

1194
01:21:34,05 --> 01:21:36,07
对，没错
Yeah, it does.

1195
01:21:37,62 --> 01:21:40,18
你要让大家知道
So let people know.

1196
01:21:41,02 --> 01:21:44,58
你比他高杆，我可以教你怎么成名
You can be so much more than he is and I can show you how.

1197
01:21:46,13 --> 01:21:47,89
我想她说的是真话
<i>I think she's telling the truth.</i>

1198
01:21:48,76 --> 01:21:50,89
不过我们不能信任她
<i>I think we cannot trust her.</i>

1199
01:21:54,60 --> 01:21:56,90
但是我爱她，也需要她
<i>But I love her. I need her.</i>

1200
01:21:58,21 --> 01:22:01,27
打开心房接受这段感情
<i>To open myself to such a relationship,</i>

1201
01:22:01,44 --> 01:22:05,31
面对外遇的危险
<i>to the dangers of such an affair,</i>

1202
01:22:05,81 --> 01:22:10,18
我必须确认她对我忠贞不二
<i>I need assurances of fidelity, of love.</i>

1203
01:22:11,29 --> 01:22:12,78
该怎么确信呢？
<i>But how to be sure?</i>

1204
01:22:15,19 --> 01:22:19,42
我有个方法 那是了解她心意的唯一方法
<i>I know a way. It's the only way to know her mind.</i>

1205
01:22:19,59 --> 01:22:21,26
他怎么舍得让你离开？
How could he send you away?

1206
01:22:23,13 --> 01:22:25,00
她必须帮我们除掉安杰
<i>She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.</i>

1207
01:22:32,94 --> 01:22:35,74
今天我的情妇证明了她的真心
<i>Today, my mistress proves her truthfulness.</i>

1208
01:22:35,91 --> 01:22:38,21
不是向我证明
<i>Not to me, you understand.</i>

1209
01:22:38,38 --> 01:22:40,35
她带我去找路特时 我就相信她了
<i>I've been convinced since she led me to Root.</i>

1210
01:22:40,52 --> 01:22:46,32
今天她在你面前证明她爱我
<i>Today, Olivia proves her love for me</i>

1211
01:22:44,04 --> 01:22:46,51
<i>to you, Angier.</i>

1212
01:22:46,49 --> 01:22:48,39
没错，安杰
<i>Yes, Angier, she gave you this notebook at my request.</i>

1213
01:22:48,56 --> 01:22:50,85
是我要她把笔记交给你

1214
01:22:51,03 --> 01:22:56,19
“泰斯拉”只是关键字，不是秘诀
<i>And yes, "Tesla" is merely the key to my dairy,</i>

1215
01:22:54,55 --> 01:22:57,35
<i>not to my trick. You really think I'd part</i>

1216
01:22:56,36 --> 01:23:00,89
你以为我会轻易把秘诀给你？
<i>with my secret so easily after so much?</i>

1217
01:23:01,07 --> 01:23:02,30
再见，安杰
<i>Goodbye, Angier.</i>

1218
01:23:02,47 --> 01:23:06,57
祝你在美国的新家找到安慰
<i>May you find solace for your forward ambition</i>

1219
01:23:04,79 --> 01:23:06,59
<i>back in your American home.</i>

1220
01:23:16,79 --> 01:23:17,25
泰斯拉…
Tesla!

1221
01:23:19,65 --> 01:23:22,45
泰斯拉… 艾利、艾利…
Tesla! Alley!

1222
01:23:24,43 --> 01:23:26,83
泰斯拉根本没打造我要的机器
Alley!

1223
01:23:24,34 --> 01:23:26,94
Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.

1224
01:23:27,00 --> 01:23:29,73
-我们没说他有啊 -但你让我认为他有
- I never said he had. - You let me believe that he had.

1225
01:23:29,90 --> 01:23:32,53
你们资金用完，所以骗我的钱
You stole my money because your funding was cut off.

1226
01:23:32,70 --> 01:23:36,47
拿我的高帽做实验，一边嘲笑我
You've been shooting sparks in my top hat,

1227
01:23:36,64 --> 01:23:39,11
一边拿我的钱来花
laughing at me all along, while using my money to stave off ruin.

1228
01:23:40,28 --> 01:23:42,07
-我看到爱迪生的人 -在哪里？
- I have seen Edison's men. - Where?

1229
01:23:42,24 --> 01:23:45,21
旅馆，我大可以把他们带来
In the hotel, I have a mind to bring them up here.

1230
01:23:45,38 --> 01:23:47,41
这么做很不明智，安杰
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1231
01:23:47,58 --> 01:23:50,61
你的确是我们最后的金主
It is true that you are our last remaining financier,

1232
01:23:50,79 --> 01:23:52,55
但是我们没偷你的钱
but we have not stolen your money.

1233
01:23:52,72 --> 01:23:54,09
我的猫
This is my cat.

1234
01:23:54,26 --> 01:23:57,22
我说能做出你要的机器是实话
When I told you I could make you a machine, I spoke a truth.

1235
01:23:57,39 --> 01:24:00,79
-那机器为什么没有用？ -科学不是绝对
Why isn't it working?

1236
01:23:58,48 --> 01:24:00,81
Because exact science, Mr. Angier,

1237
01:24:00,96 --> 01:24:02,26
它充满变数
is not an exact science.

1238
01:24:02,43 --> 01:24:05,52
机器不一定能正常运作
The machine simply does not operate as expected.

1239
01:24:05,70 --> 01:24:07,96
需要进行更多实验
- It requires further examination. - So where did my top hat go?

1240
01:24:08,14 --> 01:24:10,73
-我的高帽在哪里？ -就在这里

1241
01:24:10,91 --> 01:24:13,67
试了十几次
Nowhere.

1242
01:24:10,82 --> 01:24:13,62
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1243
01:24:13,84 --> 01:24:15,17
帽子一直在这里
The hat went nowhere.

1244
01:24:15,34 --> 01:24:17,28
我们必须试不同的东西
We need to try different material.

1245
01:24:17,45 --> 01:24:21,11
才可能有不同的结果
It may provoke a different result.

1246
01:24:22,05 --> 01:24:23,71
猫咪，过来
Great.

1247
01:24:30,89 --> 01:24:35,39
我的猫出了事你要负责，博士
You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, doctor.

1248
01:24:56,48 --> 01:25:00,15
我只希望我的钱花得很值得
I hope whatever you were really doing with my money

1249
01:25:00,32 --> 01:25:02,26
泰斯拉先生
was more worthwhile, Mr. Tesla.

1250
01:25:57,38 --> 01:25:58,37
艾利
Alley!

1251
01:26:01,78 --> 01:26:03,01
机器真的有用
So the machine was working?

1252
01:26:03,18 --> 01:26:06,71
我没去检查，因为帽子都没动
I never checked the calibration, 'cause the hat never moved.

1253
01:26:06,89 --> 01:26:09,95
事情总是很难如你所愿
These things never quite work as you expect them to.

1254
01:26:10,13 --> 01:26:12,29
这也是科学原则
That's one of the principal beauties of science.

1255
01:26:12,46 --> 01:26:15,83
我要花几个星期解决问题
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine.

1256
01:26:16,00 --> 01:26:18,19
好了就通知你
We'll send word when it's ready.

1257
01:26:20,40 --> 01:26:22,49
别忘了你的帽子
Don't forget your hat.

1258
01:26:23,47 --> 01:26:27,10
-哪一顶是我的？ -都是你的，安杰先生
- Well, which one is mine? - They are all your hats.

1259
01:26:33,11 --> 01:26:36,02
你穿这件新衣服好漂亮哦
You look so pretty in this new dress of yours.

1260
01:26:36,18 --> 01:26:40,05
-我们要去动物园吗？ -爸爸有别的事情要办
- Are we going to the zoo? - No, Daddy has some errands to run.

1261
01:26:40,22 --> 01:26:42,21
-你答应过我 -是吗？
- But you promised. - I promised, did I?

1262
01:26:42,39 --> 01:26:44,55
那就去动物园吧
Then go to the zoo, we shall.

1263
01:26:44,73 --> 01:26:48,03
我先去办事，马上就回来
Daddy will go run his errands, and I'll be back before you know it.

1264
01:26:48,20 --> 01:26:51,89
你去准备好 我们去看黑猩猩
So you go get ready. We'll go see those chimpanzees.

1265
01:26:55,17 --> 01:26:57,33
莎拉
Sarah... what are you doing?

1266
01:26:57,51 --> 01:26:58,53
你在做什么？

1267
01:27:02,21 --> 01:27:05,20
我们各自有沉迷的事情
Each of us have our vices.

1268
01:27:08,25 --> 01:27:12,02
莎拉，不管你怎么想
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1269
01:27:12,19 --> 01:27:15,78
你唯一的对手是我们的女儿
...your only competition for my affections is our little girl.

1270
01:27:15,96 --> 01:27:20,29
我爱你，永远爱你 我只爱你
I love you. I will always love you

1271
01:27:18,91 --> 01:27:20,35
and you alone.

1272
01:27:22,33 --> 01:27:25,53
-你今天是真心的 -一点也没错
- You mean it today. - Absolutely.

1273
01:27:26,37 --> 01:27:29,67
当你骗我会让我更痛苦
Which makes it so much harder when you don't.

1274
01:27:39,35 --> 01:27:42,08
又要买东西？ 她真是爱钱
More shopping. She does love the smell of money.

1275
01:27:42,25 --> 01:27:45,69
女儿想去动物园，你带她去吧
The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so I thought you could take her, yeah?

1276
01:27:45,85 --> 01:27:48,85
不然我明天可以带她去
I mean, I can do it tomorrow, if not.

1277
01:27:49,02 --> 01:27:54,48
莎拉已经知道了
And, uh... Sarah,

1278
01:27:52,31 --> 01:27:54,44
she knows.

1279
01:27:54,66 --> 01:27:58,53
她知道事情有点不对劲
Uh, at least she knows that something is not right,

1280
01:27:58,70 --> 01:28:02,16
请你尽量帮我安抚她的情绪
so if you can just do whatever you can to help me.

1281
01:28:02,34 --> 01:28:06,27
说服她我是真的爱她
Talk to her, just convince her that I do love her.

1282
01:28:17,25 --> 01:28:21,28
-佛迪，怎么了？ -别这样叫我，拜托
What is it, Freddie?

1283
01:28:18,97 --> 01:28:21,27
Listen, don't call me that, please.

1284
01:28:21,46 --> 01:28:23,52
没事，只是有时
It's nothing. It's just that sometimes it seems wrong.

1285
01:28:23,69 --> 01:28:26,39
-有时我觉得很内疚 -我说过

1286
01:28:26,56 --> 01:28:28,36
跟我一起心里只能有我
I told you, when you're with me, you're with me.

1287
01:28:28,53 --> 01:28:30,66
你回家再想你的家人
Leave your family at home where they belong.

1288
01:28:31,07 --> 01:28:32,53
我一直在试
I'm trying. I'm trying, Olivia.

1289
01:28:32,70 --> 01:28:34,19
我一直在试，我很努力

1290
01:28:34,37 --> 01:28:36,86
-我要换衣服了 -好
- I'll get dressed. - Yeah.

1291
01:28:38,17 --> 01:28:41,27
我看见法隆在附近晃
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1292
01:28:41,58 --> 01:28:43,70
我对他不太信任
There's something about that man I don't trust.

1293
01:28:44,05 --> 01:28:46,84
你信任我吗？那就信任法隆
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1294
01:28:47,35 --> 01:28:49,58
他保护我在乎的东西
He protects the things that I care about.

1295
01:29:27,92 --> 01:29:30,22
很遗憾你要离开了，安先生
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1296
01:29:30,39 --> 01:29:32,95
真遗憾泰斯拉也要离开
We were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave, as well.

1297
01:29:33,13 --> 01:29:35,12
他对这地方贡献良多
He's very good to Colorado Springs.

1298
01:29:35,63 --> 01:29:41,57
安先生 我没告诉爱迪生手下有关箱子的事
Mr. Angier,

1299
01:29:37,95 --> 01:29:41,58
I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box.

1300
01:29:42,27 --> 01:29:43,26
什么箱子？
What box?

1301
01:30:00,42 --> 01:30:01,82
(安杰先生收)

1302
01:30:08,73 --> 01:30:12,06
很抱歉离开之前没向你道别
<i>I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye.</i>

1303
01:30:12,53 --> 01:30:16,70
但我在这里已经不受欢迎
<i>But I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado.</i>

1304
01:30:17,47 --> 01:30:21,91
科学和工业界不能容忍前卫科技
<i>The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry.</i>

1305
01:30:22,08 --> 01:30:27,51
大概只有你的魔术能受到肯定 观众喜欢解不开的谜
<i>Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field,</i>

1306
01:30:24,86 --> 01:30:27,53
<i>where people are happy to be mystified.</i>

1307
01:30:27,68 --> 01:30:31,58
你会在箱子里找到你要的
<i>You will find what you are looking for in this box.</i>

1308
01:30:32,02 --> 01:30:36,05
艾利写了详细的使用说明书
<i>Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions.</i>

1309
01:30:36,22 --> 01:30:40,85
我对你只有一个建议
<i>I add only one suggestion on using the machine.</i>

1310
01:30:41,03 --> 01:30:42,96
毁了这具机器
<i>Destroy it.</i>

1311
01:30:43,13 --> 01:30:46,23
将它丢进最深的海底
<i>Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.</i>

1312
01:30:46,40 --> 01:30:49,60
它只会带给你不幸
<i>Such a thing will bring you only misery.</i>

1313
01:30:53,67 --> 01:30:57,20
如泰斯拉所料，他无视他的警告
<i>Tesla's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be.</i>

1314
01:30:57,38 --> 01:30:59,31
今天我要测试机器
<i>Today I tested the machine. Taking precautions in case</i>

1315
01:30:59,48 --> 01:31:03,94
预防它运作时出问题
<i>Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.</i>

1316
01:31:04,12 --> 01:31:08,95
如果出事，我不想那样过活
<i>But if it went wrong,</i>

1317
01:31:05,87 --> 01:31:08,03
<i>I would not want to live like that for long.</i>

1318
01:31:27,61 --> 01:31:31,64
这就是偷天换日的步骤 我要遗弃你了，波登
<i>But here at the turn, I must leave you, Borden.</i>

1319
01:31:31,81 --> 01:31:33,97
没错，就是你，波登
<i>Yes, you, Borden,</i>

1320
01:31:34,15 --> 01:31:36,38
坐在牢房
<i>sitting there in your cell,</i>

1321
01:31:36,55 --> 01:31:40,58
读着我的日记 因为谋杀我
<i>reading my diary, awaiting your death,</i>

1322
01:31:40,76 --> 01:31:42,81
等待死亡的来临
<i>for my murder.</i>

1323
01:31:48,00 --> 01:31:51,23
安杰的日记，那是假的
Angier's journal, that gesture of good faith, that's a fake.

1324
01:31:51,40 --> 01:31:55,36
我向你保证是真的 来历很清楚，没有疑问
I assure you, it's not.

1325
01:31:52,62 --> 01:31:55,55
The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt.

1326
01:31:55,54 --> 01:32:00,10
比对之后证实是安杰的笔迹
And it's written in Angier's own hand, for which we have numerous examples.

1327
01:32:02,04 --> 01:32:03,84
无所谓了
It don't matter.

1328
01:32:05,91 --> 01:32:08,81
这是我的秘诀
So my tricks.

1329
01:32:11,19 --> 01:32:14,85
-全部的戏法 -包括移形遁影术？
- All of them. - Including The Transported Man?

1330
01:32:15,69 --> 01:32:17,99
卡德洛爵士会很高兴
- Lord Caldlow will be very pleased. - No, he won't.

1331
01:32:18,16 --> 01:32:21,65
他不会的，因为不完整
They're not complete.

1332
01:32:21,83 --> 01:32:24,42
只有以虚代实和偷天换日
It's just the pledge and the turn for each.

1333
01:32:24,60 --> 01:32:27,19
没有化腐朽为神奇的秘诀
Without the prestige for these tricks, these are worthless.

1334
01:32:27,80 --> 01:32:30,13
-根本就一文不值 -没错
Yeah.

1335
01:32:30,81 --> 01:32:34,26
想要的话就带我女儿来
You get the rest of it... when you bring my daughter here.

1336
01:32:37,14 --> 01:32:39,20
我想跟她说再见
I want to say goodbye.

1337
01:32:41,08 --> 01:32:42,81
不，我们必须谈谈
We have to go through it now. We have to go through it now.

1338
01:32:42,98 --> 01:32:45,15
我们必须谈谈
Now, listen to me, deny it all you want.

1339
01:32:45,32 --> 01:32:46,58
你可以尽管否认
Olivia means nothing.

1340
01:32:46,75 --> 01:32:49,05
我根本就不爱奥莉薇雅

1341
01:32:49,22 --> 01:32:51,92
-我需要助手，不能没有助手 -我会告诉她…
- Olivia? - I need an assistant.

1342
01:32:52,09 --> 01:32:53,79
-我会告诉她… -告诉她什么？
- I'll go to her, I'll tell her. - You'll tell her what?

1343
01:32:53,96 --> 01:32:57,66
我知道你的秘密
I know what you really are, Alfred.

1344
01:32:58,13 --> 01:33:00,07
-我再也无法… -莎拉，莎拉
- I know. - Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

1345
01:33:00,23 --> 01:33:02,50
-我再也无法隐瞒下去 -别胡说八道
- I can't keep it in. - You can't talk like this.

1346
01:33:02,67 --> 01:33:05,30
莎拉，住嘴 莎拉，住嘴
- No. No. - Sarah, shut up! Sarah, shut up!

1347
01:33:05,47 --> 01:33:07,10
我不想再听了
I don't want to hear it anymore. You can't talk like this.

1348
01:33:07,28 --> 01:33:10,30
你不能这样

1349
01:33:12,01 --> 01:33:15,07
你瞒不住的，因为我知道
You can't hide it anymore, because I know, Alfred, I know.

1350
01:33:15,25 --> 01:33:16,94
我知道你的真面目
I know what you really are, Alfred.

1351
01:33:17,12 --> 01:33:18,81
艾佛

1352
01:33:18,99 --> 01:33:21,68
我不能这样过活
I can't live like this.

1353
01:33:21,86 --> 01:33:23,82
你觉得我可以这样过活？
Oh, well, you think I can live like this?

1354
01:33:23,99 --> 01:33:27,12
我很享受这种生活吗？
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?

1355
01:33:27,30 --> 01:33:29,89
我们有房子、有女儿
We have this beautiful house, lovely little girl, we're married.

1356
01:33:30,06 --> 01:33:33,33
你的生活有什么不好？

1357
01:33:31,68 --> 01:33:33,35
What is so wrong with your life?

1358
01:33:33,50 --> 01:33:35,99
我不要这种生活
Alfred, I can't live like this!

1359
01:33:36,40 --> 01:33:39,03
你到底要我怎么样？
Well, what do you want from me?

1360
01:33:41,79 --> 01:33:45,49
I... I want...

1361
01:33:43,68 --> 01:33:45,31
我要…

1362
01:33:45,48 --> 01:33:48,61
我要你对我诚实
I want you to be... honest with me.

1363
01:33:51,49 --> 01:33:53,35
不耍魔术
No tricks.

1364
01:33:53,99 --> 01:33:57,39
不说谎话
No lies.

1365
01:33:56,08 --> 01:33:59,88
And no secrets.

1366
01:33:57,76 --> 01:34:00,78
没有秘密

1367
01:34:06,40 --> 01:34:09,73
你爱我吗？
Do you... do you love me?

1368
01:34:12,57 --> 01:34:14,30
今天不爱
Not today.

1369
01:34:16,28 --> 01:34:17,34
我不爱你
No.

1370
01:35:26,08 --> 01:35:28,41
(奥德维奇路230号 伦敦)

1371
01:35:55,31 --> 01:35:57,30
是谁？
Who's there?

1372
01:35:59,41 --> 01:36:01,21
我来找位老朋友
I'm looking for an old friend.

1373
01:36:01,38 --> 01:36:02,51
听说有一场表演
I heard about a booking, nice little theater,

1374
01:36:03,32 --> 01:36:05,84
不错的小戏院，魔术界的新秀
- good up-and-coming magician. - You're back.

1375
01:36:06,02 --> 01:36:08,49
-你回来了 -见到你真好，约翰
It's good to see you, John.

1376
01:36:09,42 --> 01:36:12,02
不错的排练场
Good rehearsal space.

1377
01:36:12,19 --> 01:36:14,82
瞎子助手，我喜欢
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1378
01:36:15,00 --> 01:36:17,43
你一向都很会耍宣传噱头
You always had a good eye for publicity.

1379
01:36:17,60 --> 01:36:18,96
我需要你的帮忙
I need your help, John.

1380
01:36:19,50 --> 01:36:21,83
我最后的表演，限定场次
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1381
01:36:22,27 --> 01:36:23,53
你最后的表演？
Your last show?

1382
01:36:24,07 --> 01:36:27,53
一位智者说着魔是年轻人的游戏
A wise man once told me obsession was a young man's game.

1383
01:36:27,71 --> 01:36:28,70
我差不多完成了
I'm almost done. There's one thing left.

1384
01:36:29,68 --> 01:36:31,44
只剩一件事

1385
01:36:32,51 --> 01:36:34,88
真正的移形遁影术
The Real Transported Man.

1386
01:36:36,78 --> 01:36:38,72
你想要为它设计一场表演
You want to design a show around it?

1387
01:36:38,89 --> 01:36:41,65
我不要你在幕后 这次我要你在外面办事
I don't want you backstage I need you in front managing.

1388
01:36:41,82 --> 01:36:44,35
我要你动用你所有的关系
Call in any favors or connections you have left

1389
01:36:44,53 --> 01:36:48,12
-敲定表演场地 -你要哪一种剧院？
to get us the right booking.

1390
01:36:46,01 --> 01:36:48,10
What sort of booking you after?

1391
01:36:48,30 --> 01:36:50,53
波登会注意到的大剧院
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1392
01:36:56,96 --> 01:37:00,19
Oh, what an honor it is to see you again, sir.

1393
01:36:58,57 --> 01:37:00,63
能再见到你真是我的荣幸

1394
01:37:00,81 --> 01:37:04,14
你说有一个魔术会让我很感兴趣
You told me you only wanted to show me one trick that'd pique my interest.

1395
01:37:04,31 --> 01:37:07,37
-非常巧妙的魔术 -幸会了，艾克曼先生
- It's a very clever trick. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.

1396
01:37:07,55 --> 01:37:10,38
彼此彼此，开始吧 各位
Likewise, I'm sure. Let's get on, shall we?

1397
01:37:14,26 --> 01:37:16,22
开动机器了 先生们
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1398
01:37:21,10 --> 01:37:22,15
很漂亮
Very pretty.

1399
01:37:33,34 --> 01:37:36,78
就这样？他就这样消失了？
That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears?

1400
01:37:36,94 --> 01:37:39,78
这不是魔术啊！ 他必须回来啊！
That's not a trick. He has to come back.

1401
01:37:39,95 --> 01:37:41,41
-他必须… -化腐朽为神奇？
- There has to be a... - A prestige?

1402
01:37:41,58 --> 01:37:42,61
没错
Exactly.

1403
01:37:45,79 --> 01:37:47,58
原谅我
Pardon me.

1404
01:37:48,36 --> 01:37:50,79
很难得见到…
It's very rare to see...

1405
01:37:51,73 --> 01:37:53,66
真正的魔术
...real magic.

1406
01:37:54,46 --> 01:37:58,12
-我有很多年没见到… -有兴趣帮助我们吗？
It's been many years since...

1407
01:37:56,45 --> 01:37:58,18
Are you interested in helping us?

1408
01:38:00,33 --> 01:38:01,80
当然
Yes... but you'll have to dress it up a little.

1409
01:38:02,40 --> 01:38:04,74
不过你得稍微包装一下

1410
01:38:06,37 --> 01:38:08,03
加一点伪装
Disguise it.

1411
01:38:09,61 --> 01:38:12,08
让观众有怀疑的理由
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1412
01:38:12,95 --> 01:38:16,14
你都没谈到莎拉，半句也没有
You haven't spoken about her, Freddie, not once.

1413
01:38:16,32 --> 01:38:19,91
我们为什么要谈她？
Why would I talk about her to you, hm?

1414
01:38:20,29 --> 01:38:22,48
她曾是你生命的一部分
Because she was a part of your life and now she's gone.

1415
01:38:22,66 --> 01:38:23,82
现在她死了

1416
01:38:26,73 --> 01:38:31,03
她自杀前一天说她想见我
You know, the day before she killed herself she said she wanted to meet me.

1417
01:38:31,50 --> 01:38:34,30
她想告诉我关于你的事
That she had something to tell me about you.

1418
01:38:34,47 --> 01:38:37,80
但是我没胆量，不敢去见她
I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1419
01:38:37,97 --> 01:38:39,63
不过…
But...

1420
01:38:41,21 --> 01:38:43,01
她想跟我说什么？
...what would she have said?

1421
01:38:43,18 --> 01:38:46,08
你想知道我的真相？
You want to know the truth about me?

1422
01:38:47,21 --> 01:38:50,71
真相是…
The truth is that...

1423
01:38:52,12 --> 01:38:54,11
我从来没爱过莎拉
...I never loved Sarah.

1424
01:38:55,82 --> 01:38:56,81
我不爱她
I never loved her.

1425
01:38:56,99 --> 01:39:00,32
-你娶了她，你们有个孩子 -那是一半的我
You married her, you had a child with her.

1426
01:39:00,49 --> 01:39:04,19
有一半是我，另一半不是我
Yes. Part of me. Part of me did, but...

1427
01:39:02,38 --> 01:39:04,32
...the other part didn't.

1428
01:39:04,37 --> 01:39:07,70
这个我遇见了你，坐在你面前
The part that found you, the part that's sitting here right now.

1429
01:39:08,84 --> 01:39:09,83
我爱的是你
I love you. No, Olivia, I love you.

1430
01:39:10,30 --> 01:39:13,71
我爱你，这才是真相

1431
01:39:11,82 --> 01:39:13,79
That's the truth.

1432
01:39:13,87 --> 01:39:16,27
这个真相才重要
That is the truth that matters.

1433
01:39:16,44 --> 01:39:20,68
你也很可能在另一家餐厅
You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now,

1434
01:39:20,85 --> 01:39:22,44
对别的女人这么说我
talking about me that way.

1435
01:39:22,62 --> 01:39:24,61
-不会 -你会的
- No. - Yes.

1436
01:39:27,99 --> 01:39:32,76
你冷酷得真没人性
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1437
01:39:37,93 --> 01:39:41,73
他回来了 事隔两年
He's back.

1438
01:39:39,62 --> 01:39:42,88
After two years, he's got a new trick.

1439
01:39:41,90 --> 01:39:45,57
他有了新魔术 大家都说是前所未见的表演
They're saying it's the best London's ever seen.

1440
01:39:47,91 --> 01:39:51,31
你该看看你的表情，大师
You should see the look on your face, Professor.

1441
01:39:52,28 --> 01:39:54,14
你应该去见他
You should go to him.

1442
01:39:54,32 --> 01:39:56,68
你们俩是绝配
You two deserve each other.

1443
01:40:01,79 --> 01:40:05,59
有人订下我的剧院 莫斯科芭蕾舞团要演到明年
But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet plays through next year.

1444
01:40:05,76 --> 01:40:08,35
取消他们的演出 我要做一百场演出
Then get rid of them. There will be 100 performances, no more, no less.

1445
01:40:08,53 --> 01:40:10,22
不多也不少

1446
01:40:10,40 --> 01:40:12,83
每周五场，没有下午场
Five performances a week, no matinees.

1447
01:40:14,74 --> 01:40:17,67
这是门票的价格，祝愉快
That's what you'll charge for each ticket. Good day.

1448
01:40:40,46 --> 01:40:42,95
各位我今晚的…
Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening involves considerable risk.

1449
01:40:43,13 --> 01:40:45,79
第一个表演非常危险

1450
01:40:46,33 --> 01:40:49,00
怕看到有人被淹死的观众
Anyone in the audience

1451
01:40:49,17 --> 01:40:52,20
请离席
who would be irrevocably damaged by seeing a man drown

1452
01:40:50,59 --> 01:40:52,18
should leave now.

1453
01:40:52,37 --> 01:40:55,34
教我这招魔术的女孩
When I tell you the lady who taught me this illusion

1454
01:40:55,51 --> 01:40:57,10
在表演时溺死
actually died performing it,

1455
01:40:57,28 --> 01:41:00,47
你们应该了解这有多危险
you'll understand the seriousness of the dangers involved.

1456
01:41:02,72 --> 01:41:04,45
开始吧
Let's begin.

1457
01:41:14,83 --> 01:41:18,20
我在旅行中看见了未来
In my travels, I have seen the future.

1458
01:41:19,33 --> 01:41:22,17
非常奇异的未来
And it is a strange future, indeed.

1459
01:41:22,87 --> 01:41:24,93
各位先生女士
The world, ladies and gentlemen,

1460
01:41:25,11 --> 01:41:30,41
这世界面临崭新骇人的可能性
is on the brink of new

1461
01:41:27,49 --> 01:41:29,22
and terrifying possibilities.

1462
01:41:49,70 --> 01:41:54,13
你们即将目睹的不是魔术
What you're about to witness is not magic.

1463
01:41:54,30 --> 01:41:55,77
而是纯粹的科学见证
It's purely science.

1464
01:41:56,17 --> 01:41:58,57
尽管上台来
I'd like to invite you to come up on stage now

1465
01:41:58,74 --> 01:42:01,64
亲自检查这台机器
so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1466
01:42:57,13 --> 01:43:00,29
人类的成就远远超过想像力
Man's reach

1467
01:42:58,52 --> 01:43:01,65
exceeds his imagination.

1468
01:43:00,47 --> 01:43:01,66
太棒了！

1469
01:43:04,64 --> 01:43:07,23
太棒了！

1470
01:43:11,51 --> 01:43:14,24
太棒了！
Bravo!

1471
01:43:22,49 --> 01:43:24,15
一百场演出
One hundred performances. Why?

1472
01:43:24,32 --> 01:43:26,62
为什么？ 受限于手法？
Does his method dictate that?

1473
01:43:26,79 --> 01:43:28,69
或是宣传伎俩？
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1474
01:43:28,86 --> 01:43:33,56
他只是个瘪脚的魔术师 凭什么被称为英国顶尖大师？
He's a no-talent magician, and they call him

1475
01:43:31,18 --> 01:43:33,58
the bloody best in England. Why?

1476
01:43:33,73 --> 01:43:36,40
一秒钟移形五十码？
Fifty yards in a second! In a second!

1477
01:43:36,57 --> 01:43:39,54
我只知道他用暗门
And all that we know is he uses a trap door.

1478
01:43:39,71 --> 01:43:43,90
太厉害了 舞台底下有什么玄机？
Brilliant! What is going on under that stage? Huh?!

1479
01:43:44,08 --> 01:43:46,88
你为什么猜不到？
Why can't you out-think him?

1480
01:44:01,60 --> 01:44:03,12
每晚演出后
They do this every night, after each performance. Yeah?

1481
01:44:03,30 --> 01:44:06,46
都偷偷把它运走？

1482
01:44:33,13 --> 01:44:35,15
(真正的移形遁影术)
Huh.

1483
01:44:35,25 --> 01:44:38,22
We're done.

1484
01:44:36,86 --> 01:44:38,46
我们没辙了

1485
01:44:39,63 --> 01:44:41,07
好吗？
All right?

1486
01:44:42,50 --> 01:44:44,13
让他变他的
Let him have his trick.

1487
01:44:44,30 --> 01:44:46,74
我不要他的秘诀
I don't need his secret.

1488
01:44:46,91 --> 01:44:48,47
所以…
So...

1489
01:44:49,84 --> 01:44:52,71
别去了，离他远点
...don't go back there, you leave him alone.

1490
01:44:52,91 --> 01:44:56,08
我们俩都离他远一点
Both of us... just leave him alone.

1491
01:44:56,25 --> 01:44:57,72
我们输了
We're done.

1492
01:45:06,66 --> 01:45:08,63
我说过，约翰
I told you, John.

1493
01:45:08,80 --> 01:45:10,73
我不要你到后台
I don't want you backstage on this one.

1494
01:45:12,60 --> 01:45:15,00
尽管上台
I would like to invite you onstage now

1495
01:45:15,17 --> 01:45:17,30
亲自检查这台机器
so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1496
01:45:46,70 --> 01:45:50,73
-你想去哪里？ -我是表演的一部分，猪头
- Hey, where do you think...? - I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1497
01:45:59,78 --> 01:46:01,54
那是谁？
Who was that?

1498
01:46:58,11 --> 01:46:59,13
嘿！
Hey! Where's the bloody key?!

1499
01:46:59,31 --> 01:47:02,80
钥匙在哪里？钥匙在哪里？

1500
01:47:01,29 --> 01:47:02,85
Where's the bloody key?!

1501
01:47:03,01 --> 01:47:05,24
在瞎子那里

1502
01:47:05,41 --> 01:47:08,97
钥匙在哪里？他快淹死了！
Where's the bloody key?! He's bloody drowning!

1503
01:47:18,36 --> 01:47:20,29
撑着点
Hold on!

1504
01:47:24,73 --> 01:47:25,99
你做了什么？
What have you done?

1505
01:47:47,92 --> 01:47:53,26
艾佛波登 你被判谋杀劳勃安杰有罪
Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.

1506
01:47:53,43 --> 01:47:57,06
将被判处绞刑至死
You will be hanged by the neck until dead.

1507
01:47:57,86 --> 01:48:00,86
愿主让你的灵魂安息
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1508
01:48:02,47 --> 01:48:04,27
柯特先生
Mr. Cutter?

1509
01:48:05,01 --> 01:48:06,30
我是欧文
Owens.

1510
01:48:07,01 --> 01:48:09,17
谢谢你赶来
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

1511
01:48:09,34 --> 01:48:13,64
我必须处理安杰的魔术道具
It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1512
01:48:13,81 --> 01:48:15,41
我发现多半都…
But I notice from this manifest

1513
01:48:15,58 --> 01:48:19,04
被卡德洛爵士买走了
that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.

1514
01:48:19,22 --> 01:48:23,16
你想知道东西要送到哪里…
Mr. Cutter, if you need to know where to deliver these items...

1515
01:48:23,32 --> 01:48:26,62
不，只是有一件道具
No, it's just there is one particular item,

1516
01:48:26,79 --> 01:48:30,82
就是这一件 我想要…
this item, in fact,

1517
01:48:31,00 --> 01:48:32,99
-你想要怎样？ -买下来
- I would like to... - You would like to...

1518
01:48:33,17 --> 01:48:35,10
-你想买？ -对，没错
...buy.

1519
01:48:33,22 --> 01:48:35,12
- Buy yourself? - Yeah, I suppose so.

1520
01:48:36,34 --> 01:48:38,27
-就是这台机器？ -是的
- This is the machine? - Yes.

1521
01:48:38,44 --> 01:48:42,88
恐怕卡德洛爵士会不肯割爱
Well, I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant

1522
01:48:40,66 --> 01:48:42,89
about purchasing this particular item.

1523
01:48:43,34 --> 01:48:46,04
我能跟卡爵士私下谈一下吗？
Do you think I could talk to Lord Caldlow in person?

1524
01:48:46,48 --> 01:48:48,88
想都别想
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

1525
01:48:51,42 --> 01:48:53,18
不过
Of course,

1526
01:48:53,35 --> 01:48:56,25
如果你在运送过程…
I suppose if, in the course of your delivery arrangements,

1527
01:48:56,42 --> 01:48:58,86
无意间遇见他
your paths were to cross, I can't stop you speaking your mind.

1528
01:48:59,29 --> 01:49:03,19
-我也不能阻止你们说话 -谢谢你

1529
01:49:02,05 --> 01:49:03,17
Thank you.

1530
01:49:04,70 --> 01:49:06,89
-你还在啊，波登 -是啊
- Still here, Borden? - For now.

1531
01:49:07,60 --> 01:49:08,59
你有访客
You got a visitor. Lord Caldlow.

1532
01:49:08,77 --> 01:49:09,76
卡德洛爵士

1533
01:49:10,64 --> 01:49:12,70
带着一个小女孩
With a little girl.

1534
01:49:21,21 --> 01:49:22,81
洁丝？
Jess?

1535
01:49:22,98 --> 01:49:24,47
亲爱的
Hello, my love.

1536
01:49:25,19 --> 01:49:28,05
你好吗？ 我好想你哦
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1537
01:49:28,22 --> 01:49:30,25
法隆也想你，我们都想你
Fallon's missed you too. We both have.

1538
01:49:30,42 --> 01:49:32,65
爸爸，我能进去吗？
Daddy, can I come in there?

1539
01:49:33,43 --> 01:49:35,79
现在不行，不行 甜心
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1540
01:49:35,96 --> 01:49:39,49
放心，一切都不会有事的
No, but everything is gonna be all right.

1541
01:49:39,93 --> 01:49:42,60
-你一定是卡德洛爵士 -卡洛德
You must be Lord Caldlow?

1542
01:49:42,97 --> 01:49:44,06
我就是
Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been.

1543
01:49:44,24 --> 01:49:45,40
我一直都是

1544
01:49:50,48 --> 01:49:52,60
他们还替你戴手铐啊，艾佛
They flatter you with all those chains.

1545
01:49:52,78 --> 01:49:55,75
他们难道不知道 你没有小皮球绝对逃不了吗？
Don't they know you can't escape without your rubber ball?

1546
01:49:55,92 --> 01:49:57,04
我把你…
I pulled you out... out of that tank.

1547
01:49:57,22 --> 01:49:58,74
从水箱拉出来

1548
01:49:58,92 --> 01:50:02,58
我只想证明我比你厉害
All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician.

1549
01:50:02,76 --> 01:50:04,62
你却不放过我
But you couldn't leave me alone.

1550
01:50:06,29 --> 01:50:08,49
我不知道你做了什么
I don't know what you've done.

1551
01:50:10,36 --> 01:50:13,86
不过你不怕杀生弄脏手了
But you're not afraid to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1552
01:50:14,03 --> 01:50:15,87
是啊，再也不怕了
No, not anymore. And I win.

1553
01:50:16,04 --> 01:50:17,26
而且我赢了
No one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.

1554
01:50:17,44 --> 01:50:20,63
因为没有人在乎消失的人

1555
01:50:20,81 --> 01:50:21,80
你赢了？
You win?

1556
01:50:23,34 --> 01:50:27,75
这不是对决，事关我女儿的未来
This ain't a bloody competition anymore. This is my little girl's life.

1557
01:50:27,91 --> 01:50:30,97
你不能把她扯进来
And don't you dare put her in the middle of this.

1558
01:50:31,15 --> 01:50:33,98
我了解心爱的人
Oh, I know how hard it is to have someone so special

1559
01:50:34,15 --> 01:50:36,78
被人夺走的感受
taken away from you, don't I, Borden?

1560
01:50:37,62 --> 01:50:40,25
你死了就不能带她走了
And you can't take it with you, now, can you?

1561
01:50:40,43 --> 01:50:42,19
我会好好照顾她的
Oh, she'll be looked after.

1562
01:50:42,73 --> 01:50:46,86
-再见了，来吧 -不…别走…你瞧
Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.

1563
01:50:44,38 --> 01:50:46,15
No, no, no, no, stop, my darling.

1564
01:50:47,03 --> 01:50:48,33
拿去
Look, here.

1565
01:50:49,80 --> 01:50:51,53
这是你一直想要的东西
That's what you're after. That's what this is about.

1566
01:50:51,71 --> 01:50:53,80
一切都是为了这个

1567
01:50:53,97 --> 01:50:55,24
拿去吧
Take it.

1568
01:50:55,41 --> 01:50:57,34
-你的秘诀？ -对
- Your secret? - Yeah.

1569
01:51:00,35 --> 01:51:02,75
你一直都比我高杆
You always were the better magician. We both know that.

1570
01:51:02,92 --> 01:51:04,41
我们都很清楚

1571
01:51:04,58 --> 01:51:08,28
但是不管你有什么秘诀 你得承认
Whatever your secret was, you have to agree,

1572
01:51:08,52 --> 01:51:09,55
我的魔术比你厉害
mine is better.

1573
01:51:11,46 --> 01:51:14,66
别这么做… 洁丝
Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier. Jess, Jess!

1574
01:51:15,23 --> 01:51:18,22
我答应要带你回家 我保证
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise.

1575
01:51:18,40 --> 01:51:20,87
-拜托 -我保证，瞧
- For God's sake. - I promise. Look!

1576
01:51:24,84 --> 01:51:26,24
我保证
I promise. I love you, Jess.

1577
01:51:26,41 --> 01:51:30,04
我爱你，洁丝 我爱你

1578
01:51:28,39 --> 01:51:30,05
I love you.

1579
01:51:30,21 --> 01:51:33,41
-来吧 -我爱你，洁丝
- Come on. - I love you.

1580
01:51:31,83 --> 01:51:33,53
I love you, Jess.

1581
01:51:33,58 --> 01:51:35,91
安杰、安杰
Angier! Angier!

1582
01:51:36,08 --> 01:51:38,07
你以为这地方困得住我吗？
What, do you think this place can hold me?

1583
01:51:38,25 --> 01:51:41,12
安杰，我会被吊死
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1584
01:51:41,29 --> 01:51:44,38
我会被吊死，你可以阻止他们
And you can put a stop to this now!

1585
01:51:44,56 --> 01:51:46,65
-听着！听着！那个人 -闭嘴
Listen! Listen! That man...

1586
01:51:46,83 --> 01:51:49,26
那个人是大家以为 被我杀死的人
Listen, that man is the one I'm in for killing!

1587
01:51:49,43 --> 01:51:51,36
猪头，听我说
Listen! If he's alive, I'm not guilty!

1588
01:51:51,53 --> 01:51:53,47
-他没死，我就没罪 -警卫

1589
01:51:53,63 --> 01:51:55,79
-我没罪！ -抓住他
- I'm not guilty! - I don't care!

1590
01:51:55,97 --> 01:51:57,96
-再见了，大师 -安杰！
- Get hold of him. - Angier!

1591
01:52:02,71 --> 01:52:04,40
出去玩吧！
Run along now.

1592
01:52:05,38 --> 01:52:08,87
老爷，有位先生在等你
Sir, there's a gentleman waiting.

1593
01:52:24,73 --> 01:52:25,76
老天爷
- Dear God. - Hello, Cutter.

1594
01:52:26,57 --> 01:52:28,23
你好，柯特

1595
01:52:28,84 --> 01:52:30,74
你还活着
You're still alive.

1596
01:52:30,90 --> 01:52:32,67
你怎么会没死？
How is it you're still alive?

1597
01:52:32,84 --> 01:52:35,14
我看到你的尸体
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1598
01:52:38,41 --> 01:52:40,17
-孩子 -晚安，先生
- Child. - Good night, sir.

1599
01:52:40,35 --> 01:52:42,14
晚安，洁丝
Good night, Jess.

1600
01:52:43,65 --> 01:52:45,14
我见过她
I've seen her before.

1601
01:52:45,32 --> 01:52:50,62
她在法庭跟法隆在一起
I saw her in court with...

1602
01:52:48,71 --> 01:52:50,33
...Fallon.

1603
01:52:52,49 --> 01:52:54,98
-你做了什么？ -她需要有人照顾
- What have you done? - She needs looking after.

1604
01:52:55,16 --> 01:52:57,43
她需要她的父亲
She needs her father.

1605
01:52:57,83 --> 01:53:00,56
你害他被处死，我成了帮凶
You're letting him hang, and I helped you.

1606
01:53:00,73 --> 01:53:06,64
我是来求卡爵士让我毁了机器的
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine.

1607
01:53:07,17 --> 01:53:10,40
我再也不会求你做任何事了
I am not going to beg you for anything.

1608
01:53:10,58 --> 01:53:13,84
用不着，我再也不会使用它了
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure it is never used again.

1609
01:53:15,01 --> 01:53:19,25
那么，卡德洛爵士
Then, Lord Caldlow...

1610
01:53:20,75 --> 01:53:22,69
你要我把它运到哪里？
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1611
01:53:22,86 --> 01:53:24,22
我的剧院
My theater. It belongs with the prestige materials.

1612
01:53:24,39 --> 01:53:26,52
和其它道具放在一起

1613
01:53:27,16 --> 01:53:29,65
我试着不牵涉到你
John, I tried not to involve you.

1614
01:53:42,64 --> 01:53:44,51
所以…
So...

1615
01:53:46,85 --> 01:53:48,91
咱们俩要分道扬镖了
We go alone now.

1616
01:53:49,58 --> 01:53:51,45
咱们俩…
Both of us.

1617
01:53:54,89 --> 01:53:58,32
只是我不能活得像你一样久
I mean, I don't have as far to go as you.

1618
01:54:03,56 --> 01:54:05,22
不能
No.

1619
01:54:06,37 --> 01:54:09,73
你是对的，我不该去招惹他
You were right. I should have left him to his damn trick.

1620
01:54:11,27 --> 01:54:13,03
对不起
I'm sorry.

1621
01:54:14,81 --> 01:54:17,21
我对很多事都感到抱歉
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1622
01:54:18,34 --> 01:54:20,47
我对不起莎拉
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1623
01:54:22,18 --> 01:54:23,88
我不是要故意伤害她
Didn't mean to hurt her, I didn't.

1624
01:54:24,05 --> 01:54:25,98
我不是故意的

1625
01:54:27,55 --> 01:54:30,25
你要好好活下去，好吗？
You go live your life in full now, all right? You live for both of us.

1626
01:54:30,42 --> 01:54:31,95
替咱们俩活下去

1627
01:54:40,67 --> 01:54:42,23
永别了
Goodbye.

1628
01:55:28,51 --> 01:55:30,31
你在仔细看吗？
Are you watching closely?

1629
01:56:01,75 --> 01:56:03,77
放在这里
Put it down on the end.

1630
01:56:37,35 --> 01:56:41,51
想想你的伟大成就
Take a minute to consider your achievement.

1631
01:56:41,92 --> 01:56:47,05
我说过一个水手溺死的感觉
I once told you about a sailor

1632
01:56:44,81 --> 01:56:47,11
who described drowning to me.

1633
01:56:47,23 --> 01:56:49,32
你说他觉得就像回到家一样
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1634
01:56:50,36 --> 01:56:55,27
我说谎 他说痛苦至极
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1635
01:57:34,01 --> 01:57:35,98
艾佛波登
Alfred Borden, this day, in the name of the king

1636
01:57:36,38 --> 01:57:40,11
我以英王与最高法庭之名

1637
01:57:38,23 --> 01:57:40,22
and the High Court of England,

1638
01:57:40,28 --> 01:57:42,54
将你判处死刑
you will meet your end.

1639
01:57:44,22 --> 01:57:47,12
没人在乎消失的人
No one cares about the man in the box.

1640
01:57:51,19 --> 01:57:52,82
柯特？
Cutter?

1641
01:57:57,53 --> 01:57:59,12
柯特
Cutter!

1642
01:58:00,93 --> 01:58:04,33
你有什么遗言？
Do you have anything to say?

1643
01:58:07,87 --> 01:58:09,34
天灵灵地灵灵
Abracadabra.

1644
01:58:45,98 --> 01:58:47,45
你们是…
A brother? A twin?

1645
01:58:47,61 --> 01:58:48,60
双胞胎兄弟

1646
01:58:50,38 --> 01:58:55,69
你一直伪装成法隆？
You were Fallon.

1647
01:58:55,86 --> 01:58:56,98
不
- The whole time? - No.

1648
01:58:57,99 --> 01:59:00,39
我们都是法隆
We were both Fallon.

1649
01:59:00,56 --> 01:59:01,62
也都是波登
We were both Borden.

1650
01:59:07,77 --> 01:59:10,70
你是消失的…
Were you the one who went into the box?

1651
01:59:10,87 --> 01:59:12,67
还是现身的那个人？
Or the one who came back out?

1652
01:59:13,94 --> 01:59:16,03
我们会轮流
We took turns.

1653
01:59:20,91 --> 01:59:22,90
重点就在于我们互换身分
The trick is where we would swap.

1654
01:59:29,22 --> 01:59:33,68
柯特早就知道了 但我说这太简单，太容易了
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.

1655
01:59:31,18 --> 01:59:33,44
But I told him it was too simple, too easy.

1656
01:59:34,86 --> 01:59:36,49
不
No.

1657
01:59:37,23 --> 01:59:39,10
或许很简单，但是不容易
Simple, maybe, but not easy.

1658
01:59:39,50 --> 01:59:43,03
两个人共享一个生活并不容易
There's nothing easy about two men sharing one life.

1659
01:59:48,71 --> 01:59:50,87
我不懂，怎么又流血了？
I don't understand, how it can be bleeding again?

1660
01:59:55,88 --> 01:59:58,04
奥莉薇雅呢？你的妻子呢？
Wha... What about Olivia and your wife?

1661
01:59:58,99 --> 02:00:00,95
我们各有所爱
We each loved one of them.

1662
02:00:04,66 --> 02:00:06,68
我爱莎拉
I loved Sarah.

1663
02:00:07,73 --> 02:00:09,96
他爱奥莉薇雅
He loved Olivia.

1664
02:00:10,43 --> 02:00:15,56
我们各拥有一半的生活 这样对我们已经足够
We each had half of a full life,

1665
02:00:12,58 --> 02:00:15,58
really, which was enough for us...

1666
02:00:15,74 --> 02:00:17,50
只不过…
...just.

1667
02:00:19,27 --> 02:00:21,10
对她们却不够
But not for them.

1668
02:00:23,74 --> 02:00:28,44
自我牺牲才是精彩魔术的代价
See, sacrifice, Robert,

1669
02:00:25,90 --> 02:00:28,63
that's the price of a good trick.

1670
02:00:30,95 --> 02:00:33,71
但是你完全不能体会 不是吗？
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

1671
02:00:37,19 --> 02:00:38,49
我也做了牺牲
I've... I've made sacrifices.

1672
02:00:38,66 --> 02:00:40,42
-没有 -我有
- No. - Yes.

1673
02:00:41,03 --> 02:00:44,00
偷学别人不用花任何力气
It takes nothing to steal another man's work.

1674
02:00:45,20 --> 02:00:46,79
我尽了一切努力
Yeah, it takes everything.

1675
02:01:06,89 --> 02:01:09,91
不，等等，我是…
No, no, wait, I'm not...

1676
02:01:16,10 --> 02:01:18,19
这需要勇气
It took courage.

1677
02:01:20,40 --> 02:01:23,53
我每晚都要鼓起勇气走进机器
It took courage to climb into that machine every night,

1678
02:01:24,37 --> 02:01:29,33
不知道自己会消失不见…
not knowing...

1679
02:01:26,89 --> 02:01:29,02
...if I'd be the man in the box...

1680
02:01:32,28 --> 02:01:33,27
或是神奇现身
...or in the prestige.

1681
02:01:35,08 --> 02:01:39,71
你想看看我的代价吗？
Do you want to see...

1682
02:01:37,77 --> 02:01:40,07
...what it cost me?

1683
02:01:40,19 --> 02:01:43,31
你还没看过这地方吧？
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1684
02:01:43,92 --> 02:01:46,12
你看，你看
Look. Look.

1685
02:01:47,16 --> 02:01:49,22
我不在乎
I don't care.

1686
02:01:53,53 --> 02:01:56,16
你到了世界另一端
You went halfway around the world.

1687
02:01:57,17 --> 02:02:00,10
花了一大笔钱
You spent a fortune.

1688
02:02:01,97 --> 02:02:04,31
做出可怕的事
You did terrible things.

1689
02:02:05,44 --> 02:02:08,31
真正可怕的事
Really terrible things, Robert.

1690
02:02:10,05 --> 02:02:11,48
结果什么都没得到
And all for nothing.

1691
02:02:12,72 --> 02:02:15,41
-什么都没得到？ -对
For nothing?

1692
02:02:13,77 --> 02:02:15,10
Yeah.

1693
02:02:18,79 --> 02:02:23,56
你不懂我们为什么要变魔术
You never understood...

1694
02:02:21,48 --> 02:02:23,47
...why we did this.

1695
02:02:26,47 --> 02:02:29,73
观众知道真相
The audience knows the truth.

1696
02:02:30,34 --> 02:02:34,33
现实既残酷又悲惨
The world is simple.

1697
02:02:32,79 --> 02:02:34,52
It's miserable.

1698
02:02:34,59 --> 02:02:38,29
Solid... Solid all the way through.

1699
02:02:36,11 --> 02:02:38,60
没有奇迹，没有魔法

1700
02:02:40,55 --> 02:02:45,11
但是如果你能骗倒他们 即使只有一秒钟
But if you could fool them,

1701
02:02:43,03 --> 02:02:45,20
even for a second...

1702
02:02:46,69 --> 02:02:49,38
就能让他们惊叹
...then you could make them wonder.

1703
02:02:50,22 --> 02:02:52,05
然后你就能…
And then you...

1704
02:02:52,49 --> 02:02:56,95
然后你就能看到非常特别的事
Then you got to see something

1705
02:02:54,85 --> 02:02:56,51
very special.

1706
02:03:00,83 --> 02:03:03,10
你真的不知道吗？
You really don't know.

1707
02:03:06,77 --> 02:03:12,07
那就是观众脸上的表情
It was...

1708
02:03:09,16 --> 02:03:12,13
...it was the look on their faces.

1709
02:03:27,26 --> 02:03:32,25
每一场魔术表演都有三个步骤
<i>Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts.</i>

1710
02:03:35,53 --> 02:03:38,77
第一个步骤是“以虚代实”
<i>The first part is called "the pledge."</i>

1711
02:03:39,17 --> 02:03:41,83
魔术师先秀出一个真实的东西
<i>The magician shows you something ordinary.</i>

1712
02:03:43,01 --> 02:03:46,71
第二个步骤是“偷天换日”
<i>The second act is called "the turn."</i>

1713
02:03:46,98 --> 02:03:50,07
魔术师利用这个普通的东西
<i>The magician takes the ordinary something</i>

1714
02:03:50,25 --> 02:03:53,18
做出令人叹为观止的表演
<i>and makes it into something extraordinary.</i>

1715
02:03:54,49 --> 02:03:56,25
但是你还不会鼓掌
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear</i>

1716
02:03:56,42 --> 02:03:59,48
因为把东西变不见还不够

1717
02:03:58,54 --> 02:04:02,64
<i>isn't enough. You have to bring it back.</i>

1718
02:04:00,13 --> 02:04:03,62
你必须把它变回来

1719
02:04:07,37 --> 02:04:09,03
嘿！

1720
02:04:37,03 --> 02:04:40,09
现在你想找出秘诀
<i>Now you're looking for the secret.</i>

1721
02:04:42,37 --> 02:04:47,27
但是绝对找不到 因为你没真正在看
<i>But you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking.</i>

1722
02:04:49,28 --> 02:04:52,37
你并不是真的想知道
<i>You don't really want to work it out.</i>

1723
02:04:55,45 --> 02:04:57,75
你想要被骗
<i>You want to be fooled.</i>
