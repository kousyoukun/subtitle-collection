The Prestige
片名: 致命魔术

2
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:58,821
Are you watching closely?
你在仔细看吗?

3
00:01:05,798 --> 00:01:10,167
Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts.
每一场魔术表演都有三个步骤

4
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:13,699
The first part is called the PIedge.
第一个步骤是"以虚代实"

5
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:17,103
The magician shows you something ordinary...
魔术师秀出一个真实的东西

6
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:20,609
...a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.
一副牌 一只鸟或一个人

7
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:29,653
He shows you this object...
让你看这样东西

8
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:31,813
...perhaps he asks you to inspect it...
叫你检视它

9
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:35,619
...to see that it is, indeed, real.
看它的确是真的

10
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:38,922
Yeah, unaltered, normal.
平常的不得了

11
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:45,136
But of course, it probably isn't.
但是 其中一定有假

12
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:49,404
-  Where do you think you're going? - I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.
-  你想去哪里? - 我是表演的一部分 猪头

13
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:04,822
The second act is called the Turn.
第二个步骤是"偷天换日"

14
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:22,273
The magician takes the ordinary something...
魔术师利用这个普通的东西

15
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,076
...and makes it do something extraordinary.
做出令人叹为观止的表演

16
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:35,446
Now, you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it...
现在你很想找出秘诀 但是绝对找不到

17
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:38,920
...because, of course, you're not really Iooking.
因为你根本没有真正在看

18
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:41,185
You don't really wanna know.
你并不是真的想知道

19
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:46,795
You want to be fooIed.
你想要被骗

20
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,430
But you wouldn't clap yet...
但是你还不会鼓掌

21
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:55,196
...because making something disappear isn't enough.
因为把东西变不见还不够

22
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:59,140
You have to bring it back.
你必须把它变回来

23
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:04,142
That's why every magic trick has a third act.
所以魔术都有第三个步骤

24
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,874
The hardest part.
最难的部分

25
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:09,887
The part we call the Prestige.
我们称之为"化腐朽为神奇"

26
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,796
The Prestige. And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer...
化腐朽为神奇? 劳勃安杰 你的雇主丹顿大师

27
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,598
...get to that final part of his trick that night?
那晚有完成表演吗?

28
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,434
- No, sir. Something went wrong. - What went wrong?
- 并没有 出了状况 - 出了什么状况?

29
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:34,234
I saw someone making their way below stage.
我看到有个人跑到舞台下方

30
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,142
I followed him.
我跟踪他

31
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:39,546
It was Borden, watching Mr. Angier drown.
那是波登 眼睁睁看着安先生溺死

32
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:42,949
Would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter?
柯特先生 请向陪审团说明你的职业

33
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,213
I'm an engineer.
我是机关师

34
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:48,758
I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them.
设计魔术表演 打造需要的道具和机关

35
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:49,916
So, Mr. Cutter...
柯先生

36
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:53,258
...was this water-filled tank beneath the stage...
舞台下方的水箱

37
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,195
...part of Mr. Angier's illusion?
也是这个魔术的道具吗?

38
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:56,493
No, no. It was...
不 那是...

39
00:03:56,668 --> 00:04:00,798
The tank was brought on for the first trick and then taken off-stage.
水箱是第一个表演用的 然后就被搬下台

40
00:04:00,973 --> 00:04:04,170
Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the interval.
一定是波登把它移到机关门底下了

41
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,742
How large was this tank?
水箱有多大?

42
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:08,537
Oh, it's a normal tank for escape underwater,
表演水底脱逃的一般大小

43
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:10,507
about 4 or 500 gallons.
大约四 五百加仑吧

44
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,047
How do you think Mr. Borden...
波登怎么能一个人移动水箱

45
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:15,675
...was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing?
而没有让任何人发现?

46
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:17,617
He's a magician. Ask him.
他是魔术师 你去问他

47
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:22,351
I ask again that this man explain the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.
我要求你为我解释 安先生的魔术机关

48
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:24,017
The Real Transported Man...

49
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:27,165
...is one of the most sought-after illusions in this business.

50
00:04:27,332 --> 00:04:28,822
I have the right to sell it on.
出售秘诀的权利在我手中

51
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,595
If I reveal the method here, then the trick is worthless.
如果被揭穿就不值钱了

52
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,797
How can we know that the tank wasn't some part of the trick that went wrong?
我们怎么知道... 水箱不只是单纯出错?

53
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,633
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament...

54
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,074
...but Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.
但是这攸关波登的生死

55
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,381
If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private...
如果你私底下向我透露细节

56
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:47,109
...I might be able to judge their relevance to the case.
我就能对此案做出中肯的判决

57

Might this be an acceptable compromise?

I'm gonna have to ask you to turn out your pockets.

Not my idea, sir.

61
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:24,355

62
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:30,021
I told him the only way that Borden's gonna disappear...

...is if I leave him out there with the other inmates.

00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:29,691
Well, the peak is closed, sir, for scientific experimentation.
山顶关闭了 为了科学实验

Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.
我知道 这就是我来的目的

115
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:47,716
You'll have to walk the rest, I'm afraid, sir.
先生 接下来您得自己走路了

116
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:28,589
I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can't read my sign.
令人惊讶 你们记者都看不懂我的标志吗?

117
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,489
Not the welcome I was expecting.

118
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,497
I know you.
我认得你

119
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:49,039
You're the Great Danton. I saw your show in London seven times.
你是魔术大师丹顿 我在伦敦看了你七场表演

120
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:53,514
You guessed every object the audience had in their pockets.

121
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:55,050
I'm Alley.

122
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,688
Sorry about the fence. People interfere with our work.
围栏的事真抱歉 太多人来干扰

123
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,381
- I've come to see Tesla. - Why?

124
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:04,426
He made a machine for a colleague of mine sometime ago.

125
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:08,088

I brought a lot of money.

I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

I simply can't help you.

I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely.

130
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:24,709
Hey, what am I holding?

131
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,880
Your watch.
你的怀表

132
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:35,178

describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.

That was just days after he first met me.
那时我们才刚认识

135
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:46,428
We were two young men at the start of a great career.
当时我们都是刚出道的魔术师

136
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:49,129
Two young men devoted to an illusion.

137
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,468
Two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.

Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

If you would tie her wrists.

140
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:15,430
Bind her feet around the ankle.

Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

142
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,464
- No. - No.
- 不是 - 不是

143
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:23,772
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.
我想你们打的结应该都很紧

144
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:30,137
He's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring.
他太自满 毫无创意 又无趣

145
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,902
I mean, Milton has gotten success, whatever that means...
米尔顿很成功

146
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:35,841
...and now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all.
但现在他很没种 不敢再冒任何风险

147
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,744
I mean, he's squandering the goodwill of the audience...
他耍二流把戏

00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,852
- ...with tired, second-rate tricks. - They're old favorites.
- 糟蹋观众的热情 - 大家爱看这些把戏

149
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,703
Favorites? Give me something fresh.
拜托 让我试些新魔术吧

150
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:45,387
He won't even try a bullet catch.
他甚至不敢尝试"接子弹"

151
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,149
A bullet catch is suicide.
"接子弹"是自杀

152
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:51,227
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.
要是志愿者放钮扣进去就死定了

153
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,762
- Fine. Use a plant. - You can't for every trick.
- 那就用暗桩 - 不能每个魔术都用暗桩

154
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:56,730
- There'd be no seats left for the punters. - No bullet catch.
- 不然客人就没位置坐了 - 好吧 不表演"接子弹"

155
00:13:56,901 --> 00:14:01,270
Whatever. The point is that a real magician tries to invent something new...
重点是好魔术师会不断创新戏法

156
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:04,203
...that other magicians are gonna scratch their heads over.
让其他魔术师想破脑袋

157
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,536
And then you sell it to him for a small fortune.
然后你就能靠它小赚一笔

158
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,710
I suppose you have such a trick.
我猜你有惊人绝技?

159
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,315
- Actually, I do. - Would you care to sell it to me?
- 没错 - 你能卖给我吗?

160
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:14,007
No. No one else could do my trick.
不行 只有我做得到

161
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,210
- Any trick can be duplicated, right? - Wrong.
- 每个魔术都能被模仿 对吧? - 错了

162
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:19,288
If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece...
如果波登发明了他的杰作

163
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:21,618
...it might be only he's prepared to do it.
大概只有他有办法演出

164
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:24,154
Milton is a great showman, but Borden is right.
米尔顿很会作秀 但波登说得对

165
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:25,887
He won't get his hands dirty.
米尔顿不肯冒险

166
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:30,461
If you wanna see what it takes to make real magic, go to the Tenley.
想看真正的魔术就去天利剧院

167
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:33,331
There's a Chinaman there, and he really has what it takes.
有位中国魔术师很厉害

168
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,734
- Chung Ling Soo. - Pricey. I can't afford that.
- 他叫钟林苏 - 门票太贵 我看不起

169
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,465
I know the bloke on the door.

170
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:39,940
You two go and see that show...

171
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:42,011
...and whichever one of you can tell me...
谁看出他的金鱼缸戏法窍门

172
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,045
...how he does the goldfish-bowl trick...
就有奖赏

173
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,346
- Which is? - Ten minutes on-stage...
- 什么奖赏?  - 在我的老朋友艾克曼面前

174
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:49,315
...with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.
试演一段魔术

175
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:50,818
- Really? - Who's Ackerman?
- 真的假的?  - 艾克曼是谁?

176
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:53,082
The top theatrical agent in London.
伦敦的顶尖经纪人

177
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,186
I saw you drop the knot again.
我看到你绳结没打好

178
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:59,694
- I think I turned my wrist. - Some nights, you just don't get it, do you?
- 我的手腕动了一下 - 你一直没搞懂 是吧?

179
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:03,823
I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break a leg.
要是绳结松掉 茱莉亚就会摔断腿

180
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:08,336
It's the wrong knot. Like I said, the Langford double will hold tighter.
你教的绳结有问题 我说过 蓝氏结比较牢固

181
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:12,101
The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous.
蓝氏结不能碰到水 太危险了

182
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:14,370
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.
要是绳子膨胀她就无法松绑

183
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,673
- I can slip a Langford underwater. - She can slip it. We'll practice.
- 我可以在水底松脱蓝氏结 - 她做得到 可以练习

184
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:19,180
Hey, Borden, he said no.
波登 他说不行

185
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,682
Yeah, well, you know knots better than me, do you?
你对绳结懂得比我多吗?

186
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,753
Listen, no more mistakes.

187
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,520
All right. Yeah, do you? You wanna take over?
是吗? 你想取代我?

188
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:29,489
- Just leave it. - I didn't think so.
- 你走吧 - 想都别想

189
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:36,562
- Hey, Cutter, where's he from? - Where are you from?
- 柯特 他打哪儿来的?  - 你打哪儿来的?

190
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:38,946
- He shifts props for virgil at the hall.
- 他以前帮魔术师佛吉搬道具

191
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:41,000
- Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?
- 你不担心他偷学你的魔术?

192
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:43,470
- He doesn't deal in methods. - How do you know?
- 他只想创造全新魔术 - 你怎么知道?

193
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:48,738
Because I hired him to find out how virgil does the orange trick.
我雇他去偷学佛吉的柳橙戏法

194
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,245
- Well, I don't trust him. - He's a natural magician.
- 我不信任他 - 他是天生魔术师

195
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,849
Of course you can't trust him.
当然不能信任

196
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,743
I think he's all right.
我觉得波登没问题

197
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,251
- You think everyone's all right. - Even you.
- 你觉得大家都没问题 - 连你也一样

198
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:58,830
Watch your sightlines.
安杰 注意一点

199
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,119
If I can see you kissing your wife's leg every night...
就连我都看得到你亲老婆的腿

200
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,817
...so can the blokes at the ends of row three and four.
前排的观众一定也看得到

201
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,395
- You're wrong. It can't be. - No, it is.
- 你错了 不可能 - 错不了

202
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:42,021
- Look at the man. - This is the trick.
- 你看看他 - 这就是他的秘诀

203
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,728
This is a performance right here. This is why no one can detect his method.
这是他的表演 难怪没人看穿他的秘密

204
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,106
Total devotion to his art.
他对魔术完全奉献

205
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:55,271
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?
彻底自我牺牲 你懂吗?

206
00:16:55,446 --> 00:17:01,043
It's the only way to escape all this, you know.
这是扬名立万的唯一方法

207
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,210
All right.
好吧

208
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:08,325
I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water.
这很难夹起来 而且还没有装水

209
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,992
Or fish. Look.
也没有金鱼 你看

210
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:14,290
I don't know. Hang on a second.
我不确定行不行 等一下

211
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:19,396
He must be strong as an ox.
他一定壮得跟条牛一样

212
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:24,503
He's been pretending to be a cripple for years.
这么多年来他一直假装跛脚?

213
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,939
Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.
每次他出门面对大众都得装

214
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,248
Borden saw it at once, but I couldn't fathom it.
有一次波登看到他露出马脚 我没办法这样

215
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,010
Living my whole life pretending to be someone else.
很难想像花一辈子去假装别人

216
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:37,848
- You're pretending to be someone else. - I don't think changing a name compares.
- 你是在假装啊! - 换个名字并不算吧

217
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:40,490
Not just your name. Who you are and where you're from.
你也换了身分和来历

218
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:44,890
I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors.
因为我答应不能败坏家人名声

219
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,291
I thought of a name for you.
我帮你想到一个艺名

220
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,702
The Great Danton.
魔术大师丹顿

221
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:54,326
Do you like it?
你喜欢吗?

222
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,670
- But it's sophisticated. - It's French.
- 这名字很炫 - 那是法国人名

223
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:07,806
Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic.
波登觉得只有他了解魔术的本质

224
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:16,525
But what does he know of self-sacrifice?
但是他不了解自我牺牲

225
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:23,532
You bloody fool.
你这笨蛋

226
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:53,496
- He killed it. - What?
- 他杀了小鸟 - 怎么了?

227
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:54,653
What's wrong?
怎么了?

228
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:57,494
- He killed it. - I'm sure he didn't.
- 小鸟死了 - 没有啦

229
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:04,265
See? Look, now he'll bring it back.

No, he killed it.

00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,756
Look. See? He's all right. He's fine.
看到没? 他没事 他很好

233
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:24,918
- Look at him. - But where's his brother?
- 看到没?  - 那他的兄弟呢?

234
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,824
He's a sharp lad, your son.
你儿子真是聪明

235
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:33,562
Oh, he's my nephew.
他是我外甥

236
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,877
You're the lucky one today.
算你今天走运

237
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,763
Are you watching closely?
你在仔细看吗?

238
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:08,962
Look closer.
看清楚了

239
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,772
Never show anyone.
绝对不要揭穿谜底

240
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:18,579

You understand? Nothing.

243
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:29,283

So I could use a cup of tea.

You think that's...? Is that enough to keep me out?
你以为这样我就进不去?

249
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:57,347

257
00:21:57,014 --> 00:22:01,383
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens with these things after the trial?
法官大人 这些道具会怎么处理?

258
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:03,281
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

259
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:06,252

- 为什么?  - 太危险了

262

I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's got a simple and disappointing trick.
它只是造型很炫 但功能很简单

263
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:19,435
Most disappointing of all, sir...

264
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:22,963
...it has no trick.

265
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:26,709
It's real.

This is the tank Angier drowned in? Yes.
- 这就是淹死安杰的水箱?  - 是的

What a way to kill someone.

They're magicians, Your Honor. Showmen.
他们是魔术师 法官大人 表演者...

I can recognize an obsession.

No good will come of it.

643
00:51:42,498 --> 00:51:44,295
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?
你自己着了魔也没好事吗?

644
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:47,561
At first. But I have followed them too long.
一开始有 但我沉迷太久了

645
00:51:47,736 --> 00:51:53,174
I am their slave, and one day, they will choose to destroy me.
我成了它的奴隶 总有一天 它们会毁了我

646
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:58,543
If you understand an obsession, then you know you won't change my mind.
既然着了魔 那你就该知道我不会改变心意

647
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:00,871
So be it.

Will you build it?

I have already begun to build it, Mr. Angier.

650
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:10,789
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

651
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:13,291
This will take some time.

I thought you'd gone.

I don't really have anywhere to go.

654

You've been sleeping here?
你都睡在这里?

655
00:52:46,628 --> 00:52:51,031
Cutter said it would be all right till we get another booking. What are you doing?
柯特说我可以睡在这里 你在做什么?

656
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:53,432
Research.
做研究

657
00:52:53,602 --> 00:52:58,039
Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions...
魔术师得刺探对手表演什么...

658
00:52:58,207 --> 00:53:00,971
You're going to do something to that man, aren't you?
你打算对付他 对吧?

659
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:02,940
Cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.

He says if Borden thinks things are even between you two...

My wife for a couple of his fingers?
他用手指换我太太的命?

He has a family now, right? And he's performing again.
他现在有家有室又能上台表演

664
00:53:13,655 --> 00:53:17,386

波登假装没事发生 继续过着日子

665

And look at... Look at me, all right?

- 我孤家寡人 没戏院要请我表演 - 是我们

You're going to need a better disguise.
你需要更好的伪装

668

Need a volunteer.

Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

Just a rubber ball, no.

676
00:54:06,842 --> 00:54:07,866
It's magic.
它有魔力

He had a new trick.

Did they appIaud when you saw it?

The trick was too good, it was too simple.

- The audience hardly had time to see it. - He's a dreadful magician.
- 观众根本来不及看得懂 - 他是个糟糕的魔术师

683
00:54:46,315 --> 00:54:48,840
No, he's a wonderful magician. He's a dreadful showman.
不 他是很厉害的魔术师 只是一个糟糕的表演者

685
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,047

- 那他到底怎么变的?  - 他使用替身

686
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:55,815
No, no, no, it's too simple. This is a complex illusion.
太简单了 一定更复杂

687
00:54:55,991 --> 00:54:58,391
You only say that because you don't know the method.
你不知道窍门才会这么说

688
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,721
It's a double at the end. It's the only way.
后来现身的是替身 就是这样

689
00:55:00,896 --> 00:55:03,057
I've seen him perform the trick three times now.

The same man comes out of that second cabinet.

...but if you look closely you can tell.
仔细看就看得出来

695
00:55:18,046 --> 00:55:20,674
He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience, but I do.

696

他毁了我一生 我就偷他的戏法

- 我们要找个很像你的人 - 他没有用替身

Robert, I don't know how Borden does the trick, so either...
劳勃 我不知道波登的手法

701
00:55:35,931 --> 00:55:39,298
You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret...
你要不就等他退休向他买秘诀

702
00:55:39,468 --> 00:55:41,231
...or you listen to how I would do it.
或是听我解释要怎么表演

703
00:55:41,403 --> 00:55:46,306
And the only way that I know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double.
我知道唯一的手段就是用替身

704
00:55:47,242 --> 00:55:48,869
All right.

扮你这丹顿大师能有多难?

774
01:01:10,932 --> 01:01:13,560
The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.
经理说他没看过这种热烈反应

775
01:01:13,735 --> 01:01:16,966
At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.
至少他看到了 我只能躲在台下

776
01:01:17,138 --> 01:01:19,504
No one cares about the man who disappears into the box.
观众才懒得管消失的人

777
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:21,437
They care about the one who comes out.
他们只在乎现身的大师

778
01:01:21,609 --> 01:01:24,578
- I care about the man in the box. - Thank you.
- 我就关心消失的人 - 谢谢你

779
01:01:24,746 --> 01:01:27,943
I don't know. Maybe... Maybe we could switch before the trick.
也许我们能换过来

780
01:01:28,116 --> 01:01:30,209
I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below.
由我来现身 让路特跳到舞台底下

781
01:01:30,385 --> 01:01:33,115
No, the anticipation of the trick is everything.
不行 观众的期望最重要

782
01:01:33,288 --> 01:01:36,314
We need your showmanship to build up the suspense.
你的舞台魅力才能营造张力

783
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:39,756
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over. He can't introduce this trick.
他一开口就完了 没办法表演

784
01:01:39,928 --> 01:01:42,761
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.
我当然行 我是丹顿大师

785
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:46,423
Root, you bloody fool. Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.
你这猪头 把这身装扮脱掉

786
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:49,126
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.
随时都可能有人经过

787
01:01:49,304 --> 01:01:51,295
Congratulations, all.
恭喜了 各位

788
01:01:51,473 --> 01:01:55,034
Life is not full of these moments, Robbie. We worked hard.
成功不是偶然的 我们很努力

789
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:56,802
We need to celebrate properly.
我们要好好庆祝

790
01:02:00,482 --> 01:02:03,007
What's wrong? ls it your wife?
怎么了? 想起你太太?

791
01:02:03,184 --> 01:02:05,414
No. No, it's the trick. lt isn't good enough.
不是 这魔术还不够好

792
01:02:05,587 --> 01:02:08,784
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He has no style.
波登比不上我们 他没有格调

793
01:02:08,957 --> 01:02:12,791
Well, he doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage.
他最后不必躲在舞台底下

794
01:02:12,961 --> 01:02:14,656
I need to know how he does it.
我要知道他的做法

795
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:18,196
- Why? - So I can do it better.
- 为什么?  - 这样我就可以做得更好

796
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:22,802
I need you to go and work for him.
我要你去当他的助手

797
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,601
Work for him? Are you joking?
当他助手? 你在开玩笑?

798
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,036
You'll be my spy.
你得当我的间谍

799
01:02:30,211 --> 01:02:32,270
We just got our start. You want me to leave?
我们才刚成功 你就要我走?

800
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,472
That's how we advance. Think of it, Olivia.
这样才能进步 想想看

801
01:02:34,649 --> 01:02:38,278
We got people excited, but imagine what we could do with the real illusion.
柯特的技俩已经让观众兴奋了 用正版魔术岂不更受欢迎

802
01:02:38,453 --> 01:02:42,287
We'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.
这将是前所未见的伟大魔术

803
01:02:42,457 --> 01:02:43,856
He knows I work for you.
他知道我是你的助手

804
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:47,290
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you. He'll want my secret.
他才会用你来打探我的秘诀

805
01:02:47,462 --> 01:02:51,523
- Why would he trust me? - Because you're gonna tell him the truth.
- 他凭什么信任我?  - 因为你要告诉他真相

806
01:03:03,912 --> 01:03:04,901
Good girl.
乖女孩

807
01:03:08,149 --> 01:03:11,645
You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.
你一定想知道 花大钱买到的是什么

808
01:03:12,287 --> 01:03:15,154
It's fitting you should be here for maiden voyage.
你正好来目睹我们的处女秀

809
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:17,018
Your hat.
你的高帽

810
01:03:24,732 --> 01:03:27,394
You might wanna stand back.
你最好退后一点

811
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,212
I don't understand.
我不明白

812
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,688
Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it.
让我们来处理就好了

813
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,987
- Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla? - No, no, no.
- 有问题吗 泰斯拉?  - 没有

814
01:03:54,162 --> 01:03:55,686
- Come back next week. - Next week?
- 下星期再回来 - 下星期?

815
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:57,957
- Come back... Next week, it'll be fine. - Tesla.
下星期就没问题

816
01:03:58,132 --> 01:04:00,896
She's just a little temperamental sometimes.
机器有时候也会闹脾气

817
01:04:05,807 --> 01:04:08,605
- Interesting workshop. - Yeah, we make do.
- 很不错的工作室 - 我们尽力了

818
01:04:08,776 --> 01:04:11,108
- My name is Olivia Wenscombe... - I know who you are.
- 我是奥莉薇雅 - 我知道

819
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:12,576
You here to steal my show?
你来偷我的秘诀?

820
01:04:12,747 --> 01:04:14,544
I'm here to give it what it's missing.
我有你缺少的东西

821
01:04:14,716 --> 01:04:17,879
- Yeah? What might that be? - Me.
- 我缺少什么?  - 我

822
01:04:19,454 --> 01:04:23,390
I was just saying that, wasn't I, Bernard? Woman's touch.
我刚才正在说... 我们需要女性魅力

823
01:04:23,558 --> 01:04:25,389
- I've left Angier. - All right.
我离开安杰

824
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,290
- I want a job. - Yeah?
需要工作

825
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:31,432
- I know you've no reason to trust me... - Why wouldn't I trust you?
- 我知道你一定不信任我 - 我为什么不信任你?

826
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,467
I mean, you're only the mistress of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?
你是我敌手的情人 当然能信任

827
01:04:37,038 --> 01:04:38,938
- Mr. Borden... - Alfred.
- 波登先生 - 艾佛

828
01:04:41,376 --> 01:04:43,000
I'm going to tell you the truth.
我要告诉你事实

829
01:04:43,111 --> 01:04:46,274
Now that is a slippery notion in our line of work...
干我们这行 没有所谓的事实

830
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:47,744
...isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?
不是吗? 温小姐

831
01:04:49,884 --> 01:04:52,444
I am here because he sent me here.
我会来这里 是安杰派我来的

832
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:55,088
He wants me to work for you and steal your secret.
他要我替你工作 偷你的秘诀

833
01:04:55,256 --> 01:04:56,917
What does he need my secret for?
为什么?

834
01:04:57,091 --> 01:04:58,490
His trick is top-notch.
他的魔术算顶尖了

835
01:04:59,093 --> 01:05:02,324
He vanishes and then he reappears on the other side of the stage...
他消失后立刻出现在舞台另一边

836
01:05:02,497 --> 01:05:06,331
...mute, overweight and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.
痴肥又不开口 而且喝得烂醉

837
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:08,162
It's astonishing. How does he do it?
不过还是很棒 何必偷我的?

838
01:05:08,603 --> 01:05:13,472
And tell me, Olivia, does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?
告诉我 他喜欢躲在台下吗?

839
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:14,665
No, it's killing him.
他快抓狂了

840
01:05:14,842 --> 01:05:16,833
He's obsessed with discovering your methods.
他像着了魔似的

841
01:05:17,011 --> 01:05:18,205
He thinks of nothing else.
只想知道你的手法

842
01:05:18,379 --> 01:05:21,439
He takes no pleasure in our success, and I've had enough.
表演成功还不满足 我受够了

843
01:05:21,616 --> 01:05:23,049
There is no future with him.
跟他在一起没有未来

844
01:05:25,253 --> 01:05:28,882
He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
他派我来偷你的秘诀 我来告诉你他的秘密

845
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:32,951
This is the truth, is it?
这是实话吗?

846
01:05:37,465 --> 01:05:39,160
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.
你赶快把衣服穿好

847
01:05:39,334 --> 01:05:41,564
Root, you're late and more drunk than usual.
你迟到了 而且比平常更醉

848
01:05:41,736 --> 01:05:44,364
- Now, get down below stairs right away. - No.
- 立刻给我躲进舞台下面 - 不

849
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:49,034
No, we need to have a little chat, Mr. Cutter.
我们得聊一聊 柯特先生

850
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,234
We have a problem.
麻烦大了

851
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:52,971
Cutter, Borden is performing right across the street.
波登就在对街表演

852
01:05:53,147 --> 01:05:55,775
Yeah? We have a bigger problem.
这里的问题更大

853
01:05:56,918 --> 01:05:59,853
Root. He's realized he can make demands.
路特他发现他可以狮子大开口

854
01:06:00,722 --> 01:06:02,019
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?
他要勒索我们?

855
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:06,354
I was surprised, to tell you the truth. It usually takes them longer to figure it out.
我倒是很惊讶 这种人通常过很久才会想通

856
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:09,325
- Well, how much does he want? - Well, it makes no difference.
- 他要多少?  - 没差啦

857
01:06:09,497 --> 01:06:12,898
- We gotta stop doing the trick. - Stop the trick? Cutter, look at this.
- 我们得暂停演出 - 暂停演出? 你看看

858
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:15,194
Well, look at yesterday's, look at last week...
你看看上礼拜的报纸

859
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:18,737
...where they said you were the premier stage performer in London.
他们说你是伦敦首席表演家

860
01:06:18,906 --> 01:06:20,464
Not magician, mind you.
不是魔术师

861
01:06:20,642 --> 01:06:23,236
- Performer of any kind. - Well, what's your point?
- 而是表演家 - 你想说什么?

862
01:06:23,411 --> 01:06:25,675
My point is, Robert, is you've climbed too high...
你成名太快

863
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:28,042
...to get away with professional embarrassment.
不能出纰漏

864
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,448
We don't do any tricks we can't control.
最好别表演无法掌控的魔术

865
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,447
Just pay him whatever he wants for now.
他想要多少都给他

866
01:06:35,623 --> 01:06:39,024
We keep doing the trick until Borden opens and then we'll phase it out.
继续表演 直到波登开幕 我们再喊停

867
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:41,561
All right.
好吧

868
01:06:44,265 --> 01:06:48,258
Cutter was aIways surprised how fast Root turned bad.
柯特很惊讶路特这么快就造反

869
01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:52,829
To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?
我何德何能被你请喝啤酒?

870
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:56,374
You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
你是丹顿大师 对吧?

871
01:06:56,544 --> 01:06:59,877
Of course I am, but don't advertise it because I'll be mobbed with fans.
当然 别声张 我怕被骚扰

872
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:01,948
We paid him enough to keep him in beers...
我们给他钱喝酒

873
01:07:02,116 --> 01:07:04,243
...so you wouldn't expect him to rock the boat.
以防他扯后腿

874
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:06,979
Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique.
各位可能看过这个魔术

875
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:10,784
But for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed...
没看过的人不要紧张

876
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:13,984
...what you're about to see is considered safe.
这个魔术很安全

877
01:07:14,162 --> 01:07:15,459
And who are you?
你是谁?

878
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:21,466
I am a humble admirer and a fellow practitioner.
我是个仰慕者 也是魔术师

879
01:07:21,636 --> 01:07:22,796
very good.
非常好

880
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,976
- Another? - Oh, if you insist.
- 再来一杯?  - 如果你要请客

881
01:07:35,149 --> 01:07:37,049
- Another. - I'm not performing tonight.
- 再来一杯 - 我今晚没有演出

882
01:07:37,218 --> 01:07:38,947
Well, I'm only doing one show...
我只负责表演

883
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,317
...but to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days.
一切都由其他人安排

884
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:43,582
Get up there!
给我上去

885
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:46,048
Get up!
上去

886
01:07:46,227 --> 01:07:48,388
Your illusion, The Transported Man...
你的移形遁影术

887
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:51,532
...I'm not claiming to know your methods or anything...
我并不知道个中秘密

888
01:07:52,233 --> 01:07:58,695
...but I had a similar trick in my act, and I used a double.
但是我以前也有类似的表演 而且 我用一个替身

889
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:01,200
I see. very good.
我懂了 很好

890
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,935
Well, it was, and then it went bad.
结果出了麻烦

891
01:08:04,112 --> 01:08:09,516
What I didn't count on, was that when I incorporated this bloke into my act...
我没料到替身竟然喧宝夺主

892
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:11,652
...he had complete power over me.
把我的光彩全部夺走

893
01:08:12,987 --> 01:08:14,454
Complete power, you say.
完全夺走?

894
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:37,204
Be very careful giving someone that power over you.
千万别让别人夺走你的光彩

895
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,648
Well, thank you.
谢谢你

896
01:08:41,816 --> 01:08:43,977
Yes, thank you for the warning.
谢谢你的忠告

897
01:08:46,154 --> 01:08:48,145
Cheers.
干杯

898
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,881
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.
下一个表演并不是魔术

899
01:08:51,058 --> 01:08:55,256
What you're about to see is considered safe.
不过这个表演很安全

900
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:37,464
The Great Danton.
伟大的丹顿大师

901
01:09:43,845 --> 01:09:45,506
I apologize.
我在此致歉

902
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,411
There simply is too much magic...
我在对街的表演太精彩

903
01:09:49,584 --> 01:09:54,578
...for my stage at the Pantages across the street.
不小心把自己变到这里来

904
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:58,491

It takes a bit for me to get around these days.

- 波登当然这么说 - 他什么都没说

我看到化妆 眼镜 假发 我们没用到 不过都藏在后台

That's who he is! That's what it takes!

He lives his act! Don't you see?

Olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:27,377
His assistant came to us with a proposition.
他的女助手来找我

1038
01:20:28,188 --> 01:20:31,453
Obviously, Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much.
安杰派她来 承认自己卧底

1039
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:34,355
Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?
他喜欢躲在台下吗?

1040
01:20:34,528 --> 01:20:38,191
He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
他派我来偷你秘诀 我来告诉你他的秘密

1041
01:20:38,699 --> 01:20:42,260
This is the truth, is it?
这是实话吗?

1042
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:53,709
No, that's what he told me to tell you. The truth...
不 这是他叫我说的

1043
01:20:53,881 --> 01:20:57,681
...is that I loved him, and I stood by him, and he sent me to you...
其实我是爱他的 一直在帮他

1044
01:20:57,851 --> 01:21:01,218
...Iike he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts.
但是他把我当跑腿小妹派我来

1045
01:21:01,388 --> 01:21:04,050
I hate him for that.
我恨他这样对我

1046
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:08,225
I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater.
我从大老远就看出安杰的手法

1047
01:21:09,396 --> 01:21:11,421
So, what could you possibly have to offer me?
你能给我什么?

1048
01:21:11,932 --> 01:21:14,696
You know how he does his tricks, but you can't understand...
你或许知道他的手法 但是你不懂

1049
01:21:14,868 --> 01:21:17,336
...why no one can see yours are better. You hide this.
大家看不出你比较厉害 你把断指包起来

1050
01:21:17,504 --> 01:21:21,440
I had to look very closely to spot it when you were performing The Transported Man...
我要很仔细看才看得出来

1051
01:21:21,608 --> 01:21:24,236
...but this makes you unique.
不过这是你的优势

1052
01:21:24,411 --> 01:21:26,572
It shows the audience you aren't using a double.
这代表你没有用替身

1053
01:21:26,747 --> 01:21:28,840
You mustn't hide it, display it proudly.
别把手包起来 要大方秀出来

1054
01:21:29,016 --> 01:21:33,282
I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.
你只用一只手变魔术一定很厉害

1055
01:21:33,754 --> 01:21:35,779
Yeah, it does.
对 没错

1056
01:21:37,324 --> 01:21:39,884
So let people know.
你要让大家知道

1057
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:44,288
You could be so much more than he is, and I can show you how.
你比他高杆 我可以教你怎么成名

1058
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:47,595
I think she's telling the truth.
我想她说的是真话

1059
01:21:48,468 --> 01:21:50,595
I think we cannot trust her.
不过我们不能信任她

1060
01:21:54,308 --> 01:21:56,606
But I love her. I need her.
但是我爱她 也需要她

1061
01:21:57,911 --> 01:22:00,971
To open myself to such a relationship...

...to the dangers of such an affair...

1063

1064
01:22:10,991 --> 01:22:12,481
But how to be sure?
该怎么确信呢?

1065
01:22:14,895 --> 01:22:19,127
I know a way. It's the only way to know her mind.
我有个方法 那是了解她心意的唯一方法

1066
01:22:19,299 --> 01:22:20,960
How could he send you away?
他怎么舍得让你离开?

1067
01:22:22,836 --> 01:22:24,701
She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.
她必须帮我们除掉安杰

1068
01:22:32,646 --> 01:22:35,444
Today, my mistress proves her truthfuIness.
今天我的情妇证明了她的真心

1069
01:22:35,616 --> 01:22:37,914
Not to me, you understand.
不是向我证明

1070
01:22:38,085 --> 01:22:40,053
I've been convinced since she led me to Root.

1073
01:22:48,261 --> 01:22:50,559
She gave you this notebook at my request.
是我要她把笔记交给你

1074
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:55,896
And, yes, "Tesla " is merely the key to my diary, not to my trick.
"泰斯拉"只是关键字 不是秘诀

1075
01:22:56,069 --> 01:23:00,597
Did you really think I'd part with my secret so easily after so much?
你以为我会轻易把秘诀给你?

1076
01:23:00,774 --> 01:23:02,002
Goodbye, Angier.

1077
01:23:02,175 --> 01:23:06,271
May you find solace for your thwarted ambition back in your American home.

1078
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:17,500
Tesla!

01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:22,157
Tesla! Alley! Alley!
泰斯拉... 艾利 艾利...

1080

Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.
泰斯拉根本没打造我要的机器

1081
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:29,430
- We never said he had. - But you let me believe that he had.
- 我们没说他有啊 - 但你让我认为他有

1082
01:23:29,603 --> 01:23:32,231
You stole my money because your funding had been cut off.
你们资金用完 所以骗我的钱

1083
01:23:32,406 --> 01:23:36,172
You've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along...
拿我的高帽做实验 一边嘲笑我

1084
01:23:36,343 --> 01:23:38,811
...while using my money to stave off ruin.
一边拿我的钱来花

1085
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,777
- Now, I have seen Edison's men. - Where?
- 我看到爱迪生的人 - 在哪里?

1086
01:23:41,948 --> 01:23:44,917
In the hotel. And I have every mind to bring them up here myself.
旅馆 我大可以把他们带来

1087
01:23:45,085 --> 01:23:47,110
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.
这么做很不明智 安杰

1088
01:23:47,287 --> 01:23:50,313
It is true that you are our last remaining financier...

...but we have not stolen your money.

1090

Sir, my cat.

1091
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,929
When I told you I could make your machine, I spoke a simple truth.
我说能做出你要的机器是实话

1092
01:23:57,097 --> 01:24:00,498
- Then why isn't the machine working? - Because exact science, Mr. Angier...
- 那机器为什么没有用?  - 科学不是绝对

1093
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:01,964
...is not an exact science.
它充满变数

1094
01:24:02,135 --> 01:24:05,229
The machine simply does not operate as expected.
机器不一定能正常运作

1095
01:24:05,405 --> 01:24:07,669
It requires further examination.
需要进行更多实验

1096
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:10,435
- So where did my top hat go? - Nowhere.
- 我的高帽在哪里?  - 就在这里

1097
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:13,374
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.
试了十几次

1098
01:24:13,547 --> 01:24:14,878
The hat went nowhere.
帽子一直在这里

1099
01:24:15,048 --> 01:24:16,982
We need to try different material.

1100
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:20,813
It may provoke a different result.
才可能有不同的结果

1101
01:24:21,755 --> 01:24:23,416
Copernicus, come on.
猫咪 过来

1102
01:24:30,597 --> 01:24:35,091
You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, doctor.
我的猫出了事你要负责 博士

1103
01:24:56,189 --> 01:24:59,852
I hope that whatever you were really doing with my money was more worthwhile...
我只希望我的钱花得很值得

1104
01:25:00,026 --> 01:25:01,960
...Mr. Tesla.
泰斯拉先生

1105
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,072
Alley!
艾利

1106
01:26:01,488 --> 01:26:02,716
So the machine was working.
机器真的有用

1107
01:26:02,889 --> 01:26:06,416
I never bothered to check the calibration because the hat never moved.
我没去检查 因为帽子都没动

1108
01:26:06,593 --> 01:26:09,653
These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier.
事情总是很难如你所愿

1109
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:11,991
That's one of the principal beauties of science.
这也是科学原则

1110
01:26:12,165 --> 01:26:15,532
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine.
我要花几个星期解决问题

1111
01:26:15,702 --> 01:26:17,897
We'll send word when it's ready.

Don't forget your hat.

- 哪一顶是我的?  - 都是你的 安杰先生

You look so pretty in this new dress of yours.
你穿这件新衣服好漂亮哦

- 我们要去动物园吗?  - 爸爸有别的事情要办

Then go to the zoo we shall.

我先去办事 马上就回来

01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:58,234
What are you doing?
你在做什么?

1122
01:27:01,915 --> 01:27:04,907
We each of us have our vices.
我们各自有沉迷的事情

1123
01:27:07,954 --> 01:27:11,720
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1124
01:27:11,892 --> 01:27:15,487
...your only competition for my affections is our little girl.

- You mean it today. - Absolutely.

1127

Which makes it so much harder when you don't.
当你骗我会让我更痛苦

1128
01:27:39,052 --> 01:27:41,782
Is that more shopping? She does love the smell of money.
又要买东西?  她真是爱钱

1129
01:27:41,955 --> 01:27:45,391
The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so I thought you could take her.
女儿想去动物园 你带她去吧

And Sarah, she knows.

她知道事情有点不对劲

说服她我是真的爱她

- 佛迪 怎么了?  - 别这样叫我 拜托

It's nothing. It's just, you know, there's sometimes....

Leave your family at home where they belong.

1140
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:32,237
I'm trying.

I saw Fallon hanging around again.

Today, I tested the machine...

01:53:06,878 --> 01:53:10,109
I am not gonna beg you for anything.
我再也不会求你做任何事了

1433

You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure that machine's never used again.
用不着 我再也不会使用它了

1434
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:18,951
Then, Lord Caldlow...

...where do you want me to deliver it?

My theater.
我的剧院

1437
01:53:24,095 --> 01:53:26,222
It belongs with the Prestige materials.

1438
01:53:26,865 --> 01:53:29,356
John, I tried not to involve you.

1439

So...

01:53:46,551 --> 01:53:48,610
...we go alone now.
咱们俩要分道扬镖了

1441

Both of us.
咱们俩...

1442
01:53:54,593 --> 01:53:58,029
Only I don't have as far to go as you.
只是我不能活得像你一样久

1443
01:54:03,268 --> 01:54:04,929
No.
不能

1444
01:54:06,071 --> 01:54:09,438
You were right, I should have left him to his damn trick.
你是对的 我不该去招惹他

1445
01:54:10,976 --> 01:54:12,739
I'm sorry.
对不起

1446
01:54:14,513 --> 01:54:16,913
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

I'm sorry about Sarah.

I didn't mean to hurt her.

I didn't.

1450

You go live your life in full now, all right?

Goodbye.
永别了

1453
01:55:28,219 --> 01:55:30,016
Are you watching closely?
你在仔细看吗?

1454
01:56:01,453 --> 01:56:03,478
Put it down the end.
放在这里

1455
01:56:37,055 --> 01:56:41,219
Take a minute to consider your achievement.
想想你的伟大成就

1456
01:56:41,626 --> 01:56:46,757
I once told you about a sailor who described drowning to me.

1457
01:56:46,931 --> 01:56:49,024
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1458
01:56:50,068 --> 01:56:54,971
I was lying. He said it was agony.
我说谎 他说痛苦至极

1459
01:57:33,712 --> 01:57:35,680
Alfred Borden...
艾佛波登

1460
01:57:36,081 --> 01:57:39,812
...this day, in the name of the king and the High Court of England...

...you will meet your end.
将你判处死刑

1462
01:57:43,922 --> 01:57:46,823
No one cares about the man in the box.
没人在乎消失的人

1463
01:57:50,895 --> 01:57:52,522
Cutter?

01:57:57,235 --> 01:57:58,827

1465

Do you have anything to say?

1466

1467
01:58:45,683 --> 01:58:47,150
A brother.

1468
01:58:47,318 --> 01:58:48,307
A twin.
双胞胎兄弟

1469
01:58:50,088 --> 01:58:55,390
You were Fallon the whole time.
你一直伪装成法隆?

1470
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:56,686
No.
不

1471
01:58:57,695 --> 01:59:00,095
We were both Fallon.
我们都是法隆

1472
01:59:00,265 --> 01:59:01,323
And we were both Borden.
也都是波登

1473
01:59:07,472 --> 01:59:10,407
Were you...? Were you the one who went into the box...

...or the one who came back out?

1475
01:59:13,645 --> 01:59:15,738
We took turns.
我们会轮流

1476
01:59:20,618 --> 01:59:22,609
The trick is where we would swap.
重点就在于我们互换身分

1477
01:59:28,927 --> 01:59:33,387
Cutter knew. Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple, too easy.
柯特早就知道了 但我说这太简单 太容易了

1478
01:59:34,566 --> 01:59:36,193
No.
不

1479
01:59:36,935 --> 01:59:38,800
Simple maybe, but not easy.
或许很简单 但是不容易

1480
01:59:39,204 --> 01:59:42,731
There's nothing easy about two men sharing one life.

1481
01:59:48,413 --> 01:59:50,574
I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.

1482
01:59:55,587 --> 01:59:57,748
What about Olivia? And your wife?

He loved Olivia.

1487
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,203
Just.
只不过...

1488
02:00:18,977 --> 02:00:20,808
But not for them.
对她们却不够

1489
02:00:23,448 --> 02:00:28,147
See, sacrifice, Robert, that's the price of a good trick.
自我牺牲才是精彩魔术的代价

1490
02:00:30,655 --> 02:00:33,419
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
但是你完全不能体会 不是吗?

1491
02:00:36,895 --> 02:00:38,192
I've made sacrifices.
我也做了牺牲

1492
02:00:38,363 --> 02:00:40,126
- No. - Yes.
- 没有 - 我有

1493
02:00:40,732 --> 02:00:43,701
It takes nothing to steal another man's work.
偷学别人不用花任何力气

1494
02:00:44,903 --> 02:00:46,495
It takes everything.
我尽了一切努力

1495
02:01:06,591 --> 02:01:09,617
No. No. No, wait! I'm the...!
不 等等 我是...

1496
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:17,893
It took courage.
这需要勇气

1497
02:01:20,104 --> 02:01:23,232
It took courage to climb into that machine every night...
我每晚都要鼓起勇气走进机器

1498
02:01:24,075 --> 02:01:29,035
...not knowing if I'd be the man in the box...
不知道自己会消失不见...

1499
02:01:31,983 --> 02:01:32,972
...or in the Prestige.
或是神奇现身

1500
02:01:34,786 --> 02:01:39,416
Do you wanna...? Do you wanna see what it cost me?

1501
02:01:39,891 --> 02:01:43,019
You didn't see where you are, did you?
你还没看过这地方吧?

1502
02:01:43,628 --> 02:01:45,823
Look. Look.
你看 你看

1503
02:01:46,864 --> 02:01:48,923
I don't care.
我不在乎

1504
02:01:53,237 --> 02:01:55,865
You went halfway around the world.
你到了世界另一端

1505
02:01:56,874 --> 02:01:59,809
You spent a fortune.
花了一大笔钱

1506
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:04,011
You did terrible things.
做出可怕的事

1507
02:02:05,149 --> 02:02:08,016
Really terrible things, Robert.
真正可怕的事

1508
02:02:09,754 --> 02:02:11,187
And all for nothing.
结果什么都没得到

1509
02:02:12,423 --> 02:02:15,119
- For nothing? - Yeah.
- 什么都没得到?  - 对

1510
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:23,263
You never understood why we did this.
你不懂我们为什么要变魔术

1511
02:02:26,170 --> 02:02:29,435
The audience knows the truth.
观众知道真相

1512
02:02:30,041 --> 02:02:34,034
The world is simple. It's miserable.
现实既残酷又悲惨

1513
02:02:35,813 --> 02:02:38,304
Solid all the way through.
没有奇迹 没有魔法

1514
02:02:40,251 --> 02:02:44,813
But if you could fool them, even for a second...
但是如果你能骗倒他们 即使只有一秒钟

1515
02:02:46,391 --> 02:02:49,087
...then you could make them wonder.
就能让他们惊叹

1516
02:02:49,927 --> 02:02:51,758
And then you....
然后你就能...

1517
02:02:52,196 --> 02:02:56,656
Then you got to see something very special.
然后你就能看到非常特别的事

1518
02:03:00,538 --> 02:03:02,802
You really don't know?
你真的不知道吗?

1519
02:03:06,477 --> 02:03:11,779
It was... It was the look on their faces.
那就是观众脸上的表情

1520
02:03:26,964 --> 02:03:31,958
Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts.

1521
02:03:35,239 --> 02:03:38,470
The first part is called the Pledge.
第一个步骤是"以虚代实"

1522
02:03:38,876 --> 02:03:41,538
The magician shows you something ordinary.

1523
02:03:42,713 --> 02:03:46,410
The second act is called the Turn.

1524

The magician takes the ordinary something...

1525
02:03:49,954 --> 02:03:52,889
...and makes it into something extraordinary.
做出令人叹为观止的表演

1526
02:03:54,192 --> 02:03:55,955
But you wouldn't clap yet...
但是你还不会鼓掌

1527
02:03:56,127 --> 02:03:59,187
...because making something disappear isn't enough.
因为把东西变不见还不够

1528
02:03:59,831 --> 02:04:03,323
You have to bring it back.
你必须把它变回来

1529
02:04:07,071 --> 02:04:08,732
Hey.
嘿!

1530
02:04:36,734 --> 02:04:39,794
Now you're looking for the secret.
现在你想找出秘诀

1531
02:04:42,073 --> 02:04:46,976
But you won't find it because, of course, you're not really looking.
但是绝对找不到 因为你没真正在看

1532
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:52,074
You don't really want to work it out.
你并不是真的想知道

1533
02:04:55,153 --> 02:04:58,251
You want to be fooled.
你想要被骗
