No. The tank was brought

and then taken offstage.

45
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:05,294
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the end of it.

How large was this tank?

It's a normal tank

- No.

He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:33,824
Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means,

179
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,131
so now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

180
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:40,263
He's squandering the goodwill
of his audience with tired,

- second-rate tricks...
- They're all favorites.

He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.

183
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,410
A bullet catch is suicide.

184
00:13:48,481 --> 00:13:52,474
All it takes is some smartass
volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

185
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:54,815
- Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

186

No seats left for the punters.

187
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:00,723
All right, no bullet catch, whatever,
but the point is a real magician

188
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:02,420
tries to invent something new

189
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,362
that other magicians will
scratch their heads over.

190
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:07,626
Then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

191
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,794
- What?
- I suppose you have such a trick?

192
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,430
- I sure do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

193
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:15,098
No. No one else can do my trick.

194
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:17,301
- Any trick can be duplicated.
- Wrong.

195
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:21,107
If Mr. Borden has invented
his masterpiece,

196
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,080
he's prepared to do it.

197
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:25,276
Milton is a showman,
but Borden is right,

198
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:26,978
he won't get his hands dirty.

199
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:30,614
If you want to see what
it takes to make real magic,

200
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,524
go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman
there and he really has what it takes.

201
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:36,823
- Chung Ling Soo.
- I can't afford that.

202
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:38,625
I know the bloke run the door.

203
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:43,032
You two go and see that show, and
whichever one of you can tell me

204
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:46,196
how he does the goldfish bowl
trick gets the prize.

205
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:48,536
- Which is?
- Ten minutes onstage

206
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:50,438
with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman.

207
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:51,942
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

208
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:55,071
The top theatrical agent in London.

209
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:58,139
- I saw you drop the knot again.
- <font color="#808080">WOMAN :</font> I turned my wrists.

210
00:14:58,217 --> 00:15:00,845
Some nights you
just don't get it, do you?

211
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,787
I mean, if that knot slips
and Julia's on the hoist,

212
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:04,948
she'll break her leg.

213
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:06,651
It's the wrong knot.

214
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:09,593
Like I said, the Langford
double will hold tighter.

215
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:13,189
The Langford double isn't
a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

216
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:15,495
If the rope swells, she can't slip it.

217
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:18,799
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- We can practice.

218
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:22,807
- Borden, he said no.
- Oh, you know knots better than me?

219
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,866
Listen, no more mistakes.

220
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:27,640
All right. Yeah? Do you?
You want to take over?

221
00:15:27,713 --> 00:15:30,648
- Just leave.
- I didn't think so.

222
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,918
Hey, Cutter, where's he from?

223
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:40,288
Where are you from? He shifts
props for Virgil at the hall.

224
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:43,522
- Worried he'll steal your tricks?
- Doesn't deal in methods.

225
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:46,656
- How do you know?
- Because I hired him

226
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:49,963
to find out how Virgil
does the orange trick.

227
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:52,368
- I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

228
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:54,531
'Course you can't trust him.

229
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:55,972
I think he's all right.

230
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:58,374
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

231
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:02,278
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kiss your wife's leg every night,

232
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:05,010
so can the blokes at the ends

Come on.

I never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a pint glass.

Nice little theater.

- Young, up-and-coming magician.
- Who?

464
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:44,796
- You.
- Me? Booking? Why?

Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.

Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

470

I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

That's a dangerous trick, that one.

472

No, it's sophisticated.

You're a magician, not a wizard.

00:53:53,214 --> 00:53:54,511
What happened, Robert?

765
00:53:56,918 --> 00:54:00,877
You, sir. Just a rubber ball, yes?

766
00:54:00,955 --> 00:54:02,047
Thank you.

767
00:54:02,123 --> 00:54:04,717
Just a rubber ball? No.

768
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:07,989
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

769
00:54:08,062 --> 00:54:09,188
It's magic.

770
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:12,057
He had a new trick.

when you saw it?

775
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:45,964
It was too good. It was too simple.
The audience hardly had time to see it.

776
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:48,901
- He's a dreadful magician.
- A wonderful magician.

777
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,495
He's a dreadful showman.
He doesn't dress it up,

778
00:54:51,573 --> 00:54:53,404
- how to sell it.
- How does he do it?

779
00:54:53,474 --> 00:54:55,499
- He uses a double.
- No, it's too simple.

780
00:54:55,577 --> 00:54:57,067
This is a complex illusion.

781
00:54:57,145 --> 00:54:59,545
You say that because
you don't know the method.

782
00:54:59,614 --> 00:55:02,014
It's a double that comes out.
It's the only way.

783
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:05,985
I've seen him perform it three times.
The prestige is the same man.

784
00:55:06,054 --> 00:55:09,581
- No, it's not.
- The same man comes out of the cabinet.

785
00:55:09,657 --> 00:55:11,921
It's the same man.

786
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:14,689
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers,

787
00:55:14,762 --> 00:55:17,356
but, if you look closely, you can tell.

788
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:21,934
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

789
00:55:22,003 --> 00:55:24,437
Yeah, we could use it
as a climax to the show.

Yes.

791
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:30,172
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

792
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:32,406
We got to find someone
who looks like you.

793
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,007
- He doesn't use a double.
- I don't know how Borden does it.

794
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:40,578
Either... You either wait for him
to retire and buy the secret,

795
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:42,452
or you listen to how I would do it.

796
00:55:42,523 --> 00:55:45,048
And the only way
that I know how to do it

797
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:47,594
is to find you a bloody good double.

798
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:49,995
All right.

799
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,923
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

00:55:54,002 --> 00:55:56,129
Whoo!

801
00:55:56,204 --> 00:55:57,694

He's perfect. He needs a little help.

But when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

I don't need him to be my

You will see no trickery,

At least he saw it. I spent

No, the anticipation

We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

Root, you bloody fool,
get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

Congratulations, all.

No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

898
01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:10,074
BORDEN's trick is nothing
compared to ours. He has no style.

899
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:14,012
He doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:16,982
- I need to know how he does it.
- Why?

901
01:02:17,051 --> 01:02:19,542
So I can do it better.

902
01:02:21,622 --> 01:02:24,090
I need you to go and work for him.

903
01:02:27,128 --> 01:02:28,857
Work for him? Are you joking?

904
01:02:30,131 --> 01:02:31,325
You'll be my spy.

We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

906
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:35,761
That's how we advance. Think of it.

907
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:39,033
People are excited by Cutter's
version. Imagine what we'd do

908
01:02:39,106 --> 01:02:43,543
with the real illusion. We'd have the
greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

909
01:02:43,611 --> 01:02:47,377
- He knows I work for you.
- Exactly why he'll want to hire you.

910
01:02:47,448 --> 01:02:50,008
- He'll want my secret.
- Why would he trust me?

911
01:02:50,084 --> 01:02:52,780
Because you're
gonna tell him the truth.

912
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:57,521

Now that is a slippery notion

in our line of work,
isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

944
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:53,800
I am here because he sent me here.

945
01:04:53,874 --> 01:04:56,342
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

946
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:59,777
What does he need my secret for?
His trick is topnotch.

947
01:04:59,847 --> 01:05:02,441
He vanishes,
and then he reappears instantly

948
01:05:02,516 --> 01:05:05,007
on the other side
of the stage, mute, overweight

949
01:05:05,085 --> 01:05:07,645
and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

950
01:05:07,721 --> 01:05:11,213
It's astonishing. How does
he do it? And tell me, Olivia,

951
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:14,750
does he enjoy taking his bows
under the stage?

952
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:18,128
It's killing him. He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

953
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:21,259
He thinks of nothing else,
takes no pleasure in our success.

954
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,825
And I've had enough.

955
01:05:22,903 --> 01:05:25,303
There is no future with him.

956
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:30,171
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've come to offer you his.

957
01:05:30,244 --> 01:05:34,146
This is the truth... is it?

958
01:05:38,686 --> 01:05:40,984
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

959
01:05:41,055 --> 01:05:45,082
Root, you're late and more drunk than
usual. Get down below stairs right away.

960
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:46,888
No.

961
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:50,328
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

962
01:05:50,397 --> 01:05:54,731
We have a problem. Cutter, Borden
is performing right across the street.

963
01:05:54,802 --> 01:05:58,067
Yeah, we have a bigger problem.

964
01:05:58,138 --> 01:06:01,130
Root. He's realized
that he can make demands.

965
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,301
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

966
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,345
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.

967
01:06:05,412 --> 01:06:08,006
It usually takes them
a lot longer to figure it out.

968
01:06:08,082 --> 01:06:10,642
- How much does he want?
- It makes no difference.

969
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:14,176
- We've got to stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Look at this.

970
01:06:14,255 --> 01:06:20,091
Last week they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

971
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,527
Not magician, mind you.
Performer of any kind.

972
01:06:23,597 --> 01:06:26,828
- What's your point?
- My point is, you've climbed too high

973
01:06:26,901 --> 01:06:29,335
to get away with
professional embarrassment.

974
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:32,770
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

975
01:06:34,942 --> 01:06:38,241
Just pay him for now. We keep
doing the trick until Borden opens,

976
01:06:38,312 --> 01:06:40,280
and then we'll phase it out.

977
01:06:41,181 --> 01:06:42,671
All right.

Of course I am, but don't advertise it,

01:11:44,885 --> 01:11:47,820
If I don't get that back by
tomorrow he'll know I took it.

1064
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:50,186
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

1065
01:11:51,525 --> 01:11:56,326
This is his diary, Olivia. All of his
secrets are right here in my hands.

1066
01:11:56,997 --> 01:11:58,589
It won't bring your wife back.

1067
01:11:58,665 --> 01:12:01,361
I don't care about my wife.
I care about his secret.

1070
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,749
I'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

1071
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:23,017

- Yes, me. Not you.

1073
01:12:34,568 --> 01:12:35,557

1074

I have fallen in love with him.

I already know how he does it, Robert.

the same way as we do.

Well, let's find out then, shall we?

What does it mean?

It means, Cutter, we have
a journey ahead of us.

- To America.

Listen to me.

01:18:01,828 --> 01:18:03,523
Miss Wenscombe, Mr. Fallon.

1134
01:18:04,531 --> 01:18:07,398
- What are we celebrating?
- We've hit upon a new trick.

1135
01:18:07,467 --> 01:18:09,526
- Haven't we?
- What trick, Freddie?

1136
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:11,628
Yes, Freddie, what trick?

1137
01:18:11,705 --> 01:18:16,108
I am going to bury
myself alive every night,

1138
01:18:16,176 --> 01:18:20,044
and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

- No, pour the champagne.

Pour the... Sarah, don't talk to me
like that. I'm not a bloody child.

- Perhaps it would be better...
- Mr. Fallon, escort her home.

1142
01:18:30,323 --> 01:18:33,156
- My husband's being a bore.
- Oh, please.

1143
01:18:33,226 --> 01:18:37,026
- I see no reason you should suffer.
- Don't ruin this evening.

1144
01:18:39,432 --> 01:18:42,333
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddie.

1145
01:18:46,773 --> 01:18:49,071
- Freddie?
- That's my name.

1146
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:52,509
- Not at home.
- I'm not always at home, am I?

Couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

1148

Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

1149
01:19:01,287 --> 01:19:04,347
All right? I'm out in public.
Everybody else loves it.

1150
01:19:04,424 --> 01:19:06,358
Why are you being like this?

1151
01:19:06,426 --> 01:19:09,327
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1152
01:19:09,396 --> 01:19:13,162
I thought that
something very precious...

1153
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:16,268
...had been lost to me.

1154
01:19:16,336 --> 01:19:19,464
So I just wanted
to celebrate just a little.

1155
01:19:19,539 --> 01:19:22,997
All right, what? What did you lose?

1156
01:19:28,148 --> 01:19:29,706
I see, more secrets.

1157
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:33,813
Sarah, secrets are my life.

- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop, this isn't you.

01:19:39,092 --> 01:19:41,560
Stop performing.

At first, I thought they

his bows under the stage?

He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've come to offer you his.

...is it?

1173
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:55,056
No, that's what he told
me to tell you. The truth...

1174
01:20:55,135 --> 01:20:58,969
...is that I loved him and I stood by
him and he sent me to you,

1175
01:20:59,038 --> 01:21:02,565
like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

1176
01:21:02,642 --> 01:21:05,440
I hate him for that.

1177

I could spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

So, what could you
possibly have to offer me?

1179
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:14,413
You may know his tricks,

1180
01:21:14,487 --> 01:21:17,547
but you can't understand why
no one sees yours are better.

1181
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:20,184
You hide this.
I had to look very closely

1182
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:22,592
to spot it
during The Transported man,

1183
01:21:22,662 --> 01:21:25,495
but this makes you unique.

1184
01:21:25,565 --> 01:21:27,590
It shows you aren't using a double.

1185
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:30,158
You mustn't hide it.
You must display it proudly.

1186
01:21:30,236 --> 01:21:35,003
I'm sure it takes great skill
to perform illusions with one good hand.

Yeah, it does.

1188

So let people know.

Alley!

1215
01:23:25,318 --> 01:23:27,912
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

1216
01:23:27,987 --> 01:23:30,785
- I never said he had.
- You let me believe that he had.

1217
01:23:30,857 --> 01:23:33,553
You stole my money because
your funding was cut off.

1218
01:23:33,626 --> 01:23:36,527
You've been shooting
sparks in my top hat,

1219
01:23:36,596 --> 01:23:40,088
laughing at me all along,
while using my money to stave off ruin.

1220
01:23:40,934 --> 01:23:43,061
- I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

1221
01:23:43,136 --> 01:23:45,627
In the hotel, I have a mind
to bring them up here.

1222
01:23:45,705 --> 01:23:48,401
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1223
01:23:48,474 --> 01:23:51,602
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier,

1224
01:23:51,678 --> 01:23:53,543
but we have not stolen your money.

1225
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:55,080
This is my cat.

1226
01:23:55,148 --> 01:23:58,208
When I told you I could make you
a machine, I spoke a truth.

1227
01:23:58,284 --> 01:23:59,376
Why isn't it working?

1228
01:23:59,452 --> 01:24:01,784
Because exact science, Mr. Angier,

1229
01:24:01,854 --> 01:24:03,253
is not an exact science.

1230
01:24:03,323 --> 01:24:06,486
The machine simply
does not operate as expected.

1231
01:24:06,559 --> 01:24:10,586
- It requires further examination.
- So where did my top hat go?

1232
01:24:10,663 --> 01:24:11,721
Nowhere.

1233
01:24:11,798 --> 01:24:14,596
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1234
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:16,294
The hat went nowhere.

1235
01:24:16,369 --> 01:24:18,269
We need to try different material.

1236
01:24:18,338 --> 01:24:20,499
It may provoke a different result.

Uh, at least she knows
that something is not right,

I heard about a booking,
nice little theater,

- good up-and-coming magician.
- You're back.

You told me you only wanted to show me
one trick that'd pique my interest.

- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.

Yes... but you'll have
to dress it up a little.

Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1403
01:38:13,872 --> 01:38:17,103
You haven't spoken
about her, Freddie, not once.

1404
01:38:17,176 --> 01:38:20,873
Why would I talk about her to you, hm?

1405
01:38:20,946 --> 01:38:24,814
Because she was a part of
your life and now she's gone.

1406
01:38:27,786 --> 01:38:32,280
You know, the day before she killed
herself she said she wanted to meet me.

1407
01:38:32,357 --> 01:38:35,292
That she had something
to tell me about you.

1408
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:38,955
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1409
01:38:39,031 --> 01:38:40,521
But...

1410
01:38:41,733 --> 01:38:43,997
...what would she have said?

01:38:44,069 --> 01:38:47,163
You want to know the truth about me?

1412
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,931
The truth is that...

1413
01:38:53,111 --> 01:38:55,102
...I never loved Sarah.

1414
01:38:56,315 --> 01:38:57,805
I never loved her.

1415
01:38:57,883 --> 01:39:00,113
You married her,
you had a child with her.

1416
01:39:00,185 --> 01:39:03,279
Yes. Part of me. Part of me did, but...

1417
01:39:03,355 --> 01:39:05,289
...the other part didn't.

1418
01:39:05,357 --> 01:39:09,589

the part that's sitting here right now.

You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now,

talking about me that way.

- No.
- Yes.

1425

that Lord Caldlow has purchased
the bulk of the items.

1510
01:48:20,111 --> 01:48:23,410
Mr. Cutter, if you need to know
where to deliver these items...

1511
01:48:23,481 --> 01:48:27,076
No, it's just there is
one particular item,

1512
01:48:28,019 --> 01:48:30,613
this item, in fact,

1513
01:48:30,688 --> 01:48:32,952
- I would like to...
- You would like to...

1514
01:48:33,024 --> 01:48:34,116
...buy.

1515
01:48:34,192 --> 01:48:36,092
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

1516
01:48:37,328 --> 01:48:39,262
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

1517
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:41,560
Well, I'm afraid
Lord Caldlow was adamant

1518
01:48:41,633 --> 01:48:43,863
about purchasing this particular item.

1519
01:48:43,935 --> 01:48:47,029
Do you think I could
talk to Lord Caldlow in person?

1520
01:48:47,105 --> 01:48:49,869
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

1521
01:48:52,310 --> 01:48:54,210
Of course,

1522
01:48:54,279 --> 01:48:57,510
I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements,

1523
01:48:57,582 --> 01:49:02,042
your paths were to cross,
I can't stop you speaking your mind.

1524
01:49:03,021 --> 01:49:04,147
Thank you.

You got a visitor. Lord Caldlow.

1528
01:49:11,529 --> 01:49:13,622
With a little girl.

1529
01:49:21,906 --> 01:49:23,806
Jess?

1530
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:25,502
Hello, my love.

1531
01:49:25,577 --> 01:49:29,035
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1532
01:49:29,113 --> 01:49:31,240
Fallon's missed you too. We both have.

1533
01:49:31,316 --> 01:49:33,648
Daddy, can I come in there?

1534
01:49:34,285 --> 01:49:36,913
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1535
01:49:36,988 --> 01:49:39,252
No, but everything
is gonna be all right.

1536
01:49:40,825 --> 01:49:42,554
You must be Lord Caldlow?

1537
01:49:42,627 --> 01:49:46,358
Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been.

1538
01:49:51,402 --> 01:49:53,597
They flatter you with all those chains.

1539
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:56,697
Don't they know you can't escape
without your rubber ball?

1540
01:49:56,774 --> 01:49:59,766
I pulled you out... out of that tank.

1541
01:49:59,844 --> 01:50:03,678
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician.

1542
01:50:03,748 --> 01:50:05,648
But you couldn't leave me alone.

1543
01:50:07,151 --> 01:50:09,244
I don't know what you've done.

1544
01:50:11,155 --> 01:50:14,852
But you're not afraid to get
your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1545
01:50:14,926 --> 01:50:18,191
No, not anymore. And I win.

1546
01:50:18,263 --> 01:50:21,596
No one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

1547
01:50:21,666 --> 01:50:22,792
You win?

1548
01:50:24,235 --> 01:50:28,899
This ain't a bloody competition
anymore. This is my little girl's life.

1549
01:50:28,973 --> 01:50:31,965
And don't you dare
put her in the middle of this.

1550
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:35,035
Oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so special

1551
01:50:35,113 --> 01:50:37,479
taken away from you, don't I, Borden?

1552
01:50:38,483 --> 01:50:41,213
And you can't take it
with you, now, can you?

1553
01:50:41,286 --> 01:50:43,186
Oh, she'll be looked after.

1554
01:50:43,254 --> 01:50:45,279
Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.

1555
01:50:45,356 --> 01:50:47,119
No, no, no, no, stop, my darling.

1556
01:50:47,191 --> 01:50:49,318
Look, here.

1557
01:50:50,862 --> 01:50:54,127
That's what you're after.
That's what this is about.

1558
01:50:54,933 --> 01:50:56,298
Take it.

1559
01:50:56,367 --> 01:50:58,062
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

1560
01:51:01,272 --> 01:51:04,833
You always were the better magician.
We both know that.

1561
01:51:05,476 --> 01:51:08,070
Whatever your secret was,
you have to agree,

1562
01:51:09,213 --> 01:51:10,544
mine is better.

1563
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:15,617
Don't do this. Don't do this,
Angier. Jess, Jess!

1564
01:51:15,687 --> 01:51:19,214
Jess, I'm gonna take you
home soon. I promise.

1565
01:51:19,290 --> 01:51:21,850
- For God's sake.
- I promise. Look!

1566
01:51:25,697 --> 01:51:29,292
I promise. I love you, Jess.

1567
01:51:29,367 --> 01:51:31,028
I love you.

1568
01:51:31,102 --> 01:51:32,729
- Come on.
- I love you.

1569
01:51:32,804 --> 01:51:34,499
I love you, Jess.

1570
01:51:34,572 --> 01:51:36,904
Angier! Angier!

1571
01:51:36,975 --> 01:51:39,068
What, do you think
this place can hold me?

1572
01:51:39,143 --> 01:51:42,169
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1573
01:51:42,246 --> 01:51:44,771
And you can put a stop to this now!

1574
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:47,611
Listen! Listen! That man...

1575
01:51:47,685 --> 01:51:50,051
Listen, that man is
the one I'm in for killing!

1576
01:51:50,121 --> 01:51:54,455
Listen! If he's alive, I'm not guilty!

1577
01:51:54,525 --> 01:51:56,789
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care!

1578
01:51:56,861 --> 01:51:58,954
- Get hold of him.
- Angier!

1579
01:52:03,635 --> 01:52:06,195
Run along now.

1580
01:52:06,270 --> 01:52:08,795
Sir, there's a gentleman waiting.

1581
01:52:25,623 --> 01:52:28,353
- Dear God.
- Hello, Cutter.

1582
01:52:29,327 --> 01:52:31,761
You're still alive.

1583
01:52:31,829 --> 01:52:33,694
How is it you're still alive?

1584
01:52:33,765 --> 01:52:36,165
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1585
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:41,195
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

1588
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:48,735
I saw her in court with...

1589
01:52:49,681 --> 01:52:51,308
...Fallon.

1590
01:52:53,418 --> 01:52:56,012
- What have you done?
- She needs looking after.

1591
01:52:56,087 --> 01:52:58,578
She needs her father.

1592
01:52:58,656 --> 01:53:01,625
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

1593
01:53:01,693 --> 01:53:06,630
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

1594
01:53:08,099 --> 01:53:11,535
I am not going to beg you for anything.

1595
01:53:11,602 --> 01:53:14,867
You don't have to. I'm gonna
make sure it is never used again.

1596
01:53:16,007 --> 01:53:19,101
Then, Lord Caldlow...

1597
01:53:21,646 --> 01:53:23,705
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1598
01:53:23,781 --> 01:53:27,547
My theater. It belongs
with the prestige materials.

1599
01:53:28,019 --> 01:53:30,613
John, I tried not to involve you.

1600
01:53:43,568 --> 01:53:45,832
So...

1601
01:53:47,872 --> 01:53:50,466
We go alone now.

1602
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:52,975
Both of us.

1603
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:59,181
I mean, I don't have
as far to go as you.

1604
01:54:04,489 --> 01:54:05,820
No.

1605
01:54:07,358 --> 01:54:10,418
You were right. I should have
left him to his damn trick.

1606
01:54:12,196 --> 01:54:14,289
I'm sorry.

1607
01:54:15,833 --> 01:54:18,165
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1608
01:54:19,303 --> 01:54:22,033
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1609
01:54:23,141 --> 01:54:26,599
Didn't mean to hurt her, I didn't.

1610
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:32,813
You go live your life in full now,
all right? You live for both of us.

1611
01:54:41,659 --> 01:54:43,149
Goodbye.

1612
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:31,374
Are you watching closely?

1613
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:04,674
Put it down on the end.

1614
01:56:38,075 --> 01:56:41,841
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

1615
01:56:42,914 --> 01:56:45,712
I once told you about a sailor

1616
01:56:45,783 --> 01:56:48,081
who described drowning to me.

1617
01:56:48,152 --> 01:56:50,347
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1618
01:56:51,455 --> 01:56:55,221
I was lying. He said it was agony.

Cutter knew. Cutter knew.

1640
01:59:32,149 --> 01:59:34,413
But I told him it was
too simple, too easy.

01:59:35,619 --> 01:59:36,608
No.

1642

Simple, maybe, but not easy.

1643

There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.

1644
01:59:49,633 --> 01:59:52,830
I don't understand,
how it can be bleeding again?

1645

Wha... What about Olivia and your wife?

1646
02:00:00,111 --> 02:00:02,011
We each loved one of them.

1649

We each had half of a full life,

1650
02:00:13,557 --> 02:00:16,549
really, which was enough for us...

1651
02:00:16,627 --> 02:00:17,616
...just.

1652
02:00:20,264 --> 02:00:21,993
But not for them.

into that machine every night,

1665
02:01:25,362 --> 02:01:27,796
not knowing...

1666
02:01:27,865 --> 02:01:29,992
...if I'd be the man in the box...

1667
02:01:33,037 --> 02:01:34,299
...or in the prestige.

1668
02:01:35,639 --> 02:01:38,665
Do you want to see...

1669
02:01:38,742 --> 02:01:41,040
...what it cost me?

1670
02:01:41,111 --> 02:01:43,875
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1671
02:01:44,782 --> 02:01:47,182
Look. Look.

1672
02:01:48,285 --> 02:01:49,775
I don't care.

1673
02:01:54,491 --> 02:01:58,052
You went halfway around the world.

1674
02:01:58,128 --> 02:02:00,892
You spent a fortune.

1675
02:02:02,967 --> 02:02:05,492
You did terrible things.

1676
02:02:06,503 --> 02:02:08,971
Really terrible things, Robert.

1677
02:02:11,008 --> 02:02:12,498
And all for nothing.

1678
02:02:13,477 --> 02:02:14,671
For nothing?

1679
02:02:14,745 --> 02:02:16,076
<font color="#808080">BORDEN :</font> Yeah.

1680
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:22,378
You never understood...

1681
02:02:22,453 --> 02:02:24,444
...why we did this.

1682
02:02:27,558 --> 02:02:30,118
The audience knows the truth.

1683
02:02:31,262 --> 02:02:33,696
The world is simple.

1684
02:02:33,764 --> 02:02:35,493
It's miserable.

1685
02:02:35,566 --> 02:02:39,263
Solid... Solid all the way through.

1686
02:02:41,605 --> 02:02:43,937
But if you could fool them,

1687
02:02:44,008 --> 02:02:46,169
even for a second...

1688
02:02:47,711 --> 02:02:50,111
...then you could make them wonder.

1689
02:02:51,248 --> 02:02:53,443
And then you...

1690
02:02:53,517 --> 02:02:55,747
Then you got to see something

1691
02:02:55,819 --> 02:02:57,480
very special.

1692
02:03:01,792 --> 02:03:04,317
You really don't know.

1693
02:03:07,398 --> 02:03:09,059
It was...

1694
02:03:10,134 --> 02:03:13,103
...it was the look on their faces.

something ordinary.</i>

<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something</i>

1701
02:03:51,342 --> 02:03:54,209

something extraordinary.</i>

of course, you're not really looking.</i>

1707
02:04:56,507 --> 02:04:58,805
<i>You want to be fooled.</i>
