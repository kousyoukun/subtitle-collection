1
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,890
Are you watching closely?

2
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:10,240
Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts.

3
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,770
The first part is called the Pledge.

4
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,600
The magician shows you something ordinary...

5
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,680
...a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.

6
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,720
He shows you this object...

7
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,880
...perhaps he asks you to inspect it...

8
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,690
...to see that it is, indeed, real.

9
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,990
Yeah, unaltered, normal.

10
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,210
But of course, it probably isn't.

11
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,470
-where do you think you're going?
-I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

12
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,890
The second act is called the Turn.

13
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,340
The magician takes the ordinary something...

14
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,150
...and makes it do something extraordinary.

15
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,520
Now, you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it...

16
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,990
...because, of course, you're not really looking.

17
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,260
You don't really wanna know.

18
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,870
You want to be fooled.

19
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,500
But you wouldn't clap yet...

20
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,270
...because making something disappear isn't enough.

21
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,210
You have to bring it back.

22
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,210
That's why every magic trick has a third act.

23
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,940
The hardest part.

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,960
The part we call the Prestige.

25
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,870
The Prestige. And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer...

26
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,670
...get to that final part of his trick that night?

27
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,500
-No, sir. Something went wrong.
-what went wrong?

28
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,300
I saw someone making their way below stage.

29
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,810
I followed him.

30
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,620
It was Borden, watching Mr. Angier drown.

31
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,020
would you please describe your occupation to the jury, Mr. cutter?

32
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,280
I'm an ingenieur.

33
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,830
I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for performing them.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,990
So, Mr. cutter...

35
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,330
...was this water-filled tank beneath the stage...

36
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,270
...part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

37
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,560
No, no. It was...

38
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,870
The tank was brought on for the first trick and then taken off-stage.

39
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,240
Borden must have placed it under the trap door after the interval.

40
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,810
How large was this tank?

41
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,580
oh, it's a normal tank for escape underwater, about 4 or 500 gallons.

42
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,120
How do you think Mr. Borden...

43
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,750
...was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing?

44
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,690
He's a magician. Ask him.

45
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,420
I ask again that this man explain the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

46
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,090
The Real Transported Man...

47
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,240
...is one of the most sought-after illusions in this business.

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,890
I have the right to sell it on.

49
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,670
If I reveal the method here, then the trick is worthless.

50
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,870
How can we know that the tank wasn't some part of the trick that went wrong?

51
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,700
Mr. cutter, I see your predicament...

52
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,140
...but Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.

53
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,450
If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private...

54
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,180
...I might be able to judge their relevance to the case.

55
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,950
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

56
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,540
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn out your pockets.

57
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,110
Not my idea, sir.

58
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,280
The warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air.

59
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,430
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

60
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,840
I told him the only way that Borden's gonna disappear...

61
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,430
...is if I leave him out there with the other inmates.

62
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,770
check the locks.

63
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,600
Twice.

64
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,650
My name is owens.

65
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,020
I'm a solicitor.

66
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,820
I represent Lord caldlow, an accomplished amateur magician and historian...

67
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,720
How much?

68
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,900
-Lord caldlow is interested...
-How much for my tricks?

69
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,360
Five thousand pounds.

70
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,030
Talk with Fallon, my ingenieur. Money's for him.

71
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,830
Yes, I did. He offered to sell me your tricks.

72
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,740
All except the most valuable one: The Transported Man.

73
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,070
well, I wouldn't forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.

74
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,540
Even for your daughter?

75
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,910
If the newspapers are right and you are for the drop...

76
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,450
-...your daughter will need looking after.
-Fallon will take care of her.

77
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,020
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past almost as obscure as your own.

78
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,820
courts motioned that the girl be removed from his care.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,430
No, the girl will be an orphan.

80
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,470
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse. It's better than here?

81
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,660
I'm offering you a way to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

82
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,710
And I'm offering your daughter a future.

83
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,500
As Lord caldlow's ward, she will want for nothing. Ever.

84
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,600
well, think it over.

85
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,750
And Lord caldlow would like you to have this as a show of good faith.

86
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,290
He said it might be of interest. This is Robert Angier's diary.

87
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,190
Including the time he spent in colorado learning your trick.

88
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,920
-He never learned my trick.
-Really?

89
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,550
on his return from colorado, he mounted a version of The Transported Man...

90
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,570
...that the papers said was better even than your original.

91
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:22,140
If you want Angier's secrets, you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

92
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,240
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

93
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,740
consider your daughter.

94
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,330
A cipher. An enigma.

95
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,530
A search. A search for answers.

96
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,570
Even if Colorado is the end of my journey...

97
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:02,450
...it'll take much longer to unravel the rest of Borden's secrets.

98
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,610
See, the cipher in his notebook is unlocked by a single word but...

99
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,590
...it will still take months to translate his writing and to know his mind.

100
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,770
Well, my passion is equal to the task.

101
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,610
Mr. Angier? welcome to colorado Springs.

102
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,230
-The whole town has electricity.
-Yes, sir.

103
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,950
well, quite a reception.

104
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,490
You're our first guest of the season, Mr. Angier.

105
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,030
Your telegram didn't indicate how long you'll be staying with us.

106
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,720
For as long as it takes.

107
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,060
I'll need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.

108
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,760
well, the peak is closed, sir, for scientific experimentation.

109
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,170
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.

110
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,790
You'll have to walk the rest, I'm afraid, sir.

111
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:28,660
I'm amazed how many of you newspaper writers can't read my sign.

112
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,560
Not the welcome I was expecting.

113
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,570
I know you.

114
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,110
You're the Great Danton. I saw your show in London seven times.

115
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,580
You guessed every object the audience had in their pockets.

116
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,120
I'm Alley.

117
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,760
Sorry about the fence. People interfere with our work.

118
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,450
-I've come to see Tesla.
-why?

119
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,500
He made a machine for a colleague of mine sometime ago.

120
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,160
-can you get me a meeting with him?
-Impossible, I'm afraid.

121
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,500
I brought a lot of money.

122
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

123
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,240
I simply can't help you.

124
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,700
I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely.

125
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,780
Hey, what am I holding?

126
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,950
Your watch.

127
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,760
Borden's journal entry for April 3rd, 1897, describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.

128
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,470
That was just days after he first met me.

129
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,400
We were two young men at the start of a great career.

130
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,200
Two young men devoted to an illusion.

131
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,540
Two young men who never intended to hurt anyone.

132
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,170
which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

133
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,860
If you would tie her wrists.

134
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,500
Bind her feet around the ankle.

135
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,660
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

136
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,530
-No.
-No.

137
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,840
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

138
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,210
He's complacent, he's predictable, he's boring.

139
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,970
I mean, Milton has gotten success, whatever that means...

140
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,910
...and now he's scared. He won't take any risks at all.

141
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,710
I mean, he's squandering the goodwill of the audience...

142
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,920
-...with tired, second-rate tricks.
-They're old favorites.

143
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,460
Favorites? Give me something fresh. He won't even try a bullet catch.

144
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,220
A bullet catch is suicide.

145
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,300
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

146
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,830
-Fine. Use a plant.
-You can't for every trick.

147
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,700
-There'd be no seats left for the punters.
-No bullet catch.

148
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,340
whatever. The point is that a real magician tries to invent something new...

149
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,270
...that other magicians are gonna scratch their heads over.

150
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,610
And then you sell it to him for a small fortune.

151
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,770
-All right.
-Yeah.

152
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,780
I suppose you have such a trick.

153
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,390
-Actually, I do.
-would you care to sell it to me?

154
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,080
No. No one else could do my trick.

155
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,280
-Any trick can be duplicated, right?
-wrong.

156
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,360
If Mr. Borden has invented his masterpiece...

157
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,690
...it might be only he's prepared to do it.

158
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,220
Milton is a great showman, but Borden is right.

159
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,960
He won't get his hands dirty.

160
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,530
If you wanna see what it takes to make real magic, go to the Tenley.

161
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,400
There's a chinaman there, and he really has what it takes.

162
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,800
-chung Ling Soo.
-Pricey. I can't afford that.

163
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,540
I know the bloke on the door.

164
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,010
You two go and see that show...

165
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,080
...and whichever one of you can tell me...

166
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,120
...how he does the goldfish-bowl trick...

167
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,580
-...gets a prize.
-All right.

168
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,420
-which is?
-Ten minutes on-stage...

169
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,390
...with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.

170
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,890
-Really?
-who's Ackerman?

171
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,150
The top theatrical agent in London.

172
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,260
I saw you drop the knot again.

173
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,760
-I think I turned my wrist.
-Some nights, you just don't get it, do you?

174
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,890
I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's on the hoist, she'll break a leg.

175
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,410
It's the wrong knot. Like I said, the Langford double will hold tighter.

176
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,170
The Langford double isn't a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

177
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,440
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.

178
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,740
-I can slip a Langford underwater.
-She can slip it. we'll practice.

179
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,250
Hey, Borden, he said no.

180
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,750
Yeah, well, you know knots better than me, do you?

181
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,820
Listen, no more mistakes.

182
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,590
All right. Yeah, do you? You wanna take over?

183
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,560
-Just leave it.
-I didn't think so.

184
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,630
-Hey, cutter, where's he from?
-where are you from?

185
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,070
-He shifts props for virgil at the hall.
-Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?

186
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,540
-He doesn't deal in methods.
-How do you know?

187
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,810
Because I hired him to find out how virgil does the orange trick.

188
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,320
-well, I don't trust him.
-He's a natural magician.

189
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,920
of course you can't trust him.

190
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,810
I think he's all right.

191
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,320
-You think everyone's all right.
-Even you.

192
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,190
watch your sightlines. If I can see you kissing your wife's leg every night...

193
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,890
...so can the blokes at the ends of row three and four.

194
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,470
-You're wrong. It can't be.
-No, it is.

195
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,090
-Look at the man.
-This is the trick.

196
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,800
This is a performance right here. This is why no one can detect his method.

197
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,180
Total devotion to his art.

198
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,340
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?

199
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,110
It's the only way to escape all this, you know.

200
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,280
All right.

201
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,400
I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water.

202
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,060
or fish. Look.

203
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,360
I don't know. Hang on a second.

204
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,470
He must be strong as an ox.

205
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,570
He's been pretending to be a cripple for years.

206
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,010
Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out.

207
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,170
It's unthinkable.

208
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,320
Borden saw it at once, but I couldn't fathom it.

209
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,080
Living my whole life pretending to be someone else.

210
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,920
-You're pretending to be someone else.
-I don't think changing a name compares.

211
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,560
Not just your name. who you are and where you're from.

212
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,960
I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors.

213
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,360
I thought of a name for you.

214
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,770
The Great Danton.

215
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,400
Do you like it?

216
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,740
-But it's sophisticated.
-It's French.

217
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,880
Borden writes as if no one but he understood the true nature of magic.

218
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,600
But what does he know of self-sacrifice?

219
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,600
You bloody fool.

220
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,570
-He killed it.
-what?

221
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,720
what's wrong?

222
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,560
-He killed it.
-I'm sure he didn't.

223
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,340
See? Look, now he'll bring it back.

224
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,480
No, he killed it.

225
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,810
No.

226
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,830
Look. See? He's all right. He's fine.

227
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,990
-Look at him.
-But where's his brother?

228
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,890
He's a sharp lad, your son.

229
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,630
oh, he's my nephew.

230
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,950
You're the lucky one today.

231
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,830
Are you watching closely?

232
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,030
Look closer.

233
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,840
Never show anyone.

234
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,650
They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for the secret, but as soon as you give it up...

235
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,290
...you'll be nothing to them.

236
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,650
You understand? Nothing.

237
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,350
The secret impresses no one.

238
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,350
The trick you use it for is everything.

239
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,170
-well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.
-You're welcome.

240
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,870
-Alfred. It's Alfred.
-Alfred.

241
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,910
So I could use a cup of tea.

242
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,410
I'd scandalize the landlord. I think not.

243
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,020
You think that's...? Is that enough to keep me out?

244
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,420
I think so.

245
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,190
So I'll see you again?

246
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,770
Milk and sugar?

247
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,900
-what's in there?
-Angier's machine.

248
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,040
You built this, Mr. cutter?

249
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,010
oh, no, sir. This wasn't built by a magician.

250
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,110
This was built by a wizard.

251
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,910
A man who can actually do what magicians pretend to do.

252
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,450
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens with these things after the trial?

253
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,350
They've been sold to a Lord caldlow.

254
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,320
An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case.

255
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,930
Yeah, well, don't let him take this.

256
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,860
-why ever not?
-It's too dangerous.

257
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,430
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

258
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,510
Most disappointing of all, sir...

259
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,030
...it has no trick.

260
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,780
It's real.

261
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,320
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

262
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,320
Yes.

263
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,860
This is the place where the performer's hand reaches through to the trick padlock.

264
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,360
A standard magical apparatus for escapes.

265
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,900
Yeah, with one important difference:

266
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,970
This isn't a trick lock.

267
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,070
It's been switched for a real one.

268
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,140
what a way to kill someone.

269
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,140
They're magicians, Your Honor. Showmen.

270
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,340
Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes-brutal truths...

271
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,410
...to amaze, to shock.

272
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,950
Even without an audience?

273
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,850
There was an audience.

274
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,850
You see, this water tank...

275
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,220
...was of particular significance to these two men.

276
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,290
Particularly awful significance.

277
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,030
which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman?

278
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,940
If you would tie her wrists.

279
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,270
Bind her feet around the ankle.

280
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,560
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

281
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,750
No.

282
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,130
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

283
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,650
Robert!

284
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,540
No! No! No!

285
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,780
Julia. Julia.

286
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,790
Julia! Julia!

287
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,260
I knew an old sailor once.

288
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:12,430
He told me he went overboard, tangled in the sails.

289
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:18,240
They pulled him out, but it took him five minutes to cough.

290
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,350
He said it was like going home.

291
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,950
what do you want, Borden?

292
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

293
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,700
which knot did you tie?

294
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,370
I keep asking myself that.

295
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,610
-And?
-And....

296
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,440
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

297
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,050
You don't know?

298
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,550
I'm sorry.

299
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,660
You don't know?

300
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,130
You don't know?

301
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,730
Alfred?

302
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,710
Good news. we got our first booking today.

303
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,310
-I don't think we've had the pleasure.
-Mr. Fallon is my ingenieur.

304
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,970
-where did you get all of...?
-Begged, borrowed, and don't ask.

305
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,250
He's a very enterprising soul, is Mr. Fallon.

306
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,790
-So...
-we can't afford to pay him.

307
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,820
Money will come when we get the audience.

308
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,480
But what about until then? I mean, what I earn, it's barely enough for us.

309
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,790
Don't worry about it. I'll share half my food with him or something.

310
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,600
You're already going to be doing that with someone else.

311
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,870
-No. You're...?
-Having a baby.

312
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,810
oh, my God. we should have told Fallon.

313
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,780
That is great. we're having a baby.

314
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,640
-we're having a baby.
-oh, come here.

315
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,950
Alfred, what's this?

316
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,150
oh, this is just the trick to wake Ackerman up at the end of my act.

317
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,950
Is it the masterpiece? The great trick?

318
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,690
No, no, no. The world is not ready for that one yet.

319
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,160
This is just your run-of-the-mill, daring, spectacular bullet catch.

320
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,130
-A bullet catch?
-Yeah, but it's safe, I promise. Look.

321
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,800
-Shoot me.
-Shoot you?

322
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,040
Go on, shoot me.

323
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,640
-Right there.
-No, I can't.

324
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,680
No, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't...

325
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,020
-How's that?
-That's very good.

326
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,890
-Go on, tell me how you do it.
-No, I can't do that.

327
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,970
-well, then you can't do it. Alfred...
-I can't do it?

328
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,330
I'm sorry, Alfred, but I can't raise a child on my own.

329
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,200
-You don't tell anybody that I told you.
-okay.

330
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,110
Gunpowder...

331
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,770
...wadding...

332
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,280
...and a bullet.

333
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,980
A ramrod.

334
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,610
Hold out your hand.

335
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,600
The bullet is not even in the gun when the charge is fired.

336
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,400
once you know, it's actually very obvious.

337
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,470
well, I mean, you still get...

338
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,580
It's dangerous. I mean, people still get killed doing that.

339
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,970
-well, how?
-well, you know.

340
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,110
Somebody could get a smart-ass. He can put a penny or a button...

341
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,650
...or may God forbid, Sarah, somebody could put a bullet there.

342
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,810
Don't worry. Don't worry...

343
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,250
...because I'm not gonna let anything happen.

344
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,020
Everything's gonna be all right...

345
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:58,360
...because I love you very much.

346
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,760
-Say it again.
-I love you.

347
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,270
-Not today.
-what?

348
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,570
well, on some days it's not true, and today you don't mean it.

349
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,840
Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me.

350
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,350
I like being able to tell the difference.

351
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,420
It makes the days it is true mean something.

352
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,180
All right.

353
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,310
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.

354
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,110
If there are any ladies or gentlemen here.

355
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,550
-Solid metal.
-Seen that already.

356
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,520
-Leave it out!
-come on.

357
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,400
Get out your gun, mate.

358
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,120
-who threw that?
-I did!

359
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,740
Get out your gun. You're gonna need it.

360
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,180
Get a gun.

361
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,080
It's what you came for, is it?

362
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,520
So who wants to volunteer?

363
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,560
Me! Me!

364
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,900
Me.

365
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,440
watch it, cowboy.

366
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,190
Are you man enough, sir?

367
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,850
Yes.

368
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,870
which knot did you tie, Borden?

369
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,310
which knot did you tie, Borden?

370
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,210
I don't know.

371
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,430
He came in to demand an answer, and I told him the truth.

372
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,600
That I have fought with myself over that night.

373
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,230
One half of me swearing blind that I tied a simple slipknot...

374
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,640
...the other half convinced that I tied the Langford double.

375
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,010
I can never know for sure.

376
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,790
How can he not know?

377
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,290
How can he not know?

378
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,260
He must know what he did. He must.

379
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,930
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

380
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,270
I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.

381
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,770
It's as bad as the day it happened.

382
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:34,810
-we have to get a doctor back.
-we can't afford the bloody doctor back.

383
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,750
-You've woken her.
-Great.

384
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,350
I'm sorry. I need this to heal so I can go back to work.

385
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,220
Alfred, face things. what tricks can you perform with this kind of injury?

386
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,880
I can do card pulls. I can do some prop tricks.

387
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,360
I can still do that. And I can do the trick that I've been telling you about.

388
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,520
The one that they're gonna remember me for.

389
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,800
come on.

390
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,330
Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a glass.

391
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,030
Hasn't stopped you looking.

392
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,500
Heard about a booking.

393
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,310
Nice little theater. Young up-and-coming magician.

394
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,880
-who?
-You.

395
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,740
You got me a booking? why?

396
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,820
I wanna keep on working.

397
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,010
And who's gonna hire the ingenieur that killed Julia Mccullough...

398
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,420
...in front of a sellout crowd at the orpheum?

399
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,420
Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.

400
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,960
Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.

401
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,590
I hear he had a spot of bad luck catching a bullet south of the river.

402
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,170
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

403
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,640
we'll have to whitewash the windows...

404
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,210
...confound the more curious members of the public, but it will do.

405
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,790
-we should see about an assistant.
-I've made some arrangements.

406
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,350
Have you settled on a name?

407
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,960
Yes, I have. The Great Danton.

408
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,600
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

409
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,260
No, it's sophisticated.

410
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,870
The birdcage can't be our climax. Everybody knows it.

411
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,560
-Not like this they don't.
-I don't wanna kill doves.

412
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,270
Then stay off the stage. You're a magician, not a wizard.

413
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,310
You gotta get your hands dirty if you're gonna achieve the impossible.

414
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,080
In here, Miss wenscombe.

415
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:54,620
No point in you meeting Mr. Angier if you don't fit.

416
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,760
on the right.

417
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,020
what's so hard about this?

418
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,420
Nothing. But you're going down here.

419
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,130
Hold it. Hold it there. This has gotta go around there.

420
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,400
-And this will conceal it?
-Yeah, oh, sure.

421
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,830
-All right?
-Yeah.

422
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,440
-Now, take that one there.
-Yep. okay.

423
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,080
-Pin this under.
-And this ties up here?

424
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,040
-That ties at the front.
-That's good.

425
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,020
Breathe as little as possible.

426
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,490
Now, you see? That'll go. That'll flatten.

427
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,960
-I see. Yeah.
-okay.

428
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,800
She's not experienced, but she knows how to present herself.

429
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,770
A pretty assistant is the most effective form of misdirection.

430
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,300
Thank you.

431
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,470
Ladies and gentlemen, for my final trick...

432
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,310
...I will require the assistance of two volunteers.

433
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,820
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

434
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,780
Yeah. okay. Bring your hand around.

435
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,560
-Under?
-Under, yeah.

436
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,490
There. I put it around its foot.

437
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,890
-careful.
-He's all right, ain't he?

438
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,720
-You get a volunteer to put a hand there.
-Yeah.

439
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,950
And another one there.

440
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,790
Mr. Merrit, if you'll place your hands on either side of the cage, please.

441
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,950
Thank you, olivia.

442
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,920
You best not be intending...

443
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,560
-...to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.
-of course not.

444
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,960
You ready? All right.

445
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,690
one....

446
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,930
Two....

447
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,770
-Three.
-Three. Go.

448
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,570
well, that's bloody marvelous, cutter.

449
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,810
very nice.

450
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,110
And the best part is....

451
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,520
I thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.

452
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,090
Someday perhaps you will. I just had to know that you can.

453
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,990
-very nice. very nice, indeed.
-Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

454
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,000
I haven't had the chance to compliment your beautiful theater.

455
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,500
well, it'll be a lot more beautiful when it's full.

456
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,500
-Don't worry.
-oh, you all say that.

457
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,470
why should I worry? If your tricks don't get them in, somebody else's will.

458
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,810
Maybe somebody willing to do a bullet catch or a water escape?

459
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,340
cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

460
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,140
People hoping for an accident, likely to see one too.

461
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,840
what would that do for your business?

462
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,260
-You got a week, John.
-Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

463
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,640
Thank you.

464
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,330
Sir? In the third row there.

465
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,310
Please stand up and show us your handkerchief.

466
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,940
This isn't mine.

467
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,210
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the lady in the aisle.

468
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,680
I believe she has yours.

469
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,880
Thank you.

470
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,460
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making so many mistakes.

471
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,460
I'm so nervous.

472
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,160
The audience doesn't seem to be responding.

473
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:32,130
They've seen a lot of tricks before, but not this next one.

474
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,110
Put a cloth over.

475
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,080
-Fingers crossed.
-I'll have the champagne ready.

476
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,370
-You've seen this one before?
-we've seen them all.

477
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,970
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

478
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,580
Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentleman to hold this cage with me.

479
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,940
I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves...

480
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,950
...or any other audience anywhere in the world.

481
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,650
Madam, if you'll place one hand on the back of the cage, one hand on the front.

482
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,690
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage, one hand on the top.

483
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,870
-Should have spotted him.
-You had a lot of plates going.

484
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,310
-Don't suppose they'll let us do this again.
-No.

485
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,280
-So, what's the climax of our show?
-Show? You don't have a show.

486
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,040
we have a week's engagement.

487
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,850
To perform magic, not butcher birds and break my customers' fingers.

488
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,450
clear out. Anything here in the morning gets burned.

489
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,950
-Mr. Merrit...
-It's done, John.

490
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,750
I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians.

491
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,460
well, there's plenty of good theaters.

492
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:15,630
If we can come up with a new trick, change the name of the act...

493
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,670
The name stays.

494
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,630
Right. well, then the new trick's gonna have to be irresistible, then.

495
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,430
I have a couple of methods to try out.

496
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,050
And then we need a new angle on the presentation.

497
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,020
oh, and if you need some inspiration...

498
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,180
...there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week.

499
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,020
Engineers, scientists, you know?

500
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,360
That sort of thing captures a public's imagination.

501
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,810
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me down here during the storms.

502
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,110
Perfect excuse to come join the Great Danton for a drink.

503
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,120
Two of them.

504
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,180
Beautiful, isn't it, huh? God, I miss New York though.

505
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,730
-So why are you here?
-The lightning lives here.

506
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,990
And not much else. our work is secret.

507
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,530
Is that a cipher?

508
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,710
It's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the diary.

509
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:28,710
Simple, but time-consuming to translate, even when you have the five-letter keyword.

510
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,640
which is?

511
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,710
we magicians have a circle of trust.

512
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,820
You have a circle of trust with someone whose diary you stole?

513
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,010
Maybe I bought it.

514
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,520
And you're hoping to find a great secret in there.

515
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,350
I've already found it. That's why I'm here.

516
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,660
Tesla built one for another magician.

517
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,100
-why would you want the same thing?
-call it a professional rivalry.

518
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,910
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people.

519
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,670
But he would never talk about it.

520
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,780
I understand discretion. I just want the machine.

521
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,990
Finish your drink.

522
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,320
I wanna show you something.

523
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,720
I think you'll have a special appreciation for our work.

524
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,290
-I thought it was a secret.
-You're a magician.

525
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,120
who's gonna believe you?

526
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,460
Not long now.

527
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,040
our equipment requires a great deal of current.

528
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,040
Tesla electrified the town in exchange for using the generators when we need to.

529
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,300
we do our tests when the townspeople are asleep.

530
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,070
Mr. Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.

531
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,970
where are the wires?

532
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,590
Exactly.

533
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,010
-where's the generator?
-You saw it last week.

534
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,150
-That must be 10 miles from here.
-Fifteen.

535
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,320
And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed.

536
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:28,120
I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr. Angier.

537
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,320
Magic. Real magic.

538
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,440
Now appearing only here at London's Royal Albert Hall.

539
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:38,800
one of the miracles of our age.

540
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,100
A technological marvel.

541
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,510
You've never seen anything like it in your lives.

542
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,040
Your eyes will not believe what they're witnessing.

543
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,270
The miracle of Nikola Tesla, ladies and gentlemen.

544
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,820
Free clean power. would you like to know the future?

545
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,350
The man speaking now is going to change the world.

546
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,360
Ladies and gentlemen, come one, come all. Immediate seating, no waiting.

547
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,810
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry...

548
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,670
...but objections have been raised...

549
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,110
-...concerning the safety....
-They should be. Does that look safe to you?

550
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,810
Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign...

551
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,860
...against Mr. Tesla's superior alternating current.

552
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,580
Mr. Alley, please.

553
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,250
we have asked Mr. Tesla to reconsider...

554
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:37,060
-which he will not.
-...his presentation.

555
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,430
But I've been told he refuses to appear under any such restrictions.

556
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,900
clear the hall! This thing is gonna blow!

557
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:47,670
-clear the hall!
-Ladies and gentlemen, please!

558
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,380
where's the switch?

559
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,550
This is all perfectly safe.

560
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,540
Hey.

561
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,270
Hello, you.

562
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,220
Hello, Jess.

563
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,380
Have you had a nice day with Mummy?

564
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,620
Sarah, I love you.

565
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,170
-See? Today it's true.
-Yeah.

566
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,000
Hello.

567
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,340
I saw happiness.

568
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,640
Happiness that should have been mine.

569
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,140
But I was wrong.

570
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:01,870
His notebook reveals that he never had the life that I envied.

571
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:04,570
The family life that he craves one minute...

572
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:08,850
...he rails against the next, demanding freedom.

573
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,890
His mind.... His mind is a divided one.

574
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,890
His soul is restless.

575
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:20,260
His wife and child tormented by his fickle and contradictory nature.

576
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,440
what do you think? what do you think you'll call her?

577
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,870
I don't know.

578
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,270
Everybody needs a name. So, what's hers?

579
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:32,940
Maybe Sarah.

580
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,720
That's a lovely name. That's a lovely name.

581
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:41,010
You talk about what you wanna do for the rest of the day.

582
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,950
All right? Go on. You talk with her.

583
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:47,480
They're taking her away?

584
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,690
To the workhouse?

585
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,960
Now, you keep talking.

586
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:01,870
Tell owens I've reconsidered. Take it. Go on, take it.

587
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,710
It's for the best.

588
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:15,690
Let me see.

589
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,760
-I'm gonna learn all the Professor's secrets.
-only if I teach you how to read.

590
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,590
They're just stupid tricks, right?

591
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,530
Haven't helped you get out of here, have they?

592
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,570
or can't you undo real locks, Professor?

593
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:35,440
well, maybe I'm just biding my time.

594
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:41,450
Maybe one day I'll open my hand, get your attention, ask:

595
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,670
"Are you watching closely?"

596
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:46,620
Maybe a magic word or two.

597
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,990
And then I'll be gone.

598
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,490
How'd you get so famous, then, eh?

599
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,630
Magic.

600
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,940
Borden, get back here!

601
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,570
Thank you.

602
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,470
Shut up! Get him down!

603
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,870
Thank you.

604
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,040
who's got a bloody key?

605
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:23,150
February 8th, 1899.

606
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,290
Today, finally a breakthrough.

607
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,090
Tesla's agreed to see me.

608
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:36,960
It's perfectly safe.

609
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,150
So this is the Great Danton.

610
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,960
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions.

611
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,340
Hold out other hand.

612
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,880
what's conducting the electricity?

613
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,350
our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite capable of conducting...

614
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,010
...and, indeed, producing energy.

615
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:30,610
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

616
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,690
I need something impossible.

617
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:42,230
You are familiar with the phrase, "Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

618
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,000
It's a lie.

619
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,140
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

620
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,180
Society only tolerates one change at a time.

621
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,910
The first time I tried to change the world...

622
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,710
...I was hailed as a visionary.

623
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,810
Second time, I was asked politely to retire.

624
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,790
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

625
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,230
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.

626
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,090
what you want is simply expensive.

627
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,300
If I were to build for you this machine...

628
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,530
...you would be presenting it merely as illusion?

629
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,070
well, if people actually believed the things I did on-stage...

630
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,840
...they wouldn't clap, they'd scream. I mean, think of sawing a woman in half.

631
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,880
Mr. Angier, have you considered the cost of such a machine?

632
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,880
Price is not an object.

633
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,920
Perhaps not, but have you considered the cost?

634
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,220
I'm not sure I follow.

635
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,120
Go home. Forget this thing.

636
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,390
I can recognize an obsession.

637
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,550
No good will come of it.

638
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,530
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

639
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,790
At first. But I have followed them too long.

640
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:53,410
I am their slave, and one day, they will choose to destroy me.

641
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,780
If you understand an obsession, then you know you won't change my mind.

642
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,100
So be it.

643
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,940
will you build it?

644
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:08,480
I have already begun to build it, Mr. Angier.

645
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,020
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

646
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,520
This will take some time.

647
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,420
I thought you'd gone.

648
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,550
I don't really have anywhere to go.

649
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:46,690
You've been sleeping here?

650
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,260
cutter said it would be all right till we get another booking. what are you doing?

651
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,660
Research.

652
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:58,270
Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions...

653
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,200
You're going to do something to that man, aren't you?

654
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,170
cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.

655
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,780
He says if Borden thinks things are even between you two...

656
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,540
Even?

657
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,640
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

658
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,720
He has a family now, right? And he's performing again.

659
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,620
Borden is living his life just as he always intended, as if nothing had happened.

660
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:19,850
And look at... Look at me, all right?

661
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,890
-I'm alone and no theater will touch me.
-Us.

662
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,530
You're going to need a better disguise.

663
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:44,670
Need a volunteer.

664
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,420
What happened?

665
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,580
Did you hurt him?

666
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,490
what happened, Robert?

667
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:57,330
You, sir.

668
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,860
Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

669
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,530
Just a rubber ball, no.

670
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,900
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

671
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:08,100
It's magic.

672
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,880
He had a new trick.

673
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:25,780
Was it good?

674
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,730
It was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen.

675
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,930
Did they applaud when you saw it?

676
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,130
The trick was too good, it was too simple.

677
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,120
-The audience hardly had time to see it.
-He's a dreadful magician.

678
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,020
No, he's a wonderful magician. He's a dreadful showman.

679
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,280
He doesn't know how to dress it up, how to sell...

680
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,180
-How does he do it?
-Uses a double.

681
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,950
No, no, no, it's too simple. This is a complex illusion.

682
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,520
You only say that because you don't know the method.

683
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,950
It's a double at the end. It's the only way.

684
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,490
I've seen him perform the trick three times now.

685
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:05,830
-The Prestige is the same man.
-No, it's not.

686
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,570
The same man comes out of that second cabinet.

687
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,830
It's the same man.

688
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,470
He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers...

689
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,470
...but if you look closely you can tell.

690
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,910
He doesn't know how to sell it to an audience, but I do.

691
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,410
Yeah, well, we can use it as a climax to the show.

692
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,720
Yes.

693
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,070
The man stole my life, I'm gonna steal his trick.

694
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,490
-we gotta find someone who looks like you.
-He doesn't use a double.

695
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,990
Robert, I don't know how Borden does the trick, so either...

696
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,530
You either wait for him to retire and buy the secret...

697
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,460
...or you listen to how I would do it.

698
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:46,540
And the only way that I know how to do it is to find you a bloody good double.

699
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,100
All right.

700
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,870
Take a good look. Let's get out there and find me.

701
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,020
Look. Look.

702
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,710
what's that?

703
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,980
That is for you.

704
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,920
what's this for?

705
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,720
come here.

706
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,630
-I asked you last week. You said you...
-You caught me in a wrong mood.

707
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,200
But you went over all the...

708
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,900
Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind, aren't I?

709
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:28,760
The act is taking off, soon we'll be in a bigger theater.

710
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,210
Things will work out.

711
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:34,350
I can't believe it. Thank you.

712
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,420
Thank you. It's beautiful.

713
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,890
Gerry?

714
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,420
Darling, look at you.

715
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,230
Mr. cutter, Mr. Angier, I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

716
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,780
A pleasure. Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

717
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,210
would you like for me to tell you a little joke? come here.

718
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,050
There we are. Yes?

719
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,240
Are you laughing now?

720
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,260
oh, dear, I have to take a piss.

721
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,760
-He's out of his mind.
-of course. He's an out-of-work actor.

722
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:19,730
He's perfect. He needs a little help...

723
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,730
...but when I get done with him, he could be your brother.

724
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,430
I don't need him to be my brother, I need him to be me.

725
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,160
Give me a month.

726
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,910
come around.

727
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,450
So you open the door and....

728
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,250
come on.

729
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,900
-couldn't you have found a softer one?
-well, it's not for sleeping on.

730
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,440
So if you come down through there...

731
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,170
-...does Root go up through there?
-Yep.

732
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,310
It's going to be amazing, Robert.

733
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:09,610
well, it has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed.

734
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:14,050
The place was packed today.

735
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,450
You went and saw his show again.

736
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,990
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

737
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,660
All I have to do is keep myself drunk...

738
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,100
...and no one will be able to tell the difference.

739
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,170
Have a little faith, sir.

740
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:40,210
Now, would you favor us with a performance, Mr. Root?

741
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,780
Jesus.

742
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:04,130
Yes, you would drink too if you knew the world half as well as I do.

743
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:09,530
Did you think you were unique?

744
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:12,200
I have been caesar. I played Faust.

745
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,350
How difficult could it possibly be to play the Great Danton?

746
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,680
You can go back to being yourself now, Root, for nothing.

747
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,010
I'd rather be him for now.

748
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,990
I find it amusing.

749
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:31,460
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

750
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,500
-You look wonderful.
-oh, thank you.

751
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,760
Root has to keep a low profile. Anyone sees him, the game's up.

752
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,870
I don't know how you do these things. I'm not sure I wanna know.

753
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,440
Have you thought what we should call the trick?

754
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:47,180
There's no point in being coy. Borden calls his trick "The Transported Man."

755
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,730
Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight...

756
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:59,490
...may be termed as illusions or entertaining trifles.

757
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,220
Alas...

758
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,870
...I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

759
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:10,930
watch carefully.

760
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,870
You'll see no trickery...

761
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,900
...for no trickery is employed.

762
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,410
Merely a technique familiar to certain citizens of the orient...

763
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,780
...and various holy men of the Himalayas.

764
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,850
Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique...

765
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,150
...but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed...

766
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,390
...what you're about to see is considered safe.

767
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,450
To our achievement.

768
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,790
The manager says he's never seen a reaction like it.

769
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,250
At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

770
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,790
No one cares about the man who disappears into the box.

771
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,720
They care about the one who comes out.

772
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:24,860
-I care about the man in the box.
-Thank you.

773
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:28,230
I don't know. Maybe... Maybe we could switch before the trick.

774
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,490
I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below.

775
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:33,400
No, the anticipation of the trick is everything.

776
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:36,600
we need your showmanship to build up the suspense.

777
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,040
once Root opens his mouth, it's over. He can't introduce this trick.

778
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:43,050
of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

779
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,460
Root, you bloody fool. Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

780
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:49,410
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

781
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:51,580
congratulations, all.

782
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,220
Life is not full of these moments, Robbie. we worked hard.

783
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,990
we need to celebrate properly.

784
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:03,190
what's wrong? Is it your wife?

785
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,600
No. No, it's the trick. It isn't good enough.

786
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,970
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He has no style.

787
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,980
well, he doesn't spend the finale hiding under the stage.

788
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,840
I need to know how he does it.

789
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:18,380
-why?
-So I can do it better.

790
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,990
I need you to go and work for him.

791
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,790
work for him? Are you joking?

792
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,220
You'll be my spy.

793
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,460
we just got our start. You want me to leave?

794
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,660
That's how we advance. Think of it, olivia.

795
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:38,760
we got people excited, but imagine what we could do with the real illusion.

796
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,470
we'd have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

797
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,040
He knows I work for you.

798
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:47,480
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you. He'll want my secret.

799
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,710
-why would he trust me?
-Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

800
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,090
Good girl.

801
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:11,830
You must be curious to see what so much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.

802
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,340
It's fitting you should be here for maiden voyage.

803
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,200
Your hat.

804
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,580
You might wanna stand back.

805
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,400
I don't understand.

806
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,870
Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it.

807
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,170
-Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?
-No, no, no.

808
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,870
-come back next week.
-Next week?

809
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,140
-come back... Next week, it'll be fine.
-Tesla.

810
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,080
She's just a little temperamental sometimes.

811
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:08,790
-Interesting workshop.
-Yeah, we make do.

812
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,290
-My name is olivia wenscombe...
-I know who you are.

813
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:12,760
You here to steal my show?

814
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,730
I'm here to give it what it's missing.

815
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,060
-Yeah? what might that be?
-Me.

816
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,580
I was just saying that, wasn't I, Bernard? woman's touch.

817
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,570
-I've left Angier.
-All right.

818
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,480
-I want a job.
-Yeah?

819
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,620
-I know you've no reason to trust me...
-why wouldn't I trust you?

820
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:35,650
I mean, you're only the mistress of my enemy. why wouldn't I trust you?

821
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,120
-Mr. Borden...
-Alfred.

822
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,020
I'm going to tell you the truth.

823
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,860
Now that is a slippery notion in our line of work...

824
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:47,930
...isn't it, Miss wenscombe?

825
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,630
I am here because he sent me here.

826
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:55,270
He wants me to work for you and steal your secret.

827
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,100
what does he need my secret for?

828
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,680
His trick is top-notch.

829
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,510
He vanishes and then he reappears on the other side of the stage...

830
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,520
...mute, overweight and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

831
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,350
It's astonishing. How does he do it?

832
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:13,660
And tell me, olivia, does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

833
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:14,850
No, it's killing him.

834
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:17,020
He's obsessed with discovering your methods.

835
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,290
He thinks of nothing else.

836
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,620
He takes no pleasure in our success, and I've had enough.

837
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,230
There is no future with him.

838
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,070
He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.

839
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:33,140
This is the truth, is it?

840
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,350
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

841
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,950
Root, you're late and more drunk than usual.

842
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,550
-Now, get down below stairs right away.
-No.

843
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:49,220
No, we need to have a little chat, Mr. cutter.

844
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,420
we have a problem.

845
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,160
cutter, Borden is performing right across the street.

846
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:55,960
Yeah? we have a bigger problem.

847
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:00,040
Root. He's realized he can make demands.

848
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,200
wha...? He's blackmailing us?

849
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,540
I was surprised, to tell you the truth. It usually takes them longer to figure it out.

850
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:09,510
-well, how much does he want?
-well, it makes no difference.

851
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,080
-we gotta stop doing the trick.
-Stop the trick? cutter, look at this.

852
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,080
well, look at yesterday's, look at last week...

853
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,920
...where they said you were the premier stage performer in London.

854
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,650
Not magician, mind you.

855
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,420
-Performer of any kind.
-well, what's your point?

856
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,860
My point is, Robert, is you've climbed too high...

857
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:28,230
...to get away with professional embarrassment.

858
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,630
we don't do any tricks we can't control.

859
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,230
Just pay him whatever he wants for now.

860
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:39,210
we keep doing the trick until Borden opens and then we'll phase it out.

861
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:41,750
All right.

862
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,440
Cutter was always surprised how fast Root turned bad.

863
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:53,010
To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?

864
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:56,560
You're the Great Danton, aren't you?

865
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:00,060
of course I am, but don't advertise it because I'll be mobbed with fans.

866
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,130
We paid him enough to keep him in beers...

867
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,430
...so you wouldn't expect him to rock the boat.

868
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,160
Indeed, many of you may be familiar with this technique.

869
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,970
But for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed...

870
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,170
...what you're about to see is considered safe.

871
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,640
And who are you?

872
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:21,650
I am a humble admirer and a fellow practitioner.

873
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,980
very good.

874
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:35,160
-Another?
-oh, if you insist.

875
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,230
-Another.
-I'm not performing tonight.

876
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,130
well, I'm only doing one show...

877
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:42,500
...but to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days.

878
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,770
Get up there!

879
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,230
Get up!

880
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,570
Your illusion, The Transported Man...

881
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,720
...I'm not claiming to know your methods or anything...

882
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:58,880
...but I had a similar trick in my act, and I used a double.

883
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:01,390
I see. very good.

884
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,120
well, it was, and then it went bad.

885
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:09,700
what I didn't count on, was that when I incorporated this bloke into my act...

886
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:11,840
...he had complete power over me.

887
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:14,640
complete power, you say.

888
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:37,390
Be very careful giving someone that power over you.

889
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:41,830
well, thank you.

890
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,160
Yes, thank you for the warning.

891
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,330
cheers.

892
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,270
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

893
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:55,280
what you're about to see is considered safe.

894
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:37,650
The Great Danton.

895
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:45,690
I apologize.

896
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:49,600
There simply is too much magic...

897
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:54,760
...for my stage at the Pantages across the street.

898
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,680
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

899
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,250
Pardon my intrusion.

900
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,750
-Bravo!
-And go easy on the poor chap.

901
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:09,010
He does try so very hard.

902
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,460
I don't know how Borden found him.

903
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,420
Kept him under wraps, I was careful.

904
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,530
Yeah, well, he did.

905
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,460
Do you think it was her?

906
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:29,530
You weren't expecting me?

907
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:32,370
I was expecting you sooner. Your message said afternoon.

908
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,640
It takes a bit for me to get around these days.

909
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:36,640
He's taken everything from me.

910
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,680
My wife, my career, now you.

911
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:40,840
what do you mean? You sent me...

912
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,890
I sent you to steal his secret, not to improve his act.

913
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,520
-That's my job.
-or fall in love.

914
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:48,250
-I did everything you asked!
-Yes? Yes?

915
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:50,950
-Then how does he do it?
-cutter was right, a double.

916
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:54,000
-of course Borden said that.
-He didn't say anything. I've seen things.

917
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:58,330
Makeup, glasses, wigs. we don't use it for the show, but I've seen it backstage.

918
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:02,300
It's misdirection. He leaves things around to make you think he's using a double.

919
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,240
All the time? He doesn't know when I look.

920
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:06,380
All the time, olivia!

921
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:08,840
That's who he is! That's what it takes!

922
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:11,380
He lives his act! Don't you see?

923
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,720
Just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.

924
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:19,220
You think you can see everything, don't you?

925
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:23,020
But the Great Danton is a blind fool. His notebook.

926
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,220
You stole it?

927
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,160
I borrowed it for tonight.

928
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,360
I thought you could translate it, but now...

929
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:32,530
-I can't.
-You can't?

930
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:35,540
olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

931
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:38,970
Even with the keyword it would take months to decode.

932
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:42,080
-And without the keyword?
-Perhaps never.

933
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:43,650
-we'll see.
-we will not see.

934
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:46,750
If I don't get that back to him tomorrow, he'll know I took it.

935
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,080
-Leave him.
-I can't. He knows where I live.

936
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:52,420
This is his diary, olivia.

937
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:55,220
All of his secrets are right here in my hands.

938
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:57,460
won't bring your wife back.

939
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:00,790
I don't care about my wife, I care about his secret.

940
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:15,410
Look...

941
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,610
...I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in.

942
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,950
-He'll know you took it.
-Yes, me. Not you.

943
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,890
Understand?

944
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:34,820
Robert.

945
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,660
I have fallen in love with him.

946
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:43,370
Then I know how hard this has been for you.

947
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,840
Notebook?

948
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:57,750
Then he's just getting started.

949
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,780
Good evening.

950
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:32,120
-could I get your autograph?
-Professor.

951
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:36,490
Here. I'm walking tonight.

952
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,560
Let him come. I don't care.

953
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:41,130
-Professor.
-Professor.

954
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,350
-You all right?
-I'm alive.

955
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,610
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

956
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:27,160
-I'm impressed.
-why's that?

957
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,830
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

958
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,170
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

959
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:34,680
Risk.

960
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:36,080
Sacrifice.

961
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:40,280
The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is gonna be yours, unless you give me what I want.

962
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,820
-which is?
-Your secret.

963
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,220
My secret?

964
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:48,660
Your method for The Transported Man.

965
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:51,420
Fallon wouldn't tell me. He doesn't seem to talk at all.

966
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,860
You have my notebook.

967
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:54,970
Useless without the keyword.

968
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,100
write down your method, Mr. Borden.

969
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:00,140
Describe it in full.

970
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,810
I want the whole method, not the keyword.

971
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,390
I don't even know if your secret's in your notebook.

972
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,820
The keyword is the method.

973
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:25,790
where's my ingenieur?

974
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:35,540
-Alive?
-How fast can you dig?

975
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:41,080
Fallon! You hear me? Fallon!

976
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:45,050
-How's the arm?
-Still attached.

977
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,920
-Did you find your answer?
-our answer.

978
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:51,890
cutter, I haven't looked yet. I wanted you to share this.

979
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,530
I already know how he does it, Robert.

980
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,560
The same way he always has. The same way as we do.

981
01:16:57,730 --> 01:17:00,100
It's just that you want something more.

982
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:01,820
well, let's find out then, shall we?

983
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,670
what does it mean?

984
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,010
It means, cutter, we have a journey ahead of us.

985
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,910
-To America.
-Robert?

986
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:24,210
Listen to me.

987
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:28,520
obsession is a young man's game.

988
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:32,630
-oh, come on.
-I can't follow you any further in it.

989
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:35,600
I can't. I'm sorry.

990
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:41,400
Then the rest is up to me.

991
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:45,140
I'm sorry.

992
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,580
Good evening. Hello, darling.

993
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:55,550
champagne, your finest.

994
01:17:56,290 --> 01:17:57,910
I didn't know we were going to be joined for dinner.

995
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:01,790
-Absolutely. we are celebrating.
-Miss wenscombe.

996
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,900
Mr. Fallon. well, what are we celebrating?

997
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:07,500
well, we've hit upon a new trick, haven't we, Fallon?

998
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:10,570
-what trick, Freddy?
-Yes, Freddy, what trick?

999
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:15,000
I am going to bury myself alive every night...

1000
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:18,940
...and then someone will come along and dig me up. wonderful.

1001
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:23,010
-No, I think my husband's had quite enough.
-No, pour the champagne. come on, pour...

1002
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,910
Right. Sarah, don't talk to me like that. I'm not a child.

1003
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,020
-Perhaps it would...
-Perhaps, Mr. Fallon...

1004
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:31,250
...you might escort Miss wenscombe home. My husband's being a bore.

1005
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:34,990
-I see no reason why you have to suffer.
-oh, please. Don't ruin this evening.

1006
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:42,020
Good night, Mrs. Borden. Good night, Freddy.

1007
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,960
-"Freddy"?
-well, that's my name.

1008
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:52,410
-Not at home.
-well, I'm not always at home, am I?

1009
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:56,280
well, couldn't you have at least taken off the beard?

1010
01:18:56,450 --> 01:19:00,110
Sarah, I just came from the bloody theater just now.

1011
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,980
All right? And I'm out in public.

1012
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:05,280
-Everybody else loves it.
-why are you being like this, Alfred?

1013
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,220
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1014
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:13,020
I thought that something very precious...

1015
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,100
...had been lost to me.

1016
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:18,360
So I just wanted to celebrate. Just a little.

1017
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,800
All right, what?

1018
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,700
what did you lose?

1019
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,640
I see, more secrets.

1020
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:32,710
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1021
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,780
-our life.
-No, Alfred, stop.

1022
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,480
This isn't you. Stop performing.

1023
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,240
I thought I had the place to myself, Mr. Brent.

1024
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:08,780
Unexpected guests.

1025
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:12,390
Not very polite. A lot of questions.

1026
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,190
First I thought they might work for the government.

1027
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,230
-No?
-worse.

1028
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,590
They work for Thomas Edison.

1029
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:23,370
Today, a most curious development.

1030
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:27,560
His assistant came to us with a proposition.

1031
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:31,640
Obviously, Angier has sent her and told her to admit as much.

1032
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:34,540
Does he enjoy taking his bows under the stage?

1033
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:38,380
He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.

1034
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,450
This is the truth, is it?

1035
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,890
No, that's what he told me to tell you. The truth...

1036
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:57,870
...is that I loved him, and I stood by him, and he sent me to you...

1037
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,400
...like he would send a stagehand to pick up his shirts.

1038
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:04,240
I hate him for that.

1039
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:08,410
I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theater.

1040
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,610
So, what could you possibly have to offer me?

1041
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,480
You know how he does his tricks, but you can't understand...

1042
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,520
...why no one can see yours are better. You hide this.

1043
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:21,530
I had to look very closely to spot it when you were performing The Transported Man...

1044
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:24,420
...but this makes you unique.

1045
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,760
It shows the audience you aren't using a double.

1046
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:29,030
You mustn't hide it, display it proudly.

1047
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:33,470
I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.

1048
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:35,960
Yeah, it does.

1049
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:40,070
So let people know.

1050
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:44,470
You could be so much more than he is, and I can show you how.

1051
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,780
I think she's telling the truth.

1052
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:50,780
I think we cannot trust her.

1053
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:56,790
But I love her. I need her.

1054
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:01,360
To open myself to such a relationship...

1055
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:05,200
...to the dangers of such an affair...

1056
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:10,070
...I need assurances of fidelity. Of love.

1057
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:12,670
But how to be sure?

1058
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:19,310
I know a way. It's the only way to know her mind.

1059
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,150
How could he send you away?

1060
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,890
She must help me rid ourselves of Angier.

1061
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:35,630
Today, my mistress proves her truthfulness.

1062
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,100
Not to me, you understand.

1063
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:40,240
I've been convinced since she led me to Root.

1064
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:46,210
Today, Olivia proves her love for me to you, Angier.

1065
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,280
Yes, Angier.

1066
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:50,740
She gave you this notebook at my request.

1067
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:56,080
And, yes, "Tesla " is merely the key to my diary, not to my trick.

1068
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:00,780
Did you really think I'd part with my secret so easily after so much?

1069
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,190
Goodbye, Angier.

1070
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,460
May you find solace for your thwarted ambition back in your American home.

1071
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,140
Tesla!

1072
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,340
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1073
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,720
Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.

1074
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:29,620
-we never said he had.
-But you let me believe that he had.

1075
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:32,420
You stole my money because your funding had been cut off.

1076
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:36,360
You've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along...

1077
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:39,000
...while using my money to stave off ruin.

1078
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:41,960
-Now, I have seen Edison's men.
-where?

1079
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:44,500
In the hotel. And I have every mind to bring them up here myself.

1080
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:47,300
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1081
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:50,500
It is true that you are our last remaining financier...

1082
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,440
...but we have not stolen your money.

1083
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:53,980
Sir, my cat.

1084
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:57,110
when I told you I could make your machine, I spoke a simple truth.

1085
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,680
-Then why isn't the machine working?
-Because exact science, Mr. Angier...

1086
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,150
...is not an exact science.

1087
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,410
The machine simply does not operate as expected.

1088
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:07,850
It requires further examination.

1089
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:10,620
-So where did my top hat go?
-Nowhere.

1090
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,560
we tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1091
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:15,060
The hat went nowhere.

1092
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:17,170
we need to try different material.

1093
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:21,000
It may provoke a different result.

1094
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,600
copernicus, come on.

1095
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:35,280
You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, doctor.

1096
01:24:56,370 --> 01:25:00,040
I hope that whatever you were really doing with my money was more worthwhile...

1097
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:02,150
...Mr. Tesla.

1098
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:58,260
Alley!

1099
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:02,900
So the machine was working.

1100
01:26:03,070 --> 01:26:06,600
I never bothered to check the calibration because the hat never moved.

1101
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,840
These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier.

1102
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,180
That's one of the principal beauties of science.

1103
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:15,720
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out the problems with the machine.

1104
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:18,080
we'll send word when it's ready.

1105
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:22,380
Don't forget your hat.

1106
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,990
-well, which one is mine?
-They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.

1107
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,910
You look so pretty in this new dress of yours.

1108
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:39,940
-Are we going to the zoo this afternoon?
-No, no, no. Daddy has some errands to run.

1109
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:42,100
-But you promised.
-I promised, did I?

1110
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,440
Then go to the zoo we shall.

1111
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:47,920
So Daddy will go run his errands and I'll be back before you know it...

1112
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:51,780
...so you go get ready. we'll go see those chimpanzees.

1113
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:57,220
Sarah.

1114
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,420
what are you doing?

1115
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:05,090
we each of us have our vices.

1116
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:11,910
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1117
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,670
...your only competition for my affections is our little girl.

1118
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:20,180
I love you. I will always love you and you alone.

1119
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,420
-You mean it today.
-Absolutely.

1120
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:29,560
which makes it so much harder when you don't.

1121
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,970
Is that more shopping? She does love the smell of money.

1122
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,580
The little lady wants to go to the zoo, so I thought you could take her.

1123
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:48,740
Yeah? I mean, I can do it tomorrow if not.

1124
01:27:48,910 --> 01:27:54,370
And Sarah, she knows.

1125
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:58,420
She... I mean, at least she knows that something's not right, so...

1126
01:27:58,790 --> 01:28:02,050
...if you can just do whatever you can to help me with her.

1127
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:06,160
Talk to her. Just convince her that I do love her.

1128
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:21,120
-what is it, Freddy?
-Just don't call me that, please.

1129
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:23,410
It's nothing. It's just, you know, there's sometimes....

1130
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,280
-Sometimes it seems wrong.
-I've told you before...

1131
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,000
...when you're with me, you're with me.

1132
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:30,550
Leave your family at home where they belong.

1133
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,420
I'm trying.

1134
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:34,080
I'm trying, olivia.

1135
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:36,750
-I'll get dressed.
-Yeah.

1136
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:41,160
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1137
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:43,590
There's something about that man I don't trust.

1138
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,730
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

1139
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,470
He protects the things that I care about.

1140
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:30,110
we're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1141
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,840
we were sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave as well.

1142
01:29:33,020 --> 01:29:35,010
He was very good to colorado Springs.

1143
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:41,460
Mr. Angier, I didn't think it was necessary to tell Edison's men about the box.

1144
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,150
what box?

1145
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:11,950
I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye...

1146
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:16,590
...but I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado.

1147
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:21,800
The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry.

1148
01:30:21,970 --> 01:30:27,400
Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified.

1149
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:31,470
You will find what you are looking for in this box.

1150
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:35,940
Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions.

1151
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:40,740
I add only one suggestion on using the machine:

1152
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:42,850
Destroy it.

1153
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,120
Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean.

1154
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:49,490
Such a thing will bring you only misery.

1155
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:57,090
Tesla's warning is as unheeded as he knew it would be.

1156
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:59,200
Today, I tested the machine...

1157
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:03,830
...taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't ironed out the kinks in its operation.

1158
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:08,840
I mean, if it went wrong, I would not wanna live like that for long.

1159
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,530
But here at the Turn, I must leave you, Borden.

1160
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,860
Yes, you, Borden.

1161
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,270
Sitting there in your cell...

1162
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:40,470
...reading my diary, awaiting your death...

1163
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:42,700
...for my murder.

1164
01:31:47,890 --> 01:31:51,120
Angier's journal, that gesture of good faith, that's a fake.

1165
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:55,250
I assure you, it's not. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt.

1166
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:59,990
And it's written in Angier's own hand, of which we had numerous examples.

1167
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:03,730
It don't matter.

1168
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,700
So my tricks.

1169
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:14,740
-All of them.
-Including The Transported Man?

1170
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,880
well, Lord caldlow will be very pleased indeed.

1171
01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:21,540
No, he won't. Because they're not complete.

1172
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:24,310
It's just the Pledge and the Turn for each.

1173
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:27,080
without the Prestige for these tricks...

1174
01:32:27,690 --> 01:32:30,020
-...these are worthless.
-Yeah.

1175
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:34,150
You get the rest of it when you bring my daughter here.

1176
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:39,090
I wanna say goodbye.

1177
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:42,700
we have to go through it now.

1178
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:45,040
Listen, we have to go through it now. Now, listen to me.

1179
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:46,470
Deny it all you want.

1180
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,940
olivia means nothing.

1181
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:51,810
-I need an assistant.
-No, I'll go to her.

1182
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:53,680
-I'll tell her I know...
-Tell her what?

1183
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:57,550
I know what you really are, Alfred. I....

1184
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,960
-I know, and I...
-Sarah, Sarah.

1185
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,390
-I can't keep it in.
-Sarah, You can't talk like this.

1186
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,190
Sarah, shut up.

1187
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,990
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

1188
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:10,190
You can't talk like this!

1189
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:14,960
You can't hide it anymore because I know, Alfred, I know.

1190
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:16,830
I know what you really are!

1191
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:18,700
Alfred...

1192
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,570
...I can't live like this.

1193
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,710
oh, well, you think I can live like this?

1194
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:27,210
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?

1195
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:30,280
-Stop it and listen! No!
-we have this beautiful house...

1196
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:33,220
...lovely little girl, we're married. what is so wrong with your life?

1197
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:35,880
Alfred, I can't live like this!

1198
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:38,920
well, what do you want from me?

1199
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:45,200
I want....

1200
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,500
I want you to be honest with me.

1201
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:53,240
No tricks...

1202
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,280
...no lies...

1203
01:33:57,650 --> 01:34:00,670
...and no secrets.

1204
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:09,620
Do you...? Do you love me?

1205
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:14,190
Not today.

1206
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,230
No.

1207
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,190
who's there?

1208
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:01,100
I'm looking for an old friend.

1209
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:02,900
I heard about a booking.

1210
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:05,830
Nice little theater. Good up-and-coming magician.

1211
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:08,380
-You're back.
-It's good to see you, John.

1212
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:11,910
Good rehearsal space.

1213
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,710
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1214
01:36:14,890 --> 01:36:17,320
You always had a good eye for publicity.

1215
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:18,850
I need your help, John.

1216
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:21,720
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1217
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:23,720
Your last show?

1218
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,420
A wise man once told me obsession was a young man's game.

1219
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:28,990
I'm almost done.

1220
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:31,330
There's one thing left.

1221
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,770
The Real Transported Man.

1222
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:38,610
You wanna design a show around it.

1223
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:41,540
I don't want you backstage. I need you front of house, managing.

1224
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:44,240
I need you to call in favors or connections you have...

1225
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:48,010
-...to get us the right booking for the run.
-what sort of booking you after?

1226
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:50,420
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1227
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:00,520
what an honor it is to see you again, sir.

1228
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:04,030
You told me you only wanted to show me one trick. It piqued my interest.

1229
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,260
-It's a very clever trick, Mr. Ackerman.
-Pleased to meet you.

1230
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,270
Likewise, I'm sure. well, let's get on, shall we?

1231
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:16,110
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1232
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:22,040
very pretty.

1233
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,670
That's it, cutter? He simply disappears?

1234
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:39,670
That's not a trick. well, he has to come back.

1235
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,500
There has to be a...

1236
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:42,500
-A Prestige?
-Exactly.

1237
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:47,470
Pardon me.

1238
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,680
It's very rare to see...

1239
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:53,550
...real magic.

1240
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:58,010
-Yes, it's been many years since I've seen...
-Are you interested in helping us?

1241
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,690
Yes.

1242
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:04,630
But you'll have to dress it up a little.

1243
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:07,920
Disguise it.

1244
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,970
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1245
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:16,030
You haven't spoken about her, Freddy. Not once.

1246
01:38:16,210 --> 01:38:19,800
why would I talk about her to you?

1247
01:38:20,180 --> 01:38:22,370
Because she was a part of your life.

1248
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:23,710
And now she's gone.

1249
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:30,920
You know, the day before she killed herself, she said she wanted to meet me.

1250
01:38:31,390 --> 01:38:34,190
That she had something to tell me about you.

1251
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,690
I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1252
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:39,520
But...

1253
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:42,900
...what would she have said?

1254
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:45,970
You wanna know the truth about me?

1255
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:50,600
Truth is that...

1256
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,000
...I never loved Sarah.

1257
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:56,700
I never loved her.

1258
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,210
-You married her. You had a child with her.
-Yes, yes. Part of me.

1259
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:04,080
Part of me did, but the other part didn't.

1260
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,590
The part that found you. The part that's sitting here right now.

1261
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:09,720
I love you.

1262
01:39:10,190 --> 01:39:13,600
No, olivia, I love you. That's the truth.

1263
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,160
That is the truth that matters.

1264
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:20,570
You could be in some other restaurant with some other woman right now...

1265
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,330
...talking about me that way.

1266
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:24,500
-No.
-Yes.

1267
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:32,650
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1268
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:41,620
He's back. After two years.

1269
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:45,460
He's got a new trick. They're saying it's the best London's ever seen.

1270
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:51,200
You should see the look on your face, Professor.

1271
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:54,030
You should go to him.

1272
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:56,570
You two deserve each other.

1273
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:05,780
I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet, they'll be playing through next year.

1274
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,240
Then get rid of them. There'll be a hundred performances.

1275
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,110
No more, no less.

1276
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:12,720
Five performances a week. No matinees.

1277
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:17,560
And that's what you'll be charging for each ticket. Good day.

1278
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:42,690
Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening...

1279
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:45,680
...is one that involves considerable risk.

1280
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:49,090
Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocably damaged...

1281
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:52,090
...by seeing a man drown should leave now.

1282
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:55,030
For when I tell you the young lady who taught me this illusion...

1283
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,940
...actually died performing it...

1284
01:40:56,970 --> 01:41:00,360
...you will understand the seriousness of the dangers involved.

1285
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:04,340
Let's begin.

1286
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:18,090
In my travels, I have seen the future...

1287
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:22,060
...and it is a strange future indeed.

1288
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,820
The world, ladies and gentlemen...

1289
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,300
...is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities.

1290
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:54,020
what you're about to witness is not magic.

1291
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:55,660
It is purely science.

1292
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:58,160
I would like to invite you to come up on-stage now...

1293
01:41:58,230 --> 01:42:01,530
...so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1294
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:00,180
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

1295
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:01,550
Bravo!

1296
01:43:04,530 --> 01:43:07,120
Bravo! Bravo!

1297
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:14,130
Bravo. Bravo.

1298
01:43:22,380 --> 01:43:24,040
one hundred performances.

1299
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:26,510
why? Does his method dictate that?

1300
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:28,580
Is it a publicity move? what is it?

1301
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:33,450
He's a no-talent magician, and they're calling him the bloody best in England. why?

1302
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:36,290
Fifty yards in a second. In a second!

1303
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,430
And all that we know is he uses a trap door.

1304
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:43,790
Brilliant. what is going on under that stage?

1305
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:46,770
why can't you outthink him?

1306
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:03,010
They do this every night?

1307
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:06,350
After each performance, yeah?

1308
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:38,350
we're done.

1309
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,960
All right?

1310
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:44,020
Let him have his trick.

1311
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:46,630
I don't need... I don't need his secret.

1312
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,360
So...

1313
01:44:49,730 --> 01:44:52,600
...don't go back there, you leave him alone.

1314
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,970
Both of us, just leave him alone.

1315
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:57,610
we're done.

1316
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:08,520
I told you, John...

1317
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:10,620
...I don't want you backstage on this one.

1318
01:45:12,490 --> 01:45:14,590
I would like to invite you to come up on-stage now...

1319
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:17,190
...so that you can examine the machine for yourselves.

1320
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:50,620
-Hey, you, where do you think you're going?
-I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1321
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:01,430
who was that?

1322
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,420
Hey!

1323
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:02,690
where's the bloody key? where's the bloody key?

1324
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:05,130
The blind man's got it!

1325
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:08,860
where's the bloody key? Bloody drowning!

1326
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,180
Hold on!

1327
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:25,880
what have you done?

1328
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:53,150
Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.

1329
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:56,950
You will be hanged by the neck until dead.

1330
01:47:57,750 --> 01:48:00,750
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1331
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:04,160
Mr. cutter?

1332
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:06,190
owens.

1333
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,060
oh, thank you for coming, Mr. owens.

1334
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:13,530
It has fallen to me to dispose of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1335
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,300
But I noticed from this manifest...

1336
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:18,930
...that Lord caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.

1337
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:22,850
Mr. cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver these items, surely you...

1338
01:48:22,910 --> 01:48:26,510
No, no. It's just there is one particular item...

1339
01:48:26,780 --> 01:48:30,710
...this item, in fact, that I would like to...

1340
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:32,880
-You would like to...?
-Buy.

1341
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:34,990
-Buy yourself?
-Yeah, I suppose so.

1342
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:38,160
-This is the machine?
-Yes.

1343
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:42,770
well, I'm afraid Lord caldlow was adamant about purchasing this particular item.

1344
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:45,930
Do you think I could talk to Lord caldlow in person?

1345
01:48:46,370 --> 01:48:48,770
out of the question, I'm afraid.

1346
01:48:51,310 --> 01:48:53,070
of course...

1347
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:56,140
...I suppose if, in the course of your delivery arrangements...

1348
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:58,750
...your paths were to cross...

1349
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:03,080
-...I can't stop you speaking your mind.
-Thank you.

1350
01:49:04,590 --> 01:49:06,780
-Still here, Borden?
-For now.

1351
01:49:07,540 --> 01:49:08,780
Got a visitor.

1352
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,150
Lord caldlow.

1353
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:12,590
with a little girl.

1354
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,700
Jess?

1355
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:24,360
Hello, my love.

1356
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,940
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1357
01:49:28,110 --> 01:49:30,140
And Fallon's missed you too. we both have.

1358
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:32,540
Daddy, can I come in there?

1359
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,680
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1360
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:39,380
No, but everything is gonna be all right.

1361
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:42,490
-You must be Lord caldlow.
-caldlow.

1362
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:43,950
Yes, I am.

1363
01:49:44,130 --> 01:49:45,290
I always have been.

1364
01:49:50,370 --> 01:49:52,490
They flatter you with all those chains, Alfred.

1365
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:55,640
Don't they know you can't escape without your little rubber ball?

1366
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:56,930
I pulled you out.

1367
01:49:57,110 --> 01:49:58,630
out of that tank.

1368
01:49:58,810 --> 01:50:02,470
All I wanted to do was prove that I was a better magician...

1369
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:04,510
...but you couldn't leave me alone.

1370
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:08,380
I don't know what you've done...

1371
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:13,750
...but you're not afraid to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1372
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,760
No, not anymore.

1373
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:17,150
And I win.

1374
01:50:17,330 --> 01:50:20,520
Because no one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.

1375
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:21,690
You win?

1376
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:27,640
This ain't a bloody competition anymore, Angier, this is my little girl's life.

1377
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,860
And don't you dare put her in the middle of this.

1378
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,870
oh, I know how hard it is to have someone so special...

1379
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:36,670
...taken away from me, don't I, Borden?

1380
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:40,140
And you can't take her with you now, can you?

1381
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,080
oh, she'll be looked after.

1382
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:46,750
-Goodbye, Professor. come on, darling.
-No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Look.

1383
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,220
Here.

1384
01:50:49,690 --> 01:50:51,420
That's what you're after.

1385
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:53,690
That's what this is about.

1386
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,230
Take it.

1387
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:57,230
-Your secret?
-Yeah.

1388
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:02,640
You always were the better magician.

1389
01:51:02,810 --> 01:51:04,300
we both know that.

1390
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:08,170
But whatever your secret was, I mean, you have to agree...

1391
01:51:08,410 --> 01:51:09,440
...mine is better.

1392
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:14,550
Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier, no. Jess, Jess, Jess.

1393
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:18,210
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon. I promise.

1394
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:21,260
-For God's sake, Borden.
-I promise. Look.

1395
01:51:24,830 --> 01:51:26,130
I promise.

1396
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:29,930
-I love you, Jess. I love you.
-come on.

1397
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:33,300
-come on. come on.
-I love you. I love you, Jess.

1398
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:35,800
Angier. Angier!

1399
01:51:35,970 --> 01:51:37,960
what, you think this place can hold me?

1400
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:41,010
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1401
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:44,270
They're gonna bloody hang me! You can put a stop to this now!

1402
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:46,740
-Listen! Listen! That man...!
-Just shut up.

1403
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:49,050
Listen, that man is the one I'm meant to have killed!

1404
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,250
You blind bastard, listen to me!

1405
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:53,360
-If he's alive, I'm not guilty!
-Guards!

1406
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:55,980
-I'm not guilty!
-I don't care! Get hold of him!

1407
01:51:56,060 --> 01:51:57,850
-Goodbye, Professor.
-Angier!

1408
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,290
Run along now.

1409
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:08,760
Sir. There's a gentleman waiting.

1410
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:25,650
Dear God.

1411
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:28,120
Hello, cutter.

1412
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:30,630
You're... You're still alive.

1413
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:32,560
How is it you're still alive, Robert?

1414
01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:35,030
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1415
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:40,060
-child.
-Good night, sir.

1416
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:42,030
Good night, Jess.

1417
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:45,030
I've seen her before.

1418
01:52:45,310 --> 01:52:50,510
I saw her in court with Fallon.

1419
01:52:52,380 --> 01:52:54,870
-what have you done?
-well, she needs looking after.

1420
01:52:55,050 --> 01:52:57,320
She needs her father.

1421
01:52:57,820 --> 01:53:00,450
You're letting him hang, and I helped you.

1422
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:06,530
I came here to beg Lord caldlow to let me destroy that machine.

1423
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:10,290
I am not gonna beg you for anything.

1424
01:53:10,870 --> 01:53:13,730
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure that machine's never used again.

1425
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:19,140
Then, Lord caldlow...

1426
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,580
...where do you want me to deliver it?

1427
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:24,110
My theater.

1428
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:26,410
It belongs with the Prestige materials.

1429
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:29,540
John, I tried not to involve you.

1430
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:44,400
So...

1431
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:48,800
...we go alone now.

1432
01:53:49,470 --> 01:53:51,340
Both of us.

1433
01:53:54,780 --> 01:53:58,210
only I don't have as far to go as you.

1434
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:05,110
No.

1435
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:09,620
You were right, I should have left him to his damn trick.

1436
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:12,920
I'm sorry.

1437
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:17,100
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1438
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:20,360
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1439
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:23,770
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1440
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:25,870
I didn't.

1441
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:30,140
You go live your life in full now, all right?

1442
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:31,840
You live for both of us.

1443
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:42,120
Goodbye.

1444
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:30,200
Are you watching closely?

1445
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,660
Put it down the end.

1446
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:41,400
Take a minute to consider your achievement.

1447
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:46,940
I once told you about a sailor who described drowning to me.

1448
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:49,210
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1449
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:55,160
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1450
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:35,870
Alfred Borden...

1451
01:57:36,370 --> 01:57:40,000
...this day, in the name of the king and the High court of England...

1452
01:57:40,370 --> 01:57:42,430
...you will meet your end.

1453
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:47,010
No one cares about the man in the box.

1454
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:52,710
cutter?

1455
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,010
cutter?

1456
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:04,220
Do you have anything to say?

1457
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:09,230
Abracadabra.

1458
01:58:45,970 --> 01:58:47,340
A brother.

1459
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:48,990
A twin.

1460
01:58:50,370 --> 01:58:55,580
You were Fallon the whole time.

1461
01:58:55,850 --> 01:58:56,870
No.

1462
01:58:57,980 --> 01:59:00,280
we were both Fallon.

1463
01:59:00,450 --> 01:59:01,910
And we were both Borden.

1464
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:10,590
were you...? were you the one who went into the box...

1465
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:12,560
...or the one who came back out?

1466
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:15,920
we took turns.

1467
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:22,790
The trick is where we would swap.

1468
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:33,570
cutter knew. cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple, too easy.

1469
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:36,380
No.

1470
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:38,990
Simple maybe, but not easy.

1471
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:42,920
There's nothing easy about two men sharing one life.

1472
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:50,760
I don't understand how it can be bleeding again.

1473
01:59:55,770 --> 01:59:57,930
what about olivia? And your wife?

1474
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,840
we each loved one of them.

1475
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:06,570
I loved Sarah.

1476
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:09,850
He loved Olivia.

1477
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:15,450
we each had half of a full life, really, which was enough for us.

1478
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:17,390
Just.

1479
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:20,990
But not for them.

1480
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:28,330
See, sacrifice, Robert, that's the price of a good trick.

1481
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:33,600
But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?

1482
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:38,380
I've made sacrifices.

1483
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:40,310
-No.
-Yes.

1484
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:43,890
It takes nothing to steal another man's work.

1485
02:00:45,090 --> 02:00:46,680
It takes everything.

1486
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,800
No. No. No, wait! I'm the...!

1487
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:18,080
It took courage.

1488
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:23,420
It took courage to climb into that machine every night...

1489
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:29,220
...not knowing if I'd be the man in the box...

1490
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:33,160
...or in the Prestige.

1491
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:39,600
Do you wanna...? Do you wanna see what it cost me?

1492
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:43,200
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1493
02:01:43,810 --> 02:01:46,010
Look. Look.

1494
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:49,110
I don't care.

1495
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:56,050
You went halfway around the world.

1496
02:01:57,060 --> 02:01:59,990
You spent a fortune.

1497
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:04,200
You did terrible things.

1498
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:08,200
Really terrible things, Robert.

1499
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:11,370
And all for nothing.

1500
02:02:12,610 --> 02:02:15,300
-For nothing?
-Yeah.

1501
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:23,450
You never understood why we did this.

1502
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:29,620
The audience knows the truth.

1503
02:02:30,230 --> 02:02:34,220
The world is simple. It's miserable.

1504
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,490
Solid all the way through.

1505
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:45,000
But if you could fool them, even for a second...

1506
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:49,270
...then you could make them wonder.

1507
02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:51,940
And then you....

1508
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:56,840
Then you got to see something very special.

1509
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:02,990
You really don't know?

1510
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:11,960
It was... It was the look on their faces.

1511
02:03:27,150 --> 02:03:32,140
Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts.

1512
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:38,660
The first part is called the Pledge.

1513
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:41,720
The magician shows you something ordinary.

1514
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:46,600
The second act is called the Turn.

1515
02:03:47,070 --> 02:03:49,960
The magician takes the ordinary something...

1516
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:53,070
...and makes it into something extraordinary.

1517
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:56,140
But you wouldn't clap yet...

1518
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:59,370
...because making something disappear isn't enough.

1519
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:03,510
You have to bring it back.

1520
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:08,920
Hey.

1521
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:39,980
Now you're looking for the secret.

1522
02:04:42,260 --> 02:04:47,160
But you won't find it because, of course, you're not really looking.

1523
02:04:49,170 --> 02:04:52,260
You don't really want to work it out.

1524
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,640
You want to be fooled.
