1
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,009
M doesn't really mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:24,243
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,757
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:35,827
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:39,030
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,967
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,569
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,439
...I'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,841
...wouldn't I?

10
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:57,236
- Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
- Two.

11
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,294
Shame.

12
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:18,864
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,208
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,578
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,604
True.

16
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,049
How did he die?

17
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,218
Your contact?

18
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,208
Not well.

19
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:24,059
Made you feel it, did he?

20
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,400
Well...

21
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,374
...you needn't worry.

22
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,867
The second is...

23
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:36,778
Yes.

24
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:42,540
Considerably.

25
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:37,388
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

26
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,024
You asked for the introduction.

27
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:45,155
That's all my organization
will guarantee.

28
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,536
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

29
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:28,006
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

30
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:33,603
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

31
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,982
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

32
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,610
No.

33
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,687
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.

34
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,156
I want no risk in the portfolio.

35
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,419
Agreed.

36
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,726
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?

37
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:49,819
Yes.

38
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,215
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

39
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,084
...of Skyfleet stock.

40
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:17,155
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

41
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,525
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

42
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:26,122
Just do it.

43
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:03,034
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

44
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:08,563
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

45
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,553
He's on the move.

46
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:25,857
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

47
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,126
Stop touching your ear.

48
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:33,086
- Sorry?
- Put your hand down.

49
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:42,059
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

50
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:13,510
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

51
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:15,879
...my dear general.

52
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,042
Nothing sinister.

53
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,785
All in.

54
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,927
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

55
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:34,921
...of making your straight.

56
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,991
When does Ellipsis expire?

57
00:21:00,992 --> 00:21:04,361
- We have less than 36 hours. I can...
- No. No, no.

58
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:08,832
That's all the time I have anyway.

59
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,235
Give our guests
five minutes to leave...

60
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:16,434
...or throw them overboard.

61
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,051
Who the hell do they think they are?

62
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,753
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

63
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:31,155
...not to ask me what we do.

64
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:35,059
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

65
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,162
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

66
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,931
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?

67
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:44,001
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

68
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,603
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

69
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:49,339
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

70
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,175
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

71
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,907
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

72
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,488
You've got a bloody cheek.

73
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:12,979
Sorry.

74
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,192
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

75
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,060
Or yourself.

76
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:19,296
You stormed into an embassy.

77
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,032
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

78
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,834
...of international relationships.

79
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,969
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

80
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,173
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.

81
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,276
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

82
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,335
I did.

83
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,747
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

84
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,082
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

85
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:42,786
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

86
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:44,488
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

87
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,824
Hardly the big picture,
wouldn't you say?

88
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,260
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

89
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:52,296
And thanks to your trigger finger...

90
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,365
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

91
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:57,901
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

92
00:23:57,902 --> 00:23:59,703
The same way
I found out your name.

93
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,840
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for...

94
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,810
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

95
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:10,047
I knew it was too early
to promote you.

96
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:14,184
Well, I understand double-Os
have a very short life-expectancy...

97
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:19,280
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

98
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:27,731
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

99
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:31,735
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

100
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,638
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

101
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,707
Any thug can kill.

102
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,309
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

103
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,713
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

104
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:47,117
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

105
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:50,854
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

106
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:53,090
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

107
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,658
...and think about your future.

108
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,761
Because these bastards
want your head.

109
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:04,120
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

110
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:13,464
And Bond...

111
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:17,547
...don't ever break into
my house again.

112
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:19,448
Ma'am.

113
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:37,889
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

114
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,228
Hey. Hey.

115
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,039
Hello.

116
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,416
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

117
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:04,785
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

118
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,432
Security to car park.
Security to car park.

119
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:53,028
Absolutely incredible.

120
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,935
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

121
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,572
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

122
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:36,972
Okay.

123
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:44,743
- We have an ocean-view villa.
- Perfect.

124
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:47,417
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

125
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:51,588
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

126
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,890
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know...?

127
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:56,960
- Mr. Dimitrios.
- Right.

128
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,462
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

129
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:02,032
Isn't the type
to take bad news well.

130
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:06,136
But if I felt compelled to find him?

131
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,906
He has a house just up the beach.

132
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,204
Thank you.

133
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:15,205
- What?
- He's in the Bahamas.

134
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,841
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?

135
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,010
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

136
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,279
...using your name and password.

137
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,348
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

138
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:27,917
Well, I'm doing my best to find out.

139
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:32,188
- Who's he looking at?
- Alex Dimitrios.

140
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:36,716
That slimy bugger.

141
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:49,202
Now known associates...

142
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:02,348
Le Chiffre.

143
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:19,469
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

144
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,404
How can I assist you, sir?

145
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:24,507
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

146
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,676
- Look what just happened.
- Good job, big boy.

147
00:32:26,677 --> 00:32:27,905
Yeah.

148
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:36,953
Do you mind if I join?

149
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:42,084
- Oh, good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

150
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,969
Small blind, big blind.

151
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,631
I'm in.

152
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:01,411
Bet's to you.

153
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:05,782
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

154
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:10,913
Two hundred to you.

155
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,357
Bet's to you.

156
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,493
I heard you.

157
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:21,157
Five to call.

158
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,366
- Action's to you.
- Pair of sevens.

159
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:24,732
Ace high.

160
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,071
Check or bet.

161
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,773
- Check.
- And to you.

162
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:34,608
Five thousand.

163
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,011
Five to call.

164
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:53,129
- Check.
- Check to you, sir.

165
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,324
All in.

166
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,796
No, wait.

167
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,002
Twenty thousand.

168
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:03,973
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:09,679
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

170
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,748
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

171
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:17,641
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

172
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:29,591
All right, show me, gentlemen.

173
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:36,035
Three kings.

174
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,277
There you go with my night.

175
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:42,677
Trip aces.

176
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,973
Aces win.

177
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,916
Oh, and the valet ticket.

178
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:55,791
Thank you.

179
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,460
Sir.

180
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,996
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

181
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:37,400
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.

182
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,801
My mistake.

183
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:40,737
Can I give you a lift home?

184
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,307
That would really send him
over the edge.

185
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,543
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

186
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:51,435
Well, perhaps you're just
out of practice.

187
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,617
Perhaps.

188
00:35:57,821 --> 00:36:00,456
Well, what about
a drink at my place?

189
00:36:00,457 --> 00:36:02,892
Your place?

190
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:08,626
- Is it close?
- Very.

191
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,001
One drink.

192
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,130
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.

193
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:45,931
Welcome to my home.

194
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,548
I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.

195
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,417
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

196
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:07,724
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

197
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,493
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

198
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,162
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

199
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:16,099
But I do care about my reputation.

200
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,534
I have someone else
willing to do the job.

201
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:21,170
He just needs the particulars...

202
00:37:21,171 --> 00:37:25,834
...and payment.

203
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,754
You like married women,
don't you, James?

204
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:42,850
It keeps things simple.

205
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,895
What is it about bad men?

206
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:49,065
You, my husband...

207
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,934
I had so many chances
to be happy...

208
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:54,504
...so many nice guys.

209
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,407
Why can't nice guys
be more like you?

210
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:00,576
Well, because then they'd be bad.

211
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:02,841
Yes.

212
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:11,315
But so much more interesting.

213
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:15,491
What makes your husband
a bad man?

214
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:18,261
His nature, I suppose.

215
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,129
The nature of his work?

216
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,467
A mystery, I'm afraid.

217
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:29,972
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

218
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:33,009
How afraid?

219
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:38,708
Not enough to stop.

220
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:47,223
Can I ask you a personal question?

221
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:51,094
Now would seem
an appropriate time.

222
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:56,361
Does "ellipsis"
mean anything to you?

223
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:04,974
Should I ask him about it?

224
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,277
Perhaps later.

225
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:09,438
Yes, dear?

226
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:11,748
I'm on the last flight
tonight to Miami.

227
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,584
Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.

228
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,120
Okay, I understand.

229
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:21,424
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

230
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:26,028
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

231
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:33,035
...so you have all night
to question me.

232
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:34,704
In that case...

233
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,038
...we're gonna need...

234
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:41,305
...some more champagne.

235
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:45,915
Good evening. Room Service.

236
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:49,919
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

237
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,354
...and the beluga caviar?

238
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,023
- With everything?
- Yes, with everything.

239
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:56,325
- And would that be for two, sir?
- What?

240
00:39:56,326 --> 00:40:02,491
- For two?
- No, for one.

241
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,425
Wait here.

242
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:44,565
There you go. Number 53.

243
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:48,211
Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...

244
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:51,247
...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...

245
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:55,911
...nervous and vascular systems.

246
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:58,648
Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

247
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:02,118
I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.

248
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:06,179
This is edutainment.

249
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:32,048
...fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...

250
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:38,783
...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.

251
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:51,557
Hello.

252
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:53,668
Hello.

253
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,048
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.

254
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:08,818
Welcome to Miami
International Airport.

255
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:14,847
Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted...

256
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,152
- Yes.
- It's Bond. I need her now.

257
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:53,089
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

258
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,559
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

259
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,595
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

260
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:05,158
- Sorry, can I put you on hold?
- I thought you might.

261
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:12,274
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

262
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:16,164
I'll call you back.

263
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,601
- The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
- What about it?

264
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:44,733
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

265
00:46:23,246 --> 00:46:24,480
Oh, my God!

266
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:28,973
Bond? Bond!

267
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:31,387
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

268
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:36,222
It's launching today.

269
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:40,419
I gotta go.

270
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:07,488
Stop! Stop!

271
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:12,122
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

272
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:47,322
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

273
00:53:47,323 --> 00:53:55,627
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

274
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:04,329
Someone talked.

275
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,362
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah, I have.

276
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:32,322
I'm gonna get a few more photos...

277
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:47,649
Quite the body count
you're stacking up.

278
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:50,585
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

279
00:54:50,586 --> 00:54:53,922
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

280
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:56,224
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

281
00:54:56,225 --> 00:54:57,192
No.

282
00:54:57,393 --> 00:55:01,063
- Not your name, what you were after?
- No.

283
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,698
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

284
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,666
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons...

285
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,301
...and people who could use them.

286
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:08,136
He worked with anyone
who had money.

287
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:11,707
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

288
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,809
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

289
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:17,479
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

290
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,448
Oh, good. You're here.

291
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,217
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

292
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:29,680
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

293
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,887
So you can keep an eye on me?

294
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,378
Yes.

295
00:56:05,294 --> 00:56:08,630
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9l11...

296
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:12,768
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

297
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:16,671
When the stocks hit bottom on 9l12,
somebody made a fortune.

298
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:19,441
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

299
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,876
...or was supposed to.

300
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,846
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

301
00:56:24,847 --> 00:56:29,885
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

302
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,987
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

303
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:35,123
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

304
00:56:35,124 --> 00:56:37,025
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

305
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:41,296
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

306
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:44,266
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

307
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:47,035
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

308
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,204
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

309
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:53,675
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

310
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:57,279
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

311
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,315
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

312
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:01,883
We can't let him win this game.

313
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:04,319
If he loses,
he'll have nowhere to run.

314
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,355
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

315
00:57:07,356 --> 00:57:09,291
I'm putting you in the game...

316
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:12,160
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

317
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:16,131
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

318
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:20,863
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

319
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:27,142
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

320
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:31,012
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

321
00:57:31,013 --> 00:57:32,844
No.

322
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:37,786
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

323
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,287
We'll know where you are.

324
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:41,523
You can stop pretending.

325
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,726
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

326
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:49,925
Well, I knew you were you.

327
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:07,276
Thank you.

328
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,959
I'm the money.

329
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,663
Every penny of it.

330
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:25,133
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

331
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:26,795
"Vesper."

332
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,272
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

333
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,706
Thank you.

334
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,775
Your boss must be well-connected.

335
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,811
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

336
00:58:36,812 --> 00:58:40,548
Or quite so stylishly.

337
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:42,183
May I ask you where it is?

338
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:44,920
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

339
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:49,457
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

340
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:52,694
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

341
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:58,496
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

342
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:03,267
What looks good?

343
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,612
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

344
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,781
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

345
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:15,984
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

346
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:20,785
So that would be
what you call "bluffing"?

347
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:22,958
You've heard the term.

348
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,660
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

349
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:27,228
You play the man across from you.

350
00:59:27,229 --> 00:59:29,798
- And you're good at reading people?
- Yes, I am.

351
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,700
Which is why
I've been able to detect...

352
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:34,536
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

353
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:38,473
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

354
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,875
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

355
00:59:40,876 --> 00:59:42,577
So there is a plan?

356
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:45,347
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

357
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:47,782
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

358
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:50,018
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

359
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,387
About you, Miss Lynd?

360
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,456
Well, your beauty's a problem.

361
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,658
You worry you won't
be taken seriously.

362
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,861
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

363
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,629
True, but this one
overcompensates...

364
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,665
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

365
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:06,234
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

366
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:08,903
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

367
01:00:08,904 --> 01:00:12,440
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

368
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:14,843
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

369
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:18,113
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

370
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:22,350
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

371
01:00:22,351 --> 01:00:25,653
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

372
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:31,216
...I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

373
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:33,227
All right.

374
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:36,865
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

375
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:39,434
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

376
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,536
But you wear it with such disdain...

377
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:43,638
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

378
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:46,408
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

379
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,543
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

380
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,613
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

381
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:54,315
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

382
01:00:54,316 --> 01:00:59,207
...that's what I'd say you are.

383
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,724
Oh, you are.

384
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:04,759
I like this poker thing.

385
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,728
And that makes perfect sense...

386
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:09,330
...since Ml6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

387
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:11,800
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

388
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:14,202
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

389
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:15,503
You know...

390
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:19,941
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

391
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:22,510
- Rolex?
- Omega.

392
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:24,342
Beautiful.

393
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,714
Now, having just met you...

394
01:01:26,715 --> 01:01:29,751
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

395
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:31,319
No, of course not.

396
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,221
But it wouldn't be a stretch
to imagine.

397
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,590
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

398
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:39,160
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

399
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:41,496
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

400
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:44,132
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

401
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,568
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

402
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,303
You noticed?

403
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,505
Even accountants have imagination.

404
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:52,240
How was your lamb?

405
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,799
Skewered.

406
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:57,479
One sympathizes.

407
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,180
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

408
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:04,413
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

409
01:02:17,032 --> 01:02:22,270
- Hotel Splendid, sir?
- That's right.

410
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:27,401
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

411
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:42,524
It's just last-minute details.

412
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,993
Apparently we're very much in love.

413
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:48,163
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

414
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:51,266
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

415
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,435
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

416
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:56,204
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

417
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,606
- I am not.
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.

418
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:00,775
Oh, no, I don't.

419
01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:03,272
We've been involved
for quite a while...

420
01:03:03,273 --> 01:03:05,241
...hence the shared suite.

421
01:03:05,242 --> 01:03:07,810
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic...

422
01:03:07,811 --> 01:03:10,746
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

423
01:03:10,747 --> 01:03:14,316
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

424
01:03:14,317 --> 01:03:16,919
Religion and a securely locked door.

425
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,088
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

426
01:03:19,089 --> 01:03:22,091
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

427
01:03:22,092 --> 01:03:23,184
Smart?

428
01:03:23,794 --> 01:03:25,489
Single.

429
01:03:44,714 --> 01:03:46,916
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

430
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:49,985
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

431
01:03:49,986 --> 01:03:53,355
- Welcome, Mr. Bond.
- You sign that, dear.

432
01:03:53,356 --> 01:03:58,588
You represent the Treasury.

433
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:02,898
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

434
01:04:02,899 --> 01:04:07,391
I will. Thank you.

435
01:04:07,504 --> 01:04:08,871
Very funny.

436
01:04:08,872 --> 01:04:11,040
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

437
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,309
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

438
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,744
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

439
01:04:15,745 --> 01:04:18,314
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

440
01:04:18,315 --> 01:04:20,816
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

441
01:04:20,817 --> 01:04:23,652
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

442
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:25,488
And now he knows
something about you.

443
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:28,290
He knows you're reckless.

444
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:30,326
Take the next one.

445
01:04:30,327 --> 01:04:33,596
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

446
01:04:33,597 --> 01:04:35,155
Mr. Bond?

447
01:04:35,365 --> 01:04:40,597
- It was left for you.
- Thank you.

448
01:05:08,832 --> 01:05:13,256
I love you too, M.

449
01:05:49,539 --> 01:05:57,638
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

450
01:05:58,248 --> 01:06:00,015
Does he know
we've been watching him?

451
01:06:00,016 --> 01:06:02,885
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

452
01:06:02,886 --> 01:06:07,856
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

453
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:10,025
I'm afraid if you get
into trouble here...

454
01:06:10,026 --> 01:06:15,297
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

455
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:17,533
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

456
01:06:17,534 --> 01:06:21,670
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

457
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:24,807
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

458
01:06:24,808 --> 01:06:26,909
That's him, with the mustache.

459
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:29,545
Over my left shoulder.

460
01:06:29,546 --> 01:06:31,947
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

461
01:06:31,948 --> 01:06:34,116
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

462
01:06:34,117 --> 01:06:36,952
He's not a very subtle man.

463
01:06:36,953 --> 01:06:40,322
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

464
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:46,420
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

465
01:06:51,635 --> 01:06:53,002
I hate to say it...

466
01:06:53,003 --> 01:06:58,040
...but the accountants seem
to be running Ml6 these days.

467
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:01,443
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

468
01:07:01,444 --> 01:07:05,247
Many of them are lovely people.

469
01:07:05,248 --> 01:07:08,550
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

470
01:07:08,551 --> 01:07:12,354
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

471
01:07:12,355 --> 01:07:19,589
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

472
01:07:19,629 --> 01:07:25,157
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

473
01:07:27,737 --> 01:07:29,102
Yes?

474
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:31,434
For you.

475
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:37,579
Something you expect me to wear?

476
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,114
I need you looking fabulous.

477
01:07:39,115 --> 01:07:41,617
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

478
01:07:41,618 --> 01:07:44,186
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

479
01:07:44,187 --> 01:07:46,121
...and not about their cards.

480
01:07:46,122 --> 01:07:48,724
Do you think you can
do that for me?

481
01:07:48,725 --> 01:07:51,727
I'll do my best.

482
01:07:51,728 --> 01:07:53,662
Thank you.

483
01:08:05,675 --> 01:08:08,110
I have a dinner jacket.

484
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:10,646
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

485
01:08:10,647 --> 01:08:12,014
This is the latter.

486
01:08:12,015 --> 01:08:15,651
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

487
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:17,279
How...?

488
01:08:18,088 --> 01:08:19,755
It's tailored.

489
01:08:19,756 --> 01:08:25,216
I sized you up the moment we met.

490
01:09:16,012 --> 01:09:20,582
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

491
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:22,244
Thank you.

492
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:35,364
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

493
01:09:35,365 --> 01:09:38,667
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

494
01:09:38,668 --> 01:09:41,670
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

495
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:47,005
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

496
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,751
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

497
01:09:55,752 --> 01:09:58,554
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

498
01:09:58,555 --> 01:10:00,956
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

499
01:10:00,957 --> 01:10:03,926
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

500
01:10:03,927 --> 01:10:07,463
...holding the stakes.

501
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:10,199
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

502
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,302
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

503
01:10:13,303 --> 01:10:15,604
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

504
01:10:15,605 --> 01:10:18,540
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

505
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:19,908
...into the encryptor...

506
01:10:19,909 --> 01:10:21,844
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

507
01:10:21,845 --> 01:10:24,546
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

508
01:10:24,547 --> 01:10:26,276
Mr. Bond?

509
01:10:26,716 --> 01:10:28,083
We proceed alphabetically.

510
01:10:28,084 --> 01:10:33,418
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

511
01:10:38,928 --> 01:10:42,988
Six letters or more.

512
01:10:53,176 --> 01:10:58,738
High card for dealer position.

513
01:11:02,886 --> 01:11:04,386
It's Signor Gallardo.

514
01:11:04,387 --> 01:11:07,623
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

515
01:11:07,624 --> 01:11:13,195
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

516
01:11:13,196 --> 01:11:18,121
Well, enjoy the game.

517
01:11:39,088 --> 01:11:42,791
Four players.

518
01:11:42,792 --> 01:11:45,661
It's your bet.

519
01:11:45,662 --> 01:11:47,129
Check.

520
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:49,127
Check.

521
01:11:53,436 --> 01:11:58,395
Bet. Fifty thousand.

522
01:12:08,718 --> 01:12:09,980
Call.

523
01:12:13,256 --> 01:12:14,518
Fold.

524
01:12:16,726 --> 01:12:22,026
Fold. Heads up.

525
01:12:23,433 --> 01:12:27,766
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

526
01:12:36,379 --> 01:12:41,839
Bet. One hundred thousand.

527
01:12:42,051 --> 01:12:45,253
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

528
01:12:45,254 --> 01:12:48,824
Was I? Forgive me.

529
01:12:48,825 --> 01:12:53,920
Good luck, darling.

530
01:12:54,831 --> 01:12:59,201
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

531
01:12:59,202 --> 01:13:00,602
Monsieur Bond?

532
01:13:00,603 --> 01:13:04,072
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

533
01:13:04,073 --> 01:13:05,802
Call.

534
01:13:10,947 --> 01:13:12,107
Hello.

535
01:13:12,315 --> 01:13:16,118
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

536
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:19,454
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

537
01:13:19,455 --> 01:13:20,422
Champagne.

538
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:28,892
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

539
01:13:37,073 --> 01:13:41,270
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

540
01:13:44,781 --> 01:13:50,218
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

541
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:53,588
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

542
01:13:53,589 --> 01:13:55,386
Mr. Bond?

543
01:13:58,294 --> 01:13:59,625
Fold.

544
01:14:07,003 --> 01:14:12,235
Send the barman over, please.

545
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,482
A dry martini. Wait.

546
01:14:20,483 --> 01:14:22,384
Three measures Gordon's,
one of vodka...

547
01:14:22,385 --> 01:14:24,419
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

548
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:27,456
- ... then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
- Yes, sir.

549
01:14:27,457 --> 01:14:31,293
- You know, I'll have one of those.
- So will I.

550
01:14:31,294 --> 01:14:32,522
Certainly.

551
01:14:33,463 --> 01:14:38,233
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

552
01:14:38,234 --> 01:14:39,565
That's it?

553
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,671
Anyone want to play poker now?

554
01:14:42,672 --> 01:14:46,732
Someone's in a hurry.

555
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:57,683
Would you excuse me?

556
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:09,831
You taste nice.

557
01:15:09,832 --> 01:15:12,968
- I thought we dispensed with covers.
- No.

558
01:15:12,969 --> 01:15:16,872
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

559
01:15:16,873 --> 01:15:18,607
- Is he watching?
- Yes.

560
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:19,666
Good.

561
01:15:19,876 --> 01:15:22,844
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

562
01:15:22,845 --> 01:15:24,813
...we won't be here past midnight.

563
01:15:24,814 --> 01:15:28,416
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

564
01:15:28,417 --> 01:15:29,975
Check.

565
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,654
- You know, that's not half bad.
- Up to you.

566
01:15:32,655 --> 01:15:36,091
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

567
01:15:36,092 --> 01:15:38,994
It was worth it to discover his tell.

568
01:15:38,995 --> 01:15:40,629
What do you mean?

569
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:42,864
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

570
01:15:42,865 --> 01:15:47,202
- Bluffs? He had the best hand.
- Which he got on the last card.

571
01:15:47,203 --> 01:15:49,604
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

572
01:15:49,605 --> 01:15:51,773
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

573
01:15:51,774 --> 01:15:53,508
Winning was blind luck.

574
01:15:53,509 --> 01:15:55,544
- Did you get the bug?
- Yes.

575
01:15:55,545 --> 01:15:57,612
Bet. One hundred thousand.

576
01:15:57,613 --> 01:15:59,137
Thank you.

577
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:02,584
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

578
01:16:02,585 --> 01:16:06,454
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

579
01:16:06,455 --> 01:16:07,888
Call.

580
01:16:09,492 --> 01:16:13,995
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

581
01:16:13,996 --> 01:16:16,731
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

582
01:16:16,732 --> 01:16:18,700
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

583
01:16:18,701 --> 01:16:26,061
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

584
01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:59,374
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

585
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,240
So?

586
01:17:01,444 --> 01:17:03,778
You want to do what to me?

587
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:05,313
You've lost me completely.

588
01:17:05,314 --> 01:17:11,149
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

589
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:38,280
So, what's so damn important?

590
01:17:38,281 --> 01:17:39,873
I'm sorry.

591
01:17:42,752 --> 01:17:47,210
Where is my money?

592
01:17:48,858 --> 01:17:50,258
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

593
01:17:50,259 --> 01:17:55,389
You're holding a parcel for me.

594
01:17:57,133 --> 01:17:58,794
Thank you.

595
01:18:00,069 --> 01:18:04,773
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

596
01:18:04,774 --> 01:18:08,376
Your money is safe.

597
01:18:08,377 --> 01:18:10,106
Open that.

598
01:18:26,128 --> 01:18:29,130
You'll have it tomorrow.

599
01:18:29,131 --> 01:18:30,428
All of it.

600
01:18:43,913 --> 01:18:50,772
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

601
01:18:52,421 --> 01:18:55,423
Hold out your arm.

602
01:18:55,424 --> 01:18:57,859
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

603
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:02,352
...or I will take your head.

604
01:19:09,372 --> 01:19:15,207
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

605
01:19:25,654 --> 01:19:26,621
Stairs.

606
01:19:31,127 --> 01:19:34,362
Not a word of protest.

607
01:19:34,363 --> 01:19:39,823
You should find a new boyfriend.

608
01:21:39,088 --> 01:21:40,989
Go find Mathis.

609
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:44,425
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

610
01:21:44,426 --> 01:21:50,352
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

611
01:22:50,292 --> 01:22:53,228
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

612
01:22:53,229 --> 01:22:57,131
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

613
01:22:57,132 --> 01:22:58,360
A little.

614
01:22:58,567 --> 01:23:02,337
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

615
01:23:02,338 --> 01:23:09,265
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

616
01:24:07,603 --> 01:24:13,007
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

617
01:24:13,008 --> 01:24:17,773
Here, let's see.

618
01:24:30,459 --> 01:24:35,190
That's better.

619
01:24:36,365 --> 01:24:37,696
You cold?

620
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,299
Yeah.

621
01:24:39,501 --> 01:24:41,401
Here.

622
01:25:38,127 --> 01:25:40,762
You have any trouble
with the bodies?

623
01:25:40,763 --> 01:25:45,790
Less than some.

624
01:25:56,678 --> 01:26:01,349
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

625
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:04,252
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

626
01:26:04,253 --> 01:26:08,122
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

627
01:26:08,123 --> 01:26:10,892
How's our girl?

628
01:26:10,893 --> 01:26:16,990
Melted your cold heart yet?

629
01:26:32,014 --> 01:26:33,208
Call.

630
01:26:33,415 --> 01:26:34,814
Fold.

631
01:26:35,017 --> 01:26:36,985
And call.

632
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:43,246
Three players.

633
01:26:43,959 --> 01:26:45,927
Three hundred grand.

634
01:26:45,928 --> 01:26:49,464
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

635
01:26:49,465 --> 01:26:51,126
Call.

636
01:26:52,868 --> 01:26:53,835
And call.

637
01:26:59,007 --> 01:27:03,204
Three players.

638
01:27:04,646 --> 01:27:05,635
Check.

639
01:27:11,153 --> 01:27:15,213
Monsieur Bond?

640
01:27:22,197 --> 01:27:27,531
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

641
01:27:36,311 --> 01:27:40,815
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

642
01:27:40,816 --> 01:27:43,951
My God, James was right.

643
01:27:43,952 --> 01:27:48,786
It's up to you.

644
01:27:52,027 --> 01:27:57,327
Raise. One million.

645
01:28:01,503 --> 01:28:04,906
Seems someone knows
something I don't.

646
01:28:04,907 --> 01:28:06,101
Fold.

647
01:28:06,308 --> 01:28:08,276
Heads up, gentlemen.

648
01:28:08,277 --> 01:28:12,735
It's up to you.

649
01:28:24,026 --> 01:28:25,493
Two.

650
01:28:26,261 --> 01:28:30,331
Re-raise. Two million.

651
01:28:30,332 --> 01:28:35,291
And it's up to you.

652
01:28:43,478 --> 01:28:48,243
I'm all in.

653
01:28:52,754 --> 01:28:55,323
Well, it's 14 million
and 500,000.

654
01:28:55,324 --> 01:29:00,294
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

655
01:29:00,295 --> 01:29:05,600
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

656
01:29:05,601 --> 01:29:08,769
- Call.
- Call.

657
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:12,873
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

658
01:29:12,874 --> 01:29:15,476
Full house. Kings and aces.

659
01:29:15,477 --> 01:29:20,402
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

660
01:29:30,459 --> 01:29:37,056
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

661
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:42,003
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

662
01:29:42,004 --> 01:29:43,164
Please.

663
01:29:43,372 --> 01:29:45,873
We will now break for one hour.

664
01:29:45,874 --> 01:29:52,107
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

665
01:29:56,652 --> 01:29:58,313
Good game.

666
01:30:26,448 --> 01:30:30,351
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

667
01:30:30,352 --> 01:30:33,220
I can't do that, James.

668
01:30:33,221 --> 01:30:36,424
Look, I made a mistake.

669
01:30:36,425 --> 01:30:39,627
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

670
01:30:39,628 --> 01:30:42,129
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

671
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:43,563
Sorry?

672
01:30:43,765 --> 01:30:45,733
Try putting that in a sentence.

673
01:30:45,734 --> 01:30:47,334
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

674
01:30:47,335 --> 01:30:49,870
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

675
01:30:49,871 --> 01:30:53,140
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

676
01:30:53,141 --> 01:30:54,742
That's what this is about.

677
01:30:54,743 --> 01:30:57,344
All you're going to do now
is lose more.

678
01:30:57,345 --> 01:30:58,713
Then you're an idiot.

679
01:30:58,714 --> 01:31:03,484
- I'm sorry?
- I said, you're a bloody idiot.

680
01:31:03,485 --> 01:31:06,520
Look in my eyes.

681
01:31:06,521 --> 01:31:10,925
I can beat this man, you know that.

682
01:31:10,926 --> 01:31:16,420
Get your hand off my arm.

683
01:31:36,418 --> 01:31:37,785
Vodka martini.

684
01:31:37,786 --> 01:31:43,484
- Shaken or stirred?
- Do I look like I give a damn?

685
01:31:58,774 --> 01:32:03,938
- James.
- Get the girl out.

686
01:32:08,316 --> 01:32:09,483
Funny game, right?

687
01:32:09,484 --> 01:32:13,320
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

688
01:32:13,321 --> 01:32:18,425
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

689
01:32:18,426 --> 01:32:20,027
You should have a little faith.

690
01:32:20,028 --> 01:32:22,730
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

691
01:32:22,731 --> 01:32:25,432
Had. Excuse me.

692
01:32:25,433 --> 01:32:29,069
You're not buying in?

693
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:30,435
No.

694
01:32:33,775 --> 01:32:37,912
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

695
01:32:37,913 --> 01:32:41,649
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

696
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:43,951
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

697
01:32:43,952 --> 01:32:50,191
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

698
01:32:50,192 --> 01:32:53,227
And what about the winnings?

699
01:32:53,228 --> 01:32:58,688
Does it look like
we need the money?

700
01:33:07,342 --> 01:33:11,645
Shall we up the blinds?

701
01:33:11,646 --> 01:33:13,341
Why not?

702
01:33:16,818 --> 01:33:18,308
Bet.

703
01:33:20,388 --> 01:33:22,049
Raise.

704
01:33:37,572 --> 01:33:39,506
And fold.

705
01:33:41,743 --> 01:33:45,412
Excuse me, please.

706
01:33:45,413 --> 01:33:47,040
Call.

707
01:33:48,516 --> 01:33:49,744
Raise.

708
01:33:49,951 --> 01:33:55,923
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

709
01:33:55,924 --> 01:34:00,227
- Fold.
- Thank you.

710
01:34:00,228 --> 01:34:01,388
Fold.

711
01:34:05,667 --> 01:34:07,191
Fold.

712
01:34:12,107 --> 01:34:13,540
Thank you.

713
01:34:13,742 --> 01:34:14,709
Wins.

714
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:37,998
Deal me out.

715
01:34:37,999 --> 01:34:43,103
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

716
01:34:43,104 --> 01:34:47,562
Small blind, please.

717
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:52,840
- Who is it?
- It's 007.

718
01:35:52,841 --> 01:35:57,578
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

719
01:35:57,579 --> 01:36:00,214
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

720
01:36:00,215 --> 01:36:03,150
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

721
01:36:03,151 --> 01:36:04,518
I'm all ears.

722
01:36:04,519 --> 01:36:06,253
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

723
01:36:06,254 --> 01:36:11,486
- Do we know what it is yet?
- We're still scanning.

724
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:19,859
Attach the leads to your chest.

725
01:36:25,607 --> 01:36:27,875
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

726
01:36:27,876 --> 01:36:30,878
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

727
01:36:30,879 --> 01:36:32,713
...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

728
01:36:32,714 --> 01:36:35,649
- As soon as it reads charged...
- Lidocaine. That'll work.

729
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:38,318
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

730
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:39,953
His heart's gonna stop.

731
01:36:39,954 --> 01:36:43,323
There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.

732
01:36:43,324 --> 01:36:47,394
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

733
01:36:47,395 --> 01:36:52,593
That'll counteract the digitalis.

734
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:55,002
You're going to pass out
in a few seconds.

735
01:36:55,003 --> 01:36:56,637
You need to keep
your heart going.

736
01:36:56,638 --> 01:37:00,766
Push the red button now, Bond.

737
01:37:03,978 --> 01:37:09,312
- Bond, push the damn button!
- Do it now!

738
01:37:54,295 --> 01:37:59,163
- You okay?
- Me?

739
01:37:59,601 --> 01:38:02,402
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

740
01:38:02,403 --> 01:38:07,074
- Now get yourself off to a hospital.
- I will do.

741
01:38:07,075 --> 01:38:08,675
As soon as I've won this game.

742
01:38:08,676 --> 01:38:13,981
You're not seriously
going back there?

743
01:38:13,982 --> 01:38:17,518
I wouldn't dream of it.

744
01:38:17,519 --> 01:38:22,011
Bet. One million.

745
01:38:22,857 --> 01:38:24,625
- All in.
- Call. All in.

746
01:38:24,626 --> 01:38:29,229
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

747
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:34,030
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

748
01:38:35,069 --> 01:38:40,403
Queen plays. Wins.

749
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,481
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
01:38:47,482 --> 01:38:51,485
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

751
01:38:51,486 --> 01:38:55,289
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

752
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:57,257
...which means no more buy-ins.

753
01:38:57,258 --> 01:39:03,355
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

754
01:39:07,535 --> 01:39:11,471
Four players.

755
01:39:11,472 --> 01:39:15,737
It's your bet.

756
01:39:16,878 --> 01:39:18,245
- Monsieur Bond?
- Check.

757
01:39:18,246 --> 01:39:24,952
- Check.
- Twenty-four million in the pot already.

758
01:39:24,953 --> 01:39:27,521
Check. And check.

759
01:39:27,522 --> 01:39:29,114
All check.

760
01:39:29,457 --> 01:39:33,551
Four players.

761
01:39:35,663 --> 01:39:39,962
- Check.
- Check.

762
01:39:42,971 --> 01:39:46,039
All in. Six million.

763
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:51,465
Bet. Six million. All in.

764
01:39:54,015 --> 01:39:56,550
Five million. All in.

765
01:39:56,551 --> 01:40:02,011
Bet is 6 million.

766
01:40:06,628 --> 01:40:07,959
Raise.

767
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:10,724
Raise.

768
01:40:10,932 --> 01:40:17,097
Twelve million. Heads up.

769
01:40:44,799 --> 01:40:50,370
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

770
01:40:50,371 --> 01:40:55,102
Raise. All in.

771
01:41:11,092 --> 01:41:17,587
Well, I think I will call you
on that one.

772
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,730
Call.

773
01:41:34,615 --> 01:41:39,019
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

774
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:44,650
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

775
01:41:45,393 --> 01:41:50,227
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

776
01:41:55,903 --> 01:42:01,795
Full house. Eights full of aces.

777
01:42:17,058 --> 01:42:19,393
A higher full house.

778
01:42:19,394 --> 01:42:23,761
Aces full of sixes.

779
01:42:26,868 --> 01:42:30,962
Monsieur Bond.

780
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:47,821
Five and seven of spades.

781
01:42:47,822 --> 01:42:49,489
A straight flush.

782
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:50,991
Four to the eight.

783
01:42:50,992 --> 01:42:55,985
The high hand.

784
01:42:57,799 --> 01:43:00,333
Monsieur Bond wins.

785
01:43:00,334 --> 01:43:05,071
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

786
01:43:05,072 --> 01:43:06,473
Congratulations.

787
01:43:06,474 --> 01:43:12,901
- He's all yours.
- Much appreciated, brother.

788
01:43:16,984 --> 01:43:18,351
Congratulations.

789
01:43:18,352 --> 01:43:20,420
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

790
01:43:20,421 --> 01:43:23,824
You were almost dead an hour ago.

791
01:43:23,825 --> 01:43:29,717
Come on, I'm famished.

792
01:43:37,238 --> 01:43:39,103
Thank you.

793
01:43:46,714 --> 01:43:50,817
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

794
01:43:50,818 --> 01:43:54,154
They're going to extract him
before dawn.

795
01:43:54,155 --> 01:43:57,524
You know, I think
I'll call that a Vesper.

796
01:43:57,525 --> 01:43:59,526
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

797
01:43:59,527 --> 01:44:06,299
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

798
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:10,637
- I thought that was quite a good line.
- It was a very good line.

799
01:44:10,638 --> 01:44:12,472
But you're laughing at it.

800
01:44:12,473 --> 01:44:19,639
- Not so much it as you.
- Well, that's fine then.

801
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:27,053
I figured out what that is.

802
01:44:27,054 --> 01:44:29,523
It's an Algerian love knot.

803
01:44:29,524 --> 01:44:32,926
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

804
01:44:32,927 --> 01:44:35,462
No, you didn't.

805
01:44:35,463 --> 01:44:39,830
Someone gave that to you.

806
01:44:40,635 --> 01:44:45,264
He's a very lucky man.

807
01:44:48,876 --> 01:44:52,078
You can switch off so easily,
can't you?

808
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:54,881
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

809
01:44:54,882 --> 01:44:58,852
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

810
01:44:58,853 --> 01:45:01,721
I don't believe you.

811
01:45:01,722 --> 01:45:04,090
You've got a choice, you know?

812
01:45:04,091 --> 01:45:05,892
Just because
you've done something...

813
01:45:05,893 --> 01:45:08,228
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

814
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:11,331
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

815
01:45:11,332 --> 01:45:14,200
You think I can't take
my own advice?

816
01:45:14,201 --> 01:45:17,404
I think something is driving you.

817
01:45:17,405 --> 01:45:22,330
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

818
01:45:25,379 --> 01:45:28,181
Mathis needs me.

819
01:45:28,182 --> 01:45:29,649
Good night.

820
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:33,881
Congratulations again.

821
01:45:50,271 --> 01:45:52,102
Mathis.

822
01:47:44,051 --> 01:47:49,255
I'm afraid your friend Mathis
is really...

823
01:47:49,256 --> 01:47:53,953
...my friend Mathis.

824
01:49:33,828 --> 01:49:39,458
You've taken good care
of your body.

825
01:49:43,103 --> 01:49:48,494
Such a waste.

826
01:50:02,857 --> 01:50:05,058
You know...

827
01:50:05,059 --> 01:50:08,394
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

828
01:50:08,395 --> 01:50:10,797
It's the simplest thing...

829
01:50:10,798 --> 01:50:15,835
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

830
01:50:15,836 --> 01:50:17,203
And of course...

831
01:50:17,204 --> 01:50:20,373
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

832
01:50:20,374 --> 01:50:23,743
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

833
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:30,273
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

834
01:50:33,454 --> 01:50:36,856
The only question remains...

835
01:50:36,857 --> 01:50:41,094
...will you yield in time?

836
01:50:41,095 --> 01:50:47,123
I want the money.

837
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:06,586
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

838
01:51:06,587 --> 01:51:11,853
So all I need from you
is the password.

839
01:51:18,732 --> 01:51:24,863
The password, please.

840
01:51:26,206 --> 01:51:28,708
I've got a little itch...

841
01:51:28,709 --> 01:51:31,344
...down there.

842
01:51:31,345 --> 01:51:35,712
Would you mind?

843
01:51:40,554 --> 01:51:44,924
No! No! No!

844
01:51:44,925 --> 01:51:48,828
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

845
01:51:48,829 --> 01:51:53,199
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

846
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:54,690
Yeah!

847
01:51:55,936 --> 01:52:02,135
Yes, yes, yes.

848
01:52:04,912 --> 01:52:11,651
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

849
01:52:11,652 --> 01:52:13,643
I died?

850
01:52:13,854 --> 01:52:15,355
- I died?
- Yes.

851
01:52:15,356 --> 01:52:18,524
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

852
01:52:18,525 --> 01:52:20,560
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

853
01:52:20,561 --> 01:52:23,596
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

854
01:52:23,597 --> 01:52:25,198
Because if you kill me...

855
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:27,467
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

856
01:52:27,468 --> 01:52:30,470
But you are so wrong!

857
01:52:30,471 --> 01:52:33,673
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

858
01:52:33,674 --> 01:52:38,011
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

859
01:52:38,012 --> 01:52:42,882
...because they need what I know.

860
01:52:42,883 --> 01:52:47,842
The big picture.

861
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:55,294
Give me the password...

862
01:52:55,295 --> 01:53:00,129
...and I will at least let her live.

863
01:53:00,901 --> 01:53:06,895
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

864
01:53:17,084 --> 01:53:19,419
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

865
01:53:19,420 --> 01:53:21,217
No.

866
01:53:23,057 --> 01:53:27,857
So I think...

867
01:53:29,496 --> 01:53:35,832
...I'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

868
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:49,248
I'll get the money.

869
01:53:49,249 --> 01:53:51,951
Tell them I'll get the money.

870
01:53:51,952 --> 01:53:59,312
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

871
01:54:20,047 --> 01:54:21,446
Francesco.

872
01:54:22,382 --> 01:54:24,282
Francesco.

873
01:54:36,997 --> 01:54:39,124
Vesper.

874
01:54:41,001 --> 01:54:42,901
Vesper.

875
01:54:45,038 --> 01:54:46,562
No.

876
01:54:47,374 --> 01:54:48,705
Not him.

877
01:54:48,909 --> 01:54:52,645
Not Mathis.

878
01:54:52,646 --> 01:54:53,806
No.

879
01:54:54,648 --> 01:54:59,452
I'll get the doctor.

880
01:54:59,453 --> 01:55:01,250
Not him.

881
01:55:03,157 --> 01:55:04,317
Any ideas?

882
01:55:08,061 --> 01:55:13,900
- What?
- Why they left the two of you alive.

883
01:55:13,901 --> 01:55:16,369
Where is she?

884
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:18,270
Sleeping.

885
01:55:18,872 --> 01:55:23,242
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

886
01:55:23,243 --> 01:55:25,111
It's just odd...

887
01:55:25,112 --> 01:55:29,215
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

888
01:55:29,216 --> 01:55:33,719
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

889
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:36,389
Get a look at the killer?

890
01:55:36,390 --> 01:55:38,119
No.

891
01:55:39,593 --> 01:55:41,026
Shame.

892
01:55:42,696 --> 01:55:44,425
Drink up.

893
01:55:47,834 --> 01:55:50,203
Anything else you remember?

894
01:55:50,204 --> 01:55:52,438
Anything that can help us?

895
01:55:52,439 --> 01:55:54,066
Help us?

896
01:55:54,274 --> 01:55:59,404
Or help you?

897
01:56:36,883 --> 01:56:38,043
Hello.

898
01:56:38,252 --> 01:56:40,083
Hello.

899
01:56:41,788 --> 01:56:43,723
You all right?

900
01:56:43,724 --> 01:56:46,092
I can't resist waking you.

901
01:56:46,093 --> 01:56:51,864
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

902
01:56:51,865 --> 01:56:56,756
It makes me feel reborn.

903
01:56:57,604 --> 01:57:01,374
If you'd just been born...

904
01:57:01,375 --> 01:57:04,410
...wouldn't you be naked?

905
01:57:04,411 --> 01:57:09,282
You have me there.

906
01:57:09,283 --> 01:57:14,053
You can have me anywhere.

907
01:57:14,054 --> 01:57:15,578
I can?

908
01:57:15,789 --> 01:57:20,660
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

909
01:57:20,661 --> 01:57:23,763
Does this mean
that you're warming to me?

910
01:57:23,764 --> 01:57:26,165
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

911
01:57:26,166 --> 01:57:27,800
It's just that not so long ago...

912
01:57:27,801 --> 01:57:33,139
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as...

913
01:57:33,140 --> 01:57:36,342
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

914
01:57:36,343 --> 01:57:39,779
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

915
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:45,051
That is something to be afraid of.

916
01:57:45,052 --> 01:57:50,122
- Hello.
- Oh, perfect timing.

917
01:57:50,123 --> 01:57:53,059
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

918
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:55,261
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush...

919
01:57:55,262 --> 01:57:57,463
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

920
01:57:57,464 --> 01:58:00,499
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

921
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:03,836
I'm afraid not.

922
01:58:03,837 --> 01:58:09,604
If you would type in
the account number.

923
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:15,981
And now the password.

924
01:58:15,982 --> 01:58:17,850
You can do that.

925
01:58:17,851 --> 01:58:20,519
I would if I knew what it was.

926
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:29,791
V- E-S-P-E-R.

927
01:58:37,738 --> 01:58:39,739
The funds have been transferred.

928
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:44,443
Sorry for disturbing you.

929
01:58:44,444 --> 01:58:50,575
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

930
01:58:54,254 --> 01:58:58,257
You know, James...

931
01:58:58,258 --> 01:59:01,360
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

932
01:59:01,361 --> 01:59:04,864
...was your smile
and your little finger...

933
01:59:04,865 --> 01:59:10,495
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

934
01:59:17,010 --> 01:59:23,549
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

935
01:59:23,550 --> 01:59:30,318
- I have no idea.
- But you're aching to find out.

936
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:35,361
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

937
01:59:35,362 --> 01:59:37,696
You've got your armor back on.

938
01:59:37,697 --> 01:59:40,433
That's that.

939
01:59:40,434 --> 01:59:44,236
I have no armor left.

940
01:59:44,237 --> 01:59:47,606
You've stripped it from me.

941
01:59:47,607 --> 01:59:54,246
Whatever is left of me...

942
01:59:54,247 --> 01:59:56,415
...whatever I am...

943
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:01,807
...I'm yours.

944
02:01:00,347 --> 02:01:04,083
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

945
02:01:04,084 --> 02:01:06,118
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

946
02:01:06,119 --> 02:01:07,313
Mathis?

947
02:01:07,521 --> 02:01:09,755
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

948
02:01:09,756 --> 02:01:12,758
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

949
02:01:12,759 --> 02:01:14,527
That's how he wiped me out.

950
02:01:14,528 --> 02:01:18,397
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

951
02:01:18,398 --> 02:01:20,799
I can't believe it.

952
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,868
No, neither could I.

953
02:01:22,869 --> 02:01:25,938
I thought he had my back.

954
02:01:25,939 --> 02:01:29,141
But there you go, lesson learned.

955
02:01:29,142 --> 02:01:33,479
Does everyone have a tell?

956
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:35,209
Yes.

957
02:01:38,151 --> 02:01:39,914
Everyone.

958
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:45,051
Everyone except you.

959
02:01:46,626 --> 02:01:50,696
I wonder if that's why I love you.

960
02:01:50,697 --> 02:01:53,165
You love me?

961
02:01:53,166 --> 02:01:55,634
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

962
02:01:55,635 --> 02:01:58,470
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

963
02:01:58,471 --> 02:02:03,442
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

964
02:02:03,443 --> 02:02:05,844
You're serious.

965
02:02:05,845 --> 02:02:08,314
Like you said...

966
02:02:08,315 --> 02:02:10,215
...you do what I do for too long...

967
02:02:10,216 --> 02:02:13,218
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

968
02:02:13,219 --> 02:02:18,090
I'm leaving with
what little I have left.

969
02:02:18,091 --> 02:02:23,084
Is that enough for you?

970
02:04:04,531 --> 02:04:06,932
- Come on.
- No. No.

971
02:04:06,933 --> 02:04:10,335
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

972
02:04:10,336 --> 02:04:14,773
What's the time?

973
02:04:14,774 --> 02:04:17,309
How much do we need
to float for a month?

974
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:19,278
I've got plenty.

975
02:04:19,279 --> 02:04:26,115
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

976
02:04:26,152 --> 02:04:28,687
You stopped wearing the necklace.

977
02:04:28,688 --> 02:04:32,057
Yeah. It was time.

978
02:04:32,058 --> 02:04:37,688
Time enough to get over someone?

979
02:04:39,566 --> 02:04:45,833
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

980
02:04:51,644 --> 02:04:56,444
Though apparently not
your employer.

981
02:04:57,984 --> 02:05:02,287
Back in one month.

982
02:05:02,288 --> 02:05:04,890
Come on. I'll get the money...

983
02:05:04,891 --> 02:05:09,952
...you get supplies.

984
02:05:36,723 --> 02:05:42,057
I'll see you back here
in half an hour.

985
02:06:03,650 --> 02:06:06,285
- Hello, M.
- I got your note.

986
02:06:06,286 --> 02:06:07,947
Yes?

987
02:06:08,154 --> 02:06:10,189
We'll talk about that later.

988
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:13,392
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

989
02:06:13,393 --> 02:06:18,853
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

990
02:06:19,666 --> 02:06:22,701
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

991
02:06:22,702 --> 02:06:26,205
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

992
02:06:26,206 --> 02:06:28,707
So you'll be depositing it today.

993
02:06:28,708 --> 02:06:31,743
On my way to the bank right now.

994
02:06:31,744 --> 02:06:34,913
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

995
02:06:34,914 --> 02:06:36,074
Hello.

996
02:06:36,282 --> 02:06:39,885
Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

997
02:06:39,886 --> 02:06:41,920
It was transferred
to the account number...

998
02:06:41,921 --> 02:06:46,859
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

999
02:06:46,860 --> 02:06:52,965
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1000
02:06:52,966 --> 02:06:55,000
- Where?
- The Venice branch, of course.

1001
02:06:55,001 --> 02:06:58,604
St. Mark's Square.

1002
02:06:58,605 --> 02:07:03,200
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?

1003
02:09:13,006 --> 02:09:15,173
I'll kill her!

1004
02:09:15,174 --> 02:09:16,368
Allow me.

1005
02:13:36,302 --> 02:13:41,170
I'm sorry, James.

1006
02:16:49,929 --> 02:16:52,864
She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.

1007
02:16:52,865 --> 02:16:55,333
They were very much in love.

1008
02:16:55,334 --> 02:16:58,670
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.

1009
02:16:58,671 --> 02:17:03,842
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1010
02:17:03,843 --> 02:17:05,410
We should've picked up on it...

1011
02:17:05,411 --> 02:17:07,846
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1012
02:17:07,847 --> 02:17:11,015
...we forget to watch our friends.

1013
02:17:11,016 --> 02:17:13,218
How are you doing?

1014
02:17:13,219 --> 02:17:15,653
She left her cell phone.

1015
02:17:15,654 --> 02:17:18,823
She must have known I'd check it.

1016
02:17:18,824 --> 02:17:22,060
She knew you were you.

1017
02:17:22,061 --> 02:17:24,496
- Well, at least this clears Mathis.
- No.

1018
02:17:24,497 --> 02:17:26,124
- No?
- No.

1019
02:17:26,332 --> 02:17:29,033
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1020
02:17:29,034 --> 02:17:32,170
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1021
02:17:32,171 --> 02:17:34,138
You don't trust anyone,
do you, James?

1022
02:17:34,139 --> 02:17:35,766
No.

1023
02:17:36,275 --> 02:17:39,344
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1024
02:17:39,345 --> 02:17:42,280
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1025
02:17:42,281 --> 02:17:43,441
Will do.

1026
02:17:45,718 --> 02:17:47,285
If you do need time...

1027
02:17:47,286 --> 02:17:49,687
Why should I need more time?

1028
02:17:49,688 --> 02:17:53,892
The job's done,
and the bitch is dead.

1029
02:17:53,893 --> 02:17:55,690
James...

1030
02:17:56,328 --> 02:18:00,331
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1031
02:18:00,332 --> 02:18:02,233
Isn't it obvious?

1032
02:18:02,234 --> 02:18:06,404
She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.

1033
02:18:06,405 --> 02:18:10,141
I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.

1034
02:18:10,142 --> 02:18:14,245
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1035
02:18:14,246 --> 02:18:17,382
And now we'll never know
who was behind this.

1036
02:18:17,383 --> 02:18:22,843
The trail's gone cold.

1037
02:19:47,473 --> 02:19:49,574
- Hello.
- Mr. White?

1038
02:19:49,575 --> 02:19:51,275
We need to talk.

1039
02:19:51,276 --> 02:19:56,041
Who is this?

1040
02:20:23,442 --> 02:20:25,643
The name's Bond.

1041
02:20:25,644 --> 02:20:30,478
James Bond.
