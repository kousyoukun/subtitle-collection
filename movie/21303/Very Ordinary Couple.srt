1
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,960
Don't look at the camera.

2
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,330
Good.

3
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,670
Look at the producer
on the right.

4
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,230
- Okay.
- Look over here.

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,270
- Ready?
- Yes.

6
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,330
Honestly, I think
it's for the best.

7
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,610
I knew it'd be over.

8
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,750
It's better to let go soon

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,680
when you know it's hopeless.

10
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,170
Hurry, sis!
You gotta watch this!

11
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,670
- Not watching?
- I want to sleep.

12
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,360
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

13
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,840
What wrong?
She never misses this.

14
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,650
If you're going to break up,

15
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,780
better to do it sooner.

16
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,540
And get on with your life.

17
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,720
That's it.
I'm actually relieved.

18
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,120
Am I sad?

19
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,090
No. Why would I be?

20
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,960
I feel fine. I'm happy.

21
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,770
- And the husband?
- Hiding and watching.

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,530
Today's show will be crazier.

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,840
The wife got mad
and checked into the hospital.

24
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,140
Got sick?
It's so crazy.

25
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,310
I have to watch today's show.

26
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,680
Should've watched

27
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,620
last night's episode.

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,090
What was I doing?

29
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,780
I should've watched it.

30
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,720
<i>Very Ordinary Couple</i>

31
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,980
People cry and freak out

32
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,620
when they break up.

33
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,730
But that's for TV dramas,

34
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,130
not real life.

35
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,200
After I broke up, I realized...

36
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,030
This is freedom!

37
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,000
Shit! I'm free!
I'm a free man!

38
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,440
If it won't work,

39
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,630
go your separate ways.

40
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,400
Meet other people
and live happily.

41
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,570
I think...

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,980
that's way better.

43
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,450
Hyo-sun, you look way

44
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,880
hotter in person.

45
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,350
How can you be so pretty?

46
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,480
Hyo-sun.

47
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,450
He saw your pics

48
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,620
and begged me
to introduce you.

49
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,990
You're handsome, too.

50
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,230
I wasn't asking
to hear that.

51
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,320
Let's drink up!
Cheers!

52
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,100
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,690
Shit!

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,440
What?

55
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,800
Bitch...

56
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,380
What's wrong? You drunk?

57
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,140
Call Young

58
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,850
to come here now!

59
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,550
When did he get so drunk?

60
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,720
Call Young

61
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,920
to come here now!

62
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,960
Young is his best friend.

63
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,090
Drink some water.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,830
Damn fool!

65
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,390
Damn!

66
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,730
- Are you crazy!
- Make the call!

67
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,000
- What's with you!
- Call her to come!

68
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,480
- You bastard!
- Bro!

69
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,110
What's with you!

70
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm dying to see Young...

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,790
It's hard to say
I'm sorry...

72
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,790
I'm so sorry about this.

73
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,340
Last night?
Did I do something?

74
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,410
Was I really drunk?

75
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,540
I don't remember.

76
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,420
- You drank again?
- Sort of.

77
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,560
Didn't go home again?

78
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,460
Go to a motel.

79
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,290
Why always sleep here?

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,160
It's not a day or two.
It costs a lot.

81
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,400
Just beg your wife
for forgiveness.

82
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
This is bad.

83
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,510
Ms. JANG?
Will you catch my bouquet?

84
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,780
- Me?
- All my friends are moms.

85
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,220
You've dated for long.

86
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,760
Aren't you getting married soon?

87
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,800
- She broke up.
- Really?

88
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,660
It's over.

89
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,230
When? Why?

90
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,890
Just because...

91
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,360
Then, you're set.

92
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,530
Find a man at my wedding.

93
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,660
That's a true bridesmaid.

94
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,570
It's okay.
Just catch the bouquet.

95
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,940
Catch the bouquet.

96
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,080
I don't mix business
with pleasure.

97
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,120
You can date a co-worker,

98
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,650
but I think it should be
kept confidential.

99
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,810
Oh, right.

100
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,580
Did you know

101
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,920
Mr. LEE broke up
with his girlfriend?

102
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,390
- Who said that?
- Mr. PARK.

103
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,490
He found out about Dong-hee

104
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,530
and I about a year ago.

105
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,790
By accident.

106
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,360
He tried to kiss me once

107
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,960
and Dong-hee punched him 5m back.

108
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,330
He's the only one

109
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,270
who knew we were dating.

110
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,970
I heard the girl was
a real psycho.

111
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,150
- A psycho?
- How?

112
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,710
She's hysterical and stalks him.

113
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,390
A total lunatic.

114
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,950
Wasn't he seriously dating?

115
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,020
Guess you never know
till the wedding.

116
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,460
Psycho?

117
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm a psycho?

118
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,860
Of course not.

119
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,870
I was just kidding.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,700
Why am I a psycho?

121
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,780
I never stalked him!

122
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,780
When was I ever hysterical?

123
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,510
Tell me the exact time and date
I did that!

124
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,810
- Ms. JANG?
- Yes?

125
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,280
Want me to introduce someone?

126
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,110
He's great.

127
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,820
Chief MIN at headquarters.

128
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,650
I'll call him out to our party.

129
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,390
Come to see him.

130
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,760
I can't go.
I'm busy today.

131
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,360
Just stop by and see him.

132
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,230
- He's really nice and smart.
- Chief!

133
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,010
Forget her.
How about a girl for me?

134
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,630
Ms. JANG has high standards.

135
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,270
She won't look at just any guy.

136
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,210
I don't have high standards.

137
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,480
They're very low.

138
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,350
I always dated bums.

139
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,150
What high standards?

140
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,360
Really? Bums?

141
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,060
- Bum?
- Yeah.

142
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,460
I always get stabbed
in the back by jerks,

143
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,150
- you know?
- Jerks?

144
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,720
So, meet Chief MIN.

145
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,230
Stop by later.

146
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,100
Promise?

147
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,770
A bum? A jerk?

148
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,970
I don't believe this.

149
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,600
Let's go to the party.

150
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,940
I'm not going, man.

151
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,240
She's being set up
with Chief MIN.

152
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,810
I'm not going!
No way!

153
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,040
Wait.

154
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,140
Yes?

155
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,540
Didn't you say
you couldn't come?

156
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,340
It got cancelled.

157
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,740
So conveniently cancelled.

158
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,220
What's it to you?

159
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,080
He seems okay.
Good luck with him.

160
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,380
I think he's great, too.

161
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,990
We have to work together,

162
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,790
so let's try to be civil.

163
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,290
We're not kids.

164
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,840
We can be civil to each other.

165
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,800
Of course.

166
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,840
Ms. JANG?

167
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,430
What?

168
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,140
Call me, 'Mr. LEE', please.

169
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,110
Remember the laptop
you borrowed?

170
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,420
What?

171
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,490
You borrowed my laptop.

172
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,690
You said you'll return it.

173
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,190
I'd like it back

174
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,400
as soon as possible.

175
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,630
Of course, I'll return it.
I apologize.

176
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,500
Good.
You had it for long.

177
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,430
It's only right
to return it soon.

178
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,630
I will return it.

179
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,330
I really need it.

180
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,610
Soon!

181
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,840
You always say you will.

182
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,810
I'd like it back this time.

183
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,610
I'll trust you. Bye.

184
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,850
- Bye!
- Don't go!

185
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,890
- Please stay.
- I should go.

186
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,090
You just met.

187
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,540
Excuse me.
You're older.

188
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,870
- Mind if I called you bro?
- Sure.

189
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,070
I've known Ms. JANG

190
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,770
for a long time.

191
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,400
She's really great.

192
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,910
She seems like a nice person.

193
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,350
When you start dating,

194
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,120
you'll see some faults, too.

195
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,550
But please be good to her.
She's sensitive.

196
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,590
Ms. JANG's great

197
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,990
except when she's dating...

198
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,820
I shouldn't say this about her.

199
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,570
What about me
when I'm dating?

200
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,570
Nothing.
As you date her,

201
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,690
you'll know.

202
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,570
I want to know.
What is it?

203
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,470
What's with you?

204
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,800
I was trying to help.

205
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,240
Want me to really tell?

206
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,950
Come on, Ms. JANG.

207
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,950
I'm kidding.

208
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,220
Relax.

209
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,880
Don't get mad.

210
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,330
Here's a nice, cold drink

211
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,190
as a sign of truce?

212
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,770
I'm sorry. Relax.

213
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,040
Oops!

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,370
Ms. JANG! Oh no!

215
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,900
You're all wet.
I'm so sorry.

216
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you okay?

217
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,170
I must be drunk.
My mistake.

218
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,080
My hand slipped.

219
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,280
It wasn't on purpose.

220
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,250
- What's with them?
- No idea.

221
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,460
Ms. JANG?
Are you crazy?

222
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm not crazy!

223
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,240
You seem quite drunk,
Mr. LEE.

224
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,840
And you seem lightheaded

225
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,770
over meeting a man, Ms. JANG.

226
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,180
It's inappropriate
at an office party like this.

227
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,470
Why don't you go elsewhere
and play, Mr. LEE?

228
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,150
Who cares if a psychotic woman

229
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,020
goes lightheaded?

230
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,380
I'm just a psycho!

231
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,550
Hey!

232
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,560
What's with you!

233
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,720
What are you doing?

234
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,230
Did you even like me?

235
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,530
- What?
- Why did you date me?

236
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,630
You lied about loving me?

237
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,170
Get it straight!

238
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,970
You're the one who wanted
to break up and be civil.

239
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,050
You're the one who just waited
for me to say that!

240
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,380
You met me out of duty
and waited for me to give up!

241
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,750
I pretended I didn't know,

242
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,550
but it made me wanna puke!

243
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,220
You're driving me
absolutely insane!

244
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,720
You, too!

245
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,790
Stay out of my sight

246
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,920
or I'll kill you.

247
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,020
You stay out of mine!

248
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,970
Shit!
Come back here!

249
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,490
Hey! Relax!

250
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,130
- Crazy bitch.
- Son of a bitch.

251
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,940
Young!

252
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,070
So quickly!

253
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,070
Ms. JANG!
Young! Don't leave like that!

254
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,410
You forgot to pay!

255
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,480
How can they put on
an act like that?

256
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,020
They dated all this time

257
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,350
without any of us knowing?

258
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,460
Must've slept together, right?

259
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,030
No such things as secrets.

260
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,460
But I hope they get

261
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,760
back together again.

262
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,100
Bank clerks can be sensitive.

263
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,030
It's all the stress talking

264
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,100
Everyone's like that.

265
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,040
I ditched dirt on Ms. JANG

266
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,680
and Mr. LEE all the time.

267
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,770
All that talking behind
their backs for nothing?

268
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,710
Actually, I had
a school reunion, today.

269
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,440
I debated whether
to go there or here.

270
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,140
It was good I came here.
It was fun.

271
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,590
- God damn it!
- Stop!

272
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,750
Why did you hold me back, fool!

273
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,420
Just sit down!

274
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,270
- Mr. LEE Dong-hee?
- Yes.

275
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,700
Package delivery.

276
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,480
- $30, please.
- What?

277
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,710
- Pay upon delivery.
- What?

278
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,220
What the!

279
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,830
How the hell?

280
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,530
Man! I could just kill her!

281
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,300
Young! Come out here!

282
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,900
Delivery for $50.

283
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,670
There's something wrong
with last month's bill.

284
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,930
You have a couple plan
with Ms. JANG Young?

285
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,030
I cancelled that.

286
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,610
Ms. JANG charged $300
to her phone.

287
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,910
With all her charges and data,
everything comes to $720.

288
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,850
Why should I pay for
her clothes and bags!

289
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,080
The phone is under your name.
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,880
Please pay by this date.

291
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,040
Why is it wrong?

292
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,340
I checked your account, sir.

293
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,040
Your balance is not enough to...

294
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,490
Young wants
the number 3 profile chart.

295
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,630
What profile chart?

296
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,930
With this month's records.

297
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,440
It's not ready, yet.

298
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,870
She's asking
when it'll be ready.

299
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,810
I'm not sure.

300
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,580
About 6 months ago...

301
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,570
They fought and didn't talk

302
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,810
to each other for a week.

303
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,910
I had to do half their work

304
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,150
for that week.

305
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,050
- Can you do it fast?
- I'm on it.

306
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,790
Isn't this due today?

307
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,320
Don't know.

308
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,730
Do it, now.

309
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,590
It's me asking.

310
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,820
LEE's secret code

311
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,960
for everything is 'asdf'.

312
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,030
Left to right on the keyboard.

313
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,930
I tried that for fun
2 years ago and it worked.

314
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,970
I've been checking his site
twice a week.

315
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,980
Once, a girl wrote to him
saying she's a childhood friend.

316
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,680
If I didn't erase it,
we could've broken up sooner.

317
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,790
<i>Hon? Still awake?</i>

318
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,500
<i>Are you there?</i>

319
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,970
<i>Yup, I'm here.</i>

320
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,950
<i>I got startled back then.</i>

321
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,880
<i>Cuz you said it so suddenly.</i>

322
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,310
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

323
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,590
<i>It's okay.</i>

324
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,960
<i>I came home and thought
it over.</i>

325
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,960
<i>Though we just met,
It's possible.</i>

326
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,370
<i>Yeah.</i>

327
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,040
<i>I love you, too.</i>

328
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,860
I heard she's only
a junior in college.

329
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,150
Mr. LEE must be
good with the girls.

330
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,260
How many years
is she younger?

331
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:46,460
I thought he was different.
What a bastard.

332
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,660
Hope she's nice.

333
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,470
But how did they meet?

334
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,040
Mr. PARK introduced them.

335
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,510
That's good.

336
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,010
I hope it works out.

337
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,950
I hope she's nice.

338
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,150
It's only natural.

339
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,750
Even divorced people
get remarried.

340
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,480
One moment, please.

341
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,030
<i>JOO Hyo-sun</i>

342
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,810
0-1-0-2-6-3-1-9-3-2-3...

343
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,340
Why are you here?

344
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,950
Mr. PARK!
Report things on time.

345
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,910
Must I come here
to verify things!

346
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,450
- Hello?
- Excuse me.

347
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,820
- Is this Ms. JOO Hyo-sun?
- Yes?

348
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,360
- How are you these days?
- Pardon?

349
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,560
Who is this?

350
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,240
Ah, this is SK Telecom.

351
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,240
We had a draw to give away

352
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,300
new cell phones.

353
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,010
You've been selected
this month.

354
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,280
- May I have your address?
- I'm not interested.

355
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,540
But it's not a scam.

356
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,550
We're giving it to you for free.

357
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,180
- Just the phone?
- Yes.

358
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,730
I can send it to you
right now.

359
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,160
Your ID, please?

360
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,360
Do I have to sign up
for stuff?

361
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,130
No, not at all.

362
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,660
It's just the phone for free.

363
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,470
I'm in a class, now.

364
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,130
Could you call back later?

365
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,250
Is it okay to answer phones
during class?

366
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,080
What?

367
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,340
Just tell me the address now,

368
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,710
and we'll send it to you.

369
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,710
Hello.

370
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,520
- I'll try the one on the end.
- Okay.

371
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,680
- This?
- No, no...

372
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,550
the one above that.

373
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,890
- Right.
- This?

374
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,060
I'll try that one, too.

375
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,270
Which would you like?

376
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,040
I can't see you, honey.

377
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,210
Hey! I believed you!

378
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,080
Okay. I'll be right there.

379
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,430
- Hey!
- Sorry.

380
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,330
Aren't you a little late

381
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,770
for our date?

382
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,460
Why you!
What time is it?

383
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,790
<i>I really love you!</i>

384
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,030
<i>Wanna get married this week?</i>

385
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,570
<i>DELETE</i>

386
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,090
What's this?
I'm busy. Talk.

387
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,920
- Pay up.
- What?

388
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,860
Money you borrowed from me.

389
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,960
It's around $3,000.
Pay back, now.

390
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,430
What money?

391
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,470
I pitched in for your laptop

392
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,940
and you borrowed on our dates.

393
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,530
And remember
my birthday last year?

394
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,740
You didn't buy me a gift,

395
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,580
but I paid $500 for your suit.

396
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,950
It all adds up to $3,000.

397
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,750
Look.
You broke my laptop.

398
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,660
It cost more to fix it,
so I threw it out.

399
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,790
Your cell phone bill
came to over $700.

400
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,990
I borrowed from you
on our dates?

401
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,530
I bought you drinks, food, clothes,

402
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,360
and took you home on cabs.

403
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,030
How can you ask me
for money?

404
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,940
I cleaned your room,

405
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,600
cooked, and brought you food.

406
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,440
Your salary isn't enough
to pay for all my housework!

407
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,640
Just be thankful
I didn't calculate that in!

408
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,110
You spent money

409
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,710
on our dates?

410
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,290
I always ate before I met you.

411
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,560
When you paid,
I ordered the cheapest stuff.

412
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,390
Still, you gave me looks

413
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,620
and made me feel bad.

414
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,090
- I did not!
- You did.

415
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,530
- Me?
- You did!

416
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,460
If I didn't order the cheapest,
you wouldn't talk all day.

417
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,560
Such a cheapskate.

418
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,070
Do whatever you want!
I'm not paying!

419
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,500
Then,

420
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,700
I'll just get the money
from your girlfriend.

421
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,540
Hyo-sun, was it?

422
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,210
- JOO Hyo-sun
- What?

423
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,970
- What the hell are you doing?
- Number, 010...

424
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,140
- How'd you know!
- Leave it!

425
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,010
- Give it to me!
- Leave it!

426
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,570
- Give it to me!
- No way!

427
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,810
Damn it!

428
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,450
- Damn it!
- Shit!

429
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,530
Hey!

430
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,940
What's with you!

431
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,300
Still not over me?

432
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,200
Don't flatter yourself.

433
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,100
I never liked you.

434
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,580
You followed me around so much,

435
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,440
I dated you out of pity.

436
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,340
So, don't even think about
not paying me!

437
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,660
How could you!

438
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,420
Bro! Big news!

439
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,300
Mr. KIM and Chief SOHN
had an affair!

440
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,890
Mr. KIM's wife is here!

441
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,520
Does everyone break up
like this?

442
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,550
Love is beautiful,

443
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,150
but why is breaking up so ugly?

444
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,590
Because you'll miss it?

445
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,000
Because you want it back?

446
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,100
You can't control love.

447
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,300
You break up because

448
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,000
you don't want to get hurt?

449
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,380
Say, 'I love you' a million times,

450
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,620
but it all ends with one sentence.

451
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,760
Who truly loves someone?

452
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,490
You meet, fall in love,

453
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,190
then break up all by chance.

454
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,460
Life happens all by chance.

455
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,830
There's no meaning.

456
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,900
- Ma'am!
- Dear!

457
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,770
- Stop it! Dear!
- Carry her!

458
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,210
Mr. KIM!

459
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,430
Isn't your phone ringing?

460
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,970
Hello?

461
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,510
Yes. Who's this?

462
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,120
Wait.

463
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,390
How about you pay?

464
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,020
What?

465
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,020
I always pay.
You should pay, too.

466
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,620
- For this?
- Yeah.

467
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,500
Don't want to?

468
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,930
It's okay.

469
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,430
I'll buy.

470
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,500
Okay.

471
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,440
Thanks.

472
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,840
Young!

473
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,050
- How have you been?
- Good.

474
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,350
Here it comes.

475
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,400
I think I ate something bad.

476
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,200
I have an upset stomach.

477
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,130
I'm sorry.

478
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,270
I can't take you home.

479
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,540
I'll go.

480
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,040
I didn't know
you wanted to work abroad.

481
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,210
I'm just looking into it.

482
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,820
Going abroad is nice.

483
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,650
You'd be so popular there.

484
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,190
They love Asian women.

485
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,400
If you're really serious,
tell me.

486
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,970
I'll do what I can to help.

487
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,600
What relationship is bad
from the start?

488
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,330
But as time passed,
I couldn't take it.

489
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,770
That day,

490
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,710
we got free tickets
to a place we never went to.

491
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,380
An amusement park
with bumper cars.

492
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,510
I packed a picnic and went.

493
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,160
We fought big over
riding scary rides and such.

494
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,850
What did he say then?

495
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,160
We bickered from the bat

496
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,990
because it wasn't fun.

497
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,820
He said something,
then I said something.

498
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,830
I can't remember...

499
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,300
Anyway, he's a total jerk.

500
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,940
I think it was a waste of

501
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,170
my time and effort.

502
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,200
He's terrible at work, too.

503
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,400
Always slacking on the job

504
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,850
and getting the numbers wrong.

505
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,980
Covering for his mistakes,

506
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,820
he never got a real paycheck.

507
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,220
His very existence
is a nuisance!

508
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,030
- Hello?
- Hi, hon!

509
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,820
Where are you?

510
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,200
I'm at a mall with friends
to buy clothes.

511
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,200
Well...

512
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,940
I'm a little sick right now.

513
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,570
Can you come by?

514
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,810
What's that noise?

515
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,080
- Huh?
- Let's go!

516
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,520
Hyo-sun?

517
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,790
Must be a celebrity here.
It's crazy!

518
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,920
Who is it?
Take pictures!

519
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,360
I'll call you later.

520
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,550
Hey!

521
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,510
Your guest went to
the washroom, right?

522
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,300
Yes.

523
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,880
I'm in a rush!
Come out! Hurry!

524
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,710
She's out of it.

525
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,950
Young? What's wrong?

526
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,000
Are you okay?

527
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,410
Wake up!

528
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,020
Young? Are you okay?

529
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,620
I'll take you home.

530
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,610
Mister!

531
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,880
Wait!

532
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,480
Where's the nearest hospital?

533
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,680
- Hospital?
- Yes!

534
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,590
- Go straight to the big street.
- And?

535
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,150
- Then turn left.
- Left?

536
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,130
Then, turn right at the lights.

537
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,670
Right?
Was it left?

538
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,230
You'll see when you get there.

539
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,070
Turn left and...

540
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,400
Hey, Mister!
Wait!

541
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,210
Close the door.

542
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,940
How can I!

543
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,010
I'm gonna puke.

544
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,980
Bro!

545
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,740
No!

546
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,810
I just got this
a few weeks ago!

547
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,020
Damn it! Let me in!

548
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,500
Almost killed me!

549
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,710
Why go to Busan?

550
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,010
Don't worry, I'll turn back.

551
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,780
They won't let me cut in.

552
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,560
I...

553
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,330
I get indigestion

554
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,140
and colds a lot.

555
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,800
Young got some pills
for me before.

556
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,040
As soon as I took that,

557
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,240
I'd jump right back to normal.

558
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,110
It worked really well on me.

559
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,110
I must've sent it back
by accident with her stuff.

560
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,620
I should've kept that.

561
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,950
I can't remember

562
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,220
what it's called.

563
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,490
Bastard!

564
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,290
It's been hours.
We're lost

565
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,930
with no hospital in sight.

566
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,570
The plastic smell
makes me wanna puke.

567
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,040
Bro!

568
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,370
Don't rip the bag!

569
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,170
Just drive me home.

570
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,140
We're almost there.

571
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,450
<i>DAEJEON GENERAL HOSPITAL</i>

572
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,510
- Visiting from Seoul?
- No.

573
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,450
On a business trip, then?

574
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,920
That's not it.

575
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,120
I couldn't exit

576
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,850
off the highway.

577
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,120
So,

578
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,260
I circled around

579
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,990
and ended up here.

580
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,400
Bro.

581
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,800
Yeah?

582
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,900
Sorry, I gotta go.

583
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,340
I gotta leave now

584
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,740
or I'll be late for work.

585
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,040
I'll go and tell them

586
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,650
you're really sick.

587
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,850
Yeah.

588
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,450
Take care.

589
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,220
That jerk!

590
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,890
We're 3 hours from Seoul.

591
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,150
I've always wanted a change.

592
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,260
I had it like this

593
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,930
since high school.

594
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,930
Good thing is,

595
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,800
I found this under the bed.

596
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,730
And this, too.

597
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,670
Dong-hee gave it to me
for my birthday.

598
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,040
But I lost the CD.

599
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,240
It's my first time hearing it.

600
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,390
This couple is a match made

601
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,690
in holy matrimony.

602
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,120
You pledge to love
each other forever.

603
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,330
Since, you are now
a married couple...

604
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,900
I got divorced.

605
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,870
What?

606
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,160
What do I do now?

607
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,820
Can I see you for a sec?

608
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,830
Sorry, it's late.

609
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,300
I finally remembered this time.

610
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,230
It's $3,000.

611
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,770
- It's okay. You keep it.
- No. Take it.

612
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,810
I shouldn't have taken it.

613
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,670
How's your girlfriend?

614
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,810
Good.

615
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,970
I'm seeing someone, too.

616
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,680
Really.

617
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,750
Yeah.

618
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,790
Isn't it great
we both found people?

619
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,830
I guess.

620
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,760
It must be over.

621
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,700
I'd better go in
and catch the bouquet.

622
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,900
Okay...

623
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,170
One, two, three!

624
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,180
That's good.

625
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,950
Who'll catch the bouquet?

626
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,180
Will the bride step forward?

627
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,920
Hey.

628
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,200
Know who Ms. JANG is dating?

629
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,590
Young's got a man?

630
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,360
One, two, three!

631
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,600
She didn't have to tell me
she found a new guy.

632
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,600
She just said that
to see how I'll react.

633
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,310
She's like that.

634
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,850
Wanting attention.

635
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,350
If she said,

636
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,880
'It's great we found new people'...

637
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,720
Think I'd run back to her

638
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,050
or something?

639
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,880
Please!

640
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,930
That's so old school.

641
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,920
Let's see...

642
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,850
Yes!

643
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,400
<i>NO MESSAGES</i>

644
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,370
If she really found someone,

645
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,110
that's good.

646
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,410
It's a good thing.

647
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,910
It was rough for her too,

648
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,150
while he dated.

649
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,990
Hope she meets

650
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,220
someone nice.

651
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,200
Hello!

652
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,210
I'm the new intern.

653
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:44,410
- Before starting work...
- Hey!

654
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,470
I joined in workshop...

655
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,210
a workshop for new interns...

656
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,390
I'll explain.

657
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,390
It's to promote teamwork.

658
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,290
We go and drink, eat,

659
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:59,920
play sports, and such.

660
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,300
No need to clap.

661
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,170
Young...

662
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,340
Drink this.

663
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,250
Have some cookies, too.

664
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,180
Who?

665
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,780
- Is it your boyfriend?
- No.

666
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:30,490
Take it.

667
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,260
No, I have lots.

668
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,400
You can have it all.

669
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,260
- It's okay...
- No, I have way too much.

670
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,820
You can have it all.

671
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,260
Enjoy.

672
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:58,850
Nice fresh air.

673
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,790
Ah, Good!

674
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,000
You can't get drunk
at a place like this.

675
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,730
The air is so fresh.

676
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,900
Welcome to

677
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,310
your teamwork retreat.

678
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,770
This is your schedule
for the first day.

679
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,480
From 7 to 8 AM, we'll gather...

680
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:30,910
From 8 to 9 AM,

681
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,990
we'll have orientations

682
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,990
Hope to see you all there.

683
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,820
I hope

684
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,360
- you all enjoy
- What is it?

685
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,870
the workshops here.

686
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:44,760
Thank you.

687
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,710
No way!

688
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,980
Why you!

689
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,850
You reek, man!

690
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,750
- Bro! Bro! Come out for a sec.
- Why?

691
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,760
Come out.

692
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,020
Why?

693
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,960
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

694
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,970
What's up?

695
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,070
Say what you just said.

696
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,460
Sir, I don't think I should.

697
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,840
Just say it!

698
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,170
What is it?

699
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,030
But...

700
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,070
Bro...

701
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,440
Did you know Young was

702
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,840
dating Chief MIN?

703
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:32,880
What?

704
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,510
Wait, sir. I can explain.

705
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,020
They even slept together.

706
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,680
I told you
not to tell him that!

707
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,570
So what? They're adults.
They can sleep together.

708
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,230
We broke up a long time ago.

709
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,000
That's not all!

710
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,800
The bastard took pics of Young

711
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,040
and is showing people.

712
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,610
Right?

713
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,280
- What pics?
- What pics do you think?

714
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,890
Did you see them?

715
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,800
- No...
- Then?

716
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,720
He heard it.

717
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,170
From who? Mr. KIM?

718
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,070
Who else do you think?

719
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,610
I didn't see them.

720
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,540
I just heard about them.

721
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,870
Please...

722
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,880
Just tell us everything.

723
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,210
You know
they were a serious couple.

724
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,550
Everyone knows about it.

725
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,850
Were the pics taken

726
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,880
with consent?

727
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,090
If not, it's a crime!

728
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,160
They're not dating
or anything.

729
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:52,660
What is it, then?

730
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,090
Just slept together once.

731
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,360
What are you saying!

732
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,290
Before coming here,

733
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:01,130
Young applied to work abroad.

734
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,470
Anywhere abroad.

735
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,970
If she's willing to leave,

736
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,010
it means they're not dating.

737
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,180
But...

738
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,150
How do you know?

739
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,040
Who told you?

740
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,280
I overheard by chance.

741
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,920
Tell me! Who said that!

742
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,720
- Man...
- Sit down.

743
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,290
Get him!

744
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,590
Sit here!

745
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,960
Ouch! Ouch!

746
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,760
Damn it!

747
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,170
Tell me! Who told you!

748
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,600
It was Chief SOHN!

749
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,670
You're not saying that
because she's not here, are you?

750
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,940
Don't you know
SOHN and MIN are close?

751
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,740
And Chief SOHN saw the pics.

752
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,710
Give me her home phone number.

753
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,810
How would I know?

754
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,290
I know you know!
So, spill it!

755
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,260
Hello?

756
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:06,900
Yes...

757
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:10,670
Hee-yeon's hotel?

758
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,740
Why do you want to know?

759
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:17,070
- Who is it?
- What's Hee-yeon's hotel number?

760
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,720
- Don't know.
- Who is it?

761
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,750
It's an emergency.

762
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,410
The bank's been robbed.

763
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,260
Hello?

764
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:38,670
What?

765
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,100
Hey! Wake up!

766
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,180
Something's wrong.
The bank's been robbed.

767
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,380
- What?
- Hurry!

768
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,440
Hello?

769
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,710
- Chief, it's Dong-hee.
- Hi.

770
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:58,750
Did Chief MIN sleep with Young?

771
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,250
What?

772
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,580
I'm with Mr. KIM right now.

773
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,060
He said you told him.

774
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:07,960
What are you talking about?

775
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,100
Answer me!

776
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,700
Did they sleep together or not?

777
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:16,970
Yes...

778
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,610
MIN said that himself?

779
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,970
Yes...

780
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,210
So, they're dating?

781
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,410
No, it's not that.

782
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,450
Then, what?

783
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,780
What is this?

784
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,410
We'll talk about that
back in Seoul. Okay?

785
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,650
It's the middle of the night.

786
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,090
Then, what are they!

787
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,430
Let's talk about this in Seoul.

788
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,170
What about the robbery?

789
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,130
Shit! Who cares!

790
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,230
I'm asking if they slept

791
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,300
together or not!

792
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,930
- Give me the phone.
- I heard that...

793
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:54,310
...bastard took pics of Young!

794
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,280
Answer me!

795
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,710
Give me the phone!

796
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:07,060
Did you just yell at me?

797
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,750
Who cares if they did or not!

798
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,560
Yes! They slept together!

799
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,200
Young hit on him, slept with him,

800
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,790
then didn't take his calls.

801
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,160
MIN got really drunk over that
and told me.

802
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,330
Pics?

803
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:21,300
Think there's much
to look at?

804
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,340
It's her fault
for getting them taken.

805
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,010
How can you call me like this

806
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,570
on my honeymoon!

807
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,180
Hee-yeon...

808
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,720
I got divorced
because of you.

809
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,720
You're all I have.

810
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,910
I love you.

811
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,380
Hee-yeon, I miss you.

812
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,550
I really, really love you.

813
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,860
You know I love...

814
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,460
So?

815
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:56,600
They really slept together?

816
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,010
Bro!

817
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:07,710
Bro!

818
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,220
Bro!

819
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,930
Love shot!

820
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,540
Love shot!

821
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,740
Kiss! Kiss!

822
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,680
- So nice!
- They suit each other!

823
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:44,180
Chief?

824
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,850
- A word with you?
- They suit each other.

825
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,060
Hi, Mr. LEE.

826
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,720
This is Mr. LEE

827
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:51,520
- and this is my co-worker...
- Not interested.

828
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:52,890
Let's step outside.

829
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,590
Bro! Stop.

830
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,090
- Relax.
- Okay.

831
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,190
Let go! Damn it!

832
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,270
I'd get up if I were you.

833
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,680
What did you just say?

834
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,470
Are you dating JANG Young?

835
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:09,740
JANG Young?

836
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,680
Ms. JANG?

837
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,250
Why would I date her?

838
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,040
So, you just fooled around
with her?

839
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,420
Fine.

840
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,290
Let's go talk outside.
Let's go.

841
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,360
- Give me your cell.
- What?

842
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,430
Give me your phone!
You took pics!

843
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:36,000
I don't know what you heard,

844
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,030
but it's not what you think.

845
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,810
Fine. Let's go out and talk.

846
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,110
I'll be back soon.
Wait here.

847
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,870
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go outside. Let go!

848
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:49,680
You son of a bitch!

849
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,120
I said give me your cell phone!

850
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,610
Mr. LEE!

851
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,790
I'm your superior.

852
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,560
Shit!

853
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,680
JANG Young!

854
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,080
The man you're dating
is Chief MIN?

855
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,700
What are you doing in
someone else's room!

856
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,100
Stop it!

857
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,630
- Stop it!
- Back off!

858
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:13,970
Hey!

859
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,130
Why did you do it!

860
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,460
Answer me!

861
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,540
What?

862
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,240
Know what that bastard

863
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,110
is going around doing?

864
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:24,980
Hey!

865
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,950
Did you know or not!

866
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,040
Please!

867
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:32,490
You're such a bitch!

868
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,510
LEE Dong-hee!

869
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,640
Where are you going!

870
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:59,450
Hey!

871
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,940
Stop! Going to Seoul!

872
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,680
What's it to you?

873
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,650
Why do you care

874
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:10,750
who I date or not?

875
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,820
You're going way overboard!

876
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,530
Shit! You stupid!

877
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,300
Fine! It doesn't matter!

878
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,870
Who you date

879
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,670
and who you get hurt from!

880
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:26,070
But can't you pick
the right guy?

881
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,140
Why date a damn bastard

882
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,040
and make shitty rumors!

883
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,180
Are you out of your mind?

884
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,540
Know what people are saying
about you?

885
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,350
They're calling you...

886
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:44,960
I could kill everyone

887
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,860
who know!

888
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,200
I'm nowhere near

889
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:50,870
going overboard!

890
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,270
That's my business.

891
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,240
It doesn't concern you.

892
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,410
You have no right
to be like this.

893
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,280
Fine.

894
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:04,810
I'm the crazy bastard.

895
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:08,180
All because of you!
Shit, I'm the fool!

896
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,220
We broke up a long time ago!
What's with you!

897
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,660
Hey!

898
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,300
Why charge in

899
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,460
and makes things awkward!

900
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,790
You have no right
to yell at me!

901
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:27,470
I slept with him! So what!

902
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,570
What about you!

903
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:31,940
Why yell at me!

904
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,540
Step aside, please!

905
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,190
Mr. LEE just hit Chief MIN.

906
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,320
Mr. LEE dated Ms. JANG.

907
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,690
Mr. LEE called Chief SOHN and asked

908
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,890
if Chief MIN slept with Ms. JANG.

909
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,730
But Chief SOHN is on
her honeymoon.

910
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,640
Then, Mr. KIM said he loved
Chief SOHN.

911
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:06,370
I had no idea banks
would be like this.

912
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,270
I think I'll fit right in.

913
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,450
Hey!

914
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,010
You son of a bitch!

915
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,560
Watch it!
You almost killed me!

916
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,290
<i>DONG-HEE</i>

917
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:05,820
Where are you?

918
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,800
Just...

919
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,100
Just out.

920
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:12,800
And you?

921
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:14,980
Just outside, too.

922
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,080
I'll come to you.

923
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,190
No, I'll come.

924
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,720
No, we'll miss each other.

925
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,560
Let's meet back
where we left.

926
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,160
Remember?
Think you can find it?

927
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,560
Yes...

928
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,830
Then, I'll see you there.

929
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,100
I'm on my way.

930
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,270
I'm on my way, too.

931
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,820
What the hell!

932
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,060
Shit. Where am I?

933
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:19,940
Where was it?

934
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,390
Young!

935
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:47,930
Young!

936
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,510
Shit...

937
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,890
Hello?

938
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:10,560
Hello?

939
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:12,230
Where are you!

940
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,590
Here!

941
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,300
What are you doing there?

942
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,000
Going to see you.

943
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,510
How'd you get down there?

944
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:32,450
Don't know.

945
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,680
I just kept walking.

946
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,390
Careful! It's slippery!

947
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,650
Are you okay?

948
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,300
Can't do it.

949
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:50,760
I'm embarrassed to go back.

950
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:53,590
What do I do?

951
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,010
Texting who?

952
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:05,680
PARK.

953
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,910
To bring back our stuff.

954
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,690
Do you remember?

955
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,370
How big our last fight was?

956
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,400
What was it about?

957
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:29,900
I don't really remember, either.

958
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:32,440
You, too?

959
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,740
I remember fighting,
but can't remember why.

960
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,810
You know what?

961
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,950
There's an 82% chance of a couple

962
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,720
getting back together.

963
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,160
And only 3%

964
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,560
out of them stay together.

965
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:59,030
97% of them break up again.

966
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,400
Why?

967
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,930
For the same reasons
they broke up.

968
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,300
Wanna go together?

969
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:04,800
I'm scared.

970
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:06,420
Of what?

971
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:09,700
Think we can fit in the 3%?

972
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,650
You know what?

973
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:23,810
The lottery...

974
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:28,120
The chance of winning
is 1 in 1.84 million.

975
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,860
But...

976
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:34,360
there's still a winner

977
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:36,890
every week.

978
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:39,500
So,

979
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,760
a 3% chance

980
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:46,610
is big.

981
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,910
That's huge.

982
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,430
Get on!

983
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:55,070
- What?
- It's strange.

984
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:57,980
What is?

985
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:59,940
I'm so nervous.

986
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:05,510
It feels like the first time.

987
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,420
I'm nervous, too.

988
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:28,040
Be sure to check on

989
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:29,970
the latest mortgage terms.

990
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,740
The complaints never stop.

991
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:32,980
- Never stop.
- PARK!

992
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,940
With customers around,
act diligent if you must.

993
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,450
Especially...

994
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:42,860
Check on the mortgage rates.

995
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,950
If you have any questions,

996
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:47,420
- talk to Mr. KIM...
- You fool!

997
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,390
Last but not least,
Mr. LEE?

998
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,370
Hello, sir.

999
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:02,210
You can date,
but don't hit people.

1000
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:05,180
I'm scared to come to work.

1001
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:09,110
- Get to work everyone!
- Yes, sir!

1002
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,520
Let's get to work.

1003
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,560
I'll photocopy it.

1004
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:47,760
Hey!

1005
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:49,190
You're so dead!

1006
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:50,190
- Why?
- Come here!

1007
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,460
- Come here! Come here!
- You look way prettier!

1008
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,890
Come here you!

1009
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,160
Surrender!

1010
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:09,640
- What did you say?

1011
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,080
- Something came up at home.

1012
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:12,310
Really? Good thinking.

1013
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,780
- What should we eat?
- Anything.

1014
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,660
So, who's not coming today?

1015
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,990
Ms. JANG and Mr. LEE?

1016
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,220
What if they ran off together?

1017
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,060
Should we try calling them?

1018
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:27,990
Go ahead.

1019
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,400
They could be together.

1020
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,390
You dated me to pass time?

1021
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,850
That's not it.

1022
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,190
You said, you liked me.

1023
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,200
You bastard.

1024
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:24,410
Hello.

1025
01:09:25,150 --> 01:09:26,880
- You're back?
- Miss you.

1026
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,490
- Did you have fun?
- How was it?

1027
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,320
You're dating Mr. LEE again?

1028
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:36,860
Yes.

1029
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:39,930
That's good.

1030
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,860
I got divorced.

1031
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:53,080
How can you ruin my life
like that!

1032
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,380
It wasn't on purpose!

1033
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,780
I didn't know he was listening!

1034
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:57,410
How could you not!

1035
01:09:57,490 --> 01:09:58,390
I was on a honeymoon!

1036
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,320
How can you say that?

1037
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:01,290
Don't you know how I feel?

1038
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,290
Forget it!
I don't want to see you!

1039
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:06,290
- Let go!
- Come back!

1040
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,390
Hee-yeon!

1041
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,140
Hey!

1042
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:27,010
The divorce isn't because
of me, right?

1043
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,080
Can't say it's not.

1044
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,230
Have a good trip?

1045
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,970
Thanks to you.

1046
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,670
I'm sorry for calling

1047
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,770
so late at night.

1048
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,210
$50,000.
The cost of the wedding.

1049
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,050
If I sue you for compensation,

1050
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:11,090
how much can you fork up?

1051
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:16,090
But who needs money.

1052
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,890
Life is more important,

1053
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,000
- right?
- That's right.

1054
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,710
Enjoy.

1055
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:46,350
Hello?

1056
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,120
Is this Ms. JANG Young?

1057
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,090
Yes, it is.

1058
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,160
- Do you know Hyo-sun?
- Stop it.

1059
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,500
What?

1060
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,730
Dong-hee's ex-girlfriend?

1061
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:00,470
I'm Hyo-sun's friend.

1062
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:02,070
How could you!

1063
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,170
- Let go!
- Stop it! Hang up!

1064
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,540
Stop it!

1065
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,900

<i>JOO HYO-SUN</i>

1068
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,300
- Want some rice?
- Sure.

1069
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:06,270
Mix it.

1070
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:14,310
I was thinking about

1071
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:17,050
when we broke up.

1072
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:18,010
Hmm?

1073
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,160
There's a reason why
we can't remember.

1074
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:27,050
Because...

1075
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:29,630
it wasn't special.

1076
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,130
We fought over the same things

1077
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:37,230
and made up, so we don't remember.

1078
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,040
We dated long

1079
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,040
and got too used to things.

1080
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:48,010
But it's not necessarily

1081
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:51,540
a bad thing.

1082
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:56,120
Maybe we...

1083
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:00,690
broke up because

1084
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:02,800
we needed a change.

1085
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:05,460
We can't notice,
if we're too used to things.

1086
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,570
Right. That's a good point.

1087
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,800
So, I was thinking.

1088
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:16,300
Should we get married?

1089
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,350
Or not...

1090
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,180
Not right away.
Let's just think about it.

1091
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:34,060
There's no big rush

1092
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:36,430
or anything.

1093
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:45,830
It's just an idea.

1094
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,940
Don't feel burdened
or anything.

1095
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,780
Let's do it.

1096
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,680
- Really?
- Yes,

1097
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:03,960
let's do it.

1098
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,870
- Seriously?
- Yes!

1099
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,060
Do it.

1100
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:14,960
Let's eat!

1101
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,470
I'm almost there.

1102
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:23,670
It's okay.

1103
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,650
I should be

1104
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:27,240
thankful for this, instead

1105
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:29,110
of getting fired.

1106
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:32,580
I'll call you when it's over.

1112
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:18,500

1114
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,730
Please read it over slowly.

1115
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:28,040
Look at the summary
on the board.

1116

1129
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,680
Someone I know.

1130
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:45,780
I came to give you this.

- Thanks.
- Drink it.

1132
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,440
Does your boyfriend
know about me?

1133
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:11,310
Of course not.

1134
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:14,640
Is he better than me?

01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:17,480
Please. Don't talk now.

1136
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:20,880
Bathroom break.

Why?

1139
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:48,580
I was just about
to go back in.

1140
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,410
It's boring.

1141
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,250
I thought so, too.

1142
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,320
Wanna go eat?

1143
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,260
Okay!

1144
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:08,700
Look here.

1145
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:10,900
If you spend over $50,

1146
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:12,570
you get free passes
to an amusement park.

1147
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:14,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

1148
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:17,310
How much did we order?

1149
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:19,310
We just need to order one more.

1150
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:20,850
We can take leftovers home.

1151
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:22,980
Then, let's order.

1152
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:27,590
Excuse me!
May I have the menu?

1153
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,120
Let's go on a weekday.

1154
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:31,590
There will be less people.

1155
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:32,920
Good idea.

01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,830
No...

1159
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:43,830
It's nothing.

1160
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,700
Are you hiding something
from me?

1161
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:49,040
What? No.

1162
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,870
- Really?
- Yes.

1163
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,250
By the way...

1164
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:03,690
Chief MIN apologized
a few days ago.

1165
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:05,820
What?

1166
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,990
He said he was wrong

1167
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,800
and felt sorry to you, too.

1168
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,300
When?

1169
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,540
Recently,

1170
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,930
through Messenger.

1171
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,670
So, what did you say?

1172
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:21,740
It's okay.

1173
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,050
You accepted it?

1174
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,210
You accepted
the bastard's apology?

1175
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:34,280
Why did you listen to that?

1176
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:39,890
What else did he say?

1177
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,930
That was it...

1178
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:04,150
I'll head in first.
Go home safely.

1179
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:05,680
Okay, bye.

1180
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:08,590
- Thanks for bringing me home.
- No need.

1181
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:09,790
I'd better go.

1182
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,120
- Bye.
- Bye.

1183
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,190
Things aren't the same

1184
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:18,370
after we got back together.

1185
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:23,470
It's like walking on thin ice.

1186
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:24,630
Anxious and insecure.

1187
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:28,940
Like you're obsessed
trying not to fight.

1188
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:32,270
We should try not fight

1189
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:35,280
over small things.

1190
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:36,640
It takes effort.

1191
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:39,410
It'll get better, slowly.

1192
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:42,820
We know each other's feelings.

1193
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:46,620
Soon, everything will be
like before.

1194
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,690
We're both trying
to make it work this time.

1195
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:51,620
It'll work.

1196
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:53,430
She was drunk.

1197
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:58,160
- So?
- So, I put her down.

1198
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:01,840
She was so drunk
and out of it.

1199
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:02,810
You stripped her?

1200
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:04,000
Even her underwear!

1201
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,960
But she suddenly started puking

1202
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,290
all over the bed.

1203
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,350
What are you talking about!

1204
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,590
Last time, you said
I could cancel it!

1205
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:24,320
Yes, but now it's past...

1206
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:26,130
Do you think I'm stupid?

1207
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:28,400
After all my years here!

1208
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:29,960
I can explain, sir.

1209
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:32,300
It says here in the contract.

1210
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:34,100
And we all explained it to you

1211
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,040
when you signed on, sir.

1212
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:37,770
So, please stop arguing.

1213
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,410
Little bastard!

1214
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:41,140
What did you say?

1215
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:42,680
Argue?

1216
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:43,840
Shit!

1217
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,590
Why are you cursing at me!

1218
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:49,020
You son of a bitch!

1219
01:22:58,430 --> 01:22:59,460
I'm sorry.

1220
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:01,960
I thought he was a thief.

1221
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,490
What's with Dong-hee?

1222
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:19,380
He's acting weird.

1223
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:20,880
So temperamental.

1224
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:24,360
Did you two fight again?

1225
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:26,790
No, not at all.

1226
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:41,570
<i>NOTICE
LEE Dong-hee has been demoted</i>

1227
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:47,270
Ms. JANG!

1228
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,350
I brought some coffee for you.

1229
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,420
- Going somewhere?
- Out on a job.

1230
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:59,560
Wanna go out for dinner?

1231
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:01,900
I don't know
when I'll be done.

1232
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,730
- I'll call you.
- Yeah.

1233
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,500
- See ya.
- Bye.

1234
01:24:15,210 --> 01:24:16,510
I love her.

1235
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:18,770
Of course I love her.

1236
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,780
She's always on my mind.

1237
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,120
I can't stop thinking about her.

1238
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,480
Everything's the same,

1239
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,330
but something's changed.

1240
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:35,560
No! Stop bothering me.

1241
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:37,290
Ma'am, it's a great plan.

1242
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,490
It's okay!

1243
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:40,230
I can bring it by

1244
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,500
whenever you want.

1245
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:44,160
We're all having drinks after work.

1246
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:45,670
Wanna come, too?

1247
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:48,000
- I have a date.
- Please...

1248
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:50,170
Hang out with us sometimes,

1249
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,010
not just Mr. LEE.

1250
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,310
Next time.

1251
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,710
- Fine. I'll get going.
- Bye.

1252
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:00,220
We didn't break up for long,

1253
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,280
but things changed.

1254
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,780
Why can't it be like before?

1255
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:12,000
<i>Ms. JANG</i>

1256
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:16,170
I should try harder

1257
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:18,540
to please her and such.

1258
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,070
How would I know?

1259
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:24,370
If he sees your text,

1260
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:26,480
he'll call.

1261
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,850
Okay.

1262
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:36,380
Did you two fight again?

1263
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,150
It's not that.

1264
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:40,960
Then, why make me lie?

1265
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:47,800
After all the fuss,
what's with you two?

1266
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,600
The customer cannot be reached...

1267
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,310
- Here.
- Hi!

1268
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,850
Young came, too?

1269
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,310
I thought you were busy.

1270
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:06,580
I was.

1271
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,790
Let's have drinks.
Can I sit here?

1272
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:09,650
- Yes.

1273
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,020
Who was here?

1274
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:13,890
- Dong-hee?
- Yes.

1275
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:18,800
You came?

1276
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:23,140
Can you believe that?

1277
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:30,380
- I'll go buy cigarettes.
- I have some. Here.

1278
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,940
No. I need mine.

1279
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,820
Hello?
Yes, hon.

1280
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:37,990
I'm out with my co-workers.

1281
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:39,210
- Hey!
- Yes?

1282
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:40,650
Where's Mr. PARK?

1283
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,250
He went to the bathroom.
I'll go take this call.

1284
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:44,850
Yes, hon.

1285
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:38,410
Where is everybody?

1286
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:41,510
Did you sleep in the bathroom?

1287
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:44,280
How'd you know
I dozed off?

1288
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:49,590
Take care.

1289
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,860
- I'm going. Bye.
- Bye.

1290
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:13,400
Young!

1291
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:21,510
Well...

1292
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,160
Let's take a trip, tomorrow.

1293
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:28,860
Remember the amusement park
coupons we got?

1294
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,230
Let's take the day off,

1295
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:34,630
have fun, and relieve stress.

1296
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,230
Let's pack some food

1297
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:39,770
and go.

1298
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:43,440
- Okay.
- Really?

1299
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:45,880
We're going, then.

1300
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,410
Yes.

1301
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:51,020
Then, see you tomorrow.

1302
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:52,820
Okay. Bye.

1303
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:30,820
- Hello?
- Were you asleep?

1304
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,360
What? Of course not.
I'm on my way.

1305
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:35,620
Where are you?

1306
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,160
You are?

1307
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,230
We're really going?

1308
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,060
Of course.
Is something wrong?

1309
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:45,130
No, but...

1310
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:47,240
Okay, let's go.

1311
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,310
I'll see you there.

1312
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,810
See you later.

1313
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:06,560
She called because
it's raining...

1314
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:14,940
Where are you exactly?

1315
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:19,540
I'll come to you.

1316
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:20,910
Where are you?

1317
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:23,340
Hey!

1318
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,910
Why are you here?

1319
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:32,920
It's raining.

1320
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:37,150
But we agreed to meet outside.

1321
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:39,490
You came late.

1322
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,090
Okay. Let's drop it.

1323
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:46,130
Two people.

1324
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,230
This expired last week.

1325
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:54,470
What?
We can't use that?

1326
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:56,440
You'll have to buy the tickets.

1327
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:10,110
Should we go in

1328
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,620
or not?

1329
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:24,440
- Smile for the camera.
- Okay.

1330
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:39,380
Is it bad?

1331
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:41,620
No,

1332
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:43,450
it's delicious.

1333
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:45,250
Have some of this, too.

1334
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:49,260
It's good.

1335
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,680
- I'll go buy drinks.
- Sure.

1336
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:05,470
Young!

1337
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,740
JANG Young!

1338
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,020
What's with you?

1339
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,500
What are you doing!

1340
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,470
I'm leaving.
I can't take it any longer.

1341
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,140
Stop!

1342
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,910
Stop right there!

1343
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:53,050
Hey!

1344
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:04,660
What's wrong with you?

1345
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:07,230
You always have your way!

1346
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,660
Me? Have my way?

1347
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:13,430
Can't you see me

1348
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:15,100
catering to what you want?

1349
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:18,040
I'm doing everything I can

1350
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:20,340
to make this work!

1351
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:21,380
I'm doing nothing!

1352
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,110
Have my way?

1353
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,510
Be honest for a change!

1354
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,620
Don't pretend to have fun

1355
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:29,250
out of a sense of duty!

1356
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:32,190
Say you didn't want to come

1357
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:33,660
and be here with me!

1358
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,590
You're always like this!

1359
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,200
From before,

1360
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,530
you make me feel bad!

1361
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:44,900
You haven't changed a bit.

1362
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,010
You're still the same.

1363
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:50,140
I'm sick and tired of trying

1364
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:51,900
to make things work by myself.

1365
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:54,140
If you want to break up,
say it!

1366
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:57,140
I won't blame you!

1367
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,950
So, just say it!

1368
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:01,780
You say it.

1369
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:04,050
What?

1370
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:06,290
Why are you telling me
to say it?

1371
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:12,330
Think you changed?
You're just the same!

1372
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:15,260
Always saying
how hard this is for you.

1373
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,940
You're pulling
the same old lines!

1374
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:20,440
It's hard for me, too!

1375
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:24,140
I don't know
what to do around you.

1376
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:27,780
I'm afraid you'll regret

1377
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,480
being back with me.

1378
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,210
I can't even breathe.

1379
01:35:33,190 --> 01:35:35,550
But you're just thinking
of yourself!

1380
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,420
How hard it is for you!

1381
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:39,920
How much you're trying!

1382
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:42,020
All you see is you!

1383
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:43,460
It's not just you!

1384
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,160
Can't you see how crazy

1385
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:50,390
this is making me?

1386
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:54,170
So you say it.

1387
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:57,400
If you want to break up, say it.

1388
01:35:58,180 --> 01:36:00,010
I'm sick of it.

1389
01:36:04,620 --> 01:36:06,550
Do you even love me?

1390
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:12,680
Are we in a relationship here?

1391
01:36:39,050 --> 01:36:40,280
I remember now.

1392
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:44,280
We couldn't remember

1393
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:47,060
what we fought about last time.

1394
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:52,290
It all came back
when we were fighting.

1395
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,990
Yeah,

1396
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:58,000
I remembered it, too.

1397
01:37:00,670 --> 01:37:03,870
I asked if we're dating
because we're in love then, too.

1398
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:13,350
I'll be good.

1399
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:17,090
You did your best.

1400
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,420
Yes,

1401
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:28,190
you were good to me.

1402
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:31,740
Yes,

1403
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:34,040
we both tried really hard.

1404
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:39,270
Does it hurt?

1405
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,050
I'm okay.

1406
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:50,520
It stopped raining.

1407
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:53,890
Yeah...

1408
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:01,100
Young,

1409
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,890
wanna ride that before we go?

1410
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:09,370
I can't ride scary rides.

1411
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:14,140
I can't either.

1412
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:20,020
Still, let's try it.

1413
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:23,250
We should try it for fun.

1414
01:39:11,370 --> 01:39:14,100
I'm the crazy fool!

1415
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,970
Why are you listening to him!

1416
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,520
I always ordered
the cheapest stuff.

1417
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:35,760
This is crazy.

1418
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,060
I'm scared.

1419
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:43,070
Wanna go together?

1420
01:40:03,190 --> 01:40:04,520
What do you know?

1421
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:06,490
You screwed up, too!

1422
01:40:07,330 --> 01:40:09,990
Do you still like me?

1423
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,970
Get on!

1424
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:59,910
That's how we broke up.

1425
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,950
That was the end.

1426
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:10,490
I'll get going.

1427
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:12,750
Okay...

1428
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:17,160
Bye.

1429
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:28,730
When we broke up,
there wasn't much to say.

1430
01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:31,510
We've been through this
many times.

1431
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:36,910
Dong-hee is probably watching

1432
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:40,350
me go, like always.

1433
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:52,900
Our love was

1434
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:56,630
not sweet, beautiful,

1435
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:59,500
or full of excitement.

1436
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:03,170
It was a normal,

1437
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:06,840
ordinary relationship.

1438
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:12,350
But we were both sincere.

1439
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:16,420
We really loved each other.

1440
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,360
Probably

1441
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:22,720
the most magical thing
to happen in my life.

- This comedian.

1443
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:44,680
I may not remember

1444
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,880
why we broke up again.

1445
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:49,650
Though I try hard to remember,

1446
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:54,720
our fights will grow faint.

1447
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,760
Like this scar.

1448
01:43:00,370 --> 01:43:03,100
When it's all healed,

1449
01:43:03,770 --> 01:43:06,570
I'll find someone else,

1450
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,000
right?

- Can you hear me?
- Chief?

01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:34,500
Yes.

Yes, sir!

1456
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:39,670
You called?

1457
01:43:39,740 --> 01:43:42,370
- Always so slow to respond.
- Sorry, sir.

1458
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:44,400
Take this.

1459
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,150
It's from headquarters.

Hear that, hon?

Why buy?
