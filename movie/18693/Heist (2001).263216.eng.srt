00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:29,764
                    FINE.

591
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:31,365
Pinky:
JOE, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

592
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:34,567
    JOE?

593
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:38,470
WHAT THE HELL IS IT?!

594
00:31:38,472 --> 00:31:40,004
            THEY FOUND THE CAR.

595
00:31:43,308 --> 00:31:44,440
WHAT CAR?

596
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:45,641
            THE STATION WAGON.

597
00:31:45,643 --> 00:31:46,975
             THE COPS FOUND IT.

598
00:31:46,977 --> 00:31:48,643
        Joe: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
        THEY FOUND IT?

599
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:49,677
        HOW COULD THEY FIND IT?

600
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,412
        I TOLD YOU
        TO DITCH THE CAR...

601
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:54,147
            I--I--I STOPPED OFF
            TO SEE MY NIECE.

602
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,216
DID YOU WIPE IT DOWN?

603
00:31:57,218 --> 00:31:59,117
            YOU STOPPED OFF
            TO SEE YOUR NIECE?

604
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,952
DID YOU WIPE IT DOWN?

605
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:04,288
            I LEFT MY CLIPBOARD
            IN THE CAR.

606
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,857
WHAT DOES THIS
DO TO THE JOB?

607
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,159
                YOU LEFT
                YOUR CLIPBOARD?

608
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:11,361
        I--YOU KNOW, MY LEG
        WAS TROUBLING ME, BOB.

609
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:14,430
            PINK, THE JOB
            IS ON THE CLIPBOARD.

610
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,431
WHAT ABOUT THE JOB?

611
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,833
            Bobby: THE WHOLE JOB
            IS ON THE CLIPBOARD.

612
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,601
JOB STANDS.

613
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:20,602
            WHAT ARE YOU,
            OUT OF YOUR MIND?

614
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:21,769
                Jimmy:
                THE JOB STANDS?

615
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:22,903
        THE JOB IS BUST.

616
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:24,037
        THIS PLACE IS BURNED.

00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:38,248
     YOU WANT TO RUN THIS SHOW?!

00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,516
    IT'S FUN TO PLAY PRETEND.

00:32:40,518 --> 00:32:41,750
             YOU GONNA ROLL OVER

00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:43,685

00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:56,026
                JOE...

633
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:58,762
            THE JOB IS DEAD.

644
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:25,749

00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:28,451
AW, FUCK THE CAR, PINK.

646
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,286

00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:53,015
                THAT'S RIGHT.

685
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:55,117
WELL, YOU GET GONE, TOO.

686
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:03,958
YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE LOVED
TO DO THAT SWISS JOB.

687
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,359
        IT'S A GOOD PLAN.

688
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:07,327
NEVER LIKED THE SWISS.
THEY MAKE THEM LITTLE CLOCKS,

689
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:08,828
THESE 2 COCKSUCKERS
COME OUT OF 'EM.

690
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,063
THESE LITTLE HAMMERS
HIT EACH OTHER ON THE HEAD.

691
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:13,932
WHAT KIND OF SICK
MENTALITY IS THAT?

692
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:15,767
YOU TAKE CARE, PALLY.

693
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,101
        OH.

00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:19,703
        YOU GIVE BOBBY'S
        SHARE TO HIM.

695
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:21,404
    YEAH.

696
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,605
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO FOR CASH?

697
00:35:23,607 --> 00:35:26,040
        WE'RE GONNA TAKE DOWN
        THE BOAT GUY TONIGHT.

698
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,074
YOU'RE TAKING DOWN
YOUR BOAT GUY?

699
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,075
                YEAH.

701
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:31,044
            I'M SELLING MY BOAT.

702
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,345
AND THEN?

703
00:35:33,081 --> 00:35:34,680
            THEN I'M GONNA
            TAKE MY BOAT BACK.

00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:40,116
        SEE YA LATER, PINKY.

706
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:41,550
IT'S A SHAME, YOU KNOW WHAT?

707
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:43,218
WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO ACTUALLY DO THE THING.

708
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,620
THE SWISS JOB.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLAN.

709
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:46,454
                CUTE, HUH?

710
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:48,389
CUTE AS A PAIL
FULL OF KITTENS.

711
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:50,891
        SAY GOOD-BYE
        TO YOUR NIECE FOR ME.

712
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:52,392
YOU BET, PAL.

713
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:18,250
Freccia: HEY!

714
00:36:18,252 --> 00:36:19,851
         PUT IT OUT.

715
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:21,886
        PUT IT OUT!
        PUT THE CIGAR OUT!

716
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,053
                TOLD HIM.

717
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,455
        YEAH. I'M SOR--
        WE'VE GOT A FUEL LEAK.

718
00:36:25,457 --> 00:36:26,823
        TRYING TO PUT
        YOUR CLEAT IN.

719
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,024
PUT YOUR ARROW CLEAT IN.

720
00:36:28,026 --> 00:36:29,291
        IT WAS HER IDEA.

721
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:30,392
TO PUT YOUR STAMP ON IT.

722
00:36:30,394 --> 00:36:32,026
        YEAH, I WAS PUTTING
        THE CLEAT IN,

723
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:33,460
        AND DAMNED IF I DIDN'T
        CUT THE FUEL LINE.

724
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:37,030
I WANTED--I WANTED
TO TAKE HER OUT TONIGHT.

725
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:38,364
            I KNOW YOU DID, SIR.
            AND I'M JUST--

729
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,904

00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,007
            I WANT HER
            REBALLASTED.

    WHY NOW? WHAT IS IT
    ALL OF A SUDDEN--

    EVERYBODY NEEDS MONEY.

    THAT'S WHY
    THEY CALL IT MONEY.

SHE SEEMS TO ENJOY IT.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

927
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:22,678
            HE'S SCARED.

928
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,046
I'VE NEVER KNOWN HIM
TO BE SCARED.

929
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:25,280
            SHE SAYS
            HE'S GETTING OLD.

930
00:47:25,282 --> 00:47:26,881
SHE SAID THAT?

931
00:47:26,883 --> 00:47:27,982
        HE'S BROKE. HE'S TIRED.

932
00:47:27,984 --> 00:47:29,216
        THE COPS ARE
        LOOKING FOR HIM.

933
00:47:29,218 --> 00:47:30,283
        HE DON'T WANNA GO
        DOWN THERE WITH NOTHING.

934
00:47:30,285 --> 00:47:32,018
        SHE SAYS HE WANTS
        TO PLAY BALL.

935
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,686
WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE HER?

936
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:35,721
WHY THE FUCK
DOES HE SEND HER HERE?

937
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:37,155
        SHE CAME TO ME.

938
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:39,857
            TO YOU? OH...

            TO COME TO YOU?

940
00:47:41,627 --> 00:47:43,627
I THINK SHE CAME TO ME
ON HER OWN.

941
00:47:43,629 --> 00:47:45,095
        YEAH, BUT, NO--NO.

942
00:47:45,097 --> 00:47:47,864
        AS RATIONAL MEN, DON'T
        WE HAVE TO DOUBT HER?

943
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,966
SHE THINKS THE GUY'S WEAK.
SHE'S SCARED.

        HOW WOULD YOU TEST
        HER SINCERITY?

THE SHAKES.

SOME OTHER PEOPLE
MISTAKE IT FOR COWARDICE.

MAYBE YOU WANNA PRAY ABOUT IT.

963
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,990
        I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS MAN.

964

THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH PRAYER.

965

NEXT TO HIS HEART...

00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:07,596
WE USED TO MOCK HIM.

969
00:49:07,598 --> 00:49:09,831
THAT BIBLE STOPPED A BULLET.

970
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,065
                NO SHIT.

HAND TO GOD, THAT BIBLE
STOPPED A BULLET.

00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:15,569
IT WOULD HAVE RUINED
THAT FUCKER'S HEART.

00:49:15,571 --> 00:49:18,572
AND HAD HE HAD ANOTHER BIBLE
IN FRONT OF HIS FACE,

BE ALIVE TODAY.
