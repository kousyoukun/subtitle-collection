1
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:24,701
-Keep the change.
-What are you waiting on?

2
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:29,875
-Four cappuccinos.
-Four cappuccinos. Let's go.

3
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,738
-There you go.
-Thanks.

4
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:12,481
-I've got a break.
-You can't smoke in here.

5
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,753
Hey, buddy, you forgot your change.

6
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:35,039
-Makes the world go round.
-What's that?

7
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:36,666
Gold.

8
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:39,307
Some people say love.

9
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:43,294
They're right too. It is Love.

10
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,926
Love of gold.

11
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:22,911
Hold on.

12
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:49,794
Thank God you're there.
There's been an explosion.

13
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:53,150
Pick up the phone and dial 911.

14
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm burnt.

15
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:42,788
"18. 36. 7. Pound."

16
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:12,469
What are you doing?

17
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:15,642
Find the security tape!

18
00:08:57,168 --> 00:08:58,931
Enough.

19
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,965
Hey, thanks.

20
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:54,088
Hey, how'd it go?

21
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,485
Finest kind.

22
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:59,614
-Where'd you get that?
-Here you go.

23
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:01,558
-You fixed it.
-I made a new one.

24
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:05,009
-You're a pretty smart fella.
-Not that smart.

25
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:09,630
-How'd you figure it out?
-I imagined someone smarter than me.

26
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:12,943
Then I tried to think,
"What would he do?"

27
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,615
-That's one hell of a boat.
-Sign up, I'll build you one.

28
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:21,889
-I wanna buy that one.
-Well, that's my boat.

29
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:25,729
Come up with a down payment,
and I'll have it in 18 months.

30
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,207
-We're good at this conversation.
-Then close the deal.

31
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:33,153
-There you go.
-What is it?

32
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:34,818
Open it up. It's yours.

33
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:38,503
It's shaped like an arrow.
Freccia means arrow.

34
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,368
-So you told me.
-It looks Like gold.

35
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,715
-That's because I gilded it.
-Why?

36
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,711
I wanted to sell you a boat.

37
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:52,508
Good try, though.
I want that boat.

38
00:10:55,753 --> 00:11:00,383
Sell me that boat, and I'll come
down with a laundry bag of cash.

39
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:04,988
Take the money, take your little girl,
cruise down to a tropic isle.

40
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,594
-How will you get the cash?
-Don't be coy.

41
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:11,954
You know who I am. Sell me your boat,
you'll be under my wing.

42
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:14,240
That's my private number.

43
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:20,146
I can't do it. I'm working on
your boat. Take mine out.

44
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:22,298
Does that girl go with it?

45
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:28,181
Call me, I'll have five guys here
Monday laying out the hull.

46
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:31,519
You decide to sell me your boat...

47
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:34,149
...let's do something, huh?

48
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,044
-I'd have liked to build him that boat.
-Walk away from it.

49
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:55,306
Well, Let’s start getting
the gear on board.

50
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,470
-You got the charts?
-Oh, yeah.

51
00:12:14,564 --> 00:12:15,792
Why so many?

52
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:20,664
Wouldn’t want somebody to look
at them and follow us.

53
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:25,433
-How'd I get so lucky?
-You're the law west of the Pecos.

54
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,278
Yeah, I used to be
the Law west of the Pecos.

55
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,674
Now I'm cashing out.

56
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:36,235
-You got your picture took.
-Is that why I'm cashing out?

57
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:39,013
If you say it, it's right.

58
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,952
You're the brass ring, babe.

59
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:45,755
Glad you Like me.

60
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:52,596
Off you go.

61
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:01,269
See you tonight.

62
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:07,075
Stay in the shadows.

63
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,599
Everyone's gonna be looking there.

64
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:13,531
-Where's the place to be?
-Place to be is in the sun.

65
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,187
Beautiful.

66
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,237
Just gorgeous.

67
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:31,405
Nobody gets the goods Like you.

68
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,957
Anybody can get the goods.
The hard part's getting away.

69
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:38,766
Plan a good getaway,
you can steal Ebbets Field.

70
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:42,977
-Ebbets Field is gone.
-What'd I tell you?

71
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,912
My nephew, Jimmy Silk.

72
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:57,531
Yep, that's who he is.

73
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,964
-He don't say hello?
-He must have things on his mind.

74
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:04,574
Anything you want while you're here?

75
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:07,968
Something for that pretty lady?

76
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:12,797
-What's she see in you anyway?
-I'm resilient.

77
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:17,128
-So's Gumby.
-I got a better profile.

78
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:21,437
You're gonna leave that
down south in Argentina.

79
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:25,215
-How you doing, Bobby?
-I think you're Looking at it.

80
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:28,134
You go down south, sit in the sun.

81
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:32,658
Pull down your bathing suit,
stick your ass out at the world.

82
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,498
You think the world’s ready for that?

83
00:14:37,756 --> 00:14:40,418
The other thing.
We got the go-ahead.

84
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:43,908
We got a firm date on the Swiss thing.

85
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:46,295
I'm burnt. They got my picture.

86
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:49,091
Of you in drag
with your war paint on.

87
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,205
It's a blessing.
It's time to check out.

88
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,020
What do we got?

89
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,834
-It's higher than the estimate.
-Half is yours.

90
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:10,799
We're on for the Swiss thing.

91
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:13,569
Why did he tell me that half is mine?

92
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:17,616
I know half of it's mine.
Me and my crew got it.

93
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:20,970
I went in hock
and set it up on your say-so.

94
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,507
Let's review. You let me
walk in there with my crew...

95
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:26,662
...and now you're stiffing me?

96
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:30,213
-If it was me--
-Yeah. I owe my crew.

97
00:15:30,265 --> 00:15:32,927
I gotta get out of town,
I gotta go.

98
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,816
-Should have shot the girl.
-Should have been there.

99
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:40,849
This Swiss thing. If I was
a publisher, I'd publish the plans.

100
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,822
Why don't you?

101
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:48,067
If I was a publisher. But I'm a thief
so I have to do that thing.

102
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:51,981
Give me our cut.
We'll do the Swiss job.

103
00:15:52,024 --> 00:15:55,460
You know that's bullshit.
You're going travelling.

104
00:15:55,511 --> 00:16:00,676
You gonna play me for a sucker?
I give you the money and you're gone.

105
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:03,131
The job's set up, you understand?

106
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:06,215
We did the job, my partners and me.

107
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:09,457
Hey, fuck you and fuck your partners.

108
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,496
I'm your partner. Without me
you've got, what? Little Lambsy Divy.

109
00:16:14,486 --> 00:16:20,083
-I bankroll this job on your say-so.
-I drove here, I didn't take the bus.

110
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:23,854
-Fuck you, go back to prison.
-What'd I tell you?

111
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,521
I don't think so.

112
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:29,615
-Guess again.
-You stay the fuck down.

113
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,524
Want to play Elk Corral?
Wanna dress up and play?

114
00:16:38,517 --> 00:16:41,008
Is that the thing?
Is that it?

115
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,710
Give me that fucking bag!

116
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,164
Your weight and your fate right here.

117
00:16:53,268 --> 00:16:57,170
Your weight and your fate right here.

118
00:16:57,491 --> 00:16:59,550
-Bag's empty, Bobby.
-What?

119
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,760
The bag is empty.

120
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:07,576
Put the bag down, it's empty.

121
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:12,631
Want me to pull up a chair
while you rape me?

122
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:16,022
If you'd pause in your
headstrong progress--

123
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:21,690
Joe, I'm in hock for all the toys.

124
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:26,740
All the toys you said go out
and buy. Two trucks, the plane.

125
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:29,468
-You said spend the money.
-What do you want?

126
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:31,784
I want you to do the other thing.

127
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:35,723
You screwed me.
Now my face is on a cereal box.

128
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,129
You got no money!
You're burnt and busted.

129
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:43,713
What the fuck does it take
to get you to do the other thing?

130
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:49,921
Excuse me, Mr. Bergman
asked you a question.

131
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:53,732
Excuse me,
my uncle asked you a question.

132
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:57,371
-Fuck your uncle.
-Fuck my uncle? You're the help.

133
00:17:58,288 --> 00:18:03,225
Yeah, I'm the help, motherfucker.
Why'd the chicken cross the road?

134
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,946
Because the road crossed the chicken.

135
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:08,796
-Walk away.
-Hey, you! Hold on!

136
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,507
Situation is pristine.

137
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,362
Cut him off.

138
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:24,340
I didn't see him.

139
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,493
Oh, my God!

140
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:30,572
How is he?

141
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:32,499
It's his road game.

142
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:55,518
-Your man does good work.
-That's why I use him.

143
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,183
Yeah, these will pass anywhere.

144
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,451
Why don't you take advantage of it?

145
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,269
No.

146
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:08,839
I need somebody to throw me
in the briar patch.

147
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:16,981
Yeah, give the gentleman a call.

148
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:31,604
-I need some walking-around money.
-That's reasonable.

149
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:35,425
And I'm gonna need my men's share
on the last job.

150
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,457
-Give it to me.
-Now?

151
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:40,013
You got it in your pocket.

152
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:42,769
You're ahead of me every turn.

153
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:44,726
Stunning.

154
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:49,524
The plan holds,
you get your shipment on the 14th.

155
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:53,573
The plan has changed.
We split it 50/50 on the site.

156
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,941
50/50.

157
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,141
So be it.

158
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:03,415
-Now what's your surprise?
-My boy comes with you on the job.

159
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:09,609
-He's got terrible manners.
-Which of us is perfect?

160
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,968
So be it.

161
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:23,462
Wait a sec. If it's about
your wife, why didn't you--?

162
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:27,391
Will you wait? If the whole thing
is about your wife--?

163
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,491
You know what?
The hell with it!

164
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,191
Not a happy camper, huh?

165
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm not a camper at all, stud.
Pour it.

166
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:41,709
See anything you Like?

167
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,656
I'm busy.

168
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:46,602
-Pour it!
-Hope you're not driving.

169
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:51,860
I hope I am, and I run into
some fucked abutment.

170
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:56,180
-Take me off, will you?
-That'll rot your stomach lining.

171
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:59,428
Yeah, but I get to drink it first.

172
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,290
-That's all I need.
-What?

173
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:10,914
There goes my job.
You see his badge?

174
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:16,858
Do you know where that guy is from?
And he caught me drinking on shift.

175
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:31,182
End of a perfect day.

176
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:43,249
-That's Betty Croft.
-What's her problem?

177
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:46,732
-She's a drunk.
-She's a drunk.

178
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:49,312
You bet she is.

179
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,341
-Why is she important?
-She gets us in the door.

180
00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:56,632
She gets us in the door, how?

181
00:21:56,738 --> 00:22:01,038
I want you to Leave the uniforms
on the porch 3 or 4 days.

182
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,549
Get the dry-cleaning smell
out of them.

183
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:06,311
When we do the switch, the highway--

184
00:22:09,442 --> 00:22:11,706
-Nobody can hear.
-If you don't say it.

185
00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:13,970
I'm as quiet as
an ant pissing on cotton.

186
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:16,845
I don't want you as quiet as that ant.

187
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:21,957
I want you as quiet as an ant not
even thinking about pissing on cotton.

188
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:52,767
Hello. I gotta report
a breakdown here.

189
00:23:52,827 --> 00:23:55,625
I got one of your rentals.
I need a tow truck.

190
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:58,870
Oh, come on, don't tell me that.

191
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:03,553
-Yeah, all right.
-What's the story on your pal?

192
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:06,070
He was born, he suffered, he died.

193
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,300
-Can he do the thing?
-He was doing it before you were born.

194
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:15,213
See, that's what troubles me.

195
00:24:15,258 --> 00:24:18,091
Maybe you want to pray about it?

196
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,038
-No, I'm not a religious man.
-That's a shame.

197
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:26,181
-How's the leg?
-Never better.

198
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:29,452
-How long has he been with that girl?
-Who?

199
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:33,295
-His wife.
-How long is a Chinaman's name?

200
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:38,438
How long is a Chinaman's name?
You ever notice that?

201
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,280
Got the uniforms?

202
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:46,613
Yeah, I got them.
I got them all aired out.

203
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:56,896
-Rental trucks?
-Yeah.

204
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,901
What do we got?

205
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:02,933
Gotta redo some of these figures.

206
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:06,926
-I gotta start from scratch.
-Worked out on the plan. Why now?

207
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:10,801
When things start to go sour,
someone's gonna be pissing.

208
00:25:10,838 --> 00:25:15,138
Looking to shoot somebody.
I want an alternate idea.

209
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,127
Why should it go sour?

210
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:21,271
-You timing the wrecker?
-Yeah.

211
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:26,065
Why should it go sour?
Was that such a stupid question?

212
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:31,597
You ever cheat on a woman? Something,
stand her up, step out on her?

213
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:32,905
What?

214
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:35,844
-Ever do that?
-Yeah.

215
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:38,792
-Did you have an excuse?
-Yeah.

216
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:43,397
What if she didn't ask?
Was your alibi a waste of time?

217
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,615
Is he gonna hold up?

218
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:56,438
He's only gotta hold it together
till the thing.

219
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:03,582
-Okay. All right.
-Is he backing up?

220
00:26:03,668 --> 00:26:05,101
Here he comes.

221
00:26:07,508 --> 00:26:09,567
Ain't that pretty.

222
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:17,309
Don't start the car.
It's just a routine stop.

223
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:19,993
Don't start the car.

224
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:23,962
Good morning.

225
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:27,743
-Can I see some identification?
-Good of you to come.

226
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,161
You were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

227
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:32,981
Just forget about this.

228
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:37,304
It's no big deal. But we're
out here without protection.

229
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,924
-Who'd you talk to?
-It burns my butt!

230
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:44,818
-I understand.
-We're out working for the city!

231
00:26:44,817 --> 00:26:48,253
-Who did you talk to?
-I know it's not your fault.

232
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:51,866
Who did you talk to?
Who did you talk to, sir?

233
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:58,899
-Keep it together.
-Can he cool the guy out?

234
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,794
-Pretend to write in your clipboard.
-Is he gonna be cool?

235
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:07,667
My motherfucker's so cool
when he goes to bed, sheep count him.

236
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,977
Appreciate that.
Why are you mad at him?

237
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,942
He's right. He's right.
Beg your pardon.

238
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:31,646
-Get off.
-Get in the car.

239
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,157
-Get back in the car.
-You know....

240
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:38,770
Give Pinky the piece.
Put your hands on the wheel.

241
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,700
And keep them there.
Just keep it right there.

242
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:45,999
We got it taken care of.
It's all right.

243
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,628
-Thanks so much.
-All right.

244
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:53,532
Chuck! You got a phone call
right here.

245
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:54,876
Excuse me.

246
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,717
It's Mr. Smith at the office.

247
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:02,797
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Thank you, officer.

248
00:28:02,893 --> 00:28:07,921
Well, it's one of those days.
Got it.

249
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,569
-You son of a bitch.
-Oh, that was real good.

250
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:24,855
You fucking lame! Leave me dead
and the crew on the road.

251
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,002
-I saw--
-You fucking cowboy!

252
00:28:27,116 --> 00:28:31,018
-Tell me why don't I kill him?
-How about we do?

253
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:33,781
I'll put you down
Like the dog you are.

254
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:37,359
-You gonna shoot your way to stardom?
-I only--

255
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:40,616
I don't want you
to do anything unless--

256
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:43,789
We hit the city, you burn the car.

257
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:45,908
-I'll take the--
-No, you do it!

258
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:51,340
Car's filthy. Whole fucking job's
in the car. You do it, Pinky!

259
00:28:56,362 --> 00:28:59,263
Get me the fuck out of here.

260
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:08,089
Listen, it's very simple.
It's several elements.

261
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,902
You got the tow truck.
You got the roadblock.

262
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:17,533
I can do it, okay? I know the job.
I got the job cold.

263
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,117
You can't cut me loose.

264
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,953
Please, guys. We got a deal here!

265
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:27,170
Why should we bet on you?
Young, dumb, full of cum.

266
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,700
Leave me bleeding on the side
of the road. "He's just impetuous."

267
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,589
Joe, security truck to the garage.
We beat the tow truck--

268
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:40,611
What's so fucking funny?
You got no job without me!

269
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:42,911
You got nothing without this job.

270
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:46,781
You want to go down south?
You want to go broke?

271
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:51,920
Without me, you got nothing.
You need the job. You need me!

272
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,368
-You can't take him.
-Okay, I got loose, but--

273
00:29:55,431 --> 00:29:58,229
You cannot take this lame
on the job, Joe!

274
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,205
Can we just go calm here
for a minute?

275
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:05,213
Go calm?
So, what happened to you now?

276
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:08,118
I'll tell you what happened to me.

277
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:11,860
I need a fucking minute
to make a decision.

278
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:16,291
-Fine.
-Joe, can I talk to you?

279
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:24,579
-What the hell is it?
-They found the car.

280
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:30,306
-What car?
-The station wagon. The cops found it.

281
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,779
How could they find it?
I told you to ditch the car.

282
00:30:35,396 --> 00:30:38,229
I stopped off to see my niece.

283
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:41,945
-Did you wipe it down?
-You saw your niece?

284
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:44,988
Did you wipe it down?

285
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,860
-I left my clipboard in the car.
-What does this do to the job?

286
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:53,852
-You left your clipboard?
-My leg was troubling me.

287
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,519
-The job is on the clipboard.
-What about the job?

288
00:30:57,571 --> 00:31:01,268
-The job's on the clipboard!
-Job stands.

289
00:31:01,315 --> 00:31:03,579
-Are you crazy?
-The job stands?

290
00:31:03,682 --> 00:31:07,914
-The job is bust. This place is burnt.
-What does this mean?

291
00:31:07,937 --> 00:31:10,167
Job stands.

292
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:14,938
You're out of your fucking mind.
We can't sink with the job!

293
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:19,538
Tell you what.
You want to run the show?

294
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:21,818
It's fun to play pretend.
Come on!

295
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,481
You're gonna roll over
for these guys?

296
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:28,843
-I gotta go away.
-You took this lame on the job.

297
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:31,774
Can't Leave with nothing.

298
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:35,465
You're drawing dead.
You want a fucking telegram?

299
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,091
The job is dead.

300
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,136
You put your man in the street,
you lamed up the job.

301
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:47,161
-Wait, wait, wait. Bobby!
-I can't sink with the job!

302
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:50,726
Wait a second. Wait a second!

303
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:55,435
Baby, you got old.

304
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,527
I'm gone, I'm out.
That's it.

305
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:04,931
I don't see how
they could have found the car.

306
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,288
Fuck the car, Pink!

307
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:10,883
You're a stupid Lame.
I'm out of here.

308
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:14,758
-I gotta get on with my life.
-Bobby, wait!

309
00:32:14,814 --> 00:32:17,612
-Fran, what are you doing?
-Place is burnt.

310
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:19,491
Hold it, hold it.

311
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:24,410
For Christ sake!
You gotta move your car.

312
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:27,207
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

313
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:30,091
What's going on?
What's the shot?

314
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,897
You got someplace to go? Some shade?

315
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,848
You best get to it.
And move your car. I gotta go.

316
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:41,545
Shit, where's my piece?

317
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,628
-I'll get it to you later.
-Now.

318
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,766
What am I telling you?
Just follow me!

319
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:51,611
Bobby, hold on! Just a minute!
For God's sake!

320
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:55,980
Walking away, Bobby?
You walking out on me?

321
00:32:55,996 --> 00:32:59,295
Are you walking out on me,
you weak son of a bitch?

322
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:01,220
Joe, I'm sorry.

323
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,331
Gonna get in your car?
After all this time!

324
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:06,877
What the hell?

325
00:33:07,515 --> 00:33:11,611
Come back here, you fucking coward!

326
00:33:11,643 --> 00:33:16,046
You're a fucking coward!
Go on, get the fuck out of here!

327
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,546
Little prick.

328
00:33:24,762 --> 00:33:28,493
-And there they go!
-That's right.

329
00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:31,063
You get gone too.

330
00:33:35,866 --> 00:33:40,200
-I would’ve loved to do the Swiss job.
-It's a good plan.

331
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:42,276
Never Liked the Swiss.
Their clocks...

332
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:45,884
...two guys come out with hammers
and hit each other.

333
00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:48,880
What kind of sick mentality is that?

334
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:51,250
You take care, pally.

335
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,495
Get Bobby's share to him.

336
00:33:56,664 --> 00:34:00,293
-What'll you do for cash?
-We're taking down the boat guy.

337
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:03,438
You're gonna take his cash?

338
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:06,207
-I'm selling him my boat.
-And then?

339
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:09,466
Then we'll take my boat back.

340
00:34:09,687 --> 00:34:14,317
-Well, baby, then aloha.
-See you Later, Pinky.

341
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:19,162
It's a shame we didn't get to do
the Swiss job. It's a beautiful plan.

342
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,889
-Cute.
-Cute as a pail of kittens.

343
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:26,545
-Say goodbye to your niece for me.
-You bet, pal.

344
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:48,350
You might want to put that out, sir.

345
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,836
-Put it out. Put the cigar out.
-I told him.

346
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:58,532
We got a fuel leak,
trying to put your cleat in.

347
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,571
-Your arrow cleat.
-Her idea.

348
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:05,528
-To put your stamp on it.
-Damned if I didn't cut the fuel line.

349
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:08,391
I wanted to take her out tonight.

350
00:35:08,468 --> 00:35:12,063
I know you did, sir,
and I'm sorry as hell.

351
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:17,883
I'm gonna work all night and
I'll have it ready for sunup, okay?

352
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:22,731
All right, I want to re-ballast her.

353
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:25,328
Put her a bit by the stern.

354
00:35:30,803 --> 00:35:36,708
I have the change of title, coast
guard certification and bill of sale.

355
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:39,218
Let me show you something pretty.

356
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:44,505
That's a lot of cash
to be carrying around.

357
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:48,998
-I brought a friend.
-Nice friend to have for a rainy day.

358
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:51,278
Yes, sir.

359
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:56,237
-I'm sorry about that Leak.
-Forget about it.

360
00:35:57,201 --> 00:36:00,295
We got forms, certifications....

361
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:01,494
Fran.

362
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:04,932
-Would you Like a cup of coffee?
-Yeah.

363
00:36:06,288 --> 00:36:09,883
I want you to do something for me.
Look at this.

364
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,437
I did this myself.
You're gonna Love it.

365
00:36:14,511 --> 00:36:17,309
This is what I want for a figurehead.

366
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:19,757
Robin Hood.
What do you think?

367
00:36:20,175 --> 00:36:23,770
I Like it because
it puts a twist on my name.

368
00:36:23,823 --> 00:36:27,884
Freccia is Italian for "arrow"
so you see the thing?

369
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,114
To personalize the boat.

370
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:35,319
Robin Hood, robbing from the rich,
but who wants to rob from the poor?

371
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:38,109
Let's see. Bill of sale.

372
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:41,058
We got certificate of title.

373
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:46,682
1400 hours on the engine.

374
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:51,537
My people will contact you.
Here's what we're thinking--

375
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:53,058
Easy!

376
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:19,709
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on!

377
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:00,400
Are you alone? Are you alone?

378
00:39:00,454 --> 00:39:02,251
Are you alone?

379
00:39:05,702 --> 00:39:11,231
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I Left my copy of the plans.

380
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:17,855
Hey, hold on.

381
00:39:18,853 --> 00:39:20,514
Call Freccia.

382
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:29,306
Call Freccia.

383
00:39:34,948 --> 00:39:38,247
You said the joint was burnt.
I don't understand.

384
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:40,037
-I didn't want--
-To what?

385
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:42,530
I'm Looking out for you two.

386
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:44,322
He won't answer.

387
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:48,683
What does she see in you?
You must be hung Like man-of-war.

388
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:58,305
You want to play the dozens?

389
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:00,534
Here we go.

390
00:40:00,675 --> 00:40:04,304
There was an error at the hospital.
You died at birth.

391
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:07,152
Cat got your tongue?
Don't you want to play?

392
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:09,725
Joe, Leave him.

393
00:40:21,217 --> 00:40:23,412
You going somewhere?

394
00:40:24,737 --> 00:40:28,002
What are you, the social service Lady?

395
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:37,904
-Going somewhere?
-Taking the baby back?

396
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:40,783
You can't run.
You gotta do the job.

397
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:44,232
You know that you got to.
You know you do.

398
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:48,952
Can you shoot me and walk away?
They'll hunt you down.

399
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,296
-Shoot him.
-I can't go down there with nothing!

400
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:57,933
Well...

401
00:40:58,047 --> 00:41:00,140
...that's the thing.

402
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:02,743
-What'll you do?
-Out!

403
00:41:03,135 --> 00:41:07,572
And what? You owe them money.
Think you can just sail away?

404
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:10,552
-They'll never Let you walk away.
-Get out!

405
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:38,124
What are we gonna do?

406
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,323
That's what everybody wants to know.

407
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,491
How do we get the gold home?

408
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:59,048
What's the difference?
They'll never trust you.

409
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,330
They need me to do the job.

410
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,701
How can they trust you
not to walk over?

411
00:42:04,763 --> 00:42:06,628
-The kid came back?
-Yeah.

412
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:11,310
-All right. Let's start again.
-Why'd the kid come back?

413
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:12,472
Listen.

414
00:42:12,635 --> 00:42:15,468
He don't come back,
you're on some island.

415
00:42:15,547 --> 00:42:19,210
-I got an idea.
-You should’ve Left him on the road.

416
00:42:19,258 --> 00:42:22,318
You shouldn’t have Left him
with the plans!

417
00:42:22,394 --> 00:42:24,294
What plans?

418
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,471
He forgot his cheat sheet.
That's why he came back.

419
00:42:33,689 --> 00:42:37,216
He didn't forget it,
because I got it right here!

420
00:42:37,274 --> 00:42:42,075
What, am I gonna Leave my papers
in the hands of some fucking Lame?

421
00:42:42,074 --> 00:42:45,202
-That's why he came back.
-He came for me.

422
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:47,089
What?

423
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:51,387
He came back to make sure I was okay.

424
00:42:52,248 --> 00:42:55,012
-He came back for you?
-That's right.

425
00:43:02,264 --> 00:43:04,732
I know how to get the gold.

426
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,392
-Suit up.
-Sure you want to do that?

427
00:43:08,632 --> 00:43:13,160
-She's the go-getter.
-Tell me what you want me to go get.

428
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:16,201
I need you to suit up.
Is that all right?

429
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:18,713
You say it, it's right.

430
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:21,108
All right.

431
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:25,281
-We'll put the job off for a month.
-For a month?

432
00:43:25,878 --> 00:43:31,544
I need dates for next month's shipment
and the name of a freight forwarder.

433
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,503
Freight forwarder
and a customs broker.

434
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:40,001
-Good.
-Where are you going with this?

435
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:44,070
You just listen.

436
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:47,733
We're gonna stand this thing
on its head.

437
00:43:50,357 --> 00:43:55,317
Are you fucking with me?
Or are you done fucking with me?

438
00:43:55,317 --> 00:44:00,721
I've financialized the problem, and
you're more trouble than you're worth.

439
00:44:00,756 --> 00:44:04,419
The girl says you'll do it.
You said that before.

440
00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:07,836
Why now?
What is it, all of a sudden?

441
00:44:09,044 --> 00:44:13,947
Everybody needs money.
That's why they call it "money."

442
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,931
Let me add this sweetener.

443
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:19,282
Do the fucking job,
or I'll turn you over.

444
00:44:19,347 --> 00:44:24,080
I'll drop a Roosevelt dime on you.
Finite la Commedia.

445
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,643
Is that strict, you fucking vonce?

446
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:30,197
Sorry to use such language
in front of a woman...

447
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:34,320
...were it not for who,
I'd waste your fucking ass.

448
00:44:34,354 --> 00:44:38,484
If you say you'll do the job, do it.
No more charades.

449
00:44:38,515 --> 00:44:42,178
Save the bold moves
for the brilliant players.

450
00:44:43,826 --> 00:44:46,351
-Sorry for the Language.
-How generous.

451
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,750
And fuck you too! Save the bullshit.
He wants the job.

452
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:52,999
Is that a question?

453
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:59,028
You came begging to me, doxy.
I didn't come to you.

454
00:44:59,025 --> 00:45:03,257
He'll do the job next month.
He needs a month.

455
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:08,218
-Is that the thing?
-Is that what I just told you?

456
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,220
-Ain't you a piece of work.
-I came from China in a matchbox.

457
00:45:15,952 --> 00:45:17,579
Thank you.

458
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:25,007
Fill up her drink,
she seems to enjoy it.

459
00:45:25,071 --> 00:45:26,436
What do you think?

460
00:45:26,576 --> 00:45:28,942
-He's scared.
-He's never scared.

461
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,565
-He's getting old.
-She said that?

462
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:36,760
He's broke, he's tired.
She says he wants to play ball.

463
00:45:36,751 --> 00:45:40,050
Why should we believe her?
Why did he send her?

464
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:43,638
-She came to me.
-To you?

465
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:47,735
-He put her up to it.
-She came to me on her own.

466
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:51,818
Yeah, but as rational men,
don't we have to doubt her?

467
00:45:51,854 --> 00:45:55,551
She thinks he's weak.
She's scared, she's sincere.

468
00:45:55,598 --> 00:45:58,158
Let me put a question to you:

469
00:45:58,254 --> 00:46:02,122
If you had the job,
how would you test her sincerity?

470
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:19,591
Okay, we're all on one team,
all arrayed against a common enemy?

471
00:46:19,565 --> 00:46:22,557
Thanks for coming.
I'm going to bed.

472
00:46:23,756 --> 00:46:26,247
-I'll see you back.
-I'm all right.

473
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:29,545
-You're all right now.
-Am I?

474
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:32,479
You just need somebody to lean on.

475
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,915
-Adrenaline gives you the shakes.
-I'm okay.

476
00:46:49,978 --> 00:46:53,641
I'm just saying,
adrenaline gives people the shakes.

477
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,057
Some mistake it for cowardice.
You could pray.

478
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,775
I'm not a religious man.

479
00:46:58,906 --> 00:47:02,342
-There's nothing wrong with prayer.
-Think so?

480
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:08,162
I knew this trooper who always
carried a Bible next to his heart.

481
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:11,253
-It stopped a bullet.
-No shit?

482
00:47:11,353 --> 00:47:16,120
Hand to God, it stopped a bullet.
Would’ve ruined his heart.

483
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:21,559
Had he had another Bible in front
of his face, he'd be alive today.

484
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,817
-What time you got?
-5:18.

485
00:47:26,905 --> 00:47:29,100
Make the call.

486
00:47:38,551 --> 00:47:44,387
Hello? I got one of your rental
trucks. The engine quit on me.

487
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:57,205
-Nobody lives forever.
-Frank Sinatra gave it a shot.

488
00:48:59,347 --> 00:49:01,281
You'll do.

489
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:32,140
Good morning.

490
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:42,213
It's the acid.

491
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:45,811
It isn't the acid, it's the asphalt.
It's making me sick.

492
00:49:45,872 --> 00:49:49,103
How can they work in that
all day long?

493
00:49:49,168 --> 00:49:51,898
-Got any Rolaids?
-Want an Alka Seltzer?

494
00:49:51,984 --> 00:49:55,420
-Doctor said not to drink.
-You shouldn’t then.

495
00:49:58,735 --> 00:50:03,195
Same old story everywhere you go.

496
00:50:03,215 --> 00:50:05,274
You know....

497
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:08,839
Oh, no.

498
00:50:09,646 --> 00:50:13,776
-Do I know you?
-No. Please, please.

499
00:50:13,806 --> 00:50:17,071
-What?
-Don't fire me. Please.

500
00:50:17,134 --> 00:50:20,103
-What do you mean?
-Don't fire me.

501
00:50:20,174 --> 00:50:23,610
I saw you in the bar.
You're with the FAA.

502
00:50:33,677 --> 00:50:38,546
Miss Croft, you're drinking
on the job. You're done.

503
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,477
I got two kids at home.
Please, mister.

504
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:45,266
Give me your keys.

505
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:49,669
Mister, I need a break.
I'm begging you.

506
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:55,683
I swear to you on my Life that
I will never take another drink.

507
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,890
Don't fire me.

508
00:50:57,995 --> 00:51:01,556
Did you ever ask anybody for a break?

509
00:51:01,612 --> 00:51:04,604
Do you have any kids?

510
00:51:05,004 --> 00:51:07,700
Oh, Christ.

511
00:51:07,819 --> 00:51:12,722
In about three minutes,
I'll be conducting a security check.

512
00:51:12,715 --> 00:51:17,152
I'll be passing through your station.
I will be, quote, armed.

513
00:51:17,163 --> 00:51:19,324
I will have a tool kit...

514
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:23,370
...in which is hidden
three dangerous items.

515
00:51:23,403 --> 00:51:26,804
It's a test of
the personnel under you.

516
00:51:26,858 --> 00:51:30,191
If you tip them off,
I'll have your job.

517
00:51:30,538 --> 00:51:32,301
I wouldn’t.

518
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:34,519
Go back to your station.

519
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:37,397
-I will.
-Give me your keys.

520
00:51:38,185 --> 00:51:40,380
Your alcohol.

521
00:51:41,193 --> 00:51:43,991
-You will go into the program.
-I will.

522
00:51:44,905 --> 00:51:46,964
Thank you!

523
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,923
That's it.

524
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:15,026
-Is Betty Croft here?
-Is what?

525
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:18,012
-Your supervisor.
-She went for coffee.

526
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:21,907
It's that time of day, isn't it?

527
00:52:26,662 --> 00:52:29,153
Can I Leave my tools
for a minute?

528
00:52:29,254 --> 00:52:31,085
That's no problem.

529
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:44,146
-What happened to Betty Croft?
-I think she's sick.

530
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:49,399
I don't feel so good myself.
Give me one of these, will you?

531
00:52:49,413 --> 00:52:53,110
And a large coffee.
Leave some room for milk.

532
00:52:59,812 --> 00:53:01,643
Here you go.

533
00:53:07,972 --> 00:53:09,599
Hold, hold, hold.

534
00:53:13,444 --> 00:53:17,244
-Here's your change.
-Thank you.

535
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,769
What's happening?

536
00:53:35,907 --> 00:53:39,502
What's happening is stay put.
Put her in park.

537
00:53:39,555 --> 00:53:42,353
Don't flash your brake lights.

538
00:53:50,945 --> 00:53:53,914
-There we go.
-Going to see the elephant.

539
00:54:21,056 --> 00:54:25,755
-Up early or up late?
-Not at all, until I get this in me.

540
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:31,751
What's with that--?
What's with your supervisor?

541
00:54:31,743 --> 00:54:36,009
-What, does she owe you money?
-I wish she did.

542
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:40,798
She's got some stomach thing.
Least Little thing sets her off.

543
00:54:42,014 --> 00:54:46,917
I had an aunt Like that once.
She wasn't really my aunt.

544
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:49,277
We just called her that.

545
00:54:49,598 --> 00:54:53,694
She had a florist shop.
Funny thing was, she was allergic.

546
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:57,011
We used to tease her about that.

547
00:54:58,078 --> 00:55:00,979
You know how cruel kids can be.

548
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:04,956
-On the floor.
-With that Little thing?

549
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:08,252
-Don't. Sit on the floor.
-Doing it.

550
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,189
Give me the case!
Open it up!

551
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,663
You okay?

552
00:55:31,323 --> 00:55:33,154
What happened?

553
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:35,767
Clean up this mess.

554
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:05,692
-What happened?
-The broad went bust on me.

555
00:56:05,754 --> 00:56:09,190
-What do you mean, she went bust?
-Just drive.

556
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:21,435
Hinton Tower. Confirm
A.T.C. clearance to Philadelphia.

557
00:56:21,433 --> 00:56:25,631
Proceed. Hold for release.
Contact Control upon departing.

558
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,354
There you go. Hotel Bravo 704.

559
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:53,908
Come on.

560
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,396
What the hell?

561
00:57:49,107 --> 00:57:52,042
Hinton Tower, what the hell was that?

562
00:57:52,116 --> 00:57:56,849
-Anyone on final?
-We have TransAir 249, base.

563
00:57:56,851 --> 00:58:00,878
-Divert!
-TransAir 249, go around.

564
00:58:09,874 --> 00:58:15,369
PanGeneve, proceed to runway Alpha
India. Contact Providence Control.

565
00:58:15,378 --> 00:58:19,246
This is PanGeneve 242,
we are now taking the active.

566
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:21,648
-He's not stopping.
-Cut him off.

567
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:24,578
-It's not that easy.
-Cut him the fuck off!

568
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:25,464
PanGeneve?

569
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:27,509
Can you hear me?

570
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:34,736
We have reports of
a possible explosive device on board.

571
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:37,773
We want you to cut your engines.

572
00:59:38,637 --> 00:59:42,437
We got a man who's coming on board
to advise you.

573
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:48,470
Cut your engines, kill all your power,
your electronics and the radio.

574
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:50,829
Stay off the radio.

575
00:59:54,285 --> 00:59:56,617
-What is it?
-Shut off the engine.

576
00:59:56,684 --> 00:59:59,118
Kill your radar, keep your A.P.U. on.

577
00:59:59,212 --> 01:00:02,113
There may be an explosive device
on board.

578
01:00:02,252 --> 01:00:04,413
Stay seated while I make a sweep.

579
01:00:04,524 --> 01:00:07,425
Be in touch with my man on the ground.

580
01:00:09,196 --> 01:00:14,133
-How serious is this threat?
-Just be in touch with my man.

581
01:00:14,283 --> 01:00:17,514
Don't talk to the tower, talk to me.

582
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:19,945
Yeah.

583
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:23,628
Cut the radio and electronics.
Can you hear me?

584
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:27,388
Don't talk to the tower.
I'm linked to the tower.

585
01:02:21,508 --> 01:02:25,604
Beech 270 remains
18 miles from the outer marker.

586
01:02:25,635 --> 01:02:29,366
Adjust to 612 your GCA. Good day.

587
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:33,288
Hold on. Hold it. I show PanGeneve
outbound to 1205 Zulu.

588
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:36,240
Providence Control wants to know
where is he?

589
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,186
PanGeneve 262, who's got him?

590
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,858
I got him right there,
visual on the runway.

591
01:03:42,911 --> 01:03:45,436
PanGeneve, he's right there.

592
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:51,371
Break, Manchester Control.
I have an inbound Lear, 5-2 Papa.

593
01:03:51,326 --> 01:03:55,126
Can you take him? Squawk, 1795 direct.

594
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:59,728
Manchester, I got him.
Clear 5-2 Papa.

595
01:04:57,787 --> 01:04:59,414
Bobby?

596
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:01,378
Keep your eyes on the road.

597
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:03,697
You got change for a 20?

598
01:05:06,554 --> 01:05:08,351
All right.

599
01:05:10,714 --> 01:05:13,148
How you Like me now, babe?

600
01:05:14,714 --> 01:05:16,545
All right.

601
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:26,766
Do not transfer me!

602
01:05:26,905 --> 01:05:30,966
Do not transfer me! You're
the fourth person I've talked to!

603
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,365
-Enough!
-Come on!

604
01:05:32,504 --> 01:05:37,407
Engine failure! I called first
at 5:20 this morning.

605
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:39,460
This is my fourth call!

606
01:05:39,576 --> 01:05:41,635
Keep coming. Whoa!

607
01:05:41,752 --> 01:05:43,242
Good.

608
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:48,411
-How Long before the tow truck?
-I called at 5:20 in the morning.

609
01:05:48,408 --> 01:05:51,502
-Let's go!
-Yes. Outside the airport.

610
01:05:51,575 --> 01:05:54,373
Industrial and 207.

611
01:05:54,455 --> 01:05:58,687
I'm an attorney! Can I have your name?
I'm gonna have your job!

612
01:06:00,343 --> 01:06:02,368
-The truck's almost here.
-Good.

613
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:04,421
You score?

614
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:07,739
-Look at that.
-Oh, my, oh, my.

615
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:11,425
Go sell chocolate,
you Heidi motherfuckers.

616
01:06:11,478 --> 01:06:13,002
We got your gold!

617
01:06:13,142 --> 01:06:15,235
Hey, Let me have that. Yeah!

618
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:19,912
Two minutes before the setup's over!
Tow truck will be here. Let's go!

619
01:06:19,926 --> 01:06:24,761
-When that cop comes to....
-That's gotta be what it's gonna be.

620
01:06:24,757 --> 01:06:29,194
-Can you get through a roadblock?
-Whatever. It's all of a piece.

621
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:33,389
You're burnt.

622
01:06:33,493 --> 01:06:35,552
You're burnt!

623
01:06:35,669 --> 01:06:37,364
We're all going together.

624
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,724
I do not see the percentage.

625
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:44,225
You don't have to, baby.

626
01:06:44,276 --> 01:06:47,837
You're burnt. You're fucking burnt,
old man!

627
01:06:47,892 --> 01:06:50,258
-I go with the gold.
-With the gold?

628
01:06:50,324 --> 01:06:52,451
What are you telling your beads?

629
01:06:52,564 --> 01:06:54,293
Look, man, you tell me.

630
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,651
What are they going
to Look harder at? Tell me!

631
01:06:57,716 --> 01:07:01,846
You, here with us,
or you in an empty car?

632
01:07:03,284 --> 01:07:07,380
You tell me. You follow us
through the roadblock.

633
01:07:07,411 --> 01:07:08,901
Joe, you're burned.

634
01:07:09,043 --> 01:07:13,980
When that cop comes through,
they'll put him at the roadblock.

635
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:16,302
It's the wise thing.

636
01:07:17,362 --> 01:07:20,854
You go in the van with the gold.
It'll be all right.

637
01:07:20,914 --> 01:07:22,745
-I'll meet you.
-Okay.

638
01:07:22,866 --> 01:07:25,528
-Let's go, guys. Come on!
-Let's move!

639
01:07:25,618 --> 01:07:27,643
Wrap it up! Let's go!

640
01:07:27,762 --> 01:07:30,230
Bobby. There you go, pal.

641
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:34,183
Come on, Let’s go!

642
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:38,269
You heard what the man said.
Let's go! Move!

643
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:43,500
-You gotta move. Get in the car. Go!
-Okay.

644
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,262
Joe! I'll see you at the meet.

645
01:07:48,337 --> 01:07:50,134
See you at the meet!

646
01:07:56,112 --> 01:07:58,603
-Joe!
-What?

647
01:07:58,704 --> 01:08:01,673
Come on, keep it together, boy!

648
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,769
It's not over yet!

649
01:08:04,335 --> 01:08:06,565
Let's go. Fran!

650
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:09,299
-Keys.
-See you at the meet.

651
01:08:09,391 --> 01:08:11,154
Hey, Joe, Listen.

652
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:15,010
-It's the smart thing. It is.
-Yeah, all right.

653
01:08:15,055 --> 01:08:16,181
-My God!
-What?

654
01:08:16,335 --> 01:08:18,826
She missed the fucking tow truck.

655
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:03,644
He'll meet us there.

656
01:09:13,451 --> 01:09:15,646
-Don't smoke.
-Makes me Look calm.

657
01:09:15,756 --> 01:09:18,623
What kind of people try to Look calm?

658
01:09:19,563 --> 01:09:25,524
Get away from the van! Put your hands
on your head and walk towards me.

659
01:09:25,483 --> 01:09:28,748
You, the man. Kneel on the grass!
Come on!

660
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:30,835
-Lady, stop there!
-Kneel!

661
01:09:30,922 --> 01:09:33,447
-Open the van. Open it!
-It's unlocked.

662
01:09:33,547 --> 01:09:36,482
Don't Look at me, Look at the grass!

663
01:09:41,066 --> 01:09:42,658
-What's that?
-An engine.

664
01:09:42,793 --> 01:09:46,058
-For what?
-A fucking tractor. I don't know.

665
01:09:49,417 --> 01:09:51,180
Okay.

666
01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:54,107
-How Long have you been here?
-What's wrong?

667
01:09:54,185 --> 01:09:55,379
How Long?

668
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:59,329
Since 4:00 a.m.,
waiting for the fucking tow truck.

669
01:10:00,361 --> 01:10:03,922
-What's the problem?
-There was a robbery.

670
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:22,903
Come on, Let’s go!

671
01:11:23,396 --> 01:11:27,059
Move the truck through! Come on!

672
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:52,452
You were good with the cops.

673
01:11:52,546 --> 01:11:55,674
Oh, yeah,
I'm the Long lost motherfucker.

674
01:11:55,746 --> 01:11:58,647
You think good on your feet.

675
01:11:58,722 --> 01:12:03,489
-You think good off your feet too.
-Well, aren't you sweet.

676
01:12:03,682 --> 01:12:08,676
-What do you say we stop for a drink?
-Let's get to the meet.

677
01:12:08,673 --> 01:12:12,871
Yeah, that's difficult.
Want me to tell you why?

678
01:12:12,898 --> 01:12:15,162
There is no meet.

679
01:12:19,872 --> 01:12:22,500
-Joe wouldn’t Like that.
-We Left Joe.

680
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:24,925
There is no meet, you know that.

681
01:12:25,024 --> 01:12:28,289
Your guy got his picture
on a stamp. He got old.

682
01:12:28,353 --> 01:12:32,790
Let's cut the jiving.
What kind of man sends his wife to me?

683
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:38,329
To distract me? Surprise! I was taken
in. How about that? What a fool I am.

684
01:12:38,304 --> 01:12:39,999
Would I do that to you?

685
01:12:40,128 --> 01:12:42,358
Would I do that to you?

686
01:12:42,463 --> 01:12:43,794
And who Liked it?

687
01:12:43,935 --> 01:12:49,396
For old-time's sake, why don't we
cut the nonsense and say what it is?

688
01:12:52,031 --> 01:12:53,658
I need a drink.

689
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:56,851
Did he think he was going home
with the gold?

690
01:12:56,895 --> 01:13:01,559
Only one who didn't know was him.
He needed someone to draw it for him.

691
01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:05,627
And you went with it, all the way.
Was you joking?

692
01:13:05,726 --> 01:13:10,288
Answer me, because I'll tell you
what we could do with that gold.

693
01:13:30,972 --> 01:13:32,963
Where are you going?

694
01:13:33,852 --> 01:13:36,446
-Are you okay?
-Where are you going?

695
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,838
I'm gonna check on the gold.

696
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,771
Leave it!

697
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:42,811
Walk away from it!

698
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:45,431
-Leave it!
-Walk away?

699
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,983
What are you, crazy?

700
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:51,618
The truck's clean, for Christ sake.

701
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:55,602
Think I'm gonna walk away
from this--?

702
01:15:32,662 --> 01:15:34,630
How you doing?

703
01:15:34,741 --> 01:15:37,301
Hey, you know.

704
01:15:37,397 --> 01:15:39,661
Yeah, here you go.

705
01:15:39,893 --> 01:15:41,622
What is it?

706
01:15:42,324 --> 01:15:44,656
What the hell do you care?

707
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,239
Well, that's true too.

708
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:00,748
-Hell of a thing!
-It's a hell of a thing!

709
01:16:00,788 --> 01:16:04,952
My shipment was supposed to be
in Philly by 9 yesterday.

710
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:07,380
-Right.
-Called me back from vacation!

711
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:12,243
They said, "Your load is still
on the ground. It never Left Boston."

712
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:15,598
-We had a robbery.
-No kidding!

713
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:20,262
-You had a robbery? Anybody hurt?
-Couple pilots shaken up a Little.

714
01:16:20,274 --> 01:16:23,766
You had a robbery,
and you impound the plane?

715
01:16:24,786 --> 01:16:29,519
-What did they take?
-Some Load from Switzerland.

716
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:42,372
-Didn't they offer the next flight?
-What?

717
01:16:42,449 --> 01:16:45,418
Didn't they offer
their next flight to Philly?

718
01:16:45,457 --> 01:16:47,084
Oh, yeah.

719
01:16:47,217 --> 01:16:50,744
Their next flight is 8 a.m. tomorrow.

720
01:16:50,769 --> 01:16:55,035
It has to be in Philly yesterday.
I gotta drive it there myself.

721
01:16:55,057 --> 01:16:59,585
If I don't have that Load in Philly
by dawn, there's my job!

722
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,191
Here it is.

723
01:17:06,096 --> 01:17:08,189
Hell of a thing.

724
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:11,005
Hell of a thing.

725
01:17:39,694 --> 01:17:42,857
-Come to dinner tonight.
-We'll have to see.

726
01:17:43,502 --> 01:17:46,300
You always say that.
It means you won't.

727
01:17:46,382 --> 01:17:48,282
Well, it's possible.

728
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:51,298
It's possible that my business....

729
01:17:51,373 --> 01:17:55,571
-I might have to travel.
-Why can't you do business here?

730
01:17:55,597 --> 01:17:58,964
I wish I could, baby. The fact is...

731
01:17:59,021 --> 01:18:01,148
...I have to Leave this morning.

732
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,128
-This morning?
-That's when my plane leaves.

733
01:18:08,236 --> 01:18:09,567
Times change.

734
01:18:09,708 --> 01:18:13,235
In my day, kids had to walk
all the way to school.

735
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:17,854
-Yes, but the streets were safer.
-Is that so?

736
01:18:18,955 --> 01:18:23,289
-You take care of yourself, kid.
-Bye, Uncle Donny.

737
01:18:30,155 --> 01:18:32,680
-Nice day for the race.
-What race?

738
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:37,079
The human race. Kids growing up,
so on. Hope of the future.

739
01:18:37,099 --> 01:18:39,499
Get in the fucking car.

740
01:21:06,754 --> 01:21:10,155
-Where's the gold?
-I'm reluctant to tell you.

741
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:15,443
When we put it to you, you'll tell us
the gross national product of Bolivia!

742
01:21:15,425 --> 01:21:18,019
You'll tell us
the area code of Belgium!

743
01:21:18,113 --> 01:21:19,341
It's all I know.

744
01:21:19,489 --> 01:21:21,855
This is all you know.

745
01:21:21,953 --> 01:21:26,754
This is all you know! And we got you
going to Saint Croix!

746
01:21:26,753 --> 01:21:31,247
How do you pick up your share?
Where's the gold? Where's the meet?

747
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:33,825
What are you gonna do, hurt me?

748
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,912
Well, no. Actually, no.

749
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,169
I'm not gonna hurt you.

750
01:21:39,264 --> 01:21:42,199
But tell a guy.
I'm full of admiration.

751
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:45,332
What was the deal?

752
01:21:45,408 --> 01:21:49,401
The deal was, we get away
with the gold. Cute, huh?

753
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:51,430
That's charming. Then what?

754
01:21:52,191 --> 01:21:55,024
-We slip away.
-You slip away?

755
01:21:55,103 --> 01:21:59,164
And we go to the meet, and we
find pig iron? Is that it?

756
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,896
Joe figured you weren't
never going to the meet.

757
01:22:02,943 --> 01:22:04,774
He did?

758
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:08,486
If your guy doesn't get it
in his head to fly off...

759
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:12,569
...we're all on the patio right now,
having a margarita!

760
01:22:12,798 --> 01:22:15,198
Where's the gold?

761
01:22:15,293 --> 01:22:18,285
You understand my reluctance
to tell you.

762
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:22,395
Take him out and show him something.

763
01:22:24,637 --> 01:22:26,662
Don't hurt him.

764
01:22:31,356 --> 01:22:34,086
You got anything to say about this?

765
01:22:47,036 --> 01:22:50,096
Fran? Has she called in?

766
01:22:50,172 --> 01:22:53,141
She won't call
until she ditches the guy.

767
01:22:53,212 --> 01:22:55,612
How is she gonna ditch him?

768
01:22:55,996 --> 01:22:58,965
She could talk her way
out of a sunburn.

769
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:02,561
That's right.

770
01:23:14,362 --> 01:23:15,351
Yeah?

771
01:23:15,514 --> 01:23:17,004
Joe.

772
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:19,740
Yeah, how you doing?

773
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:22,506
Just checking in.

774
01:23:23,193 --> 01:23:26,287
Fine, finest. Pristine.

775
01:23:27,353 --> 01:23:29,014
Yeah, I know.

776
01:23:29,498 --> 01:23:32,262
I saw the truck drive through too.

777
01:23:32,345 --> 01:23:34,006
Isn't it?

778
01:23:34,137 --> 01:23:37,163
-See you at the meet.
-Okay.

779
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:52,026
Mr. Bergman, please.

780
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,945
Hold on.

781
01:23:58,776 --> 01:24:00,971
So where's the gold?

782
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:06,842
You're shitting me.

783
01:24:18,582 --> 01:24:20,106
Is that all right?

784
01:24:20,246 --> 01:24:22,043
Okay.

785
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:26,813
Okay.

786
01:25:35,186 --> 01:25:36,915
How you doing?

787
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:39,306
We're all packed up.

788
01:25:39,986 --> 01:25:41,817
How'd you ditch that guy?

789
01:25:43,186 --> 01:25:46,155
-Leave him at the altar?
-Yeah, at the altar.

790
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:48,159
That's my girl.

791
01:25:50,193 --> 01:25:52,252
What happened to you?

792
01:25:52,369 --> 01:25:54,166
Yeah, yeah.

793
01:25:54,289 --> 01:25:58,589
There was a change in plans,
you couldn’t call to tell me?

794
01:25:59,505 --> 01:26:02,269
-Get him off the boat.
-Off the boat!

795
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:04,989
Get off the boat!

796
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:08,440
Yeah, that's right.

797
01:26:09,392 --> 01:26:11,587
Where's your friend?

798
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,582
Where's your friend?

799
01:26:14,704 --> 01:26:16,069
You all alone?

800
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:20,235
No. You ain't alone.
It ain't good to be alone.

801
01:26:20,272 --> 01:26:21,261
Dump it.

802
01:26:21,424 --> 01:26:22,857
Go find his friend.

803
01:26:22,992 --> 01:26:26,359
-I didn't have a choice.
-Let my wife go!

804
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:29,907
Mind if I say something personal?
Your wife's a whore.

805
01:26:29,967 --> 01:26:32,834
You two fucked this plan
into a cocked hat.

806
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:36,311
-After all we went through together!
-Fuck you!

807
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:38,927
-I was gonna make you rich.
-Is that so?

808
01:26:39,022 --> 01:26:42,389
I was gonna make you rich,
you motherfucker.

809
01:26:42,446 --> 01:26:45,142
But you had to complicate
the last bit.

810
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:46,424
You piece of shit!

811
01:26:46,574 --> 01:26:48,872
Yeah? Who's kneeling on the dock?

812
01:26:49,133 --> 01:26:51,465
-He ain't there.
-All right.

813
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:54,468
Okay. You want to wrap it up?

814
01:26:54,893 --> 01:26:57,760
Want to stand around
and guess my real name?

815
01:26:57,837 --> 01:27:00,397
-What is your name?
-Rumpelstiltskin!

816
01:27:00,525 --> 01:27:03,460
-What was it before?
-Watch your mouth!

817
01:27:03,533 --> 01:27:06,366
-Leave him the fuck alone!
-Get back!

818
01:27:06,445 --> 01:27:08,345
Get her out of here!

819
01:27:09,677 --> 01:27:14,046
You had to go out on a limb,
didn't you?

820
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:17,928
-Didn't you?
-Let her go. I'll give up the gold.

821
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:21,458
Yeah, basically, we had in mind
a different deal.

822
01:27:21,516 --> 01:27:24,815
I hear if you're flexible,
it keeps you young.

823
01:27:24,876 --> 01:27:28,937
I'll give up the gold.
Me and the girl Leave on the boat.

824
01:27:28,972 --> 01:27:33,568
-What if the gold’s on the boat?
-I gave up the gold. I had to.

825
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:36,505
-You what?
-I had to!

826
01:27:37,163 --> 01:27:41,395
I hate to break your rice bowl,
but your wife made a deal.

827
01:27:41,418 --> 01:27:45,377
We get the gold, we Let you live.
What do you think?

828
01:27:45,418 --> 01:27:47,545
-Let me walk away?
-That's right.

829
01:27:47,658 --> 01:27:50,058
-Me and the girl?
-Well, not quite.

830
01:27:50,155 --> 01:27:51,747
I'm sorry, baby.

831
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:56,080
Let's get this boat out of here!
She's got a commercial mind.

832
01:27:56,106 --> 01:28:00,338
-Hold on a second here!
-You're bust, pal. You're bust.

833
01:28:00,586 --> 01:28:04,682
-You got broke. Go cry a Little.
-You fortunate fucker.

834
01:28:04,681 --> 01:28:08,276
She don't step up, you stay here
Like a bit of forever.

835
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:10,229
This way, you walk away.

836
01:28:10,345 --> 01:28:13,371
Take the gold! Just Leave me the boat!

837
01:28:13,448 --> 01:28:17,908
Don't make me lose my respect for you.
Get the gold off.

838
01:28:18,345 --> 01:28:21,678
Give him some money!
Leave him some money!

839
01:28:21,736 --> 01:28:25,297
Don't Let him go down there
with nothing.

840
01:28:25,864 --> 01:28:27,456
Give him some money!

841
01:28:27,592 --> 01:28:29,492
Yeah, that's right.

842
01:28:29,608 --> 01:28:33,374
We don't want to send you out broke.
Give me a shiv.

843
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:36,084
Yeah.

844
01:28:38,983 --> 01:28:41,383
Buy yourself something nice.

845
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:43,106
Pay you with gold.

846
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:44,570
How you doing?

847
01:28:44,711 --> 01:28:46,872
You holding up?

848
01:28:47,046 --> 01:28:50,812
-The broad sold me out.
-How about that?

849
01:28:50,823 --> 01:28:52,882
Show them a pretty face...

850
01:28:53,191 --> 01:28:57,594
...a diamond necklace, and
they're gone Like morning mist.

851
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:18,834
Find it!

852
01:29:21,061 --> 01:29:22,221
Where's the gold?

853
01:29:29,221 --> 01:29:31,086
Hurt him a Little.

854
01:29:37,188 --> 01:29:40,248
-Get him up.
-You son of a bitch!

855
01:29:41,475 --> 01:29:45,138
-You're just too hip to be happy.
-Is that so?

856
01:29:45,188 --> 01:29:47,554
You had to go and hit me.

857
01:29:48,324 --> 01:29:49,814
You all done?

858
01:29:49,955 --> 01:29:53,220
Because I got bills to pay.
Where's the gold?

859
01:29:53,283 --> 01:29:55,547
-Give me a cigarette.
-Bad for you.

860
01:29:55,651 --> 01:29:57,983
Well, nobody Lives forever.

861
01:29:58,082 --> 01:30:01,483
But you're spending
the rest of your Life with me.

862
01:30:01,538 --> 01:30:03,130
Right now!

863
01:30:03,267 --> 01:30:06,794
-Where's the fucking gold?
-Kiss my Yankee ass!

864
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:09,287
Okay.

865
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:14,040
I hate to do anything as dramatic
as count to three. But one...

866
01:30:16,481 --> 01:30:17,880
...two....

867
01:30:18,018 --> 01:30:19,315
Hey!

868
01:30:20,321 --> 01:30:21,310
Damn it!

869
01:30:22,434 --> 01:30:23,628
What the fuck?

870
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:28,251
Bobby! Bobby!

871
01:30:28,353 --> 01:30:32,016
-Coming at you!
-No shooting! Fuck!

872
01:30:32,065 --> 01:30:34,499
Stop! Put the fucking guns down!

873
01:30:34,593 --> 01:30:36,686
Are you listening to me? No!

874
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,429
Stop! We're talking! Let's just talk!

875
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,777
Stop! Just--

876
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:44,383
Fuck, no!

877
01:30:47,488 --> 01:30:49,854
-Bobby!
-Come on, sit down!

878
01:30:49,952 --> 01:30:51,715
Sit down! No guns! No!

879
01:31:26,109 --> 01:31:28,043
I'm ready.

880
01:31:34,365 --> 01:31:36,265
Let's get the fuck out of here.

881
01:31:42,749 --> 01:31:44,842
How about that?

882
01:31:46,172 --> 01:31:48,640
How about that?

883
01:31:48,892 --> 01:31:50,883
How about that?

884
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,942
Don't you want to hear my Last words?

885
01:32:03,035 --> 01:32:04,195
I just did.

886
01:32:59,512 --> 01:33:03,676
You put milk in, it lessens
the chance of stomach distress.

887
01:33:03,704 --> 01:33:07,162
I can't be worrying about
every Little thing.

888
01:33:07,224 --> 01:33:10,421
-How are you mending?
-Doing my best here.

889
01:33:10,487 --> 01:33:12,182
You?

890
01:33:14,616 --> 01:33:16,607
It's too bad about Pinky.

891
01:33:16,727 --> 01:33:17,751
What?

892
01:33:17,911 --> 01:33:22,245
-Pinky. Shame.
-Ain't that so?

893
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:24,711
He always made me laugh.

894
01:33:24,823 --> 01:33:28,452
-What more can you ask of anyone?
-Nothing.

895
01:33:31,574 --> 01:33:35,442
You go to that plastic surgeon,
don't Let him put you under.

896
01:33:36,597 --> 01:33:39,691
I knew a cat,
went to get his face fixed.

897
01:33:39,766 --> 01:33:42,997
Woke up, and the sucker
gave him a pair of tits.

898
01:33:43,062 --> 01:33:44,962
That's a bad beat.

899
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:49,037
He landed back inside
and never wanted for cigarettes.

900
01:34:03,956 --> 01:34:05,719
Send your cut there?

901
01:34:06,324 --> 01:34:09,657
Wire it there.
When you get where you're going.

902
01:34:10,004 --> 01:34:11,801
That I will, pal.

903
01:34:11,924 --> 01:34:14,893
I hear it's nice down there
in the sun.

904
01:34:14,964 --> 01:34:17,194
Is that where I'm going?

905
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:19,268
Wherever it is, brother...

906
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,314
...don't come back.

907
01:34:29,042 --> 01:34:30,600
There.

908
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:40,813
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

909
01:34:40,946 --> 01:34:43,744
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. Who was that?

910
01:34:43,826 --> 01:34:47,091
Some guy, wanted a tip on a fight.

911
01:34:47,218 --> 01:34:48,412
Did you?

912
01:34:48,818 --> 01:34:54,450
I worked my whole Life. Why give him
the benefit of all that knowledge?

913
01:34:54,546 --> 01:34:55,808
Drive.

914
01:35:30,863 --> 01:35:33,832
Nothing Like a good plan, Joe.

915
01:35:34,991 --> 01:35:39,121
Yeah, I wouldn’t tie my shoes
without a backup plan.

916
01:35:40,686 --> 01:35:42,620
Shame about Pinky.

917
01:35:42,735 --> 01:35:45,761
It went bad, that Last bit, didn't it?

918
01:35:45,838 --> 01:35:49,774
-Yes, it did.
-Then that's just the price.

919
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:52,090
That's right.

920
01:35:53,294 --> 01:35:55,421
That's part of it.

921
01:35:56,878 --> 01:35:59,438
-Didn't you do great, though?
-Did I?

922
01:35:59,533 --> 01:36:04,334
-You hot walked that dude all day.
-I went to a good school.

923
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:07,461
-What's the rest of it?
-I don't get you.

924
01:36:07,533 --> 01:36:10,400
-We were talking about Pinky.
-Yeah?

925
01:36:11,309 --> 01:36:16,303
I said, "That's just the price,"
and you said, "That's part of it."

926
01:36:16,876 --> 01:36:18,673
What's the rest of it?

927
01:36:20,652 --> 01:36:22,347
Let me see your hands.

928
01:36:22,476 --> 01:36:25,104
That's right, real still.

929
01:36:26,284 --> 01:36:27,478
Yeah, well....

930
01:36:28,012 --> 01:36:30,105
Get over there.

931
01:36:33,643 --> 01:36:35,304
Keep walking.

932
01:36:35,436 --> 01:36:39,338
Well, you sent me to him.
You shouldn’t have sent me to him.

933
01:36:39,371 --> 01:36:43,330
-You can't think of everything.
-Where's the gold?

934
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:45,202
It's right there.

935
01:36:45,323 --> 01:36:47,257
Why doesn't he shoot me?

936
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:48,838
That's the deal.

937
01:36:48,971 --> 01:36:51,235
-He isn't gonna shoot me?
-No.

938
01:36:51,339 --> 01:36:54,206
Then he shouldn’t point a gun at me.

939
01:36:54,858 --> 01:36:57,053
It's insincere.

940
01:36:57,323 --> 01:36:59,291
Let's go.

941
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:02,579
How you doing?

942
01:37:03,402 --> 01:37:04,630
Tired.

943
01:37:09,417 --> 01:37:12,250
-You'll be all right.
-You think so?

944
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:14,457
You always are.

945
01:37:14,697 --> 01:37:16,528
Cute plan, though.

946
01:37:16,649 --> 01:37:19,379
Cute as a Chinese baby.
