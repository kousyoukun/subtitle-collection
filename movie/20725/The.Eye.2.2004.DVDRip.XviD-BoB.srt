1
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,796
Green is the most 
popular color this summer

2
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,518
Dark green is too, 
fashionable and nice

3
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,832
Can you tell me how old he is?

4
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,912
Which color tie do you prefer,
dark green or light green?

5
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,516
Where are you?

6
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,718
Your office said you haven't been
at work for two days

7
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,826
I'm OK

8
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,798
Being lazy will make a person feel
more ill, won't it?

9
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,880
Which one do you prefer, 
dark green or light green?

10
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,832
I will pick something out for myself later

11
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,827
Don't bother getting me anything

12
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:23,718
It's better I spend all my money

13
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,309
Now it's ok, my friend is waiting for me

14
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,709
Hello?

15
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,826
I like both of these

16
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:35,717
Thank you

17
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,317
Hello?

18
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,832
I have something to tell you

19
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,832
Let's break up

20
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,918
What's wrong with your voice? 
What happened?

21
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,832
I can't keep living like this anymore

22
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,831
Let me go

23
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,309
Tomorrow, I will have another life

24
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,911
Go back to your wife

25
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,828
From now on, 
we will never see each other again

26
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:15,831
Promise me

27
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:26,918
Hello? Hello?

28
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,912
Why did you treat me like that?

29
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,309
Why do you come here?

30
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,319
Is it morning now?

31
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,867
Miss Zheng, 
are you inside? Miss Zheng?

32
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,996
Miss Zheng, is there anybody inside?

33
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,867
Is there anybody inside? Is there?

34
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,359
What should we do? Open the door?

35
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,512
Go ahead

36
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,825
Hi, I am a social worker in this hospital.
I can help you.

37
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:47,848
Tell her we need to 
get in touch with her family

38
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,826
Get in touch with her family? OK

39
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,486
We want to know your 
family's telephone number

40
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,835
So we can call them to take you home

41
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,834
I have only one wish

42
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,831
I really don't want to die

43
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,826
Please tell them

44
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:11,718
I am very sorry for what I did

45
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,826
I will never do it again

46
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:16,487
She is not sensible now

47
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:18,089
I guess she feels sad too

48
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,833
Let her come to terms with this
by herself for awhile

49
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,885
I see, that's all

50
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:28,829
Tell her to come to the 
police station before she leaves Hong Kong

51
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,114
OK

52
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,309
Forgive me

53
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,717
Forgive me

54
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,826
Hello, can I help you?

55
00:12:57,926 --> 00:12:59,717
Room 1401 Thank you

56
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,290
I'm sorry, Miss

57
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,828
We have moved you to the 12th floor

58
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,833
Why?

59
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,827
Beacuse there will be 
a ritual held in Room 1404

60
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:13,512
What ritual?

61
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,515
Manager, how can I tell her?

62
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,834
A Buddhist ritual

63
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,827
Excuse me...

64
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:01,717
Why are there so many monks here?

65
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,833
That room is cursed now, 
because of a suicide

66
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,829
The monks will chase away the evil

67
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,512
What evil?

68
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,709
All evil!

69
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,830
I'm sorry

70
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,319
Qie...

71
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,512
I'm sorry

72
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,319
Miss! Miss!

73
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,909
What the hell?

74
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,925
Hello, this is Zhang Yi

75
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,204
I can't take your call at the moment

76
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:35,633
Please leave a message

77
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,830
Hello.

78
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,708
I found a shop that buys old furniture

79
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,309
I will get them to 
have a look at ours someday.

80
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,718
Well...I have already 
moved back to my family

81
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,832
Come to pick up 
your things if you're free

82
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,719
But no need now

83
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,831
We also have to pay 
for another two months rent

84
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,831
Well

85
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,517
I don't know which one you prefer,
dark green or light green

86
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,836
So I bought both of them

87
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,827
Why doesn't he pick up the phone?

88
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:23,911
He didn't hear the phone ring?

89
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,827
or he forgot to pay the phone bill?

90
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:33,286
You're so stupid! 
He doesn't want to see you anymore.

91
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:37,826
Why? Why does he ignore me?

92
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:40,718
I only want to hear his voice!

93
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,826
Don't lie to yourself

94
00:20:44,926 --> 00:20:46,826
You are already broken up

95
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:50,310
But why didn't he answer my call?

96
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,848
You are already broken up!

97
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:58,879
So he won't pick up your calls!
Do you understand?

98
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,717
I know

99
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,514
I will never call him again

100
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,512
I will forget him as soon as possible

101
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,797
Be careful if you feel any pain

102
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,290
Young kids, always hurting themselves!

103
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,793
Take it easy when doing exercises

104
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,317
Here is your medicine

105
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,285
Don't drink liquor 
and don't eat spicy food

106
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,794
You can eat something else

107
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,717
Only a little

108
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,514
Because you're pregnant

109
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,515
You'll feel ill at 
the beginning of the second month

110
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,797
No, I can't be pregnant!

111
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,319
Let me look at your hands

112
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,913
Don't delude yourself! 
You're definitely pregnant

113
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:30,798
...Yes...No...Yes...No....Yes...No...

114
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,798
No..No..No..

115
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,114
Hey!

116
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:51,793
Yes..Nooo..Noooo

117
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,788
Hey! You're still counting?

118
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,797
What in the world 
don't you want to have?

119
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,719
I...

120
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,797
I don't want to have a baby

121
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,797
Hey!

122
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,797
Say "Sorry"!

123
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,319
Sorry

124
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,799
No! No!

125
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,309
I told you I never would have jumped!

126
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,708
But I really saw someone else jump

127
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,788
Miss, we searched all the railway

128
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,319
There was nothing there

129
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,285
The other passengers said it looked like
you wanted to jump in front of the train

130
00:27:37,385 --> 00:27:38,918
so, they stopped you

131
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,799
That's not true! I'm going to see my docotor,
I have no reason to jump in front of the train!

132
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,799
I checked. Zheng Jiawen 
will see a docotor at 5:00

133
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,512
a prenatal doctor

134
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,290
My brother's wife was kind of crazy
when she was pregnant

135
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,510
So strange

136
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,198
Call your family to take you home

137
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,514
You had an abortion once before

138
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,309
If you have another abortion

139
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,476
When you want to have a baby in the future

140
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,635
It will be more difficult

141
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,993
Do you understand what I said?

142
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,559
I don't care

143
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,718
You can write 
the reason is that I am neurotic

144
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,515
Say it. Say I'm neurotic

145
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,553
Last time

146
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,989
Did I ask you your reasons or not?

147
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,436
This is the second time

148
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,594
Do you understand?

149
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,149
Did you hear the heartbeat?

150
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,870
In two weeks, the baby will have hands

151
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,316
Well

152
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,876
I will schedule your operation for
two weeks from now, ok?

153
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,120
But, you can cancel it whenever you want

154
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,845
Hello. This is Zhang Yi speaking

155
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,558
I can't answer your call at the moment

156
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,588
Hello. This is Zhang Yi speaking

157
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:23,113
I can't answer your call at the moment

158
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,036
Please leave a message

159
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,669
I need you

160
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,789
Please call me

161
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,915
What things can we take away?

162
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,470
Everything

163
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,875
Even the sofa?

164
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,550
And the desk?

165
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,310
Take everything away

166
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,278
Miss, this sofa is broken

167
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,714
Stop moving it, 
I'll move it another time

168
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,718
Ok, call my company if you want

169
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,071
Why did you ignore me?

170
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,989
Give me more time

171
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,273
Why did you ignore me?

172
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,726
Did I do something wrong to you?

173
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:15,915
I will never see you again!

174
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,914
I just want to forget about the past

175
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,033
I will never bother you!

176
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,116
I changed my mind

177
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,839
Miss, where is the underground station?

178
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,114
Over there

179
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,914
And where is the 
bus station to Qing Shan Dao?

180
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,708
I don't know

181
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,717
It is more easier midstop there

182
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,751
Come with me to look for it

183
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,076
I have a call

184
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,078
Hey! Go away!

185
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,100
Help!

186
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,114
We need to verify your information

187
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,468
Are you Zheng Jiawen?

188
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,476
Yes

189
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,165
Have you been sick in a long time?

190
00:35:59,265 --> 00:36:00,389
Did you take some medicine?

191
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:02,950
No

192
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,845
AIDS? Hepatitis?

193
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:06,512
or anything else?

194
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,637
Yes, I had hepatitis before

195
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,319
Call the lab, hepatitis

196
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,589
Do I need to stay in the hospital?

197
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,196
The person who you 
bit needed 40 stitches

198
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,951
We need to check your information.
Make sure you won't be dangerous to others

199
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,424
After we record your affidavit

200
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:28,475
you can leave

201
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,060
Damn!

202
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,996
If you didn't bite him

203
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,476
He would have been beaten in prsion

204
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,645
So many people were hurt by him

205
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,039
and all wanted to hurt him too

206
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,957
But, you must appear in court

207
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,713
You bit his face so seriously

208
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,036
I'm afraid witnesses 
might not regonize him

209
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,714
I- I bit his face seriously?

210
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,625
Don't worry about it

211
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:02,589
Somebody saw him stop moving 
when he was lying on the ground

212
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,509
But you didn't stop beating him

213
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,476
You see

214
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,948
You are only an emotional pregnant woman

215
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,599
protecting yourself when attacked

216
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,830
That's not wrong!

217
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,195
He admited that

218
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,349
when you were biting him

219
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,436
shouting at him

220
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,596
"Don't touch my baby"

221
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,755
"Don't touch my baby"

222
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,511
Ok, it's time to learn 
how to wash your baby

223
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,109
Before you start

224
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,593
You must check something

225
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,020
what should be checked?

226
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,513
The water temperature

227
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,797
The baby is very sensitive 
to water temperature

228
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,713
So, you must be check it carefully

229
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,713
You can give this job 
to the baby's father

230
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,959
Dad must share responsibility in
looking after baby

231
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,839
If you feel the 
water temperature is good

232
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,598
you can put baby into it

233
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,995
And also note

234
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,230
Don't put the whole baby 
into water at the same time

235
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,759
Put the baby in feet first

236
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,836
slowly....quietly

237
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,229
Try...

238
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,755
Notice baby's response

239
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,636
If no problem, then you can give
your baby a shower

240
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,885
Slowly....ok....some more water

241
00:38:56,985 --> 00:38:57,915
Hold on to baby's head

242
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,307
otherwise his neck will be hurt

243
00:38:59,407 --> 00:39:00,310
Do you understand?

244
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,118
You can also ask your husband to help you

245
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,309
if there are some free seats

246
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,035
Ok, be careful!

247
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,233
You see? You almost let baby drown

248
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,425
Don't put baby 
too far down in the water

249
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:16,397
otherwise it's easy 
to let your baby drown

250
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,670
Do you understand?

251
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,150
Remember!!

252
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,359
Ok, let's do it again

253
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,750
Slowly...

254
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,473
put the baby into the water slowly.

255
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,278
Ok, hold baby's head

256
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,749
Be careful

257
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,353
Can we have a talk?

258
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,755
Where is your husband?

259
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,435
My husband said he will never come back home

260
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,838
I asked him why

261
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,751
He answered "no reason"

262
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,151
You two may have a good talk about that

263
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,433
He will never come back

264
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,754
I called him thousands of times,
but he didn't reply

265
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,029
How can we talk?

266
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,235
Mr. Zhou

267
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,633
You'd better take your wife home first

268
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,033
Everybody should calm down now

269
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,758
Who are you talking to?

270
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,599
Him.
Your husband?

271
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,553
Don't scare me!

272
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,835
I see nobody there!

273
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,799
My husband is living in mainland China

274
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,559
and just called me a few miuntes ago

275
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,235
Who are you?

276
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,870
You are bleeding

277
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,409
I am here, my dear, I am with you

278
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:24,209
Go away...

279
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,620
Please go away...

280
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:25,870
I insist on staying, my dear..

281
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,846
Get out. Hurry. Get out!

282
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:28,909
Don't be afraid. 
I'm with you

283
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,192
Use the left lift

284
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:31,847
I'm with you my dear

285
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:32,875
We're going to 8B too

286
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,248
Get in.

287
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:35,309
Let's get in, my darling

288
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,235
I can't stand this. So painful!

289
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,316
Take it easy, my dear!

290
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,716
Take a deep breath. 
It will be ok soon!

291
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,636
How long will this pain last?

292
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,227
Huh?

293
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:47,428
How long will it last?

294
00:42:47,528 --> 00:42:48,228
My dear. How long?

295
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,953
and when you called me...?

296
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,927
I don't know! I don't know!

297
00:42:53,027 --> 00:42:54,433
So painful!!

298
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,629
Two or three hours.

299
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,156
I don't want to give birth...

300
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,111
Breath deeply. Breath deeply.

301
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,550
Baby will be out soon...

302
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:15,820
What's wrong with her?

303
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,276
I will check her

304
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,959
Take it easy. Slowly

305
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,793
Relax.

306
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,512
You'll be ok. Nothing to worry about

307
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,395
Umbilical cord...

308
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,190
You are away

309
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,795
What do we do now?

310
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:34,940
Don't see, don't see

311
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,590
Breath deeply. Breath deeply

312
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,918
We'll go to the operating room

313
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,716
...you are so panicked

314
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,155
you will hurt the baby

315
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,396
We'll arrive soon

316
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,079
Talk to her...distract her attention

317
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,679
Darling. Relax. Don't worry

318
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,595
I will be with you forever

319
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,313
Don't push too hard! 
You will hurt the baby

320
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,995
Baby's head is out. Careful!

321
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,700
Darling

322
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,756
Mrs. Listen to me

323
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,268
the child will be born soon

324
00:44:09,368 --> 00:44:11,590
We'll help you here, ok?

325
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,420
You must try your best

326
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,153
and the child will too

327
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,358
Ok, let's begin

328
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,029
Push...Push.

329
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,039
Push.

330
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,270
Did you see?

331
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,230
Don't bother her

332
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,380
Don't look. Don't

333
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,660
Push. You will be ok

334
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,639
Come on. Baby will be born soon

335
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,796
Quickly...the baby is so close now

336
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,510
Try. Try your best!

337
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,313
Don't shout!

338
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,310
Is the child ok?

339
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,879
Call Emergency

340
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,313
Prepare to save its life

341
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,999
Don't hurt my baby!

342
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,276
Don't hurt!

343
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,827
Come on, help me! 
There is another patient inside

344
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:06,875
Hurry!

345
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,848
Don't move

346
00:47:09,948 --> 00:47:15,313
Slowly...slowly..

347
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,909
Buddha said

348
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:00,847
Everything will be ok

349
00:48:00,947 --> 00:48:03,849
but sometimes humans are very stupid

350
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:06,912
we are far away from the wisdom

351
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,790
away and away

352
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,910
if we run into problems

353
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,718
we find a way to kill ourselves

354
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,952
and we still think 
we can control everything

355
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,952
These people spend 
2 hours taking the bus everyday

356
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,753
in order to come here to study the exercise

357
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,114
They are all terminal cancer patients

358
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,317
Life and death is only a way of life

359
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,435
No matter what happens

360
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,479
we should still be alive in this world

361
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,478
We always ask ourselves

362
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,315
Why is my own life the worst in the world?

363
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,952
In fact, life is in our hearts

364
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,794
When we meet some troubles

365
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:07,940
We will have different reasons to avoid them

366
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:11,396
Explain what is fate, what is bad

367
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,277
Because our hearts are full of sadness

368
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,279
If we can find out what causes our sadness

369
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,678
Everthing will be solved

370
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,510
Take me to Tongluowan, Huanshibao

371
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,912
Miss, is everything ok?

372
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,399
What's the matter?

373
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,118
Sister, did you see my dad?

374
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,477
It's too late, why isn't your dad back?

375
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,838
Sister, did you see my dad?

376
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,439
Ok. Ok. Well done!

377
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,436
Raise your left leg

378
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,151
Come on.

379
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,038
Great. Come on.

380
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,034
Ok. Relax. 
Do your best to raise your leg

381
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,431
Good! Well done!!

382
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,636
It is very important to do this exercise

383
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,713
before you give birth

384
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,912
use the water. You will feel better

385
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,795
Ok. Go on.

386
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,109
Well done!

387
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,674
I will enter the hospital next week

388
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,510
Why?

389
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,836
You don't need to be there
until your baby's birth

390
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,234
I always have bad dreams at night now

391
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,709
Dreams my baby was born

392
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,070
but without arms and legs

393
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,718
My doctor suggested I stay in the hospital

394
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,871
It is better than staying at home alone

395
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,719
My husband is not at home, so I think
it's better to stay in the hospital

396
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,873
Otherwise my daughter will be scared
when I give birth suddenly

397
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,719
What are you doing?

398
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,871
Why are you there?

399
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,717
Jiawen, what's wrong with you?

400
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,589
What's going on?

401
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,115
Get out! Get out!

402
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,389
Jiawen, what's wrong with you?

403
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,633
She was beating others in a restaurant

404
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,395
She already took tranquilizers

405
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,558
According to her regular doctor,

406
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,869
she is a little depressed

407
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,030
What's wrong? Jiawen

408
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,020
Doctor!

409
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,632
He wants to hurt Mrs. Zhou's baby

410
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,998
Tell Mrs. Zhou

411
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,269
he wants to get her

412
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,748
There is somebody 
who can look after Mrs. Zhou

413
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,391
Can we take care of your baby?

414
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,312
I can help you

415
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,476
to see your baby

416
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,060
Ok.

417
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,834
Enn...it is a bit painful

418
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,788
Just relax

419
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,790
Don't move

420
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,116
You see, everything is ok

421
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,672
Baby's feet are moving!

422
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,309
Can you see?

423
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,869
Isn't that funny?

424
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,354
Baby is very healthy. Don't worry

425
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,715
That woman in the train station
really wanted to hurt my baby!

426
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,557
Every happening has its own reason

427
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,305
If you never did 
anything bad to other people

428
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,877
you shouldn't care 
about something so strange

429
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,718
Why must I accept this bad experience?

430
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,912
I have never hurt others

431
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:45,910
Why am I being treated like this?

432
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,116
Everything can be solved by a pure heart

433
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,908
I think you're always avoiding something

434
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,031
Only you know what you avoid

435
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,157
Who is she? Who on earth is she??

436
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,319
Get out!!

437
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,313
Get out!!

438
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,310
Get out!!

439
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,069
There was a woman who killed herself
here before, wasn't there?

440
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,788
Miss, I've only been working here
for a few days, I don't know

441
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,114
I can't answer any questions

442
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,910
I'm sorry

443
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,116
Next!

444
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,399
Hello. Xiao Dai?

445
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,710
Please find some information about that woman
who wanted to kill herself on the train

446
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,589
I'm writing about her

447
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,715
I also need her picture and address

448
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,311
I want to visit her family

449
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,873
I looked for files all last night

450
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,629
But only found two cases

451
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,397
Can I vist Miss Zhang?

452
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,709
Who's there?

453
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,915
Sir... someone wants to visit

454
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,399
Why did you lie to me?

455
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,878
It's already over

456
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,878
Don't think about it anymore, ok?

457
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,718
Don't lie to yourself! We killed her!

458
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,394
Why didn't you tell me?
your wife killed herself?

459
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,511
We had already broken up!

460
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,556
Why did your wife kill herself?

461
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,709
Don't you know?

462
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,874
Now...she wants to make me die..

463
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,712
Tell her...Tell her!

464
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,314
I didn't make you leave your wife

465
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,719
Yes..It was me..I killed her!

466
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,158
That night

467
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,429
you called me

468
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,915
I miss you!

469
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,230
Me too...where are you now?

470
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,513
Did you tell her about us?

471
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,912
I can't tell you now. 
She's here

472
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,153
I can't wait for you for such a long time!

473
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,260
Don't be mad

474
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,837
No...I want you to be with me right now!

475
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,909
Call me in a bit

476
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,548
It's her call! Don't answer!

477
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,788
Please...don't answer!

478
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,871
We can pretend nothing 
happened between you two

479
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,719
I didn't hear anything

480
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,713
Don't answer

481
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,835
We can pretend nothing 
happened between you two

482
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,317
Why do you treat me like this?

483
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,394
You will regret it

484
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,114
I will make you regret it forever!

485
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:08,940
Hello?

486
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,832
Are you ok?

487
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,434
I will call you

488
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,355
You asked me to call you in a bit

489
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,119
I will make you regret it forever!

490
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,756
Hello.

491
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,580
Hello.

492
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,919
What's happened?

493
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,431
It's me that killed her

494
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,433
I'm sorry

495
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,100
Why did eveything go so wrong?

496
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,751
I'm leaving. Xiao Zhang

497
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,475
Get some rest, ok?

498
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,471
Can we talk now?

499
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,152
I think...

500
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,919
We should break up

501
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,953
It's not good when we're together

502
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,629
I feel so bad

503
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,553
And I think your wife's feeling it too

504
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,911
Let's part from now on

505
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,753
Go back to your wife

506
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,228
What the hell are you saying?

507
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,388
What do you mean?

508
01:08:20,488 --> 01:08:21,029
We have already killed her!

509
01:08:21,129 --> 01:08:23,156
Your wife is waiting for you to have dinner

510
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,917
I'm leaving

511
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,232
It's too late

512
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,633
We have already killed her

513
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:45,900
No

514
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,516
Not me!

515
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,317
I didn't kill her!

516
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,631
It's she who wanted to kill my baby!

517
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,313
What's wrong with you?

518
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,395
Mrs. Zhou

519
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,914
I don't want to give birth to this baby

520
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,397
She made me have such a bad experience

521
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,395
Some people in this world never
want to face the pain

522
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,517
They choose to avoid being hurt

523
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,879
force themselves to forget everything

524
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,792
even pretend nothing happened

525
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,992
they will do their best

526
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,439
to stop something from happening

527
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,757
Jiawen is one of them

528
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,038
She forced herself back to the time
when your wife was still alive

529
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,913
And asked you about your relationship
in that virtual space

530
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,556
She thought if your relationship was over
before your wife died, it would be better

531
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,553
But...she still can't forget that you
hurt your wife and let her die

532
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,991
She has some psychological problems

533
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,389
She couldn't stop the illusion
even though she was hurt by you

534
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,150
In a word

535
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,312
She is searching for a special way
to save your wife

536
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,634
Please help her

537
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,717
I have already made my wife die

538
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,719
so I don't want to make her die too

539
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,710
and our baby

540
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,315
We must wait for the birth of the baby

541
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,752
It's too dangerous to take medicine now

542
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,311
Don't let him hurt your baby! Mrs. Zhou

543
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,639
Don't hurt her baby! Mrs. Zhou

544
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:20,749
I can't stand the pain!

545
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,309
Mrs. Zhou

546
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,239
The baby is coming out, here

547
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,755
Your baby will be out soon

548
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:30,756
Relax. Take it easy

549
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,314
Push...

550
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,759
Breathe, breathe

551
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,273
Again. Again

552
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:09,469
Baby is out

553
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,669
Here's your baby

554
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,513
He is not her baby!

555
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,832
Baby, everything is ok

556
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,153
Her baby is about to be born!

557
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,639
carry her to the operating room
as quickly as possible

558
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,440
Baby's dad is an artist

559
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,620
After we broke up

560
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,151
I learned I was pregnant with his child

561
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,878
He already had a wife then

562
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,153
and a happy family

563
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,153
I will take responsibility

564
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:55,152
And support my child 
in the future by myself

565
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,074
You see, she is so lovely

566
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,632
She will love me

567
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,635
I love you too, baby
