1
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,791
Do you prefer dark green or light green?

2
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:50,750
<i>Where have you been?</i>

3
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,208
<i>Your coworkers say</i>
<i>you haven't been to work for two days.</i>

4
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,166
Relax.

5
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,375
Let's not drag this out,
or we'll loathe each other at the end.

6
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,958
So do you prefer dark green
or light green?

7
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,041
<i>It hurts me to see you like this.</i>

8
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,125
<i>Just give me more time.</i>

9
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,625
I'll be fine after I spend all my money.

10
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,750
I've got to go.
My friends are waiting for me.

11
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,375
<i>Call me back later.</i>

12
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,916
<i>Is it late enough to call?</i>

13
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,416
You told meâ€¦

14
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,750
<i>Hello?</i>

15
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,958
You told me to call you later.

16
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,375
<i>What's wrong with you? You sound strange.</i>

17
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,958
I can get through this.

18
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,083
It's my third breakup already.

19
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,625
I will be a new person tomorrow.

20
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,041
You know what is meant by
"pushing the limit"?

21
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:59,958
When it hurts too much,
you can't feel anymore.

22
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,000
Then you'll get better.

23
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,833
Hello?

24
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,291
Hello?

25
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,041
Why bother to ask me to callâ€¦

26
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,708
What are you people doing here?

27
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,333
Is it already eight o'clock?

28
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,250
I'm here as their interpreter.

29
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:49,583
They want your home phone number
to notify your family.

30
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,208
I wasn't thinking straight.

31
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,916
I didn't mean to kill myself.

32
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:07,791
Please tell them that I'm sorry
for causing all this trouble.

33
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,000
I promise I won't do this again.

34
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,375
I'm sorry.

35
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,500
I'm sorry.

36
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,625
Hey.

37
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,666
I found a shop today
that buys secondhand furniture.

38
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,125
I told them to come up and take a look.

39
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,708
I moved back to my own place.

40
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,791
If you have time,
come and pack up your stuff.

41
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,000
There's no hurry, though.

42
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,875
There're still two months left
on the lease.

43
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,416
Guess what?

44
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,708
I don't know if you prefer
dark green or light green.

45
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,083
So I bought both colors for youâ€¦

46
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,666
Why did it happen that way?

47
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:23,000
Did he miss the call
or forget to pay the phone bill?

48
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,625
Don't be stupid! He wanted to ignore you.

49
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,583
Why did he ignore me?

50
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,500
All I wanted was to listen to his voice.

51
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,791
Stop fooling yourself.

52
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,708
You've split up with him already.

53
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,083
Why didn't he answer my call?

54
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,791
I'll repeat one more time!

55
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,083
He dumped you!
Why should he answer your call?

56
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,833
Don't you see?

57
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,583
Yes, I do now.

58
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,083
I'll never call him again.

59
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,083
I'll forget him very soon.

60
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,875
TONGJITANG HERBAL MEDICINES

61
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,208
Be careful next time.

62
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:42,416
You youngsters should exercise more often.

63
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,458
You'll need three doses.

64
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:29,833
Keep your wound area dry
and don't eat spicy food.

65
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:33,083
If you really want something sour,
you can have a small amount.

66
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,416
Pregnant women always feel nauseous
in the first two months.

67
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,875
But I'm not pregnant.

68
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:51,958
Let me check your pulse again.

69
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:08,041
You youngsters are so messed up!

70
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:21,208
Yesâ€¦ Noâ€¦ Yesâ€¦ Noâ€¦

71
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,791
-Noâ€¦ Noâ€¦ Noâ€¦
-Noâ€¦ Yesâ€¦

72
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,250
Yes?

73
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:44,291
Yesâ€¦ Noâ€¦ Yesâ€¦ Noâ€¦ Yesâ€¦

74
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,916
No.

75
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:52,458
Yo!

76
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:54,208
You're still doing that?

77
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,916
What is it exactly you don't want?

78
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,208
Iâ€¦

79
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,166
I don't want a baby!

80
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:01,708
Hey!

81
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,500
Can't you say sorry?

82
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,416
Sorry, then.

83
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,083
Hey!

84
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,375
It wasn't me!

85
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,833
I really saw someone jumped!

86
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,958
We've searched the entire track, ma'am.

87
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,458
We've found nothing.

88
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,583
Other people said
you were the one planning to jump,

89
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:34,125
so they grabbed you.

90
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,375
I was on my way to see a doctor.
Why would I try to kill myself?

91
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:46,833
The doctor's office confirmed
a five o'clock appointment for Joey Cheng.

92
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:48,125
A gynecology appointment.

93
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:56,750
My sister-in-law acted funny too
when she was pregnant.

94
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,833
Call your family to pick you up.

95
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,750
You've done it once already.

96
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,333
Too many operations may cause you problems

97
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,666
by the time you really want a baby.

98
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,083
Do you understand what I'm saying?

99
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,458
I don't think I'm ready.

100
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,250
Can't you just put in my file

101
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,333
that I'm not mentally stable?

102
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,625
Did I ask you for a reason
the last time I approved the procedure?

103
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,708
This would be your second abortion.

104
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,416
You may want to think twice.

105
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:07,375
Hear the heartbeat?

106
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,958
In two weeks,
you'll be able to see the hands.

107
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,291
I'll schedule the procedure
for two weeks from now.

108
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:35,083
But you can always cancel it.

109
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,791
<i>This is Sam. I'm not available right now,</i>
<i>please leave a message.</i>

110
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,416
<i>This is Sam. I'm not available right now,</i>
<i>please leave a message.</i>

111
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:25,291
I have something important to tell you.

112
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,375
Call me back.

113
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:52,500
What do you want us to take away?

114
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,250
Everything.

115
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,750
Don't want the sofa?
What about the dining table?

116
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,416
Take it all.

117
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,833
Ma'am, your sofa is broken.

118
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,500
Would you mind finishing up
at a later time?

119
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,958
Sure, just give us a call.

120
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,541
Do you have to hide from me like this?

121
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:58,958
Give me some more time.

122
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:02,916
Why do you avoid my calls?

123
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,250
What have I done to make you--

124
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,833
Stop asking, please!

125
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,125
I'll see you when the time is right.

126
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,333
I won't bother you anymore.

127
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:11,916
Wait.

128
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:23,333
I don't want these anymore.

129
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:20,875
Excuse me.

130
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,750
Do you know where the subway is?

131
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,916
It's over there.

132
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,791
What about the bus stop?

133
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,291
I don't know.

134
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,333
The bus is more convenient for me.

135
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,583
Perhaps you can come look for it with me?

136
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:43,875
Let me call someoneâ€¦ Hey!

137
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,958
I need to verify some information.

138
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,458
Are you Joey Cheng?

139
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,250
Yes.

140
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:55,083
Any medical issues,
or taking any medications?

141
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:57,500
No.

142
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:01,375
Do you have HIV, Hepatitis B,
or any other transmittable diseases?

143
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,500
I have Hepatitis B.

144
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,791
Let Ward B know about her Hepatitis B.

145
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,333
Do I have to be admitted?

146
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,083
The man bitten by you needed
more than 40 stitches.

147
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:20,583
I just needed to check for
any transmittable diseases.

148
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:23,291
You may leave after the officer
takes your statement.

149
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,958
Don't worry, he had it coming!

150
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,750
He'll be beaten by someone in jail anyway.

151
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,666
We have a dozen victims
waiting to identify him.

152
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,416
But you'll have to testify in court.

153
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:48,166
I don't think anyone can identify him
after what you've done to his face.

154
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,208
What happened? I bit his face?

155
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Eyewitnesses said
he laid motionless on the ground

156
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,666
and you were still biting him.

157
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:04,000
When it comes to
a pregnant woman protecting herself,

158
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,416
no one can challenge you.

159
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,166
The bastard even admitted
that you were yelling the whole time,

160
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,666
"Don't hurt my baby!"

161
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:10,500
Well done. Again, inhale, exhaleâ€¦

162
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,416
Class, now it's bathing time.

163
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,666
Before we bathe a child,

164
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,083
we should check the water temperature.

165
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,208
A baby's skin is very sensitive,

166
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,791
so we have to check
the temperature carefully.

167
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,125
Have daddy test the water. He can do it.

168
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:26,625
Check the water temperature.

169
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,625
If the temperature is right,
place the baby in the water.

170
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:32,000
Don't just drop the baby in, though.

171
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:37,500
Ease the baby's feet in the water first.

172
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,333
Gently splash some water on them.

173
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:43,291
Watch for his reaction.

174
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:46,958
If everything seems fine,
then you can start bathing him.

175
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,250
Do it gently,
splash a little water on him.

176
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:55,375
Make sure you support
the baby's neck at all times.

177
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,500
Hold firmly.

178
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:00,958
Daddy can help holding
the baby's head too.

179
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,625
That's right.

180
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,375
Someone's drowning!

181
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,291
Always remember,

182
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,625
never place your baby
all the way into the water!

183
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:16,125
Let's do it one more time.

184
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:20,875
Put the baby into the water slowly.

185
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:24,625
Remember not to put the baby
all the way in, okay?

186
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:26,208
Be careful.

187
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,041
Can we talk?

188
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,125
Your husband?

189
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:37,541
My husband told me he isn't coming back.

190
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:44,416
I asked him why,
but he never gave me a straight answer.

191
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,833
You should talk with him patiently.

192
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,166
He's not coming back.

193
00:41:55,875 --> 00:42:02,833
He always hangs up on me!
How can I talk with him?

194
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,833
Mr. Chow,

195
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,541
maybe you should take your wife home now.

196
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,666
Talk it over when she calms down.

197
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,208
Who are you talking to?

198
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:32,166
Isn't he your husband?

199
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:40,208
Don't scare me.

200
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,500
I don't see anyone here.

201
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,750
My husband just called me from China.

202
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,625
Who are you?

203
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,708
You're bleeding!

204
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,708
Hang on, honey.

205
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:19,666
Hurry! Please take the next elevator.

206
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:20,958
Hurry!

207
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:24,208
-Use the next elevator.
-Hang in there.

208
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:28,208
-We're going to Ward 8B too.
-Let her in.

209
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,541
Hang on, honey.

210
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,791
-Relax.
-Relax, honey.

211
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:36,458
We'll get there soon,
just take a deep breath.

212
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:38,083
How long has it been
since her water broke?

213
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:44,041
Honey, did the water just break
when you called me?

214
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:47,416
I don't know anything! Oh, it hurts!

215
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,958
-I suppose two to three hours.
-I don't want this.

216
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:55,708
What is this? What's happening?

217
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,541
Fred, I'm so scared.

218
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:59,958
Don't panic. We'll get out very soon!

219
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,250
Just take a deep breath.

220
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:04,458
Just breathe.
That's right, you're doing fine.

221
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:08,750
I can'tâ€¦ The baby is coming out!

222
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,666
I'll take a look.

223
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,625
-Take it easy.
-It hurts.

224
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,750
Don't get yourself worked up.

225
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:18,541
It's all right.

226
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,416
The cord came out.

227
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:24,833
Excuse me.

228
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,250
-Nurse, what is it?
-Don't look!

229
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,666
It hurts.

230
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,833
Hang in there! Deep breath!
Just hang in there.

231
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:35,916
Hang on till we make it to the labor ward!

232
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,666
Stop moving around,
you might hurt your baby.

233
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,750
Hang on! We're not there yet.

234
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:43,083
Keep her distracted by talking to her.

235
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:48,958
Honey, try to relax. You'll be okay.

236
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:51,500
Don't push or you'll hurt the baby!

237
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,333
The head is out
and is wrapped by the umbilical cord.

238
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,666
Honey, try to relax.

239
00:44:58,166 --> 00:45:02,708
Ma'am, listen carefully.
Your baby is now in the birth canal.

240
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:06,125
We'll have to deliver your child here.

241
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:08,958
You have to work hard on it, understand?

242
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,625
Now, give it a try and push!

243
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:15,166
Use all the strength you've got.

244
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:18,833
Very well, let's try again.

245
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:23,875
Very good, try harder! Push!

246
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:28,166
Good! The baby is coming out!

247
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:32,708
Push harder!

248
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,958
You're doing great! Keep on pushing!

249
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:48,208
Do you see that?

250
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,291
Push! Your child is counting on you!

251
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,250
-Do you see that?
-Don't bother us right now!

252
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:57,416
Just turn away! Don't look!

253
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:13,333
Push hardâ€¦

254
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:16,416
Push the baby out! He needs to breathe!

255
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,958
Push hard!

256
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,166
Don't scream!

257
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,041
Don't scream!

258
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,125
Keep pushing.

259
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:05,208
-Is the baby going to make it?
-Try to get help from outside!

260
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,500
We're having a difficult labor here!
Get ready for an emergency!

261
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:43,125
Don't touch my baby!

262
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,333
Don't touch my baby!

263
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,541
Come help! There's another patient inside!

264
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,666
Buddha once said

265
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:52,125
that each being is born with the wisdom
to transcend all sufferings.

266
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,333
But this wisdom is clouded by
earthly obsessions and desires.

267
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:02,916
These desires constantly distract us
from the path towards nirvana.

268
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:10,500
Love and separation, hatred and revenge,
these are all aspects of life.

269
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,416
You might not accept every aspect of life.

270
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:18,708
But you have no right
to reject your own life.

271
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:29,791
These people take two hours
everyday to travel here.

272
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,916
They come for the Qigong therapy.

273
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:35,166
They are all cancer patients.

274
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:39,208
Aging, disease and death
are all parts of life.

275
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:45,125
No matter how much you're suffering,

276
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:47,416
you have to complete the journey
on your own.

277
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:50,791
Humans are born with the ability to see
every incarnation of existence.

278
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:56,916
<i>But as we age,</i>
<i>this ability gradually fades away.</i>

279
00:49:57,333 --> 00:50:02,541
<i>Only at two points in our life</i>
<i>could this ability be recalled.</i>

280
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,958
<i>The first is when you're close to death.</i>

281
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:09,875
<i>The second is when you're conceiving life.</i>

282
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:15,333
Both situations have happened to you.

283
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:24,458
Is there anything
I can do to exorcise these spirits?

284
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:27,166
Or simply stop the channeling?

285
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:31,916
All beings are equal. No existence
is inherently evil or virtuous.

286
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:34,291
Humans and spirits share the universe,

287
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:37,208
All you can do is accept this reality.

288
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,666
Causeway Bay, please.

289
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,458
Don't panic.

290
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:04,583
They won't bother meâ€¦

291
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:19,541
Are you all right, ma'am?

292
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:51,583
What? Don't throw up in my car!

293
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:31,708
Ma'am, what time is it?

294
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,916
What time is it?

295
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,375
Miss, have you seen my dad around?

296
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:01,791
-What time is it?
-Have you seen my dad?

297
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:05,375
-Missâ€¦
-Why hasn't he come home yet?

298
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,458
What time is it?

299
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,791
Left, inhale.

300
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:00,875
Right, exhale.

301
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:03,333
That's right, keep going.

302
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:08,708
Lift up your left leg, inhale.

303
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,833
Right leg, exhale. One more time.

304
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,500
Left, inhale.

305
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,875
Keep your breathing steady,
and lift your leg all the way up.

306
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:27,250
Left, inhale. Right, exhale.

307
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:28,916
Keep going!

308
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,750
Well done, girls!

309
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:34,916
This set of exercises
is particularly helpful.

310
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:38,583
Once you become capable of relaxing
your body under the water pressure,

311
00:56:38,708 --> 00:56:41,500
you'll be able to minimize
your pain during contractions.

312
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:43,708
Let's continue with the practice.

313
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,458
Keep going. Left, inhale.

314
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:22,541
Good girl.

315
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:26,125
I'm going to check
into the hospital next week.

316
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:28,958
So soon?

317
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:32,125
Isn't your due date
in the middle of the month?

318
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,875
I keep having dreams about

319
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:41,333
my baby being born
with a missing arm or leg.

320
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,333
My doctor recommended me
to stay in the hospital

321
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:46,583
instead of worrying at home all by myself.

322
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:50,541
It's safer this way
since my husband is not around.

323
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:55,250
I don't want to scare my daughter
when my contractions start.

324
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,958
What are you doing?

325
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:38,750
What are you doing there?

326
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,833
What's the matter with you?

327
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,875
Come out!

328
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:54,541
Come out!

329
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:07,208
Joey, what's the matter with you?

330
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:13,166
What's wrong with you?

331
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:43,625
She was attacking people in a restaurant.

332
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:46,125
They sedated her before bringing her here.

333
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:49,458
Preliminary psychiatric diagnosis
indicates prenatal depression.

334
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,750
How are you doing, Joey Cheng?

335
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,750
Doctor.

336
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,916
He's threatening Mrs. Chow's baby.

337
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:05,583
Please warn her.

338
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,083
He's trying to crawl into her womb.

339
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:13,041
Mrs. Chow has been taken care of.

340
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:17,750
Let's see how Joey's baby is doing,
shall we?

341
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,291
The endoscope will show us
how the little one is doing.

342
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,000
Okay.

343
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,791
Now, this'll hurt a little bit.

344
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:06,291
Don't worry.

345
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:10,333
Don't move, though.
Everything seems normal.

346
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:19,375
See that? She's kicking.

347
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:25,000
Isn't that amazing?

348
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:30,541
She looks healthy. You can relax.

349
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:57,458
Buddhists believe in reincarnation.

350
01:01:58,291 --> 01:02:01,291
We die, come back,
and suffer all over again.

351
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:04,083
It's a never-ending cycle.

352
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:06,333
Beside every pregnant woman

353
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,458
stands a spirit awaiting reincarnation.

354
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:14,250
When the time comes, the spirit would move
into the mother's womb to be born again.

355
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,625
What you witnessed in the elevator
was an instance of a failed rebirth.

356
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:21,875
That ghost did not kill the baby.

357
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:25,791
I didn't tell you this
because I didn't want to worry you.

358
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:32,541
But why? Why me?

359
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,291
It's all karma.

360
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:41,041
Our actions in this life determine
how we come back in the next.

361
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:53,416
But I've never met that woman before.

362
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:55,750
Why is she bothering me?

363
01:02:57,125 --> 01:03:00,625
Karma is not about payback.

364
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:06,625
Once reincarnated, we will be depleted
of the memory of our previous life.

365
01:03:06,708 --> 01:03:08,750
Whoâ€¦

366
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,916
Who the hell is she?

367
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:39,958
Come on out!

368
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,791
Come out!

369
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:57,541
Come out.

370
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:07,916
Was there ever a woman
who jumped off the platform?

371
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,833
Ma'am, I've just started working here,

372
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:15,041
and I don't think
I have to answer this question.

373
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,583
Next, please!

374
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,833
<i>Hello, Derek?</i>

375
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:30,458
<i>Please get me a list of</i>
<i>women who have committed rail suicide.</i>

376
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:32,875
<i>I'm writing an article for someone.</i>

377
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,416
<i>I need the photos and addresses</i>
<i>of the victims.</i>

378
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,666
<i>I want to interview their families.</i>

379
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,583
Baby.

380
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,000
Say "bye-bye" to your friend.

381
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,708
Forgive your mother.

382
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:27,375
So you've finally come out!

383
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:06,875
Why are you doing this to me?

384
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,458
Who are you?

385
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:19,375
Why are you doing this to me?

386
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,833
Hello.

387
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:05,833
Derek?

388
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:09,541
I spent the whole night searching.

389
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:11,875
I only came up with two incidents.

390
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,333
She was my wife.

391
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:09,875
Am I the reason she killed herself?

392
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:15,875
When did it happen?

393
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:20,416
Why didn't you tell me?

394
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:45,291
I already ruined one life.

395
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:52,500
I don't want to ruin yours too.

396
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,416
I don't want you
to become like what I am now!

397
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:17,541
Marriage

398
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:21,416
is not always for life.

399
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,916
There could be so many reasons

400
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,833
why people split up.

401
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:37,708
Some people move on.

402
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:45,125
Others choose toâ€¦

403
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:52,708
To take impulsive actions.

404
01:10:55,666 --> 01:10:59,416
No one should be blamed for it.

405
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:05,333
I wish things were so simple that
it's merely a matter of who to blame.

406
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:12,000
But in fact, what matters is
whether you can forget.

407
01:11:16,208 --> 01:11:18,666
I can't face you anymore!

408
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,666
I can't face you without thinking of her!

409
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,333
That night,

410
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:49,083
when you called me from Thailand.

411
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:51,625
Do you prefer dark green or light green?

412
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:53,875
Where have you been?

413
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:57,125
Your coworkers say
you haven't been to work for two days.

414
01:11:57,208 --> 01:12:01,291
<i>Relax. Let's not drag this out,</i>
<i>or we'll loathe each other at the end.</i>

415
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:03,583
It hurts me to see you like this.

416
01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:09,333
Just give me more time.

417
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:15,583
I've got to go.
My friends are waiting for me.

418
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,458
Call me back later.

419
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:28,666
It's her again! Don't you dare `answer!

420
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:31,916
I beg you not to answer.

421
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,875
Let's pretend nothing has happened.

422
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:37,583
Let's pretend I'd never heard of her.

423
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:40,875
Don't answer!

424
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,375
We'll pretend nothing has happened!

425
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,291
Why are you doing this to me?

426
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:06,916
You'll regret this.

427
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:10,208
You'll regret this for life.

428
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:19,375
Is it late enough to call?

429
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,916
You sound strange. What's wrong with you?

430
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:26,666
When it hurts too much,
you can't feel anymore.

431
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:29,250
You'll regret this for life!

432
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:16,041
Sometime laterâ€¦

433
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:19,791
the police called.

434
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:31,666
I'm sorry.

435
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:37,750
I'm sorry.

436
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:45,958
How did it end up like this?

437
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,250
All we can do now isâ€¦

438
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,500
try to forget the whole thing.

439
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,000
But how?

440
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:03,916
She's going to be our child!

441
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:07,375
I'm carrying our child!

442
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:10,625
Your wife is going to be our child!

443
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:14,000
What's that?

444
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:19,000
Why is this happening?

445
01:16:19,083 --> 01:16:21,250
It's not due yet!

446
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:32,875
Breathe steadily.

447
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:38,541
-Exhale and relaxâ€¦
-Mrs. Chowâ€¦

448
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,875
You're not due yet.

449
01:16:40,958 --> 01:16:46,416
I don't want to give birth!
She broke my water.

450
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:49,916
I don't want to give birth anymore.

451
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:50,958
Take it easy.

452
01:16:51,916 --> 01:16:54,125
That's right. You're doing good.

453
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:57,666
I don't want toâ€¦

454
01:16:59,333 --> 01:17:00,458
I don'tâ€¦

455
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:05,583
Mrs. Chowâ€¦

456
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,750
Mrs. Chow!

457
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:22,166
Don't let him touch your baby!

458
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:42,833
Don't touch her baby! Mrs. Chow!

459
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,958
I can't go on.

460
01:18:56,958 --> 01:18:58,958
I can't go on!

461
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:01,083
Mrs. Chow!

462
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:07,916
The baby is ready to come out!
Let's deliver here.

463
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,583
It won't take long.
Don't panic. Take it easy.

464
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:14,375
Take a deep breath, then push hard!

465
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:17,666
Again, breathe and push!

466
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:21,791
Good, one more time.

467
01:19:22,416 --> 01:19:23,958
The baby's head is coming out!

468
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:35,000
Push harder! You're almost there.

469
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,000
Yes. One more time.

470
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:37,916
Harder.

471
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,625
The baby is out!

472
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:04,333
Look, your baby.

473
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:22,500
She's not your baby!

474
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:50,541
We'll be all right very soon, baby.

475
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:57,166
Very, very soon.

476
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:58,250
It's okay.

477
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:03,166
Mommy will take good care of you.

478
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:55,750
I won't let you become my baby.

479
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,333
I won't let you become my baby.

480
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,125
I can't let you die.

481
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:23,958
I beg you.

482
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:26,958
Let me move on.

483
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:29,708
All I wantâ€¦

484
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:33,958
is to forget everything.

485
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:38,000
The baby has entered the birth canal!
Rush her to the labor ward!

486
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:59,750
Sweetie, here's your godmother.

487
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:06,083
Remember she was here when you were born?

488
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,250
I think he remembers.

489
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:16,750
I've divorced him.

490
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:21,708
It's a beginning of a new life.

491
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:28,583
We've even moved in with my mother.

492
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:36,375
Let's invite Godmother over for dinner
after she leaves the hospital, okay?

493
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:45,333
Do you know my son
looks a lot like my father?

494
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:49,125
Down to the same birthmark.

495
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,000
Cheer up.

496
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:34,416
It's a beginning
of a new life for all of us.

497
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:47,833
Joey Cheng.

498
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:49,791
Now that your arms are healed,

499
01:29:49,875 --> 01:29:52,166
do you want to hold the baby and feed her?

500
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:30,833
Baby?

501
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,958
Baby?

502
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,041
She's so cute.

503
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:51,291
Forgive me.

504
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:36,375
Let's do this together! Inhaleâ€¦

505
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:39,416
Very good, one more time.

506
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:42,625
Inhale, exhale.
