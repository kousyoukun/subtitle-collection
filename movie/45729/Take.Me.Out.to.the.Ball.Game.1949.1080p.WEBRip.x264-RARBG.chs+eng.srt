Now, picture this, here we are the greatest team in baseball, the champs and this little fathead from Providence is gonna come down here and teach us the game.

走远点怎么样?
How about stepping out a little?

354
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,708
就我们两个人?

你们这些球员不是应该在训练吗?

357
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,792
培训?谁,我吗?哈!
Training? Who, me? Ha!

358
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,792
我不相信它。

388
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,292
你像一扇生锈的门。

392
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,958

395
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,542
噢,谢谢你。

401
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,917
奥布莱恩先生，事情是这样的。
You see, Mr. O'Brien, here's what's happening.

402
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,875
你不是像这样跨进球里而是跨进这里，跨进桶里。嗯?
Instead of stepping into the ball like this you're stepping over here and, uh, into the bucket. Hm?

403
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,833
让我把话说清楚。
Now, uh, let me get this straight.

404
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:28,333
当我站在盘子前的时候，我就像这样?
Uh, when I stand at the plate, I'm like this, hmm?

405
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:30,667
不，我把它举高一点，在这里。
No, I hold it a little higher, up here.

在这里，看到了吗?
Up here, you see?

407
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:37,000
在等待投球的时候，我扭动了一下。
And while waiting for the pitch, I wiggle a little bit.

408
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,667
像这样。
Like this.

409
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,292
只是为了让自己准备好。
Just to get myself set.

410
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,667
是的。是的，我注意到了。

411
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,583
-现在球过来了…
- Now as the ball comes over..

412
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,583
——嗯?
- Uh-huh?

413
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,750
当你把球棒拿回来的时候，试着踩进去，就像…
Try stepping into it as you bring the bat back like..

414
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,125
噢!
Ow!

415
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,625
对不起,O ' brien先生。
Sorry, Mr. O'Brien.

416
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,667
请您尝尝好吗?
Would you try it, please?

417
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,375
给他讲讲，好吗，乔?
Pitch to him, would you, Joe?

418
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,375
但是手臂要轻一点。
But easy on that arm.

419
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,458
对，手臂放轻一点。
Yeah, easy on the arm.

420
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,250
好吧。
Okay.

421
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,208
嘿!戳!
Hey! What a poke!

422
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,500
哇!在任何一个球场都有四个垒!
Wow! That's four bases in any ball park!

423
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,167
就是这样，埃迪，但别想把他们都杀了。
That's the idea, Eddie, but don't try to kill them all.

424
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,583
辛辛那提的查理·戴维斯只打出了279分却打出了102分。
You know, Charlie Davis of Cincinnati only hit 279 but he batted in a 102 runs.

425
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,167
你为什么不叫查理·戴维斯?
Why don't you get Charlie Davis?

426
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,625
别说了，埃迪。
Cut the cracks, Eddie.

427
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,667
吉尔胡利先生，我好像接替了你的工作。
Oh, Mr. Gilhuly I-I seem to have taken over your job.

428
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,375
哈!没关系，希金斯小姐。
Ha! Not at all, Miss Higgins.

429
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,375
不客气。
Not at all.

430
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,833
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

431
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,833
请原谅我。
Please forgive me.

432
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,292
我们回酒店见。
I'll see you back at the hotel.

433
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,958
很好。好吧。
Fine. Alright.

434
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,958
让我们在里面忙起来。
Let's get busy in there.

435
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,917
绕过了。来吧,戴维斯。
Get around now. Come on, Davis.

436
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,917
你起来。
You're up.

437
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,167
- - - - - -来吧。
- Come on.

438
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,167
-好的，丹尼小子…
- Alright, Denny boy..

439
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,917
- - - - - -来吧。男孩。
- Come on. boys.

440
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,917
-好的，现在抓住一个!
- Alright now get a hold of one!

441
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,917
——嘿!
- Hey!

442
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,917
-嘿，小心!
- Hey, look out!

443
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,833
哇!不是这个东西吗?
Gee! Ain't that somethin'?

444
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,333
她是我一直梦想的那种女孩。
She's the kind of girl I've always dreamed about.

445
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,667
嫁给一个打棒球的姑娘多好啊!
Wouldn't it be wonderful to be married to a girl who played baseball?

446
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,667
哇!
Gee!

447
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,292
是的，我记得上个赛季我们在和斯克兰顿比赛。
Yeah, I remember this time last season we were playing Scranton.

448
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,917
——是吗?
- Yeah?

449
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,917
——伟大的城市。很棒的城市!
- Great town. Great town!

450
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,458
不管怎么说，有个叫玛克辛的女人她对我很有好感一个非常优雅，有艺术气质的小妞，精力充沛。
Well, anyway, there's a dame there named Maxine who's kind of sweet on me a very refined, artistic little chick with plenty on the ball.

451
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,000
一个马戏团的女舞者。
A cooch dancer from the circus.

452
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,792
这就是我的意思!
That's what I mean!

453
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,500
金伯格，把面包给我。
Hey, Goldberg, give me the bread.

454
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:32,458
总之，这个风骚妞对我来说很温暖有天晚上她送我回家。
Anyway, this minx is really warm for me and one night she's walking me home after the show.

455
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:37,292
突然间，我听到了一声笛声，就像这样。
And all of a sudden, I hear a flute playing a cooch dance you know, like this..

456
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:50,958
-晚上好，孩子们。
- Good evening, boys.

457
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:50,958
,晚上好。
- Good evening.

458
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,125
-晚上好，希金斯小姐。
- Evening, Miss Higgins.

459
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,125
——你好,丹尼。
- Hello, Denny.

460
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,167
坐下来。
Sit down.

461
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,375
你以为这是什么，正式场合吗?
What do you think it is, a formal affair?

462
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,083
她也要和我们一起吃饭吗?
She gonna eat with us, too?

463
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,625
嘿，注意你们的语言，伙计们还有你们的餐桌礼仪。
Hey, watch your language, fellas and your table manners, too.

464
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,792
她叫我丹尼
Gee, she called me Denny.

465
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,208
这可能不是个好主意，希金斯小姐。
This may not be such a good idea, Miss Higgins.

466
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,667
你有点限制了他们的风格。
You're kind of cramping their style.

467
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,417
是的。她们不习惯和裙子一起吃饭。
Yeah. They're not used to eating with skirts.

468
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,833
我的意思是女士。
I-I mean ladies.

469
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:25,042
听着，迈克，他们越早习惯我的存在对我们大家都越好。
Look, Mike, the sooner they get used to seeing me around the better it's going to be for all of us.

470
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,542
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

471
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,708
能麻烦谁把面包递给我吗?
Uh, would someone be so kind as to pass me the bread, please?

472
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,542
——是的,的确。
- Yes, indeed.

473
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,542
——快乐。
- With pleasure.

474
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,917
谢谢你！
Thank you.

475
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,708
注意礼貌。
Mind your manners.

476
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,875
——嘘!
- Shh!

477
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,875
-怎么了?
- What's the matter?

478
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,292
我翘了小指，对吧?
I had my pinkie out, didn't I?

479
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,000
脾气,Zalinka先生。
Temper, Mr. Zalinka.

480
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,000
脾气,脾气!
Temper, temper!

481
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,417
你们看到这周《名利场》的时尚版了吗
Have you boys seen the fashion page in this week's "Vanity Fair?"

482
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,917
嗯，有一条最可爱的裤子，顶部是钉钉的，底部是窄的。
Well, there's the cutest pair of pants with a pegged top and a narrow bottom..

483
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,083
请原谅我的表达方式，还有，嘿，埃迪，看，我们被涂得满地都是!
If you'll pardon the expression, and there's-- Hey, Eddie, look, we're plastered all over the paper!

484
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,875
——嘿!很好!
- Hey! Pretty nice!

485
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,875
-上面说什么?
- What's it say?

486
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,875
-是啊，上面怎么说?
- Yeah, what's it say?

487
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,875
-上面说什么?
- What's it say?

488
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,375
-是啊，上面怎么说?
- Yeah, what's it say?

489
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,375
-我们要告诉他们吗?
- Shall we tell 'em?

490
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,042
——好吗?
- Shall we?

491
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,042
-没问题。
- By all means.

Hey, how about a game of checkers before we hit the hay?

571
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,625
——跳棋吗?这是消防员。
- Checkers? That's for firemen.

572
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,625
——消防员?

00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,458
-野性的呼唤

618
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,458
-带她出去约会。

619
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:35,500
我们再找两个女孩，然后我们就走。

Denny, I've got a hunch that girl is human.

621
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,625
——没有。
- No.

622
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:38,625
——是的!
- Yes!

623
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:40,458
猜猜她喜欢谁。
And guess who she's crazy about.

624
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:43,042
——你!
- You!

625
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:43,042
——我,个人?你这样认为吗?
- Me, personally? You think so?

626
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,542
当然，Denny，就是这个了。
Sure, Denny, this is it.

627
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,458
如果她是女人，她想要浪漫。
If she's a dame, she wants romance.

628
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:51,583
她还是个贵妇人。

629
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:51,583
丹尼，你的机会来了。
Denny, here's your chance.

630
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:57,000
手的触碰，淡淡的抚摩月光下几句温柔的悄悄话。
A touch of the hand, a subtle caress a few tender little nothings whispered in the moonlight.

631
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,417
哦!丹尼，由你决定。
Aw! Denny, it's up to you.

632
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,667
但我什么都不懂，艾德。
But I don't know any tender little nothings, Ed.

633
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:08,333
我的经验是，像希金斯这样运动型的女孩可能会像穴道人那样，“过来!”
It's been my experience the athletic-type girl like Higgins might go for the caveman approach like this, "Come here!"

634
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,667
哇!
Wham!

635
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,208
粗暴对待她，丹尼
Handle her rough, Denny.

636
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,708
粗糙的,是吧?
Rough, huh?

637
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,250
不。不。
No. No.

638
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,625
那你想让我怎么做?
Well, what do you want me to do?

639
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:22,500
先到阳台上去。
First go out on that balcony.

640
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:26,000
让她看看你。那就顺其自然吧。
Let her see you. Then let nature take its course.

641
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,708
表现得若无其事。
Be nonchalant.

642
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:34,542
但我不知道漠不关心之类的东西。
But I don't know about nonchalant and things like that.

643
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,958
喂，坐在栏杆上。
Oi, sit on the rail.

644
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,958
抬头看月亮。
Look up at the moon.

645
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,042
——嗯?
- Hm?

646
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,042
-抬头看月亮。
- Look up at the moon.

647
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,833
好吧。别管月亮了。
Okay. Never mind the moon.

648
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,542
别管月亮了。
Never mind the moon.

649
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:45,750
那就下定决心吧。
Well, make up your mind.

650
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,667
引起她的注意。
Attract her attention.

651
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,500
咳嗽。
Cough.

652
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:57,250
嘘!轻轻地,你酷毙了。
Shh! Softly, you dope.

653
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:02,250
——你好,丹尼!
- Hello, Denny!

654
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:02,250
-你好，希金斯小姐
- Uh, hello, Miss Higgins.

655
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,708
凯瑟琳的名字。
Katherine's the name.

656
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,500
哦,你好,凯瑟琳。
Uh, hello, Katherine.

657
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,333
接下来我要做什么?
What do I do next?

658
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:10,667
你说什么，丹尼?
What did you say, Denny?

659
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,792
我说，我现在该怎么办?
I said, what do I do now..

660
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,792
我的意思是. .

665
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,250
-从树上下来。
- Go get down the tree.

666
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,250
——这棵树?
- The tree?

667
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,917
这棵树。沿着. .
The tree. Go down..

668
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,292
继续。现在别停止。
Go on. Don't stop now.

669
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,500
好!
Well!

670
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,708

是的，Denny。
Yes, it is, Denny.

674
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,583
那是一个很大的月亮，不是吗?

675
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,500
是的，确实是。
Yes, it certainly is.

676
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,500
月亮很可爱。
It's a lovely moon.

677
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,125
这是怎么回事?
How's that?

678
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,208
我说月亮很可爱。
I said it's a lovely moon.

679
00:30:49,292 --> 00:30:51,250
哦,是的。
Oh, yes.

680
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:56,833
你有没有想过，一个美好的夜晚，一个大大的月亮，还有一个女孩，就像…
Did you ever stop to think that a-a lovely night like this and a, and a great big moon and a-a girl like, uh..

681
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,500
对的女孩，丹尼。
The right girl, Denny.

682
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,375
哦,当然。确定。
Oh, sure. Sure.

683
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,417
你怎么知道的，丹尼?
How would you be able to tell, Denny?

684
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,458
哦，我看得出来。
Oh, I could tell.

So what? He's an umpire, ain't he?

903
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:17,875
我猜她是怕我们伤害他的感情。
Guess she's afraid we'll hurt his feelings.

904
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,833
幻灯片!

他看起来就像赢了。

Oh, so sorry. I almost lost my temper, sir.

916

对不起，我不是在跟你说话，笨蛋。
I beg your pardon, but I was not addressing you, stupid.

了灰尘!
Hit the dirt!

925
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,375

00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:25,167

-我说你是个骗子
- And I say you're a liar.

Of all the dirty, rotten, low-down decisions that's the worst I've ever seen!

934
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,250

-你要接吗?

936
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,917
希金斯小姐，你不属于这个领域。
Miss Higgins, you don't belong on this field.

937
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,042
希金斯小姐，裁判总是最清楚的。
Umpires always know best, Miss Higgins.

938
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:43,375
你一整天都打错电话了你，你，你，你这个大贼!
You've been calling them wrong all day you-you-you big burglar, you!

939
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,000
这是非常诽谤的言论，先生。
That's a very libelous remark, sir.

940
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,083
我不需要听这些。

941
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,083
离开球场!
Get off the field!

942
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:48,542
你不能阻止我!
You can't put me off!

943
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:49,917
你可以的，不是吗?

944
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,917
下车。

我不会付钱的，你这个骗子，小偷!
Well, I'm not going to pay it, you crook, you thief!

100美元!
A $100!

949
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:59,417
你别掺和进来!
And you keep out of this!

950
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,625
-嘿，你，我说什么来着?
- Hey, you, what did I say?

951
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,625
——玩球!
- Play ball!

952
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,542
Cert-certainly,先生。

953
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:07,458

你给我闭嘴，不然我把你也轰出去。
Shut up, you, or I'll put you off the field, too.

956
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,125
那正好在盘子上面。
That was right over the plate.

957
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,208
我用泰迪的大棒都够不到。
I couldn't even reach that with Teddy's big stick.

958
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:15,750
你可以用它来匹配你的大头。
Well, you could use it to match that big head of yours.

959
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000

960
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
-你听到了。
- You heard me.

961
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,458
你的耳朵没有重叠。
Your ears don't lap over.

962
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:23,958

你怎么知道?
How do you know?

1219
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:15,792
因为当我俯身去叫醒他时，他拥抱了我，就像这样。
Because when I leaned over to wake him up he embraced me, like this..

不可能是关于棒球的。
It couldn't have been about baseball.

1223

1236
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,417
-我不是故意的。
- I didn't intend to.

1237
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:12,417
-那你为什么这么做?
- Then why did you?

1238
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,500
因为她让可怜的丹尼为她疯狂而她并不怎么在乎他。
Because she's got poor Denny crazy about her and she doesn't care that much about him.

1239
00:59:16,583 --> 00:59:18,000
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

1240
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:20,292
从她吻我的样子。
From the way she kissed me.

1241
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:24,500
你是不是有点糊涂了，伙计?
Say, uh, you're kind of mixed-up, ain't you, fella?

1242
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:27,500
是的。有点。
Yeah. kind of.

1243
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:33,458
——哇。最后。
- Gee. At last.

1244
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:33,458
-终于什么了，丹尼?
- At last what, Denny?

1245
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:36,042
你知道的，凯瑟琳。
Oh, you know, Katherine.

1246
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:36,042
你肯定知道。
You must know.

1247
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:37,875
哦,禁忌,丹尼。
Oh, no-no, Denny.

1248
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:37,875
请。
Please.

1249
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:42,625
说实话，凯瑟琳，从你投出滚地球球到第三球的那一刻起，我就知道那是爱。
Honest, Katherine, from the minute you picked that grounder and threw to third, I-I knew it was love.

1250
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,958
——不,丹尼。
- No, Denny.

1251
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,958
——不是吗?
- No?

1252
00:59:46,042 --> 00:59:49,333
我只是不想让你产生任何不切实际的希望。
I-It's just that I don't want you to build up any false hopes.

1253
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:52,208
我很喜欢你，丹尼，但是…
I like you very much, Denny, but, well..

1254
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:54,625
你是说等赛季结束了再说吧?
Oh, you mean, maybe when the season's over, huh?

1255
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:56,625
还是在我们赢得三角旗之后?
Or after we win the pennant?

1256
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:59,042
好吧，我们到时候再谈。
Well, we'll-we'll talk about it then.

1257
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:00,542
哦,很好。
Oh, good.

1258
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:06,458
丹尼，丹尼，你能帮我个忙吗?
Denny, Denny, will you do me a favor?

1259
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:07,542
嗯,当然。
Well, sure.

1260
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:10,417
你现在就亲我，用力吗?
Will you kiss me right now, hard?

1261
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,292
现在吻你吗?
Kiss you now?

1262
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,292
在这里吗?现在?
Here? Now?

1263
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:14,583
在这里。
Right here.

1264
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:27,208
不够力，是吧?
No kick in it, huh?

1265
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:29,208
不。对不起,丹尼。
No. I'm sorry, Denny.

1266
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,542
我真的很抱歉。
I'm really sorry.

1267
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,042
哦，当然，没关系。
Oh, sure, it's alright.

1268
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,042
我明白了。
I understand.

1269
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:43,958
有时一个人认为一个人是她喜欢的类型，然后突然发现那个人不是她喜欢的类型，而另一个人是她喜欢的类型。
Sometimes a person thinks a person is her type of person, and all of a sudden she finds that-that person's really not her type of person but another one is her type of person.

1270
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:46,417
事情不总是这样的，丹尼。
It doesn't always work that way, Denny.

1271
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,208
-并不总是有效?
- It doesn't always work?

1272
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,208
——唔唔。
- Mm-mmm.

1273
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:57,583
你为什么要监视我?
What are you doing spying on me?

1274
01:00:57,667 --> 01:01:00,083
谁是间谍?
Who's spying?

1275
01:00:57,667 --> 01:01:00,083
我只是在看。
I was just watching.

1276
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:03,083
有些人就是不懂得欣赏。
Some people just never appreciate.

1277
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:10,833
过来,你。
Come here, you.

1278
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:13,417
好了,到这里来。
Well, come here.

1279
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:16,500
吻我。
Kiss me.

1280
01:01:21,792 --> 01:01:23,750
有什么好玩的吗?
Have any kick in it?

1281
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:24,917
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

1282
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,083
好。
Good.

1283
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,833
我开始有点担心了。
I was beginning to worry a little bit.

1284
01:01:46,417 --> 01:01:48,000
你好,雪莉。
Hello, Shirley.

1285
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,000
嗨。
Hi.

1286
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:03,875
丹尼斯，你不该在这么多人面前吻我。
Oh, Dennis, you shouldn't have kissed me in front of all these people.

1287
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,000
看。
Look.

1288
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:17,958
奥布赖恩太太的孩子埃迪怎么了?
Hey, what's wrong with Mrs. O'Briens boy Eddie?

1289
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:20,292
心脏问题。我看像是心脏病。
Heart trouble. It looks like heart trouble to me.

1290
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:26,542
是啊，什么样的爱尔兰小伙子能坐在这里看着小提琴手拉小提琴，fifes开锣，colleens笑得像新婚之夜一样?
Sure, what kind of an Irish lad that can sit here while fiddlers are fiddling, fifes are fifing and colleens smiling like it was their wedding night?

1291
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:29,375
好吧，你应该在空中跳起来撞着你的脚跟!
Well, you should be leaping in the air knocking your heels together!

1292
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:30,667
做着英俊的骄傲。
Doing the handsome proud.

1293
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:30,667
来吧。
Come on.

1294
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,292
——来吧!
- Come on!

1295
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:32,292
——来这里
- This way..

1296
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,292
加油，迈克尔，我的孩子!
Go to it, Michael, me boy!

1297
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:45,833
很好,很好。
Fine, fine.

1298
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:49,167
吉尔胡利家是全爱尔兰最伟大的舞蹈家!
The Gilhulys were the greatest dancers in all Ireland!

1299
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:57,167
这是我叔叔教我的大风之夜的步骤。
This is the step me uncle taught me the night of the big wind.

1300
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,167
现在你知道为什么奥布赖恩夫妇是爱尔兰的第一任国王了吧。
Now you can see why the O'Briens were the first kings of Ireland.

1301
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:09,708
小胡弗，那个奥布莱恩。
Little hoofer, that O'Brien.

1302
01:03:09,792 --> 01:03:11,333
游击手也不错。
Not a bad shortstop, either.

1303
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:14,500
没有他，内场也不会有什么用。
Ah, that infield wouldn't be much good without him.

1304
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:22,542

1348

你哪里吃?
What's eating you?

1349
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,125
哦，好像我不知道似的。
Oh, as if I didn't know.

1350
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,083
我告诉过你，我对凯瑟琳不感兴趣。
Look, I told you, I'm not interested in Katherine.

1351
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:11,917
你有一片空地。
You got a clear field.

1352
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:11,917
她不是我喜欢的类型。
She's not my type.

1353
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,417
她也不是我喜欢的类型。
She's not my type, either.

1354
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,417
算了吧。
Forget it.

1355
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:17,708
当然，我会忘记的，但你不能忘记。
Sure, I'll forget it but you can't forget it.

1356
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:19,958
你为什么不放弃反抗呢，艾德?
Why don't you quit fighting it, Ed?

1357
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:24,458
毕竟，凯瑟琳既漂亮又聪明而且她还很会投球。
After all, Katherine is beautiful and smart-- And she's got a great throwing arm.

1358
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:27,250
伟大的投掷臂?
Great throwing arm?

1359
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:29,500
你只是没有进一步寻找。
You just didn't look any further.

1360
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:32,333
还记得我们看到她在泳池里游泳的那晚吗?
Remember the night we saw her swimming in the pool?

1361
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:34,125
——还记得吗?
- Remember?

1362
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:34,125
——没有。
- No.

1363
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:36,792
“不,”他说。
"No," he says.

1364
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:39,125
穿着金色的游泳衣。
In that gold bathing suit.

1365
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:42,083
嗯. .
Mmm..

1366
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:43,792
嘿,你流口水。
Hey, you're drooling.

1367
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:49,875
是的，但是雪莉是我喜欢的类型。
Yeah, but Shirley 's my type.

1368
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,250
是的，她有点胆小，有点害羞。
Yeah, she's kind of timid and sort of shy.

1369
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:58,125
你真该看看我对她的迷恋。
You should have seen me sweep her off her feet.

1370
01:08:58,208 --> 01:08:59,625
这就是他们喜欢的，粗野的东西。
That's what they like, the rough stuff.

1371
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:01,958
是的,先生。你得粗暴对待他们。
Yes, siree. You got to treat them rough.

1372
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:03,542
穴居人的东西。
Cave man stuff.

1373
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:07,042
是的。他们喜欢穴居人的东西。
Yeah. They like that cave man stuff.

1374
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:14,625
所以她用自己的棍棒打我的头把我甩到她的肩膀上把我带出山洞，进了树林。
So she hits me over the head with her own club slings me over her shoulder carries me out of the cave into the woods.

1375
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:16,042
然后你做了什么?
Then what did you do?

1376
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,708
我不知道。
I don't know.

1377
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,708
我是无意识的。
I was unconscious.

1378
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:20,792
笨蛋，你错过了最精彩的部分。
You dope, you missed the best part of the dream.

1379
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:22,125
你这样认为吗?
You think so?

1380
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,333
——早上好。
- Good morning.

1381
01:09:26,167 --> 01:09:27,333
-你们好，小伙子们。
- Oh, hello, boys.

1382
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,083
你好，洛根先生，你好吗?
Hello, Mr. Lorgan, how are you?

1383
01:09:29,167 --> 01:09:31,417
很好。我想和你谈谈，艾迪。
Fine. I'd like to have a little chat with you, Eddie.

1384
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,083
嘿，我去买份报纸。
Say, I'm gonna get a newspaper.

1385
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,083
我几分钟后回来。
I'll be back in few minutes.

1386
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:35,583
请坐好吗，洛根先生?
Oh, would you have a chair, Mr. Lorgan?

1387
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:37,250
-哦,谢谢。
- Oh, thanks.

1388
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:37,250
-你在想什么?
- What's on your mind?

1389
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:40,583
你知道吗，我喜欢你昨晚在野餐会上的表现。
You know, I liked the way you handled yourself last night at the clambake.

1390
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:42,208
是的，先生，我很喜欢。
Yes, sir, I liked it a lot.

1391
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:45,042
谢谢你，洛根先生，但你想说什么?
Oh, thank you, Mr. Lorgan, but what are you leading up to?

1392
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,458
哦,一份工作。
Oh, a job.

1393
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:51,708
我在考虑开一家咖啡馆专门做马车生意的又大又高档的地方。
I'm thinking of opening up a cafe big, swanky place for the carriage trade.

1394
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:53,958
你知道吗，我很需要你。
You know, I could use you in the show.

1395
01:09:54,042 --> 01:09:56,250
哇，太棒了，但是，丹尼斯呢?
Gee, that's swell, but, uh, what about Dennis?

1396
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:57,708
他是我的搭档。
He's my partner, you know.

1397
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:59,750
我想我们可以解决这个问题。
Oh, I think we can work that out.

1398
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:01,625
好。你要付多少钱?
Good. How much will you pay?

1399
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,583
嗯，你最近得到了很多宣传。
Well, you've been getting a lot of publicity lately.

1400
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:06,583
我可以给你双倍的薪水。
I can double your last Vaudeville salary.

1401
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:08,792
-一言为定。
- It's a deal.

1402
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:08,792
——好。你什么时候能来上班?
- Good. When can you start?

1403
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,083
棒球赛季结束后再说吧。
Well, not until after the baseball season's over.

1404
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:12,458
哦，在那之前不行吗?
Oh, not till then?

1405
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,958
不，你觉得我现在不能走了，是吗?
Oh, no, you don't think I could walk out now, do you?

1406
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:16,875
我们几乎把三角旗收起来了。
We practically got the pennant cinched.

1407
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:19,625
我对棒球不感兴趣。
Well, I'm not interested in baseball.

1408
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:22,708
你看，我有一大群女孩在等着排练。
You see, I got a big chorus of girls waiting ready to start to rehearse.

1409
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:23,917
三十人。
Thirty of them.

1410
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,958
哎呀,30个女孩。
Gee, 30 girls.

1411
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:28,458
是的。一群美女。
Yeah. A bevy of beauties.

1412
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:29,833
很抱歉你来不了。
Well, I'm sorry you can't make it.

1413
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:31,083
哦，等一下。看。
Oh, wait a minute. Look.

1414
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,458
你就不能再等一会儿吗?
Couldn't you hold off for a while?

1415
01:10:32,542 --> 01:10:34,667
棒球赛季差不多结束了。
The baseball season's practically over.

1416
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,292
我告诉你我要怎么做。
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1417
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,833
你要在这里待一段时间吗?
Well, you gonna be in town for a while?

1418
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:39,458
确定。赛季在这里结束。
Sure. The season finishes here.

1419
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:42,625
那你就不能安排晚上出去排练吗?
Well, couldn't you arrange to get away at nights for rehearsals?

1420
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,625
不，不，我不能那么做。
No, no, I couldn't do that.

1421
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,625
那你再谈也没用了。
Well, then there's no use in talking anymore.

1422
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:51,625
-再见，艾迪。
- So long, Eddie.

1423
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:51,625
-等一下!
- Wait a minute!

1424
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:53,333
听着，我会做的，但是…
Look, I'll do it, but..

1425
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:55,333
我会做的，但别声张，好吗?
I'll do it, but keep it quiet, will you?

1426
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,417
哦,当然。我可不想让你惹上麻烦。
Oh, sure. I wouldn't want to get you in a jam.

1427
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,708
我告诉你我会怎么做，我明天打给你。
I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll call you tomorrow.

1428
01:11:00,792 --> 01:11:02,167
我们开始排练的时候通知你。
And let you know when we start rehearsals.

1429
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,083
-是的。
- Yeah.

1430
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,083
—再见。
- So long.

1431
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,083
再见。
So long.

1432
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:08,333
-再见，伙计们。
- So long, fellas.

1433
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:08,333
—再见。
- So long.

1434
01:11:08,417 --> 01:11:09,500
你怎么知道会成功?
How do you know it will work?

1435
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,292
埃迪?
With Eddie?

1436
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:11,292
哦，这很简单。
Oh, it's a cinch.

1437
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:15,042
你看到他的表情了吗，我告诉他会有30个歌舞团女孩，30个?
You just see his face when I told him there were going to be 30 chorus girls, 30 of them?

1438
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:18,250
看看一个女人对一个叫参孙的人做了什么。
Look what one dame did to a guy named Samson.

1439
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,750
他是谁，战士吗?
Who was he, a fighter?

1440
01:11:21,542 --> 01:11:22,625
所以，你看，我都准备好了。
So, you see, I'm all set.

1441
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:25,875
我会把戏裱起来，等这个赛季结束，你就可以上场了。
I'll get the act framed and then when the season's over, you're in.

1442
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:28,958
当然，我每天晚上都得偷偷溜出去。
Of course, I'll have to sneak out every night.

1443
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:31,167
你会帮我掩饰的，是吗?
You'll cover up for me, won't you?

1444
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,042
我还能做什么?
What else can I do?

1445
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,042
我是你的朋友，不是吗?
I'm your pal, ain't I?

1446
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:34,917
好啊!。
Attaboy.

1447
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,542
你不能整晚排练然后第二天再打球，艾迪。
You can't rehearse all night and play ball the next day, Eddie.

1448
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:39,583
只要有几次失误，我们就能失去三角旗。
Why, with a few bad breaks, we can lose the pennant.

1449
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:41,458
别担心了，好吗?
Quit worrying, will you?

1450
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:41,458
我能应付。
I can handle it.

1451
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:42,917
我的身材很好。
I'm in great shape.

1452
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,542
把牛奶递给我，好吗，艾德?
Pass me the milk, will you, Ed?

1453
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:37,208
狼队在与芝加哥队的比赛中继续走下坡路。
"Wolves continue slump in game with Chicago.

1454
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:46,000
"狼队今天又输了一场" "芝加哥队以6-5大胜" "在最后一局一连串安打和三次惊人失误的帮助下"
"The wolves dropped another game today to Chicago "who swept to a 6-5 victory "aided by a flurry of last-inning hits and three startling errors by.."

1455
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,625
游击手埃迪·奥布莱恩!
By shortstop Eddie O'Brien!

1456
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,167
去做吧。读它!
Go ahead. Read it!

1457
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:55,542
他到底怎么了?
What's gotten into him, anyway?

1458
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:58,375
这孩子失去了活力，不协调，没有活力。
The kid's lost his pep, no coordination, no zip.

1459
01:12:58,458 --> 01:12:59,583
他演奏得像个疲惫的老人。
He plays like a tired old man.

1460
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:01,000
啊，他不累。
Ah, he ain't tired.

1461
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,708
他每天晚上都很早睡觉。
He's been hitting the hay early every night.

1462
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,042
事实上，太早了。
In fact, too early.

1463
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:06,042
是的，这对奥布莱恩来说很不寻常。
Yes, that's very unusual for O'Brien.

1464
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,083
-我应该这么说
- I should say so.

1465
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,083
-有东西在折磨他。
- Something's eating him.

1466
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:11,208
其他男孩怎么说?他们有什么想法吗?
Well, what do the other boys say? Have they got any ideas?

1467
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:14,667
不，不完全是。
Well, no, not exactly.

1468
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,167
好吧,来吧。
Well, come on.

1469
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,167
它是什么?
What is it?

1470
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,625
哦,没什么。
Oh, it's nothing.

1471
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,625
没什么。
It's nothing.

1472
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:22,708
听着，伙计们，如果奥布莱恩一直这么消沉下去我们就可以跟他吻别了。
Look, boys, if O'Brien stays in this slump we can kiss the pennant good-bye.

1473
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:26,375
所以，如果你有任何想法，敞开心扉。来吧。
So, if you have any ideas, open up. Come on.

1474
01:13:27,042 --> 01:13:28,125
告诉她,唱片名。
Tell her, Slappy.

1475
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:31,250
它确实有两个角，看到了吗?
Well, uh, it's really got two angles, see?

1476
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:33,250
你，你拿着，一匹赛马。
You, well, you take, like, a racehorse.

1477
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:39,083
他做得很好，每次都赢，但突然，他真的开始四处看了。
He's going great, winning every out but all of a sudden, well, he really starts looking around.

1478
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:41,000
他越来越不安。看到了吗?
He's getting restless. See?

1479
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,917
奥勃良有什么好不安的?
What has O'Brien got to be restless about?

1480
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,125
就像疯婆子说你要带走那匹赛马。
Well, it's like Slappy says you take that racehorse.

1481
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:50,500
当它开始环顾四周时，它看的是另一匹马。
When he starts looking around he's looking at another nag.

1482
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:54,333
是的。头发上系着丝带。
Yeah. With a ribbon in her hair.

1483
01:13:54,417 --> 01:14:01,500
这听起来像是输掉球赛的一个很愚蠢的理由但如果奥布莱恩想追女孩，随他去吧。
That sounds like a pretty silly reason for losing ball games but if O'Brien wants to chase the girls, let him.

1484
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:03,042
阻止他是谁?
Who's stopping him?

1485
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:05,542
只要他按时上班就行。
As long as he keeps decent hours.

1486
01:14:06,958 --> 01:14:09,500
好吗?哦,哦,是的。
Well? Oh, oh, yes.

1487
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:10,958
其他角度。
That other angle.

1488
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:13,708
还有什么在困扰我们的小赛马?
What else is bothering our little racehorse?

1489
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:17,750
——你。
- You.

1490
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:17,750
——我吗?
- Me?

1491
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:21,167
希金斯小姐，你是另一个唠叨鬼。
Miss Higgins, you're the other nag.

1492
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,542
-我是-嗯哼
- I'm the-- - Hm-hmm.

1493
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,042
真的吗?
Really?

1494
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:35,375
所以你想让我跟奥布莱恩比一比这样我们就能赢得锦标，是吗?
Oh, so you want me to play up to O'Brien so we'll win the pennant, is that it?

1495
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:38,208
你能想出更好的理由吗?
Can you think of a better reason?

1496
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,792
不。不，当然不是。
No. No, of course not.

1497
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:44,542
但就我个人而言，我只对他的击球率感兴趣。
But personally, I'm-I'm only interested in his batting average.

1498
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:48,583
听着，乔，我不能整晚排练下午再打球。
Look, Joe, I can't rehearse all night and play ball in the afternoon.

1499
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:49,875
我需要休息。
I need some rest.

1500
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,750
你得找别人，乔。我通过。
You gotta get someone else, Joe. I'm through.

1501
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:53,625
你有一整个星期的时间来休息。
You'll have all next week to rest up.

1502
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:55,750
我不管它对你打球有什么影响!
I don't care what it's doing to your ball-playing!

1503
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:57,042
我得去片场了!
I gotta get this show set!

1504
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:58,542
我还得去打棒球!
And I got to play baseball!

1505
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:00,917
我觉得自己像个让团队失望的跟屁虫，乔。
I feel like a heel letting the team down, Joe.

1506
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,208
那个三角旗对那些人来说意味着额外的钱。
That pennant means extra dough to those guys.

1507
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,958
听着，我不喜欢你这样说话。
Listen, I don't like that kind of talk.

1508
01:15:07,042 --> 01:15:08,917
乔，别威胁我!
Don't threaten me, Joe!

1509
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,708
不!我不下来，今晚不下来，任何晚上都不下来!
No! I'm not coming down, not tonight or any night!

1510
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,083
我觉得需要跟那孩子谈谈。
I think that boy needs a little talking-to.

1511
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:23,250
你好,埃迪。
- Hello, Eddie.

1512
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:23,250
——噢,你好。
- Oh, hiya.

1513
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,750
你急什么呢?
Uh, what's your hurry?

1514
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:26,625
好吧,我累了。
Well, I'm tired.

1515
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:26,625
我要睡觉了。
I'm gonna hit the hay.

1516
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,708
埃迪，等一下。
Eddie, wait a minute.

1517
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:31,083
我们谈一谈，好吗?
Let-let's have a little talk, huh?

1518
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:32,625
只有你和我。
Just you and me.

1519
01:15:32,708 --> 01:15:33,750
来吧,埃迪。
Come on, Eddie.

1520
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:37,583
如果是关于我的击球率那就没什么好谈的了。
Look, if it's about my batting average there's nothing left to talk about.

1521
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,208
所以我才想睡会儿。
That's why I want to get some sleep.

1522
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:41,000
事情就是这样，艾迪。
Well, that's just it, Eddie.

1523
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:43,875
也许你睡得太多了。
M-maybe you're getting too much sleep.

1524
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:46,750
你知道，这也有可能发生。
That can happen, too, you know.

1525
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,833
你看，走这边，艾迪。
You see, it's this way, Eddie.

1526
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:54,208
你就像一匹马，我是说，一匹赛马。
You're, well, you're just like a horse I mean, a racehorse.

1527
01:15:54,292 --> 01:16:02,125
你很紧张，你训练得太好了，突然之间，在你赢得一场比赛之后，你开始环顾四周。
You're all nerves, you're too finely trained and, all of a sudden, after you win a race well, you start looking around.

1528
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:05,833
是吗?我看到的是什么?
Yeah? What am I looking at?

1529
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:08,958
你不知道吗?
Well, don't you know?

1530
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:11,417
我已经很久没当过赛马了。
It's a long time since I've been a racehorse.

1531
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:17,917
不管怎样，艾迪，我想说的是也许你变得焦躁不安了。
Well, anyway, Eddie, what I'm trying to say is that well, maybe you're getting restless.

1532
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:24,083
你应该更放松，出去，尽情发泄，你知道吗?
You should relax more uh, get out and just bust out, you know?

1533
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:26,583
我真的觉得这对你有好处。
I-I really think it might do you some good.

1534
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:32,917
给自己找个女孩，然后逃出去。
Uh, get yourself a girl, maybe and just bust out.

1535
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,333
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

1536
01:16:34,417 --> 01:16:40,542
那我要和哪个女孩一起出去呢?
And, uh, what girl am I gonna bust out with?

1537
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:49,000
我不知道，但是如果你找不到，那就找我吧。
Well, I don't know but well, if you can't find one there-there's always me.

1538
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:51,667
你吗?
You?

1539
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,417
你想跟我约会吗?
You want to go out with me?

1540
01:16:59,042 --> 01:17:01,208
你问我吗?
You're asking me?

1541
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:04,375
这是为了整个团队。
I-i-it's for the team.

1542
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,667
嗯,当然。团队。
Well, sure. The team.

1543
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,042
你的，你的平均击球率。
Your-your batting average, you know.

1544
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,292
确定。我知道。
Sure. I know.

1545
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,875
你一直在犯错。
You-you've been making errors.

1546
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:14,500
-我现在在做吗?
- Am I making one now?

1547
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:14,500
——Unh-unh。
- Unh-unh.

1548
01:17:19,542 --> 01:17:24,542
希金斯小姐你是棒球界最漂亮的经理。
Oh, Miss Higgins you're the prettiest manager in baseball.

1549
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:26,667
你绝对是最漂亮的游击手。
You're certainly the prettiest shortstop.

1550
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:33,292
到现在为止我一直是个界外球但从现在开始就不一样了。
Oh, I've been a foul ball up to now but it's all gonna be different from here in.

1551
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,125
晚安,希金斯。
Goodnight, Miss Higgins.

1552
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,958
埃迪,等待。
Well, Eddie, wait.

1553
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:44,875
你不想逃出来吗?
Don't-don't you want to bust out?

1554
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:47,500
现在，最重要的是赢得那枚三角旗。
Right now, all that counts is winning that pennant.

1555
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,875
改天再约吧。
I'll take a rain check on the other.

1556
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:53,917
我要把那三角旗放在你脚边。
Oh, I'm gonna lay that pennant right at your feet.

1557
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,542
宝贝，等我找到了，我们就能在联盟里的每一个小镇上大显杀力。
Baby, when I do, we're going to bust out in every town in this league.

1558
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:59,750
哦,埃迪。
Oh, Eddie.

1559
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:02,208
你好,埃迪。我希望我没有打扰你。
Hello, Eddie. Well, I hope I'm not intruding.

1560
01:18:02,292 --> 01:18:03,833
晚上好，希金斯小姐。
Good evening, Miss Higgins.

1561
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:05,458
听着，亲爱的，快走，好吗?明天见。
Look, honey, run along, will you? I'll see you tomorrow.

1562
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:08,083
这就是你今晚错过彩排的原因吧?
So, this is why you had to miss the rehearsal tonight, huh?

1563
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:10,042
你不是说你需要休息吗。
I thought you said you needed a rest.

1564
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:12,917
排练吗?
Rehearsal?

1565
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:12,917
他在说什么，艾迪?
What's he talking about, Eddie?

1566
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,417
-她不知道吗?
- Doesn't she know?

1567
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,417
-亲爱的，我明天告诉你。
- Honey, I'll tell you tomorrow.

1568
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,333
过去几周他每晚都在排练。
Why, he's been rehearsing every night for the past couple weeks.

1569
01:18:18,417 --> 01:18:19,875
每天晚上排练吗?
Rehearsing every night?

1570
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:22,042
是的，为了我的表演。
Yes, for a show that I'm putting on.

1571
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:23,750
姑娘们今晚会想你的。
Oh, the girls are gonna miss you tonight.

1572
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:25,500
他们非常需要你，埃迪。
They need you badly, Eddie.

1573
01:18:27,042 --> 01:18:28,417
——女孩们?
- The girls?

1574
01:18:27,042 --> 01:18:28,417
——听,凯瑟琳。
- Listen, Katherine.

1575
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,708
我明天再跟你解释。
I'll explain all this tomorrow.

1576
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:38,792
从现在开始，他们可以拥有他，而球队可以在赛季剩下的时间里没有他。
From now on, they can have him and the team can get along without him for the rest of the season.

1577
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:42,542
就我个人而言，我的余生没有他也可以过得很好。
Personally, I can get along without him for the rest of my life.

1578
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:47,750
我想没有你我也能过得很好，艾迪，从现在开始。
Well, I guess I can get along without you, too, Eddie, from now on.

1579
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:53,458
它开始穿透我的厚脑壳了。
Oh, it's beginning to penetrate my thick skull.

1580
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:55,917
你肯定花了一大笔钱赌狼队输。
You must have bet a big chunk of dough against the Wolves.

1581
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,875
这个小男孩开始变聪明了。
The little boy's beginning to get smart.

1582
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,792
所以你把我当傻瓜耍了?
So you played me for a sucker, huh?

1583
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:03,083
我得保护我的投资。
Well, I had to protect my investment.

1584
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:06,625
我想我没必要告诉你棒球是一场伟大的比赛。
I guess there's no point in me giving you the routine about baseball being a great game.

1585
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,750
我们得保持干净，尤其是为了孩子们。
We gotta keep it clean, especially for the kids.

1586
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:10,500
不。你只是在浪费时间。
No. You'd just be wasting your time.

1587
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,167
我也是这么想的。
That's what I thought.

1588
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,667
来吧!
Come on!

1589
01:21:11,625 --> 01:21:14,417
好了,伙计!在比赛开始前准备一个程序!
Alright, folks! Get a program before the game starts!

1590
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,583
项目!项目!
Programs! Programs!

1591
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:19,833
我们要O ' brien !
We want O'Brien!

1592
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:19,833
我们要O ' brien !
We want O'Brien!

1593
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,083
——声音。
- Louder.

1594
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,083
-我们要找奥布莱恩!
- We want O'Brien!

1595
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:25,167
我们要O ' brien !
We want O'Brien!

1596
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:25,167
我们要O ' brien !
We want O'Brien!

1597
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,792
这才是他们需要的人。
This is the guy they need in there.

1598
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,292
“不。他彻底崩溃了。”
'No. He went all to pieces.'

1599
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:29,750
什么叫全碎了?
What do you mean, all to pieces?

1600
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:32,167
每个人偶尔都有权利经历一次衰退。
Anybody's entitled to a slump once in a while.

1601
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,583
嘿!看!
Hey! Look!

1602
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:36,292
-我们要找奥布莱恩!
- We want O'Brien!

1603
01:21:33,667 --> 01:21:36,292
——声音。
- Louder.

1604
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:40,833
我们要O ' brien !
We want O'Brien!

1605
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:40,833
我们要O ' brien !
We want O'Brien!

1606
01:21:40,917 --> 01:21:43,792
我们要O ' brien !
We want O'Brien!

1607
01:21:40,917 --> 01:21:43,792
我们要O ' brien !
We want O'Brien!

1608
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:46,042
是埃迪·奥布莱恩，伙计们!就在这里!
It's Eddie O'Brien, fellas! Right here!

1609
01:21:48,042 --> 01:21:49,500
为什么不进去玩呢，艾迪?
Why don't get in there and play, Eddie?

1610
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:51,417
没有人问我。
Nobody asked me.

1611
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:53,000
我不能走出去——如果有帮助的话，我们来背你。
I can't walk out-- We'll carry you if it'll do any good.

1612
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:54,042
——是的!
- Yeah!

1613
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:54,042
——是的!
- Yeah!

1614
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:00,750
天啊!
Holy smokes!

1615
01:21:58,667 --> 01:22:00,750
看,这是埃迪。
Look, it's Eddie.

1616
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,792
嘿,埃迪!
Hey, Eddie!

1617
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,792
你知道什么?
What do you know?

1618
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,208
一个男孩,埃迪!
That-a boy, Eddie!

1619
01:22:04,292 --> 01:22:06,000
你打算拿他怎么办，希金斯小姐?
What are you going to do about him, Miss Higgins?

1620
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:07,792
什么都没有。没什么可做的。
Nothing. There's nothing to be done.

1621
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,375
跟他谈谈也无妨。
It wouldn't hurt to talk to him.

1622
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:12,458
迈克，没什么好说的。
Mike, there's nothing to talk about.

1623
01:22:12,542 --> 01:22:14,417
此外，他的身体状况可能根本不适合打球。
Besides, he's probably in no condition to play anyhow.

1624
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,042
你为什么不让他出去看看?
Why don't you put him out there and see?

1625
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:18,583
是啊，比赛开始前我们还有很多时间。
Yeah, we have plenty of time before the game starts.

1626
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,417
不!
No!

1627
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,875
但如果你愿意，你可以和他谈谈。
But you can talk to him if you want to.

1628
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:27,333
埃迪,好啊! !
Attaboy, Eddie!

你们太容易放弃了。

你在说什么?什么20000 ?
What are you talking about? What 20,000?

他们什么事都干得出来。

哦，反正他也会玩的。

给他们老套路怎么样?呕吐吗?
How about giving them the old routine? The gag?

1660

01:24:46,292 --> 01:24:48,000
我想我们已经没什么可做的了。
Well, I guess there's ain't nothing left for us to do.

01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,875
嗯,等。也许他只是昏迷了几分钟。

医生，快打断我。

01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:04,792
他们是这么说的。

1751
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:06,125
我要进去了!
Well, I'm going in there!

1752
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:08,917
天，有那么糟糕吗?
Gee, is it that bad?

1753
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:13,917
下次你打他，好吗?

这个人伤得很重。

现在把门关上，给我出去。
