WOLVES - WORLD'S CHAMPIONS

3
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,581
Hold it, boys. Steady.

4
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:50,560
- That's it. All right for you, Pete?
- Sure.

5
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,562
Change clothes and get back to work.

6
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:55,253
- Make it snappy.
- Mike, what have you got for us?

7
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:59,427
We have the same line up as last year.
Taylor behind the bat, Gordon on third.

8
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:01,402
Goldberg! Douse that heater!

9
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:07,302
We have that old double play combination:
O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg.

10
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,178
Maybe.

11
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,109
You've got Goldberg, but I'm told O'Brien
and Ryan ain't showing up this year.

12
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:13,283
Don't make me laugh.

13
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:16,384
Tell your readers that they're
on their way here this minute.

14
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:19,546
They've been working out all winter
and they're in the pink.

15
00:02:19,746 --> 00:02:21,487
Okay. Thanks, fellas.

16
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:23,526
Did you hear from them?

17
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,524
I've sent them 10 telegrams,
and they ain't answered one.

18
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:28,757
Here's one they'll answer. Where are they?

19
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:30,629
They're in Pottstown, Illinois.

20
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,202
Pottstown, Illinois?

21
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,529
Get a pencil and paper. Write this down.

22
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,970
"O'Brien and Ryan, Pottstown, Illinois.

23
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,838
"Who do you guys think you are?" Stop.

24
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:44,704
"Get your fannies on the first train
to Florida or I'll throw you out of baseball!"

25
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:46,942
Wait a minute, make a change there.

26
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:48,707
Just say...

27
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,620
..."Please, fellas, we need you."

28
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,024
IN PERSON - O'BRIEN & RYAN

30
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:59,290
"Nelly Kelly loved baseball games

31
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:02,721
"Knew the players, knew all their names

32
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:06,800
"You could see her there every day
Shout 'Hurray! '

33
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:08,799
"When they'd play

34

"Her boyfriend by the name of Joe

36
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,807
"Then Nelly started to fret and pout

37
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,682

46
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,743
- You wanna chase them all home?
- Yeah, we wanna.

47
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:11,856
Why don't you stop stealing bows?

48
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:14,030
Why don't you mind your own business?

49
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,562
- You bonehead. I got a notion to...
- To what?

50
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:18,429
Denny, cut it out, will you?

51
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,240
You big lug!

52
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,135
Now wait a minute, Eddie.

53
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:28,578
Wake up, kid. We're in a hurry.

54
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:30,211
- What happened?
- Nothing.

55
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:31,648
This happens all the time.

56
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:35,045
Every once in a while he gets illusions.
He thinks he has muscles.

57
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,319
Are you pulling out?

58
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,615
Yeah. We've got to catch a train.
We're joining the ball club in Florida.

59
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,427
Goodbye, baby doll.

60
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,229
- See you next season
- 'Bye.

61
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,798
Lucky punch, that's what it was.

62
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:02,609
How many times have I told you
to pick on somebody your size?

63
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,542
There ain't nobody my size!

64
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,776
I could have knocked the big lug for a loop.

65
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:10,553
- But I didn't want to hurt my hands.
- Sure.

66
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:13,984
You don't want me to show up at training
with a busted hand, do you?

67
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:15,888
You save these pictures, don't you?

68
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:17,949
For the kids at the park, yeah.

69
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:19,750
That's me.

70
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:23,098
I'd sooner have my picture
in front of a theatre.

71
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:25,259
You and your show business.

72
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:30,135
It's gonna be great to get back
in that old ball game again.

73
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,235
I can hear the umps now.

74
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,910
"Batteries for today...

75
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,305
"...Rube Waddell and R. C. Schrick."

76
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,246
- Kind of chokes you up, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it chokes me.

77
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,350
When I think of all the dames I lost
because I had to be in bed by 10:00.

78
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,617
Play a lot of checkers by 10:00.

79
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:50,318
No, sir, brother.
Give me vaudeville anytime.

80
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,625
And maybe a musical show. 50 girls.

81
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:57,023
Maybe even 100 girls. Oh, boy!

82
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:00,632
I suppose it would be more fun
than playing checkers.

83
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:01,804
You suppose?

84
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,972
You know, Denny...

85
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,640
...you're getting old enough to find out.

86
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,673
To tell you the truth, Ed...

87
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:13,011
...lately, I have been thinking a lot
about romance and about girls.

88
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:14,173
No!

89
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:15,509
Yeah.

90
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:26,125
- They smiled at us. Let's go talk to them.
- We don't even know them.

91
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:30,262
But I feel like talking.
I'm a very sociable fellow.

92
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,325
Let's go talk to those fellows over there.

93
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:38,063
It ain't the same.

94

SARASOTA BASEBALL PARK

95
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,288
- Drop our stuff at the hotel, will you?
- Yes, Mr. O'Brien.

96
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,956
Look who's here! How are you?
How you doing, kids?

97
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:56,592
Win a pennant again this season?

98
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:59,124
- How's the throwing arm?
- You got any pictures?

99
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:03,140
- There's the guy with pictures.
- Got thousands of them. There you are.

100
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:07,967
What a sight.

101
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:11,173
You got to admit, it's a great thrill.

102
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:12,798
Who's knocking it?

103
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,772
Kind of warm feeling comes over you,
doesn't it?

104
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,780
It happens to me every spring.

105
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:29,188
PLAYERS ENTRANCE

106
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,908
Ryan! How are you?

107
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,906
- Good to see you. O'Brien!
- How you doing, Slappy?

108
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:50,104
Goldberg!

109
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:53,848
Eddie! Dennis! How are you?

110
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:55,611
How you been?

111
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,124
What about your vaudeville tour?

112
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:03,690
It was great.
We worked every town in the USA.

113
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,284
But we didn't work hard.
We had time for play.

114
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:09,297
The art shows, the birdwalks,
the museums were nice.

115
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:13,767
Tell them about the girls!
The quail! The mice!

116
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,238
The mice!

117
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:17,201
Yeah, the girls.

00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:12,221
"Yes, indeedy

160
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,754
"I thought I'd try to kiss her,
but she slapped my face!

161
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:25,661
"I kissed a gal down in Mississippi

162
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:29,060
"A Southern belle name of Emmy Joe"

163
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:30,804
That was her name?

164
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,433
"I thought for once love had got me dippy

165
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:38,071
"She called me 'Lucky Seven'

166
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:40,740
"Said my kisses were from heaven

167
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:45,248
"Then I learned she was 11
And I had to go

168
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,589
"Yes, indeedy

169
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:51,249
"Yes, indeedy

170
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:53,895
"Yes, indeedy

171
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:58,767
"Her age was just 11
So he had to go

172
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:00,329
"Yes, indeed

173
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:01,938
"Yes, indeedy

174
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,936
"Yes, indeed
The boys made hay

175
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:06,569
"Yes, indeed

176
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:08,010
"Yes, indeedy

177
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,270
"We're hot as electric wires
Twice as hot as forest fires

178
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,508
"And the biggest pair of liars!"

179
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:15,276
Liars?

180
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,916
What the hay?

181
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:23,119
"We're the biggest pair of liars
in the USA"

182
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,699
Gilhuly!

183
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:35,302
- How are you?
- Hiya, Mike. How are you?

184
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:36,739
What's ailing him?

185
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,839
I've got some bad news for you.

186
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,432
This just came.

187
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:45,570
"From the law office of Hergesheimer,
Hergesheimer, Hergesheimer, Herge..."

188
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,548
Never mind the batting order.

189
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:48,684
"Gentlemen...

190
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:52,911
"...this will inform you that according
to the will of Colonel J. B. Newhouse...

191
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:56,048
"...former owner of the baseball club
known as the Wolves...

192
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:58,494
"...all rights and interests in said club...

193
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,289
"...have been bequeathed to the late
Colonel's young and distant relative...

194
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:04,000
"...one K. C. Higgins...

195
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,727
"...who will arrive in Florida
on the 10th instant to assert ownership...

196
00:13:07,927 --> 00:13:11,330
"...and actively participate
in the management of said club."

197
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:15,578
- Who's K. C. Higgins?
- He'll probably want to pitch.

198
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,713
We got to take orders from a dopey kid
who never swung a bat?

199
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,383
- Looks that way.
- Not to me!

200
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,252
I don't know about you,
but I want us to win the pennant.

201
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,955
You don't cop any prize money
finishing in last place.

202
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:29,613
This happened to Baltimore once.
They had to dig them out of the cellar.

203
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:32,304
- Lf this guy opens his trap, I quit!
- So do I!

204
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,794
Wait a minute. Quiet.

205
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,201
Wait a minute now.

206
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,801
How about a little fair play here, boys?

207
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,162
You guys don't even know this Higgins.

208
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:45,441
Now here's what I say.

209
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:49,245
He's gonna arrive here Sunday morning.
Until then, let's keep an open mind.

210
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:52,141
Above all, let's not judge him too hastily.

211
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:53,476
The little rat!

212
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,210
You take the back end.

213
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:03,649
Are you Mr. Higgins?

214
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:07,561
K. C. Higgins?

215
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:11,259
- Higgins?
- No.

216
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,425
Good.

217
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,234
- Are either of you Higgins?
- No.

218
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,939
- I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

219
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:23,740
I never did have any sense of direction,
Miss...

220
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,968
- K. C., Miss Higgins.
- Thank you.

221
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,579
You're welcome.

222
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:30,144
Florida Palms Hotel, please.

223
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,215
K. C. Higgins!

224
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,681
He's a girl!

225
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,207
Miss?

226
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,075
Are you looking for someone?

227
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:56,574
Yes, I am. Michael Gilhuly,
he's the manager of the Wolves.

228
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,276
Could you point him out to me?

229
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:03,079
Lt'd be an awful long point.
He's down at the railroad station.

230
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:04,987
He went to meet the 12:10.

231
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:08,213
That's the train I came in on.
I must have missed him.

232
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,383
I wonder how he missed you.

233
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:14,791
Mike ought to be along very soon.

234
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:17,559
Where are your manners?
Give the lady your seat.

235
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,828
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Won't you sit down?

236
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:21,704
One of our very nicest chairs.

237
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,506
Go read your funny papers, kid.

238
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,697
Mike's in a nasty temper this morning.

239
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:27,276
Boy, is he mad!

240
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,205
What seems to be the trouble?

241
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:31,908
He's gone to get the new owner
of the club.

242
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:33,243
Is that bad?

243
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:34,282
Bad?

244
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:38,995
On the trip down, you didn't run into
a little fathead named Higgins, did you?

245
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,146
A little fathead?

246
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,427
Some, lamebrain from Providence,
Rhode Island.

247
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:46,117
Excuse me, but I'd better...

248
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:49,653
You better wait until Mike cools off.
Now, look, baby doll...

249
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:51,823
Just put yourself in my hands.

250
00:15:53,736 --> 00:15:57,172
Fast worker, that boy.
Just met her, and he's rounding third.

251
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,575
It's a sad situation, miss. Picture this.

252
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:02,573
Here we are, the greatest team in baseball,
the champs...

253
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:06,615
...and this little fathead from Providence
will come here and teach us the game.

254
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:09,340
- How do you like that?
- It's very depressing.

255
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,010
Don't ever be a ball player.

256
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,678
I'll try and avoid it.

257
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:16,652
Let's talk about you.
What are you doing tonight after dinner?

258
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,416
I hadn't made any...

259
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:22,718
- After dinner?
- Yeah, how about stepping out a little?

260
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,366
Just the two of us?

261
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:30,195
Aren't you ball players
supposed to be in training?

262
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:31,569
Who, me?

263
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:34,306
- I don't believe in it.
- You don't say!

264
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,669
What time do you usually get in?

265
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,478
We're supposed to be in by 10:00.

266
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:43,913
It's all right for the others,
but I usually get in about midnight.

267
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:46,580
Except, of course,
when I have an extra special date.

268
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,885
Then I get in about 2:00 or 3:00.

269
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:51,985
Tonight I could stay up until 5:00.

270
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:53,421
Really?

271
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:55,725
Won't Mr. Gilhuly get mad?

272
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:59,456
What I always say is,
what the boss doesn't know won't hurt me.

273
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,903
You get it, sister?

274
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:03,437
I get it, brother.

275
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,074
Here he is.

276
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,038
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine,
Miss...

277
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:10,078
Higgins. K. C. Higgins.

278
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:14,250
- I'm afraid I missed you at the station.
- I'm sorry.

279
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,214
That's all right.
We've had a very interesting chat...

280
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:18,810
...Mr. O'Brien and I.

281
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:20,348
Haven't we?

282
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:24,156
We sure have, Miss Higgins.

283
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,989
Just call me "Fathead."

284
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:36,466
Take it easy, now, Eddie.

285
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:38,430
Papa!

286
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:45,122
What's bothering you, Ed?
You swing like a rusty gate.

287
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,449
- He's lost his batting eye.
- Yeah.

288
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,176
Mr. O'Brien, you're stepping in the bucket.

289
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,388
How's that?

290
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,811
I said, "You're stepping in the bucket."

291
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:56,616
Thank you.

292
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,594
Maybe you'd like show me how to do it.

293
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:02,493
If you don't mind.

294
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:03,963
I'd like to.

295
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,556
Slappy, would you get me
the water bucket, please?

296
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:10,334
May I?

297
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,108
You see, here's what's happening.

298
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:16,106
Instead of stepping into the ball, like this...

299
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:18,703
...you're stepping over here...

300
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,914
...and into the bucket.

301
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:24,814
Let me get this straight.

302
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,281
When I stand at the plate, I'm like this.

303
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:31,887
No, I hold it a little higher. Up here.
You see?

304
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:36,822
And while waiting for the pitch,
I wiggle a little bit.

305
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:38,358
Like this.

306
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,595
Just to get myself set.

307
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,065
Yes, I've noticed that.

308
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:45,774
Now, as the ball comes over...

309
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:49,171
...try stepping into it
as you bring the bat back like...

310
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,413
I'm so sorry, Mr. O'Brien.

311
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,546
Would you try it, please?

312
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:01,512
Pitch to him, would you, Joe?
But easy on that arm.

313
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:03,455
Yeah, easy on the arm.

314
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:06,085
Okay.

315
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,054
What a poke!

316
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,563
That's four bases in any ball park!

317
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:18,500
That's the idea, Eddie,
but don't try to kill them all.

318
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,409
You know Charlie Davis of Cincinnati
only hit 279 but he batted in 102 runs.

319
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,374
Why don't you get Charlie Davis?

320
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:26,937
Cut the cracks, Eddie!

321
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:30,649
Mr. Gilhuly, I seem to have
taken over your job.

322
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,686
Not at all, Miss Higgins.

323
00:19:32,886 --> 00:19:35,621
Please forgive me.
I'll see you back at the hotel.

324
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:38,190
Let's get busy! Get around there.

325
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,750
Come on, Dennis.

326
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:47,524
Look out!

327
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:55,866
Ain't that something?

328
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:59,009
She's the kind of girl
I've always dreamed about.

329
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:03,826
Wouldn't it be wonderful to be married
to a girl who played baseball?

330
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:14,158
I remember this time last season,
we were playing Scranton.

331
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,953
Great town!

332
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:19,224
Anyway there's a dame named Maxine
that's kind of sweet on me.

333
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:22,532
A very refined, artistic little chick
with plenty on the ball.

334
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:25,660
- A kootch dancer from the circus.
- That's what I mean.

335
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,743
Goldberg, give me the bread.

336
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:30,112
Anyway, this minx is really warm for me.

337
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,780
One night, she's walking me home
after the show...

338
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,079
...when all of a sudden
I hear a flute playing a kootch dance.

339
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,516
You know like this.

340
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,357
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening.

341
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,597
- Evening, Miss Higgins.
- Hello, Denny.

342
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,130
Sit down.

343
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:00,171
What do you think it is, a formal affair?

344
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,543
Is she gonna eat with us, too?

345
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:06,890
Hey, watch your language, fellows,
and your table manners, too.

346
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,648
She called me Denny.

347
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:16,125
This may not be such a good idea.
You're kind of cramping their style.

348
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:18,492
They're not used to eating with skirts.

349
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,996
I mean, ladies.

350
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,155
The sooner they get used to seeing me
around, the better it will be for all of us.

351
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:26,097
Yes, ma'am.

352
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:29,972
Would someone be so kind
as to pass me the bread, please?

353
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:31,730
- Yes, indeed.
- With pleasure.

354
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,297
Thank you very much.

355
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,438
Mind your manners!

356
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,613
What's the matter?
I had my pinky out, didn't I?

357
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:44,049
Temper, Mr. Zalinka. Temper.

358
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:48,899
Have you boys seen the fashion page
in this week's <i>Vanity Fair?</i>

359
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:53,692
There's the cutest pair of pants
with a peg top and a narrow bottom...

360
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:57,225
...if you'll pardon the expression,
and the sweetest pair of...

361
00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:59,733
Look. We're plastered all over the paper.

362
00:21:59,964 --> 00:22:00,636

- Shall we tell them?
- Shall we?

366
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,172

Sure. Denny, this is it.
If she's a dame, she wants romance.

And she's a dame.
Denny, here's your chance.

...a few tender little nothings
whispered in the moonlight...

First, go out on that balcony.
Let her see you.

474
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:26,239
Then let nature take its course.

475
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,247
Be nonchalant.

476
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:34,077
But I don't know about nonchalant
and things like that.

477
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,021
Sit on the rail, look up at the moon.

478
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,621
Look up at the moon!

479
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:42,864
Never mind the moon.

480
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:44,554
Never mind the moon!

481
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:45,925
Make up your mind.

482
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,865
Attract her attention.

483
00:29:52,073 --> 00:29:53,062
Cough!

484
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,938
Softly, you dope.

485
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,941
Hello, Denny.

486
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,038
Hello, Miss Higgins.

487
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:04,075
Katherine's the name.

488
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:06,952
Hello, Katherine.

489
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:08,615
What do I do next?

490
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:10,923
What did you say, Denny?

491
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:13,517
I said, what do I do...

492
00:30:13,851 --> 00:30:15,397
- Talk to her!
- Say something!

493
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:17,861
- Go down and talk to her.
- How can I get down?

494
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:21,102
- Get down the tree!
- The tree?

495
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:24,635
Go down the tree. Go on. Don't stop now!

496
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:34,839
- Hello, Miss Higgins.
- Katherine.

497
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,042
Katherine.

498
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:39,614
- It's a lovely night, ain't it?
- Yes, it is, Denny.

499
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:42,723
And that's a great big moon, ain't it?

500
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:45,258
Yes, it certainly is. It's a lovely moon.

501
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:46,919
How's that?

502
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:49,092
I said, "It's a lovely moon."

503
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:53,068
Just stopped to think that...

504
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,931
...a lovely night like this
and a great big moon, and a girl like...

505
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:58,595
The right girl, Denny.

506
00:30:58,795 --> 00:30:59,967
Sure.

507
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,940
How would you be able to tell, Denny?

508
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:06,574
I could tell.

509
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,908
Right away?

510
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:13,210
Right from the very first time.

511
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:18,752
"I'll hear heavenly music

512
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:23,992
"I'll hear bells start to chime

513
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,862
"I'll hear thunder

514
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,900
"And I'll be struck with wonder

515
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,536
"But I won't have to look

516
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,544
"A second time

517
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,411
"If her voice is a song

518
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:48,679
"And her walk is a dance

519
00:31:49,357 --> 00:31:51,552
"And if her laugh

520
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,028
"Is warm and free

521
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:58,956
"If I suddenly seem

522
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:02,398
"To be seeing a dream

523
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,239
"She's the right girl for me

524
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,605
"If the glow in her eyes

525
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,448
"And the light in her smile

526
00:32:15,648 --> 00:32:17,745
"Could charm a bird

527
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,877
"Right off a tree

528
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:25,715
"I'll be charmed as a bird

529
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,125
"And I'll know in a word

530
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:34,132
"She's the right girl for me

531
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:42,204
"She'll have a simple, sweet appeal

532
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:47,337
"That wins my affection

533
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:55,413
"She'll be the kind who'll make me feel

534
00:32:57,692 --> 00:33:01,594
"She needs my protection

535
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:07,624
"If the sight of her face

536
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,929
"And the touch of her hand

537
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:15,873
"Can make me happy as can be

538
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:21,505
"If my heart says, 'Come in

539
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,183
"'Darling, where have you been? '

540
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:30,685
"She's the right girl...

541
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,219
"...for me"

542
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,474
That was beautiful, Denny. Beautiful!

543
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:59,375
Miss Higgins, you're wonderful!

544
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:03,088
The way you picked up that grounder
was just wonderful.

545
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:04,923
The kid's all right.

546
00:34:05,123 --> 00:34:07,252
Yes. It's gonna be a gay social season.

547
00:34:07,452 --> 00:34:10,957
There's some little red books in my drawer.
Get me Volume 3.

548
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:12,659
Volume 3.

549
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:16,267
One, three.

550
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:17,972
Give me that.

551
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:21,630
We'll get two other girls.
We'll be a party of six till we get to town.

552
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,677
Then it's every man for himself.

553
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,377
Let's see now: Alice, Stella.
How about Stella?

554
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,146
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Let me see.

555
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:33,886
Jesse Davis,
I think she owned a horse and buggy.

556
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:36,987
I don't think we'll go out tonight.

557
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:38,389
What do you mean?

558
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,852
There's the bag.

559
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:41,326
Hit it hard.

560
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,097
- You're out.
- Got me.

561
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:44,465
See if you can get it.

562
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,292
I'll go to second. I got it.

563
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:47,499
Out.

564
00:34:48,102 --> 00:34:50,271
- Wonderful.
- That's fun, Denny, but...

565
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:52,939
...it is getting late.
I think I'd better be going.

566
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,599
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

567
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,781
Of all the stupid...

568
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:02,584
He's probably coming back
for his baseball bat.

569
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,581
What a spot for a pinch hitter.

570
00:35:04,781 --> 00:35:07,322
Pinch hitter? No, not me.
I'm poison to her.

571
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,322
We've got to get out of here.
The social season. The little red book.

572
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:12,381
Remember?

573
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,497
- That a boy!
- Okay.

574
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,258
She's wonderful! She's beautiful!
Did you see her figure?

575
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,199
Did we see her figure?

576
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:25,405
Wait a minute. What are you gonna do?

577
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,373
Take it up where you left off.

578
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,511
A fine pal he turned out to be!

579
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,408
Come on. Quit worrying!
He's just gonna fix it up for you.

580
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,807
He is? Really?

581
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,518
"If I suddenly seem

582
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,353
"To be seeing a dream

583
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:53,059
"She's the right girl for me"

584
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:56,901
Who is it?

585
00:35:57,705 --> 00:35:59,263
It's me. O'Brien.

586
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,041
May I come up?

587
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,205
I hope you'll pardon me,
Miss Higgins, but I...

588
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:07,907
There's something on my mind and I...

589
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:09,951
Yes?

590
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:12,381
I'd like to apologize...

591
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:14,848
...for everything that's happened.

592
00:36:15,147 --> 00:36:17,592
I've been behaving like an idiot, haven't I?

593
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,123
Yes, you have.

594
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:23,760
I just wanted you to know I was sorry.

595
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:26,100
Fine. Was there anything else?

596
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,700
- What?
- 'Cause it's getting kind of late.

597
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,701
Miss Higgins, don't go in yet.

598
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:31,863
Why not?

599
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:35,607
- Don't spoil it!
- Spoil what?

600
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,912
The whole picture.

601
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,103
The moonlight on the ocean...

602
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,575
...and the garden and the night...

603
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,012
...and you on a balcony.

604
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:49,055
Mr. O'Brien, you're very poetic
for a shortstop.

605
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:51,922
Call me Edward.

606
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,654
Edward.

607
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,920
By the way, what'll I call you?
Miss K. C. Higgins?

608
00:36:58,499 --> 00:36:59,363
No.

609
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,558
What does the "K" stand for?

610
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:03,867
Katherine.

611
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:05,398
That's nice.

612
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,171
What does the "C" stand for?

613
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:09,433
Catherine.

614
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,480
Two Katherines.

615
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,673
They couldn't decide which way to spell it,
so they named you twice.

616
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:19,575
That's right.

617
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,154
- You sure they're talking about me?
- Positive. They're laughing, aren't they?

618
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:29,497
Look, Katherine, Catherine,
we're wasting time.

619
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:32,530
Why don't we go for a stroll on the beach
in the moonlight?

620
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,160
- But don't you think it's a little late?
- No.

621
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,601
Well, I do.

622
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:39,334
How about tomorrow night?

623
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:42,607
Perhaps. But you'd better go now.

624
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:44,136
Okay.

625
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,538
The stairs, please.

626
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:52,645
Goodnight.

627
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:56,855
Goodnight and sweet dreams, baby doll.

628
00:37:58,993 --> 00:38:01,863
Kissing her hand!
The dirty double-crossing rat!

629
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:05,032
Calm down, will you?
He's just kissing her for you.

630
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:08,690
Then what? I suppose she'll kiss him
and he'll come back and kiss me?

631
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,532
I know I won't like it!

632
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,228
Edward.

633
00:38:16,243 --> 00:38:17,073
Yes?

634
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:21,179
You broke training tonight
just to speak to me.

635
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:23,306
You risked a fine.

636
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:25,478
I'd risk my life.

637
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,917
You would?

638
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:29,679
Then I'm sure you won't mind.

639
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:31,116
Mind what?

640
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,953
It's going to cost you $50...

641
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:35,359
...baby doll.

642
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,055
Goodnight.

643
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,794
- He's only trying to help you.
- Looks like he's helping himself!

644
00:38:41,994 --> 00:38:44,269
Wise guy, ain't you?
Trying to beat my time?

645
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:45,406
Forget it, will you?

646
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:47,938
You climbed the wrong balcony
this time, buddy.

647
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:49,909
- Go away.
- Put up your dukes!

648
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:53,811
He walked right into it!

649
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:57,276
Hey, what's all this noise about?
You guys should be in bed!

650
00:38:57,476 --> 00:38:59,552
- What's the matter with him?
- Nothing.

651
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:01,889
They were showing me
their new vaudeville act.

652
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,522
Yeah, the new vaudeville act.

653
00:39:03,722 --> 00:39:06,822
"Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

654
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:11,194
"Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

655
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:15,530
"If thou wilt not be, but sworn my love

656
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:18,701
"And I'll no longer be a Capu..."

657
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,737
Go to bed, Goldberg! And you, too, Juliet!

658
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,447
WOLVES START HEAVY
PRE-SEASON TRAINING

659
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:13,726
WOLVES HEAD FOR HOME
WILL MEET SENATORS IN OPENER

660
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:18,391
TEDDY ROOSEVELT TO ATTEND OPENER

661
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:32,237
All right, boys, that's it. Come on.

662
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,348
What's going on out there, Mike?

663
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,659
The boys like to do a little clowning.
They do it before every game.

664
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,363
The fans eat it up.

665
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:54,335
It looks like the Senators to me,
at the right odds.

666
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,526
- Three to two?
- I'll take $2,000 worth.

667
00:40:56,726 --> 00:40:57,471
You've got it.

668
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:00,765
- Who's that skinny little runt?
- Denny Ryan, the second baseman.

669
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:02,172
He's cute.

670
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:07,539
And so active for a little fellow.

671
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:51,959
Denny!

672
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:54,128
Hiya. Pleased to meet you.

673
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:55,693
My name's Shirley.

674
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:01,569
Didn't you like it?

675
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,294
I don't like to mix clowning with baseball.

676
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,095
Maybe I ought to give up baseball
and stick to clowning.

677
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:12,232
Mr. President, would you mind
posing with this "big stick"?

678
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,141
Delighted.

679
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,855
Get a nice one in there now.

680
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:42,602
- Come on back. Come on back.
- Safe!

681
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:46,671
All right.

682
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:48,526
Send him around now, boys.

683
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:52,479
Strike!

684
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:55,885
- Would you like my opinion?
- Play ball.

685
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:00,961
Strike!

686
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,897
What's the matter? You blind?

687
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:05,531
Keep your eyes open!
Watch them, you robber!

688
00:43:05,731 --> 00:43:07,066
Cut it out, O'Brien!

689
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:09,031
- Cut what out?
- Riding the umpire.

690
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:11,799
Miss Higgins says you're antagonizing him.

691
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:14,061
So what? He's an umpire, ain't he?

692
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:18,143
I guess she's afraid we'll hurt his feelings.

693
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:28,849
Safe! That's the old boy.

694
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:36,628
- He looks like the winning run.
- He's a long way from home.

695
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:43,035
- Strike!
- What? Why?

696
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:45,204
Lay off the umpire!

697
00:43:47,474 --> 00:43:50,443
So sorry. I almost lost my temper, sir.

698
00:43:50,643 --> 00:43:54,548
You'll pardon the suggestion, sir,
but I have a cousin in the optical trade.

699
00:43:54,748 --> 00:43:58,115
He can get you the finest pair
of spectacles wholesale, bifocals, too.

700
00:43:58,315 --> 00:43:59,516
Play ball!

701
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,120
Give that big mouth of yours a rest!

702
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,387
I beg your pardon,
but I was not addressing you, stupid.

703
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:10,564
Ball!

704
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:13,198
Thank you, sir. Even you could see that.

705
00:44:22,276 --> 00:44:23,368
You're out!

706
00:44:26,547 --> 00:44:29,316
- I was safe for a mile!
- And I say you're out!

707
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:31,746
I say you're a liar!
He never even tagged me.

708
00:44:31,946 --> 00:44:35,489
Of all decisions, that's the worst
I've ever seen! You blind robber!

709
00:44:35,689 --> 00:44:38,214
- You going to take that?
- You don't belong here.

710
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:40,021
Umpires always know best!

711
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:43,364
You've been calling them wrong all day,
you big burglar, you!

712
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:45,032
That's a very libelous remark.

713
00:44:45,232 --> 00:44:47,359
I won't listen to that! Get off the field!

714
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,104
- You can't put me off!
- Yes, you can, can't you?

715
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:53,740
- Get off. And you are fined $50.
- I'm not going to pay it, you crook!

716
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,173
- You thief! You robber!
- Don't start anything.

717
00:44:56,373 --> 00:44:58,177
- You burglar!
- Make it $100!

718
00:44:58,377 --> 00:45:00,745
- And you keep out of this!
- Me? What did I say?

719
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:02,111
Play ball!

720
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:03,713
Certainly, sir.

721
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:07,054
Ball!

722
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:09,790
- What!
- Shut up, or I'll put you off the field, too!

723
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,325
That was right over the plate.

724
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:13,686
I couldn't even reach that
with the big stick.

725
00:45:13,886 --> 00:45:16,662
You could use it to match
that big head of yours!

726
00:45:18,365 --> 00:45:19,500
What'd you say?

727
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,759
You heard me. Your ears don't lap over.

728
00:45:21,959 --> 00:45:24,458
Your nose don't either,
but I could arrange it.

729
00:45:26,106 --> 00:45:27,198
Play ball!

730
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,473
Ryan, come back!

731
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:32,912
Wait. What do you want,
to start something, Buddy?

732
00:45:33,112 --> 00:45:34,072
Sure.

733
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:37,173
Cut it out! Break it up! Play ball!

734
00:45:44,057 --> 00:45:45,854
He's hurt. They'll trample him.

735
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:49,155
You're out!

736
00:45:49,396 --> 00:45:50,693
Give him air.

737
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:03,077
There's $3,000.

738
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:06,303
- Better luck next time.
- The season's just started.

739
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:09,010
Look who's here.

740
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,681
Easy now. There.

741
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:16,376
- The poor kid. He's out cold.
- I'll make him come around.

742
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:19,059
I didn't know you was stuck on the guy.

743
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:21,420
Who's stuck on him? I ain't stuck on him.

744
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,690
It's just the mother instinct.

745
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,022
That's what it is, the mother instinct.

746
00:46:26,222 --> 00:46:28,090
Hey, you. Come here.

747
00:46:28,902 --> 00:46:31,029
He's a nice-looking little fellow.

748
00:46:32,024 --> 00:46:35,136
Bring him over to the cafй sometime
if he ever wakes up.

749
00:46:35,336 --> 00:46:36,742
He's waking up now.

750
00:46:38,645 --> 00:46:39,907
Mr. Ryan.

751
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:43,215
What happened? Are you all right?

752
00:46:43,415 --> 00:46:44,682
Who are you, anyway?

753
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:46,480
- She owns him.
- What?

754
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,119
She owns me, too.

755
00:46:48,689 --> 00:46:50,156
Can you do that?

756
00:46:50,924 --> 00:46:52,559
What happened to me?

757
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:53,748
Who are you?

758
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:56,492
She wants to be your mother.

759
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:58,120
She wants to be my...

760
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:01,065
I'll have to take it up with my father.

761
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,363

LEAGUE LEADING WOLVES
ARRIVE HOME TODAY

814
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,380
I want to talk to you.

815
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,708
No, I'm sorry. I'm very busy now.
Why don't she leave me alone?

816
00:51:43,908 --> 00:51:45,817
I got to see you, just for a minute.

817
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,748
I can't now. I'm busy.

818
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:50,079
Denny, why don't you talk to the lady?

819
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:51,091
She ain't a lady.

820
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:55,159
She's been sending me candy and flowers,
she's been writing and phoning me.

821
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,728
What does she want from me?

822
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:00,453
You can't drive a horse up on the sidewalk!

823
00:52:01,168 --> 00:52:02,302
Are you crazy?

824
00:52:02,502 --> 00:52:03,332
Come here!

825
00:52:04,025 --> 00:52:06,506
Why are you running away?
What's wrong with you?

826
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,141
She just wants to mother you.

827
00:52:08,341 --> 00:52:10,210
With a whip in her hand? Are you crazy?

828
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,878
You bad boy, I got a notion
to take you on my knee.

829
00:52:13,078 --> 00:52:16,006
- You mean over your knee, don't you?
- I know what I mean!

830
00:52:16,206 --> 00:52:17,549
What do you want with me?

831
00:52:17,749 --> 00:52:20,381
I got an invitation for you, the whole team.

832
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,055
You, too, I guess.

833
00:52:22,255 --> 00:52:23,457
An invitation to what?

834
00:52:23,657 --> 00:52:26,760
Joe Lorgan's throwing a party
Saturday night after the game...

835
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,054
...down at Gibby's Wharf,
and he wants the whole team to come.

836
00:52:30,254 --> 00:52:31,031
I don't know...

837
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,631
Are you afraid the boys
might enjoy themselves?

838
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:37,602
You'll love it, there'll be beer
and food and music and dancing...

839
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:38,793
...and clams!

840
00:52:38,993 --> 00:52:41,032
A clambake!

841
00:52:41,274 --> 00:52:42,468
Look away!

842
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:44,177
Look away!

843
00:52:44,377 --> 00:52:45,708
Look away!

844
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:48,304

00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:14,654
We're entertaining a bunch of ball players.
I don't get it

895
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:18,722
These boys are a cinch to win. You bet
a big chunk of dough against them.

896
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:20,861
I like the odds. They're 4-to-1.

897
00:56:21,061 --> 00:56:22,528
But they're unbeatable.

898
00:56:22,735 --> 00:56:25,458
So was One Round Delgan
until he was knocked cold.

899
00:56:25,658 --> 00:56:28,990
- That fight was fixed. You yourself...
- You don't say!

900
00:56:34,074 --> 00:56:35,769
You sure need fattening up.

901
00:56:35,969 --> 00:56:37,434
I don't need anything.

902
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:39,913
Bones.

903
00:56:40,113 --> 00:56:42,081
She don't feed you enough, that one.

904
00:56:42,281 --> 00:56:44,241
- What one?
- The one that owns you.

905
00:56:44,451 --> 00:56:46,976
She doesn't own me,
and she feeds me plenty.

906
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,918
Then she ought to change your formula.

907
00:56:51,524 --> 00:56:52,684
Is she your girl?

908
00:56:52,926 --> 00:56:55,360
Yes. No. I mean, I don't know.

909
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:58,131
If I was your girl, you'd know.

910
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,458
Some people just never appreciate.

911
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,267
Appreciate what?

912
00:57:02,869 --> 00:57:04,302
Just appreciate.

913
00:57:06,143 --> 00:57:10,143
You know, come to think of it,
she's really not your type of girl at all.

914
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:13,244
Will you do me a favor,
and don't think about it?

915
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,048
She's wonderful.

916
00:57:15,248 --> 00:57:18,081
Sometimes a person thinks a person
is his type of person.

917
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:22,952
Suddenly, he meets another person who
turns out to be really his type of person.

918
00:57:23,256 --> 00:57:24,655
Do you know what I mean?

919
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:26,589
No. And I don't believe you.

920
00:57:26,826 --> 00:57:29,954
Besides, when the right one comes along,
I'll know.

921
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,195
I'll wait.

922
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:37,127
Say, what's with you and Denny,
or am I too personal?

923
00:57:37,403 --> 00:57:39,098
Yes, you are. Much too.

924
00:57:39,339 --> 00:57:41,534
I have a reason for wanting to know.

925
00:57:41,975 --> 00:57:43,533
A personal reason.

926
00:57:44,511 --> 00:57:46,672
You've been keeping me awake nights.

927
00:57:46,913 --> 00:57:47,914
I have?

928
00:57:48,114 --> 00:57:50,878
You have. Indirectly, of course.

929
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:54,112
Denny talks about you in his sleep.

930
00:57:54,312 --> 00:57:55,744
Keeps waking me up.

931
00:57:59,484 --> 00:58:02,929
Last night, for instance.
All of a sudden he woke up yelling...

932
00:58:03,129 --> 00:58:05,565
..."slide, Katherine, slide."

933
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:07,323
Denny even dreams baseball.

934
00:58:07,523 --> 00:58:09,527
He wasn't dreaming about baseball.

935
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:11,938
How do you know?

936
00:58:12,138 --> 00:58:15,005
Because when I leaned over
to wake him up, he embraced me...

937
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:16,200
...like this...

938
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,767
...and then he kissed me, like this.

939
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,056
You're right.

940
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,312
It couldn't have been about baseball.

941
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,587
That's what I said.

942
00:58:35,787 --> 00:58:37,289
Okay, Eddie, okay.

943
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:40,397
Boy, I got to hand it to you. You win.

944
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,162
Win what, Nat?

945
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:44,371
Nothing, Miss Higgins.

946
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:46,436
Come on, Nat. What is it, tell me?

947
00:58:46,636 --> 00:58:48,303
Something personal between us.

948
00:58:48,503 --> 00:58:51,866
I bet him $1 that I'd kiss you
before the dance was over.

949
00:59:04,699 --> 00:59:07,588
You know something, Eddie?
Sometimes I don't get you.

950
00:59:07,788 --> 00:59:09,262
Sometimes I don't get myself.

951
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,521
- Why'd you tell her?
- I didn't intend to.

952
00:59:11,721 --> 00:59:12,532
Then why did you?

953
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:16,634
Because she's got Denny crazy about her
and she doesn't care that much about him.

954
00:59:16,834 --> 00:59:18,068
How do you know?

955
00:59:18,504 --> 00:59:20,301
From the way she kissed me.

956
00:59:22,175 --> 00:59:24,564
You're kind of mixed up, ain't you, fellow?

957
00:59:26,346 --> 00:59:27,506
Kind of.

958
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,516
- At last.
- At last what, Denny?

959
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,015
You know, Katherine. You must know.

960
00:59:36,422 --> 00:59:37,991
No, Denny, please.

961
00:59:38,191 --> 00:59:41,854
Honest, from the minute you picked up
that grounder and threw to third...

962
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:44,192
...I knew it was love.
- No.

963
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:49,662
It, it's just that I don't want you
to build up any false hopes.

964
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:52,398
I like you very much but, well...

965
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:56,403
You mean, maybe when the season's over?
After we win the pennant?

966
00:59:57,644 --> 00:59:59,874
- We'll talk about it then.
- Good.

967
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:06,446
Will you do me a favor?

968
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:07,720
Sure.

969
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,445
Will you kiss me? Right now. Hard.

970
01:00:10,757 --> 01:00:12,156
Kiss you now?

971
01:00:12,558 --> 01:00:15,049
- Here? Now?
- Right here.

972
01:00:25,505 --> 01:00:26,938
No kick in it?

973
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:30,810
No. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

974
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:33,205
Sure, it's all right. I understand.

975
01:00:33,413 --> 01:00:36,678
Sometimes a person thinks a person
is her type of person...

976
01:00:36,878 --> 01:00:39,010
...and all of a sudden, she finds that...

977
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:43,522
...that person's really not her type,
but another one is her type of person.

978
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,722
It doesn't always work that way, Denny.

979
01:00:46,922 --> 01:00:48,420
It doesn't always work?

980
01:00:56,369 --> 01:01:00,258
- What are you doing spying on me?
- Who's spying? I was just watching.

981
01:01:00,473 --> 01:01:02,805
Some people just never appreciate.

982
01:01:09,882 --> 01:01:11,213
Come here, you.

983
01:01:12,352 --> 01:01:13,751
Well, come here.

984
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,752
Kiss me.

985
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:23,658
Did it have any kick in it?

986
01:01:25,832 --> 01:01:27,129
Good.

987
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:29,665
I was beginning to worry a little bit.

988
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,109
Hello, Shirley.

989
01:01:48,354 --> 01:01:49,321
Hi.

990
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:04,145
Dennis, you shouldn't have kissed me
in front of all these people.

991
01:02:15,825 --> 01:02:18,084
What's wrong
with Mrs. O'Brien's boy, Eddie?

992
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:20,620
Heart trouble.
It looks like heart trouble to me.

993
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,618
What Irish lad could sit
while the fiddlers are fiddling...

994
01:02:23,818 --> 01:02:26,886
...the pipes are piping,
the women are smiling like it's a wedding.

995
01:02:27,086 --> 01:02:31,097
You should be leaping in the air, knocking
your heels, doing a handsome clog.

996
01:02:31,297 --> 01:02:32,662
Come on, get with us!

997
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:45,267
Go to it, Michael, my boy.

998
01:02:45,745 --> 01:02:49,010
The Gilhulys were the greatest dancers
in all Ireland.

999
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:57,918
This is what sent me over Cockney
the night of the Big Wind.

1000
01:03:00,593 --> 01:03:04,222
Now you can see why the O'Briens
were the first kings of Ireland.

1001
01:03:07,983 --> 01:03:11,595
- Good little hoofer, that O'Brien.
- Not a bad shortstop, either.

1002
01:03:11,795 --> 01:03:14,367
That infield wouldn't be much good
without him.

1003
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,413
- Where did you get that hat?
- Where did you get that hat?

1004
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,514
Where did you get that hat?

1005
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:31,484
"'Where did you get that hat? '
Folks ask me every day

1006
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:35,018
"'lsn't it a nifty one? '
You often hear them say

1007
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:38,897
"Put it on, it's funny
Can't you see the people smile

1008
01:03:39,365 --> 01:03:42,334
"It keeps me busy telling them

1034

What a wonderful clambake!

1035
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:02,453
The most wonderful clambake
there ever was!

1036
01:08:02,653 --> 01:08:03,961
Yeah, wonderful.

1037
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,828
What's eating you?

1038
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:07,559
As if I didn't know.

1039
01:08:08,434 --> 01:08:12,063
I told you, I'm not interested in Katherine.
She's not my type.

1040
01:08:12,263 --> 01:08:14,629
She's not my type, either. Forget it.

1041
01:08:14,874 --> 01:08:16,398
Sure, I'll forget it.

1042
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:20,079
But you can't forget it.
Why don't you quit fighting it, Ed?

1043
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:22,577
After all, she's beautiful and she's smart...

1044
01:08:22,777 --> 01:08:24,809
And she's got a great throwing arm.

1045
01:08:26,585 --> 01:08:29,554
Great throwing arm?
You just didn't look any further.

1046
01:08:29,771 --> 01:08:32,549
Remember the night we saw her
swimming in the pool?

1047
01:08:32,749 --> 01:08:33,592
Remember?

1048
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:34,683
No.

1049
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,324
"No," he says.

1050
01:08:37,096 --> 01:08:39,326
In that gold bathing suit.

1051
01:08:42,401 --> 01:08:44,062
You're drooling.

1052
01:08:47,473 --> 01:08:49,634
Yeah, but Shirley's my type.

1053
01:08:50,509 --> 01:08:53,307
Yeah. She's kind of timid and sort of shy.

1054
01:08:54,847 --> 01:08:57,441
You should've seen me sweep her
off her feet.

1055
01:08:58,331 --> 01:09:02,054
That's what they like, the rough stuff.
You got to treat them rough.

1056
01:09:02,254 --> 01:09:03,687
Caveman stuff.

1057
01:09:05,024 --> 01:09:06,889
They like that caveman stuff.

1058
01:09:08,925 --> 01:09:11,297
She hits me over the head
with her own club...

1059
01:09:11,497 --> 01:09:14,989
...slings me over her shoulder,
carries me out of the cave into the woods.

1060
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:16,135
And what'd you do?

1061
01:09:16,335 --> 01:09:18,166
I don't know. I was unconscious.

1062
01:09:18,366 --> 01:09:20,728
You missed the best part of the dream.

1063
01:09:20,973 --> 01:09:22,099
You think so?

1064
01:09:27,974 --> 01:09:29,682
- Mr. Lorgan, how are you?
- Fine.

1065
01:09:29,882 --> 01:09:31,550
I'd like to have a chat with you.

1066
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,275
I'll get a newspaper.
I'll be back in a few minutes.

1067
01:09:34,475 --> 01:09:36,480
Won't you have a chair, Mr. Lorgan?

1068
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,623
What's on your mind?

1069
01:09:37,823 --> 01:09:40,917
I liked the way you handled yourself
last night at the clambake.

1070
01:09:41,117 --> 01:09:42,551
Yes, sir, I liked it a lot.

1071
01:09:42,751 --> 01:09:45,252
Thank you, Mr. Lorgan.
What are you leading up to?

1072
01:09:45,452 --> 01:09:46,320
A job.

1073
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:48,894
I'm thinking of opening up a cafй.

1074
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:51,868
Big, swanky place for the carriage trade.

1075
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:54,073
You know, I could use you as a show.

1076
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:57,731
That's swell, but what about Dennis?
He's my partner, you know.

1077
01:09:57,931 --> 01:10:00,435
- I think we can work that out.
- Good.

1078
01:10:00,817 --> 01:10:01,914
How much will you pay?

1079
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:06,559
You've been getting a lot of publicity.
I can double your last vaudeville salary.

1080
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:08,988
- It's a deal.
- Good. When can you start?

1081
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:11,520
Not until after the baseball season's over.

1082
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,692
Not till then?

1083
01:10:12,892 --> 01:10:15,156
You don't think I could walk out now,
do you?

1084
01:10:15,356 --> 01:10:17,457
We've practically got the pennant cinched.

1085
01:10:17,657 --> 01:10:19,699
I'm not interested in baseball.

1086
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:22,925
I've got a chorus of girls waiting,
ready to start to rehearse.

1087
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,401
Thirty of them.

1088
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:26,668
Thirty girls.

1089
01:10:26,906 --> 01:10:28,305
A bevy of beauties.

1090
01:10:28,575 --> 01:10:30,009
I'm sorry you can't make it.

1091
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:32,745
Wait a minute.
Couldn't you hold off for a while?

1092
01:10:32,945 --> 01:10:34,613
The baseball season's almost over.

1093
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:38,078
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Are you going to be in town for a while?

1094
01:10:38,278 --> 01:10:39,845
Sure. The season finishes here.

1095
01:10:40,045 --> 01:10:43,086
Couldn't you arrange to get away at nights
for rehearsals?

1096
01:10:44,623 --> 01:10:46,022
No. I couldn't do that.

1097
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:48,616
Then there's no use of talking any more.

1098
01:10:49,061 --> 01:10:51,052
- So long, Eddie.
- Wait a minute.

1099
01:10:51,897 --> 01:10:53,432
Look, I'll do it, but...

1100
01:10:53,632 --> 01:10:55,691
I'll do it, but keep it quiet, will you?

1101
01:10:55,891 --> 01:10:58,566
Sure. I wouldn't want to get you in a jam.

1102
01:10:58,766 --> 01:11:02,908
I'll tell you what. I'll call you tomorrow
to tell you when we start rehearsals.

1103
01:11:03,108 --> 01:11:05,042
- So long.
- So long.

1104
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,142
- So long, fellows.
- So long.

1105
01:11:08,342 --> 01:11:11,383
- How do you know it'll work?
- With Eddie? It's a cinch.

1106
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:15,280
Didn't you see his face when I told him
there'd be 30 chorus girls?

1107
01:11:16,076 --> 01:11:18,521
Look what one dame did
to a guy named Samson.

1108
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:20,148
Who was he, a fighter?

1109
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:26,132
I'm all set. I'll get the act framed.
Then when the season's over, you're in.

1110
01:11:26,332 --> 01:11:29,028
Of course,
I'll have to sneak out every night.

1111
01:11:29,268 --> 01:11:31,170
You'll cover up for me, won't you?

1112
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,167
What else can I do? I'm your pal.

1113
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:34,432
That a boy!

1114
01:11:34,632 --> 01:11:37,603
You can't rehearse all night
and play ball the next day.

1115
01:11:37,803 --> 01:11:39,912
A few bad breaks,
we can lose the pennant!

1116
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:43,446
Quit worrying, will you?
I can handle it. I'm in great shape.

1117
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:47,209
WOLVES DEFENDING
PENNANT LEAD AT HOME

1118
01:11:57,696 --> 01:12:00,995
Wolves Lead Dwindles

1119
01:12:15,347 --> 01:12:18,475
Wolves Drop Four Straight

1120
01:12:31,397 --> 01:12:33,666
Pass me the milk, will you, Ray?

1121
01:12:33,866 --> 01:12:36,767
"Wolves continue slump in game
with Chicago.

1122
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,872
"The Wolves dropped
another game today to Chicago...

1123
01:12:40,072 --> 01:12:43,642
"...who swept to a 6-5 victory
aided by a flurry of last inning hits...

1124
01:12:43,842 --> 01:12:46,072
"...and three startling errors by..."

1125
01:12:46,311 --> 01:12:49,212
By shortstop, Eddie O'Brien.
Go ahead, read it.

1126
01:12:54,053 --> 01:12:55,721
What's got into him, anyway?

1127
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:59,892
The kid's lost his pep. No coordination,
no zip. He plays like a tired old man.

1128
01:13:00,092 --> 01:13:04,196
He ain't tired. He's been hitting the hay
early every night. In fact, too early.

1129
01:13:04,396 --> 01:13:07,058
- That's very unusual for O'Brien.
- I should say so.

1130
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:08,463
Something's eating him.

1131
01:13:08,663 --> 01:13:11,469
What do the other boys say?
Have they got any ideas?

1132
01:13:12,671 --> 01:13:14,536
No, not exactly.

1133
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,804
- Come on, what is it?
- It's nothing.

1134
01:13:18,911 --> 01:13:22,813
If O'Brien stays in this slump,
we can kiss the pennant goodbye.

1135
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,742
So if you have any ideas, open up.
Come on.

1136
01:13:27,186 --> 01:13:28,175
Tell her.

1137
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:31,350
It's really got two angles, see?

1138
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:33,325
You take a race horse.

1139
01:13:33,525 --> 01:13:36,061
He's going great, winning every out.

1140
01:13:36,261 --> 01:13:39,059
But, all of a sudden
he starts looking around.

1141
01:13:39,431 --> 01:13:41,133
He's getting restless, see?

1142
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,858
What has O'Brien got to be restless about?

1143
01:13:44,058 --> 01:13:47,835
It's like he says, you take that race horse
when he starts looking around...

1144
01:13:48,035 --> 01:13:49,931
...he's looking at another nag.

1145
01:13:52,144 --> 01:13:54,135
With a ribbon in her hair.

1146
01:13:54,613 --> 01:13:57,980
That sounds like a pretty silly reason
for losing ball games.

1147
01:13:58,383 --> 01:14:01,580
But, if O'Brien wants to chase the girls,
let him.

1148
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:05,119
Who's stopping him?
As long as he keeps decent hours.

1149
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:10,995
Yes, that other angle.

1150
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:14,365
What else is bothering
our little race horse?

1151
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,058
You.

1152
01:14:16,735 --> 01:14:17,759
Me?

1153
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:20,831
You're the other nag.

1154
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:23,669
I'm the...

1155
01:14:26,778 --> 01:14:28,211
Really?

1156
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:35,343
You want me to play up to O'Brien,
so we'll win the pennant, is that it?

1157
01:14:35,587 --> 01:14:37,748
Can you think of a better reason?

1158
01:14:38,423 --> 01:14:40,448
No, of course not.

1159
01:14:41,493 --> 01:14:44,894
Personally, I'm only interested
in his batting average.

1160
01:14:45,735 --> 01:14:49,902
I can't rehearse all night and play ball
in the afternoon. I need some rest.

1161
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:51,865
Get someone else. I'm through.

1162
01:14:52,065 --> 01:14:53,772
You'll have all next week to rest.

1163
01:14:53,972 --> 01:14:57,237
I don't care about your ball playing.
I've got to get this show set.

1164
01:14:57,437 --> 01:15:01,177
And I got to play baseball.
I feel like a heel letting the team down.

1165
01:15:01,377 --> 01:15:03,840
That pennant means extra dough
to those guys.

1166
01:15:04,683 --> 01:15:06,674
I don't like that kind of talk.

1167
01:15:07,186 --> 01:15:08,915
Don't threaten me!

1168
01:15:09,154 --> 01:15:11,884
I'm not coming down,
not tonight or any night.

1169
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:16,150
I think that boy needs a little talking to.

1170
01:15:21,033 --> 01:15:22,295
Hello, Eddie.

1171
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,560
Hiya.

1172
01:15:23,902 --> 01:15:25,028
What's your hurry?

1173
01:15:25,228 --> 01:15:27,230
I'm tired. I'm gonna hit the hay.

1174
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:28,936
Wait a minute.

1175
01:15:29,174 --> 01:15:30,903
Let's have a little talk?

1176
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:32,641
Just you and me?

1177
01:15:32,878 --> 01:15:33,845
Come on.

1178
01:15:34,069 --> 01:15:37,750
If it's about my batting average,
there's nothing left to talk about.

1179
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:39,815
That's why I want to get some sleep.

1180
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:41,284
That's just it.

1181
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,520
Maybe you're getting too much sleep.

1182
01:15:44,189 --> 01:15:46,180
That can happen, too, you know.

1183
01:15:46,858 --> 01:15:48,758
You see, it's this way.

1184
01:15:49,228 --> 01:15:51,526
You're just like a horse.

1185
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,400
I mean, a racehorse.

1186
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,236
You're all nerves.
You're too finely trained...

1187
01:15:57,436 --> 01:16:00,337
...and all of a sudden,
after you win a race, well...

1188
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:02,540
...you start looking around.

1189
01:16:04,876 --> 01:16:06,503
What am I looking at?

1190
01:16:07,346 --> 01:16:08,836
Don't you know?

1191
01:16:09,348 --> 01:16:11,976
It's a long time since I've been a racehorse.

1192
01:16:13,252 --> 01:16:15,948
Anyway, Eddie,
what I'm trying to say is that...

1193
01:16:16,148 --> 01:16:19,548
...maybe you're getting restless.
You should relax more.

1194
01:16:20,525 --> 01:16:23,983
Get out and just bust out. You know?

1195
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:26,797
I really think it might do you some good.

1196
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:30,793
Get yourself a girl, maybe, and just...

1197
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:33,167
...bust out.

1198
01:16:36,141 --> 01:16:38,371
What girl am I gonna...

1199
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:40,804
..."bust out" with?

1200
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,645
I don't know, but...

1201
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,374
...if you can't find one...

1202
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,043
...there's always me.

1203
01:16:50,656 --> 01:16:51,850
You?

1204
01:16:54,993 --> 01:16:56,858
You want to go out with me?

1205
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:01,131
You're asking me?

1206
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:04,328
It's for the team.

1207
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:05,637
Sure, the team.

1208
01:17:05,837 --> 01:17:08,032
Your batting average, you know.

1209
01:17:08,232 --> 01:17:09,308
Sure, I know.

1210
01:17:09,508 --> 01:17:11,499
You've been making errors.

1211
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:14,072
Am I making one now?

1212
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,680
You're the prettiest manager in baseball.

1213
01:17:24,956 --> 01:17:27,424
You're certainly the prettiest shortstop.

1214
01:17:28,593 --> 01:17:31,061
I've been a foul ball up to now...

1215
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,993
...but it's all gonna be different
from here in.

1216
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:41,166
Goodnight, Miss Higgins.

1217
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,771
Eddie, wait.

1218
01:17:43,342 --> 01:17:44,910
Don't you want to bust out?

1219
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:47,840
Right now all that counts
is winning that pennant.

1220
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,074
I'll take a rain check on the other.

1221
01:17:50,274 --> 01:17:53,183
I'm going to lay that pennant
right at your feet.

1222
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:58,197
But, baby, when I do, we're gonna bust out
in every town in this league.

1223
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:01,149
Hello, Eddie.

1224
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:03,954
I hope I'm not intruding.
Good evening, Miss Higgins.

1225
01:18:04,154 --> 01:18:05,826
Run along. I'll see you tomorrow.

1226
01:18:06,026 --> 01:18:08,195
This is why you missed
the rehearsal tonight?

1227
01:18:08,395 --> 01:18:10,257
I thought you said you needed a rest.

1228
01:18:10,457 --> 01:18:13,065
Rehearsal? What's he talking about?

1229
01:18:13,305 --> 01:18:14,606
Doesn't she know?

1230
01:18:14,806 --> 01:18:18,367
He's been rehearsing every night
for the past couple of weeks.

1231
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:19,945
Rehearsing every night?

1232
01:18:20,145 --> 01:18:21,976
For a show that I'm putting on.

1233
01:18:22,381 --> 01:18:25,612
The girls are gonna miss you tonight.
They need you badly.

1234
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:30,516
- The girls?
- Listen, I'll explain all this tomorrow.

1235
01:18:32,357 --> 01:18:34,226
From now on, they can have him.

1236
01:18:34,426 --> 01:18:38,089
And the team can get along without him
for the rest of the season.

1237
01:18:39,164 --> 01:18:42,691
Personally, I can get along without him
for the rest of my life.

1238
01:18:44,503 --> 01:18:47,837
I guess I can get along without you, too,
Eddie, from now on.

1239
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:53,545
It's beginning to penetrate my thick skull.

1240
01:18:53,745 --> 01:18:56,213
You must've bet a lot of money
against the Wolves.

1241
01:18:56,413 --> 01:18:58,681
The little boy's beginning to get smart.

1242
01:18:59,184 --> 01:19:00,852
So you played me for a sucker.

1243
01:19:01,052 --> 01:19:02,781
I had to protect my investment.

1244
01:19:02,981 --> 01:19:05,324
There's no point in giving you the routine...

1245
01:19:05,524 --> 01:19:09,051
...about baseball being a great game,
and keeping it clean for the kids.

1246
01:19:09,251 --> 01:19:12,350
- You'd just be wasting your time.
- That's what I thought.

1247
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:15,861
Come on.

1248
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:25,203
Wolves In Slump As O'Brien Shelved

1249
01:20:40,552 --> 01:20:43,248
PENNANT PLAY-OFF TODAY

1250
01:21:12,017 --> 01:21:15,544
Come on, folks. Get a program
before the game starts. Program.

1251
01:21:15,754 --> 01:21:19,656
We want O'Brien. We want O'Brien.

1252
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:22,125
Louder!

1253
01:21:22,394 --> 01:21:25,124
We want O'Brien!

1254
01:21:25,353 --> 01:21:26,798
This is the guy they need.

1255
01:21:26,998 --> 01:21:28,600
No, he went all to pieces.

1256
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,736
What do you mean all to pieces?
Anybody can have a slump once in a while.

1257
01:21:32,936 --> 01:21:33,964
Look.

1258
01:21:34,172 --> 01:21:35,764
We want O'Brien!

1259
01:21:35,964 --> 01:21:36,703
Louder.

1260
01:21:36,903 --> 01:21:40,871
We want O'Brien! We want O'Brien!

1261
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,414
I knew it was you, Eddie.

1262
01:21:44,614 --> 01:21:47,178
It's O'Brien, fellas. He's sitting right here.

1263
01:21:48,286 --> 01:21:49,651
Get in there and play!

1264
01:21:49,851 --> 01:21:51,189
Nobody asked me.

1265
01:21:51,389 --> 01:21:53,584
We'll carry you if it'll do any good.

1266
01:21:59,397 --> 01:22:01,024
Holy smoke! Look, it's Eddie!

1267
01:22:01,224 --> 01:22:02,394
Hey, Eddie!

1268
01:22:03,468 --> 01:22:04,636
That a boy, Eddie!

1269
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:06,269
What are you going to do?

1270
01:22:06,469 --> 01:22:07,839
There's nothing to be done.

1271
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:09,631
It won't hurt to talk to him.

1272
01:22:09,831 --> 01:22:11,767
Mike, there's nothing to talk about.

1273
01:22:12,777 --> 01:22:14,913
He's probably in no condition to play.

1274
01:22:15,113 --> 01:22:18,776
- Put him out there and see.
- We have plenty of time before the game.

1275
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:19,874
No.

1276
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,652
You can talk to him if you want to.

1277
01:22:25,557 --> 01:22:27,359
That a boy, Eddie! Get in there!

1278
01:22:27,559 --> 01:22:29,891
If he goes in,
we can kiss our $20,000 goodbye.

1279
01:22:30,091 --> 01:22:31,430
You give up too easily.

1280
01:22:31,630 --> 01:22:34,030
What are you talking about?
What $20,000?

1281
01:22:35,233 --> 01:22:38,122
- Have you boys been betting against them?
- Shut up!

1282
01:22:38,336 --> 01:22:40,429
O'Brien mustn't play today, boys.

1283
01:22:45,477 --> 01:22:46,678
- That's it.
- Okay.

1284
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:49,676
A change in the line-up for today's game.

1285
01:22:49,876 --> 01:22:52,306
O'Brien at shortstop for the Wolves.

1286
01:22:58,289 --> 01:22:59,654
Denny, come here.

1287
01:22:59,981 --> 01:23:02,627
- What are you doing here?
- They're gonna get him!

1288
01:23:02,827 --> 01:23:04,930
- Get who?
- Eddie. They're out to get him!

1289
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:07,291
- What?
- I heard Lorgan and his men talking.

1290
01:23:07,491 --> 01:23:09,629
They've bet a lot of money
against the Wolves.

1291
01:23:09,829 --> 01:23:12,101
They're bad luck!
They won't stop at anything!

1292
01:23:12,301 --> 01:23:15,239
- You've got to tell Eddie not to play.
- He'd play anyway.

1293
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:17,365
But you've got to stop him from playing!

1294
01:23:17,565 --> 01:23:19,467
Sure. Stop him from playing.

1295
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,713
Yeah, I'll stop him.

1296
01:23:25,886 --> 01:23:28,442
How about giving them the old routine,
the gag?

1297
01:23:28,642 --> 01:23:30,632
- You got the soft ball?
- Right there.

1298
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:10,488
Come on, let me have it.

1299
01:24:10,695 --> 01:24:12,094
Hurry up. Let me have it.

1300
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:26,272
Fellas, come here. I think he's hurt.

1301
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:27,445
Get a doctor!

1302
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:28,947
Is there a doctor?

1303
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:32,647
- Looks as if our boy was really hurt.
- Yeah. What do you know?

1304
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:35,319
- I'm Dr. Winston.
- Right here, Doc.

1305
01:24:35,519 --> 01:24:37,877
- Open up, boys.
- Here he is, Doctor.

1306
01:24:38,077 --> 01:24:39,886
Better get him to the locker room.

1307
01:24:40,086 --> 01:24:43,181
- Get him up. Take it easy. Go ahead.
- Take it easy, boys.

1308
01:24:46,477 --> 01:24:48,466
There ain't nothing left for us to do.

1309
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:51,889
Maybe he's stunned for a few minutes.
We must keep him out.

1310
01:24:52,804 --> 01:24:56,433
They don't know you. Pretend you're
doctors and keep O'Brien out.

1311
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:57,634
He'll be out, Joe.

1312
01:24:59,744 --> 01:25:01,179
Take it easy now, boys.

1313
01:25:01,379 --> 01:25:04,657
- Put him right down here.
- Careful with him, very careful.

1314
01:25:04,949 --> 01:25:08,043
- Give me room, boys. I'm Dr. Karl.
- I'm Dr. Stevens.

1315
01:25:08,243 --> 01:25:10,485
- How is he?
- It may be a concussion.

1316
01:25:10,685 --> 01:25:11,323
Concussion?

1317
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:14,890
- Get out of here. We'll take care of him.
- Boys, back in the field.

1318
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:17,062
Come on, Miss Higgins. He'll be all right.

1319
01:25:17,262 --> 01:25:19,457
I don't suppose you have
a stethoscope with you?

1320
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:20,759
Just caught me short.

1321
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:23,630
Why don't you run along?
We don't all have to be here.

1322
01:25:23,830 --> 01:25:26,898
Thank you very much.
I would like to see the game.

1323
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:28,699
What is it?

1324
01:25:29,107 --> 01:25:30,442
It's 2:10.

1325
01:25:30,642 --> 01:25:32,371
Run along and enjoy the game.

1326
01:25:32,571 --> 01:25:33,967
That's a nice fellow.

1327
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:37,078
- He's a light sleeper, ain't he?
- Yeah.

1328
01:25:37,482 --> 01:25:38,350
Call it.

1329
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,177
- Heads.
- You win.

1330
01:25:46,524 --> 01:25:47,991
He's safe!

1331
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:26,093
He's safe!

1332
01:26:31,703 --> 01:26:34,467
- How is he?
- They say they may have to operate.

1333
01:26:34,667 --> 01:26:35,506
What?

1334
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:38,943
Denny, what's all this about gamblers?

1335
01:26:39,143 --> 01:26:40,637
- Who told you?
- Shirley did.

1336
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:44,215
Don't you start that!
I know you knocked him out on purpose.

1337
01:26:44,415 --> 01:26:47,441
Look, I was in a spot.
You don't want a dead shortstop, do you?

1338
01:26:47,641 --> 01:26:49,387
Why didn't you call the cops?

1339
01:26:49,587 --> 01:26:51,612
I was scared. Why didn't you tell me?

1340
01:26:51,812 --> 01:26:54,917
How did I know you were gonna bean him
with a hard ball?

1341
01:26:56,964 --> 01:26:58,897
- Have you seen him?
- He's still out.

1342
01:26:59,097 --> 01:27:01,725
The doctors won't let me in.
They're gonna operate.

1343
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:03,892
Operate! In there? That's impossible!

1344
01:27:04,092 --> 01:27:06,746
- That's what they're saying.
- I'm going in there.

1345
01:27:07,505 --> 01:27:08,938
Is it that bad?

1346
01:27:10,651 --> 01:27:14,040
You hit him next time, will you?
My knuckles are getting sore.

1347
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,880
You can't come in here!

1348
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:18,480
- Why not?
- Doctor's orders, and I'm the doctor!

1349
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:22,105
This man's been hurt very bad.
Shut the door and get out of here!

1350
01:27:25,623 --> 01:27:28,456
Those two aren't doctors! Come on, quick.

1351
01:27:34,232 --> 01:27:36,132
You can't come in here!

1352
01:28:00,925 --> 01:28:02,256
He's safe.

1353
01:28:02,588 --> 01:28:03,261
Hold it!

1354
01:28:03,461 --> 01:28:04,519
Hold it! Enough!

1355
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:05,926
He's safe!

1356
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:10,628
There they are, Officer!

1357
01:28:11,788 --> 01:28:13,566
Wait a minute. What's the hurry?

1358
01:28:13,766 --> 01:28:15,299
Stop him somebody! Denny!

1359
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:16,271
Stop him!

1360
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:18,967
Just a second.

1361
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:26,551
I hardly touched him.

1362
01:28:26,751 --> 01:28:28,753
I guess I don't know my own strength.

1363
01:28:28,953 --> 01:28:31,285
- Take him away, fellows.
- Come on, boys.

1364
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,783
All right, play ball! Batter up!

1365
01:28:35,026 --> 01:28:37,859
Get in there and send Goldberg around.

1366
01:28:38,096 --> 01:28:39,586
Just watch me.

1367
01:28:41,966 --> 01:28:44,002
- Slappy, is he still out?
- Yeah.

1368
01:28:44,202 --> 01:28:48,036
I don't think he's seriously hurt,
Miss Higgins. He's merely stunned.

1369
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:49,541
Darling!

1370
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:52,107
Darling, please, look at me!

1371
01:28:52,677 --> 01:28:55,475
Eddie, can you talk? How do you feel?

1372
01:28:55,813 --> 01:28:57,303
I feel fine.

1373
01:28:58,549 --> 01:29:00,016
I feel wonderful.

1374
01:29:00,685 --> 01:29:03,552
Then you just lie right here
and don't you move.

1375
01:29:03,752 --> 01:29:04,889
Who's moving?

1376
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:09,034
Darling, I was so worried when
Dennis hit you on the head with the ball.

1377
01:29:10,628 --> 01:29:11,822
Where is he?

1378
01:29:14,132 --> 01:29:16,225
I'll murder him! I'll kill him!

1379
01:29:17,535 --> 01:29:18,403
Let me go!

1380
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,264
He did it on purpose!

1381
01:29:20,505 --> 01:29:22,234
No, Eddie, he didn't!

1382
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,519
Wait a minute! Hold it!

1383
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,282
Let me at him!

1384
01:29:38,482 --> 01:29:40,925
Let me at him!

1385
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:42,786
Get a hit. You can catch him.

1386
01:29:42,986 --> 01:29:44,725
Yeah! Give me a bat.

1387
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:50,066
I can explain the whole thing.

1388
01:29:52,036 --> 01:29:53,196
Come on, Eddie!

1389
01:30:09,887 --> 01:30:10,945
Eddie, stop!

1390
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:12,554
Eddie, stop!

1391
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:14,590

01:32:07,838 --> 01:32:10,568
"Like a Rotary Club soiree

1417
01:32:11,008 --> 01:32:14,409
"Like Masonic halls or firemen's balls

1418
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,748
"Like honeymooning at Niagara Falls

1419
01:32:18,482 --> 01:32:20,609
"They're really here to stay

1420
01:32:21,185 --> 01:32:26,179
"Cause it's strictly USA"

1421
01:32:37,101 --> 01:32:40,161
THE END
