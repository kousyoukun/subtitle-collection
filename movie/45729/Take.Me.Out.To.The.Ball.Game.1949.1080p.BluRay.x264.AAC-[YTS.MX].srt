00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,858
Hold it, boys.
Steady... that's it.

4
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,443
- Alright for you, Pete?
- Sure.

5
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,087
Alright, boys, change clothes
if you want to...

6
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,463
- But get back to work.
- And make it snappy.

7
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,881
Well, Mike, what have you
got for us?

8
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,216
Well, we're starting
spring training with

9
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,676
the same line-up
as last year's, Taylor

10
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,327
behind the bat
and Gordon on third.

11
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,620
Goldberg, douse that heater.

12
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,456
Yes, sir.

13
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,850
And to round out the infield,
we're having

14
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,154
that old double-play
combination.

15
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,044
- O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg.
- Maybe.

16
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,254
Well, you've got Goldberg
alright, but they tell me.

17
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,732
O'Brien and Ryan
ain't showing up this year.

18
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,341
- What?
- Don't make me laugh.

19
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,901
Listen, you can tell your
readers that O'Brien and Ryan

20
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,485
are on their way
right here this minute.

21
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,155
And what's more, they've been
working out all winter.

22
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,348
- And they're in the pink.
- Sure. Okay.

23
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,766
Thanks, fellas.

24
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,517
What did you hear
from O'Brien and Ryan?

25
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,562
Not a word. I sent 10 telegrams,
and they ain't answered one.

26
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,689
Well, here's one they'll answer.
Where are they?

27
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,524
They're in, uh,
Pottstown, Illinois.

28
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,360
Pottstown, Illinois.

29
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,445
Get a pencil and paper.
Write this down.

30
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,365
O'Brien and Ryan,
Pottstown, Illinois.

31
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,493
Who do you guys
think you are? Stop.

32
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,262
Get your carcass on
the first train to Florida

33
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,680
or I'll throw you both
out of baseball.

34
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,122
- "I'll throw..."
- Wait a minute.

35
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,041
Make a change there, uh...

36
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,502
Just say, uh...

37
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,212

00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,724
- This happens all the time.
- It does?

69
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,791
Yes, every once in a while
he gets illusions.

70
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,936
- He thinks he's got muscles.
- Hey, you're not pulling out?

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,086

We got to catch a train,
we're joining

73
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,547
the ball club in Florida.

74
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,842
- Oh.
- Oh.

75
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,135
Now look... Goodbye, baby doll.

76
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,101
- See you next season!
- Goodbye.

77
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,052
Lucky punch, that's what it was.

78
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,150
Uh-huh, how many times
have I told you

79
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,444
to pick on somebody your size?

80
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,905
There ain't nobody my size.

81
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,912
Why, I could've knocked
the big lug for a loop.

82
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,075
It's just that, well,

83
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,402
I didn't wanna hurt my hands.

84
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,870
Oh, sure.

85
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,556
What, you want me to show up
at spring training

86
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,914
with a busted hand, do you?

87
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,749
Hey, you save these pictures,
don't you?

88
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,960
For the kids at the park, yeah.

89
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,337
Hey, that's me.

90
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,882
I'd sooner have my picture
in front of a theater.

91
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,633
Ah, you and your show business.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,552
Ah.

93
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,119
Gee, it's gonna be great
to get back

94
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,431
in that old ball game again.

95
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,266
I can hear the umps now.

96
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,976
"Batteries for today...

97
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,854
Rube Waddell and Ossee Schreck."

98
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,355
Kind of chokes you up,
doesn't it?

99
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,066
Yeah, it chokes me. Kehhh!

100
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,610
When I think of the dames I lost

101
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,446
because I had to be
in bed by 10 o'clock.

102
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,531
Can play a lot
of checkers by 10 o'clock.

103
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,741
No, sir, brother.

104
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,618
Give me Vaudeville anytime

105
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,036
and maybe a musical show.

106
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,829
Fifty girls. Fifty.

107
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,915
Maybe even a 100 girls, a 100.

108
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,666
Oh, boy.

109
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,461
Gee, I suppose it would be
more fun than playing checkers.

110
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,712
You suppose?

111
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,088
Hey, you know, Denny

112
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,758
you're getting old
enough to find out.

113
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,094
Well, to tell you
the truth, Ed, um

114
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,638
lately, I-I have been thinking

115
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,015
a lot about romance
and about girls.

116
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,142
- No.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,776
Hey, they smiled at
us. Let's go talk to them.

118
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,487
We don't even know them.

119
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,405
But I feel like talking.

120
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,449
I'm a very sociable fellow.

121
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,117
Well, um, let's go talk

122
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,036
to those fellas over there, huh?

123
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,080
Denny...

124
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,207
it ain't the same.

125
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,011
Sam, drop our stuff
at the hotel, will you?

126
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,222
Yes, sir, Mr. O'Brien.

127
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,099
How are you?
How you doin', kids?

128
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,868
You gonna cop another
pennant this season?

129
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,019
- How's your throwing arm?
- You got any pictures?

130
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,506
There's the guy
with the pictures.

131
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,731
Got thousands of them.
There you are.

132
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,154
Gee, what a sight, huh?

133
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,115
Oh, you got to admit,
it's a great thrill.

134
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,950
Who's knocking it?

135
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:15,870
Kind of a warm feeling comes
over you, doesn't it?

136
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,081
Happens to me every spring.

137
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,180
- Denny!
- Eddie!

138
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,439
Hey! Hey, you lugs! Come here!

139
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,983
It's about time!
Ryan, how are you?

140
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,694
- Good to see you...
- O'Brien!

141
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:51,197
- Goldberg!
- Hey, Eddie! Dennis!

142
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,576
How are you? Hey! How you been?

143
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,206
Hey, what about your
Vaudeville tour?

144
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,625
Oh, it was great.
We worked every town in the USA.

145
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,211
But we didn't work hard.
We had time for play.

146
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,881
The art shows, the bird walks,
the museums were nice.

147
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,467
Denny, tell them about the girls

148
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,886
the quails, the mice.

149
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,431

Hey, what's ailing him?

00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,322
I got some bad news
for you, fellas.

234
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,301
- What?
- This just came.

235
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,220
"From the law office
of Hergenscheimer.

236
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,389

237
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,808
Never mind the batting order.

"Gentlemen, this will inform you

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,454

251
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,709
Who's K.C. Higgins?

252
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,627
Whoever he is,
he'll probably wanna pitch.

253
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,230
You mean we gotta take orders
from some

254
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,755
dopey kid who never swang a bat?

255
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,562
- Looks that way.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

256
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,792
I don't know about you fellas

257
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,427
but I want us
to win the pennant.

258
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,054
You don't cop any prize money
finishing last place.

259
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,116
You know, a thing like this
happened to Baltimore once.

260
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,617
They had to dig 'em
out of the cellar.

261
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,435
If this guy opens
his trap, I quit.

262
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,061
So do I!

263
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,357
Wait a second! Wait a second!
Quiet! Quiet. Quiet.

264
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,404
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.
Wait a minute now.

265
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,987
How about a little
fair play here, boys?

266
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,031
You guys don't even
know this Higgins.

267
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,365
Now here's what I say.

268
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,926
He's gonna arrive here
Sunday morning

269
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,119
and until that time,
let's keep an open mind.

270
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,122
And above all, let's not
judge him too hastily...

271
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,790
the little rat.

272
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,210
You take the back end.

273
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,425
You Mr. Higgins?

274
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,179
K-C. Higgins?

275
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,141
- Higgins?
- No.

276
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,434
Good.

277
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,313
- Either of you Higgins?
- No.

278
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,649
- Oh!
- Oh! I'm so sorry...

279
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,443
- That's alright.
- Gosh, I-I...

280
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,250
I-I never did have
any sense of direction.

281
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,197
Miss, uh, K.C...
Uh, Miss Higgins.

282
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,783
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

283
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,702
Florida Palms Hotel, please.

284
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,371
K.C. Higgins!

285
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,663
He's a girl!

286
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,458
Ha ha ha!

287
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,264
Uh, miss...

288
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,724
Are you, uh, looking
for someone?

289
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,227
Well, uh, yes, I am.
Michael Gilhuly.

290
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,062
He's the manager of the Wolves.

291
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,189
Uh, could you point him out
to me, please?

292
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,191
Well, it would be
an awful long point.

293
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,026
He's down at
the railroad station.

294
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,028
- Oh.
- He went to meet the 12:10.

295
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,613
Well, that's the train
I came in on.

296
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,156
Oh, I must have missed him.

297
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,201
Yeah? Well, I wonder
how he missed you.

298
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,663
Mike ought to be
along very soon now.

299
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,039
Denny, where are your manners?

300
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,686
Why don't you give the lady
your seat?

301
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,709
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
Won't you sit down, miss?

302
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,711
One of our very nicest chairs.

303
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,630
Go read your funny papers.

304
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,632
Mike's in a pretty nasty
temper this morning.

305
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,259
- You're not kidding!
- Boy, is he...

306
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,428
Well, uh, what seems
to be the trouble?

307
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,513
He-he's going to get
the new owner of the club.

308
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,516
- Well, i-is that bad?
- Bad? Ho-ho-ho!

309
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,952
Say, by the way,
on the trip down

310
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,310
you didn't run into a fathead

311
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,104
named Higgins, did you?

312
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,565
- A-a little fathead?
- Yeah.

313
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,359
Yeah, some-some lame brain
from Providence, Rhode Island.

314
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,861
Excuse me, but I have...

315
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,707
Yeah, you better wait
until Mike cools off.

316
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:51,451
Now-now, look, baby doll, uh,
just put yourself in my hands.

317
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,162
Fast worker, that boy.

318
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,122
Just met her,
and he's rounding third.

319
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,957
Yeah, it's a sad
situation, miss.

320
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,375
Now, picture this, here we are

321
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,586
the greatest team
in baseball, the champs

322
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,272
and this little fathead
from Providence

323
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,298
is gonna come down here
and teach us the game.

324
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,716
How do you like that?

325
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,243
- Oh, it's very depressing.
- Yeah.

326
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,844
Don't ever be a ballplayer,
miss.

327
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,971
Well, I'll try to avoid it.

328
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,723
Look, uh, let's talk about you.

329
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,725
Uh, what are you doing
tonight after dinner?

330
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,394
Well, I-I hadn't made any...

331
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,896
- After dinner?
- Yeah.

332
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,648
How about stepping out a little?

333
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,734
Just the two of us, huh?

334
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,527
Well...

335
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,946
Aren't you ball players supposed
to be in training?

336
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,908
Training? Who, me? Ha!
I don't believe in it.

337
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,784
- You don't say?
- Nah.

338
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,621
Well, uh, what time do you
usually get in?

339
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,207
Well, uh, we're supposed
to be in by 10 o'clock

340
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,059
but, uh, well, it's alright
for the other fellas

341
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,877
but I usually get in
about midnight.

342
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,421
Oh, except, of course, when
I have an extra-special date.

343
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,633
Then I get in
about, uh, 2:00 or 3:00.

344
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,135
Tonight, I could
stay up till 5:00.

345
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,762
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

346
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,805
Well, won't Mr. Gilhuly get mad?

347
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,390
What I always say is,
what the boss

348
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,892
doesn't know doesn't hurt me.

349
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,311
You get it, sister?

350
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,480
Oh, I get it, brother.

351
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,815
Oh, watch, here he is.
Uh, Mike, how are you, Mike?

352
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,877
I'd like you to meet a friend
of mine, Miss, uh...

353
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,153
Higgins. K.C. Higgins.

354
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,281
I'm afraid I missed you
at the station.

355
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,033
- I'm sorry.
- That's alright.

356
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,037
We've had a very interesting
chat, Mr. O'Brien and I.

357
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,540
- Haven't we?
- Yeah.

358
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,085
We sure have, Miss Higgins.

359
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,128
Just call me fathead.

360
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,680
Take it easy, now, Eddie.

361
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,515
Aw! Pop-up!

362
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,480
What's bothering you, Ed?
You swing like a rusty gate.

363
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,440
- He's lost his batting eye.
- Yeah.

364
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,403
Mr. O'Brien, you're
stepping in the bucket.

365
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,113
- How's that?
- I said...

366
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,489
You're stepping in the bucket.

367
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,825
Oh, thank you.

368
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,786
Maybe you'd like to come over
here and show me how to do it.

369
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:03,040
Well, if you won't mind...
I'd like to.

370
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,835
Uh, Slappy, would you get me
the water bucket, please?

371
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,047
May |?

372
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,091
You see, Mr. O'Brien,
here's what's happening.

373
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,344
Instead of stepping
into the ball like this

374
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:21,058
you're stepping over here
and, uh, into the bucket. Hm?

375
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,102
Now, uh, let me
get this straight.

376
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,565
Uh, when I stand at the plate,
I'm like this, hmm?

377
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,734
No, I hold it
a little higher, up here.

378
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,570
Up here, you see?

379
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,032
And while waiting for the pitch,
I wiggle a little bit.

380
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,783
Like this.

381
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,493
Just to get myself set.

382
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,872
Yes. Yes, I've noticed that.

383
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,832
- Now as the ball comes over...
- Uh-huh?

384
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,752
Try stepping into it as you
bring the bat back like...

385
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,170
Ow!

386
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,716
Sorry, Mr. O'Brien.

387
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,676
Would you try it, please?

388
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,431
Pitch to him, would you, Joe?
But easy on that arm.

389
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,475
Yeah, easy on the arm.

390
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,269
Okay.

391
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,232
Hey! What a poke!

392
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,737
Wow! That's four bases
in any ball park!

393
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,406
That's the idea, Eddie,
but don't try to kill them all.

394
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,534
You know, Charlie Davis
of Cincinnati only hit 279

395
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,745
but he batted in a 102 runs.

396
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,288
Why don't you get Charlie Davis?

397
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,706
Cut the cracks, Eddie.

398
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,166
Oh, Mr. Gilhuly.

399
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,835
I-I seem to have
taken over your job.

400
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,602
Ha! Not at all, Miss Higgins.
Not at all.

401
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,963
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

402
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,465
I'll see you back at the hotel.

403
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,175
Fine. Alright.
Let's get busy in there.

404
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,052
Get around now. Come on, Davis.
You're up.

405
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,539
- Come on.
- Alright, Denny boy...

406
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,017
- Come on. Boys.
- Alright now get a hold of one!

407
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,936
- Hey!
- Hey, look out!

408
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,069
Gee! Ain't that somethin'?

409
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,363
She's the kind of girl
I've always dreamed about.

410
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,300
Wouldn't it be wonderful
to be married

411
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,743
to a girl who played baseball?
Gee!

412
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,311
Yeah, I remember this time
last season

413
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,461
we were playing Scranton.

414
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,089
- Yeah?
- Great town. Great town!

415
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,858
Well, anyway, there's a dame
there named Maxine

416
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,134
who's kind of sweet on me

417
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,261
a very refined,
artistic little chick

418
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,595
with plenty on the ball.

419
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,097
A cooch dancer from the circus.

420
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,932
That's what I mean!

421
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,726
Hey, Goldberg,
give me the bread.

422
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,019
Anyway, this minx
is really warm for me

423
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,731
and one night she's walking me
home after the show.

424
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,984
And all of a sudden, I hear
a flute playing a cooch dance

425
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,402
you know, like this...

426
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,166
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening.

427
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,126
- Evening, Miss Higgins.
- Hello, Denny.

428
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,338
Sit down.

429
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,382
What do you think it is,
a formal affair?

430
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,219
She gonna eat with us, too?

431
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,138
Hey, watch your language, fellas

432
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,639
and your table manners, too.

433
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,810
Gee, she called me Denny.

434
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,540
This may not be such
a good idea, Miss Higgins.

435
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,964
You're kind of cramping
their style.

436
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,486
Yeah. They're not used
to eating with skirts.

437
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,112
I-I mean ladies.

438
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,615
Look, Mike, the sooner they get
used to seeing me around

439
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,176
the better it's going
to be for all of us.

440
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,826
Yes, ma'am.

441
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,871
Uh, would someone be so kind as
to pass me the bread, please?

442
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,623
- Yes, indeed.
- With pleasure.

443
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,957
Thank you.

444
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,753
Mind your manners.

445
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,964
- Shh!
- What's the matter?

446
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,424
I had my pinkie out, didn't I?

447
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,178
Temper, Mr. Zalinka.
Temper, temper!

448
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,930
Have you boys
seen the fashion page

449
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,640
in this week's "Vanity Fair?"

450
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,184
Well, there's
the cutest pair of pants

451
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,228
with a pegged top
and a narrow bottom...

452
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,231
If you'll pardon
the expression, and there's...

453
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,275
Hey, Eddie, look, we're
plastered all over the paper!

454
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,110
- Hey! Pretty nice!
- What's it say?

455
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,112
- Yeah, what's it say?
- What's it say?

456
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,532
- Yeah, what's it say?
- Shall we tell 'em?

457
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,076
- Shall we?
- By all means.

565
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,766
There's one way
we can break training

00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,042
without getting into a jam.

567
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,711
- How's that?
- Take her out on a date.

568
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,798
We'll get two other girls,
and we'll go stepping.

569
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,518
Denny, I've got a hunch
that girl is human.

570
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,799
- No.
- Yes!

571
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,593
And guess who she's crazy about.

572
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,137
- You!
- Me, personally? You think so?

573
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,722
Sure, Denny, this is it.

574
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,474
If she's a dame,
she wants romance.

575
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,771
And she's a dame.
Denny, here's your chance.

576
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,190
A touch of the hand,
a subtle caress

577
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:56,109
a few tender little nothings
whispered in the moonlight.

578
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,612
Aw! Denny, it's up to you.

579
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,781
But I don't know any
tender little nothings, Ed.

580
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,199
It's been my experience

581
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,909
the athletic-type
girl like Higgins

582
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,577
might go
for the caveman approach

583
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,412
like this, "Come here!"

584
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,791
Wham!

585
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,251
Handle her rough, Denny.

586
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,710
<i>Rough, huh'?</i>

587
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,423
No. No.

588
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,859
Well, what do you want me to do?

589
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,718
First go out on that balcony.

590
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:25,013
Let her see you. Then let
nature take its course.

591
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,850
Be nonchalant.

592
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,936
But I don't know
about nonchalant

593
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,730
and things like that.

594
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,109
Oi, sit on the rail.
Look up at the moon.

595
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,153
- Hm?
- Look up at the moon.

596
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,905
Okay. Never mind the moon.

597
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,657
Never mind the moon.

598
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:44,866
Well, make up your mind.

599
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,702
Attract her attention.

600
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:52,541
Cough.

601
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,295
Shh! Softly, you dope.

602
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:01,341
- Hello, Denny!
- Uh, hello, Miss Higgins.

603
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,802
Katherine's the name.

604
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,555
Uh, hello, Katherine.

605
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,390
What do I do next?

606
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:09,808
What did you say, Denny?

607
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,936
I said, what do I do now...
I mean...

608
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,646
Talk to her. Say something.

609
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,666
- Go down and talk to her.
- How can I get there?

610
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,359
- Go get down the tree.
- The tree?

611
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,029
The tree. Go down...

612
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,323
Go on. Don't stop now.

613
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:31,705
Well!

614
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,874
- Hello, Miss Higgins.
- Katherine.

615
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,710
Katherine. It's a lovely night,
ain't it?

616
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,295
Yes, it is, Denny.

617
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,757
And that's a great big moon,
ain't it?

618
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,551
Yes, it certainly is.
It's a lovely moon.

619
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,219
How's that?

620
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,221
I said it's a lovely moon.

621
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,474
Oh, yes.

622
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,185

that a-a lovely night like this

623
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,937
and a, and a great big moon

Oh, sure. Sure.

626
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,444
How would you be able
to tell, Denny?

627
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,489
Oh, I could tell.

628
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:10,118

we're going out tonight.

676
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,704
There's the bag.
Come on now. Hit it hard.

- You're out!
- Got you.

678
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,665
See if you can get it.

679
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,083

Oh, that's fun, Denny

682
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,505

683
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,507

687
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,518

00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,396
Pinch hitter? Oh, no, not me.
I'm poison to her.

689
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,607
We got to get out of here.
The social season.

690
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,109
The little red book, remember?

691
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,530
Attaboy.

692
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,741
She's wonderful!
She's beautiful!

693
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,200
Did you see her figure?

694
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,287
Did we see her figure?

695
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,331
Hey! Wait a minute!
What are you gonna do?

696
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,082
Taking up where you left off!

697
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,628
Fine pal he turned out to be.

698
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,504
Come on. Quit worrying.

699
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,506
He's just gonna fix it up
for you.

700
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,300
He is, Nat? Really?

701
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:49,356
♪ If I suddenly seem
to be seeing a dream ♪

702
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:54,778
♪ She's the right girl for me N'

703
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,488
Who is it?

704
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,281
It's me! O'Brien!

705
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,534
May I come up?

706
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,162
I hope you'll pardon me,
Miss Higgins, but I...

707
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,956
Well, there's something
on my mind, and I...

708
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,792
- Well...
- Yes?

709
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,961
I'd like to apologize
for, uh, well...

710
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,214
For everything
that's happened, I...

711
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,591
I've been behaving like
an idiot, haven't I?

712
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,219
- Yes, you have.
- Mm.

713
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:22,889
Well, I just wanted you
to know I was sorry.

714
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:26,017
- Fine. Was there anything else?
- What?

715
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,727
'Cause it's getting
kind of late.

716
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,562
Oh, Miss Higgins,
don't go in yet.

717
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,023
- Well, why not?
- Well, uh...

718
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,484
- Don't spoil it.
- Spoil what?

719
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,194
Well, uh, the whole picture.

720
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,363
The-the moonlight on the ocean

721
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,782
and the-the garden and the night

722
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,035
and, uh, you on a balcony.

723
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:48,373
Why, Mr. O'Brien, you're very
poetic for a shortstop.

724
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,126
Call me Edward.

725
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,752
Edward.

726
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,254
By the way, uh, what will I

727
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,840
call you, Miss, uh,
K.C. Higgins?

728
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,550
Well, no.

729
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,010
What does the K stand for?

730
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:05,140
- Katherine.
- Katherine? That's nice.

731
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,225
What does the C stand for?

732
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,853
- Catherine.
- Ca...

733
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,604
Two Katherines?

734
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,611
They, uh, couldn't decide
which way to spell it

735
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,191
so they named you twice.

736
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,318
Oh-ho-ho!

737
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,778
That's right.

738
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,465
You sure they're
talking about me, Nat?

739
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,323
Positive. They're
laughing, aren't they?

740
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,533
Yeah. The...

741
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,455
Look, uh, Katherine Catherine,
we're wasting time.

742
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,332
Why don't we go for a stroll on
the beach in the moonlight?

743
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,099
Well, don't you think
it's a little late?

744
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,545
- No.
- Well, I do.

745
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,048
Oh. Well, uh, how about
tomorrow night?

746
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,801
Perhaps, but you'd
better go now, huh?

747
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,094
Okay.

748
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,472
Oh, the stairs, please.

749
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:52,312
Goodnight.

750
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,732
Goodnight and uh,
sweet dreams, baby doll.

751
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,904
Kissing her hand, the dirty
double-crossing rat!

752
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,322
Calm down, will you?

753
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,115
He's just kissing her for you.

754
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,700
Then what,
I suppose she'll kiss him

755
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,535
then he'll come back
and kiss me, huh?

756
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,955
Well, I know I won't
like it. The dirty...

757
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,373
Oh, Edward!

758
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,586
Yes!

759
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:20,465
You broke training tonight
just to speak to me.

760
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,675
You risked a fine.

761
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,427
I'd risk my life.

762
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,471
You would?

763
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,640
Well, then, I'm sure
you won't mind.

764
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,225
Mind what?

765
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:34,813
It's going to cost you
50 bucks, baby doll.

766
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,189
'Goodnight.'

767
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:38,942
He's only trying to help you.

768
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,902
Looks like he's helping himself.

769
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,196
Wise guy, ain't you?
Trying to beat my time, huh!

770
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,132
- Forget her, will you, Denny?
- Forget, my eye!

771
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,716
You climbed the wrong balcony
this time!

772
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,369
- Go away!
- Put up your dukes!

773
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,705
Oh, oh, gee, Denny! Gee, you
walked right into it. I'm...

774
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,249
Hey! What's all this noise
about?

775
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,751
You guys should be in be... Hey!

776
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,854
- What's the matter with him?
- Well, nothin', I...

777
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,878
They were just showing me
their new vaudeville act.

778
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,423
Yeah, the new vaudeville act.
Yeah.

779
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,678
"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore
art thou, Romeo?" Uh...

780
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,431
"Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

781
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:14,561
"If thou wilt not
be but sworn, my love

782
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,730
and I no longer be
a cap... a cap..."

783
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,692
Go to bed, Goldberg,
and you, too, Juliet!

784
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,803
Alright, boys!
That's it! Come on!

785
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,608
What's going on out there, Mike?

786
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,401
Oh, the boys like to do
a little clowning

787
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,779
once in a while.
They do it before every game.

788
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,238
The fans eat it up.

789
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,302
Looks like the Senators to me,
Joe. Got the right odds.

790
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,326
Three to two.

791
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,578
I'll take $2,000 worth.

792
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:56,745
You got it, Nick.

793
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,071
Who's that skinny little runt?

794
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,582
Denny Ryan, the second baseman.

795
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,125
Gee, he's cute.

796
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,214
And so active
for a little fella.

797
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,151
What you doing?

798
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,176
Hey, Denny! Hiya!

799
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,429
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Shirley.

800
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,661
Hey, what's the matter?
Didn't you like it?

801
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,730
I don't like to mix
clowning with baseball.

802
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,273
Maybe I ought
to give up baseball

803
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,358
and stick to clowning.

804
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,737
Mr. President, would you
mind posing with this big stick?

805
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,447
Thank you, sir. Alright, boys.

806
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,323
De-lighted.

807
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,092
Put a nice one in there now.

808
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,892
Get back! Get back!

809
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,977
Safe!

810
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,270
Alright, nice work, Nat.

811
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:46,022
Alright!

812
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:48,357
Hit 'em around now, boys!
Hit 'em around now!

813
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,109
<i>'Come on, boys'!</i>

814
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,320
Strike.

815
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,739
- Would you like my opinion?
- Play ball!

816
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,120
- Strike.
- Hey! What's the matter?

817
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,081
You blind? Keep your eyes open!

818
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,373
Watch them, you robber!

819
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,042
Cut it out, O'Brien.

820
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,877
- Cut what out?
- Riding the umpire.

821
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:11,047
Miss Higgins says
you-you're antagonizing him.

822
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,882
So what? He's an umpire,
ain't he?

823
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,928
Guess she's afraid
we'll hurt his feelings.

824
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,978
Slide that!

825
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,356
Safe! That's the old boy!

826
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,963
- Way to go! Now we're going!
- He looks like the winning run.

827
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,404
It's one out, and he's still
a long way from home.

828
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,241
Man 1: Alright! Hit 'em around
now, boys! Hit 'em around!

829
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,744
- Strike!
- What?

830
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:44,705
O'Brien, lay off the umpire!

831
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:49,919
Oh, so sorry.
I almost lost my temper, sir.

832
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,587
You'll pardon
the suggestion, sir

833
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,631
but I have a cousin
in the optical trade

834
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,558
who can get you the finest
pair of spectacles

835
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,968
wholesale. Bifocals, too.

836
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,762
Play ball!

837
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,990
Yeah, why don't you give that
big mouth of yours a rest?

838
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:05,226
I beg your pardon, but I was not
addressing you, stupid.

839
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,565
- Ball!
- Oh, thank you, sir.

840
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,608
Even you could see that.

841
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,488
Come on! Come on!

842
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,075
Hit the dirt!

843
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,493
- You're out!
- What?

844
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,370
- Boo!
- Boo!

845
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,290
- Boo!
- But I was safe for a mile!

846
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,709
- I say you're out!
- And I say you're a liar.

847
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,836
Of all the dirty, rotten,
low-down decisions

848
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,462
that's the worst I've ever seen!

849
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,607
- You big, blind robber!
- Are you gonna take that?

850
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,276
Miss Higgins, you don't belong
on this field.

851
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,177
Umpires always know best,
Miss Higgins.

852
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,928
You've been calling them
wrong all day

853
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,555
you-you-you big burglar, you!

854
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,223
That's a very
libelous remark, sir.

855
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,285
I don't have to listen to that.
Get off the field!

856
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:47,643
You can't put me off!

857
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,103
Oh, yes, you can, can't you?

858
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,189
Get off. And you're fined $50.

859
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,733
Well, I'm not going to pay it,
you crook, you thief!

860
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,985
- You robber...
- Make it a 100.

861
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,613
A $100!
And you keep out of this!

862
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,740
- Hey, you, what did I say?
- Play ball!

863
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,575
Cert-certainly, sir.

864
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,704
- Ball!
- What?

865
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,791
Shut up, you, or I'll
put you off the field, too.

866
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,416
That was right over the plate.

867
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,543
I couldn't even reach that
with Teddy's big stick.

868
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,754
Well, you could use it to match
that big head of yours.

869
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,091
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

870
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,676
Your ears don't lap over.

871
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,054
Your nose don't either,
but I could arrange it.

872
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,597
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

873
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,098
- Yeah?
- Play ball!

874
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,392
Hey! Hey, Ryan! Come back!

875
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,019
- Yeah!
- Hey, don't...

876
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,747
What do you wanna start
something, buddy?

877
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,522
- Sure!
- Hey!

878
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,983
Knock it off.
Knock it off! Play ball!

879
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,450
He's hurt! They'll trample him!

880
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,744
Jimmy, give me the ball!

881
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,037
You're out!

882
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:50,164
Shirley:
Give him air! He's hurt.

883
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,126
Break it up! Break it up!

884
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:59,131
Alright, boys, the game is over.

885
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,008
Twenty seven, twenty eight,
twenty nine...

886
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,094
- There's 3,000.
- Better luck next time, Joe.

887
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,553
Well, the season's just started.

888
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,557
Well, look who's here!

889
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,726
Easy, now. There.

890
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,437
Poor kid. He's out cold.

891
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,623
Here, I'll make him come around.

892
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:15,690
Why, you!

893
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,875
Gee, I didn't know you were

894
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,192
stuck on the guy.

895
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,236
Who's stuck on him?
I ain't stuck on him.

896
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:22,780
It's just the mother instinct.

897
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,740
That's what it is,
the mother instinct.

898
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,618
<i>Hey, you. Let me have that.</i>

899
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,163
Well, he's a nice-looking
little fella.

900
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,125
Bring him over to the cafe
sometime if he ever wakes up.

901
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,252
He's waking up now. Denny!

902
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,338
- Denny? <i>'</i> MT-Ryan!

903
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,216
Denny, Denny, what happened?
Are you alright?

904
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:43,718
Who are you, anyway?

905
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,469
- She owns him.
- What?

906
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,388
She owns me, too.

907
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,848
Can you do that?

908
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:52,393
What, what happened to me?
Who are you?

909
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,354
- Me? I'm...
- She wants to be your mother.

She wants to be my...

911

00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,311
What, with a whip in her hand?
What are you crazy or something?

979

1055
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,386
So we're entertaining
a bunch of ballplayers.

1056
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,410
Well, I don't get it.

1057
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,745
Another thing I don't get

1058
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,622
these boys are a cinch
to win the pennant.

1059
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,789
You switched and bet
a chunk of dough against them.

1060
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,793
Well I happen to like the odds.
They're 4-to-1.

1061
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,587
- Yeah, but they're unbeatable.
- Yeah.

1062
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,381
So was one-round Doug until he
was knocked cold in the second.

1063
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,317
You know that fight
was fixed! You, yourself...

1064
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,885
You don't say.

1065
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,641
You sure need fattening up.

1066
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,101
Oh, I don't need anything.

1067
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,021
Just bones.

1068
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,772
She don't feed you
enough, that one.

1069
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,150
- What one?
- The one that owns you.

1070
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,361
She doesn't own me,
and she feeds me plenty.

1071
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,113
Then she ought
to change your formula.

1072
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,618
- Is she your girl?
- Yes. No.

1073
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,745
I-I mean, I don't know.

1074
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,122
If I was your girl, you'd know.

1075
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,541
Some people just
never appreciate.

1076
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,918
Appreciate what?

1077
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,045
Oh, just appreciate.

1078
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,715
You know, Dennis,
come to think of it

1079
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,051
she's really not
your type girl at all.

1080
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,471
Look, will you do me a favor
and don't think about it?

1081
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,348
She's wonderful.

1082
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,701
Sometimes a person thinks
a person is his type of person

1083
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,578
and all of a sudden he meets
another type person

1084
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,646
who turns out to be
really his type person.

1085
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,523
You know what I mean?

1086
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,484
No, and I don't believe you.

1087
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:29,696
Beside when, when the right one
comes along, I'll know.

1088
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,948
I'll wait.

1089
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,493
Say, uh, what's with
you and Denny

1090
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,244
or am I too personal?

1091
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,913
Well, yes, you are. Much too.

1092
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,749
Well, I have a reason
for wanting to know

1093
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,167
a personal reason.

1094
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:43,418
Oh?

1095
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,671
You've been
keeping me awake nights.

1096
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,837
I have?

1097
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,090
You have.

1098
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,717
- Indirectly, of course.
- Well...

1099
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,886
Denny talks about you
in his sleep

1100
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,638
keeps waking me up.

1101
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,517
Oh.

1102
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,060
Like last night, for instance.

1103
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:01,895
All of a sudden,
he woke up yelling

1104
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,439
"slide, Katherine, slide."

1105
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,108
Denny even dreams basebaH.

1106
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,486
He wasn't dreaming
about baseball.

1107
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,904
How do you know?

1108
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,711
Because when I leaned over
to wake him up,

1109
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,950
he embraced me, like this...

1110
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,703
and then he kissed me like this.

1111
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:28,880
You're-you're right.

1112
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,841
It couldn't have
been about baseball.

1113
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,386
That's what I said.

1114
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,722
Goldberg: Okay, Eddie, okay.

1115
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,683
Boy, I got to hand it
to you. You win.

1116
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,892
Win what, Nat?

1117
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,186
Oh, uh, nothing, Miss Higgins.

1118
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,063
Come on, Nat.
What is it? Tell me.

1119
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,232
Oh, something personal
between us.

1120
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,235
I bet him a dollar that I'd kiss
you before the dance was over.

1121
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,809
You know something, Eddie?

1122
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,501
Sometimes I don't get you.

1123
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,463
- Sometimes I don't get myself.
- What did you tell her for?

1124
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,590
- I didn't intend to.
- Then why did you?

1125
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:13,508
Because she's got poor Denny
crazy about her

1126
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,552
and she doesn't care
that much about him.

1127
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,137
How do you know?

1128
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,514
From the way she kissed me.

1129
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:23,560
Say, uh, you're kind of
mixed-up, ain't you, fella?

1130
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,605
Yeah. Kind of.

1131
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,611
- Gee. At last.
- At last what, Denny?

1132
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:35,197
Oh, you know, Katherine.
You must know.

1133
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,157
Oh, no-no, Denny. Please.

1134
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,644
Honest, Katherine, from the
minute you picked that grounder

1135
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,745
and threw to third,
I-I knew it was love.

1136
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:45,248
- No, Denny.
- No?

1137
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,502
I-It's just that I don't want
you to build up any false hopes.

1138
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,421
I like you very much,
Denny, but, well...

1139
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,715
Oh, you mean, maybe
when the season's over, huh?

1140
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,801
Or after we win the pennant?

1141
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,095
Well, we'll-we'll
talk about it then.

1142
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,554
Oh, good.

1143
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,519
Denny, Denny,
will you do me a favor?

1144
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,686
Well, sure.

1145
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,564
Will you kiss me
right now, hard?

1146
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,317
Kiss you now? Here? Now?

1147
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:13,610
Right here.

1148
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,331
No kick in it, huh?

1149
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:28,250
No. I'm sorry, Denny.

1150
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,709
I'm really sorry.

1151
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,212
Oh, sure, it's alright.
I understand.

1152
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,047
Sometimes a person
thinks a person

1153
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,174
is her type of person,
and all of a sudden

1154
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:39,427
she finds that-that person's
really not her type of person

1155
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:43,140
but another one
is her type of person.

1156
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,600
It doesn't always
work that way, Denny.

1157
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,227
- It doesn't always work?
- Mm-mmm.

1158
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,736
What are you doing spying on me?

1159
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,281
Who's spying?
I was just watching.

1160
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,117
Some people just
never appreciate.

1161
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,875
Come here, you.

1162
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,419
Well, come here.

1163
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,505
<i>Kiss me.</i>

1164
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,762
Have any kick in it?

1165
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:23,930
Uh-huh.

1166
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,224
Good.

1167
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,871
I was beginning
to worry a little bit.

1168
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:47,037
Hello, Shirley.

1169
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,039
Hi.

1170
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:00,985
Oh, Dennis, you shouldn't
have kissed me

1171
01:02:01,009 --> 01:02:02,886
in front of all these people.

1172
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,095
Look.

1173
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:17,192
Hey, what's wrong with
Mrs. O'Briens boy Eddie?

1174
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,527
Heart trouble. It looks like
heart trouble to me.

1175
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,030
Sure, what kind of an Irish lad
that can sit here

1176
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,957
while fiddlers are fiddling,
fifes are fifing

1177
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,885
and colleens smiling
like it was their wedding night?

1178
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,220
Well, you should be
leaping in the air

1179
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:28,578
knocking your heels together!

1180
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,972
Doing the handsome proud.
Come on.

1181
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,373
- Come on!
- This way...

1182
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,465
Go to it, Michael, me boy!

1183
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,053
Fine, fine.

1184
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,181
The Gilhulys were the greatest
dancers in all Ireland!

1185
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:54,688
This is the step
me uncle taught me

1186
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,189
the night of the big wind.

1187
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,236
Now you can see why the O'Briens

1188
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,196
were the first kings of Ireland.

1189
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:08,868
Little hoofer, that O'Brien.

1190
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,537
Not a bad shortstop, either.

1191
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:13,623
Ah, that infield wouldn't be
much good without him.

1192
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,673
Where did you get that hat?

1193
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,550

What a wonderful night.

1233

What a wonderful clambake.

1234
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,214
The most wonderful
clambake there ever was.

1235
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,121
Yeah. Wonderful.

1236
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:07,333
What's eating you?
Oh, as if I didn't know.

1237
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,395
Look, I told you, I'm not
interested in Katherine.

1238
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,045
You got a clear field.
She's not my type.

1239
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,464
She's not my type, either.
Forget it.

1240
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,383
Sure, I'll forget it

1241
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:16,884
but you can't forget it.

1242
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,137
Why don't you quit
fighting it, Ed?

1243
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:21,389
After all, Katherine
is beautiful and smart...

1244
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:23,474
And she's got
a great throwing arm.

1245
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,519
Great throwing arm, huh?

1246
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,730
You just didn't look
any further.

1247
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,441
Remember the night we saw her
swimming in the pool?

1248
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,151
- Remember?
- No.

1249
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,945
"No," he says.

1250
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,156
In that gold bathing suit.

1251
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:41,200
Mmm...

1252
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,827
Hey, you're drooling.

1253
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:49,125
Yeah, but Shirley's my type.

1254
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,253
Yeah, she's kind of timid
and sort of shy.

1255
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:57,300
You should have seen me
sweep her off her feet.

1256
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,944
That's what they like,
the rough stuff.

1257
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,012
Yes, siree. You got
to treat them rough.

1258
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:02,555
Cave man stuff.

1259
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,059
Yeah. They like
that cave man stuff.

1260
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:10,355
So she hits me over the head
with her own club

1261
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:11,814
slings me over her shoulder

1262
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,733
carries me out of the cave
into the woods.

1263
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,193
Then what did you do?

1264
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,986
I don't know. I was unconscious.

1265
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,864
You dope, you missed
the best part of the dream.

1266
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,157
You think so?

1267
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:26,639
- Good morning.
- Oh, hello, boys.

1268
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,373
Hello, Mr. Lorgan, how are you?

1269
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:30,625
Fine. I'd like to have
a little chat with you, Eddie.

1270
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,294
Say, I'm gonna get a newspaper.
I'll be back in few minutes.

1271
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:34,897
Oh, would you have a chair,
Mr. Lorgan?

1272
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,464
- Oh, thanks.
- What's on your mind?

1273
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,359
You know, I liked the way
you handled yourself

1274
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:39,676
last night at the clambake.

1275
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,469
Yes, sir, I liked it a lot.

1276
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:44,055
Oh, thank you, Mr. Lorgan,
but what are you leading up to?

1277
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:45,598
Oh, a job.

1278
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:48,267
I'm thinking of
opening up a cafe

1279
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,853
big, swanky place
for the carriage trade.

1280
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,189
You know, I could use
you in the show.

1281
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,400
Gee, that's swell,
but, uh, what about Dennis?

1282
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,859
He's my partner, you know.

1283
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,903
Oh, I think
we can work that out.

1284
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,863
Good. How much will you pay?

1285
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,925
Well, you've been getting
a lot of publicity lately.

1286
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:05,785
I can double your last
Vaudeville salary.

1287
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:08,079
- It's a deal.
- Good. When can you start?

1288
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:10,498
Well, not until after
the baseball season's over.

1289
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:12,333
- Oh, not till then?
- Oh, no.

1290
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,260
You don't think I could
walk out now, do you?

1291
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,003
We practically got
the pennant cinched.

1292
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,798
Well, I'm not interested
in baseball.

1293
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,685
You see, I got a big chorus
of girls waiting

1294
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:21,902
ready to start to rehearse.

1295
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:22,969
Thirty of them.

1296
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,012
Gee, 30 girls.

1297
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,598
Yeah. A bevy of beauties.

1298
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,076
Well, I'm sorry
you can't make it.

1299
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,268
Oh, wait a minute. Look.

1300
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:31,755
Couldn't you hold off
for a while?

1301
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,813
The baseball season's
practically over.

1302
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,481
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1303
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,126
Well, you gonna be
in town for a while?

1304
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,651
Sure. The season finishes here.

1305
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,212
Well, couldn't you arrange
to get away

1306
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,654
at nights for rehearsals?

1307
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,866
No, no, I couldn't do that.

1308
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:47,827
Well, then there's no use
in talking anymore.

1309
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,747
- So long, Eddie.
- Wait a minute!

1310
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,540
Look, I'll do it, but...

1311
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,542
I'll do it,
but keep it quiet, will you?

1312
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:57,628
Oh, sure. I wouldn't want
to get you in a jam.

1313
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,881
I'll tell you what I'll do,
I'll call you tomorrow.

1314
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,442
And let you know
when we start rehearsals.

1315
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,092
- Yeah.
- So long.

1316
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,219
Solong.

1317
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,430
- So long, fellas.
- So long.

1318
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:08,757
How do you know it will work?

1319
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,349
With Eddie? Oh, it's a cinch.

1320
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,976
You just see his face
when I told him

1321
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,270
there were going to be
30 chorus girls, 30 of them?

1322
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,356
Look what one dame
did to a guy named Samson.

1323
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,775
Who was he, a fighter?

1324
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:21,736
So, you see, I'm all set.

1325
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,237
I'll get the act framed

1326
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,114
and then when
the season's over, you're in.

1327
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,159
Of course, I'll have
to sneak out every night.

1328
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:30,328
You'll cover up
for me, won't you?

1329
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,135
What else can I do?
I'm your pal, ain't I?

1330
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,873
Attaboy.

1331
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,166
You can't rehearse all night

1332
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,751
and play ball the next day,
Eddie.

1333
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,896
Why, with a few bad breaks,
we can lose the pennant.

1334
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,546
Quit worrying, will you?
I can handle it.

1335
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,006
I'm in great shape.

1336
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:32,765
Pass me the milk, will you, Ed?

1337
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:36,435
"Wolves continue slump
in game with Chicago.

1338
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,896
"The wolves dropped another
game today to Chicago

1339
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,690
"who swept to a 6-5 victory

1340
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,567
"aided by a flurry
of last-inning hits

1341
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,152
and three startling
errors by..."

1342
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,737
By shortstop Eddie O'Brien!

1343
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,197
Go ahead. Read it!

1344
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,745
What's gotten into him, anyway?

1345
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,498
The kid's lost his pep,
no coordination, no zip.

1346
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:58,851
He plays like a tired old man.

1347
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,209
Ah, he ain't tired.

1348
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,937
He's been hitting the hay
early every night.

1349
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,212
In fact, too early.

1350
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,256
Yes, that's very
unusual for O'Brien.

1351
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:07,341
- I should say so.
- Something's eating him.

1352
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,261
Well, what do the other boys
say? Have they got any ideas?

1353
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:13,806
Well, no, not exactly.

1354
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,349
Well, come on. What is it?

1355
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,810
Oh, it's nothing. It's nothing.

1356
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,979
Look, boys, if O'Brien
stays in this slump

1357
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,939
we can kiss
the pennant good-bye.

1358
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,400
So, if you have any ideas,
open up. Come on.

1359
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:27,236
Tell her, Slappy-

1360
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,779
Well, uh, it's really

1361
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,406
got two angles, see?

1362
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:32,450
You, well, you take,
like, a racehorse.

1363
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:35,119
He's going great,
winning every out

1364
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:38,205
but all of a sudden, well,
he really starts looking around.

1365
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,249
He's getting restless. See?

1366
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,002
What has O'Brien
got to be restless about?

1367
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,187
Well, it's like Slappy says

1368
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,212
you take that racehorse.

1369
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:46,714
When he starts looking around

1370
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:49,634
he's looking at another nag.

1371
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,554
Yeah. With a ribbon in her hair.

1372
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,264
That sounds like
a pretty silly reason

1373
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,350
for losing ball games

1374
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:00,603
but if O'Brien wants
to chase the girls, let him.

1375
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,229
Who's stopping him?

1376
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,565
As long as he keeps
decent hours.

1377
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,611
Well? Oh, oh, yes.

1378
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,196
That other angle.

1379
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,740
What else is bothering
our little racehorse?

1380
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,953
- You.
- Me?

1381
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,206
Miss Higgins,
you're the other nag.

1382
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,541
- I'm the...
- Hm-hmm.

1383
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,046
Really?

1384
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:32,677
Oh, so you want me
to play up to O'Brien

1385
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,512
so we'll win the pennant,
is that it?

1386
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,306
Can you think of
a better reason?

1387
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,976
No. No, of course not.

1388
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,103
But personally,
I'm-I'm only interested

1389
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:43,729
in his batting average.

1390
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,399
Look, Joe, I can't
rehearse all night

1391
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:47,751
and play ball in the afternoon.

1392
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,068
I need some rest.

1393
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,995
You gotta get
someone else, Joe. I'm through.

1394
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:52,863
You'll have
all next week to rest up.

1395
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,990
I don't care what it's doing
to your ball-playing!

1396
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,200
I gotta get this show set!

1397
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:57,785
And I got to play baseball!

1398
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,162
I feel like a heel
letting the team down, Joe.

1399
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,457
That pennant means
extra dough to those guys.

1400
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:06,043
Listen, I don't like
that kind of talk.

1401
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,129
Don't threaten me, Joe!

1402
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,715
No! I'm not coming down,
not tonight or any night!

1403
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,094
I think that boy needs
a little talking-to.

1404
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,351
- Hello, Eddie.
- Oh, hiya.

1405
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,936
Uh, what's your hurry?

1406
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:25,730
Well, I'm tired.
I'm gonna hit the hay.

1407
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,898
Eddie, wait a minute.

1408
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,109
Let-let's have
a little talk, huh?

1409
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,903
- Just you and me.
- Come on, Eddie.

1410
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,239
Look, uh, if it's about
my batting average

1411
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:36,766
there's nothing left
to talk about.

1412
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,325
That's why I want
to get some sleep.

1413
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,202
Well, that's just it, Eddie.

1414
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:43,039
M-maybe you're getting
too much sleep.

1415
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,916
That can happen, too, you know.

1416
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,002
You see, it's this way, Eddie.

1417
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:51,589
You're, well,
you're just like a horse

1418
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,382
I mean, a racehorse.

1419
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,302
You're all nerves,
you're too finely trained

1420
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:58,387
and, all of a sudden,
after you win a race

1421
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,265
well, you start looking around.

1422
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:04,852
Yeah? What am I looking at?

1423
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,189
Well, don't you know?

1424
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:11,692
It's a long time since
I've been a racehorse.

1425
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:14,195
Well, anyway, Eddie,
what I'm trying to say

1426
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,989
is that well,
maybe you're getting restless.

1427
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,824
You should relax more

1428
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:23,287
uh, get out and just
bust out, you know?

1429
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:25,706
I-I really think it might
do you some good.

1430
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,667
Uh, get yourself a girl, maybe

1431
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,921
and just bust out.

1432
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,506
Uh-huh.

1433
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:38,010
And, uh, what girl am I gonna

1434
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,553
bust out with?

1435
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,223
Well, I don't know

1436
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:46,477
but well, if you can't find one

1437
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,020
there-there's always me.

1438
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:50,689
You?

1439
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,444
You want to go out with me?

1440
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,241
You're asking me?

1441
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,494
I-i-it's for the team.

1442
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:04,829
Well, sure. The team.

1443
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,123
Your-your batting average,
you know.

1444
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,415
Sure. I know.

1445
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:11,001
You-you've been making errors.

1446
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,504
- Am I making one now?
- Unh-unh.

1447
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,928
Oh, Miss Higgins

1448
01:17:21,095 --> 01:17:23,722
you're the prettiest
manager in baseball.

1449
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,850
You're certainly
the prettiest shortstop.

1450
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:30,146
Oh, I've been
a foul ball up to now

1451
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,314
but it's all gonna be
different from here in.

1452
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,197
Goodnight, Miss Higgins.

1453
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,116
Well, Eddie, wait.

1454
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:44,118
Don't-don't you want
to bust out?

1455
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,704
Right now, all that counts
is winning that pennant.

1456
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:49,039
I'll take a rain check
on the other.

1457
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:50,875
Oh, I'm gonna lay that pennant

1458
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:53,085
right at your feet.

1459
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:55,045
Baby, when I do,
we're going to bust out

1460
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,547
in every town in this league.

1461
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,966
Oh, Eddie.

1462
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:01,260
Hello, Eddie. Well,
I hope I'm not intruding.

1463
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:03,012
Good evening, Miss Higgins.

1464
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,865
Look, honey, run along, will
you? I'll see you tomorrow.

1465
01:18:04,889 --> 01:18:07,266
So, this is why you had to
miss the rehearsal tonight, huh?

1466
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,226
I thought you said
you needed a rest.

1467
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,146
Rehearsal?
What's he talking about, Eddie?

1468
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,790
- Doesn't she know?
- Honey, I'll tell you tomorrow.

1469
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,482
Why, he's been rehearsing
every night

1470
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,443
for the past couple weeks.

1471
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,028
Rehearsing every night?

1472
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:21,238
Yes, for a show
that I'm putting on.

1473
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:23,005
Oh, the girls are gonna
miss you tonight.

1474
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,533
They need you badly, Eddie.

1475
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,607
- The girls?
- Listen, Katherine.

1476
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:29,747
I'll explain all this tomorrow.

1477
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,542
From now on, they can have him

1478
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,586
and the team can
get along without him

1479
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:38,005
for the rest of the season.

1480
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,757
Personally, I can
get along without him

1481
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,550
for the rest of my life.

1482
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,553
Well, I guess I can get along

1483
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,764
without you, too, Eddie,
from now on.

1484
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:52,728
Oh, it's beginning to
penetrate my thick skull.

1485
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,176
You must have bet a big chunk
of dough against the Wolves.

1486
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:58,067
The little boy's
beginning to get smart.

1487
01:18:58,234 --> 01:18:59,944
So you played me
for a sucker, huh?

1488
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,321
Well, I had to protect
my investment.

1489
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:04,341
I guess there's no point
in me giving you the routine

1490
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,824
about baseball being
a great game.

1491
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,910
We gotta keep it clean,
especially for the kids.

1492
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:09,620
No. You'd just be
wasting your time.

1493
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:11,205
That's what I thought.

1494
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:14,667
Come on!

1495
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,494
Alright, folks! Get a program
before the game starts!

1496
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,745
Programs! Programs!

1497
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:18,999
We want O'Brien!
We want O'Brien!

1498
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:21,210
-Louden - We want O'Brien!

1499
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,338
We want O'Brien!
We want O'Brien!

1500
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:25,964
This is the guy
they need in there.

1501
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:27,424
Man 2: No. He went
all to pieces.

1502
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:28,967
What do you mean, all to pieces?

1503
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,178
Anybody's entitled to a slump
once in a while.

1504
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:32,721
<i>Hey'. Look!</i>

1505
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,432
- We want O'Brien!
- Louden.

1506
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:39,978
We want O'Brien!
We want O'Brien!

1507
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:43,023
We want O'Brien!
We want O'Brien!

1508
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,109
It's Eddie O'Brien,
fellas! Right here!

1509
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:48,797
Why don't get in there
and play, Eddie?

1510
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:50,572
Nobody asked me.
I can't walk out...

1511
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,179
We'll carry you
if it'll do any good.

1512
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,241
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1513
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,915
Holy smokes! Look, it's Eddie.

1514
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,834
Hey, Eddie! What do you know?

1515
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,419
That-a boy, Eddie!

1516
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,313
What are you going
to do about him, Miss Higgins?

1517
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:06,922
Nothing. There's
nothing to be done.

1518
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:08,507
It wouldn't hurt to talk to him.

1519
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:11,677
Mike, there's nothing
to talk about.

1520
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,738
Besides, he's probably in
no condition to play anyhow.

1521
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,322
Why don't you
put him out there and see?

1522
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,599
Yeah, we have plenty of time
before the game starts.

1523
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,601
No!

1524
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,896
But you can talk to him
if you want to.

1525
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:26,525
Attaboy, Eddie! Get in there!

1526
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,735
If he goes in, we can
kiss our 20,000 good-bye.

1527
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:30,529
Ah, you fellas give up too easy.

1528
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:34,074
What are you talking
about? What 20,000?

1529
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,635
Have you boys been
betting against...

1530
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,244
Shut up!

1531
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,037
O'Brien mustn't
play today, boys.

1532
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:45,961
- That's it.
- Okay.

1533
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:48,672
A change in the line-up
for today's game!

1534
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,216
O'Brien at shortstop
for the Wolves!

1535
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:59,057
Denny. Denny, come here.

1536
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,493
Hi, honey.
What are you doing here?

1537
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:01,578
Listen, they're
going to get him.

1538
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:02,728
- Get who?
- Eddie.

1539
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:04,563
- They're out to get him.
- What?

1540
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,190
I heard Lorgan
and his men talking.

1541
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:08,525
They bet a lot of money
against the Wolves.

1542
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,111
They're a bad lot, Denny.
They won't stop at anything.

1543
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:12,905
You got to tell
Eddie not to play.

1544
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,198
Oh, he'd play anyway-

1545
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:16,033
You got to stop him
from playing.

1546
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,495
Sure, sure.
Stop him from playing.

1547
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,622
Yeah. Yeah, I'll stop him.

1548
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:25,959
Hey, Ed, paL.

1549
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:27,312
How about giving them
the old routine? The gag?

1550
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:28,462
Sure. You got the softball?

1551
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,255
- Right there.
- Let's go! Come on!

1552
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:09,628
Eddie: Come on. Let me have it.

1553
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:10,921
Hurry up. Let me have it.

1554
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,434
Eddie! Eddie!
Hey, fellas, come here!

1555
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:27,980
- You alright? Eddie!
- Get a doctor!

1556
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,856
So our boy was really hurt.

1557
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:32,150
Yeah, what do you know?

1558
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,403
- I'm Dr. Winston.
- Come on, right here, doc.

1559
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,197
Open up, boys. Come on.

1560
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:39,050
Better get him
to the locker room right away.

1561
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,450
- Get him up.
- Take him easy, now.

1562
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:42,369
- Go ahead.
- Nice and easy, boys.

1563
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:45,455
Take it easy. Nice and easy.

1564
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,433
Well, I guess there's
ain't nothing left for us to do.

1565
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,102
Well, wait. Maybe he's only
stunned for a few minutes.

1566
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:50,126
We gotta keep him out.

1567
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:51,628
- Karl, Steve.
- Yeah?

1568
01:24:51,795 --> 01:24:53,064
They don't know you two,
go down there

1569
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,107
tell them you're couple
of doctors

1570
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:55,382
and keep O'Brien out.

1571
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:57,384
- He'll be out, Joe.
- Okay.

1572
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:00,178
Take it easy now, boys.

1573
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:03,890
- Put him right down here.
- Careful. Very careful.

1574
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:05,350
Give me room, boys.
Give me room.

1575
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,019
- I'm Dr. Karl.
- I'm Dr. Stevens.

1576
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:08,478
- How is he?
- Can't be sure yet.

1577
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:10,125
- May be a concussion.
- A concussion?

1578
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,708
So you fellas better
get out of here.

1579
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,126
- We can take care of him.
- Alright, boys.

1580
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,877
- Back in the field.
- Come on, Miss Higgins.

1581
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:16,320
He'll be alright.

1582
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,366
I don't suppose you have
a stethoscope with you?

1583
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:20,949
Just cut me short, doc.
Say, why don't you run along?

1584
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,576
We don't all have to be here.

1585
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,036
Well, thank you very much.

1586
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,495
I would like to see the game.

1587
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,497
- Hmm...
- Well, what is it?

1588
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,583
Uh? Oh, it's 10 minutes
after 2:00, doc.

1589
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,470
Run along, doc, will you
and enjoy the game.

1590
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:32,543
That's a nice fellow.

1591
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,981
Say, he's a light sleeper,
ain't he?

1592
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,298
Yeah.

1593
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:38,258
- Call it.
- Heads.

1594
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:39,676
You win.

1595
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:46,390
He's safe.

1596
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,138
He's safe!

1597
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,322
- How is he?
- Them doctors won't let me in.

1598
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:33,623
They say they may have
to operate.

1599
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:35,774
What?

1600
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,541
Denny, Denny, what's this
about gambling?

1601
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:38,920
Who said anything
about gambling?

1602
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,004
- Shirley did.
- Shirley, you didn't...

1603
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,488
Now don't you start that.

1604
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:42,965
I know you knocked him out,
you did it on purpose.

1605
01:26:42,989 --> 01:26:44,533
Now, look, I was on a spot.

1606
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,469
Now you don't want a dead
shortstop on your hands, do you?

1607
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:48,912
Why didn't you call the cops?
They're all over the place.

1608
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:50,799
I was too scared to.
Why didn't you tell me?

1609
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:53,166
How did I know you were gonna
bean him with a hard ball?

1610
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,585
Oh, Denny!

1611
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:56,896
Mike, how's he?
Have you seen him?

1612
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,920
No, but he's still out.

1613
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,326
Them two doctors
won't let me in.

1614
01:26:59,381 --> 01:27:00,775
They're saying they're
gonna operate.

1615
01:27:00,799 --> 01:27:02,801
Operate! In-in there?
That's impossible!

1616
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,028
Well, that's what
they're saying.

1617
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,137
Well, I'm going in there!

1618
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:07,848
Gee, is it that bad?

1619
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:13,019
You hit him next time, will you?
My knuckles is getting sore.

1620
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:14,604
Hey, you can't come in here.

1621
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,022
Why not?

1622
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:17,733
Doctor's orders,
and I'm the doctor.

1623
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,109
This man's been hurt very bad.

1624
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:20,756
Now shut the door
and get out of here.

1625
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,367
Those two aren't doctors.
Come on! Quick!

1626
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,408
Karl: You can't come in here!

1627
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:59,024
Run it out! Run it out!

1628
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:01,651
Stay, stay.

1629
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:02,858
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

1630
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:05,280
- Get back!
- He's safe!

1631
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:07,741
- Good boy, old boy.
- Alright, watch his pitch.

1632
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,326
There they are, officers!

1633
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:10,786
Come on, now!

1634
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,432
Wait a minute, Joe!
What's your hurry?

1635
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,747
Stop him! Somebody, stop him!

1636
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,290
Denny, stop him!

1637
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,418
Just a second.

1638
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:20,962
Buddy.

1639
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,759
Oh, why, I hardly touched him.

1640
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:27,761
I guess I don't know
my own strength.

1641
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:28,928
Take him away, fellas.

1642
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:31,264
Come on, boys.

1643
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:33,975
Alright, boys! Play ball!
Batter up!

1644
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:35,894
Denny! Denny, come on,
get in there, kid.

1645
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,729
Get in there, kid.
Send Goldberg around!

1646
01:28:40,857 --> 01:28:43,151
- Slappy, is he still out?
- Yeah.

1647
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,046
I don't think he's seriously
hurt, Miss Higgins.

1648
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,321
He's merely stunned.

1649
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:50,283
Eddie, darling.
Darling, please look at me.

1650
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,663
Oh, Eddie, can you talk?
How do you feel?

1651
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,331
I feel fine.

1652
01:28:56,498 --> 01:28:59,501
- Oh, darling.
- I feel wonderful.

1653
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:02,629
Now, you just lie right here
and don't you move.

1654
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:03,922
Who's moving?

1655
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,632
Oh, darling, I was so worried

1656
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:07,634
when Dennis hit your,
the head with the ball.

1657
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:08,927
Dennis!

1658
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:11,054
Where is he?

1659
01:29:11,221 --> 01:29:13,932
Where is he?
Move it, I'll murder him!

1660
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:15,433
I'll kill him!

1661
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,477
- Eddie! Eddie, wait!
- Let me go!

1662
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:19,354
He did it on purpose!

1663
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:22,649
No, Eddie! He didn't! Oh, Eddie!

1664
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:32,158
Get in there, boy. Get in there.

1665
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,036
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1666
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,454
Where is he? Let me at him!

1667
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,164
Let me at him! Let me at him!

1668
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,166
I want him! I'll tear him apart!

1669
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:41,813
Alright, get a hit!
You can catch him!

1670
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,560
Yeah! Yeah! Give me a bat!
Give me a bat!

1671
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:49,184
Honest, Eddie, I can
explain the whole thing.

1672
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:52,679
Let's go, Eddie! Come on, Eddie!

1673
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:10,488
Eddie! Eddie, stop!

1674
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,574
Stop!

1675
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:15,535
- Wait! Eddie, stop!
- Eddie!

1676
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:17,120
Eddie, wait!

1677
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:19,497
