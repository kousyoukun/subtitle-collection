2
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:24,241
And, good morning, Dallas.
Ron Chapman on KVIL.

3
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:26,744
We've got a gorgeous morning
working outside.

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,081
OO A.M.
Standing already at 68 degrees.

5
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:34,789
We expect them to go up
to 75 degrees this afternoon.

6
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:24,743
Ow.

7
00:01:26,077 --> 00:01:28,347
Ugh.

8
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:52,277
Oh!

9
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:10,495
Ohh!

10
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:09,106
Get his ass out
of there, Jo Bob!

11
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:10,640
I ain't touching
no faggot.

12
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:13,610
Faggot! Give me five.

13
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:16,615
Get out of there.
Let's go hunting.

14
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,114
I ain't going
hunting.

15
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:20,619
What? Come on!

16
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:22,018
Get up!

17
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:23,387
No! Get out of here!

18
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:26,792
We just want to kill
a little something.

19
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:28,794
Yee-haw!

20
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:34,401
Hot damn.

21
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,236
See that old cow
out there?

22
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:39,506
Want to see her run?

23
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,511
Oh, Christ,
they're shooting at cows.

24
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,011
They're too drunk
to hit anything.

25
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:45,947
Don't worry
about it.

26
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,448
Man, they're just crazy.

27
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,991
Oh, my God!

28
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:00,765
Do you know something?

29
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,032
Hmm?

30
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:06,205
I can't figure out
how I dropped that turn-in.

31
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:07,204
It happens.

32
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,708
No, not to me
it doesn't.

33
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,712
Jesus Christ, you caught
the game-winning pass.

34
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:14,211
Relax.
Enjoy yourself.

35
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:16,216
It's a pretty day.

36
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:19,221
Man, I had that ball
right in my hands.

37
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:22,725
I just couldn't
hang on to the damn thing.

38
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:25,226
John Henry, the man
is just like you--

39
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,727
He's never
satisfied.

40
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,567
Hey, I'm gonna dump
these suckers up here.

41
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,738
Gee whiz.

42
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,240
Goddamn, the marines
have landed.

43
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,245
Come on out!

44
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:44,748
Surrender, you suckers!

45
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:46,750
Ha!

46
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,254
Come on, O.W.

47
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,256
Don't want to wake
them fuckers up.

48
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:53,292
Elliott, where's
your gun, man?

49
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:57,332
Freud says guns are an extension
of your dick, Jo Bob.

50
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:59,633
That son of a bitch.

51
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:00,666
Ha ha ha.

52
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:03,104
He's a regular wise ass,
you know that?

53
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,705
Hold up, O.W.

54
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:10,212
B.A. wants me
in his office tomorrow.

55
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:12,714
Must mean I'm
going to start, huh?

56
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,215
I doubt that.

57
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:16,218
What the hell
you mean?

58
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:18,221
I made some
great catches.

59
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:20,724
They can't keep me
on the bench forever.

60
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,226
You'll never get
off that bench

61
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,729
till you stop
fighting them suckers.

62
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:27,231
You gotta learn
how to fool them, man.

63
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:29,233
Give them what
they want. I know.

64
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:30,869
I've been fooling
them bastards for years.

65
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:33,772
If you start pretending
to be somebody else,

66
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:36,241
that's what you're gonna end up,
being somebody else.

67
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:38,745
Damn it, if I didn't
like you, boy,

68
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,749
if you didn't have
such great hands,

69
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:43,248
I'd keep
my mouth shut

70
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:45,252
and watch you go
right down the tubes.

71
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,285
I'm gonna
tell you something

72
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:47,320
for your own good.

73
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:49,758
You better learn how
to play the game.

74
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:52,762
And I don't just mean
the game of football.

75
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,065
Hell, we're all
whores, anyway.

76
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,402
We might as well
be the best.

77
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:01,468
There's one!

78
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:07,112
Goddamn it, Jo Bob,
you crazy son of a bitch!

79
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:08,110
What happened?

80
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:09,112
Jesus Christ!

81
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,615
We damn near
got the bird.

82
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,316
Didn't you see?

83
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:20,025
Go! Go! Go! Go!

84
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:34,443
All right, let me
have that TV.

85
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:41,718
13. Look for 13.

86
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:44,254
Yep, I'd rather face

87
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:45,754
Pittsburgh's
defensive line

88
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,757
than one of
Peter's parties.

89
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,259
Somebody's got to
do it, though.

90
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:51,761
Hey, it's all yours.

91
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:53,262
Go for it.

92
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:54,764
Hey, big guy.

93
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,266
Good game, baby.

94
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:58,269
Tony, good game,
my man.

95
00:07:58,334 --> 00:07:59,269
Howdy, howdy.

96
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,208
Hey, Seth,
great game, boy.

97
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,208
Hey, mama.

98
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,223
Hey, Maxwell!

99
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,724
Hey, Seth!

100
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:49,995
Hey, Phil.

101
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:51,997
Hey, Peter.

102
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:54,001
Where's that dolly
you promised me?

103
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,002
He's ripped tonight,
ain't he?

104
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:59,007
Hey, Jo Bob,
what will you do

105
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,942
against Alcie Weeks
in Chicago?

106
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,214
Know what I mean?
Know what I mean?

107
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,715
Crazy guy!
Crazy guy!

108
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:08,715
Hit me.

109
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,218
Hey, Jo Bob,

110
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:12,221
I got a great
dolly for you.

111
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,224
She's last year's
Miss Farm Implements.

112
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:15,724
Come on this way.

113
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,829
She's from S.M.U.
and she's almost a virgin.

114
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:20,832
Help him
to relax, honey.

115
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:22,834
He needs, uh,
understanding.

116
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:25,337
Show 'em your
finesse, Jo Bob.

117
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:26,804
Hey, Billy Joe!

118
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:31,377
I've never seen
titties like yours.

119
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:35,082
I swear to God,
I never have.

120
00:09:35,146 --> 00:09:36,081
They're beautiful.

121
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:38,085
Hey, Jo Bob,
how you doing?

122
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,585
How you doing,
Elliott?

123
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:44,258
Can I show your titties
to my buddy O.W.?

124
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:45,693
Can I? Would you?

125
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:48,028
All right! O.W.!
O.W.! Come here!

126
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:52,035
Ooh, John Henry,
don't get so excited.

127
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,534
We got all night.

128
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:54,903
Who's John Henry?

129
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,405
Ha ha ha.

130
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,407
He's an old friend
of mine.

131
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,412
Did you girls ever try
a quarterback sandwich?

132
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,912
Sounds good
to me.

133
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,715
Seth, I need
to talk to you

134
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,416
about that condo deal
down at Padre Island.

135
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:07,817
Not now, Steve.

136
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:10,823
Hey, you ever drink
a pink poontang?

137
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,322
It'll get you high.

138
00:10:12,388 --> 00:10:13,324
Say, Phil!

139
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,325
Phil!

140
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:16,362
Great catch, boy.
Great catch.

141
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:18,365
I've got some
ostrich boots

142
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,733
and some lizard.

143
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:23,238
I'll get them for you
after I change my shirt.

144
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:26,240
Alan, I'll be with
you in a minute.

145
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:28,242
Got to go change
my shirt.

146
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:31,879
Hey, Phil.

147
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:33,882
Oh, man, we were
just leaving.

148
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,382
Hey, Eric.
Hi, Susie.

149
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:36,484
Hi.

150
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,426
Susie wants to get home
and put Audrey to bed.

151
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:43,327
And it's almost time
for The Osmonds.

152
00:10:43,391 --> 00:10:46,297
Why don't you come over
Wednesday night for dinner?

153
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:47,798
Look, guy, come on over.

154
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:50,300
Fitch and his wife
are coming.

155
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,304
Afterward, Susie's gonna
read some scripture.

156
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:53,804
Uh, I...

157
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:54,805
Oh, man.

158
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,308
Maybe we'll all
take turns or something.

159
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:58,310
Hmm.

160
00:10:58,376 --> 00:10:59,811
All right,
I'll try hard.

161
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:00,811
Yeah.

162
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,248
See what you
can do.

163
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:03,248
All right, Sue.

164
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:04,249
We got plenty.

165
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:05,251
All right?

166
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,755
Hey, how you doing?

167
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,755
Hey, Billy.

168
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:11,256
See you later.

169
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:27,781
Being a little
hard on yourself, Andy.

170
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:28,782
Yeah, I know.

171
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:30,283
See that stewardess
over there?

172
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:31,284
Which one?

173
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,788
That one, there.

174
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,926
Goddamn, does she
get off on football.

175
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:41,263
Alan got some tit from
her the other night

176
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:42,463
just by showing her

177
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:44,767
that little bruise
on his calf.

178
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:47,805
I figure if she
gives up some tit

179
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:50,307
just by showing her
a bruise,

180
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:52,809
once she sees
this blood here,

181
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:55,313
she might give up
the whole thing.

182
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:56,378
Know what I mean?
Uh-huh.

183
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:04,258
I'd love to sit here
and talk, but I can't.

184
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:07,762
I got to test Balford's
theory of erotica.

185
00:12:07,825 --> 00:12:09,261
Check you later, baby.

186
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,768
He's real intelligent,
ain't he?

187
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:17,771
Baby.

188
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,272
You like that?

189
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,943
Come on, Andy,
I'm with her.

190
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:23,445
Andy, I'm with her,
I said.

191
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:37,994
It's nice to see

192
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,999
there's a little romance
left in the world.

193
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,715
It's an old story--
boy meets boy.

194
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,016
Well, I love
happy endings.

195
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:58,385
Oh, really? Good.
Now we can sit back

196
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,055
and wait for the
real obscenities.

197
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,624
You mean it gets worse?

198
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,159
It definitely
gets different.

199
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:06,662
See, alcohol
and fear

200
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:09,266
makes for a good
combination.

201
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,265
Fear?

202
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,266
Mm-hmm.

203
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,769
What are they
afraid of?

204
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,704
Falling on their
asses in Chicago.

205
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,277
Who are you,

206
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:22,747
and what are you
doing here?

207
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:23,748
Charlotte Calder,

208
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:26,051
and I'm asking myself
the same question.

209
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:27,551
I'm Phil Elliott.

210
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:28,553
I'm supposed to be here

211
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,824
to take you away
from all this.

212
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:32,826
Oh, yeah. See,
I'm a very funny guy.

213
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,329
The newspapers call me
the team funnyman.

214
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:39,602
Obviously you can't
believe every thing you read.

215
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:40,601
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,935
I'm not very good

217
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,939
at this
small talk stuff.

218
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:46,942
In fact, I learned
all my social graces

219
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,342
from football coaches,

220
00:13:48,408 --> 00:13:50,981
so just give me
another try, huh?

221
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:52,480
OK, team funnyman.

222
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,257
You've got
fantastic eyes.

223
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,825
Hilarious.

224
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:08,268
Hey, quit pushing
On me, man.

225
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:10,034
Put me down!

226
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,038
Why can't somebody
stop him?

227
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,940
What, are you crazy?

228
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:15,708
Look at him.

229
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:18,211
No!

230
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:20,949
Please put me down!

231
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:24,951
Jo Bob's here
to remind everybody

232
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:26,788
that the meanest
and the biggest

233
00:14:26,854 --> 00:14:28,923
get to make
all the rules.

234
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:30,424
I don't agree with that.

235
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:34,131
Agreement doesn't
enter into it.

236
00:14:34,194 --> 00:14:35,629
O.W.

237
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:38,301
Aah!

238
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,306
How can you
tolerate that?

239
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,639
I make allowances,

240
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:46,043
then I get ready,
and I run like hell.

241
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,978
That's what I like--

242
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:49,479
A man of courage.

243
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:55,352
Miss?

244
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:56,823
My name's Jo Bob.

245
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:58,524
Please let me pass.

246
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:01,929
I love your hair and
your nose and your legs.

247
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:02,929
Put me down.

248
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:04,933
You know I love
your legs.

249
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:06,433
Please put me down.

250
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:08,236
I want to fuck you.
I really do.

251
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,235
Will you put me down?

252
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:12,274
Will you let me go?

253
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:13,441
Aw, no.

254
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:16,446
I'll be nice
to you, understand?

255
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,449
I won't let anybody
take you away from me.

256
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:21,951
What are you so fussy
about, lady?

257
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,186
Piss off, Elliott.

258
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:25,554
Hey, Seth!

259
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,023
Seth!

260
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,563
Find something for Jo Bob
to do with his hands.

261
00:15:30,626 --> 00:15:32,062
Hey, Jo Bob.

262
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:35,001
I told you to
piss off, Elliott.

263
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:36,000
Let her go.

264
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:38,068
Shit!

265
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:39,070
Aah!

266
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:40,706
Jo Bob, goddamn it.

267
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,709
Who the fuck are you
giving orders to?

268
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,144
Hey, Jo Bob.

269
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,812
I'm going to
kill you.

270
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,585
He's just tying to keep
that dolly from raping you.

271
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,685
Jo Bob, it's me, Seth.

272
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,689
Come on, man. Relax.

273
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:56,693
It's a party.
Come on, Jo Bob.

274
00:15:56,757 --> 00:15:58,694
Calm down, baby.

275
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,632
Why's he always
making fun of me?

276
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:06,103
Go! Go! Go! Go!

277
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:15,481
Yaa!

278
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,648
Hey, I know you.

279
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,152
You had your chance.

280
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:24,825
What the hell are you
tying to prove,

281
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,828
taking on Jo Bob
over some chick?

282
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,829
For Christ's sake,
Seth, shit.

283
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:31,834
Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

284
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:33,333
A good idea?

285
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:35,336
I need Jo Bob, son.

286
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:36,836
I want him up.

287
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:39,609
I want him feeling
like he can climb

288
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:41,343
the Empire State
Building.

289
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:44,648
You may keep me
on the sports page,

290
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,516
but he keeps me off
the obituaries.

291
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:49,519
Where the hell
would I be

292
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,522
with Jo Bob's confidence
destroyed?

293
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:56,861
Goddamn it, son,
what did she expect?

294
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:58,230
These girls know
what happens

295
00:16:58,295 --> 00:16:59,930
at these parties.

296
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,298
That's why they
come here.

297
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:03,802
She didn't seem
like that to me.

298
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:13,948
Just lay off
Jo Bob, all right?

299
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:17,152
I want you both at your
best Monday night.

300
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:21,158
Oh, for Christ's sake,
I didn't hurt Jo Bob.

301
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:23,158
Damn it, quit
aggravating him.

302
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:25,160
Let him have
what he wants.

303
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,494
What he wants?

304
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,063
What about
what I want?

305
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:31,168
He's a baby,
for Christ's sake.

306
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:33,670
Don't put yourself
on his level.

307
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,171
Rise above it.

308
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:42,347
Come on, let's go
get in a pile.

309
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:43,347
Uh,

310
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:46,017
it's the same
old pile, Seth.

311
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,657
Shit, I'm going to get
knee deep in it, son.

312
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,325
Go ahead, partner.

313
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,794
See you tomorrow.

314
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,795
Yep.

315
00:18:38,649 --> 00:18:39,583
Hi.

316
00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:40,717
Hello.

317
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:43,523
I'm glad to see that
you're still alive.

318
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:46,492
Thanks for letting me
run like hell.

319
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:49,863
It's too bad I don't
take my own advice.

320
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,497
Yeah.

321
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:52,998
Can I come in?

322
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,136
Yeah.

323
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,740
Thank you.

324
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,741
You're welcome.

325
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,950
Can I get you
a drink?

326
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:09,953
Yeah, you got
any whiskey?

327
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:11,453
I only have milk.

328
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,190
Yeah, I love milk.

329
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,191
Good.

330
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,467
Nice place
you got here.

331
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:23,466
Oh, thanks.

332
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:29,974
Are you married?

333
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,042
Was.

334
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:33,546
Mmm, yeah,
so was I.

335
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,482
Do you work?

336
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:37,484
No.

337
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:41,989
What's this--alimony?

338
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:43,991
No.

339
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:44,992
Oh.

340
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:53,002
You talk a lot,
don't you?

341
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,436
No.

342
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:56,105
Hmm.

343
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,913
You look terrible.

344
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:06,519
Thanks. That really
builds up my confidence.

345
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:12,959
Why did you go to
that party, anyhow?

346
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:14,426
I don't know.

347
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:16,395
I thought it
would be fun.

348
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,930
Obviously
I made a mistake.

349
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:19,699
Hmm.

350
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:27,041
I'm tired.

351
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:28,542
I'm really
tired.

352
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:30,811
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:31,846
I was lonely.

354
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:34,384
I just needed
someone to talk to.

355
00:20:38,452 --> 00:20:40,089
Well, you can't
sleep here.

356
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,927
Thanks for letting
me sleep here.

357
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,931
No, I--I said
you can't sleep here.

358
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,766
Hello?

359
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,273
Oh, shit.

360
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:14,562
Yeech!

361
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:09,491
Hi, Peggy.

362
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:10,493
Hi, Phil.

363
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,496
I've got a meeting
with B.A.

364
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:14,064
Yeah, just a minute.

365
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:20,236
Phil Elliott's here.

366
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,223
You know, Phil.

367
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,193
There's not one damn
corporation I own

368
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:41,198
that means as much to me
right here

369
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:42,697
as my football team.

370
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,268
Come on.

371
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:52,609
Made a hell of a catch
on Sunday.

372
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:54,611
That's just,
uh, luck.

373
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:55,779
You know, Phil,

374
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:58,784
there's one thing
I learned early on in life.

375
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:01,719
The most important thing
a man can have.

376
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:03,221
What's that? Money?

377
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:04,221
Luck.

378
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:06,726
Luck tells me
something about a man.

379
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,732
If my people are lucky,
they tap into a big field.

380
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:14,235
If not, they can have every
geology degree in the world

381
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:16,737
and drill one dry duster
right after another.

382
00:23:16,802 --> 00:23:17,770
Take me.

383
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:20,274
I'm the luckiest man
in the world.

384
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,146
Sure as hell
ain't brains, is it?

385
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,284
Phil, there's always
a place in our little family

386
00:23:27,348 --> 00:23:29,251
for the right
kind of man.

387
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:30,419
Mm-hmm.

388
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,056
Now Phil...

389
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,593
people who confuse
brains and luck

390
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,561
can get in a whole
lot of trouble.

391
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,365
Seeing through
the game

392
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,500
is not the same
as winning the game.

393
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,217
It's gotten to the point

394
00:23:58,283 --> 00:23:59,652
where's Phil's
almost predictable.

395
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:02,390
I can know what
he's going to do--

396
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:06,061
Hey, Phil,
how are you doing?

397
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:07,561
Hey, Emmett. B.A.,
I'm sorry I'm late.

398
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,567
Why don't you all
stay in my office?

399
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:13,570
I got to see Connie
for a minute.

400
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:15,238
Thank you very much,
Emmett.

401
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:16,938
See you later, Phil.

402
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,409
Sit down.
Sit down.

403
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:52,779
That's it, Phil.

404
00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:55,985
What it all boils down
to is your attitude.

405
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:57,620
And another thing,

406
00:24:57,686 --> 00:24:57,686
I know you don't like
sitting on the bench.

407
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:04,034
You're a team member.
You have to adjust.

408
00:25:04,097 --> 00:25:05,265
Actually,
I have know players

409
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:06,869
that got used
to sitting on the bench,

410
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:08,203
if that's possible.

411
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:09,304
It's not.

412
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:13,209
You're too proud?

413
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:16,214
I want you
to listen to something.

414
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:17,714
The apostle Paul

415
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,220
in one of his letters
to the Corinthians said,

416
00:25:21,284 --> 00:25:22,853
"When I was a child,

417
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,557
I thought as a child.
I spake as a child.

418
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:27,392
I understood
as a child,

419
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:29,395
but when
I came to be a man,

420
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,798
I put away
childish things."

421
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,267
Hmm.

422
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,736
And there's a theme

423
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:38,072
that runs through
all this data.

424
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,239
It's immaturity,

425
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:40,407
your immaturity.

426
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:42,076
You lack
seriousness.

427
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,745
I scored five TDs
coming off the bench.

428
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,281
That's pretty serious.

429
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:47,749
You scored five TDs?

430
00:25:47,814 --> 00:25:50,252
Don't you know that
we worked for those?

431
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:51,752
We planned for them.

432
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,457
We let you
score those touchdowns.

433
00:25:54,523 --> 00:25:58,030
B.A., I've always
given you 100 %.

434
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,264
100 %!

435
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,200
You're talking about
individual effort.

436
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:04,870
Yes, you give that.
I don't deny it.

437
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:07,205
That's not what
I'm talking about.

438
00:26:07,271 --> 00:26:09,040
I'm talking
about a team.

439
00:26:09,105 --> 00:26:11,376
I'm talking
about a winning team.

440
00:26:11,442 --> 00:26:12,878
A winning team is

441
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:15,048
45 finely meshed gears
working together

442
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:16,449
in perfect
synchronization.

443
00:26:16,515 --> 00:26:19,889
If one of those gears
flies off on its own,

444
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:21,721
I'll pull it.

445
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:23,725
And if that's
not straight enough,

446
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,161
I'll say it
a different way.

447
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:29,065
If you want
to play football for me,

448
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,369
you have to change,
starting right now.

449
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:33,569
Ahem.

450
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:38,243
B.A., I'm sorry if my
immaturity has offended you,

451
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:42,683
and I'll honestly
try to change...

452
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:45,684
but I've been a starter
for six years,

453
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:48,754
and it's hard
to sit on the bench, but...

454
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,688
I'll wait my chance.

455
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:55,262
And when
you do start me,

456
00:26:55,326 --> 00:26:58,299
I'll make you
glad you did.

457
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:02,436
I appreciate that,
Phil...

458
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,840
and we'll see.

459
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:11,046
Hey, Phil, how
are you doing?

460
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,546
You know
Joanne Rodney.

461
00:27:12,613 --> 00:27:13,715
Phil Elliott.

462
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,219
Oh, my gosh.
Wait a minute.

463
00:27:16,284 --> 00:27:18,220
Ruth, you got
that contract?

464
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:20,723
I want you to see this.

465
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:23,728
It's a contract for our
number-one draft choice,

466
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,730
wide receiver
out of Lubbock,

467
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:27,230
a real good one here.

468
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:28,731
So, I, uh...

469
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:32,237
Gosh, I guess
next year you'll be...

470
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,740
Do you speak
Canadian at all?

471
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:39,013
Emmett, you've been running
these guys at me for years.

472
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:52,893
Come on.

473
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:06,210
Now, goddamn it,
Joanne--

474
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:07,710
Oh, wait. Ow!

475
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:08,879
God! That's my--

476
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:10,378
That's my
sore shoulder.

477
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:11,548
Which one?

478
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:14,387
That one, the one
you always hurt.

479
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:19,225
Oh, Jesus! My knee. Ohh.

480
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:20,724
Your left knee?

481
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,564
No. What do you mean,
my left knee?

482
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:26,232
Ahh! Phil!

483
00:28:26,297 --> 00:28:28,235
What do you mean, Phil?

484
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,402
Come on.

485
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:30,570
Ow. Ow.

486
00:28:30,636 --> 00:28:31,739
Come on.

487
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:34,912
Ow. You always
hurt me, Jo.

488
00:28:55,666 --> 00:29:00,275
B.A. wants me to adjust
to sitting on the bench.

489
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:02,709
Hell, I'll die
on the bench.

490
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,545
What's the sense
of the team winning

491
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:07,380
if I don't survive, huh?

492
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,214
You'll survive.

493
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,218
Really?

494
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:15,223
You know what I do?

495
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:18,727
I pull for the other team,
so we'll get behind

496
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:21,397
and B.A. will have
to put me in.

497
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:22,596
That's weird.

498
00:29:25,298 --> 00:29:27,269
Why don't you
just quit?

499
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:33,576
Well, what would I do

500
00:29:33,643 --> 00:29:36,247
that wouldn't be
the same or worse?

501
00:29:36,311 --> 00:29:39,751
It's the only thing
I know how to do good.

502
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:41,754
Best hands in the league,
you know.

503
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,265
Phil,
do you love me?

504
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,107
Sort of.

505
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,783
What kind of
an answer is that?

506
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,785
Well...

507
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:13,292
it's the only kind of answer
I know how to give

508
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:17,295
when somebody I really like
needs to know the truth.

509
00:30:28,872 --> 00:30:32,312
Hey, how long
you been awake?

510
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,012
Couldn't sleep.

511
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:48,497
You know, you don't
look too good.

512
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:51,167
Maybe you ought
to take some vitamins.

513
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:53,570
I don't need
a healthy body.

514
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:56,573
I do it all
with my mind.

515
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:57,840
Yeah?

516
00:30:57,906 --> 00:31:00,846
I've been ignoring the fact
that I'm falling apart.

517
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,780
Say, Joanne...

518
00:31:02,845 --> 00:31:04,114
Mm-hmm.

519
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,787
Where's the pictures
of yourself you cut out?

520
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:09,119
Hmm?

521
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:12,125
Well, that girl just
doesn't exist anymore.

522
00:31:12,189 --> 00:31:16,163
Oh, so Joanne Rodney
doesn't exist anymore.

523
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:19,298
Well
in that case,

524
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:22,437
it kind of
looks like you.

525
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:27,308
Uh, what do you
want for breakfast?

526
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:29,311
I'll have whatever
you're having.

527
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:31,312
Well, I'm having
chocolate pudding.

528
00:31:31,377 --> 00:31:33,315
Uh, wait a minute,
Joanne.

529
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,815
Uh, wait a minute.

530
00:31:34,881 --> 00:31:34,881
How about
some bacon and eggs?

531
00:31:37,922 --> 00:31:38,991
Don't have any bacon.

532
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:40,326
How about some eggs?

533
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,493
Mmm, nope.

534
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,662
Toast?

535
00:31:42,728 --> 00:31:43,830
No butter.

536
00:31:43,896 --> 00:31:45,667
Dry toast
or chocolate pudding.

537
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:47,167
I'll have
chocolate pudding, then.

538
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:49,338
I only have one,

539
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:51,839
but I'll share it
with you.

540
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:54,176
Really? It's
a great meal then.

541
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:55,309
Let's go.

542
00:32:05,521 --> 00:32:06,924
Come on, feed me.

543
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:14,300
Well, I'm going
to do it.

544
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:16,134
Good.
Give me some more.

545
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,136
No, seriously.

546
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,804
I'm really
going to do it.

547
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,006
Do what?

548
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,077
Mary Emmett Hunter.

549
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:28,817
Come on, what do you want
to marry Emmett for?

550
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:32,321
He's nothing. It's just
gonna screw up your life.

551
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:35,825
When I told him I wanted
to keep the apartment,

552
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:37,324
and he said I could.

553
00:32:37,392 --> 00:32:40,330
You'll come by
and see me, won't you?

554
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,335
If I can.

555
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:49,840
I got to get through.

556
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:20,309
Hey, cheer up.

557
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,313
Everybody gets married
now and then.

558
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:26,317
Yeah, but I thought
you'd draw the line

559
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:27,816
at joining the family.

560
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,087
Yeah. Me, too.

561
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:32,322
Mm-hmm.

562
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,825
But look at it
like this--

563
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,328
With me
in the Hunter family,

564
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:40,333
you won't have to learn
to speak Canadian.

565
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,126
We boring you,
Douglas?

566
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:07,932
Fall asleep again,
it's $1 OO fine.

567
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,603
OK, 3rd and 8.

568
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:18,111
All right!
All right!

569
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:20,312
The things I do for love.

570
00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:22,948
No. You should never
have thrown to Elliott

571
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:24,682
with that kind
of coverage.

572
00:34:24,747 --> 00:34:26,151
Look at Delma there.

573
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:27,686
He's wide open.

574
00:34:29,354 --> 00:34:31,960
I don't like
this buddy-buddy stuff

575
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:33,493
interfering
with my judgment.

576
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:36,698
Shit. You can't win
for losing around here.

577
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:49,245
Run it back, run it back.

578
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:05,764
That's it, Stallings.
Real good.

579
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:07,900
Stallings, what were you
thinking of here?

580
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:12,506
I'm... I'm
not sure, sir.

581
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,906
You're not sure.

582
00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:15,975
No, sir.

583
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:18,780
The entire game riding
on this one series of downs,

584
00:35:18,844 --> 00:35:21,316
and we have a player
who's not sure.

585
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:24,989
There's no room in this
business for uncertainty.

586
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:29,492
No room.

587
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:38,801
Shit. Here it comes.

588
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:40,303
Here's where
you screwed up.

589
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:42,307
I didn't screw up.
You changed the play.

590
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:43,807
You changed the play.

591
00:35:43,873 --> 00:35:45,811
I didn't
change the play.

592
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:47,144
You brought it in.

593
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,479
I did not.

594
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:50,882
Just cover for me.

595
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:52,317
I'd like all of you

596
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,353
to watch this
next play carefully.

597
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:55,822
Especially you.

598
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,091
Especially you, Elliott.

599
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,769
Great catch.
Great catch.

600
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:11,273
Yeah!
All right!

601
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,179
Whoo!
All right!

602
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,785
Now, Elliott,

603
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,522
how would you
describe this play?

604
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:31,463
Well...

605
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:33,932
I'd say we
scored a touchdown.

606
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:39,205
Oh, you think it's funny!

607
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,810
Well, I fail to see
any humor at all.

608
00:36:42,874 --> 00:36:46,314
Maxwell changed the play
that I sent in,

609
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,816
Elliott broke his pattern,

610
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:51,319
and the catch
was a fluke.

611
00:36:51,384 --> 00:36:54,824
There's no room for flukes
in winning game plans.

612
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:58,830
Why do you think that
we go over and over

613
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:00,328
the printouts
of a game plan?

614
00:37:00,394 --> 00:37:02,298
Because deviating
from that plan

615
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:03,766
can cost us
a championship.

616
00:37:03,831 --> 00:37:05,769
If there's some of you

617
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:08,773
who aren't interested
in being champions,

618
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:10,273
well, then you laugh.

619
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,277
Relax. Have a good time,

620
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:13,778
but you'll do it

621
00:37:13,843 --> 00:37:17,283
on somebody else's
football team, not mine.

622
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:20,120
The key to being
a professional

623
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:22,255
is consistency,

624
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,590
and the computer
measures that quality.

625
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:28,295
No one of you is as good
as that computer.

626
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,264
I hope I'm understood.

627
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:36,538
Now, everybody on the bus
in 10 minutes,

628
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:37,972
except you, Stallings.

629
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:41,412
I'd like a word with you
in private, please.

630
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:01,968
Hey, let me have
those shoes.

631
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:03,469
That's cold, man.

632
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:04,470
Hey, baby.

633
00:38:05,937 --> 00:38:08,375
Do you believe
they cut Stallings?

634
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,909
Who's Stallings?

635
00:38:12,644 --> 00:38:14,749
Runner's
run-pass-49-right.

636
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:16,249
Sounds
real important.

637
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,752
Look at it.

638
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:18,752
On two.

639
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:20,489
Ready?
Break!

640
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:24,294
4-3, number 2-zone.

641
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:25,294
Ready? Break!

642
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:27,464
Stunt left!

643
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,965
Watch
the running back sweep.

644
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,399
I got it.

645
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:32,602
Hut! Hut!

646
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:35,039
Coming in, coming in!

647
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,674
Coming in!

648
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:37,673
Whoo!

649
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:41,513
Whoo!

650
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:46,418
Douglas!

651
00:38:46,484 --> 00:38:48,086
The reason
we drafted you

652
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:50,590
was because they said
you were fast and smart.

653
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:52,393
At this point
I'd be delighted

654
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:54,094
if you'd be at
least one of those.

655
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,093
Yes, sir.

656
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:57,598
Carney, get in here
for Douglas!

657
00:38:57,664 --> 00:38:59,467
Back in the huddle!

658
00:39:02,236 --> 00:39:03,638
Hey, Douglas.

659
00:39:03,703 --> 00:39:05,641
Isn't this
the kind of day

660
00:39:05,706 --> 00:39:08,644
you'd rather be by a fire
with a good book?

661
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:10,144
Fuck you, faggot.

662
00:39:10,212 --> 00:39:12,684
Promises, promises.

663
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:14,149
Set!

664
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:17,991
Hut!

665
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:31,409
How's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

666
00:39:31,473 --> 00:39:34,412
with a dedicated, young
Christian stud like Hartman?

667
00:39:34,477 --> 00:39:36,279
It's discouraging.

668
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:38,283
It's like you told me.

669
00:39:38,348 --> 00:39:39,783
You got to cheat.

670
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:41,786
I wrote the book
on that, hoss.

671
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:42,852
I believe it.

672
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:46,457
Elliott!

673
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:48,260
Get your ass
in here!

674
00:39:48,326 --> 00:39:50,328
Coming, boss.

675
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:54,201
Red-right-74.

676
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,204
You're going to get
yourself a fine, Jo Bob.

677
00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:59,172
It's worth it.

678
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:00,206
You got it?

679
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,208
Yes, sir.

680
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,411
On three.
Ready? Break!

681
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,050
Hut!

682
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,420
2-49!

683
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:14,190
2-49!

684
00:40:14,255 --> 00:40:15,224
Check!

685
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,992
2-76!

686
00:40:17,058 --> 00:40:18,495
2-76!

687
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:19,629
Hut!

688
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:20,664
Hut!

689
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,664
Hut!

690
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:26,504
Ow!

691
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,139
Ahh! Goddamn it!

692
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:29,240
Goddamn it!

693
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:30,307
Ahh!

694
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:31,309
Hold it.

695
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,112
Oh, goddamn it!

696
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:34,613
Pull them out.

697
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,115
Don't move,
don't move.

698
00:40:36,181 --> 00:40:37,116
Pull it!

699
00:40:37,182 --> 00:40:38,117
Pull!

700
00:40:38,183 --> 00:40:39,953
You all right?

701
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:50,931
Which one?

702
00:40:50,998 --> 00:40:52,934
Christ,
which do you think?

703
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:54,303
Elliott!

704
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,041
That's what comes
from not concentrating.

705
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:59,008
Yes, sir.

706
00:40:59,073 --> 00:41:01,010
Amazed at how these
young fellows

707
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:03,279
can take the punishment
of their profession.

708
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:04,715
Hello, Monsignor.

709
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:06,483
Oh, hello, Phil.

710
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:09,121
You're a very brave
young man.

711
00:41:09,186 --> 00:41:11,491
That's real devotion.

712
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:15,063
You remind me of the
magnificent missionaries

713
00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:16,127
of history.

714
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:20,066
Never thought
of that, Monsignor.

715
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:24,206
Come on, Elliott,
stop dogging it!

716
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,204
That's fine.

717
00:41:27,272 --> 00:41:29,710
Run this here
Chicago pass pattern.

718
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:31,213
Red-right-74.

719
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:32,913
Look at it.

720
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:34,414
Here we go.

721
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:35,650
On 2.
Ready? Break!

722
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:37,653
Come on, snap it up!

723
00:41:37,718 --> 00:41:39,622
Elliott,
get in there!

724
00:41:43,225 --> 00:41:44,327
Brown-left.

725
00:41:46,696 --> 00:41:47,631
Set!

726
00:41:49,432 --> 00:41:50,734
Hold it!

727
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:52,004
Carney, get in there!

728
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:54,440
No!

729
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:56,008
Douglas in, please.

730
00:41:56,073 --> 00:41:58,879
Carney, get the hell
out of there!

731
00:42:00,911 --> 00:42:02,782
Let's go.
Here we go.

732
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:05,886
Set!

733
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,956
Set!

734
00:42:12,391 --> 00:42:14,295
2-75!

735
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:15,863
2-75!

736
00:42:17,163 --> 00:42:18,164
Check!

737
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:19,868
2-72!

738
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:22,038
Hartman! Hartman!

739
00:42:22,103 --> 00:42:23,606
Let's just get
the ball snapped!

740
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:25,742
You're giving me
a fucking headache!

741
00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:26,776
Rookies.

742
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:27,778
High schoolers.

743
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:28,778
Let's go.

744
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:30,782
A bunch
of high schoolers.

745
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:31,782
Set!

746
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,251
Hut!

747
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:36,319
Hut!

748
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:51,404
Are you all right, man?

749
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,107
Hey, Phil,
you all right?

750
00:42:58,078 --> 00:42:59,413
You OK?

751
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:03,752
Yeah, I'm all right.

752
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:06,256
Wait--wait--wait--
wait a minute.

753
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:08,057
Help me up.

754
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:11,360
There's your hat, man.

755
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:12,362
Nice catch.

756
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:13,363
Yeah.

757
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:17,969
Now, that's
concentration, Elliott.

758
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,545
Feels pretty swollen.

759
00:43:27,612 --> 00:43:29,850
Let's work that knee.

760
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:36,258
Goddamn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

761
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:39,260
I hit my shoulder
when I hit the floor.

762
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:41,763
It feels like
it's full of gravel.

763
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,766
It's always felt like
it was full of gravel.

764
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:46,771
Give me a B-12 shot.
That's what I want.

765
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:48,270
Always messing
with my knee.

766
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,770
How you doing, baby?

767
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,276
Fine. You going
to get a shot?

768
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,776
No shots for me, turkey.

769
00:43:53,843 --> 00:43:55,278
I can't stand needles.

770
00:43:55,343 --> 00:43:57,781
You got to master
the game's technology.

771
00:43:57,847 --> 00:43:59,283
How do you do that?

772
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:00,784
Take those pills
and shots, man.

773
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,654
Does terrible things
to your body.

774
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:04,089
If you last long enough,

775
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:06,224
you'll realize
the only way to survive

776
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:08,226
is the pills and shots.

777
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:09,727
Not me, turkey.

778
00:44:09,794 --> 00:44:12,232
I got respect
for my body.

779
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:13,731
You'll get past that.

780
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:15,536
You're crazy, too.

781
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:17,070
I'd appreciate it

782
00:44:17,135 --> 00:44:19,039
if you could finish up
with butter fingers

783
00:44:19,104 --> 00:44:21,542
and give me my
B-12 shot.

784
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:24,045
I got an important
business meeting.

785
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:26,047
I found two boys
from Oklahoma

786
00:44:26,112 --> 00:44:28,484
that want to invest
in my restaurant business.

787
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:29,484
Oklahoma?

788
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,485
That's right.

789
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:31,487
That figures.

790
00:44:31,553 --> 00:44:34,491
Once the first one
starts making money,

791
00:44:34,555 --> 00:44:35,992
then you sell franchises.

792
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:38,497
That's where
the big money is.

793
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:40,998
What are you gonna
call the restaurants?

794
00:44:41,064 --> 00:44:43,602
Jo Bob's Fine Foods.

795
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:45,101
Do you like it?

796
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:46,103
That's right.

797
00:44:46,169 --> 00:44:48,072
Jo Bob's Fine Foods.

798
00:44:48,137 --> 00:44:50,141
Eat here
or I'll kill you.

799
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:51,142
Ha ha ha!

800
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,145
You son of a bitch!

801
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:56,216
We're not going
to have trouble here!

802
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:57,716
Come on, Jo Bob!

803
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:58,917
Jo Bob!

804
00:44:58,983 --> 00:45:01,355
Go on to your
meeting now.

805
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,758
You goddamn bird turd!

806
00:45:03,824 --> 00:45:06,763
Get out or I'll
report you to B.A.

807
00:45:06,827 --> 00:45:07,762
You would?

808
00:45:07,828 --> 00:45:09,297
You bet your ass.

809
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:10,798
You're chicken shit.

810
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:16,172
Get out of my face,
Monroe.

811
00:45:16,236 --> 00:45:19,676
It always did take
two of you

812
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:21,679
to hold one of me.

813
00:45:21,744 --> 00:45:23,012
Excuse me.

814
00:45:24,146 --> 00:45:26,083
Too damn much B-12.

815
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,606
Back off, asshole!

816
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,607
Back off!

817
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,108
I ain't moving!

818
00:46:49,448 --> 00:46:51,886
Jo Bob loves you.

819
00:46:51,951 --> 00:46:52,986
God almighty!

820
00:46:53,053 --> 00:46:55,024
Damn, shit!

821
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:56,858
God.

822
00:46:56,923 --> 00:46:59,396
It's the tooth fairy.

823
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,130
Fuck you, tooth fairy.

824
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:02,631
Ha ha ha!

825
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:03,631
Oh, shit.

826
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:07,640
I hope I don't look
as bad as you look.

827
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:10,641
You make me look like
Cinderella, asshole.

828
00:47:10,705 --> 00:47:13,645
If I had a dog
like you,

829
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:16,649
I'd shave his butt and
make him walk backwards.

830
00:47:16,713 --> 00:47:18,650
Old Doc Elliott's
gonna take care of us.

831
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:21,152
It's time to break into
the old medicine cabinet.

832
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,655
How's your elbow?

833
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,155
Goddamn it,
Elliott!

834
00:47:24,222 --> 00:47:27,162
Eddie's going to get
your ass for this.

835
00:47:27,226 --> 00:47:29,163
Yeah, but they won't
do nothing to you.

836
00:47:29,228 --> 00:47:30,664
I ain't the one
that's doing it.

837
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:32,165
You're going
to take some.

838
00:47:32,232 --> 00:47:35,172
They turn me in,
they got to turn you in.

839
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:36,671
They won't do that.

840
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:38,171
That's 'cause
I'm a star.

841
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:41,244
Genuine
sports personality.

842
00:47:41,308 --> 00:47:43,680
A legendary folk hero.

843
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:45,715
Folk hero,
have some Dexedrine.

844
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:47,216
Don't mind if I do.

845
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:48,717
A little Compazine.

846
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,220
Would you like Codeine?

847
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:52,088
Does a shark shit
in the sea?

848
00:47:52,154 --> 00:47:53,223
Give me
some of this.

849
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:54,959
One for me.

850
00:47:55,024 --> 00:47:57,996
That's the breakfast
of champions there.

851
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:02,935
Nectar of the gods.

852
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:03,935
Yes.

853
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,976
You know something?

854
00:48:10,042 --> 00:48:11,978
You're
the only guy I know

855
00:48:12,043 --> 00:48:14,482
that's got an uglier
body than mine.

856
00:48:14,547 --> 00:48:15,916
Bullshit.

857
00:48:15,982 --> 00:48:17,953
Ha ha ha!

858
00:48:18,018 --> 00:48:19,220
John Henry,

859
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:22,091
why do we abuse
ourselves this way?

860
00:48:22,156 --> 00:48:24,127
Hey, Seth.

861
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,931
Have you ever
loved anybody?

862
00:48:27,996 --> 00:48:29,999
You know,
loved somebody.

863
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:34,872
Aw, last night.

864
00:48:34,937 --> 00:48:36,874
All-time show stopper,
SOn.

865
00:48:36,939 --> 00:48:38,877
I don't want
to hear this.

866
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:40,377
All-time show stopper.

867
00:48:40,442 --> 00:48:42,647
You know Jerry Drake?

868
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:43,647
Drake?

869
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:45,149
Big Tex
Automotive Supply?

870
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:46,651
I know that asshole.

871
00:48:46,717 --> 00:48:48,654
It was his YMCA team

872
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,159
that me and Hartman had
to talk to last night.

873
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:54,661
I gave them my usual
bullshit.

874
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:57,164
Football, character
development, all that crap.

875
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,668
Hartman comes up
with this story

876
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:02,604
about Jesus being captain
of a football team.

877
00:49:04,338 --> 00:49:07,277
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

878
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:08,276
Whoo!

879
00:49:08,342 --> 00:49:10,480
And Judas
was the coach.

880
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:12,548
Nope, Judas
sold the playbook

881
00:49:12,614 --> 00:49:14,049
to the devil's team.

882
00:49:14,115 --> 00:49:15,953
Oh, God.

883
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:18,955
Wait'll you hear
this part.

884
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,958
Drake invites me
and Hartman

885
00:49:21,023 --> 00:49:23,461
to his house
for a drink.

886
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:25,463
Now,
I got the wheels,

887
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:27,966
so Hartman's stuck
with me, right?

888
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,072
Anyway,
here's the point.

889
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,574
It turns out Drake
wants to watch

890
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,944
while me and Hartman
do nasty things

891
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:38,912
to his bouncy-bottomed
little wife.

892
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:42,385
Aw, Jesus, Maxwell.
Really.

893
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:43,384
Hey, I know.

894
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,885
It's not your
type of thing.

895
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:46,889
But I'm more
of a philosopher.

896
00:49:46,954 --> 00:49:49,491
I like to mingle
with the little people.

897
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:50,859
What about Hartman?

898
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:52,560
You know Hartman.
Goody two-shoes

899
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:54,898
is fidgeting around
like a one-legged cat

900
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:57,902
tying to buy shit
on a frozen pond.

901
00:49:57,966 --> 00:49:59,401
Until Seth fixes him

902
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:00,904
a couple of pink
poontang specials.

903
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,405
The crazy tourist drink

904
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:04,409
that I fix
for stewardesses.

905
00:50:04,474 --> 00:50:05,909
Two shots out of that,

906
00:50:05,975 --> 00:50:07,344
and Hartman
is shot to shit.

907
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:08,346
Freaked out.

908
00:50:08,412 --> 00:50:10,415
I never saw a guy
having so much fun

909
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,418
and crying
at the same time.

910
00:50:12,483 --> 00:50:15,121
I don't believe it,
but I'm getting horny.

911
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:16,121
Aha!

912
00:50:16,187 --> 00:50:18,625
Wait'll you get
to this part.

913
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,428
Drake takes out some
of them fake dicks.

914
00:50:21,494 --> 00:50:23,496
Aw, Max, that's gross.

915
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:24,696
That's not gross.

916
00:50:24,763 --> 00:50:27,135
Gross is when you kiss
your grandpa good night,

917
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,872
and he sticks his tongue
down your throat.

918
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:33,041
Anyway, he's got one

919
00:50:33,107 --> 00:50:35,043
that's about
8 inches long.

920
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:37,546
It's pink and it's got
crinkledees in it.

921
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:39,048
It's got a grinder
that you turn like this.

922
00:50:39,114 --> 00:50:41,050
It goes in and out--

923
00:50:41,116 --> 00:50:44,088
I don't want to hear
any of this.

924
00:50:44,153 --> 00:50:46,291
I'm getting
to the weird part.

925
00:50:46,356 --> 00:50:48,093
The weird part?

926
00:50:48,158 --> 00:50:49,661
Yeah, it gets weird.

927
00:50:49,726 --> 00:50:51,161
OK, who did it?

928
00:50:51,227 --> 00:50:52,629
He did it.

929
00:50:52,697 --> 00:50:53,631
Is that right, Seth?

930
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:54,632
Did what?

931
00:50:54,698 --> 00:50:55,666
The medicine cabinet!

932
00:50:55,732 --> 00:50:58,672
If B.A. finds out,
it'll be somebody's ass.

933
00:50:58,736 --> 00:51:00,172
Your water's too hot.

934
00:51:00,238 --> 00:51:01,173
Calm down.

935
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:02,608
The man
was desperate.

936
00:51:02,673 --> 00:51:05,111
Think of it
as an emergency.

937
00:51:05,177 --> 00:51:07,615
I suppose you stood there
and watched.

938
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,621
No, he held me down
and made me swallow them.

939
00:51:11,684 --> 00:51:13,622
This shit
has got to stop.

940
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:18,394
And leave my goddamn
beer alone!

941
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:22,331
Elliott,
don't you piss in there.

942
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:27,571
Ahh.

943
00:51:28,804 --> 00:51:30,072
Bastard.

944
00:52:40,921 --> 00:52:43,894
Did I call my wife
last night?

945
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:46,295
I don't
think so, son.

946
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,868
What do I tell her?

947
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:52,368
Tell her you escaped,

948
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:54,372
and you don't have
to pay the ransom.

949
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:55,872
I can't tell her that.

950
00:52:55,938 --> 00:52:57,373
Ha ha ha!

951
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:00,879
Dream up the wildest
thing you can think of,

952
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:02,814
and lay it on her.

953
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,619
She'll go for it,
coming from you.

954
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:06,617
Yeah?

955
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:07,618
I'm right.

956
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:11,024
Why do I smell
like strawberries?

957
00:53:17,896 --> 00:53:20,334
What'd you do
last night, Poot?

958
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:26,442
Grrr!

959
00:53:26,508 --> 00:53:28,444
Come on,
what'd you do?

960
00:53:28,509 --> 00:53:30,547
Well, I'll tell you.

961
00:53:30,612 --> 00:53:33,017
I had a date
with Charlotte.

962
00:53:33,081 --> 00:53:34,183
Oh, shit.

963
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:36,554
I hope you're not
getting hooked

964
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:37,687
on that chick.

965
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:39,189
Breaks
your concentration.

966
00:53:39,256 --> 00:53:40,691
I'll tell you something.

967
00:53:40,756 --> 00:53:45,065
The only thing I haven't
broken is my concentration.

968
00:53:45,128 --> 00:53:47,867
Why do we do it,
partner?

969
00:53:47,931 --> 00:53:51,371
Well, the only way
to find that out, man,

970
00:53:51,435 --> 00:53:53,406
is to quit.

971
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:55,576
You're not thinking
about quitting.

972
00:53:55,641 --> 00:53:59,917
I'm thinking I'm tired
of beating myself up.

973
00:54:01,147 --> 00:54:02,182
Don't worry.

974
00:54:02,248 --> 00:54:04,251
You'll get tired
of thinking.

975
00:54:13,127 --> 00:54:15,098
Coca-Cola, Poot.

976
00:54:16,264 --> 00:54:17,834
Throw me an RC,
Seth.

977
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:30,447
Seth.

978
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:32,485
She believed me.

979
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:34,488
Of course
she believed you.

980
00:54:34,553 --> 00:54:35,988
Who wouldn't
believe you?

981
00:54:36,054 --> 00:54:36,989
But I'm--

982
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,992
You did the right thing.

983
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,997
Lying can be really good
for a relationship.

984
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,039
Hey, Art.

985
00:54:51,104 --> 00:54:53,776
Welcome
to the big leagues.

986
00:54:57,182 --> 00:55:00,122
You know, I'm getting
to like the pain.

987
00:55:00,186 --> 00:55:01,254
Huh?

988
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,727
Remember when
I busted my elbow?

989
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,726
Oh, yeah.

990
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,898
I knew it was
dislocated

991
00:55:09,963 --> 00:55:11,900
the second
it happened, man.

992
00:55:11,965 --> 00:55:13,903
When I was
laying there,

993
00:55:13,968 --> 00:55:16,406
yelling, flopping
all over the field

994
00:55:16,472 --> 00:55:18,909
in front
of all those people,

995
00:55:18,973 --> 00:55:20,911
you know
what I felt?

996
00:55:20,976 --> 00:55:21,911
Ohh.

997
00:55:21,977 --> 00:55:23,780
Satisfaction.

998
00:55:25,649 --> 00:55:27,252
Yeah. I mean,

999
00:55:27,317 --> 00:55:30,757
it made me feel
like I was doing

1000
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,256
something important,
you know?

1001
00:55:32,323 --> 00:55:33,257
Yeah.

1002
00:55:33,323 --> 00:55:35,762
When the pain
got the worst,

1003
00:55:35,826 --> 00:55:38,264
that's when I felt
the most...

1004
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:41,034
SeCUre.

1005
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,403
Yeah, I hear you.

1006
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:44,904
I hear you.

1007
00:55:47,608 --> 00:55:49,110
The answer is no.

1008
00:55:50,343 --> 00:55:51,646
No, what?

1009
00:55:52,946 --> 00:55:54,884
I ain't never
loved nobody.

1010
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:26,457
Good morning.

1011
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:29,027
Good morning.

1012
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:31,564
Did you sleep well?

1013
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,735
Yeah, I slept great.

1014
00:58:54,894 --> 00:58:56,831
Settle down
and listen up.

1015
00:58:56,896 --> 00:58:59,835
I want some asses
kicked this week.

1016
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:03,006
Douglas, that's a $1 OO
fine for being late.

1017
00:59:04,738 --> 00:59:07,845
I want you guys to study
Chicago's tendencies.

1018
00:59:07,908 --> 00:59:10,681
If you ain't ready
by Monday night,

1019
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:12,349
they're gonna run
down your throats

1020
00:59:12,414 --> 00:59:13,849
and out your assholes.

1021
00:59:13,915 --> 00:59:15,552
Whoo!
Ooh!

1022
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:17,888
And there'll be
a written test on Friday

1023
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,290
on these tendencies.

1024
00:59:22,493 --> 00:59:23,428
Coach.

1025
00:59:27,665 --> 00:59:30,103
Those of you
whose names appeared

1026
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,603
on the bulletin board

1027
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:34,609
are invited to
Mr. Hunter's home tomorrow

1028
00:59:34,673 --> 00:59:37,780
to help Conrad Jr.
Celebrate his birthday.

1029
00:59:37,843 --> 00:59:39,781
Be there at 12:00 sharp,

1030
00:59:39,846 --> 00:59:41,114
appropriately dressed.

1031
00:59:42,682 --> 00:59:46,122
Now, before we break
into our separate groups,

1032
00:59:46,185 --> 00:59:48,223
there are a few
general comments

1033
00:59:48,288 --> 00:59:51,060
which I am obliged
to make, gentlemen.

1034
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,563
We won a game Sunday

1035
00:59:53,629 --> 00:59:56,400
against an opponent,
measurably and on paper,

1036
00:59:56,464 --> 00:59:58,569
inferior to ours.

1037
00:59:58,634 --> 01:00:00,069
In doing so,

1038
01:00:00,134 --> 01:00:03,074
we managed to play
far below our potential.

1039
01:00:03,138 --> 01:00:07,079
Our punting team gave them
4.5 yards per kick--

1040
01:00:07,142 --> 01:00:08,913
More than
our reasonable goal

1041
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:12,086
and 9.9 yards more
than outstanding.

1042
01:00:12,149 --> 01:00:14,587
That's not the kind
of football

1043
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,590
conference champions play.

1044
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,596
Offense--four turnovers.

1045
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,432
Five scoring
opportunities blown.

1046
01:00:24,665 --> 01:00:27,603
3rd down conversions
we failed six times more

1047
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,605
than our seasonal average.

1048
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,108
Pass completions were 49 %.

1049
01:00:33,507 --> 01:00:36,614
That's 6.3 % less
than reasonable

1050
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:41,621
and it's 19 % less
than our outstanding.

1051
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:46,460
That is a negative 19 %
against Seattle!

1052
01:00:49,626 --> 01:00:52,063
Now, clearly,
it's time for us

1053
01:00:52,129 --> 01:00:54,902
to take a long,
hard look at ourselves,

1054
01:00:54,966 --> 01:00:56,402
and in this connection,

1055
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:58,904
Coach Johnson has
prepared some material

1056
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,910
which I trust will be
beneficial to you.

1057
01:01:03,475 --> 01:01:04,543
Johnson.

1058
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:07,214
Thank you, Coach.

1059
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:09,383
Now, listen, you guys.

1060
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:12,221
If we can take
an extra moment here,

1061
01:01:12,285 --> 01:01:13,221
I'd like to read something

1062
01:01:13,287 --> 01:01:15,724
that B.A. thinks
is pretty important.

1063
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:19,764
When I was playing
college ball at Maryland,

1064
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:22,767
I found this
taped to a locker.

1065
01:01:24,299 --> 01:01:27,239
I think you'll understand
what it means.

1066
01:01:27,303 --> 01:01:29,907
Means he's out
of his fucking mind.

1067
01:01:29,972 --> 01:01:33,746
It means that the difference
between good and great

1068
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:35,581
is that much.

1069
01:01:35,646 --> 01:01:38,418
That's the same size
as his pecker.

1070
01:01:38,482 --> 01:01:40,752
It comes
from right up here.

1071
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,256
Something wrong,
Elliott?

1072
01:01:45,825 --> 01:01:49,199
No, sir. I had something
caught in my throat.

1073
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:52,200
I can't think of anyone
who can use this advice

1074
01:01:52,264 --> 01:01:53,700
better than you can.

1075
01:01:58,606 --> 01:01:59,541
Yes, sir.

1076
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,082
Excuse me,
Coach Johnson.

1077
01:02:08,282 --> 01:02:09,218
Thank you.

1078
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:16,696
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

1079
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,965
Right.

1080
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:21,734
"If you think
you're losing...

1081
01:02:21,799 --> 01:02:23,102
you've lost."

1082
01:02:23,168 --> 01:02:24,203
All right!

1083
01:02:24,269 --> 01:02:26,741
"If you refuse to strive
to the limit,

1084
01:02:26,805 --> 01:02:28,241
the limit's as far
as you'll go."

1085
01:02:28,306 --> 01:02:29,240
Right, sir.

1086
01:02:29,306 --> 01:02:31,244
"Give in
to the fear and pain--"

1087
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:32,744
Talk about
the pain.

1088
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:34,248
Shut up, Delma.

1089
01:02:34,313 --> 01:02:38,020
This ain't exactly
no revival meeting.

1090
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:40,757
You want something
with me, Monroe?

1091
01:02:40,821 --> 01:02:42,991
Hey, cut it out,
you guys!

1092
01:02:44,324 --> 01:02:45,760
I'm sorry, Coach.

1093
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,600
I couldn't--
Go ahead, sir.

1094
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,708
"If you give in
to the fear and pain,

1095
01:02:56,772 --> 01:02:58,743
there are thrills
you'll never know."

1096
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,043
That's right.

1097
01:03:02,313 --> 01:03:05,219
"We have all been
put here by God

1098
01:03:05,284 --> 01:03:08,223
as a test of
our courage and faith.

1099
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:12,763
The rewards
to his warriors are many.

1100
01:03:12,824 --> 01:03:16,732
The rewards to
the losers--disgrace."

1101
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:20,236
"Some say winning's
not every thing,

1102
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:23,741
that competition
has a limited place.

1103
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:27,244
But if that cowardly
slogan is true,

1104
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:30,081
why did God name this...

1105
01:03:30,145 --> 01:03:32,617
the human race?"

1106
01:03:34,317 --> 01:03:36,020
Good question.

1107
01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:38,255
Coach,
would it be OK

1108
01:03:38,321 --> 01:03:40,759
if Jo Bob and I
had a couple copies

1109
01:03:40,823 --> 01:03:41,824
of that poem?

1110
01:03:41,891 --> 01:03:44,263
Yeah,
we'd appreciate that.

1111
01:03:44,328 --> 01:03:45,865
That has to be
one of the most

1112
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,832
inspiring poems
I ever heard, sir.

1113
01:03:48,932 --> 01:03:51,405
Yeah. I'd like one,
too, Coach.

1114
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:52,905
Yeah.
Me, too, Coach.

1115
01:03:52,972 --> 01:03:54,708
Brown noser.

1116
01:03:54,772 --> 01:03:56,610
Yeah. Pussy.

1117
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:59,548
1, 2, 3, 4,

1118
01:03:59,613 --> 01:04:02,953
5, 6, 7, 8,

1119
01:04:03,017 --> 01:04:05,588
9, 10.

1120
01:04:05,652 --> 01:04:07,857
Hold it!

1121
01:04:09,290 --> 01:04:11,662
We count during
this drill, Elliott,

1122
01:04:11,726 --> 01:04:13,161
and you didn't count.

1123
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:15,632
We're going to do it
over again,

1124
01:04:15,697 --> 01:04:17,834
and you can thank Elliott
for the extra work.

1125
01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:20,405
Phil, Phil, Phil,

1126
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:22,539
Phil, Phil, Phil,

1127
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:24,275
Phil, Phil, Phil!

1128
01:04:24,341 --> 01:04:27,247
All right.
Knock that shit off!

1129
01:04:27,312 --> 01:04:28,246
Let's go!

1130
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:29,882
Let's finish up
with 10 jumping jacks.

1131
01:04:29,947 --> 01:04:31,784
Ready? Exercise.

1132
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:35,290
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

1133
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:40,997
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1134
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:43,097
Let's break up
into your groups.

1135
01:04:43,162 --> 01:04:44,599
I wasn't really counting,

1136
01:04:44,665 --> 01:04:46,267
I was just moving
my lips.

1137
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:48,204
You son of a bitch!

1138
01:04:52,539 --> 01:04:54,376
Let's see if you
can catch one.

1139
01:04:54,442 --> 01:04:55,945
Look at Phil.

1140
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:01,785
About time
you caught one.

1141
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:03,186
How are you?

1142
01:05:03,253 --> 01:05:05,189
Hey, Emmett,
how are you?

1143
01:05:05,254 --> 01:05:06,691
Thanks for
inviting me.

1144
01:05:06,756 --> 01:05:07,691
Yeah.

1145
01:05:07,757 --> 01:05:09,360
Sorry to hear
about your daddy.

1146
01:05:09,427 --> 01:05:10,562
Thank you.

1147
01:05:10,627 --> 01:05:13,734
That's the only fight
he ever lost.

1148
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:15,736
When a man
of your daddy's wealth

1149
01:05:15,801 --> 01:05:17,236
dies of cancer,

1150
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:19,974
you know they haven't
found a cure.

1151
01:05:20,038 --> 01:05:21,608
Let's go!

1152
01:05:23,242 --> 01:05:24,979
Come on.
Come on, Delma.

1153
01:05:28,848 --> 01:05:30,819
I'll tell you
if you got hurt.

1154
01:05:30,884 --> 01:05:33,489
Easy, easy.
What is it?

1155
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,256
It's my hamstring.

1156
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:37,260
Did you feel it tear?

1157
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:39,262
No. I heard it pop.

1158
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,763
Take him inside.

1159
01:05:40,829 --> 01:05:42,499
Give me a hand.

1160
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:45,269
I seen better
hands on a clock.

1161
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:47,038
Oh, shit.

1162
01:05:47,104 --> 01:05:49,308
Back to the tub
again, huh, Delma?

1163
01:05:53,546 --> 01:05:55,250
Let's go
to team drill--

1164
01:05:55,316 --> 01:05:56,484
Chicago defense.

1165
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:59,522
Elliott, get back
with the first unit.

1166
01:05:59,586 --> 01:06:00,856
If you moved slower,

1167
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,191
you'd be going
backwards.

1168
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:05,632
Very funny, Elliott.
Very funny.

1169
01:06:05,694 --> 01:06:08,633
One more game and we
take our division.

1170
01:06:08,697 --> 01:06:11,134
That's what makes it
all worthwhile.

1171
01:06:11,202 --> 01:06:12,771
Christ, Con.
You make more

1172
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:15,141
in your manufacturing
division in one week

1173
01:06:15,206 --> 01:06:17,877
than this damned football
team makes in one year,

1174
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:19,378
even if they do win.

1175
01:06:19,445 --> 01:06:20,379
That's true,

1176
01:06:20,446 --> 01:06:22,683
but my manufacturing
division never got

1177
01:06:22,748 --> 01:06:24,917
the cover
of Time magazine.

1178
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:27,253
I'm going all
the way this year.

1179
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:28,756
The big one.
The Super Bowl.

1180
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:30,758
No question
about it.

1181
01:06:30,823 --> 01:06:33,229
The money isn't
every thing.

1182
01:06:33,294 --> 01:06:35,999
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

1183
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,402
It's either pulled
or torn.

1184
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:41,904
We'll know more
tomorrow.

1185
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:44,607
Can you get him
ready for Monday?

1186
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:48,244
Set!

1187
01:06:49,946 --> 01:06:51,515
Hut!

1188
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:53,218
Next play. Next play.

1189
01:06:53,283 --> 01:06:55,220
Break it up.
Come on.

1190
01:06:55,285 --> 01:06:56,287
Shit!

1191
01:06:58,455 --> 01:07:00,760
Give Jo Bob
some work in there.

1192
01:07:06,966 --> 01:07:08,668
3-22.

1193
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,205
3-22.

1194
01:07:11,271 --> 01:07:12,773
Hut! Hut!

1195
01:07:16,775 --> 01:07:18,212
You son of a bitch.

1196
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:21,251
Jo Bob, is that how
you're going to hit

1197
01:07:21,315 --> 01:07:22,350
in Chicago.

1198
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:23,851
Goddamn it, Coach!

1199
01:07:23,917 --> 01:07:25,755
We're supposed to be
doing this half speed.

1200
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,258
I don't want excuses,
just results.

1201
01:07:28,323 --> 01:07:30,894
If you ain't ready,
Weeks will tear off your head

1202
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,262
and crap in your neck.

1203
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:33,430
All right.
Same play, let's go.

1204
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:40,571
3-22.

1205
01:07:40,638 --> 01:07:42,876
Asshole.

1206
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,375
3-22.

1207
01:07:45,676 --> 01:07:46,611
Hut!

1208
01:07:48,078 --> 01:07:51,518
Jo Bob, get your head
out of your ass.

1209
01:07:51,583 --> 01:07:53,220
Son of a bitch!

1210
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:54,888
Bring it up
to full speed.

1211
01:07:54,953 --> 01:07:57,425
All your teammates would love
a live scrimmage.

1212
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:00,230
Let's do it again,
and do it right.

1213
01:08:00,294 --> 01:08:02,899
Get your fucking ass
back on the line.

1214
01:08:02,963 --> 01:08:05,233
Fuck you, asshole.

1215
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:07,336
Huddle up.

1216
01:08:09,938 --> 01:08:11,240
You cocksucker.

1217
01:08:11,306 --> 01:08:13,577
Your mama was
the best teacher.

1218
01:08:18,847 --> 01:08:20,283
They're
fired up now.

1219
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,523
Oh, yeah. They're
going to ream Chicago.

1220
01:09:04,267 --> 01:09:05,203
That's enough.

1221
01:09:07,371 --> 01:09:09,108
OK. Break it up.

1222
01:09:09,173 --> 01:09:10,608
Break it up.

1223
01:09:10,675 --> 01:09:13,313
Break it up.

1224
01:09:13,378 --> 01:09:14,313
OK, OK.

1225
01:09:14,379 --> 01:09:16,517
All right, gentlemen.
All right.

1226
01:09:16,582 --> 01:09:18,753
Everyone at the airport
at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1227
01:09:24,491 --> 01:09:26,662
Elliott, I'd like
to see you, please.

1228
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:37,441
Walk with me, Phil.

1229
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,111
How's the knee?

1230
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:42,611
Great. Feels
real good.

1231
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,614
You're limping.

1232
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,620
That's just habit,
but, uh, feels good.

1233
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:52,459
Phil, I'm going to
need you in Chicago.

1234
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:56,963
Delma's pulled
his hamstring again,

1235
01:09:57,028 --> 01:09:58,296
and you know Delma.

1236
01:09:58,363 --> 01:10:00,901
He can't stand pain.

1237
01:10:00,965 --> 01:10:03,571
He'll say
it hurts too much,

1238
01:10:03,637 --> 01:10:05,506
but he doesn't like
to use the needles.

1239
01:10:07,873 --> 01:10:09,008
So...

1240
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:14,818
can I count on you,
Phil, and your knee

1241
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:16,451
for the entire game?

1242
01:10:27,663 --> 01:10:30,002
B.A., you can always
count on me

1243
01:10:30,066 --> 01:10:33,005
to do whatever
it takes to play.

1244
01:10:34,706 --> 01:10:36,175
Hell, I love needles.

1245
01:10:42,782 --> 01:10:45,187
I guess that's what
we call maturity.

1246
01:10:47,653 --> 01:10:48,722
Huh?

1247
01:10:51,357 --> 01:10:52,293
Yeow!

1248
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:26,432
It's beautiful.

1249
01:11:26,497 --> 01:11:28,335
Yeah, really...

1250
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,869
really beautiful.

1251
01:11:31,905 --> 01:11:34,845
Come on. Let's
go into the house.

1252
01:11:34,909 --> 01:11:35,843
OK.

1253
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:37,346
Into the living room.

1254
01:11:37,411 --> 01:11:38,846
Ah, through the wall.

1255
01:11:38,913 --> 01:11:40,348
Yeah.

1256
01:11:40,413 --> 01:11:41,850
All right.

1257
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:43,185
Now...

1258
01:11:44,419 --> 01:11:45,854
uh... um...

1259
01:11:45,921 --> 01:11:49,796
uh, this is
as far as I've got.

1260
01:11:49,859 --> 01:11:53,733
How long did it take you
to get this far?

1261
01:11:53,796 --> 01:11:56,869
Oh, about uh...

1262
01:11:59,102 --> 01:12:00,471
three years.

1263
01:12:04,877 --> 01:12:06,813
Anyway, I got 20 acres,

1264
01:12:06,878 --> 01:12:08,816
and it runs
along that gully,

1265
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:11,821
and it goes
back in that valley.

1266
01:12:11,885 --> 01:12:13,320
Oh, God,
it's magnificent.

1267
01:12:13,385 --> 01:12:16,325
Yeah. That's where I'm
going to have the horses.

1268
01:12:16,389 --> 01:12:19,328
I think you should
finish it though.

1269
01:12:19,392 --> 01:12:21,829
I am going to finish it.

1270
01:12:47,626 --> 01:12:48,794
Ta-da!

1271
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,830
Made with
my own fair hands.

1272
01:12:50,896 --> 01:12:50,896
Oh, great.

1273
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:55,005
I'll get the wine.

1274
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,505
Get the salad.

1275
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:58,009
OK. Excuse me.

1276
01:12:58,074 --> 01:12:59,509
Well, excuse me.

1277
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:01,514
I need all the room here.

1278
01:13:01,579 --> 01:13:03,515
You've got
all the room.

1279
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,019
What are we going
to do about napkins?

1280
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,519
Use the toilet paper.

1281
01:13:07,586 --> 01:13:08,521
Oh, Chic.

1282
01:13:08,587 --> 01:13:09,855
Chic.

1283
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,692
Listen, uh...

1284
01:13:15,795 --> 01:13:18,233
do you think
this raising horses

1285
01:13:18,297 --> 01:13:20,734
is just a dream of mine?

1286
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,237
I don't know. Maybe.

1287
01:13:22,302 --> 01:13:24,238
It doesn't
seem very real.

1288
01:13:24,303 --> 01:13:25,239
Yeah?

1289
01:13:25,305 --> 01:13:27,008
Come on.

1290
01:13:29,711 --> 01:13:31,916
Hey!
You like burned steak?

1291
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,028
Hey,
you know something?

1292
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:47,766
When I'm with you,
my mind's

1293
01:13:47,832 --> 01:13:50,204
a million miles
away from football.

1294
01:13:50,268 --> 01:13:52,206
I feel free.

1295
01:13:52,271 --> 01:13:54,207
Sounds like you're
tired of football.

1296
01:13:54,272 --> 01:13:56,710
Well, if I was,
I wouldn't admit it.

1297
01:13:56,775 --> 01:13:59,214
That would scare
the hell out of me.

1298
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:01,215
Here, you
want some wine?

1299
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,382
Yeah.

1300
01:14:05,285 --> 01:14:08,224
I'm scared to death
most of the time anyhow.

1301
01:14:08,288 --> 01:14:09,725
Scared of what?

1302
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,727
Of injury,
of playing badly,

1303
01:14:11,792 --> 01:14:14,732
anything that can knock
me out of the game.

1304
01:14:14,796 --> 01:14:16,231
You don't act like it.

1305
01:14:16,297 --> 01:14:18,001
Yeah. I don't dare.

1306
01:14:19,801 --> 01:14:23,241
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

1307
01:14:23,305 --> 01:14:24,742
Then what?

1308
01:14:24,808 --> 01:14:26,744
Oh, come on, Charlotte,
that's serious.

1309
01:14:26,809 --> 01:14:29,749
I don't want
to get into that.

1310
01:14:29,813 --> 01:14:31,249
For Christ's sake!

1311
01:14:31,315 --> 01:14:32,751
Let's don't
talk about football.

1312
01:14:32,817 --> 01:14:34,754
I'm starting Monday.

1313
01:14:34,819 --> 01:14:37,425
Everything in my life's
just great.

1314
01:14:37,489 --> 01:14:39,258
We got any butter?

1315
01:14:39,324 --> 01:14:41,762
Well, I don't think
it's great.

1316
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:44,767
You know, I saw you
the other night.

1317
01:14:44,831 --> 01:14:48,205
You were in so much pain
you couldn't sleep.

1318
01:14:48,268 --> 01:14:50,705
Your body's
twisted and scarred.

1319
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:52,206
You're
drugging yourself.

1320
01:14:52,273 --> 01:14:55,212
Hey, listen, that's just part
of the game, Charlotte.

1321
01:14:55,276 --> 01:14:56,277
Game?

1322
01:14:56,344 --> 01:14:58,782
You call men smashing
each other a game?

1323
01:14:58,847 --> 01:15:00,450
For Christ's sake!

1324
01:15:00,515 --> 01:15:01,951
You can't judge!

1325
01:15:02,018 --> 01:15:04,455
You live in a little house
secure with your Texas money,

1326
01:15:04,519 --> 01:15:06,523
what the hell
do you know about it?

1327
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:07,891
You live
in an unreal world!

1328
01:15:07,957 --> 01:15:09,126
If football's
the real world,

1329
01:15:09,192 --> 01:15:10,527
I don't want
any part of it!

1330
01:15:10,593 --> 01:15:12,030
It scares me.

1331
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:14,534
Well, good.
It's not your life.

1332
01:15:14,598 --> 01:15:15,701
It's mine.

1333
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:19,905
Come on, let's eat.

1334
01:15:25,343 --> 01:15:27,281
Why don't you
build your ranch

1335
01:15:27,346 --> 01:15:28,781
instead of
dreaming about it?

1336
01:15:28,848 --> 01:15:31,286
Maybe I like it better
as a fantasy.

1337
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:32,787
The payments are lower.

1338
01:15:32,854 --> 01:15:36,294
And you accuse me
of living in a dream world.

1339
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:39,797
Look, I got to keep
my mind in the game.

1340
01:15:39,862 --> 01:15:42,299
I don't want
to get confused now,

1341
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:43,799
so drop it!

1342
01:16:04,323 --> 01:16:07,261
Why don't you
watch the game?

1343
01:16:07,325 --> 01:16:09,496
I'll do something
special for you

1344
01:16:09,561 --> 01:16:10,829
in Chicago.

1345
01:16:16,336 --> 01:16:19,276
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

1346
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:20,775
Hey, Phil,
what's happening?

1347
01:16:20,841 --> 01:16:22,779
What are you doing
here early, man?

1348
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,279
I got butterflies.

1349
01:16:24,345 --> 01:16:26,783
I couldn't sit
around the hotel.

1350
01:16:26,848 --> 01:16:29,788
Where in the hell
is Jo Bob and O.W.?

1351
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:32,290
They were in a cab
right behind me.

1352
01:16:32,355 --> 01:16:33,790
I told you boys

1353
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:35,794
when you got special
taping to do,

1354
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:37,294
get to the stadium early.

1355
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,364
Maybe I ought to
start getting here

1356
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:41,299
the night before.

1357
01:16:41,365 --> 01:16:43,803
Come on, Frank!
What are you doing?

1358
01:16:43,868 --> 01:16:45,806
We got an important
ball game.

1359
01:16:45,871 --> 01:16:47,807
You tape
my left ankle first.

1360
01:16:47,873 --> 01:16:50,245
You tying to
put the hex on me?

1361
01:16:50,309 --> 01:16:51,744
You old fart.

1362
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:54,715
I'll tape that knee
after the doctor checks it.

1363
01:16:57,817 --> 01:16:59,755
You don't look
healthy at all.

1364
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,389
Yeah. I hurt myself.

1365
01:17:03,724 --> 01:17:05,160
I'll catch you later.

1366
01:17:05,227 --> 01:17:06,663
Have a good ball game.

1367
01:17:06,728 --> 01:17:07,663
Yeah. You, too.

1368
01:17:30,221 --> 01:17:31,758
Oh, yeah.

1369
01:17:57,187 --> 01:17:59,124
Jo Bob,
this is it, babe.

1370
01:17:59,189 --> 01:18:01,126
This is what
we want.

1371
01:18:01,191 --> 01:18:03,129
What are we
going to do?

1372
01:18:03,194 --> 01:18:05,130
We're going
to kick their butts.

1373
01:18:05,195 --> 01:18:07,634
We know how
to kick their butts.

1374
01:18:07,698 --> 01:18:10,637
We'll do it very roughly,
with no respect.

1375
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:12,136
We're going
to do it.

1376
01:18:12,205 --> 01:18:13,640
We're going
to get them!

1377
01:18:13,705 --> 01:18:15,643
We're going
to get them!

1378
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:17,010
Yes.

1379
01:18:17,076 --> 01:18:18,878
I mean Weeks now.

1380
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,381
Where's my locker?

1381
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,382
Get your jock on, babe.

1382
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:25,985
Phil, what is it?

1383
01:18:26,054 --> 01:18:27,155
The knee.

1384
01:18:27,222 --> 01:18:28,657
The knee, huh?
Let's have a look.

1385
01:18:31,525 --> 01:18:32,962
Tell me when.

1386
01:18:34,896 --> 01:18:35,831
Oh!

1387
01:18:35,897 --> 01:18:37,768
Ah ah ah ah.

1388
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,904
X marks the spot.

1389
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:42,908
Hey, baby, you going
to make it tonight?

1390
01:18:42,972 --> 01:18:44,408
I don't think so.

1391
01:18:44,473 --> 01:18:45,909
We need you, man.

1392
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:48,915
Yeah. Frank, can I
get this hot packed?

1393
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:50,550
You got it, babe.

1394
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,687
Hey, is this it?
Here?

1395
01:18:54,752 --> 01:18:56,188
Yeah, that's it.

1396
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,358
Hold on.

1397
01:18:59,057 --> 01:19:00,995
Come on, Delma,
lift it up.

1398
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:07,907
No? Tell him.

1399
01:19:07,968 --> 01:19:09,170
OK.

1400
01:19:14,743 --> 01:19:17,747
OK, here we go.

1401
01:19:22,318 --> 01:19:24,155
Ooh, Jesus.

1402
01:19:26,656 --> 01:19:27,958
No, wait a second.

1403
01:19:29,293 --> 01:19:31,497
Just wait a second.

1404
01:19:32,829 --> 01:19:33,931
Say when.

1405
01:19:33,997 --> 01:19:36,035
All right. Not yet.

1406
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:40,508
Goddamn it!
Jesus, it burns.

1407
01:19:43,008 --> 01:19:45,312
Goddamn!

1408
01:19:45,377 --> 01:19:48,250
Christ, how often
do you put this shit

1409
01:19:48,315 --> 01:19:49,751
in the coaches' hearts?

1410
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:51,952
There.

1411
01:19:52,018 --> 01:19:53,154
Whew.

1412
01:19:54,955 --> 01:19:58,496
Now that wasn't
bad, was it?

1413
01:19:58,559 --> 01:20:00,496
Oh, no.
I loved it.

1414
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,034
There.
Now try it.

1415
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:08,538
How does
it feel?

1416
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,841
It's numb.

1417
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:12,075
Good, good.

1418
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,579
It's a brand-new
knee, Doc.

1419
01:20:14,645 --> 01:20:16,914
Better football
through chemistry, huh?

1420
01:20:23,927 --> 01:20:27,132
Hey, Delma,
using the heat, huh?

1421
01:20:27,196 --> 01:20:29,134
You must
be feeling better.

1422
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,637
No, Coach,
it feels real bad.

1423
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,642
I don't think
I can make it.

1424
01:20:34,706 --> 01:20:36,175
Come on,
you saw Elliott.

1425
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:37,576
He was hurting, too,

1426
01:20:37,641 --> 01:20:41,584
but he has the guts to do
what it takes when we need him.

1427
01:20:41,647 --> 01:20:43,082
If I shoot up

1428
01:20:43,148 --> 01:20:45,086
I could hurt myself
real bad.

1429
01:20:45,151 --> 01:20:46,253
I don't mess
with needles.

1430
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:47,587
You don't feel
anything.

1431
01:20:47,653 --> 01:20:50,025
I could tear my
hamstring to bits.

1432
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:53,030
Isn't it time you thought
about the team?

1433
01:20:53,094 --> 01:20:54,529
Now you listen, Delma.

1434
01:20:54,594 --> 01:20:56,231
You can't make it
in this league

1435
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:57,667
if you don't know
the difference

1436
01:20:57,732 --> 01:20:58,668
between pain and injury.

1437
01:21:01,169 --> 01:21:02,338
Hey...

1438
01:21:04,206 --> 01:21:06,144
I'm just tying to help.

1439
01:21:14,785 --> 01:21:15,888
Fuck it.

1440
01:21:16,054 --> 01:21:17,389
Come on, you guys.

1441
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:20,394
Stop playing grab ass
and get ready.

1442
01:21:29,836 --> 01:21:31,772
I want to hit somebody!

1443
01:21:31,837 --> 01:21:33,274
Use some of that.

1444
01:21:33,341 --> 01:21:35,343
Hit somebody!

1445
01:21:35,409 --> 01:21:37,046
I want to hit...

1446
01:21:37,111 --> 01:21:38,213
hit...

1447
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:39,481
hit...

1448
01:21:39,547 --> 01:21:41,485
Give me some,
too, man.

1449
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:45,522
That's good.

1450
01:21:47,890 --> 01:21:50,227
When Weeks starts
looping over the middle,

1451
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:51,294
what are you gonna do?

1452
01:21:51,361 --> 01:21:52,596
I'll stay at home.

1453
01:21:52,661 --> 01:21:54,098
OK, no problem
there.

1454
01:21:54,165 --> 01:21:55,267
That's right.

1455
01:21:57,502 --> 01:21:59,438
You know who that is?

1456
01:22:01,706 --> 01:22:03,342
That's Alcie Weeks, baby.

1457
01:22:03,408 --> 01:22:04,342
He's ugly.

1458
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:05,712
He's the ugliest man
I ever seen,

1459
01:22:05,777 --> 01:22:07,246
and I don't want
none of his ugly

1460
01:22:07,312 --> 01:22:09,183
rubbing off
on my pretty face.

1461
01:22:09,248 --> 01:22:10,350
All right.

1462
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:13,355
Knock his cock in
his watch pocket, Jo Bob.

1463
01:22:13,419 --> 01:22:14,521
All right.

1464
01:22:14,587 --> 01:22:16,391
I want him walking
on his elbows

1465
01:22:16,457 --> 01:22:17,525
in the morning, Jo Bob.

1466
01:22:17,591 --> 01:22:18,694
He will.

1467
01:22:18,759 --> 01:22:21,697
What you going
to do to him, Jo Bob?

1468
01:22:34,276 --> 01:22:37,216
He'll be eating him up
all night long.

1469
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,382
My man.

1470
01:22:38,448 --> 01:22:41,922
You'll be eating
his ass up.

1471
01:22:41,985 --> 01:22:43,923
Just like white
on rice,

1472
01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:46,927
you'll be sticking
to him, Jo Bob.

1473
01:22:46,991 --> 01:22:48,861
I'm going to get him.

1474
01:22:48,926 --> 01:22:50,864
We're going
to do it.

1475
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:52,131
All night long,
Jo Bob.

1476
01:22:52,197 --> 01:22:53,266
They say
he's the best.

1477
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,368
He ain't the best.

1478
01:22:54,434 --> 01:22:55,536
He's nothing.

1479
01:22:55,602 --> 01:22:56,705
He's nothing.

1480
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:58,707
You can be the best.

1481
01:22:58,772 --> 01:23:00,208
You are the best.

1482
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:01,709
It's time
to get down.

1483
01:23:01,775 --> 01:23:03,210
Let's pad up, man.

1484
01:23:03,276 --> 01:23:04,379
Get down.

1485
01:23:04,445 --> 01:23:05,881
Let's get ready now.

1486
01:23:05,946 --> 01:23:07,049
All right.

1487
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:08,484
You ready?
Let's pad up.

1488
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,985
Where's my locker?

1489
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:11,387
Right behind you.

1490
01:23:17,728 --> 01:23:18,663
Hey, Hartman,

1491
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:19,864
while you're at it,

1492
01:23:19,929 --> 01:23:23,036
why don't you ask the man
about the point spread?

1493
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,169
Pussy.

1494
01:23:32,645 --> 01:23:33,880
Well, all right.

1495
01:23:33,945 --> 01:23:36,684
No wonder they call it
The Windy City.

1496
01:23:36,749 --> 01:23:38,186
Hey, baby. Cook.

1497
01:23:38,251 --> 01:23:40,688
Save some for the party.

1498
01:23:40,754 --> 01:23:43,326
You've got a face
like a baby's butt.

1499
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,325
Thank you, Seth.

1500
01:23:44,391 --> 01:23:45,360
Beautiful.

1501
01:23:48,664 --> 01:23:50,333
OK. Wait a minute.

1502
01:23:50,398 --> 01:23:52,836
I'm going to get
the bastard for this.

1503
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:53,835
All right.

1504
01:23:53,901 --> 01:23:55,338
Mother clotheslined
me last time.

1505
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:57,642
I'm going
to tear his ass up.

1506
01:23:57,707 --> 01:23:59,010
I lost 4 fucking teeth.

1507
01:23:59,075 --> 01:24:00,577
I'm going
to tear his ass up.

1508
01:24:09,488 --> 01:24:10,857
10 minutes!

1509
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:12,256
10 minutes!

1510
01:24:30,512 --> 01:24:31,881
You ready, baby?

1511
01:24:31,945 --> 01:24:33,213
Alan,
I can't fumble.

1512
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,518
You saw what they
did to Stallings.

1513
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:37,988
Hey.
You'll be all right.

1514
01:24:38,052 --> 01:24:39,053
OK?

1515
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:42,391
Give me a hit.

1516
01:24:44,461 --> 01:24:45,396
Ready?

1517
01:24:47,698 --> 01:24:48,900
Yeah.

1518
01:24:51,402 --> 01:24:52,437
Thank you.

1519
01:24:55,907 --> 01:24:57,109
Can't fumble.

1520
01:24:58,911 --> 01:25:00,546
Can't fumble
the football.

1521
01:25:10,424 --> 01:25:11,358
All right.

1522
01:25:11,424 --> 01:25:12,861
Have
a good game.

1523
01:25:12,927 --> 01:25:13,861
All right.

1524
01:25:13,928 --> 01:25:16,867
Let's go, Jo Bob.
Let's get them.

1525
01:25:45,364 --> 01:25:46,667
How's that,
Mark?

1526
01:25:46,733 --> 01:25:47,901
Little
more air, Keith.

1527
01:25:47,967 --> 01:25:50,639
Why don't you pump up his ass
and blow his brains out?

1528
01:25:50,704 --> 01:25:51,705
Up yours, asshole.

1529
01:25:51,771 --> 01:25:52,973
Fuck you.

1530
01:25:53,038 --> 01:25:54,342
Five minutes!

1531
01:25:54,408 --> 01:25:55,843
How long, Coach?

1532
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:57,848
Five--fuck you!

1533
01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:02,856
All right, settle down.

1534
01:26:02,922 --> 01:26:04,425
Listen up.

1535
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,227
Out with the cigarettes.

1536
01:26:06,292 --> 01:26:07,261
Coach.

1537
01:26:08,929 --> 01:26:10,900
Just one reminder,
gentlemen.

1538
01:26:10,964 --> 01:26:13,368
Please remember
to take off your helmets

1539
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,372
when they play
the national anthem.

1540
01:26:15,437 --> 01:26:17,642
Also remember you're
on national TV,

1541
01:26:17,707 --> 01:26:19,911
so don't pick your noses
or scratch your nuts.

1542
01:26:21,811 --> 01:26:23,514
Excuse me,
Coach Johnson.

1543
01:26:27,149 --> 01:26:29,954
Mr. Hunter would like to say
a few words to you now.

1544
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:32,492
Thank you, B.A.

1545
01:26:32,557 --> 01:26:33,659
Men...

1546
01:26:33,725 --> 01:26:36,163
I want you
to win this game

1547
01:26:36,227 --> 01:26:38,163
for our fans,
for Dallas,

1548
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:40,667
for me and
my little brother.

1549
01:26:41,735 --> 01:26:43,370
Not necessarily
in that order.

1550
01:26:45,839 --> 01:26:47,676
If we win
this game,

1551
01:26:47,741 --> 01:26:49,644
you're all invited
to spend a weekend

1552
01:26:49,709 --> 01:26:51,112
with your wives
and families

1553
01:26:51,177 --> 01:26:53,615
at my private island
in the Caribbean.

1554
01:26:55,515 --> 01:26:57,519
Bullshit.

1555
01:26:57,585 --> 01:26:58,520
And remember,

1556
01:26:58,586 --> 01:27:01,258
the eyes of Texas
are on you.

1557
01:27:07,095 --> 01:27:08,398
Knock that
shit off.

1558
01:27:10,868 --> 01:27:12,070
Monsignor.

1559
01:27:17,141 --> 01:27:18,076
Dear Lord,

1560
01:27:18,142 --> 01:27:20,647
I ask your blessing
on these brave boys

1561
01:27:20,712 --> 01:27:22,582
as they venture
out to battle.

1562
01:27:22,647 --> 01:27:23,983
Take off your
fucking hats.

1563
01:27:25,049 --> 01:27:26,151
Sorry, Monsignor.

1564
01:27:27,853 --> 01:27:30,659
We ask not for victory,

1565
01:27:30,724 --> 01:27:32,493
not for glory,

1566
01:27:32,559 --> 01:27:34,262
not for fame.

1567
01:27:34,327 --> 01:27:37,167
We ask only
for the preservation

1568
01:27:37,231 --> 01:27:38,666
of our bodies

1569
01:27:38,733 --> 01:27:41,605
and of our minds.

1570
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:45,176
Bless also
the entire Hunter family

1571
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:48,112
who have so
unselfishly given us

1572
01:27:48,177 --> 01:27:50,648
every thing
we need for victory,

1573
01:27:50,712 --> 01:27:52,148
except our efforts

1574
01:27:52,215 --> 01:27:55,120
in the spirit
of sportsmanship,

1575
01:27:55,185 --> 01:27:56,620
with Thy guidance,

1576
01:27:56,686 --> 01:27:59,225
Thy kingdom,
power, and glory

1577
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:01,326
for evermore.

1578
01:28:01,391 --> 01:28:02,561
Amen.

1579
01:28:02,627 --> 01:28:03,627
- Amen.
- Amen

1580
01:28:03,694 --> 01:28:05,165
let's go kill
those cocksuckers!

1581
01:28:25,118 --> 01:28:26,087
Elliott?

1582
01:28:26,154 --> 01:28:27,089
Yeah?

1583
01:28:27,155 --> 01:28:28,757
I'm starting Delma,
but you stay up.

1584
01:28:28,823 --> 01:28:30,627
Be ready when I need you.

1585
01:28:39,235 --> 01:28:40,671
He said he's
starting Delma.

1586
01:28:40,738 --> 01:28:41,672
I heard.

1587
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:42,773
But I thought--

1588
01:28:42,839 --> 01:28:45,779
I can't worry
about that now.

1589
01:28:45,843 --> 01:28:47,346
You
just be ready.

1590
01:29:09,436 --> 01:29:11,207
With less
than two minutes left

1591
01:29:11,273 --> 01:29:13,210
this might be it
for North Dallas.

1592
01:29:13,275 --> 01:29:14,611
Chicago
leading 14-7.

1593
01:29:14,677 --> 01:29:17,014
North Dallas is
on the Chicago 25.

1594
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:18,182
1st and 10.

1595
01:29:18,247 --> 01:29:19,482
Nail-biting time for the fans.

1596
01:29:19,548 --> 01:29:21,219
But it is suck-it-up
time for the players

1597
01:29:21,285 --> 01:29:23,187
because they have
to score on this drive.

1598
01:29:23,252 --> 01:29:24,689
Seth Maxwell fakes.

1599
01:29:24,756 --> 01:29:26,191
Hands off
to Andy Melbourne

1600
01:29:26,256 --> 01:29:28,025
and he's down for
a three-yard loss

1601
01:29:28,093 --> 01:29:29,194
by Alcie Weeks.

1602
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:31,062
They haven't kept
Weeks out all night.

1603
01:29:31,129 --> 01:29:33,100
He has been in that
backfield all day.

1604
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:34,433
They should
give him a uniform

1605
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:36,237
they way he plays in
the North Dallas backfield.

1606
01:29:36,302 --> 01:29:38,874
It'll be a 3-yard loss.
The clock is running.

1607
01:29:38,939 --> 01:29:40,374
I wonder what
they're saying

1608
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:42,010
as far as strategy
is concerned

1609
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:44,513
in the North Dallas
huddle?

1610
01:29:44,577 --> 01:29:46,180
Jo Bob, when you get through
titty blocking Weeks,

1611
01:29:46,246 --> 01:29:47,414
why don't you
hit the fucker?

1612
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:49,051
Why don't you
go fuck yourself?

1613
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:51,588
Just hang on to the ball.
We'll take care of up front.

1614
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:52,955
Fuck you, psycho!

1615
01:29:53,021 --> 01:29:54,623
Just get
the fucking ball

1616
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:56,193
across the line
of scrimmage.

1617
01:29:56,258 --> 01:29:58,395
You're a pain
in the ass!

1618
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:59,996
Shut the fuck up!

1619
01:30:00,063 --> 01:30:03,270
Nobody talks in this
fucking huddle except me.

1620
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:05,136
Jo Bob, O.W.,
goddamn it,

1621
01:30:05,202 --> 01:30:06,638
I cannot
throw the football

1622
01:30:06,704 --> 01:30:09,141
with these guys
hanging all over my ass.

1623
01:30:09,206 --> 01:30:12,146
Fitch, I want
a wing-quick-burst.

1624
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,146
All right.

1625
01:30:13,212 --> 01:30:15,148
Red-right-76 on two.

1626
01:30:15,213 --> 01:30:16,148
Ready?

1627
01:30:16,214 --> 01:30:17,350
Break!
Break!

1628
01:30:17,415 --> 01:30:20,221
Weeks, this time I'm fucking
going to kill you.

1629
01:30:25,558 --> 01:30:27,529
Hey, Jo Bob.

1630
01:30:27,594 --> 01:30:28,929
You're looking lousy.

1631
01:30:28,996 --> 01:30:31,301
You're getting old.
I hate to do it,

1632
01:30:31,365 --> 01:30:35,307
but I'm going to put
your dick all in the dirt.

1633
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:36,305
Set!

1634
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:44,047
4-48.

1635
01:30:44,113 --> 01:30:45,917
4-48.

1636
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:46,917
Hut!

1637
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,052
Hut!

1638
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:49,621
Maxwell's
in a shotgun formation.

1639
01:30:49,686 --> 01:30:51,121
He fades to pass...

1640
01:30:51,187 --> 01:30:54,127
what a rush by Weeks,
who dumps him.

1641
01:30:54,191 --> 01:30:55,360
The pass is off,
though.

1642
01:30:55,426 --> 01:30:57,496
Fitch, streaking down
the middle, is in the open.

1643
01:30:57,561 --> 01:30:59,632
Drop it.

1644
01:30:59,698 --> 01:31:01,333
The pass is no good.

1645
01:31:03,036 --> 01:31:06,008
Come on, Fitch!
Concentrate!

1646
01:31:11,544 --> 01:31:13,147
Are you OK, baby?

1647
01:31:13,214 --> 01:31:14,148
Hey, Weeks!

1648
01:31:14,214 --> 01:31:15,751
The clock is stopped.

1649
01:31:15,817 --> 01:31:17,352
And now an altercation

1650
01:31:17,418 --> 01:31:19,623
breaks out
on the field.

1651
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:24,662
I can understand
why tempers are a little hot,

1652
01:31:24,726 --> 01:31:26,664
because
the game's winding down.

1653
01:31:26,729 --> 01:31:28,799
Maxwell's asking
for a time out

1654
01:31:28,864 --> 01:31:31,169
although the clock
is stopped.

1655
01:31:31,234 --> 01:31:34,040
We've got less than
a minute to play.

1656
01:31:34,105 --> 01:31:37,044
Maxwell coming to
talk to his coach.

1657
01:31:37,108 --> 01:31:39,545
You have to think
now that Chicago

1658
01:31:39,609 --> 01:31:40,645
will drop back
on defense

1659
01:31:40,711 --> 01:31:41,979
and be in
a prevent defense

1660
01:31:42,046 --> 01:31:45,319
because North Dallas
to win this game

1661
01:31:45,383 --> 01:31:47,287
will have to keep
it in the air.

1662
01:31:47,352 --> 01:31:50,726
This is the last time out
that North Dallas has.

1663
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:52,225
They're probably
figuring out strategy

1664
01:31:52,292 --> 01:31:55,132
that will allow them to run
3 or 4 plays in a row.

1665
01:31:55,196 --> 01:31:57,634
They have very little time left
if they're going to score.

1666
01:31:57,698 --> 01:31:59,635
Maxwell is signaling
to Phil Elliott

1667
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:03,140
to come
into the ball game.

1668
01:32:03,205 --> 01:32:06,645
I'll go with Elliott
and Huddle as wide receivers.

1669
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:10,215
And we're going to look
for some pass plays.

1670
01:32:13,216 --> 01:32:14,653
Having fun, boys?

1671
01:32:14,718 --> 01:32:16,153
Blow it
out your ass.

1672
01:32:17,787 --> 01:32:19,158
How's the leg,
Del?

1673
01:32:19,224 --> 01:32:20,426
Like your knee.

1674
01:32:20,491 --> 01:32:22,061
I can't
feel anything.

1675
01:32:22,127 --> 01:32:23,897
All right, huddle up!

1676
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:29,336
Jo Bob, I ain't
losing this game.

1677
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,773
I'm tired of Weeks sitting
on my face all night.

1678
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:34,175
But
I hurt, Seth.

1679
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:35,777
I hurt bad.

1680
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:38,580
I don't give a shit.
We all hurt.

1681
01:32:38,644 --> 01:32:40,682
Let's trap
the son of a bitch.

1682
01:32:40,747 --> 01:32:43,219
O.W.,Jo Bob, break his
fucking leg if you have to.

1683
01:32:43,284 --> 01:32:44,687
I want him out of there.

1684
01:32:44,752 --> 01:32:45,788
All right?

1685
01:32:45,854 --> 01:32:47,356
Green-right-C-motion.

1686
01:32:47,421 --> 01:32:50,059
41 -trap-delay on three.

1687
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:51,060
Ready?

1688
01:32:51,126 --> 01:32:52,261
Break!
Break!

1689
01:32:52,327 --> 01:32:54,098
Maxwell brings
them out of the huddle.

1690
01:32:54,164 --> 01:32:55,900
You know Chicago's gonna
be coming on this play.

1691
01:32:55,964 --> 01:32:59,137
Let's see if they've
come up with a good play.

1692
01:32:59,202 --> 01:33:01,875
I wonder if Maxwell
called it or the coach.

1693
01:33:01,939 --> 01:33:03,375
Huddle lines up
on their left

1694
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,875
and Maxwell
down under center.

1695
01:33:04,942 --> 01:33:08,149
The clock won't start
till the snap of the ball.

1696
01:33:08,213 --> 01:33:10,718
Huddle's in motion
to the right.

1697
01:33:11,783 --> 01:33:13,654
Back to pass
is Maxwell.

1698
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:15,154
It's a draw play
ball fake.

1699
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:22,263
Suck
on that, Weeks.

1700
01:33:22,329 --> 01:33:24,000
Weeks,
the big defensive tackle

1701
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:25,200
for Chicago is down.

1702
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,671
This could be a serious blow
to the Marauders chances

1703
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:30,673
if he is
out of the game.

1704
01:33:30,739 --> 01:33:32,441
North Dallas not only
gets a first down,

1705
01:33:32,507 --> 01:33:33,942
the clock
is stopped.

1706
01:33:34,008 --> 01:33:34,008
It looks like he got
hurt in a trap block

1707
01:33:36,383 --> 01:33:37,184
It looks like he got
hurt in a trap block

1708
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:39,488
by Jo Bob Priddy
and O.W. Shaddock.

1709
01:33:39,552 --> 01:33:42,024
Weeks had been beating
those two all night

1710
01:33:42,089 --> 01:33:43,692
and they finally
got back at him.

1711
01:33:43,758 --> 01:33:46,263
And a big first down
for North Dallas.

1712
01:33:46,328 --> 01:33:49,201
Jesus, Jo Bob, we
hurt him bad, man.

1713
01:33:49,265 --> 01:33:50,265
Fuck him.

1714
01:33:51,968 --> 01:33:53,570
Fuck him.

1715
01:33:53,635 --> 01:33:55,006
Huddle up.

1716
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,039
Huddle up!

1717
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:01,045
Aah!

1718
01:34:06,217 --> 01:34:09,157
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

1719
01:34:09,221 --> 01:34:11,158
Can you get the outside
linebacker, Phil?

1720
01:34:11,223 --> 01:34:14,162
Del, it's your chance
to be a star.

1721
01:34:14,226 --> 01:34:15,428
Red-lax-92.

1722
01:34:15,494 --> 01:34:16,663
First sound,
all right?

1723
01:34:16,729 --> 01:34:17,664
Ready?

1724
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:19,132
Break!
Break!

1725
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:21,136
North Dallas has the ball

1726
01:34:21,201 --> 01:34:23,172
18 yards away
from a touchdown

1727
01:34:23,237 --> 01:34:25,674
but they have only 24 seconds
left in the game.

1728
01:34:25,739 --> 01:34:28,177
They have to score
if they're going to tie

1729
01:34:28,242 --> 01:34:30,146
this championship contest up
and send it into overtime.

1730
01:34:30,212 --> 01:34:32,182
Maxwell sends Huddle
and Elliott to the left

1731
01:34:32,247 --> 01:34:34,685
so they overload
Chicago's right side

1732
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:36,185
on 1st and 10.

1733
01:34:36,251 --> 01:34:37,687
Back to pass,
Maxwell.

1734
01:34:37,754 --> 01:34:40,593
And the pass is to
Huddle on the sidelines.

1735
01:34:40,657 --> 01:34:42,994
There's a flag down
and Huddle is hurt.

1736
01:34:43,059 --> 01:34:45,999
Oh, what a hit
from the secondary!

1737
01:34:46,063 --> 01:34:48,000
Let's check
the penalty marker.

1738
01:34:48,065 --> 01:34:49,935
The indication
from the official

1739
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,006
is offensive holding
against the Bulls.

1740
01:34:53,071 --> 01:34:55,008
So instead of a gain
for Huddle,

1741
01:34:55,074 --> 01:34:58,013
it will be
a 10-yard penalty

1742
01:34:58,077 --> 01:34:59,512
against
North Dallas.

1743
01:34:59,578 --> 01:35:01,015
The play is erased.

1744
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:09,093
Goddamn it.
Look at his face.

1745
01:35:09,157 --> 01:35:10,592
Fix his face!

1746
01:35:10,657 --> 01:35:11,693
Elliott!

1747
01:35:11,759 --> 01:35:12,694
Elliott!

1748
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:13,795
Get up, Delma!

1749
01:35:13,862 --> 01:35:15,799
Get back
in the huddle!

1750
01:35:15,865 --> 01:35:17,334
The doctor
will look after him!

1751
01:35:22,738 --> 01:35:26,513
You get back in that huddle now
or off the field!

1752
01:35:29,881 --> 01:35:32,219
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1753
01:35:35,687 --> 01:35:37,623
Let's look
at that play again.

1754
01:35:37,688 --> 01:35:40,127
This play was well set up.

1755
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:41,628
Huddle takes a swing pass
from Maxwell.

1756
01:35:41,693 --> 01:35:44,331
He is wide open
when he starts down field.

1757
01:35:44,397 --> 01:35:46,835
But then he grabs his leg,
obviously in pain,

1758
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:50,140
and Francis Chapman
lays a massive blow on him.

1759
01:35:50,204 --> 01:35:53,778
There is no way Huddle will
make it back in this contest.

1760
01:35:53,841 --> 01:35:55,778
You should see
Delma's face.

1761
01:35:55,843 --> 01:35:57,279
Not now, Poot.

1762
01:35:57,345 --> 01:35:58,781
OK, let's get mean.

1763
01:35:58,847 --> 01:36:01,285
Let's stick it
up their ass.

1764
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:03,221
Two plays,
back to back.

1765
01:36:03,287 --> 01:36:04,722
Red-right-76

1766
01:36:04,787 --> 01:36:07,726
and come back
with red-right-79.

1767
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:08,958
Phil.

1768
01:36:11,228 --> 01:36:12,664
You throw it,
partner,

1769
01:36:12,729 --> 01:36:14,265
I'll catch it.

1770
01:36:17,503 --> 01:36:19,372
Both plays on 2.

1771
01:36:19,438 --> 01:36:20,372
Ready...

1772
01:36:20,438 --> 01:36:21,641
break!

1773
01:36:21,707 --> 01:36:24,612
The Bulls
have got only 16 seconds left,

1774
01:36:24,677 --> 01:36:28,117
but they are 28 yards
away from the score.

1775
01:36:28,181 --> 01:36:31,121
1st and 20,
as Maxwell sets them up.

1776
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:33,121
The clock will start
when the snap is made.

1777
01:36:33,186 --> 01:36:34,623
Elliott is in motion
to the right.

1778
01:36:34,689 --> 01:36:36,124
Maxwell's back to pass.

1779
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:37,625
He's going to Elliott.

1780
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:40,029
It's complete
at the 15-yard line,

1781
01:36:40,094 --> 01:36:41,631
but the clock
is running.

1782
01:36:41,697 --> 01:36:42,965
Good catch by Elliott,

1783
01:36:43,031 --> 01:36:45,503
but he didn't
get out of bounds.

1784
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,405
They've got to hurry to get
another chance to score

1785
01:36:47,470 --> 01:36:48,339
before this game
is over.

1786
01:36:48,405 --> 01:36:49,339
5...

1787
01:36:49,405 --> 01:36:50,340
4...

1788
01:36:50,406 --> 01:36:51,441
3...

1789
01:36:51,507 --> 01:36:52,443
2...

1790
01:36:52,509 --> 01:36:53,811
they got
the play off.

1791
01:37:13,233 --> 01:37:15,503
Yeow!
Yeah!

1792
01:37:19,406 --> 01:37:21,377
Yeah! Yeah!

1793
01:37:22,743 --> 01:37:23,946
Great catch!

1794
01:37:24,012 --> 01:37:26,149
Yeah!

1795
01:37:33,757 --> 01:37:35,927
You're my
ace in the hole.

1796
01:37:35,992 --> 01:37:36,928
Nice pass.

1797
01:37:38,162 --> 01:37:40,198
North Dallas
has a chance to tie it.

1798
01:37:40,265 --> 01:37:43,203
And Prejza, the outstanding
kicker, is in there.

1799
01:37:43,267 --> 01:37:45,472
North Dallas
couldn't have the ball

1800
01:37:45,537 --> 01:37:47,541
in any better hands
in this case--or feet

1801
01:37:47,607 --> 01:37:50,478
because Prejza has kicked
43 straight extra points.

1802
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:52,981
That's a new
North Dallas record.

1803
01:37:53,046 --> 01:37:54,649
They're calling him
"Mr. Automatic."

1804
01:37:54,715 --> 01:37:55,716
There's the snap.

1805
01:37:55,782 --> 01:37:58,220
The ball gets away
from Hartman.

1806
01:37:58,285 --> 01:37:59,720
It's on the ground.

1807
01:37:59,786 --> 01:38:02,225
Chicago recovers.
The game is over.

1808
01:38:02,290 --> 01:38:03,725
The Chicago Marauders

1809
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:06,730
have held off
the North Dallas rally

1810
01:38:06,794 --> 01:38:08,665
to win 14-13,
and what a finish.

1811
01:38:08,731 --> 01:38:11,671
That snap seemed
right on the money.

1812
01:38:11,735 --> 01:38:13,671
Hartman just
couldn't control it.

1813
01:38:13,736 --> 01:38:16,041
What a shame
for North Dallas

1814
01:38:16,106 --> 01:38:17,508
after making such
a dramatic comeback

1815
01:38:17,574 --> 01:38:18,677
in the last few seconds.

1816
01:38:18,743 --> 01:38:21,180
An agonizing defeat
for North Dallas.

1817
01:38:21,244 --> 01:38:24,184
They thought they had
the ballgame tied.

1818
01:38:24,248 --> 01:38:26,185
They felt overtime
was upcoming.

1819
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:27,686
And the Chicago
Marauders

1820
01:38:27,753 --> 01:38:29,189
have won
the championship

1821
01:38:29,254 --> 01:38:30,956
by 1 point.

1822
01:38:39,064 --> 01:38:40,200
How's Delma?

1823
01:38:40,266 --> 01:38:41,702
He needs surgery.

1824
01:38:50,278 --> 01:38:51,546
Hey, Elliott.

1825
01:38:53,282 --> 01:38:56,220
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

1826
01:38:56,284 --> 01:38:57,721
You played good.

1827
01:38:57,788 --> 01:39:02,731
I wish we could say the same
thing for you, Jo Bob.

1828
01:39:02,793 --> 01:39:04,731
You should've studied
Weeks' tendencies.

1829
01:39:04,796 --> 01:39:06,231
I thought I did.

1830
01:39:06,296 --> 01:39:07,732
You don't listen.

1831
01:39:07,799 --> 01:39:10,705
We would've won if we'd
studied those tendencies.

1832
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:11,805
Aw, shit!

1833
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:13,038
You never
give us anything

1834
01:39:13,104 --> 01:39:14,474
to bring in the game

1835
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:16,710
except your fucking
facts and tendencies!

1836
01:39:16,776 --> 01:39:19,081
To you, it's
just a business.

1837
01:39:19,145 --> 01:39:21,583
But to us,
it's still a sport.

1838
01:39:21,648 --> 01:39:23,050
You're supposed
to be professional--

1839
01:39:23,116 --> 01:39:24,586
We work harder
than anybody to win.

1840
01:39:24,652 --> 01:39:26,589
When we're dead tired
in the fourth quarter,

1841
01:39:26,654 --> 01:39:29,593
winning's got to mean
more than just money.

1842
01:39:29,657 --> 01:39:31,092
You were hired
to do a job!

1843
01:39:31,158 --> 01:39:33,597
I don't want
no fucking job!

1844
01:39:33,662 --> 01:39:35,232
I want to play
football, asshole!

1845
01:39:35,297 --> 01:39:36,265
I want some feeling!

1846
01:39:36,331 --> 01:39:38,869
I want some fucking
team spirit!

1847
01:39:38,934 --> 01:39:40,202
This ain't no high school.

1848
01:39:40,269 --> 01:39:41,740
You don't have to love
each other to play.

1849
01:39:41,806 --> 01:39:43,241
That's what I mean,
you bastard.

1850
01:39:43,306 --> 01:39:45,911
Every time I call it a game,
you call it a business.

1851
01:39:45,975 --> 01:39:48,145
And every time I call it
a business, you call it a game.

1852
01:39:48,211 --> 01:39:51,184
You and B.A. and all
you other coaches

1853
01:39:51,248 --> 01:39:52,684
are chicken-shit
cocksuckers.

1854
01:39:52,751 --> 01:39:55,691
No feeling
for the game at all.

1855
01:39:55,755 --> 01:39:56,790
You'll win,

1856
01:39:56,856 --> 01:39:58,325
but it'll just be
numbers on a scoreboard.

1857
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:59,760
Numbers, that's all
you care about.

1858
01:39:59,826 --> 01:40:00,794
That's not enough
for me.

1859
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:01,795
I don't have
to listen--

1860
01:40:01,861 --> 01:40:03,799
Oh, yes, you fucking do!

1861
01:40:03,864 --> 01:40:06,803
You got to listen
to me for once!

1862
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:09,974
All you coaches are
chicken-shit cocksuckers!

1863
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:11,372
Goddamn you!

1864
01:40:13,308 --> 01:40:15,010
Far out.

1865
01:40:20,983 --> 01:40:21,950
For...

1866
01:40:53,791 --> 01:40:55,762
Hey, Del,
how you doing?

1867
01:41:04,303 --> 01:41:05,739
Hey, come on, man.

1868
01:41:05,805 --> 01:41:07,241
You'll be back.

1869
01:41:11,311 --> 01:41:12,414
Um, um...

1870
01:41:13,814 --> 01:41:15,251
Come on. Hey, Del.

1871
01:41:15,317 --> 01:41:17,754
Come on.
You're going to be back.

1872
01:41:17,819 --> 01:41:19,255
Come on, huh?

1873
01:41:39,512 --> 01:41:40,546
Come on.

1874
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:52,893
Whoa.

1875
01:41:57,365 --> 01:41:58,700
Good boy.

1876
01:42:03,806 --> 01:42:04,941
Hi.

1877
01:42:05,008 --> 01:42:05,942
Hi.

1878
01:42:06,009 --> 01:42:08,848
Are you all right?

1879
01:42:08,912 --> 01:42:10,347
Yeah.

1880
01:42:10,412 --> 01:42:12,617
Just slightly damaged.

1881
01:42:14,919 --> 01:42:17,859
Look, um, I'm sorry
about the other night.

1882
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:20,894
I had no right,
no right at all.

1883
01:42:25,798 --> 01:42:28,170
You had a right.

1884
01:42:33,706 --> 01:42:35,077
You see the game?

1885
01:42:35,142 --> 01:42:36,244
Yeah.

1886
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:37,245
See the catch I made?

1887
01:42:37,311 --> 01:42:38,747
Yeah.
It was terrific.

1888
01:42:38,813 --> 01:42:40,415
I'm sorry you lost.

1889
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,386
I thought I was going
to start that game.

1890
01:42:43,451 --> 01:42:45,889
Hell, I even
shot up my knee,

1891
01:42:45,955 --> 01:42:48,326
but they weren't going
to let me start.

1892
01:42:48,389 --> 01:42:49,658
They were using me

1893
01:42:49,725 --> 01:42:52,398
to get another ball player
to deaden his leg.

1894
01:42:52,462 --> 01:42:54,364
God, that's awful.

1895
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:57,336
Yeah. Well
that's the way 'it is.

1896
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:00,840
But what's important
is my performing...

1897
01:43:00,905 --> 01:43:04,345
the moment of the catch,
that feeling, that high.

1898
01:43:04,408 --> 01:43:06,346
Hell
I can take the crap.

1899
01:43:06,411 --> 01:43:08,013
I can take
the manipulation.

1900
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,018
I can take the pain.

1901
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:12,887
As long as I get
that chance every Sunday.

1902
01:43:12,951 --> 01:43:16,960
I think that this game
is twisting your mind.

1903
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:19,964
The game's not twisting
my mind, Charlotte.

1904
01:43:20,028 --> 01:43:21,864
I know the game.

1905
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:25,303
It's the rules
they make up.

1906
01:43:27,435 --> 01:43:29,372
I'm going to play,

1907
01:43:29,437 --> 01:43:31,942
so I'm going
by their rules.

1908
01:43:32,008 --> 01:43:34,613
You can't separate
one from the other.

1909
01:43:34,677 --> 01:43:37,383
Yeah, but I can't buck
their system or fight them

1910
01:43:37,447 --> 01:43:39,751
any more than
you can drop out.

1911
01:43:39,816 --> 01:43:41,052
If you've made up
your mind,

1912
01:43:41,119 --> 01:43:43,089
why did you
come to me?

1913
01:43:43,154 --> 01:43:46,059
'Cause I care
about you...

1914
01:43:47,457 --> 01:43:49,195
and I want
to see you again.

1915
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:05,281
I've got a meeting
with Conrad Hunter.

1916
01:44:05,346 --> 01:44:07,783
Hell, I can't let him see

1917
01:44:07,848 --> 01:44:10,353
that the merchandise
is damaged.

1918
01:44:10,418 --> 01:44:12,356
Here. Let me help you.

1919
01:44:12,421 --> 01:44:13,356
Yeah.

1920
01:44:13,422 --> 01:44:16,361
You know,
when you think about it,

1921
01:44:16,425 --> 01:44:19,365
they're not worse
than anybody else, really.

1922
01:44:34,846 --> 01:44:36,217
Come in, Phil.

1923
01:44:36,282 --> 01:44:37,349
Come on in.

1924
01:44:45,459 --> 01:44:46,895
Hello, B.A.

1925
01:44:49,396 --> 01:44:51,166
Sit there,
Phil.

1926
01:44:56,404 --> 01:44:58,342
All right, Ray.

1927
01:44:58,407 --> 01:45:01,346
Mr. Elliott,
where were you last Monday

1928
01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:03,580
until approximately
8 a.m. Tuesday?

1929
01:45:06,416 --> 01:45:09,121
Uh, who wants
to know that?

1930
01:45:09,186 --> 01:45:10,221
I'm Ray March.

1931
01:45:10,286 --> 01:45:11,622
I'm with the league's

1932
01:45:11,689 --> 01:45:13,058
Internal Investigations
Division.

1933
01:45:13,124 --> 01:45:15,162
On Tuesday of last week,
where were you?

1934
01:45:19,431 --> 01:45:21,869
Uh...
now that, um...

1935
01:45:21,934 --> 01:45:24,371
I don't know.
You know that.

1936
01:45:24,436 --> 01:45:27,910
Why don't you tell me
where I was, huh?

1937
01:45:27,974 --> 01:45:30,379
No, no, no.
W-wait a minute.

1938
01:45:33,947 --> 01:45:36,887
Let me give you
a little hint,

1939
01:45:36,951 --> 01:45:39,891
'cause that wise-ass
attitude of yours

1940
01:45:39,955 --> 01:45:42,894
isn't going to get you
out of this one,

1941
01:45:42,958 --> 01:45:44,594
you understand that?

1942
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:49,337
I think you'd best
answer, Phil, old boy.

1943
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:57,209
All right.

1944
01:46:00,913 --> 01:46:02,849
Ruth, would, um...

1945
01:46:02,916 --> 01:46:05,854
would you send in
Mr. Rindquist, please?

1946
01:46:22,436 --> 01:46:23,873
Go ahead,
Mr. Rindquist.

1947
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:25,375
I am Joseph Rindquist,

1948
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:28,880
and I am a vice-officer
with the Dallas Police.

1949
01:46:28,945 --> 01:46:31,885
Off-duty, I work
for Mr. Ray March

1950
01:46:31,949 --> 01:46:33,885
investigating reports
of league misconduct.

1951
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:35,053
One week ago,

1952
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:38,058
I was instructed to
take up the surveillance

1953
01:46:38,122 --> 01:46:39,657
of Philip Elliott,

1954
01:46:39,723 --> 01:46:42,061
an employee
of the Dallas franchise.

1955
01:46:42,126 --> 01:46:43,762
I followed the suspect
from then

1956
01:46:43,828 --> 01:46:48,438
until he boarded the plane
for Chicago this last weekend.

1957
01:46:48,501 --> 01:46:51,708
And all this time I thought
I was just paranoid.

1958
01:46:51,771 --> 01:46:53,708
"On Monday of this week,

1959
01:46:53,773 --> 01:46:57,213
at a party in a private
North Dallas residence,

1960
01:46:57,278 --> 01:47:00,217
the suspect was observed
near the swimming pool

1961
01:47:00,281 --> 01:47:01,516
in the company

1962
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:04,120
of an unidentified
Caucasian adult male."

1963
01:47:04,186 --> 01:47:05,355
What do you mean,

1964
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:07,189
"an unidentified
white caucasian male,"

1965
01:47:07,256 --> 01:47:08,524
for Christ's sake?

1966
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:09,792
Didn't you recognize him?

1967
01:47:12,428 --> 01:47:15,366
Who was it
that was with me?

1968
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:17,368
Didn't you
recognize him, huh?

1969
01:47:23,909 --> 01:47:26,714
Some investigator.

1970
01:47:26,778 --> 01:47:28,515
Continue, Mr. Rindquist.

1971
01:47:30,783 --> 01:47:32,218
"At this time,

1972
01:47:32,285 --> 01:47:33,721
the suspect
was photographed

1973
01:47:33,786 --> 01:47:36,190
smoking
a marijuana cigarette."

1974
01:47:38,325 --> 01:47:39,760
Photo exhibit "F."

1975
01:47:42,462 --> 01:47:45,401
"Now, picking up the suspect
again on Tuesday,

1976
01:47:45,465 --> 01:47:47,903
I followed him
from these offices

1977
01:47:47,969 --> 01:47:50,408
to 2612 Houston Drive,

1978
01:47:50,472 --> 01:47:52,408
where he remained
until morning.

1979
01:47:52,473 --> 01:47:54,411
This address
is the residence

1980
01:47:54,476 --> 01:47:56,680
of a woman named
Joanne Rodney--"

1981
01:47:56,745 --> 01:48:00,285
We don't need to bring
others into this mess.

1982
01:48:04,589 --> 01:48:05,857
Continue.

1983
01:48:07,425 --> 01:48:11,868
"A search of the suspect's
premises was effected,

1984
01:48:11,930 --> 01:48:15,003
uncovering a bag
of marijuana...

1985
01:48:16,269 --> 01:48:18,440
and assorted pills."

1986
01:48:18,504 --> 01:48:18,504
You got this
from Mr. Elliott's house?

1987
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:21,379
You got this
from Mr. Elliott's house?

1988
01:48:21,445 --> 01:48:22,715
Yes, sir.

1989
01:48:24,449 --> 01:48:25,885
Illegal drugs
are forbidden

1990
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:27,887
by the league rules, Phil.

1991
01:48:27,952 --> 01:48:29,288
You know that.

1992
01:48:29,355 --> 01:48:30,891
For Christ's sake--
Jesus, smoking grass?

1993
01:48:30,956 --> 01:48:32,392
Are you kidding me?

1994
01:48:32,459 --> 01:48:34,563
If you nailed
all the ballplayers

1995
01:48:34,627 --> 01:48:35,730
that smoked grass,

1996
01:48:35,795 --> 01:48:38,399
you couldn't field
a punt return team.

1997
01:48:38,465 --> 01:48:41,070
You give me harder stuff
in Chicago

1998
01:48:41,134 --> 01:48:43,807
just to get out of the
goddamn locker room,

1999
01:48:43,871 --> 01:48:45,406
hard drugs.

2000
01:48:45,473 --> 01:48:46,642
What's...

2001
01:48:49,811 --> 01:48:50,913
Continue.

2002
01:48:50,979 --> 01:48:53,919
Uh, photo exhibit "H"
shows Mr. Elliott

2003
01:48:53,983 --> 01:48:56,655
in the company of a woman
named Charlotte Calder

2004
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:59,156
as they leave
a county and western--

2005
01:48:59,222 --> 01:49:00,191
Jesus Christ!

2006
01:49:00,257 --> 01:49:01,425
You sleazy bastard!

2007
01:49:01,492 --> 01:49:03,196
Sit down
in that chair!

2008
01:49:03,261 --> 01:49:05,598
What do you think
you're doing here?

2009
01:49:05,663 --> 01:49:08,101
Who the hell
you think you are?

2010
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:10,104
We treated you
pretty well.

2011
01:49:10,169 --> 01:49:12,105
We paid you
damn well!

2012
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:14,275
Try to earn
that much out there.

2013
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,277
You're in
for a surprise!

2014
01:49:16,342 --> 01:49:17,945
I'll take care of this.

2015
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:20,950
You're nothing but a
two-bit football player.

2016
01:49:21,014 --> 01:49:21,949
Calm down!

2017
01:49:22,015 --> 01:49:23,450
Let him talk.

2018
01:49:24,685 --> 01:49:26,221
Let him talk.

2019
01:49:30,024 --> 01:49:32,496
You got anything
to say, Phil?

2020
01:49:35,030 --> 01:49:36,298
Nah.

2021
01:49:39,702 --> 01:49:42,074
Are you part of this,
B.A.?

2022
01:49:43,373 --> 01:49:46,313
Phil, you have the best
hands in football.

2023
01:49:46,377 --> 01:49:49,417
There's a lot more
to this business

2024
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:50,783
than ability.

2025
01:49:53,352 --> 01:49:55,790
You're wrong,
because it is ability.

2026
01:49:55,854 --> 01:49:59,929
It is what I can do
with these hands,

2027
01:49:59,992 --> 01:50:03,164
and that's why
I play the game.

2028
01:50:03,230 --> 01:50:05,266
It's dedication.

2029
01:50:05,331 --> 01:50:06,434
It's discipline.

2030
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:07,602
It's sacrifice.

2031
01:50:07,667 --> 01:50:10,105
You can't
take all the time.

2032
01:50:10,171 --> 01:50:12,876
You have to give something
back to the game.

2033
01:50:12,941 --> 01:50:14,109
For Christ's sake,
my nose is busted.

2034
01:50:14,175 --> 01:50:16,446
I can't even
breathe through it.

2035
01:50:16,512 --> 01:50:18,282
I can hardly stand up.

2036
01:50:18,347 --> 01:50:20,150
I haven't slept
more than three hours

2037
01:50:20,216 --> 01:50:21,651
at a stretch in two years.

2038
01:50:21,717 --> 01:50:23,287
Isn't that giving
something back?

2039
01:50:23,353 --> 01:50:26,793
There's pieces of me scattered
from here to Pittsburgh

2040
01:50:26,857 --> 01:50:28,292
on these football fields.

2041
01:50:28,358 --> 01:50:31,164
Isn't that giving something
back to the game?

2042
01:50:31,229 --> 01:50:32,164
Isn't it?

2043
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:37,469
B.A...

2044
01:50:37,536 --> 01:50:39,673
B.A...

2045
01:50:39,737 --> 01:50:40,973
B.A...

2046
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:44,479
how can you
take this away from me?

2047
01:50:44,544 --> 01:50:46,881
How can you do this?

2048
01:50:51,485 --> 01:50:52,753
OK, Phil.

2049
01:50:54,156 --> 01:50:56,593
Only now I
speak for myself.

2050
01:50:57,993 --> 01:51:00,430
And it's your
childish attitude.

2051
01:51:00,495 --> 01:51:02,700
You hurt the team.

2052
01:51:04,332 --> 01:51:05,334
Team?

2053
01:51:10,173 --> 01:51:11,610
They're the team!

2054
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:14,645
These guys right here,
B.A.

2055
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:17,149
They're the team.
We're the equipment.

2056
01:51:17,215 --> 01:51:19,152
We're the jockstraps,
the helmets.

2057
01:51:19,217 --> 01:51:20,452
They just depreciate us

2058
01:51:20,518 --> 01:51:23,124
and take us off their
goddamn tax returns!

2059
01:51:23,189 --> 01:51:24,357
That's what that is.

2060
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:31,365
Yeah. Well...

2061
01:51:38,206 --> 01:51:40,978
I was good
when I played.

2062
01:51:46,549 --> 01:51:47,984
Because the only thing

2063
01:51:48,050 --> 01:51:49,921
that's real
in that game...

2064
01:51:51,321 --> 01:51:52,289
is me.

2065
01:51:54,325 --> 01:51:56,127
And that's enough.

2066
01:51:57,495 --> 01:51:59,934
Well, I feel
for you, Phil,

2067
01:51:59,998 --> 01:52:02,435
but you confused
luck and brain.

2068
01:52:02,501 --> 01:52:05,440
You betrayed me.
You betrayed my family.

2069
01:52:05,504 --> 01:52:07,008
I tried to warn you.

2070
01:52:07,073 --> 01:52:08,475
You violated
the morals clause

2071
01:52:08,541 --> 01:52:10,445
of your contract.

2072
01:52:10,511 --> 01:52:11,946
It's that simple,

2073
01:52:12,011 --> 01:52:13,949
so, pending
a league hearing,

2074
01:52:14,014 --> 01:52:16,318
you're hereby suspended
without pay.

2075
01:52:16,383 --> 01:52:17,519
Yeah?

2076
01:52:18,686 --> 01:52:20,957
Is that what it is, Emmett?

2077
01:52:21,022 --> 01:52:24,462
Is that what this whole
charade has been about,

2078
01:52:24,527 --> 01:52:27,465
so you don't have
to pay my contract?

2079
01:52:27,529 --> 01:52:30,469
I don't need your money
that bad. I quit!

2080
01:52:50,989 --> 01:52:52,926
You are right, B.A.

2081
01:52:52,991 --> 01:52:54,661
Thank you.

2082
01:52:56,996 --> 01:52:59,468
It's time to put away
childish things.

2083
01:53:37,544 --> 01:53:39,547
Things get ugly up there?

2084
01:53:46,052 --> 01:53:47,220
Pretty ugly.

2085
01:53:50,491 --> 01:53:51,927
My name come up?

2086
01:53:53,995 --> 01:53:54,931
Uh...

2087
01:53:54,997 --> 01:53:56,099
ahem.

2088
01:53:56,164 --> 01:53:59,471
There's no reason
to bring you into this.

2089
01:54:02,506 --> 01:54:04,442
They suspend you?

2090
01:54:04,507 --> 01:54:05,610
I quit.

2091
01:54:05,676 --> 01:54:08,883
I can't take it.
They want too much.

2092
01:54:10,515 --> 01:54:12,352
Too much ain't enough.

2093
01:54:13,518 --> 01:54:14,953
Not for them.

2094
01:54:17,022 --> 01:54:18,457
What you gonna do?

2095
01:54:20,192 --> 01:54:21,627
I don't know.

2096
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:24,965
I'm going to go home.

2097
01:54:25,031 --> 01:54:27,804
I'm going to get
in bed with Charlotte.

2098
01:54:27,869 --> 01:54:30,474
I'm going to spend
a week with her.

2099
01:54:30,538 --> 01:54:31,973
I'm going to heal up.

2100
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:35,479
I'll spend time with her
and take it easy.

2101
01:54:35,543 --> 01:54:36,479
Hoss.

2102
01:54:36,545 --> 01:54:37,647
Hmm?

2103
01:54:37,713 --> 01:54:41,153
I appreciate you keeping
my name out of it.

2104
01:54:41,216 --> 01:54:42,651
Uh, no sweat.

2105
01:54:47,057 --> 01:54:48,492
You knew about it.

2106
01:54:51,495 --> 01:54:53,933
You know everything,
don't you, Max?

2107
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:56,936
That I do, Poot.

2108
01:55:00,506 --> 01:55:01,941
That I do.

2109
01:55:11,518 --> 01:55:12,854
Hey, Poot.

2110
01:55:14,189 --> 01:55:15,291
Yeah?

2111
01:55:15,356 --> 01:55:18,295
Got any of them
old pain killers?

2112
01:55:23,532 --> 01:55:24,968
You keep them, cowboy.

2113
01:55:25,034 --> 01:55:26,469
You're going
to need them.

2114
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:32,811
Ahh.

2115
01:55:32,877 --> 01:55:33,912
Hey, Seth.

2116
01:55:35,546 --> 01:55:39,320
We really had them worried
in Chicago, didn't we?

2117
01:55:39,383 --> 01:55:41,889
Best catch
I ever seen, Poot.

2118
01:55:41,955 --> 01:55:44,659
Not a bad pass either.

2119
01:55:46,559 --> 01:55:48,028
Good luck on Sunday.

2120
01:55:52,904 --> 01:55:53,805
Hey, Poot.

2121
01:55:53,838 --> 01:55:54,839
Yeah?

2122
