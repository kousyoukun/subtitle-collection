Yeah, I know.

333
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:27,752
Being a little
hard on yourself, Andy.

See that stewardess

335

Which one?

337
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:30,455

Being a little

God damn, does she
get off on football!

349
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,154
If she's gonna

350
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:47,404
God damn, does she
get off on football!

351
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,707
Just by showing her
a bruise, you know,

352
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,008
God damn, does she
get off on football!

353
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,909
Once she sees
this blood here,

354
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,809
God damn, does she
get off on football!

355
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,312
She might give up
the whole thing.

356
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,813
God damn, does she
get off on football!

357
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,547
Uh-huh.

358
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,280
God damn, does she
get off on football!

359
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:01,486
I'd love to sit here
and talk, but I can't.

360
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,839
I got to test balford's
theory of erotica.

361
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,191
I'd love to sit here
and talk, but I can't.

362
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,559
Check you later, baby.

363
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,926
I'd love to sit here
and talk, but I can't.

364
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:14,833
He's real intelligent,
ain't he?

365
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,901
Oh, poor baby.

366
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:17,402
You like that?

367
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:17,902
Oh, poor baby.

368
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,887
Come on, Andy,
I'm with her.

369
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:19,871
Oh, poor baby.

370
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,490
Andy, I'm with her,
I said!

371
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,108
Oh, poor baby.

372
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,851
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

373
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,169
and just go ahead
and kiss him?

374
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,486
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

375
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:35,937
it's nice to see

376
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:36,386
man: Why don't you
just get in there

377
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,239
there's a little romance
left in the world.

378
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,090
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

379
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,444
¶ these are all good times ¶

380
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,796
man: Why don't you
just get in there

381
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,398
¶ leave your cares behind ¶

382
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,999
man: Why don't you
just get in there

383
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:48,650
sandwich. Sandwich.

384
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:49,300
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

385
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,068
¶ these are the good times ¶

386
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,835
man: Why don't you
just get in there

387
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,187
it's an old story--
boy meets boy.

388
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,538
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

389
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,156
well, I love
happy endings.

390
00:12:54,157 --> 00:12:54,773
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

391
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:55,958
oh, really? Good.
Now we can sit back

392
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,142
man: Why don't you
just get in there

393
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,327
and wait for the
real obscenities.

394
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,511
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

395
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:00,462
you mean it gets worse?

396
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:01,412
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

397
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,680
it definitely
gets different.

398
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,947
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

399
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,666
see,
alcohol and fear

400
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,383
man: Why don't you
just get in there

401
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,152
makes for a good
combination.

402
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,920
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

403
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:09,371
fear?

404
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:09,821
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

405
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:10,055
mm-hmm.

406
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:10,288
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

407
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:10,906
what are they
afraid of?

408
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:11,523
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

409
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,158
falling on their
asses in Chicago.

410
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,792
Man: Why don't you
just get in there

411
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,497
who are you,

412
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,682
and what are you
doing here?

413
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:21,866
Who are you,

414
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:22,200
Charlotte calder,

415
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:22,533
who are you,

416
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:23,819
and I'm asking myself
the same question.

417
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,103
Who are you,

418
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:25,754
I'm Phil elliott.

419
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:26,404
Who are you,

00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:26,905
I'm supposed to be here

421
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:27,405
who are you,

422
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,340
to take you away
from all this.

423
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,274
Who are you,

424
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,325
oh, yeah. See,
I'm a very funny guy.

425
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:31,375
Who are you,

426
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,360
the newspapers call me
the team funnyman.

427
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:33,343
Who are you,

428
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,131
well, obviously, you can't
believe everything you read.

429
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:38,917
Who are you,

430
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,234
I'm sorry.

431
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:39,550
Who are you,

432
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:40,202
I'm not very good

433
00:13:40,203 --> 00:13:40,852
who are you,

434
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:41,620

small talk stuff.

00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,387
Who are you,

436
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,772
in fact, I learned
all my social graces

437
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:45,156
who are you,

438
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,107
from football coaches,

439
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:47,057
who are you,

440
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,126

another try, huh?

441
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,193
Who are you,

00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:59,237
you've got
fantastic eyes.

445
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,840
Hilarious.

[Woman screams]

447
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,844
Hey, quit pushing

[Woman screams]

451
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:09,964
Why can't somebody
stop him?

452
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,014
[Woman screams]

453
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,150

[Woman screams]

455
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,202
Look at him.

[Woman screams]

457
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,187

[woman screams]

465
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,746
That the meanest
and the biggest

466
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:25,563
[woman screams]

467
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,765
Get to make
all the rules.

[Woman screams]

469
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:28,483
I don't agree with that.

470
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:28,999
[Woman screams]

471
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,986
Agreement doesn't
enter into it.

472
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:32,971
[Woman screams]

473
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,512
Well, how can you
tolerate that?

474
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,247
I make allowances,

475
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:42,981
well, how can you
tolerate that?

476
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,249
Then I get ready,
and I run like hell.

477
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,516
Well, how can you
tolerate that?

478
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,735
That's what I like--
a man of courage.

00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:49,953
Well, how can you
tolerate that?

00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,570
That's just, uh, luck.

704
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,004
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

705
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:54,372
You know, Phil,

706
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:54,739
that was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

707
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,174
There's one thing
I learned early on in life.

708
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:57,608
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

709
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,293
The most important thing
a man can have.

710
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,977
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

711
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,946
What's that? Money?

712
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:02,913
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

713
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:03,230
Luck.

714
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:03,546
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

715
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,532
Luck tells me
something about a man.

716
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:05,516
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

717
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:07,502
If my people are lucky,
they tap into a big field.

718
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:09,487
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

719
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,688
If not, they can have every
geology degree in the world

720
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,888
that was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

721
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,674
And drill one dry duster
right after another.

722
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,458
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

723
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:15,693
Take me.

724
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:15,926
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

725
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:16,961
I'm the luckiest man
in the world.

726
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:17,995
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

727
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:20,014
Sure as hell
ain't brains, is it?

728
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:22,032
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

729
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:26,404
You know, Phil, there's always
a place in our little family

730
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,438
for the right kind of man.

731
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,471
You know, Phil, there's always
a place in our little family

732
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:29,507
mm-hmm.

733
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,541
You know, Phil, there's always
a place in our little family

734
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,043
now, Phil...

735
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,412
People who confuse
brains and luck

736
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,780
now, Phil...

737
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,098
Can get in a whole
lot of trouble.

738
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:38,415
Now, Phil...

739
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:38,933
Seeing through
the game

740
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:39,449
now, Phil...

741
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,119
Is not the same
as winning the game.

742
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,787
Now, Phil...

743
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,601
To me, see,
it's gotten to a point

744
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,652
where's Phil's
almost predictable.

745
00:23:58,653 --> 00:23:59,702
To me, see,
it's gotten to a point

746
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,072
I can know what
he's gonna do--

747
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,440
to me, see,
it's gotten to a point

748
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:02,674
[door opens]

749
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:02,907
To me, see,
it's gotten to a point

750
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:03,808
hey, Phil,
how are you doing?

751
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,708
To me, see,
it's gotten to a point

752
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,843
hey, Emmett. B.A.,
I'm sorry I'm late.

753
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:06,977
To me, see,
it's gotten to a point

754
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,045
why don't you-all
stay in my office?

755
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,112
To me, see,
it's gotten to a point

756
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,948
I got to see Connie
anyway for a minute, ok?

757
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,782
To me, see,
it's gotten to a point

758
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,751
thank you very much,
Emmett.

759
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:14,718
To me, see,
it's gotten to a point

760
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,936
see you later, Phil.

761
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:17,153
To me, see,
it's gotten to a point

762
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,724
sit down.
Sit down.

763
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:51,622
Now, that's it, Phil.

764
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,574
What it all boils down
to is your attitude.

765
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,525
Now, that's it, Phil.

766
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:56,360
And another thing,

767
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,193
now, that's it, Phil.

768
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,496
I know you don't like
sitting on the bench.

769
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,797
Now, that's it, Phil.

770
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,449
You're a team member.
You have to adjust.

771
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,100
Now, that's it, Phil.

772
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:03,668
Actually,
I have known players

773
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,235
now, that's it, Phil.

774
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:05,153
That got used
to sitting on the bench,

775
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:06,070
now, that's it, Phil.

776
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:06,921
If that's possible.

777
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,771
Now, that's it, Phil.

778
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:08,706
It's not.

779
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:09,640
Now, that's it, Phil.

780
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,142
You're too proud?

781
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,928
I want you
to listen to something.

782
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,713
You're too proud?

783
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:16,130
The apostle Paul

784
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:16,546
you're too proud?

785
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,633
In one of his letters
to the corinthians said,

786
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,718
you're too proud?

787
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,202
"When I was a child,

788
00:25:21,203 --> 00:25:21,685
you're too proud?

789
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,204
"I thought as a child.
I spake as a child.

790
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:24,722
You're too proud?

791
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:25,623
"I understood
as a child,

792
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,523
you're too proud?

793
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:27,658
"But when
I came to be a man,

794
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,791
you're too proud?

795
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,194
I put away
childish things."

796
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,595
You're too proud?

797
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:32,596
Hmm.

798
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,596
You're too proud?

799
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,165
And there's a theme

800
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:34,732
you're too proud?

801
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,000
That runs through
all this data, Phil.

802
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,267
You're too proud?

803
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,019
It's immaturity,

804
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,769
you're too proud?

805
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:39,270
Your immaturity.

806
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:39,770
You're too proud?

807
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:40,338
You lack
seriousness.

808
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:40,905
You're too proud?

809
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,407
I scored five tds
coming off the bench.

810
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:43,908
You're too proud?

811
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,592
That's pretty serious.

812
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:45,275
You're too proud?

813
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:45,777
<i> You</i> scored five tds?

814
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:46,277
You're too proud?

815
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,962
Don't you know that<i> we</i>
<i> worked for those?</i>

816
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,646
You're too proud?

817
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:50,114
We plan for 'em.

818
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:50,580
You're too proud?

819
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,916
We<i> let you</i>
<i> score those touchdowns.</i>

820
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,250
You're too proud?

821
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,519
B.A., I've always
given you 100%.

822
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,787
You're too proud?

823
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,339
100%!

824
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,889
You're too proud?

825
00:25:58,891 --> 00:25:59,907
You're talking about
individual effort.

826
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:00,924
You're too proud?

827
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,243
Yes, you give that.
I don't deny it.

828
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:03,560
You're too proud?

829
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,896
That's not what
I'm talking about.

830
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,230
You're too proud?

831
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,031
I'm talking about a team.

832
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:07,831
You're too proud?

833
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,933
I'm talking
about a winning team.

834
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,034
You're too proud?

835
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,819
A winning team is
45 finely meshed gears

836
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,603
you're too proud?

837
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:14,322
Working together
in perfect synchronization.

838
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,039
You're too proud?

839
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,924
If one of those gears
flies off on its own,

840
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:18,808
you're too proud?

841
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:19,727
I pull it.

842
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:20,644
You're too proud?

843
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:21,629
And if that's
not straight enough,

844
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,613
you're too proud?

845
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,781
I'll say it
a different way.

846
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:24,948
You're too proud?

847
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:26,417
If you want to play football
for me, Mr. elliott,

848
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,884
you're too proud?

849
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,954
You have to change,
starting right now.

850
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,022
You're too proud?

851
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:32,690
Ahem.

852
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,357
You're too proud?

853
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,192
B.A., I'm sorry if my
immaturity has offended you,

854
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,026
you're too proud?

855
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,163
And I'll honestly
try to change.

856
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,298
You're too proud?

857
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,466
But I've been a starter
for six years,

858
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,633
you're too proud?

859
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:45,803
And it's hard
to sit on the bench, but...

860
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,971
You're too proud?

861
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:49,423
I'll wait my chance.

862
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:50,873
You're too proud?

863
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:54,011
And when
you do start me,

864
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,314
I'll make you
glad you did.

865
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,616
And when
you do start me,

866
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,653
I appreciate that,
Phil...

867
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:06,123
And we'll see.

868
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,127
Hey, Phil, how
are you doing?

869
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,062
You know
joanne Rodney.

870
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:11,996
Hey, Phil, how
are you doing?

871
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:12,396
Phil elliott.

872
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:12,795
Hey, Phil, how
are you doing?

873
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:13,981
Oh, my gosh.
Wait a minute.

874
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:15,165
Hey, Phil, how
are you doing?

875
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,400
Ruth, you got
that contract?

876
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,634
Hey, Phil, how
are you doing?

877
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:18,386
I want you to see this.

b.A. Wants me to adjust
to sitting on the bench.

929
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:05,910
If I don't survive, huh?

00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,077
B.A. Wants me to adjust
to sitting on the bench.

You'll survive.

932

B.A. Wants me to adjust
to sitting on the bench.

933

00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,116
B.A. Wants me to adjust
to sitting on the bench.

00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,017
You know what I'd do?

936
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,969
I'd pull for the other team
so we'll get behind

937
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,920

You know what I'd do?

940
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:21,909
That's weird.

941
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,026
You know what I'd do?

942
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,898
Why don't you just quit?

943
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:32,770
Well, what would I do

944
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:33,888
that wouldn't be
the same or worse?

945
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:35,005
Well, what would I do

946
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,607
besides, it's the only thing
I know how to do good.

947
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,208
Well, what would I do

948
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,877
it's the best hands
in the league.

949
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,545
Well, what would I do

950
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,422
Phil,
do you love me?

951
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,496
Sort of.

952
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:06,170
What kind of
an answer is that?

953
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:06,637
Well...

954
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,103
What kind of
an answer is that?

955
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,622
It's the only kind of answer
I know how to give

956
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:10,139
what kind of
an answer is that?

957
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,594
When somebody I really like
needs to know the truth.

958
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:17,047
What kind of
an answer is that?

959
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:31,829
Hey, how long you been awake?

960
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:34,531
Couldn't sleep.

961
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,377
You don't look too good.

962
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,745
Maybe you ought
to take some vitamins.

963
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,112
You don't look too good.

964
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,315
I don't need a healthy body.

965
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,516
You don't look too good.

966
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:53,684
I can do it all in my mind.

967
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,851
You don't look too good.

968
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:55,202
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:55,551
You don't look too good.

970
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,955
I've been ignoring the fact
that I'm falling apart.

971
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,357
You don't look too good.

972
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,392

Well, that girl just
doesn't exist anymore, so--

980
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,033

981
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,620
Oh, so joanne Rodney

Hmm?

00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:21,278
Well, in that case,
it kinda looks like you.

984
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,616
Uh, what do you want

What do you want
to marry Emmett for?

00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,580
He's just gonna
screw up your life.

1026
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:31,648
What do you want
to marry Emmett for?

1027
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,419
When I told him I wanted
to keep the apartment,

1028
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:35,786
he said I could.

1029
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,152
When I told him I wanted
to keep the apartment,

1030
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,088
you'll come by
and see me, won't you?

1031
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,022
When I told him I wanted
to keep the apartment,

1032
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,697
if I can.

1033
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,100
Oh, get real.

Hey, cheer up.

Everybody gets married

1037
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,466
Hey, cheer up.

1038
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:23,934
Yeah, but I thought

1039
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,401

Hey, cheer up.

00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,359
But look at it
like this--

1047
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,476
hey, cheer up.

1048
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,528
With me

00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:35,578
hey, cheer up.

1050
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:37,915
You won't have to learn
to speak Canadian.

1051
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,250
Hey, cheer up.

1052
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:03,807

1053
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:05,993
Fall asleep again,
it's $100 fine.

1054
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:08,178
We boring you,
Douglas?

1055
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,749
Ok, 3rd and 8.

1056
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,387
All right!
All right!

1057
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,772
The things I do for love.

1058
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:20,156
All right!
All right!

1059
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,191
No. You should never
have thrown to elliott

1060
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,224
all right!
All right!

1061
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,226
With that kind
of coverage.

1062
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,226
All right!
All right!

1063
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:24,861
Look at delma there.

1064
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:25,494
All right!
All right!

1065
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:26,647
He's wide open.

1066
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,798
All right!
All right!

1067
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,200
I don't like
this buddy-buddy stuff

1068
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:30,751
interfering
with my judgment.

1069
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:31,301
I don't like
this buddy-buddy stuff

1070
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:34,071
shit, you can't win
for losing around here.

1071
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,840
I don't like
this buddy-buddy stuff

1072
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,483
[laughter]

1073
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,453
Run it back, run it back.

1074
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,491
[Laughter]

1075
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:04,601
That's it, stallings.
Real good.

1076
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,403
Stallings, what were you
thinking of here?

1077
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,204
That's it, stallings.
Real good.

1078
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,842
I'm...I'm not sure, sir.

1079
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:12,710
You're not sure.

1080
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:13,577
I'm...I'm not sure, sir.

1081
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,094
No, sir.

1082
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:14,610
I'm...I'm not sure, sir.

1083
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,113
The entire game riding
on this one series of downs,

1084
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,614
I'm...I'm not sure, sir.

1085
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,699
And we have a player
who's not sure.

1086
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,783
I'm...I'm not sure, sir.

1087
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:22,536
There's no room in this
business for uncertainty.

1088
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,288
I'm...I'm not sure, sir.

1089
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,659
No room.

1090
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,834
Oh, shit, here it comes.

1091
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:38,602
Here's where you
screwed up.

1092
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,369
Oh, shit, here it comes.

1093
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,821
I didn't screw up.
You changed the play.

1094
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:42,272
Oh, shit, here it comes.

1095
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:42,589
You changed the play.

1096
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:42,905
Oh, shit, here it comes.

1097
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:43,774
I didn't
change the play.

1098
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:44,641
Oh, shit, here it comes.

1099
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:45,626
You brought it in.
I did not.

1100
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:46,610
Oh, shit, here it comes.

1101
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:47,911
Just cover for me.

1102
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,211
Oh, shit, here it comes.

1103
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:51,348
I'd like all of you

1104
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,549
to watch this next play
carefully.

1105
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,749
I'd like all of you

1106
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:54,568
especially you.

1107
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,385
I'd like all of you

1108
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:56,853
especially you, elliott.

1109
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,320
I'd like all of you

1110
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,196
oh, man.
Oh, here it is.

1111
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,197
Great catch.
Great catch.

1112
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,197
Oh, man.
Oh, here it is.

1113
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,399
Yeah!
All right!

1114
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,599
Oh, man.
Oh, here it is.

1115
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,019
Whoo!
All right!

1116
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,437
Oh, man.
Oh, here it is.

1117
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:20,710
Now, elliott,

1118
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,712
how would you
describe this play?

1119
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,713
Now, elliott,

1120
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,687
well...

1121
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,439
I'd say we scored
a touchdown.

1122
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,190
Well...

1123
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,195
Oh, you think it's funny!

1124
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,947
Well, I fail to see
any humor at all.

1125
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,698
Oh, you think it's funny!

1126
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,617
Maxwell changed the play
that I sent in,

1127
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,535
oh, you think it's funny!

1128
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,703
Elliott broke his pattern,

1129
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:47,870
oh, you think it's funny!

1130
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:48,839
And the catch
was a fluke.

1131
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,806
Oh, you think it's funny!

1132
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,758
There's no room for flukes
in winning game plans.

1133
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,709
Oh, you think it's funny!

1134
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,729
Why do you think
that we go over and over

1135
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,747
oh, you think it's funny!

1136
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:58,532
The printouts
of a game plan?

1137
00:36:58,533 --> 00:36:59,316
Oh, you think it's funny!

1138
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,434
Because deviating
from that plan

1139
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:01,551
oh, you think it's funny!

1140
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,185
Can cost us a championship.

1141
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:02,818
Oh, you think it's funny!

1142
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:03,653
If there's some of you

1143
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:04,486
oh, you think it's funny!

1144
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,239
Who aren't interested
in being champions,

1145
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,990
oh, you think it's funny!

1146
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:08,809
Why, then, you laugh.

1147
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,626
Oh, you think it's funny!

1148
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:10,143
Relax. Have a good time.

1149
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:10,659
Oh, you think it's funny!

1150
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:11,094
But you'll do it

1151
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:11,527
oh, you think it's funny!

1152
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,947
On somebody else's
football team, not mine.

1153
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:16,365
Oh, you think it's funny!

1154
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,569
The key to being
a professional

1155
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,253
is consistency,

1156
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:20,936
the key to being
a professional

1157
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,205
and the computer
measures that quality.

1158
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:23,472
The key to being
a professional

1159
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,425
no one of you is as good
as that computer.

1160
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:27,376
The key to being
a professional

1161
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,945
I hope I'm understood.

1162
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:30,512
The key to being
a professional

1163
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:35,752
now, everybody on the bus
in 10 minutes,

1164
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,203
except you, stallings.

1165
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:36,653
Now, everybody on the bus
in 10 minutes,

1166
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,839
I'd like a word with you
in private, please.

1167
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,024
Now, everybody on the bus
in 10 minutes,

1168
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:43,693
coach: All right,
come on, let's move.

1169
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:44,845
Get your gear

1170
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:45,996
Coach: All right,
come on, let's move.

1171
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,378
Hey, let me have
those shoes.

1172
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,212
That's cold, man.

1173
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,045
Hey, let me have
those shoes.

1174
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:03,897
Hey, baby.

1175
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:04,747
Hey, let me have
those shoes.

1176
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,817
Do you believe
they cut stallings?

1177
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,052
Who's stallings?

1178
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,286
Do you believe
they cut stallings?

1180

00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,423
Douglas, the reason
we drafted you

1211
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:47,758
was because they said
you were fast and smart.

1212
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,092
Douglas, the reason
we drafted you

1213
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:49,926
at this point,
I'd be delighted

1214
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:50,759
Douglas, the reason
we drafted you

1215
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,112
if you'd be
one of those things!

1216
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:53,463
Douglas, the reason
we drafted you

1217
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:53,680
yes, sir.

1218
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:53,896
Douglas, the reason
we drafted you

1219
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:54,798
carney, get in here
for Douglas.

1220
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:55,698
Douglas, the reason

huddle up, huddle up.

1222
00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:56,932

1224
00:38:58,286 --> 00:38:59,636

the kind of day

1226
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,009
you'd rather be by a fire
with a good book?

1227
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,943
Hey, Douglas, isn't this
the kind of day

1228
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:08,778
fuck you, faggot.

1229
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:09,611
Hey, Douglas, isn't this
the kind of day

1230
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,297
promises, promises.

1231
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:12,981
Hey, Douglas, isn't this
the kind of day

1232
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:20,056
pass!

1233
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:30,467
How's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

1234
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:31,985
with a dedicated young
Christian stud like hartman?

1235
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:33,502
How's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

1236
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:34,554
it's discouraging.

1237
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:35,604
How's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

1238
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:36,790
well, it's like you
told me, Seth--

1239
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:37,974
how's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

1240
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:38,692
you got to cheat.

1241
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:39,409
How's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

1242
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:40,260
I wrote the book on that.

1243
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:41,110
How's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

1244
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:42,129
I believe that.

1245
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,146
How's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

1246
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:48,818
elliott! Get your ass in here!

You're gonna get yourself
a fine, Jo Bob.

1251
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:57,726
Red, right, 74.

1252
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,245
It's worth it.

1253
00:39:58,246 --> 00:39:58,762
Red, right, 74.

1254
00:39:58,764 --> 00:39:59,713

Ow!

God damn it! God damn it!

1277
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:29,092
Ow!

Pull them out.
Jesus Christ.

1285
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:33,629
Ow!

1286
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:34,748
Don't move,

Pull!

1291

Ow!

1292
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,302
You all right?

1293
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,569
Ow!

1294
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:50,079
Which one?

1295
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,397
Christ,
which do you think?

1296
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:52,714
Which one?

1297
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:52,916
Elliott!

1298
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:53,116
Which one?

1299
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,968
That's what comes
from not concentrating.

1300
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:56,819
Which one?

1301
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:57,454
Yes, sir.

1302
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,087
Which one?

1303
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:58,938
Amazed at how these
young fellows

1304
00:40:58,939 --> 00:40:59,788
which one?

1305
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,308
Can take the punishment
of their profession.

1306
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:02,826
Which one?

1307
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:03,527
Hello, monsignor.

1308
00:41:03,528 --> 00:41:04,227
Which one?

1309
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:04,895
Oh, hello, Phil.

1310
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:05,562
Which one?

1311
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:07,064
You're a very brave
young man.

1312
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,565
Which one?

1313
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:09,549
That's real devotion.

1314
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,532
Which one?

1315
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,652
You remind me of the
magnificent missionaries

1316
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:14,770
which one?

1317
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:15,672
Of history.

1318
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:16,572
Which one?

1319
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:20,510
Never thought
of that, monsignor.

1320
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,112
Come on, elliott,
stop dogging it!

1321
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,380
That's fine.

1322
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,647
Come on, elliott,
stop dogging it!

Are you all right, man?

1373
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:52,786
Hey, Phil,
you all right?

1374
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,337
Are you all right, man?

1375
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,275
You ok?

1376
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,345
Yeah, I'm all right.

1377
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:03,980
Wait--wait--wait--
wait a minute.

1378
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,614
Yeah, I'm all right.

1379
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:06,800
Help me up.

1380
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:07,984
Yeah, I'm all right.

1381
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,720
There's your hat, man.

1382
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:11,304
Nice catch.

1383
00:43:11,305 --> 00:43:11,887
There's your hat, man.

1384
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,572
Yeah.

1385
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:13,255
There's your hat, man.

1386
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:18,227
Now, that's
concentration, elliott.

1387
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,036
Feels pretty swollen.

1388
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,822
Let's work that knee.

1389
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:30,607
Feels pretty swollen.

1390
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:35,878
God damn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

1391
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,130
I hit my shoulder
when I hit the gym floor.

1392
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:38,381
God damn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

1393
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:39,082
It feels like
it's full of gravel.

1394
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:39,782
God damn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

1395
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:40,567
It's always felt like
it was full of gravel.

1396
00:43:40,568 --> 00:43:41,351
God damn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

1397
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:43,186
Give me a b-12 shot.
That's what I want.

1398
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,020
God damn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

1399
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,072
Always messing
with my knee.

1400
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,122
God damn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

1401
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:47,674
How you doing, baby?

1402
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:48,224
God damn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

1403
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,442
Fine. You going
to get a shot?

1404
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:50,659
God damn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

1405
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:51,444
No shots for me, Turkey.

1406
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:52,227
God damn it, Eddie,

00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,992
You know something?

1576
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:21,664
John Henry, why do we
abuse ourselves this way?

1577
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:22,899
Hey, Seth,

1578
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,133
John Henry, why do we
abuse ourselves this way?

1579
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,802
Have you--have you
ever loved anybody?

1580
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:27,470
John Henry, why do we
abuse ourselves this way?

1581
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:29,005
You know, loved somebody.

1582
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,539
John Henry, why do we
abuse ourselves this way?

1583
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:33,943
Aw, last night.

1584
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:34,744
All-time showstopper,
son.

1585
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,544
Aw, last night.

1586
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:36,979
I don't want
to hear this.

1587
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,413
Aw, last night.

1588
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:38,831
All-time showstopper.

1589
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:39,247
Aw, last night.

1590
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,233
I don't want to hear it.

1591
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:41,217
Aw, last night.

1592
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,101
You know Jerry Drake?

1593
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:42,984
Aw, last night.

1594
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:43,252
Drake?

1595
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:43,518
Aw, last night.

1596
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:44,337
Big Tex
automotive supply?

1597
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,154
Aw, last night.

1598
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:46,039
I know that asshole,
yeah.

1599
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,923
Aw, last night.

1600
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:47,540
It was his ymca team

1601
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:48,156
aw, last night.

1602
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,876
That me and hartman
had to talk to last night.

1603
00:48:49,877 --> 00:48:51,594
Aw, last night.

1604
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:52,562
I gave them my usual
bullshit--you know,

1605
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:53,529
aw, last night.

1606
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,231
Football, character
development, all that crap.

1607
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:56,932
Aw, last night.

1608
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:58,051
Hartman comes up
with this story

1609
00:48:58,052 --> 00:48:59,168
aw, last night.

1610
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,304
About Jesus being captain
of a football team.

1611
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,439
Aw, last night.

1612
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:07,576
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1613
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:07,893
Whoo!

1614
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:08,209
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1615
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:09,078
And Judas
was the coach.

1616
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:09,945
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1617
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:10,313
Nope, Judas was the one

1618
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:10,679
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1619
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,448
That sold the playbook
to the devil's team.

1620
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,215
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1621
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:15,134
Oh, my God.

1622
00:49:15,135 --> 00:49:16,051
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1623
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:16,886
Wait'll you hear
this part.

1624
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:17,719
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1625
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:18,955
Afterwards, Drake
invites me and hartman

1626
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,189
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1627
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:21,741
Up to his house
for a drink.

1628
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:23,292
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1629
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:23,810
Now,
I got the wheels,

1630
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:24,327
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1631
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:26,212
So hartman's stuck
with me, right?

1632
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,096
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1633
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:29,615
Anyway,
here's the point.

1634
00:49:29,616 --> 00:49:31,132
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1635
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,435
It turns out
Drake wants to watch

1636
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,736
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1637
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,104
While me and hartman
do nasty things

1638
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:36,471
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1639
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,423
To his bouncy-bottomed
little wife.

1640
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:38,373
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1641
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,176
Aw, Maxwell. Really.

1642
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,977
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1643
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,278
Hey, I know, I know.

1644
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:42,577
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1645
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,362
It's not your
type of thing.

1646
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:44,145
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1647
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,264
But I happen to be
more of a philosopher.

1648
00:49:45,265 --> 00:49:46,381
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1649
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:47,717
I like to mingle
with the little people.

1650
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,051
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1651
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:49,685
What about hartman?

1652
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:50,318
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1653
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:50,786
Well, you know hartman.

1654
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:51,252
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1655
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:52,154
Goody-two-shoes
is fidgeting around

1656
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,054
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1657
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,340
Like a one-legged cat
trying to bury shit

1658
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:55,624
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1659
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:56,342
On a frozen pond,

1660
00:49:56,343 --> 00:49:57,059
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1661
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:57,527
Until old Seth fixes him

1662
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:57,994
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1663
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,112
A couple of
pink poontang specials--

1664
00:49:59,113 --> 00:50:00,229
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1665
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:01,147
You know,
that crazy tourist drink

1666
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:02,064
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1667
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:02,765
I fix for stewardesses?

1668
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:03,465
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1669
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:03,967
Two shots out of that,

1670
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:04,467
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1671
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:05,835
And hartman is shot
to shit, freaked out.

1672
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,202
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1673
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:08,471
I never saw a guy
having so much fun

1674
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,738
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1675
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:10,423
And crying
at the same time.

1676
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,106
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1677
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:12,592
I don't believe it,
but I'm getting horny.

1678
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,076
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1679
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:15,411
Aha. Now wait till you
get to this part.

1680
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,745
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1681
00:50:16,748 --> 00:50:18,698
Drake now takes out a bunch
of them fake dicks--

1682
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:20,649
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1683
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:21,934
Ah, Max, that's gross!

1684
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,218
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1685
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:23,486
Not gross.

1686
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:23,752
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1687
00:50:23,755 --> 00:50:25,171
Gross is when you kiss
your grandpa good night,

1688
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:26,588
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1689
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:27,991
And he sticks his tongue
down your throat.

1690
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:29,392
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1691
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:29,909
That's gross.

1692
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:30,425
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1693
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:30,993
Anyway,
he's got one, man,

1694
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:31,559
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1695
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:33,012
That is about 8 inches
long, and it's pink,

1696
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:34,463
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1697
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,431
And it's got little
crinkleties in it,

1698
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:36,398
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1699
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:37,850
And it's got a grinder
that you turn,

1700
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:39,300
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1701
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:39,885
And it goes in and out--

1702
00:50:39,886 --> 00:50:40,468
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1703
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:41,637
I don't want to hear
no more of this.

1704
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:42,804
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1705
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:43,790
I'm just getting
to the weird part.

1706
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:44,774
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1707
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:46,175
The weird part?
The weird part?

1708
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,575
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1709
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:48,444
Yeah, it gets weird.

1710
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:49,311
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1711
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:49,895
Ok, who did it?

1712
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:50,478
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1713
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:50,930
He did it.

1714
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:51,380
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1715
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,064
Is that right, Seth?

1716
00:50:52,065 --> 00:50:52,747
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1717
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:53,115
Did what?

1718
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:53,481
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1719
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:53,899
The medicine cabinet!

1720
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,315
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1721
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:56,218
If b.A. Finds out,
it's gonna be somebody's ass.

1722
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,119
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1723
00:50:58,122 --> 00:50:58,888
Your water's too hot.

1724
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,655
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1725
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:00,156
Hey, Eddie, calm down.

1726
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:00,656
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1727
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:01,724
The poor man here
was desperate.

1728
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,791
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1729
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:03,426
Think of it as an emergency.

1730
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,059
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1731
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:05,395
Yeah, and I suppose you just
stood there and watched.

1732
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:06,729
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1733
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,064
No, he held me down,
massaged my throat,

1734
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,398
and the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1735
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,016
And made me swallow 'em.

1736
00:51:10,017 --> 00:51:10,633
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1737
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:12,518
Listen, this shit
has got to stop.

1738
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,402
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

1739
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:18,240
And leave my goddamn
beer alone!

1740
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:22,611
And, elliott, don't you
piss in there!

1741
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,716
Ahh...

1742
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,051

Ahh...

1744
00:52:40,925 --> 00:52:44,160
Did I call my wife

I don't

1746
00:52:45,346 --> 00:52:46,529
Did I call my wife

Ohh...

1748

What do I tell her?

1750
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,100
Tell her you escaped,

1751
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:51,533
what do I tell her?

1752
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:52,685
And you don't have
to pay the ransom.

1753
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:53,835
What do I tell her?

1754
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:54,820
I can't tell her that.

1755
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:55,803

Look, son,

1759
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:57,907
What do I tell her?

1760
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:59,375
Dream up the wildest
thing you can think of,

1761
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,842
what do I tell her?

1762
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:01,344
And lay it on her.

1763
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:01,844
What do I tell her?

1764
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:03,196
She'll go for it,
coming from you.

1765
00:53:03,197 --> 00:53:04,547
What do I tell her?

1766

I'm right.

1769
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:06,714
What do I tell her?

1770
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:09,235
Why do I smell
like strawberries?

1771
00:53:09,236 --> 00:53:11,754
What do I tell her?

1772
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:20,563
What'd you do
last night, poot?

1773
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:25,501
Grrr!

Grrr!

1778
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,073

1782
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:34,744
I hope you're not
getting hooked

1783

Grrr!

1790
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:41,868
The only thing I haven't
broken is my concentration.

1791
00:53:41,869 --> 00:53:44,420
Grrr!

1792
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:45,571
Why do we do it,
partner?

1793
00:53:45,572 --> 00:53:46,721
Grrr!

1794
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,824
Well, the only way
to find that out, man,

1795

grrr!

1796
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:51,577
Is to quit.

1797

Grrr!

1798
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,112
You're not thinking
about quitting.

1799
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:53,995
Grrr!

1800
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:56,932
I'm thinking I'm tired
of beating myself up.

Grrr!

1802
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:01,237
Don't worry.

1803

1811
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:30,966

You did the right thing.

1820
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:37,339
Seth...

1821
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:39,308
Lying can be really good
for a relationship.

1822
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,276
Seth...

1823
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,819

00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,076
Those of you
whose names appeared

1924
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,430
now, before we break
into our separate groups,

1925
00:59:44,431 --> 00:59:46,782
those of you
whose names appeared

1926
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:47,483
there are a few
general comments

1927
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:48,183
those of you
whose names appeared

1928
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:49,701
which I am obliged
to make, gentlemen.

1929
00:59:49,702 --> 00:59:51,218
Those of you
whose names appeared

1930
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:51,937
we won a game Sunday

1931
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:52,654
those of you
whose names appeared

1932
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:54,339
against an opponent
measurably and on paper

1933
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,023
those of you
whose names appeared

1934
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,426
inferior to ours.

1935
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,827
Those of you
whose names appeared

1936
00:59:58,829 --> 00:59:59,328
in doing so,

1937
00:59:59,329 --> 00:59:59,828
those of you
whose names appeared

1938
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,263
we managed to play
far below our potential.

1939
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,697
Those of you
whose names appeared

1940
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,783
our punting team gave them
4.5 yards per kick--

1941
01:00:04,784 --> 01:00:06,867
those of you
whose names appeared

1942
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:07,803
more than our
reasonable goal--

1943
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:08,737
those of you
whose names appeared

1944
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:10,372
and 9.9 yards more
than outstanding.

1945
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,006
Those of you
whose names appeared

1946
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:12,908
that's not the kind
of football

1947
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:13,808
those of you
whose names appeared

1948
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:15,311
that conference
champions play.

1949
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:16,812
Those of you
whose names appeared

1950
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:18,714
offense--four turnovers.

1951
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,615
Those of you
whose names appeared

1952
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,701
five scoring
opportunities blown.

1953
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,785
Those of you
whose names appeared

1954
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:25,237
3rd down conversions,

1955
01:00:25,238 --> 01:00:25,687
those of you
whose names appeared

1956
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:27,706
we failed six times more
than our seasonal average.

1957
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,724
Those of you
whose names appeared

1958
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:31,293
pass completions were 49%.

1959
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,860
Those of you
whose names appeared

1960
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:36,031
that's 6.3% less
than reasonable,

1961
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,650
and it's 19% less
than our outstanding.

1962
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:41,268
That's 6.3% less
than reasonable,

1963
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:44,523
that is a negative 19%
against Seattle!

1964
01:00:44,524 --> 01:00:47,776
That's 6.3% less
than reasonable,

1965
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:51,913
now, clearly,
it's time for us

1966
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:53,482
to take a long,
hard look at ourselves,

1967
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,050
now, clearly,
it's time for us

1968
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:55,551
and in this connection,

1969
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:56,051
now, clearly,
it's time for us

1970
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:57,353
coach Johnson has
prepared some material

1971
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,654
now, clearly,
it's time for us

1972
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,823
which I trust will be
beneficial to you.

1973
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,991
Now, clearly,
it's time for us

1974
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:04,826
Johnson.

1975
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:05,777
Thank you, coach.

1976
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:06,727
Johnson.

1977
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:07,512
Now, listen, you guys,

1978
01:01:07,513 --> 01:01:08,295
Johnson.

1979
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:09,564
If we can take
an extra moment here,

1980
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:10,831
Johnson.

1981
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:11,416
I'd like to read something

1982
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:11,999
Johnson.

1983
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,385
That b.A. Thinks
is pretty important.

1984
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:14,769
Johnson.

1985
01:01:14,772 --> 01:01:16,872
Now, when I was playing
college ball at Maryland,

1986
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,973
Johnson.

1987
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:20,943
I found this
taped to a locker.

1988
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:22,911
Johnson.

1989
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,313
I think you'll understand
what it means.

1990
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:26,565
It means he's out
of his fucking mind.

1991
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:27,816
I think you'll understand
what it means.

1992
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:30,552
It means that the difference
between good and great

1993
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:33,287
I think you'll understand
what it means.

1994
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:33,822
Is that much.

1995
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,355
I think you'll understand
what it means.

1996
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:35,808
It's the same size
as his pecker.

1997
01:01:35,809 --> 01:01:37,259
I think you'll understand
what it means.

1998
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:38,661
It comes
from right up here.

1999
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:40,062
I think you'll understand
what it means.

2000
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:40,446
[Cough cough]

2001
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:40,829
I think you'll understand
what it means.

2002
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:41,847
Something wrong,
elliott?

2003
01:01:41,848 --> 01:01:42,864
I think you'll understand
what it means.

2004
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:43,598
No.

2005
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:44,331
I think you'll understand
what it means.

2006
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:48,403
No, sir, I just have
something caught in my throat.

2007
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:48,787
Ahem.

2008
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:49,170
No, sir, I just have
something caught in my throat.

2009
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:49,705
I can't think of anyone

2010
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,238
no, sir, I just have
something caught in my throat.

2011
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,307
That can use this advice
better than you can.

2012
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,375
No, sir, I just have
something caught in my throat.

2013
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:00,115
Yes, sir.

2014
01:02:04,855 --> 01:02:07,389
Excuse me, coach Johnson.

2015
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,958
Thank you.

2016
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:16,465
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2017
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:17,249
Right.

2018
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,032
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2019
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:19,635
"If you think
you're losing...

2020
01:02:19,636 --> 01:02:21,236
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2021
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:22,037
You've lost."

2022
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:22,837
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2023
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,088
All right!

2024
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:23,337
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2025
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,373
"If you refuse to strive
to the limit,

2026
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:25,407
"if you think
you can't win, you won't."

2027
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:26,425
The limit's as far
as you'll go."

2028
01:02:26,426 --> 01:02:27,442
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2029
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:27,909
That's right, sir.

2030
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:28,375
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2031
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:29,127
"Give in
to the fear and pain"--

2032
01:02:29,128 --> 01:02:29,877
"if you think
you can't win, you won't."

2033
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,846
Talk about
the pain.

2034
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:31,813
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2035
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:32,331
Shut up, delma.

2036
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:32,848
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2037
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,566
This ain't exactly
no revival meeting.

2038
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:36,283
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

2039
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:39,221
Do you want something
with me, Monroe?

2040
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:41,256
All right, cut it out,
you guys!

2041
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,290
Do you want something
with me, Monroe?

2042
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:45,994
I'm sorry, coach.

2043
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:47,996
I couldn't--
go ahead, sir.

2044
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,997
I'm sorry, coach.

2045
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:55,804
"If you give in
to the fear and pain,

2046
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:57,005
there are thrills
you'll never know."

2047

"If you give in
to the fear and pain,

Coach,
would it be ok

2068
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,212
good question.

2069
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:38,680
If Jo Bob and I
had a couple copies

2070
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,147
good question.

2071
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:40,532
Of that poem?

2072
01:03:40,533 --> 01:03:40,915
Good question.

2073
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,117
Jo Bob: Yeah,
we'd appreciate that.

2074
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:43,317
Good question.

2075
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,319
That has to be
one of the most

2076
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,319
good question.

2077
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:46,088
Inspiring poems
I ever heard, sir.

2078
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:46,855
Good question.

Hey, I'd like one,
too, coach.

2080
01:03:48,608 --> 01:03:50,358
Good question.

[Mocking]
Yeah, me, too, coach.

2082
01:03:51,344 --> 01:03:52,327
Good question.

2083
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:52,894
Little brown nose.

2084

that would scare
the hell out of me.

Of injury,
of playing badly,

I'm scared to death
most of the time anyhow.

2437

Anything that can knock
me out of the game.

2438
01:14:11,831 --> 01:14:13,214
I'm scared to death
most of the time anyhow.

2439
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:14,532
You don't act like it.

2440
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:15,849
I'm scared to death
most of the time anyhow.

2441
01:14:15,852 --> 01:14:17,252
Yeah. I don't dare.

2442
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:18,653
I'm scared to death
most of the time anyhow.

2443
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:22,523
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2444
01:14:22,525 --> 01:14:23,157
Then what?

2445
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:23,790
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2446
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:24,909
Oh, come on, Charlotte,
that's serious.

2447
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:26,026
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2448
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:27,362
I don't want
to get into that.

2449
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:28,696
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2450
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:29,264
For Christ's sake,
come on.

2451
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:29,831
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2452
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,016
Let's don't
talk about football.

2453
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:32,200
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2454
01:14:32,202 --> 01:14:33,034
I'm gonna start Monday.

2455
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:33,867
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2456
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,787
Everything in my life's
just great.

2457
01:14:35,788 --> 01:14:37,705
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2458
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:38,122
We got any butter?

2459
01:14:38,123 --> 01:14:38,538
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2460
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:39,841
Well, I don't think
it's great.

2461
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:41,142
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2462
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,544
You know, I saw you
the other night.

2463
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:43,945
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2464
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:45,847
You were in so much pain
you couldn't sleep.

2465
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,748
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2466
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,966
Your body's
twisted and scarred.

2467
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:50,183
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2468
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:50,702
You're drugging yourself.

2469
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:51,219
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2470
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:52,971
Hey, listen, that's just
part of the game, Charlotte.

2471
01:14:52,972 --> 01:14:54,722
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2472
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:55,206
Game?!

2473
01:14:55,207 --> 01:14:55,689
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2474
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:57,125
You call men smashing
each other a game?

2475
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:58,559
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2476
01:14:58,561 --> 01:14:59,260
For Christ's sake!

2477
01:14:59,261 --> 01:14:59,960
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2478
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:00,361
You can't judge!

2479
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:00,760
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2480
01:15:00,763 --> 01:15:01,946
You live in a little house
secure with your Texas money.

2481
01:15:01,947 --> 01:15:03,130
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2482
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:04,382
What the hell
do you know about it?

2483
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:05,633
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2484
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:06,200
You live
in an unreal world!

2485
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:06,766
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2486
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:07,385
If football's
the real world,

2487
01:15:07,386 --> 01:15:08,002
you know, someday
you will be out of it.

2488
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,270
I don't want
any part of it!

2489
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,537
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2490
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:10,855
It scares me.

2491
01:15:10,856 --> 01:15:11,171
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2492
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:12,473
Well, good.
It's not your life.

2493
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:13,773
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2494
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:14,892
It's mine.

2495
01:15:14,893 --> 01:15:16,009
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

2496
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,914
Come on, let's eat.

2497
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,220
Why don't you
build your ranch

2498
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:26,888
instead of
dreaming about it?

2499
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:27,555
Why don't you
build your ranch

2500
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:28,923
maybe I like it better
as a fantasy.

2501
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:30,290
Why don't you
build your ranch

2502
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:30,775
the payments are lower.

2503
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:31,258
Why don't you
build your ranch

2504
01:15:31,261 --> 01:15:32,677
and you accuse me
of living in a dream world?

2505
01:15:32,678 --> 01:15:34,094
Why don't you
build your ranch

2506
01:15:34,097 --> 01:15:34,813
for Christ's sake,
Charlotte.

2507
01:15:34,814 --> 01:15:35,530
Why don't you
build your ranch

2508
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:36,865
look, I got to keep
my mind in the game.

2509
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:38,199
Why don't you
build your ranch

2510
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,601
I don't want
to get confused now,

2511
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:41,002
why don't you
build your ranch

2512
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:42,420
so drop it!

2513
01:15:42,421 --> 01:15:43,837
Why don't you
build your ranch

2514
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:05,927
why don't you
watch the game?

2515
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:07,395
I'll do something
special for you

2516
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,862
why don't you
watch the game?

2517
01:16:08,865 --> 01:16:09,998
In Chicago.

2518
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:11,132
Why don't you
watch the game?

2519
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:18,105
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2520
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:18,973
Hey, Phil,
what's happening?

2521
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:19,840
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2522
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:21,008
What are you doing
here early, man?

2523
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,175
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2524
01:16:22,178 --> 01:16:22,593
I got butterflies.

2525
01:16:22,594 --> 01:16:23,009
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2526
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:24,011
I couldn't sit
around the hotel.

2527
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,011
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2528
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:25,630
I had to get out of there.

2529
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:26,247
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2530
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:27,699
Where in the hell
is Jo Bob and o.W.?

2531
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,150
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2532
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:30,635
They were in a cab
right behind me.

2533
01:16:30,636 --> 01:16:32,119
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2534
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:32,637
I done told you boys

2535
01:16:32,638 --> 01:16:33,154
hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2536
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:34,255
When you got special
taping to do,

2537
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,355
hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2538
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:36,174
Get to the stadium early.

2539
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:36,991
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2540
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:38,176
Maybe I ought to
start getting here

2541
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,360
hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2542
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:40,144
The night before.

2543
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:40,927
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2544
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:41,829
Come on, Frank!
What are you doing?

2545
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,729
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2546
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:43,448
We got an important
ball game.

2547
01:16:43,449 --> 01:16:44,165
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2548
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:45,133
You tape
my left ankle first.

2549
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:46,100
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2550
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,552
You trying to
put the hex on me?

2551
01:16:47,553 --> 01:16:49,003
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2552
01:16:49,005 --> 01:16:49,387
You old fart.

2553
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:49,770
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2554
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:51,873
I'll tape that knee
after the doctor checks it.

2555
01:16:51,874 --> 01:16:53,975
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

2556
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:59,180
You don't look
healthy at all.

2557
01:16:59,182 --> 01:17:00,248
Yeah. I hurt myself.

2558
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:01,315
You don't look
healthy at all.

2559
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,385
I'll catch you later.

2560
01:17:04,387 --> 01:17:05,286
Have a good ball game.

2561
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:06,186
I'll catch you later.

2562
01:17:06,189 --> 01:17:07,238
Yeah. You, too.

2563
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:08,288
I'll catch you later.

2564
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,272
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2565
01:17:58,274 --> 01:17:59,257
This is what we want.

2566
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:00,241
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2567
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:00,992
And what are we gonna do?

2568
01:18:00,993 --> 01:18:01,742
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2569
01:18:01,744 --> 01:18:02,710
We are gonna
kick their butts.

2570
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:03,677
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2571
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,229
What are we gonna do?

2572
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:04,779
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2573
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:05,830
We know
how to kick their butts.

2574
01:18:05,831 --> 01:18:06,880
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2575
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:07,548
How are we gonna do it?

2576
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:08,214
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2577
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:08,716
Very roughly, no respect.

2578
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:09,216
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2579
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:09,684
We're gonna do it.

2580
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:10,151
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2581
01:18:10,153 --> 01:18:11,736
We're gonna get 'em.
We're gonna get 'em.

2582
01:18:11,737 --> 01:18:13,320
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2583
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:13,671
Yes. Yes.

2584
01:18:13,672 --> 01:18:14,021
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2585
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,189
Weeks all there,
weeks all there.

2586
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,356
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2587
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:17,275
I'm being weeks now.

2588
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:18,192
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2589
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:18,726
Where's my locker?

2590
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:19,259
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2591
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,995
Come on. Get your junk
on, babe.

2592
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,729
Jo Bob, this is it,
babe.

2593
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:24,965
Ah. Hello. What is it?

2594
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:25,383
It's the knee.

2595
01:18:25,384 --> 01:18:25,800
Ah. Hello. What is it?

2596
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:27,502
Knee, huh?
Let's have a look.

2597
01:18:27,503 --> 01:18:29,203
Ah. Hello. What is it?

2598
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,174
Tell me when.

2599
01:18:34,977 --> 01:18:35,810
Uhh!

2600
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:36,411
Aha-ha-ha-ha.

2601
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:37,011
Uhh!

2602
01:18:37,013 --> 01:18:37,428
Ha ha ha ha.

2603
01:18:37,429 --> 01:18:37,844
Uhh!

2604
01:18:37,847 --> 01:18:38,346
"X" marks the spot.

2605
01:18:38,347 --> 01:18:38,846

01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:33,433
No, wait.
Wait a second.

2631
01:19:33,436 --> 01:19:34,952
All right. Not yet.

01:19:34,953 --> 01:19:36,469
No, wait.
Wait a second.

2633
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:38,439

No, wait.
Wait a second.

2639
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:44,145
You won't feel a thing.

2640
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:44,845
No, wait.
Wait a second.

2641
01:19:44,847 --> 01:19:45,997
Christ, how often
do you put this shit

2642
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:47,148
no, wait.
Wait a second.

2643
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:48,082
In the coaches' hearts?

2644
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,015
No, wait.
Wait a second.

2645
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:49,684
Ahh...

No, wait.
Wait a second.

2649
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:57,958
Now, that wasn't
bad, was it?

2650
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,943
Oh, no. I loved it.

2651
01:19:58,944 --> 01:19:59,927
Now, that wasn't
bad, was it?

2652
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:00,511
Ha ha ha ha!

2653
01:20:00,512 --> 01:20:01,094
Now, that wasn't
bad, was it?

2654
01:20:01,097 --> 01:20:02,730
There.
Now try it.

2655
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:04,364
Now, that wasn't
bad, was it?

2656
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:08,502
How does it feel?

2657
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:09,487
Ah, it's numb.

2658
01:20:09,488 --> 01:20:10,471
How does it feel?

2659
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:10,805
Good, good.

2660
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,138
How does it feel?

2661
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,023
It's a brand-new
knee, doc.

2662
01:20:12,024 --> 01:20:12,907
How does it feel?

2663
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:14,992
Better football
through chemistry, huh?

2664
01:20:14,993 --> 01:20:17,076
How does it feel?

2665
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:26,453
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2666
01:20:26,455 --> 01:20:27,388
You must
be feeling better.

2667
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,322
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2668
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,607
No, coach,
it feels real bad.

2669
01:20:29,608 --> 01:20:30,891
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2670
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:32,176
I don't think
I can make it.

2671
01:20:32,177 --> 01:20:33,460
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2672
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:34,695
Ah, come on, delma.
You saw elliott.

Hey, delma,

01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:36,264
He was hurting, too,

2675
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:36,597
hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2676
01:20:36,599 --> 01:20:38,950
But he has the guts to do
what it takes when we need him.

2677
01:20:38,951 --> 01:20:41,302
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2678
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:41,686
If I shoot up,

2679
01:20:41,687 --> 01:20:42,069
hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2680
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:42,770
I could hurt myself
real bad.

2681
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:43,470
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2682
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:44,205
I don't mess
with needles.

2683
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:44,939
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2684
01:20:44,941 --> 01:20:45,640
You don't feel
anything.

2685
01:20:45,641 --> 01:20:46,340
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2686
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:47,608
I could tear my
hamstring to bits.

2687
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:48,875
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2688
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:50,862
God damn it, isn't it time
you thought about the team?

2689
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:52,847
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2690
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:53,214
Now, you listen, delma.

2691
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:53,580
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2692
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:54,782
You can't make it

2693
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:55,982
hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2694
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:57,151
If you don't know
the difference

2695
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,318
hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2696
01:20:58,321 --> 01:20:59,303
Between pain and injury.

2697
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:00,286
Hey, delma,
using the heat, huh?

2698
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:01,622

Stop playing grab-ass
and get ready.

01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,608
Fuck it.

2706
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:31,285

That's good.

Come on, eat him up.

2780
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:02,977
You want to pad up?

2781
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:03,410
Come on, eat him up.

2782
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:04,228
Let's go.
Let's get him.

2783
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,045
Come on, eat him up.

2784
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:06,096
Let's get ready now.
You ready?

2785
01:23:06,097 --> 01:23:07,146
Come on, eat him up.

2786
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:07,898
Let's go pad up,
baby.

2787
01:23:07,899 --> 01:23:08,648
Come on, eat him up.

2788
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:09,083
Where's my locker?

2789
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:09,516
Come on, eat him up.

2790
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:10,634
It's right behind you.

2791
01:23:10,635 --> 01:23:11,751
Come on, eat him up.

2792
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,726
Hey, hartman,
while you're at it,

2793
01:23:18,728 --> 01:23:20,695
why don't you ask the man
about the point spread?

2794
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:22,663
Hey, hartman,
while you're at it,

2795
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:23,898
pussy.

2796
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:25,132
Hey, hartman,
while you're at it,

2797
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:33,307
well, all right.

2798
01:23:33,309 --> 01:23:34,742
No wonder they call it
the windy city.

2799
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:36,176
Well, all right.

2800
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,194
Hey, baby. Cool.

2801
01:23:37,195 --> 01:23:38,211
Well, all right.

2802
01:23:38,214 --> 01:23:39,297
Save some for the party.

2803
01:23:39,298 --> 01:23:40,381
Well, all right.

2804
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:41,782
You got a face
like a baby's butt.

2805
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:43,182
Well, all right.

2806
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:43,751
Thank you, Seth.

2807
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:44,318
Well, all right.

2808
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,036
Beautiful.

2809
01:23:45,037 --> 01:23:45,753
Well, all right.

2810
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:47,021
Player: Fuck it!

2811
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,288
Well, all right.

2812
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:48,689
Tell you what.

2813
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:49,089
Well, all right.

2814
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:50,691
This time I'm gonna get
the bastard with this.

2815
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,292
Well, all right.

2816
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:53,210
Mother clotheslined me
last time.

2817
01:23:53,211 --> 01:23:54,127
Well, all right.

2818
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:54,829
I'm gonna tear his ass up.

2819
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:55,529
Well, all right.

2820
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:56,847
I lost 4 fucking teeth,
4 teeth.

2821
01:23:56,848 --> 01:23:58,164
Well, all right.

2822
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,617
I'm gonna tear his ass up.

2823
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:01,068
Well, all right.

2824
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:13,047
10 minutes! 10 minutes!

2825
01:24:30,533 --> 01:24:31,432
You ready, babe?

2826
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:32,300
Alan,
I can't fumble, man.

2827
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:33,167
You ready, babe?

2828
01:24:33,169 --> 01:24:34,135
You saw what they
did to stallings.

2829
01:24:34,136 --> 01:24:35,102
You ready, babe?

2830
01:24:35,104 --> 01:24:37,221
Hey, you'll be all right,
ok?

2831
01:24:37,222 --> 01:24:39,339
You ready, babe?

2832
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:42,743
Give me a hit.

2833
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:45,813
Ready?

2834
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,253
Thank you.

2835
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,825
Can't fumble.

2836
01:24:58,194 --> 01:25:01,228
Can't fumble football.

2837
01:25:08,838 --> 01:25:11,138
Hey! All right.

2838
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:11,672
Have a good game.

2839
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:12,205
Hey! All right.

2840
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:12,540
All right, all right.

2841
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:12,873
Hey! All right.

2842
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:14,191
Let's go, Jo Bob.
Let's get 'em.

2843
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:15,508
Hey! All right.

2844
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:16,894
Let's go, babe.

2845
01:25:16,895 --> 01:25:18,278
Hey! All right.

2846
01:25:44,707 --> 01:25:46,173
How's that, mark?

2847
01:25:46,175 --> 01:25:46,824
Little
more air, Keith.

2848
01:25:46,825 --> 01:25:47,474
How's that, mark?

2849
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:48,375
Hey, why don't you
pump up his ass

2850
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:49,275
how's that, mark?

2851
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:49,760
And blow his brains out?

2852
01:25:49,761 --> 01:25:50,243
How's that, mark?

2853
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:50,911
Up yours,
asshole.

2854
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:51,577
How's that, mark?

2855
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,146
Fuck you.

2856
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:52,713
How's that, mark?

2857
01:25:52,715 --> 01:25:53,731
5 minutes!

2858
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:54,748
How's that, mark?

2859
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,282
How long, coach?

2860
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:55,815
How's that, mark?

2861
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:57,184
5--fuck you!

2862
01:25:57,185 --> 01:25:58,551
How's that, mark?

2863
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,157
All right, settle down.

2864
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:03,708
Listen up.

2865
01:26:03,709 --> 01:26:04,258
All right, settle down.

2866
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,242
Out with the cigarettes.

2867
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,225
All right, settle down.

2868
01:26:06,228 --> 01:26:07,077
Coach.

2869
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:07,927
All right, settle down.

2870
01:26:08,264 --> 01:26:09,897
Just one reminder,
gentlemen.

2871
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:11,215
Please remember
to take off your helmets

2872
01:26:11,216 --> 01:26:12,532
just one reminder,
gentlemen.

2873
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:13,451
When they play
the national anthem.

2874
01:26:13,452 --> 01:26:14,368
Just one reminder,
gentlemen.

2875
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:15,436
Also remember you're
on national TV,

2876
01:26:15,437 --> 01:26:16,503
just one reminder,
gentlemen.

2877
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:18,422
So don't pick your noses
or scratch your nuts.

2878
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,340
Just one reminder,
gentlemen.

2879
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:23,844
Excuse me,
coach Johnson.

2880
01:26:25,814 --> 01:26:29,583
Mr. hunter would like to say
a few words to you now.

2881
01:26:29,585 --> 01:26:30,985
Thank you, b.A.

2882
01:26:30,986 --> 01:26:32,386
Mr. hunter would like to say
a few words to you now.

2883
01:26:32,388 --> 01:26:32,620
Men...

2884
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:32,853
Mr. hunter would like to say
a few words to you now.

2885
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:34,188
I want you
to win this game

2886
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:35,522
Mr. hunter would like to say
a few words to you now.

2887
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,540
For our fans,
for Dallas,

2888
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:37,557
Mr. hunter would like to say
a few words to you now.

2889
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,126
For me and
my little brother.

2890
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:40,693
Mr. hunter would like to say
a few words to you now.

2891
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:43,730
Not necessarily
in that order.

2892
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:46,700
If we win
this game,

2893
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:47,818
you're all invited
to spend a weekend

2894
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:48,935
if we win
this game,

2895
01:26:48,938 --> 01:26:49,637
with your wives
and families

2896
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:50,337
if we win
this game,

2897
01:26:50,339 --> 01:26:52,122
at my private island
in the Caribbean.

2898
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:53,906
If we win
this game,

2899
01:26:55,244 --> 01:26:57,211
bullshit.

2900
01:26:57,213 --> 01:26:57,495
And remember,

2901
01:26:57,496 --> 01:26:57,778
bullshit.

2902
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,746
The eyes of Texas
are on you.

2903
01:26:58,747 --> 01:26:59,713
Bullshit.

2904
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:01,849
[Whistling<i> I've been</i>
<i> working on the railroad]</i>

2905
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,984
Bullshit.

2906
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:08,488
Knock that shit
off!

2907
01:27:10,526 --> 01:27:12,492
Monsignor.

2908
01:27:16,799 --> 01:27:17,497
Dear lord,

2909
01:27:17,499 --> 01:27:18,665
I ask your blessing
on these brave boys

2910
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:19,832
dear lord,

2911
01:27:19,835 --> 01:27:20,768
as they venture
out to battle.

2912
01:27:20,769 --> 01:27:21,702
Dear lord,

2913
01:27:21,704 --> 01:27:23,087
take off your
fucking hats!

2914
01:27:23,088 --> 01:27:24,471
Dear lord,

2915
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:25,556
sorry,
monsignor.

2916
01:27:25,557 --> 01:27:26,640
Dear lord,

2917
01:27:27,343 --> 01:27:30,444
we ask not for victory,

2918
01:27:30,446 --> 01:27:31,378
not for glory,

2919
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:32,311
we ask not for victory,

2920
01:27:32,314 --> 01:27:32,913
not for fame.

2921
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:33,513
We ask not for victory,

2922
01:27:33,515 --> 01:27:35,182
we ask only
for the preservation

2923
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:36,850
we ask not for victory,

2924
01:27:36,852 --> 01:27:37,651
of our bodies

2925
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:38,451
we ask not for victory,

2926
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:39,603
and of our minds.

2927
01:27:39,604 --> 01:27:40,753
We ask not for victory,

2928
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,589
bless also
the entire hunter family

2929
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,423
we ask not for victory,

2930
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:45,909
who have so
unselfishly given us

2931
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:47,393
we ask not for victory,

2932
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:48,879
everything
we need for victory,

2933
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,363
we ask not for victory,

2934
01:27:50,366 --> 01:27:50,881
except our efforts

2935
01:27:50,882 --> 01:27:51,397
we ask not for victory,

2936
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,067
in the spirit
of sportsmanship,

2937
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:54,735
we ask not for victory,

2938
01:27:54,737 --> 01:27:55,319
with thy guidance,

2939
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:55,902
we ask not for victory,

2940
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,404
thy kingdom,
power, and glory

2941
01:27:57,405 --> 01:27:58,905
we ask not for victory,

2942
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:00,107
for evermore.

2943
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,308
We ask not for victory,

2944
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:01,792
amen.

2945
01:28:01,793 --> 01:28:02,275
We ask not for victory,

2946
01:28:02,278 --> 01:28:02,576
amen.
Amen.

2947
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:02,875
We ask not for victory,

2948
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:04,161
let's go kill
those cocksuckers!

2949
01:28:04,162 --> 01:28:05,445
We ask not for victory,

2950
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:25,465
elliott?
Yeah?

2951
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:26,667
I'm starting delma,
but you stay up.

2952
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:27,868
Elliott?
Yeah?

2953
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:29,153
Be ready when I need you.

2954
01:28:29,154 --> 01:28:30,437
Elliott?
Yeah?

2955
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,547
He said he's
starting delma.

2956
01:28:40,549 --> 01:28:40,981
I heard.

2957
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:41,414
He said he's
starting delma.

2958
01:28:41,417 --> 01:28:41,682
But I thought--

2959
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:41,948
he said he's
starting delma.

2960
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:43,684
I can't worry about
that now, poot.

2961
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:45,419
He said he's
starting delma.

2962
01:28:45,421 --> 01:28:46,587
You just be ready.

2963
01:28:46,588 --> 01:28:47,754
He said he's
starting delma.

2964
01:29:08,377 --> 01:29:10,444
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2965
01:29:10,446 --> 01:29:11,211
this might be it
for north Dallas.

2966
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:11,977
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2967
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:12,879

01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,779
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2969
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:15,198
north Dallas is
on the Chicago 25.

2970
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,615
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2971
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:16,850
1st and 10.

2972
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:17,083
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2973
01:29:17,086 --> 01:29:18,052
second sportscaster:
Nail-biting time for the fans.

2974
01:29:18,053 --> 01:29:19,019
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2975
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:19,770

time for the players

2976
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:20,520
sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2977
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:21,638
because they have
to score on this drive.

2978
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:22,755
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2979
01:29:22,758 --> 01:29:23,223
Seth Maxwell fakes.

2980
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:23,689
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2981
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:24,258
hands off
to Andy Melbourne

2982
01:29:24,259 --> 01:29:24,825

2983
01:29:24,827 --> 01:29:26,226

a three-yard loss

2984
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:27,626
sportscaster: With less

2985
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:27,995
by alcie weeks.

2986
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:28,362
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2987
01:29:28,364 --> 01:29:29,380
they haven't kept
weeks out all night.

2988
01:29:29,381 --> 01:29:30,397
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2989
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:31,198
he has been in that
backfield all day.

2990
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:31,998
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2991
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,683
they should
give him a uniform

2992
01:29:32,684 --> 01:29:33,367
sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2993
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:34,118

the north Dallas backfield.

2994
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:34,868
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2995
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,770
it'll be a 3-yard loss.
The clock is running.

2996
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:38,671
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2997
01:29:38,674 --> 01:29:39,223
I wonder what
they're saying

2998
01:29:39,224 --> 01:29:39,773
sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

2999
01:29:39,775 --> 01:29:40,574
as far as strategy
is concerned

3000
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:41,374

3001
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:42,459

01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,542
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

3003
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:44,494
Jo Bob, we need to get
through titty block.

3004
01:29:44,495 --> 01:29:45,444
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

3005
01:29:45,447 --> 01:29:46,079

3025
01:30:01,497 --> 01:30:02,129

Sportscaster: With less

3027
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:03,397

01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:07,567
Sportscaster: With less

01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:07,784

01:30:08,003 --> 01:30:09,753

01:30:11,507 --> 01:30:11,822

01:30:16,512 --> 01:30:17,011

sportscaster: With less

3045
01:30:17,513 --> 01:30:19,263
I'm fucking going to
kill ya, cocksucker.

3046
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:21,014
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left,

3047
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:26,119
hey, Jo Bob.

3048
01:30:26,121 --> 01:30:27,037
You're looking lousy.

3049
01:30:27,038 --> 01:30:27,954
Hey, Jo Bob.

3050
01:30:27,956 --> 01:30:29,423
You're getting old.
I hate to do it,

3051
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:30,891
hey, Jo Bob.

3052
01:30:30,893 --> 01:30:32,843
But I'm gonna put your dick
all in the dirt.

3053
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,794
Hey, Jo Bob.

3054
01:30:34,797 --> 01:30:35,779
Maxwell: Set!

3055
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:36,762
Hey, Jo Bob.

3056
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:43,970
4-48.

3057
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:44,755
4-48.

3058
01:30:44,756 --> 01:30:45,539
4-48.

3059
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:45,789
Hut! Hut!

3060
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,038
4-48.

3061
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:47,975
Sportscaster: Maxwell's
in a shotgun formation.

3062
01:30:47,976 --> 01:30:49,910
4-48.

3063
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:50,310
He fades to pass...

3064
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:50,709
4-48.

3065
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:51,711
What a rush by weeks,
who dumps him.

3066
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:52,711
4-48.

3067
01:30:52,714 --> 01:30:53,180
The pass is off,
though.

3068
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:53,647
4-48.

3069
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:55,165
Fitch, streaking down
the middle, is in the open.

3070
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:56,682
4-48.

3071
01:30:56,685 --> 01:30:57,317
Drop it.

3072
01:30:57,318 --> 01:30:57,950
4-48.

3073
01:30:57,953 --> 01:30:59,503
The pass...Is no good.

3074
01:30:59,504 --> 01:31:01,054
4-48.

3075
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:06,560
Come on, Fitch!
Concentrate!

3076
01:31:11,033 --> 01:31:12,866
Are you ok, baby?

3077
01:31:12,868 --> 01:31:13,767
Hey, weeks!

3078
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:14,667
Are you ok, baby?

3079
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:15,686
Announcer:
And now an altercation

3080
01:31:15,687 --> 01:31:16,703
are you ok, baby?

3081
01:31:16,705 --> 01:31:17,220
Breaks out
on the field

3082
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:17,736
are you ok, baby?

3083
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:19,139
Among a couple
of the linemen.

3084
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,540
Are you ok, baby?

3085
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:21,725
Sportscaster 2: I can understand
why tempers are a little hot,

3086
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:22,909
are you ok, baby?

3087
01:31:22,911 --> 01:31:23,527
Because
the game's winding down.

3088
01:31:23,528 --> 01:31:24,144
Are you ok, baby?

3089
01:31:24,146 --> 01:31:24,962
And this is the season
for them.

3090
01:31:24,963 --> 01:31:25,779
Are you ok, baby?

3091
01:31:25,781 --> 01:31:26,914
Maxwell's asking
for a time out

3092
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:28,048
are you ok, baby?

3093
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:29,049
Although the clock
is stopped.

3094
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,049
Are you ok, baby?

3095
01:31:30,052 --> 01:31:31,602
We've got less than
a minute to play.

3096
01:31:31,603 --> 01:31:33,153
Are you ok, baby?

3097
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:34,671
Maxwell coming to
talk to his coach.

3098
01:31:34,672 --> 01:31:36,188
Are you ok, baby?

3099
01:31:36,191 --> 01:31:37,541
You have to think
now that Chicago

3100
01:31:37,542 --> 01:31:38,892
are you ok, baby?

3101
01:31:38,894 --> 01:31:39,443
Will drop back
on defense

3102
01:31:39,444 --> 01:31:39,993
are you ok, baby?

3103
01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:40,527
And be in
a prevent defense

3104
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:41,060
are you ok, baby?

3105
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,830
Because north Dallas
to win this game

3106
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,598
are you ok, baby?

3107
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,332
Will have to keep
it in the air.

3108
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,065
Are you ok, baby?

3109
01:31:46,068 --> 01:31:47,835
This is the last time out
that north Dallas has.

3110
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,603
Are you ok, baby?

3111
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:50,304
They're probably
figuring out strategy

3112
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:51,004
are you ok, baby?

3113
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:51,822
That will allow them to run
3 or 4 plays in a row.

3114
01:31:51,823 --> 01:31:52,639
Are you ok, baby?

3115
01:31:52,641 --> 01:31:54,358
They have very little time left
if they're going to score.

3116
01:31:54,359 --> 01:31:56,076
Are you ok, baby?

3117
01:31:56,078 --> 01:31:57,528
Maxwell is signaling
to Phil elliott

3118
01:31:57,529 --> 01:31:58,979
are you ok, baby?

3119
01:31:58,981 --> 01:32:00,431
To come
into the ball game.

3120
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:01,882
Are you ok, baby?

3121
01:32:01,884 --> 01:32:03,584
I'll go with elliott
and huddle as wide receivers.

3122
01:32:03,585 --> 01:32:05,285
Are you ok, baby?

3123
01:32:05,287 --> 01:32:07,554
And we're going to look
for some pass plays...

3124
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:09,822
Are you ok, baby?

3125
01:32:09,825 --> 01:32:10,240
Hey, if he comes in,

3126
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:10,656
are you ok, baby?

3127
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:11,708
Then I want something
special for him.

3128
01:32:11,709 --> 01:32:12,758
Are you ok, baby?

3129
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:13,527
Having fun, boys?

3130
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:14,294
Are you ok, baby?

3131
01:32:14,296 --> 01:32:15,612
Blow it up
your asshole.

3132
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:16,929
Are you ok, baby?

3133
01:32:16,932 --> 01:32:17,614
How's the leg,
del?

3134
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:18,297
Are you ok, baby?

3135
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:18,699
Like your knee.

3136
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,099
Are you ok, baby?

3137
01:32:19,101 --> 01:32:20,384
I can't
feel anything.

3138
01:32:20,385 --> 01:32:21,668
Are you ok, baby?

3139
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:22,786
All right, huddle up!

3140
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:23,903
Are you ok, baby?

3141
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:28,875
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3142
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:29,326
I'm tired of weeks

3143
01:32:29,327 --> 01:32:29,776
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3144
01:32:29,778 --> 01:32:30,510
Sitting in my God damn
face all night.

3145
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:31,243
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3146
01:32:31,246 --> 01:32:33,230
But I hurt,
Seth.

3147
01:32:33,231 --> 01:32:35,215
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3148
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:35,949
I don't give a shit.

3149
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:36,682
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3150
01:32:36,685 --> 01:32:37,134
We all hurt.

3151
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:37,584
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3152
01:32:37,586 --> 01:32:38,268
All right, let's trap
the son of a bitch.

3153
01:32:38,269 --> 01:32:38,951
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3154
01:32:38,954 --> 01:32:40,587
O.W., Jo Bob, break his
fucking leg if you have to.

3155
01:32:40,588 --> 01:32:42,221
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3156
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:43,440
I want him out of there.

3157
01:32:43,441 --> 01:32:44,657
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3158
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:44,992
All right?

3159
01:32:44,993 --> 01:32:45,325
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3160
01:32:45,327 --> 01:32:46,126
Green-right-c-motion.

3161
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:46,926
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3162
01:32:46,929 --> 01:32:48,362
41-trap-delay on three.

3163
01:32:48,363 --> 01:32:49,796
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3164
01:32:49,798 --> 01:32:50,297
Ready?
Break!

3165
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:50,797
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3166
01:32:50,799 --> 01:32:51,548
Sportscaster: Maxwell brings
them out of the huddle.

3167
01:32:51,549 --> 01:32:52,298
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3168
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:53,450
You know Chicago's gonna
be coming on this play.

3169
01:32:53,451 --> 01:32:54,600
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3170
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:55,736
Let's see if they've
come up with a good play.

3171
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:56,870
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3172
01:32:56,872 --> 01:32:59,022
I wonder if Maxwell
called it or the coach.

3173
01:32:59,023 --> 01:33:01,173
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3174
01:33:01,176 --> 01:33:01,908
Huddle lines up
on the left

3175
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:02,641
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3176
01:33:02,644 --> 01:33:03,210
And Maxwell
down under center.

3177
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:03,777
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3178
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:05,462
The clock won't start
till the snap of the ball.

3179
01:33:05,463 --> 01:33:07,146
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3180
01:33:07,149 --> 01:33:09,066
Huddle's in motion
to the right.

3181
01:33:09,067 --> 01:33:10,984
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

3182
01:33:11,186 --> 01:33:12,852
Back to pass
is Maxwell.

3183
01:33:12,854 --> 01:33:14,237
It's a draw play
ball fake.

3184
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:15,621
Back to pass
is Maxwell.

3185
01:33:17,259 --> 01:33:19,793
[Whistles blow]

3186
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:21,161
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3187
01:33:21,163 --> 01:33:22,179
Sportscaster 2: Weeks,
the big defensive tackle

3188
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,196
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3189
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:23,597
For Chicago is down.

3190
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:23,997
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3191
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:25,549
This could be a serious blow
to the marauders chances

3192
01:33:25,550 --> 01:33:27,100
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3193
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:28,435
If he is
out of the game.

3194
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:29,769
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3195
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:30,837
North Dallas not only
gets a first down,

3196
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:31,904
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3197
01:33:31,907 --> 01:33:32,489
The clock
is stopped.

3198
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:33,072
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3199
01:33:33,075 --> 01:33:34,641
It looks like he got
hurt in a trap block

3200
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:36,208
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3201
01:33:36,211 --> 01:33:37,294
By Jo Bob priddy
and o.W. Shaddock.

3202
01:33:37,295 --> 01:33:38,378
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3203
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,830
Weeks had been beating
those two all night

3204
01:33:39,831 --> 01:33:41,281
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3205
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:42,049
And they finally
got back at him.

3206
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:42,816
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3207
01:33:42,818 --> 01:33:44,084
And a big first down
for north Dallas.

3208
01:33:44,085 --> 01:33:45,351
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3209
01:33:45,354 --> 01:33:47,154
Jesus, Jo Bob,
we hurt him bad.

3210
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:48,955
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3211
01:33:48,957 --> 01:33:50,173
Fuck him.

3212
01:33:50,174 --> 01:33:51,390
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3213
01:33:51,393 --> 01:33:52,576
Fuck it.

3214
01:33:52,577 --> 01:33:53,760
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3215
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:54,227
Huddle up.

3216
01:33:54,228 --> 01:33:54,693
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3217
01:33:54,696 --> 01:33:56,246
Huddle up!

3218
01:33:56,247 --> 01:33:57,797
Jo Bob: Suck on that,
weeks!

3219
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:01,668
Aah!

3220
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:07,741
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3221
01:34:07,743 --> 01:34:08,959
Can you get the outside
linebacker, Phil?

3222
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,176
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3223
01:34:10,178 --> 01:34:11,945
Del, it's your chance
to be a star.

3224
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:13,713
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3225
01:34:13,715 --> 01:34:14,331
Red-lax-92.

3226
01:34:14,332 --> 01:34:14,948
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3227
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:15,966
First sound,
all right?

3228
01:34:15,967 --> 01:34:16,983
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3229
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:17,384
Ready?
Break!

3230
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:17,784
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3231
01:34:17,786 --> 01:34:19,019
Sportscaster 2:
North Dallas has the ball,

3232
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,253
let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3233
01:34:20,255 --> 01:34:20,987
18 yards away
from a touchdown,

3234
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:21,720
let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3235
01:34:21,723 --> 01:34:22,939
But they have only 24 seconds
left in the game.

3236
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,156
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3237
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:25,058
They have to score
if they're going to tie

3238
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:25,958
let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3239
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:27,377
This championship contest up
and send it into overtime.

3240
01:34:27,378 --> 01:34:28,794
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3241
01:34:28,797 --> 01:34:30,230
Maxwell sends huddle
and elliott to the left

3242
01:34:30,231 --> 01:34:31,664
let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3243
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:33,050
So they overload
Chicago's right side

3244
01:34:33,051 --> 01:34:34,434
let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3245
01:34:34,436 --> 01:34:34,935
On 1st and 10.

3246
01:34:34,936 --> 01:34:35,435
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3247
01:34:35,437 --> 01:34:36,269
Back to pass,
Maxwell.

3248
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:37,102
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3249
01:34:37,105 --> 01:34:38,221
And the pass is to
huddle on the sidelines.

3250
01:34:38,222 --> 01:34:39,338
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3251
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:40,691
There's a flag down
and huddle is hurt.

3252
01:34:40,692 --> 01:34:42,042
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3253
01:34:42,044 --> 01:34:43,527
Oh, what a hit
from the secondary!

3254
01:34:43,528 --> 01:34:45,011
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3255
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:46,146
Let's check
the penalty marker.

3256
01:34:46,147 --> 01:34:47,280
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3257
01:34:47,282 --> 01:34:48,331
The indication
from the official

3258
01:34:48,332 --> 01:34:49,381
let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3259
01:34:49,384 --> 01:34:50,784
Is offensive holding
against the bulls.

3260
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:52,185
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3261
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:53,270
So instead of a gain
for huddle,

3262
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:54,354
let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3263
01:34:54,356 --> 01:34:55,205
It will be
a 10-yard penalty

3264
01:34:55,206 --> 01:34:56,055
let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3265
01:34:56,058 --> 01:34:56,723
Against
north Dallas,

3266
01:34:56,724 --> 01:34:57,389
let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3267
01:34:57,392 --> 01:34:58,875
And the play
is erased.

3268
01:34:58,876 --> 01:35:00,359
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

3269
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:08,468
God damn it.
Look at his face.

3270
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:09,319
Fix his face!

3271
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,169
God damn it.
Look at his face.

3272
01:35:10,172 --> 01:35:10,821
Elliott!

3273
01:35:10,822 --> 01:35:11,471
God damn it.
Look at his face.

3274
01:35:11,473 --> 01:35:11,922
Elliott!

3275
01:35:11,923 --> 01:35:12,372
God damn it.
Look at his face.

3276
01:35:12,374 --> 01:35:12,789
Get up, delma!

3277
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:13,205
God damn it.
Look at his face.

3278
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,074
Get back
in the huddle!

3279
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:14,941
God damn it.
Look at his face.

3280
01:35:14,943 --> 01:35:16,376
The doctor
will look after him!

3281
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,810
God damn it.
Look at his face.

3282
01:35:22,751 --> 01:35:26,953
You get back in that huddle now
or off the field!

3283
01:35:29,491 --> 01:35:32,392
[Groaning]

3284
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:35,995
Sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3285
01:35:35,997 --> 01:35:36,946
Sportscaster 2: You can see
this play was well set up

3286
01:35:36,947 --> 01:35:37,896
sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3287
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:38,565
As huddle takes
a little step back

3288
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:39,232
sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3289
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:39,716
From the line of scrimmage

3290
01:35:39,717 --> 01:35:40,199
sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3291
01:35:40,202 --> 01:35:40,834
And takes a swing pass
from Maxwell.

3292
01:35:40,835 --> 01:35:41,467
Sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3293
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:42,336
He is wide open
when he starts downfield.

3294
01:35:42,337 --> 01:35:43,203
Sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3295
01:35:43,205 --> 01:35:44,504
But then he grabs his leg,
obviously in pain,

3296
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:45,804
sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3297
01:35:45,807 --> 01:35:47,624
And Francis Chapman comes up
and lays a massive blow on him.

3298
01:35:47,625 --> 01:35:49,442
Sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3299
01:35:49,444 --> 01:35:50,160

Sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3307

Sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3309
01:35:57,352 --> 01:35:58,285
Let's stick it
up their ass.

3310
01:35:58,286 --> 01:35:59,219
Sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3311
01:35:59,221 --> 01:36:01,121

3312
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:03,022
Sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3313

Red-right-76

3314
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:03,957
sportscaster: Let's take

Sportscaster: Let's take
a second look at that play.

3319
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:12,298
You throw it,
partner,

3320
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:13,533
I'll catch it.

3321
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:14,767
You throw it,
partner,

3322
01:36:18,039 --> 01:36:19,172
both plays on 2.

3323
01:36:19,174 --> 01:36:19,656
Ready...

3324
01:36:19,657 --> 01:36:20,139
Both plays on 2.

3325
01:36:20,142 --> 01:36:20,457
Break!

3326
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:20,773

Sportscaster 2: The bulls

01:36:24,546 --> 01:36:25,745
But they are 28 yards
away from the score.

3330
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:26,945
Both plays on 2.

3331
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:28,114
Sportscaster: 1st and 20,
as Maxwell sets them up.

3332
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:29,281
Both plays on 2.

3333
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:30,584
The clock will start
when the snap is made.

3334
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:31,885
Both plays on 2.

3335
01:36:31,887 --> 01:36:32,686
Elliott is in motion
to the right.

3336
01:36:32,687 --> 01:36:33,486
Both plays on 2.

3337
01:36:33,488 --> 01:36:34,404
Maxwell's back to pass.

3338
01:36:34,405 --> 01:36:35,321
Both plays on 2.

3339
01:36:35,323 --> 01:36:36,256
He's going to elliott.

3340
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:37,190
Both plays on 2.

3341
01:36:37,192 --> 01:36:38,558
It's complete
at the 15-yard line,

3343
01:36:39,928 --> 01:36:40,544
But the clock
is running.

01:36:41,163 --> 01:36:41,695
Good catch by elliott,

But he didn't
get out of bounds.

3348
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:43,495
Both plays on 2.

3349
01:36:43,498 --> 01:36:45,198
They've got to hurry to get
another chance to score

3350
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:46,899
both plays on 2.

3351
01:36:46,902 --> 01:36:47,617
Before this game
is over.

01:36:47,618 --> 01:36:48,333
Both plays on 2.

3353
01:36:48,336 --> 01:36:49,953
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

3354
01:36:49,954 --> 01:36:51,571
Both plays on 2.

3355
01:36:51,573 --> 01:36:52,889
They got
the play off.

3356
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,206
Both plays on 2.

3357
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:15,962
Yeow!
Yeah!

3358
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,835

God damn!

3361
01:37:25,189 --> 01:37:26,505
Great catch!

3362
01:37:32,614 --> 01:37:33,513
Good pass, man.

3363
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:34,331
You're my
ace in the hole.

3364
01:37:34,332 --> 01:37:35,148
Good pass, man.

3365
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:36,032
Good pass. Yeah.

3366
01:37:36,033 --> 01:37:36,915
Good pass, man.

3367
01:37:36,918 --> 01:37:38,017
Sportscaster: North Dallas
has a chance to tie it.

3368
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,117
Good pass, man.

3369
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,503
And prejza, the outstanding
kicker, is in there.

3370
01:37:40,504 --> 01:37:41,887
Good pass, man.

3371
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:42,739
Sportscaster 2: North Dallas
couldn't have the ball

3372
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:43,589
good pass, man.

3373
01:37:43,592 --> 01:37:44,925
In any better hands
in this case--or feet

3374
01:37:44,926 --> 01:37:46,259
good pass, man.

3375
01:37:46,261 --> 01:37:47,844
Because prejza has kicked
43 straight extra points.

3376
01:37:47,845 --> 01:37:49,428
Good pass, man.

3377
01:37:49,431 --> 01:37:50,013
That's a new
north Dallas record.

3378
01:37:50,014 --> 01:37:50,596
Good pass, man.

3379
01:37:50,599 --> 01:37:52,399
They're calling him
"Mr. automatic."

3380
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,200
Good pass, man.

3381
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:54,617
There's the snap.

3382
01:37:54,618 --> 01:37:55,033
Good pass, man.

3383
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:56,186
The ball gets away
from hartman.

3384
01:37:56,187 --> 01:37:57,337
Good pass, man.

3385
01:37:57,339 --> 01:37:58,188
It's on the ground.

3386
01:37:58,189 --> 01:37:59,038
Good pass, man.

3387
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,490
Chicago recovers.
The game is over.

3388
01:38:00,491 --> 01:38:01,941
Good pass, man.

3389
01:38:01,943 --> 01:38:02,492
The Chicago marauders

3390
01:38:02,493 --> 01:38:03,042
good pass, man.

3391
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:03,810
Have held off
the north Dallas rally

3392
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:04,577
good pass, man.

3393
01:38:04,579 --> 01:38:06,112
To win 14-13,
and what a finish.

3394
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:07,646
Good pass, man.

3395
01:38:07,649 --> 01:38:08,632
That snap seemed
right on the money.

3396
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:09,616
Good pass, man.

3397
01:38:09,618 --> 01:38:11,351
Hartman just
couldn't control it.

3398
01:38:11,352 --> 01:38:13,085
Good pass, man.

3399
01:38:13,088 --> 01:38:13,670
What a shame
for north Dallas

3400
01:38:13,671 --> 01:38:14,253
good pass, man.

3401
01:38:14,256 --> 01:38:15,288
After making such
a dramatic comeback

3402
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:16,321
good pass, man.

3403
01:38:16,324 --> 01:38:16,990
In the last few seconds.

3404
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:17,657
Good pass, man.

3405
01:38:17,659 --> 01:38:18,925
An agonizing defeat
for north Dallas.

3406
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:20,192
Good pass, man.

3407
01:38:20,195 --> 01:38:21,361
They thought they had
the ball game tied.

3408
01:38:21,362 --> 01:38:22,528
Good pass, man.

3409
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:23,997
They felt overtime
was upcoming.

3410
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:25,465
Good pass, man.

3411
01:38:25,467 --> 01:38:26,316
And the Chicago
marauders

3412
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:27,166
good pass, man.

3413
01:38:27,168 --> 01:38:28,101

By 1 point.

Good pass, man.

3417
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:35,174
Listen, Phil,

he needs surgery.

3423
01:38:41,032 --> 01:38:42,115
Listen, Phil,

3424
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:51,991
hey, elliott.

3425

You played good.

3427
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:56,596
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3428
01:38:56,598 --> 01:38:58,515
Coach: I wish we could
say the same thing for you.

01:38:58,516 --> 01:39:00,433
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3430
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,985
You should've studied
weeks' tendencies.

3431
01:39:01,986 --> 01:39:03,536
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3432
01:39:03,538 --> 01:39:04,354
I thought I did.

3433
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:05,171
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3434
01:39:05,173 --> 01:39:05,688
You don't listen.

You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3436
01:39:06,207 --> 01:39:07,790
We would've won if we'd
studied those tendencies.

3437
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:09,374
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3438
01:39:09,377 --> 01:39:10,894

out there tonight.

3440
01:39:12,414 --> 01:39:12,963
To bring in the game

you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3442
01:39:13,515 --> 01:39:14,614
Except fucking facts
and tendencies!

You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3444
01:39:15,717 --> 01:39:16,616
To you, it's

You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3446
01:39:17,519 --> 01:39:18,318

You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3450
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,989
We work harder

01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:23,589
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3452
01:39:23,591 --> 01:39:24,590
When we're dead tired
in the fourth quarter,

01:39:24,591 --> 01:39:25,590
you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3454
01:39:25,593 --> 01:39:26,559
Winning's got to mean
more than just money.

01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,526
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3456

You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3458

Job? Job? I don't
want no fucking job!

I want some fucking
team spirit!

3465
01:39:36,787 --> 01:39:38,136
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3466
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:38,638
This ain't no high school.

3467
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:39,138
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3468
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:39,872
You don't have to love
each other to play.

3469
01:39:39,873 --> 01:39:40,605
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3470
01:39:40,608 --> 01:39:41,557
That's just what I mean,
you bastard.

3471
01:39:41,558 --> 01:39:42,507
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3472
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:43,309
Every time
I call it a game,

3473
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,109
you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3474
01:39:44,112 --> 01:39:44,544
You call it a business,

3475
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:44,977
you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3476
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,846
And every time
I call it business,

3477
01:39:45,847 --> 01:39:46,713
you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3478
01:39:46,715 --> 01:39:47,214
You call it a game--

3479
01:39:47,215 --> 01:39:47,714
you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3480
01:39:47,716 --> 01:39:49,115
You and b.A. And all
the rest of you coaches

3481
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:50,515
you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3482
01:39:50,518 --> 01:39:51,434
Are chickenshit
cocksuckers.

3483
01:39:51,435 --> 01:39:52,351
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3484
01:39:52,354 --> 01:39:53,286
No feeling
for the game at all.

3485
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:54,219
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3486
01:39:54,222 --> 01:39:55,121
You'll win,
but it'll just be

3487
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:56,021
you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3488
01:39:56,024 --> 01:39:56,389
Numbers on a scoreboard.

3489
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:56,755
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3490
01:39:56,758 --> 01:39:57,490
Numbers, that's all
you care about.

3491
01:39:57,491 --> 01:39:58,223
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3492
01:39:58,226 --> 01:39:59,209
Fuck, man, that's
not enough for me.

3493
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:00,193
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3494
01:40:00,195 --> 01:40:00,760
I don't have
to listen--

3495
01:40:00,761 --> 01:40:01,326
you looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3496
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:01,794
Oh, yes,
you fucking do!

3497
01:40:01,795 --> 01:40:02,260
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3498
01:40:02,263 --> 01:40:02,862
You got to listen
to me for once!

3499
01:40:02,863 --> 01:40:03,462
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3500
01:40:03,465 --> 01:40:04,881
All you coaches are
chickenshit cocksuckers!

3501
01:40:04,882 --> 01:40:06,298
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3502
01:40:06,301 --> 01:40:07,967
You're all chickenshit
cocksuckers!

3503
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:09,634
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3504
01:40:09,637 --> 01:40:11,654
God damn you!

3505
01:40:11,655 --> 01:40:13,672
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3506
01:40:13,675 --> 01:40:14,607
Far out.

3507
01:40:14,608 --> 01:40:15,540
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

3508
01:40:41,636 --> 01:40:44,303
[Groans]

3509
01:40:51,713 --> 01:40:56,582
Hey, del,
how you doing?

3510
01:41:04,426 --> 01:41:05,324
Hey, come on, man.

3511
01:41:05,326 --> 01:41:06,492
You'll be back.

3512
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:07,659
Hey, come on, man.

3513
01:41:11,366 --> 01:41:13,232
Um, um...

3514
01:41:13,234 --> 01:41:13,499
[Sobbing]

3515
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:13,765
Um, um...

3516
01:41:13,768 --> 01:41:14,183
Come on. Hey, del.

3517
01:41:14,184 --> 01:41:14,599
Um, um...

01:41:14,602 --> 01:41:15,918
Come on.
You're gonna be back.

3519
01:41:15,919 --> 01:41:17,235
Um, um...

3520
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:18,521
Come on, huh?

3521
01:41:18,522 --> 01:41:19,805
Um, um...

3522
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:41,427
Come on.

3523
01:41:44,299 --> 01:41:46,165
Come on.

3524
01:41:51,539 --> 01:41:53,439
Whoa.

3525
01:41:57,745 --> 01:41:59,846
Good boy.

3526
01:42:03,852 --> 01:42:04,851
Hi.

3527
01:42:04,853 --> 01:42:05,702
Hi.

3528
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:06,552
Hi.

3529
01:42:06,554 --> 01:42:07,637
Are you all right?

3530
01:42:07,638 --> 01:42:08,721
Hi.

3531
01:42:08,723 --> 01:42:09,289
Yeah.

3532
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:09,856
Hi.

3533
01:42:09,858 --> 01:42:11,608
Just slightly damaged.

3534
01:42:11,609 --> 01:42:13,359
Hi.

3535
01:42:14,262 --> 01:42:17,497
Look, um, I'm sorry
about the other night.

3536
01:42:17,499 --> 01:42:19,532
I had no right,
no right at all.

3537
01:42:19,533 --> 01:42:21,566
Look, um, I'm sorry
about the other night.

3538
01:42:26,441 --> 01:42:28,541
You had a right.

3539
01:42:33,381 --> 01:42:34,881
You see the game?

3540
01:42:34,883 --> 01:42:35,281
Yeah.

3541
01:42:35,282 --> 01:42:35,680
You see the game?

3542
01:42:35,683 --> 01:42:36,182
See the catch I made?

3543
01:42:36,183 --> 01:42:36,682
You see the game?

3544
01:42:36,684 --> 01:42:37,433
Yeah.
It was terrific.

3545
01:42:37,434 --> 01:42:38,183
You see the game?

3546
01:42:38,186 --> 01:42:38,868
I'm sorry you lost.

3547
01:42:38,869 --> 01:42:39,551
You see the game?

3548
01:42:39,554 --> 01:42:41,054
I thought
I was gonna start that game.

3549
01:42:41,055 --> 01:42:42,555
You see the game?

3550
01:42:42,557 --> 01:42:43,590
Hell, I even
shot up my knee,

3551
01:42:43,591 --> 01:42:44,624
you see the game?

3552
01:42:44,626 --> 01:42:46,242
But they weren't
gonna let me start.

3553
01:42:46,243 --> 01:42:47,859
You see the game?

3554
01:42:47,862 --> 01:42:48,277
They were using me

3555
01:42:48,278 --> 01:42:48,693
you see the game?

3556
01:42:48,696 --> 01:42:50,263
To get another ball player
to deaden his leg.

3557
01:42:50,264 --> 01:42:51,831
You see the game?

3558
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:52,632
God, that's awful.

3559
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:53,432
You see the game?

3560
01:42:53,434 --> 01:42:54,801
Yeah. Well,
that's the way it is.

3561
01:42:54,802 --> 01:42:56,169
You see the game?

3562
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:57,904
But what's important
is my performing...

3563
01:42:57,905 --> 01:42:59,638
You see the game?

3564
01:42:59,641 --> 01:43:01,624
The moment of the catch,
that feeling, that high.

3565
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:03,608
You see the game?

3566
01:43:03,611 --> 01:43:04,660
Hell,
I can take the crap.

3567
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:05,710
You see the game?

3568
01:43:05,713 --> 01:43:06,646
I can take
the manipulation.

3569
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:07,580
You see the game?

3570
01:43:07,582 --> 01:43:08,264
I can take the pain.

3571
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:08,947
You see the game?

3572
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:10,333
As long as I get
that chance every Sunday.

3573
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:11,717
You see the game?

3574
01:43:11,719 --> 01:43:13,736
I think that this game
is twisting your mind.

3575
01:43:13,737 --> 01:43:15,754
You see the game?

3576
01:43:15,757 --> 01:43:17,674
The game's not twisting
my mind, Charlotte.

3577
01:43:17,675 --> 01:43:19,592
You see the game?

3578
01:43:19,594 --> 01:43:20,193
I know the game.

3579
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:20,793
You see the game?

3580
01:43:20,795 --> 01:43:23,229
It's the rules
they make up.

3581
01:43:23,230 --> 01:43:25,664
You see the game?

3582
01:43:26,801 --> 01:43:28,401
I'm gonna play,

3583
01:43:28,403 --> 01:43:29,586
so I'm going
by their rules.

3584
01:43:29,587 --> 01:43:30,770
I'm gonna play,

3585
01:43:30,772 --> 01:43:32,088
you can't separate
one from the other.

3586
01:43:32,089 --> 01:43:33,405
I'm gonna play,

3587
01:43:33,408 --> 01:43:34,974
yeah, but I can't buck
their system or fight them

3588
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:36,541
I'm gonna play,

3589
01:43:36,544 --> 01:43:37,660
any more than
you can drop out.

3590
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:38,777
I'm gonna play,

3591
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:40,063
if you've made up
your mind,

3592
01:43:40,064 --> 01:43:41,347
I'm gonna play,

3593
01:43:41,349 --> 01:43:41,881
why did you
come to me?

3594
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:42,414
I'm gonna play,

3595
01:43:42,417 --> 01:43:44,467
'cause I care
about you...

3596
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:46,518
I'm gonna play,

3597
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:49,589
and I want
to see you again.

3598
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:04,604
I've got a meeting
with Conrad hunter.

3599
01:44:04,606 --> 01:44:05,789
Hell, I can't let him see

3600
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:06,973
I've got a meeting
with Conrad hunter.

3601
01:44:06,975 --> 01:44:08,374
That the merchandise
is damaged.

3602
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:09,774
I've got a meeting

Yeah.

3606
01:44:12,463 --> 01:44:12,678
I've got a meeting
with Conrad hunter.

3607
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:13,996
You know,
when you think about it,

3608
01:44:13,997 --> 01:44:15,313
I've got a meeting
with Conrad hunter.

3609
01:44:15,316 --> 01:44:17,500
They're not worse
than anybody else, really.

01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:19,685
I've got a meeting
with Conrad hunter.

Do you understand that?

Let me give you
a little hint.

3642
01:45:45,873 --> 01:45:49,709
I think you'd best answer,
Phil, boy.

3643
01:45:56,384 --> 01:45:58,617
All right.

I was just paranoid.

Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3798
01:50:06,734 --> 01:50:07,333

Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3800

Are you part of this,
b.A.?

You have to give something
back to the game.

Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3804

My nose is busted.
I can't even breathe through it.

3805

Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3806
01:50:15,876 --> 01:50:16,425
I can hardly stand up.

3807

Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3808
01:50:16,978 --> 01:50:18,060
I haven't slept
more than three hours

Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3812
01:50:20,114 --> 01:50:21,113
Isn't that giving
something back?

3813

Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3814
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:24,066
There's pieces of me scattered
from here to Pittsburgh

3815
01:50:24,067 --> 01:50:26,017
are you part of this,
b.A.?

3816
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:26,502
On these football fields.

3817
01:50:26,503 --> 01:50:26,985
Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3818
01:50:26,988 --> 01:50:28,905
Isn't that giving something
back to the game?

3819
01:50:28,906 --> 01:50:30,823
Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3820
01:50:30,825 --> 01:50:31,724
Isn't it?

3821
01:50:31,725 --> 01:50:32,624
Are you part of this,
b.A.?

3822
01:50:36,631 --> 01:50:37,830
B.A...

3823
01:50:37,832 --> 01:50:38,431
B.A...

3824
01:50:38,432 --> 01:50:39,031
B.A...

3825
01:50:39,033 --> 01:50:39,648
B.A...

3826
01:50:39,649 --> 01:50:40,264
B.A...

3827
01:50:40,267 --> 01:50:42,267
How can you
take this away from me?

3828
01:50:42,268 --> 01:50:44,268
B.A...

3829
01:50:44,271 --> 01:50:45,804
How can you do this?

3830
01:50:45,805 --> 01:50:47,338
B.A...

3831
01:50:51,245 --> 01:50:53,679
Ok, Phil.

3832
01:50:53,681 --> 01:50:55,464
Only now I
speak for myself.

3833
01:50:55,465 --> 01:50:57,248
Ok, Phil.

3834
01:50:57,251 --> 01:50:59,101
And it's your
childish attitude.

3835
01:50:59,102 --> 01:51:00,952
Ok, Phil.

3836
01:51:00,955 --> 01:51:01,988
You hurt the team.

3837
01:51:01,989 --> 01:51:03,022
Ok, Phil.

3838
01:51:04,225 --> 01:51:04,823
Team?

3839
01:51:04,825 --> 01:51:07,259
Oh, Christ's sake, b.A.,
we're not the team!

3840
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:09,694
Team?

3841
01:51:09,697 --> 01:51:10,680
They're the team!

3842
01:51:10,681 --> 01:51:11,664
Team?

3843
01:51:11,666 --> 01:51:12,999
These guys right here,
b.A. They're the team.

3844
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,333
Team?

3845
01:51:14,335 --> 01:51:15,017
We're the equipment!

3846
01:51:15,018 --> 01:51:15,700
Team?

3847
01:51:15,703 --> 01:51:16,952
We're the jock straps,
the helmets.

3848
01:51:16,953 --> 01:51:18,202
Team?

3849
01:51:18,205 --> 01:51:18,754
They just depreciate us

3850
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:19,304
team?

3851
01:51:19,306 --> 01:51:20,789
And take us off
the God damn tax returns!

3852
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:22,273
Team?

3853
01:51:22,276 --> 01:51:23,542
That's what that is.

3854
01:51:23,543 --> 01:51:24,809
Team?

3855
01:51:29,917 --> 01:51:31,950
Yeah. Well...

3856
01:51:38,225 --> 01:51:41,326
But I was good
when I played.

3857
01:51:46,267 --> 01:51:47,166
Because the only thing

3858
01:51:47,168 --> 01:51:49,068
that's real
in that game...

3859
01:51:49,069 --> 01:51:50,969
Because the only thing

3860
01:51:50,971 --> 01:51:52,454
is me...

3861
01:51:52,455 --> 01:51:53,938
Because the only thing

3862
01:51:53,941 --> 01:51:55,674
and that's enough.

3863
01:51:55,675 --> 01:51:57,408
Because the only thing

3864
01:51:57,411 --> 01:51:58,694
well, I feel
for you, Phil,

3865
01:51:58,695 --> 01:51:59,978
because the only thing

3866
01:51:59,980 --> 01:52:01,347
but you confused
luck and brain.

3867
01:52:01,348 --> 01:52:02,715
Because the only thing

3868
01:52:02,717 --> 01:52:03,849
you betrayed me.
You betrayed my family.

3869
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:04,982
Because the only thing

3870
01:52:04,985 --> 01:52:05,868
I tried to warn you.

3871
01:52:05,869 --> 01:52:06,752
Because the only thing

3872
01:52:06,754 --> 01:52:07,853
you violated
the morals clause

3873
01:52:07,854 --> 01:52:08,953
because the only thing

3874
01:52:08,956 --> 01:52:09,388
of your contract.

3875
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:09,821
Because the only thing

3876
01:52:09,824 --> 01:52:10,289
it's that simple,

3877
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:10,755
because the only thing

3878
01:52:10,758 --> 01:52:11,474
so, pending
a league hearing,

3879
01:52:11,475 --> 01:52:12,191
because the only thing

3880
01:52:12,193 --> 01:52:14,143
you're hereby suspended
without pay.

3881
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,094
Because the only thing

3882
01:52:16,097 --> 01:52:17,063
yeah?

3883
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:18,030
Because the only thing

3884
01:52:19,066 --> 01:52:20,933
is that what it is, Emmett?

3885
01:52:20,935 --> 01:52:21,984
Is that what this whole
charade has been about,

3886
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:23,034
is that what it is, Emmett?

3887
01:52:23,037 --> 01:52:24,036
So you don't have
to pay my contract?

3888
01:52:24,037 --> 01:52:25,036
Is that what it is, Emmett?

3889
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:27,390
I don't need your money
that bad. I quit!

3890
01:52:27,391 --> 01:52:29,742
Is that what it is, Emmett?

3891
01:52:50,498 --> 01:52:53,265
You are right, b.A.

3892
01:52:53,267 --> 01:52:54,567
Thank you.

3893
01:52:54,568 --> 01:52:55,868
You are right, b.A.

3894
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:57,887
It's time to put away
childish things.

3895
01:52:57,888 --> 01:52:59,905
You are right, b.A.

3896
01:53:37,178 --> 01:53:40,078
Things get ugly up there?

3897
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:48,353
Pretty ugly.

3898
01:53:50,291 --> 01:53:52,958
My name come up?

3899
01:53:53,928 --> 01:53:54,993
Uh...

3900
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:55,677
Ahem.

3901
01:53:55,678 --> 01:53:56,360
Uh...

3902
01:53:56,363 --> 01:53:58,297
There's no reason
to bring you into this.

3903
01:53:58,298 --> 01:54:00,232
Uh...

3904
01:54:02,236 --> 01:54:04,536
They suspend you?

3905
01:54:04,538 --> 01:54:05,237
I quit.

3906
01:54:05,238 --> 01:54:05,937
They suspend you?

3907
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:07,940
I can't take it.
They want too much.

3908
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:09,941
They suspend you?

3909
01:54:10,444 --> 01:54:13,378
Too much ain't enough.

3910
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:14,663
Not for them.

3911
01:54:14,664 --> 01:54:15,947
Too much ain't enough.

3912
01:54:16,984 --> 01:54:19,484
What you gonna do?

3913
01:54:19,987 --> 01:54:22,221
I don't know.

3914
01:54:24,024 --> 01:54:24,990
I'm gonna go home.

3915
01:54:24,992 --> 01:54:25,658
I'm gonna get
in bed with Charlotte.

3916
01:54:25,659 --> 01:54:26,325
I'm gonna go home.

3917
01:54:26,327 --> 01:54:27,093
I'm gonna spend
a week with her.

3918
01:54:27,094 --> 01:54:27,860
I'm gonna go home.

3919
01:54:27,862 --> 01:54:28,627
I'm gonna heal up.

3920
01:54:28,628 --> 01:54:29,393
I'm gonna go home.

3921
01:54:29,396 --> 01:54:32,231
I'll spend time with her
and take it easy.

3922
01:54:32,232 --> 01:54:35,067
I'm gonna go home.

3923
01:54:35,069 --> 01:54:35,718
Hoss.

3924
01:54:35,719 --> 01:54:36,368
I'm gonna go home.

3925
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:36,785
Hmm?

3926
01:54:36,786 --> 01:54:37,201
I'm gonna go home.

3927
01:54:37,204 --> 01:54:38,771
I appreciate you keeping
my name out of it.

3928
01:54:38,772 --> 01:54:40,339
I'm gonna go home.

3929
01:54:40,341 --> 01:54:41,657
Uh, no sweat.

3930
01:54:41,658 --> 01:54:42,974
I'm gonna go home.

3931
01:54:46,547 --> 01:54:49,114
You knew about it.

3932
01:54:50,384 --> 01:54:55,053
You know everything,
don't you, Max?

3933
01:54:55,055 --> 01:54:56,155
That I do, poot.

3934
01:54:56,156 --> 01:54:57,256
You know everything,
don't you, Max?

3935
01:55:00,961 --> 01:55:03,195
That I do.

3936
01:55:11,639 --> 01:55:13,639
Hey, poot.

3937
01:55:13,641 --> 01:55:14,073
Yeah?

3938
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:14,506
Hey, poot.

3939
01:55:14,508 --> 01:55:16,492
Got any of them
old pain killers?

3940
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:18,477
Hey, poot.

3941
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:24,416
You keep 'em, cowboy.

3942
01:55:24,418 --> 01:55:25,818
You're gonna need 'em.

3943
01:55:25,819 --> 01:55:27,219
You keep 'em, cowboy.

3944
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:32,391
Ahh.

3945
01:55:32,393 --> 01:55:33,175
Hey, Seth.

3946
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:33,958
Ahh.

3947
01:55:33,961 --> 01:55:36,211
We really had 'em worried
in Chicago, didn't we?

3948
01:55:36,212 --> 01:55:38,462
Ahh.

3949
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:41,400
Best catch
I ever seen, poot.

3950
01:55:41,402 --> 01:55:43,252
Not a bad pass, either.

3951
01:55:43,253 --> 01:55:45,103
Best catch
I ever seen, poot.

3952
01:55:46,073 --> 01:55:48,573
Good luck on Sunday.

3953
01:55:51,145 --> 01:55:52,477
Hey, poot.

3954
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:53,295
Yeah?

3955
01:55:53,296 --> 01:55:54,112
Hey, poot.
