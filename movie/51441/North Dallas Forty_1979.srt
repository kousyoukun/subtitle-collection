can do.

166
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,063
All right, Sue.

167
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,064
We got plenty.

168
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,065
All right?

169
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,568
Hey, how you doing?

170
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,568
Hey, Billy.

171
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:11,069
See you later.

172
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,589
Being a little
hard on yourself, Andy.

173
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,589
Yeah, l know.

174
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,090
See that stewardess
over there?

175
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,091
Which one?

176
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,594
That one, there.

177
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:37,731
Goddamn, does she
get off on football.

178
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:41,067
Alan got some tit from
her the other night

179
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:42,267
just by showing her

180
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,570
that little bruise
on his calf.

181
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:47,607
l figure if she
gives up some tit

182
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:50,108
just by showing her
a bruise,

183
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:52,610
once she sees
this blood here,

184
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:55,113
she might give up
the whole thing.

185
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:56,178
Know what l mean?
Uh-huh.

186
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:04,055
l'd love to sit here
and talk, but l can't.

187
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:07,558
l got to test Balford's
theory of erotica.

188
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:09,057
Check you later, baby.

189
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,562
He's real intelligent,
ain't he?

190
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,564
Baby.

191
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,065
You like that?

192
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:20,735
Come on, Andy,
l'm with her.

193
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,237
Andy, l'm with her,
l said.

194
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,782
lt's nice to see

195
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:40,786
there's a little romance
Ieft in the world.

196
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:54,498
lt's an old story--
boy meets boy.

197
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:55,798
Well, l love
happy endings.

198
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:58,167
Oh, really? Good.
Now we can sit back

199
00:12:58,232 --> 00:13:00,836
and wait for the
real obscenities.

200
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:02,404
You mean it gets worse?

201
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,939
lt definitely
gets different.

202
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:06,441
See, alcohol
and fear

203
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:09,044
makes for a good
combination.

204
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:10,043
fear?

205
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,044
Mm-hmm.

206
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,546
What are they
afraid of?

207
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:14,481
Falling on their
asses in Chicago.

208
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:20,052
Who are you,

209

doing here?

the same question.

213
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,326
l'm supposed to be here

214

from all this.

215
00:13:30,661 --> 00:13:32,598
Oh, yeah. See,
l'm a very funny guy.

216
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:35,100
The newspapers call me
the team funnyman.

217
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:39,372
Obviously you can't
believe evey thing you read.

218
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:40,370
l'm sorry.

219
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:41,704
l'm not very good

220
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,707
at this
small talk stuff.

221
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:46,710
ln fact, l learned
all my social graces

222
00:13:46,774 --> 00:13:48,109
from football coaches,

223
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:50,747
so just give me
another ty, huh?

224
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:52,246
OK, team funnyman.

225
00:13:56,684 --> 00:13:59,021
You've got
fantastic eyes.

226

Hey, quit pushing
On me, man.

Put me down!

230
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,798
Why can't somebody
stop him?

What, are you crazy?

00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,467
Look at him.

Jo Bob's here
to remind everybody

that the meanest

all the rules.

l don't agree with that.

239
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:33,885

enter into it.

How can you
tolerate that?

What the hell are you
tying to prove,

taking on Jo Bob
over some chick?

For Christ's sake,
Seth, shit.

287

at the time.

the obituaries.

Goddamn it, son,
what did she expect?

298
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,942
These girls know
what happens

00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:59,642
at these parties.

300

That's why they

like that to me.

Oh, for Christ's sake,

Damn it, quit
aggravating him.

what he wants.

00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:30,083
Ow. Ow.

495
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:31,251
Come on.

496
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:34,423
Ow. You always
hurt me,Jo.

497
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:59,779
B.A. wants me to adjust
to sitting on the bench.

498
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:02,212
Hell, l'll die
on the bench.

499
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:05,048
What's the sense
of the team winning

500
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:06,882
if l don't survive, huh?

501
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:08,716
You'll survive.

502
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:11,719
Really?

503
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:14,723
You know what l do?

504
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:18,226
l pull for the other team,
so we'll get behind

505
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,895
and B.A. will have
to put me in.

506
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,094
That's weird.

507
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,765
Why don't you
just quit?

508
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,071
Well, what would l do

509
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:35,741
that wouldn't be
the same or worse?

510
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:39,244
lt's the only thing
l know how to do good.

511
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,246
Best hands in the league,
you know.

512
00:29:49,817 --> 00:29:51,754
Phil,
do you love me?

513
00:29:57,492 --> 00:29:58,594
Sort of.

514
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,268
What kind of
an answer is that?

515
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:08,269
Well...

516
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:12,775
it's the only kind of answer
l know how to give

517
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:16,777
when somebody l really like
needs to know the truth.

518
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:31,790
Hey, how long
you been awake?

519
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,489
Couldn't sleep.

520
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:47,970
You know, you don't
Iook too good.

521
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:50,639
Maybe you ought
to take some vitamins.

522
00:30:50,704 --> 00:30:53,041
l don't need
a healthy body.

523
00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:56,044
l do it all
with my mind.

524
00:30:56,108 --> 00:30:57,310
Yeah?

525
00:30:57,376 --> 00:31:00,315
l've been ignoring the fact
that l'm falling apart.

526
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:02,249
Say,Joanne...

527
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:03,582
Mm-hmm.

528
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:07,254
Where's the pictures
of yourself you cut out?

529
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:08,586
Hmm?

530
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:11,591
Well, that girl just
doesn't exist anymore.

531
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:15,628
Oh, so Joanne Rodney
doesn't exist anymore.

532
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:18,762
Well
in that case,

533
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:21,900
it kind of
Iooks like you.

534
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,770
Uh, what do you
want for breakfast?

535
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:28,772
l'll have whatever
you're having.

536
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:30,773
Well, l'm having
chocolate pudding.

537
00:31:30,838 --> 00:31:32,775
Uh, wait a minute,
Joanne.

538
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,275
Uh, wait a minute.

539
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:34,341
How about
some bacon and eggs?

540
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:38,449
Don't have any bacon.

541
00:31:38,516 --> 00:31:39,784
How about some eggs?

542
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:40,951
Mmm, nope.

543
00:31:41,017 --> 00:31:42,119
Toast?

544
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:43,287
No butter.

545
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:45,123
Dy toast
or chocolate pudding.

546
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:46,623
l'll have
chocolate pudding, then.

547
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,793
l only have one,

548
00:31:48,857 --> 00:31:51,294
but l'll share it
with you.

549
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,630
Really? It's
a great meal then.

550
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:54,763
Let's go.

551
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:06,374
Come on, feed me.

552
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,748
Well, l'm going
to do it.

553
00:32:13,813 --> 00:32:15,582
Good.
Give me some more.

554
00:32:15,648 --> 00:32:16,583
No, seriously.

555
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:18,251
l'm really
going to do it.

556
00:32:18,317 --> 00:32:19,452
Do what?

557
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,522
Mary Emmett Hunter.

558
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:28,261
Come on, what do you want
to mary Emmett for?

559
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:31,764
He's nothing. It's just
gonna screw up your life.

560
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:35,267
When l told him l wanted
to keep the apartment,

561
00:32:35,331 --> 00:32:36,766
and he said l could.

562
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:39,771
You'll come by
and see me, won't you?

563
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:45,774
lf l can.

564
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:49,278
l got to get through.

565
00:33:18,168 --> 00:33:19,738
Hey, cheer up.

566
00:33:19,803 --> 00:33:22,741
Everybody gets married
now and then.

567
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:25,744
Yeah, but l thought
you'd draw the line

568
00:33:25,808 --> 00:33:27,243
at joining the family.

569
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,513
Yeah. Me, too.

570
00:33:29,578 --> 00:33:31,748
Mm-hmm.

571
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:34,250
But look at it
like this--

572
00:33:34,315 --> 00:33:36,752
With me
in the Hunter family,

573
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:39,756
you won't have to learn
to speak Canadian.

574
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,542
We boring you,
Douglas?

575
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,347
Fall asleep again,
it's $ 1 OO fine.

576
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,017
OK, 3rd and 8.

577
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:17,523
All right!
All right!

578
00:34:17,587 --> 00:34:19,724
The things l do for love.

579
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:22,359
No. You should never
have thrown to Elliott

580
00:34:22,424 --> 00:34:24,093
with that kind
of coverage.

581
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:25,561
Look at Delma there.

582
00:34:25,627 --> 00:34:27,096
He's wide open.

583
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:31,368
l don't like
this buddy-buddy stuff

584
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:32,901
interfering
with my judgment.

585
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:36,105
Shit. You can't win
for losing around here.

586
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,679
[Laughter]

587
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:48,648
Run it back, run it back.

588
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:53,720
[Laughter]

589
00:35:02,258 --> 00:35:05,163
That's it, Stallings.
Real good.

590
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,298
Stallings, what were you
thinking of here?

591
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,903
l'm...l'm
not sure, sir.

592
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:13,302
You're not sure.

593
00:35:13,368 --> 00:35:15,371
No, sir.

594
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:18,175
The entire game riding
on this one series of downs,

595
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,710
and we have a player
who's not sure.

596
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:24,382
There's no room in this
business for uncertainty.

597
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:28,884
No room.

598
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:38,190
Shit. Here it comes.

599
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:39,692
Here's where
you screwed up.

600
00:35:39,758 --> 00:35:41,695
l didn't screw up.
You changed the play.

601
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,195
You changed the play.

602
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:45,198
l didn't
change the play.

603
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:46,531
You brought it in.

604
00:35:46,597 --> 00:35:47,865
l did not.

605
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:50,268
Just cover for me.

606
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,702
l'd like all of you

607
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:53,738
to watch this
next play carefully.

608
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:55,206
Especially you.

609
00:35:55,271 --> 00:35:57,475
Especially you, Elliott.

610
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,150
Great catch.
Great catch.

611
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:10,653
Yeah!
All right!

612
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:14,558
Whoo!
All right!

613
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:21,162
Now, Elliott,

614
00:36:21,227 --> 00:36:23,898
how would you
describe this play?

615
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,837
Well...

616
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:33,305
l'd say we
scored a touchdown.

617
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,577
Oh, you think it's funny!

618
00:36:38,642 --> 00:36:42,181
Well, l fail to see
any humor at all.

619
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:45,684
Maxwell changed the play
that l sent in,

620
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:48,185
Elliott broke his pattern,

621
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,687
and the catch
was a fluke.

622
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:54,191
There's no room for flukes
in winning game plans.

623
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:58,196
Why do you think that
we go over and over

624
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,694
the printouts
of a game plan?

625
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,663
Because deviating
from that plan

626
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,131
can cost us
a championship.

627
00:37:03,196 --> 00:37:05,133
lf there's some of you

628
00:37:05,198 --> 00:37:08,136
who aren't interested
in being champions,

629
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,636
well, then you laugh.

630
00:37:09,703 --> 00:37:11,639
Relax. Have a good time,

631
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:13,140
but you'll do it

632
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:16,644
on somebody else's
football team, not mine.

633
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:19,480
The key to being
a professional

634
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:21,614
is consistency,

635
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,949
and the computer
measures that quality.

636
00:37:24,014 --> 00:37:27,653
No one of you is as good
as that computer.

637
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:29,621
l hope l'm understood.

638
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:35,893
Now, everybody on the bus
in 1 O minutes,

639
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:37,327
except you, Stallings.

640
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:40,766
l'd like a word with you
in private, please.

641
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:01,316
Hey, let me have
those shoes.

642
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:02,816
That's cold, man.

643
00:38:02,882 --> 00:38:03,817
Hey, baby.

644
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,721
Do you believe
they cut Stallings?

645
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,255
Who's Stallings?

646
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,093
Runner's
run-pass-49-right.

647
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,593
Sounds
real important.

648
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,095
Look at it.

649
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,095
On two.

650
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,831
Ready?
Break!

651
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,635
4-3, number 2-zone.

652
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,635
Ready? Break!

653
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:26,804
Stunt left!

654
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,305
Watch
the running back sweep.

655
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:29,739
l got it.

656
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:31,941
Hut! Hut!

657
00:38:32,006 --> 00:38:34,377
Coming in, coming in!

658
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:36,012
Coming in!

659
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:37,011
Whoo!

661
00:38:44,718 --> 00:38:45,753
Douglas!

662
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:47,421
The reason
we drafted you

663
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:49,924
was because they said
you were fast and smart.

664
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,726
At this point
l'd be delighted

665
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,427
if you'd be at
Ieast one of those.

666
00:38:53,492 --> 00:38:54,426
Yes, sir.

667
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:56,930
Carney, get in here
for Douglas!

668
00:38:56,996 --> 00:38:58,798
Back in the huddle!

669
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:02,968
Hey, Douglas.

670
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:04,970
lsn't this
the kind of day

671
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:07,973
you'd rather be by a fire
with a good book?

672
00:39:08,037 --> 00:39:09,472
Fuck you, faggot.

673
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,011
Promises, promises.

674
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:13,476
Set!

675
00:39:15,815 --> 00:39:17,317
Hut!

676
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:30,731
How's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

677
00:39:30,795 --> 00:39:33,733
with a dedicated, young
Christian stud like Hartman?

678
00:39:33,798 --> 00:39:35,600
lt's discouraging.

679
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:37,603
lt's like you told me.

680
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,103
You got to cheat.

681
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,105
l wrote the book
on that, hoss.

682
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,171
l believe it.

683
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:45,775
Elliott!

684

Coming, boss.

686

Red-right-74.

687
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:56,519
You're going to get
yourself a fine,Jo Bob.

688
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,486
lt's worth it.

689
00:39:58,552 --> 00:39:59,520
You got it?

690
00:39:59,586 --> 00:40:00,521
Yes, sir.

691
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:02,724
On three.
Ready? Break!

692
00:40:07,427 --> 00:40:08,361

694
00:40:11,797 --> 00:40:13,500
2-49!

695
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:14,533
Check!

696
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,301
2-76!

697
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:17,803
2-76!

698
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:18,937
Hut!

00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:20,972
Hut!

701
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:25,810
Ow!

702
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:27,445
Ahh! Goddamn it!

703
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,545
Goddamn it!

704
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:29,612
Ahh!

705
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,614
Hold it.

706
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,416
Oh, goddamn it!

707
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:33,917
Pull them out.

708
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:35,418
Don't move,
don't move.

709
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:36,419
Pull it!

710
00:40:36,485 --> 00:40:37,420
Pull!

711
00:40:37,486 --> 00:40:39,255
You all right?

712
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:50,230
Which one?

713
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:52,233
Christ,
which do you think?

714
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:53,601
Elliott!

715
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:56,338
That's what comes
from not concentrating.

716
00:40:56,402 --> 00:40:58,305
Yes, sir.

717
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,306
Amazed at how these
young fellows

718
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:02,575
can take the punishment
of their profession.

719
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,010
Hello, Monsignor.

720
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:05,778
Oh, hello, Phil.

721
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:08,415
You're a very brave
young man.

722
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,784
That's real devotion.

723
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:14,355
You remind me of the
magnificent missionaries

724
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:15,419
of history.

725
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,357
Never thought
of that, Monsignor.

726
00:41:21,057 --> 00:41:23,495
Come on, Elliott,
stop dogging it!

727
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:24,493
That's fine.

728
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,998
Run this here
Chicago pass pattern.

729
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:30,500
Red-right-74.

730
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:32,200
Look at it.

731
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:33,701
Here we go.

732
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:34,936
On 2.
Ready? Break!

733
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:36,939
Come on, snap it up!

734
00:41:37,004 --> 00:41:38,907
Elliott,
get in there!

735
00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:43,611
Brown-left.

736
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:46,914
Set!

737
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,016
Hold it!

738
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:51,285
Carney, get in there!

739
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,721
No!

740
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:55,288
Douglas in, please.

741
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:58,158
Carney, get the hell
out of there!

742
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,060
Let's go.
Here we go.

743
00:42:04,061 --> 00:42:05,163
Set!

744
00:42:08,297 --> 00:42:09,232
Set!

745
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:13,570
2-75!

746
00:42:13,636 --> 00:42:15,138
2-75!

747
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:17,438
Check!

748
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:19,141
2-72!

749
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:21,311
Hartman! Hartman!

750
00:42:21,376 --> 00:42:22,878
Let's just get
the ball snapped!

751
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:25,014
You're giving me
a fucking headache!

752
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,047
Rookies.

753
00:42:26,114 --> 00:42:27,049
High schoolers.

754
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:28,049
Let's go.

755
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:30,052
A bunch
of high schoolers.

756
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:31,052
Set!

757
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,520
Hut!

758
00:42:34,587 --> 00:42:35,588
Hut!

759
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,668
Are you all right, man?

760
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,371
Hey, Phil,
you all right?

761
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,675
You OK?

762
00:43:01,443 --> 00:43:03,013
Yeah, l'm all right.

763
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:05,516
Wait--wait--wait--
wait a minute.

764
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:07,317
Help me up.

765
00:43:09,184 --> 00:43:10,619
There's your hat, man.

766
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:11,620
Nice catch.

767
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:12,621
Yeah.

768
00:43:14,388 --> 00:43:17,226
Now, that's
concentration, Elliott.

769
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:26,799
Feels pretty swollen.

770
00:43:26,866 --> 00:43:29,103
Let's work that knee.

771
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,509
Goddamn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

772
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:38,511
l hit my shoulder
when l hit the floor.

773
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:41,013
lt feels like
it's full of gravel.

774
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:43,015
lt's always felt like
it was full of gravel.

775
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,019
Give me a B-1 2 shot.
That's what l want.

776
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:47,518
Always messing
with my knee.

777
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,018
How you doing, baby?

778
00:43:49,086 --> 00:43:51,523
Fine. You going
to get a shot?

779
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,022
No shots for me, turkey.

780
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,524
l can't stand needles.

781
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:57,026
You got to master
the game's technology.

782
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,528
How do you do that?

783
00:43:58,593 --> 00:44:00,028
Take those pills
and shots, man.

784
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,898
Does terrible things
to your body.

785
00:44:01,963 --> 00:44:03,332
If you last long enough,

786
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:05,467
you'll realize
the only way to survive

787
00:44:05,532 --> 00:44:07,468
is the pills and shots.

788
00:44:07,534 --> 00:44:08,969
Not me, turkey.

789
00:44:09,036 --> 00:44:11,473
l got respect
for my body.

790
00:44:11,537 --> 00:44:12,972
You'll get past that.

791
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:14,776
You're crazy, too.

792
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:16,310
l'd appreciate it

793
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,278
if you could finish up
with butter fingers

794
00:44:18,343 --> 00:44:20,780
and give me my
B-1 2 shot.

795
00:44:20,846 --> 00:44:23,283
l got an important
business meeting.

796
00:44:23,347 --> 00:44:25,284
l found two boys
from Oklahoma

797
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:27,720
that want to invest
in my restaurant business.

798
00:44:27,785 --> 00:44:28,720
Oklahoma?

799
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:29,721
That's right.

800
00:44:29,787 --> 00:44:30,722
That figures.

801
00:44:30,788 --> 00:44:33,726
Once the first one
starts making money,

802
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,226
then you sell franchises.

803
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:37,730
That's where
the big money is.

804
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:40,231
What are you gonna
call the restaurants?

805
00:44:40,297 --> 00:44:42,834
Jo Bob's Fine Foods.

806
00:44:42,898 --> 00:44:44,333
Do you like it?

807
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:45,334
That's right.

808
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,303
Jo Bob's Fine Foods.

809
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:49,371
Eat here
or l'll kill you.

810
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,372
Ha ha ha!

811
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,374
You son of a bitch!

812
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,444
We're not going
to have trouble here!

813
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:56,944
Come on,Jo Bob!

814
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,145
Jo Bob!

815
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:00,582
Go on to your
meeting now.

816
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:02,984
You goddamn bird turd!

817
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,988
Get out or l'll
report you to B.A.

818
00:45:06,052 --> 00:45:06,987
You would?

819
00:45:07,053 --> 00:45:08,522
You bet your ass.

820
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:10,022
You're chicken shit.

821
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:15,395
Get out of my face,
Monroe.

822
00:45:15,459 --> 00:45:18,898
lt always did take
two of you

823
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:20,900
to hold one of me.

824
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:22,233
Excuse me.

825
00:45:23,366 --> 00:45:25,303
Too damn much B-1 2.

826
00:45:49,723 --> 00:45:51,893

Have you ever
Ioved anybody?

You know,
Ioved somebody.

876
00:48:32,101 --> 00:48:34,037
Aw, last night.

00:48:38,106 --> 00:48:39,541
All-time show stopper.

00:48:39,606 --> 00:48:41,810
You know Jery Drake?

881
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:42,810
Drake?

l know that asshole.

884
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:47,815
lt was his YMCA team

885
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,319
that me and Hartman had
to talk to last night.

886
00:48:51,384 --> 00:48:53,821
l gave them my usual
bullshit.

887
00:48:53,885 --> 00:48:56,323
Football, character
development, all that crap.

888
00:48:56,389 --> 00:48:58,826
Hartman comes up
with this story

889
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:01,761
about Jesus being captain
of a football team.

890
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:06,433
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

891
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:07,432
Whoo!

892
00:49:07,498 --> 00:49:09,635
And Judas
was the coach.

893
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,702
Nope,Judas
sold the playbook

894
00:49:11,768 --> 00:49:13,203
to the devil's team.

895
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:15,106
Oh, God.

896
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:18,108
Wait'll you hear
this part.

897
00:49:18,173 --> 00:49:20,110
Drake invites me
and Hartman

898
00:49:20,175 --> 00:49:22,612
to his house
for a drink.

899
00:49:22,677 --> 00:49:24,614
Now,
l got the wheels,

900
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:27,116
so Hartman's stuck
with me, right?

901
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:31,221
Anyway,
here's the point.

902
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:33,722
lt turns out Drake
wants to watch

903
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:36,091
while me and Hartman
do nasty things

904
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:38,059
to his bouncy-bottomed
little wife.

905
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:41,531
Aw,Jesus, Maxwell.
Really.

906
00:49:41,594 --> 00:49:42,529
Hey, l know.

907
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:44,030
lt's not your
type of thing.

908
00:49:44,096 --> 00:49:46,033
But l'm more
of a philosopher.

909
00:49:46,098 --> 00:49:48,635
l like to mingle
with the little people.

910
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,002
What about Hartman?

911
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:51,703
You know Hartman.
Goody two-shoes

912
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:54,040
is fidgeting around
like a one-legged cat

913
00:49:54,105 --> 00:49:57,043
tying to buy shit
on a frozen pond.

914
00:49:57,107 --> 00:49:58,542
Until Seth fixes him

915
00:49:58,608 --> 00:50:00,044
a couple of pink
poontang specials.

916
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:01,545
The crazy tourist drink

917
00:50:01,611 --> 00:50:03,548
that l fix
for stewardesses.

918
00:50:03,613 --> 00:50:05,048
Two shots out of that,

919
00:50:05,114 --> 00:50:06,483
and Hartman
is shot to shit.

920
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:07,484
Freaked out.

921
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:09,553
l never saw a guy
having so much fun

922
00:50:09,618 --> 00:50:11,555
and crying
at the same time.

923
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,257
l don't believe it,
but l'm getting horny.

924
00:50:14,322 --> 00:50:15,257
Aha!

925
00:50:15,323 --> 00:50:17,760
Wait'll you get
to this part.

926
00:50:17,825 --> 00:50:20,563
Drake takes out some
of them fake dicks.

927
00:50:20,628 --> 00:50:22,630
Aw, Max, that's gross.

928
00:50:22,695 --> 00:50:23,830
That's not gross.

929
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:26,268
Gross is when you kiss
your grandpa good night,

930
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:29,004
and he sticks his tongue
down your throat.

931
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,172
Anyway, he's got one

932
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,174
that's about
8 inches long.

933
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,676
lt's pink and it's got
crinkledees in it.

934
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:38,177
lt's got a grinder
that you turn like this.

935
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,179
lt goes in and out--

936
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,216
l don't want to hear
any of this.

937
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:45,418
l'm getting
to the weird part.

938
00:50:45,483 --> 00:50:47,220
The weird part?

939
00:50:47,285 --> 00:50:48,787
Yeah, it gets weird.

940
00:50:48,852 --> 00:50:50,287
OK, who did it?

941
00:50:50,353 --> 00:50:51,755
He did it.

942
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:52,756
ls that right, Seth?

943
00:50:52,822 --> 00:50:53,757
Did what?

944
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,791
The medicine cabinet!

945
00:50:54,857 --> 00:50:57,796
lf B.A. finds out,
it'll be somebody's ass.

946
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,295
Your water's too hot.

947
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:00,296
Calm down.

948
00:51:00,362 --> 00:51:01,731
The man
was desperate.

949
00:51:01,796 --> 00:51:04,233
Think of it
as an emergency.

950
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:06,736
l suppose you stood there
and watched.

951
00:51:06,801 --> 00:51:10,741
No, he held me down
and made me swallow them.

952
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:12,741
This shit
has got to stop.

953
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,512
And leave my goddamn
beer alone!

954
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:21,448
Elliott,
don't you piss in there.

955
00:51:25,384 --> 00:51:26,686
Ahh.

956
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:29,187
Bastard.

957
00:52:40,015 --> 00:52:42,987
Did l call my wife
Iast night?

958
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:45,388
l don't
think so, son.

959
00:52:48,022 --> 00:52:49,959
What do l tell her?

960
00:52:50,024 --> 00:52:51,459
Tell her you escaped,

961
00:52:51,525 --> 00:52:53,462
and you don't have
to pay the ransom.

962
00:52:53,527 --> 00:52:54,962
l can't tell her that.

963
00:52:55,028 --> 00:52:56,463
Ha ha ha!

964
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,968
Dream up the wildest
thing you can think of,

965
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:01,902
and lay it on her.

966
00:53:01,967 --> 00:53:04,706
She'll go for it,
coming from you.

967
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:05,704
Yeah?

968
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:06,705
l'm right.

969
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:10,110
Why do l smell
like strawberries?

970
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,417
What'd you do
Iast night, Poot?

971
00:53:23,753 --> 00:53:25,523
Grrr!

972
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:27,525
Come on,
what'd you do?

973
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,627
Well, l'll tell you.

974
00:53:29,692 --> 00:53:32,096
l had a date
with Charlotte.

975
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,262
Oh, shit.

976
00:53:33,328 --> 00:53:35,632
l hope you're not
getting hooked

977
00:53:35,697 --> 00:53:36,765
on that chick.

978
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,266
Breaks
your concentration.

979
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:39,768
l'll tell you something.

980
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:44,141
The only thing l haven't
broken is my concentration.

981
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:46,942
Why do we do it,
partner?

982
00:53:47,006 --> 00:53:50,445
Well, the only way
to find that out, man,

983
00:53:50,509 --> 00:53:52,479
is to quit.

984
00:53:52,545 --> 00:53:54,649
You're not thinking
about quitting.

985
00:53:54,714 --> 00:53:58,988
l'm thinking l'm tired
of beating myself up.

986
00:54:00,218 --> 00:54:01,253
Don't worry.

987
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:03,321
You'll get tired
of thinking.

988
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:14,165
Coca-Cola, Poot.

989
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:16,900
Throw me an RC,
Seth.

990
00:54:28,342 --> 00:54:29,510

Huh?

1001
00:55:00,374 --> 00:55:03,780
Remember when
l busted my elbow?

1002
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:04,778
Oh, yeah.

1003

it happened, man.

all over the field

1007

in front
of all those people,

1008
00:55:18,022 --> 00:55:19,959

what l felt?

1009
00:55:20,024 --> 00:55:20,959
Ohh.

Yeah. l mean,

1012
00:55:26,363 --> 00:55:29,802
it made me feel
like l was doing

1013
00:55:29,865 --> 00:55:31,301
something important,
you know?

1014

Yeah.

1015

appropriately dressed.

1047
00:59:41,655 --> 00:59:45,094
Now, before we break
into our separate groups,

1048
00:59:45,157 --> 00:59:47,194
there are a few
general comments

1049
00:59:47,259 --> 00:59:50,030
which l am obliged
to make, gentlemen.

1050
00:59:50,095 --> 00:59:52,532
We won a game Sunday

1051
00:59:52,598 --> 00:59:55,369
against an opponent,
measurably and on paper,

1052
00:59:55,433 --> 00:59:57,537
inferior to ours.

1053
00:59:57,602 --> 00:59:59,037
ln doing so,

1054
00:59:59,102 --> 01:00:02,041
we managed to play
far below our potential.

1055
01:00:02,105 --> 01:00:06,045
Our punting team gave them
4.5 yards per kick--

1056
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:07,878
More than
our reasonable goal

1057
01:00:07,944 --> 01:00:11,050
and 9.9 yards more
than outstanding.

1058
01:00:11,113 --> 01:00:13,550
That's not the kind
of football

1059
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:15,553
conference champions play.

1060
01:00:15,618 --> 01:00:19,558
Offense--four turnovers.

1061
01:00:19,621 --> 01:00:22,393
Five scoring
opportunities blown.

1062
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:26,563
3rd down conversions
we failed six times more

1063
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:28,564
than our seasonal average.

1064
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:31,066
Pass completions were 490x.

1065
01:00:32,465 --> 01:00:35,571
That's 6.30x less
than reasonable

1066
01:00:35,635 --> 01:00:40,577
and it's 1 90x less
than our outstanding.

1067
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,414
That is a negative 1 90x
against Seattle!

1068
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:51,016
Now, clearly,
it's time for us

1069
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:53,854
to take a long,
hard look at ourselves,

1070
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:55,353
and in this connection,

1071
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,855
Coach Johnson has
prepared some material

1072

beneficial to you.

Now, listen, you guys.

1076
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:11,168
If we can take
an extra moment here,

1077
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:12,167
l'd like to read something

1078

is pretty important.

college ball at Maryland,

1080

taped to a locker.

1081

what it means.

Means he's out
of his fucking mind.

1083
01:01:28,914 --> 01:01:32,687

between good and great

1084
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:34,521
is that much.

1085
01:01:34,586 --> 01:01:37,357
That's the same size
as his pecker.

01:04:39,946 --> 01:04:41,983
Let's break up
into your groups.

1152
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:43,484
l wasn't really counting,

1153
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,152
l was just moving
my lips.

1154
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:47,088
You son of a bitch!

1155
01:04:51,422 --> 01:04:53,259
Let's see if you
can catch one.

1156
01:04:53,325 --> 01:04:54,827
Look at Phil.

1157
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:00,666
About time
you caught one.

1158
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,066
How are you?

1159
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:04,069
Hey, Emmett,
how are you?

1160
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:05,570
Thanks for
inviting me.

1161
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:06,570
Yeah.

1162
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,238
Sorry to hear
about your daddy.

1163
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:09,440
Thank you.

1164
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,611
That's the only fight
he ever lost.

1165
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,612
When a man
of your daddy's wealth

1166
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,112
dies of cancer,

1167
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,849
you know they haven't
found a cure.

1168
01:05:18,913 --> 01:05:20,483
Let's go!

1169
01:05:22,116 --> 01:05:23,853
Come on.
Come on, Delma.

1170
01:05:27,721 --> 01:05:29,691
Coach: l'll tell you
if you got hurt.

1171
01:05:29,756 --> 01:05:32,360
Easy, easy.
What is it?

1172
01:05:32,425 --> 01:05:34,127
lt's my hamstring.

1173
01:05:34,193 --> 01:05:36,130
Did you feel it tear?

1174
01:05:36,195 --> 01:05:38,132
No. l heard it pop.

1175
01:05:38,197 --> 01:05:39,632
Take him inside.

1176
01:05:39,698 --> 01:05:41,368
Give me a hand.

1177
01:05:41,433 --> 01:05:44,137
Coach: l seen better
hands on a clock.

1178
01:05:44,202 --> 01:05:45,905
Oh, shit.

1179
01:05:45,971 --> 01:05:48,175
Back to the tub
again, huh, Delma?

1180
01:05:52,412 --> 01:05:54,115
Let's go
to team drill--

1181
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:55,349
Chicago defense.

1182
01:05:55,415 --> 01:05:58,386
Elliott, get back
with the first unit.

1183
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,719
If you moved slower,

1184
01:05:59,786 --> 01:06:01,054
you'd be going
backwards.

1185
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:04,494
Very funny, Elliott.
Very funny.

1186
01:06:04,556 --> 01:06:07,494
One more game and we
take our division.

1187
01:06:07,558 --> 01:06:09,995
That's what makes it
all worthwhile.

1188
01:06:10,062 --> 01:06:11,631
Christ, Con.
You make more

1189
01:06:11,696 --> 01:06:14,000
in your manufacturing
division in one week

1190
01:06:14,065 --> 01:06:16,736
than this damned football
team makes in one year,

1191
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,236
even if they do win.

1192
01:06:18,303 --> 01:06:19,237
That's true,

1193
01:06:19,304 --> 01:06:21,540
but my manufacturing
division never got

1194
01:06:21,605 --> 01:06:23,774
the cover
of Time magazine.

1195
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:26,109
l'm going all
the way this year.

1196
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,611
The big one.
The Super Bowl.

1197
01:06:27,677 --> 01:06:29,613
No question
about it.

1198
01:06:29,678 --> 01:06:32,083
The money isn't
evey thing.

1199
01:06:32,148 --> 01:06:34,852
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

1200
01:06:37,852 --> 01:06:39,254
lt's either pulled
or torn.

1201
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:40,756
We'll know more
tomorrow.

1202
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:43,458
Can you get him
ready for Monday?

1203
01:06:46,226 --> 01:06:47,094
Set!

1204
01:06:48,795 --> 01:06:50,364
Hut!

1205
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:52,066
Next play. Next play.

1206
01:06:52,131 --> 01:06:54,068
Break it up.
Come on.

1207
01:06:54,133 --> 01:06:55,134
Shit!

1208
01:06:57,302 --> 01:06:59,606
Give Jo Bob
some work in there.

1209
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:07,512
3-22.

1210
01:07:07,577 --> 01:07:10,048
3-22.

1211
01:07:10,114 --> 01:07:11,616
Hut! Hut!

1212
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:15,552
[Whistle Blows]

1213
01:07:15,617 --> 01:07:17,053
You son of a bitch.

1214
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,091
Jo Bob, is that how
you're going to hit

1215
01:07:20,155 --> 01:07:21,190
in Chicago.

1216
01:07:21,256 --> 01:07:22,691
Goddamn it,Coach!

1217
01:07:22,757 --> 01:07:24,594
We're supposed to be
doing this half speed.

1218
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:27,096
l don't want excuses,
just results.

1219
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:29,732
If you ain't ready,
Weeks will tear off your head

1220
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,099
and crap in your neck.

1221
01:07:31,165 --> 01:07:32,267
All right.
Same play, let's go.

1222
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,406
3-22.

1223
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,710
Asshole.

1224
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:43,209
3-22.

1225
01:07:44,509 --> 01:07:45,444
Hut!

1226
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:50,350
Jo Bob, get your head
out of your ass.

1227
01:07:50,415 --> 01:07:52,051
Son of a bitch!

1228
01:07:52,117 --> 01:07:53,719
Bring it up
to full speed.

1229
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:56,255
All your teammates would love
a live scrimmage.

1230
01:07:56,321 --> 01:07:59,059
Let's do it again,
and do it right.

1231
01:07:59,123 --> 01:08:01,727
Get your fucking ass
back on the line.

1232
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,061
Fuck you, asshole.

1233
01:08:05,228 --> 01:08:06,163
Huddle up.

1234
01:08:08,764 --> 01:08:10,066
You cocksucker.

1235
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:12,402
Your mama was
the best teacher.

1236
01:08:17,671 --> 01:08:19,106
They're
fired up now.

1237
01:08:19,173 --> 01:08:22,345
Oh, yeah. They're
going to ream Chicago.

1238
01:09:03,078 --> 01:09:04,013
That's enough.

1239
01:09:06,181 --> 01:09:07,917
OK. Break it up.

1240
01:09:07,982 --> 01:09:09,417
Break it up.

1241
01:09:09,484 --> 01:09:12,121
Break it up.

1242
01:09:12,186 --> 01:09:13,121
OK, OK.

1243
01:09:13,187 --> 01:09:15,324
All right, gentlemen.
All right.

1244
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:17,559
Everyone at the airport
at 1 O:OO A.M. tomorrow.

1245
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:25,466
Elliott, l'd like
to see you, please.

1246
01:09:34,472 --> 01:09:36,242
Walk with me, Phil.

1247
01:09:38,476 --> 01:09:39,911
How's the knee?

1248
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,411
Great. Feels
real good.

1249
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:42,413
You're limping.

1250
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,418
That's just habit,
but, uh, feels good.

1251
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:51,256
Phil, l'm going to
need you in Chicago.

1252
01:09:53,821 --> 01:09:55,758
Delma's pulled
his hamstring again,

1253
01:09:55,823 --> 01:09:57,091
and you know Delma.

1254
01:09:57,158 --> 01:09:59,695
He can't stand pain.

1255
01:09:59,759 --> 01:10:02,364
He'll say
it hurts too much,

1256
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:04,299
but he doesn't like
to use the needles.

1257
01:10:06,665 --> 01:10:07,800
So...

1258
01:10:10,169 --> 01:10:13,608
can l count on you,
Phil, and your knee

1259
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:15,241
for the entire game?

1260
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:28,788
B.A., you can always
count on me

1261
01:10:28,852 --> 01:10:31,790
to do whatever
it takes to play.

1262
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:34,959
Hell, l love needles.

1263
01:10:41,564 --> 01:10:43,968
l guess that's what
we call maturity.

1264
01:10:46,434 --> 01:10:47,502
Huh?

1265
01:10:50,137 --> 01:10:51,072
Yeow!

1266
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,202
lt's beautiful.

1267
01:11:25,267 --> 01:11:27,104
Yeah, really...

1268
01:11:27,169 --> 01:11:28,638
really beautiful.

1269
01:11:30,673 --> 01:11:33,612
Come on. Let's
go into the house.

1270
01:11:33,676 --> 01:11:34,610
OK.

1271
01:11:34,677 --> 01:11:36,112
lnto the living room.

1272
01:11:36,177 --> 01:11:37,612
Ah, through the wall.

1273
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,114
Yeah.

1274
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:40,615
All right.

1275
01:11:40,682 --> 01:11:41,950
Now...

1276
01:11:43,183 --> 01:11:44,618
uh...um...

1277
01:11:44,685 --> 01:11:48,559
uh, this is
as far as l've got.

1278
01:11:48,622 --> 01:11:52,495
How long did it take you
to get this far?

1279
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,630
Oh, about uh...

1280
01:11:57,862 --> 01:11:59,231
three years.

1281
01:12:03,635 --> 01:12:05,571
Anyway, l got 20 acres,

1282
01:12:05,636 --> 01:12:07,573
and it runs
along that gully,

1283
01:12:07,638 --> 01:12:10,577
and it goes
back in that valley.

1284
01:12:10,641 --> 01:12:12,076
Oh, God,
it's magnificent.

1285
01:12:12,141 --> 01:12:15,080
Yeah. That's where l'm
going to have the horses.

1286
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:18,082
l think you should
finish it though.

1287
01:12:18,146 --> 01:12:20,583
l am going to finish it.

1288
01:12:46,372 --> 01:12:47,540
Ta-da!

1289
01:12:47,606 --> 01:12:49,575
Made with
my own fair hands.

1290
01:12:49,641 --> 01:12:49,641
Oh, great.

1291
01:12:52,481 --> 01:12:53,749
l'll get the wine.

1292
01:12:53,814 --> 01:12:55,249
Get the salad.

1293
01:12:55,316 --> 01:12:56,752
OK. Excuse me.

1294
01:12:56,817 --> 01:12:58,252
Well, excuse me.

1295
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:00,256
l need all the room here.

1296
01:13:00,321 --> 01:13:02,257
You've got
all the room.

1297
01:13:02,322 --> 01:13:04,760
What are we going
to do about napkins?

1298
01:13:04,824 --> 01:13:06,259
Use the toilet paper.

1299
01:13:06,326 --> 01:13:07,261
Oh, Chic.

1300
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,595
Chic.

1301
01:13:11,029 --> 01:13:12,431
Listen, uh...

1302
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:16,970
do you think
this raising horses

1303
01:13:17,034 --> 01:13:19,471
is just a dream of mine?

1304
01:13:19,537 --> 01:13:20,973
l don't know. Maybe.

1305
01:13:21,038 --> 01:13:22,974
lt doesn't
seem very real.

1306
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:23,974
Yeah?

1307
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,743
Come on.

1308
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:30,649
Hey!
You like burned steak?

1309
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:41,758
Hey,
you know something?

1310
01:13:44,058 --> 01:13:46,495
When l'm with you,
my mind's

1311
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:48,932
a million miles
away from football.

1312
01:13:48,996 --> 01:13:50,933
l feel free.

1313
01:13:50,998 --> 01:13:52,934
Sounds like you're
tired of football.

1314
01:13:52,999 --> 01:13:55,436
Well, if l was,
l wouldn't admit it.

1315
01:13:55,501 --> 01:13:57,939
That would scare
the hell out of me.

1316
01:13:58,004 --> 01:13:59,940
Here, you
want some wi ne?

1317
01:14:00,005 --> 01:14:01,107
Yeah.

1318
01:14:04,009 --> 01:14:06,947
l'm scared to death
most of the time anyhow.

1319
01:14:07,011 --> 01:14:08,447
Scared of what?

1320
01:14:08,513 --> 01:14:10,449
Of injury,
of playing badly,

1321
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:13,453
anything that can knock
me out of the game.

1322
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:14,952
You don't act like it.

1323
01:14:15,018 --> 01:14:16,721
Yeah. l don't dare.

1324
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:21,960
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

1325
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,460
Then what?

1326
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:25,462
Oh, come on, Charlotte,
that's serious.

1327
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:28,466
l don't want
to get into that.

1328
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,965
For Christ's sake!

1329
01:14:30,031 --> 01:14:31,467
Let's don't
talk about football.

1330
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:33,469
l'm starting Monday.

1331
01:14:33,534 --> 01:14:36,139
Everything in my life's
just great.

1332
01:14:36,203 --> 01:14:37,972
We got any butter?

1333
01:14:38,038 --> 01:14:40,475
Well, l don't think
it's great.

1334
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:43,479
You know, l saw you
the other night.

1335
01:14:43,543 --> 01:14:46,916
You were in so much pain
you couldn't sleep.

1336
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:49,416
Your body's
twisted and scarred.

1337
01:14:49,481 --> 01:14:50,916
You're
drugging yourself.

1338
01:14:50,983 --> 01:14:53,921
Hey, listen, that's just part
of the game, Charlotte.

1339
01:14:53,985 --> 01:14:54,986
Game?

1340
01:14:55,053 --> 01:14:57,490
You call men smashing
each other a game?

1341
01:14:57,555 --> 01:14:59,158
For Christ's sake!

1342
01:14:59,223 --> 01:15:00,658
You can't judge!

1343
01:15:00,725 --> 01:15:03,162
You live in a little house
secure with your Texas money,

1344
01:15:03,226 --> 01:15:05,229
what the hell
do you know about it?

1345
01:15:05,295 --> 01:15:06,597
You live
in an unreal world!

1346
01:15:06,663 --> 01:15:07,831
lf football's
the real world,

1347
01:15:07,897 --> 01:15:09,232
l don't want
any part of it!

1348
01:15:09,298 --> 01:15:10,734
lt scares me.

1349
01:15:10,801 --> 01:15:13,238
Well, good.
It's not your life.

1350
01:15:13,302 --> 01:15:14,404
lt's mine.

1351
01:15:16,972 --> 01:15:18,607
Come on, let's eat.

1352
01:15:24,044 --> 01:15:25,981
Why don't you
build your ranch

1353
01:15:26,046 --> 01:15:27,481
instead of
dreaming about it?

1354
01:15:27,548 --> 01:15:29,985
Maybe l like it better
as a fantasy.

1355
01:15:30,049 --> 01:15:31,485
The payments are lower.

1356
01:15:31,552 --> 01:15:34,991
And you accuse me
of living in a dream world.

1357
01:15:35,054 --> 01:15:38,493
Look, l got to keep
my mind in the game.

1358
01:15:38,558 --> 01:15:40,995
l don't want
to get confused now,

1359
01:15:41,059 --> 01:15:42,494
so drop it!

1360
01:16:03,012 --> 01:16:05,950
Why don't you
watch the game?

1361
01:16:06,014 --> 01:16:08,184
l'll do something
special for you

1362
01:16:08,249 --> 01:16:09,517
in Chicago.

1363
01:16:15,022 --> 01:16:17,961
Hey, Eddie, give me
a match, will you?

1364
01:16:18,025 --> 01:16:19,460
Hey, Phil,
what's happening?

1365
01:16:19,526 --> 01:16:21,463
What are you doing
here early, man?

1366
01:16:21,528 --> 01:16:22,963
l got butter_ies.

1367
01:16:23,029 --> 01:16:25,466
l couldn't sit
around the hotel.

1368
01:16:25,531 --> 01:16:28,470
Where in the hell
is Jo Bob and O.W.?

1369
01:16:28,534 --> 01:16:30,971
They were in a cab
right behind me.

1370
01:16:31,036 --> 01:16:32,471
l told you boys

1371
01:16:32,537 --> 01:16:34,474
when you got special
taping to do,

1372
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:35,974
get to the stadium early.

1373
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,043
Maybe l ought to
start getting here

1374
01:16:38,108 --> 01:16:39,978
the night before.

1375
01:16:40,044 --> 01:16:42,481
Come on, Frank!
What are you doing?

1376
01:16:42,546 --> 01:16:44,483
We got an important
ball game.

1377
01:16:44,548 --> 01:16:46,484
You tape
my left ankle first.

1378
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:48,921
You tying to
put the hex on me?

1379
01:16:48,985 --> 01:16:50,420
You old fart.

1380
01:16:50,486 --> 01:16:53,390
l'll tape that knee
after the doctor checks it.

1381
01:16:56,491 --> 01:16:58,428
You don't look
healthy at all.

1382
01:16:58,493 --> 01:17:00,062
Yeah. l hurt myself.

1383
01:17:02,396 --> 01:17:03,832
l'll catch you later.

1384
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:05,334
Have a good ball game.

1385
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:06,334
Yeah. You, too.

1386
01:17:28,886 --> 01:17:30,422
Oh, yeah.

1387
01:17:55,844 --> 01:17:57,780
Jo Bob,
this is it, babe.

1388
01:17:57,845 --> 01:17:59,782
This is what
we want.

1389
01:17:59,847 --> 01:18:01,784
What are we
going to do?

1390
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:03,785
We're going
to kick their butts.

1391
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,288
We know how
to kick their butts.

1392
01:18:06,352 --> 01:18:09,290
We'll do it very roughly,
with no respect.

1393
01:18:09,354 --> 01:18:10,789
We're going
to do it.

1394
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:12,292
We're going
to get them!

1395
01:18:12,357 --> 01:18:14,294
We're going
to get them!

1396
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:15,661
Yes.

1397
01:18:15,727 --> 01:18:17,529
l mean Weeks now.

1398
01:18:17,595 --> 01:18:19,031
Where's my locker?

1399
01:18:19,096 --> 01:18:21,032
Get your jock on, babe.

1400
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,634
Phil, what is it?

1401
01:18:24,702 --> 01:18:25,803
The knee.

1402
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:27,305
The knee, huh?
Let's have a look.

1403
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,608
Tell me when.

1404
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,477
oh!

1405
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,413
Ah ah ah ah.

1406
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,548
X marks the spot.

1407
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:41,552
Hey, baby, you going
to make it tonight?

1408
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:43,051
l don't think so.

1409
01:18:43,116 --> 01:18:44,552
We need you, man.

1410
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:47,557
Yeah. Frank, can l
get this hot packed?

1411
01:18:47,621 --> 01:18:49,191
You got it, babe.

1412
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,327
Hey, is this it?
Here?

1413
01:18:53,392 --> 01:18:54,828
Yeah, that's it.

1414
01:18:54,895 --> 01:18:55,997
Hold on.

1415
01:18:57,696 --> 01:18:59,633
Come on, Delma,
lift it up.

1416
01:19:00,766 --> 01:19:06,543
No? Tell him.

1417
01:19:06,604 --> 01:19:07,806
OK.

1418
01:19:13,377 --> 01:19:16,381
OK, here we go.

1419
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:22,787
Ooh,Jesus.

1420
01:19:25,287 --> 01:19:26,589
No, wait a second.

1421
01:19:27,923 --> 01:19:30,127
Just wait a second.

1422
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:32,560
Say when.

1423
01:19:32,626 --> 01:19:34,663
All right. Not yet.

1424
01:19:36,297 --> 01:19:39,135
Goddamn it!
Jesus, it burns.

1425
01:19:41,634 --> 01:19:43,938
Goddamn!

1426
01:19:44,003 --> 01:19:46,875
Christ, how often
do you put this shit

1427
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,375
in the coaches' hearts?

1428
01:19:49,474 --> 01:19:50,576
There.

1429
01:19:50,642 --> 01:19:51,777
Whew.

1430
01:19:53,578 --> 01:19:57,118
Now that wasn't
bad, was it?

1431
01:19:57,181 --> 01:19:59,117
Oh, no.
l loved it.

1432
01:20:00,985 --> 01:20:02,654
There.
Now ty it.

1433
01:20:05,722 --> 01:20:07,157
How does
it feel?

1434
01:20:08,257 --> 01:20:09,459
lt's numb.

1435
01:20:09,525 --> 01:20:10,693
Good, good.

1436
01:20:10,759 --> 01:20:13,196
lt's a brand-new
knee, Doc.

1437
01:20:13,262 --> 01:20:15,531
Better football
through chemistry, huh?

1438
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:25,746
Hey, Delma,
using the heat, huh?

1439
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:27,747
You must
be feeling better.

1440
01:20:27,812 --> 01:20:30,249
No, Coach,
it feels real bad.

1441
01:20:30,314 --> 01:20:33,253
l don't think
l can make it.

1442
01:20:33,317 --> 01:20:34,786
Come on,
you saw Elliott.

1443
01:20:34,852 --> 01:20:36,187
He was hurting, too,

1444
01:20:36,252 --> 01:20:40,193
but he has the guts to do
what it takes when we need him.

1445
01:20:40,256 --> 01:20:41,691
lf l shoot up

1446
01:20:41,757 --> 01:20:43,694
l could hurt myself
real bad.

1447
01:20:43,759 --> 01:20:44,861
l don't mess
with needles.

1448
01:20:44,927 --> 01:20:46,195
You don't feel
anything.

1449
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:48,632
l could tear my
hamstring to bits.

1450
01:20:48,697 --> 01:20:51,636
lsn't it time you thought
about the team?

1451
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,135
Now you listen, Delma.

1452
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,836
You can't make it
in this league

1453
01:20:54,903 --> 01:20:56,272
if you don't know
the difference

1454
01:20:56,337 --> 01:20:57,272
between pain and injury.

1455
01:20:59,773 --> 01:21:00,941
Hey...

1456
01:21:02,809 --> 01:21:04,746
l'm just tying to help.

1457
01:21:13,385 --> 01:21:14,487
Fuck it.

1458
01:21:14,653 --> 01:21:15,988
Come on, you guys.

1459
01:21:16,054 --> 01:21:18,992
Stop playing grab ass
and get ready.

1460
01:21:28,431 --> 01:21:30,367
l want to hit somebody!

1461
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:31,868
Use some of that.

1462
01:21:31,935 --> 01:21:33,937
Hit somebody!

1463
01:21:34,003 --> 01:21:35,639
l want to hit...

1464
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:36,806
hit...

1465
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:38,074
hit...

1466
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,077
Give me some,
too, man.

1467
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:44,113
That's good.

1468
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,817
When Weeks starts
Iooping over the middle,

1469
01:21:48,882 --> 01:21:49,883
what are you gonna do?

1470
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:51,185
l'll stay at home.

1471
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:52,686
OK, no problem
there.

1472
01:21:52,753 --> 01:21:53,855
That's right.

1473
01:21:56,089 --> 01:21:58,025
You know who that is?

1474
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:01,928
That's Alcie Weeks, baby.

1475
01:22:01,994 --> 01:22:02,928
He's ugly.

1476
01:22:02,995 --> 01:22:04,297
He's the ugliest man
l ever seen,

1477
01:22:04,362 --> 01:22:05,831
and l don't want
none of his ugly

1478
01:22:05,897 --> 01:22:07,767
rubbing off
on my pretty face.

1479
01:22:07,832 --> 01:22:08,934
All right.

1480
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,938
Knock his cock in
his watch pocket,Jo Bob.

1481
01:22:12,002 --> 01:22:13,104
All right.

1482
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,973
l want him walking
on his elbows

1483
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:16,107
in the morning,Jo Bob.

1484
01:22:16,173 --> 01:22:17,275
He will.

1485
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,278
What you going
to do to him,Jo Bob?

1486
01:22:32,853 --> 01:22:35,792
He'll be eating him up
all night long.

1487
01:22:35,856 --> 01:22:36,958
My man.

1488
01:22:37,024 --> 01:22:40,497
You'll be eating
his ass up.

1489
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,497
Just like white
on rice,

1490
01:22:42,562 --> 01:22:45,500
you'll be sticking
to him,Jo Bob.

1491
01:22:45,564 --> 01:22:47,434
l'm going to get him.

1492
01:22:47,499 --> 01:22:49,436
We're going
to do it.

1493
01:22:49,501 --> 01:22:50,703
All night long,
Jo Bob.

1494
01:22:50,769 --> 01:22:51,837
They say
he's the best.

1495
01:22:51,904 --> 01:22:52,939
He ain't the best.

1496
01:22:53,005 --> 01:22:54,107
He's nothing.

1497
01:22:54,173 --> 01:22:55,275
He's nothing.

1498
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,277
You can be the best.

1499
01:22:57,342 --> 01:22:58,777
You are the best.

1500
01:22:58,843 --> 01:23:00,278
lt's time
to get down.

1501
01:23:00,344 --> 01:23:01,779
Let's pad up, man.

1502
01:23:01,845 --> 01:23:02,947
Get down.

1503
01:23:03,013 --> 01:23:04,449
Let's get ready now.

1504
01:23:04,514 --> 01:23:05,616
All right.

1505
01:23:05,682 --> 01:23:07,051
You ready?
Let's pad up.

1506
01:23:07,117 --> 01:23:08,552
Where's my locker?

1507
01:23:08,618 --> 01:23:09,953
Right behind you.

1508
01:23:16,292 --> 01:23:17,227
Hey, Hartman,

1509
01:23:17,293 --> 01:23:18,428
while you're at it,

1510
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,599
why don't you ask the man
about the point spread?

1511
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:22,731
Pussy.

1512
01:23:31,205 --> 01:23:32,440
Well, all right.

1513
01:23:32,505 --> 01:23:35,243
No wonder they call it
The Windy City.

1514
01:23:35,308 --> 01:23:36,744
Hey, baby. Cook.

1515
01:23:36,809 --> 01:23:39,246
Save some for the party.

1516
01:23:39,312 --> 01:23:41,883
You've got a face
like a baby's butt.

1517
01:23:41,947 --> 01:23:42,882
Thank you, Seth.

1518
01:23:42,948 --> 01:23:43,916
Beautiful.

1519
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:48,888
OK. Wait a minute.

1520
01:23:48,953 --> 01:23:51,390
l'm going to get
the bastard for this.

1521
01:23:51,454 --> 01:23:52,389
All right.

1522
01:23:52,455 --> 01:23:53,891
Mother clotheslined
me last time.

1523
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:56,195
l'm going
to tear his ass up.

1524
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:57,562
l lost 4 fucking teeth.

1525
01:23:57,627 --> 01:23:59,129
l'm going
to tear his ass up.

1526
01:24:08,037 --> 01:24:09,406
1 O minutes!

1527
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:10,805
1 O minutes!

1528
01:24:29,055 --> 01:24:30,424
You ready, baby?

1529
01:24:30,488 --> 01:24:31,756
Alan,
l can't fumble.

1530
01:24:31,823 --> 01:24:34,060
You saw what they
did to Stallings.

1531
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:36,529
Hey.
You'll be all right.

1532
01:24:36,593 --> 01:24:37,594
OK?

1533
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:40,931
Give me a hit.

1534
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,935
Ready?

1535
01:24:46,236 --> 01:24:47,438
Yeah.

1536
01:24:49,939 --> 01:24:50,974
Thank you.

1537
01:24:54,443 --> 01:24:55,645
Can't fumble.

1538
01:24:57,446 --> 01:24:59,081
Can't fumble
the football.

1539
01:25:08,956 --> 01:25:09,890
All right.

1540
01:25:09,956 --> 01:25:11,392
Have
a good game.

1541
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:12,392
All right.

1542
01:25:12,459 --> 01:25:15,397
Let's go,Jo Bob.
Let's get them.

1543
01:25:43,886 --> 01:25:45,188
How's that,
Mark?

1544
01:25:45,254 --> 01:25:46,422
Little
more air, Keith.

1545
01:25:46,488 --> 01:25:49,159
Why don't you pump up his ass
and blow his brains out?

1546
01:25:49,224 --> 01:25:50,225
Up yours, asshole.

1547
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:51,493
Fuck you.

1548
01:25:51,558 --> 01:25:52,861
five minutes!

1549
01:25:52,927 --> 01:25:54,362
How long, Coach?

1550
01:25:54,429 --> 01:25:56,366
Five--fuck you!

1551
01:25:59,938 --> 01:26:01,373
All right, settle down.

1552
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:02,941
Listen up.

1553
01:26:03,006 --> 01:26:04,743
Out with the cigarettes.

1554
01:26:04,808 --> 01:26:05,776
Coach.

1555
01:26:07,444 --> 01:26:09,414
Just one reminder,
gentlemen.

1556
01:26:09,478 --> 01:26:11,882
Please remember
to take off your helmets

1557
01:26:11,948 --> 01:26:13,885
when they play
the national anthem.

1558
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:16,154
Also remember you're
on national TV,

1559
01:26:16,219 --> 01:26:18,423
so don't pick your noses
or scratch your nuts.

1560
01:26:20,322 --> 01:26:22,025
Excuse me,
Coach Johnson.

1561
01:26:25,659 --> 01:26:28,463
Mr. Hunter would like to say
a few words to you now.

1562
01:26:28,528 --> 01:26:31,000
Thank you, B.A.

1563
01:26:31,065 --> 01:26:32,167
Men...

1564
01:26:32,233 --> 01:26:34,670
l want you
to win this game

1565
01:26:34,734 --> 01:26:36,670
for our fans,
for Dallas,

1566
01:26:36,736 --> 01:26:39,173
for me and
my little brother.

1567
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,875
Not necessarily
in that order.

1568
01:26:44,343 --> 01:26:46,180
If we win
this game,

1569
01:26:46,245 --> 01:26:48,147
you're all invited
to spend a weekend

1570
01:26:48,212 --> 01:26:49,615
with your wives
and families

1571
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,117
at my private island
in the Caribbean.

1572
01:26:54,017 --> 01:26:56,020
Bullshit.

1573
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:57,021
And remember,

1574
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:59,758
the eyes of Texas
are on you.

1575
01:26:59,822 --> 01:27:02,761
[Whistling]

1576
01:27:05,593 --> 01:27:06,896
Knock that
shit off.

1577
01:27:09,365 --> 01:27:10,567
Monsignor.

1578
01:27:15,636 --> 01:27:16,571
Dear Lord,

1579
01:27:16,637 --> 01:27:19,141
l ask your blessing
on these brave boys

1580
01:27:19,206 --> 01:27:21,076
as they venture
out to battle.

1581
01:27:21,141 --> 01:27:22,476
Take off your
fucking hats.

1582
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:24,644
Sorry, Monsignor.

1583
01:27:26,345 --> 01:27:29,150
We ask not for victory,

1584
01:27:29,215 --> 01:27:30,984
not for glory,

1585
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:32,752
not for fame.

1586
01:27:32,817 --> 01:27:35,656
We ask only
for the preservation

1587
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,155
of our bodies

1588
01:27:37,222 --> 01:27:40,093
and of our minds.

1589
01:27:40,157 --> 01:27:43,663
Bless also
the entire Hunter family

1590
01:27:43,727 --> 01:27:46,598
who have so
unselfishly given us

1591
01:27:46,663 --> 01:27:49,134
evey thing
we need for victory,

1592
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:50,633
except our efforts

1593
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:53,604
in the spirit
of sportsmanship,

1594
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:55,104
with Thy guidance,

1595
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:57,708
Thy kingdom,
power, and glory

1596
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,809
for evermore.

1597
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:01,043
Amen.

1598
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,109
- Amen.
- Amen

1599
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:03,646
let's go kill
those cocksuckers!

1600
01:28:23,594 --> 01:28:24,562
Elliott?

1601
01:28:24,629 --> 01:28:25,564
Yeah?

1602
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:27,232
l'm starting Delma,
but you stay up.

1603
01:28:27,298 --> 01:28:29,101
Be ready when l need you.

1604
01:28:37,707 --> 01:28:39,142
He said he's
starting Delma.

1605
01:28:39,209 --> 01:28:40,143
l heard.

1606
01:28:40,209 --> 01:28:41,244
But l thought--

1607
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:44,249
l can't worry
about that now.

1608
01:28:44,313 --> 01:28:45,815
You
just be ready.

1609
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:09,669
Sportscaster: With less
than two minutes left

1610
01:29:09,735 --> 01:29:11,672
this might be it
for North Dallas.

1611
01:29:11,737 --> 01:29:13,072
Chicago
Ieading 1 4-7.

1612
01:29:13,138 --> 01:29:15,475
North Dallas is
on the Chicago 25.

1613
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:16,642
1 st and 1 O.

1614
01:29:16,707 --> 01:29:17,942
Second Sportscaster:
Nail-biting time for the fans.

1615
01:29:18,008 --> 01:29:19,678
But it it suck-it-up
time for the players

1616
01:29:19,744 --> 01:29:21,646
because they have
to score on this drive.

1617
01:29:21,711 --> 01:29:23,147
Seth Maxwell fakes.

1618
01:29:23,214 --> 01:29:24,649
Hands off
to Andy Melbourne

1619
01:29:24,714 --> 01:29:26,483
and he's down for
a three-yard loss

1620
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:27,651
by Alcie Weeks.

1621
01:29:27,717 --> 01:29:29,519
They haven't kept
Weeks out all night.

1622
01:29:29,586 --> 01:29:31,556
He has been in that
backfield all day.

1623
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:32,889
They should
give him a uniform

1624
01:29:32,955 --> 01:29:34,692
they way he plays in
the North Dallas backfield.

1625
01:29:34,757 --> 01:29:37,328
lt'll be a 3-yard loss.
The clock is running.

1626
01:29:37,393 --> 01:29:38,828
l wonder what
they're saying

1627
01:29:38,893 --> 01:29:40,463
as far as strategy
is concerned

1628
01:29:40,529 --> 01:29:42,966
in the North Dallas
huddle?

1629
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:44,632
Jo Bob, when you get through
titty blocking Weeks,

1630
01:29:44,698 --> 01:29:45,866
why don't you
hit the fucker?

1631
01:29:45,932 --> 01:29:47,502
Why don't you
go fuck yourself?

1632
01:29:47,568 --> 01:29:50,039
Just hang on to the ball.
We'll take care of up front.

1633
01:29:50,103 --> 01:29:51,405
Fuck you, psycho!

1634
01:29:51,471 --> 01:29:53,073
Just get
the fucking ball

1635
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:54,642
across the line
of scrimmage.

1636
01:29:54,707 --> 01:29:56,844
You're a pain
in the ass!

1637
01:29:56,909 --> 01:29:58,444
Shut the fuck up!

1638
01:29:58,511 --> 01:30:01,717
Nobody talks in this
fucking huddle except me.

1639
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,583
Jo Bob, O.W.,
goddamn it,

1640
01:30:03,649 --> 01:30:05,084
l cannot
throw the football

1641
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:07,587
with these guys
hanging all over my ass.

1642
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:10,591
Fitch, l want
a wing-quick-burst.

1643
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:11,590
All right.

1644
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,592
Red-right-76 on two.

1645
01:30:13,657 --> 01:30:14,592
Ready?

1646
01:30:14,658 --> 01:30:15,793
Break!
Break!

1647
01:30:15,858 --> 01:30:18,663
Weeks, this time l'm fucking
going to kill you.

1648
01:30:23,999 --> 01:30:25,969
Hey,Jo Bob.

1649
01:30:26,034 --> 01:30:27,369
You're looking lousy.

1650
01:30:27,436 --> 01:30:29,740
You're getting old.
l hate to do it,

1651
01:30:29,804 --> 01:30:33,745
but l'm going to put
your dick all in the dirt.

1652
01:30:33,808 --> 01:30:34,743
Maxwell: Set!

1653
01:30:39,946 --> 01:30:42,483
4-48.

1654
01:30:42,549 --> 01:30:44,352
4-48.

1655
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:45,352
Hut!

1656
01:30:45,418 --> 01:30:46,486
Hut!

1657
01:30:46,553 --> 01:30:48,055
Sportscaster: Maxwell's
in a shotgun formation.

1658
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,555
He fades to pass...

1659
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:52,560
what a rush by Weeks,
who dumps him.

1660
01:30:52,624 --> 01:30:53,792
The pass is off,
though.

1661
01:30:53,858 --> 01:30:55,928
Fitch, streaking down
the middle, is in the open.

1662
01:30:55,993 --> 01:30:58,063
Drop it.

1663
01:30:58,129 --> 01:30:59,764
The pass is no good.

1664
01:31:01,466 --> 01:31:04,437
Come on, Fitch!
Concentrate!

1665
01:31:09,972 --> 01:31:11,574
Are you OK, baby?

1666
01:31:11,641 --> 01:31:12,575
Hey, Weeks!

1667
01:31:12,641 --> 01:31:14,177
Sportscaster:
The clock is stopped.

1668
01:31:14,243 --> 01:31:15,778
And now an altercation

1669
01:31:15,844 --> 01:31:18,048
breaks out
on the field.

1670
01:31:20,315 --> 01:31:23,086
Sportscaster 2: l can understand
why tempers are a little hot,

1671
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:25,087
because
the game's winding down.

1672
01:31:25,152 --> 01:31:27,222
Maxwell's asking
for a time out

1673
01:31:27,287 --> 01:31:29,591
although the clock
is stopped.

1674
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:32,461
We've got less than
a minute to play.

1675
01:31:32,526 --> 01:31:35,464
Maxwell coming to
talk to his coach.

1676
01:31:35,528 --> 01:31:37,965
You have to think
now that Chicago

1677
01:31:38,029 --> 01:31:39,064
will drop back
on defense

1678
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:40,398
and be in
a prevent defense

1679
01:31:40,465 --> 01:31:43,737
because North Dallas
to win this game

1680
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:45,704
will have to keep
it in the air.

1681
01:31:45,769 --> 01:31:49,142
This is the last time out
that North Dallas has.

1682
01:31:49,206 --> 01:31:50,641
They're probably
figuring out strategy

1683
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:53,547
that will allow them to run
3 or 4 plays in a row.

1684
01:31:53,611 --> 01:31:56,048
They have very little time left
if they're going to score.

1685
01:31:56,112 --> 01:31:58,049
Maxwell is signaling
to Phil Elliott

1686
01:31:58,114 --> 01:32:01,553
to come
into the ball game.

1687
01:32:01,618 --> 01:32:05,057
l'll go with Elliott
and Huddle as wide receivers.

1688
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,626
And we're going to look
for some pass plays.

1689
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:13,062
Having fun, boys?

1690
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:14,562
Blow it
out your ass.

1691
01:32:16,196 --> 01:32:17,566
How's the leg,
Del?

1692
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:18,834
Like your knee.

1693
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:20,468
l can't
feel anything.

1694
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:22,304
All right, huddle up!

1695
01:32:24,937 --> 01:32:27,741
Jo Bob, l ain't
Iosing this game.

1696
01:32:27,805 --> 01:32:30,177
l'm tired of Weeks sitting
on my face all night.

1697
01:32:30,242 --> 01:32:32,579
But
l hurt, Seth.

1698
01:32:32,645 --> 01:32:34,180
l hurt bad.

1699
01:32:34,245 --> 01:32:36,983
l don't give a shit.
We all hurt.

1700
01:32:37,047 --> 01:32:39,084
Let's trap
the son of a bitch.

1701
01:32:39,149 --> 01:32:41,620
O.W.,Jo Bob, break his
fucking leg if you have to.

1702
01:32:41,685 --> 01:32:43,088
l want him out of there.

1703
01:32:43,153 --> 01:32:44,188
All right?

1704
01:32:44,254 --> 01:32:45,756
Green-right-C-motion.

1705
01:32:45,821 --> 01:32:48,458
41 -trap-delay on three.

1706
01:32:48,524 --> 01:32:49,459
Ready?

1707
01:32:49,525 --> 01:32:50,660
Break!
Break!

1708
01:32:50,726 --> 01:32:52,496
Sportscaster: Maxwell brings
them out of the huddle.

1709
01:32:52,562 --> 01:32:54,298
You know Chicago's gonna
be coming on this play.

1710
01:32:54,362 --> 01:32:57,534
Let's see if they've
come up with a good play.

1711
01:32:57,599 --> 01:33:00,271
l wonder if Maxwell
called it or the coach.

1712
01:33:00,335 --> 01:33:01,770
Huddle lines up
on their left

1713
01:33:01,835 --> 01:33:03,270
and Maxwell
down under center.

1714
01:33:03,337 --> 01:33:06,543
The clock won't start
till the snap of the ball.

1715
01:33:06,607 --> 01:33:09,111
Huddle's in motion
to the right.

1716
01:33:10,176 --> 01:33:12,046
Back to pass
is Maxwell.

1717
01:33:12,111 --> 01:33:13,546
lt's a draw play
ball fake.

1718
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:18,051
[Whistles Blow]

1719
01:33:19,151 --> 01:33:20,653
Jo Bob: Suck
on that, Weeks.

1720
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:22,389
Sportscaster 2: Weeks,
the big defensive tackle

1721
01:33:22,454 --> 01:33:23,589
for Chicago is down.

1722
01:33:23,655 --> 01:33:26,059
This could be a serious blow
to the Marauders chances

1723
01:33:26,123 --> 01:33:29,061
if he is
out of the game.

1724
01:33:29,126 --> 01:33:30,828
North Dallas not only
gets a first down,

1725
01:33:30,894 --> 01:33:32,329
the clock
is stopped.

1726
01:33:32,395 --> 01:33:32,395
lt looks like he got
hurt in a trap block

1727
01:33:34,769 --> 01:33:35,570
lt looks like he got
hurt in a trap block

1728
01:33:35,636 --> 01:33:37,873
by Jo Bob Priddy
and O.W. Shaddock.

1729
01:33:37,937 --> 01:33:40,408
Weeks had been beating
those two all night

1730
01:33:40,473 --> 01:33:42,076
and they finally
got back at him.

1731
01:33:42,142 --> 01:33:44,646
And a big first down
for North Dallas.

1732
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:47,583
Jesus,Jo Bob, we
hurt him bad, man.

1733
01:33:47,647 --> 01:33:48,647
Fuck him.

1734
01:33:50,349 --> 01:33:51,951
Fuck him.

1735
01:33:52,016 --> 01:33:53,386
Huddle up.

1736
01:33:53,452 --> 01:33:54,419
Huddle up!

1737
01:33:58,089 --> 01:33:59,424
Aah!

1738
01:34:04,594 --> 01:34:07,533
Let's tie it up
and take it into overtime.

1739
01:34:07,597 --> 01:34:09,534
Can you get the outside
linebacker, Phil?

1740
01:34:09,599 --> 01:34:12,537
Del, it's your chance
to be a star.

1741
01:34:12,601 --> 01:34:13,803
Red-lax-92.

1742
01:34:13,869 --> 01:34:15,037
First sound,
all right?

1743
01:34:15,103 --> 01:34:16,038
Ready?

1744
01:34:16,104 --> 01:34:17,506
Break!
Break!

1745
01:34:17,572 --> 01:34:19,509
Sportscaster 2:
North Dallas has the ball

1746
01:34:19,574 --> 01:34:21,544
1 8 yards away
from a touchdown

1747
01:34:21,609 --> 01:34:24,046
but they have only 24 seconds
Ieft in the game.

1748
01:34:24,111 --> 01:34:26,548
They have to score
if they're going to tie

1749
01:34:26,613 --> 01:34:28,516
this championship contest up
and send it into overtime.

1750
01:34:28,582 --> 01:34:30,552
Maxwell sends Huddle
and Elliott to the left

1751
01:34:30,617 --> 01:34:33,054
so they overload
Chicago's right side

1752
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:34,554
on 1 st and 1 O.

1753
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:36,055
Back to pass,
Maxwell.

1754
01:34:36,122 --> 01:34:38,960
And the pass is to
Huddle on the sidelines.

1755
01:34:39,024 --> 01:34:41,361
There's a flag down
and Huddle is hurt.

1756
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:44,365
Oh, what a hit
from the secondary!

1757
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:46,365
Let's check
the penalty marker.

1758
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:48,300
The indication
from the official

1759
01:34:48,365 --> 01:34:51,370
is offensive holding
against the Bulls.

1760
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:53,371
So instead of a gain
for Huddle,

1761
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:56,375
it will be
a 1 O-yard penalty

1762
01:34:56,439 --> 01:34:57,874
against
North Dallas.

1763
01:34:57,940 --> 01:34:59,376
The play is erased.

1764
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:07,452
Goddamn it.
Look at his face.

1765
01:35:07,516 --> 01:35:08,951
Fix his face!

1766
01:35:09,016 --> 01:35:10,051
Elliott!

1767
01:35:10,117 --> 01:35:11,052
Elliott!

1768
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:12,153
Get up, Delma!

1769
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:14,156
Get back
in the huddle!

1770
01:35:14,222 --> 01:35:15,691
The doctor
will look after him!

1771
01:35:21,093 --> 01:35:24,867
You get back in that huddle now
or off the field!

1772
01:35:28,234 --> 01:35:30,571
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1773
01:35:34,038 --> 01:35:35,974
Sportscaster: Let's look
at that play again.

1774
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:38,477
Sportscaster 2:
This play was well set up.

1775
01:35:38,543 --> 01:35:39,978
Huddle takes a swing pass
from Maxwell.

1776
01:35:40,043 --> 01:35:42,680
He is wide open
when he starts down field.

1777
01:35:42,746 --> 01:35:45,183
But then he grabs his leg,
obviously in pain,

1778
01:35:45,248 --> 01:35:48,487
and Francis Chapman
Iays a massive blow on him.

1779
01:35:48,551 --> 01:35:52,124
There is no way Huddle will
make it back in this contest.

1780
01:35:52,187 --> 01:35:54,124
You should see
Delma's face.

1781
01:35:54,189 --> 01:35:55,624
Not now, Poot.

1782
01:35:55,690 --> 01:35:57,126
OK, let's get mean.

1783
01:35:57,192 --> 01:35:59,629
Let's stick it
up their ass.

1784
01:35:59,694 --> 01:36:01,564
Two plays,
back to back.

1785
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:03,065
Red-right-76

1786
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:06,068
and come back
with red-right-79.

1787
01:36:06,132 --> 01:36:07,300
Phil.

1788
01:36:09,569 --> 01:36:11,005
You throw it,
partner,

1789
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:12,605
l'll catch it.

1790
01:36:15,842 --> 01:36:17,711
Both plays on 2.

1791
01:36:17,777 --> 01:36:18,711
Ready...

1792
01:36:18,777 --> 01:36:19,979
break!

1793
01:36:20,045 --> 01:36:22,949
Sportscaster 2: The Bulls
have got only 1 6 seconds left,

1794
01:36:23,014 --> 01:36:26,453
but they are 28 yards
away from the score.

1795
01:36:26,517 --> 01:36:29,456
Sportscaster: 1 st and 20,
as Maxwell sets them up.

1796
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,456
The clock will start
when the snap is made.

1797
01:36:31,521 --> 01:36:32,957
Elliott is in motion
to the right.

1798
01:36:33,023 --> 01:36:34,458
Maxwell's back to pass.

1799
01:36:34,524 --> 01:36:35,959
He's going to Elliott.

1800
01:36:36,025 --> 01:36:38,362
lt's complete
at the 1 5-yard line,

1801
01:36:38,427 --> 01:36:39,963
but the clock
is running.

1802
01:36:40,029 --> 01:36:41,297
Good catch by Elliott,

1803
01:36:41,363 --> 01:36:43,834
but he didn't
get out of bounds.

1804
01:36:43,899 --> 01:36:45,736
They've got to hurry to get
another chance to score

1805
01:36:45,801 --> 01:36:46,669
before this game
is over.

1806
01:36:46,735 --> 01:36:47,669
5...

1807
01:36:47,735 --> 01:36:48,670
4...

1808
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:49,771
3...

1809
01:36:49,837 --> 01:36:50,772
2...

1810
01:36:50,838 --> 01:36:52,140
they got
the play off.

1811
01:37:11,556 --> 01:37:13,826
Yeow!
Yeah!

1812
01:37:17,728 --> 01:37:19,698
Yeah! Yeah!

1813
01:37:21,064 --> 01:37:22,266
Great catch!

1814
01:37:22,332 --> 01:37:24,469
Yeah!

1815
01:37:32,074 --> 01:37:34,244
You're my
ace in the hole.

1816
01:37:34,309 --> 01:37:35,244
Nice pass.

1817
01:37:36,478 --> 01:37:38,514
Sportscaster: North Dallas
has a chance to tie it.

1818
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:41,518
And Prejza, the outstanding
kicker, is in there.

1819
01:37:41,582 --> 01:37:43,786
Sportscaster 2: North Dallas
couldn't have the ball

1820
01:37:43,851 --> 01:37:45,854
in any better hands
in this case--or feet

1821
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,791
because Prejza has kicked
43 straight extra points.

1822
01:37:48,855 --> 01:37:51,293
That's a new
North Dallas record.

1823
01:37:51,358 --> 01:37:52,960
They're calling him
'' Mr. Automatic.''

1824
01:37:53,026 --> 01:37:54,027
There's the snap.

1825
01:37:54,093 --> 01:37:56,530
The ball gets away
from Hartman.

1826
01:37:56,595 --> 01:37:58,030
lt's on the ground.

1827
01:37:58,096 --> 01:38:00,534
Chicago recovers.
The game is over.

1828
01:38:00,599 --> 01:38:02,034
The Chicago Marauders

1829
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:05,038
have held off
the North Dallas rally

1830
01:38:05,102 --> 01:38:06,972
to win 1 4-1 3,
and what a finish.

1831
01:38:07,038 --> 01:38:09,977
That snap seemed
right on the money.

1832
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:11,977
Hartman just
couldn't control it.

1833
01:38:12,042 --> 01:38:14,346
What a shame
for North Dallas

1834
01:38:14,411 --> 01:38:15,813
after making such
a dramatic comeback

1835
01:38:15,879 --> 01:38:16,981
in the last few seconds.

1836
01:38:17,047 --> 01:38:19,484
An agonizing defeat
for North Dallas.

1837
01:38:19,548 --> 01:38:22,487
They thought they had
the ballgame tied.

1838
01:38:22,551 --> 01:38:24,487
They felt overtime
was upcoming.

1839
01:38:24,552 --> 01:38:25,988
And the Chicago
Marauders

1840
01:38:26,055 --> 01:38:27,490
have won
the championship

1841
01:38:27,555 --> 01:38:29,257
by 1 point.

1842
01:38:37,363 --> 01:38:38,498
How's Delma?

1843
01:38:38,564 --> 01:38:40,000
He needs surgery.

1844
01:38:48,573 --> 01:38:49,841
Hey, Elliott.

1845
01:38:51,576 --> 01:38:54,514
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

1846
01:38:54,578 --> 01:38:56,014
You played good.

1847
01:38:56,081 --> 01:39:01,023
l wish we could say the same
thing for you,Jo Bob.

1848
01:39:01,085 --> 01:39:03,022
You should've studied
Weeks' tendencies.

1849
01:39:03,087 --> 01:39:04,522
l thought l did.

1850
01:39:04,587 --> 01:39:06,022
You don't listen.

1851
01:39:06,089 --> 01:39:08,994
We would've won if we'd
studied those tendencies.

1852
01:39:09,059 --> 01:39:10,094
Aw, shit!

1853
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:11,327
You never
give us anything

1854
01:39:11,393 --> 01:39:12,762
to bring in the game

1855
01:39:12,828 --> 01:39:14,998
except your fucking
facts and tendencies!

1856
01:39:15,064 --> 01:39:17,368
To you, it's
just a business.

1857
01:39:17,432 --> 01:39:19,869
But to us,
it's still a sport.

1858
01:39:19,934 --> 01:39:21,336
You're supposed
to be professional--

1859
01:39:21,402 --> 01:39:22,871
We work harder
than anybody to win.

1860
01:39:22,937 --> 01:39:24,874
When we're dead tired
in the fourth quarter,

1861
01:39:24,939 --> 01:39:27,877
winning's got to mean
more than just money.

1862
01:39:27,941 --> 01:39:29,376
You were hired
to do a job!

1863
01:39:29,442 --> 01:39:31,880
l don't want
no fucking job!

1864
01:39:31,945 --> 01:39:33,514
l want to play
football, asshole!

1865
01:39:33,579 --> 01:39:34,547
l want some feeling!

1866
01:39:34,613 --> 01:39:37,150
l want some fucking
team spirit!

1867
01:39:37,215 --> 01:39:38,483
This ain't no high school.

1868
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:40,020
You don't have to love
each other to play.

1869
01:39:40,086 --> 01:39:41,521
That's what l mean,
you bastard.

1870
01:39:41,586 --> 01:39:44,190
Evey time l call it a game,
you call it a business.

1871
01:39:44,254 --> 01:39:46,424
And evey time l call it
a business, you call it a game.

1872
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:49,462
You and B.A. and all
you other coaches

1873
01:39:49,526 --> 01:39:50,961
are chicken-shit
cocksuckers.

1874
01:39:51,028 --> 01:39:53,967
No feeling
for the game at all.

1875
01:39:54,031 --> 01:39:55,066
You'll win,

1876
01:39:55,132 --> 01:39:56,601
but it'll just be
numbers on a scoreboard.

1877
01:39:56,666 --> 01:39:58,035
Numbers, that's all
you care about.

1878
01:39:58,101 --> 01:39:59,069
That's not enough
for me.

1879
01:39:59,135 --> 01:40:00,070
l don't have
to listen--

1880
01:40:00,136 --> 01:40:02,073
Oh, yes, you fucking do!

1881
01:40:02,138 --> 01:40:05,076
You got to listen
to me for once!

1882
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:08,246
All you coaches are
chicken-shit cocksuckers!

1883
01:40:08,309 --> 01:40:09,644
Goddamn you!

1884
01:40:11,579 --> 01:40:13,281
Far out.

1885
01:40:19,252 --> 01:40:20,219
Hartman: For...

1886
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:44,545
[Grunts]

1887
01:40:52,051 --> 01:40:54,021
Hey, Del,
how you doing?

1888
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,995
Hey, come on, man.

1889
01:41:04,061 --> 01:41:05,497
You'll be back.

1890
01:41:09,566 --> 01:41:10,668
Um, um...

1891
01:41:10,734 --> 01:41:12,002
[Sobbing]

1892
01:41:12,068 --> 01:41:13,504
Come on. Hey, Del.

1893
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:16,007
Come on.
You're going to be back.

1894
01:41:16,072 --> 01:41:17,507
Come on, huh?

1895
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:38,792
Come on.

1896
01:41:49,868 --> 01:41:51,136
Whoa.

1897
01:41:55,606 --> 01:41:56,941
Good boy.

1898
01:42:02,045 --> 01:42:03,180
Hi.

1899
01:42:03,247 --> 01:42:04,181
Hi.

1900
01:42:04,248 --> 01:42:07,086
Are you all right?

1901
01:42:07,150 --> 01:42:08,585
Yeah.

1902
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:10,854
Just slightly damaged.

1903
01:42:13,155 --> 01:42:16,094
Look, um, l'm sorry
about the other night.

1904
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:19,129
l had no right,
no right at all.

1905
01:42:24,031 --> 01:42:26,402
You had a right.

1906
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:33,307
You see the game?

1907
01:42:33,372 --> 01:42:34,474
Yeah.

1908
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:35,475
See the catch l made?

1909
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:36,976
Yeah.
It was terrific.

1910
01:42:37,042 --> 01:42:38,644
l'm sorry you lost.

1911
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:41,614
l thought l was going
to start that game.

1912
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:44,116
Hell, l even
shot up my knee,

1913
01:42:44,182 --> 01:42:46,553
but they weren't going
to let me start.

1914
01:42:46,616 --> 01:42:47,884
They were using me

1915
01:42:47,951 --> 01:42:50,623
to get another ball player
to deaden his leg.

1916
01:42:50,687 --> 01:42:52,589
God, that's awful.

1917
01:42:52,655 --> 01:42:55,560
Yeah. Well
that's the way 'it is.

1918
01:42:55,624 --> 01:42:59,063
But what's important
is my performing...

1919
01:42:59,128 --> 01:43:02,567
the moment of the catch,
that feeling, that high.

1920
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:04,567
Hell
l can take th' e crap.

1921
01:43:04,632 --> 01:43:06,234
l can take
the manipulation.

1922
01:43:06,301 --> 01:43:08,238
l can take the pain.

1923
01:43:08,303 --> 01:43:11,107
As long as l get
that chance evey Sunday.

1924
01:43:11,171 --> 01:43:15,178
l think that this game
is twisting your mind.

1925
01:43:15,242 --> 01:43:18,181
The game's not twisting
my mind, Charlotte.

1926
01:43:18,245 --> 01:43:20,081
l know the game.

1927
01:43:20,146 --> 01:43:23,519
lt's the rules
they make up.

1928
01:43:25,650 --> 01:43:27,587
l'm going to play,

1929
01:43:27,652 --> 01:43:30,156
so l'm going
by their rules.

1930
01:43:30,222 --> 01:43:32,826
You can't separate
one from the other.

1931
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:35,595
Yeah, but l can't buck
their system or fight them

1932
01:43:35,659 --> 01:43:37,963
any more than
you can drop out.

1933
01:43:38,028 --> 01:43:39,263
lf you've made up
your mind,

1934
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:41,300
why did you
come to me?

1935
01:43:41,365 --> 01:43:44,269
'Cause l care
about you...

1936
01:43:45,667 --> 01:43:47,404
and l want
to see you again.

1937
01:44:01,815 --> 01:44:03,485
l've got a meeting
with Conrad Hunter.

1938
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:05,987
Hell, l can't let him see

1939
01:44:06,052 --> 01:44:08,556
that the merchandise
is damaged.

1940
01:44:08,621 --> 01:44:10,558
Here. Let me help you.

1941
01:44:10,623 --> 01:44:11,558
Yeah.

1942
01:44:11,624 --> 01:44:14,562
You know,
when you think about it,

1943
01:44:14,626 --> 01:44:17,565
they're not worse
than anybody else, really.

1944
01:44:33,042 --> 01:44:34,412
Come in, Phil.

1945
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:35,544
Come on in.

1946
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:45,087
Hello, B.A.

1947
01:44:47,588 --> 01:44:49,357
Sit there,
Phil.

1948
01:44:54,594 --> 01:44:56,531
All right, Ray.

1949
01:44:56,596 --> 01:44:59,534
Mr. Elliott,
where were you last Monday

1950
01:44:59,598 --> 01:45:01,768
until approximately
8 A.M. Tuesday?

1951
01:45:04,603 --> 01:45:07,307
Uh, who wants
to know that?

1952
01:45:07,372 --> 01:45:08,407
l'm Ray March.

1953
01:45:08,472 --> 01:45:09,807
l'm with the league's

1954
01:45:09,874 --> 01:45:11,243
lnternal Investigations
Division.

1955
01:45:11,309 --> 01:45:13,346
On Tuesday of last week,
where were you?

1956
01:45:17,614 --> 01:45:20,051
uh...
now that, um...

1957
01:45:20,116 --> 01:45:22,553
l don't know.
You know that.

1958
01:45:22,618 --> 01:45:26,091
Why don't you tell me
where l was, huh?

1959
01:45:26,155 --> 01:45:28,559
No, no, no.
W-wait a minute.

1960
01:45:32,126 --> 01:45:35,065
Let me give you
a little hint,

1961
01:45:35,129 --> 01:45:38,068
'cause that wise-ass
attitude of yours

1962
01:45:38,132 --> 01:45:41,070
isn't going to get you
out of this one,

1963
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:42,770
you understand that?

1964
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:47,511
l think you'd best
answer, Phil, old boy.

1965
01:45:54,313 --> 01:45:55,381
All right.

1966
01:45:59,084 --> 01:46:01,020
Ruth, would, um...

1967
01:46:01,086 --> 01:46:04,024
would you send in
Mr. Rindquist, please?

1968
01:46:20,601 --> 01:46:22,037
Go ahead,
Mr. Rindquist.

1969
01:46:22,104 --> 01:46:23,539
l am Joseph Rindquist,

1970
01:46:23,604 --> 01:46:27,043
and l am a vice-officer
with the Dallas Police.

1971
01:46:27,108 --> 01:46:30,047
Off-duty, l work
for Mr. Ray March

1972
01:46:30,111 --> 01:46:32,047
investigating reports
of league misconduct.

1973
01:46:32,112 --> 01:46:33,214
One week ago,

1974
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:36,218
l was instructed to
take up the surveillance

1975
01:46:36,282 --> 01:46:37,817
of Philip Elliott,

1976
01:46:37,883 --> 01:46:40,220
an employee
of the Dallas franchise.

1977
01:46:40,285 --> 01:46:41,921
l followed the suspect
from then

1978
01:46:41,987 --> 01:46:46,595
until he boarded the plane
for Chicago this last weekend.

1979
01:46:46,658 --> 01:46:49,864
And all this time l thought
l was just paranoid.

1980
01:46:49,927 --> 01:46:51,864
Rindquist: ''On Monday of this week,

1981
01:46:51,929 --> 01:46:55,368
at a party in a private
North Dallas residence,

1982
01:46:55,433 --> 01:46:58,371
the suspect was observed
near the swimming pool

1983
01:46:58,435 --> 01:46:59,670
in the company

1984
01:46:59,735 --> 01:47:02,273
of an unidentified
caucasian adult male.''

1985
01:47:02,339 --> 01:47:03,507
What do you mean,

1986
01:47:03,572 --> 01:47:05,341
''an unidentified
white caucasian male,''

1987
01:47:05,408 --> 01:47:06,676
for Christ's sake?

1988
01:47:06,741 --> 01:47:07,943
Didn't you recognize him?

1989
01:47:10,578 --> 01:47:13,516
Who was it
that was with me?

1990
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:15,517
Didn't you
recognize him, huh?

1991
01:47:22,056 --> 01:47:24,860
Some investigator.

1992
01:47:24,924 --> 01:47:26,661
Continue, Mr. Rindquist.

1993
01:47:28,928 --> 01:47:30,363
''At this time,

1994
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:31,865
the suspect
was photographed

1995
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:34,334
smoking
a marijuana cigarette.''

1996
01:47:36,468 --> 01:47:37,903
Photo exhibit ''F.''

1997
01:47:40,604 --> 01:47:43,542
''Now, picking up the suspect
again on Tuesday,

1998
01:47:43,606 --> 01:47:46,043
l followed him
from these offices

1999
01:47:46,109 --> 01:47:48,547
to 261 2 Houston Drive,

2000
01:47:48,611 --> 01:47:50,547
where he remained
until morning.

2001
01:47:50,612 --> 01:47:52,549
This address
is the residence

2002
01:47:52,614 --> 01:47:54,818
of a woman named
Joanne Rodney--''

2003
01:47:54,883 --> 01:47:58,422
We don't need to bring
others into this mess.

2004
01:48:02,724 --> 01:48:03,992
Continue.

2005
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:10,001
''A search of the suspect's
premises was effected,

2006
01:48:10,063 --> 01:48:13,135
uncovering a bag
of marijuana...

2007
01:48:14,401 --> 01:48:16,571
and assorted pills.''

2008
01:48:16,635 --> 01:48:16,635
You got this
from Mr. Elliott's house?

2009
01:48:18,375 --> 01:48:19,510
You got this
from Mr. Elliott's house?

2010
01:48:19,576 --> 01:48:20,845
Yes, sir.

2011
01:48:22,579 --> 01:48:24,014
lllegal drugs
are forbidden

2012
01:48:24,079 --> 01:48:26,016
by the league rules, Phil.

2013
01:48:26,081 --> 01:48:27,416
You know that.

2014
01:48:27,483 --> 01:48:29,019
For Christ's sake--
Jesus, smoking grass?

2015
01:48:29,084 --> 01:48:30,519
Are you kidding me?

2016
01:48:30,586 --> 01:48:32,690
If you nailed
all the ballplayers

2017
01:48:32,754 --> 01:48:33,856
that smoked grass,

2018
01:48:33,921 --> 01:48:36,525
you couldn't field
a punt return team.

2019
01:48:36,591 --> 01:48:39,195
You give me harder stuff
in Chicago

2020
01:48:39,259 --> 01:48:41,931
just to get out of the
goddamn locker room,

2021
01:48:41,995 --> 01:48:43,530
hard drugs.

2022
01:48:43,597 --> 01:48:44,765
What's...

2023
01:48:47,933 --> 01:48:49,035
Continue.

2024
01:48:49,101 --> 01:48:52,040
Uh, photo exhibit ''H''
shows Mr. Elliott

2025
01:48:52,104 --> 01:48:54,775
in the company of a woman
named Charlotte Calder

2026
01:48:54,839 --> 01:48:57,276
as they leave
a county and western--

2027
01:48:57,342 --> 01:48:58,310
Jesus Christ!

2028
01:48:58,376 --> 01:48:59,544
You sleazy bastard!

2029
01:48:59,611 --> 01:49:01,314
Sit down
in that chair!

2030
01:49:01,379 --> 01:49:03,716
What do you think
you're doing here?

2031
01:49:03,781 --> 01:49:06,218
Who the hell
you think you are?

2032
01:49:06,283 --> 01:49:08,220
We treated you
pretty well.

2033
01:49:08,285 --> 01:49:10,221
We paid you
damn well!

2034
01:49:10,286 --> 01:49:12,390
Ty to earn
that much out there.

2035
01:49:12,455 --> 01:49:14,392
You're in
for a surprise!

2036
01:49:14,457 --> 01:49:16,059
l'll take care of this.

2037
01:49:16,124 --> 01:49:19,063
You're nothing but a
two-bit football player.

2038
01:49:19,127 --> 01:49:20,062
Calm down!

2039
01:49:20,128 --> 01:49:21,563
Let him talk.

2040
01:49:22,797 --> 01:49:24,333
Let him talk.

2041
01:49:28,135 --> 01:49:30,606
You got anything
to say, Phil?

2042
01:49:33,139 --> 01:49:34,407
Nah.

2043
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:40,181
Are you part of this,
B.A.?

2044
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,419
Phil, you have the best
hands in football.

2045
01:49:44,483 --> 01:49:47,522
There's a lot more
to this business

2046
01:49:47,586 --> 01:49:48,888
than ability.

2047
01:49:51,456 --> 01:49:53,893
You're wrong,
because it is ability.

2048
01:49:53,957 --> 01:49:58,031
lt is what l can do
with these hands,

2049
01:49:58,094 --> 01:50:01,265
and that's why
l play the game.

2050
01:50:01,331 --> 01:50:03,367
lt's dedication.

2051
01:50:03,432 --> 01:50:04,534
lt's discipline.

2052
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:05,702
lt's sacrifice.

2053
01:50:05,767 --> 01:50:08,204
You can't
take all the time.

2054
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:10,974
You have to give something
back to the game.

2055
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:12,207
For Christ's sake,
my nose is busted.

2056
01:50:12,273 --> 01:50:14,543
l can't even
breathe through it.

2057
01:50:14,609 --> 01:50:16,379
l can hardly stand up.

2058
01:50:16,444 --> 01:50:18,246
l haven't slept
more than three hours

2059
01:50:18,312 --> 01:50:19,747
at a stretch in two years.

2060
01:50:19,813 --> 01:50:21,382
lsn't that giving
something back?

2061
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:24,887
There's pieces of me scattered
from here to Pittsburgh

2062
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:26,386
on these football fields.

2063
01:50:26,452 --> 01:50:29,257
lsn't that giving something
back to the game?

2064
01:50:29,322 --> 01:50:30,257
Isn't it?

2065
01:50:34,292 --> 01:50:35,560
B.A...

2066
01:50:35,627 --> 01:50:37,764
B.A...

2067
01:50:37,828 --> 01:50:39,063
B.A...

2068
01:50:39,129 --> 01:50:42,568
how can you
take this away from me?

2069
01:50:42,633 --> 01:50:44,970
How can you do this?

2070
01:50:49,572 --> 01:50:50,840
OK, Phil.

2071
01:50:52,242 --> 01:50:54,679
Only now l
speak for myself.

2072
01:50:56,078 --> 01:50:58,515
And it's your
childish attitude.

2073
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:00,784
You hurt the team.

2074
01:51:02,416 --> 01:51:03,417
Team?

2075
01:51:08,255 --> 01:51:09,691
They're the team!

2076
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:12,726
These guys right here,
B.A.

2077
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:15,229
They're the team.
We're the equipment.

2078
01:51:15,295 --> 01:51:17,231
We're the jockstraps,
the helmets.

2079
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:18,531
They just depreciate us

2080
01:51:18,597 --> 01:51:21,202
and take us off their
goddamn tax returns!

2081
01:51:21,267 --> 01:51:22,435
That's what that is.

2082
01:51:28,106 --> 01:51:29,441
Yeah. Well...

2083
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:39,051
l was good
when l played.

2084
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:46,055
Because the only thing

2085
01:51:46,121 --> 01:51:47,991
that's real
in that game...

2086
01:51:49,391 --> 01:51:50,359
is me.

2087
01:51:52,394 --> 01:51:54,196
And that's enough.

2088
01:51:55,563 --> 01:51:58,001
Well, l feel
for you, Phil,

2089
01:51:58,065 --> 01:52:00,502
but you confused
Iuck and brain.

2090
01:52:00,568 --> 01:52:03,506
You betrayed me.
You betrayed my family.

2091
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:05,073
l tried to warn you.

2092
01:52:05,138 --> 01:52:06,540
You violated
the morals clause

2093
01:52:06,606 --> 01:52:08,509
of your contract.

2094
01:52:08,575 --> 01:52:10,010
lt's that simple,

2095
01:52:10,075 --> 01:52:12,012
so, pending
a league hearing,

2096
01:52:12,077 --> 01:52:14,381
you're hereby suspended
without pay.

2097
01:52:14,446 --> 01:52:15,581
Yeah?

2098
01:52:16,748 --> 01:52:19,018
ls that what it is, Emmett?

2099
01:52:19,083 --> 01:52:22,522
ls that what this whole
charade has been about,

2100
01:52:22,587 --> 01:52:25,525
so you don't have
to pay my contract?

2101
01:52:25,589 --> 01:52:28,528
l don't need your money
that bad. l quit!

2102
01:52:49,042 --> 01:52:50,978
You are right, B.A.

2103
01:52:51,043 --> 01:52:52,713
Thank you.

2104
01:52:55,047 --> 01:52:57,518
lt's time to put away
childish things.

2105
01:53:35,583 --> 01:53:37,586
Things get ugly up there?

2106
01:53:44,089 --> 01:53:45,257
Pretty ugly.

2107
01:53:48,527 --> 01:53:49,962
My name come up?

2108
01:53:52,030 --> 01:53:52,965
Uh...

2109
01:53:53,031 --> 01:53:54,133
ahem.

2110
01:53:54,198 --> 01:53:57,504
There's no reason
to bring you into this.

2111
01:54:00,538 --> 01:54:02,474
They suspend you?

2112

l quit.

2113
01:54:03,707 --> 01:54:06,913
l can't take it.
They want too much.

2114
01:54:08,545 --> 01:54:10,381
Too much ain't enough.

2115
01:54:11,547 --> 01:54:12,982
Not for them.

2116
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:16,485
What you gonna do?

2117
01:54:18,219 --> 01:54:19,654

2118
01:54:21,556 --> 01:54:22,991

2119
01:54:23,057 --> 01:54:25,829
l'm going to get
in bed with Charlotte.

2120
01:54:25,894 --> 01:54:28,498
l'm going to spend
a week with her.

2121
01:54:28,562 --> 01:54:29,997
l'm going to heal up.

2122
01:54:30,063 --> 01:54:33,502
l'll spend time with her
and take it easy.

2123
01:54:33,566 --> 01:54:34,501
Hoss.

2124
01:54:34,567 --> 01:54:35,669
Hmm?

2125
01:54:35,735 --> 01:54:39,174
l appreciate you keeping
my name out of it.

2126
01:54:39,237 --> 01:54:40,672
Uh, no sweat.

2127
01:54:45,076 --> 01:54:46,511
You knew about it.

2128
01:54:49,513 --> 01:54:51,950
You know evey thing,
don't you, Max?

2129
01:54:53,517 --> 01:54:54,952
That l do, Poot.

2130
01:54:58,521 --> 01:54:59,956
That l do.

2131
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:10,866
Hey, Poot.

2132
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:13,302
Yeah?

2133
01:55:13,367 --> 01:55:16,305
Got any of them
old pain killers?

2134
01:55:21,541 --> 01:55:22,976
You keep them, cowboy.

2135
01:55:23,042 --> 01:55:24,477
You're going
to need them.

2136
01:55:29,247 --> 01:55:30,817
Ahh.

2137
01:55:30,883 --> 01:55:31,918
Hey, Seth.

2138
01:55:33,551 --> 01:55:37,324
We really had them worried
in Chicago, didn't we?

2139
01:55:37,387 --> 01:55:39,892
Best catch
l ever seen, Poot.

2140
01:55:39,958 --> 01:55:42,662
Not a bad pass either.

2141
01:55:44,561 --> 01:55:46,030
Good luck on Sunday.

2142
01:55:50,904 --> 01:55:51,805
Hey, Poot.

2143
01:55:51,838 --> 01:55:52,839
Yeah?
