1
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,325
And good morning, Dallas.
Ron Chapman on KVIL.

2
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,294
We've got a gorgeous morning
working outside.

3
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,096
Temperatures at 8:00
in the morning

4
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,698
standing already
at 68 degrees outside.

5
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,466
We expect them
to go up to, oh,

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,435
75 degrees sometime
this afternoon...

7
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:50,644
Oh!

8
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,582
Get his ass
out of there, Jo Bob!

9
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,351
I ain't touching
no faggot!

10
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,586
Faggot!

11
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,621
Give me five!

12
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,489
Get out of there before you drown, asshole.

13
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:16,657
Get out of there.
Let's go hunting.

14
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,725
I ain't going hunting.

15
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,493
What? Come on!

16
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,028
Let's kill something!
Get up.

17
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,863
Come on.
No! Get out of here!

18
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,765
Oh, come on,
you goddamn...

19
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,300
We just want to kill
a little something. Come on.

20
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,869
Yee-haw!

21
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,741
Ha! Damn!

22
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,844
See that old cow
out there?

23
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,346
Want to see her run?

24
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,016
Oh, Christ,
they're shooting at cows.

25
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,519
Hell, they're too drunk to hit anything.
Don't worry about it.

26
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,521
Oh, man,
they're just crazy.

27
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,728
Oh, my God.

28
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,402
Do you know something?
Hmm?

29
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,870
O.W., did you see that?

30
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,673
I can't figure out how I dropped that turn-in.

31
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:06,974
It happens.

32
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,109
No, man, not to me
it doesn't, you know?

33
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,944
Jesus Christ,
you caught the game.

34
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,513
Let it pass, pal.

35
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,548
Relax. Enjoy yourself.
It's a pretty day.

36
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,786
Man, I had that ball
right in my hands.

37
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,690
I just couldn't hang on
to the damn thing.

38
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,124
John Henry, the man
is just like you.

39
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,826
He's never satisfied.

40
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:30,330
Hey, I'm going to dump
these suckers up here.

41
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,603
Gee whiz, son!

42
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:38,038
God dang, the marines
have landed!

43
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,911
Come on out!
Surrender, you suckers!

44
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,380
Ha!

45
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,450
Come on, O.W.,
go and fake them fuckers up.

46
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,720
Elliott, where's
your gun, man?

47
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,391
Freud says that guns are an extension of your dingie,
Jo Bob.

48
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,992
That son of a bitch.

49
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:01,629
He's a regular wise-ass,
you know that?

50
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,399
Hold up, O.W.

51
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,503
B.A. wants me
in his office tomorrow.

52
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,472
Oh, yeah?

53
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,873
Must mean I'm going
to start, huh?

54
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,708
I doubt that, poot.

55
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,511
What the hell do you mean?
I made some great catches.

56
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,979
They can't keep me
on the bench forever.

57
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,149
Son, you ain't never going to get off that bench

58
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,017
till you stop
fighting them suckers.

59
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,586
You got to learn
how to fool them, man.

60
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,422
Give them
what they want.

61
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,991
I know. I've been fooling
them bastards for years now.

62
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,627
For Christ's sake, man.
If you start pretending to be somebody else,

63
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,729
that's what you're going to end up,
being somebody else.

64
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:38,198
God damn it, if I didn't
like you, boy,

65
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,068
if you didn't have
such great pair of hands,

66
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,637
I'd keep my mouth shut and watch you go right down the tubes.

67
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,640
I'm going to tell you something for your own good.

68
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,442
You had better learn
how to play the game.

69
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,411
And I don't just mean
the game of football.

70
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,584
Hell, we're
all whores, anyway.

71
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:57,918
We might as well
be the best.

72
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:02,055
There's one!
God, watch...

73
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,894
Damn you, Jo Bob!
You crazy son of a bitch!

74
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,596
Jesus Christ!

75
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,764
Why? We damn near got the bird.
Didn't you see it?

76
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,766
I think we did get him.
Jesus Christ!

77
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,574
Go! Go! Go! Go!

78
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,986
All right, let me have
that TV right here.

79
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,489
There it is!

80
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,561
Thirteen. Look for thirteen.

81
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,699
Yep, I'd rather face
Pittsburgh's defensive line

82
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,934
than one of
Peter's parties.

83
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:49,770
Somebody's got to
do it, though. Right?

84
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,005
Hey, man, it's all yours.
Go for it. Right.

85
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,874
Hey, big guy. How you doing?
Good to see you.

86
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,209
How's it going?
Good game, baby.

87
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,745
Tony, good game,
my man.

88
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,713
Howdy, howdy.

89
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,749
Hey, Seth,
great game, boy.

90
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,950
Hey, mama.

91
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,254
All right, sweetie,

92
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,222
come on, now give Jo Bob a nice kiss.
Come on.

93
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,824
Hey, it's nice
to be back, man.

94
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,025
All right,
come on, come on!

95
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,294
Ah, goddamn!

96
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,565
Hey, Maxwell!
Hey, Seth!

97
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,297
Hey, Phil.

98
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,266
Hey, Peter,
where's that dolly you promised me?

99
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,902
Ooh, he's ripped
tonight, ain't he?

100
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,203
Hey, Jo Bob,
what are you going to do against

101
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,771
Alcie Weeks
in Chicago?

102
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,779
You know what I mean?
Crazy guy!

103
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,114
Know what I mean?
Crazy guy.

104
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,716
Come here, come here.
Oh.

105
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,718
Hey, Jo Bob,
I got a great dolly for you.

106
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,586
She's last year's
Miss Farm Implements.

107
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,054
Come on this way.

108
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,322
You should talk to her
for five minutes.

109
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,190
She's from SMU,
and she's almost a virgin.

110
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,692
Hey, doll, come on here.

111
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,728
Now, help him
to relax, honey.

112
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,796
He needs, uh, understanding. Yeah.

113
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,331
Show 'em
your finesse, Jo Bob!

114
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:25,866
Hey, Billie Joe!

115
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,672
I've never seen
titties like yours.

116
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,841
I swear to God,
I never have.

117
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,208
They're... They're beautiful.
They're...

118
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,710
Hey, Jo Bob,
how you doing?

119
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:37,845
How you doing, Elliott?

120
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,883
Can I show your titties
to my buddy O. W?

121
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,318
Can I? Would you?
All right?

122
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,855
O. W! O. W!
Come over here!

123
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:49,890
Whoo!

124
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,925
Ooh, John Henry,
don't get so excited.

125
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,961
We got all night.
Who's John Henry?

126
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,632
He's an old friend of mine.
Ooh.

127
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,634
Hey, did you girls ever try
a quarterback sandwich?

128
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,636
Sounds good to me.

129
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,037
Hey, Seth,
I need to talk to you

130
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,372
about that condo deal
down at Padre Island.

131
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,274
Not now.
Not now, baby.

132
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,109
Hey, did you ever drink
a pink poontang?

133
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,745
No.
It'll get you high.

134
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,381
Hey, Phil. Phil.

135
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,983
Great catch, boy.
Great catch.

136
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,985
Listen, I got some
ostrich boots

137
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,120
and some lizard,
and I'm going to get them for you

138
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,621
soon as I change my shirt.

139
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,825
Say, Alan,
be with you in a minute.

140
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,459
Got to go
change my shirt!

141
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,867
Hey, Phil. Oh, man,
we were just leaving.

142
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,402
Hey, Eric.
Hi, Susie. Hi.

143
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,569
Susie wants to get home

144
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,873
and put little Audrey to bed,
you know, all that.

145
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:41,274
Yeah, and it's almost time for the Osmonds.

146
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,943
So, um...

147
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,945
Why don't you come over Wednesday night for dinner?

148
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,280
Yeah. Look, guy,
why don't you come on over?

149
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,016
Fitch and his wife
are coming.

150
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,318
Afterward, Susie's going to read some scripture,
you know.

151
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,686
Uh...

152
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,890
Oh, man, maybe we'll all
take turns or something.

153
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,425
Hmm. All right,
I'll try hard. Okay?

154
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,993
Yeah.
Okay.

155
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,294
All right.
See what you can do.

156
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,696
All right, Sue. Come on.
We got plenty.

157
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,831
Bye. See you later.
Bye.

158
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:04,798
All right? All right?
All right.

159
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,902
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, Billy.

160
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:09,970
See you later.

161
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,420
Being a little hard on yourself,
aren't you, Andy.

162
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,388
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.

163
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,190
See that stewardess over there?
Which one?

164
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,158
Oh, that one,
over there.

165
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,831
Goddamn, does she
get off on football?

166
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,800
Man, you know,

167
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,735
Allie got some tits
from her the other night

168
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,804
just by showing her that little bruise on his calf!

169
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:46,006
The way I figure it,

170
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,941
if she's going to
give up some tits

171
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,143
just by showing her
a bruise, you know,

172
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,080
I mean, once she sees
this blood here,

173
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,082
you know,
she might give up the whole thing.

174
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,083
You know what I mean?
Uh-huh.

175
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,889
Hey, Phil,
I'd love to sit here

176
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,323
and talk to you,
but I can't.

177
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:07,260
I got to test out
Balford's theory of erotica.

178
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,728
Check you later, baby.

179
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,334
He's real intelligent,
ain't he?

180
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,305
Oh, poor baby.
You like that?

181
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,472
Oh.

182
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,208
Come on, Andy,
I'm with her.

183
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,876
Andy, I'm with her,
I said!

184
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,087
Why don't you
just get in there

185
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,789
and just go ahead
and kiss him?

186
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,793
It's nice to see there's a little romance left in the world.

187
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,341
It's an old story,
boy meets boy.

188
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,408
Well, I love
happy endings.

189
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,344
Oh, really? Well, good.

190
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,380
Now we can sit back and wait for the real obscenities.

191
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,850
You mean it gets worse?

192
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,285
It definitely
gets different.

193
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,888
See, alcohol and fear makes for a good combination.

194
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,557
Fear?
Mmm-hmm.

195
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,225
What are they afraid of?

196
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,227
Falling on their
asses in Chicago.

197
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,170
Who are you,
and what are you doing here?

198
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:26,173
Charlotte Calder,
and I'm asking myself the same question.

199
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,108
Well, I'm Phil Elliott,
and I'm supposed to be here

200
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,342
to take you away
from all this.

201
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,146
Oh, yeah. See,
I'm a very funny guy.

202
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,948
In fact, The newspapers
call me "The team funnyman."

203
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,284
Well, obviously,
you can't believe

204
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,151
everything you read.

205
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,154
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,090
I'm not very good
at this small talk stuff.

207
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,260
In fact,
I learned all my social graces from football coaches,

208
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,396
so, uh,
why don't you just give me another try, huh?

209
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,099
Okay, team funnyman.

210
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,438
You've got fantastic eyes.

211
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,308
Hilarious.

212
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,214
Hey, man, quit pushing
on me, man.

213
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,450
Put me down!

214
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,618
Why can't somebody
stop him?

215
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,120
What, are you crazy?

216
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,956
Look at him.

217
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,958
No! Please. No!
- Put her down.

218
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,994
Come on, man.
Come on.

219
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,396
- Come on, man.
- Put me down.

220
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,098
Jo Bob's here
to remind everybody

221
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,099
that the meanest
and the biggest

222
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,400
get to make all the rules.

223
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,503
Well, I don't agree
with that.

224
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,105
Agreement doesn't
enter into it.

225
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,914
Well, how can you
tolerate that?

226
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,253
I make allowances,
then I get ready, and I run like hell.

227
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,022
That's what I like.
A man of courage.

228
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,528
Miss? My name's Jo Bob.

229
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,896
I just want to tell you...

230
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,897
- Will you please let me pass?
- I love your hair

231
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,899
and I love your nose.
Lady... Let me go!

232
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,102
And I love your legs.
Put me down.

233
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,670
You know I love your legs.

234
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,405
They got your feet on one end...
Will you please put me down?

235
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,174
...and your pussy on the other,
and I want to fuck you.

236
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,376
I'd really do this.
You put me down!

237
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,477
Will you let me go?
Lady, come on now.

238
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,545
You be nice, all right.
I'm going to be nice to you.

239
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,181
Oh, no. I promise you,
I'm going to be nice

240
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:16,549
to you, understand? Come on.
- Let me go!

241
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,052
I'm not going to let anybody take you away from me ever.

242
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,720
Will you please?
What are you so fussy about, lady?

243
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,322
Jo Bob.

244
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,623
Piss off, Elliott.

245
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,591
Hey, come on back.

246
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,426
Hey, Seth! Seth!

247
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,963
Find something for Jo Bob to do with his hands, huh.

248
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,965
Hey, Jo Bob. Jo Bob.

249
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,400
I told you
to piss off, Elliott.

250
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,202
Jo Bob, let her go.

251
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,038
Shit!

252
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,306
Oh!

253
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,108
Bob, God damn it.

254
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,509
Who the fuck are you
giving orders to?

255
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,444
Jo Bob.
Hey, Jo Bob, cool it!

256
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,812
I'm going to kill you.

257
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,048
Hey, man,
he's just trying to keep that little dolly from raping you.

258
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,017
Come on, baby.
Jo Bob.

259
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,186
Hey, hey, it's me. Seth!
Come on, man. Relax.

260
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,488
It's a party.
Come on, Jo Bob.

261
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,457
Calm down, baby.

262
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,360
Damn! Why is he always
making fun of me, Seth?

263
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,130
Go! Go! Go! Go!

264
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,546
Hey, I know you.
You had your chance.

265
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,751
What the hell are you
trying to prove, man,

266
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,319
taking on Jo Bob
over some chick?

267
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,256
Oh, for Christ's sake,
Seth, shit.

268
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,491
Seemed like a good idea
at the time, that's all.

269
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,725
A good idea?

270
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,595
I need Jo Bob, son.

271
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,230
I want him up.

272
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:38,365
I want him feeling
like he can climb

273
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,766
the Empire State
Building if he has to.

274
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,337
Look, you may keep me
on the sports page, man,

275
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,039
but he keeps me
off the obituaries.

276
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,308
Where the hell would I be

277
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,609
with Jo Bob's
confidence destroyed?

278
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,416
God damn it, son,
what did she expect?

279
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,451
These girls know what happens at these parties.

280
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,452
That's why they come here.

281
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,390
She didn't seem
like that to me.

282
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,133
Well, look, just lay off
Jo Bob, all right?

283
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,102
I want you both
at your best Monday night.

284
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:21,074
Oh, for Christ's sake,
I didn't hurt Jo Bob.

285
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,509
Damn it, just quit
aggravating him.

286
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,510
Let him have
what he wants.

287
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,512
What he wants?

288
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,547
What about what I want?

289
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,617
He's a baby,
for Christ's sake.

290
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,185
Don't put yourself
on his level.

291
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,521
Rise above it.

292
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,128
Come on, man,
let's go get in the pile.

293
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,130
Ah...

294
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,565
It's the same
old pile, Seth.

295
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,470
Well, shit,
I'm going to go get knee-deep in it, son.

296
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,173
Go ahead, partner.

297
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,474
See you tomorrow.
Yep.

298
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,387
Hi.
Hello.

299
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,656
I'm glad to see that
you're still alive.

300
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,525
Thanks for letting me run like hell.
Uh-huh.

301
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,496
It's too bad I don't take my own advice.
Yeah.

302
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,131
Can I come in?

303
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,602
Yeah.

304
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,273
Thank you.
You're welcome.

305
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,314
Can I get you a drink?

306
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,548
Yeah, you got
any whiskey?

307
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:10,750
I only have milk.

308
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,387
Yeah, I love milk.
Good.

309
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,495
Nice place you got here.
- Oh, thanks.

310
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,402
Are you married?

311
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:30,737
Was.
Mmm.

312
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,306
Yeah, so was I.

313
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,675
Do you work?

314
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,676
No.

315
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,747
What's this, alimony?

316
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,649
No.

317
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:44,651
Oh.

318
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,525
You talk a lot, don't you?

319
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,460
No.

320
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:55,462
Hmm.

321
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,602
You look terrible.

322
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,473
Thanks. That really
builds up my confidence.

323
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,346
Why did you go to
that party, anyhow?

324
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,681
I don't know.
I thought it would be fun.

325
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,784
Obviously
I made a mistake.

326
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,252
Hmm.

327
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,694
I'm tired.
I'm really tired.

328
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:31,998
I'm sorry.
I was lonely.

329
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,766
I just needed
someone to talk to.

330
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,772
Well, you can't sleep here.

331
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,975
Oh, thanks for
letting me sleep here.

332
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,578
I said you can't
sleep here.

333
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:49,716
Hello?

334
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,288
Oh, shit.

335
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,431
Hi, Peggy.
Hi, Phil.

336
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:12,532
Yeah, I've got
a meeting with B.A.

337
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,567
Yeah, just a minute.
All right.

338
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,373
Phil Elliott's here.

339
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,591
You know, Phil,
there's not one damn corporation I own

340
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,460
that means as much
to me right here

341
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,395
as my football team.

342
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,399
Come on.

343
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,871
That was a hell
of a catch on Sunday.

344
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,640
That's just, uh, luck.

345
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:56,543
You know, Phil,

346
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,445
there's one thing
I learned early on in life.

347
00:22:58,478 --> 00:22:59,912
The most important thing
a man can have.

348
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,415
Um, what's that? Money?

349
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,451
Luck.

350
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,986
Luck tells me something
about a man.

351
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,757
You know, if my people are lucky,
they tap into a big field.

352
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,426
If they're not,
they can have every geology degree in the world

353
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,528
and drill one dry duster
right after another.

354
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,530
Take me.

355
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,965
I'm the luckiest man
in the world.

356
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,167
Sure as hell
ain't brains, is it?

357
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:26,539
You know, Phil,
there's always a place in our little family

358
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,774
for the right kind of man.

359
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,409
Mmm-hmm.

360
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,446
Now, Phil...

361
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,550
People who confuse
brains and luck

362
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,551
can get in a whole
lot of trouble.

363
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,688
Seeing through the game is not the same as winning the game.

364
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,472
Now to me, see,
it's gotten to a point

365
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:00,640
where Phil's
almost predictable.

366
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,509
I can know what
he's going to do...

367
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,945
Hey, Phil, how are you doing?
Hey, Emmett.

368
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,547
Uh, B.A.,
I'm sorry I'm late.

369
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,081
Uh, listen,
I was just thinking.

370
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,050
Why don't you all just stay here in my office and use it?

371
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,753
I got to see Connie anyway for a minute, okay?
Okay. Yeah.

372
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,555
Thank you very much,
Emmett. Well, see you.

373
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:16,723
See you later, Phil.

374
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:17,624
Mmm-hmm.

375
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,059
Sit down.
Sit down.

376
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,660
Now, that's it,
that's it, Phil.

377
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,862
That's what it all boils down
to is your attitude.

378
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,700
And another thing,
I know that you don't like sitting on the bench.

379
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,770
But you're a team member.
You have to adjust to that.

380
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,238
Actually, I have
known players

381
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,207
that got used to sitting on the bench,
if that's possible.

382
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,508
It's not.

383
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:11,978
You're too proud?

384
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:15,982
I want you to listen
to something.

385
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,918
The Apostle Paul,

386
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,287
in one of his letters
to the Corinthians

387
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,592
said, "When I was a child,
I thought as a child. I spake as a child.

388
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,694
"I understood
as a child,

389
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,562
"but when I came
to be a man,

390
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:31,564
"I put away
childish things."

391
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,834
Hmm.

392
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,204
And there's a theme that runs through all this data, Phil.

393
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,306
It's immaturity,
your immaturity.

394
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,908
You lack seriousness.

395
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,044
Well, I scored five TDs
coming off the bench.

396
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,212
That's pretty serious.

397
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:48,948
You scored five TDs?

398
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,183
Don't you know that
we worked for those?

399
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,921
We plan for them.
We let you score those touchdowns.

400
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,824
B.A., I've always
given you 100 %.

401
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,125
100 %!

402
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,295
You're talking about
individual effort.

403
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,732
Yes, you do give that.
I don't deny it.

404
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,066
But that's not what
I'm talking about.

405
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,801
I'm talking about a team.

406
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:10,569
I'm talking about
a winning team.

407
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,874
A winning team is 45
finely meshed gears

408
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,343
working together
in perfect synchronization.

409
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,679
If one of those gears flies off on its own,
I pull it.

410
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,684
And if that's
not straight enough,

411
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:25,885
I'll say it
in a different way.

412
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,722
If you want to play football
for me, Mr. Elliott,

413
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,991
you have to change,
starting right now.

414
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:39,165
B.A., I'm sorry if my immaturity has offended you,

415
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:40,800
and I'll honestly
try to change.

416
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:44,804
But I've been
a starter for six years,

417
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,039
and it's hard to sit
on the bench, but...

418
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,176
I'll wait my chance.

419
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:53,880
And when you do start me,

420
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:57,083
I'll make you glad you did.

421
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,154
I appreciate that, Phil.

422
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,658
Then we'll see.

423
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,230
Hey, Phil,
how are you doing?

424
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,065
Hey, you know Joanne Rodney,
don't you? Phil Elliott.

425
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,734
Yeah.

426
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,669
Oh, my gosh.
Wait a minute. What?

427
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,137
Ruth, you got that contract?
- Oh, yes, sir.

428
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,706
I want you to see this.
This is something

429
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:20,840
I'd like you to be
interested in.

430
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:23,375
A little contract here for our number one draft choice,

431
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,944
wide receiver
out of Lubbock.

432
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,679
Lubbock. Yeah.
A real good one here.

433
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,881
So, I, uh...

434
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:30,683
Gosh, I guess next year
this means you'll be...

435
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:34,420
Do you speak
Canadian at all?

436
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:38,290
Emmett, you've been running these guys at me for years.

437
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,759
Yeah.

438
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:52,905
Come on.

439
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,853
Oh, God damn it, Joanne.

440
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:10,790
Oh, wait... Ow!
God, that's my sore shoulder. Jesus.

441
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,458
Which one?
That one.

442
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,960
The one you always hurt.

443
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,164
Oh, Jesus, my knee.

444
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:20,900
Your left knee?

445
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,334
No. What do you mean,
my left knee?

446
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,836
You wouldn't know...
You know...

447
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:26,806
Ah! Phil.

448
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,507
What do you mean, "Phil"?

449
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,242
Come on now.
Ow, ow!

450
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:31,844
Come on.
Ow...

451
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,479
Oh, God.

452
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:34,947
You always hurt me, Jo.

453
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,252
Oh...

454
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:59,305
B.A. wants me to adjust
to sitting on the bench.

455
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,775
Hell, I'll die on the bench.

456
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,913
What's the sense of the team winning if I don't survive, huh?

457
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,882
You'll survive.

458
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:12,018
Really?

459
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,320
You know what I'd do?

460
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:19,091
I'd pull for the other team
so we'll get behind

461
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,893
and B.A. will have
to put me in.

462
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,761
That's weird.

463
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,166
Why don't you just quit?

464
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,875
Well, what would I do that wouldn't be the same or worse?

465
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:38,911
Besides, it's the only thing
I know how to do good.

466
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,813
It's the best hands
in the league, you know?

467
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,058
Phil, do you love me?

468
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,165
Sort of.

469
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,172
What kind of
an answer is that?

470
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,941
Well...

471
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:12,311
It's the only kind of answer I know how to give

472
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:15,848
when somebody I really like
needs to know the truth.

473
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,930
Hey, how long
you been awake?

474
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,200
Couldn't sleep.

475
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,015
You know,
you don't look too good.

476
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:51,017
Maybe you ought to take
some vitamins.

477
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,953
I don't need
a healthy body.

478
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,922
I can do it all
in my mind.

479
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:58,124
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

480
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:00,226
I've been ignoring the fact that I'm falling apart.

481
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,630
Say, Joanne...
Mmm-hmm.

482
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,999
Where's the pictures
of yourself you cut out?

483
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,069
Hmm?

484
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:13,039
Well, that girl just doesn't exist anymore, Phil.

485
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:16,075
Oh, so Joanne Rodney
doesn't exist anymore.

486
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,446
Well, in that case,
it kind of looks like you.

487
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,653
Uh, what do you want
for breakfast?

488
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,989
Well, I'm going to have
whatever you're having.

489
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,457
Well, I'm having
chocolate pudding.

490
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,459
Uh, wait a minute,
Joanne.

491
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,627
Uh, wait a minute.

492
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,997
Listen, how about some
bacon and eggs?

493
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,398
Don't have any bacon.
How about some eggs?

494
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,532
Nope.

495
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:43,002
Toast?
Ah! No butter.

496
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,671
No butter.
Dry toast or chocolate pudding.

497
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,139
Well, I'm going to have
chocolate pudding, then.

498
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,275
Mmm, I only have one.

499
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,344
But I'll share it
with you.

500
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,180
Oh, really?
Well, it's a great meal, then.

501
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:55,314
Let's go.
All right.

502
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,925
Come on, feed me.

503
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,232
Well, I'm going to do it.

504
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,401
Good, give me some more.

505
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,537
No, seriously.
I'm really going to do it.

506
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,938
Do what?

507
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,210
Marry Emmett Hunter.

508
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,679
Come on, Joanne.

509
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:29,748
What do you want to marry Emmett for?
He's nothing.

510
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,417
He's just going to
screw up your life.

511
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:36,222
When I told him I wanted to keep the apartment,
he said I could.

512
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,258
You'll come by and see me,
won't you?

513
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,298
If I can.

514
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,335
Oh, get real.

515
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,032
Mmm...
Hey, cheer up.

516
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,401
Everybody gets married
now and then.

517
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:27,239
Yeah, but I thought you'd draw the line at joining the family.

518
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,209
Yeah, me too.

519
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,010
Mmm-hmm.

520
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,380
But look at it like this...

521
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:37,449
With me in
the Hunter family,

522
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:39,351
you won't have to learn
to speak Canadian.

523
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,155
Phew!

524
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,077
We boring you, Douglas?

525
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,080
You fall asleep again,
it's $100 fine.

526
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,318
Okay, third and eight.

527
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:16,522
All right! All right!

528
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,260
The things I do for love.

529
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,529
No. No, shit.
You should never have thrown to Elliott

530
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,696
with that kind
of coverage.

531
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,165
Look at Delma,
look at him there.

532
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,333
He's wide open.

533
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,170
I don't like
this buddy-buddy stuff

534
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:32,438
interfering with
my judgment.

535
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,342
Shit, you can't win
for losing around here.

536
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,155
Run it back,
run it back.

537
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:05,103
That's it, Stallings.
Real good.

538
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,706
Stallings, what were you
thinking of here?

539
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,110
I'm... I'm not sure, sir.

540
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:13,645
You're not sure.

541
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,415
No, sir.

542
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,884
The entire game riding
on this one series of downs,

543
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,719
and we have a player
who's not sure.

544
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:24,590
There's no room in this business for uncertainty.

545
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:28,527
No room.

546
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:39,771
Oh, shit, here it comes.

547
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,273
Here's where you
screwed up.

548
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,242
I didn't screw up.
You changed the play.

549
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,910
You changed the play.
I didn't change the play.

550
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,745
You brought it in there.
I did not.

551
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,280
Well, just cover for me.

552
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,186
I'd like all of you to watch this next play carefully.

553
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,788
Especially you.

554
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,257
Especially you,
Elliott.

555
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,299
Oh, man.
Oh, here it is.

556
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,934
Great catch.
Great catch.

557
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,569
Yeah! All right!

558
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,274
Whoo! All right!

559
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,281
Now, Elliott,

560
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:24,316
how would you
describe this play?

561
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,456
Well...

562
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,792
I'd say we scored
a touchdown.

563
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,597
Oh, you think it's funny?

564
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,668
Well, I fail to see
any humor at all.

565
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,405
Maxwell changed the play
that I sent in,

566
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,474
Elliott broke his pattern,

567
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,476
and the catch
was a fluke.

568
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:54,313
There's no room for flukes
in winning game plans.

569
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,450
Why do you think that we go over and over

570
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:00,552
the printouts
of a game plan?

571
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,354
Because deviating
from that plan

572
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,290
can cost us a championship.

573
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:05,791
Now, if there's
some of you

574
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,493
not interested
in being champions,

575
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,495
why, then, you laugh.

576
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,830
Relax. Have a good time.

577
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,333
But you'll do it on somebody else's football team,

578
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:15,834
not mine.

579
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:19,838
The key to being
a professional

580
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:21,773
is consistency,

581
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,277
and the computer
measures that quality.

582
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:27,279
No one of you is as good as that computer.

583
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,815
I hope I'm understood.

584
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:36,455
Now, everybody
on the bus in 10 minutes.

585
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,724
Ah, except you, Stallings.

586
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,659
I'd like a word with you
in private, please.

587
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,330
All right, come on,
let's move.

588
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:45,664
Get your gear together.

589
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,314
Hey, let me have
those shoes.

590
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,615
That's cold, man.
Hey, baby.

591
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,753
Do you believe
they cut Stallings?

592
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,655
Who's Stallings?

593
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,693
Runners run past 49 right.

594
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:15,561
Sounds real boring.

595
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,062
Look at it.
All right, I'm looking.

596
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:18,630
Got it?
Got it. Yeah, man.

597
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,566
On two. Ready?
Break! Move.

598
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:25,303
4-3, number two zone. Ready?
- Break!

599
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,973
Strong left!
- Left!

600
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:28,940
Right back swing guy.
I got it. I got it.

601
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,709
Set... Hike!

602
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,678
Come on, you...

603
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,313
Pass! Coming in!
Coming in!

604
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:36,615
Coming in!

605
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:41,587
Whoo!

606
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,893
Douglas, the reason
we drafted you

607
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,728
was because they said
you were fast and smart.

608
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,097
At this point,
I'd be delighted

609
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,064
if you'd be at least
one of those things!

610
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:54,433
Yes, sir.

611
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,134
Carney, get in here
for Douglas.

612
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,135
Huddle up, huddle up.
Let's go.

613
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,604
Back in the huddle!

614
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,576
Hey, Douglas,

615
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,611
isn't this the kind of day

616
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,846
you'd rather be by a fire with a good book?

617
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:09,715
Fuck you, faggot.

618
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,384
Promises, promises.

619
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,125
Pass! Stop.

620
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,427
All right.

621
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,102
How's an old fart like me
supposed to keep up

622
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,705
with a dedicated young Christian stud like Hartman?

623
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,742
It's discouraging.

624
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,710
Well, it's like you
told me, Seth...

625
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:39,711
You got to cheat.

626
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,848
I wrote the book on that.
I believe that.

627
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,986
Elliott!
Get your ass in here!

628
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:50,756
Coming, boss.

629
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,426
Red, right, 74.

630
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:57,395
You're going to get
yourself a fine, Jo Bob.

631
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,931
It's worth it.

632
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:00,966
You got it?
Yes, sir.

633
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,902
On three. Ready?
- Break!

634
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,905
Round left, round left.

635
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:10,041
Check!

636
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,076
Check.
Cover 2, cover 2.

637
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:13,745
2-49! 2-49!

638
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:17,048
Check! 2-76!

639
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,817
2-76!

640
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,819
Hut! Hut!

641
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,821
Hut!

642
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,526
Ow!
Whoo!

643
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,895
Oh, God damn it!
God damn it! You all right?

644
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,463
Ah!
- Here, hold it.

645
00:40:31,497 --> 00:40:33,532
Oh, God damn it!

646
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,166
Pull them out.
Jesus Christ.

647
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,201
Don't move,
don't move.

648
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,202
Pull it!

649
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:40,739
You all right?

650
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:52,584
Which one?
Christ, which do you think?

651
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,920
Elliott!

652
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,688
That's what comes
from not concentrating.

653
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,691
Yes, sir.

654
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,727
Amazed at how these
young fellows

655
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,595
can take the punishment
of their profession.

656
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,230
Hello, Monsignor.

657
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,232
Oh, hello, Phil.

658
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:09,568
You're a very brave
young man.

659
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,237
That's real devotion.

660
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:16,074
You remind me of the magnificent missionaries of history.

661
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,579
Never thought
of that, Monsignor.

662
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,949
Come on, Elliott,
stop dogging it!

663
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:24,983
That's fine.

664
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:30,221
All right,
I want you to run this here Chicago pass pattern.

665
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:31,857
Red-right-74.

666
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:32,891
Look at it.

667
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,960
All right, here we go.
Here we go. On two, on two.

668
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,261
Ready? Break!

669
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:37,763
Come on, snap it up!

670
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,731
Elliott, get in there!

671
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,537
Left!

672
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:48,740
Set!

673
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,576
Red-left, red-left.
Hold it!

674
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,611
Carney, get in there!

675
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:53,945
No!

676
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,514
Put Douglas in, please.

677
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:58,984
Carney, get the hell
out of there!

678
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,788
Let's go. Here we go.
Come on.

679
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,124
Set!

680
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:10,629
Set!

681
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,532
2-75!

682
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,602
2-75!

683
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,870
Check!

684
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:20,672
2-72!

685
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:24,309
Hartman, Hartman, let's just
get the ball snapped!

686
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,044
You're giving me
a fucking headache!

687
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:27,312
- Rookies.
- Down.

688
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,881
All right, let's go.

689
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:31,049
A bunch
of high schools.

690
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:32,150
Set!

691
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:35,921
Hut! Hut!

692
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,237
Are you all right, man?

693
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,839
Hey, Phil,
you all right?

694
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,577
You okay?

695
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:03,849
Yeah, I'm all right.

696
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,984
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

697
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:08,119
Help me up.

698
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,090
There's your hat, man.

699
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,024
Nice catch.
Yeah.

700
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:17,863
Now, that's
concentration, Elliott.

701
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,139
Feels pretty swollen.

702
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,642
Let's work that knee.

703
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,982
God damn it, Eddie,
it's not the knee.

704
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:40,285
Hey, it's my shoulder.
I hit my shoulder when I hit the gym floor.

705
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,452
It feels like
it's full of gravel.

706
00:43:41,486 --> 00:43:43,855
Well, it's always felt like it was full of gravel.

707
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:46,391
Now, come on. Give me a B-12 shot.
That's what I want.

708
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:47,926
Always messing
with my knee.

709
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,028
How you doing, baby?

710
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,763
All right, Del.
You going to get a shot?

711
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:53,364
Oh. No shots
for me, turkey.

712
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:55,233
I can't stand needles.

713
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:58,003
Hey, you got to master
the technology of this game.

714
00:43:58,036 --> 00:44:01,272
Phil, how do you do that?
Take all those pills and shots, man.

715
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,775
Does terrible things
to your body. God!

716
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:06,177
If you last long enough,
you'll realize the only way to survive

717
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,679
is the pills and the shots.

718
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,414
Not me, turkey.

719
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,082
I got respect
for my body.

720
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,285
You'll get past that.

721
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,821
You're crazy, too.

722
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:17,956
Eddie,
I'd appreciate it

723
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,424
if you could finish up
here with butterfingers

724
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:22,794
and give me my B-12 shot 'cause I got an important business meeting.

725
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:24,996
You might like to know,
Elliott,

726
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:27,332
that I found myself two old boys from Oklahoma

727
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:28,900
who wanna invest in my
restaurant business.

728
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:30,335
Oklahoma?
That's right.

729
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:31,903
That figures.

730
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,306
You see, once the first
one starts making money,

731
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,008
then you sell franchises.

732
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:38,777
And that's where
the big money is.

733
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,078
Oh, yeah. What are you gonna
call the restaurants?

734
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:44,916
Jo Bob's Fine Foods.
Do you like it?

735
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,785
Jo bob's...
That's right.

736
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,954
Jo Bob's Fine Foods.
Right!

737
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:50,321
Eat here,
or I'll kill you.

738
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:53,058
You son of a bitch.

739
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:54,325
Hey! Come on! Hold it!

740
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,327
Jo bob, we're not gonna have trouble in here,
I mean it.

741
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,397
Get over to your meeting!

742
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,199
Jo Bob, you go on
to your meeting now!

743
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,102
You goddamn bird turd!

744
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:06,171
Jo Bob, you get out of here,
or I'll report you to B.A.

745
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:08,373
You would?

746
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,275
You bet your ass.
You're chicken shit.

747
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:16,081
Get out of my face,
Monroe.

748
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:20,185
It always did
take two of you

749
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,753
to hold one of me.

750
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,822
Excuse me.

751
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:26,157
Too damn much B-12.

752
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,006
Back off, asshole.
I ain't moving!

753
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,241
Back off!
I ain't moving!

754
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,844
Jesus God almighty!

755
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,113
Damn! Shit!

756
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:57,215
God!

757
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:59,918
It's the tooth fairy.

758
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:01,119
Fuck you, tooth fairy.

759
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:06,124
Holy shit,
I hope I don't look as bad as you look, man.

760
00:47:09,094 --> 00:47:11,229
You make me look
like Cinderella, asshole.

761
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:13,331
If I had a dog like you,

762
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:16,167
I'd shave his butt and
make him walk backwards.

763
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:19,537
Hey, old doc Elliott's
gonna take care of us.

764
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,940
It's time to break into the old medicine cabinet, Seth, boy.

765
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:23,975
How's your elbow?
God damn it, Elliott.

766
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:27,212
You know, Eddie's gonna
get your ass for this.

767
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:29,280
Hell, he didn't even
do nothing to you.

768
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:31,216
Hell, I ain't the one
that's doing it.

769
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:33,218
Yeah, but you're gonna take some.
That makes you an accomplice.

770
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:36,154
They turn me in, they gotta turn you in,
and they won't do that.

771
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,455
That's 'cause I'm a star.

772
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:41,259
A genuine
sports personality

773
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:44,162
and legendary folk hero.

774
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,663
Folk hero,
have some dexedrine.

775
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,099
Don't mind if I do.
A little compazine.

776
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:50,035
All right.
Would you like codeine?

777
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:51,402
Does a shark
shit in the sea?

778
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:52,870
Come on, give me
some of this.

779
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,941
One for me.

780
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:58,009
Whoops. Breakfast
of champions there.

781
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:01,980
Ah...

782
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:03,881
Nectar of the gods.
Yes.

783
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:10,255
You know something?

784
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:14,492
You're the only guy I know that's got an uglier body than mine.

785
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:16,227
That's bullshit.

786
00:48:19,164 --> 00:48:21,967
John Henry, why do we
abuse ourselves this way?

787
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,302
Hey, Seth...

788
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:28,439
Have you... Have you
ever loved anybody?

789
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:29,975
You know, loved somebody.

790
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,313
Aw, last night.

791
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:37,215
All-time showstopper, son.

792
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,449
I don't want
to hear this.

793
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:40,385
All-time showstopper.

794
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,987
I don't want to hear it.

795
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,289
You know Jerry Drake?
Drake?

796
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:46,992
Big tex automotive supply?
Oh, I know that asshole, yeah.

797
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:49,194
Well, it was his YMCA team

798
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:51,329
that me and Hartman
had to talk to last night.

799
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:54,565
I gave them my usual
bullshit, you know,

800
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,368
football, character
development, all that crap.

801
00:48:57,402 --> 00:49:00,171
Hartman comes up
with this story

802
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:02,240
about Jesus being captain
of a football team.

803
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,245
And the apostles each played
different positions, right?

804
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:09,280
Whoo!

805
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:12,050
And Judas was the coach.
Nope, Judas was the one

806
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:14,319
that sold the playbook
to the devil's team.

807
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,087
Oh, my God.

808
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:19,124
Now, wait till you
hear this part.

809
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:23,094
Afterwards, Drake invites me and Hartman up to his house for a drink.

810
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:25,596
Now, I got the wheels,

811
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,198
so Hartman's stuck
with me, right?

812
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:32,303
Anyway,
here's the point.

813
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:35,306
It turns out
Drake wants to watch

814
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,608
while me and Hartman
do nasty things

815
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:38,976
to his bouncy-bottomed
little wife.

816
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,613
Aw, Maxwell. Really.

817
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:45,283
Hey, I know, I know.
It's not your type of thing.

818
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,752
But I happen to be
more of a philosopher.

819
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:49,387
I like to mingle
with the little people.

820
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:51,322
What about Hartman?

821
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:54,392
Well, you know Hartman.
Goody-two-shoes just fidgeting around

822
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:57,495
like a one-legged cat trying to bury shit on a frozen pond,

823
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:01,432
until old Seth fixes him a couple of pink poontang specials.

824
00:50:01,466 --> 00:50:04,369
You know,
that crazy tourist drink that I fix for stewardesses?

825
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:06,104
Two shots out of that,

826
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:08,473
and Hartman is shot
to shit, freaked out.

827
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,309
I mean, I never saw a guy
having so much fun

828
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,178
and crying
at the same time.

829
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:15,713
I don't believe a word it,
but I'm getting horny.

830
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,783
Aha. Now wait till
you get to this part.

831
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:21,652
Drake now takes out a bunch
of them fake dicks...

832
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,654
Ah, Max, that's gross!

833
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,756
It's not gross.

834
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,459
Shit, gross is when you go and kiss your grandpa good night,

835
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,428
and he sticks his tongue down your throat.
That's gross.

836
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:35,800
Anyway, he's got one, man,
that is about 8 inches long, and it's pink,

837
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,535
and it's got little
crinkleties in it,

838
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,670
and it's got a grinder
that you turn like this,

839
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,072
and it goes in and out...

840
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:44,342
Oh, I don't wanna hear any of this.
I don't wanna hear no more of this.

841
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,244
Wait, man. I'm just
getting to the weird part.

842
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:48,113
The weird part?
The weird part?

843
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:49,747
Yeah, it gets weird.

844
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,349
Okay, who did it?
He did it.

845
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:54,519
Is that right, Seth?
Did what?

846
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:55,820
The medicine cabinet!

847
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:58,456
If B.A. finds out about it,
it's gonna be somebody's ass.

848
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:02,427
Your water's too hot.
Hey, Eddie, calm down.

849
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,828
The poor man here
was desperate.

850
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,029
Think of it as an emergency.

851
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,832
Yeah, and I suppose you just stood there and watched.

852
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:10,235
No, he held me down,
massaged my throat,

853
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:12,170
and made me swallow 'em.

854
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:13,538
Listen, this shit
has got to stop.

855
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:18,276
And leave my goddamn
beer alone!

856
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:22,447
And, Elliott,
don't you piss in there!

857
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:27,652
Ah.

858
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,155
Bastard.

859
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:43,694
Did I call my wife
last night?

860
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,231
I don't
think so, son.

861
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:47,665
Oh...

862
00:52:50,568 --> 00:52:53,238
What do I tell her? Hey, Art,
tell her that you escaped,

863
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:54,239
and you don't have
to pay the ransom.

864
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:55,506
I can't tell her that.

865
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:59,510
Look, son,
listen up to me, man.

866
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:02,747
Dream up the wildest thing you can think of,
and lay it on her.

867
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,216
I guarantee she'll go
for it, coming from you.

868
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,452
Yeah?
I'm right.

869
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,455
Why do I smell
like strawberries?

870
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:19,764
What'd you do
last night, poot?

871
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,373
Come on,
what'd you do?

872
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:30,575
Well, I'll tell you.

873
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:33,711
I had a date
with Charlotte.

874
00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,613
Oh, shit, man.

875
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:37,882
I hope you're not getting hooked on that chick.

876
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,450
Breaks your
concentration.

877
00:53:39,484 --> 00:53:41,719
Well, I'll tell you
something, old buddy.

878
00:53:41,752 --> 00:53:44,622
The only thing I haven't broken is my concentration.

879
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:48,426
Why do we do it,
partner?

880
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:50,728
Well, the only way
to find that out, man,

881
00:53:50,761 --> 00:53:51,829
is to quit.

882
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:55,433
You're not thinking
about quitting.

883
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:59,637
I'm thinking I'm tired
of beating myself up.

884
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:03,274
Don't worry.

885
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:04,275
You'll get tired
of thinking.

886
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,953
Coca-Cola, poot.

887
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,255
Hey, Seth, Seth.
Throw me an RC, Seth.

888
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:21,392
Ooh!

889
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:31,702
Seth...

890
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:34,339
She believed me.
Well, of course she believed you, Art.

891
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:35,773
Who wouldn't believe
you, partner?

892
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,543
Yeah, but I'm...
You did the right thing, son.

893
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:40,411
Lying can be really good
for a relationship.

894
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,323
Hey, Art.

895
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:53,558
Welcome to
the big leagues.

896
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:00,631
You know, I'm beginning
to like the pain.

897
00:55:00,665 --> 00:55:01,832
Huh?

898
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,669
Remember when
I busted my elbow?

899
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:05,670
Oh, yeah.

900
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,442
I knew it was dislocated the second it happened, man.

901
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,880
But when I was laying there, yelling,
flopping all over the field

902
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:17,482
in front of all
those people,

903
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:19,817
you know
what I felt?

904
00:55:20,585 --> 00:55:21,952
Oh.

905
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,721
Satisfaction.

906
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:29,794
Yeah. I mean,

907
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,962
it made me feel like I was doing something important,
you know?

908
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:33,831
Yeah.

909
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:35,466
When the pain
got the worst,

910
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:37,802
that's when I felt
the most...

911
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,772
Secure.
Yeah.

912
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,375
I hear you, I hear you.

913
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,480
The answer is no.

914
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:51,882
No, what?

915
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:54,752
I ain't never
loved nobody.

916
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:33,624
Oh!

917
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:51,642
Oh, God.

918
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:26,771
Good morning.

919
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,540
Good morning.

920
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:31,609
Did you sleep well?

921
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:36,914
Yeah, I slept great.

922
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,668
Settle down
and listen up.

923
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,805
I want some asses
kicked this week.

924
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:04,008
Douglas, that's $100
fine for being late.

925
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:08,913
I want you guys to study
the Chicago team tendencies.

926
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:11,982
If you ain't ready
by Monday night,

927
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:13,951
they're gonna run down your throats and out your assholes.

928
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:14,885
Ooh!

929
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:18,689
Oh, yeah, and there'll be
a written test on Friday

930
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:19,924
on these tendencies.

931
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,161
Coach.

932
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:32,336
Those of you whose names appeared on the bulletin board

933
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:34,639
are invited to Mr. Hunter's
home tomorrow

934
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,609
to help Conrad, Jr.
celebrate his birthday.

935
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:39,944
Be there at 12:00 sharp,

936
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:41,679
appropriately dressed.

937
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:48,018
Now, before we break
into our separate groups,

938
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:50,955
there are a few general comments
which I am obliged to make, gentlemen.

939
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:55,125
We won a game Sunday

940
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:58,629
against an opponent measurably and on paper inferior to ours.

941
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:01,031
In doing so,

942
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:04,068
we managed to play
far below our potential.

943
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:07,772
Our punting team gave
them 4.5 yards per kick,

944
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:09,974
more than our
reasonable goal,

945
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,777
and 9.9 yards more
than outstanding.

946
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:14,812
That's not the kind
of football

947
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:16,613
that conference
champions play.

948
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:20,885
Offense, four turnovers.

949
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:24,088
Five scoring
opportunities blown.

950
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:30,260
Third down conversions,
we failed six times more than our seasonal average.

951
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:32,629
Pass completions were 49 %.

952
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,102
That's 6.3 % less
than reasonable,

953
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,005
and it's 19 % less
than our outstanding.

954
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:47,044
That is a negative
19 % against Seattle!

955
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,717
Now, clearly,
it's time for us

956
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,919
to take a long,
hard look at ourselves,

957
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,924
and in this connection,
Coach Johnson has prepared some material

958
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,926
which I trust will be
beneficial to you.

959
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:05,195
Johnson.

960
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:07,031
Thank you, Coach.

961
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:09,033
Now, listen, you guys,

962
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,738
if we can take an extra moment here,
I'd like to read something that

963
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,039
B.A. thinks
is pretty important.

964
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:18,976
Now, when I was playing
college ball at Maryland,

965
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:22,813
I found this
taped to a locker.

966
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:27,117
I think you'll understand
what it means.

967
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:29,153
It means he's out
of his fucking mind.

968
01:01:30,755 --> 01:01:33,123
It means that the difference
between good and great

969
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:35,926
is that much.

970
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,796
It's the same size
as his pecker.

971
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,164
It comes
from right up here.

972
01:01:41,966 --> 01:01:43,300
Something wrong, Elliott?

973
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,301
No.

974
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:48,705
No, sir,
I just have something caught in my throat.

975
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,744
I can't think of anyone that can use this advice better than you can.

976
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,984
Yes, sir.

977
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,224
Excuse me, Coach Johnson.

978
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:09,760
Thank you.

979
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,801
"If you think
you can't win, you won't."

980
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:19,436
Right.

981
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,005
"If you think
you're losing,

982
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,909
"you've lost."
All right!

983
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,911
"If you refuse
to strive to the limit,

984
01:02:26,944 --> 01:02:28,345
"the limit's as far
as you'll go."

985
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:30,915
That's right, sir.
"If you give in to the fear and pain..."

986
01:02:30,948 --> 01:02:32,449
Talk about the pain.

987
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:36,020
Oh, why don't you shut up, Delma?
This ain't exactly no revival meeting.

988
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,024
Do you want something
with me, Monroe?

989
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:43,160
All right, cut it out,
you guys!

990
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,930
I'm sorry, Coach.

991
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:49,766
I couldn't...
Go ahead, sir.

992
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,141
"If you give in
to the fear and pain,

993
01:02:57,174 --> 01:02:59,143
"there are thrills
you'll never know."

994
01:02:59,176 --> 01:02:59,944
That's right.

995
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:05,415
"We have all been
put here by God

996
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,284
"as a test of our
courage and faith.

997
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:11,788
"The rewards to his
warriors are many.

998
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:16,326
"The rewards to
the losers, disgrace.

999
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:20,597
"Some say winning's
not everything,

1000
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,067
"that competition
has a limited place.

1001
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,837
"But if that cowardly
slogan is true,

1002
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:29,339
"why did God name this

1003
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,076
"the human race?"

1004
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,880
Good question.

1005
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,183
Coach, would it be okay

1006
01:03:39,216 --> 01:03:42,252
if Jo Bob and I had a couple copies of that poem?

1007
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:44,554
Yeah, we'd appreciate that,
Coach Johnson.

1008
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:47,457
That has to be one of the most inspiring poems I ever heard, sir.

1009
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:51,228
Yeah, I'd like one,
too, Coach.

1010
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,197
Yeah, me, too, Coach.

1011
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:54,364
Little brown nose.

1012
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:56,934
Pussy.

1013
01:03:56,967 --> 01:04:00,237
One, two, three, four,

1014
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,073
five, six, seven, eight,

1015
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:04,875
nine, ten.

1016
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,978
Hold it!

1017
01:04:09,914 --> 01:04:11,949
Now, we count during
this drill, Elliott,

1018
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:13,183
and you didn't count!

1019
01:04:14,018 --> 01:04:16,086
We're gonna do it
over again,

1020
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,588
and you can thank Elliott
for the extra work.

1021
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:21,125
Phil, Phil, Phil.

1022
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:28,232
All right,
knock that shit off! Let's go!

1023
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:30,134
All right, let's finish up
with 10 jumping jacks.

1024
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,002
Ready? Exercise.

1025
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:35,973
One, two,
three, four, five

1026
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:40,110
six, seven, eight,
nine, ten.

1027
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:44,181
All right, let's break
up into your groups.

1028
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,283
I wasn't really counting.
I was just moving my lips.

1029
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:48,118
You son of a bitch!

1030
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:49,886
Good practice.
Now, let's go.

1031
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,658
Let's go, Elliot.
Let's see if you can catch one.

1032
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:56,160
Look at Phil.
Come on.

1033
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,131
About time
you caught one.

1034
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:04,268
Scott, how are you?
Hey, Horace, how are you doing?

1035
01:05:04,301 --> 01:05:05,435
Hey, Emmett,
how are you? Hi, Horace.

1036
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:07,071
Thanks for inviting me.

1037
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:09,439
Yeah.
I was sorry to hear about your daddy.

1038
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:11,575
Well, thank you, Con.

1039
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:13,277
That's the only
fight he ever lost.

1040
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:17,047
When a man of your daddy's wealth dies of cancer,

1041
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:18,949
you know they haven't
found a cure.

1042
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:21,918
Let's go!

1043
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,055
Come on.
Come on, Delma.

1044
01:05:28,725 --> 01:05:31,228
Come on, I'll tell
you when you're hurt.

1045
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,030
Easy, easy, easy.
What is it? Hamstring.

1046
01:05:34,098 --> 01:05:36,967
Let's go. Come on.
It's my hamstring. Shit!

1047
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:39,369
Did you feel it tear?
No. I heard it pop.

1048
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:42,139
All right, take him inside.
Give me a hand.

1049
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:44,108
Easy.
I seen better hands on a clock.

1050
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:45,475
Let's go.
Oh, shit.

1051
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,313
Back to the tub
again, huh, Delma?

1052
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:57,254
All right, let's go to team drills,
Chicago defense.

1053
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,024
Elliott, get back
with the first unit.

1054
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:03,193
You know, if you were moving any slower,
you'd be going backwards.

1055
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:06,030
Very funny, Elliott.
Very funny.

1056
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:08,232
And just one more game,
and we take our division.

1057
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,468
That's what makes
it all worthwhile.

1058
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:15,239
Christ, Con,
you make more in your manufacturing division in one week

1059
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:17,574
than this goddamn football
team makes in one year,

1060
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,076
even if they do win.

1061
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:20,677
Well, that's true,

1062
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:25,215
but my manufacturing division never got the cover of Time magazine.

1063
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:27,617
I'm going all the way this year, Horace.
The big one.

1064
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:30,020
Super Bowl.
No question about it.

1065
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:33,023
And money ain't everything anyway, Horace.

1066
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:34,224
What are you talking about?

1067
01:06:34,258 --> 01:06:35,125
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

1068
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:36,493
Tell him, Emmett.

1069
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:42,099
It's either pulled or torn.
We'll know more tomorrow.

1070
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:43,467
Can you get him
ready for Monday?

1071
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:48,572
Set!

1072
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,808
Hut!

1073
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,211
All right. Next play.
Next play. Come on.

1074
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,180
Break it up.
Come on, Jo Bob. Shit!

1075
01:06:57,114 --> 01:06:59,116
Hang on,
hang on, Monroe.

1076
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:01,251
Give Jo Bob some work
in there. Full speed.

1077
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:08,258
3-22.

1078
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,427
3-22.

1079
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,397
Hut! Hut!

1080
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:19,169
You son of a bitch!

1081
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:22,406
Goddamn, Jo Bob,
is that how you're gonna hit on Alcie Weeks when we get to Chicago?

1082
01:07:22,439 --> 01:07:24,108
God damn it, Coach!

1083
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:25,809
We're supposed to be
doing this thing half speed!

1084
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:27,244
I don't wanna hear excuses,

1085
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:29,513
I just want you
to get results.

1086
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,216
Now, if you ain't ready,
we're just gonna tear off your head and crap in your neck.

1087
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:33,450
All right, same play.
Let's go!

1088
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:41,057
3-22.

1089
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:42,526
Asshole.

1090
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:44,594
3-22.

1091
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:47,631
Hut!

1092
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:51,701
Jo Bob, get your head
out of your ass!

1093
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,303
If you don't think you can do this drill...
Son of a bitch.

1094
01:07:53,337 --> 01:07:55,272
...we'll bring
it up to full speed.

1095
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:58,108
I know all your teammates
would love a live scrimmage.

1096
01:07:58,142 --> 01:08:00,577
Now let's do it again
and do it right!

1097
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,579
Get your fucking ass
back on the line, Marco.

1098
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,215
Fuck you, asshole.

1099
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,185
Come on, huddle up.

1100
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,821
You cocksucker.

1101
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:13,257
Your mama was
the best teacher.

1102
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:20,730
Ooh!
They're fired up now.

1103
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,499
Oh, yeah. They're
gonna ream Chicago.

1104
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:05,642
That's enough.

1105
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:09,279
Okay. Break it up.

1106
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:10,680
Break it up.
Come on.

1107
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,449
Break it up!

1108
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:14,918
Okay, okay.
- All right, gentlemen.

1109
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:16,220
All right.

1110
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:18,688
Everyone at the airport
at 10:00 a.m., tomorrow.

1111
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:21,391
All right,
we'll be ready.

1112
01:09:21,425 --> 01:09:23,460
Come on, good workout,
man, good workout.

1113
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:27,297
Elliott, I'd like to see you over here in a minute, please.

1114
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:37,574
Walk with me, Phil.

1115
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,445
How's the knee?

1116
01:09:41,478 --> 01:09:42,812
Oh, it's great.
Feels real good.

1117
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,548
You're limping.

1118
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:46,650
Yeah, well,
that's just habit, but, uh, feels good.

1119
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,518
Uh-huh.

1120
01:09:49,953 --> 01:09:52,689
Phil, I'm gonna
need you in Chicago.

1121
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:56,926
Delma's pulled
his hamstring again,

1122
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,328
and you know Delma.

1123
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,230
He can't stand pain.

1124
01:10:00,964 --> 01:10:02,599
He'll say
it hurts too much,

1125
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,735
but he doesn't like
to use the needles.

1126
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:08,738
So...

1127
01:10:12,476 --> 01:10:14,578
Can I count on you,
Phil, and your knee,

1128
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:16,480
for the entire game?

1129
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:30,460
B.A., you can always
count on me

1130
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:31,761
to do whatever
it takes to play.

1131
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:36,533
Hell, I love needles.

1132
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:45,475
I guess that's what
we call maturity.

1133
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:49,379
Huh?

1134
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:26,750
It's beautiful.

1135
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:28,418
Yeah, really...

1136
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:30,420
Really beautiful.

1137
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:34,491
Come on.
Let's go into the house.

1138
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:36,092
Okay.

1139
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,294
Into the living room.
Ah, through the wall.

1140
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:40,564
Yeah.

1141
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:42,832
All right. Now...

1142
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:46,436
Uh... Um...

1143
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:50,674
Uh... This is
as far as I've got.

1144
01:11:51,808 --> 01:11:53,577
How long did it
take you to get this far?

1145
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:57,514
Oh, about, uh...

1146
01:11:59,383 --> 01:12:00,684
Three years.

1147
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:09,092
Anyway, I got 20 acres,

1148
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,627
and it runs
along that gully,

1149
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,128
and it goes
back in that valley.

1150
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,697
Oh, God,
it's magnificent.

1151
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:16,566
Yeah, and that's where I'm gonna have the horses.

1152
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,767
I think you should
finish it, though.

1153
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:20,904
I am gonna finish it.

1154
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:49,466
Ta-da!

1155
01:12:49,499 --> 01:12:51,100
Made with my own
fair hands.

1156
01:12:51,134 --> 01:12:54,471
Oh, great.
I got the wine.

1157
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:56,640
I got the salad.
Okay. Excuse me.

1158
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,575
Well, excuse me.

1159
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:00,577
I need all
the room here.

1160
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,746
You've got
all the room. Ow.

1161
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:05,715
Listen, what are we
gonna do about napkins?

1162
01:13:05,749 --> 01:13:07,517
Here. Use toilet paper.
It's cheap.

1163
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,385
Oh, chic, chic.

1164
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:13,990
Listen, uh...

1165
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:20,897
Do you think this, uh,
raising horses is just a dream of mine?

1166
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,398
I don't know. Maybe.

1167
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,901
It doesn't seem
very real.

1168
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:25,869
Yeah?

1169
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:27,671
Come on.

1170
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:31,841
Hey, you like
burned steak?

1171
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:32,942
Oh.

1172
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:43,620
Hey, you know something?

1173
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:49,759
When I'm with you,
my mind's a million miles away from football.

1174
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,028
I feel free.

1175
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,431
Sounds like you're
tired of football.

1176
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:58,067
Well, if I was,
I wouldn't admit it.

1177
01:13:58,101 --> 01:13:59,603
That would scare
the hell out of me.

1178
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:01,671
Here, you want some wine?

1179
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:02,672
Yeah.

1180
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:08,077
I'm scared to death
most of the time anyhow.

1181
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:09,546
Scared of what?

1182
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:11,781
I don't know, of injury,
of playing badly,

1183
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:14,050
anything that can knock
me out of the game.

1184
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,218
You don't act like it.

1185
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:17,954
Yeah. I don't dare.

1186
01:14:20,857 --> 01:14:22,926
You know, someday
you will be out of it.

1187
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:23,993
Then what?

1188
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:27,597
Oh, come on, Charlotte,
that's serious. I'm having a nice...

1189
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:28,932
I don't want
to get into that.

1190
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:32,936
For Christ's sake, come on.
Let's don't talk about football.

1191
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:34,470
I'm gonna start Monday.

1192
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:36,840
Everything in
my life's just great.

1193
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:40,243
We got any butter?

1194
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:41,778
Well, I don't think
it's great.

1195
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:44,648
You know, I saw you
the other night.

1196
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:47,617
You were in so much pain
you couldn't sleep.

1197
01:14:49,753 --> 01:14:51,154
Your body's
twisted and scarred.

1198
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:52,856
You're drugging yourself.

1199
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:55,024
Hey, listen,
that's just part of the game, Charlotte.

1200
01:14:55,058 --> 01:14:56,760
Game?

1201
01:14:56,793 --> 01:14:58,928
You call men smashing
each other a game?

1202
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:00,496
Oh, for Christ's sake!

1203
01:15:00,897 --> 01:15:02,999
You can't judge!

1204
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:05,268
You live in a little house secure with your Texas money.

1205
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:06,870
What the hell
do you know about it?

1206
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:08,104
You live
in an unreal world!

1207
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:10,073
If football's the real world,
I don't want any part of it!

1208
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:11,007
It scares me.

1209
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:14,043
Well, good.
It's not your life.

1210
01:15:14,778 --> 01:15:15,879
It's mine.

1211
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:20,049
Come on, let's eat.

1212
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:29,626
Why don't you build your ranch instead of dreaming about it?

1213
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:31,895
Yeah, well, maybe I like
it better as a fantasy.

1214
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:33,997
The payments are lower.

1215
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,632
And you accuse me
of living in a dream world?

1216
01:15:35,665 --> 01:15:37,000
For Christ's sake,
Charlotte.

1217
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:39,302
Now, look, I got to keep
my mind in the game.

1218
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:40,770
I don't want
to get confused now,

1219
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:42,706
so drop it!

1220
01:16:04,828 --> 01:16:06,029
Why don't you
watch the game?

1221
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:10,700
I'll do something special
for you in Chicago.

1222
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,708
Hey, Eddie,
give me a match, will you?

1223
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:20,944
Hey, Phil,
what's happening?

1224
01:16:20,977 --> 01:16:22,979
What are you doing
here early, man?

1225
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:25,081
Oh, man, I got butterflies.
I couldn't sit around the hotel, man.

1226
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:25,949
I had to get out of there.

1227
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:30,186
Where in the hell
is Jo Bob and O.W.?

1228
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:33,222
I don't know, man.
They were in a cab right behind me.

1229
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:35,892
I done told you boys when you got special taping to do,

1230
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:38,094
you gotta get down
to the stadium early.

1231
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:40,664
Well, maybe I ought to start getting here the night before.

1232
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,800
Come on, Frank!
What are you doing?

1233
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,001
We got
an important ball game.

1234
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:46,836
You tape
my left ankle first.

1235
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:48,137
You trying to
put the hex on me?

1236
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:51,174
You old fart.

1237
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,042
I'll tape that knee
after the doctor checks it.

1238
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:54,043
Yeah.

1239
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:59,382
You don't look healthy at all.
Yeah, I know.

1240
01:16:59,415 --> 01:17:01,184
Yeah. I hurt myself.

1241
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:04,888
Catch you later.

1242
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:06,656
All right.
Have a good ball game.

1243
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:07,824
Yeah. You, too.

1244
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:31,180
Oh, yeah.

1245
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:58,808
Jo Bob,
this is it, babe.

1246
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:01,310
This is what we want.

1247
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,912
And what are we gonna do?

1248
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:05,048
We are gonna
kick their butts.

1249
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:07,016
What are we gonna do?
We know how to kick their butts.

1250
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,985
How are we gonna do it?
We're gonna do it very roughly.

1251
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:11,054
We're gonna do it.
No respect.

1252
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:12,822
We're gonna do it.

1253
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:14,457
We're gonna get 'em.
We're gonna get 'em. Yes. Yes.

1254
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,826
Weeks all there.
Weeks all there.

1255
01:18:17,994 --> 01:18:19,963
I mean Weeks now.
Where's my locker?

1256
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:21,831
Come on.
Get your junk on, babe.

1257
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:26,269
Ah. Hello, Phil.
What is it?

1258
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:28,838
It's the knee. Knee, huh?
Let's have a look.

1259
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,842
Tell me when.

1260
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:37,180
Uh... Ah-ha-ha-ha.

1261
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:39,849
"X" marks the spot.
Ow!

1262
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:42,852
Hey, baby, you gonna
make it tonight?

1263
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:44,487
I don't think so.

1264
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,955
We need you, man.

1265
01:18:45,989 --> 01:18:48,825
Yeah. Frank, can I
get this hot packed?

1266
01:18:49,258 --> 01:18:50,794
Yeah, you got it, babe.

1267
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:54,764
Hey, is this it?
Here?

1268
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:56,099
Yeah, that's it.

1269
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:57,166
Hold on.

1270
01:18:59,335 --> 01:19:00,736
Come on, Delma,
lift it up.

1271
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:04,373
No? Tell him.

1272
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:09,212
Okay.

1273
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:17,286
Okay, here we go then.

1274
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:24,060
Ooh, Jesus.

1275
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:28,364
No, wait.
Wait a second.

1276
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:31,300
Just wait a second.

1277
01:19:33,302 --> 01:19:36,172
Say when.
All right. Not yet.

1278
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:40,309
God damn it!
Jesus, it burns.

1279
01:19:43,246 --> 01:19:45,381
Goddamn.

1280
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,450
You won't feel a thing.
Christ, how often do you put this shit

1281
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,018
in the coaches' hearts?

1282
01:19:49,052 --> 01:19:50,153
Ah...

1283
01:19:51,054 --> 01:19:52,155
There.

1284
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:58,294
Now, that wasn't
bad, was it?

1285
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:00,163
Oh, no. I loved it.

1286
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:04,000
Stand on it now. Try it.

1287
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:08,938
How does it feel?

1288
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:11,140
Ah, it's numb.

1289
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:12,075
Good.
Good.

1290
01:20:12,108 --> 01:20:14,878
It's a brand-new
knee, Doc.

1291
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:16,812
Better football
through chemistry, huh?

1292
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:27,857
Hey, Delma,
using the heat, huh?

1293
01:20:27,891 --> 01:20:28,958
You must be
feeling better.

1294
01:20:30,093 --> 01:20:32,461
No, Coach,
it feels real bad.

1295
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:33,930
And I don't think
I can make it.

1296
01:20:33,963 --> 01:20:36,099
Ah, come on, Delma.
You saw Elliott.

1297
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,367
He was hurting, too,

1298
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:40,836
but he has the guts to do what it takes when we need him.

1299
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:44,573
If I shoot up,
I could hurt myself real bad.

1300
01:20:44,607 --> 01:20:45,875
I don't mess with needles.

1301
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:47,476
You don't feel anything.

1302
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,145
I could tear
my hamstring to bits.

1303
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,316
God damn it,
isn't it time you thought about the team?

1304
01:20:54,383 --> 01:20:56,219
Now, you listen, Delma.

1305
01:20:56,252 --> 01:20:57,954
You can't make it in this league if you don't know the difference

1306
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:59,055
between pain
and injury.

1307
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:02,458
Hey...

1308
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:05,895
I'm just
trying to help.

1309
01:21:15,138 --> 01:21:17,040
Fuck it.

1310
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:19,408
Come on, you guys,
stop playing grab-ass and get ready.

1311
01:21:30,353 --> 01:21:32,521
Shit, I want to hit somebody!
Give me some of that.

1312
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:33,990
Hit somebody!

1313
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:36,159
Goddamn, Monroe,
save it for the field.

1314
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:40,496
I want to hit!
Hit! Hit! Hit!

1315
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:42,165
Here, give me
some, too, man.

1316
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,269
That's good.

1317
01:21:48,504 --> 01:21:51,374
Okay, when Weeks starts looping over the middle,
what are you gonna do?

1318
01:21:51,407 --> 01:21:52,608
I'm gonna
stay at home.

1319
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:53,676
Okay, there's
no problem there.

1320
01:21:53,709 --> 01:21:55,311
That's right.
Okay.

1321
01:21:58,181 --> 01:21:59,915
Jo Bob, you know
who that is?

1322
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,719
That's Alcie Weeks, baby.

1323
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,688
He's ugly.

1324
01:22:05,721 --> 01:22:07,090
He's the ugliest man
I ever seen,

1325
01:22:07,123 --> 01:22:09,525
and I don't want none of his ugly rubbing off on my pretty face.

1326
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:10,826
All right.

1327
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:13,429
I want you to knock his cock in his watch pocket,
Jo Bob.

1328
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:14,430
All right.

1329
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,000
I want him walking
on his elbows

1330
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:18,968
in the morning,
Jo Bob. He will.

1331
01:22:19,002 --> 01:22:20,436
What are you gonna do
to him, Jo Bob?

1332
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:34,517
Come on,
eat him up.

1333
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:35,985
That's right,
eat him up.

1334
01:22:36,019 --> 01:22:38,054
All night long.

1335
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,056
All night long,
Jo Bob,

1336
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:42,558
you'll be eating
his stuff right up,

1337
01:22:42,591 --> 01:22:44,727
just like
white on rice.

1338
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,729
You're gonna be sticking to him,
Jo Bob.

1339
01:22:46,762 --> 01:22:48,464
If he does any
of that fancy loops,

1340
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:50,199
any of that kind of stuff.
I'm gonna get him.

1341
01:22:50,233 --> 01:22:51,600
We're gonna do it.
That's right.

1342
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,002
All night long,
Jo Bob.

1343
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:54,137
They say
he's the best?

1344
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:55,738
He ain't the best.
He's nothing.

1345
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:58,307
You can be
the best, baby.

1346
01:22:58,341 --> 01:22:59,708
You are the best.
I'm gonna get him.

1347
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:01,044
It's time to get down.
I'm gonna get him.

1348
01:23:01,077 --> 01:23:02,511
It's time to get down.
Yeah.

1349
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:05,014
Let's pad up now.
You want to pad up? Yeah.

1350
01:23:05,048 --> 01:23:06,082
Let's go.
Let's get him.

1351
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:07,783
Let's get ready now.
All right.

1352
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,418
You ready?
Let's go pad up, baby.

1353
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:11,520
Where's my locker?
It's right behind you.

1354
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:20,496
Hey, Hartman,
while you're at it,

1355
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:22,531
why don't you ask the man about the point spread?

1356
01:23:23,299 --> 01:23:24,400
Pussy.

1357
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:36,679
Well, all right.
No wonder they call it the windy city.

1358
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:38,814
Hey, baby. Cool.

1359
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,549
Come on, honey,
save some for the party.

1360
01:23:41,784 --> 01:23:43,686
You got a face
like a baby's butt.

1361
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:45,421
Thank you, Seth.
Beautiful.

1362
01:23:46,789 --> 01:23:48,191
Fuck it!

1363
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:51,194
Tell you what.

1364
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:53,729
This time I'm gonna get the bastard with this.
All right.

1365
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,464
Mother clotheslined
me last time.

1366
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:56,665
I'm gonna tear
his ass up.

1367
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:59,135
I lost four fucking teeth,
four teeth.

1368
01:23:59,168 --> 01:24:00,436
I'm gonna tear
his ass up.

1369
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,415
Ten minutes!
Ten minutes!

1370
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,635
You ready, babe?

1371
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:34,837
Alan, I can't
fumble, man.

1372
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:37,140
You saw what they did to Stallings.
Hey...

1373
01:24:37,173 --> 01:24:38,574
You'll be all right, okay?

1374
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:42,645
Give me a hit.

1375
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:46,081
Ready?

1376
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:53,222
Thank you.

1377
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:57,693
Can't fumble.

1378
01:24:59,162 --> 01:25:00,696
Can't fumble football.

1379
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:12,775
Hey! All right.
Have a good game.

1380
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:14,410
All right?
All right, all right.

1381
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,412
Let's go, Jo Bob.
Let's get 'em.

1382
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:17,480
Let's go, babe.

1383
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:47,310
How's that, Mark?

1384
01:25:47,343 --> 01:25:48,877
Little more air, Keith.

1385
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:50,313
Hey, why don't you
pump up his ass

1386
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:52,181
and blow his brains out?
Up yours, asshole.

1387
01:25:52,215 --> 01:25:53,416
Oh, fuck you.

1388
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:55,484
Five minutes!

1389
01:25:55,518 --> 01:25:58,187
How long, Coach?
Five... Fuck you!

1390
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:03,559
All right,
settle down.

1391
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:04,960
Listen up.

1392
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,295
Out with
the cigarettes.

1393
01:26:06,562 --> 01:26:07,563
Coach.

1394
01:26:09,298 --> 01:26:11,567
Just one reminder,
gentlemen.

1395
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,469
Please remember to
take off your helmets

1396
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,604
when they play
the national anthem.

1397
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:18,407
Also remember you're
on national TV,

1398
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:20,175
so don't pick your noses
or scratch your nuts.

1399
01:26:22,645 --> 01:26:23,746
Excuse me,
Coach Johnson.

1400
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,818
Mr.
Hunter would like to say a few words to you now.

1401
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,354
Thank you, B.A.

1402
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:33,756
Men...

1403
01:26:34,757 --> 01:26:36,892
I want you
to win this game

1404
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:39,562
for our fans,
for Dallas,

1405
01:26:39,595 --> 01:26:40,729
for me and my
little brother.

1406
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:43,566
Not necessarily
in that order.

1407
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:48,904
Now, if we win
this game,

1408
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:50,439
you're all invited
to spend a weekend

1409
01:26:50,473 --> 01:26:51,974
with your wives
and families

1410
01:26:52,007 --> 01:26:53,642
at my private island
in the Caribbean.

1411
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,246
Bullshit.

1412
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:58,681
And remember,

1413
01:26:59,615 --> 01:27:01,584
the eyes of Texas
are on you.

1414
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:08,757
Knock that
shit off!

1415
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:12,495
Monsignor.

1416
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:21,003
Dear Lord,
I ask your blessing on these brave boys

1417
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:22,971
as they venture
out to battle.

1418
01:27:23,005 --> 01:27:24,507
Take off your
fucking hats!

1419
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,409
Sorry, Monsignor.

1420
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:30,779
We ask not
for victory,

1421
01:27:30,813 --> 01:27:32,648
not for glory,

1422
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:34,650
not for fame.

1423
01:27:34,683 --> 01:27:37,620
We ask only for
the preservation

1424
01:27:37,653 --> 01:27:39,054
of our bodies

1425
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,823
and of our minds.

1426
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:45,561
Bless also the entire
Hunter family

1427
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:48,364
who have so
unselfishly given us

1428
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:50,799
everything
we need for victory,

1429
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:52,635
except our efforts

1430
01:27:52,668 --> 01:27:55,338
in the spirit
of sportsmanship,

1431
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:56,939
with thy guidance,

1432
01:27:56,972 --> 01:28:01,310
thy kingdom, power,
and glory for evermore.

1433
01:28:01,344 --> 01:28:03,612
Amen.
- Amen.

1434
01:28:03,646 --> 01:28:05,714
Let's go kill
those cocksuckers!

1435
01:28:25,434 --> 01:28:26,902
Elliott?
Yeah?

1436
01:28:26,935 --> 01:28:28,604
I'm starting Delma,
but you stay up.

1437
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:29,772
Be ready when
I need you.

1438
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:42,084
He said he's starting Delma.
I heard.

1439
01:28:42,117 --> 01:28:44,787
Yeah, but I thought...
I can't worry about that right now, poot.

1440
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,356
You just be ready.

1441
01:29:09,878 --> 01:29:11,614
With less than two minutes left in the game

1442
01:29:11,647 --> 01:29:12,915
this might be it
for North Dallas.

1443
01:29:12,948 --> 01:29:14,717
Chicago
leading 14-7.

1444
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,985
North Dallas is
on the Chicago 25.

1445
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,887
First and 10.

1446
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:20,489
This is nail-biting time
for the fans.

1447
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:21,857
But it is suck-it-up
time for the players

1448
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:23,626
because they have
to score on this drive.

1449
01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:26,429
Seth Maxwell fakes.
Hands off instead to Andy Belford

1450
01:29:26,462 --> 01:29:28,096
and Belford is stacked up
for a three-yard loss

1451
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,598
by Alice Weeks.

1452
01:29:29,632 --> 01:29:31,867
Boy, they haven't kept Weeks out of there all night.

1453
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,602
He has been in that
backfield all day.

1454
01:29:33,636 --> 01:29:35,170
They should give him a uniform the way he plays

1455
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,839
in the North
Dallas backfield.

1456
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:38,306
It'll be a 3-yard loss back to the 28 yard line.

1457
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,309
The clock is running.
I wonder what they're saying

1458
01:29:41,343 --> 01:29:44,913
as far as strategy is concerned right now in that North Dallas huddle.

1459
01:29:44,947 --> 01:29:46,749
Jo Bob,
we need to get through "Titty Block" and Weeks.

1460
01:29:46,782 --> 01:29:48,150
Why don't you hit
the fucker, huh?

1461
01:29:48,183 --> 01:29:49,518
Why don't you go
and fuck yourself?

1462
01:29:49,552 --> 01:29:50,753
You just stay here
on the ball, Balford,

1463
01:29:50,786 --> 01:29:51,954
we'll take care
of up front.

1464
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:53,456
Fuck you, psycho.

1465
01:29:53,489 --> 01:29:56,158
Just try to get that fucking ball across the line of scrimmage, asshole!

1466
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:00,763
Shut the fuck up!

1467
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:02,565
Nobody talks in this fucking huddle except me.

1468
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:05,701
Jo Bob, O.W.,
God damn it,

1469
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,102
I cannot throw the football with these guys

1470
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:09,438
hanging all over my ass.
Yes, sir.

1471
01:30:09,472 --> 01:30:11,540
Fitch, I want
a wing-quick-burst.

1472
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:15,811
All right?
Red-right-76 on two.

1473
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:17,580
Ready?
- Break!

1474
01:30:17,613 --> 01:30:18,814
Weeks, I'm gonna get
your ass this time.

1475
01:30:18,847 --> 01:30:20,616
I'm fucking going to
kill you, cocksucker.

1476
01:30:21,484 --> 01:30:22,885
Come on, Jo Bob.

1477
01:30:25,688 --> 01:30:26,822
Hey, Jo Bob.

1478
01:30:28,023 --> 01:30:30,058
You're looking lousy.

1479
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:32,595
You're getting old.
I hate to do it,

1480
01:30:32,628 --> 01:30:34,463
but I'm gonna put your
dick all in the dirt.

1481
01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:36,865
Set!

1482
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:43,739
4-48.

1483
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:45,874
4-48.

1484
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:48,110
Hut! Hut!

1485
01:30:48,143 --> 01:30:50,546
Maxwell's in a shotgun formation on seven and 13 from the 28.

1486
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:51,614
He fades to pass...

1487
01:30:51,647 --> 01:30:53,982
What a rush by Weeks,
who dumps him.

1488
01:30:54,016 --> 01:30:55,283
The pass is off, though.

1489
01:30:55,317 --> 01:30:57,786
Fitch, streaking down
the middle, is in the open.

1490
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:58,987
Drop it.

1491
01:30:59,021 --> 01:31:00,989
And the pass
is no good.

1492
01:31:03,826 --> 01:31:06,495
Come on, Fitch!
Concentrate!

1493
01:31:11,834 --> 01:31:13,135
Are you okay, baby?

1494
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:14,637
Hey, Weeks!

1495
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:17,640
The clock is stopped
and now an altercation

1496
01:31:17,673 --> 01:31:18,607
breaks out
on the field

1497
01:31:18,641 --> 01:31:20,042
among a couple
of the linemen.

1498
01:31:21,877 --> 01:31:24,513
I can understand why tempers are a little hot right now,

1499
01:31:24,547 --> 01:31:25,948
because the game's
winding down to an end.

1500
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,249
And this is
the season for them.

1501
01:31:27,282 --> 01:31:28,717
Maxwell's asking
for a time out

1502
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:32,020
although the incomplete pass has stopped the clock.

1503
01:31:32,054 --> 01:31:34,089
We've got less than
a minute to play.

1504
01:31:34,122 --> 01:31:37,259
Maxwell coming to the sideline to talk to his coach.

1505
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,628
And you have to think
right now that Chicago

1506
01:31:39,662 --> 01:31:40,863
will drop back
on defense

1507
01:31:40,896 --> 01:31:42,464
and be in
a prevent defense

1508
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,868
because it appears that North Dallas to win this ball game

1509
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:47,636
will have to keep it
in the air.

1510
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:50,138
This is also the last time out that North Dallas has.

1511
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:51,506
So they're probably trying to come up with some strategy

1512
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,276
that will allow them to run 3 or 4 plays in a row.

1513
01:31:54,309 --> 01:31:56,712
They have very little time left if they're going to score.

1514
01:31:58,146 --> 01:32:00,015
Maxwell is signaling
to Phil Elliott.

1515
01:32:00,048 --> 01:32:03,886
I think,
Elliott's going to come into the ball game as one of the receivers.

1516
01:32:03,919 --> 01:32:06,822
And I'll go with Elliott and Huddle as the wide receivers.

1517
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:08,957
And of course, like we said,
we're going to look for some pass plays...

1518
01:32:11,093 --> 01:32:13,596
Hey, if he comes in,
then I want something special for him.

1519
01:32:13,629 --> 01:32:15,197
Having fun, boys?

1520
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,732
Blow it up
your asshole.

1521
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,635
How's the leg, Del?

1522
01:32:19,668 --> 01:32:22,204
Like your knee.
I can't feel anything. Yeah.

1523
01:32:22,237 --> 01:32:23,672
All right,
huddle up!

1524
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:29,778
God damn it, Jo Bob,
I ain't losing this game.

1525
01:32:29,812 --> 01:32:32,047
I'm tired of Weeks sitting in my goddamn face all night.

1526
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,115
But I hurt, Seth.

1527
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,585
I hurt bad.

1528
01:32:36,619 --> 01:32:37,686
I don't give a shit.
We all hurt.

1529
01:32:39,087 --> 01:32:40,856
All right, let's trap
the son of a bitch.

1530
01:32:40,889 --> 01:32:43,592
O.W., Jo Bob,
break his fucking leg if you have to.

1531
01:32:43,626 --> 01:32:45,327
I want him
out of there.

1532
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:48,163
All right?
Green-right-c-motion.

1533
01:32:48,196 --> 01:32:50,666
41-trap-delay
on three.

1534
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,100
Ready?
- Break!

1535
01:32:52,134 --> 01:32:53,568
Maxwell, brings them
out of the huddle.

1536
01:32:53,602 --> 01:32:56,772
And you know Chicago's gonna be coming on this play.

1537
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:58,807
We'll see if they've come up
with a good play here.

1538
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:02,077
I wonder if Maxwell called it or if the
coach called that one over on the sideline.

1539
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,679
Huddle lines up
on the left

1540
01:33:03,712 --> 01:33:05,814
and Maxwell
down under center.

1541
01:33:05,848 --> 01:33:08,350
The clock does not start now,
until the snap of the ball.

1542
01:33:08,383 --> 01:33:10,185
Huddle's in motion
to the right.

1543
01:33:11,954 --> 01:33:13,321
Back to pass
is Maxwell.

1544
01:33:13,355 --> 01:33:14,690
It's a draw play
ball fake.

1545
01:33:20,996 --> 01:33:22,798
Suck
on that, Weeks!

1546
01:33:22,831 --> 01:33:24,499
Alcie Weeks,
the big defensive tackle for Chicago is down.

1547
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:28,704
It looks like he's holding his right knee.
This could be a serious blow

1548
01:33:28,737 --> 01:33:30,839
to the Marauders' chances
if he is out of the game.

1549
01:33:30,873 --> 01:33:32,708
North Dallas not only
gets a first down,

1550
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:34,209
the clock is stopped.

1551
01:33:34,242 --> 01:33:37,212
It looked like he got
hurt in a trap block

1552
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:40,082
by Jo Bob Priddy
and O.W. Shaddock.

1553
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:42,350
Well, Weeks had been beating those two all night long

1554
01:33:42,384 --> 01:33:44,119
and they finally got back
at him on that play.

1555
01:33:44,152 --> 01:33:46,722
And a big first down
for North Dallas.

1556
01:33:46,755 --> 01:33:49,024
Jesus, Jo Bob,
we hurt him bad, man.

1557
01:33:49,324 --> 01:33:50,693
Fuck him.

1558
01:33:52,094 --> 01:33:53,161
Fuck it.

1559
01:33:54,196 --> 01:33:55,998
Huddle up.
Huddle up!

1560
01:34:04,907 --> 01:34:07,075
All right, good job.
Good job.

1561
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:09,011
Let's tie it up and take it into overtime.

1562
01:34:09,044 --> 01:34:11,346
Can you get the outside
linebacker, Phil?

1563
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:13,215
All right, Delma,
it's your chance to be a star, baby.

1564
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,918
Let's go, baby.
Red-lax-92.

1565
01:34:15,951 --> 01:34:17,452
First sound,
all right? First sound.

1566
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:18,954
Ready?
- Break!

1567
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:20,488
This is the situation
facing North Dallas,

1568
01:34:20,522 --> 01:34:23,125
they've got the ball,
18 yards away from a touchdown,

1569
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:25,928
but they have only 24 seconds left in the game.

1570
01:34:25,961 --> 01:34:27,896
They have to score
if they're going to tie

1571
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:30,398
this championship contest up
and send it into overtime.

1572
01:34:30,432 --> 01:34:32,768
Maxwell sends Huddle
and Elliott to the left side

1573
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:35,170
so they overload Chicago's defensive right side.
- Hut!

1574
01:34:35,203 --> 01:34:36,805
On 1st and 10.

1575
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:39,207
Back to pass, Maxwell.
The lane is Huddle.

1576
01:34:39,241 --> 01:34:41,009
And the pass is to Huddle on the sidelines.

1577
01:34:41,043 --> 01:34:43,278
However, there's a flag down,
Huddle is hurt.

1578
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:46,348
Oh, what a hit by Francis Chapman from the secondary!

1579
01:34:46,381 --> 01:34:48,784
Let's check
the penalty marker.

1580
01:34:48,817 --> 01:34:51,053
The preliminary indication
from the official is

1581
01:34:51,086 --> 01:34:53,889
offensive holding
against the Bulls.

1582
01:34:53,922 --> 01:34:55,958
So instead of
a gain for a huddle,

1583
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:58,326
it will be a 10-yard penalty against North Dallas,

1584
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,828
and the play
is erased.

1585
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:09,204
God damn it.
Look at his face.

1586
01:35:09,237 --> 01:35:10,338
Fix his face!

1587
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,174
Elliott!

1588
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:14,309
Elliott!
Get up, Delma!

1589
01:35:14,342 --> 01:35:16,011
Get back
in the huddle!

1590
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:17,279
The doctor will
look after him!

1591
01:35:24,152 --> 01:35:25,821
You get back in
that huddle now

1592
01:35:25,854 --> 01:35:26,922
or off the field!

1593
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:37,933
Let's take
a second look at that play.

1594
01:35:37,966 --> 01:35:39,567
You can see this play
was well set up

1595
01:35:39,601 --> 01:35:40,568
as Huddle takes a little step back from the line of scrimmage

1596
01:35:40,602 --> 01:35:42,905
and takes a swing
pass from Maxwell.

1597
01:35:42,938 --> 01:35:45,040
He is wide open
when he starts downfield.

1598
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:47,509
But then he grabs his leg,
obviously in pain,

1599
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:50,879
and Francis Chapman comes up and lays a massive blow on him.

1600
01:35:50,913 --> 01:35:52,014
There is no way
that Huddle

1601
01:35:52,047 --> 01:35:54,282
is going to make it back
in this contest.

1602
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:57,119
Man, you ought to see Delma's face.
Not now, poot.

1603
01:35:57,152 --> 01:35:58,887
All right, God damn it,
let's get mean.

1604
01:35:58,921 --> 01:36:00,856
Let's stick it
up their ass.

1605
01:36:00,889 --> 01:36:03,358
All right, two plays,
back to back. No huddle.

1606
01:36:03,391 --> 01:36:05,327
Red-right-76,

1607
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,229
come back with
red-right-79.

1608
01:36:07,529 --> 01:36:08,931
Phil.

1609
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,136
You throw it, partner,
I'll catch it.

1610
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,908
Both plays on 2.

1611
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:21,810
Ready...
- Break!

1612
01:36:21,844 --> 01:36:23,879
The Bulls are now in worse shape than they were before, Ross.

1613
01:36:23,912 --> 01:36:26,014
They have got only
16 seconds left,

1614
01:36:26,048 --> 01:36:28,416
but they are 28 yards
away from the score.

1615
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:30,853
1st and 20,
as Maxwell sets them up.

1616
01:36:30,886 --> 01:36:33,121
The clock does not start until the snap is made.

1617
01:36:33,155 --> 01:36:34,422
Elliott is in motion
to the right.

1618
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:36,258
Maxwell's back to pass.

1619
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:37,292
He's going to Elliott.

1620
01:36:38,326 --> 01:36:40,963
It's complete
at the 15-yard line.

1621
01:36:40,996 --> 01:36:42,664
But the clock
is running.

1622
01:36:42,697 --> 01:36:45,067
It was a good catch by Elliott,
but he didn't get out of bounds.

1623
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,102
So they've got to hurry if they are going to get a playoff

1624
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,304
and get another chance to score before this game is over.

1625
01:36:49,337 --> 01:36:52,440
Five, four,
three, two, one.

1626
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:54,209
They got
the play off.

1627
01:37:19,534 --> 01:37:21,937
Yeah! Yeah!

1628
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:24,339
Great catch!

1629
01:37:24,372 --> 01:37:25,974
Goddamn!

1630
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:29,277
All right.

1631
01:37:33,248 --> 01:37:34,249
Good pass, man.

1632
01:37:34,282 --> 01:37:36,418
You're my ace in the hole.
Good pass. Yeah.

1633
01:37:38,453 --> 01:37:40,555
North Dallas
has a chance to tie it.

1634
01:37:40,588 --> 01:37:43,959
And Prejza,
the outstanding kicker in the league, is in there.

1635
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:45,627
North Dallas
couldn't have the ball

1636
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:46,528
in any better hands in this case...
Or I guess you should say

1637
01:37:46,561 --> 01:37:47,795
in any better feet
than Prejza,

1638
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:50,632
because he has kicked
43 straight extra points.

1639
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:52,234
That's a new
North Dallas record,

1640
01:37:52,267 --> 01:37:54,402
and they're calling
him "Mr. Automatic."

1641
01:37:54,436 --> 01:37:55,971
Campos will snap it back.

1642
01:37:56,004 --> 01:37:57,472
Art Hartman will put it down.
The snap.

1643
01:37:57,505 --> 01:37:59,641
The ball gets away from Hartman.
It's on the ground.

1644
01:37:59,674 --> 01:38:02,177
Chicago recovers.
The game is over.

1645
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:04,646
The Chicago Marauders
have held off

1646
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:09,284
the North Dallas Rally who win 14-13,
and what a finish.

1647
01:38:09,317 --> 01:38:11,153
It looked like that snap
was right on the money.

1648
01:38:11,186 --> 01:38:13,989
Hartman just couldn't control it,
as it bounced around off his finger tips

1649
01:38:14,022 --> 01:38:15,090
and what a shame
for North Dallas

1650
01:38:15,123 --> 01:38:17,192
after making such
a dramatic comeback

1651
01:38:17,225 --> 01:38:20,028
in the last few seconds
to move within one point.

1652
01:38:20,062 --> 01:38:22,197
An agonizing defeat
for North Dallas.

1653
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,099
They thought they had
the ball game tied.

1654
01:38:24,132 --> 01:38:26,268
They felt the overtime
was upcoming.

1655
01:38:26,301 --> 01:38:28,603
But it was not to be
and the Chicago Marauders

1656
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:31,206
have won the championship by 1 point.

1657
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:38,113
Listen, Phil,
you hold that arm steady tonight.

1658
01:38:39,047 --> 01:38:40,448
Hey, uh,
how's Delma?

1659
01:38:40,482 --> 01:38:41,483
He needs surgery.

1660
01:38:50,725 --> 01:38:52,127
Hey, Elliott.

1661
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:55,230
You looked pretty good
out there tonight.

1662
01:38:56,331 --> 01:38:58,533
You played good.

1663
01:38:58,566 --> 01:39:00,969
I wish we could say the same thing for you,
Jo Bob.

1664
01:39:02,170 --> 01:39:04,439
You should've studied
Weeks' tendencies.

1665
01:39:04,472 --> 01:39:06,008
I thought I did, coach.

1666
01:39:06,041 --> 01:39:08,276
You don't listen.

1667
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:10,712
We would've won if we'd studied those tendencies.

1668
01:39:10,745 --> 01:39:13,515
Aw, shit!
You never give us anything

1669
01:39:13,548 --> 01:39:17,085
to bring in the game except your fucking facts and tendencies!

1670
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:19,021
To you,
it's just a business.

1671
01:39:19,054 --> 01:39:21,323
But to us,
it's still got to be a sport.

1672
01:39:21,356 --> 01:39:23,058
You're supposed to be a professional.
You go out there...

1673
01:39:23,091 --> 01:39:25,360
Oh, shit!
We work harder than anybody to win.

1674
01:39:25,393 --> 01:39:27,462
But, man,
when we're dead tired in the fourth quarter,

1675
01:39:27,495 --> 01:39:29,364
winning's got to mean
more than just money.

1676
01:39:29,397 --> 01:39:31,299
You were hired to do a job!
Job?

1677
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:33,101
Job? I don't
want no fucking job!

1678
01:39:33,135 --> 01:39:35,070
I wanna play
football, you asshole!

1679
01:39:35,103 --> 01:39:36,704
I want some feelings!

1680
01:39:36,738 --> 01:39:39,407
I want some fucking
team spirit!

1681
01:39:39,441 --> 01:39:42,077
This ain't no high school.
You don't have to love each other to play.

1682
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:43,578
That's just what I mean,
you bastard.

1683
01:39:43,611 --> 01:39:44,712
Every time
I call it a game,

1684
01:39:44,746 --> 01:39:46,214
you call it a business,

1685
01:39:46,248 --> 01:39:47,482
and every time
I call it business,

1686
01:39:47,515 --> 01:39:49,184
you call it a game.

1687
01:39:49,217 --> 01:39:51,686
You and B.A. And all
the rest of you coaches

1688
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:53,655
are chickenshit cocksuckers.

1689
01:39:53,688 --> 01:39:56,191
No feeling for the game at all, man.

1690
01:39:56,224 --> 01:39:57,725
You'll win,
but it'll just be numbers on a scoreboard.

1691
01:39:57,759 --> 01:39:59,661
Numbers, that's all
you care about.

1692
01:39:59,694 --> 01:40:01,296
Fuck, man,
that's not enough for me.

1693
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:03,298
I don't have to listen...
Oh, yes, you fucking do!

1694
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:05,033
You got to listen
to me for once!

1695
01:40:05,067 --> 01:40:07,735
All you coaches are
chickenshit cocksuckers!

1696
01:40:07,769 --> 01:40:09,804
You're all chickenshit
cocksuckers!

1697
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:11,406
God damn you!

1698
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,277
Far out.

1699
01:40:54,582 --> 01:40:56,318
Hey, Del,
how you doing?

1700
01:41:05,227 --> 01:41:07,395
Hey, come on, man.
You'll be back.

1701
01:41:13,801 --> 01:41:15,703
Come on. Hey, Del.

1702
01:41:15,737 --> 01:41:17,739
Come on.
You're gonna be back.

1703
01:41:17,772 --> 01:41:19,474
Come on, huh?

1704
01:41:26,648 --> 01:41:28,116
Fuck.

1705
01:41:39,861 --> 01:41:41,229
Come on.

1706
01:41:44,566 --> 01:41:45,600
Come on.

1707
01:41:51,773 --> 01:41:53,141
Whoa.

1708
01:41:58,413 --> 01:41:59,547
Good boy.

1709
01:42:04,286 --> 01:42:05,520
Hi.

1710
01:42:05,553 --> 01:42:06,588
Hi.

1711
01:42:07,655 --> 01:42:08,690
Are you all right?

1712
01:42:09,491 --> 01:42:11,259
Yeah.

1713
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:13,261
Just slightly damaged.

1714
01:42:16,398 --> 01:42:18,800
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
about the other night.

1715
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:21,135
I had no right,
no right at all.

1716
01:42:27,575 --> 01:42:28,576
You had a right.

1717
01:42:34,382 --> 01:42:36,551
You see the game?
Yeah.

1718
01:42:36,584 --> 01:42:37,685
See the catch I made?

1719
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:39,187
Yeah. It was terrific.

1720
01:42:39,554 --> 01:42:40,622
I'm sorry you lost.

1721
01:42:42,524 --> 01:42:44,659
I thought I was gonna
start that game.

1722
01:42:44,692 --> 01:42:46,294
Hell, I even
shot up my knee,

1723
01:42:47,462 --> 01:42:49,631
but they weren't
gonna let me start.

1724
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:51,699
They were just using me so they could get another ball player

1725
01:42:51,733 --> 01:42:52,667
to deaden his leg.

1726
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:54,836
God, that's awful.

1727
01:42:54,869 --> 01:42:56,404
Yeah. Well,
that's the way it is.

1728
01:42:59,307 --> 01:43:01,209
But what's important
is my performing.

1729
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,646
The moment of the catch,
that feeling, that high.

1730
01:43:05,947 --> 01:43:07,782
Hell, I can
take the crap.

1731
01:43:07,815 --> 01:43:08,950
I can take
the manipulation.

1732
01:43:08,983 --> 01:43:11,486
I can take the pain.

1733
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:12,720
As long as I get that chance every Sunday.

1734
01:43:15,323 --> 01:43:17,359
I think that this game
is twisting your mind.

1735
01:43:18,793 --> 01:43:21,629
The game's not twisting
my mind, Charlotte.

1736
01:43:21,663 --> 01:43:22,697
I know the game.

1737
01:43:23,998 --> 01:43:25,567
It's the rules
they make up.

1738
01:43:27,869 --> 01:43:29,271
I'm gonna play,

1739
01:43:30,638 --> 01:43:32,740
so I'm going
by their rules.

1740
01:43:32,774 --> 01:43:35,343
You can't separate
one from the other.

1741
01:43:35,377 --> 01:43:38,380
Yeah, but I can't buck their system.
I can't fight them

1742
01:43:38,413 --> 01:43:40,214
any more than
you can drop out.

1743
01:43:41,015 --> 01:43:42,384
Well, if you've
made up your mind,

1744
01:43:42,417 --> 01:43:43,385
why did you
come to me?

1745
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:46,488
'Cause I care
about you.

1746
01:43:48,022 --> 01:43:49,457
And I want
to see you again.

1747
01:44:03,905 --> 01:44:05,440
I've got a meeting
with Conrad Hunter.

1748
01:44:07,775 --> 01:44:09,043
Hell, I can't
let him see

1749
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,346
that the merchandise
is damaged.

1750
01:44:11,379 --> 01:44:13,381
Here. Let me help you.
Yeah.

1751
01:44:14,949 --> 01:44:17,485
You know, when you
think about it,

1752
01:44:17,519 --> 01:44:19,487
they're not worse
than anybody else, really.

1753
01:44:35,069 --> 01:44:37,405
Come in, Phil.
Come on in.

1754
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,515
Hello, B.A.

1755
01:44:49,817 --> 01:44:51,419
Sit there,
Phil boy.

1756
01:44:56,891 --> 01:44:59,361
All right, Ray.

1757
01:44:59,394 --> 01:45:01,496
Mr.
Elliott, where were you last Monday

1758
01:45:01,529 --> 01:45:03,665
until approximately
8:00 a.m. Tuesday?

1759
01:45:08,069 --> 01:45:09,671
Uh, who wants
to know that?

1760
01:45:09,704 --> 01:45:11,473
I'm Ray March.
I'm with the league's

1761
01:45:11,506 --> 01:45:13,675
internal investigations
division.

1762
01:45:13,708 --> 01:45:15,343
On Tuesday of last week,
where were you?

1763
01:45:20,548 --> 01:45:22,316
Uh...

1764
01:45:22,917 --> 01:45:24,686
Now that, um...

1765
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,721
I don't know.
You know that.

1766
01:45:26,754 --> 01:45:27,922
Why don't you tell me
where I was, huh?

1767
01:45:28,923 --> 01:45:30,458
No, no.
No, wait a minute.

1768
01:45:33,728 --> 01:45:36,698
Let me,
uh... Let me give you a little hint.

1769
01:45:38,466 --> 01:45:40,435
That wise-ass
attitude of yours

1770
01:45:40,468 --> 01:45:41,703
isn't going to get you out of this one.

1771
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:44,372
Do you understand that?

1772
01:45:47,442 --> 01:45:48,943
I think you'd best answer, Phil, boy.

1773
01:45:56,651 --> 01:45:57,819
All right.

1774
01:46:01,489 --> 01:46:02,890
Ruth, would, um...

1775
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:05,727
Would you send in
Mr. Rindquist, please?

1776
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:24,512
Go ahead,
Mr. Rindquist.

1777
01:46:25,179 --> 01:46:26,848
I am
Joseph Rindquist,

1778
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:29,617
and I am a vice-officer
with the Dallas police.

1779
01:46:29,651 --> 01:46:32,620
Off-duty, I work
for Mr. Ray March

1780
01:46:32,654 --> 01:46:35,757
investigating reports
of league misconduct.

1781
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:38,793
One week ago,
I was instructed to take up the surveillance

1782
01:46:38,826 --> 01:46:40,495
of Phillip Elliott,

1783
01:46:40,528 --> 01:46:43,097
an employee of
the Dallas franchise.

1784
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:45,933
I followed the suspect
from then until he

1785
01:46:45,967 --> 01:46:49,036
boarded a plane this last weekend bound for Chicago.

1786
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:51,439
And all this time I thought I was just paranoid.

1787
01:46:53,675 --> 01:46:55,543
"On Monday
of this week,

1788
01:46:55,577 --> 01:46:58,446
"at a party in a private
North Dallas residence,

1789
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:00,882
"the suspect was observed
near the swimming pool

1790
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:04,418
"in the company of an unidentified Caucasian adult male."

1791
01:47:05,687 --> 01:47:07,822
What do you mean,
"an unidentified white Caucasian male,"

1792
01:47:07,855 --> 01:47:09,824
for Christ sake?
Didn't you recognize him?

1793
01:47:13,227 --> 01:47:14,662
I mean, who was it
that was with me?

1794
01:47:14,696 --> 01:47:16,464
Didn't you
recognize him, huh?

1795
01:47:24,839 --> 01:47:26,440
Some investigator.

1796
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:28,910
Continue, Mr. Rindquist.

1797
01:47:30,878 --> 01:47:32,480
"At this time,

1798
01:47:32,514 --> 01:47:33,881
"the suspect
was photographed

1799
01:47:33,915 --> 01:47:36,017
"smoking a
marijuana cigarette."

1800
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:39,887
Photo exhibit "F."

1801
01:47:43,925 --> 01:47:46,561
"Now, picking up the suspect again on Tuesday,

1802
01:47:46,594 --> 01:47:48,630
"I followed him
from these offices

1803
01:47:48,663 --> 01:47:50,698
"to 2612 Houston Drive,

1804
01:47:50,732 --> 01:47:52,500
"where he remained
until morning.

1805
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,570
"This address
is the residence

1806
01:47:55,603 --> 01:47:58,640
"of a woman named Joanne Rodney..."
Mr. Rindquist.

1807
01:47:58,673 --> 01:48:00,608
We don't need to bring
others into this mess.

1808
01:48:05,046 --> 01:48:06,614
Continue.

1809
01:48:08,783 --> 01:48:12,720
"A search of the suspect's
premises was effected,

1810
01:48:12,754 --> 01:48:15,489
"uncovering a bag
of marijuana...

1811
01:48:16,724 --> 01:48:18,492
"And assorted pills."

1812
01:48:19,727 --> 01:48:21,763
You got this from
Mr. Elliott's house?

1813
01:48:21,796 --> 01:48:22,830
Yes, sir.

1814
01:48:26,167 --> 01:48:28,770
Illegal drugs are forbidden by the league rules, Phil.

1815
01:48:28,803 --> 01:48:30,271
You know that.

1816
01:48:30,304 --> 01:48:34,542
Oh, for Christ sake, Conrad. Jesus.
Smoking grass? Are you kidding me?

1817
01:48:34,576 --> 01:48:37,011
If you nailed
all the ballplayers

1818
01:48:37,044 --> 01:48:38,813
that smoke grass,
you wouldn't even be able to fill

1819
01:48:38,846 --> 01:48:40,648
a punt return team.
Besides that,

1820
01:48:40,682 --> 01:48:42,584
you give me harder stuff in Chicago

1821
01:48:42,617 --> 01:48:44,251
just to get out of the goddamn locker room.

1822
01:48:44,285 --> 01:48:46,688
Hard drugs.
What's...

1823
01:48:50,191 --> 01:48:52,259
Continue.

1824
01:48:52,293 --> 01:48:55,162
Uh, photo exhibit "H"
shows Mr. Elliott

1825
01:48:55,196 --> 01:48:57,665
in the company of a woman named Charlotte Calder

1826
01:48:57,699 --> 01:48:58,933
as they're coming out of
a country and western...

1827
01:48:58,966 --> 01:49:00,768
Jesus Christ!

1828
01:49:00,802 --> 01:49:02,303
You sleazy... Sit down,
God damn it!

1829
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,771
Sit in that goddamn chair!
You bastard!

1830
01:49:03,805 --> 01:49:05,039
What the hell do you think
you're doing here?

1831
01:49:05,807 --> 01:49:07,008
Damn it!

1832
01:49:07,041 --> 01:49:08,710
Who the hell you
think you are anyway?

1833
01:49:08,743 --> 01:49:10,211
We treated you
pretty well.

1834
01:49:10,244 --> 01:49:12,013
We paid you
damn well!

1835
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:13,681
If you don't think so,
try to earn that much out there.

1836
01:49:13,715 --> 01:49:15,049
You're in for a big surprise,
my friend.

1837
01:49:15,082 --> 01:49:16,250
'Cause I don't give a rat's ass who you were.

1838
01:49:16,283 --> 01:49:17,719
I'll take care
of this!

1839
01:49:17,752 --> 01:49:19,887
We don't need this guy.
You're nothing but a two-bit football player.

1840
01:49:19,921 --> 01:49:20,888
Calm down!

1841
01:49:22,023 --> 01:49:23,124
Let him talk.

1842
01:49:25,259 --> 01:49:26,694
Let him talk.

1843
01:49:31,298 --> 01:49:32,900
You got anything
to say, Phil?

1844
01:49:35,202 --> 01:49:36,638
Nah.

1845
01:49:40,708 --> 01:49:42,043
Are you part
of this, B.A.?

1846
01:49:43,811 --> 01:49:45,947
Phil, you have the best hands in football.

1847
01:49:48,115 --> 01:49:50,918
But there's a lot more to this business than ability.

1848
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,289
No, no, no, B.A.,
you're wrong.

1849
01:49:55,322 --> 01:49:56,991
You're wrong,
because it is ability.

1850
01:49:58,292 --> 01:50:00,194
It is what I can do
with these hands,

1851
01:50:01,195 --> 01:50:02,864
and that's why
I play the game.

1852
01:50:04,732 --> 01:50:06,868
It's dedication.
It's discipline.

1853
01:50:07,234 --> 01:50:09,236
It's sacrifice.

1854
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:10,772
You can't take
all the time.

1855
01:50:10,805 --> 01:50:13,074
You have to give something back to the game.

1856
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:14,942
Oh, for Christ sake, B.A.

1857
01:50:14,976 --> 01:50:16,711
My nose is busted.
I can't even breathe through it.

1858
01:50:16,744 --> 01:50:18,780
I can hardly
stand up.

1859
01:50:18,813 --> 01:50:20,214
You know, I haven't slept
more than three hours

1860
01:50:20,247 --> 01:50:21,683
at a stretch
in two years.

1861
01:50:21,716 --> 01:50:22,884
Now, isn't that giving
something back?

1862
01:50:23,718 --> 01:50:24,819
Oh, for Christ sake, B.A.,

1863
01:50:24,852 --> 01:50:27,088
there's pieces of me scattered from here to Pittsburgh

1864
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:28,856
on these
football fields.

1865
01:50:28,890 --> 01:50:31,292
Now, isn't that giving something back to the game?

1866
01:50:31,325 --> 01:50:32,660
Isn't it?

1867
01:50:36,764 --> 01:50:37,965
B.A.

1868
01:50:37,999 --> 01:50:39,266
B.A.

1869
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:41,335
B.A.

1870
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:43,170
How can you take
this away from me?

1871
01:50:45,172 --> 01:50:47,008
How can you do this?

1872
01:50:51,913 --> 01:50:53,114
Okay, Phil.

1873
01:50:54,749 --> 01:50:56,784
Only now I
speak for myself.

1874
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:00,654
And it's your
childish attitude.

1875
01:51:01,455 --> 01:51:03,024
You hurt the team.

1876
01:51:04,325 --> 01:51:06,293
Team?

1877
01:51:06,327 --> 01:51:09,096
Oh, Christ's sake, B.A.,
we're not the team!

1878
01:51:10,431 --> 01:51:11,833
They're the team!

1879
01:51:13,134 --> 01:51:15,269
These guys right here,
B.A., they're the team.

1880
01:51:15,302 --> 01:51:16,904
We're the equipment!

1881
01:51:16,938 --> 01:51:19,040
We're the jock straps,
the helmets.

1882
01:51:19,073 --> 01:51:20,908
And they just
depreciate us

1883
01:51:20,942 --> 01:51:23,177
and take us off the goddamn tax returns!

1884
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:24,678
That's what that is.

1885
01:51:30,084 --> 01:51:31,819
Yeah. Well...

1886
01:51:39,426 --> 01:51:41,062
But I was good
when I played.

1887
01:51:47,368 --> 01:51:49,937
Because the only thing that's real in that game,

1888
01:51:51,238 --> 01:51:52,840
is me.

1889
01:51:54,842 --> 01:51:56,710
And that's enough.

1890
01:51:58,512 --> 01:51:59,981
Well, I feel
for you, Phil,

1891
01:52:01,115 --> 01:52:04,118
but you confused
luck and brain.

1892
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:06,788
You betrayed me. You betrayed my family.
I tried to warn you.

1893
01:52:07,989 --> 01:52:10,524
You violated the morals clause of your contract.

1894
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:12,359
It's that simple, so,

1895
01:52:12,393 --> 01:52:13,527
pending a league
hearing,

1896
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,997
you're hereby suspended
without pay.

1897
01:52:16,297 --> 01:52:17,832
Yeah?

1898
01:52:20,367 --> 01:52:21,302
Is that what
it is, Emmett?

1899
01:52:22,436 --> 01:52:24,438
Is that what this whole charade has been about,

1900
01:52:24,471 --> 01:52:26,507
so you don't have
to pay my contract?

1901
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,275
Well, hell,
I don't need your money that bad.

1902
01:52:28,309 --> 01:52:29,310
I quit!

1903
01:52:51,298 --> 01:52:52,900
You are right, B.A.

1904
01:52:53,534 --> 01:52:54,969
Thank you.

1905
01:52:57,304 --> 01:52:59,240
It's time to put away
childish things.

1906
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:39,914
Things get
ugly up there?

1907
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:47,388
Pretty ugly.

1908
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:52,259
My name come up?

1909
01:53:54,461 --> 01:53:55,963
Uh...

1910
01:53:57,899 --> 01:53:59,833
There's no reason
to bring you into this.

1911
01:54:02,970 --> 01:54:05,072
They suspend you?

1912
01:54:05,106 --> 01:54:06,107
I quit.

1913
01:54:07,241 --> 01:54:09,043
I can't take it.
They want too much.

1914
01:54:11,412 --> 01:54:12,446
Too much ain't enough.

1915
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:15,149
Not for them.

1916
01:54:17,484 --> 01:54:18,886
What you gonna do?

1917
01:54:20,421 --> 01:54:21,923
I don't know.

1918
01:54:25,259 --> 01:54:27,494
I'm gonna go home.
I'm gonna get in bed with Charlotte.

1919
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:30,064
I'm gonna spend a week with her.
I'm gonna heal up.

1920
01:54:30,998 --> 01:54:33,367
I'm gonna spend time with her and ease up.

1921
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:34,868
Take it easy.

1922
01:54:35,336 --> 01:54:36,337
Hoss.

1923
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:38,372
Hmm?

1924
01:54:38,405 --> 01:54:40,341
I appreciate you keeping my name out of it.

1925
01:54:41,242 --> 01:54:42,276
Uh, no sweat.

1926
01:54:47,314 --> 01:54:48,482
You knew about it.

1927
01:54:52,086 --> 01:54:53,487
You know everything,
don't you, Max?

1928
01:54:55,456 --> 01:54:56,991
That I do, poot.

1929
01:55:01,295 --> 01:55:02,429
That I do.

1930
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:13,140
Hey, poot.

1931
01:55:14,141 --> 01:55:14,908
Yeah?

1932
01:55:16,043 --> 01:55:17,478
Got any of them
old pain killers?

1933
01:55:24,418 --> 01:55:26,320
You keep 'em, cowboy.
You're gonna need 'em.

1934
01:55:32,726 --> 01:55:34,061
Hey, Seth.

1935
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:38,232
We really had 'em worried in Chicago though,
didn't we?

1936
01:55:40,601 --> 01:55:42,069
Best catch
I ever seen, poot.

1937
01:55:43,370 --> 01:55:44,505
Not a bad pass, either.

1938
01:55:46,607 --> 01:55:48,175
Good luck on Sunday.

1939
01:55:52,079 --> 01:55:53,380
Hey, poot.
Yeah?
