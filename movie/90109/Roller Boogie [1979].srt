1
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,683
Hey, Phones, good morning.

2
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:49,351
Hey, what's happening, buddy?

3
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,725
Let's go skate, come on.

4
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,890
Hey, Bobby.

5
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:43,396
Look, it's Jumping Jack Flash!

6
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,543
- It's Conway!
- Oh, no!

7
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:15,559
Hang on!

8
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,550
- Good morning, Ada.
- Good morning, Terry.

9
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,249
- Is everyone up yet?
- In the dining room.

10
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:53,995
Eggs soft enough, Roger?

11
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,463
Good morning, Lovey. Drink your juice.

12
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,943
Well, I thought I'd go down
to the beach today and commit suicide.

13
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,450
That's nice, lovey. Have a good day.

14
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:34,769
Well, if anybody wants me,
I'll be at the city morgue.

15
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,173
Kids.

16
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,097
Let's go.

17
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,332
You and your fads, Terry.
Honestly, roller skating?

18
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:47,343
Next thing, you'll have me surfing,
or some such horrendous thing.

19
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,105
You'd rather not go?

20
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,237
Not after I bought my skate bag at Gucci's.

21
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:17,031
Okay, thank you.
Have a nice day. Stay off the bike path.

22
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,467
- How you doing, Phones?
- Okay.

23
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:24,262
- You need these?
- No.

24
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,665
Have a nice day. We'll see you later, okay?

25
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:30,906
- Listen. This is great! This is bad!
- Hey, Phones. What's happening, man?

26
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,075
You're looking fantastic
for the Roller Boogie contest.

27
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,312
Bobby, why don't you come
and skate with us, okay?

28
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:42,716
- Baby, I gotta work.
- Come on, please? Just for a little while.

29
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,920
- Skate with us.
- Please?

30
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:48,259
All right. I'll be back. Take care of the place.

31
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,285
Come on, man. Do it!

32
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,660
Come on, Bobby!

33
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,261
- You're next.
- I don't think so.

34
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:14,077
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.

35
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,515
Your money or your life, twinkle boots.

36
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:20,817
Yeah, how'd you like your neck
permanent waved?

37
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,053
He's turning blue, homeboy.
He's turning blue!

38
00:12:24,694 --> 00:12:26,162
Sorry, Bobby.

39
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:29,932
The guy's working out.

40
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,262
Here's yours.

41
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,296
You guys know that girl?

42
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,998
You mean, "Don't touch me, you brute?"

43
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:40,099
Yeah, I just saw her pull in
in a million-dollar car...

44
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,042
over at the parking lot.

45
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,248
Probably some rink skater
from Beverly Hills.

46
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:48,875
No, man.
No rinks in Beverly Hills, just minks.

47
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,412
Come on, forget it, Bobby.
She is way out of your league, man.

48
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,890
My Franklin, your Theresa.

49
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,999
Our two geniuses.

50
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:57,248
So we thought about London
or the Paris Conservatory...

51
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:00,012
but we accepted the Juilliard scholarship...

52
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,820
because we could just hop over,
stay in the Hamptons--

53
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:06,192
- And shopping in Manhattan.
- Lillian, please, I'm talking.

54
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,365
Then, we could see Theresa,
be back here in no time at all.

55
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,697
Actually, I think New York
would be good for her.

56
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,033
A more mature attitude toward her music
and all that, you know.

57
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,540
Sitting on the lap of creativity.

58
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:24,370
I'm sorry, he put his hands on...

59
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,406
I mean, it was an accident. I'm sorry.

60
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:33,216
- Franklin, take those off!
- In the house.

61
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,067
Franklin, I swear!

62
00:14:55,544 --> 00:14:57,535
You have more hands than a poker game!

63
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,445
Going slumming at the beach again?

64
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:01,574
Your mother thinks
you're going out with me.

65
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,017
Franklin, I'm not in the mood
for octopus rally!

66
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,714
Terry, I need you.
Your body is driving me crazy.

67
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:09,281
Franklin, Barbie dolls drive you crazy.

68
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:11,884
- You're oversexed.
- Come on, Terry.

69
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,196
Franklin, stop it!

70
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,199
Terry, give me back that towel.

71
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,630
Terry, I'm sorry. Please, come on.

72
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,899
My mother's inside.

73
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,867
So what? It's not that big a thing, anyway.

74
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,036
Terry, come on. Come back!

75
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:32,972
Bye.

76
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,358
Terry, come back!

77
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:50,593
Mother.

78
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:55,133
- And he is the best we got.
- Excuse me.

79
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,366
- You guys, look here.
- Excuse me.

80
00:15:57,973 --> 00:16:02,001
It's the golden girls of Beverly Hills.
How's old Be Hills these days?

81
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:05,138
- Let me help you.
- All right, a telephone, man!

82
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:07,574
Give me Alaska.

83
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,982
Let me get your bag for you, okay?
Here you go.

84
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,646
How you doing?
My name is Gordo, remember me?

85
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,348
How you doing?

86
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,758
Hope you have a good time skating.

87
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,056
Excuse me, Miss Buns.

88
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:32,972
Come on, will you, Bobby.

89
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:37,104
Come on, look at her car, man.
Look at her car, then look at yourself.

90
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:39,511
That's three things that don't match:

91
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,847
this car, you, and that chick.
I'm telling you, man.

92
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,615
I got $5 says she'll skate with me tonight.

93
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:48,350
You do? $5? You're on, sucker.

94
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,620
- Here's mine.
- What is this?

95
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,027
That's my IOU. I'm good for it.

96
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,868
Come on, let's go.

97
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,336
Hey, are you crazy?

98
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:33,644
What was that?

99
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:37,447
That was Complete Control Conway,
the one-man destruction derby.

100
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:41,746
- Lovely. I'm fine, thank you.
- You sure are.

101
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,392
- You can let go now.
- I know that.

102
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,896
- Would you do it?
- Not until you say you'll skate with me.

103
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:50,898
Hey, I saved your life.

104
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,510
You're the best skater
on the boardwalk, true?

105
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,569
I don't know. I do okay.

106
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,548
I need someone to teach me
how to dance on skates.

107
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,585
I'll pay you $10 an hour.

108
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:15,321
Here's $5 in advance. I'm gonna freshen up.

109
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,231
You ain't skating with her yet.

110
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,301
Say, look, you!

111
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,838
- Yes?
- Something about this isn't right.

112
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:39,906
Hey, wait up!

113
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:44,116
Sorry, ladies.

114
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:55,688
Okay, everybody, it's time to play.

115
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:59,425
It is couples-only time. Couples only.

116
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:10,701
Come on, this is a good song.
It's almost over.

117
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:16,513
What's your name, anyway?
Did you see me in that commercial?

118
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,052
I'll bet you can't skate, anyway.

119
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:26,056
Ready?

120
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:28,360
This is all screwed up.

121
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,524
I'm supposed to ask you if you wanna skate.

122
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,864
- Okay, ask.
- Do you wanna skate or something?

123
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,901
Sure, I wanna skate or something.

124
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,832
- Let's go.
- Okay.

125
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:16,671
What are you, a prejudiced person?
Let's go out there and dance a little.

126
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,542
You don't want to dance with me?

127
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:36,955
You win, sucker. There.

128
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,375
Don't get scared.
I'm gonna show you something.

129
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:54,575
Just relax and stay loose.

130
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,407
All right, it's time to get on down
with a new sound. Here we go.

131
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:22,443
I think it's your wheel.

132
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:27,279
$54.

133
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:31,814
Bobby, you clown. You know
that music hurts my poor old ears.

134
00:24:33,088 --> 00:24:35,523
- Terry Barkley, Jammer Delany.
- Hi.

135
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:37,849
Hello, love.

136
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:40,952
- My God, but you sure are pretty.
- Thank you.

137
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,596
- Anything she needs, I'm good for it.
- Okay.

138
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:46,134
Did you know
Jam was eight-time National Champion?

139
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:48,727
Fastest man through the pack on skates.

140
00:24:49,171 --> 00:24:52,835
That was until they took my knee cap apart
in six places.

141
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:57,342
Boy, I'm telling you, skating's changed a lot
since I was a top jammer.

142
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,743
I'm sure it has.

143
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:00,782
- You got a wrench?
- I think so.

144
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:01,907
Good.

145
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:04,814
- Here we go.
- All right, thanks a lot, Jammer.

146
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:06,615
You're welcome, Bobby.

147
00:25:06,688 --> 00:25:09,817
- Enjoy yourself now, love.
- I shall. Thank you.

148
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:16,028
Wrong one.

149
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:21,266
Top jammer?

150
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,204
You know, Roller Derby.

151
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,206
Sure, my parents watch it every night on TV.

152
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,400
Okay.

153
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:31,374
This one's just as nice as the other one.

154
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:41,489
Hey, Terry, wait up.

155
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,717
Wait up!

156
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:47,623
Thanks for skating with me, kid.

157
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:52,031
We still have 45 minutes left.
And my name ain't "Kid," it's Bobby.

158
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,934
- Bobby James.
- Keep the change, Bobby James.

159
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:26,167
Terry, will there be anything else?

160
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:30,199
- No thanks, Ada. My folks come home yet?
- Child, didn't they tell you?

161
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,572
They went to the Palm Springs house
for the weekend.

162
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:34,905
I forgot.

163
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:38,773
Listen, I can stay over
if you don't want to be alone.

164
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,976
No, it's okay. You go on home.
I'll be fine, thank you.

165
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,643
All right, dear.

166
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:49,046
Last time my mama went to Palm Springs,
she came home with a new papa.

167
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:53,152
- Now she's in Mexico, dear thing.
- Doing what, pray tell?

168
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:58,289
Getting rid of my new papa.
Then it's back to the Springs for another try.

169
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,594
My parents don't have to tell me
where they're going.

170
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,139
Why should I tell them
where I'm going, right?

171
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:06,000
Where are you going?

172
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,606
Crazy! Anybody wanna come?

173
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,306
She's off to the beach again.

174
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,980
Her choice of friends
leaves something to be desired.

175
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,144
She picked you, didn't she?

176
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,948
Franklin, you nerd! You ruined my nails!

177
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:43,568
Okay, put another 20 pounds on that, boy.

178
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,739
Another 20 pounds, Master Hoppy?

179
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,681
Why, sure enough, sir!
Coming right on up here.

180
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,939
Okay, now.

181
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,643
I got it!

182
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,515
Okay.

183
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,645
I think he's got it!

184
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:30,752
How long have we had this chest pain,
my boy?

185
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:36,322
- Get it off, you pinheads!
- Watch out.

186
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:42,468
What the hell
do you think you're doing, man?

187
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:44,005
These guys.

188
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:46,403
We're going to the pier later.
You wanna come?

189
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,566
I gotta practice.

190
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,509
Come on, man.
There's a new waitress at Casa Cucaracha.

191
00:28:50,578 --> 00:28:54,947
- She wants your body anytime, day or night.
- She said she loved Olympic skaters.

192
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:56,381
- She did not.
- Did, too.

193
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:59,477
I got one hour of workout,
two hours practice.

194
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:03,147
- You know my routine.
- All right, give it a break, man.

195
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:05,659
- Let's go find some women.
- I'll see you later.

196
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,855
- Come on!
- Don't be a drag!

197
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,063
Get off my case!
My time is my own, you get it?

198
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,270
No Olympic judge is gonna vote
for a turkey boardwalk skater.

199
00:29:30,385 --> 00:29:31,944
That waitress...

200
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:34,215
is she a real fox?

201
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:38,192
- Yeah, a fox, man.
- That chick's uglier than her enchiladas.

202
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,932
Rich chicks, gold medals, Olympics...
Always wants something he can't have.

203
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:05,881
You're gonna regret this in the morning.

204
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:10,323
They're just your parents, Barkley.
They're not supposed to understand.

205
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,524
I don't give a damn
if they don't have time for me anymore.

206
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,461
I'm a big girl, right?

207
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,465
Who needs to know where they're going
or when they'll be back.

208
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:20,399
They don't owe me anything.

209
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:23,130
Your mother brings you a new father
when she comes home.

210
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:24,763
That's something, at least.

211
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,933
You are acting so childish.

212
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:30,043
Our little genius
is throwing a temper tantrum.

213
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:32,571
When are you gonna come back?

214
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:37,813
I'll be back when I get here.

215
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,348
- Let's go.
- Oh, it's you.

216
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,679
- You still owe me 45 minutes.
- You got a mental problem or something?

217
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:19,056
You wanna skate,
and then you don't wanna skate.

218
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,720
What is it with you?

219
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:24,959
- I was watching you. You're very good.
- I know that.

220
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:29,927
Well, excuse me if you don't have time.

221
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:32,336
Sit down. I'll be just a minute.

222
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,353
If that was meant to impress me, it did.

223
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:50,687
You're very good.
You should do something with that talent.

224
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:53,022
The Olympics will be around soon.

225
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:55,791
The Olympics? That's a lot to bite off.

226
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:58,863
- I got a big appetite.
- I guess you do.

227
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:02,435
Okay, let's do it!

228
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:08,203
- Are we gonna do it right here?
- Anywhere you want to.

229
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:12,172
You don't waste any time, do you?

230
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:15,512
- I was talking about skating.
- Sure you were.

231
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,716
Is that one of your better moves?

232
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,284
Where is she? This really gripes me.

233
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:15,743
What's wrong?

234
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,735
Nothing's wrong.

235
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,404
I just don't understand you.

236
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:23,842
You coming on so strong and all.

237
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,179
What do you want from me?

238
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:29,848
What does any woman want from a man?

239
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:33,426
Look, you're not
no bimbo from the boardwalk.

240
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:36,691
Are you sure you wanna do it?

241
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,867
I don't believe you just said that.

242
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,898
I don't believe I said it, either.

243
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:47,637
You're not figuring on
paying me for this, too, are you?

244
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:51,008
What in the hell was that for?
I mean, you started it!

245
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:54,014
Because I didn't plan
to be seduced on the beach!

246
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:59,544
You just wanna
forget about the whole thing?

247
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:04,617
I just wanted someone to hold me.
Was that too much to ask for?

248
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,055
Terry, wait up.

249
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:21,574
Where have you been?
We've been looking everywhere.

250
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,839
When are you gonna
give up this tacky scene?

251
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:26,744
- What's wrong?
- Fella, I don't know who you are...

252
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:30,250
or what you are,
but I don't like the look of this, understand?

253
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,116
Get your hands off me!

254
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:34,822
Look, fella, I said--

255
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,132
Just marvelous!
Now how are we gonna get home?

256
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:51,533
My humble chariot at your service, madam.

257
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:54,967
May I recommend a passion fruit?

258
00:34:56,144 --> 00:34:58,112
Come on, right this way.

259
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,608
I think he broke my nose.

260
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:09,416
Let's just get you to the hospital then.

261
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,359
Hey, you.

262
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,536
Taking the kook to the hospital room!

263
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,573
Yeah, and then to Lana's.

264
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:36,549
What's the matter, lovey?
Why are you sitting on the stairs?

265
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:40,417
Franklin Potter breaking your heart?
I'll have a talk with his mother.

266
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,548
- Do you love me?
- What a question to ask.

267
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:49,494
- What about Daddy?
- Lovey, where is all this going?

268
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:54,558
At the end of summer, I go to school.
When I come back, I'll be a woman.

269
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:58,466
- Yes, but--
- I never had a chance to be young!

270
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,973
Lovey, you are different.

271
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:04,636
Even your father doesn't understand
how you do those things with music.

272
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:09,149
So what? I'm a musical genius.
What a drag! What a bummer!

273
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:11,377
Drag? Bummer?

274
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:14,888
Lovey, you're giving your mother
a migraine.

275
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,880
Diet pills...

276
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,561
sleeping pills, diuretics, Quaaludes...

277
00:36:24,866 --> 00:36:26,766
Valium, there you are.

278
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:29,429
If I'm old enough to be on my own...

279
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:31,836
then I'm old enough
to make my own decisions.

280
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:35,672
I do not wanna play the flute.
I do not wanna go to Juilliard.

281
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:38,235
I do not wanna be paired off
with Franklin Potter.

282
00:36:38,312 --> 00:36:40,280
He is a lecherous jackass!

283
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:44,251
And I never wanna hear
another string quartet again in my life!

284
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:54,724
Now that we know what you don't want...

285
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:58,131
what is it that you do?

286
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:01,733
For now...

287
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,031
I wanna win a Roller Boogie contest
down at the beach.

288
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:10,407
A Roller Boogie contest?

289
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:26,087
I'm sure that you'll accomplish
whatever you put your mind to.

290
00:37:26,194 --> 00:37:28,720
I mean, you always do.

291
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:37,337
I have to meet your father for lunch...

292
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:42,138
and we'll talk. We'll see.

293
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,782
She didn't understand a thing I said.

294
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,135
Hello?

295
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:58,004
Lady, this is a pay phone.

296
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:02,380
You want me to look where?

297
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,508
All right, just a minute.

298
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,350
- You Bobby James?
- Yeah.

299
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:13,825
- It's for you.
- For me?

300
00:40:16,097 --> 00:40:18,191
He'll be here in a minute.

301
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:29,632
Hello?

302
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:33,277
- Good morning.
- Good morning, yourself Who is this?

303
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:35,472
Terry Barkley. Remember me?

304
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:39,016
Sure, I remember you. Why'd you run away?

305
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,180
How'd that guy know
that was me in the window?

306
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:43,690
I love your outfit.

307
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:46,791
Centerfold of Playgirl?

308
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:48,723
Come on, Terry, this is really weird.

309
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:50,662
Blue shorts, how cute.

310
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:53,499
Come on. Where are you?

311
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,802
The parking lot.

312
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,271
How about breakfast?

313
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:08,476
On me.

314
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,782
Sure.

315
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,886
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

316
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:35,128
- Like what?
- Like you're trying to read my mind.

317
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:37,827
I wished I could.

318
00:41:39,766 --> 00:41:42,531
You're dealing with something heavy, right?

319
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:47,299
It's all right. I'm a big girl. I can handle it.

320
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:51,841
Yeah, like running away from home,
and running away from me.

321
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:54,608
You're handling it just great.

322
00:41:56,283 --> 00:41:58,581
I'm sorry I slapped you and ran away.

323
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,285
I was being a real bitch.
And you were handy.

324
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:11,422
I'd still like you to teach me to skate.
Same price?

325
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:16,166
$25 an hour.

326
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,339
All right.

327
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,768
$35.

328
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,743
-$45.
- Sorry I asked.

329
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:34,320
If I teach you to skate, it's because I want to.
You get it?

330
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:37,414
I'll call the shots. Whatever I say, goes.

331
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:40,917
I'm not interested in your money.

332
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:44,760
- Deal?
- Deal.

333
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:49,700
Lillian, where the hell are you?

334
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,933
I'm a basket case,
and you're getting a touchup?

335
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:55,573
All right, I'm sorry.

336
00:42:59,212 --> 00:43:02,011
Look, if she's still in Los Angeles,
we'll find her, okay?

337
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:06,619
All right, now you just tip Mr. Upjohn,
or whoever's doing you...

338
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:08,016
and come home.

339
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:13,919
Lillian, I love her, too.

340
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:16,723
What I want you to do is something like this.

341
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,860
You know keep your arms like that,
then twist something like that.

342
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:22,363
Okay, let's see.

343
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,205
Okay, come on.

344
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:31,373
Okay, now come out of it.

345
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:34,074
That's good. That's real good.

346
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:36,411
Come around here
and get both your hands here.

347
00:43:36,483 --> 00:43:39,646
Turn your body and twist it, okay?
Come straight down.

348
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:52,955
One, two...

349
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,738
One, two, three.

350
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:08,910
I got an idea.

351
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,277
Let's try another trick.

352
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:13,615
- Ready?
- Yeah.

353
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:15,582
One, two, three.

354
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,482
Wait, I got it.

355
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,557
Am I getting better?

356
00:44:24,364 --> 00:44:25,354
No.

357
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:34,697
- That was good, Terry. All right.
- Wait! How do I stop?

358
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:39,607
Okay, Terry, watch.

359
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:53,818
You're looking good.

360
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,958
You are. You look nice. Yeah, you do.

361
00:44:58,965 --> 00:45:01,798
- You planned that.
- I sure did.

362
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,604
Let's call it quits.

363
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:09,158
You know, things are beginning
to make a lot of sense.

364
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:13,362
I can't explain it,
but I think you had a lot to do with it.

365
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:20,003
You learn really fast.
How long have you been skating?

366
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,276
- Three weeks.
- Come on, really?

367
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:26,650
Really, I was an ice skater for years.
I won medals. Watch.

368
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:34,088
I was only 6 years old.

369
00:46:34,961 --> 00:46:36,827
Come on, let's have some fun.

370
00:49:42,882 --> 00:49:45,783
- Let's Cunga!
- Cunga!

371
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,542
Okay, my children,
J.D. is gonna take care of you once again.

372
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,988
We have more music at Jammer's.
Are you ready?

373
00:52:22,942 --> 00:52:26,105
- What's happening, man?
- She lost her lock, man.

374
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:29,372
Wait a minute.
I think I got some in here somewhere.

375
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:34,784
Jammer's got some upstairs. Come up there.

376
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,541
At great inconvenience...

377
00:52:57,644 --> 00:53:01,171
you force me
to make certain facts perfectly clear.

378
00:53:11,724 --> 00:53:14,216
Am I making myself perfectly clear?

379
00:53:25,371 --> 00:53:27,271
It's up here somewhere.

380
00:53:28,942 --> 00:53:31,036
This place is not for sale.

381
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:34,941
We don't need
another shopping mall down here.

382
00:53:35,448 --> 00:53:38,315
You're the last merchant
to hold out, Delany.

383
00:53:38,384 --> 00:53:41,217
There's a lot of important money
at stake down here.

384
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:43,346
That means big investors.

385
00:53:43,756 --> 00:53:46,384
You can't stop progress.

386
00:53:47,593 --> 00:53:49,493
Get out of my office.

387
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:55,195
Something's going down in there.

388
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,307
Some good advice:

389
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:05,272
You take the money and run.

390
00:54:13,553 --> 00:54:17,456
Personally, I abhor violence.

391
00:54:19,258 --> 00:54:21,386
Anything can happen, Delany.

392
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:24,553
Your insurance rating
is already in the danger zone.

393
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:28,963
This place could go up in smoke anytime.
Might even be full of kids.

394
00:54:30,236 --> 00:54:32,728
One can never tell about accidents.

395
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:38,602
Consider my offer. You got 48 hours.
Let's go.

396
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:17,179
Oh, God, I've never been so scared.

397
00:55:17,383 --> 00:55:20,080
The piece that dude had
had gotta be 2 feet long.

398
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:21,882
You guys, wait here.

399
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:26,825
Come on, Jammer, open up!

400
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:37,995
Damn!

401
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:44,903
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm thinking.

402
00:55:46,345 --> 00:55:48,905
Why don't we find the others
and put our heads together?

403
00:55:48,981 --> 00:55:50,574
Let's go. Come on.

404
00:56:23,382 --> 00:56:26,181
- Have you guys seen Terry Barkley?
- Nope.

405
00:56:26,786 --> 00:56:30,381
So how you doing there, Twin Peaks?
Ready for some mountain climbing?

406
00:56:30,456 --> 00:56:34,359
Terry had a really bad scene at home,
and I think she might have run away.

407
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:38,421
- Did you check the bus station?
- The bus station? Please.

408
00:56:42,702 --> 00:56:45,603
We'll just have to stroll along the beach
until she's found.

409
00:56:45,671 --> 00:56:48,003
Until she's safe in the arms
of her loved ones.

410
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:50,771
We won't skate, we won't sleep,
we won't eat.

411
00:56:50,843 --> 00:56:53,540
- We won't eat?
- We won't eat.

412
00:56:55,748 --> 00:56:56,943
Onward!

413
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:14,489
- Jammer, man, what's happening?
- Get out of the way.

414
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:18,496
Everybody out.

415
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,000
Jammer, you're drunk.

416
00:57:21,073 --> 00:57:25,874
Damn it, didn’t you hear me?
I said, everybody out! It's all over.

417
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:29,642
I'm closing this place down for good.

418
00:57:31,651 --> 00:57:34,177
- I'm sorry, kids.
- Wanna drink?

419
00:57:34,253 --> 00:57:35,982
I'm awful sorry.

420
00:57:47,366 --> 00:57:51,166
- All right, so where are they?
- I don't know. We've looked everywhere.

421
00:57:54,006 --> 00:57:56,100
Hey, C.C. What's going on, man?

422
00:57:56,242 --> 00:57:59,337
Jammer closed down the rink.
He's acting crazy.

423
00:57:59,545 --> 00:58:02,708
- Closed down the rink? What the hell for?
- I don't know.

424
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:08,650
- Hey, listen, you guys.
- Barkley!

425
00:58:08,854 --> 00:58:12,449
Look, where have you guys been?
And what's going on over at Jammer's?

426
00:58:12,525 --> 00:58:13,856
Here's the deal.

427
00:58:13,926 --> 00:58:17,021
We got two goons
and a twerpy guy with a $600 suit on.

428
00:58:17,096 --> 00:58:20,396
They want Jammer to sign the contract
or they'll torch the place.

429
00:58:20,466 --> 00:58:22,696
They don't even care if we’re in there or not.

430
00:58:22,768 --> 00:58:24,463
What about Sgt. Danner?

431
00:58:24,537 --> 00:58:27,472
He's always been straight
with the boardwalk scene, right?

432
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,168
No cop's gonna arrest a guy
with a $600 suit on.

433
00:58:30,243 --> 00:58:33,941
Even if they did, there wouldn't be
enough rink left to fill a shoebox.

434
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:37,506
- What about the Boogie Contest?
- Yeah, what about it?

435
00:58:40,519 --> 00:58:43,489
Jammer did it for us.
He did it so no one would get hurt.

436
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:45,923
What Jammer needs is a good shyster.

437
00:58:45,992 --> 00:58:48,051
Barkley's father is a shyster.

438
00:58:48,961 --> 00:58:50,486
I mean, a lawyer.

439
00:58:50,963 --> 00:58:53,898
- Yeah, that's right, Terry.
- Come on, help us out.

440
00:58:57,003 --> 00:59:00,564
Wait, you don't know my father.
Look, I'm the runaway.

441
00:59:04,777 --> 00:59:05,972
Please?

442
00:59:13,052 --> 00:59:16,420
Okay, I'll do it. I'm in trouble anyway, right?

443
00:59:17,189 --> 00:59:18,679
- All right!
- Great.

444
00:59:20,059 --> 00:59:22,653
Captain? Yeah, this is Roger Barkley again.

445
00:59:22,728 --> 00:59:26,460
I know it's late,
but have you heard anything at all?

446
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:28,898
I can't stand it anymore.

447
00:59:28,968 --> 00:59:32,802
Listen, she'll come along.
You know how kids are nowadays.

448
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:35,268
She's just blowing off steam.

449
00:59:37,843 --> 00:59:39,902
Hi, remember me?

450
00:59:45,117 --> 00:59:46,551
Thank you.

451
00:59:48,688 --> 00:59:51,214
Now, before I turn you over to your father...

452
00:59:53,326 --> 00:59:55,658
is there anything you wanna tell me?

453
01:00:01,367 --> 01:00:02,664
Pregnant?

454
01:00:02,735 --> 01:00:06,638
- Mother, I've been gone overnight!
- How long does it take these days?

455
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:09,175
Ms. Barkley, I don't believe you!

456
01:00:13,279 --> 01:00:16,214
All right, go on. Go see your father.

457
01:00:23,556 --> 01:00:25,024
All right, thank you.

458
01:00:27,526 --> 01:00:28,857
Hi, Daddy.

459
01:00:30,896 --> 01:00:33,388
You finally remembered your address.

460
01:00:33,632 --> 01:00:36,966
Daddy, I know it's not the right time,
but I need to talk to you.

461
01:00:37,036 --> 01:00:39,403
I have been worried sick, young lady.

462
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:43,973
All this talk about nobody loving you.
It's the skating, isn't it?

463
01:00:45,578 --> 01:00:48,309
It's that insane disco music thing.

464
01:00:48,914 --> 01:00:53,408
You're an artist, a musical genius.
And I'm not gonna have my daughter...

465
01:01:01,727 --> 01:01:03,855
You do that again, I'll...

466
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:12,532
You get some sleep. Tomorrow's a big day.
Everybody will be there:

467
01:01:12,605 --> 01:01:17,133
-the Music Society, the Philharmonic Club.
- I know, Daddy, but I need to ask a favor.

468
01:01:17,209 --> 01:01:20,179
As long as it's not about skating
or disco music.

469
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:21,714
Lillian, shut up.

470
01:01:23,215 --> 01:01:25,343
Anything, sweetheart, you just name it.

471
01:01:25,418 --> 01:01:29,616
I've got some friends
and they need some legal advice really bad.

472
01:01:30,189 --> 01:01:32,157
Have them call me at the office on Monday.

473
01:01:32,224 --> 01:01:35,421
Could they call tomorrow?
I won't ask for anything else after that.

474
01:01:35,494 --> 01:01:36,984
Why not invite them here?

475
01:01:37,062 --> 01:01:40,521
I mean, I'm sure your father can talk to them
after the recital.

476
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:43,534
For once, Lillian, you're right. Okay.

477
01:01:43,602 --> 01:01:47,732
Honey, any friends of yours
are friends of mine, okay?

478
01:01:49,842 --> 01:01:51,310
Sweet dreams.

479
01:02:02,988 --> 01:02:04,683
Look at these houses.

480
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:11,086
- Whoa, man! I wonder who lives there.
- I don't know. Probably some royal people.

481
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:15,830
You guys,
behave yourselves at this party, okay?

482
01:02:15,901 --> 01:02:17,733
Don't worry, I got class.

483
01:02:17,803 --> 01:02:20,864
Yeah, and everything I know,
I learned from him.

484
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:36,917
- British soldiers?
- This is valet parking, dummy.

485
01:02:37,089 --> 01:02:39,922
Get that heap out of here.
Deliveries are around the back.

486
01:02:39,992 --> 01:02:43,223
- How about I deliver you?
- Come on, Hoppy, cool it.

487
01:02:43,696 --> 01:02:46,393
Check your list for
"Robert James and friends."

488
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:54,202
Right through there.

489
01:02:56,976 --> 01:03:00,207
Yeah, and don't scratch the paint, my man.

490
01:03:09,255 --> 01:03:11,724
- Your wrap, sir.
- Rap?

491
01:03:12,191 --> 01:03:15,422
I got no time to rap, Chief.
Catch me later, okay?

492
01:03:22,701 --> 01:03:24,897
Hey, look! A grass party.

493
01:03:27,506 --> 01:03:29,133
- Cut it out.
- Don't hit him.

494
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:32,269
Hey, cut it out! Act like you belong.

495
01:03:38,517 --> 01:03:41,384
- Behave yourself.
- I'm well-behaved.

496
01:03:47,693 --> 01:03:50,993
- Do you care for an hors d'oeuvre?
- Don't mind if I do.

497
01:03:55,734 --> 01:03:59,932
- Finger sandwiches, my favorite food!
- Hey, get your own, lady!

498
01:04:02,575 --> 01:04:04,100
Did you see what he did?

499
01:04:04,376 --> 01:04:06,310
Give me one of those things.

500
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:10,272
You guys, a little food?

501
01:04:10,749 --> 01:04:12,911
- Look at this.
- Cafeteria.

502
01:04:12,985 --> 01:04:15,579
- I can't find her.
- You will. She's around.

503
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:19,821
Save some for somebody else, would you?

504
01:04:22,428 --> 01:04:24,157
How nice of you to come.

505
01:04:29,034 --> 01:04:31,935
Look what you made me do.
I lost my horse doovers.

506
01:04:32,004 --> 01:04:33,233
Those are the guys.

507
01:04:33,305 --> 01:04:36,002
- What guys?
- The guys in the skating rink.

508
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:38,104
- Where?
- Over there.

509
01:04:40,312 --> 01:04:42,610
- Is Roger here?
- He's up with the musicians.

510
01:04:42,681 --> 01:04:45,412
He's a little nervous, but he'll be all right.

511
01:04:45,484 --> 01:04:48,351
I better get going. I'll see you later.

512
01:04:53,592 --> 01:04:55,686
Sunny, those kids at the table...

513
01:04:57,896 --> 01:05:00,593
they were at the roller rink the other day.

514
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:02,498
Find out why they're here.

515
01:05:04,203 --> 01:05:05,898
Don't cause any trouble.

516
01:05:08,674 --> 01:05:10,904
Let's get the hell out of here.

517
01:05:12,945 --> 01:05:15,971
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.

518
01:05:18,017 --> 01:05:20,952
Thank you for coming
to the final assembly...

519
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,512
of the Barkley Baroque Society.

520
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:28,588
This will be our last formal recital
for our daughter, Theresa.

521
01:05:29,328 --> 01:05:33,026
She has been accepted
to the Juilliard School of Music...

522
01:05:33,098 --> 01:05:34,623
as an Honor Student.

523
01:05:35,067 --> 01:05:37,559
Gentlemen, would you take your seats?

524
01:05:42,107 --> 01:05:43,438
Thank you.

525
01:05:43,742 --> 01:05:46,473
And now, without further ado...

526
01:05:46,545 --> 01:05:49,139
the Barkley String Ensemble...

527
01:05:49,381 --> 01:05:53,579
featuring flautist, Theresa Barkley.

528
01:06:13,639 --> 01:06:15,573
Wow, look at her, Phones.

529
01:06:17,042 --> 01:06:20,012
- Isn't she beautiful?
- Come on, man, let's go.

530
01:06:28,954 --> 01:06:31,446
Excuse me. Sorry, lady.

531
01:06:33,192 --> 01:06:34,489
Excuse me.

532
01:06:35,561 --> 01:06:37,655
Excuse me. Sorry.

533
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:44,068
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Get out of my lap!

534
01:06:49,174 --> 01:06:50,335
Jeez, Hoppy.

535
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,908
Breathe through your nose, Mother.

536
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:07,259
Roger, do something!

537
01:07:10,562 --> 01:07:12,963
- Roger, help me.
- Throw me a rope.

538
01:07:13,031 --> 01:07:14,726
- Throw me anything.
- Here.

539
01:07:18,036 --> 01:07:21,006
Get your hand under her. Push up.

540
01:07:21,073 --> 01:07:23,599
Push her up, Franklin! Come on.

541
01:07:32,785 --> 01:07:34,048
Come on.

542
01:07:35,788 --> 01:07:38,155
Let's go! Over there.

543
01:07:38,924 --> 01:07:40,790
Go around and cut them off.

544
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,927
Let me explain.

545
01:07:52,237 --> 01:07:53,568
I'm sorry.

546
01:08:03,615 --> 01:08:05,413
Let's get out of here.

547
01:08:09,488 --> 01:08:11,217
Bobby, come on!

548
01:08:31,677 --> 01:08:34,510
Roger, do something.

549
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:44,453
- Daddy, I--
- Roger, she was trying to tell you--

550
01:08:44,523 --> 01:08:45,922
Lillian, shut up.

551
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:48,722
This lunacy. Those people in my home.

552
01:08:48,827 --> 01:08:51,956
It's my home, as well,
and you invited them here.

553
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:58,129
And Mr. Thatcher, our client-attorney
relationship nearly ruined...

554
01:08:58,637 --> 01:09:01,129
because of your incredible accusations.

555
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,574
To say nothing of
a $10 million redevelopment investment...

556
01:09:04,643 --> 01:09:08,477
now in jeopardy because of
my daughter's harebrained scheme...

557
01:09:09,181 --> 01:09:12,276
to help all the unwashed in this world.

558
01:09:13,085 --> 01:09:16,715
You are never to see those people again.

559
01:09:16,788 --> 01:09:17,983
Did you hear that?

560
01:09:18,056 --> 01:09:21,117
Daddy, I heard him
threaten to burn down the roller rink...

561
01:09:21,193 --> 01:09:22,991
if Mr. Delany wouldn't sell.

562
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:24,893
My friends heard him, as well.

563
01:09:24,963 --> 01:09:28,263
Impossible to raise children
these days, Roger.

564
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,836
Young lady, I want an immediate apology
to Mr. Thatcher.

565
01:09:31,904 --> 01:09:34,236
What, you're gonna
take his word over mine?

566
01:09:34,306 --> 01:09:38,300
This is not a game.
Now, Theresa, the apology. Right now.

567
01:09:38,377 --> 01:09:42,541
No! I'm not a child to be ordered
to apologize to a thief and a liar!

568
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,089
Lovey, wait!

569
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,107
Sorry, kid, I went to Jammer's myself.

570
01:10:12,311 --> 01:10:14,075
He's not pressing charges.

571
01:10:14,446 --> 01:10:18,280
And the deal is legal.
He signed the contracts this afternoon.

572
01:10:20,352 --> 01:10:22,980
Thanks, Danner.
It was really straight of you.

573
01:10:23,188 --> 01:10:25,589
Yeah. Well, that's progress, kid.

574
01:10:29,895 --> 01:10:32,990
- At least Jammer will do okay.
- Yeah, that's for sure.

575
01:10:33,065 --> 01:10:35,966
- Man, he copped out on us.
- What's one more sell-out?

576
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:38,162
- Shut up!
- Phones is out of a job.

577
01:10:38,236 --> 01:10:40,705
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

578
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:42,464
None of you do.

579
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,403
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I bet.

580
01:10:44,476 --> 01:10:45,966
What's your problem, man?

581
01:10:46,044 --> 01:10:48,342
You got to take a nap
in your little baby carriage?

582
01:10:48,413 --> 01:10:51,439
Bobby, come on,
give us some slack, will you, man?

583
01:10:52,517 --> 01:10:56,112
- Did you get a hold of Terry?
- Not even her maid would talk to me.

584
01:10:57,022 --> 01:10:59,320
Well, maybe it's for the best, man.

585
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:02,793
I mean, maybe she was too rich
for your blood, you know?

586
01:11:37,763 --> 01:11:39,527
Who's that?

587
01:11:43,535 --> 01:11:45,025
It's all over.

588
01:11:47,172 --> 01:11:50,142
But you're gonna be the greatest, Bobby.

589
01:11:50,942 --> 01:11:52,410
The greatest.

590
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,539
I'd like to dedicate this next number
to Jammer Delany.

591
01:15:46,578 --> 01:15:50,537
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just thought you might come here.

592
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:54,449
It's all over. Jammer signed the contract.

593
01:15:57,222 --> 01:16:01,090
You won't need to learn your moves
since there won't be a contest.

594
01:16:01,426 --> 01:16:05,294
You can tell your father that I won't
be messing up his daughter's life anymore.

595
01:16:06,498 --> 01:16:10,435
What the hell! Can you imagine?
What a pair.

596
01:16:11,736 --> 01:16:13,101
I love you.

597
01:16:38,763 --> 01:16:41,926
Dear Bobby, my parents have decided
to send me back East...

598
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,992
to stay with an aunt, before I start Juilliard.

599
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:49,473
Before I go, I had to tell you
that you’re something really special.

600
01:16:50,175 --> 01:16:54,203
I love you, Bobby James.
With all my heart, Terry.

601
01:17:30,215 --> 01:17:31,614
- Mr. Thatcher?
- What is it?

602
01:17:31,683 --> 01:17:35,449
This is Nick.
I got the kid marked, down by the water.

603
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,510
Stay with him.

604
01:17:41,993 --> 01:17:43,483
How's it going, Bob?

605
01:17:45,864 --> 01:17:47,423
How you doing, Bobby?

606
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:54,798
- What's going on, man?
- Where's Phones?

607
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:59,376
I don't know. He gave Hoppy his noise
and said the world stinks. That's all I heard.

608
01:17:59,444 --> 01:18:03,039
The guy's never gonna skate
or listen to boogie music ever again.

609
01:18:08,653 --> 01:18:10,644
Oh, no, there he is!

610
01:18:16,594 --> 01:18:18,255
Can you believe it?

611
01:18:19,864 --> 01:18:21,889
Crazy old Phones, man.

612
01:18:22,133 --> 01:18:24,693
The guy was always recording something
on this thing.

613
01:18:24,769 --> 01:18:27,329
There's a lot of important money
at stake down here.

614
01:18:27,572 --> 01:18:30,405
- Hey, wait a minute, what is this?
- Turn it up.

615
01:18:30,608 --> 01:18:32,474
Anything can happen, Delany.

616
01:18:33,411 --> 01:18:36,676
Your insurance rating
is already in the danger zone.

617
01:18:37,449 --> 01:18:39,474
Do you believe that stuff?

618
01:18:40,018 --> 01:18:41,611
Might even be full of kids.

619
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:45,121
One can never tell about accidents.

620
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:47,315
Consider my offer.

621
01:18:47,425 --> 01:18:49,826
We got them! Damn, we really got them!

622
01:18:49,894 --> 01:18:52,556
Phones left his tape player on
and didn't even know it.

623
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,155
Give me the tape.

624
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:58,426
- What have we got?
- Evidence. We can kill the deal.

625
01:18:58,636 --> 01:19:02,595
But who's gonna believe us?
Those guys got all the money in the world.

626
01:19:02,707 --> 01:19:05,608
Hoppy, give me the keys
to your old man's truck.

627
01:19:05,677 --> 01:19:08,612
Okay, man, but don't eat
any of those Puerto Rican guavas.

628
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,512
Tell Phones to throw away the robe.

629
01:19:10,582 --> 01:19:13,779
Spread the word that the Boogie contest
is on tonight. Let's go.

630
01:19:13,852 --> 01:19:16,253
- All right!
- Big Boogie's on, man!

631
01:19:29,501 --> 01:19:31,993
Put me through to Thatcher. This is Sunny.

632
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:35,835
- I think we got some trouble on this end.
- It's time to act.

633
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,844
God, I hate scenes like this.
Give me another tissue, Barkley.

634
01:19:51,923 --> 01:19:53,914
Barkley, you're so immature.

635
01:19:53,992 --> 01:19:56,620
What are you gonna do without me
in New York?

636
01:19:57,362 --> 01:20:00,332
I'll call home
and ask for advice for the lovelorn.

637
01:20:00,598 --> 01:20:03,829
Give her a month in Manhattan,
she'll be giving you advice.

638
01:20:08,606 --> 01:20:10,267
What does he want?

639
01:20:11,609 --> 01:20:13,907
Bobby, what are you doing here?

640
01:20:14,078 --> 01:20:16,012
- Let's go.
- Shall I call the police?

641
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,707
No, Bobby, wait.

642
01:20:17,782 --> 01:20:20,683
I got all the evidence against Thatcher
on Phones' tape player.

643
01:20:20,752 --> 01:20:22,743
My parents will be here... What tape?

644
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:25,721
I've had just about enough of you, fella.

645
01:20:26,524 --> 01:20:29,550
- Come on, let's go. I'll tell you on the way.
- Let me out!

646
01:20:29,627 --> 01:20:32,722
Wait a minute.
I am not leaving her alone for a moment.

647
01:20:32,797 --> 01:20:36,563
Terry, come on. I'll get you for this, Bobby!
Let me out of here!

648
01:20:36,668 --> 01:20:39,228
Terry, somebody, help me.

649
01:20:41,005 --> 01:20:44,407
Help, Terry! Anybody, come on. Let me out!

650
01:20:44,676 --> 01:20:46,201
Let me out of here!

651
01:20:51,716 --> 01:20:55,152
- Come on, Jammer, don't split, man.
- We're not afraid of those guys.

652
01:20:55,219 --> 01:20:58,519
- We can lick those dudes, man.
- Come on, Jammer, stay.

653
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,854
The tape can prove they threatened you.

654
01:21:01,459 --> 01:21:04,087
All we have to do
is get Sgt. Danner to listen.

655
01:21:04,162 --> 01:21:07,427
- Yeah, man, it was corrosion!
- What he means is "coercion."

656
01:21:07,498 --> 01:21:10,490
How will one more night hurt?
Then you can do what you want.

657
01:21:10,568 --> 01:21:13,697
Everybody's been practicing all year
to get ready for this thing.

658
01:21:13,771 --> 01:21:16,832
Come on, Jammer,
just let us hold the contest tonight.

659
01:21:18,009 --> 01:21:20,000
Listen to me, all of you.

660
01:21:20,612 --> 01:21:23,912
If you think that I can live with the idea...

661
01:21:23,982 --> 01:21:28,351
that one of you kids might get hurt
by a gang of money-hungry goons...

662
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:31,749
then you're in for another think!
No, sir. Not me!

663
01:21:31,823 --> 01:21:34,087
I can't stand that responsibility.

664
01:21:34,559 --> 01:21:37,824
I'm off to Arizona to watch the cactus grow.

665
01:21:38,496 --> 01:21:40,089
That'll take forever.

666
01:21:40,164 --> 01:21:41,689
So long, gang.

667
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,969
I'm gonna miss you all. Take care of him.

668
01:21:45,036 --> 01:21:48,563
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- So long, Jammer.

669
01:21:49,507 --> 01:21:51,407
Don't drink on the road.

670
01:22:07,992 --> 01:22:09,824
Oh, God, I can't stand it.

671
01:22:09,894 --> 01:22:12,886
I can't stand
looking at your hound-dog faces.

672
01:22:14,532 --> 01:22:16,933
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

673
01:22:17,602 --> 01:22:21,630
You can use the rink tonight
for one more time!

674
01:22:23,675 --> 01:22:26,440
One more time!

675
01:22:27,578 --> 01:22:29,239
- Hey, Boss!
- Who's that?

676
01:22:29,313 --> 01:22:30,940
There's Thatcher!

677
01:22:35,453 --> 01:22:39,412
C.C., go to the Boardwalk,
find Danner, tell him to go to the rink, okay?

678
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:41,891
Tell everybody
that the contest is on tonight.

679
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:43,688
Okay, we'll meet you there.

680
01:22:43,761 --> 01:22:46,389
When we get to them, spread out.
I want that tape.

681
01:22:46,464 --> 01:22:49,456
- Let's get the goons with the fruit!
- Get the fruit!

682
01:22:54,972 --> 01:22:57,703
- Hold them up. See you at the rink.
- Good luck, man.

683
01:23:04,036 --> 01:23:06,004
Take off your skirt.

684
01:23:13,412 --> 01:23:14,811
Let's get out of here.

685
01:23:16,749 --> 01:23:19,480
There goes the Barkley girl. Let's cut her off.

686
01:23:41,574 --> 01:23:44,236
- Now what?
- Take my hand and follow me.

687
01:23:45,111 --> 01:23:46,545
It's easy for you to say.

688
01:23:46,612 --> 01:23:49,980
You're headed for the Olympics.
I'm headed for broken bones.

689
01:23:50,049 --> 01:23:51,539
Come on!

690
01:24:02,261 --> 01:24:05,026
- Here they come!
- Come on, let's go!

691
01:24:06,465 --> 01:24:07,830
Hurry up!

692
01:24:08,134 --> 01:24:09,659
Come on, move it, Sunny!

693
01:24:17,843 --> 01:24:19,709
Just stay with them.

694
01:24:29,288 --> 01:24:30,619
Watch out!

695
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,829
Head them off at the next street.

696
01:24:54,013 --> 01:24:55,242
Jump it!

697
01:25:00,586 --> 01:25:02,076
Get after them!

698
01:25:05,991 --> 01:25:08,085
- Down here!
- Down there?

699
01:25:08,194 --> 01:25:09,423
Let's go.

700
01:26:02,715 --> 01:26:04,114
Let's split up.

701
01:26:16,428 --> 01:26:17,589
Watch it!

702
01:26:20,966 --> 01:26:23,196
All right, man. Give me five!

703
01:26:23,269 --> 01:26:24,964
Hey, watch it, man!

704
01:26:49,061 --> 01:26:51,621
- I think we lost them.
- Yeah, that's just great.

705
01:26:51,697 --> 01:26:52,960
I don't know. I don't see them.

706
01:26:53,032 --> 01:26:54,329
- See them?
- Nothing.

707
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,561
Come on.

708
01:26:56,235 --> 01:26:57,396
Let's go.

709
01:26:58,204 --> 01:27:00,366
Hey, wait a minute. There they are!

710
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:42,181
Just wait a minute.

711
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:44,778
They probably skated back to the rink.

712
01:27:44,883 --> 01:27:46,476
Let's try there.

713
01:27:54,693 --> 01:27:56,525
Let's catch a free ride.

714
01:28:10,142 --> 01:28:12,804
Get your head down. Don't let them see you.

715
01:28:24,623 --> 01:28:25,954
There they are.

716
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:45,339
- I don't know where they are.
- Here they are! Right there.

717
01:28:46,078 --> 01:28:47,568
Are you all right?

718
01:28:48,247 --> 01:28:50,944
- I got it.
- Hey, watch it.

719
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,445
Freeze!

720
01:28:57,189 --> 01:28:59,317
All right, Thatcher, all right now.

721
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:02,253
I'll make you a deal.

722
01:29:02,328 --> 01:29:04,558
You let the kids hold their contest...

723
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:07,656
and right after it the rink is all yours, okay?

724
01:29:08,767 --> 01:29:10,030
Shut up, Delany.

725
01:29:12,037 --> 01:29:13,027
Chump!

726
01:29:17,576 --> 01:29:20,739
- Give me the tape, kid.
- Give it to him, Bobby.

727
01:29:37,162 --> 01:29:38,220
Thanks.

728
01:29:39,998 --> 01:29:42,194
You want it? Come and get it.

729
01:29:45,037 --> 01:29:46,630
Get the tape.

730
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:52,072
- Grab the gun!
- Keep them down.

731
01:30:00,753 --> 01:30:03,085
What is this? Some new disco dance?

732
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:09,093
- Why don't you just play the tape?
- Play the tape!

733
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:12,391
All right, all right!

734
01:30:13,332 --> 01:30:15,130
You listen to me.

735
01:30:15,801 --> 01:30:17,599
Now, you listen to me good.

736
01:30:18,804 --> 01:30:23,139
This is an infringement of my legal right,
and I want my lawyer.

737
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:26,539
I want my lawyer now!

738
01:30:26,612 --> 01:30:29,775
Mr. Thatcher, here I am.
Sorry it took me so long to get down here.

739
01:30:29,848 --> 01:30:31,338
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

740
01:30:32,117 --> 01:30:34,609
We'll discuss this later, young lady.

741
01:30:36,054 --> 01:30:39,957
I want my client's immediate release
from this travesty of justice.

742
01:30:40,025 --> 01:30:42,323
This is an illegal kangaroo court.

743
01:30:42,394 --> 01:30:46,126
It has no bearing or standard
in this contractual dispute.

744
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:48,131
Play the tape.

745
01:30:48,801 --> 01:30:52,203
Thatcher Industries is the sole owner
of this property.

746
01:30:53,005 --> 01:30:55,702
All legal papers have been filed
and so noted.

747
01:30:55,774 --> 01:30:59,540
And everyone on these premises
is violating the trespass law.

748
01:30:59,611 --> 01:31:02,876
The deed has been registered and
recorded in and for the county of--

749
01:31:02,948 --> 01:31:05,474
There's a lot of important money
at stake down here.

750
01:31:05,551 --> 01:31:08,418
Big money means big investors.

751
01:31:09,655 --> 01:31:11,885
Turn that off! That's inadmissible evidence!

752
01:31:11,957 --> 01:31:13,948
- Get out of my office.
- Shut up.

753
01:31:14,026 --> 01:31:16,757
Anything can happen, Delany.

754
01:31:17,162 --> 01:31:20,359
Your insurance rating
is already in the danger zone.

755
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:25,632
This place could go up in smoke anytime.
Might even be full of kids.

756
01:31:27,272 --> 01:31:30,264
One can never tell about accidents.

757
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:35,670
Consider my offer. You got 48 hours.

758
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:40,981
What the hell do I pay you for?
Say something.

759
01:31:42,654 --> 01:31:45,680
Well, I think that we have
a clear-cut case here, Mr. Thatcher.

760
01:31:45,757 --> 01:31:47,418
No doubt about it.

761
01:31:49,294 --> 01:31:53,026
There's every indication that the contract...

762
01:31:53,465 --> 01:31:56,457
between Mr. Delany
and Thatcher Industries is...

763
01:31:57,402 --> 01:32:01,896
in my professional opinion,
unequivocally and totally...

764
01:32:04,176 --> 01:32:05,302
invalid.

765
01:32:25,464 --> 01:32:28,399
All right, children,
this is the time we've been waiting for:

766
01:32:28,467 --> 01:32:31,402
the big Boogie contest!

767
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:11,109
Okay, that's it. No more calls.
We do have a winner.

768
01:37:11,216 --> 01:37:13,617
Contestants, come forward, please.

769
01:37:21,726 --> 01:37:24,388
For being more than just the best dancers...

770
01:37:24,462 --> 01:37:27,693
for bringing inspiration
and the true spirit of music...

771
01:37:27,766 --> 01:37:30,394
the Roller Boogie grand award goes to:

772
01:37:30,836 --> 01:37:32,600
Terry and Bobby.

773
01:38:31,663 --> 01:38:33,631
Bobby, Terry's coming, man.

774
01:38:37,068 --> 01:38:39,662
- You guys, let's split.
- Okay.

775
01:39:16,408 --> 01:39:18,103
That time already?

776
01:39:19,978 --> 01:39:22,003
I wanted you to have this.

777
01:39:22,514 --> 01:39:25,916
My place is too small.
Why don't you keep it?

778
01:39:30,855 --> 01:39:33,187
There's no room in the suitcase.

779
01:39:43,802 --> 01:39:45,861
Do you have my new address?

780
01:39:49,541 --> 01:39:50,975
Yeah, I got it.

781
01:39:51,776 --> 01:39:53,335
You got mine?

782
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:59,509
It's in my flute case, so I'll see it all the time.

783
01:40:03,755 --> 01:40:06,520
You're gonna be big, Bobby James.

784
01:40:07,492 --> 01:40:10,223
I'll read about you in the papers someday:

785
01:40:10,528 --> 01:40:12,860
"Famous skater wins gold medal."

786
01:40:13,999 --> 01:40:17,833
Sure. Might even get to New York sometime.

787
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:20,295
You never know.

788
01:40:20,939 --> 01:40:22,464
Never know.

789
01:41:20,999 --> 01:41:21,989
Bye.
