1
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,080
All right, we've got
to get back to the boat.

2
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,754
Come through here.

3
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,505
Strip down.

4
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,781
Open up.

5
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,139
Welcome to Alcatraz.

6
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,092
Inside, B and C! Count them!

7
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:45,694
-25 on inside C, first tier.
-20, inside B, first tier.

8
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:50,025
-23 on inside C, second tier.
-17, inside B, second tier.

9
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,873
Bring out, inside B and C.

10
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,802
Move!

11
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,231
You'd better button your collar, boy.

12
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,401
No forks...

13
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,823
-Hey... No forks?
-You see any?

14
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,162
Fresh fish, do you want your pasta?

15
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,618
Hey! Do you want your pasta?

16
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,213
Do you see any?

17
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,049
I see pasta in my sleep.

18
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,125
I'm Litmus.

19
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,298
Like litmus paper.

20
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,770
When it's cold, my face gets blue.
When it's hot, my face gets red.

21
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,671
Inside C! Move out.

22
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,009
Warden wants to see you.

23
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,502
-Name?
-Morris.

24
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,545
That's funny.

25
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,010
This file says Frank Lee Morris.

26
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,811
If you disobey the rules of society,
they send you to prison.

27
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,061
If you disobey the rules of the prison,
they send you to us.

28
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:45,574
Alcatraz is not like any other prison
in the United States.

29
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:51,156
Here, every inmate is confined alone

30
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,535
to an individual cell.

31
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,085
Unlike my predecessors,
Wardens Johnston and Blackwell,

32
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:05,798
I don't have good conduct
programmes or inmate councils.

33
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,644
Inmates here have no say in what
they do. They do as they're told.

34
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:15,604
Newspapers, magazines
or carrying news are not permitted.

35
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,612
Knowledge of the outside world is
what we tell you.

36
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,240
From this day on

37
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:29,198
your world will be everything that
happens in this building.

38
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,420
You will shave once a day.
You will shower twice a week.

39
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,461
You will cut your hair once a month.

40
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,625
Now...

41
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,215
Privileges...
You can talk. You can work.

42
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,470
Other institutions hand out work,
but here it's a privilege you must earn.

43
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:52,142
I promise you,
it's a privilege that you'll want.

44
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,892
Visitors, you're allowed two a month.

45
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:59,148
They cannot be former inmates of this
or any other federal prison.

46
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:03,492
All names that you submit
will be carefully checked by the F.B.I.

47
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,240
What names do you have in mind?

48
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,989
I can't think of any, offhand.

49
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,580
Family members?

50
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,830
None. No family.

51
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,501
Alcatraz is...

52
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:26,802
...a maximum security prison
with very few privileges.

53
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,847
We don't make good citizens,
but we make good prisoners.

54
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:38,057
Burglary,
armed robbery, grand larceny...

55
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,685
You've escaped from
quite a few prisons, haven't you?

56
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,530
That's why you're here.

57
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:50,572
Alcatraz was built to keep
all the rotten eggs in one basket.

58
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,750
I was chosen to make sure that the
stink from the basket doesn't escape.

59
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,455
A few people have tried to escape.
Most of them have been recaptured.

60
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:06,214
Those that haven't have been killed
or drowned in the bay.

61
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,680
No one has ever
escaped from Alcatraz.

62
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,056
And no one ever will.

63
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,971
-Do you two go everywhere together?
-Sure, even to bed together.

64
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:43,603
And when I wash, he washes.
That way we sleep nice together.

65
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,575
I'm Wolf.

66
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:11,377
-Where did they transfer you from?
-Atlanta.

67
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,681
Nice town, Atlanta.

68
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,394
I never saw it.

69
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,226
I'm looking for a new punk.

70
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,199
Good luck.

71
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,328
You don't understand. I just found her.

72
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,625
Why don't you show her
what you can do?

73
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,816
Morris, I need somebody in the library.

74
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,664
-Yes, Captain.
-Move!

75
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,888
-What do you want, boy?
-Bull sent me down here to work.

76
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,807
Can you read, boy?

77
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,401
As long as it's in
the English language, boy.

78
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,784
Do you treat them all like Wolf?

79
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,737
Wolf wanted to get friendly. I didn't.

80
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,452
You'll take that cart to the cells.

81
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,622
Don't they let cons down here?

82
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,457
-Do you see any chairs?
-How come?

83
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,956
'Cause this is the Rock, man.

84
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,799
They want you doing anything here
but time.

85
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,425
Hard, freaking time.

86
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,515
The Rock affects dudes differently.

87
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,612
It either brings out your strength
or it breaks you.

88
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,400
What'd it do for you?

89
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,695
-What happens when you get out?
-I won't.

90
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,332
Ten years ago

91
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,875
I was in this bar in Alabama,
when two dudes started hassling me.

92
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,340
That was their first mistake.

93
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,014
They pulled knives.
That was their second mistake.

94
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:07,097
They didn't know how to use them. That
was the last mistake they ever made.

95
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:12,854
I got two 99 year sentences.
Back to back.

96
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,688
Seems like you
could have pleaded self-defense.

97
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:25,197
The dudes were white, man.
Just like you.

98
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,379
When I arrived here, they put me
in one of those dark cells in D block.

99
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:39,297
After a while I went stir-crazy.
Slashed my Achilles tendon to get out.

100
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,262
You'll see why, when you see D block.

101
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,809
Tell me something.
Are you through killing white guys?

102
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,391
-Why?
-Oh, I don't know...

103
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,729
I just figured, maybe next time,
I wouldn't turn my back on you.

104
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:07,584
-What's your name, man?
-Frank. What's yours?

105
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,575
-English.
-See you later.

106
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,470
-Your name?
-Morris.

107
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,621
-Magazine or a book?
-Where's English?

108
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:52,945
What did they do?
Give a nigger a nigger of his own?

109
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,839
Magazine?

110
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,344
Hi, I'm Bugsy.

111
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,894
-Magazine or book?
-Thanks.

112
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,306
-You're new.
-Yeah.

113
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,519
Wait a minute! I haven't seen
a new guy in six months.

114
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:20,397
It's nice to talk to people.
How are the Brooklyn Dodgers doing?

115
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:24,034
-They moved to L.A. two years ago.
-Are you kidding?

116
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,124
Warden don't allow books
in these cells.

117
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
How come?

118
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,695
There's no light in them.

119
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:38,118
You better deliver them books, Morris,
where they can be read.

120
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,085
Right.

121
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,397
-What's the flower?
-That's something inside me

122
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,401
that they can't lock up
with their bars and walls.

123
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm Doc.

124
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,747
-Do you ever paint?
-No.

125
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,711
Why not?

126
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,383
Are you scared of dying?

127
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,722
-I don't think so.
-You'd better be.

128
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,768
You hurt Wolf. Wolf's going to hurt you.

129
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,276
Where are you going, Cracker?

130
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,124
Street!

131
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,262
Something special about those steps?

132
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,263
The higher you sit,
the more status you've got.

133
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:15,887
We play King of the Mountain,
except here we don't play for fun.

134
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:20,523
-And you're king?
-Yeah.

135
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:31,324
I figure there's two reasons
why you didn't sit down on my step.

136
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,080
Either you're too scared,
or you just hate niggers.

137
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,919
Now, which is it, boy? You too scared?

138
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,546
I just hate niggers.

139
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,072
So no one's ever busted out?

140
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,565
No one's ever made it.

141
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,986
Everyone here has looked for
a way out, but there ain't any.

142
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,869
See those hacks?

143
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,670
Most joints have one hack
for every seven cons.

144
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,841
There's one hack
for every three cons here.

145
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,965
If you start shitting at night instead of
in the morning, they want to know why.

146
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,640
But let's say
you're going to try it anyway.

147
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,181
First, you've got to get out of the cell.

148
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:48,901
Each bar has six hard smaller bars
set in a steel tube

149
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,194
with extra steel poured in.

150
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,447
And there ain't no way
to tunnel out either.

151
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,317
Shit!

152
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,947
This island is solid rock.

153
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,538
See that water?

154
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:13,553
There's over a mile's swim to land.
And the currents make it seem like 10.

155
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,050
And the water's so cold it will numb
your arms in a matter of minutes.

156
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,639
And even if you are a good swimmer,
you won't have the time to make it.

157
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:29,306
There are 12 counts every day.

158
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,740
Sometimes I think
that's all this shithole is.

159
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,068
One long count.

160
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,197
We count the hours, the bulls count us,

161
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,906
and the king bulls count the counts.

162
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:51,293
Inside! Everybody in!

163
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,473
I'm assigning you a permanent job.

164
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,438
The carpentry shop. It's a paying job.

165
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,022
-How much?
-15 cents an hour.

166
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:18,613
-I always knew crime would pay.
-It's a job.

167
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,790
See you later.

168
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:35,918
I slept lousy last night. But I sniff
the glue. It helps pass the nights.

169
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:42,182
-What if they shake down your cell?
-I go to the hole. It's worth the chance.

170
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,849
I guess anything you want bad enough
is worth the chance.

171
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,806
Including busting out?

172
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:54,153
Maybe there's a way out.
It's on top of your head.

173
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,281
The ventilator shafts
on top of our block.

174
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,990
-How do you get on top of the block?
-Ask the bull for the key.

175
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,582
Thanks.

176
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:12,672
Hey, you jive dude!
Where are you going?

177
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,970
Summer's coming on.
It's getting cooler.

178
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,467
The weather here's as crazy
as the Rock. Maybe crazier.

179
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,557
Mark Twain wrote that
the coldest winter he ever spent

180
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,517
was a summer
in San Francisco. I can...

181
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,197
-Wolf's coming at you.
-Is his hand cupped?

182
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
It is.

183
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,783
-Which one?
-His right.

184
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,468
Break off!

185
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,060
Drop it, Wolf!

186
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,521
Drop it, Wolf.

187
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,371
Do you like D block, Wolf?
Well, you'd better.

188
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:36,036
'Cause you're going to rot in there
for a long time.

189
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:38,667
D block, Morris.

190
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,918
-He came at me.
-I said D block.

191
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:09,493
-When I get out of here, you're dead.
-You may be dead before you get out.

192
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,534
Warden don't like inmates fighting.

193
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:30,407
He don't like them
stinking up their cells, either.

194
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,680
Lights out!

195
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,428
You're going back to your cell.

196
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,620
Welcome to Alcatraz.

197
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,760
-Is anybody over there?
-Yeah, me.

198
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,925
-Come on up front, say hello.
-I'm busy.

199
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:40,391
How busy can you be
in one of these closets?

200
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,441
Don't worry, I washed it.

201
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,697
How are you doing, neighbour?
I'm Charley Butts.

202
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:05,752
-Smallest cell I've ever been in.
-You'll get used to it.

203
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:10,501
I don't think so. I don't like living alone
in one of these cells.

204
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,797
You'll get used to that, too.

205
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,710
Breakdown!

206
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,181
Yard time!

207
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,319
Button the collar, too.

208
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,700
-Who's the new fish?
-I've got him in next to me.

209
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,487
-What's your name, kid?
-Charley Butts.

210
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:48,367
-Charley's butt?
-Butts. Butts. Charley Butts.

211
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,290
You've got a funny frigging name.

212
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,669
-What's your name?
-Al Capone.

213
00:36:56,006 --> 00:37:00,716
-I thought you were dead.
-I've got too much money, I'll never die.

214
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:04,387
-Say... You play poker?
-Not much.

215
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,636
I just learned myself.
We'll play tomorrow. See you later, kid.

216
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,773
See you later, Al.

217
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,480
-I don't believe I just met Al Capone.
-I don't either.

218
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,820
I'm Doc.

219
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,658
-Charley Butts.
-How's the painting going?

220
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,240
The one of the Warden?
It's nearly finished.

221
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,578
-Are you painting the Warden?
-Very inspiring.

222
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,069
Inside! Everybody in!

223
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,285
Yes, sir?

224
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:54,672
I want painting privileges
taken away from Chester Dalton.

225
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,248
-Doc?
-Cell 233.

226
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,464
-What's the reason?
-You're the deputy warden.

227
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,260
You think of one.

228
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:09,096
-When is the suspension to begin?
-Not suspension. Elimination.

229
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,940
-Right away.
-Yes, sir.

230
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,953
Your painting privileges
have been removed.

231
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,581
-Why?
-I don't know.

232
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,484
Painting's all I have!

233
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,395
I'm sorry, Doc.

234
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,894
You okay, Doc?

235
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,354
I think there's something wrong
with him.

236
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:25,475
If I were you, I'd keep my eye on Doc.
He seems pretty upset.

237
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:29,277
Cons are always upset
about something. Put your overalls on.

238
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,620
Mr Zimmerman.

239
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:39,246
I'm making a new table,
I need a hatchet.

240
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,917
Bob! Get Doc a hatchet.

241
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,071
Mr Zimmerman!

242
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:18,906
Will you come over here for a minute?

243
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,185
Get him out of here! Get him out!

244
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,318
Take him out of here. Get him out!

245
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:00,702
Get back to work!

246
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,381
Let's go. Move!

247
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,705
Everybody, back to work! Let's go!

248
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,976
Here. Put that in your report.

249
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,798
What were you doing back there?

250
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,932
-How about a magazine?
-Why not?

251
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,472
What do you want?

252
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:28,813
I've got Boy's Life. I know some
queens who fight over it every month.

253
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,846
Just give me
what you've got on top, there.

254
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,648
I heard about Doc.

255
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,834
And I know why he did it.

256
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,210
Somebody took away
his painting privileges.

257
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,630
Who?

258
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,506
The Warden.

259
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,187
Morris!

260
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:23,071
I hear there was a slight accident
in one of the shops.

261
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:26,066
Accident? Oh, you mean Doc.

262
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:31,577
Someone didn't like his paintings,
so he didn't let him paint any more.

263
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:35,833
Someone should have warned Doc
to be careful about what he painted.

264
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:42,008
You're right. There's always a possibility
that some asshole will be offended.

265
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,802
-Isn't there?
-We all have to be careful.

266
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,307
Back in line.

267
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,030
How is it going, Frank?

268
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,736
Well, well... If it isn't the Anglins.

269
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:13,661
-Are you just dropping by?
-We thought we'd pay you a visit.

270
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,169
-Are you going to stay long?
-No, not long.

271
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,504
-Only 15 or 20 years.
-Why the Rock?

272
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:25,125
We were going over the wall in Atlanta
when we encountered a problem.

273
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,178
-Such as?
-They saw us.

274
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,642
-That does present a problem.
-They shipped us to Leavenworth.

275
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,314
We didn't like
their accommodations either.

276
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:38,686
Warden said he knew
just the place for us. Alcatraz.

277
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,528
Is it true no one's ever bust out of here?

278
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,864
So they tell me.

279
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:50,327
Jesus... Wonder what I'd be like
after 15 years here.

280
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:02,229
-You still reading that Bible?
-It's opening up new doors.

281
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,750
I turn 35 today. Some birthday...

282
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,421
-When's your birthday?
-I don't know.

283
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,592
-What kind of childhood did you have?
-Short.

284
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:41,896
I always wanted to see San Francisco.
I never thought it would be like this.

285
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,691
What did you get sent to the Rock for?

286
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,112
A couple of years ago,
I started stealing cars.

287
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:54,026
Sometimes I'd strip them and sell
the parts. Got sent to the State Pen.

288
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,410
-Did you end up in Alcatraz for that?
-Not exactly.

289
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:03,916
There was a bull there that pushed me
around, so when I got out I stole his car.

290
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:09,384
Unfortunately, I drove across the
state line, which made it a federal rap.

291
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,587
The bull saw to it
that I was sent to the Rock.

292
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:18,768
English! Visitor for you.

293
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,693
Butts. You've got a visitor.

294
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,479
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

295
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,687
Probably somebody
who wants their car back.

296
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,804
Hello, father.

297
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,811
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

298
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,351
I was afraid you wouldn't let me.

299
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,435
It's just hard to see you like this.

300
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,700
Your momma's going to die.

301
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,594
Charley...

302
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:37,758
-When?
-Well, she's got a few months.

303
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:45,685
-Can you call her?
-We can't make any phone calls.

304
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:50,271
It's not allowed to discuss the rules of
the prison. Stick to your personal life.

305
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,819
This is my personal life.
Do you get a kick out of it?

306
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:58,034
Hello? Hello!

307
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:07,712
I love you, Charley.

308
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:38,572
-Frank?
-Yeah.

309
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:42,242
If you ever try to get out of here,
I want in.

310
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,261
-Must be Wednesday.
-Why?

311
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:07,677
Mystery mounds. We always have
mystery mounds on Wednesday.

312
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,515
I can't taste it. I just eat out of habit.

313
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:19,645
-What's the movie this weekend?
-Some cowboy piece of shit.

314
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:24,160
Hey! At least they could show us
a gangster movie.

315
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,333
I may have found a way out of here.

316
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,130
You looking at something?

317
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,230
The way I figure it,
this cell block is really getting old.

318
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:56,022
The moist air is corroding the concrete,
and the salt is rusting the metal.

319
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:01,277
I took a nail clipper. I dug around
the grille in the back of the cell.

320
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,656
With some work I can dig that grille
out of there, enlarge the hole

321
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:11,124
and get into the utility corridor,
that might lead to the roof.

322
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:14,584
How will we hide the hole
while we're working on it?

323
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:20,466
We can tear the ads out of magazines
and make cardboard out of them.

324
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,181
Paint grilles on that
and put it back in the hole.

325
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:27,642
Maybe partially obscure it with a towel
or a bathrobe or whatever.

326
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:31,733
I've ordered an accordion, which I'm
going to put in front of my hole.

327
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:36,810
If we get out of the cell house, they'll
know we're gone at the next count.

328
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:41,359
We'll leave at night. That way,
they won't know 'til the morning.

329
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:46,568
We have to make dummy heads
out of plaster, cardboard or whatever.

330
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,076
Put them in the bunks,
and the guards won't know.

331
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:54,582
You work in the barber shop.
You can get the hair.

332
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:59,208
-How do we get across the bay?
-You work in the clothing shop.

333
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,876
You're going to steal some raincoats
and some contact cement.

334
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:10,559
We'll make life rafts and life preservers.
I read about it in Popular Mechanics.

335
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,892
They're going to think we go to Frisco.

336
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,688
We won't.
We'll go to Angel Island instead.

337
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,606
What about me?

338
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:26,487
You'll stand guard while I dig.
I'll stand guard while you dig.

339
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,825
You two trade off the same way.

340
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,125
-What are our chances?
-Slim.

341
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,550
-I'm in.
-Me, too.

342
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:43,052
I want to go.

343
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:56,772
-Charley.
-Yeah.

344
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:00,476
I'm going to start digging,
so keep an eye out for the bulls.

345
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:03,436
If you see one coming,
you start whistling.

346
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:04,051
-How's it going?
-Fair.

347
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,604
Whoever named this place
the Rock wasn't kidding.

348
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,444
Working with those nail clippers
just doesn't have any grip.

349
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,672
Hey, guard.

350
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:44,917
Yeah?

351
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:49,053
Can I exchange this spoon? Looks like
it's been sticking in someone's ass.

352
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,390
And I want to ask about
working in the kitchen.

353
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,518
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

354
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,570
-I want to join the kitchen detail.
-Can you cook?

355
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:14,986
-Can I turn this spoon in for another?
-You're goddamn right, I can cook!

356
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:20,785
I used to be a cook in a cafe in Georgia.
Everybody loved my meatballs.

357
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:25,634
-Did you quit or get fired?
-Neither. I robbed the cafe.

358
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:45,768
-Heard you had a visitor.
-My daughter. She's getting married.

359
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:50,614
He's white. Just like you.

360
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,403
Congratulations.

361
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:58,197
-Want a magazine?
-Yeah. What do you recommend?

362
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,365
Ebony.

363
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,172
Hey, English...

364
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,934
Is it possible to weld two pieces of
metal together, here in the cell?

365
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:21,604
For digging or sticking?

366
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,266
Digging.

367
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:31,646
It ain't easy, but I could show you.
Planning on going somewhere?

368
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:41,833
There hasn't been a day that I've been
here, that I didn't think of busting out.

369
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:47,331
If I'd known, when I slashed my tendon,
I'd have slashed my throat instead.

370
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,681
-Hey, Litmus. Can you get me a dime?
-No problem.

371
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,966
-Cost you 10 desserts.
-I need it tonight.

372
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,929
No problem. Cost you extra five.

373
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,020
If you get me a dime,
I'll toss in 10 beetles for your mouse.

374
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,355
Thanks.

375
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,135
Hey, Frank. What's burning?

376
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:57,862
If you see one of those bulls coming,
you just start whistling.

377
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,011
Hey, Spoof. What's for breakfast?

378
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:41,422
I smell something burning.

379
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,878
I don't smell anything.

380
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:50,046
It must be in my imagination. Working
nights gets to you after a while.

381
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,720
You ought to try it from my side.

382
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,786
Keep an eye out, he may be back.

383
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:08,047
Do you think the grille's welded
on two hook anchors?

384
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,054
If I get a wedge from the carpentry shop

385
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:14,045
I may be able to knock them loose.

386
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,073
This might just be what I'm looking for.

387
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:34,072
-It won't get through the metal detector.
-I know.

388
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:46,335
-Morris, hold it.
-I made it for a clothes peg.

389
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:51,091
-Why the metal over the edge?
-So the clothes would slide off easy.

390
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,297
I don't believe you.

391
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:57,216
I didn't try to hide it. Why would I try to
take metal through a metal detector?

392
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,064
Because you're stupid.

393
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:03,887
Move it.

394
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,081
Open up 107.

395
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:58,502
What did you order this stuff for?
You don't look like the painting type.

396
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,130
You wouldn't know talent
if it looked you in the face.

397
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,547
I'm looking you in the face,
and I don't see jack shit.

398
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,151
Hair. Your color.

399
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,778
Frank.

400
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,122
Paint. One of them's flesh colored.

401
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:34,543
-What are you painting?
-I don't know. The ocean, maybe.

402
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:39,628
If you're using flesh colored paint,
you'd better paint a portrait.

403
01:15:55,801 --> 01:16:00,811
Frank!

404
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:18,320
-Morris go to sleep early tonight?
-Yeah. He wasn't feeling well.

405
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:21,658
He must sleep pretty soundly.
He hasn't moved.

406
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:51,441
Morris?

407
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:54,614
Yeah. What's up?

408
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,698
I went up on top last night.

409
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:05,578
I saw the ventilator shaft to the roof.

410
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,160
I can't reach it, I might need a boost.

411
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:13,711
-How are you all coming?
-My dummy's ready.

412
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:17,045
The hole's done.
I'm just starting the dummy.

413
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:20,298
I ain't doing too good.

414
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,140
Tonight, John and I'll go up.

415
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:36,114
Can you get the raincoats? We
might as well start hauling them up.

416
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:39,735
I'll wear one
back from the shop each day.

417
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:43,615
There's a different hack in the
afternoon. He'll think I wore it to work.

418
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:48,577
-Can you get that contact cement?
-I keep inventory.

419
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,653
Give me a boost.

420
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,985
The bars feel pretty solid.

421
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:10,445
Seems to be a metal hood
riveted onto iron uprights.

422
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:14,745
We can spread the bars with a pipe,
and knock the hood off.

423
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:20,087
There's an electrical outlet here.

424
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:24,764
If we could get a motor and a drill bit,
a flashlight, we'd have it all.

425
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:27,385
Where's the nearest hardware store?

426
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:50,909
Could you get me an extension cord
and a drill bit out of the shop?

427
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,496
If they find out, I go to the hole.

428
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:59,884
All right. But from now on,
you put your desserts onto my tray.

429
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,551
Time's up! Back to the cells.

430
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,928
Damn it! Just when I thought
we was doing good.

431
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,731
I can use this.

432
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:20,356
Are you crazy?

433
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,088
Hold it, Morris!

434
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:55,144
I want to take a look at
one of those cases.

435
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,605
Try this one.

436
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:09,363
Let's open it up.

437
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:23,128
I stole this pen light from the Doc.

438
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,066
Give me a boost.

439
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,251
Pipe.

440
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:16,295
Okay... Hand me the drill.

441
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,034
It's all through.

442
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,709
Fire!

443
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:35,668
Hey! 50 millimeter guns.

444
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:43,045
I'm worried about the shakedowns.
My cardboard grille keeps slipping out.

445
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:48,564
Put some contact cement around the
edges. That should take care of it.

446
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:57,073
How's the rafts
and the life jackets coming?

447
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:01,741
Okay. I think they'll be done Tuesday.

448
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:06,329
Tuesday night we go.

449
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,731
-What's that for?
-I was just thinking about Doc.

450
01:26:31,061 --> 01:26:35,111
We planted those chrysanthemums
15 years ago.

451
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:38,612
They meant a lot to Doc. To me, too.

452
01:26:38,735 --> 01:26:41,855
-I had a garden once.
-What did you grow? Weeds?

453
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:45,414
It's against regulations, Morris,
and you know it.

454
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,296
Stretcher!

455
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:05,755
-I'll get the medics.
-He won't need one.

456
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:21,191
Some men are destined
never to leave Alcatraz

457
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:25,411
alive.

458
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,760
-Got those books that may help you.
-Thanks.

459
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:51,099
-See you later, man.
-Goodbye, boy.

460
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:13,329
So long, boy.

461
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:30,889
Shakedown.

462
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,560
Move. Move, move, move.

463
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:53,624
Take a seat.

464
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:39,916
-Have you been playing this thing long?
-A couple of months.

465
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:45,464
-You any good?
-Terrible.

466
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:50,472
You'll get better.

467
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:01,944
Excuse me.

468
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:13,412
That's one of the benefits of Alcatraz.

469
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:16,413
Lots of time to practice.

470
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:24,711
Has Morris been doing
anything unusual recently?

471
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:28,046
Sometimes he stays up late,
talking with Butts.

472
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,877
-Split them up. Move Morris.
-Yes, sir.

473
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:36,638
I'll have to get a cell ready
and do the paperwork.

474
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,015
We could move him, say Wednesday.

475
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:43,352
-Tuesday morning.
-Yes, sir.

476
01:30:56,576 --> 01:31:01,366
I missed you, Morris. I missed you
so much, I've got a present for you.

477
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:05,543
I'll give it to you later.

478
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,380
Get your ass back here!

479
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:19,308
He'll kill you. Or you'll have to kill him.

480
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:24,903
Yeah, well, I'm not going to
give him the chance.

481
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:29,233
Can you get the rafts and
the life jackets ready to go by tonight?

482
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:34,567
We'll all meet on top,
as soon as lights are out.

483
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:55,625
-Wolf. You carrying?
-Who? Me?

484
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:01,930
Move out.

485
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:46,484
-Where are you going, Wolfie?
-I'm just going for a walk.

486
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:49,522
Let's take that walk.

487
01:32:57,656 --> 01:33:02,986
After six months in the hole,
you could use some exercise.

488
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,594
-Butts!
-I'll meet you up on top.

489
01:33:18,468 --> 01:33:19,798
Let's go.

490
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,400
Yeah... You're going, too.

491
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:05,951
Butts?

492
01:35:10,914 --> 01:35:12,714
Butts, goddamn it.

493
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:20,069
I can't risk tearing this gear.
What's left of it...

494
01:41:20,199 --> 01:41:22,449
Throw me this stuff when I get over.

495
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:10,537
Watch the barbed wire.

496
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,950
Get up, Morris. It's moving day.

497
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:14,867
I said get up, Morris. Open up 109.

498
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:20,579
Goddamn it, Morris! I said...

499
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:23,876
Jesus Christ!

500
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:05,498
Morning, Sergeant. What have you got?

501
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:10,918
Photos and a notebook of Clarence
Anglin. The bag's made from a raincoat.

502
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:15,845
-It would appear that they drowned.
-Why?

503
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:18,933
If that was important enough to
take along, they wouldn't have lost it.

504
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,176
Maybe they lost it
to look like they drowned.

505
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:08,900
Warden, we just got
a message from the Director.

506
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:10,936
He wants you on
the next plane to Washington.

507
01:48:11,277 --> 01:48:16,157
-Do chrysanthemums grow here?
-Not here on Angel Island. Why?

508
01:48:16,907 --> 01:48:18,277
I'm curious.

509
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:24,407
The tides were mild
and the fog light last night.

510
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:30,336
If they left at lights out, they had
a nine-and-a-half hour head start.

511
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:35,012
-I wonder if they made it.
-They drowned.

512
01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:39,103
Yes, sir.
