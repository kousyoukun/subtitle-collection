1
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:13,576
- We got to get back.
- See ya, Matt.

2
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:20,256
Come through here.

3
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:30,496
Strip down.

4
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,216
Open up.

5
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:35,936
Welcome to Alcatraz.

6
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:02,656
Inside B and C! Count them!

7
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:22,176
- 25 on inside C, first tier.
- 20 inside B, first tier.

8
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:26,496
- 23 on inside C, second tier.
- 17 inside B, second tier.

9
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:34,336
Break out! Inside B and C.

10
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,016
Move!

11
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:55,056
Better button your collar, boy.

12
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:42,776
No forks.

13
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:46,216
Hey, no forks.

14
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:48,416
Do you see any?

15
00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:35,896
Fresh fish, you want your pasta?

16
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:38,176
Hey, you want your pasta?

17
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,056
Do you see any?

18
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:46,256
I see pasta in my sleep.

19
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,656
I'm Litmus.

20
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,736
Like litmus paper.

21
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,616
When it's cold, my face gets blue.

22
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,536
When it's hot, my face gets red.

23
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:57,896
Inside C, move out.

24
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:12,576
Warden wants to see you.

25
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,776
- Name?
- Morris.

26
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:42,656
That's funny.

27
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:47,056
This file says Frank Lee Morris.

28
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:56,536
If you disobey the rules of society,
they send you to prison.

29
00:12:56,656 --> 00:13:00,616
If you disobey the rules of prison,
they send you to us.

30
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:10,496
Alcatraz is not like any other
prison in the United States.

31
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:16,296
Here, every inmate is confined alone

32
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:19,496
to an individual cell.

33
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,416
Unlike my predecessors,

34
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:23,336
wardens Johnson and Blackwell,

35
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:26,256
I don't have good conduct programs.

36
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:29,136
I do not have inmate councils.

37
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:32,216
Inmates have no say in what they do.

38
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:34,136
They do as they're told.

39
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:36,056
You are not permitted

40
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:38,736
to have newspapers
or magazines carrying news.

41
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:42,416
Knowledge of the outside world
is what we tell you.

42
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:47,376
From this day on,

43
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:52,936
your world will be everything
that happens in this building.

44
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:55,256
You will shave once a day.

45
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,456
You will shower twice a week.

46
00:13:57,576 --> 00:14:00,216
You will cut your hair once a month.

47
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,976
Now, your privileges.

48
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:07,056
You can talk. You can work.
Other institutions hand out work,

49
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:10,016
but here it's a privilege
that you earn.

50
00:14:10,136 --> 00:14:13,416
I promise you it's
a privilege that you'll want.

51
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:15,776
Visitors -
you're allowed two a month.

52
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,976
They cannot be former inmates
of this or any other federal prison.

53
00:14:20,056 --> 00:14:24,416
All names that you submit will
be carefully checked by the FBI.

54
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,136
What names do you have in mind?

55
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:30,616
I can't think of any offhand.

56
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,136
Family members?

57
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,816
None. No family.

58
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:44,496
Alcatraz is
a maximum security prison

59
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:47,416
with very few privileges.

60
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:49,296
We don't make good citizens,

61
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,656
but we make good prisoners.

62
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:55,416
Burglary, armed robbery,

63
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,336
grand larceny...

64
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,776
You've escaped from
quite a few prisons, haven't you?

65
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:05,456
That's why you're here.

66
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:09,816
Alcatraz was built to keep
all the rotten eggs in one basket.

67
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:11,616
I was specially chosen

68
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:15,216
to ensure that the stink
from the basket does not escape.

69
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:18,496
Since I've been warden
some have tried to escape.

70
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:23,096
Most have been recaptured.
Those who haven't have been killed

71
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:25,216
or drowned in the bay.

72
00:15:25,296 --> 00:15:28,256
No one has ever escaped
from Alcatraz.

73
00:15:32,376 --> 00:15:34,016
And no one ever will.

74
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:53,696
- You two go everywhere together?
- Sure. Even to bed together.

75
00:16:53,776 --> 00:16:55,616
When I wash, he washes.

76
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:58,936
That way we sleep
nice-nice together. Capisce?

77
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:19,096
I'm Wolf.

78
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:23,736
Where did they transfer you from?

79
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,176
Atlanta.

80
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,496
Nice town, Atlanta.

81
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,376
I never saw it.

82
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,816
I'm looking for a new punk.

83
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:45,616
Good luck.

84
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:50,456
You don't understand.
I just found her.

85
00:17:57,736 --> 00:18:00,336
Why don't you show her
what you can do?

86
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:24,536
Morris, I need somebody
in the library.

87
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:27,576
- Take him over there, will you?
- Yes, captain. Move.

88
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:47,856
What you want, boy?

89
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:50,496
The bull sent me down here to work.

90
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:53,096
Can you read, boy?

91
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:57,696
As long as it's in
the English language, boy.

92
00:19:04,456 --> 00:19:06,536
You treat them all like Wolf?

93
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:09,696
Wolf wanted to get friendly.
I didn't.

94
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,416
You'll take that cart to the cells.

95
00:19:14,496 --> 00:19:17,856
Don't they let cons down here?

96
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:19,736
You see any chairs?

97
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:21,696
How come?

98
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:24,576
Because this is The Rock, man.

99
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:29,736
They don't want you
doing anything here, but time...

100
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:33,176
Hard friggin' time.

101
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,096
Rock affects dudes differently.

102
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,936
It either brings out your strength,

103
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:40,776
or it breaks you.

104
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:45,176
What did it do for you?

105
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:49,896
What happens when you get out?

106
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:51,936
I won't.

107
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:54,736
10 years ago...

108
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:59,296
I was in this bar in Alabama

109
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:02,336
when two dudes
started hassling me.

110
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,856
That was their first mistake.

111
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:08,496
They pulled knives.
That was their second mistake.

112
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:10,816
They didn't know how to use them.

113
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:13,856
That was the last
mistake they ever made.

114
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:18,896
I got two 99-year
sentences back-to-back.

115
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:25,336
Seems like you could have
pleaded self-defence.

116
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,816
The dudes were white, man,

117
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,776
just like you.

118
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:39,776
When I arrived they put me in one
of those dark cells in D-block.

119
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:42,256
After a while, I went stir crazy.

120
00:20:42,336 --> 00:20:45,256
Sliced my Achilles'
tendon to get out.

121
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:49,136
You'll see why when you see D-block.

122
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:52,256
Tell me something,
you through killing white guys?

123
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,736
- Why?
- Well, I don't know.

124
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:59,016
I just figured
I wouldn't turn my back on you.

125
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,616
Hey.

126
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:09,096
What's your name, man?

127
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:11,256
Frank. What's yours?

128
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,136
English.

129
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:16,016
See you later.

130
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,576
- Your name?
- Morris.

131
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,136
OK.

132
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:50,656
- Magazine or book?
- Where's English?

133
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:55,256
What did they do,
give a nigger a nigger of his own?

134
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:00,696
Magazine?

135
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:08,016
- Hi! I'm Bugsy.
- Magazine or book?

136
00:22:08,096 --> 00:22:10,536
Thanks. Hey, you're new.

137
00:22:10,616 --> 00:22:11,616
Yeah.

138
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:13,656
Hey, wait, wait a minute.

139
00:22:13,736 --> 00:22:16,696
I haven't seen a new guy
in six months.

140
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:20,536
It's nice to talk.
How are the Brooklyn Dodgers doing?

141
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:24,376
- Moved to LA two years ago.
- No kidding?

142
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:29,136
Warden don't allow books
in these cells.

143
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,256
How come?

144
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:32,776
Because there's no light in them.

145
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,456
Better deliver them books, Morris,

146
00:22:36,536 --> 00:22:38,736
where they can be read.

147
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:39,776
Right.

148
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:00,336
What's the flower?

149
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,576
That's something inside me

150
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,976
they can't lock up
with their bars and walls.

151
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:09,736
I'm Doc.

152
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:15,776
You ever paint?

153
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:18,296
- No.
- Why not?

154
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:24,256
You scared of dying?

155
00:23:26,496 --> 00:23:29,576
- I don't think so.
- You better be.

156
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:33,376
You hurt Wolf.
Wolf's going to hurt you.

157
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:48,376
Where you going, cracker?

158
00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:49,576
Pete.

159
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:03,736
Something special about those steps?

160
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:07,016
The higher you sit,
the more status you got.

161
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:09,776
So we play king of the mountain,

162
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:12,976
except here we don't
play for fun, man.

163
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,256
And you're king?

164
00:24:15,336 --> 00:24:17,016
Yeah.

165
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:24,296
Now, I figure there's two reasons

166
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:27,016
why you didn't sit down on my step.

167
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:30,856
Either you're too scared,

168
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,896
or you just hate niggers.

169
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:37,056
Now, which is it, boy?
You too scared?

170
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:50,176
I just hate niggers.

171
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,616
So no one's ever busted out.

172
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:07,056
No one's ever made it.

173
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:10,896
Everyone has looked for a way,
but there ain't any.

174
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:14,176
See those hacks?

175
00:25:14,256 --> 00:25:17,936
Most joints have one hack
for every seven cons.

176
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,936
There's one hack
for every three cons here.

177
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:25,416
You start shitting at night
instead of in the morning,

178
00:25:25,496 --> 00:25:27,776
they want to know why.

179
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:32,376
Let's say you're
going to try it anyway.

180
00:25:32,456 --> 00:25:35,816
First, you've got
to get out of the cell.

181
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:39,656
Each bar has six hard smaller bars

182
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:43,416
set in a steel tube
with extra steel poured in.

183
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:46,776
And there ain't no way
to tunnel out, either.

184
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:49,656
Shit.

185
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,536
This island is solid rock.

186
00:25:54,696 --> 00:25:56,936
See that water?

187
00:25:58,736 --> 00:26:03,016
It's over a mile swim to land.

188
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:05,736
The currents make it seem like 10.

189
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:10,376
And the water's so cold
it will numb your arms in minutes.

190
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:15,576
Even if you are a good swimmer,
you won't have time to make it.

191
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:21,256
There are 12 counts every day.

192
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:25,656
Sometimes I think that's all
this shit hole is,

193
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:28,576
one long count.

194
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:30,456
We count the hours,

195
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:32,376
the bulls count us,

196
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:35,856
and the king bulls count the counts.

197
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:41,056
Inside! Everybody in!

198
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,176
I'm assigning you a permanent job.

199
00:26:53,616 --> 00:26:56,736
The carpentry shop.
It's a paying job.

200
00:26:56,856 --> 00:27:00,176
- How much?
- 15 cents an hour.

201
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:05,016
Well, I always knew
crime would pay.

202
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:07,936
It's a job.

203
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:13,936
See you later.

204
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:21,416
I sleep lousy,
but I sniff the glue.

205
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,256
It passes the nights.

206
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:26,136
Aren't you afraid
they'll shake down your cell?

207
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:29,936
Then I go to the hole.
It's worth the chance.

208
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:34,736
I guess anything you want bad enough
is worth the chance.

209
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:37,736
Including busting out?

210
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:39,736
Hey, maybe there's a way out.

211
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:42,416
It's on top of your head.

212
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:46,696
Yeah. The ventilator shafts
on top of our block.

213
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,056
How do you get
on top of the block?

214
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:53,056
- Ask the bull for the key.
- Thanks.

215
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:58,136
Hey, jive dude, where you going?

216
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:04,816
Summer's coming on.
It's getting cooler.

217
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:09,216
Weather here is as crazy as The Rock.
Maybe crazier.

218
00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:17,256
Mark Twain wrote that
the coldest winter he ever spent

219
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:19,936
was a summer in San Francisco.
I can...

220
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:24,736
Wolf's coming at you.

221
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:27,296
- Is his hand cupped?
- Yes.

222
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,696
- Which one?
- His right.

223
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,536
Break off!

224
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:52,896
Drop it, Wolf!

225
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,416
Drop it, Wolf.

226
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:14,496
You like D-block, Wolf?

227
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:18,736
You better, because you're gonna
rot there for a long time.

228
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:21,216
D-block, Morris.

229
00:29:22,256 --> 00:29:24,056
Look, he came at me.

230
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,736
I said D-block.

231
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:48,416
When I get out, you're dead.

232
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,976
You'll be dead before you get out.

233
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:02,856
Warden don't like inmates fighting.

234
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,736
Don't like 'em stinking up
their cells, either.

235
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:35,696
Lights out!

236
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:10,656
Go on back to your cell.

237
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:52,896
Welcome to Alcatraz.

238
00:34:00,616 --> 00:34:04,136
- Hey, is anybody over there?
- Yeah, me.

239
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:07,016
Come out in front and say hello.

240
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:08,816
Busy.

241
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,576
How busy can you be
in one of these closets?

242
00:34:21,336 --> 00:34:23,296
Don't worry. I washed it.

243
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:27,936
How you doing, neighbour?
I'm Charley Butts.

244
00:34:31,096 --> 00:34:32,896
Smallest cell I ever been in.

245
00:34:32,976 --> 00:34:36,336
- You'll get used to it.
- I don't think so.

246
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,056
I don't like living alone here.

247
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:41,256
You'll get used to that, too.

248
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:44,256
Break out!

249
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,216
Yard time!

250
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:02,136
Button the collar.

251
00:35:05,016 --> 00:35:06,656
Who's the new fish?

252
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:09,096
I got him next to me.

253
00:35:09,176 --> 00:35:11,656
- What's your name?
- Charley Butts.

254
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:13,176
Charley's butt?

255
00:35:13,256 --> 00:35:16,096
Butts. Butts. Charley Butts.

256
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:18,256
You got a funny name, kid.

257
00:35:18,336 --> 00:35:19,896
Yeah? What's your name?

258
00:35:19,976 --> 00:35:21,536
Al Capone.

259
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:24,496
Thought you were dead.

260
00:35:24,576 --> 00:35:28,376
Me? I got too much money.
I'll never die.

261
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:31,416
- You play poker?
- Not much.

262
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,696
I just learned myself.
We'll play tomorrow.

263
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:36,616
See you later, kid.

264
00:35:36,696 --> 00:35:38,496
See you later, Al.

265
00:35:38,576 --> 00:35:41,416
I don't believe
I just met Al Capone.

266
00:35:41,496 --> 00:35:42,936
I don't, either.

267
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,536
- I'm Doc.
- Charley Butts.

268
00:35:45,616 --> 00:35:47,576
How's the painting going, Doc?

269
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:51,576
The one of the warden?
It's nearly finished.

270
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:55,336
- You painting the warden?
- He's very inspiring.

271
00:37:03,016 --> 00:37:05,256
Inside. Everybody in.

272
00:37:11,536 --> 00:37:12,576
Yes, sir?

273
00:37:12,656 --> 00:37:17,856
I want painting privileges
taken away from Chester Dalton.

274
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:21,176
- Doc?
- Cell 233.

275
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:22,696
What's the reason?

276
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:25,536
You're deputy warden.
You think of one.

277
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:28,496
When do you want
the suspension to begin?

278
00:37:28,576 --> 00:37:31,536
It's not a suspension.
It's an elimination.

279
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:37,416
- Right away.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:45,096
Painting privileges
have been removed.

281
00:37:54,376 --> 00:37:56,256
Why?

282
00:37:56,336 --> 00:37:57,896
I don't know.

283
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:18,296
Painting's all I have.

284
00:38:20,576 --> 00:38:21,976
I'm sorry, Doc.

285
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:54,136
You OK, Doc?

286
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:56,736
I think there's
something wrong with him.

287
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:42,176
I'd keep my eye on Doc.
He seems pretty upset.

288
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:44,816
Cons are always upset
about something.

289
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,496
Put your overalls on.

290
00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:53,256
Mr. Zimmerman,
I'm making a new table.

291
00:39:53,336 --> 00:39:55,096
I need a hatchet.

292
00:39:59,456 --> 00:40:02,336
Bob, get Doc a hatchet.

293
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:29,136
Mr. Zimmerman!

294
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:32,016
Can you come over here
for a minute?

295
00:40:58,496 --> 00:41:01,376
Get him out of here! Get him out!

296
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:06,776
Take him out of here! Get him out!

297
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:12,536
Get back to work.

298
00:41:17,536 --> 00:41:19,096
Let's go! Move!

299
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:23,896
Everybody, back to work! Let's go!

300
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:23,616
Here. Put that in your report.

301
00:43:19,936 --> 00:43:22,576
What were you doing
back there, boy?

302
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:27,536
- How about a magazine?
- Why not?

303
00:43:27,616 --> 00:43:30,976
What do you want? Boy's Life?

304
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:35,216
I know some queens
who fight over it every month.

305
00:43:35,336 --> 00:43:38,136
Just give me what
you got on top there.

306
00:43:44,896 --> 00:43:47,256
I heard about Doc,

307
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:50,416
and I know why he did it.

308
00:43:54,456 --> 00:43:57,416
Somebody took away
his painting privileges.

309
00:43:57,496 --> 00:43:58,896
Who?

310
00:44:01,696 --> 00:44:03,576
The warden.

311
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:17,176
Morris.

312
00:44:24,216 --> 00:44:27,176
I hear there was an accident
in one of the shops.

313
00:44:27,256 --> 00:44:29,896
Accident? You mean Doc.

314
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:32,936
Yeah, someone didn't like
what he was painting,

315
00:44:33,056 --> 00:44:35,256
so someone won't let him paint.

316
00:44:35,336 --> 00:44:39,416
Someone should have warned Doc
to be careful what he paints.

317
00:44:39,496 --> 00:44:41,936
I think you're absolutely right, sir.

318
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:44,016
There's always the possibility

319
00:44:44,096 --> 00:44:47,176
that some asshole will be offended,
isn't there?

320
00:44:47,256 --> 00:44:49,296
We all have to be careful.

321
00:44:50,376 --> 00:44:51,936
Back in line.

322
00:45:05,456 --> 00:45:07,376
Hey, how's it going, Frank?

323
00:45:09,296 --> 00:45:11,416
Well, well.
If it isn't the Anglins.

324
00:45:11,536 --> 00:45:13,616
What are you guys doing,
just dropping by?

325
00:45:13,696 --> 00:45:17,576
- Thought we'd pay you a visit.
- Gonna stay long?

326
00:45:17,656 --> 00:45:20,696
Not long. Only about 15 or 20 years.

327
00:45:20,776 --> 00:45:22,256
Why The Rock?

328
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:26,216
We were leaving Atlanta when
we encountered a minor problem.

329
00:45:26,296 --> 00:45:28,656
- Such as?
- They saw us.

330
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:30,896
Yeah, that do present problems.

331
00:45:30,976 --> 00:45:32,816
They shipped us to Leavenworth.

332
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,416
But we didn't like
their accommodations, either.

333
00:45:35,496 --> 00:45:39,576
Warden said he knew
just the place for us...Alcatraz.

334
00:45:39,656 --> 00:45:44,296
Is it true no one's
ever bust out of here?

335
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:47,016
- So they tell me.
- Jesus.

336
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,936
Wonder what I'd be like
after 15 years here.

337
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,376
You still reading that bible?

338
00:46:56,456 --> 00:47:00,136
Yeah. It's opening up
all kinds of new doors.

339
00:47:15,856 --> 00:47:19,296
I turned 35 today. Some birthday.

340
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:24,456
- When's your birthday?
- I don't know.

341
00:47:24,536 --> 00:47:27,296
Jeez, what kind of
childhood did you have?

342
00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:29,176
Short.

343
00:47:33,096 --> 00:47:37,496
I always wanted to see San Francisco.
Never thought it'd be like this.

344
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:40,376
What'd you get sent to the rock for?

345
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:45,056
Couple of years ago I started
stealing cars, for kicks mostly.

346
00:47:45,136 --> 00:47:50,056
I'd sell the parts.
Got sent to the state pen.

347
00:47:50,136 --> 00:47:52,256
You end up in Alcatraz for that?

348
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,096
Not exactly. A bull there
liked to push me around.

349
00:47:55,176 --> 00:47:59,536
So when I got out,
I went back, and stole his car.

350
00:47:59,616 --> 00:48:02,696
Unfortunately,
I drove it across the state line,

351
00:48:02,776 --> 00:48:07,616
which made it a federal rap,
and I was sent to the rock.

352
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:13,376
English! Visitor for you.

353
00:48:16,336 --> 00:48:19,576
Butts, you got a visitor.

354
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:21,856
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

355
00:48:21,936 --> 00:48:24,496
Probably somebody
wants their car back.

356
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,776
Hello, father.

357
00:48:53,576 --> 00:48:55,416
Why didn't you say you were coming?

358
00:48:55,496 --> 00:48:58,816
I was afraid you wouldn't let me.

359
00:49:00,496 --> 00:49:02,816
It's just hard to see you like this.

360
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,696
Your mama's going to die.

361
00:49:19,616 --> 00:49:21,096
Charley?

362
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:25,496
When?

363
00:49:25,576 --> 00:49:29,536
Well, she's got a few months.

364
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:32,456
Can you call her?

365
00:49:34,496 --> 00:49:36,456
We're not allowed
to make phone calls.

366
00:49:36,536 --> 00:49:40,536
You cannot discuss institution rules.
Stick to your personal life.

367
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:44,536
This is my personal life!
You getting a kick out of it?

368
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:46,376
Hello?

369
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:48,936
Hello!

370
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:58,016
I...love...you...Charley.

371
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:24,256
Hey, Frank.

372
00:50:26,176 --> 00:50:27,536
Yeah?

373
00:50:27,616 --> 00:50:30,776
If you try to get out, I want in.

374
00:50:47,256 --> 00:50:50,656
- Must be Wednesday.
- Why?

375
00:50:50,736 --> 00:50:52,576
Mystery mounds.

376
00:50:52,656 --> 00:50:55,296
We always have
mystery mounds on Wednesday.

377
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:58,936
I can't taste it.
I just eat it out of habit.

378
00:51:03,136 --> 00:51:07,776
- What's the movie this weekend?
- Some cowboy piece of shit.

379
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:12,176
Hey, at least they could
show us a gangster movie.

380
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:18,016
I may have found a way out of here.

381
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,256
You looking at something?

382
00:51:32,776 --> 00:51:36,016
This cell block's really getting old.

383
00:51:36,096 --> 00:51:41,496
The moist air corrodes the concrete.
The salt is rusting the metal.

384
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:45,896
I took a nail clipper, and dug around
the grille at the back of the cell.

385
00:51:45,976 --> 00:51:48,176
I can dig that grille out,

386
00:51:48,256 --> 00:51:51,256
and enlarge the hole
into the utility corridor

387
00:51:51,336 --> 00:51:55,976
to the top of the cell block
and maybe onto the roof.

388
00:51:56,056 --> 00:51:58,456
How will we hide the hole?

389
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:03,456
We tear the ads from magazines...
no one will miss those...

390
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:08,296
make cardboard, paint grilles
on that, and put it in the hole,

391
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,736
maybe partially obscure it
with a towel or whatever.

392
00:52:11,816 --> 00:52:15,936
I've ordered an accordion
to put in front of my hole.

393
00:52:16,016 --> 00:52:20,376
Suppose we make it. They'll know
we're gone at the next count.

394
00:52:20,456 --> 00:52:24,616
We'll leave at night,
so they won't know till the morning.

395
00:52:24,696 --> 00:52:27,456
We'll have to make some dummy heads,

396
00:52:27,536 --> 00:52:30,896
make them out of plaster
or cardboard or whatever.

397
00:52:30,976 --> 00:52:34,336
Put them in the bunks,
the guards won't know.

398
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:37,656
You work in the barbershop.
You get the hair.

399
00:52:37,736 --> 00:52:40,016
How do we cross the bay?

400
00:52:40,096 --> 00:52:44,056
That's your job.
You work in the clothing shop.

401
00:52:44,136 --> 00:52:48,176
You're gonna steal some raincoats
and some contact cement.

402
00:52:48,256 --> 00:52:51,056
We'll make a life raft
and some life preservers.

403
00:52:51,136 --> 00:52:53,256
I read how to do it
in Popular Mechanics.

404
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,296
They'll think we're going to Frisco.

405
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:58,976
Well, we won't.
We'll go to Angel Island instead.

406
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:03,976
What about me?

407
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:08,376
You'll stand guard while I dig.
I'll stand guard while you dig.

408
00:53:08,456 --> 00:53:11,056
You two trade off the same way.

409
00:53:15,376 --> 00:53:17,136
What are our chances?

410
00:53:17,216 --> 00:53:19,376
Slim.

411
00:53:20,536 --> 00:53:22,816
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

412
00:53:22,896 --> 00:53:24,256
I wanna go.

413
00:53:34,016 --> 00:53:35,536
Charley.

414
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:37,736
Yeah?

415
00:53:37,816 --> 00:53:40,976
I'm gonna start digging.
Keep an eye out.

416
00:53:41,056 --> 00:53:44,016
If you see one,
start whistling, huh?

417
00:54:39,936 --> 00:54:41,776
How's it going?

418
00:54:41,856 --> 00:54:43,216
Fair.

419
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:52,816
Whoever named this place
The Rock wasn't kidding.

420
00:54:52,896 --> 00:54:56,816
Working with those nail clippers
just doesn't have any grip.

421
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:15,576
Hey, guard.

422
00:55:20,136 --> 00:55:21,176
Yeah?

423
00:55:21,256 --> 00:55:25,176
Can I exchange this spoon? Looks
like it's been in someone's ass.

424
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:28,216
And I want to work in the kitchen.

425
00:55:31,016 --> 00:55:33,456
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

426
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:44,696
I'd like to join the kitchen detail.

427
00:55:44,776 --> 00:55:45,856
Can you cook?

428
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:48,216
Can I swap this spoon for another?

429
00:55:48,296 --> 00:55:50,176
Damn right I can cook.

430
00:55:50,256 --> 00:55:55,456
I used to be a cook in this cafe.
Everybody loved my meatballs.

431
00:55:55,536 --> 00:55:57,616
Did you quit or get fired?

432
00:55:57,696 --> 00:56:00,176
Neither. I robbed the cafe.

433
00:56:15,096 --> 00:56:18,416
- Heard you had a visitor.
- My daughter.

434
00:56:18,496 --> 00:56:20,776
She's getting married.

435
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:22,856
He's white...

436
00:56:22,936 --> 00:56:24,976
just like you.

437
00:56:25,056 --> 00:56:26,816
Congratulations.

438
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:32,416
- Want a magazine?
- Yeah. What do you recommend?

439
00:56:34,696 --> 00:56:36,016
Ebony.

440
00:56:41,496 --> 00:56:43,216
Hey, English.

441
00:56:45,016 --> 00:56:49,256
Is it possible to weld two pieces
of metal together here in the cell?

442
00:56:51,136 --> 00:56:53,776
For digging...or sticking?

443
00:56:54,736 --> 00:56:56,256
Digging.

444
00:56:57,136 --> 00:57:00,736
It ain't easy, but I could show you.

445
00:57:00,856 --> 00:57:03,136
Planning on going somewhere?

446
00:57:06,896 --> 00:57:10,576
There hasn't been a day
that I've been on this rock

447
00:57:10,696 --> 00:57:12,896
that I didn't think of busting out.

448
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:18,216
If I'd known, I'd have slashed
my throat instead of my tendon.

449
00:57:25,176 --> 00:57:27,976
Hey, Litmus, can you get me a dime?

450
00:57:28,056 --> 00:57:30,696
No problem. Cost you 10 desserts.

451
00:57:30,816 --> 00:57:32,376
I need it tonight.

452
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:34,856
No problem. Cost you an extra five.

453
00:57:34,976 --> 00:57:39,656
Get me a dime, I'll toss in
10 beetles for your mouse.

454
00:58:26,776 --> 00:58:27,896
Thanks.

455
01:00:12,536 --> 01:00:14,816
Hey, Frank, what's burning?

456
01:00:16,936 --> 01:00:20,936
If you see one of those bulls
coming, just start whistling.

457
01:01:23,616 --> 01:01:26,056
Hey, Spoof, what's for breakfast?

458
01:01:57,896 --> 01:01:59,656
I smell something burning.

459
01:02:00,736 --> 01:02:02,576
I don't smell anything.

460
01:02:03,776 --> 01:02:05,536
Hell, must be my imagination.

461
01:02:05,616 --> 01:02:08,656
Working nights
really gets to you after a while.

462
01:02:11,056 --> 01:02:13,016
Try it from my side.

463
01:02:30,456 --> 01:02:33,416
Keep an eye out. He may be back.

464
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:22,856
The grille's welded
on two-hook anchors?

465
01:03:22,936 --> 01:03:27,976
If I get a wedge I may be able
to knock those anchors loose.

466
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:43,776
This might just be
what I'm looking for.

467
01:03:43,856 --> 01:03:47,256
But it won't get through
the metal detector.

468
01:03:47,336 --> 01:03:49,056
Yeah, I know.

469
01:03:55,976 --> 01:03:57,216
Morris, hold it.

470
01:03:57,296 --> 01:03:59,896
I made it for a clothes-peg.

471
01:03:59,976 --> 01:04:01,856
Why the metal over the edge?

472
01:04:01,936 --> 01:04:04,496
So the clothes would slide off easy.

473
01:04:04,576 --> 01:04:06,616
I don't believe you.

474
01:04:06,696 --> 01:04:10,856
I didn't try to hide it. Why would I
try to take metal through a detector?

475
01:04:10,936 --> 01:04:14,096
Because you're stupid.

476
01:04:15,536 --> 01:04:16,656
Move it.

477
01:07:52,256 --> 01:07:54,016
Open up 107.

478
01:07:58,016 --> 01:08:01,656
Why did you order this stuff?
You don't look like a painter.

479
01:08:01,736 --> 01:08:05,216
You wouldn't know talent
if it looked you in the face.

480
01:08:05,296 --> 01:08:09,256
I'm looking you in the face
and I don't see shit.

481
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:22,936
Hair. Your colour.

482
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:26,456
Frank.

483
01:08:28,536 --> 01:08:31,896
Paint. One of them's flesh-coloured.

484
01:08:31,976 --> 01:08:33,816
What are you painting?

485
01:08:33,896 --> 01:08:36,696
I don't know. The ocean maybe.

486
01:08:36,776 --> 01:08:40,856
If you're using flesh-coloured paint,
you better paint a portrait.

487
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:43,096
Yeah.

488
01:12:47,056 --> 01:12:48,136
Frank.

489
01:12:50,696 --> 01:12:51,936
Frank.

490
01:13:04,176 --> 01:13:06,736
Morris go to sleep early tonight?

491
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:09,056
Yeah. Wasn't feeling well.

492
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:12,976
He must sleep pretty soundly.
He hasn't moved.

493
01:13:39,296 --> 01:13:40,496
Morris?

494
01:13:41,616 --> 01:13:43,336
Yeah, what's up?

495
01:13:48,336 --> 01:13:50,896
I went up top last night.

496
01:13:50,976 --> 01:13:54,936
I saw the ventilator shaft
to the roof, but I can't reach it.

497
01:13:55,016 --> 01:13:56,736
I need a boost.

498
01:13:58,456 --> 01:14:00,576
How are you all coming?

499
01:14:00,656 --> 01:14:02,216
My dummy's ready.

500
01:14:02,336 --> 01:14:06,256
The hole's done,
but I'm just starting the dummy.

501
01:14:06,336 --> 01:14:08,216
I ain't doing too good.

502
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:13,376
Tonight, John and I will go up.

503
01:14:19,336 --> 01:14:23,656
You get those raincoats,
might as well start hauling them up.

504
01:14:23,736 --> 01:14:26,416
I'll wear one back
from the shop each day.

505
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:29,456
There's a different hack
there in the afternoon.

506
01:14:29,536 --> 01:14:31,736
He'll think I wore it to work.

507
01:14:31,816 --> 01:14:36,176
- Can you get that contact cement?
- I keep inventory.

508
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:31,856
Hey!

509
01:15:38,296 --> 01:15:40,016
Give me a boost.

510
01:15:46,096 --> 01:15:48,336
The bars feel pretty solid.

511
01:15:49,776 --> 01:15:53,856
There seems to be a metal hood
riveted onto higher uprights.

512
01:15:53,936 --> 01:15:58,096
We'll spread the bars
with a pipe and knock the hood off.

513
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:02,296
There's an electrical outlet here.

514
01:16:02,376 --> 01:16:07,176
Get a motor, a drill bit and
a flashlight and we'd have it all.

515
01:16:07,256 --> 01:16:09,616
Great.
Where's the nearest hardware store?

516
01:16:28,656 --> 01:16:33,016
Can you get me an extension cord
and a drill bit from the shop?

517
01:16:33,096 --> 01:16:36,376
If they find out, I go to the hole.

518
01:16:36,456 --> 01:16:41,616
All right, but from now on,
you put your desserts onto my tray.

519
01:16:43,976 --> 01:16:46,936
Time's up. Back to the cells.

520
01:16:47,016 --> 01:16:50,776
Damn it! Just when
I thought we was doing good.

521
01:16:56,816 --> 01:16:58,216
I can use this.

522
01:16:59,256 --> 01:17:00,896
Are you crazy?

523
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:28,976
Hold it, Morris.

524
01:17:30,656 --> 01:17:32,536
Want to look at one of those cases.

525
01:17:38,856 --> 01:17:40,336
Try this one.

526
01:17:45,496 --> 01:17:47,056
Let's open it up.

527
01:17:59,536 --> 01:18:02,496
Stole this penlight from the Doc.

528
01:19:42,456 --> 01:19:43,776
Hey.

529
01:19:46,896 --> 01:19:48,256
Give me a boost.

530
01:20:01,376 --> 01:20:02,736
Pipe.

531
01:20:43,696 --> 01:20:47,376
OK. Hand me the drill.

532
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:43,496
We're all through.

533
01:21:58,336 --> 01:22:00,136
Fire!

534
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:03,776
Hey, 50-millimetre guns.

535
01:22:05,856 --> 01:22:08,256
I'm worried about the shakedowns.

536
01:22:08,336 --> 01:22:10,736
My cardboard grille
keeps slipping out.

537
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,216
Put some contact cement
around the edges.

538
01:22:13,296 --> 01:22:15,576
That should take care of it.

539
01:22:21,256 --> 01:22:24,456
How's the raft
and the life jackets coming?

540
01:22:24,536 --> 01:22:26,496
OK.

541
01:22:26,576 --> 01:22:28,776
I think they'll be done Tuesday.

542
01:22:30,776 --> 01:22:32,736
Tuesday night, we go.

543
01:22:51,896 --> 01:22:53,936
What's that for?

544
01:22:54,016 --> 01:22:56,216
Just thinking about Doc.

545
01:22:56,296 --> 01:23:00,416
Yeah. We planted
those chrysanthemums 15 years ago.

546
01:23:00,496 --> 01:23:03,856
They meant a lot to Doc. To me, too.

547
01:23:03,936 --> 01:23:07,496
- I had a garden.
- What'd you grow, weeds?

548
01:23:07,576 --> 01:23:10,936
It's against regulations,
Morris, and you know it.

549
01:23:24,216 --> 01:23:25,616
Stretcher.

550
01:23:26,696 --> 01:23:28,416
Get the medic.

551
01:23:28,496 --> 01:23:29,976
He won't need one.

552
01:23:41,776 --> 01:23:44,656
Some men are destined
never to leave Alcatraz...

553
01:23:47,896 --> 01:23:49,336
alive.

554
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,416
Got those books that may help you.

555
01:24:06,496 --> 01:24:07,896
Thanks.

556
01:24:09,376 --> 01:24:10,776
See you later, man.

557
01:24:10,856 --> 01:24:13,496
Goodbye...boy.

558
01:24:31,536 --> 01:24:34,576
So long...boy.

559
01:24:49,976 --> 01:24:50,936
Shakedown.

560
01:24:56,376 --> 01:24:57,496
Move.

561
01:24:57,576 --> 01:24:59,776
Move, move, move.

562
01:25:11,656 --> 01:25:13,256
Take a seat.

563
01:25:53,896 --> 01:25:57,736
- Been playing this thing long?
- Couple of months.

564
01:25:59,976 --> 01:26:03,016
- You any good?
- Terrible.

565
01:26:05,696 --> 01:26:07,856
You'll get better.

566
01:26:17,336 --> 01:26:18,296
Excuse me.

567
01:26:26,696 --> 01:26:30,296
That's one of the benefits
of Alcatraz.

568
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:32,616
Lots of time to practise.

569
01:26:36,496 --> 01:26:40,056
Has Morris
been doing anything unusual?

570
01:26:40,176 --> 01:26:43,296
Sometimes he stays up late
talking with Butts.

571
01:26:43,416 --> 01:26:45,616
Split them up. Move Morris.

572
01:26:45,736 --> 01:26:49,616
I'll have to get a cell ready
and do the paperwork.

573
01:26:49,736 --> 01:26:51,856
- Do you?
- Yes, sir.

574
01:26:51,976 --> 01:26:55,016
We could move him, say, Wednesday.

575
01:26:55,136 --> 01:26:57,856
- Tuesday morning.
- Yes, sir.

576
01:27:10,856 --> 01:27:12,616
I missed you, Morris.

577
01:27:12,736 --> 01:27:17,136
I missed you so much,
I got a present for you.

578
01:27:17,256 --> 01:27:19,816
I'll give it to you...later.

579
01:27:20,976 --> 01:27:22,936
Get your ass back there.

580
01:27:30,376 --> 01:27:34,136
He'll kill you,
or you'll have to kill him.

581
01:27:34,256 --> 01:27:37,576
Well, I'm not going
to give him the chance.

582
01:27:37,696 --> 01:27:41,896
Can you get the raft
and life jackets ready by tonight?

583
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:44,376
All right.

584
01:27:44,456 --> 01:27:48,816
We'll meet on top
as soon as the lights are out.

585
01:28:04,456 --> 01:28:07,896
- Wolf, you carrying?
- Who, me?

586
01:28:12,216 --> 01:28:13,616
Move out.

587
01:28:52,856 --> 01:28:54,496
Where you going, Wolfie?

588
01:28:54,616 --> 01:28:57,416
I'm just going for a walk.

589
01:28:57,496 --> 01:28:59,536
Let's take that walk.

590
01:29:06,896 --> 01:29:09,496
After six months in the hole,

591
01:29:09,576 --> 01:29:13,856
looks like you could
use some exercise.

592
01:29:18,616 --> 01:29:20,176
Butts.

593
01:29:21,096 --> 01:29:23,296
I'll meet you up on top.

594
01:29:26,816 --> 01:29:28,376
Let's go.

595
01:29:41,776 --> 01:29:44,696
Yeah. You're going, too.

596
01:31:08,656 --> 01:31:10,136
Butts.

597
01:31:14,656 --> 01:31:16,336
Butts, God damn it.

598
01:37:06,176 --> 01:37:09,296
Can't risk tearing this gear,
what's left of it.

599
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:12,056
Throw me the stuff when I get over.

600
01:37:54,936 --> 01:37:56,696
Watch the barbed wire.

601
01:41:45,216 --> 01:41:47,216
Get up, Morris. It's moving day.

602
01:41:49,056 --> 01:41:51,936
I said, get up, Morris. Open up 109.

603
01:41:53,896 --> 01:41:56,536
God damn it, Morris. I said get...

604
01:41:58,856 --> 01:42:00,376
Jesus Christ.

605
01:42:37,776 --> 01:42:40,056
Morning, Sergeant. What have you got?

606
01:42:40,176 --> 01:42:42,736
Photos and a notebook
of Clarence Anglin's.

607
01:42:42,816 --> 01:42:44,136
Funny looking bag.

608
01:42:44,216 --> 01:42:47,096
Must have been made from a raincoat.

609
01:42:47,936 --> 01:42:50,376
- It appears that they drowned.
- Why?

610
01:42:50,496 --> 01:42:54,176
If that was important
they wouldn't have lost it.

611
01:42:54,296 --> 01:42:57,936
Maybe they lost it
to look like they drowned.

612
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:41,456
Warden, I just got a message
from the Director.

613
01:43:41,536 --> 01:43:43,816
He wants you in Washington.

614
01:43:43,896 --> 01:43:46,096
Do chrysanthemums grow
on this island?

615
01:43:46,216 --> 01:43:48,576
Not here on Angel Island. Why?

616
01:43:48,656 --> 01:43:50,616
I'm curious.

617
01:43:51,496 --> 01:43:56,336
The tides were mild
and the fog light last night.

618
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:02,696
If they left at lights out,
they had a 9 1/2-hour head start.

619
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:05,016
I wonder if they made it.

620
01:44:05,136 --> 01:44:07,176
They drowned.

621
01:44:08,536 --> 01:44:10,016
Yes, sir.
