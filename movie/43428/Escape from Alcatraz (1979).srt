1
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,175
- We got to get back.
- See ya, Matt.

2
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,247
Come through here.

3
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:44,924
Strip down.

4
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,450
Open up.

5
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:55,722
Welcome to Alcatraz.

6
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:23,591
Inside B and C! Count them!

7
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:43,938
- 25 on inside C, first tier.
- 20 inside B, first tier.

8
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,443
- 23 on inside C, second tier.
- 17 inside B, second tier.

9
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,622
Break out! Inside B and C.

10
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:14,009
Move!

11
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:18,219
Better button your collar, boy.

12
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,981
No forks.

13
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,573
Hey, no forks.

14
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,867
Do you see any?

15
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,376
Fresh fish, you want your pasta?

16
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,752
Hey, you want your pasta?

17
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,714
Do you see any?

18
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:14,180
I see pasta in my sleep.

19
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:55,261
I'm Litmus.

20
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,553
Like litmus paper.

21
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:03,563
When it's cold, my face gets blue.

22
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:06,603
When it's hot, my face gets red.

23
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:28,872
Inside C, move out.

24
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:44,179
Warden wants to see you.

25
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:13,590
- Name?
- Morris.

26
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:15,551
That's funny.

27
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:20,134
This file says Frank Lee Morris.

28
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,020
If you disobey the rules of society,
they send you to prison.

29
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:34,239
If you disobey the rules of prison,
they send you to us.

30
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:44,576
Alcatraz is not like any other
prison in the United States.

31
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:50,587
Here, every inmate is confined alone

32
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:53,959
to an individual cell.

33
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:55,961
Unlike my predecessors,

34
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:57,963
wardens Johnson and Blackwell,

35
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:00,973
l don't have good conduct programs.

36
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:04,013
I do not have inmate councils.

37
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:07,223
Inmates have no say in what they do.

38
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:09,224
They do as they're told.

39
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:11,226
You are not permitted

40
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,989
to have newspapers
or magazines carrying news.

41
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:17,856
Knowledge of the outside world
is what we tell you.

42
00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:22,992
From this day on,

43
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:28,829
your world will be everything
that happens in this building.

44
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,209
You will shave once a day.

45
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:33,540
You will shower twice a week.

46
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:36,385
You will cut your hair once a month.

47
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:40,341
Now, your privileges.

48
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:43,516
You can talk. You can work.
Other institutions hand out work,

49
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:46,638
but here it's a privilege
that you earn.

50
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,146
I promise you it's
a privilege that you'll want.

51
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:52,606
Visitors -
you're allowed two a month.

52
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:56,988
They cannot be former inmates
of this or any other federal prison.

53
00:14:57,074 --> 00:15:01,617
All names that you submit will
be carefully checked by the FBI.

54
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:04,455
What names do you have in mind?

55
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,081
I can't think of any offhand.

56
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:11,747
Family members?

57
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:15,586
None. No family.

58
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:22,554
Alcatraz is
a maximum security prison

59
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:25,595
with very few privileges.

60
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:27,560
We don't make good citizens,

61
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:30,019
but we make good prisoners.

62
00:15:30,107 --> 00:15:33,975
Burglary, armed robbery,

63
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,987
grand larceny...

64
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:40,607
You've escaped from
quite a few prisons, haven't you?

65
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:44,408
That's why you're here.

66
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:48,957
Alcatraz was built to keep
all the rotten eggs in one basket.

67
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:50,834
I was specially chosen

68
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,585
to ensure that the stink
from the basket does not escape.

69
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:58,007
Since l've been warden
some have tried to escape.

70
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:02,803
Most have been recaptured.
Those who haven't have been killed

71
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,013
or drowned in the bay.

72
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:08,185
No one has ever escaped
from Alcatraz.

73
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,191
And no one ever will.

74
00:17:33,232 --> 00:17:37,276
- You two go everywhere together?
- Sure. Even to bed together.

75
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:39,270
When I wash, he washes.

76
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:42,732
That way we sleep
nice-nice together. Capisce?

77
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:03,750
I'm Wolf.

78
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:08,594
Where did they transfer you from?

79
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:10,095
Atlanta.

80
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,604
Nice town, Atlanta.

81
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,564
I never saw it.

82
00:18:21,655 --> 00:18:25,356
I'm looking for a new punk.

83
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:31,407
Good luck.

84
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:36,456
You don't understand.
I just found her.

85
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,758
Why don't you show her
what you can do?

86
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:11,994
Morris, I need somebody
in the library.

87
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:15,166
- Take him over there, will you?
- Yes, captain. Move.

88
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:36,304
What you want, boy?

89
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:39,067
The bull sent me down here to work.

90
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,772
Can you read, boy?

91
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:46,573
As long as it's in
the English language, boy.

92
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,782
You treat them all like Wolf?

93
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:59,079
Wolf wanted to get friendly.
I didn't.

94
00:20:00,672 --> 00:20:04,006
You'll take that caft to the cells.

95
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:07,592
Don't they let cons down here?

96
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,553
You see any chairs?

97
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,597
How come?

98
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:14,601
Because this is The Rock, man.

99
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:19,977
They don't want you
doing anything here, but time...

100
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:23,566
Hard friggin' time.

101
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:26,608
Rock affects dudes differently.

102
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:29,569
It either brings out your strength,

103
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,487
or it breaks you.

104
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,078
What did it do for you?

105
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:41,000
What happens when you get out?

106
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:43,128
I won't.

107
00:20:44,717 --> 00:20:46,045
10 years ago...

108
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:50,802
l was in this bar in Alabama

109
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,974
when two dudes
started hassling me.

110
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,597
That was their first mistake.

111
00:20:56,687 --> 00:21:00,388
They pulled knives.
That was their second mistake.

112
00:21:00,483 --> 00:21:02,808
They didn't know how to use them.

113
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:05,986
That was the last
mistake they ever made.

114
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:11,232
I got two 99-year
sentences back-to-back.

115
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:17,951
Seems like you could have
pleaded self-defence.

116
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:21,577
The dudes were white, man,

117
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,628
just like you.

118
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:33,015
When I arrived they put me in one
of those dark cells in D-block.

119
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,590
After a while, I went stir crazy.

120
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,721
Sliced my Achilles'
tendon to get out.

121
00:21:39,856 --> 00:21:42,773
You'll see why when you see D-block.

122
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:46,025
Tell me something,
you through killing white guys?

123
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,603
- Why?
- Well, I don't know.

124
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:53,075
I just figured
l wouldn't turn my back on you.

125
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,993
Hey.

126
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:03,577
What's your name, man?

127
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:05,830
Frank. What's yours?

128
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,841
English.

129
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,801
See you later.

130
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,811
- Your name?
- Morris.

131
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:28,648
OK.

132
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,915
- Magazine or book?
- Where's English?

133
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:51,716
What did they do,
give a nigger a nigger of his own?

134
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:57,391
Magazine?

135
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:05,021
- Hi! I'm Bugsy.
- Magazine or book?

136
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:07,646
Thanks. Hey, you're new.

137
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:08,767
Yeah.

138
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:10,902
Hey, wait, wait a minute.

139
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:14,074
I haven't seen a new guy
in six months.

140
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,074
It's nice to talk.
How are the Brooklyn Dodgers doing?

141
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:22,078
- Moved to LA two years ago.
- No kidding?

142
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:27,037
Warden don't allow books
in these cells.

143
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:28,210
How come?

144
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,837
Because there's no light in them.

145
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:34,676
Better deliver them books, Morris,

146
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:37,052
where they can be read.

147
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:38,137
Right.

148
00:23:58,162 --> 00:23:59,573
What's the flower?

149
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:01,905
That's something inside me

150
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:05,451
they can't lock up
with their bars and walls.

151
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:09,380
I'm Doc.

152
00:24:13,177 --> 00:24:15,668
You ever paint?

153
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:18,301
- No.
- Why not?

154
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:24,518
You scared of dying?

155
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:30,061
- I don't think so.
- You better be.

156
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:34,020
You hurt Wolf.
Wolf's going to hurt you.

157
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,661
Where you going, cracker?

158
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:50,919
Pete.

159
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,687
Something special about those steps?

160
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:09,106
The higher you sit,
the more status you got.

161
00:25:09,192 --> 00:25:11,979
So we play king of the mountain,

162
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,320
except here we don't
play for fun, man.

163
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:17,696
And you're king?

164
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:19,528
Yeah.

165
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,117
Now, I figure there's two reasons

166
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,962
why you didn't sit down on my step.

167
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:33,965
Either you're too scared,

168
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,090
or you just hate niggers.

169
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:40,425
Now, which is it, boy?
You too scared?

170
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,109
I just hate niggers.

171
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:08,116
So no one's ever busted out.

172
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:11,711
No one's ever made it.

173
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:15,711
Everyone has looked for a way,
but there ain't any.

174
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:19,135
See those hacks?

175
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:23,053
Most joints have one hack
for every seven cons.

176
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:27,222
There's one hack
for every three cons here.

177
00:26:27,313 --> 00:26:30,848
You start shitting at night
instead of in the morning,

178
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:33,314
they want to know why.

179
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,113
Let's say you're
going to try it anyway.

180
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:41,698
First, you've got
to get out of the cell.

181
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:45,700
Each bar has six hard smaller bars

182
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:49,622
set in a steel tube
with extra steel poured in.

183
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,126
And there ain't no way
to tunnel out, either.

184
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,127
Shit.

185
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,168
This island is solid rock.

186
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:03,714
See that water?

187
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:10,062
It's over a mile swim to land.

188
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:12,899
The currents make it seem like 10.

189
00:27:12,984 --> 00:27:17,729
And the water's so cold
it will numb your arms in minutes.

190
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:23,161
Even if you are a good swimmer,
you won't have time to make it.

191
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:29,080
There are 12 counts every day.

192
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:33,663
Sometimes I think that's all
this shit hole is,

193
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:36,709
one long count.

194
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,673
We count the hours,

195
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,669
the bulls count us,

196
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:44,297
and the king bulls count the counts.

197
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:49,722
Inside! Everybody in!

198
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,318
I'm assigning you a permanent job.

199
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:06,070
The carpentry shop.
It's a paying job.

200
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:09,662
- How much?
- 15 cents an hour.

201
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:14,711
Well, I always knew
crime would pay.

202
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:17,750
It's a job.

203
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:23,971
See you later.

204
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:31,805
I sleep lousy,
but I sniff the glue.

205
00:28:31,897 --> 00:28:33,688
It passes the nights.

206
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:36,728
Aren't you afraid
they'll shake down your cell?

207
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:40,686
Then I go to the hole.
It's worth the chance.

208
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:45,699
I guess anything you want bad enough
is worth the chance.

209
00:28:45,786 --> 00:28:48,787
Including busting out?

210
00:28:48,872 --> 00:28:50,912
Hey, maybe there's a way out.

211
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,669
It's on top of your head.

212
00:28:53,752 --> 00:28:58,165
Yeah. The ventilator shafts
on top of our block.

213
00:28:58,257 --> 00:29:01,673
How do you get
on top of the block?

214
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:04,797
- Ask the bull for the key.
- Thanks.

215
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:10,092
Hey, jive dude, where you going?

216
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:17,056
Summer's coming on.
It's getting cooler.

217
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:21,612
Weather here is as crazy as The Rock.
Maybe crazier.

218
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:30,028
Mark Twain wrote that
the coldest winter he ever spent

219
00:29:30,122 --> 00:29:32,827
was a summer in San Francisco.
I can...

220
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:37,796
Wolf's coming at you.

221
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,502
- Is his hand cupped?
- Yes.

222
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:42,964
- Which one?
- His right.

223
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,690
Break off!

224
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:07,155
Drop it, Wolf!

225
00:30:12,165 --> 00:30:13,992
Drop it, Wolf.

226
00:30:27,222 --> 00:30:29,713
You like D-block, Wolf?

227
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:34,102
You better, because you're gonna
rot there for a long time.

228
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:36,682
D-block, Morris.

229
00:30:37,774 --> 00:30:39,683
Look, he came at me.

230
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:41,401
I said D-block.

231
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:05,083
When I get out, you're dead.

232
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:07,715
You'll be dead before you get out.

233
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:22,670
Warden don't like inmates fighting.

234
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:27,752
Don't like 'em stinking up
their cells, either.

235
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:56,913
Lights out!

236
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:33,364
Go on back to your cell.

237
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:19,966
Welcome to Alcatraz.

238
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:31,691
- Hey, is anybody over there?
- Yeah, me.

239
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,697
Come out in front and say hello.

240
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:36,574
Busy.

241
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:40,491
How busy can you be
in one of these closets?

242
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,670
Don't worry. I washed it.

243
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:56,511
How you doing, neighbour?
I'm Charley Butts.

244
00:35:59,808 --> 00:36:01,682
Smallest cell I ever been in.

245
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:05,268
- You'll get used to it.
- I don't think so.

246
00:36:05,355 --> 00:36:08,107
I don't like living alone here.

247
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:10,398
You'll get used to that, too.

248
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:13,524
Break out!

249
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:22,864
Yard time!

250
00:36:30,214 --> 00:36:32,171
Button the collar.

251
00:36:35,177 --> 00:36:36,885
Who's the new fish?

252
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,426
I got him next to me.

253
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:42,088
- What's your name?
- Charley Butts.

254
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:43,678
Charley's butt?

255
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:46,723
Butts. Butts. Charley Butts.

256
00:36:46,814 --> 00:36:48,972
You got a funny name, kid.

257
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,691
Yeah? What's your name?

258
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:52,401
Al Capone.

259
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,486
Thought you were dead.

260
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:59,522
Me? I got too much money.
I'll never die.

261
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:02,703
- You play poker?
- Not much.

262
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:06,122
I just learned myself.
We'll play tomorrow.

263
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:08,117
See you later, kid.

264
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,084
See you later, Al.

265
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:13,125
I don't believe
l just met Al Capone.

266
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:14,710
I don't, either.

267
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,422
- I'm Doc.
- Charley Butts.

268
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:19,551
How's the painting going, Doc?

269
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:23,719
The one of the warden?
It's nearly finished.

270
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:27,641
- You painting the warden?
- He's very inspiring.

271
00:38:38,218 --> 00:38:40,543
Inside. Everybody in.

272
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:48,181
Yes, sir?

273
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,691
I want painting privileges
taken away from Chester Dalton.

274
00:38:53,775 --> 00:38:57,144
- Doc?
- Cell 233.

275
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:58,731
What's the reason?

276
00:38:58,822 --> 00:39:01,693
You're deputy warden.
You think of one.

277
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:04,784
When do you want
the suspension to begin?

278
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,954
It's not a suspension.
It's an elimination.

279
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:14,083
- Right away.
- Yes, sir.

280
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:22,088
Painting privileges
have been removed.

281
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:33,729
Why?

282
00:39:33,816 --> 00:39:35,440
I don't know.

283
00:39:54,587 --> 00:39:56,710
Painting's all I have.

284
00:39:59,091 --> 00:40:00,550
I'm sorry, Doc.

285
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,082
You OK, Doc?

286
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:36,790
I think there's
something wrong with him.

287
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:24,170
I'd keep my eye on Doc.
He seems pretty upset.

288
00:41:24,261 --> 00:41:26,930
Cons are always upset
about something.

289
00:41:27,013 --> 00:41:28,673
Put your overalls on.

290
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:35,726
Mr Zimmerman,
l'm making a new table.

291
00:41:35,814 --> 00:41:37,641
I need a hatchet.

292
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:45,196
Bob, get Doc a hatchet.

293
00:42:11,183 --> 00:42:13,140
Mr Zimmerman!

294
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:16,144
Can you come over here
for a minute?

295
00:42:43,758 --> 00:42:46,759
Get him out of here! Get him out!

296
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:52,382
Take him out of here! Get him out!

297
00:42:56,812 --> 00:42:58,390
Get back to work.

298
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:05,236
Let's go! Move!

299
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:10,234
Everybody, back to work! Let's go!

300
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:12,470
Here. Put that in your report.

301
00:45:11,198 --> 00:45:13,950
What were you doing
back there, boy?

302
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:19,120
- How about a magazine?
- Why not?

303
00:45:19,206 --> 00:45:22,741
What do you want? Boy's Life?

304
00:45:22,835 --> 00:45:27,164
I know some queens
who fight over it every month.

305
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:30,174
Just give me what
you got on top there.

306
00:45:37,225 --> 00:45:39,716
I heard about Doc,

307
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,977
and I know why he did it.

308
00:45:47,193 --> 00:45:50,277
Somebody took away
his painting privileges.

309
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:51,857
Who?

310
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:56,735
The warden.

311
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,917
Morris.

312
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:21,309
I hear there was an accident
in one of the shops.

313
00:46:21,394 --> 00:46:24,146
Accident? You mean Doc.

314
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,350
Yeah, someone didn't like
what he was painting,

315
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:29,731
so someone won't let him paint.

316
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:34,066
Someone should have warned Doc
to be careful what he paints.

317
00:46:34,157 --> 00:46:36,730
I think you're absolutely right, sir.

318
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:38,866
There's always the possibility

319
00:46:38,954 --> 00:46:42,157
that some asshole will be offended,
isn't there?

320
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:44,372
We all have to be careful.

321
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,126
Back in line.

322
00:47:01,226 --> 00:47:03,219
Hey, how's it going, Frank?

323
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,472
Well, well.
If it isn't the Anglins.

324
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:09,724
What are you guys doing,
just dropping by?

325
00:47:09,818 --> 00:47:13,863
- Thought we'd pay you a visit.
- Gonna stay long?

326
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:17,114
Not long. Only about 15 or 20 years.

327
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,743
Why The Rock?

328
00:47:18,827 --> 00:47:22,872
We were leaving Atlanta when
we encountered a minor problem.

329
00:47:22,956 --> 00:47:25,447
- Such as?
- They saw us.

330
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,749
Yeah, that do present problems.

331
00:47:27,836 --> 00:47:29,746
They shipped us to Leavenworth.

332
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:32,460
But we didn't like
their accommodations, either.

333
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:36,796
Warden said he knew
just the place for us... Alcatraz.

334
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:41,715
Is it true no one's
ever bust out of here?

335
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:44,560
- So they tell me.
- Jesus.

336
00:47:46,105 --> 00:47:48,678
Wonder what l'd be like
after 15 years here.

337
00:48:54,841 --> 00:48:56,880
You still reading that bible?

338
00:48:56,968 --> 00:49:00,800
Yeah. It's opening up
all kinds of new doors.

339
00:49:17,197 --> 00:49:20,780
I turned 35 today. Some birthday.

340
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:26,152
- When's your birthday?
- I don't know.

341
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:29,118
Jeez, what kind of
childhood did you have?

342
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:31,083
Short.

343
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:39,752
I always wanted to see San Francisco.
Never thought it'd be like this.

344
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:42,762
What'd you get sent to the rock for?

345
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:47,640
Couple of years ago I started
stealing cars, for kicks mostly.

346
00:49:47,728 --> 00:49:52,853
I'd sell the parts.
Got sent to the state pen.

347
00:49:52,941 --> 00:49:55,148
You end up in Alcatraz for that?

348
00:49:55,235 --> 00:49:58,106
Not exactly. A bull there
liked to push me around.

349
00:49:58,197 --> 00:50:02,740
So when I got out,
l went back, and stole his car.

350
00:50:02,826 --> 00:50:06,029
Unfortunately,
l drove it across the state line,

351
00:50:06,121 --> 00:50:11,163
which made it a federal rap,
and I was sent to the rock.

352
00:50:13,754 --> 00:50:17,170
English! Visitor for you.

353
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,630
Butts, you got a visitor.

354
00:50:23,722 --> 00:50:26,011
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

355
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,769
Probably somebody
wants their car back.

356
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:53,043
Hello, father.

357
00:50:59,091 --> 00:51:01,001
Why didn't you say you were coming?

358
00:51:01,093 --> 00:51:04,545
I was afraid you wouldn't let me.

359
00:51:06,307 --> 00:51:08,715
It's just hard to see you like this.

360
00:51:13,856 --> 00:51:15,896
Your mama's going to die.

361
00:51:26,244 --> 00:51:27,786
Charley?

362
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:32,374
When?

363
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:36,587
Well, she's got a few months.

364
00:51:37,797 --> 00:51:39,624
Can you call her?

365
00:51:41,759 --> 00:51:43,799
We're not allowed
to make phone calls.

366
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:48,050
You cannot discuss institution rules.
Stick to your personal life.

367
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:52,221
This is my personal life!
You getting a kick out of it?

368
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:54,136
Hello?

369
00:51:55,398 --> 00:51:56,809
Hello!

370
00:51:59,861 --> 00:52:06,279
I... love... you... Charley.

371
00:52:32,227 --> 00:52:33,638
Hey, Frank.

372
00:52:35,647 --> 00:52:37,058
Yeah?

373
00:52:37,149 --> 00:52:40,434
If you try to get out, I want in.

374
00:52:57,628 --> 00:53:01,163
- Must be Wednesday.
- Why?

375
00:53:01,256 --> 00:53:03,166
Mystery mounds.

376
00:53:03,258 --> 00:53:06,010
We always have
mystery mounds on Wednesday.

377
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:09,795
I can't taste it.
I just eat it out of habit.

378
00:53:14,186 --> 00:53:19,014
- What's the movie this weekend?
- Some cowboy piece of shit.

379
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:23,604
Hey, at least they could
show us a gangster movie.

380
00:53:27,658 --> 00:53:29,698
I may have found a way out of here.

381
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:38,291
You looking at something?

382
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:48,461
This cell block's really getting old.

383
00:53:48,554 --> 00:53:54,178
The moist air corrodes the concrete.
The salt is rusting the metal.

384
00:53:54,268 --> 00:53:58,765
I took a nail clipper, and dug around
the grille at the back of the cell.

385
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:01,145
I can dig that grille out,

386
00:54:01,234 --> 00:54:04,354
and enlarge the hole
into the utility corridor

387
00:54:04,445 --> 00:54:09,273
to the top of the cell block
and maybe onto the roof.

388
00:54:09,367 --> 00:54:11,858
How will we hide the hole?

389
00:54:12,996 --> 00:54:17,076
We tear the ads from magazines...
no one will miss those...

390
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:22,125
make cardboard, paint grilles
on that, and put it in the hole,

391
00:54:22,213 --> 00:54:25,713
maybe partially obscure it
with a towel or whatever.

392
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,094
I've ordered an accordion
to put in front of my hole.

393
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:34,723
Suppose we make it. They'll know
we're gone at the next count.

394
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:39,139
We'll leave at night,
so they won't know till the morning.

395
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:42,101
We'll have to make some dummy heads,

396
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:45,691
make them out of plaster
or cardboard or whatever.

397
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:49,278
Put them in the bunks,
the guards won't know.

398
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:52,735
You work in the barbershop.
You get the hair.

399
00:54:52,828 --> 00:54:55,200
How do we cross the bay?

400
00:54:55,288 --> 00:54:59,416
That's your job.
You work in the clothing shop.

401
00:54:59,501 --> 00:55:03,712
You're gonna steal some raincoats
and some contact cement.

402
00:55:03,797 --> 00:55:06,714
We'll make a life raft
and some life preservers.

403
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,006
I read how to do it
in Popular Mechanics.

404
00:55:09,094 --> 00:55:11,134
They'll think we're going to Frisco.

405
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:14,970
Well, we won't.
We'll go to Angel lsland instead.

406
00:55:17,936 --> 00:55:20,178
What about me?

407
00:55:20,272 --> 00:55:24,768
You'll stand guard while I dig.
I'll stand guard while you dig.

408
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,565
You two trade off the same way.

409
00:55:32,076 --> 00:55:33,902
What are our chances?

410
00:55:33,994 --> 00:55:36,236
Slim.

411
00:55:37,456 --> 00:55:39,828
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

412
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:41,328
I wanna go.

413
00:55:51,512 --> 00:55:53,089
Charley.

414
00:55:54,223 --> 00:55:55,386
Yeah?

415
00:55:55,474 --> 00:55:58,760
I'm gonna start digging.
Keep an eye out.

416
00:55:58,853 --> 00:56:01,937
If you see one,
start whistling, huh?

417
00:57:00,248 --> 00:57:02,157
How's it going?

418
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,661
Fair.

419
00:57:10,592 --> 00:57:13,676
Whoever named this place
The Rock wasn't kidding.

420
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:17,842
Working with those nail clippers
just doesn't have any grip.

421
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:37,409
Hey, guard.

422
00:57:42,165 --> 00:57:43,244
Yeah?

423
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:47,413
Can I exchange this spoon? Looks
like it's been in someone's ass.

424
00:57:47,504 --> 00:57:50,588
And I want to work in the kitchen.

425
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,048
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

426
00:58:05,022 --> 00:58:07,773
I'd like to join the kitchen detail.

427
00:58:07,858 --> 00:58:08,973
Can you cook?

428
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:11,440
Can I swap this spoon for another?

429
00:58:11,528 --> 00:58:13,485
Damn right I can cook.

430
00:58:13,572 --> 00:58:18,993
I used to be a cook in this café.
Everybody loved my meatballs.

431
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,236
Did you quit or get fired?

432
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,903
Neither. I robbed the café.

433
00:58:39,473 --> 00:58:42,925
- Heard you had a visitor.
- My daughter.

434
00:58:43,018 --> 00:58:45,391
She's getting married.

435
00:58:45,479 --> 00:58:47,555
He's white...

436
00:58:47,648 --> 00:58:49,771
just like you.

437
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,686
Congratulations.

438
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:57,531
- Want a magazine?
- Yeah. What do you recommend?

439
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,280
Ebony.

440
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:08,786
Hey, English.

441
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:15,090
Is it possible to weld two pieces
of metal together here in the cell?

442
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,798
For digging... or sticking?

443
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,389
Digging.

444
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:27,051
It ain't easy, but I could show you.

445
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,554
Planning on going somewhere?

446
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:37,312
There hasn't been a day
that l've been on this rock

447
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,732
that I didn't think of busting out.

448
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:45,247
If l'd known, l'd have slashed
my throat instead of my tendon.

449
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,423
Hey, Litmus, can you get me a dime?

450
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,296
No problem. Cost you 10 desserts.

451
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,046
I need it tonight.

452
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,629
No problem. Cost you an extra five.

453
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:07,635
Get me a dime, l'll toss in
10 beetles for your mouse.

454
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:57,935
Thanks.

455
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:49,423
Hey, Frank, what's burning?

456
01:02:51,603 --> 01:02:55,766
If you see one of those bulls
coming, just start whistling.

457
01:04:01,131 --> 01:04:03,669
Hey, Spoof, what's for breakfast?

458
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:38,703
I smell something burning.

459
01:04:39,837 --> 01:04:41,746
I don't smell anything.

460
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,834
Hell, must be my imagination.

461
01:04:44,926 --> 01:04:48,092
Working nights
really gets to you after a while.

462
01:04:50,598 --> 01:04:52,638
Try it from my side.

463
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:13,911
Keep an eye out. He may be back.

464
01:06:02,462 --> 01:06:05,463
The grille's welded
on two-hook anchors?

465
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:10,792
If I get a wedge I may be able
to knock those anchors loose.

466
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:27,271
This might just be
what l'm looking for.

467
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:30,897
But it won't get through
the metal detector.

468
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:32,783
Yeah, I know.

469
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,281
Morris, hold it.

470
01:06:41,377 --> 01:06:44,082
I made it for a clothes-peg.

471
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:46,128
Why the metal over the edge?

472
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:48,884
So the clothes would slide off easy.

473
01:06:48,968 --> 01:06:51,091
I don't believe you.

474
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:55,508
I didn't try to hide it. Why would l
try to take metal through a detector?

475
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,885
Because you're stupid.

476
01:07:00,396 --> 01:07:01,559
Move it.

477
01:10:46,374 --> 01:10:48,201
Open up 107.

478
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,164
Why did you order this stuff?
You don't look like a painter.

479
01:10:56,259 --> 01:10:59,877
You wouldn't know talent
if it looked you in the face.

480
01:10:59,971 --> 01:11:04,099
I'm looking you in the face
and I don't see shit.

481
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,358
Hair. Your colour.

482
01:11:20,617 --> 01:11:22,028
Frank.

483
01:11:24,204 --> 01:11:27,703
Paint. One of them's flesh-coloured.

484
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:29,700
What are you painting?

485
01:11:29,793 --> 01:11:32,711
I don't know. The ocean maybe.

486
01:11:32,796 --> 01:11:37,043
If you're using flesh-coloured paint,
you better paint a portrait.

487
01:11:38,177 --> 01:11:39,375
Yeah.

488
01:15:53,726 --> 01:15:54,889
Frank.

489
01:15:57,522 --> 01:15:58,850
Frank.

490
01:16:11,578 --> 01:16:14,247
Morris go to sleep early tonight?

491
01:16:14,331 --> 01:16:16,703
Yeah. Wasn't feeling well.

492
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:20,789
He must sleep pretty soundly.
He hasn't moved.

493
01:16:48,198 --> 01:16:49,443
Morris?

494
01:16:50,617 --> 01:16:52,444
Yeah, what's up?

495
01:16:57,624 --> 01:17:00,294
I went up top last night.

496
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:04,505
I saw the ventilator shart
to the roof, but I can't reach it.

497
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:06,416
I need a boost.

498
01:17:08,177 --> 01:17:10,383
How are you all coming?

499
01:17:10,471 --> 01:17:12,131
My dummy's ready.

500
01:17:12,222 --> 01:17:16,303
The hole's done,
but l'm just starting the dummy.

501
01:17:16,393 --> 01:17:18,350
I ain't doing too good.

502
01:17:20,814 --> 01:17:23,732
Tonight, John and I will go up.

503
01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:34,445
You get those raincoats,
might as well start hauling them up.

504
01:17:34,537 --> 01:17:37,324
I'll wear one back
from the shop each day.

505
01:17:37,414 --> 01:17:40,499
There's a different hack
there in the afternoon.

506
01:17:40,584 --> 01:17:42,873
He'll think I wore it to work.

507
01:17:42,962 --> 01:17:47,505
- Can you get that contact cement?
- I keep inventory.

508
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:45,564
Hey!

509
01:18:52,282 --> 01:18:54,073
Give me a boost.

510
01:19:00,415 --> 01:19:02,740
The bars feel pretty solid.

511
01:19:04,252 --> 01:19:08,499
There seems to be a metal hood
riveted onto higher uprights.

512
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:12,919
We'll spread the bars
with a pipe and knock the hood off.

513
01:19:15,388 --> 01:19:17,298
There's an electrical outlet here.

514
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:22,385
Get a motor, a drill bit and
a flashlight and we'd have it all.

515
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:24,935
Great.
Where's the nearest hardware store?

516
01:19:44,793 --> 01:19:49,336
Can you get me an extension cord
and a drill bit from the shop?

517
01:19:49,423 --> 01:19:52,839
If they find out, I go to the hole.

518
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:58,301
All right, but from now on,
you put your desserts onto my tray.

519
01:20:00,768 --> 01:20:03,852
Time's up. Back to the cells.

520
01:20:03,938 --> 01:20:07,852
Damn it! Just when
l thought we was doing good.

521
01:20:14,156 --> 01:20:15,615
I can use this.

522
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,408
Are you crazy?

523
01:20:45,813 --> 01:20:47,687
Hold it, Morris.

524
01:20:49,442 --> 01:20:51,399
Want to look at one of those cases.

525
01:20:57,992 --> 01:20:59,534
Try this one.

526
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,540
Let's open it up.

527
01:21:19,556 --> 01:21:22,640
Stole this penlight from the Doc.

528
01:23:06,872 --> 01:23:08,248
Hey.

529
01:23:11,502 --> 01:23:12,913
Give me a boost.

530
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,011
Pipe.

531
01:24:10,728 --> 01:24:14,560
OK. Hand me the drill.

532
01:25:10,789 --> 01:25:13,078
We're all through.

533
01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:30,431
Fire!

534
01:25:30,517 --> 01:25:34,218
Hey, 50-millimetre guns.

535
01:25:36,398 --> 01:25:38,889
I'm worried about the shakedowns.

536
01:25:38,984 --> 01:25:41,475
My cardboard grille
keeps slipping out.

537
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:44,061
Put some contact cement
around the edges.

538
01:25:44,156 --> 01:25:46,528
That should take care of it.

539
01:25:52,456 --> 01:25:55,790
How's the raft
and the life jackets coming?

540
01:25:55,876 --> 01:25:57,916
OK.

541
01:25:58,004 --> 01:26:00,292
I think they'll be done Tuesday.

542
01:26:02,383 --> 01:26:04,423
Tuesday night, we go.

543
01:26:24,405 --> 01:26:26,528
What's that for?

544
01:26:26,616 --> 01:26:28,905
Just thinking about Doc.

545
01:26:28,993 --> 01:26:33,287
Yeah. We planted
those chrysanthemums 15 years ago.

546
01:26:33,373 --> 01:26:36,872
They meant a lot to Doc. To me, too.

547
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,660
- I had a garden.
- What'd you grow, weeds?

548
01:26:40,755 --> 01:26:44,254
It's against regulations,
Morris, and you know it.

549
01:26:58,106 --> 01:26:59,565
Stretcher.

550
01:27:00,692 --> 01:27:02,483
Get the medic.

551
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:04,111
He won't need one.

552
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:19,417
Some men are destined
never to leave Alcatraz...

553
01:27:22,798 --> 01:27:24,292
alive.

554
01:27:40,065 --> 01:27:42,105
Got those books that may help you.

555
01:27:42,192 --> 01:27:43,651
Thanks.

556
01:27:45,195 --> 01:27:46,654
See you later, man.

557
01:27:46,738 --> 01:27:49,490
Goodbye... boy.

558
01:28:08,302 --> 01:28:11,469
So long... boy.

559
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:28,525
Shakedown.

560
01:28:34,203 --> 01:28:35,366
Move.

561
01:28:35,454 --> 01:28:37,743
Move, move, move.

562
01:28:50,136 --> 01:28:51,796
Take a seat.

563
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:38,178
- Been playing this thing long?
- Couple of months.

564
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,687
- You any good?
- Terrible.

565
01:29:46,484 --> 01:29:48,726
You'll get better.

566
01:29:58,622 --> 01:29:59,617
Excuse me.

567
01:30:08,381 --> 01:30:12,130
That's one of the benefits
of Alcatraz.

568
01:30:12,219 --> 01:30:14,544
Lots of time to practise.

569
01:30:18,558 --> 01:30:22,307
Has Morris
been doing anything unusual?

570
01:30:22,396 --> 01:30:25,681
Sometimes he stays up late
talking with Butts.

571
01:30:25,774 --> 01:30:28,099
Split them up. Move Morris.

572
01:30:28,193 --> 01:30:32,273
I'll have to get a cell ready
and do the paperwork.

573
01:30:32,364 --> 01:30:34,606
- Do you?
- Yes, sir.

574
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,903
We could move him, say, Wednesday.

575
01:30:37,995 --> 01:30:40,865
- Tuesday morning.
- Yes, sir.

576
01:30:54,386 --> 01:30:56,260
I missed you, Morris.

577
01:30:56,347 --> 01:31:00,973
I missed you so much,
l got a present for you.

578
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,729
I'll give it to you... later.

579
01:31:04,939 --> 01:31:07,015
Get your ass back there.

580
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:18,690
He'll kill you,
or you'll have to kill him.

581
01:31:18,786 --> 01:31:22,285
Well, l'm not going
to give him the chance.

582
01:31:22,373 --> 01:31:26,750
Can you get the raft
and life jackets ready by tonight?

583
01:31:27,962 --> 01:31:29,337
All right.

584
01:31:29,422 --> 01:31:33,965
We'll meet on top
as soon as the lights are out.

585
01:31:50,276 --> 01:31:53,894
- Wolf, you carrying?
- Who, me?

586
01:31:58,368 --> 01:31:59,862
Move out.

587
01:32:40,744 --> 01:32:42,487
Where you going, Wolfie?

588
01:32:42,579 --> 01:32:45,496
I'm just going for a walk.

589
01:32:45,582 --> 01:32:47,705
Let's take that walk.

590
01:32:55,384 --> 01:32:58,088
After six months in the hole,

591
01:32:58,178 --> 01:33:02,639
Iooks like you could
use some exercise.

592
01:33:07,604 --> 01:33:09,229
Butts.

593
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:12,515
I'll meet you up on top.

594
01:33:16,155 --> 01:33:17,779
Let's go.

595
01:33:31,754 --> 01:33:34,790
Yeah. You're going, too.

596
01:35:02,345 --> 01:35:03,887
Butts.

597
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:10,345
Butts, God damn it.

598
01:41:15,138 --> 01:41:18,389
Can't risk tearing this gear,
what's left of it.

599
01:41:18,475 --> 01:41:21,262
Throw me the stuff when I get over.

600
01:42:05,981 --> 01:42:07,808
Watch the barbed wire.

601
01:46:06,057 --> 01:46:08,180
Get up, Morris. It's moving day.

602
01:46:10,061 --> 01:46:13,098
I said, get up, Morris. Open up 109.

603
01:46:15,108 --> 01:46:17,895
God damn it, Morris. I said get...

604
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:21,905
Jesus Christ.

605
01:47:00,863 --> 01:47:03,270
Morning, Sergeant. What have you got?

606
01:47:03,365 --> 01:47:06,035
Photos and a notebook
of Clarence Anglin's.

607
01:47:06,118 --> 01:47:07,493
Funny looking bag.

608
01:47:07,578 --> 01:47:10,579
Must have been made from a raincoat.

609
01:47:11,457 --> 01:47:14,030
- It appears that they drowned.
- Why?

610
01:47:14,126 --> 01:47:17,994
If that was important
they wouldn't have lost it.

611
01:47:18,088 --> 01:47:21,920
Maybe they lost it
to look like they drowned.

612
01:48:02,967 --> 01:48:07,261
Warden, I just got a message
from the Director.

613
01:48:07,347 --> 01:48:09,719
He wants you in Washington.

614
01:48:09,807 --> 01:48:12,133
Do chrysanthemums grow
on this island?

615
01:48:12,226 --> 01:48:14,682
Not here on Angel lsland. Why?

616
01:48:14,771 --> 01:48:16,810
I'm curious.

617
01:48:17,732 --> 01:48:22,809
The tides were mild
and the fog light last night.

618
01:48:24,197 --> 01:48:29,440
If they left at lights out,
they had a 91/2-hour head start.

619
01:48:29,536 --> 01:48:31,861
I wonder if they made it.

620
01:48:31,955 --> 01:48:34,078
They drowned.

621
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,042
Yes, sir.
