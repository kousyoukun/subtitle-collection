1
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,766
I told you, I told you.

2
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,693
Thirty-one flavors and I got them all!

3
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,212
Relax. Don't look at me like that.

4
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:22,471
This man can make you world champ.

5
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,955
What's wrong with you guys?

6
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,375
That's Ray Arcel.

7
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,389
Now you got two trainers.
You got Panama. Our Panama.

8
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,224
And you got the man who knows...

9
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,226
You really have balls, Eleta.

10
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,730
I'm trying to make you world champ.
You don't wanna be world champ?

11
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,189
You gonna eat all that shit?

12
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,317
Of course! I bought it!

13
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,033
Mom, got food!

14
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,077
Gun shots, Roberto, hide down here!

15
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,626
What are you doing down there, you crazy?

16
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,004
Mangoes!

17
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,181
Wait!

18
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,849
Did you steal that?

19
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:39,144
Mom, you know me, I don't need to steal.

20
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,400
Where did you find that?

21
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,361
I got paid for my work.

22
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,242
Thanks, son.

23
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,052
Mangoes for everyone!

24
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,514
Now everyone say thanks for the mangoes.

25
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,307
Thanks for the mangoes.

26
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,726
If it's mine it's yours.

27
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,396
And if it's ours it's yours.

28
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,981
Thank you.

29
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,776
Left, Left, Left, Right, Left.

30
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,662
Run! We are late!

31
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:29,421
Use your jab. Don't lower your guard.

32
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,595
Sir.

33
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,058
What's up, kid?

34
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,018
Would you train me?

35
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,354
Go to school. We are working here.

36
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,938
You gonna pay for school?

37
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,986
Just go, kid.

38
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,197
All good.

39
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,828
Shut up and box.

40
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,166
Boxing is fighting,
all you do is dance like my sisters.

41
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,974
Stand up you coward!

42
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,481
We are rich!

43
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,359
I didn't know you liked to fight!

44
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,945
You see? I'm gonna be world champ!

45
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,239
Then you gotta take me to NY.

46
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,616
Let's go eat!

47
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,954
Hide the money!

48
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,415
Give me that money, kid.

49
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,418
Give me the money.

50
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,502
I got no money.

51
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,842
He's just a kid!

52
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,144
- Wassup, kid?
- Wassup.

53
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,937
- All good?
- Yes.

54
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,149
Clearly, all is great.

55
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,070
I can get you out.

56
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,157
But let me be clear...

57
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,576
If you are caught fighting or stealing...

58
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,788
I'll bring you back myself
and leave you here.

59
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,166
So you are gonna train me?

60
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,019
They're not all gonna be this easy.

61
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,645
Sometimes...

62
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,231
You need to get points.

63
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,527
There's technique...

64
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,528
Rules.

65
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,280
Cheats.

66
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,491
Movement.

67
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,829
You learning everything I tell you?

68
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,289
I learn anything you want...

69
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,250
as long as you get me an ice cream...

70
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,377
every time I kill one of those fuckers.

71
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,747
Stand up you coward!

72
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,136
Baby.

73
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,722
Turn around.

74
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:11,560
Blondie.

75
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,811
What's your name?

76
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,983
Did the mice eat your tongue?

77
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,820
You're not going to give me your name?

78
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,450
Happiness.

79
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:34,249
You are kidding me, right?
Your name is happiness?

80
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,752
Let me guess. It's what you've
been looking for all your life?

81
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,255
The poor are born happy.

82
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,718
Only the rich know sadness.

83
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,764
And you still leave?

84
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,558
Come here!

85
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,476
Where are you taking me?

86
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,979
It's okay, I don't bite.

87
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,939
You are nuts.

88
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,649
Marry me!

89
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,067
I don't even know you!

90
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,068
Exactly.

91
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,654
We'll get the rest
of our lives to know each other.

92
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,365
You really are crazy.

93
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,742
Crazy for you.

94
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,202
I can't change who I am.

95
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,079
Then you need to forget about me.

96
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,623
You're going to leave me here?

97
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,000
You are the one who won't forget me!

98
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,670
You'll be drawing hearts in your notebook.

99
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,673
You are done, you turned...

100
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,051
And you fell in love.

101
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,261
You're crazy!

102
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,182
What's up? What's that spaceship?

103
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,104
Jeez, he's intense!

104
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,650
This is Carlos Eleta,
the richest man in Panama.

105
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,902
I've been looking for you for an hour!

106
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,570
Stop screaming in front of everyone.

107
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,866
I wanted to meet you.

108
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,160
I hear you are unbeatable.

109
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,581
When you fight clowns it's easy to win.

110
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,960
You wanna be world champ? I can help you.

111
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,088
Yes.

112
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,924
He's looking.

113
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,553
Gonna take you to Madison Square Garden.

114
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,097
Let's go right away.

115
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,350
This is your plane?

116
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,063
Don't look, don't look.

117
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,990
Hey, you are the boxer.

118
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,368
Yes.

119
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,661
And you are?

120
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,830
I heard you won.

121
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,583
Yeah, that was easy.

122
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,585
Now I'm going for the world championship.

123
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:17,837
That's good.

124
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,505
Can I walk with you?

125
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,632
What school did you go to?

126
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:27,013
I went to the Plomo Quiñones school.

127
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:31,100
Now I'm in the Ray Arcel.

128
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,604
Ray Arcel?

129
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,689
American school?

130
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,484
Yes, American school.

131
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,528
You didn't go to school, did you?

132
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,533
But you can read, right?

133
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,995
This is like a job interview.

134
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,706
I thought I was walking you home.

135
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,750
Yes.

136
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,177
I can continue alone.

137
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,804
Why?

138
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,357
We come from different worlds.

139
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,619
What?

140
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,602
Come see.

141
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:44,275
This is the kitchen.

142
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,989
My heavy bag.

143
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,367
Some perfumes.

144
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,577
Come see.

145
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,037
I'm looking at it.

146
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,766
You don't like it?

147
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,730
I'm just used to...

148
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,057
He's got a skirt?

149
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,810
He is wearing a skirt, Roberto!

150
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,479
A fuckin' skirt!

151
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,409
Excuse me.

152
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,586
Are they fighting yet?

153
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,713
It's about to start.

154
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,333
Kill him, Cholo!

155
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,397
What's going on?

156
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,947
That's a white bitch, Cholo!

157
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,671
Make him shit his pants!

158
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,618
Yeah, son of a putz.

159
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,923
Open my belly!

160
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,675
Don't open her belly!

161
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,679
How do we call him?

162
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,596
Roberto Duran.

163
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:45,853
It's a girl!

164
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,439
Another girl.

165
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,155
You can't name them all Roberto.

166
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,073
Let's name him Robin, then, like Robin Hood.

167
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:00,159
We fight the rich to give the poor.

168
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:06,039
Another boy and his name is Roberto Durán.

169
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,916
And I don't wanna hear it.

170
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,840
The stone is here!

171
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:17,843
This is my hood!

172
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:27,936
How are the girls? Did you eat?

173
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:28,979
Yes!

174
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,565
Get some sodas.

175
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:46,121
Look how happy everyone is.

176
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,752
Thanks for the food, Durán.

177
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,428
Jump! Jump!

178
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,449
Dear Mr. President Carter.

179
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,495
In the name of the truth of logic,
I would like to say,

180
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,122
that we will sign this treaty.

181
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,250
He's signing the treaty!

182
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:38,715
The treaty is signed! The Canal is ours!

183
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,217
Blondie!

184
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:45,222
They're gonna give us the canal!

185
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:48,100
General Torrijos signed the treaty!

186
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:51,478
See to believe the word of a Yankee.

187
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,398
Come see what I got you.

188
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,441
But wait... this is important.

189
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:00,487
- Torrijos is good with the people.
- You wanna see the real Panama canal?

190
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:04,491
I've seen that tiny canal a million times.

191
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,953
You say that because
all you have is a sail boat.

192
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:12,749
A sail boat? I got the Titanic here.

193
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,668
Sink it then.

194
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,504
All Panama is celebrating in the streets

195
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,381
and you are not even happy?

196
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,009
Happy about what?

197
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,677
About what?

198
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:27,222
You've obviously never been
chased by a Marine.

199
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,724
Excuse me?

200
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:29,766
Rich girl.

201
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:31,768
Get off me.

202
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,645
Now you gonna get mad?

203
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:35,689
Yes. You're talking shit.

204
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:41,653
They offer to return your own territory in 1999.

205
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:42,988
In twenty years!

206
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:47,200
For fuck's sake, it's ours!

207
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,119
And it has nothing to do with being rich or poor.

208
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:51,246
It's common sense.

209
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:57,127
Now this is fucked.
I'm celebrating and you are pissed.

210
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,549
If you wanna make your people proud,

211
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,761
this is the guy to beat.

212
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,097
What does it say?

213
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,019
When are you gonna learn to read?

214
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,145
What does it say?

215
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,230
It says "Fighter of the year".

216
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,775
Fighter of the year? This clown?

217
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,319
He hasn't fought a man in his life.

218
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,405
He is the symbol of American sports.

219
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,948
My balls.

220
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:36,708
He's the symbol of American Sports.

221
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:40,504
If you want your Torrijos-Carter treaty...

222
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,882
to mean anything for this country...

223
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,968
before 1999...

224
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:53,683
destroy their idol
and make them respect Panama.

225
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,561
That idol goes down in one round.

226
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,605
Let me see it.

227
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,565
For you I got 15 rounds or more.

228
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,317
Respect, Durán. He's with his wife.

229
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,507
Why are you here?

230
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,512
If Ray finds out you are dead.

231
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:24,013
I can't sleep.

232
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,808
What's wrong?

233
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:31,354
I don't want to disappoint tomorrow.

234
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,647
Dad!

235
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,235
My babies! Good morning!

236
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:40,447
Kisses for Daddy.

237
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,824
Can't wait to see you kill that coward!

238
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:44,284
Don't say that!

239
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:47,036
But Dad said it on TV.

240
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,998
It's my job to say those things.

241
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,125
So you're not gonna kill him?

242
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,919
Of course, I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

243
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:58,173
It's all a show.
He says that so the fight is more fun.

244
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,257
Come get dressed.

245
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,069
Fuckin' Cholo!

246
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,812
You won, my love!

247
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,041
Be calm, my love.

248
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,253
You've proven yourself.

249
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:32,343
I'm exhausted.

250
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,221
I've been calling you for a week.

251
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:37,890
What's up, Eleta?

252
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:44,688
Who?

253
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,024
What do you mean who? Leonard!

254
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:50,027
Leonard? What is he a masochist?

255
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:03,541
He must be desperate.

256
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,588
Look at me.

257
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:13,842
Pay attention.

258
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,591
Now you are mad?

259
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,639
What the hell are you doing?

260
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,475
Can't you see you got us all wet?

261
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,686
You are a fuckin' parasite too!

262
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:09,773
I'm telling you to get out you idiot!

263
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,525
Rob, what are you doing?

264
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:13,527
He got me soaked.

265
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,237
Get out I said!

266
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:18,449
This is my fuckin' house, you moron.

267
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:22,911
Get out or I'll get in and break you.

268
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,663
It's Chaflan, Rob!

269
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:25,748
Stop it, it's Chaflan.

270
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:41,930
Chivo, where's the Cholo?

271
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:18,384
That's the man, talk to him.

272
01:03:03,572 --> 01:03:05,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

273
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,285
I bring you this show from Las Vegas.

274
01:03:08,327 --> 01:03:14,166
Don't miss this international show
for all Panamanians.

275
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:22,341
Let's play a game.
Everyone look at the ball...

276
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:26,428
Hold right there!

277
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,430
I'm hungry, man.

278
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:29,431
Catch him!

279
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:02,214
A bit salty...

280
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:04,132
but thank you.

281
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:36,790
Revolting!

282
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:48,302
While you were at your party...

283
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:50,512
What?

284
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,849
Chaflan was killed.

285
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,436
Who told you?

286
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,291
You still mad?

287
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,376
Don't know what to tell you.

288
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:34,337
Forgive me.

289
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:39,134
Okay.

290
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,345
I need you.

291
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:44,556
I don't want to fight.

292
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:46,892
Focus on your training.

293
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:49,102
Why don't you come with the kids?

294
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,771
I wanna see you.

295
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:56,318
You need to rest, Robert. Go to sleep.

296
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:02,282
I love you.

297
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:06,786
Me too.

298
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,018
Stop it.

299
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,523
- Hand me that.
-You can't eat like this.

300
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,150
Pass me that yellow thing.

301
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:52,989
Why didn't I get wings when I asked?

302
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,032
You have plenty.

303
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,534
And why were you looking at Leonard?

304
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,328
Don't start with that.

305
01:14:58,369 --> 01:14:59,787
You think I didn't see you?

306
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,247
Don't fool me.

307
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:04,792
- You think I'm stupid?
-Insane is what you are.

308
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,962
I saw him winking at you.

309
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:10,131
And you were all smiles.

310
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:57,687
What's wrong?

311
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:19,740
Faster, faster!

312
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:27,832
Get in there kids!

313
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:29,917
What's wrong with you?

314
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:33,629
Fuck you all!

315
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,362
Come up here.

316
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:44,783
Get up.

317
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:47,786
Come.

318
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,794
Let's get out of here.

319
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:57,463
This is not life.

320
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:59,673
It's real life.

321
01:27:01,592 --> 01:27:03,302
Your husband got fucked.

322
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:06,013
And everyone calls him a loser.

323
01:27:06,055 --> 01:27:07,306
Show them wrong.

324
01:27:07,348 --> 01:27:08,849
Why?

325
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:10,684
For money?

326
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,063
For the glory of Panama?

327
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:20,361
To hell with this nation of hypocrites.

328
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:28,035
If life is such shit, why don't we stop it
like you stopped the fight?

329
01:27:40,631 --> 01:27:42,549
I'm done.

330
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,970
Go find another woman.

331
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:48,555
I can have thousands of women.

332
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,015
I'm taking the kids.

333
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:51,475
Go to hell, but the kids stay here.

334
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:54,019
I'm leaving with my kids!

335
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:57,398
The kids are mine.

336
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:04,321
What?

337
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,993
Speak for God's sake!

338
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,412
President Torrijos was killed.

339
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:55,331
Get in the ring and I'll kill you.

340
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:57,082
Come have lunch with us, kid.

341
01:28:57,124 --> 01:28:59,126
I don't need your food.

342
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:00,461
I earn my meals fighting.

343
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:02,588
You'll soon be begging for my autograph.

344
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:03,797
Well said, champ.

345
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:05,215
Who says well said?

346
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:08,344
You are not from El Chorrillo anymore.
"No Mas" shit from you.

347
01:29:10,346 --> 01:29:13,724
I'll send you to the morgue
and make you quit again!

348
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:15,893
Ungrateful kid.

349
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:17,770
It's never enough!

350
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:21,273
Without Torrijos' leadership
this country will go to shit.

351
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:23,692
Let's go home, Robert.

352
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,515
They are right.

353
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:59,812
The hope of El Chorrillo walked away.

354
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:05,651
I walked away from the fight.

355
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:10,072
I walked away just like my father.

356
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:30,884
I let them down.

357
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,598
I let them down and I let you down.

358
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:42,229
I don't need to be the champion,

359
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:44,606
but I need to fight.

360
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:51,572
I'm going to fight.

361
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:28,325
- Did Ray come?
-Why are you thinking about Ray?

362
01:39:24,793 --> 01:39:27,212
How are you feeling?

363
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:29,756
I wanna take these gloves off and kill him!

364
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:31,424
That's the way to do it.

365
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:32,384
No mercy.

366
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:33,510
Focus on him.

367
01:39:34,386 --> 01:39:36,513
He's yours. He's already dead.

368
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:37,889
Breathe...

369
01:39:39,391 --> 01:39:41,601
That's it. Let's go.

370
01:39:41,643 --> 01:39:42,686
I love you.

371
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:43,770
You know how much.

372
01:39:43,812 --> 01:39:45,021
You are my son.

373
01:39:45,063 --> 01:39:46,147
You are my hero.

374
01:41:10,023 --> 01:41:12,442
You're back, my love.
