1
00:00:57,760 - - > 00:01:00,843
在这个角落里,罗伯特·杜兰。
2
00:01:07,360 - - > 00:01:10,648
在这个角落,本尼韦尔塔。
3
00:01:27,720 - - > 00:01:29,802
戒指是一种艺术。
4
00:01:33,200 - - > 00:01:38,611
来自上帝的礼物,流出的斗士
像一幅流动的艺术家。
5
00:01:57,440 - - > 00:01:59,920
你拥有它
从你出生的那一天…
6
00:02:01,920 - - > 00:02:06,290
…或者你骂
没有它,直到你死去。
7
00:02:11,880 - - > 00:02:15,930
在66秒,
罗伯特·杜兰改变了我的生活。
8
00:02:37,000 - - > 00:02:39,128
这是他的
9
00:02:39,240 - - > 00:02:43,962
22日击倒在25个打架。
10
00:02:44,080 - - > 00:02:45,923
你可以让他成为一个冠军。
11
00:02:46,040 - - > 00:02:48,930
我知道它。
12
00:02:49,040 - - > 00:02:51,441
我认为你不需要我,卡洛斯。
13
00:02:51,560 - - > 00:02:52,971
我…孩子的一切。
14
00:02:53,080 - - > 00:02:55,560
但他是野生的。
15
00:02:55,680 - - > 00:02:57,330
不守纪律。
16
00:02:57,440 - - > 00:03:01,048
你知道,他不能让这个道路
一个世界冠军。
17
00:03:01,200 - - > 00:03:02,929
他在街头长大。
18
00:03:03,040 - - > 00:03:04,530
了一切,每一个人。
19
00:03:04,640 - - > 00:03:07,605
讨厌一切,
包括美利坚合众国。
20
00:03:07,720 - - > 00:03:09,688
包括美国吗?
21
00:03:11,200 - - > 00:03:14,886
他的父亲是一个美国人
他抛弃了他的母亲。
22
00:03:17,280 - - > 00:03:19,647
你可以帮助他,射线。
23
00:03:19,800 - - > 00:03:21,802
听着,我想培养孩子,我只是……
24
00:03:21,920 - - > 00:03:24,651
我不希望…你知道的…
25
00:03:24,760 - - > 00:03:25,921
这并不容易。
26
00:03:26,040 - - > 00:03:27,849
我不想制造事端。
27
00:03:27,960 - - > 00:03:29,769
聪明的什么,那件事吗?
28
00:03:29,880 - - > 00:03:31,245
这是17年前。
29日
00:03:31,360 - - > 00:03:33,362
——好吧,你认为他们还在乎吗?
-是的,是的。
30
00:03:33,520 - - > 00:03:36,251
我可以支付你在桌子底下。
31日
00:03:36,400 - - > 00:03:37,970
啊,他们知道所有的技巧。
32
00:03:38,080 - - > 00:03:41,448
我唯一能想到的是……
33
00:03:41,560 - - > 00:03:43,130
我要免费训练他。
34
00:03:44,240 - - > 00:03:46,322
这不是一个坏主意。
35
00:03:49,480 - - > 00:03:50,481
乔洛。
36
00:03:50,600 - - > 00:03:51,567
嘿。
37
00:03:51,880 - - > 00:03:55,043
31个味道和我!
38
00:03:55,600 - - > 00:03:59,364
我有人非常非常重要
我想让你见见。
39
00:03:59,480 - - > 00:04:04,202
拳击历史上最好的教练。
40
00:04:05,560 - - > 00:04:06,721
雷Arcel。
41
00:04:06,840 - - > 00:04:11,089
他培养了更多的世界冠军
拳击史上比其他人。
42
00:04:11,560 - - > 00:04:13,244
放松。别那样看着我。
43
00:04:13,360 - - > 00:04:15,044
你在哪里?
44
00:04:15,160 - - > 00:04:16,969
我告诉过你我会给你
麦迪逊广场花园。
45
00:04:17,080 - - > 00:04:18,889
我说过什么吗
没有发生什么?
46
00:04:19,000 - - > 00:04:22,482
这个人会让你的世界冠军。
47
00:04:22,600 - - > 00:04:24,011
我不需要没有人来自美国。
48
00:04:25,480 - - > 00:04:26,481
我知道。
49
00:04:28,760 - - > 00:04:30,489
我得走了。
50
00:04:32,520 - - > 00:04:33,885
嘿,射线,射线,射线,射线。
51
00:04:34,040 - - > 00:04:37,124
很高兴看到你,
卡洛斯,经过这么多年。
52
00:04:37,240 - - > 00:04:39,368
很快我们会讨论。
53
00:04:39,480 - - > 00:04:41,050
谢谢,雷。
54
00:04:41,160 - - > 00:04:42,605
好吧。
55
00:04:42,760 - - > 00:04:45,127
嘿。
56
00:04:46,440 - - > 00:04:48,010
你们有什么问题吗?
57
00:04:49,720 - - > 00:04:51,404
这是雷Arcel
58
00:04:51,560 - - > 00:04:54,564
雷Arcel……18个冠军
59
00:04:54,680 - - > 00:04:55,886
的世界。
60
00:04:56,000 - - > 00:04:57,650
Plomo醌类…
61年
00:04:57,760 - - > 00:05:01,401
大马鲛。
62年
00:05:01,520 - - > 00:05:05,366
现在你有两个教练。
你有巴拿马。我们的巴拿马。
63年
00:05:05,480 - - > 00:05:07,209
和你知道的人……
64年
00:05:07,320 - - > 00:05:09,209
你真的有球,Eleta。
65年
00:05:09,320 - - > 00:05:12,688
我想让你的世界冠军。
你不想成为世界冠军?
66年
00:05:12,800 - - > 00:05:14,165
你要吃大便吗?
67年
00:05:14,280 - - > 00:05:16,362
当然!我买了它!
68年
00:05:51,320 - - > 00:05:54,606
自1903年以来,运河区
是一个美国占有领土
69年
00:05:54,720 - - > 00:05:56,051
在巴拿马的核心。
70年
00:05:56,160 - - > 00:05:57,969
和火箭的红色刺眼……
71年
00:05:58,080 - - > 00:06:01,289
到1964年,张力是空前高涨
72年
00:06:01,400 - - > 00:06:04,370
巴拿马的学生发生冲突
与美国军方
73年
00:06:04,480 - - > 00:06:06,528
他们的国旗
在他们自己的土地。
74年
00:06:06,640 - - > 00:06:08,130
巴拿马万岁!
75年
00:06:08,240 - - > 00:06:11,005
巴拿马!
76年
00:06:11,120 - - > 00:06:13,043
巴拿马!巴拿马!
77年
00:06:24,800 - - > 00:06:26,211
美国!美国!
78年
00:07:22,160 - - > 00:07:23,889
快跑!快跑!
79年
00:07:24,920 - - > 00:07:26,410
走出去,游泳!
80年
00:07:29,360 - - > 00:07:30,407
游泳对你的生活!
81年
00:08:01,720 - - > 00:08:03,848
冲突持续了三天,
82年
00:08:04,000 - - > 00:08:08,282
当它完成后,22个巴拿马人
和四个美国公民已经死了。
83年
00:08:09,360 - - > 00:08:11,010
妈妈,有食物!
84年
00:08:11,120 - - > 00:08:14,090
枪声,罗伯特,躲在这里!
85年
00:08:17,320 - - > 00:08:20,722
你在做什么,你疯了吗?
86年
00:08:21,720 - - > 00:08:24,121
芒果!
87年
00:08:32,400 - - > 00:08:34,129
等等!
88年
00:08:34,280 - - > 00:08:35,805
你偷了吗?
89年
00:08:35,920 - - > 00:08:39,242
妈妈,你知道我,我不需要偷。
90年
00:08:43,800 - - > 00:08:46,041
你在哪里发现?
91年
00:08:46,160 - - > 00:08:47,491
我得到我的工作。
92年
00:08:51,560 - - > 00:08:53,289
谢谢你,儿子。
93年
00:08:53,400 - - > 00:08:55,880
杜兰有几个老师在他的生活中。
94年
00:08:56,000 - - > 00:08:58,162
最重要的一个是Chaflan。
95年
00:09:00,200 - - > 00:09:01,486
他就像魔笛
的社区
96年
00:09:01,640 - - > 00:09:03,165
教孩子们如何生存。
97年
00:09:10,480 - - > 00:09:12,130
芒果为每个人!
98年
00:09:13,160 - - > 00:09:15,481
现在每个人都说谢谢你的芒果。
99年
00:09:15,600 - - > 00:09:17,284
谢谢你的芒果。
100年
00:09:17,400 - - > 00:09:19,687
如果它是我的它是你的。

101
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,371
And if it's ours it's yours.

102
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,209
Thank you.

103
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,767
Left, Left, Left, Right, Left.

104
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,410
Numero dos!

105
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,851
Numero tres!

106
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,566
Numero cuatro!

107
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,763
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!

108
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,730
Run! We are late!

109
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:29,603
Use your jab. Don't lower your guard.

110
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,761
Sir.

111
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,090
What's up, kid?

112
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,966
Would you train me?

113
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,327
Go to school. We are working here.

114
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,124
You gonna pay for school?

115
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,209
Just go, kid.

116
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,206
All good.

117
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,806
Shut up and box.

118
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,369
Boxing is fighting,
all you do is dance like my sisters.

119
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,568
Yeah!

120
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,160
Stand up you coward!

121
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,640
We are rich!

122
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,324
I didn't know you liked to fight!

123
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,920
You see? I'm gonna be world champ!

124
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,202
Then you gotta take me to NY.

125
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,641
Let's go eat!

126
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,050
Hide the money!

127
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,605
Give me that money, kid.

128
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,200
Give me the money.

129
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,685
I got no money.

130
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,810
He's just a kid!

131
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,367
- Wassup, kid?
- Wassup.

132
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,209
- All good?
- Yes.

133
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,371
Clearly, all is great.

134
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,164
I can get you out.

135
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,130
But let me be clear...

136
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,720
If you are caught fighting or stealing...

137
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,848
I'll bring you back myself
and leave you here.

138
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,204
So you are gonna train me?

139
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,969
They're not all gonna be this easy.

140
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,645
Sometimes...

141
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,366
You need to get points.

142
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,491
There's technique...

143
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,487
Rules.

144
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,409
Cheats.

145
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,481
Movement.

146
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,804
You learning everything I tell you?

147
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,251
I learn anything you want...

148
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,204
as long as you get me an ice cream...

149
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,527
every time I kill one of those fuckers.

150
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,801
Stand up you coward!

151
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,842
Hey.

152
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,611
Baby.

153
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,801
Turn around.

154
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,885
Hey, psst.

155
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,525
Blondie.

156
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,880
What's your name?

157
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,125
Did the mice eat your tongue?

158
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,890
You're not going to give me your name?

159
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,246
Huh?

160
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,850
You speak English?

161
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,121
You speak Spanish?

162
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,605
Happiness

163
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,209
You are kidding me, right?
Your name is happiness?

164
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,847
Let me guess. It's what you've
been looking for all your life?

165
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,449
The poor are born happy.

166
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,928
Only the rich know sadness.

167
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,806
And you still leave?

168
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,527
Come here!

169
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,688
Where are you taking me?

170
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,050
It's okay, I don't bite.

171
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,889
You are nuts.

172
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,690
Marry me!

173
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,040
I don't even know you!

174
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,047
Exactly!

175
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,686
We'll get the rest
of our lives to know each other.

176
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,325
You are really crazy.

177
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,805
Crazy for you.

178
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,165
I can't change who I am.

179
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,044
Then you need to forget about me.

180
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,810
You're going to leave me here?

181
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,244
You're the one who won't forget me!

182
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,970
You'll be drawing hearts in your notebook.

183
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,731
You are done, you turned...

184
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,248
And you fell in love.

185
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,529
You're crazy!

186
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,286
What's up? What's that spaceship?

187
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,169
Jeez. he's intense!

188
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,610
This is Carlos Eleta,
the richest man in Panama.

189
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,848
I've been looking for you for an hour!

190
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,923
Stop screaming in front of everyone.

191
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,844
I wanted to meet you.

192
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,486
I hear you are unbeatable.

193
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,927
When you fight clowns it's easy to win.

194
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,931
You wanna be world champ? I can help you.

195
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,082
Yes

196
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,326
You speak English?

197
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,925
He's looking.

198
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,367
Yes, I speak English.

199
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,528
Gonna take you to Madison Square Garden.

200
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,130
Let's go right away.

201
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,370
This is your plane?

202
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,447
- Vamos, vamos, vamos.
- Robert, Robert, Robert,

203
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,449
Robert, Robert, Robert.

204
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,369
Don't look, don't look.

205
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,648
In the early '50s, I wanted to
take boxing to every town in America,

206
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,726
but the New York City wiseguys
were not happy about that.

207
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,286
Boxing is a New York City sport,
and that it's gonna remain.

208
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,444
But this national television tour of yours
is taking the spotlight off of the Garden.

209
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,564
And that we can't afford.

210
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,648
Well, I...

211
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,240
I think it'll help you
in the long run... Frank.

212
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,409
If you can trust what I'm saying.

213
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,445
TV will turn boxing
into a nationwide pastime

214
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,800
and you'll have talent and fans

215
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,531
from every part of the country coming
to see championships at the Garden.

216
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,120
I don't give a shit about
every part of the country.

217
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,605
New York is the heart of the cow.

218
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,843
It's the prime meat. If any boxing fan wants
to see a fight in the flesh or in front

219
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,361
of your little dirty tube,
better understand

220
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,927
that all roads go through New York.

221
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,490
When they heard I survived,
we made a deal.

222
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,922
They would spare my life as long as I
never made another dollar from boxing.

223
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,968
It's a familiar smell.

224
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,367
Where were you?

225
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,925
What, what are you talking about?

226
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,166
Did you go there?

227
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,520
Where?

228
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,047
That's what I said... where?

229
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,724
Please, you make it sound like
I've been with some woman or something.

230
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,241
I would rather you were with some woman.

231
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,328
Don't always be a district attorney.

232
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,925
I was seeing an old friend.

233
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,007
You know, it's fine.

234
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,326
I'm blonde.

235
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,680
I look great in black.

236
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,768
I will be a very hot widow.

237
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,881
Is that what you want?

238
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,721
How many years do I have left?

239
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,640
Ray.

240
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,491
These people will kill you.

241
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,489
Yeah, well.

242
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,648
I might as well be dead already anyway.

243
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,001
Oh, what a lovely thing
to say to your wife.

244
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,600
I don't mean... you, honey. I mean...

245
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,248
we are what we do.

246
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,410
And if you just make money,
you become money.

247
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,609
This thing that everybody wants

248
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,326
that everybody craves, it's just symbolic.

249
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,766
It has no real value.

250
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,962
I have to do something
that I really care about.

251
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,526
I'm not an idiot.

252
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,085
I know you're miserable.

253
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,325
I get it, but those animals
run everything.

254
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,291
I'd rather live in fear.

255
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,242
Pick it up a little, pick it up.

256
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,045
You're gonna have to learn to breathe.

257
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,165
And you're gonna learn to pace yourself.

258
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,442
There's technique and there's strategy.

259
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,769
Technique is your every move,
your every punch

260
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,962
covers all your short-term decisions.

261
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,401
Strategy is your plan for the whole fight.

262
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,806
It's your long term.

263
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,682
It defines how you apply the technique
to achieve your major goal.

264
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,485
It's okay if your technique
fails for a beat

265
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,331
as long as you're following the strategy.

266
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,529
Buchanan knows you're gonna try
to knock him out in the first round.

267
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,529
And then he'll wait for you
to get tired and try

268
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,008
and catch you, and that's his strategy.

269
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,087
¿Comprende?

270
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,326
He expect...

271
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,363
but if you slow down

272
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,369
and go...

273
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,081
slow, slow, slow, slow,
slow, slow, slow...

274
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,408
Buchanan no comprende.

275
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,366
Get off the fence.

276
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,641
Excuse me?

277
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,647
Get off the fence.

278
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,091
Ah, shut up, schmuck.

279
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,526
Who do you think you are, old man?

280
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,085
I'm Ray Arcel from Harlem, USA.

281
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,281
You know where that is?

282
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,246
And this is the future world champion
you're talking to here.

283
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,091
Fuck off.

284
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,601
He's in a jail and he thinks
he's in charge.

285
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,848
- We in jail.
- No, he-he's in jail.

286
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,361
- They put jail here.
- No, no, he...

287
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,801
He's... It's all in the head.

288
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,730
Boxing is a mental sport, aquí.

289
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,525
What you do with your body
is one-third of the job.

290
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,246
You got to learn to be
the boss, which you are.

291
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,850
Say it, "He's in jail."

292
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,530
Say it. "He's in jail."

293
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,367
- He's in jail.
- He's in jail.

294
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,402
See? In jail.

295
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,726
I thought I told you to fuck off.

296
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,490
You in jail.

297
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,408
You don't know when to stop, do you?

298
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,329
You in jail.

299
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,283
- Okay, okay.
- You, you in jail.

300
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,880
Get the fuck out of here.

301
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,690
- Is that the way you want this to go?
- You in jail.

302
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,847
You are in jail.

303
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480
I'm champion. This is Panama.

304
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,726
Nice.

305
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,881
Hook after the right. Hook.

306
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,641
Double up. Jab. Jab.

307
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,723
That's it, that's it, there you go.

308
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,727
There you go.

309
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,448
That's it. That's it!

310
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,728
Nice, nice.

311
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,607
Ciao.

312
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,010
Hey, you are the boxer.

313
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,327
Yes.

314
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,851
And you are?

315
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,971
I heard you won.

316
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,563
Yeah, that was easy.

317
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,648
Now I'm going for the world championship.

318
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,807
That's good.

319
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,490
Can I walk with you?

320
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,807
What school did you go to?

321
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,400
I went to the Plomo Quiñones school.

322
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,290
Now I'm in the Ray Arcel.

323
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,323
Ray Arcel?

324
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,566
Uh-huh.

325
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,648
American school?

326
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,207
Yes, American school.

327
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,607
You didn't go to school, did you?

328
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,650
But you can read, right?

329
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,371
This is like a job interview.

330
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,767
I thought I was walking you home.

331
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,885
Yes.

332
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,128
I can continue alone.

333
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,924
Why?

334
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,527
We come from different worlds.

335
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,923
It's all in the head.

336
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,888
What?

337
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,246
It's all in the head.

338
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,568
Turn the right hand over,
turn the right hand over.

339
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,328
The first thing a future world champ
needs to be taught is to be lucky.

340
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,807
And luck is a woman
you must learn to seduce.

341
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,606
Be the host of the ring.

342
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,371
This is your temple,
and everyone does as you wish.

343
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,607
Be the master of time.

344
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,843
You and only you
should decide when to strike.

345
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,443
Come see.

346
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,328
This is the kitchen.

347
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,528
Aquí.

348
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,162
My heavy bag.

349
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,325
Some perfumes.

350
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,521
Come see.

351
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,130
I'm looking at it.

352
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,803
You don't like it?

353
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,806
I'm just used to...

354
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,086
Hey, Ray.

355
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,371
How you doing, huh?

356
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,041
No worries.

357
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,361
You look good.

358
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,289
How's the wife?

359
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,801
She's good, thanks.

360
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,931
20 years since your heroic mission
to expand boxing to the nation.

361
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,088
Boxing expanded. I wasn't wrong.

362
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,164
Yes and no. But yes, the sport
makes for fantastic television.

363
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,282
And now you're back.

364
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,641
Sort of.

365
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,125
I like you, Ray.

366
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,244
I feel really bad
for what they did to you.

367
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,566
I don't need to look a gift horse up
the ass to know there's shit in there.

368
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,806
I thought we had a deal.

369
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,445
We do.

370
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,201
Maybe I'm confused about
what kind of deal we're talking about.

371
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,046
You weren't meant to make money
from boxing again.

372
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,406
I'm training him for free.

373
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,522
You can check with Carlos Eleta.

374
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,051
He's the fighter's manager.

375
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,683
You're a classy guy, but you're not
going to teach me how to hide money.

376
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,564
Buchanan's favored 14 to three
against Durán, right?

377
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,806
That's right.

378
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,246
Except Durán's going to win.

379
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,442
Put all your money on Durán.

380
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,291
Make a bundle.

381
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,046
Leave me alone if he wins,
shoot me if he loses.

382
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,047
You're a classy guy.

383
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,404
Mr. Arcel, why come back from
retirement with an unproven fighter?

384
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,329
I just turned 73.

385
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,408
You know, seven decades and change.

386
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,446
And myself and Freddy Brown here
have probably forgotten more

387
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,324
than most trainers will ever learn.

388
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,283
But I remember well,
from the '20s to the '50s

389
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,607
we lived the golden age of boxing.

390
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,449
Then television took over

391
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,361
and we all became... ambitious.

392
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,004
The sport turned into a spectacle,
show business with blood.

393
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,325
And it was a good thing, because we reached
audiences nobody thought we could reach.

394
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,283
The problem, inevitably,
is that the fighters started doing it

395
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,371
for the fame, for greed,
for self-importance.

396
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,205
Independent promoters
faded away and, with them,

397
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,045
the true hungry fighters,
the lifeblood of this game.

398
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,164
Tonight, however, you'll meet
the best lightweight

399
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,049
New York has seen in 50 years.

400
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,124
A true, true hungry fighter.

401
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,366
Like in the old days.

402
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,086
He's got the soul, the rage, the mental
energy and determination the sport needs,

403
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,565
and that's why I'm here.

404
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,526
Because a new golden era for boxing
begins with Roberto Durán.

405
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,410
With 28 wins,
zero losses and 24 knockouts...

406
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,962
from the slums of El Chorrillo, Panama...

407
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,402
...Roberto Durán.

408
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,927
The lightweight champion
of the world, Ken Buchanan.

409
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,245
He's got a skirt?

410
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,764
He is wearing a skirt, Roberto!

411
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,370
A fuckin' skirt!

412
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,286
Take him to the movies.

413
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,686
Charm him. Let him open up.

414
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,962
Then go to work on him.

415
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,525
Remember what we worked on. Strategy.

416
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,445
Excuse me.

417
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,843
Are they fighting yet?

418
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,000
It's about to start.

419
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,011
Durán is certainly trying to improve
on his nine one-round knockouts here.

420
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,844
He's throwing everything.

421
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,005
Johnny scores it as a knockdown.

422
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,923
Find that body!

423
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,327
The challenger is a little over-anxious.

424
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,965
It was almost Buchanan
scoring the knockdown.

425
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,484
Kill him, cholo!

426
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,004
Durán may punch himself out.

427
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,326
Don't rush in. You got him.
Just keep on him.

428
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,801
Remember the strategy.
He wants you to get tired.

429
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,921
I don't care about the strategy.

430
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,121
- I'll kill him.
- Listen to me.

431
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,924
If you don't go in with a feint and a jab,

432
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,769
he's going to nail you
on the way in. He's tall.

433
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,609
He's-he's too tall for you.

434
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,609
Strategy. Stick with the strategy.

435
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,563
- Fuck off.
- No, don't tell me that.

436
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,125
Don't say those things to me.

437
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,810
Fuck off. Yeah, yeah, he's tall
and he's gonna nail me.

438
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,331
What, you work for him or what?

439
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,010
- Are you out of your mind?
- Yeah, he's taller than me...

440
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,565
What am I doing here? I don't need this.

441
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,727
Yeah, because he's gringo.

442
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,325
- Listen, you stupid little schmuck.
- Right?

443
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,601
You want me to leave here?

444
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,051
I can leave you in the corner by yourself.

445
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,730
Now behave yourself, act like a grown-up,

446
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,763
- and stop being a baby.
- I'm fucking with you.

447
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,120
- I'm nervous, okay?
- I know you are, I know you're nervous,

448
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,969
- but look at him.
- Don't make me worse, okay?

449
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,730
I'm... You're making yourself worse.

450
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,808
- Okay, relax now.
- You're mak... no, you relax.

451
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,127
You get out there and
you show me what you can do.

452
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,321
You pace yourself.

453
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,606
You be the boss.

454
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,124
Keep the pressure on him behind the jabs.

455
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,810
Start working on the body.

456
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,645
Keep the pressure on...
that's... keep the pressure on him.

457
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,362
What's going on?

458
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,927
Durán's going for that knockout.

459
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,042
That's a white bitch, Cholo!

460
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,242
Eso una perra blanca, Cholo!

461
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,766
Oh!

462
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,450
He really hurt him that time.

463
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,804
Buchanan's in trouble...

464
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,888
Make him shit his pants!

465
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,209
Buchanan's mouthpiece goes out!

466
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,844
Remember, Buchanan came
from a broken home.

467
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,563
Get him up against the ropes!

468
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,851
Cholo!

469
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,644
Johnny. Johnny.

470
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,000
That was a clean shot.

471
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,565
You gotta know that.

472
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,728
We're in New York City,
don't forget, don't forget.

473
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,728
- I didn't hit him in the, in the balls.
- No, no.

474
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,882
- I hit him in the gut.
- No, believe me, I know.

475
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,241
Durán! Durán!

476
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,645
He's good.

477
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,683
- He's good.
- I can hear you.

478
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,961
I can hear you, I'm okay.

479
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,491
- I'm okay.
- He's good.

480
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,644
Hey!

481
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,440
Durán, Durán, Durán, Durán, Durán!

482
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,971
Hey!

483
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,127
We love you, Panama!

484
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,322
Durán, Durán, Durán...

485
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,209
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh...

486
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,088
Hey, Ray! Cheers.

487
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,521
- I got a question for you.
- Yeah.

488
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,201
Why you always brushed my hair
when we were in the corners?

489
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,165
Fighter punches you, feels proud.

490
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,686
Bell sounds, next round starts,
you come out looking all fresh,

491
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,245
like you just came out of the shower.

492
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,203
Drives him nuts.
He thinks he can't hurt you.

493
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,651
All psychological.

494
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,206
Oh...

495
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,163
- Strategy.
- Strategy.

496
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,725
- Aha.
- Strategy.

497
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,365
Aha, you schmuck.

498
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,606
- Huh?
- Now you're speaking Yiddish.

499
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,006
- Yeah.
- Yes.

500
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,246
"Schmlendeck."

501
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,408
Schmendrick. Putz.

502
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,729
Yeah, son of a putz.

503
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,688
- Hey, watch my hair gel.
- No, no, I just...

504
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,040
I just...

505
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,127
Yeah.

506
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,082
Open my belly!

507
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,641
Don't open her belly!

508
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,966
Empuja.

509
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,644
How do we call him?

510
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,568
Roberto Duran.

511
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,887
It's a girl!

512
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,561
Another girl

513
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,121
Roberto Durán.

514
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,282
You can't name them all Roberto.

515
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,289
Let's name him Robin, then, like Robin Hood.

516
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,129
We fight the rich to give the poor.

517
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,004
Another boy and his name is Roberto Durán.

518
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,884
And I don't wanna hear it.

519
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,888
How are the girls? Did you eat?

520
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,922
Yes!

521
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,811
Get some sodas.

522
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,570
What's wrong?

523
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,364
Papi, we've given away 100 grand already.

524
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,845
What's the problem?

525
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,406
We got money. And it's good to give.

526
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,171
Look how happy everyone is.

527
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,086
Thanks for the food, Durán.

528
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,408
Jump! Jump!

529
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,684
We are here to participate in

530
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,090
the signing of treaties which will assure
a peaceful and prosperous...

531
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,246
...of the United States
to the belief that fairness

532
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,725
and not force

533
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,967
should lie at the heart of our dealings
with the nations of the world.

534
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,045
Dear Mr. President Carter.

535
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,448
In the name of the truth of logic,
I would like to say,

536
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,086
that we will sign this treaty.

537
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,888
He's signing the treaty!

538
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,688
The treaty is signed! The Canal is ours!

539
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,122
Blondie!

540
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,170
They're gonna give us the canal!

541
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,051
General Torrijos signed the treaty!

542
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,568
See to believe the word of a Yankee.

543
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,366
Come see what I got you.

544
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,131
But wait... this is important.

545
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,449
- Torrijos is good with the people.
- You wanna see the real Panama canal?

546
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,451
I've seen that tiny canal a million times.

547
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,928
You say that because
all you have is a sail boat.

548
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,728
A sail boat? I got the Titanic here.

549
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,649
Sink it then.

550
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,329
All Panama is celebrating in the streets
and you are not even happy?

551
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,960
Happy about what?

552
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,650
About what?

553
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,162
You've obviously never
been chased by a Marine.

554
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,685
Excuse me?

555
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,768
Rich girl.

556
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,722
Get off of me.

557
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,604
Now you gonna get mad?

558
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,087
Yes. You're talking shit.

559
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,565
Eh?

560
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,602
They offer to return
your own territory in 1999.

561
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,165
In twenty years!

562
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,164
For fuck's sake, it's ours!

563
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,089
And it has nothing to do
with being rich or poor.

564
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,282
It's common sense.

565
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,286
Now this is fucked.
I'm celebrating and you are pissed.

566
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,523
If you wanna make your people proud,

567
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,928
this is the guy to beat.

568
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,283
What does it say?

569
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,968
When are you gonna learn to read?

570
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,121
What does it say?

571
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,208
It says "Fighter of the year".

572
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,721
Fighter of the year? This clown?

573
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,969
He hasn't fought a man in his life.

574
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,367
He is the symbol of American sports.

575
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,130
My balls.

576
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,089
He's the symbol of American Sports.

577
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,048
If you want your Torrijos-Carter treaty...

578
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,845
to mean anything for this country...

579
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,009
before 1999...

580
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,644
destroy their idol
and make them respect Panama.

581
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,764
That idol goes down in one round.

582
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,566
Let me see it.

583
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,445
For you I got 15 rounds or more.

584
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,926
Wow.

585
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,166
He's lightning fast, this guy.

586
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,846
He's imitating Ali.

587
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,450
Punches like a girl.

588
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,050
Yeah, but he could run
away from you all night

589
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,202
and score dozens of points
with these punches.

590
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,446
He's jumping all over
the place. Look at him.

591
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,886
I mean, it's like, uh,
he's a different kind of animal.

592
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,201
You gotta work on your speed.

593
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,410
Man, if you love him so much,
why don't you go train him?

594
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,568
I don't love him, I respect him.

595
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,489
And you should do yourself
a favor and respect him, too.

596
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,489
- Look at him.
- No, but go, Ray,

597
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,965
go and massage the shoulders
you love so much.

598
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,923
- Oh, come on, stop it, come on.
- Huh? So now am I slow?

599
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,690
- I don't know, whatever, stop it.
- Now am I slow?

600
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,450
- No, go and massage his shoulders.
- I... you're...

601
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,648
- Go with your gringo, Ray.
- Oh...

602
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,644
Maybe you've been training him already.

603
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,285
I don't know where you go at night.

604
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,841
You, you've gotta be kidding me. Roberto!

605
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,962
- Huh? No?
- Come on, stop it. Shut up. Grow up.

606
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,445
Not everything revolves around you.

607
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,961
I have responsibilities.
Come on, look at this...

608
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,048
They must know that-that-that
I won't be able to beat...

609
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,326
to-to-to-to beat him.

610
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,771
I will beat him, you know?

611
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,370
I will beat him because I'm a good boxer.

612
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,720
- And you know what?
- Strategize right now and sit down.

613
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,330
I will make him fight like a man.

614
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,010
- Sit down so we can discuss everything.
- I'm done looking.

615
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,007
No go.

616
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,929
I will beat him. With my strategy.

617
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,168
If you leave,
I'm packing my bags. I'm going.

618
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,645
- Leave.
- You leave, I'll leave.

619
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,165
- Be my guest.
- Ah...

620
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,406
Goddamn schmendrick.

621
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,841
Goddamn you, fucking schmendrick.

622
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,089
And you tell your father, root for me, okay?

623
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,805
Too cute.

624
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,488
Isn't that Durán?

625
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,570
Uh... yeah.

626
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,728
You know he was here?

627
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,525
Manos de Piedra!

628
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,608
Look at the rich kid.

629
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,529
He's a real fighter?

630
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,085
- Or a clown?
- Hey.

631
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,841
Respect, Durán. He's with his wife.

632
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,490
What, this son of a bitch here?

633
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,648
- Or are you talking about the whore?
- Hey, hey.

634
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,000
Hey, hey, you show some respect, man.

635
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,406
You talking to me, you piece of shit?

636
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,851
You know what you are?

637
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,086
Take that machismo bullshit out of here.

638
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,850
All I see is a golden spoon child

639
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,086
who thinks he can fight a man.
You can fight a man?

640
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,406
- Hey, shut up.
- You can fight a man?

641
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,885
Let's get out of here, Ray.

642
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,887
- Come on.
- You're a pussy, man.

643
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,241
You're a clown. All you do
is dance and jump around.

644
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,964
Jump around and sell soda.

645
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,730
He's gonna whip your ass.

646
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,410
- You shut up, too, bitch.
- Oh, fuck you!

647
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,130
I'm gonna fuck your husband in the ring
and when I'm done with him, I'm gonna go

648
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,406
- and fuck you all night, baby.
- Oh, you...!

649
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,851
Gonna fuck them here, huh?

650
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,610
What is wrong with you?

651
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,720
You wash your mouth
before you talk to a woman!

652
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,524
Right now, right now, motherfucker.

653
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,728
I come all the way, all the way
from Panama to fight a man.

654
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,611
And all they give me is a pretty boy.
What the fuck?

655
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,926
And you see, and you see his,
um, his diet cola commercial?

656
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,361
And he calls himself "Sugar"

657
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,608
and he's selling you sugar-free shit.

658
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,891
Or-or maybe, maybe that's what
we're gonna have.

659
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,128
A sugar-free fight.

660
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,250
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah!

661
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,566
I'm sorry, okay?

662
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,205
Sorry's not good enough.

663
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,007
How could you do that?
Insult a woman like that?

664
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,086
What's the matter with you?

665
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,362
Well, my country felt insulted by yours.

666
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,050
And not only women.

667
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,766
Children.

668
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,481
What does your country have to do
with the way you talked to that woman?

669
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,085
The way you behaved?

670
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,727
You know how... you know how
it is to be hungry?

671
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,763
And I don't say, "hungry" hungry.

672
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,008
To be hungry that you have to go to...

673
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,610
to-to the garbage for food?

674
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,085
While the American army
is exploiting your country?

675
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,651
You know how it feels?

676
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,969
What does that have to do
with what you just did?

677
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,724
What are you... what are you doing?

678
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,968
- Well, it has to do...
- You know, you want to be,

679
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,884
you want to be, you want to be a warrior,

680
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,168
you want to avenge your people,
fine by me.

681
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,009
Avenge your people. Be a warrior.

682
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,010
But real warriors do not do what you did.

683
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,691
They don't mess with women
the way you just did.

684
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,922
And if you want me in your corner,
you cannot do that again.

685
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,763
Well, well, okay,
okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

686
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,406
But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry to him.

687
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,287
I say I'm sorry to you,
but I'm not gonna say I'm sorry to him.

688
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,084
Let's forget it.

689
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,685
What's done is done.

690
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,564
Are you mad?

691
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,842
And let's just...

692
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,564
focus on the fight.

693
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,248
This anger you feel, I understand that.

694
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,966
You don't want to become
a victim of your own mind game.

695
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,401
It's all in the head.

696
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,846
Robert.

697
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,689
Why are you here?

698
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,683
Huh?

699
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,485
If Ray finds out you are dead.

700
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,681
I can't sleep.

701
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,964
What's wrong?

702
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,321
I don't want to disappoint tomorrow.

703
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,885
Dad!

704
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,246
Hey!

705
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,206
My babies! Good morning!

706
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,403
Kisses for Daddy.

707
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,807
Can't wait to see you kill that coward!

708
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,251
Don't say that!

709
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,011
But Dad said it on TV.

710
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,964
It's my job to say those things.

711
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,082
So you're not gonna kill him?

712
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,885
Of course,
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

713
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,129
It's all a show.
He says that so the fight is more fun.

714
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,287
Come get dressed.

715
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,045
Durán has turned
into the audience favorite

716
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,486
after a menacing training process in town.

717
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,126
He has been so aggressive.

718
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,087
The referee tonight is Carlos
Padilla, who gloriously oversaw

719
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,682
the Thrilla in Manila
between Frazier and Ali.

720
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,171
You have to let them fight,
otherwise you're gonna see

721
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,406
two guys running all night.

722
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,568
To your corner. To your corner.

723
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,722
Biggest ring I ever saw.

724
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,764
Sugar Ray Leonard!

725
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,363
- The crowd is booing the champ...
- Booing?

726
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,443
...in what must be startling for Leonard,

727
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,005
who, in this very stadium surprised
the planet by winning Olympic gold.

728
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,485
It's a wonderful day.

729
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,881
That's okay, baby!

730
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,809
It's your night tonight!

731
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,005
You're dead meat, Durán!

732
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,087
- That's right.
- You're nothing.

733
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,690
Fuckin' Cholo!

734
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,767
Yeah.

735
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,924
Keep him close to your body.
Don't chase the lady.

736
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,280
Let her come to you. Don't let her run.

737
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,129
Rather lose than run.

738
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,446
Look at him.

739
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,688
...15 rounds of boxing...

740
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,684
Strategy.

741
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,051
Presented by the promoter...

742
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,361
This Canadian crowd has embraced
the underdog Roberto Durán.

743
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,130
Speculation has been rampant

744
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,811
over whether Leonard will turn
this into a street fight

745
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,202
or go back to the boxing
which brought him here.

746
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,607
Leonard and Durán!

747
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,968
Durán getting inside the jab of Leonard.

748
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,287
At him! Keep him on the ropes! At him!

749
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,802
Two fighters at the top of their game.

750
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,569
Jab! Jab! Jab!

751
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,250
Stay on him! Stay on him!

752
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,481
Get out of there, get out of there!

753
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,560
- Break it up.
- That's not Leonard.

754
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,286
Leonard is short punches, not wide ones.

755
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,162
Break it up.

756
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,891
The normally elusive Leonard
is staying flat-footed.

757
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,489
He wants to trade with Durán
and not back down.

758
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,329
He wants to prove he's a man.

759
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,169
Let him feel he's resisting.

760
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,851
Keep him hoping until he's
inspired and then kill him.

761
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,291
Look at me!

762
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,925
Who the fuck are you today? Huh?

763
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,891
This is honor I'm fighting for.

764
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,331
Fuck that shit!

765
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,049
Make him fight.

766
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,082
Go get him, champ!

767
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,247
Run him around!

768
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,286
Durán! Durán! Durán!

769
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,561
Durán! Durán!

770
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,289
Durán lands a left hook
to the neck that wobbles Leonard!

771
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,970
Ankles! Ankles!

772
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,926
Dale Chucha tu Madre!

773
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,610
This is not the Leonard
we're used to seeing.

774
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,284
Can you believe he's trying
to match macho with macho?

775
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,731
Durán pushes back.

776
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,524
Leonard has some room now.

777
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,971
Good right hand by Leonard.

778
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,811
Break. Open. Open.

779
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,201
The key to Leonard is his left jab.

780
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,448
But it's also working in tandem
with those legs.

781
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:45,569
Right now, seems like he's flat-footed,
just trying to tee off on Durán.

782
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,330
Go! Beat him!

783
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,165
Now, Sugar Ray is fighting
an inspired fight.

784
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,930
You gotta try to knock him out, Cholo.

785
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,246
You never know with these darn judges.

786
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,601
They can take the fight away from us.

787
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,848
This has been your best fight.

788
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,803
But you're still human.

789
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,285
You could still lose.

790
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,840
I want you to focus.

791
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,083
Are we gonna be champions?

792
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,450
Tu eres mi campeón.

793
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,571
Against the ropes.

794
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,888
Last round, champ!

795
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,331
Now or never!

796
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,407
Round 15!

797
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,363
Not many thought it would come to this.

798
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,970
The crowd is on their feet.

799
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,248
And at the battle here in Montreal.

800
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,728
- We are in the waning moments of this fight.
- Go, go!

801
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,047
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

802
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,891
I cannot believe what is taking place.

803
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,960
To the very end,
these two warriors going at it.

804
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,243
Like they don't know
that a bell is going to ring.

805
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,443
This is what we are here for.

806
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,125
We are witnessing history.

807
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,924
Cholo, knock him out!

808
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,804
Who wants it more?

809
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,001
Let's go, Cholo!

810
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,525
An amazing battle!

811
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,166
And we're in the 15th round.

812
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,043
This fight is gonna go all the way!

813
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,361
We are counting down.

814
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,209
Six, five, four, three...

815
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,687
And the bell is going to ring!

816
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,564
Here they are!

817
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,045
Look at these two warriors!

818
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,000
Behave, behave, behave!

819
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,565
- We could get penalized, behave.
- You shit!

820
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,963
We've seen this before,
when a fight is close.

821
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,686
The decision usually goes to the champion.

822
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,201
Who's the cunt now?
Who's the cunt now, motherfucker?

823
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,163
- Maricón!
- Fuck you!

824
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,487
You are my bitch!

825
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,410
Robbie!

826
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,961
You won, my love!

827
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,806
Three judges score the fight as follows:

828
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,763
Judge Angelo Poletti

829
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,727
calls the match 147 to 147.

830
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,644
It is a draw.

831
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,006
Be calm, my love.

832
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,770
Judge Harry Gibbs calls the match

833
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,644
- 145 to 144.
- You've proven yourself.

834
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,046
for Roberto Durán.

835
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,327
Attention. Attention.

836
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,602
Judge Raymond Baldeyrou

837
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,044
calls the match 146 to 144.

838
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,684
- The new welterweight...
- Yeah!

839
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,684
...champion of the world, Roberto Durán!

840
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,610
Hello.

841
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,370
I'm calling from the Coney Island Hospital

842
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,608
in regards to a patient
with a heroin overdose.

843
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,967
- Yes?
- Patient's records

844
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,163
indicate she's the daughter of Ray Arcel.

845
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,523
No, th-this is the wife of Ray Arcel,

846
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,166
and my husband does not have a daughter.

847
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,805
You must have the wrong number.

848
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,002
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Nope, no worries. Good night.

849
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,963
What happened?

850
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,162
Nothing. It was just a wrong number.

851
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,731
What'd they say?

852
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,764
They said there's another guy
named Ray Arcel

853
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,450
and his daughter is in the hospital.

854
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,130
What hospital? What-what happened?

855
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,530
I don't know, but I know I'm not gonna
be able to go back to sleep now.

856
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,244
What are you doing?

857
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,370
Aw, Jesus.

858
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,086
Thank you.

859
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,284
I understand
you're related to the patient.

860
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,370
Yes, I'm her father and, uh,

861
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,329
I'll, uh, be responsible
for anything that...

862
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,564
Why are you here?

863
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,725
All these years... you come now?

864
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,330
Why?

865
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,442
You have no fighters to-to nurture?

866
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,488
What are you doing here?

867
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,648
I don't want to be seen like this.

868
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,011
I'm not one of your fighters.

869
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,600
Hazel and I couldn't have kids.

870
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,326
And we... wanted to adopt.

871
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,251
We adopted Adele and when Adele
was four, Hazel passed away.

872
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,607
I didn't know what to do. I had no money.

873
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,042
I couldn't take care of her. I...

874
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,970
I-I thought she'd be better off
with my in-laws. I...

875
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,043
I was, uh...

876
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,561
- I know I should have told you, I was...
- Told me?

877
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,126
What about her?

878
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,806
What about the girl hanging on to
her life by a thread in a hospital bed?

879
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,089
Sure. Leonard.

880
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,850
You are my friend now.

881
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,243
Baby, I want to show...
I want to show you something.

882
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,566
Yeah?

883
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,170
What do you want to show me?

884
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,362
- Uh...
- Want to go in there?

885
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,050
Yeah, we will.

886
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,130
But I-I want to show you
something before we do, okay?

887
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,765
Just... just let me...

888
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,126
let me...

889
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,289
...have respect for Sugar Ray Leonard?

890
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,767
Sure.

891
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,724
Sure. Leonard.

892
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,081
You are my friend now.

893
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,085
Look at this.

894
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,964
Leonard.

895
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,128
You are my friend now.

896
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,410
All along, he's been
doing this on purpose.

897
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,648
He hurt you to drive me crazy.

898
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,286
To get me to be

899
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,528
in his macho tough guy war.

900
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,085
Ray, you're obsessed.

901
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,804
I'm telling you, it's a strategy.

902
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,200
It's been a strategy...

903
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,004
I'm gonna fuck your husband in the ring

904
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,970
and when I'm done with him,
I'm gonna go and fuck you all night, baby.

905
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:37,082
From the moment he insulted you,
he knew that he could get in my head

906
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,046
and cause me to stand toe-to-toe with him.

907
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,446
I've never lost.

908
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,251
I don't lose.

909
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,440
Angelo.

910
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,722
Talk to Don King.

911
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,208
Durán should fight no one but me.

912
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,567
Set the rematch immediately.

913
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,001
Tell you what I'm gonna do, Carlos.

914
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,650
I'm gonna add a two to that eight
and bring it up to ten.

915
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,569
$10 million, Carlos.

916
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,047
You're gonna have the highest
paid fighter in history.

917
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,401
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, boy.

918
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,330
I know you like the sound of that, Carlos.

919
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,010
I know you like the sound of that.

920
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,166
Eva.

921
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,884
Hey, Cholo.

922
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,126
Cholo.

923
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,446
I'm exhausted.

924
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,163
Hey.

925
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,322
I've been calling you for a week.

926
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,920
What's up, Eleta?

927
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,442
- I have great news, Cholo.
- ¿Que pasó?

928
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,164
They want a rematch.

929
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,645
Who?

930
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,001
What do you mean who? Leonard!

931
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,010
Leonard? What is he a masochist?

932
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,407
I got you the most money ever

933
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,090
- for a welterweight.
- How much? How much?

934
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,202
$8 million.

935
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,046
Hey, Boba.

936
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,242
$8 million for a rematch with me.

937
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:02,849
He must be desperate.

938
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,611
No, the... no, the man needs the money.

939
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,321
- Cholo. Cholo.
- What?

940
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,606
Look at me.

941
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,083
Pay attention.

942
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,690
Okay, okay.

943
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,529
I have to respond to these people tonight.

944
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,328
In front of witnesses, do you accept
a rematch with-with Leonard?

945
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,688
I'd fight him, but I'm not
gonna fucking marry a guy.

946
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,564
You're drinking. You're getting fat.

947
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,331
You come to my house and you call me fat?

948
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,726
You have mirrors in your house?

949
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,444
You're the one who's getting fat.

950
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,251
You're getting fat from all
the food that you're eating

951
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,442
because of the money
that I'm making for you.

952
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,210
So what the fuck?

953
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,243
Parasite.

954
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,970
That's what you are,
you're a fucking parasite.

955
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,970
You call me fat, I call you parasite.

956
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,445
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, Eleta.

957
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,571
Now you are mad?

958
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,964
Hey!

959
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,289
What the hell are you doing?

960
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,448
Can't you see you got us all wet?

961
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,642
You are a fuckin' parasite too!

962
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,731
I'm telling you to get out you idiot!

963
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,490
Rob, what are you doing?

964
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,489
He got me soaked.

965
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,204
Get out I said!

966
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,403
This is my fuckin' house, you moron.

967
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,889
Get out or I'll get in and break you.

968
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,650
It's Chaflan, Rob!

969
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:29,846
Stop it, it's Chaflan.

970
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,044
Chivo, where's the Cholo?

971
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,611
Cholo!

972
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,608
That's the man, talk to him.

973
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,331
How are you?

974
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,966
I saw you on TV.

975
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,926
I was in town and, uh...

976
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,601
said to myself, "Why not?"

977
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,364
Hey, listen. Uh...

978
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,882
I'm not proud of what I did.

979
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,241
But look:

980
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,966
you're the world champ.

981
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,526
She was 14.

982
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,449
No money.

983
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,925
Your son.

984
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,730
I was in the army.

985
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,805
And, uh, when they say you gotta leave,

986
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,490
there's no ifs or buts.

987
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,806
What do you want?

988
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,370
Nothing.

989
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,165
Just, uh, just thought I'd say hi.

990
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,805
Hi.

991
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,646
I thought you were American.

992
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,889
I am American.

993
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,330
You look Mexican to me.

994
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,205
Well, Mexican heritage.

995
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,800
You thought I was, uh, blond,

996
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,331
- blue eyes, eh?
- Yes.

997
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,169
I can't take back what I did.

998
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,324
All I can say is, uh,

999
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,885
I'm sorry.

1000
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,286
And I'm...

1001
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,562
I'm proud that you're my son.

1002
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:08,241
Ladies and gentlemen,
I bring you this show from Las Vegas.

1003
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:14,208
Don't miss this international show
for all Panamanians.

1004
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,130
Let's play a game.
Everyone look at the ball...

1005
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,407
Hold it right there!

1006
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,409
I'm hungry, man.

1007
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,760
Catch him!

1008
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,169
A bit salty...

1009
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,248
but thank you.

1010
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,008
Revolting!

1011
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,646
Fuck you!

1012
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,327
While you were at your party...

1013
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,728
What?

1014
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,849
Chaflan was killed.

1015
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,767
Who told you?

1016
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,727
You can't discipline him by
forcing him to do something.

1017
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,645
You have to let him live
his life in a certain way.

1018
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,921
Stunned!

1019
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,280
I was stunned!

1020
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,205
And he will be stunned
when he hears what you did.

1021
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,970
And I have to explain it to him.

1022
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,605
Yeah, explain to him
that I got him $8 million,

1023
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,449
- which is the most money...
- He doesn't care.

1024
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,523
- ...that anyone has ever made.
- But he doesn't even know that.

1025
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,290
He doesn't know that even for himself.

1026
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,046
That the money is
the least important thing.

1027
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,891
He's a professional fighter.
He can lose that weight.

1028
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,490
Three months to lose almost 40 pounds.

1029
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,761
You know what that does to a fighter?

1030
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,291
I want what's best for him.

1031
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,682
- I want us to do what is best for him.
- That's not best for him.

1032
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,087
That's best for you but not for him.

1033
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,167
Well, that's your opinion.

1034
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,725
Let me tell you this...

1035
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,205
That's not my opinion. That's a fact.

1036
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,084
If he doesn't take this fight,
you know what's

1037
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,964
going to end up happening? He's
going to go fight some nobody.

1038
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,844
He's going to lose and he
will never, in a million years,

1039
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,008
get close to making the money
he's making right now.

1040
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,169
He's Durán. He can't lose.

1041
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,363
He's Durán. When he is focused,
he doesn't lose to a nobody.

1042
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,641
You know that.

1043
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,046
He won.

1044
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,764
Let him enjoy it. Let him party.

1045
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,006
So what if he's partying?

1046
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,406
So what if he's eating?

1047
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,885
Let him eat. Let him have a good time.

1048
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,764
He never had anything.
He never ate anything.

1049
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,882
And now he's finally earned something.

1050
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,490
He's earned it himself.

1051
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,967
Nobody gave it to him.
And you just take it away.

1052
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,242
I've been dealing with that
animal for the last ten years.

1053
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,249
He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a good kid...

1054
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,885
He needs to be disciplined!

1055
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,361
He will be disciplined! That's my job.

1056
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,371
If he loses, then we can sign
another rematch and...

1057
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,721
You're a sick paskudnyak
wanting your fighter to lose.

1058
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,291
No, what I said was, "if"...

1059
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,526
- Carlos, you have the money.
- Ray.

1060
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,971
- Family has the money.
- Ray.

1061
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,570
He didn't have it. He doesn't care.

1062
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,290
The most important thing
for him is to win.

1063
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,482
The most important thing for me is to win.

1064
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,608
To have the respect of winning.

1065
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,881
Right. What I said was,
if he loses, he can have a rematch...

1066
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,570
I'm done.

1067
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,681
I met my father.

1068
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,882
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

1069
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,804
What was he like?

1070
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,002
He's Mexican.

1071
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,485
I thought you said he was American.

1072
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,726
Um, he's American.

1073
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,370
I mean, he was born in America.

1074
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,370
And I thought that he would
look like Paul Newman.

1075
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,562
But he looks more like Pancho Villa.

1076
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,563
Think you look like Paul Newman?

1077
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,291
No, but Charles Bronson, maybe.

1078
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,924
There's someone else you're going
to have to learn to forgive.

1079
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,849
Carlos.

1080
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,406
Why?

1081
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,010
He agreed to the rematch.

1082
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,645
For when?

1083
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,001
- Three months from now.
- Well, that's impossible.

1084
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,600
We have to make it possible.
He already signed.

1085
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,131
He can't sign without my permission.

1086
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,730
He said you gave him your permission.

1087
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,888
At your house, at a party.

1088
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,565
In front of a lot of people.

1089
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,886
Witnesses, he said.

1090
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,484
Hi!

1091
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,886
Hi. They're insured.

1092
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,810
So you can destroy them if you want.

1093
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,366
No matter what,
you're going to do the fight.

1094
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,881
- You want me to call the police?
- Yeah, call the police!

1095
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,048
They put me in jail and you
lose... you lose your fucking

1096
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,003
$8 million!

1097
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,122
Well, now, Cholo,
now you understand it's a business.

1098
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,686
- I'm not a hooker!
- A hooker is cheaper

1099
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,689
and it doesn't create this much problems.

1100
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,131
You should be training right now.

1101
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:22,044
I've been training all my fucking life!

1102
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,282
Go home, Roberto.

1103
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,563
If you lose the fight,
we can have a rematch.

1104
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,365
I don't lose!

1105
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,608
In Panama, a nationalist demonstration...

1106
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,121
We got 75 days to lose 35 pounds.

1107
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,844
You've got to keep working, Cholo.

1108
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,406
I don't want to do this,
man, I want to rest.

1109
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,487
- You want to rest?
- I'm tired, man.

1110
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,886
- You want to rest?
- Yes.

1111
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,128
To rest is to rust. And you know that.

1112
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,526
You're the kind of fighter
that's gotta stay on your toes

1113
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,166
and if you don't stay on your toes,
then you're gone, that's it.

1114
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,725
And you can do this.

1115
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,729
But you're going to have
to decide to do this.

1116
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,251
Nobody can do it for you.

1117
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,885
There's no such thing as a reluctant hero.

1118
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,240
You're going to have to do it on your own.

1119
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,767
I work all my life, man.

1120
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,370
I work all my life.

1121
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,050
I didn't have any food when I was a kid.

1122
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,209
I'm hungry, man, I'm hungry.

1123
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,049
I don't want to be hungry anymore.

1124
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,248
I want to enjoy what I have, Ray.

1125
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,647
The rioting that followed was unexpected.

1126
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,609
The Zone police used tear gas and fire
hoses to drive off the demonstrators.

1127
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,290
I understand that.

1128
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,405
I can try to convince Don King
to delay the fight.

1129
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,126
But we got to be ready to fight
in case you have to.

1130
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,924
Okay.

1131
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,245
You still mad?

1132
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,362
Don't know what to tell you.

1133
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,361
Forgive me?

1134
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,130
Okay.

1135
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,370
I need you.

1136
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,525
I don't want to fight.

1137
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,847
Focus on your training.

1138
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,281
Why don't you come with the kids?

1139
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,805
I wanna see you.

1140
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,482
You need to rest, Robert. Go to sleep.

1141
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,965
Love you.

1142
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,284
I love you.

1143
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,088
Me too.

1144
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,806
Do you realize I'm black?

1145
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,691
Do you realize that I am
the only black promoter

1146
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,689
in the business and that if you pull out,

1147
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,280
- they will fry me?
- We're not pulling out.

1148
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,805
He can't make the weight.

1149
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,729
It's impossible for him
to make the weight.

1150
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,366
We got CBS. We got the stadium.

1151
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,767
We got the sponsors. We got the tickets.

1152
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,405
You can't go to them and ask them?

1153
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,170
Yeah, I can go to them and ask them.

1154
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,363
I'll say, "Excuse me, Mr. CBS,
I need another month."

1155
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,484
They'll say, "Black nigger, no."

1156
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,931
That's what's going to happen.

1157
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:44,045
Your boy either has to make his weight
or he will be disqualified, period.

1158
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,844
Yeah, but you're making it about yourself.

1159
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,371
You're making it about Bob Arum.

1160
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,606
You're saying that "I'm gonna look bad.

1161
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,330
I'm the only black promoter."

1162
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,522
With all due respect,
that doesn't mean anything.

1163
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,523
You have a responsibility to boxing.

1164
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,051
Boxing?

1165
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,004
Boxing has been run
by gangsters and criminals

1166
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,566
and scoundrels since the day it was born.

1167
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,365
Come on, now. Don't you put this on me.

1168
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,130
- Don't you dare put this on me.
- It's a sloppy production

1169
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,329
to start so soon when he's not ready.

1170
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,082
I happen to think that Roberto Durán,
the man with the hands of stone,

1171
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,328
if you challenge him, he will be ready.

1172
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,001
He has got the spirit
of Panama in his heart.

1173
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,406
You don't have to tell me what he has.

1174
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,646
I know him better than anybody here.

1175
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,921
All right, I'm sorry.

1176
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,565
If we continue down this road, Ray,

1177
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,967
I'm gonna have to sue you
for breach of contract.

1178
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,004
This is some mess you got us into.

1179
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,248
Oh. Gosh, Ray, you scared me.

1180
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,526
What are you doing here?

1181
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,846
How did you even get in?

1182
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,761
Hey. What...

1183
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,211
Hey...

1184
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,051
Ray, we can't do this.

1185
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,243
Babe, baby, okay, come on.

1186
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,203
Ray, look, it's against the rules.

1187
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,446
The fight's just around the corner.

1188
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,686
Come on, come on, babe.

1189
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,086
No, no, no, no, no.

1190
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,884
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1191
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,002
It's my rules this time.

1192
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,326
Okay?

1193
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,003
You want to beat Durán,

1194
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,248
you're going to have to humiliate him.

1195
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,849
You're going to have to shame him,
right there, in front of everyone.

1196
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,851
It's not going to work.

1197
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,883
Sorry.

1198
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,048
Sorry, you have to defend the title.

1199
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,686
Or what they'll do is
they'll just take it away.

1200
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,201
- What?
- They will take away the belt.

1201
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,685
But I won the fight.

1202
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,689
Everybody saw it.

1203
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,609
They can just take away my belt?

1204
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,041
They-they... that's what they can do.

1205
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,642
They will take it away
if you don't defend it.

1206
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,923
Roberto Durán had brought us
a new golden era for boxing.

1207
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,850
Yet here we were, reminding him
that he didn't matter.

1208
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,088
That decisions were made in the back room

1209
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,806
and he was only a circus animal
we needed for ticket sales.

1210
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,046
Approved.

1211
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,529
You're going to see blood in this fight.

1212
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,529
I don't like clowns.

1213
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:56,682
When you come into the ring,
you come to fight, not to dance or to clown.

1214
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,450
He's imitating Ali all the time,
that's what he does.

1215
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,686
He doesn't have any style.

1216
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,924
I'm going to knock you out,
'cause imitators are losers.

1217
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,605
And I don't like you.

1218
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,284
Well, I think Durán is a lovable guy.

1219
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,368
And I want my son to be just like him.

1220
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,129
Listen.

1221
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,605
I think Durán is a tough,

1222
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,481
impressive, intelligent fighter.

1223
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,406
And we are in for a serious fight.

1224
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:41,967
You're gonna feel bad.

1225
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,406
Stop it.

1226
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,488
- Hand me that.
- You can't eat like this.

1227
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,284
Pass me that yellow thing.

1228
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,966
Why didn't I get wings when I asked?

1229
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,002
You have plenty.

1230
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,010
And why were you looking at Leonard?

1231
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,281
Don't start with that.

1232
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,845
You think I didn't see you?

1233
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,247
Don't fool me.

1234
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,761
- You think I'm stupid?
- Insane is what you are.

1235
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,929
I saw him winking at you.

1236
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,168
And you were all smiles.

1237
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,561
The former champion of the world,

1238
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,490
Sugar Ray Leonard!

1239
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,843
...will be the rematch of the century.

1240
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:30,285
Here comes Leonard with his
entourage led by Angelo Dundee.

1241
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:35,004
And here he is, the challenger
tonight, Sugar Ray Leonard.

1242
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,043
Looks very composed.

1243
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,889
He looks very relaxed.

1244
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,411
...world!

1245
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,763
Roberto...

1246
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,848
Durán!

1247
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,167
The man with the hands of stone,

1248
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,170
from Panama, has to be regarded

1249
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,966
as one of the greatest
fighters of all time.

1250
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,080
And now Ray Charles, in honor of whom

1251
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:03,165
Sugar Ray Charles Leonard was baptized,

1252
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,523
will sing "America the Beautiful."

1253
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:11,685
O beautiful

1254
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:16,727
For purple mountain...

1255
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,202
America

1256
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,689
Sweet America

1257
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,804
He done shed His grace

1258
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,410
And you oughta love Him for it

1259
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:32,450
'Cause He...

1260
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,050
From sea to...

1261
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,686
Get out there and swim!

1262
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:44,207
Shining sea...

1263
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,561
Thank you, Ray.

1264
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,170
Kick his ass, son.

1265
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,248
- Oh, I will.
- Do it for me.

1266
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,404
The action begins.

1267
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,727
Leonard fighting for pride tonight,

1268
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,327
while Durán defends his place
in immortality.

1269
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,208
Durán! Durán! Durán!

1270
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,368
Durán! Durán!

1271
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,845
There's Leonard.

1272
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,167
That's what he wants to do in this fight.

1273
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,404
He says he did not work his jab
efficiently in the first fight.

1274
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,646
Stop following him!

1275
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,886
Go after him!

1276
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,446
Get him! Get him! After him!

1277
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,085
We have 20 seconds left in the round.

1278
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,446
Suffocate him.

1279
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,608
Up against the ropes! No mercy!

1280
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,131
Up against the ropes!

1281
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,208
Cut him off. Get him up against the ropes.

1282
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,606
Against the ropes!

1283
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,121
This is a much more confident Leonard

1284
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:36,323
we are seeing here tonight.

1285
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,763
You gotta be the host.
You're acting like a guest.

1286
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:44,967
You gotta pressure him,
you gotta put him on the ropes.

1287
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,445
You gotta bang to the body.

1288
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,722
It's your house.
Nobody else's. It's your house.

1289
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,251
- You understand that, Cholo?
- I don't feel good.

1290
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,691
You're letting this guy run all over you.

1291
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,687
He's running in circles around you.

1292
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,361
- You know that he does, that's his defense.
- I don't feel good.

1293
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,487
You don't feel good? You ate too much.

1294
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,648
Focus. Don't let this guy run on you.

1295
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,650
Don't let him run, don't let him run on you.

1296
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,650
- Durán is falling more and more, on his part...
- Keep him there, keep him there!

1297
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,524
...into the pattern of the first fight.

1298
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,247
- Durán got in a good shot.
- Yeah!

1299
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,442
- This is what Durán can do.
- That's it, that's it, Cholo.

1300
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,451
Hey!

1301
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,121
Durán is struggling to contain Leonard.

1302
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,642
You can see his anger and frustration.

1303
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,006
Cut him off!

1304
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,404
Leonard is a moving target.

1305
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,682
- And Durán is going...
- You get him!

1306
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,209
Get control of yourself.
Look at me! Look at me!

1307
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,287
- Box, motherfucker!
- Listen.

1308
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,004
- You gotta box him.
- Don't.

1309
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,326
- You're letting him do that.
- I'm very fucking pissed.

1310
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:44,169
Durán cannot get him up against
the ropes like he did in the first fight.

1311
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,481
Have you seen the size of the ring?

1312
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,487
They built the ring on purpose
so he can escape from me.

1313
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,486
The sneer is off his face.

1314
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,284
Yes! Yes, Ray!

1315
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,528
No, no, I'm a boxer.
I'm not a fucking ballerina...

1316
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,483
I don't come here to dance with a man.

1317
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,610
And he's got Durán. Openly.

1318
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,166
Not just furious but puzzled.

1319
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,760
Durán troubled by the movement.

1320
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:17,080
Dundee would be well advised,
I think, to tell Leonard to stop that.

1321
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,282
Leonard flaunting his skills.

1322
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,206
- And it is a vastly different human being...
- Stop following him around!

1323
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,283
...that Durán is tonight.

1324
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,684
That's right, baby!

1325
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,484
Yeah!

1326
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,841
Work on the body and then up to the head.

1327
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,166
- Everybody is laughing at me.
- No.

1328
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:36,647
Get out of your head.

1329
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,682
- I'm not a fucking clown in the, on the ring.
- Get, get out of your...

1330
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,571
And he caught him with the left!

1331
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,841
Yes.

1332
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,363
Calm down.

1333
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:54,527
- You're let...
- I'm chasing the motherfucker.

1334
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:55,966
You're let... L-Look at me.

1335
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,320
You don't need to do that, all right?

1336
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,322
You're about to be welterweight
champion of the world.

1337
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,527
Get out of your head!

1338
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,766
You're not doing what you should be doing.

1339
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,882
You know how to do it, get out there.

1340
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,922
I want to be proud of you. I want you
to get out there and I want you to...

1341
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,883
Look at me! You're Roberto Durán.

1342
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,286
Get in there and act like him.

1343
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,089
Go to the body! Cut him off!

1344
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,280
Hey.

1345
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,241
Cholo, what are you doing?

1346
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,886
What are you doing?

1347
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,728
He... he quit!

1348
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,447
Durán quit! He said, "no más."

1349
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,688
No, no, no, no, no, no. Cholo.

1350
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,768
Roberto Durán has quit.

1351
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,806
What are you doing?
You're going... you can't.

1352
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,126
The heck are you doing?

1353
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,049
- You got to fight him.
- No. Fuck him.

1354
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,004
- You've gotta fight him!
- No, no, he's a loser...

1355
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,849
You can't. You've got to...

1356
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,371
- Are you... What are you doing, Cholo?
- I'm not going to fight.

1357
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:36,051
I didn't come here to fight a clown.

1358
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,804
- You gotta go fight.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1359
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,081
They fuck me over.

1360
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,326
- I've had enough.
- No, no!

1361
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,851
I'm not a clown.

1362
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,365
Listen, you have to go in there and fight.

1363
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,970
You can't do this.

1364
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,570
- Why are you doing this?
- It's fucking bullshit.

1365
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,330
Roberto. Roberto, what happened?

1366
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,283
I'm retiring from boxing.

1367
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,006
He, he said he's retiring from boxing.

1368
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,287
Suddenly, inexplicably,

1369
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,562
the fight has ended.

1370
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,048
Don't do it, Robbie!

1371
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,650
Fight!

1372
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,205
You have to fight!

1373
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,247
Bullshit.

1374
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,600
This is for America.

1375
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,362
We did it! We did it!

1376
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,448
Go.

1377
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,209
I don't care how much ability
you've got as a fighter.

1378
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,644
If you can't think, you're
just another bum in the park.

1379
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,967
Boxing is brain over brawn.

1380
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,323
Thousands of people in the Super Dome

1381
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,450
and millions more in the closed
circuit theaters across the country

1382
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,725
have been cheated out of a fight
that they paid to see.

1383
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:54,650
The commission and the public
deserve an explanation.

1384
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,365
When a fighter loses a fight in the ring,
it oftentimes is the fighter's fault.

1385
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,847
But when a fighter
loses a fight in his head,

1386
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,008
it always is the trainer's fault.

1387
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,201
The cameras. The flashes.

1388
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,243
The microphones.

1389
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:13,331
The... hero worshipers.

1390
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,922
Television can make anyone
think of himself as a god.

1391
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,281
And I...

1392
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,801
I probably failed at, uh,

1393
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,287
keeping my fighter grounded.

1394
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,081
But I can tell you this:

1395
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,771
Roberto Durán is no coward.

1396
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,526
He did not leave the ring
out of fear of an opponent.

1397
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:39,166
He left it out of pride.

1398
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,851
There is talk of suspending Durán.

1399
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,325
What would you say about that?

1400
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,044
I-I don't know what happened.

1401
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,764
And if I don't, then you don't.

1402
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,370
But what I do know is

1403
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,729
how Roberto Durán began in life.

1404
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,447
I know what he willed himself to become.

1405
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,767
I know the honor
he has brought this business,

1406
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,769
which sometimes doesn't deserve it.

1407
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,290
And I know you cannot suspend him.

1408
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,925
He deserves better.

1409
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,809
And if you don't understand that
and you do this to him,

1410
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,969
you will wake up tomorrow
and you will feel ashamed.

1411
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,805
Faster, faster!

1412
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,089
Get in there kids!

1413
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,891
What's wrong with you?

1414
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,721
Fuck you all!

1415
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,440
We have no more right or reason

1416
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,969
for giving away the Panama Canal Zone
than we would to now give away Alaska.

1417
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:12,050
And I think that our
foreign policy should be one

1418
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:15,530
and we, the people who own the Canal,
should say to our government,

1419
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:19,247
look, tell Mr. Torrijos
that we built that thing.

1420
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,243
We bought the place. We paid for it.

1421
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,131
And we intend to keep it from here on out.

1422
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,411
Come up here.

1423
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,840
Get up.

1424
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:47,847
Come.

1425
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,768
Let's get out of here.

1426
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,450
This is not life.

1427
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,881
It's real life.

1428
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,324
Your husband got fucked.

1429
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,961
And everyone calls him a loser.

1430
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,286
Show them wrong.

1431
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,811
Why?

1432
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,888
For money?

1433
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,162
For the glory of Panama?

1434
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,407
To hell with this nation of hypocrites.

1435
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:21,726
Huh?

1436
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:28,043
If life is such shit, why don't we stop it
like you stopped the fight?

1437
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,931
No! No!

1438
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,649
Cholo! No! No!

1439
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,682
I'm done.

1440
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,924
Go find another woman.

1441
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:48,520
I can have thousands of women.

1442
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:49,971
I'm taking the kids.

1443
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,445
Go to hell, but the kids stay here.

1444
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,961
I'm leaving with my kids!

1445
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,363
The kids are mine.

1446
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,321
What?

1447
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,046
Speak for God's sake!

1448
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,400
President Torrijos was killed.

1449
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,451
Cholo!

1450
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,244
Get in the ring and I'll kill you.

1451
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,004
Come have lunch with us, kid.

1452
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,049
I don't need your food.

1453
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,361
I earn my meals fighting.

1454
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,528
You'll soon be begging for my autograph.

1455
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,126
Well said, champ.

1456
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,162
Who says well said?

1457
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,363
You are not from El Chorrillo anymore.
"No Mas: sshit from you.

1458
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,688
I'll send you to the morgue
and make you quit again!

1459
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,848
Ungrateful kid.

1460
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,724
It's never enough!

1461
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,287
Without Torrijos' leadership
this country will go to shit.

1462
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,683
Let's go home, Robert.

1463
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:54,686
They are right.

1464
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,801
The hope of El Chorrillo walked away.

1465
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,082
I walked away from the fight.

1466
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,082
I walked away just like my father.

1467
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,969
Yeah!

1468
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,890
I let them down.

1469
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,607
I let them down and I let you down.

1470
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:44,607
I don't need to be the champion,
but I need to fight.

1471
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,571
I'm going to fight.

1472
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,081
I need you to train me, Dad.
Please don't say no.

1473
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,771
I'm sorry. I'm retired.

1474
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,086
I can't.

1475
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,565
You're my father, man.

1476
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,603
You're the only one I have.

1477
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,609
Listen. I-I can't.

1478
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,449
I-I'm done with it.

1479
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,289
And it has nothing to do with you.

1480
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,323
We're talking about me now.
I'm old. I'm tired.

1481
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:21,851
You don't need me.

1482
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,530
You never really did.

1483
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,530
You're a naturally great fighter.

1484
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,291
You have great fighter's instincts.

1485
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,640
I was just there to support you.

1486
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,091
That's not true.

1487
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,645
I need you in my corner, Ray.

1488
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,444
Not anymore, you don't.
You're an adult now.

1489
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,050
You have children of your own.

1490
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:38,730
You don't need a father.

1491
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,127
You need somebody to bring
the street back into you.

1492
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,651
- Talk to Plomo.
- Plomo?

1493
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,125
He knows you better than anybody.

1494
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,810
He's been with you from the beginning.

1495
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,604
I'll help you get a fight.

1496
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,290
I'll be watching you all the time.

1497
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,851
But get Plomo to bring you back.

1498
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,769
That's who you need.

1499
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,089
- Okay.
- And please, always remember.

1500
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,282
The American you're talking to now?

1501
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,721
He gave you the best years of his life.

1502
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,527
Schmuck.

1503
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,928
You have no reason to feel guilty here.

1504
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,042
Well, he's my fighter, so...

1505
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,969
Yeah, well...

1506
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:25,482
You need to do what you think
is best for everyone.

1507
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,926
What do you think is best?

1508
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,168
It depends.

1509
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,484
You think that he's the one
that needs you the most right now?

1510
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:55,448
To prepare him for his comeback,
the first thing Plomo did was take Durán

1511
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,403
to the spiritual heart of Panama...

1512
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:16,045
...the procession of
the Black Christ of Portobelo.

1513
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,680
Plomo had promised Durán when he was a kid

1514
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:44,367
that if he went off track,
he'd take him back to jail.

1515
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,720
So he did.

1516
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,961
I made a lot of money on that fight.

1517
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,321
Whatever you need,
the answer's already yes.

1518
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,442
- Roberto Durán.
- Fuck no.

1519
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,842
He's bad news, Ray.

1520
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,764
You can do better than that bum.

1521
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,286
He needs a comeback.

1522
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,050
He quit.

1523
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,844
Understand? You can't do that.

1524
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,803
Unless we tell you to.

1525
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,006
No más.

1526
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,168
No más, my ass.

1527
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,964
Nobody's gonna pay to see that spick.

1528
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:40,927
How about Davey Moore?

1529
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,246
Davey Moore?

1530
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,731
I mean, he's a 24-year-old monster.

1531
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,171
You'll get Durán killed.

1532
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,926
Isn't that what everybody wants to see

1533
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:50,202
- after what he did in New Orleans?
- Maybe.

1534
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,926
I certainly would pay
to see Durán get a beating.

1535
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,640
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

1536
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,000
I'm gonna think about it.

1537
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,326
You were the best fighter in the world.

1538
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,488
And I want to see that back in the ring.

1539
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,601
You're just happy it will be another
black guy getting punched tonight.

1540
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,324
No shit.

1541
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,440
Thank you.

1542
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,721
Yeah, man.

1543
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,049
And tell your wife...

1544
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,924
I'm sorry.

1545
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:01,971
I will.

1546
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,844
Well, tonight happens to be

1547
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,724
Roberto Durán's 32nd birthday,
and he's promised to turn

1548
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:23,166
Madison Square Garden's fight
into a party for he and his friends.

1549
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:28,321
- Did Ray come?
- Why are you thinking about Ray?

1550
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,407
I am Sugar Ray Leonard reporting
to you on behalf of CBS Sports.

1551
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,722
Ray, I know you respect your former rival,

1552
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,888
but let's see if he even
finishes this one.

1553
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,444
But Durán's experience is sure to play

1554
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,891
a great deal in the fight tonight.

1555
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,845
He started out as a lightweight, and now
he's fighting as a light middleweight.

1556
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,849
Now, that's a tremendous jump
for any fighter.

1557
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:15,166
Okay, I gave both of you
instructions in the dressing room.

1558
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,930
I want to remind you.

1559
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,724
Obey my commands at all times.

1560
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:21,534
He is younger, stronger,
with a far longer reach,

1561
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:24,091
but I can tell you from first,
right and left hand experience

1562
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:27,010
why they call Manos de Piedra
Hands of Stone.

1563
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,127
Moore has power in that right,
and Durán felt it.

1564
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:18,008
Moore wants to get Durán out of here!

1565
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:45,800
Can Durán withstand
the punishment he's taking?

1566
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,884
We could be seeing the end
of Roberto Durán.

1567
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,681
Durán is on the attack.
He is going all in.

1568
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:07,441
How big a risk is this
against the younger Moore?

1569
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,127
How are you feeling?

1570
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,681
I wanna take these gloves off and kill him!

1571
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,410
That's the way to do it.

1572
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:32,362
No mercy.

1573
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,323
Focus on him.

1574
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,442
He's yours. He's already dead.

1575
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,886
Breathe...

1576
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,522
That's it. Let's go.

1577
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,602
I love you.

1578
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:43,682
You know how much.

1579
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,921
You are my son.

1580
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,167
You are my hero.

1581
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:52,087
Durán! Durán! Durán! Durán!

1582
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,965
Durán has found
a home for that right hand!

1583
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,366
He's landing it now.

1584
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,169
And there's the towel!

1585
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:48,206
Roberto Durán is the new

1586
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,607
super welterweight champion of the world!

1587
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,051
And it's his birthday.

1588
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,401
You're back, my love.

1589
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,604
Ray!

1590
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:38,811
Happy birthday, Papa!
Happy birthday, Papa!

1591
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,000
Happy birthday!

1592
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,322
Yeah! Thank you!
