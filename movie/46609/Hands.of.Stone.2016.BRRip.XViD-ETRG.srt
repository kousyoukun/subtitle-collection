00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,529
And then he'll wait for you
to get tired and try

334
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,008
and catch you,
and that's his strategy.

335
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,087
<i>ÉComprende?</i>

336
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,326
He expect (rapid humming)

337
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,363
but if you slow down

338
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,369
and go (whooshing, sputtering)

339
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,081
slow, slow, slow, slow,
slow, slow, slow...

340
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,408
<i>Buchanan no comprende.</i>

341
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,366
Get off the fence.

342
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,641
Excuse me?

343
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,647
Get off the fence.

344
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,091
Ah, shut up, schmuck.

345
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,526
SOLDIER: Who do you
think you are, old man?

346
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,085
I'm Ray Arcel from Harlem, USA.

347
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,281
You know where that is?

348
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,890
And this is
the future world champion

349
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,246
you're talking to here.

350
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,091
Fuck off.

351
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,601
He's in a jail and he thinks
he's in charge.

352
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,848
- We in jail.
- No, he-he's in jail.

353
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,361
- They put jail here.
- No, no, he...

354
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,801
He's... It's all in the head.

355
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,730
Boxing is a mental sport, <i>aqui.</i>

356
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,525
What you do with your body
is one-third of the job.

357
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,246
You got to learn to be
the boss, which you are.

358
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,850
Say it, "He's in jail."

359
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,530
Say it.
"He's in jail."

360
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,367
- He's in jail.
- He's in jail.

361
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,402
See? In jail.

362
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,726
I thought I told you
to fuck off.

363
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,490
You in jail.

364
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,408
You don't know
when to stop, do you?

365
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,329
You in jail.

366
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,283
- Okay, okay.
- You, you in jail.

367
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,880
Get the fuck out of here.

368
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,690
- Is that the way you want this
to go? -DURAN: You in jail.

369
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,847
You are in jail.

370
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480
I'm champion.
This is Panama.

371

RAY:
Nice.

372
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,881
Hook after the right.
Hook

373
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,641
Double up. Jab. Jab.

374
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,723
That's it,
that's it, there you go.

375
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,727
There you go.

Ciao.

380
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,010
Hey, you are the boxer.

381
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,327
Yes.

382
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,851
And you are?

383
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,971
I heard you won.

384
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,563
Yeah, that was easy.

385
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,648
Now I'm going for the world championship.

386
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,807
That's good.

387
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,490
Can I walk with you?

388
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,807
What school did you go to?

389
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,400
I went to the Plomo Quifiones school.

390
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,290
Now I'm in the Ray Arcel.

391
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,323
Ray Arcel?

392
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,566
Uh-huh.

393
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,648
American school?

394
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,207
Yes, American school.

395
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,607
You didn't go to school, did you?

396
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,650
But you can read, right?

397
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,371
This is like a job interview.

398
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,767
I thought I was walking you home.

399
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,885
Yes.

400
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,128
I can continue alone.

401
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,924
Why?

402
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,527
We come from different worlds.

403
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,923
It's all in the head.

404
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,888
What?

405
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,246
It's all in the head.

406
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,568
Turn the right hand over,
turn the right hand over.

your heroic mission

to expand boxing to the nation.

439
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,088
Boxing expanded.
I wasn't wrong.

440
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,202
Yes and no. But yes,

441
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,164
the sport makes
for fantastic television.

442
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,282
And now you're back.

443
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,641
Sort of.

444
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,125
I like you, Ray.

445
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,244
I feel really bad
for what they did to you.

446
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,283
I don't need to look
a gift horse up the ass

447
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,566
to know there's shit in there.

448
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,806
I thought we had a deal.

449
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,445
We do.

450
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,925
Maybe I'm confused
about what kind of deal

451
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,201
we're talking about.

452
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,810
You weren't meant to make money

453
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,046
from boxing again.

454
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,406
I'm training him for free.

455
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,522
You can check
with Carlos Eleta.

456
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,051
He's the fighter's manager.

457
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,650
You're a classy guy,

458
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,683
but you're not going to teach
me how to hide money.

459
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,564
Buchanan's favored 14 to three
against Duran, right?

460
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,806
That's right.

461
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,246
Except Durén's going to win.

462
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,442
Put all your money on Durén.

463
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,291
Make a bundle.

464
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,323
Leave me alone if he wins,

465
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,046
shoot me if he loses.
(chuckles)

466
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,047
You're a classy guy.

467
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,366
<i>JOURNAUST".
Mr. Arcel,</i>

468
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,601
why come back from retirement

469
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,404
with an unproven fighter?

470
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,329
I just turned 73.

471
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,408
You know,
seven decades and change.

472
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,204
And myself
and Freddy Brown here

473
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,446
have probably forgotten more

474
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,324
than most trainers
will ever learn.

475
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,329
But I remember well,

476
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,283
from the '20s to the '50s

477
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,607
we lived
the golden age of boxing.

478
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,449
Then television took over

479
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,361
and we all became... ambitious.

480
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,289
The sport turned
into a spectacle,

481
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,004
show business with blood.

482
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,771
And it was a good thing,
because we reached audiences

483
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,325
nobody thought we could reach.

484
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,329
The problem, inevitably,

485
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,283
is that the fighters
started doing it

486
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,371
for the fame, for greed,
for self-importance.

487
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,205
Independent promoters
faded away and, with them,

488
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,045
the true hungry fighters,
the lifeblood of this game.

489
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,164
Tonight, however, you'll meet
the best lightweight

490
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,049
New York has seen in 5O years.

491
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,124
Atrue, true hungry fighter.

492
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,366
Like in the old days.

493
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,369
He's got the soul, the rage,

494
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,086
the mental energy and
determination the sport needs,

495
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,565
and that's why I'm here.

496
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,205
Because a new

knockouts here.

He wants you to get tired.

If you don't go in
with a feint and a jab,

539

- Are you out of your mind?
- Yeah, he's taller than me...

Keep the pressure on him

Start working on the body.

We are here to participate in

679
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,406
the signing of treaties
which will assure

680

686

Dear Mr. President Carter.

687
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,448
In the name of the truth of logic,
I would like to say,

that we will sign this treaty.

But wait... this is important.

- Torrijos is good with the people.
- You wanna see the real Panama canal?

699

I've seen that tiny canal a million times.

You say that because all you have is a sail boat.

About what?

707

You've obviously never been chased by a Marine.

And it has nothing to do with being rich or poor.

718

It's common sense.

719

It says "Fighter of the year".

Fighter of the year? This clown?

727

He hasn't fought a man in his life.

728
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,367
He is the symbol of American sports.

821
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,489
And you see,
and you see his, um,

822
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,926
his diet cola commercial?

823
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,361
And he calls himself "Sugar"

824
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,608
-and he's selling you
sugar-free shit. -(laughter)

825
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,891
Or-or maybe, maybe that's what
we're gonna have.

826
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,128
A sugar-free fight.

827
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,611
(exclaiming)

828
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,250
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah!

829
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,566
I'm sorry, okay?

830
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,205
Sorry's not good enough.

831
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,007
How could you do that?
Insult a woman like that?

832
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,086
What's the matter with you?

833
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,362
Well, my country
felt insulted by yours.

834
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,050
And not only women.

835
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,766
Children.

836
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,211
What does your country
have to do

837
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,481
with the way
you talked to that woman?

838
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,085
The way you behaved?

839
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,727
You know how... you know how
it is to be hungry?

840
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,763
And I don't say,
"hungry" hungry.

841
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,008
To be hungry
that you have to go to...

842
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,610
to-to the garbage for food?

843
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,085
While the American army
is exploiting your country?

844
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,651
You know how it feels?

845
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,969
What does that have to do
with what you just did?

846
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,724
What are you...
what are you doing?

847
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,968
- Well, it has to do...
- You know, you want to be,

848
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,884
you want to be,
you want to be a warrior,

849
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,168
you want to avenge your people,
fine by me.

850
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,009
Avenge your people.
Be a warrior.

851
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,010
But real warriors
do not do what you did.

852
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,691
They don't mess with women
the way you just did.

853
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,808
And if you want me
in your corner,

854
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,922
you cannot do that again.

855
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,763
Well, well, okay,
okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

856
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,406
But I'm not gonna say
I'm sorry to him.

857
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,965
I say I'm sorry to you,

858
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,287
but I'm not gonna say
I'm sorry to him.

859
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,084
Let's forget it.

860
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,685
What's done is done.

861
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,564
Are you mad?

862
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,842
And let's just...

863
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,564
focus on the fight.

864
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,248
This anger you feel,
I understand that.

865
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,966
You don't want to become
a victim of your own mind game.

866
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,401
It's all in the head.

867
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,846
Robert.

868
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,689
Why are you here?

869
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,683
Huh?

870
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,485
If Ray finds out you are dead.

871
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,681
I can't sleep.

872
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,964
What's wrong?

873
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,321
I don't want to disappoint tomorrow.

874
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,885
Dad!

875
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,246
Hey!

876
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,206
My babies! Good morning!

877
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,403
Kisses for Daddy.

878
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,807
Can't wait to see you kill that coward!

879
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,251
Don't say that!

880
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,011
But Dad said it on TV.

881
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,964
It's my job to say those things.

882
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,082
So you're not gonna kill him?

883
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,885
Of course, I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

884
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,129
It's all a show.
He says that so the fight is more fun.

885
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,287
Come get dressed.

886
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,249
(muttering)

887
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,370
(cheering fades in)

888
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,045
HOWARD COSELL: Durén has turned
into the audience favorite

889
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,486
after a menacing training
process in town.

890
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,126
He has been so aggressive.

891
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,087
The referee tonight is Carlos
Padilla, who gloriously oversaw

892
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,682
the Thrilla in Manila
between Frazier and Ali.

893
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,171
You have to let them fight,
otherwise you're gonna see

894
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,406
two guys running all night.

895
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,568
To your corner.
To your corner.

896
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,722
Biggest ring I ever saw.

897
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,764
ANNOUNCER:
Sugar Ray Leonard!

898
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,370
-(booing)
- COSELL: The crowd

899
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,363
-is booing the champ,
ladies and gents... -Booing?

900
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,443
...in what must be
startling for Leonard,

901
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,324
who, in this very stadium

902
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,005
surprised the planet
by winning Olympic gold.

903
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,485
It's a wonderful day.

904
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,444
(booing continues)

905
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,881
JUANITA:
That's okay, baby!

906
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,809
It's your night tonight!

907
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,808
(booing continues)

908
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,005
You're dead meat, Durén!

909
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,087
- JUANITA: That's right.
- You're nothing.

910
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,690
Fuckin' Cholo!

911
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,767
JUANITA: Yeah.

912
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,924
Keep him close to your body.
Don't chase the lady.

913
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,280
Let her come to you.
Don't let her run.

914
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,129
Rather lose than run.

915
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,446
Look at him.

916
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,688
ANNOUNCER:
...15 rounds of boxing...

917
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,684
Strategy.

918
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,051
ANNOUNCER:
Presented by the promoter...

919
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,128
(announcer speaking Spanish)

920
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,003
COSELL: This Canadian crowd
has embraced

921
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,361
<i>the underdog Roberto Duran.</i>

922
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,130
ANNOUNCER 2:
Speculation has been rampant

923
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,811
over whether Leonard will turn
this into a street fight

924
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,002
or go back to the boxing

925
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,202
which brought him here.

926
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,607
-(bell clangs)
- Leonard and Durén!

927
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,087
(cheering)

928
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,968
Durén getting inside
the jab of Leonard.

929
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,287
At him!
Keep him on the ropes! At him!

930
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,802
ANNOUNCER 2: Two fighters
at the top of their game.

931
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,569
Jab! Jab! Jab!

932
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,250
Stay on him! Stay on him!

933
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,481
Get out of there,
get out of there!

934
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,364
(grunting)

935
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,164
(crowd cheering)

936
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,560
- Break it up. -ANNOUNCER 2:
That's not Leonard.

937
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,286
Leonard is short punches,
not wide ones.

938
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,162
Break it up.

939
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,930
(bell clanging)

940
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,367
COSELL:
The normally elusive Leonard

941
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,891
is staying flat-footed.

942
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,485
He wants to trade with Durén

943
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,489
and not back down.

944
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,329
He wants to prove he's a man.

945
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,169
Let him feel he's resisting.

946
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,851
Keep him hoping until he's
inspired and then kill him.

947
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,291
Look at me!

948
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,925
Who the fuck are you today?
Huh?

949
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,891
This is honor I'm fighting for.

950
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,331
ANGELO:
Fuck that shit!

951
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,049
-(clangs)
- Make him fight.

952
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,082
Go get him, champ!

953
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,247
- Run him around!
-(shouts indistinctly)

954
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,323
(cheering)

955
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,286
-(commentator speaking Spanish)
- Durén! Durén! Durén!

956
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,561
Durén! Durén!

957
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,361
(grunts)

958
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,365
COSELL: Durén lands
a left hook to the neck

959
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,289
that wobbles Leonard!

960
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,970
Ankles! Ankles!

961
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,525
(bell clangs)

962
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,926
<i>Dale Chucha tu Madre!</i>

963
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,008
COSELL:
This is not

964
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,610
the Leonard
we're used to seeing.

965
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,563
Can you believe he's trying

966
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,284
to match macho with macho?

967
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,731
ANNOUNCER 2:
Durén pushes back.

968
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,524
Leonard has some room now.

969
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,971
Good right hand by Leonard.

970
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,811
Break. Open. Open.

971
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,767
(whistle blows)

972
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,201
ANNOUNCER 2: The key to Leonard
is his left jab.

973
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,448
But it's also working in tandem
with those legs.

974
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,403
-(bell clangs) -Right now,
seems like he's flat-footed,

975
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,569
just trying to tee off
on Durén.

976
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,330
Go! Beat him!

977
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,410
(commentator speaking Spanish)

978
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,165
ANNOUNCER 2: Now, Sugar Ray
is fighting an inspired fight.

979
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,888
(bell clangs)

980
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,930
You gotta try
to knock him out, Cholo.

981
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,246
You never know

1303
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,249
He's a, he's a, he's a,
he's a good kid...

1304
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,885
He needs to be disciplined!

1305
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,361
He will be disciplined!
That's my job.

1306
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,371
If he loses, then we can sign
another rematch and...

1307
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,721
You're a sick paskudnyak
wanting your fighter to lose.

1308
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,291
No, what I said was, "if"...

1309
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,526
- Carlos, you have the money.
- Ray.

1310
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:36,971
- Family has the money.
- Ray.

1311
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,570
He didn't have it.
He doesn't care.

1312
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,290
The most important thing
for him is to win.

1313
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,482
The most important thing
for me is to win.

1314
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,608
To have the respect of winning.

1315
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,404
Right.
What I said was,

1316
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,881
if he loses,
he can have a rematch...

1317
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,570
I'm done.

1318
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,681
DURAN:
I met my father.

1319
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,882
- RAY: Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

1320
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,804
RAY:
What was he like?

1321
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,002
He's Mexican.

1322
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,485
I thought you said
he was American.

1323
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,726
Um, he's American.

1324
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,370
I mean, he was
born in America.

1325
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,370
And I thought that he would
look like Paul Newman.

1326
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,562
But he looks more like
Pancho Villa.

1327
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,563
Think you look
like Paul Newman?

1328
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,291
No, but Charles Bronson, maybe.

1329
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,203
There's someone else

1330
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:28,924
you're going to have
to learn to forgive.

1331
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,849
Carlos.

1332
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,406
Why?

1333
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,010
He agreed to the rematch.

1334
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,645
For when?

1335
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,001
- Three months from now.
- Well, that's impossible.

1336
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,600
We have to make it possible.
He already signed.

1337
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,131
He can't sign
without my permission.

1338
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,730
He said you gave him
your permission.

1339
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,888
At your house, at a party.

1340
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,565
In front of a lot of people.

1341
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,886
Witnesses, he said.

1342
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,651
(bat crashing against metal)

1343
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,484
Hi!

1344
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,886
ELETA:
Hi. They're insured.

1345
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,810
So you can destroy them
if you want.

1346
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,366
No matter what,
you're going to do the fight.

1347
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,881
- You want me to call the
police? -Yeah, call the police!

1348
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,048
They put me in jail and you
lose... you lose your fucking

1349
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,003
$8 million!

1350
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,122
Well, now, Cholo, now
you understand it's a business.

1351
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,686
- I'm not a hooker!
- A hooker is cheaper

1352
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,689
and it doesn't create
this much problems.

1353
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,131
You should be
training right now.

1354
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:22,044
I've been training
all my fucking life!

1355
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,282
Go home, Roberto.

1356
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,563
If you lose the fight,
we can have a rematch.

1357
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,365
I don't lose!

1358
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,608
ANNOUNCER (on TV): In Panama,
a nationalist demonstration...

1359
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,121
RAY: <i>We got 75 days
to lose 35 pounds.</i>

1360
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,844
<i>You've got to keep working,
Cholo.</i>

1361
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,406
<i>DURAN". I don't want to do this,
man, I want to rest.</i>

1362
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,487
- You want to rest?
- I'm tired, man.

1363
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,886
- You want to rest?
- Yes.

1364
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,128
To rest is to rust.
And you know that.

1365
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,526
You're the kind of fighter
that's gotta stay on your toes

1366
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,920
and if you don't
stay on your toes,

1367
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,166
then you're gone, that's it.

1368
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,725
And you can do this.

1369
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,729
But you're going to have
to decide to do this.

1370
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,251
Nobody can do it for you.

1371
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,885
There's no such thing
as a reluctant hero.

1372
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,240
You're going to have
to do it on your own.

1373
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,767
I work all my life, man.

1374
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,370
I work all my life.

1375
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,050
I didn't have any food
when I was a kid.

1376
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,209
I'm hungry, man, I'm hungry.

1377
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,049
I don't want to be
hungry anymore.

1378
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,248
I want to enjoy
what I have, Ray.

1379
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,647
ANNOUNCER (on TV): The rioting
that followed was unexpected.

1380
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,603
The Zone police used tear gas

1381
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,609
and fire hoses
to drive off the demonstrators.

1382
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,290
RAY:
I understand that.

1383
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,405
I can try to convince Don King
to delay the fight.

1384
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,126
But we got to be ready to fight
in case you have to.

1386
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,245
You still mad?

1387
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,362
Don't know what to tell you.

1388
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,361
Forgive me?

1389
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,130
0K8)'-

1390
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,370
I need you.

1391
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,525
I don't want to fight.

1392
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,847
Focus on your training.

1393
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,281
Why don't you come with the kids?

1394
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,805
I wanna see you.

1395
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,482
You need to rest, Robert. Go to sleep.

1396
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,965
Love you.

1397
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,284
I love you.

1398
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,088
Me too.

1399
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,806
KING:
Do you realize I'm black?

1400
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,251
Do you realize that I am

1401
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,691
the only black promoter

1402
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,689
in the business
and that if you pull out,

1403
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,280
-they will fry me?
- RAY: We're not pulling out.

1404
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,805
He can't make the weight.

1405
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,729
It's impossible for him
to make the weight.

1406
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,366
We got CBS.
We got the stadium.

1407
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,767
We got the sponsors.
We got the tickets.

1408
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,405
You can't go to them
and ask them?

1409
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,170
Yeah, I can go to them
and ask them.

1410
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,363
I'll say, "Excuse me, Mr. CBS,
I need another month."

1411
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,484
They'll say,
"Black nigger, no."

1412
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,931
That's what's going to happen.

1413
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,168
Your boy either has
to make his weight

1414
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,045
or he will be disqualified,
peﬂod.

1415
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,844
Yeah, but you're making it
about yourself.

1416
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,371
You're making it
about Bob Arum.

1417
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,606
You're saying that
"I'm gonna look bad.

1418
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,330
I'm the only black promoter."

1419
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,522
With all due respect,
that doesn't mean anything.

1420
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,523
You have a responsibility
to boxing.

1421
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,051
Boxing?

1422
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,004
Boxing has been run
by gangsters and criminals

1423
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,566
and scoundrels
since the day it was born.

1424
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,365
Come on, now.
Don't you put this on me.

1425
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,130
- Don't you dare put this on me.
-It's a sloppy production

1426
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,329
to start so soon
when he's not ready.

1427
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,807
I happen to think
that Roberto Durén,

1428
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,082
the man with the hands
of stone,

1429
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,328
if you challenge him,
he will be ready.

1430
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,001
He has got the spirit
of Panama in his heart.

1431
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,406
You don't have
to tell me what he has.

1432
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,646
I know him better
than anybody here.

1433
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,921
All right, I'm sorry.

1434
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,565
If we continue down
this road, Ray,

1435
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,967
I'm gonna have to sue you
for breach of contract.

1436
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,004
This is some mess
you got us into.

1437
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,565

1438

by Janelle Davidson playing)

1439
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,248
Oh. Gosh, Ray, you scared me.

1440
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,526
What are you doing here?

1441
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,846
How did you even get in?

1442
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,761
Hey. What...

1443
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,211
Hey...

1444
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,051
Ray, we can't do this.

1445
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,243
Babe, baby, okay, come on.

1446
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,203
Ray, look,
it's against the rules.

1447
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,446
The fight's
just around the corner.

1448
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,686
Come on, come on, babe.

1449
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,086
No, no, no, no, no.

1450
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,884
Shh, Shh, shh, shh.

1451
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,002
It's my rules this time.

1452
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,326
Okay?

01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,845
You're going
to have to shame him,

1458
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,849
right there,
in front of everyone.

1461
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,883
Sorry.

1462
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,048
Sorry, you have
to defend the title.

1463
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,686
Or what they'll do is
they'll just take it away.

1464
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,201
- What?
- They will take away the belt.

1465
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,685
But I won the fight.

1466
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,689
Everybody saw it.

1467
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,609
They can just take away
my belt?

1468

They-they... that's what
they can do.

1469
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,642
They will take it away
if you don't defend it.

RAY: <i>Roberto Durén had brought
us</i> a <i>new golden era for boxing.</i>

(applause)

1476
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,529
You're going to see
blood in this fight.

1477
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,529
I don't like clowns.

1478
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,564
When you come into the ring,
you come to fight,

1479
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,682
not to dance or to clown.

1480
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,450
He's imitating Ali all the
time, that's what he does.

1481
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,686
He doesn't have any style.

1482
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,131
I'm going to knock you out,

1483
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,924
'cause imitators are losers.

1484
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,605
And I don't like you.

1485
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,284
Well, I think Durén
is a lovable guy.

1486
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,368
And I want my son
to be just like him.

Listen.

1489
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,605
I think Durén is a tough,

1490
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,481
impressive,
intelligent fighter.

1491
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,406
And we are in
for a serious fight.

1492

You're gonna feel bad.

1493
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,406
Stop it.

1494
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,488
- Hand me that.
- You can't eat like this.

1495
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,284
Pass me that yellow thing.

1496
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,966
Why didn't I get wings when I asked?

1497
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,002
You have plenty.

1498
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,010
And why were you looking at Leonard?

1499
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,281
Don't start with that.

1500
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,845
You think I didn't see you?

1501
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,247
Don't fool me.

1502
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,761
- You think I'm stupid?
-Insane is what you are.

1503
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,929
I saw him winking at you.

1504
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,168
And you were all smiles.

That's what he wants
to do in this fight.

Suffocate him.

01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,608
Up against the ropes!
No mercy!

1553

Up against the ropes!

Cut him off.
Get him up against the ropes.

(bell clangs)

1559
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,963
You gotta be the host.
You're acting like a guest.

1560
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:44,967
You gotta pressure him, you
gotta put him on the ropes.

1561
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,445
You gotta bang to the body.

1562

It's your house.
Nobody else's. It's your house.

- You understand that, Cholo?
- I don't feel good.

1564
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,691
You're letting this guy
run all over you.

1565
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,687
He's running
in circles around you.

1566
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,245
You know that he does,

1567
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,361
-that's his defense.
- I don't feel good.

1568
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,487
You don't feel good?
You ate too much.

1569
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,648
Focus.
Don't let this guy run on you.

1570
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,650
-(bell clangs) -Don't let him
run, don't let him run on you.

1571
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,046
COSELL: Durén is falling
more and more,

1572
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,650
-on his part... -Keep him
there, keep him there!

1573
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,524
...into the pattern
of the first fight.

1574
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,247
- Durén got in a good shot.
- Yeah!

1575
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,442
- This is what Durén can do.
- That's it, that's it, Cholo.

1576
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,451
Hey!

1577
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,121
Durén is struggling
to contain Leonard.

1578
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,642
You can see his anger
and frustration.

1579
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,006
Cut him off!

1580
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,404
COSELL:
Leonard is a moving target.

1581
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,682
- And Durén is going...
- You get him! -(bell clangs)

1582
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,290
(Speaking Spanish)

1583
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,209
RAY: Get control of yourself.
Look at me! Look at me!

1584
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,287
- Box, motherfucker!
- Listen.

1585
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,004
- You gotta box him.
- Don't.

1586
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,326
- You're letting him do that.
- I'm very fucking pissed.

1587
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,926
COSELL:
Durén cannot get him

1588
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,169
up against the ropes like
he did in the first fight.

1589
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,481
Have you seen
the size of the ring?

1590
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,487
They built the ring on purpose

1591
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,487
so he can escape from me.

1592
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,250
(crowd cheers)

1593
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,486
COSELL:
The sneer is off his face.

1594
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,284
Yes! Yes, Ray!

1595
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,528
No, no, I'm a boxer.
I'm not a fucking ballerina...

1596
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,483
I don't come here
to dance with a man.

1597
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,682
(bell clangs)

1598
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,610
COSELL:
And he's got Durén. Openly.

1599
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,166
Not just furious but puzzled.

1600
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,760
Durén troubled by the movement.

1601
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,451
Dundee would be well advised,

1602
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,080
I think,
to tell Leonard to stop that.

1603
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,282
Leonard flaunting his skills.

1604
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,441
(muttering)

1605
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,971
And it is a vastly different

1606
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,206
-human being...
- Stop following him around!

1607
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,283
...that Durén is tonight.

1608
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,970
(Juanita laughs)

1609
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,684
That's right, baby!

1610
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,484
Yeah!

1611
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,841
Work on the body
and then up to the head.

1612
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,166
- Everybody is laughing at me.

When a fighter loses

it oftentimes
is the fighter's fault.

I don't need your food.

1774
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,361
I earn my meals fighting.

1775
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,528
You'll soon be begging for my autograph.

1776
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,126
Well said, champ.

1777
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,162
Who says well said?

1778
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,363
You are not from El Chorrillo anymore.
"No Mas: shit from you.

1779
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,688
I'll send you to the morgue
and make you quit again!

1780
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,848
Ungrateful kid.

1781
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,724
It's never enough!

1782
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,287
Without Torrijos' leadership
this country will go to shit.

1783
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,683
Let's go home, Robert.

The hope of El Chorrillo walked away.

1788
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,082
I walked away from the fight.

1789
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,082
I walked away just like my father.

1792
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,890
I let them down.

1793
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,607
I let them down and I let you down.

1794
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,247
I don't need to be the champion,

1795
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,607
but I need to fight.

1796
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,571
I'm going to fight.

1804

L-I'm done with it.

1805
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,289
And it has nothing
to do with you.

1806

I'm old. I'm tired.

You never really did.

1809
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,530
You're a naturally
great fighter.

1810
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,291
You have great
fighter's instincts.

1811

I was just there
to support you.

That's not true.

I need you in my corner, Ray.

1814
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,444
Not anymore, you don't.
You're an adult now.

1815
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,050
You have children of your own.

1816
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:38,730
You don't need a father.

1817
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:41,127
You need somebody to bring
the street back into you.

1818
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,651
- Talk to Plomo.
- Plomo?

1819
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,125
He knows you
better than anybody.

1820
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,810
He's been with you
from the beginning.

1821
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,604
I'll help you get a fight.

1822

I'll be watching you
all the time.

1823
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,851
But get Plomo
to bring you back.

1824
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,769
That's who you need.

1825
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,211
- Okay.
- And please,

Yeah, well...
