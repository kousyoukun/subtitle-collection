They put me in jail and you lose... you lose your fucking

1097
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:12,000
$8 万 ！

1098
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,120
好 ， 现在好了 ， 现在你知道这只是生意。
Well, now, Cholo, now you understand it's a business.

1099
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,680
- 我不是妓女 ！ - 廉价妓女
- I'm not a hooker! - A hooker is cheaper

1100
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,680
而且它不能创造这么多的问题。

1101
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,130
你现在应该被训练。

我所有我的生活 ！

回家吧 ， 罗伯特。

1104
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,560
如果你输掉了这场战争 ， 我们再比一场。
If you lose the fight, we can have a rematch.

1105
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,360
我不会输 ！

1106
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,600
在巴拿马 ， 民族主义者的示威。..

你得继续工作 ， 好了。
You've got to keep working, Cholo.

1109
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,400
我不想这么做 ， 老兄 ， 我想休息。
I don't want to do this, man, I want to rest.

- 你想休息吗 ？ - 是的。
- You want to rest? - Yes.

1112
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,120
休息是生锈。 和你知道的。
To rest is to rust. And you know that.

1113
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,520
你对这样的战士 ， 要警惕
You're the kind of fighter that's gotta stay on your toes

1114
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,160
如果你不警惕 ， 然后你就失业了 ， 就这样。
and if you don't stay on your toes, then you're gone, that's it.

1115
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,720
你可以这样做。
And you can do this.

1116
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,720
但你必须做这个决定。
But you're going to have to decide to do this.

1117
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,250
没有人可以代替你。
Nobody can do it for you.

1118
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,880
没有任何一种不情愿的英雄。
There's no such thing as a reluctant hero.

1119
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,240
你必须自己干。
You're going to have to do it on your own.

1120
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,760
我工作了一辈子 ， 男人。
I work all my life, man.

1121
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,370
我一生都工作。

1122
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,050
我没有带任何食物 ， 当我还是个孩子。
I didn't have any food when I was a kid.

1123
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,200
我很饿 ， 我饿了。

1126

对 ， 有点出乎意料。
The rioting that followed was unexpected.

1127

中区警察使用催泪瓦斯和消防龙头 ， 驱散示威者。
The Zone police used tear gas and fire hoses to drive off the demonstrators.

1128
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,290

你还生气吗 ？

01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,360
不知道怎么告诉你。
Don't know what to tell you.

1134

1138
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,840
专注于你的训练。
Focus on your training.

1139
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,280
你要和我的孩子吗 ？

1140
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,800
我不想见到你。

1145
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,800
你知道我是黑人 ？
Do you realize I'm black?

1146
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,690
你知道我是只黑色的启动子
Do you realize that I am the only black promoter

1147
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,680
在商界 ， 如果你拔、
in the business and that if you pull out,

1148
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,280
- 他们会炒我吗 ？ - 我们不会撤出。
- they will fry me? - We're not pulling out.

1149
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,800
他不能把体重降下来。
He can't make the weight.

1150
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,720
他不可能犯那么大的重量。
It's impossible for him to make the weight.

1151
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,360
我们得到了 CBS 。 我们到体育场了。
We got CBS. We got the stadium.

1152
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,760
我们的赞助商。 我们买到了票。
We got the sponsors. We got the tickets.

1153
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,400
你不能去叫他们吗 ？
You can't go to them and ask them?

1154
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,170
是啊 ， 我可以去问一问。
Yeah, I can go to them and ask them.

1155

我就说 ， “对不起 ， 先生 ， 我需要一个月。”
I'll say, "Excuse me, Mr. CBS, I need another month."

1156
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,480
他们会说 ， “黑鬼黑 ， 没有。”
They'll say, "Black nigger, no."

1157
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,930
有什么事故发生。
That's what's going to happen.

1158
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:44,040
你儿子有让他或他的重量将被取消资格。
Your boy either has to make his weight or he will be disqualified, period.

1159
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,840
是啊 ， 但你让它自己。
Yeah, but you're making it about yourself.

1160
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,370
你不会再约阿鲁姆。
You're making it about Bob Arum.

1161
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,600
你是说 ， “我会看起来很糟。
You're saying that "I'm gonna look bad.

1162
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,330
我只有黑色的启动子。 “
I'm the only black promoter."

1163
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,520
恕我直言 ， 这并不意味着什么。
With all due respect, that doesn't mean anything.

1164
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,520
你有责任。
You have a responsibility to boxing.

1165
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,050
拳击吗 ？
Boxing?

1166
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,000
拳击一直是被罪犯和强盗
Boxing has been run by gangsters and criminals

1167
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,560
流氓无赖的那天起它就诞生了。
and scoundrels since the day it was born.

1168
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,360
来吧 ， 现在。 你不要把责任推给我。
Come on, now. Don't you put this on me.

1169
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,130
- 不要你敢推我头上。 - 这是个草率的生产
- Don't you dare put this on me. - It's a sloppy production

1170
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,320
所以当他一开始也没做好。
to start so soon when he's not ready.

1171
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:14,080
我反而认为 ， Roberto Dur á n ， 男子手中的石头 ，
I happen to think that Roberto Durán, the man with the hands of stone,

1172
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,320
如果你向他挑战 ， 他将准备。
if you challenge him, he will be ready.

1173
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,000
他在巴拿马的精神在他的心脏。
He has got the spirit of Panama in his heart.

1174
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,400
你不用告诉我他有什么。
You don't have to tell me what he has.

1175
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,640
我知道这里有人比他更好。
I know him better than anybody here.

1176
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,920
好吧 ， 我很抱歉。
All right, I'm sorry.

1177
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,560
如果我们继续这样下去 ，
If we continue down this road, Ray,

1178
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,960
我就告你违反合约。
I'm gonna have to sue you for breach of contract.

1179
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,000
这是你让我们陷入一些混乱。
This is some mess you got us into.

1180
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,240
哦。 天啊 ， 雷 ， 你吓死我了。
Oh. Gosh, Ray, you scared me.

1181
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,520
你在这里干什么 ？
What are you doing here?

1182
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,840
你是怎么进来的 ？
How did you even get in?

1183
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,760
嘿。 . 什么..
Hey. What...

1184
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,210
. 嘿..
Hey...

1185
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,050
雷 ， 我们不能这样做。
Ray, we can't do this.

1186
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,240
宝贝 ， 宝贝 ， 好吧 ， 来吧。
Babe, baby, okay, come on.

1187
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,200
雷 ， 瞧 ， 这是犯规。
Ray, look, it's against the rules.

1188
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,440
战斗就在拐角处。
The fight's just around the corner.

1189
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,680
来吧 ， 来吧 ， 宝贝。
Come on, come on, babe.

1190
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,080
不 ， 不 ， 不 ， 不 ， 不。
No, no, no, no, no.

1191
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,880
嘘 ， 嘘 ， 嘘 ， 嘘。

1192
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
这是我的规则。
It's my rules this time.

1193
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,320
好吗 ？
Okay?

1194
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,000
你要打败 Dur á n,
You want to beat Durán,

1195
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,240
你要羞辱他。
you're going to have to humiliate him.

1196
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,840
你去给他丢脸了 ， 在大家面前。
You're going to have to shame him, right there, in front of everyone.

1197
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,850
它不会工作。
It's not going to work.

1198
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,880
对不起。
Sorry.

1199
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,040
对不起 ， 你必须捍卫冠军。
Sorry, you have to defend the title.

1200
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,680
或者他们会做什么 ， 他们就会把它拿走。
Or what they'll do is they'll just take it away.

1201
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,200
- 什么 ？ - 将所述带。
- What? - They will take away the belt.

1202
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,680
但我赢得了比赛。

1203
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,680
大家都看到了。
Everybody saw it.

1204
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,600
他们可以拿走我的皮带吗 ？
They can just take away my belt?

1205
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,040
他们 - 他们了 ， 他们能做的。

1206
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,640
他们会拿走你不捍卫它。
They will take it away if you don't defend it.

1207
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,920
Roberto Dur á n 把我们带到了一个新的黄金时代的拳击。
Roberto Durán had brought us a new golden era for boxing.

1208
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,850
然而 ， 我们提醒他 ， 他的作品。
Yet here we were, reminding him that he didn't matter.

1209
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,080
这决定了后面的房间
That decisions were made in the back room

1210
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,800
当时他只有马戏团的动物需要的门票销售。
and he was only a circus animal we needed for ticket sales.

1211
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,040
批准。
Approved.

1212
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,520
你会看到在这个斗争。
You're going to see blood in this fight.

1213
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,520
我不喜欢小丑。
I don't like clowns.

1214
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:56,680
当你走进了斗牛圈 ， 你是来打架的 ， 不是舞蹈或小丑。
When you come into the ring, you come to fight, not to dance or to clown.

1215
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,450
他一直在模仿阿里 ， 他一直如此。
He's imitating Ali all the time, that's what he does.

1216
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,680
他没有任何风格。
He doesn't have any style.

1217
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,920
我把你一把他的模仿者是输家。
I'm going to knock you out, 'cause imitators are losers.

1218
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,600
我不喜欢你。
And I don't like you.

1219
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,280
嗯 ， 我觉得 Dur á n 是一个可爱的家伙。
Well, I think Durán is a lovable guy.

1220
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,360
我想要我的儿子像他一样。

1221
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,120

我认为 Dur á n 是坚韧的

1224
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,400
我们是一个重大打击。

1225
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:41,960
你会觉得不好。

这是你的房子。 不是别人的。 这是你的房子。
It's your house. Nobody else's. It's your house.

1290
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,250
- 你明白吗 ， 丘洛 ？ - 我感觉很不舒服。

1305
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,400
伦纳德是一个移动的目标。

- You're letting him do that. - I'm very fucking pissed.

1311
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:44,160
Dur á n 无法把他拉起来的绳子在他的第一次战斗。
Durán cannot get him up against the ropes like he did in the first fight.

1312
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,480
看到你的尺寸吗 ？
Have you seen the size of the ring?

1313
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,480
他们修建了环的目的 ， 这样他就能摆脱我。
They built the ring on purpose so he can escape from me.

1314
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,480
是在嘲笑他。
The sneer is off his face.

1315

我不是来这里跳舞的人。

他与 Dur á n 。 公开。

Dur á n 运动造成了困扰。

1321
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:17,080
邓迪最好建议 ， 我认为 ， 告诉 Leonard 停止。
Dundee would be well advised, I think, to tell Leonard to stop that.

1322
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,280

1327
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,840
对身体 ， 然后到头部。

1328
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,160
- 大家都在笑我。 - 没有。

- I'm not a fucking clown in the, on the ring. - Get, get out of your...

冷静下来。
Calm down.

你让。.. L - 看着我。
You're let... L-Look at me.

1336
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,320
你不需要这样做 ， 好吗 ？
You don't need to do that, all right?

1337
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,320
你想成为次中量级世界冠军。
You're about to be welterweight champion of the world.

1338
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,520

你没有做你该做什么。

I want to be proud of you. I want you to get out there and I want you to...

Look at me! You're Roberto Durán.

1343
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,280
在此同时 ， 无影。
Get in there and act like him.

1344
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,080
去的身体 ！ 截住他!

罗伯托。 罗伯特 ， 怎么回事 ？

我退出拳击比赛。

1368

他说 ， 他退出拳击比赛。

1369
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,280
突然 ， 莫名其妙 ，
Suddenly, inexplicably,

1370
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,560
战斗已经结束。

I don't care how much ability you've got as a fighter.

1379

如果你认为 ， 你只是个流浪汉在公园。
If you can't think, you're just another bum in the park.

1380

拳击是大脑而不是肌肉。

1381

成千上万的人在超级圆顶体育馆

1382
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,450

and millions more in the closed circuit theaters across the country

1383
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,720
自己被骗去看看 ， 让他们看到报酬。

1384
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:54,650
委员会和公众应该得到解释。
The commission and the public deserve an explanation.

1385

当一个战士在战斗中失去的环 ， 它经常被飞机上的故障。
When a fighter loses a fight in the ring, it oftentimes is the fighter's fault.

1386
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,840

1387

1391
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,920
电视会让别人认为自己是一个神。

1392
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,280

1393
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,800
也许我不能 ， 呃 ，

1394
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,280
我战机停飞。

1395
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,080
但我可以告诉你 ：

1396
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,770
Roberto Dur á n 绝不是懦夫。
Roberto Durán is no coward.

1397
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,520
他没有离开这个圈不再惧怕的对手。

有说法是暂停 Dur á n 。

1400
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,320
你说怎么样 ？
What would you say about that?

1401
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,040
我 - 我不知道发生了什么事。
I-I don't know what happened.

1402
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,760
如果不的话 ， 那么你就不。
And if I don't, then you don't.

1403
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,370
但是我知道

1404
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,720
Dur á n Roberto 如何开始人生。

1405

我知道他自己的意志。

1406

我深知荣誉的他 ，

1407

有时 ， 不值得。

1408

我知道 ， 你不能停学。

1409
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,920
他值得更好的。
He deserves better.

1410
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,800
如果你不明白 ， 你对他做这些 ，
And if you don't understand that and you do this to him,

1411
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,960
你明天醒来 ， 你会感到羞愧。

1412

我们有理由或者没有权利
We have no more right or reason

1417
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:08,960
出卖了巴拿马运河区 ， 会比我们现在放弃阿拉斯加。
for giving away the Panama Canal Zone than we would to now give away Alaska.

1418
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:12,050
我认为 ， 我们的政策应该是一个外国
And I think that our foreign policy should be one
