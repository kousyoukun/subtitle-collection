1
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:02,310
They're coming!

2
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:05,481
Right on time!

3
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,896
Is this number 7 of Carbone Alley?

4
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:35,109
Impounded on 16 September 1954

5
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:37,340
the furniture of Adelina Sbaratti

6
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,844
My wife

7
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:42,644
...the consignee, on account of an unpaid fine of
28,000 lire

8
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:47,048
28,000 lire is the fine. Procedural fees...

9
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,220
interest and costs, etc.

10
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,792
Brings us to 50,780

11
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,692
Wasn't 28,000 better?

12
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:03,765
Well, are you going to pay this 50, 780?

13
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,870
What, we didn't pay 28 and we pay 50?

14
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,035
- Where's the consignee?
- My wife?

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,837
She's not here

16
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:14,148
I'll take the furniture then

17
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,849
Come in, sir

18
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:19,889
Let's see...

19
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:23,151
A walnut table 6x4...

20
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:32,427
You made a clean sweep. It's out of my hands now

21
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:35,035
This is a court matter. Make way!

22
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,346
We fooled him!

23
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:27,052
He wanted Adelina Sbaratti?

24
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:33,123
That's all you're good at, but it won't get you
anywhere

25
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:35,721
You're in big trouble now

26
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,933
- What's he after?
- He came on Wednesday

27
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:38,956
- Who is he?
- Search me

28
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:43,429
I'm Verace, a lawyer, and you're illiterate clowns!

29
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:46,899
That was no joke, you're in big trouble

30
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,745
You'll see when the police come

31
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,406
You'll go to jail for the crime you committed!

32
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:53,446
What crime?

33
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:58,617
You violated Art. 384 of the Criminal Code!

34
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:00,217
That's what you did!

35
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:03,826
Mr Verace!

36
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:09,196
Explain it to us, we're ignorant

37
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:13,393
First you get into trouble, then you come to us
lawyers

38
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:15,001
But it was only a fine

39
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:19,234
Which you didn't pay, so they impounded your
furniture

40
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:25,108
And you came up with the smart idea of hiding it

41
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:30,013
But my friend is a bit... needy

42
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:31,878
What did they fine him for?

43
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,149
Selling contraband cigarettes

44
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:40,329
I'm sorry, my friend, but you're in big trouble

45
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,490
But it's not me, it's my wife, a mother of children!

46
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:47,759
They fined her. The furniture's hers, the rent's in her
name

47
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,394
Then she'll go to jail

48
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,634
Don't let him get away. Pasquale, call Adelina!

49
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,014
Mr Verace!

50
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,412
Mr Verace!

51
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,253
Cigarettes!

52
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,532
English, American, Swiss!

53
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:29,372
English, American, Swiss! Who smokes?

54
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,079
Sir! I buy dollars!

55
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:37,453
Adelina, you're the only one who can persuade the
lawyer

56
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,944
What lawyer?

57
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,620
The bailiff came, and a lawyer says we're in trouble

58
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,324
What kind of trouble?

59
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:47,888
Damn them!

60
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:52,099
Hey! Come here, boy!

61
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,929
- Come see the lawyer?
- And let everything bum?

62
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,201
You go, we'll take care of the boy

63
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,637
- What about my box?
- Nobody'll touch it

64
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,067
Damn them!

65
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:10,178
Hey, a client! That gentleman's mine

66
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,118
English, American, Swiss...

67
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:16,116
- But ma'am...
- Yes, I'm coming!

68
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:21,756
What he says is true. If he can't help you, he can't
help you

69
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,092
He wouldn't miss good business

70
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,667
But he may just be saying that because he's angry

71
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,195
I've told you once, please go away

72
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:33,337
If you let us see him, we'll give you something

73
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,004
Word of honour, I never saw two more deceitful
people!

74
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,977
You get it, I won't budge from here

75
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,486
- Carmelo...
- At last! Come in

76
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,492
Who are you? Where are you going?

77
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:52,819
- That way
- Let's go

78
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:55,591
You can't go in, is that clear?

79
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:03,269
- Where is he?
- Mr Verace, help us!

80
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,273
She can't go to jail!

81
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:08,300
I was fined for selling cigarettes

82
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,911
You know how long it takes to make 28,000 lire?

83
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,905
Days... weeks even

84
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:14,849
Out there, rain or sun

85
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,986
My husband's been out of work

86
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,682
since he was drafted. How can we get by?

87
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,655
Then a creep comes along and arrests you

88
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:32,159
No, wait a minute, they can't arrest her

89
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:37,936
What?

90
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:39,806
She's breeding!

91
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:40,676
They can't arrest her, she's breeding!

92
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,439
They can't arrest her, she's breeding!

93
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:46,004
They can't arrest her, get it? She's breeding!

94
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:49,779
They can't jail her for that crime. She's breeding

95
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,781
Have you heard? They can't arrest her

96
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:53,887
Why not?

97
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,053
She's breeding

98
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:56,384
Yes, she's breeding!

99
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:19,505
Yes, she's breeding!

100
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,852
She's breeding, she's breeding, cha-cha-cha...

101
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,379
I have an American specialty, painless childbirth!

102
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:13,859
- Good luck!
- Same to you!

103
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,504
Here they are, nice and fresh

104
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:30,612
Mark it. They're hot, they're hot!

105
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:36,608
The lawyer must know. A pregnant woman can't be
arrested

106
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:40,614
until after the baby's born

107
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,124
Plus 6 months for nursing

108
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:49,326
Kids are a great thing, a gift of Providence

109
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,724
although I never had the pleasure

110
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,093
Is it my fault?

111
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:58,706
I have what it takes! But we won't go into that

112
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:03,435
I'm only saying that the best thing in the world

113
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:08,316
is when a man comes home and his wife says she
wants a baby

114
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:12,788
"Heart, ungrateful heart..."

115
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,418
Well, what's the joke?

116
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:18,851
I'd been drafted...

117
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,521
No, let me tell it

118
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:25,430
We were going together and... well, it happened

119
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:27,465
"Carmelo, how can I tell Mom?"

120
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,667
This idiot was all happy. "Are you really sure?"

121
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:35,609
"I'll see a midwife tonight." "But I can't get a pass"

122
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:40,377
"If it's a definite, I'll come and sing outside the
barracks"

123
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,550
So that's it!

124
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,653
"Ungrateful Heart" all night

125
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,355
I didn't sleep a wink.

126
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:50,887
We were married soon after

127
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:55,061
Mom was against it."Adelina, I can't give you a cent"

128
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:59,429
"Carmelo's broke and I have 15 kids.
What if you take after me?

129
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,828
"Mom, we'll be careful"

130
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,342
You didn't keep your word and now you're
pregnant again

131
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,774
Yes, just look at it

132
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,583
I could have gone to jail

133
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:27,692
The baby's due any day... A short rest...

134
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,431
July, August, September, November, December

135
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:35,727
Carmelo, you'll have to get busy at Christmas

136
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,099
Right

137
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,936
Here I am

138
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:31,185
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas

139
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,424
- Good night! Merry Christmas!
- Thank you

140
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:41,793
Good night, Mom. Merry Christmas

141
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:44,301
All on my own... you have things to do

142
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,533
- Mom, I explained.
- I understand

143
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:51,910
We'll have dinner together tomorrow. Oh, I nearly
forgot!

144
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:54,412
Granny's made some ointment for your chilblains

145
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:55,914
Do I put it on at night?

146
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:57,983
Yes, rub it on when he's in bed

147
00:13:58,153 --> 00:14:00,314
Thanks, Mom. See you tomorrow

148
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:04,988
Take care. Merry Christmas again

149
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,091
Come and celebrate!

150
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:12,692
Amedeo's brought a big cake from Milan

151
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,495
They're all waiting for you

152
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,406
Pasquale, it's Christmas. I don't want to go to jail

153
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:23,604
I get it, you'll have a better Christmas than us

154
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:26,371
Stop that! Get moving!

155
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,496
Who lives here?

156
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:48,134
Adelina Sbaratti. I'm here, come in

157
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,874
The term's up, it's time for you vacation.
You're under arrest

158
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:01,880
What does that mean?

159
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,518
The doctor's certificate is on the table

160
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,486
If you want it, help yourself

161
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:12,258
Or come back in a few months and you'll find two of
them

162
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,469
- Congratulations
- Thank you

163
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:39,180
See how well he's learned? English, American, Swiss

164
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:40,250
Swiss!

165
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,180
How cute he is!

166
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:48,191
The cops... The cops!

167
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,234
Go ahead, arrest me! I have another five months

168
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,144
50 lire's worth of chestnuts

169
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:42,040
Sorry, huh? The usual favor...

170
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:52,124
Right, let's see

171
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,994
Forget it, for a few chestnuts...

172
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:57,195
Thank you

173
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:01,165
- I can't make it out
- You wrote it

174
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,997
The best I could

175
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,639
Darn reading and writing!

176
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:13,247
Delivered on October 28... I was selling prickly pears
then

177
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:16,918
Six months' nursing. October, November,
December...

178
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,011
Her reprieve ends in May, when cherries come out

179
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,081
It's January now. There's time

180
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,156
Carmelo, if you need any help, feel free!

181
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:31,691
Pasquale, if you need a baby, I do home catering!

182
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,344
Two pounds of cherries

183
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:57,514
Cherries! Cherries!

184
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,438
A couple of cherries for her...

185
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:27,848
- The certificate?
- The certificate!

186
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,523
- Another child?
- Another child

187
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,322
That's four. How many more?

188
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:34,418
All the ones that come!

189
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:51,010
Maria, don't be late! And take the umbrella

190
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:53,414
All right, Mom

191
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,333
Open wide, here comes the fuel!

192
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:23,238
Have they finished, Pasquale?

193
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,137
It's all gone, look!

194
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:28,176
Make me a pacifier for Caterina

195
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,314
Coming up

196
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:33,820
I'll make it later. Let me quiet the kids down first

197
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:37,084
Come here, kids. Pasquale's got something nice for
you

198
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:40,756
Easy now, one at a time

199
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:50,904
One for you, one for you... and we'll keep these for
later

200
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:54,203
Now be good while I make a pacifier for Caterina

201
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:57,877
Nunziatina, let me tie a bow in your hair

202
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,571
You must have a bow

203
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:03,511
No bow, no candy

204
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:07,677
Where's Carmelo?

205
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,519
He's in a bad way

206
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,891
With seven kids it's a regular fanfare all night

207
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:17,691
I sent him off to Mom's to get an hour's sleep

208
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:24,530
How pretty you look!
Now Pasquale will give you some more candy

209
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,603
Here you are

210
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,176
This fanfare seems to do you good, though

211
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,240
You're prettier than ever now, bless you

212
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:38,183
Kids are good for me. Some women fall apart after
the first

213
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,018
But not me. Look... seven kids

214
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,318
The cough medicine, I forgot

215
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:47,925
I don't want it

216
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:53,161
You'll take it. It was bought and it has to be used

217
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:56,905
You'll take it

218
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:03,373
Come here or I'll smack you!

219
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:06,672
Not like that. Kindness gets you everywhere. Let me
try

220
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,547
Come out!

221
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:09,716
Come out!

222
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,252
Come to Uncle Pasquale...

223
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,616
Go to hell!

224
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,583
What, to your Uncle Pasquale? Come on now

225
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:24,926
What did he do?

226
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,295
He bit me... it's nothing

227
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:31,403
I'll fix him! He'll come out!

228
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:42,011
Get out from under there!

229
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,183
I've got him!

230
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:47,649
Hold him tight!

231
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:49,421
Don't let him go!

232
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:53,484
My name's not Adelina Sbaratti

233
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:54,426
if you don't take it

234
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:02,093
We can't throw money out of the window like that

235
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,169
For a tantrum! 400 lire!

236
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:15,109
Come on now, out you go! Go outside

237
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,314
Here, buy yourselves a lollypop

238
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:28,161
I'll send them to school

239
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,899
Now come to bed like a good girl

240
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:37,065
Adelina, she has to eat something

241
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:40,333
What? She had two plates of pasta! Put her to bed

242
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:44,009
She's fast asleep already... Let's go

243
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:48,212
This is red hot

244
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:56,422
I'd keep you company but I have things to do

245
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,324
Off you go, and thank you. What a good father you'd
make

246
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:04,361
Pasquale! Are you crazy?

247
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:10,304
I'm sorry, I got a bit carried away

248
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,374
I'm sorry!

249
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:22,672
I can't, Mom, I can't! Can't you hear them?

250
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:26,148
I came here to sleep. Have a word with Don Antonio

251
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:30,590
But they have to work. I pay next to nothing a
month here

252
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,423
Don Antonio, will you be long?

253
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:39,691
Another 10 minutes, then we break for lunch

254
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,764
But if you go on hammering?

255
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,670
Don't worry, we'll let Carmelo get an hour's sleep

256
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:45,569
Thank you

257
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:50,409
Look how long he's keeping me waiting!

258
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,676
I'll come at 9, he says. It's 10:30 and he hasn't shown

259
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:57,980
At last! It took you long enough. Come on!

260
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,220
I've come from Porta Capuana

261
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:04,487
Come on...

262
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,026
- So?
- I've come from Porta Capuana

263
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:07,390
No, it's not me! This way!

264
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:10,296
Came in, hurry up!

265
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:23,175
No, over here... on the bed

266
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:23,937
You want a boy or a girl?

267
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,637
Anything goes, as long as it's a sure thing

268
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:29,546
That costs 50 lire more

269
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:30,141
All right

270
00:24:30,652 --> 00:24:31,641
All right, ring the bell.
- Now?

271
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:32,678
Tomorrow?

272
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,548
Where does your husband sleep?

273
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:35,155
Here

274
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:40,117
Ring the bell, please.

275
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:04,984
I can't take any more!

276
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:09,288
Right, you must look after yourself

277
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:13,249
The first thing is sleep. I'll make you some herb tea

278
00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:17,798
Herb tea, when my life's been hell for three years?

279
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:19,299
What a calamity...

280
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:24,166
It's always the same: get busy, the nursing term's
over!

281
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:29,343
Go to bed early! The police! Turn the light out!

282
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:34,314
And all that on a bowl of soup a day. I'm not made
of iron

283
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:39,847
Doing it to order is one thing, but this is continuous

284
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,850
You do look peaked

285
00:25:41,923 --> 00:25:42,981
That follows

286
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:48,258
Dizzy spells, wobbly legs

287
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,297
And if you must know, I've fainted twice in the
street

288
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:57,164
And the more I become a wreck, the more she's at
me

289
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:02,837
How pretty she's grown, Mom. She's blossomed like
a rose

290
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:08,507
She's bleeding you dry. You've grown as ugly as an
ape

291
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,649
Let the rose find herself

292
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:14,177
someone to make her breed to order

293
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:19,293
I'll kill her... if anything like that happens

294
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,897
Carmelino...

295
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:23,620
Carmelo, give me a hand

296
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:55,113
A chicken, pasta and wine, 100 lire. What number?

297
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:56,748
Give me 89

298
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:00,857
Who wants a number? Buy a lottery ticket!

299
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:04,165
Darn it, I was dead certain this time. Two weeks!

300
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:09,703
I even made an appointment with the doctor for
the certificate

301
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:15,074
And instead I feel lousy. I guess I'm not used to it
any more

302
00:28:26,354 --> 00:28:29,016
- Beat it!
- What do you mean?

303
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,723
I mean I was late and there's no baby

304
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:35,624
How can I help it? How can I help it?

305
00:28:37,832 --> 00:28:39,322
Are you trying to send the poor girl to jail?

306
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:42,560
- You can't think that!
- We do think that!

307
00:28:43,071 --> 00:28:45,631
Look at my husband, and learn!

308
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:51,509
- You can go in
- Thank you

309
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:56,876
Come in, come in

310
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:00,745
Sit down

311
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:06,822
Sorry to bother you, but I always give you fresh
cigarettes

312
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:09,963
So I thought you'd give me preferential treatment
too

313
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:13,329
Of course... And how's business?

314
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:14,868
I can't complain

315
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,102
What's it about?

316
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,275
You tell him, Carmelo, you're the man

317
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,704
He's shy

318
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,877
A doctor's like a confessor

319
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:33,914
Doctor, I...

320
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:36,852
Since we got married, it's been continuous

321
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:41,157
There's never been a break in this... current

322
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:44,298
Seven kids, and I'm still nursing

323
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:47,966
It's not my fault, Doctor. The will is there

324
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:49,262
You bet

325
00:29:49,637 --> 00:29:52,970
We married for love. It's obvious the will was there

326
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:56,667
But if this goes on, who'll keep the kids?

327
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:00,408
He's out of work, I have to provide for everyone

328
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:02,240
Your wife's right

329
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,884
Sure, but I'm right too

330
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:09,515
We're not animals. Your wife's pretty, you're in love

331
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,021
but you ought to control yourself, my boy

332
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:15,185
It's not that I don't feel the urge. I do feel it

333
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:18,230
Stifle it. So you don't want any more children?

334
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:22,369
No, quite the opposite. But he doesn't work any
more

335
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:25,870
Just a minute... The urge is there

336
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:29,005
I don't understand. What is it you want?

337
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:30,938
Another child!

338
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:34,677
So you came to have your husband examined?

339
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:35,714
Yes, sir

340
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,608
Come over here them

341
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,523
Sit down here

342
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:47,528
Take your jacket off

343
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:50,660
- The urge is there
- I feel the urge too

344
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:52,993
Cross your legs

345
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:01,575
His leg reacts, it moves

346
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,235
What do I care if his leg moves?

347
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,050
You're slightly anaemic. Let's check your blood
pressure

348
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:14,681
There's nothing wrong with him, he's just very tired

349
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,584
You're undernourished

350
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,117
Is it serious?

351
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:25,230
There's no need to worry, it's a very minor thing

352
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,340
- Pressure, 80
- Is that good?

353
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:37,909
No, bad. He's run down

354
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:40,844
What should he do?

355
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:45,748
You don't whip a tired horse, you put him in the
stable

356
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:52,087
Let him be for three months. He'll take treatment

357
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:56,358
eat nourishing food, and you'll have the baby next
year

358
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:06,538
Hello, Adelina. Look at this

359
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:09,172
I brought the medicine for Carmelo

360
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,175
Good. What is it?

361
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:15,281
Injections, German stuff. Don't listen to the doctor

362
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,252
The pharmacist says this is special. After a month...

363
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,015
of these whoppers, Carmelo will turn into a lion!

364
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:25,183
In a month I'll be in jail

365
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,157
Don't say that

366
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:37,733
"Diseases of the... para... lina... hepati..."

367
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,538
What does that mean?

368
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:53,579
Come here. Better you than somebody else

369
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:02,627
Adelina...

370
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,797
I don't want to go to jail, get it? I won't go!

371
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:14,064
You keep saying you have what it takes. Show me

372
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:17,776
- Now?

373
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,512
- Now!

374
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:23,011
- Here?

375
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:25,646
- Here!

376
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,358
Yes, sweetheart, but where's Carmelo?

377
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:37,089
At Mom's with the kids. Only the babies are here

378
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,762
Come on then

379
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:40,597
Oh my...

380
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:42,702
Leave off!

381
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:44,226
Do anything you like

382
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:47,036
I can't do it! I can't do it!

383
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,641
I want my Carmelo...

384
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:57,444
What the hell? I don't understand you

385
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,879
Do you think I'm a clown? You wanted it and we'll
do it

386
00:34:02,557 --> 00:34:07,085
Shame on you! Fine friend of my husband's!

387
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:09,353
But it was you!

388
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,394
Yes, it was me!

389
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:14,594
Are you crazy?

390
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:17,296
Oh my! Poor little girls...

391
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:30,778
The German stuff

392
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,846
Wake up, Mommy's taking you to jail

393
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:38,525
I'm a fool to love you. I'll go to jail and that's that!

394
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,287
We'll put an end to this farce... Goodbye

395
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:47,227
Keep away, don't touch me!

396
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:50,130
Goodbye, sissy!

397
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:18,030
- Which one's free?
- The first

398
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:20,458
What are you doing? She goes to the maternity
section

399
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:24,229
Why are you taking her away?

400
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,368
- What's your name?
- Nunziatina

401
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,605
Dear Nunziatina...

402
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,745
- Good morning, Mother
- Good morning, girls

403
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:51,888
Here's the pot

404
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,759
- A change of baby clothes
- Thank you

405
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,500
I know you

406
00:35:58,606 --> 00:36:01,097
You're Adelina from Forcella

407
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,775
- And you're Fragulella
- Yes, I'm Fragulella

408
00:36:04,812 --> 00:36:06,336
- And what's your name?
- Assuntina

409
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:07,842
- And you?
- Pizzocca

410
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,505
- What are you in for?
- Fraud

411
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:13,376
- What's your name?
- Earthquake

412
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,250
- What are you in for?
- Abusing the cops!

413
00:36:16,624 --> 00:36:19,593
- And you, Fragulella?
- Prostitution

414
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:22,722
Aren't you going to ask me?

415
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,565
- What's your name?
- Big Tits!

416
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:29,503
- What are you in for?
- Insulting an officer

417
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:30,838
Well done!

418
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:38,071
Come on, eat up. You've had nothing all day

419
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:52,655
- Are they fresh?
- Sure

420
00:36:52,894 --> 00:36:57,126
180 the cookies, plus the sub for Adelina's fine

421
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,196
Hair-cut and shave, 450

422
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,864
I've always paid 350

423
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:02,993
And the sub for the fine?

424
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:11,138
Were you looking for me?

425
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:16,883
Cleopatra, remember the sub for the fine!

426
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,981
Yes, I know

427
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:23,087
Don't bother, I'll pay. Give me the change

428
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,459
Three beers today and two orangeades yesterday

429
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,053
- Thank you
- Thank you, Sergeant!

430
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,393
He's paid the sub for the fine too

431
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,165
That's 40,690 lire. Do you want to count it?

432
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:40,840
Is there any hope of collecting the full amount?

433
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:46,972
40,000 lire only buys an 8-day remission of the jail
term

434
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:49,708
In a week, two weeks at most...

435
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:53,580
I'll bring you, here 2 on this table, 300,000 lire

436
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:55,277
and even more!

437
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:56,251
Are you sure?

438
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:58,823
The people of Forcella are out of this world!

439
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:03,052
They've risen up in a gesture of solidarity

440
00:38:03,497 --> 00:38:07,365
It makes you forget how filthy and ignorant they are

441
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,198
Be quiet, dear sister!

442
00:38:36,464 --> 00:38:37,294
- Sister!

443
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,563
- What is it?

444
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:42,265
But it's not allowed!

445
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:49,608
Mind you're quiet

446
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,773
The things you make me do!

447
00:38:57,551 --> 00:38:58,449
I'm sorry...

448
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:05,620
There she is!

449
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,123
Start singing! Tell her the kids are fine

450
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:11,859
I love her and the petition's been sent off to Rome

451
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,054
Mr Verace is expecting you

452
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:12,949
How are you?

453
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,157
Is it true full amount has been collected?

454
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:18,960
Here it is, it's even more

455
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:22,167
This sum will buy her...

456
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:24,066
A 64-day remission of the jail term

457
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:25,503
The case is closed then?

458
00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:29,134
No, there's the conviction but I've applied for a
pardon

459
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:31,936
- Your name is Verace?
- Domenico Verace

460
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,711
I'm Bianchina Verace, his sister

461
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:40,713
I've applied to the President for a pardon, but it
takes time

462
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:42,751
How long was she sentenced to?

463
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:44,986
Four and a half months

464
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:50,593
The press can do a lot to mobilize public opinion

465
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:56,866
because unless a pardon comes at once, it's no
good

466
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:01,007
I can never do right. Why aren't you pleased?

467
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:05,511
- For a few days off jail?
- Am I the Attorney General?

468
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,941
You're a pig, that's what!

469
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,949
The fine's paid, but who'll serve the rest of the
sentence?

470
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:16,986
I hear they never grant pardons. An amnesty is
different

471
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:20,957
I have to serve the full four 1 months, but you're all
right!

472
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,359
- Oh come on!
- Calm down, young man

473
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:28,858
You don't know what an urge I have, it's killing me!

474
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:30,365
I can't wait for you to get out

475
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:34,870
- I've finished the treatment!
- Oh shut up!

476
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:41,979
That's just talk! When I needed facts, you went to
Mommy

477
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,342
You came over dizzy!

478
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,977
Beat it! A pardon!

479
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:49,180
Some hope! As if they cared about me in Rome!

480
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:50,888
I don't want to see you again!

481
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:02,936
What is it?

482
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:04,864
Good news, Sister!

483
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,774
I'm here, what is it?

484
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:13,304
What's happened?

485
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,914
You've been granted a pardon! You're free!

486
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:24,290
Oh my... I don't believe it... a pardon?

487
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:30,054
The news came last night, but the Governor wanted
to make sure

488
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,822
A pardon!

489
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:34,793
I've been pardoned! I'm free

490
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:40,034
Fragulella, I'm free! Come here...

491
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:43,777
I'm so happy! Don't forget us when you get out

492
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:45,135
Say hello to my mother

493
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:46,077
Come and see me

494
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:53,443
If you want to leave with the first shift, be quick!

495
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:56,882
It's 11, there's so much to do

496
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,863
When's Mom coming out?

497
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:08,360
You heard the lawyer, we have to wait

498
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:10,631
Will they let her out now?

499
00:43:10,904 --> 00:43:11,734
Let's hope so

500
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:18,772
Stop it!

501
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:19,707
Behave yourselves

502
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,008
or they won't let Mom out

503
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:26,877
When you go to jail, will you take me with you?

504
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,025
Mr Verace's waiting in the visitors' room, he says to
hurry

505
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:36,687
She'll be there in five minutes

506
00:43:36,964 --> 00:43:38,989
As soon as we're all dressed!

507
00:43:39,466 --> 00:43:44,870
It's 12 o'clock, will she have time to catch the first
shift?

508
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:47,673
- Stop it!
- There's Mom!

509
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:52,509
Idiot, you made my heart turn over

510
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:54,312
I thought it was her

511
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,315
Isn't this the best day of your life?

512
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:02,621
It sure is

513
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,617
The news took you by surprise?

514
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,750
No, I was ready for it

515
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,418
Were the kids pleased?

516
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:11,422
They were bursting with happiness

517
00:44:11,932 --> 00:44:14,662
Our mother's coming back!

518
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,700
They were singing and dancing

519
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,404
I'm hungry!

520
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,802
I need to piss!

521
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,468
They're too young to understand, poor things

522
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:31,985
How will you show your gratitude to the President?

523
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:35,211
By writing him a letter, from me and my wife

524
00:44:35,322 --> 00:44:36,289
There's Mom!

525
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,289
Stop it or I'll smack you

526
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:49,695
What can I say? I don't know anything

527
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:56,138
Mind the streetcar! Do you want to scare me to
death?

528
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:13,385
Driver, here! The car's ready

529
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,395
Are we going by car?!

530
00:45:16,597 --> 00:45:19,395
Come on children!

531
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:41,982
Guarantee pardon for only one thirthy dollars

532
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:44,080
and the rest when the pardon comes true!

533
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:48,491
No one of you wants a pardon?!

534
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,010
Enrico, come here

535
00:47:20,187 --> 00:47:21,449
Go see who it is

536
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:24,116
Who is it?

537
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:27,624
We're going to the port, the cigarettes have come

538
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:33,226
It's my first day of freedom

539
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,395
and this was my first night. I want to lie in

540
00:47:36,537 --> 00:47:37,868
Yes, stay here

541
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:42,672
I'm taking the day off. See you tomorrow at the
usual place

542
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:48,140
Don't worry, Mr Verace has promised to fix me up

543
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:50,483
- Okay
- Bye!

544
00:48:11,271 --> 00:48:13,296
Hurray for Mr Verace!

545
00:51:02,876 --> 00:51:06,642
Ugh, you can't move even early in the morning...

546
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:12,844
What sweeties! Take it easy, fellas...

547
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:16,848
Why don't they stay home in bed, these workers?

548
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:19,992
At least on Sunday morning

549
00:51:25,565 --> 00:51:30,195
In three days the concert. Two hours of sleep
guaranteed

550
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,235
Thank God, I'm so tired

551
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,370
Tomorrow morning, the Senator's funeral

552
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:44,982
I must put in an appearance

553
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,613
At 10, the Committee meeting

554
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:52,653
Lunch with the in-laws

555
00:51:53,393 --> 00:51:55,486
The Americans in the evening

556
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:58,253
The morning after...

557
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:03,961
Oh yes, Father Astolfi's orphans

558
00:52:04,905 --> 00:52:06,304
Then the hairdresser's

559
00:52:06,573 --> 00:52:09,701
Look in at Titti's, 1 then an hour's workout

560
00:52:09,743 --> 00:52:11,608
Then back to the hairdresser's

561
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:14,439
Then look in at Titti's again

562
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:18,274
Then the prize-giving of those wretched orphans

563
00:52:18,451 --> 00:52:23,718
Enough, enough! Away! A clean break

564
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,851
Definitively

565
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:31,797
Renzo, I can't remember the color of your eyes right
now

566
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:37,093
The darling, with that serious face. He's the best
man I know

567
00:52:37,437 --> 00:52:41,271
So generous, so free so unassuming

568
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:46,202
The darling, with those incredible short socks!

569
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:51,176
There he is

570
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:27,181
- Am I late?
- No, I just got here

571
00:53:30,156 --> 00:53:33,250
- Where shall we go?
- No idea. You decide

572
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,155
It's hot in here. Mind if I open it up?

573
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:37,321
Of course not

574
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:49,765
Were you surprised I called?

575
00:53:50,377 --> 00:53:52,072
No, I was expecting it

576
00:53:52,712 --> 00:53:54,509
I'd have called if you hadn't

577
00:53:56,449 --> 00:54:00,351
If you've time, how about a drive?

578
00:54:00,687 --> 00:54:02,348
I have all the time you want

579
00:54:16,102 --> 00:54:17,194
- Is that your husband?
- Yes

580
00:54:18,204 --> 00:54:19,398
Where is he now?

581
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:22,333
In Stuttgart, for the EEC. He'll be away another week

582
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,237
How does it feel, seeing your name everywhere?

583
00:54:26,646 --> 00:54:28,113
I don't even notice any more

584
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:30,879
Besides, my name is Anna, remember?

585
00:54:31,551 --> 00:54:34,520
You've changed since last night, you hardly know
me

586
00:54:35,088 --> 00:54:38,854
It's just that seeing you arrive took my breath away

587
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,196
Classy, huh?

588
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:02,014
After you took me home last night, I couldn't sleep

589
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:07,251
The things you said to me... I've never felt so
unhappy

590
00:55:07,654 --> 00:55:09,747
- Why?
- Because you're right

591
00:55:10,357 --> 00:55:14,657
I've lived like a puppet, deaf, blind, oblivious...

592
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:17,988
to the rights of others

593
00:55:22,602 --> 00:55:25,196
I realized that while I was dancing with you

594
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:29,636
I felt alive for the first time, in your arms

595
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,652
What's the world coming to!

596
00:55:43,957 --> 00:55:45,288
Let's close the roof

597
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:46,823
Scared someone will see you?

598
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:50,524
I said it for your sake. It could happen

599
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,891
If you're worried about my husband, relax

600
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:54,999
It sounds as if you mind

601
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:57,159
Nobody likes living with an addict

602
00:55:59,906 --> 00:56:00,668
I didn't know

603
00:56:01,307 --> 00:56:04,936
Yes, an addict. Not in the way you think, but it's
worse

604
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:09,011
He's part of the system: work, success, money

605
00:56:09,716 --> 00:56:11,513
Money, success, work

606
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,509
You can't stop him

607
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:18,054
And nothing else exists

608
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,325
And are you different?

609
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,767
Yes, you made me realize that. Thank you, Renzo

610
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:38,173
I think I talked a lot of nonsense last night

611
00:56:42,348 --> 00:56:44,543
Why, what's changed?

612
00:56:45,585 --> 00:56:47,314
How many millions do you have?

613
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:51,781
What does that have to do with it?

614
00:56:52,258 --> 00:56:54,385
- A lot
- You're being mean

615
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:26,586
Slow down!

616
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,326
Would you like to drive? Go on!

617
00:57:30,163 --> 00:57:33,257
No, I don't know these cars. My limit is a Fiat 600

618
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,195
But this one's easy

619
00:57:35,468 --> 00:57:39,131
- No, better not
- Come on, change over

620
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:52,483
It's perfect, you'll see. Does 120 like nothing

621
00:57:52,652 --> 00:57:54,984
And it's just been serviced

622
00:57:59,759 --> 00:58:01,090
The key's there

623
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:13,405
Where's the indicator? Ah, here it is

624
00:58:14,608 --> 00:58:15,472
A bit of music?

625
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:29,117
Well, Renzo?

626
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:33,650
Anna, I like you a lot

627
00:58:35,328 --> 00:58:36,818
But you don't think I'm sincere

628
00:58:37,897 --> 00:58:40,559
I don't know... I don't know

629
00:58:42,002 --> 00:58:43,560
Look, we're low on gas

630
00:58:44,037 --> 00:58:46,198
That's the heat. I filled up this morning

631
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,768
- How much does it hold?
- 20 gallons, I guess

632
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:52,269
Enough to take mine around the world

633
00:58:52,412 --> 00:58:54,505
Do you like traveling too?

634
00:58:54,648 --> 00:58:57,208
The minute I can, I go far away from everything

635
00:58:58,251 --> 00:59:00,947
I'm so tired of my world, the people I know

636
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:04,554
There's an oasis near Marrakesh, it's divine!

637
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:07,458
You live on sun and fruit, lots of fruit

638
00:59:07,994 --> 00:59:09,655
- 1,200,000
- What?

639
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:11,754
The return fare

640
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:14,095
- Oh, Renzo, stop it!
- It's the truth

641
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:17,797
The truth is you keep turning the conversation to
money!

642
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,500
You know what I make a month?

643
00:59:20,607 --> 00:59:23,940
I don't want to know! Don't you understand?

644
00:59:24,244 --> 00:59:27,338
I like you because you're not like the robots I know

645
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:29,278
busy making money all day

646
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,417
You write, you're intelligent. I never think about
money

647
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:35,512
- I swear I don't
- Because you have it

648
00:59:35,689 --> 00:59:37,680
So, should I throw it away?

649
00:59:37,757 --> 00:59:42,558
Yes, everything: money, cars, those Cleopatra
bracelets

650
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,896
I got these at the hardware store

651
00:59:45,265 --> 00:59:47,426
Did you get this monument at the hardware store
too?

652
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:51,726
But that's not it. The fact is you have money in you

653
00:59:53,073 --> 00:59:57,271
In me there's only emptiness... a big emptiness

654
01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:26,831
I thought you could have helped me

655
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,341
Where do you want to go?

656
01:00:29,075 --> 01:00:30,201
We could go to my place

657
01:00:31,578 --> 01:00:34,240
My villa's near here. There's a lake too

658
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:36,913
- How big is the lake?
- Small

659
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:39,080
My husband had it made to fish trout

660
01:00:39,486 --> 01:00:42,216
- We'll go to the River Po
- Lovely! What is there?

661
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:45,617
Mosquitoes, one thing your husband didn't make

662
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,492
Sorry...

663
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:57,099
Let's go anywhere, wherever you like

664
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,198
As long as there's a bit of peace and quiet

665
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,808
There, look! That's fine

666
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,239
How wonderful!

667
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,883
"Our jazz program continues..."

668
01:01:26,699 --> 01:01:29,395
In a few days this lovely October will be over too

669
01:01:52,826 --> 01:01:54,453
Not here, please. Let's go away

670
01:02:15,715 --> 01:02:16,579
God!

671
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:23,552
You like me, I can tell

672
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:28,723
If you hadn't called me, who would you have called?

673
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,897
Nobody... I'm alone

674
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:36,291
With all the people you know?

675
01:02:37,604 --> 01:02:39,902
With all the people I know

676
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,941
I can't tell which are your fingers and which are
mine

677
01:02:50,483 --> 01:02:52,576
This is so lovely, unbelievable...

678
01:02:53,653 --> 01:02:54,347
Help me

679
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:57,254
Let's go far away, to the sun. To Rome, Naples

680
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:01,051
Yes, let's go

681
01:03:06,566 --> 01:03:09,433
We'll arrive at night, in the lamplight

682
01:03:10,003 --> 01:03:11,561
The still, silky water...

683
01:03:12,372 --> 01:03:17,207
We'll ride in a trap and find a nice small place, just
for us

684
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,674
The dark sky full of stars...

685
01:03:20,246 --> 01:03:22,942
And music, lots of music in the air

686
01:03:23,283 --> 01:03:25,615
under our windows

687
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:30,589
Tomorrow we'll wake up late, as the sun creeps onto
the bed...

688
01:03:30,623 --> 01:03:35,959
You'll take me in your arms, you'll hold me tight...

689
01:03:42,268 --> 01:03:45,396
- Anna, are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing

690
01:03:48,608 --> 01:03:49,973
We're on fire!

691
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:54,810
The car!

692
01:03:59,652 --> 01:04:01,517
My God, what have you done?

693
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:03,522
I had to put the brakes on...

694
01:04:03,823 --> 01:04:04,983
Something's burning!

695
01:04:06,459 --> 01:04:08,120
The tire's burning!

696
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:11,955
Do something, you fool! The car's on fire!

697
01:04:12,065 --> 01:04:14,192
Find something to put it out!

698
01:04:14,968 --> 01:04:16,902
How could anybody be so dumb!

699
01:04:18,171 --> 01:04:21,470
Are you crazy, with my fur? Use your jacket!

700
01:04:22,642 --> 01:04:28,603
God, the whole thing's going to blow up. Get the
jack!

701
01:04:33,353 --> 01:04:35,378
- What are you doing?
- I can't open it!

702
01:04:35,488 --> 01:04:36,455
Jesus Christ!

703
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:49,364
The jack! Surely you know what a jack is!

704
01:04:50,036 --> 01:04:52,402
You must have rammed on the brakes like a brute

705
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:56,832
These cars are delicate, they're jewels!

706
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:01,336
And you stamp on the brake like it was a truck!

707
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,473
- But I could have killed him!
- Who cares!

708
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,192
Now what are you doing?

709
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:46,250
Would you mind giving me a hand? I'm in trouble

710
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:48,657
I think it's serious

711
01:05:48,728 --> 01:05:51,094
If I can be of any help. What's wrong?

712
01:05:51,464 --> 01:05:54,991
I don't know, please come and take a look

713
01:05:55,301 --> 01:05:55,892
What happened?

714
01:05:56,569 --> 01:06:02,098
We were speeding and we suddenly had
to brake hard to swerve

715
01:06:02,608 --> 01:06:05,099
It's jammed, I don't know what to do

716
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,805
- It's a Rolls
- Yes, the latest model

717
01:06:07,914 --> 01:06:10,747
- Are you happy with it?
- Yes, no problem until now

718
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:12,511
That's quite a bump. Were you driving?

719
01:06:15,421 --> 01:06:19,755
It was all so sudden. The car swerved and went off
the road

720
01:06:20,126 --> 01:06:22,094
Strange, these cars are perfect

721
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:27,359
I was a fool to let a Fiat-600 driver handle it

722
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:30,432
- A colossal mistake
- You're quite right

723
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,301
- Would you like me to help?
- Goodness no

724
01:06:38,377 --> 01:06:41,642
You see, these cars with the rim-braking system...

725
01:06:41,681 --> 01:06:44,616
I prefer disc brakes, they're better

726
01:06:44,717 --> 01:06:47,845
It's not the brakes, it's knowing how to drive the car

727
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:51,918
Even the Divine Comedy in illiterate hands...

728
01:06:56,662 --> 01:06:57,629
Let's hope for the best

729
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:03,099
Don't worry, the damage can easily be fixed

730
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,128
Haven't we met before?

731
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:07,139
You look familiar too

732
01:07:07,874 --> 01:07:12,243
I guess we met in Casorate, with my husband, at the
Martin's

733
01:07:12,645 --> 01:07:14,135
Is your husband in Milan?

734
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:17,572
No, he's in Stuttgart on EEC business

735
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:21,178
He'll be away a week. Thank God, with this disaster

736
01:07:32,198 --> 01:07:34,166
You'd better call a mechanic

737
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:37,665
Definitely, that one is absolutely hopeless

738
01:07:37,937 --> 01:07:40,235
I can turn around and drive you home

739
01:07:40,273 --> 01:07:43,504
- I'm Giorgio Carate
- Pleased to meet you

740
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,105
I'm going home. This gentleman's taking me

741
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,739
We'll send a mechanic

742
01:07:52,685 --> 01:07:55,210
Keep an eye on it, do me a favor. Thanks!

- Don't shout!

You can call me uncle

it?

You'll sing me a lullaby and I'll fall asleep in your
arms

Hello? Yes, Dad, it's me

789
01:15:09,488 --> 01:15:10,682
Yes, I went

790
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:13,657
No, the permit's not ready

791
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:22,299
Yes, I went to see the Under Secretary

792

You'll see, I'll settle it tonight. It only needs

But I'm not an idiot!

I won't let you go!

Look at you, there isn't one thing wrong with you

Make a face or I can't go

No, don't make faces, it turns me on even more!

01:16:07,579 --> 01:16:10,104
At Anagni, but the head-office is in Lombardy.

800
01:16:10,683 --> 01:16:12,446
- How many hours do you study?
- 12

801
01:16:12,685 --> 01:16:13,583
My-oh-my!

802
01:16:14,053 --> 01:16:17,545
Five hours of meditation and prayer, seven of study

803
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:19,157
When do you get time off?

804
01:16:19,758 --> 01:16:23,319
Recreation after lunch, and an hour in the evening

805
01:16:23,595 --> 01:16:27,087
My nephew's with the friars. They say the rosary at
midnight

806
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,566
The Capuchins have that rule

807
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:34,369
No, thank you

808
01:16:34,773 --> 01:16:38,265
Aren't you allowed to? I saw a bishop with a pipe
once

809
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,076
It's forbidden at college

810
01:16:49,621 --> 01:16:51,521
You give me the urge to come to confession

811
01:16:52,257 --> 01:16:53,656
in this lovely moonlight

812
01:16:53,726 --> 01:16:56,593
I couldn't hear it, I'm not a priest yet

813
01:16:56,628 --> 01:16:58,528
I take my vows in two years

814
01:16:58,864 --> 01:16:59,831
You're dressed like a priest

815
01:17:00,065 --> 01:17:01,259
But I'm not

816
01:17:10,275 --> 01:17:13,767
I love black, I wear it on top and underneath...

817
01:17:20,853 --> 01:17:26,519
When the Council's over, will priests be allowed... to
marry?

818
01:17:26,992 --> 01:17:28,323
I don't think so

819
01:17:29,461 --> 01:17:31,554
American priests have children

820
01:17:31,697 --> 01:17:33,164
But I don't like that

821
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:35,432
Priests should be like the moon:

822
01:17:35,467 --> 01:17:36,900
nobody knows what it is

823
01:17:37,169 --> 01:17:39,660
They're men with a religious vocation

824
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:43,564
My nephew's vocation was beaten into him by his
mother!

825
01:17:43,609 --> 01:17:44,507
You like it?

826
01:17:44,943 --> 01:17:47,468
Yes, but I'm free decide for myself

827
01:17:48,113 --> 01:17:52,015
There's plenty of time before my vows. I'll pray to
my saint

828
01:17:52,484 --> 01:17:54,315
- Who's that?
- Saint John

829
01:17:54,653 --> 01:17:56,883
I have one nobody knows. Saint Maurillo

830
01:17:57,189 --> 01:17:58,679
- Do you know him?
- No

831
01:18:00,559 --> 01:18:03,494
I need one who doesn't get pestered, who has time
for me

832
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,400
I ask him to let me make lots of money

833
01:18:08,534 --> 01:18:13,972
- Does he answer you?
- Pretty well

834
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:18,937
But... I don't like my job

835
01:18:19,678 --> 01:18:22,909
- What do you do?
- Manicurist

836
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:30,345
But I pick my clients, respectable people who pay
well

837
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,216
I want to buy my father some land

838
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:37,590
The hands I've seen! I can judge people by them

839
01:18:38,063 --> 01:18:39,428
Let me see yours

840
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:44,033
You're level-headed and you like sport

841
01:18:44,336 --> 01:18:45,826
I used to playinside right...

842
01:18:46,405 --> 01:18:48,305
There's a great destiny here

843
01:18:49,274 --> 01:18:52,072
- I can tell you're kind
- How can you tell?

844
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:54,543
By everything

845
01:18:56,081 --> 01:19:00,814
You're predestined! My, how straight that line is!

846
01:19:01,253 --> 01:19:02,743
You can ask anything of life

847
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:04,852
I'd like to go out with you

848
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,427
Yes, arm-in-arm!

849
01:19:10,796 --> 01:19:13,458
Think of the neighbors, think of your grandmother!

850
01:19:15,133 --> 01:19:16,430
And dressed like a priest!

851
01:19:16,568 --> 01:19:19,628
But I have a suit. It's a bit old...

852
01:19:20,072 --> 01:19:21,164
We'll go to the sea

853
01:19:21,406 --> 01:19:26,708
I'd like that, now that it's not so crowded

854
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:30,511
We'll stay there all day, I'll bring some sandwiches

855
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,081
We'll see... we'll see

856
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:39,179
Oh pussy! Come here...

857
01:19:40,759 --> 01:19:44,024
I ought to leave tomorrow, but I can be a day late

858
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:45,392
When will you be back?

859
01:19:45,831 --> 01:19:48,664
At Christmas, to see my grandparents

860
01:19:51,837 --> 01:19:53,862
I'll think it over tonight about going to the sea

861
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,304
I wonder who he belongs to? He often comes to see
me

862
01:20:16,461 --> 01:20:17,689
It was so nice here

863
01:20:17,963 --> 01:20:19,191
I'll wait for you

864
01:20:19,765 --> 01:20:23,132
This one will be here for some time

865
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:26,133
He's come from Bologna on business

866
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:28,335
I'll wait here until dawn

867
01:20:32,177 --> 01:20:33,439
Take the cat

868
01:20:38,483 --> 01:20:40,678
- Bye!
- Good night

869
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,148
Why aren't you in bed yet?

870
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:45,513
I'm going, Gran! Excuse me...

871
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,996
- Good evening, ma'am
- I don't know you

872
01:20:56,702 --> 01:20:57,794
You know me now

873
01:20:57,970 --> 01:21:00,700
I don't know you, nor does my grandson

874
01:21:02,007 --> 01:21:03,497
Umberto, go to bed!

875
01:21:04,376 --> 01:21:05,570
Good night, Miss

876
01:21:05,644 --> 01:21:07,703
I'll have a wall built here

877
01:21:08,146 --> 01:21:10,444
Thank goodness he's leaving tomorrow

878
01:21:10,515 --> 01:21:14,007
I won't leave unless you apologize to the young
lady!

879
01:21:14,252 --> 01:21:15,514
Over my dead body!

880
01:21:15,854 --> 01:21:18,448
- I'm sorry, Miss
- Don't mention it

881
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:21,058
Leave the boy alone

882
01:21:21,593 --> 01:21:24,426
He's not like the men who come to your house

883
01:21:24,863 --> 01:21:26,558
This boy's a saint!

884
01:21:26,665 --> 01:21:28,929
Only respectable people come to my house!

885
01:21:29,901 --> 01:21:33,462
The one at the door now is Cavaliere Rusconi's son!

886
01:21:33,705 --> 01:21:34,569
A fine thing!

887
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,537
Government deputies come to my house too!

888
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:39,974
And Tommasi, the pasta producer

889
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:42,271
I see you eat Tommasi pasta

890
01:21:43,682 --> 01:21:44,842
I won't any more

891
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:49,384
Tomorrow I'll send a petition around, everybody will
sign it

892
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:54,422
You'll leave the building. We're tired of this coming
and going

893
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:59,097
You're a scandal. Yesterday I counted four men!

894
01:21:59,231 --> 01:22:01,756
Do you want to put a meter on me?

895
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:07,861
Three yes and four no? My client are quiet,
well-behaved people

896
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:12,841
You'll go to hell, mark my words. Shame on you, I'll
report you!

897
01:22:13,045 --> 01:22:15,639
Stop it, Gran! You're an old goose!

898
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:24,417
You... old... witch! What does she want from me?

899
01:22:25,123 --> 01:22:26,818
Vincenzo! Come away!

900
01:22:27,993 --> 01:22:29,790
Her and that other old goat!

901
01:22:30,062 --> 01:22:33,088
She'll report me, she'll send me to hell. Jesus!

902
01:22:33,598 --> 01:22:34,565
Listen to this one

903
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:38,228
All right! All right! I heard you!

904
01:22:38,837 --> 01:22:41,431
At last! I was starting to worry

905
01:22:41,506 --> 01:22:42,700
Why ring like that?

906
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:44,502
- Gorgeous!
- Oh come in

907
01:22:44,643 --> 01:22:46,508
I thought there'd been a gas leak

908
01:22:47,746 --> 01:22:49,976
Pussy... Is he new?

909
01:22:50,148 --> 01:22:54,107
I'll show that old witch. I'll fix that boy, you'll see!

910
01:22:54,419 --> 01:22:56,011
What boy? What old witch?

911
01:22:56,154 --> 01:22:58,918
Next-door. She hates me talking to her grandson!

912
01:22:59,024 --> 01:23:02,016
It's crazy! As if I'd go with a priest!

913
01:23:03,095 --> 01:23:04,528
He isn't even 18

914
01:23:04,796 --> 01:23:08,732
We're talking about God and she yells I'll go to hell

915
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,367
She's given me a headache

916
01:23:10,502 --> 01:23:14,598
Take no notice of her: do no evil, fear no evil

917
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,104
She says she'll tell my landlady

918
01:23:17,175 --> 01:23:21,271
Landladies are sympathetic, they just put the rent
up

919
01:23:21,346 --> 01:23:23,246
I know, as if I didn't pay enough!

920
01:23:23,648 --> 01:23:26,344
But I'll make Granny sorry!

921
01:23:26,618 --> 01:23:28,449
You have to understand

922
01:23:28,887 --> 01:23:31,549
Come here, come to Uncle

923
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,820
As if I felt like making love!

924
01:23:34,993 --> 01:23:38,759
Come on, Mara. We'll go to bed and cuddle up
together

925
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:40,765
Like good children. We won't even talk

926
01:23:40,832 --> 01:23:43,892
- I need to talk!
- Okay, but in bed

927
01:23:44,002 --> 01:23:46,197
I'm too mad, I'd be like a stone

928
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:49,597
Be honest, am I a scandal? Do I do it on the terrace?

929
01:23:49,674 --> 01:23:51,369
I'm willing to go out on the terrace.

930
01:23:51,409 --> 01:23:54,207
Like Nero looking at Rome

931
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:58,181
Don't I always ask everybody... not to shout?

932
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:01,080
To talk quietly? When you yell you sound like a
donkey

933
01:24:01,153 --> 01:24:02,450
Because I'm different

934
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:08,755
I love you, I think you're perfect.
Do you love me?

935
01:24:09,161 --> 01:24:11,288
- Here...
- I love you

936
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:14,460
- Let's run away together
- Who's chasing us?

937
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:19,798
I don't like you going with other men, I'm jealous

938
01:24:20,005 --> 01:24:21,097
Marry me then

939
01:24:21,339 --> 01:24:25,366
What for? Why don't you come to Bologna for a
month?

940
01:24:25,544 --> 01:24:29,173
I won't budge from here. The old witch would love
that

941
01:24:29,915 --> 01:24:33,976
In fact I'll buy this apartment she'll be stuck with me
forever

942
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,929
Let's do it here, it would be heavenly

943
01:24:45,964 --> 01:24:48,592
We'll turn the lights out and open the refrigerator

944
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:51,731
Look what a nice cosy light

945
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:54,603
I'll write her a letter, I want to let off steam

946
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:56,732
I saw a terrific show in Paris

947
01:24:56,775 --> 01:24:59,710
Black striptease! We need music

948
01:25:10,088 --> 01:25:13,216
This is scented. I'm not sending her scented paper

949
01:25:13,592 --> 01:25:17,619
- Let's turn the lights out
- I've got to write

950
01:25:17,729 --> 01:25:18,661
Just for a minute

951
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,263
Will you correct if for me?

952
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:27,027
I don't want her to find any mistakes

953
01:25:27,105 --> 01:25:27,867
Sure

954
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,657
The woman's shapely leg slowly comes into the
light...

955
01:25:46,925 --> 01:25:47,823
What's he up to?

956
01:25:47,926 --> 01:25:53,592
The light creeps up slowly...

957
01:25:53,865 --> 01:25:56,800
very very slowly...

958
01:25:57,936 --> 01:26:00,496
It takes your breath away. I was really turned on...

959
01:26:00,772 --> 01:26:02,706
They have time to waste!

960
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,470
Turn the light on!

961
01:26:26,798 --> 01:26:28,197
Umberto!

962
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:35,897
You won't see me again! You treat me like a
doormat!

963
01:26:36,408 --> 01:26:39,571
You're not the only woman around, I can find any
number

964
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:41,235
Sit down and be good

965
01:26:41,313 --> 01:26:43,372
You think I'm a slave to sex

966
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,840
but I have a soul too, remember that

967
01:26:46,184 --> 01:26:49,847
Look, there's only a hair between a devil and a saint!

968
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:54,486
My life's about to change. I'm going home to find a
wife

969
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:56,687
Sure, you must get married

970
01:26:57,562 --> 01:26:59,894
Dear Madam...

971
01:27:00,932 --> 01:27:02,763
"Dear"?!

972
01:27:04,502 --> 01:27:06,367
My father may call,

973
01:27:06,404 --> 01:27:08,770
I left him your number in case it was urgent

974
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,866
Fake a man's voice and say I'm out

975
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:12,677
Goodbye

976
01:27:55,153 --> 01:27:58,816
I said I'm sorry. Do you want to hit me over the
head?

977
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:02,551
This isn't a hotel, you know. Get up, I have to go
shopping

978
01:28:02,761 --> 01:28:05,423
Mara, last night I came to Piazza Navona

979
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,560
I sat on a bench and looked up at your window

980
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:12,795
Then I couldn't hold out any longer and I went with
a...

981
01:28:13,071 --> 01:28:14,663
- Whore
- Yes

982
01:28:15,573 --> 01:28:16,972
Can't you miss even one day?

983
01:28:17,108 --> 01:28:19,201
We didn't do anything, I swear

984
01:28:19,444 --> 01:28:21,275
I suddenly felt something inside

985
01:28:21,312 --> 01:28:22,677
and I shouted to her, go away!

986
01:28:22,914 --> 01:28:25,906
- She started insulting me
- She was right

987
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:28,048
But I paid her anyway!

988
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:32,379
They have their self-respect too, you have to
understand

989
01:28:34,492 --> 01:28:35,459
Come on, get up

990
01:28:35,827 --> 01:28:36,691
Thank you

991
01:28:38,596 --> 01:28:40,723
Couldn't you put a carpet down here?

992
01:28:41,032 --> 01:28:44,399
A soft red runner... I'll buy one for you

993
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:51,641
Listen, I have an hour before I see the Under
Secretary

994
01:28:51,943 --> 01:28:54,810
We've never been together in the morning

995
01:28:56,181 --> 01:28:58,376
Just for an hour, okay?

996
01:29:01,653 --> 01:29:02,950
Oh all right

997
01:29:03,021 --> 01:29:06,889
- Don't undo it!
- Ouiet, the old witch will hear!

998
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:08,184
You give me a bad name

999
01:29:08,226 --> 01:29:10,194
- I want to undress you
- Be quiet!

1000
01:29:11,896 --> 01:29:15,127
You're a vision! You know what I'd like?

1001
01:29:15,467 --> 01:29:18,265
To see you in a fur coat, nude, in the sunshine

1002
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,099
Are you nuts, in this heat?

1003
01:29:25,009 --> 01:29:28,911
Hello? Oh, Vani from Venice!

1004
01:29:29,547 --> 01:29:32,710
Sure I remember. Short, with a moustache. The bass
player

1005
01:29:32,917 --> 01:29:35,750
You're the bass player, right? I remember

1006
01:29:36,187 --> 01:29:39,918
Try tomorrow. Sure I'll give you a grade, I promised

1007
01:29:41,893 --> 01:29:43,952
Come on, you beautiful doll

1008
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:48,793
I'll set my family against the old witch, there's seven
of us

1009
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:49,925
Eight with me, darling

1010
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:56,463
- Are you going to be all day?
- It's hard and I'm shaking

1011
01:29:57,609 --> 01:29:58,974
Let me see if they're up

1012
01:30:03,047 --> 01:30:05,777
Hey, look at that!

1013
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,445
He's taken his cassock off. The old witch will be
furious

1014
01:30:09,254 --> 01:30:13,054
The boy's got character. Come and look

1015
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,356
Well done!

1016
01:30:26,304 --> 01:30:26,963
Hi!

1017
01:30:29,807 --> 01:30:30,831
I'll shoot him!

1018
01:30:50,228 --> 01:30:53,595
Please, it turns me off if you laugh. This is serious

1019
01:30:53,965 --> 01:30:55,489
The best thing in the world

1020
01:31:03,274 --> 01:31:05,742
- You're not in!
- I'll take a peep

1021
01:31:23,628 --> 01:31:25,755
- It's Gran!
- Don't open it!

1022
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:28,089
She looks out of her mind!

1023
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:29,598
I'll go

1024
01:31:43,481 --> 01:31:45,813
- Who is it?
- Open the door!

1025
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:49,149
- But who is it?
- Giovanna Villenzone

1026
01:31:49,187 --> 01:31:52,156
- Never heard of her
- Umberto's grandmother

1027
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:09,431
Well?

1028
01:32:09,741 --> 01:32:13,233
I want to speak to you... just for a minute

1029
01:32:15,046 --> 01:32:16,411
I must speak to you

1030
01:32:17,448 --> 01:32:18,938
It's too early for visitors

1031
01:32:32,563 --> 01:32:35,396
Come in, ma'am

1032
01:32:39,837 --> 01:32:41,134
What is it?

1033
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:46,042
- It's all over!
- Don't cry

1034
01:32:46,377 --> 01:32:50,211
You've ruined me, you've ruined my family

1035
01:32:50,882 --> 01:32:53,180
If you stop crying we can put everything right

1036
01:32:53,851 --> 01:32:55,079
Please stop crying, ma'am.

1037
01:32:56,487 --> 01:33:02,289
He was an angel, respectful, obedient, and he's lost
his head

1038
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:04,655
Calm down, we'll fix it

1039
01:33:04,796 --> 01:33:09,256
It's too late. He's put brilliantine on his hair

1040
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,900
He took his cassock off... it's time to put a stop on
it!

1041
01:33:14,105 --> 01:33:15,402
...where's the window?!?

1042
01:33:15,473 --> 01:33:17,998
Please calm down, ma'am

1043
01:33:22,747 --> 01:33:23,645
Calm down

1044
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,412
- Mr Rusconi
- Pleased to meet you

1045
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:30,287
Do you know Umberto studied all the time?

1046
01:33:30,488 --> 01:33:34,424
He even read at night. You know he could have
become Pope?

1047
01:33:34,792 --> 01:33:37,158
He will, he will

1048
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:41,528
Come into the parlor, ma'am

1049
01:33:44,969 --> 01:33:46,994
- Thank you
- Don't mention it

1050
01:33:50,174 --> 01:33:52,074
Give the lady a Fernet

1051
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:54,535
Or would you prefer something sweet?

1052
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:58,504
I have Strega, aniseed... whatever you like

1053
01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:01,876
He refuses to go back to the seminary

1054
01:34:02,253 --> 01:34:04,483
We'll make him go back, I'll see to it

1055
01:34:04,622 --> 01:34:07,284
He says you're a saint and I'm a witch

1056
01:34:07,959 --> 01:34:10,587
You can go now, Rusconi. Granny's feeling better

1057
01:34:10,762 --> 01:34:13,390
Wait for me in the other room. Use the phone if you
like

1058
01:34:14,932 --> 01:34:16,593
- Did I disturb you?
- No

1059
01:34:16,701 --> 01:34:18,999
The gentleman's very kind. He's from Emilia

1060
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:21,634
- I have relations there
- That's nice

1061
01:34:24,876 --> 01:34:29,210
Listen, you may tell your grandson whatever you
like

1062
01:34:29,881 --> 01:34:30,973
By all means tell him the truth

1063
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:33,410
I have, but he doesn't believe me

1064
01:34:33,651 --> 01:34:38,714
- Keep trying
- Thank you. Umberto's parents

1065
01:34:38,956 --> 01:34:44,656
have such great hopes in him.
My daughter has a weak heart.

1066
01:34:45,229 --> 01:34:47,254
You know what a son means

1067
01:34:50,401 --> 01:34:52,892
- But I want a son too
- Good girl

1068
01:34:53,671 --> 01:34:57,402
First I have to put some money by, for his security

1069
01:35:00,511 --> 01:35:05,778
You know what? I'll make a vow, they always work
for me

1070
01:35:06,317 --> 01:35:10,947
If Umberto goes back to the seminary, I'll go a week
without

1071
01:35:12,256 --> 01:35:13,314
You know what

1072
01:35:13,658 --> 01:35:16,024
That's very generous of you

1073
01:35:16,427 --> 01:35:18,452
A week! And when I say something, I mean it

1074
01:35:18,763 --> 01:35:22,961
I'll buy some candles and keep them lit day and
night

1075
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:26,735
You'll go straight to heaven, ma' am

1076
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:29,599
- It's a sacrifice for me
- I can imagine

1077
01:35:30,074 --> 01:35:31,200
But I'll do it gladly

1078
01:35:32,109 --> 01:35:35,101
I'll lose about... 200,000 lire

1079
01:35:35,847 --> 01:35:38,315
Goodness, you earn that much?

1080
01:35:39,584 --> 01:35:43,042
I could make more if I wanted, but I only see who I
like

1081
01:35:43,421 --> 01:35:44,479
You're right

1082
01:36:00,371 --> 01:36:04,205
Who's speaking? Yes, this is Miss Mara's home

1083
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:08,277
No, she's gone away. She'll be back at Christmas

1084
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:27,693
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1085
01:36:28,332 --> 01:36:31,824
- Who was it?
- A Sicilian... see soon.

1086
01:36:32,103 --> 01:36:35,800
No, come and talk to the lady. Like a Strega?

1087
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:37,237
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back

1088
01:36:37,508 --> 01:36:39,100
Sorry I interrupted you

1089
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:40,206
Don't mention it

1090
01:36:40,311 --> 01:36:41,642
This girl is an angel

1091
01:36:41,913 --> 01:36:44,575
Yes, she's good. See you later

1092
01:36:44,649 --> 01:36:47,243
No. Pour the lady another drink

1093
01:36:47,618 --> 01:36:49,950
Goodness no, my head's going round

1094
01:36:51,856 --> 01:36:55,223
You know I never had any grandparents?

1095
01:36:55,927 --> 01:36:56,655
Strange

1096
01:36:57,161 --> 01:37:00,289
I wish I'd had a granny like you. And you?

1097
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:02,423
I have three grandparents

1098
01:37:02,934 --> 01:37:03,992
No!

1099
01:37:04,335 --> 01:37:05,927
Yes. Goodbye

1100
01:37:06,103 --> 01:37:08,298
I'm glad I met you

1101
01:37:09,006 --> 01:37:09,995
So am I

1102
01:37:12,677 --> 01:37:14,144
Don't slam the door!

1103
01:37:17,181 --> 01:37:18,011
Where were you born?

1104
01:37:18,282 --> 01:37:19,909
We're all from Lucania

1105
01:37:20,151 --> 01:37:22,346
I'm from Anticoli... Anticoli Romano

1106
01:37:31,996 --> 01:37:33,190
Can I help you?

1107
01:37:34,465 --> 01:37:36,695
Yes, look, I'd like six of these nice candles

1108
01:37:58,055 --> 01:37:59,454
Hey, what are you doing there?

1109
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:02,826
Come in!

1110
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:07,854
- How much?
- 1,800 lire

1111
01:38:08,766 --> 01:38:10,063
- Any discount?
- No

1112
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:20,509
- Where have you sprung from?
- I was just passing

1113
01:38:22,179 --> 01:38:23,237
Can I buy you a present?

1114
01:38:27,752 --> 01:38:29,185
This would suit you

1115
01:38:29,587 --> 01:38:31,953
How much is this?

1116
01:38:32,056 --> 01:38:33,182
18,000 lire

1117
01:38:35,693 --> 01:38:36,557
What do I do with it?

1118
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:39,022
What a question! Keep it as a memento

1119
01:38:39,897 --> 01:38:41,489
Wear it when you're a priest

1120
01:38:42,633 --> 01:38:44,328
You're in league with Gran

1121
01:38:45,302 --> 01:38:47,065
She's an angel, leave her out of it

1122
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,434
Pay at the desk

1123
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:55,704
Last night I had a vision... Saint Maurillo

1124
01:38:57,882 --> 01:39:01,283
What were you thinking of?
You know I could be your mother?

1125
01:39:02,753 --> 01:39:05,347
Come on, try this on

1126
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,852
This would really suit you!

1127
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:11,893
You weren't born for those clothes

1128
01:39:13,064 --> 01:39:16,363
I fell for an officer once, his uniform really turned
me on

1129
01:39:16,567 --> 01:39:17,761
When he put on civilian clothes

1130
01:39:17,802 --> 01:39:20,498
he looked like a plucked chicken

1131
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:03,145
Must you put them there?

1132
01:40:03,347 --> 01:40:07,113
Don't you have any faith? You know who they're
for?

1133
01:40:07,151 --> 01:40:08,448
Sure

1134
01:40:10,888 --> 01:40:12,981
Better put them out now though

1135
01:40:14,058 --> 01:40:15,116
You're right

1136
01:40:17,161 --> 01:40:18,856
- Do you have any Coca Cola?
- Yes

1137
01:40:18,896 --> 01:40:20,329
- And eggs?
- Yes

1138
01:40:20,364 --> 01:40:22,457
- What day is it today?
- Thursday

1139
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:25,060
We'll surface on Saturday, we'll stay put till them

1140
01:40:28,706 --> 01:40:29,365
The phone!

1141
01:40:32,676 --> 01:40:33,836
My father's due to call

1142
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,742
- What is it?
- The blinds!

1143
01:40:41,185 --> 01:40:41,981
Ma'am!

1144
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:45,953
- Who is it? Gran?
- No, the wind

1145
01:40:46,223 --> 01:40:47,383
Out of the way

1146
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:56,490
He wants to join the Foreign Legion. He's packing!

1147
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:59,191
We must stop him, he's gone mad!

1148
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:02,571
I'm coming... Rusconi! Come here!

1149
01:41:03,174 --> 01:41:04,641
Help me climb over

1150
01:41:10,581 --> 01:41:11,673
Come on!

1151
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:17,311
- Give it to me!
- No

1152
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:20,422
Let me be! Naughty boy!

1153
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:25,788
What are you up to?

1154
01:41:25,863 --> 01:41:28,889
Tell him I'm not a liar, that I told him the truth

1155
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:30,599
Your gran told the truth

1156
01:41:32,536 --> 01:41:33,594
The whole truth

1157
01:41:34,872 --> 01:41:39,571
Why do you want to make me feel guilty?
I never have before

1158
01:41:45,082 --> 01:41:49,985
The seminary is a secure life. Food, a bed, and you're
out...

1159
01:41:50,454 --> 01:41:54,049
of this wicked world! I'd be a nun if I had another
life

1160
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,260
Give me the case!

1161
01:41:59,763 --> 01:42:02,027
You're hurting, Umberto!

1162
01:42:03,734 --> 01:42:05,224
I want to go away!

1163
01:42:13,577 --> 01:42:16,171
Rusconi! Come on out!

1164
01:42:18,282 --> 01:42:19,544
Don't just stand there, come on!

1165
01:42:20,484 --> 01:42:21,212
Come on, hurry!

1166
01:42:33,197 --> 01:42:35,256
What are you up to, boy?

1167
01:42:36,166 --> 01:42:38,464
Give me that case! Come on!

1168
01:42:45,075 --> 01:42:45,973
Mr Rusconi...

1169
01:42:46,644 --> 01:42:48,373
- Villenzone
- Pleased to meet you

1170
01:42:48,746 --> 01:42:50,008
- Sit down
- Thank you

1171
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:53,811
You tell him that I wasn't lying

1172
01:42:54,018 --> 01:42:58,853
That nobody should be trousted except parents and
grandparents

1173
01:42:59,223 --> 01:43:03,125
Is it true you make more than a million a month?

1174
01:43:04,328 --> 01:43:05,659
It's true

1175
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:10,789
Hear that? He wouldn't believe me, he said I made it
up

1176
01:43:12,336 --> 01:43:16,830
But keep it to yourself or the tax-man will hear
about it

1177
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:23,243
And try telling him the family eats most of your
money!

1178
01:43:23,547 --> 01:43:25,071
The train leaves at 5

1179
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:30,277
We'll take him to the station. Rusconi has his car

1180
01:43:30,554 --> 01:43:32,351
If we go now there's a bus

1181
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:34,549
There's a bus, I've seen it

1182
01:43:35,192 --> 01:43:38,753
Umberto understands the situation. Don't you, boy?

1183
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:40,589
I'm not a boy!

1184
01:43:40,831 --> 01:43:41,889
He's right

1185
01:43:44,101 --> 01:43:47,264
What are you crying for?
You people are always crying

1186
01:43:49,006 --> 01:43:52,134
Yes, son, cry

1187
01:43:52,710 --> 01:43:57,079
The Lord answered my prayers...

1188
01:44:12,930 --> 01:44:17,026
Thank you, ma'am... thank you!

1189
01:44:19,269 --> 01:44:24,138
Thank you, ma'am... thank you!

1190
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:44,750
There they are!

1191
01:44:55,873 --> 01:44:56,805
After you, Reverend

1192
01:45:20,464 --> 01:45:23,627
I'm so happy! You should be happy too, you did a
good deed

1193
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:26,032
Yes, my conscience is clear

1194
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,112
Who cares about the soccer match!

1195
01:45:45,322 --> 01:45:46,482
Close the blinds

1196
01:45:51,495 --> 01:45:55,761
I won't budge from here, I'll stay in your bed forever!

1197
01:45:56,166 --> 01:45:57,963
I'll put roots down!

1198
01:46:01,405 --> 01:46:02,167
Don't shout

1199
01:46:02,372 --> 01:46:08,106
Put a record on. Undress, I'll watch you from here

1200
01:48:16,373 --> 01:48:18,170
We can't!

1201
01:48:24,114 --> 01:48:26,139
We have to wait a week

1202
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:28,108
What...?

1203
01:48:28,552 --> 01:48:31,544
I'm sorry, I can't help it

1204
01:48:33,857 --> 01:48:35,518
What do you mean?

1205
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:39,729
Don't look like that, try to understand

1206
01:48:40,797 --> 01:48:42,628
I made a vow

1207
01:48:46,236 --> 01:48:47,533
Understand?!

1208
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:50,604
I'll start crying too now

1209
01:48:54,344 --> 01:48:56,938
You want to drive me crazy

1210
01:48:57,447 --> 01:49:02,680
But sweetheart, a vow is a vow

1211
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:05,512
It's all over between us!

1212
01:49:06,156 --> 01:49:07,487
A week is soon over

1213
01:49:07,691 --> 01:49:11,593
You won't see me again! I'm a responsible person,
not a child!

1214
01:49:12,162 --> 01:49:13,652
Can't you make a sacrifice?

1215
01:49:14,531 --> 01:49:17,830
It'll be even better after. Come on, I'll fix you a coffee

1216
01:49:17,901 --> 01:49:20,529
Forget coffee! Here's your wallet back

1217
01:49:23,340 --> 01:49:26,138
And the tie! And the handkerchief!

1218
01:49:26,209 --> 01:49:29,542
But why? Don't be like that

1219
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:32,748
I drove 300 miles

1220
01:49:33,483 --> 01:49:35,348
Be serious!

1221
01:49:35,385 --> 01:49:38,877
I am serious. It's you who isn't serious

1222
01:49:38,922 --> 01:49:39,616
Came on...

1223
01:49:46,363 --> 01:49:48,888
Do you feel up to committing sacrilege?

1224
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:51,725
If you're not scared, come on!

1225
01:49:52,302 --> 01:49:55,135
But I'll be like a block of marble.

1226
01:49:55,472 --> 01:49:56,996
It'll be your responsibility

1227
01:49:57,641 --> 01:50:01,509
You could have made the vow for next month.
You knew I was here

1228
01:50:01,745 --> 01:50:06,614
Yes no, yes no since yesterday.
It's bad for one's health!

1229
01:50:08,485 --> 01:50:09,144
Bologna!

1230
01:50:15,459 --> 01:50:18,622
Yes, this is 577000. Bologna?

1231
01:50:19,496 --> 01:50:21,020
Yes, it's me, Dad

1232
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:25,896
We have to wait awhile longer, it still needs
stamping

1233
01:50:26,370 --> 01:50:26,893
No...

1234
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:31,268
I'm flying back tonight

1235
01:50:31,408 --> 01:50:32,397
No...

1236
01:50:33,577 --> 01:50:35,135
I've done everything I had to do

1237
01:50:35,912 --> 01:50:37,243
I even handed out the tips

1238
01:50:38,115 --> 01:50:41,107
But you have to tip them in advance, Dad!

1239
01:50:59,669 --> 01:51:00,636
Come here

1240
01:51:01,104 --> 01:51:02,435
No, I'm going

1241
01:51:04,141 --> 01:51:07,872
Keep me company... He'll get you the permit

1242
01:51:13,216 --> 01:51:14,308
Don't be like that

1243
01:51:15,819 --> 01:51:21,780
Come on, Augusto, come here...
