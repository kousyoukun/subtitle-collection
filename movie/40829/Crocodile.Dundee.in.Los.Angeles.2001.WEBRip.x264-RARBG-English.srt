2
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:47,301
Okay, ladies and gents,
Walkabout creek hotel.

3
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:50,165
Last chance for a coldie
Before we hit the outback.

4
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,211
G'day, all.
I'm your hostess.

5
00:02:56,244 --> 00:03:00,384
You can call me ruby
Or love or anything,
But never late for breakfast.

6
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,824
[ laughing ]

7
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,220
And what's your pleasure,
Folks?

8
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:09,424
Gin and tonic, please,
And a pims for the lady.

9
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:12,527
"g" and "t" and a pims.

10
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,829
No, i asked for
A gin and tonic
And a pims.

11
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,925
Yeah, well,
There's no harm in asking.

12
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:26,941
- couple of beers
Will be just fine.
- that's the ticket, old mate.

13
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,983
- hey, nugget.
- g'day, sue.

14
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:36,752
Where's mick ?
We got a panic call
From the rangers.

15
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:40,954
They spotted a huge croc
In the tarrabool swimming hole.

16
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:45,888
Actually, we tossed a coin
To see who'd catch it,
And mick won.

17
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,626
He went after it alone,
Did he ?
No.

18
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,032
Jacko jackson's gonna
Meet him out there.

19
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,974
And jacko, as you know,
Is the second best crocodile man
In the territory.

20
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:58,871
- so you got no worries, love.
- my only worry is i need mick
To pick mikey up after
School.

21
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,876
I'll tell mick for you.
If he gets tied up
With that croc,

22
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,749
- i'll pick up
The young fella myself.
- thanks.

23
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,418
I thought you were
The second best
Crocodile hunter.

24
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,618
Oh, well.
Oh, he's just modest.

25
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:13,021
He's one of the best,
You know ?

26
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:20,589
Hey, sue. If anything
Ever happens to mick,
I'm gonna come courtin'.

27
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,802
Well, let's just hope
Nothing happens to mick.

28
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:48,955
Now, where are you,
You big ugly bugger ?

29
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,379
This is as good as it gets.

30
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,398
Come on.
Come to uncle mick.

31
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:41,576
Big...

32
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,709
Big...

33
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,978
Big mistake.

34
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,894
Oh, shit.

35
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,142
[ sighs ]

36
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,904
- g'day, mate.
- g'day, jacko.

37
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,028
What are you doing
Up there ?

38
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:42,074
Just sittin' up here,
Thinking about
A new career, mate.

39
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,474
Where's your boat ?

40
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,438
On the bottom.

41
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,618
- how'd that happen ?
- croc pulled it under.

42
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,719
Pulled it under ?

43
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,460
How big was it ?

44
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,959
That big.

45
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,204
Now what ?

46
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:20,866
Well, now we scramble ashore
And go to plan "b."

47
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,105
Don't move.

48
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,951
Well, could be worse,
Mate.

49
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,586
Oh, yeah ?
How's that, mick ?

50
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:38,533
Well, someone could
See us up here,

51
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,729
Up the tree, outsmarted
By a bloody crocodile.

52
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:45,772
[ chattering ]
[ groans ]

53
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,899
[ chattering continues ]

54
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:55,111
[ woman ]
So help me god, if i see
A snake, i'm gonna drop dead.

55
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:01,854
How are they gonna catch
A crocodile up there
In the tree ?

56
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:07,792
So, which one is
The second best crocodile hunter
In the land ?

57
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,691
[ all laughing ]
Okay, everyone, we're on
A tight schedule here.

58
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,695
We better keep moving.
Don't want to disturb
The hunters.

59
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,258
Back on the bus,
Please, folks.

60
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,603
That's the way.

61
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,548
Bloody nugget.
Great, eh, mate ?

62
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,619
Two best crocodile hunters
In the entire
Northern territory, eh ?

63
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,518
Yeah.

64
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,951
We look like a couple
Of real pelicans,
Don't we, eh ?

65
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:43,257
[ both laughing ]

66
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,881
You know what i hate
About crocs, mate ?
They got legs. Come on.

67
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:14,591
Oh, remember
The good old days when
We just used to shoot 'em ?

68
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:20,192
Yeah. Yeah, mate,
But if there were no more crocs,
They wouldn't need hunters.

69
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:25,327
Oh, they'd need hunters...
To keep the wild pigs
In control.

70
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,195
Pigs ?
Oh, not the same.

71
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:33,235
I don't want my kid saying,
"there goes my dad,
Pig dundee."

72
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:37,113
Do you want to be known
As porker jackson ?
Well, no.

73
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:41,254
Nah, we need the crocs, mate.
They make us somebodies.

74
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:46,951
Without 'em, we're just
A couple of old bushwhackers
With bite marks on our legs.

75
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,187
We'll get him tomorrow.
Same time.

76
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:53,232
Hey, i knew a pig farmer
Called porker o'brien once.
Hah !

77
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,930
You know why
They called him porker ?

78
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,838
I hate it when he does that.

79
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,971
Gives me the creeps.

80
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,386
Thanks, mate.
No worries.

81
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:38,274
So, you got out of that tree
All right, eh ?

82
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,835
Now, how could you
Possibly know
About that already ?

83
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:47,275
My people have ways
Of talking that no white man
Can understand.

84
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:52,024
Arthur, you're so full
Of bullshit.

85
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,152
No, it's a kind
Of mental telepathy, eh ?

86
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:58,787
Yeah, mental, all right.
[ cell phone ringing ]

87
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,956
Ah, i think we just
Found out which one of us
Is the white man.

88
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,095
Yeah ?

89
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,398
Yeah, i heard about that.

90
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,706
[ laughing ]
Yeah, well, he's standin'
Right next to me now.

91
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:15,979
Oh, great.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, later.

92
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,981
So, are you doin'
A show tonight ?
Yeah.

93
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:25,154
Already did the matinee.
Gotta keep the tourists
Happy, eh ?

94
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:29,055
Oh, well, mate, these days
They're our bread and butter.

95
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,959
That's sort of what we are now
In the twentieth century--
Tourist attractions.

96
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,055
As they say,
That's show business, mate.

97
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,297
By the way, mick,

98
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,102
It's the 21st century, mate.

99
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,244
Oh, yeah, i-i knew that.

100
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,814
See you, art.
See you later.

101
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,813
See ya, troy.
See ya, mikey.

102
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,005
Wanna go fishing ?
Yeah.

103
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:01,217
So, what did you learn today ?
Oh, just school stuff.

104
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:05,764
But we had an earthquake video,
And we learned how they happen
In california, america.

105
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:09,003
Did you see one
When you were there ?
No, i was in new york.

106
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,899
They don't have
Earthquakes there.

107
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:15,101
People there
Wouldn't stand for it.
They'd be like,

108
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:19,205
[ imitating new york accent ]
"earthquake ?
Hey, this is brooklyn.

109
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:23,039
Get outta here.
Forget about it."

110
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,046
They're tough.

111
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,219
Whoa, homework time.
What's that ?

112
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:36,822
- it's goanna turd.
- that means he's close by.
Find him.

113
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,441
There he is.
Yep.

114
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:04,083
You hungry ?
Want him for dinner ?
Yuck, no way.

115
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,857
Then you better miss.
Dad, i never miss.

116
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,122
[ gulping ]

117
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,395
Whoa.

118
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,031
Quick, dad, there's
A big razorback up there.
Can you do it ?

119
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:24,198
Do what ?
You know, that trick.
Please.

120
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,837
All right, but it won't work
If you're scared.
He'll smell it.

121
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,144
I know.
I won't be scared.
I promise.

122
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,276
Don't look at him
Till i do.

123
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,351
I really won't be scared
If i can carry your knife.

124
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,313
[ imitates growling ]
Cool.

125
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,515
[ laughing ]

126
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:29,572
Okay, dad,
I'll talk it over
With mick. Uh-huh.

127
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:34,978
No. No, and if we decide
We need to be married,

128
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:38,208
I promise you'll be
The first to know.

129
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,549
Would you like to say hello
To your grandson ?
Okay. Hang on.

130
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,364
Hey, mikey.
Come say hi to grandpa.

131
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,964
Hi, grandpa.

132
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,531
Pretty good, yeah.

133
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,503
[ sighs ]
So, what's new ?

134
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:03,302
Oh, tom zetland--
He ran the l.a. Bureau
Of dad's paper--

135
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,306
Was just killed
In a car accident.

136
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:09,008
- what, was he a mate of yours ?
- actually, no.

137
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:13,652
But the thing is, mick,
Dad is now pleading with me
To take his place...

138
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,620
While he looks
For a permanent replacement.

139
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,389
So, what you're sayin' is
Your dad wants you to go
And work for him in los angeles.

140
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,991
Mm.

141
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,463
For how long ?

142
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:30,602
Well, i told him i might
Fill in for a few weeks.

143
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,238
Well, tell me this,
If we lived over there
In the city,

144
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,212
Would you take
The job then ?
Oh, sure.

145
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:44,041
I mean, i was raised
By a newspaperman,

146
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:49,247
And, well, i don't know,
I guess it just gets
In your blood.

147
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,752
That settles it then.
Take the job.

148
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:57,155
At least
For the rest of the year.
Me and mikey'll go with you.

149
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,230
You're kidding ?
No. Be good for him.
Help him decide.

150
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,561
Decide ?

151
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,726
Well, your dad owns
A newspaper, right ?
Mm-hmm.

152
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,095
You're his only child.
Someday mikey's gonna
Have to decide.

153
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,336
Does he want to be
An assistant
Crocodile wrangler...

154
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,041
Or the owner
Of a big-city newspaper ?

155
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:18,254
That's a tough one.
And the travel will be
Good for him.

156
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:21,078
Remember how my trip
To new york...

157
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:24,624
And sort of opened my eyes
To the ways of the world ?

158
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,091
Made me a lot more--
What's the word ?

159
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,661
- sophisticated ?
- yeah.

160
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,763
By the way, mick,
What are you doing
With that awful trap ?

161
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,195
You're not going to use that
On some poor animal ?

162
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,631
No, i'm lending it to donk.
Some mongrel's been sneaking
Into the pub at night...

163
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,638
And knocking off his grog.
[ chuckles ]
Stealing donk's beer, well,

164
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,512
I guess they deserve
To be mangled.
Yeah.

165
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:52,011
Well, what about you, mikey ?
What do you think ?

166
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,788
How would you like to live
In california for a while ?

167
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:02,588
- they have earthquakes
There, right ?
- well, yeah, they have had.

168
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,262
Cool.

169
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,661
I thought you might say that.
You're gonna have lots of fun.

170
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,095
Actually, you're the one
I'm worried about.

171
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,435
No, i'm fine.

172
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:26,280
Um, mick, i seem to remember
After a few weeks in new york
You did get pretty antsy.

173
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,553
Yeah, a bit antsy.

174
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:33,591
Mm, that's what i love
About you, mick.
You're always so unselfish.

175
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,488
No worries.

176

A lot of 'em, yep.

I'm a writer-actor.

Tom arnold ?

Oh, wife probably knows
Who he is. She's-she's
In the newspaper business.

187
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,555
A reporter.
Yeah.

Thanks.

00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:12,818
- that-that's nice.
- no, you can keep that.
I got plenty of copies.

00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,955

Okay, tax relief plan.
State tax only.

No interest there.

195
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:17,675
Okay, these figures
Comparing l.a. To new york
Drivers, that's good.

196
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,017
Follow through on that.
Great. So our policy
Hasn't changed then ?

197
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,523
How so ?
Well, it's like
Mr. Zetland used to say,

198
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,886
[ imitating mr. Zetland ]
"we're a new york paper.

199

Ain't about new york,
Then who gives a rat's ass ?"

Or words to that effect.

201
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,400
So he wasn't too happy
About working in l.a., huh ?
Oh, no, no.

202
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,644
Tom loved it here.
No, he loved doing
Expose features...

203
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,410
And investigating
Scams and phonies.

204
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,410
- what was he working on ?
- he was doing this feature...

00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,954
On this new mini studio.

206
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,280
He started to get
Really excited about it.

207
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,948
I think he smelled a rat.

208
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,256
But what it was about,
Only tom knew.

209
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,601
Maybe you can find out
What sparked his interest
In there. Good luck.

00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,996
Oh, hey,
How are your boys doing ?
Are they out exploring ?

Oh, yeah.
Should be fun too.
For both of them.

Really ? So where's
Your house from here ?

233

Eleven point five miles,
Two degrees north northeast.
Called, uh, beverly hills.

So, you have a nice home ?

- yeah, that's eight bathrooms.

- no, he's not married.

Yeah.
Well, mikey's my son.

239
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,631
Right.
So you're a good parent ?
Well, i'd say.

240
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:23,035
Right. Oh, this is too good.
I finally bump
Into a cute cowboy.

Robert redford's vintage than
Brad pitt's, but that's okay...

242

'Cause he's got a mansion
In beverly hills, plus he's got
Custody of his kid.

Around that pub.

Yeah.
Listen to this.

255
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:20,529
Silvergate pictures make
Their first movie, right ?
Lethal agent.

256
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,090
It's a total bomb.

257
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,128
So the very next picture
They make is lethal agent ii...

258
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:29,004
Which, of course,
Goes straight to video
Where no one rents it.

259
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:32,565
And guess what they're
Doing now to save
Their reputation ?

260
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,535
Uh--
Yeah.

261
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,778
I don't know.
Did tom talk to these guys ?

262
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,620
Well, yeah. I mean, i think
He spoke to everybody from the
President of the studio down.

263
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,049
That's when he seemed to get
Really excited about the story.

264
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:50,294
All i can see here is
A bunch of really dumb
Business decisions.

265
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,532
But, of course,
That's not illegal.

266
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,929
Well, you know, that's
The research i did for him.

267
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,831
Whatever tom was working on
Is probably in his p.c.

268
00:24:57,864 --> 00:25:01,034
I can get the disk from
His house, if you're interested.
That'd be great.

269
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:08,212
And i notice they're having
A "meet and greet" for press
And industry people.

270
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,740
Do you know who would
Normally cover that ?
Fay olson does entertainment.

271
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:15,948
Okay. Tell her
She can have the night off,
And i'll fill in.

272
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:25,017
- hey, dad,
What sort of car is that ?
- i can't look now, mate.

273
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,627
These california people
Are nice and friendly
And polite...

274
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:31,761
Till they get in their cars,
Then they turn into
Crazed wombats.

275
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:34,268
- quick, dad, stop,
There's a dog in the road.
- where ?

276
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,181
So where's the dog ?
He ducked in there.

277
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:54,147
I'll get him.

278
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,086
Be careful.

279
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,761
All right, everybody, stay back.
Don't worry, we'll get him.

280
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,326
I'm on it.

281
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,674
What's the hell's goin' on
Up there ?
Come on, buddy !

282
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,300
- the guy said there's
Something on the road.
- he looks like a nut to me.

283
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,907
- probably a bomb or something.
- it's a what ?

284
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,380
- he says it's a bomb !
- it's a bomb !
It's gonna blow !

Come here, boy. Come on.

287
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:29,222
He won't come out.
He's scared.

288
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,355
That's not a dog.
That's a--

289
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,931
I don't know what it is.
Some kind of possum maybe.

290
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:38,002
I've never seen
A black and white possum.

291
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,930
I think it's a skunk.

00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,637
How do you know
What a skunk looks like ?
We don't have 'em at home.

293
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,170
It looks like pepe lepew
In the cartoons on tv.
[ chuckles ]

294
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,107
I thought skunks were
Supposed to stink.

295
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,983
[ sniffing ]
Don't stink.

296
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:03,192
Come on, boy.
Come on.

297
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,941
[ dispatcher chattering ]

298
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,410
Possible explosive device
And hostage situation.

299
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,409
There we go.

300
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,106
No wonder he's scared.

301
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,205
Those bloody helicopters.

302
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,319
Take off !

303
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,820
We have a very tricky situation
For the police here.

304
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:40,656
The suspect appears to be
Holding a young boy hostage.

305
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,095
Stay where you are !

306
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,331
Put the bomb down !

307
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,336
What ?

308
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:54,706
That's not a bomb.
That's a cat.

309
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:01,146
Ah, see, just like at home.
The policeman is your friend.

310
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,250
They're here to help us.

311
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,447
That's not a cat.
That's a skunk.

312
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:13,729
- you can take it
From here, guys.
- uh-uh.

313
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,800
Uh, mike, i wouldn't
Mention this to your mum.

314
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,230
She probably
Wouldn't understand.
It's man stuff.

315
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,237
Of course, at that stage,
Early this afternoon,

316
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,740
We had no idea that the bomb
Was, in fact, a skunk.

317
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:31,935
Officers reluctantly placed
The skunk in a squad car...

318
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:34,248
To await the arrival
Of animal control.

319
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,380
In the meantime, it backed up
Traffic on the 101...

320
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:41,016
[ volume increases ]
From calabasas to pasadena,
The worst traffic jam--

321
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,823
What are you doing, mikey ?
Uh, it's okay, love, it's me.

322
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:48,357
Oh. Mick, are you sure
You want to come tonight ?

323
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:52,774
I mean, it's a social thing,
But it'll be work for me.
I'm lookin' forward to it.

324
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,099
You know,
To see if the local people
Are as friendly as new yorkers.

325
00:28:56,135 --> 00:29:00,765
Well, i hope your son feels
The same way. He starts
School on wednesday.

326
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:05,977
Oh, no worries.
He's, uh, he's
Just like me, really.

327
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:10,952
From what i hear,
He has enough charm to stop
A skunk from spraying him.

328
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:14,553
- yeah, well, you know, we were
Roarin' down the freeway--
- it's okay.

329
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:20,056
- he looked really cute on tv.
- bloody television.

330
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,192
** [ rap ]

331
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,316
Not this time, pal.

332
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,816
- [ gasps ] mick !
- call the cops !

333
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,957
Let him go. He's the valet.
He's supposed to park the car.

334
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:56,403
Yeah, yeah,
Take it easy, dude.

335
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,330
Tip him.
Sorry.

336
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,468
Honest mistake.
Sorry.

337
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,910
Valet ?

338
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:12,342
** [ rap continues ]

339
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,188
Picture, please.
Sure.

340
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,591
Mind if we get a shot ?

341
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:28,902
Don't worry about me.
I'll just get a drink,
Blend right in.
Okay.

342
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:32,458
I'll come and get you
After i've done
The formalities.

343
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,206
[ man ]
Big smile
For the camera, please.

344
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:55,957
All right, that's your evian,
And this here's your sparkling
Mineral water with a twist.

345
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,918
Oh, and a straight
Club soda.

346
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:03,229
So, you havin' a drink
Or doin' your laundry ?

347
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,996
G'day. Mick dundee.

348
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,565
And you're--
Tony. What can i get
For you, mr. Dundee ?

349
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,243
Just a cold beer'll
Be all right, thanks.

350
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:18,384
That's typical
Of l.a. Today.
Health nuts.

351
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,510
Worried about what they drink,
Worried about what they eat.

352
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:26,488
I used to be like that
Till i found the answer.

353
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:29,958
Oh ? And, um,
What's the answer ?

354
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:36,099
Coffee. Eat and drink
Whatever you please and then
Flush it out with coffee.

355
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,658
So you just drink
Lots of coffee.

356
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:44,197
No. You don't drink it.
I'm talking colonics.

357
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:50,306
A good coffee enema
Leaves you clean as a whistle.
[ chuckles ] bottoms up.

358
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,415
Hey, tony.
An enema--

359
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:02,321
Isn't that where they shove
A hose up the old--
Yep.

360
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:05,564
- lots of people swear by 'em.
- with coffee ?

361
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:12,257
- cream and sugar ?
- it's l.a.

362
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,968
Excuse me, mr. Rothman.

363
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,139
I'd love to introduce you
To someone.

364
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:26,014
This is ms. Sue charleton
From newsday.
Hello.

365
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:29,175
Arnan rothman. Delighted.
Didi tells me you've replaced...

366
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,975
Our late friend,
Tom zetland.
[ cell phone ringing ]

367
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:34,988
Excuse me.
That's a damn shame.
He was a good man,

368
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:37,021
And he really knew his way
Around this business.

369
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:41,486
Well, i'm afraid
I come up a bit short
In that department.

370
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,727
Actually, i was hoping
Maybe you could help me out.

371
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:51,273
Are you in the cast
Of this flick ?
Me ? Oh, no, i'm socializing.

372
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,543
Networking. Me too.
Have you seen any
Of these masterpieces ?

373
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,613
No.
Don't. Unbelievable schlock.
I kid you not.

374
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,053
Makes you embarrassed
To be in the business.

375
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,079
The only thing i've seen
Worse than lethal agent
Was lethal agent ii.

376
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:05,475
I read the script on this one,
And it's even worse.

377
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,717
I don't know how these clowns
Stay in business.

378
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:11,263
I suppose you've heard, then,
They're making lethal agent iv.

379
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,230
What ?

380
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:16,799
No one told me.
Do you know if they're
Casting yet ?

381
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,468
I gotta call my agent.

382
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,400
I'm planning
On following through
On tom's story...

383
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:26,335
More about your film company
Than this particular film.

384
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:28,542
We shot the movie in greece.
Oh !

385
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:31,344
[ gasps ]

386
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:36,047
Allow me to introduce you
To milos drubnick, our
International vice president.

387
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:40,322
Sue charleton.
I'm delighted to meet
American movie star.

388
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,252
I'm a big fan,
All your films.

389
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:45,388
Well, that's very kind of you,
But i'm a journalist.

390
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:49,104
Sue's from newsday.

391
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:53,328
- huh.
- milos handles all our
Eastern european activity.

392
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,395
I could not work over there
Without him.

393
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,474
You'll excuse me.

394
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:04,183
Well, i don't want to monopolize
All your time here.

395
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,380
I was hoping we could catch up
At the studio.
Absolutely.

396
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:12,618
That's just the way
They do it.

397
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:18,091
You don't want that, love.
Get some free food in you.
You'll feel a lot better.

398
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:19,834
You're welcome.

399
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,860
Hey, you're from
Down under, right ?
Yeah.

400
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,197
I don't suppose you know
Mel gibson.

401
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:32,744
Mel gibson ? Ought to.
Bailed him out of jail twice.

402
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,241
You're kidding.
You really do know him ?

403
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:38,584
Oh, i could tell you
Some tales about mad mel.
Please do.

404
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:43,320
I thought you said
We were finished with these
Prying newsday people.

405
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:46,489
She's just following up
On the original story.
I'll handle it.

406
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:50,618
No. Now she want to come
Snooping around the studio.
You should say no.

407
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:53,386
Look, we're the new boys
In town, right ?

408
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,325
We're supposed to be begging
For publicity.

409
00:34:55,361 --> 00:35:00,471
We start banning the press,
They're gonna be all over us.
Leave this to me.

410
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:05,169
So he takes his shoes off--
Oh, thanks, tony.
You're welcome.

411
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:08,844
Runs outside stark naked.

412
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:12,214
Sets fire to the building
And burns it
To the bloody ground.

413
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:15,154
[ all laughing ]

414
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:16,881
He's a mad bugger.

415
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,390
Excuse me.

416
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,363
Mel gibson's best friend.
They're practically brothers.

417
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,590
I've seen them together.
Just tellin' 'em a few tales
About mel gibson.

418
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,626
You don't know mel gibson.
Yeah, i do.

419
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,632
You know him too.
Met him at donk's pub.

420
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,695
Mel gibson--
Tall redheaded fellow,
Walks with a limp.

421
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:41,265
Oh, "mal."
Malcolm gibson.
Not mel gibson.

422
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:45,877
Yeah, mal gibson. How do they
Know about him over here ?
Small world, isn't it ?

423
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:51,181
Hey, mick. Mick,
You give me a call anytime.

424
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,154
Okay, dude. Hey !
Maybe we'll do lunch.

425
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:02,690
Oh, mick, you're starting
To scare me.
I like hollywood.

426
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:08,371
Good afternoon.
Welcome to beverly hills.

427
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,500
Thanks.

428
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,684
So, your story
On the film company
Just got red hot.

429
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,548
Tom zetland's place was robbed,
And they took everything.

430
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:24,818
Oh, my god, that's terrible.
But how does it make
The story hot ?

431
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,390
Well, tom is
Accidentally killed.

432
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:33,329
Coincidentally his place is
Cleaned out, leaving no clues
To what he's working on.

433
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,259
Maybe tom was on
To something big,

434
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,955
And they had to
Shut him up.

435
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:41,626
You think the film people
Had him killed ?

436
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,667
It's possible.

437
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,712
I had a bad vibe about this
From the start.

438
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,868
I think you should
Be careful
Going out there.

439
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:52,637
Well, i'm not exactly going
Into a mafia stronghold.

440
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:54,948
I'm interviewing
A studio head on the lot.

441
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,780
I'm even bringing
My family along.
They're gonna do the tour.

442
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:11,298
Well, all righty, then.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
Boy and girls,

443
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,600
To the paramount pictures tour.

444
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:17,602
This is where
The magic happens, people.
But before we actually begin,

445
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:21,766
I'm gonna ask you all
To raise your right hand.

446
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,906
Okay, cool.
Now what you're
About to witness...

447
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:29,345
Are some of the biggest secrets
Of moviemaking.

448
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:34,651
So i must ask that all of you
Swear not to reveal anything
You may witness here today.

449
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,924
Do you swear ?

450
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,655
Uh, just say, "i do."

451
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:44,363
[ all ]
I do.
Okay.

452
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,296
Righty ho, jim.

453
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:58,684
Oh, wow, you're in
For a special treat
Here today, people,

454
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,210
'Cause just up ahead
We're actually filming...

455
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:06,045
A giant crowd scene
For the latest silvergate studio
Picture, lethal agent iii.

456
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,494
I told you we should've gone
To universal.

457
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,920
Because quite simply,
Losses on the first
Two movies...

458
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:15,657
Are amortized into the cost
Of the franchise.

459
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,404
We're making this movie
For practically nothing.

460
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,800
Okay, but still,
Wouldn't it be cheaper
To make your films...

461
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,703
Either here
Or in eastern europe
Instead of both places ?

462
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,637
Sure, but our movies are set
In eastern europe.

463
00:38:28,674 --> 00:38:31,044
You can't fake
The locations here ?

464
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:33,876
I mean, they're shooting
An african jungle next door.

465
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,722
Sue, can you and i talk
Off the record ?

466
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,988
Darling, will you excuse us
For a minute ?
Sure.

467
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,064
Quite frankly, the, uh,

468
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:48,859
The success or failure
Of these films...

469
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:51,364
Is of little importance
To us.

470
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:55,568
We're after bigger fish.

471
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:59,611
There are over
300 million people...

472
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:02,638
In what was once
The soviet bloc.

473
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,844
People who are starved
Of entertainment.

474
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:10,076
Movies shot
In their own backyard,
Starring their own people.

475
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:13,645
I'm talking about
Building major studios,
Cineplex chains,

476
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,445
Even theme parks.

477
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:21,087
The deal i am talking about
Will make euro disney
Seem penny-ante.

478
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:25,726
Well, this is a great story.
A russian hollywood.

479
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,804
And when do we go
On record ?

480
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:32,143
[ sighs ]
Two weeks, tops.

481
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,740
But for you,

482
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,707
24 hours before
The rest of the world.

483
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:41,114
Exclusive to newsday.

484
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,150
And in return ?

485
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:48,192
Postpone the piece
You've already started.
Right now, what is it ?

486
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,519
It's a-- it's a story
About a small-time studio...

487
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:54,487
And their two
Unsuccessful movies.

488
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:56,726
[ chuckles ]
Who cares ?

489
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,762
What do you say ?

490
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,727
[ buzzing ]
Well,

491
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:05,466
If it's a newsday exclusive,
I guess you got a deal.

492
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:09,074
Claire, why don't you take
Ms. Charleton down to the set.

493
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:13,177
You can see
The glamorous side
Of the business.

494
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,851
I'll be in touch.

495
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,160
You are good.

496
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:33,795
[ tour guide ]
...where we can transform
An ordinary man or woman...

497
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:35,902
Into an ape or a clown.

498
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:40,544
All righty, then.
Now, before we enter
This next portal,

499
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:43,742
It is my duty to warn you
That several dangerous
Jungle creatures...

500
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:49,175
Have been sighted on the loose,
So, please, keep inside the tram
At all times.

501
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:53,254
I don't want to lose
Anyone... Again.

502
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,924
Dad, do you have
Your big knife ?
Didn't think i'd need it here.

503
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,685
I might have my pocket knife.
What do you need it for ?

504
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:03,495
I mean, in case
The jungle animals attack.
I think we'll be all right.

505
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:08,233
Okay, look out, folks,
It's a giant deadly anaconda !

506
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,913
[ passengers gasping ]
[ chuckling ]

507
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:23,176
- well, that's awesome, dude.
- sorry, reflex action.

508
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,054
Okay. Cool.

509
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,893
Let's get outta here.

510
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:32,555
G'day.

511
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:36,261
Was that more
Man stuff, dad ?
You got that right, mate.

512
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:45,844
Hey, you two.
Did you have fun ?
Yeah, it was cool.

513
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:48,241
Yeah. So how'd
Your interview go ?

514
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,652
Creepy.

515
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,779
Did you ever talk to someone
And think everything
They're saying is a lie ?

516
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:59,916
Yeah. Nugget.

517
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:03,961
Well, nugget's harmless.
This guy--

518
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:08,189
You know what you should do ?
Your paper's got police
Connections, right ?

519
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,226
You get the cops to do
A background check on him.

520
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,172
That's the way they do it
On nypd blue.

521
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:17,839
Hmm.
Well, i see mikey's not
The only one glued...

522
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,239
To the tv all day long.

523
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,881
Oh, yeah, but we only watch
Educational programs.
Right, mate ?

524
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,879
Yeah.
Like wrestling.

525
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:29,081
Can you smell
What the rock is cooking ?

526
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:37,188
Well, did he
Behave today ?
Yeah, he was good as gold.

527
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,692
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to mikey.

528
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:43,995
Oh.
And no more tv.
You start school tomorrow.

529
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:09,218
G'day.
Mick dundee.

530
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:13,056
Here to pick up
My ankle biter.
It's his first day.

531
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,831
Ah, barry katz.
What, uh, grade's he in ?

532
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:18,361
Uh, fourth.
Oh, same as my boy.

533
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,896
My boy's in the third.
Eric berry.

534
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,732
Hi, eric.
Well, you look
Like an outdoorsman.

535
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,968
What do you think of this
Whole survival camp idea ?
What is it ?

536
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:29,374
Well, the school's puttin' it
On this summer. Teach the kids
How to survive in the woods.

537
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,177
Fishing, making campfires.
Dads are welcome.

538
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:35,111
Oh.
[ eric ]
I think it's a great idea.

539
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:39,216
Gives them a chance to get
In touch with nature.
I'm gonna take gary along.

540
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:43,720
Good for you. Couple of weeks
In the bush, you and your boy,
You'll both love it.

541
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:48,985
You ever take your boy into
The outback where you were ?
Down under ?

542
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,657
All the time.

543
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:54,067
Just last month,
I took him into the bush.

544
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,170
Taught him how to kill
A wild boar with a stick.

545
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:00,373
Kill a boar ?
But he's, like,
Nine years old ?

546
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:05,175
Yeah, well,
You know what they say ?
Better late than never, eh ?

547
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:09,718
Ah.
See you later, fellas.

548
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:18,792
Hey, dad.
Ms. Mathis wants to talk to you.
I'll meet you over there.

549
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:22,734
Dorothy mathis, mr. Charleton.
Oh, how do you do ?
Actually, it's mick dundee.

550
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:25,801
But i'm mikey's dad.
Oh, mr. Dundee. Right.

551
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:31,001
Well, first off,
Mikey is a lovely boy.
Bright, friendly.

552
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:35,236
There's just one small problem,
One we run into
All the time here.

553
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,243
We call it
The "hollywood syndrome."

554
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,705
Like when a dad plays
A policeman in a movie,

555
00:44:39,745 --> 00:44:43,175
The children often believe
He's actually a policeman.

556
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,724
Oh, right, you've got
A lot of actors' kids here.

557
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:49,921
I'm not in the movie business.
I'm in the tourism business.
Not so glamorous.

558
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:55,185
Exactly. Which is why your son
Tries to make it sound a bit
More colorful than it really is.

559
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:59,196
Now, it seems harmless,
But little fibs can grow.

560
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,730
What's he been sayin' ?

561
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,737
I'm afraid he told everyone
You're a hunter,

562
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:08,140
And you hunt
And kill crocodiles.
[ chuckles nervously ]

563
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:11,083
Oh. He knows
Better than that.

564
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:15,749
Crocodiles are protected.
I don't kill 'em.
I catch 'em alive.

565
00:45:16,982 --> 00:45:20,122
Oh ?
Well, yes, of course.

566
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:23,191
I'll talk to him.
There'll be no more fibs.

567
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,491
Really nice to meet you,
Dorothy.

568
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,730
Looks like a hunter.

569
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:39,397
Nice butt.

570
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:43,207
Dad, will you tell the teachers
To call me dundee,
Not charleton ?

571
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:47,381
Oh, sure. We just had to
Enroll you at school
Under your mother's name...

572
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:51,252
'Cause that's
Your legal name over here.

573
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,182
Is that 'cause you won't
Marry mum ?

574
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,348
Oh, no,
We're married... Sorta.

575
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:57,886
We just haven't done
The legal bit yet.

576
00:45:57,923 --> 00:46:01,533
So what'd the kids at school say
When you told them your dad was
A crocodile hunter ?

577
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,899
They said, "well, what's
He doing in beverly hills ?"

578
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,871
Smart kids.

579
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:17,809
Hey, dad,
What's that man doing ?

580
00:46:17,843 --> 00:46:22,313
I don't know.
Let's go and ask him.

581
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:29,887
Excuse me, mister.
What are you doing ?

Meditating is a special place

Where there's no distraction,

And i receive
A great source of power.

Okay, okay.
Hold your legs...

To save yourself
Some discomfort,

Ahead. I need to talk to mike
For a minute.

Now, mike, i need a favor.

You know, mick, everybody
Needs a favor from me.

Well, i need you
To help me out.
My knees have locked.

That's my bad right there.
You got it, buddy.

609
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:02,408
I didn't want my kid to see.
Oh !
There.

610
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,354
Thank you.

611
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:10,692
Hey, dad, did you see
The size of mike's muscles ?
They were huge.

612
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:15,261
Yeah. You see,
You should never judge
A book by its cover.

613
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:19,303
That mike-- big man,
Built like a brick dunney,

614
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,130
But i could tell straightaway
He was a gentle man.

615
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:28,568
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
I just know people.
It's a gift.

[ man on tv ]
I need you guys to tear

Ah, it's the bowlin' ball.
Pure heroin.

618
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:42,451
I know it's here somewhere.
Check out the bowlin' ball.

619
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:46,217
Hey, what about

What are you doin', love ?
Trying to think
Like a journalist again.

623
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,180
I used to be
Pretty good at it.

624
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:15,286
Not that anyone was gonna put
Sue charleton and pulitzer prize
In the same sentence,

625
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:20,160
But, ah,
[ sighs ]
I'm just stumped.

626
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,191
Is it that, uh,
Film studio thing ?

627
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:28,167
I'm sure it's an elaborate front
For something. But what ?

628
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,699
They're smugglin'.

629
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:34,035
- drugs or guns.
- how do you arrive at that ?

630
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:39,542
That's what it always is.
The big money thing they smuggle
Into america are drugs.

631
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:42,407
And the big thing goin' out--

Oh.

And where did this insight
Into major criminal activities
Come from ?

00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,085
Oh, from tv.
I'm a quick learner.

Fell off the turnip truck,
But i didn't land on my head.

You know what you need ?
You need a mole.

- a mole ?
- me. I'll get a job
At the studio.

Oh, mick, i know you need
Something to do, but--

639
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:13,335
I made a lot of contacts
At that movie party.

640

I bet one of them
Could get me a job there.

Who's gonna take him to school
In the morning ?

642

One of those nannies.
I'll get a good one.

No worry.
Leave it to me.
This is important.

Young mikey thinks i'm
A bit of a hillbilly.

Well, i am, actually.

00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,530

That being a hillbilly doesn't
Necessarily mean you're dumb.

Yeah, well, if you start looking
At the camera during the take,

They'll take you out
Of the picture.
Oh.

You're new, aren't you ?

All of my animals
Are on the jungle set,

00:56:43,668 --> 00:56:46,168
And i can't keep coming
Back and forth with the chimp.

731
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:48,943
So if you'll fill in for me,
I'll double what
You're getting paid.

Thanks for you help, diego.
Dude, mick !

Hey, hey,
This is a positive
Career move.

Reckon ?
Yeah ! I'm telling you,
You're gonna go far.

739

Ah ! Don't be
A stranger now.

740
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:20,538
Hell of a nice guy.

741
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:23,511
Can't act for shit,

742
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:26,741
But he'll probably wind up
With his own tv sitcom.

I suppose your father's
Picking you up again.

Naw, he's at work
This week.

00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:44,958
Oh. Bummer.
Well, how are you
Getting home then ?

749
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,995
I've got a nanny
Like all the other kids.

750
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:49,971
Oh ! Which one's yours ?

751

Over there.
The big one.

Your nanny ?
He's really uncle jacko
From back home.

753
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:02,278
And is uncle jacko married ?
No, but he's looking.

754
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,182
Hi. Dorothy mathis.
I'm mikey's teacher.

G'day, dorothy.

Los angeles, eh ?

758
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,829
Funny name.

759
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:23,926
Los angeles.

760
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:27,038
Yeah, it means, uh,
"lost angels."

00:58:28,038 --> 00:58:31,138
It's italian.
Ah, there it is.

00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:34,135
I told sue i'd take you
Somewhere really special
For dinner.

You're gonna
Love this place.
Trust me.

764
00:58:43,588 --> 00:58:46,888
Now, pick out what you want
Off the menu here...

765
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:49,334
And you yell it out
Into that box.

766
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,859
Two minutes later,
You're scarfing it down...

767
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:54,926
Without even
Getting out of the car.

768
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:57,125
We have these drive-ins
Back home in the cities,

769
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,197
But this is
Where it all started.

770
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:05,106
So you can eat like a pig
And no one can see you.

Clever buggers,
These yanks, eh ?

772
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,351
Well, this is why
L.a. Is famous
All around the world--

773
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,250
For its fine cuisine.

Welcome to wendy's.
Can i take your order ?

775
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:17,821
Let me handle this.
Good evening, wendy.

776
00:59:17,855 --> 00:59:23,325
There will be four of us
Dining in the car
This evening.

777
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,000
So we're gonna need
Four triple burgers
With cheese...

778
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:28,631
And four biggie fries.

779
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,896
So that's
Four classic triples...

780
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:32,935
Uh, wait a minute.
And four biggie fries ?

781
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:36,910
Uh, here comes
Stan and harry.

782
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:39,641
Uh, they'll also be
Dining with us tonight,

783
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:44,677
So we need...
Six triple burgers
With cheese...

784
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:47,275
And six biggie fries.

785
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:52,087
Okay. Six classic triples
With cheese and six
Biggie fries ?

786
00:59:54,759 --> 00:59:58,099
- you know what
I'd really like to do ?
- what's that ?

787
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:01,368
Go right up on the roof
On one of those skyscrapers.

788
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:05,198
That's easy.
Just find one that's open.

789
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:17,721
It's the truth.
This is higher than ayers rock.

790
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:24,117
Yeah. Of course,
The buildings in new york
Are a lot higher.

791
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:26,364
I was there, you know.

792
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,830
Old new york.

793
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:32,259
Or as we call it,
The "big apple."

794
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:35,366
Big apple ?
Why do you call it that ?

795
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,997
Well, because
It's really big and, uh--

796
01:00:40,037 --> 01:00:43,637
Yeah, but none
Of those buildings
Are as dangerous as this.

797
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:49,283
- what do you mean ?
- well, they don't have
Earthquakes in new york.

798
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:52,383
They have 'em here
All the time, right ?

799
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,886
Yeah.

800
01:00:54,919 --> 01:00:57,719
We could have one
Right now.

801
01:00:57,755 --> 01:00:59,415
God !

802
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:01,686
What do you reckon it'd
Do to this building ?

803

Hey, i wouldn't wanna
Be up here if she
Started shakin', eh ?

After all those 1,286 stairs.

Didn't work.

There's hundreds of cars
Going through...

And just us two
Trying to cross.

Yeah ?
Now there's 20 of us, eh ?

815
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:19,904
Yeah, but you can't do that.
It's illegal.

Well, i don't see any cops.

Yeah, but they have
Cameras at all these
Intersections, see ?

818
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:29,849
If you do anything wrong,
They take your picture
And send you a fine.

Yeah, but i ain't wearing
A number plate around my neck,

Gonna know who i am, huh ?

You showed 'em

I wonder
How much they fine you.

825
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:55,172
It all depends on
How many times
You push the button.

01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:08,296
You were really good.

876
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:10,302
You said black
With one sugar, right ?
Oh, yes.

877
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:12,674
Thanks, mate.
Excellent.
And...

878
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,142
I got us a little treat
For our friend here.

879
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:17,372
Oh, great.
That'll hit the spot.

880
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:20,507
Black and one sugar.
[ slurps ]

881
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:23,684
She's a bit grumpy today.

882
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:26,253
Not happy with
The size of her trailer.

883
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:28,593
She wants
A big one like virgil,
But i keep telling her,

884
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:31,318
"virgil's a lion.
You're only a monkey."

885
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:35,085
- [ chittering ]
- sorry.

886
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,755
"chimpanzee."

887
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:39,103
Say, have you thought
About changing agents ?

888
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:44,267
Diego,
You're talking to a chimp.
They don't speak english.

889
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:47,541
Neither did
My first wife.

890
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:51,408
Keep moving, dravos.

891
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:23,539
Don't be stupid !
Mind the painting !

892
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:28,713
[ muttering ]

893
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:35,847
Just lean it carefully
Against the wall for now.

894
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,685
[ thuds ]
Carefully !

895
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:49,400
G'day, phil.
What's happening, mate ?

896
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:52,243
Hi, mick.
The usual continuity nightmare.

897
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:54,369
Right.

898
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:58,214
What's that mean ?
It means i have
To make this set...

899
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:02,382
Look exactly like it did
On location in yugoslavia.

900
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:07,617
Yugoslavia. Is that where
All these paintings come from ?

901
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:11,261
Yup. They had them
Done there. Dumb.

902
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:15,158
Would've been
Cheaper here
And more realistic.

903
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:19,402
Oh, so none of these
Are valuable.
They're just all copies.

904
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,129
Yup, and rather
Poor ones at that.

905
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:27,196
And these huge,
Tacky frames ?
For god sakes.

906
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:29,867
Don't they usually cart
The sets and the props...

907
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:33,276
From one country
To another and back again ?

908
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,750
Maybe in a big-budget
International movie like
Mission: impossible 3.

909
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,780
But i haven't seen
Tom cruise hanging
Around the set, have you ?

910
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:44,491
Tom cruise.
What's he look like ?

911
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:47,721
Like... Tom cruise.

912
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:52,563
Jeez, mick, were you
Born in a cave ?

913
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:54,756
Yeah !
How did you know that ?

914
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,828
Never mind.

915
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:01,705
Jim, the van goghs are
Down at the wrong end.

916
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:05,208
See, here they started
With the gauguins,
One above the other.

917
01:09:05,242 --> 01:09:07,612
Let's get this right.
We gotta be done
In here tonight.

918
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,684
They're shooting
In here tomorrow.

919
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:23,925
[ sniffs ]

920
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,500
[ mick ]
You see, you can mix heroin
Into a plaster,

921
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,430
Make it any shape you like.

922
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:32,695
So when i see this guy go nuts
Just 'cause they bumped
The lousy painting,

923
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:34,796
That's where i knew
Where the drugs
Were hidden--

924
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:36,808
Molded into
The picture frames.

925
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,240
Pure heroin,
Or as we call it,
"smack."

926
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:43,577
Jeez, mick, you really do
Think like a detective.

927
01:09:43,613 --> 01:09:47,483
Yeah, well, it comes
Sort of natural to me,
You know ?

928
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,687
- hey, mick.
- ah.

929
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:52,819
That was the police lab.

930
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:56,526
Sorry. The frames
Are just plaster.
There's no drugs.

931
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,660
Oh, bugger it.

932
01:09:59,796 --> 01:10:02,296
I was sure
I cracked the case.

933
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:05,402
I don't know.
Maybe they're not
Smuggling anything.

934
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:07,565
Oh, no.
They're sneaking around
With something.

935
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:09,844
I just haven't
Found it yet.

936
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:11,843
Like i read about
This fella,

937
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,545
He used to push
A wheelbarrow
Full of cow dung...

938
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,479
Across the border
Every day.

939
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:19,854
"manure for the garden,"
He'd say.
Went on for months.

940
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:22,693
And the border guards
Knew he was
Smuggling something,

941
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,959
So they'd stop him and they'd
Rake through that manure
With a fine-tooth comb.

942
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:28,629
Never found a thing.

943
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:32,498
Turned out they were right.
He was smuggling something:

944
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,729
Wheelbarrows.

945
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:37,504
Right under their noses.

946
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:41,914
See, it's there, and i'm
Just not seeing it... Yet.
And i will.

947
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,780
Nah. I reckon he was right
The first time. It's drugs.

948
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:50,981
They wouldn't go
To all that trouble
For wheelbarrows.

949
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,559
Cut ! And print.

950
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,395
We'll cut when he throws,
So that went fine.

951
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:09,902
All right !
Well done, paul.

952
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:13,903
[ assistant director ]
Listen, everyone, we do not
Burn down the castle now.

953
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,807
That will be
A second-unit shot tomorrow.

954
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,380
That means everyone
Goes home early
And has tomorrow off.

955
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:22,509
Whoo ! All right !
Okay, see you all friday !

956
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:24,746
First thing !

957
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:41,331
[ man ]
And you've actually seen
These paintings quite recently.

958
01:11:41,365 --> 01:11:42,665
Yeah, today.

959
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:45,839
Well, then than makes it easy.
They're fakes.

960
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:49,809
You can tell that
From the photographs ?
Well, normally, no.

961
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:51,839
But, you see,
These rembrandts...

962
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:54,675
And this, the olive field
By van gogh,

963
01:11:54,711 --> 01:11:56,681
Unfortunately
No longer exist.

964
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:59,983
During the bombing
Of belgrade by nato,

965
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:02,946
The national
Art museum of serbia
Took a direct hit,

966
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:06,416
Burned to the ground
Along with the originals
Of these paintings...

967
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:10,986
And possibly the finest
Collection of old masters
In eastern europe.

968
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:13,827
It was a tragedy
For the art world.

969
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:18,073
Ergo, these must be
Copies, fakes.

970
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:24,067
That, um, belgrade,
Is that in yugoslavia ?

971
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:30,645
- yeah.
- 'cause that's where
These paintings come from.

972
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:34,781
What if it wasn't
An accidental bombing...

973
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:37,988
And someone removed
The paintings first ?

974
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:40,121
Spoils of war ?

975
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:46,898
Maybe i should
Take a look at these.
Could you take me to them ?

976
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:50,030
That's probably impossible.

977
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:54,796
But if i could get one of them
And bring it to you
And it was real,

978
01:12:54,838 --> 01:12:56,908
That means the rest
Are probably real, right ?

979
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:00,610
You must call me
The minute you find one.
I have to see them.

980
01:13:00,644 --> 01:13:03,954
No worries.
Thank you.
Thank you.

981
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:11,024
- hey, who drew this ?
- pablo picasso.

982
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:16,789
I'm a drinking man myself,
But i've never been
That hammered.

983
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:27,501
This'll be a piece of cake.
I know this lot backwards.

984
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:32,038
Wait in the car.
Uh, mick ?

985
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,036
I was gonna say,
"be careful,"

986
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:39,578
But i guess that's
Kind of a dumb thing to say
To someone who hunts crocodiles.

987
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:41,746
No worries.

988
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:55,059
Of course the difference
Is obvious here,

989
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:58,898
But on film,
It's a perfect match.

990
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,695
Isn't it ?
All right,
We have the paintings.

991
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:04,807
Now must we continue
With this stupid
Movie business bullshit ?

992
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:06,781
You really don't get it,
Do you ?

993
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:10,210
God is in the details.

994
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:13,716
These came into the country
As film props.
Anyone wants to see them--

995
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,790
"sorry.
We burned them.

996
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:19,559
Want proof ?
Go see the movie."

997
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:23,489
Dead end. Brilliant.

998
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:39,536
Carl, we need your help.

999
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:49,715
Carl, that painting
Should be covered.

1000
01:14:49,753 --> 01:14:52,123
I'll be with you
In a moment.

1001

- then who the hell is that ?
- [ milos ] stop him !

After him ! Quickly !

01:14:58,061 --> 01:15:01,131
Shoot low !
Don't hit the painting !

1004
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:03,874
After him !
Seal off the lot !

1005
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,900
Quick ! Hold this !
Thanks.
What ?

1006
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,706
He ran in here.
Dravos followed him.

1007
01:15:49,746 --> 01:15:54,546
Cover all the exits.
Go in and help dravos
Flush him out.

1008

[ whispering ]
Shh. I know, i know.
Mick said to wait here.

1009
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:01,863
It's his bust, right ?

1010
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:04,361
I know. I was just looking.

1011
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,333
How'd you get here anyway ?
Who's looking after mikey ?

1012
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:10,103
Miss mathis,
His teacher from school.

1013
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:12,243
I followed you
In her car.

1014
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:57,651
Oh. I'll just
Keep you on hold.

1015
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:00,878
Ah.

1017
01:17:13,229 --> 01:17:16,999
Keep you on hold. Ha !
I just come out with them.

1018
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:21,735
Who is this man ?
How does he--
I think he's the monkey guy.

1019
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:25,071
Mick, the guy that trains
The monkey. Same hat.

1020
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:28,808
How would the monkey guy
Know about the paintings ?

1021
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:31,845
Is he alone ?
You better hope
He's still alive.

1022
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:33,921
Get in there.

1023
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:37,750

You don't have
To be so formal.
We're all friends.

You can...
Lower your hands.

I can't really
Lower this one.

- 'cause if i put

And break eye contact,

And tear you apart.

Can't kill a lion

If you shoot anyone,
They better not bleed.

Lions go berserk
When they smell blood.

She's got pms, i think.
Can see it in her eyes.

Anyway, you do
What you have to do.

To my wife's head.

Huh ?
That's unforgivable.

If you touch me, i will sue you
For every cent you've got.

Were you doing in here ?
Well, i had to.

1097

And i had to come in here
To find a phone to call 911.

You're clever, sue.
I never would've
Thought of that.

She's a dundee.

On the goons and, uh,
Block your ears.

- block your ears.

I was just really scared
For the first time in my life.

1106

Well, that's okay.
Most people are
Frightened of lions.

No, not the lions.
They're just hungry.

1108

It's when i saw that goon
With a gun at your head.

That's when i realized

Well, you do
Rush into things,
Don't you, mick ?

1113

Are you sure it's not
Just the romantic setting ?

Local experts say the value
Of the recovered art...

Could run as high
As $300 million.

Led detectives to the cache
Of stolen masterpieces.

Actually captured the thieves...

On camera.

He did tell me he is, in fact,
A known expert in the art world.
