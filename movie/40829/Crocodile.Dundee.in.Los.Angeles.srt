1
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,126
好了，女士们先生们，请到沃克瑞克酒店。
Okay, ladies and gents, walkabout creek hotel.

2
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,837
这是我们去内陆前最后一次喝冷饮的机会。
Last chance for a coldie before we hit the outback.

3
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:55,843
喂!,。我是你的女主人。
G'day, all. I'm your hostess.

4
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,514
你可以叫我露比或者爱什么的，但绝不能迟到。
You can call me Ruby or love or anything, but never late for breakfast.

5
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,187
你们的乐趣是什么?
And what's your pleasure, folks?

6
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,981
杜松子酒加奎宁水，给这位女士来杯皮姆。
Gin and tonic, please, and a pimm's for the lady.

7
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:10,358
"G"和"t"还有一个皮姆。
"G" and "t" and a pimm's.

8
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,907
不，我要的是金汤力和皮姆。
No, I asked for a gin and tonic and a pimm's.

9
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,534
好吧，问问也无妨。
Yeah, well, there's no harm in asking.

10
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,332
-几杯啤酒就可以了。-就这样，老伙计。
- Couple of beers will be just fine. - That's the ticket, old mate.

11
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,004
——嘿,金块。——喂!,苏。
- Hey, nugget. - G'day, sue.

12
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,175
-米克在哪里?-我们接到巡警的紧急电话。
- Where's Mick? - We got a panic call from the rangers.

13
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:40,679
他们在沙坑的游泳洞里发现了一条巨大的鳄鱼。
They spotted a huge croc in the tarrabool swimming hole.

14
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:45,935
实际上，我们掷硬币看谁能接住，米克赢了。
Actually, we tossed a coin to see who'd catch it, and Mick won.

15
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,646
-他一个人去找的，是吗?——没有。
- He went after it alone, did he? - No.

16
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,523
杰克·杰克逊会在那里见他。
Jacko Jackson's gonna meet him out there.

17
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:54,252
你也知道，小杰是这片区域里第二好的鳄鱼人。
And Jacko, as you know, is the second best crocodile man in the territory.

18
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,486
所以你不用担心，亲爱的。
So you got no worries, love.

19
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,948
我唯一担心的是我需要米克去接米克放学。
Well, my only worry is I need Mick to pick Mikey up after school.

20
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,157
我替你告诉米克。
I'll tell Mick for you.

21
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,416
如果他和那条鳄鱼绑在一起，我就亲自去接他。
If he gets tied up with that croc, I'll pick up the young fella myself.

22
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,578
谢谢。
Thanks.

23
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,289
我以为你是第二好的鳄鱼猎人。
I thought you were the second best crocodile hunter.

24
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:10,584
——哦,好。-他只是谦虚而已。
- Oh, well. - Oh, he's just modest.

25
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,378
他是最棒的，你知道的。
He's one of the best, you know.

26
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,428
嗨,苏。如果米克出了什么事，我就去追他。
Hey, sue. If anything ever happens to Mick, I'm gonna come courting.

27
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,390
希望米克不会出事。
Well, let's just hope nothing happens to Mick.

28
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:48,456
现在，你在哪里，你这个丑陋的大混蛋?
Now, where are you, you big ugly bugger?

29
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,685
这已经是最好的了。
This is as good as it gets.

30
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,959
来吧。到米克叔叔那里来。
Come on. Come to uncle Mick.

31
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,423
大……
Big...

32
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,427
大……
Big...

33
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,680
大错误。
Big mistake.

34
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:57,816
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

35
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:34,186
——喂!,米克。——喂!,“怪人杰克”。
- G'day, Mick. - G'day, Jacko.

36
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,064
你在上面做什么?
What are you doing up there?

37
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,776
我就坐在这里，想着新事业，伙计。
Ah, just sittin' up here, thinking about a new career, mate.

38
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,030
你的船在哪里?
Where's your boat?

39
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,243
在下面。
On the bottom.

40
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,999
-怎么会这样?-鳄鱼把它拉到下面。
- How'd that happen? - Croc pulled it under.

41
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,834
拉下吗?
Pulled it under?

42
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:01,422
它有多大?
How big was it?

43
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:10,806
这么大。
That big.

44
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:15,436
现在怎么办呢?
Now what?

45
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,566
好吧，现在我们，呃，爬上岸，开始计划。“B
Well, now we, uh, scramble ashore and go to plan "."B

46
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,239
不要动。
Don't move.

47
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,995
可能更糟，伙计。
Well, could be worse, mate.

48
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,539
噢,是吗?这是怎么,米克?
Oh, yeah? How's that, Mick?

49
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:41,337
有人会看到我们在这里，在树上，被一条该死的鳄鱼打败。
Well, someone could see us up here, up the tree, outsmarted by a bloody crocodile.

50
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,581
所以我发誓，如果我看到一条蛇，我会死的。
So help me god, if I see a snake, I'm gonna drop dead.

51
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,731
他们要怎么在树上抓鳄鱼呢?
How are they gonna catch a crocodile up there in the tree?

52
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,862
那么，哪个是陆地上第二好的鳄鱼猎手呢?
So, which one is the second best crocodile hunter in the land?

53
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,742
好了，各位，我们时间很紧。
Okay, everyone, we're on a tight schedule here.

54
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,662
我们最好继续走。不想打扰猎人们。
We better keep moving. Don't want to disturb the hunters.

55
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,373
请回到车上，伙计们。
Back on the bus, please, folks.

56
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,626
就是这样。
That's the way.

57
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,761
血腥的金块。太好了,呃,伴侣吗?
Bloody nugget. Great, eh, mate?

58
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,348
整个北部最好的两个鳄鱼猎手，对吧?
Two best crocodile hunters in the entire northern territory, eh?

59
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,558
是的。
Yeah.

60
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,182
我们看起来就像一对真正的鹈鹕，不是吗?
We look like a couple of real pelicans, don't we, eh?

61
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,964
你知道我讨厌鳄鱼什么吗?他们的腿。来吧。
You know what I hate about crocs, mate? They got legs. Come on.

62
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,637
哦，还记得我们以前只会射杀他们的美好时光吗?
Oh, remember the good old days when we just used to shoot 'em?

63
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:20,144
是的。是啊，伙计，但如果没有鳄鱼，它们就不需要猎人了。
Yeah. Yeah, mate, but if there were no more crocs, they wouldn't need hunters.

64
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,773
哦，他们需要猎人。为了控制野猪。
Oh, they'd need hunters. To keep the wild pigs in control.

65
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,818
猪吗?哦，不一样。
Pigs? Oh, not the same.

66
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:31,905
我可不想让我的孩子说"我爸来了，猪邓迪"
I don't want my kid saying, "there goes my dad, pig dundee."

67
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,325
你想被称为“猪杰克逊”吗?
Do you want to be known as porker Jackson?

68
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,410
嗯,没有。
Well, no.

69
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,622
不，我们需要鳄鱼。他们让我们成为大人物。
Nah, we need the crocs, mate. They make us somebodies.

70
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:45,878
没有他们，我们就只是两个腿上有咬痕的老家伙。
Without 'em, we're just a couple of old bushwhackers with bite marks on our legs.

71
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,173
我们明天去找他。同样的时间。
We'll get him tomorrow. Same time.

72
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,301
我认识一个养猪的叫porker o'brien。
Hey, I knew a pig farmer called porker o'brien once.

73
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,220
哈!你知道他们为什么叫他猪吗?
Hah! You know why they called him porker?

74
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,189
我讨厌他那样做。让我毛骨悚然。
I hate it when he does that. Gives me the creeps.

75
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:24,666
——谢谢,伴侣。——不用担心。
- Thanks, mate. - No worries.

76
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,428
你从树上爬下来了，是吧?
So, you got out of that tree all right, eh?

77
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,766
你怎么可能已经知道了呢?
Now, how could you possibly know about that already?

78
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,604
我的族人说话的方式是白人无法理解的。
My people have ways of talking that no white man can understand.

79
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,651
亚瑟，你真是一派胡言。
Arthur, you're so full of bullshit.

80
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,987
不，这是一种心灵感应?
No, it's a kind of mental telepathy, eh?

81
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,614
是的，精神上的，好吧。
Yeah, mental, all right.

82
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:01,745
我想我们已经知道谁是白人了。
Ah, I think we just found out which one of us is the white man.

83
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,163
是吗?
Yeah?

84
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,583
是的，我听说了。
Yeah, I heard about that.

85
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,839
是啊，他现在就站在我旁边。
Yeah, well, he's standin' right next to me now.

86
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:16,301
——哦,太棒了。——嗯,好吧。是的,以后。
- Oh, great. - Yeah, okay. Yeah, later.

87
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,056
-你今晚有演出吗?-是的。
- So, are you doin' a show tonight? - Yeah.

88
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:25,060
日场已经演过了。要让游客开心，对吧?
Already did the matinee. Gotta keep the tourists happy, eh?

89
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,303
好吧，伙计，现在他们是我们的面包和黄油。
Oh, well, mate, these days they're our bread and butter.

90
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:33,193
这就是我们现在在20世纪的情况……旅游景点。
That's sort of what we are now in the 20th century... Tourist attractions.

91
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,488
就像他们说的，那是演艺圈，伙计
As they say, "that's show business, mate."

92
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:41,076
对了，米克，现在是21世纪了。
By the way, Mick, it's the 21st century, mate.

93
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,287
哦,是的,我…我知道。
Oh, yeah, I... I knew that.

94
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,918
见到你,艺术。再见。
See you, art. See you later.

95
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,545
-再见，特洛伊。-再见，麦奇。
- See ya, Troy. - See ya, Mikey.

96
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,046
-想去钓鱼吗?-是的。
- Wanna go fishing? - Yeah.

97
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,929
-你今天学到了什么?-只是学校的东西。
- So, what did you learn today? - Oh, just school stuff.

98
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,434
但是我们有一个地震的视频，我们了解了它们是如何发生在美国加州的。
But we had an earthquake video, and we learned how they happen in California, america.

99
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,896
-你在那里看到了吗?-不，我在纽约。
- Did you see one when you were there? - No, I was in New York.

100
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,355
那里没有地震。
They don't have earthquakes there.

101
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:18,697
那里的人不会容忍的。他们会说:“地震?嘿，这里是布鲁克林。
People there wouldn't stand for it. They'd be like, "Earthquake? Hey, this is Brooklyn.

102
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,035
- "-滚出去。-算了吧。”
- "- Get outta here. - Forget about it."

103
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,119
他们艰难的。
They're tough.

104
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:30,292
哇,作业时间。那是什么?
Whoa, homework time. What's that?

105
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:36,757
-它要大便了。-说明他就在附近找到他。
- It's goanna turd. - That means he's close by. Find him.

106
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,937
-他来了。——是的。
- There he is. - Yep.

107
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:03,909
你饿了吗?想和他共进晚餐吗?-恶心，没门。
- You hungry? Want him for dinner? - Yuck, no way.

108
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,454
-那你最好失手。-爸爸，我从不失手。
- Well, you better miss then. - Dad, I never miss.

109
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,047
哇。
Whoa.

110
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:21,009
快，爸爸，上面有条大蜥蜴。你能做到吗?
Quick, dad, there's a big razorback up there. Can you do it?

111
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,887
——做什么?-你知道的，那个把戏。请。
- Do what? - You know, that trick. Please.

112
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,828
好吧，但如果你害怕就没用了。他会闻到的。
All right, but it won't work if you're scared. He'll smell it.

113
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,809
我知道。我不会害怕的。我保证。
I know. I won't be scared. I promise.

114
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,602
在我找到他之前，不要看他。
Don't look at him till I do.

115
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,022
如果我能拿着你的刀，我就不怕了。
I really won't be scared if I can carry your knife.

116
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,264
酷。
Cool.

117
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,744
好吧，爸爸，我会和米克商量的。啊哈。
Okay, dad, I'll talk it over with Mick. Uh-huh.

118
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:36,960
不。不，如果我们决定要结婚，我保证第一个告诉你。
No. No, and if we decide we need to be married, I promise you'll be the first to know.

119
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:44,176
你想跟你孙子打个招呼吗?好吧。坚持下去。
Would you like to say hello to your grandson? Okay. Hang on.

120
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,637
嗨,米奇。过来跟爷爷问好。
Hey, Mikey. Come say hi to grandpa.

121
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,684
嗨,爷爷。
Hi, grandpa.

122
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,562
很好,是的。
Pretty good, yeah.

123
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,357
所以,有什么新鲜事吗?
So, what's new?

124
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,070
汤姆·泽特兰，他负责。爸爸的报纸。
Oh, Tom zetland, he ran the la. Bureau of dad's paper.

125
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,363
刚死于一场车祸。
Was just killed in a car accident.

126
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,866
-他是你的朋友吗?——事实上,没有。
- What, was he a mate of yours? - Actually, no.

127
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:15,957
但问题是，米克，爸爸现在求我代替他的位置他要找一个永久的替代者。
But the thing is, Mick, dad is now pleading with me to take his place while he looks for a permanent replacement.

128
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:21,129
你的意思是你爸爸想让你去洛杉矶为他工作。
So, what you're sayin' is your dad wants you to go and work for him in Los Angeles.

129
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,007
多长时间?
For how long?

130
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,680
我跟他说我可以顶替他几周。
Well, I told him I might fill in for a few weeks.

131
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:41,775
告诉我，如果我们住在城里，你会接受那份工作吗?——哦,当然。
Well, tell me this, if we lived over there in the city, - would you take the job then? - Oh, sure.

132
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:49,241
我是说，我是被一个新闻记者养大的，我也不知道，我想这已经渗入了你的血液。
I mean, I was raised by a newspaperman, and, well, I don't know, I guess it just gets in your blood.

133
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,994
那就这么定了。接受这份工作。
That settles it then. Take the job.

134
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,832
至少在今年剩下的时间里是这样。我和小麦奇会和你一起去。
At least for the rest of the year. Me and young Mikey will go with you.

135
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:01,169
你在开玩笑吧。——没有。为他好。帮助他做决定。
- You're kidding. - No. Be good for him. Help him decide.

136
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,379
决定?
Decide?

137
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,775
-你爸爸开了家报纸，对吧?——嗯。
- Well, your dad owns a newspaper, right? - Mm-hmm.

138
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,177
你是他唯一的孩子。总有一天麦奇要做出决定。
You're his only child. Someday Mikey's gonna have to decide.

139
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:14,099
他是想当一名鳄鱼饲养员助理，还是想当一份大城市报纸的老板?
Does he want to be an assistant crocodile wrangler, or the owner of a big-city newspaper?

140
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,978
这个问题很难。旅行对他有好处。
That's a tough one. And the travel will be good for him.

141
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:23,692
还记得我的纽约之旅是如何让我看清世界的吗?
Remember how my trip to New York sort of opened my eyes to the ways of the world?

142
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,529
让我更…这个词是什么?
Made me a lot more... what's the word?

143
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,158
——复杂的?-是的。
- Sophisticated? - Yeah.

144
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,180
对了，米克，你要那个可怕的陷阱干什么?
By the way, Mick, what are you doing with that awful trap?

145
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,165
你不会把它用在可怜的动物身上吧?
You're not going to use that on some poor animal?

146
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,624
不，我要借给唐克。
No, I'm lending it to donk.

147
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,128
有个杂种晚上偷偷溜进酒吧喝他的烈酒。
Some mongrel's been sneaking into the pub at night and knocking off his grog.

148
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,424
偷唐克的啤酒，我想他们是活该。
Stealing donk's beer, well, I guess they deserve to be mangled.

149
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,675
是的。
Yeah.

150
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,469
那你呢，麦奇?你觉得呢?
Well, what about you, Mikey? What do you think?

151
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,727
你想去加州住一段时间吗?
How would you like to go live in California for a while?

152
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,480
-那里有地震，对吧?-是的，他们有。
- They have earthquakes there, right? - Well, yeah, they have had.

153
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,232
酷。
Cool.

154
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:08,236
我就知道你会这么说。你会玩得很开心的。
I thought you might say that. You're gonna have lots of fun.

155
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,032
事实上，我担心的是你。
Actually, you're the one I'm worried about.

156
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,286
不,我很好。
No, I'm fine.

157
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:25,337
米克，我好像记得在纽约待了几周后你确实很烦躁。
Um, Mick, I seem to remember after a few weeks in New York you did get pretty antsy.

158
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,089
是啊，有点坐立不安。
Yeah, a bit antsy.

159
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:33,470
这就是我喜欢你的地方，米克。你总是那么无私。
Mm, that's what I love about you, Mick. You're always so unselfish.

160
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,723
不用担心。
No worries.

161
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,116
是的
Yeah

162
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:02,082
跳舞，跳舞，跳舞，跳舞
yeah, dance, dance, dance, dance

163
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,939
-比弗利山，对吧?-电影明星的故乡。
- Ah, Beverly Hills, eh? - Home to the movie stars.

164
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,471
是的，有很多。
A lot of 'em, yep.

165
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,859
你不是演艺圈的，对吧?
You're not in show business, are ya?

166
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,736
不，我自己也在旅游行业。
No, I'm in the tourism game myself.

167
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,029
-我也是-嘿
- Hey, so am I. - Hey.

168
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,574
当我开车出去的时候。实际上，我是个作家兼演员。
When I'm out driving this. Actually, though, I'm a writer-actor.

169
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,753
在演出间隙开豪华轿车就行了。
Just, you know, drive the limo between gigs.

170
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,911
做很多连接。
Make a lot of connections.

171
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,205
今早汤姆·阿诺德在车里。
Had Tom Arnold in the car this morning.

172
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,581
汤姆·阿诺德?
Tom Arnold?

173
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,002
他老婆可能知道他是谁。
Oh, wife probably knows who he is.

174
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:48,753
她的……她在报社工作。
She's... she's in the newspaper business.

175
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,672
——一位记者。-是的。
- A reporter. - Yeah.

176
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,508
来，拿一个。你永远不会知道的。
Here, take one of these. You never know.

177
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,722
谢谢。
Thanks.

178
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,644
那就这样吧。
There you go.

179
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,483
那这很好。
That... that's nice.

180
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,902
不，你留着吧。我有很多副本。
No, you can keep that. I got plenty of copies.

181
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,280
住嘴!
Knock it off!

182
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:11,252
-好吧，减税计划。-只收取州税。没有兴趣。
- Okay, tax relief plan. - State tax only. No interest there.

183
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:12,879
交通事故。
Traffic accidents.

184
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:17,175
好的，这些数字比较la。对纽约的司机来说，这很好。
Okay, these figures comparing la. To New York drivers, that's good.

185
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:18,968
坚持下去。
Follow through on that.

186
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,179
太好了。那么我们的政策没有改变?
Great. So our policy hasn't changed then?

187
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,305
所以如何?
How so?

188
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:25,687
就像泽特兰先生常说的，我们是一家纽约报纸。
Well, it's like Mr. Zetland used to say, "We're a New York paper.

189
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,520
"如果新闻都不是关于纽约的，那谁会在乎呢"
"If the news ain't about New York, then who gives a rat's ass?"

190
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,438
或者类似的话。
Or words to that effect.

191
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,650
他在洛杉矶工作不太开心，是吧?
So he wasn't too happy about working in la, huh?

192
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,568
哦,不,不。汤姆喜欢这里。
Oh, no, no. Tom loved it here.

193
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:40,615
不，他喜欢做exposé专题和调查骗局和骗子。
No, he loved doing exposé features and investigating scams and phonies.

194
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,450
他在研究什么?
What was he working on?

195
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:47,914
他在为一个新的迷你工作室做专题报道。
He was doing this feature on this new mini studio.

196
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,208
他开始对此感到非常兴奋。
He started to get really excited about it.

197
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,794
我想他觉得事情不对劲。
I think he smelled a rat.

198
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,714
但究竟是怎么回事，只有汤姆知道。给你。
But what it was about, only Tom knew. Here you go.

199
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:03,012
也许你能找出是什么引起了他的兴趣。祝你好运。
Maybe you can find out what sparked his interest in there. Good luck.

200
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,978
你的孩子们还好吗?他们出去“探索”了吗?
Oh, hey, how are your boys doing? Are they out "exploring"?

201
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,357
哦,是的。应该也很有趣。对他们俩来说都是。
Oh, yeah. Should be fun, too. For both of them.

202
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:23,700
来吧，大家，我们…谢谢你！哦，自发的掌声，谢谢。
Come on, people, let's... Thank you. Oh, spontaneous applause, thank you.

203
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,209
谢谢你！
Thank you.

204
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,672
好吧，几个小技巧。在回来。
All right, a couple of tricks. Behind the back.

205
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,514
好了，好了，腿下面。
All right, all right, all right, under the leg.

206
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,629
嘿,爸爸,看。那是《海滩游侠》里的女孩。
Hey, dad, look. There's those girls from baywatch.

207
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:18,713
什么?
What?

208
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:22,842
挑战。在电视上，你知道?跑得很滑稽的女孩，像这样。
Baywatch. On TV, you know? The girls that run funny, like this.

209
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,222
唐克和酒吧里所有的男人都说"哇"
And donk and all the men in the pub go, "whoa!"

210
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,225
-你在酒吧干什么?——哇!嘿!
- What've you been doing in the pub? - Whoa! Hey!

211
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,018
我很抱歉。
I am so sorry.

212
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,895
——没关系。-肌肉疲劳。
- It's okay. - Whew, muscle fatigue.

213
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,227
-你还好吧?-你知道现在几点了吗?
- You all right? - Hey, do you know what time it is?

214
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:40,276
哦，大约12:30，也许12:35。
Oh, it's about 12:30, maybe 12:35.

215
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,029
真可爱，但你戴了块表。
Oh, that's cute, but you're wearing a watch.

216
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:46,241
-哦，那不是手表，是指南针。——哦!
- Oh, that's not a watch, it's a compass. - Oh!

217
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:49,118
是的，我是新来的。没有这个我找不到我的房子。
Yeah, I'm new in town. I just couldn't find my house without this.

218
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,746
真的吗?你家离这有多远?
Really? So where's your house from here?

219
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:57,252
11.5英里，东北偏北2度。打电话到比弗利山庄。
11.5 miles, two degrees north northeast. Called, uh, Beverly Hills.

220
00:22:57,502 --> 00:23:00,380
贝福山吗?你有个漂亮的家?
Bev hills? So, you have a nice home?

221
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:04,467
-是啊，我们有8个丹尼。-是啊，一共八个浴室。
- Yeah, we got eight dunnies. - Yeah, that's, uh, eight bathrooms.

222
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:07,470
——哦,不错。这个…这你的男孩吗?-是的，那是麦奇。
- Oh, nice. This... this your boy? - Yeah, that's Mikey.

223
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,766
-你结婚了?-不，他还没结婚。
- So, you married? - No, he's not married.

224
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,103
-所以你得到了监护权?-是的。麦奇是我儿子。
- So you got custody? - Yeah. Well, Mikey's my son.

225
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,939
——正确的。所以你是个好家长?-嗯，我想说。
- Right. So you're a good parent? - Well, I would say.

226
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:22,777
正确的。哦，这太好了。我终于遇到了一个可爱的牛仔。
Right. Oh, this is too good. I finally bump into a cute cowboy.

227
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:29,742
他更像罗伯特·雷德福，而不是布拉德·皮特，但没关系，因为他在比佛利山庄有栋豪宅，而且他还有孩子的监护权。
He's a little more Robert redford's vintage than Brad Pitt's, but that's okay, 'cause he's got a mansion in Beverly Hills, plus he's got custody of his kid.

228
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:33,533
这意味着他会是我辛迪的好爸爸，这是…哦，有圈套，对吧?
That means he'd be a good dad to my Cindy and this is... Oh, there's a catch, right?

229
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,832
我从没遇到过这么好的事。
Nothing this good ever happens to me.

230
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:40,003
你是…你不是?你……你是同性恋,对吧?
Are you... you're not available? You're... you're gay, right?

231
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,423
大部分时间，我都很开心。
Um, most of the time, pretty happy, yeah.

232
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,966
当然可以。
Of course.

233
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,219
可爱的牛仔，威尼斯海滩，肯定是同性恋。
Cute cowboy, venice beach, had to be gay.

234
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,804
我在想什么呢?
What was I thinking?

235
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:56,144
-天啊，她真是个话匣子。——是的,伴侣。一个美国女人。
- Boy, she was a chatterbox. - Yeah, mate. Uh, an American woman.

236
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,982
-她的屁股很漂亮-是啊
- She's got a nice ass. - Yeah.

237
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,319
嘿，你不能再去酒吧了。
Hey, you gotta stop hangin' around that pub.

238
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:08,948
谁教你的?金块吗?
Who taught you that? Nugget?

239
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:15,747
-发现什么可疑的东西了吗?-是的。听这个。
- Find anything fishy? - Yeah. Listen to this.

240
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:20,251
Silvergate影业制作了他们的第一部电影，对吧?致命的代理。
Silvergate pictures make their first movie, right? Lethal agent.

241
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,628
这完全是个炸弹。
It's a total bomb.

242
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:27,884
所以他们拍的下一部电影是《致命特工2》…当然，它直接被拍成了没人租的视频。
So the very next picture they make is lethal agent ii... Which, of course, goes straight to video where no one rents it.

243
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,388
猜猜他们现在在做什么来保住自己的名声?
And guess what they're doing now to save their reputation?

244
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,515
——嗯…-是的。
- Uh... - Yeah.

245
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,269
我不知道。汤姆和这些人谈过吗?
I don't know. Did Tom talk to these guys?

246
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:42,774
嗯,是的。我的意思是，我想他和所有演播室的人都谈过。
Well, yeah. I mean, I think he spoke to everybody from the president of the studio down.

247
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,259
这时他似乎对这个故事感到非常兴奋。
That's when he seemed to get really excited about the story.

248
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,573
我现在看到的都是些愚蠢的商业决策。
All I can see here is a bunch of really dumb business decisions.

249
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,450
当然，这并不违法。
But, of course, that's not illegal.

250
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,036
这是我为他做的研究。
Well, you know, that's the research that I did for him.

251
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,872
汤姆在研究的东西可能就在他的电脑里。
Whatever Tom was working on is probably in his PC.

252
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,750
如果你有兴趣，我可以从他家拿到光盘。
So, I could get the disk from his house, if you're interested.

253
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:01,959
那就好了。
That'd be great.

254
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,755
我注意到他们在进行"见面和问候"
And I notice they're having a "meet and greet"

255
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,548
为媒体和行业人士。
for press and industry people.

256
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:10,134
你知道一般都是谁负责吗?
Do you know who would normally cover that?

257
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,928
费伊·奥尔森从事娱乐。
Fay Olson does entertainment.

258
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,264
好吧。告诉她今晚可以休息，我来顶替。
Okay. Tell her she can have the night off, and I'll fill in.

259
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:24,399
-嘿，爸爸，那是什么车?-我现在不能看，伙计。
- Hey, dad, what sort of car is that? - I can't look now, mate.

260
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:33,050
这些加州人又好又友好又有礼貌。直到他们上了车，然后就变成了疯狂的袋熊。-快，爸爸，停下!
These California people are nice and friendly and polite... Till they get in their cars, - then they turn into crazed wombats. - Quick, dad, stop!

261
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,514
-路上有只狗。——在哪里?
- There's a dog in the road. - Where?

262
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,008
-那狗呢?-他躲进去了。
- So where's the dog? - He ducked in there.

263
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,301
我会让他。
I'll get him.

264
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,415
小心些而已。
Be careful.

265
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:03,187
好了，各位，退后。别担心，我们会抓到他的。
All right, everybody, stay back. Don't worry, we'll get him.

266
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:05,773
我在它。
I'm on it.

267
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,210
-上面到底发生了什么?-加油，伙计!
- What's the hell's going on up there? - Come on, buddy!

268
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,914
那人说路上有东西。
The guy said there's something on the road.

269
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:11,362
我看他像个疯子。
He looks like a nut to me.

270
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,906
-可能是炸弹之类的。-是什么?
- Probably a bomb or something. - It's a what?

271
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,452
-他说有炸弹!-是炸弹!它会打击!
- He says it's a bomb! - It's a bomb! It's gonna blow!

272
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,792
过来,男孩。来吧。
Come here, boy. Come on.

273
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,879
他不肯出来。他是害怕。
He won't come out. He's scared.

274
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:35,470
那不是狗。这是一个…我不知道这是什么。可能是某种负鼠。
That's not a dog. That's a... I don't know what it is. Some kind of possum maybe.

275
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,639
我从没见过黑白负鼠。
I've never seen a black and white possum.

276
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,183
我想是一只臭鼬。
I think it's a skunk.

277
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,865
你怎么知道臭鼬长什么样?我们家里没有。
How do you know what a skunk looks like? We don't have 'em at home.

278
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,606
看起来就像电视卡通片里的佩佩勒皮尤。
It looks like pepe le pew in the cartoons on TV.

279
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:50,777
我还以为臭鼬很臭呢。
I thought skunks were supposed to stink.

280
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,863
不臭。
Don't stink.

281
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,663
来吧,男孩。来吧。
Come on, boy. Come on.

282
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:20,473
得到了反应……可能有爆炸装置和人质。
Got the response... Possible explosive device and hostage situation.

283
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,058
好了。
There we go.

284
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,061
难怪他害怕。
No wonder he's scared.

285
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,688
那些血腥直升机。
Those bloody helicopters.

286
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,609
起飞!
Take off!

287
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,031
这里的情况对警方来说很棘手。
We have a very tricky situation for the police here.

288
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:39,992
嫌疑犯似乎挟持了一个小男孩作为人质。
The suspect appears to be holding a young boy hostage.

289
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,081
待在原地别动!
Stay where you are!

290
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,333
把炸弹放下!
Put the bomb down!

291
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,501
什么?
What?

292
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:53,548
那不是炸弹。这是一只猫。
That's not a bomb. That's a cat.

293
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:01,180
啊，看，就像在家里一样。警察是你的朋友。
Ah, see, just like at home. The policeman is your friend.

294
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,390
他们是来帮助我们的。
They're here to help us.

295
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,603
那不是猫。这是一个臭鼬。
That's not a cat. That's a skunk.

296
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,066
接下来交给你们了，伙计们。
You can take it from here, guys.

297
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:13,568
嗯。
Uh-uh.

298
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,029
迈克，我不会跟你妈妈说的。
Uh, Mike, I wouldn't mention this to your mum.

299
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,950
她可能不会理解。这是男人的东西。
She probably wouldn't understand. It's man stuff.

300
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:28,708
当然，在那个阶段，今天下午早些时候，我们不知道炸弹实际上是一只臭鼬。
And of course, at that stage, early this afternoon, we had no idea that the bomb was, in fact, a skunk.

301
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:34,463
警官们不情愿地把这只臭鼬放进了一辆警车里，等待动物管理人员的到来。
Officers reluctantly placed the skunk in a squad car to await the arrival of animal control.

302
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:39,051
与此同时，它阻塞了101公路的交通…从卡拉巴萨斯到帕萨迪纳。
In the meantime, it backed up traffic on the 101... From calabasas to Pasadena.

303
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:44,098
这是最严重的交通堵塞。-你在干什么，麦奇?-没事，亲爱的，是我
It was the worst traffic jam... - What are you doing, Mikey? - Uh, it's okay, love, it's me.

304
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,894
哦。米克，你确定今晚要来吗?
Oh. Mick, are you sure you want to come tonight?

305
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:51,480
我是说，这是社交活动，但对我来说是工作。
I mean, it's a social thing, but it'll be work for me.

306
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:52,899
是的，我很期待。
Yeah, I'm looking foward to it.

307
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:56,110
你知道，看看当地人是否像纽约人一样友好。
You know, to see if the local people are as friendly as new yorkers.

308
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,946
我希望你儿子也这么想。
Well, I hope your son feels the same way.

309
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,573
他星期三开始上学。
He starts school on Wednesday.

310
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:05,870
哦,不用担心。他是…他就像我一样，真的。
Oh, no worries. He's, uh... He's just like me, really.

311
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:10,833
据我所知，他有足够的魅力阻止臭鼬喷他。
From what I hear, he has enough charm to stop a skunk from spraying him.

312
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:14,086
是啊，你知道的，我们在高速公路上咆哮…——没关系。
Yeah, well, you know, - we were roarin' down the freeway... - It's okay.

313
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:19,759
-他在电视上看起来很可爱。——血腥的电视。
- He looked really cute on TV. - Bloody television.

314
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,535
这次不行，伙计。
Not this time, pal.

315
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:50,414
-米克!-叫警察!
- Mick! - Call the cops!

316
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:53,834
让他走。他是管家。他应该停车的。
Let him go. He's the valet. He's supposed to park the car.

317
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,461
对，对，放松点，伙计。
Yeah, yeah, take it easy, dude.

318
00:29:58,714 --> 00:29:59,715
——提示他。——对不起。
- Tip him. - Sorry.

319
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:05,179
——诚实的错误。——对不起。
- Honest mistake. - Sorry.

320
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,475
代客吗?
Valet?

321
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:17,775
——图片,请。——确定。
- Picture, please. - Sure.

322
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:23,683
各位不介意我们打一针吧?
Folks mind if we get a shot?

323
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:25,992
别为我担心。
Don't worry about me.

324
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,827
我去拿杯酒，融入人群。
I'll just get a drink, blend right in.

325
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,911
好吧。
Okay.

326
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,747
我办完手续就来接你。
I'll come and get you after I've done the formalities.

327
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,357
请对着镜头笑一个。
Big smile for the camera, please.

328
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:55,604
好了，这是你的依云，这是你的气泡矿泉水。
All right, that's your evian, and this here's your sparkling mineral water with a twist.

329
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,189
再来杯纯苏打水。
Oh, and a straight club soda.

330
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,862
你是在喝酒还是在洗衣服?
So, you havin' a drink or doin' your laundry?

331
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,076
喂!。米克敦提。
G'day. Mick dundee.

332
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,494
——和你……——托尼。
- And you're... - Tony.

333
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:11,978
您要点什么，邓迪先生?
What can I get for you, Mr. Dundee?

334
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:13,831
来杯冰啤酒就行了，伙计。谢谢。
Just a cold beer will do, mate. Thanks.

335
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:18,210
这是典型的la。今天。健康的坚果。
That's typical of la. Today. Health nuts.

336
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,297
担心他们喝什么，吃什么。
Worried about what they drink, worried about what they eat.

337
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,217
我以前也是这样，直到我找到了答案。
I used to be like that till I found the answer.

338
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:29,889
哦?嗯，答案是什么?
Oh? And, um, what's the answer?

339
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:31,182
咖啡。
Coffee.

340
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:35,436
随便吃什么，喝什么，然后用咖啡冲掉。
Eat and drink whatever you please and then flush it out with coffee.

341
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,230
所以你喝了很多咖啡。
So you just drink lots of coffee.

342
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:43,611
不。你不喝。我在说灌肠法。
No. You don't drink it. I'm talking colonics.

343
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,698
好的咖啡灌肠会让你变得很干净。
A good coffee enema leaves you clean as a whistle.

344
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,201
干杯。
Bottoms up.

345
00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:01,879
嗨,托尼。一个灌肠…那不是他们把水管塞进老…——是的。
Hey, Tony. An enema... Isn't that where they shove a hose - up the old... - Yep.

346
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,549
-很多人都很喜欢-配咖啡吗
- Lots of people swear by 'em. - With coffee?

347
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:12,014
-加奶和糖?——这是洛杉矶
- Cream and sugar? - It's L.A.

348
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,020
打扰一下，罗斯曼先生。
Excuse me, Mr. Rothman.

349
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,066
我想给你介绍个人。
I'd love to introduce you to someone.

350
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,944
我是《新闻日报》的苏·查尔顿女士。
This is Ms. Sue charleton from newsday.

351
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,822
- - - - - -你好。——3:21 rothman。很高兴。
- Hello. - Arnan rothman. Delighted.

352
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:32,034
迪迪告诉我你取代了我们已故的朋友汤姆·泽特兰。
Didi tells me that you've replaced our late friend, Tom zetland.

353
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,494
——对不起。-太可惜了。
- Excuse me. - That's a damn shame.

354
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,914
他是个好人，对这一行很在行。
He was a good man and he really knew his way around this business.

355
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,751
嗯，恐怕在这方面我有点欠缺。
Well, I'm afraid I come up a bit short in that department.

356
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:44,839
其实，我希望你能帮我个忙。
Actually, I was hoping maybe you could help me out.

357
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,554
-你是这部电影的演员吗?——我吗?不，我在社交。
- Are you in the cast of this flick? - Me? Oh, no, I'm, uh, socializing.

358
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:54,473
网络。我也是。你看过这些杰作吗?
Networking. Me, too. Have you seen any of these masterpieces?

359
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,768
——没有。-不要令人难以置信的垃圾。我不骗你。
- No. - Dont unbelievable schlock. I kid you not.

360
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:59,854
让你在这一行感到尴尬。
Makes you embarrassed to be in the business.

361
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:03,190
我所见过的比致命特工更可怕的是致命特工2号。
The only thing I've seen worse than lethal agent was lethal agent ii.

362
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,732
我读了这部电影的剧本，结果更糟。
I read the script on this one, and it's even worse.

363
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,616
我不知道这些小丑是怎么做生意的。
I don't know how these clowns stay in business.

364
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,471
我想你已经听说了，他们在制造致命的四号特工。
I suppose you've heard, then, they're making lethal agent iv.

365
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,367
什么?
What?

366
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,912
没人告诉我。你知道他们选角了吗?
No one told me. Do you know if they're casting yet?

367
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,165
我要打电话给我的经纪人。
I gotta call my agent.

368
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:26,338
我打算继续汤姆的故事，更多的是关于你们电影公司，而不是这部电影。
I'm planning on following through on Tom's story, more about your film company than this particular film.

369
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,632
-我们在希腊拍的。——哦!
- We shot the whole thing in Greece. - Oh!

370
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,265
请允许我介绍米洛斯·德鲁布尼克，我们的国际副总裁。
Allow me to introduce milos drubnick, our international vice president.

371
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,349
苏charleton。
Sue charleton.

372
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,352
我很高兴见到美国电影明星。
I'm delighted to meet American movie star.

373
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:41,979
我是你的超级粉丝，你所有的电影。
I'm a big fan, all your films.

374
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:45,482
你真是太好了，但我是个记者。
Well, that's very kind of you, but I'm a journalist.

375
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,693
苏的《新闻日报》。
Sue's from newsday.

376
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:50,613
嗯。
Huh.

377
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,324
米洛斯负责我们在东欧的所有业务。
Milos handles all our eastern European activity.

378
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,284
没有他我没法在那里工作。
I could not work over there without him.

379
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,661
你会原谅我。
You'll excuse me.

380
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,126
好吧，我不想占用你所有的时间。
Well, I don't want to monopolize all your time here.

381
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:08,255
我希望我们能在演播室见面，方便的时候。——当然。
I was hoping we could catch up at the studio - when it's convenient. - Absolutely.

382
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,532
这就是他们做事的方式。
That's just the way they do things.

383
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,220
你不会想要的，亲爱的。
You don't want that, love.

384
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,664
吃点免费的食物吧。你会感觉好多了。
Get some of that free food in you. You'll feel a lot better.

385
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,266
不客气
You're welcome.

386
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:25,564
-嘿，你来自澳大利亚，对吧?-是的。
- Hey, you're from down under, right? - Yeah.

387
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,192
我猜你不认识梅尔·吉布森。
I don't suppose you know Mel Gibson.

388
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,905
梅尔·吉布森?应该。两次保释他出狱。
Mel Gibson? Ought to. Bailed him out of jail twice.

389
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,282
你在开玩笑吧。你真的认识他?
You're kidding. You really do know him?

390
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,576
我可以给你讲讲疯狂梅尔的故事。
Oh, I could tell you some tales about mad Mel.

391
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:38,827
请做。
Please do.

392
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:43,457
我记得你说过我们不会再跟这些八卦的《新闻日报》打交道了。
I thought you said we were finished with these prying newsday people.

393
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,877
她只是在跟进原来的报道。我将处理它。
She'sjust following up on the original story. I'll handle it.

394
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:49,588
不。现在她想在演播室四处窥探。
No. Now she want to come snooping around the studio.

395
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:50,839
你应该拒绝。
You should say no.

396
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,342
听着，我们是新来的，对吧?
Look, we're the new boys in town, right?

397
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,511
我们应该求公众关注。
We're supposed to be begging for publicity.

398
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,888
如果我们开始禁止媒体，他们就会到处找我们。
We start banning the press, they're gonna be all over us.

399
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,683
这件事交给我吧。
Leave this to me.

400
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,645
于是他脱了鞋……-哦，谢谢，托尼。——欢迎你。
So he takes his shoes off... - Oh, thanks, Tony. - You're welcome.

401
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,856
光着身子跑到外面。
Runs outside stark naked.

402
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:12,027
放火烧了那栋楼，把它烧成平地。
Sets fire to the building and burns it to the bloody ground.

403
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:16,657
他是个疯子。
He's a mad bugger.

404
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:20,369
原谅我。
Excuse me.

405
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,331
梅尔·吉布森最好的朋友。实际上他们是兄弟。
Mel Gibson's best friend. They're practically brothers.

406
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,626
我见过他们在一起……只是给他们讲一些梅尔·吉布森的故事。
I've seen them together... Just tellin' 'em a few tales about Mel Gibson.

407
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,629
-你不了解梅尔·吉布森。-是的，我喜欢。
- You don't know Mel Gibson. - Yeah, I do.

408
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,840
你也认识他。我们是在唐克的酒吧认识的。
You know him, too. Met him at donk's pub.

409
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,802
梅尔·吉布森，高个子，红头发，走路一瘸一拐。
Mel Gibson, tall redheaded fellow, walks with a limp.

410
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:41,432
哦,“发作”。马尔科姆·吉布森。梅尔·吉布森。
Oh, "mal." Malcolm Gibson. Not Mel Gibson.

411
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,558
是的,mal吉布森。
Yeah, mal Gibson.

412
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,145
这里的人都知道他。世界真小，不是吗?
They know about him over here. Small world, isn't it?

413
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,191
嗨,米克。米克，随时给我打电话。
Hey, Mick. Mick, you give me a call anytime.

414
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,030
好吧,伙计。嘿，也许我们可以一起吃午饭。
Okay, dude. Hey, maybe we'll do lunch.

415
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:02,328
-米克，你吓到我了。-我喜欢好莱坞。
- Oh, Mick, you're starting to scare me. - I like Hollywood.

416
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,292
下午好。欢迎来到比佛利山庄。
Good afternoon. Welcome to Beverly Hills.

417
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:09,877
谢谢。
Thanks.

418
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,342
你关于电影公司的报道刚火了。
So, your story on the film company just got red hot.

419
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:19,470
汤姆·泽特兰的家被抢了，他们拿走了所有东西。
Tom zetland's place was robbed, and they took everything.

420
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:24,350
天啊，太可怕了。但这是如何让故事变得火热的呢?
Oh, my god, that's terrible. But how does it make the story hot?

421
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,102
汤姆不小心被杀了。
Well, Tom is accidentally killed.

422
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:31,774
巧合的是，他的房子被清理干净了，没有留下任何关于他工作的线索。
Coincidentally, his place is cleaned out, leaving no clues to what he's working on.

423
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:37,404
也许汤姆有重大企图，他们不得不让他闭嘴。
Maybe Tom was on to something big, and they had to shut him up.

424
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,324
你觉得是拍电影的人杀了他?
You think the film people had him killed?

425
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:42,951
这是有可能的。
It's possible.

426
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:46,246
我从一开始就有不祥的预感。
I had a bad vibe about this from the start.

427
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,755
我觉得你出去的时候应该小心点。
I think you should be careful going out there.

428
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,127
我可不想去黑手党的大本营。
Well, I'm not exactly going into a mafia stronghold.

429
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,922
我在采访片场的一个负责人。
I'm interviewing a studio head on the lot.

430
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,633
我甚至带着我的家人一起来。他们要去巡演。
I'm even bringing my family along. They're gonna do the tour.

431
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:13,399
好吧，那好吧。女士们先生们，男孩女孩们，欢迎来到派拉蒙电影之旅。
Well, all righty, then. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, boy and girls, to the Paramount pictures tour.

432
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,776
这里就是奇迹发生的地方，各位。
This is where the magic happens, people.

433
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:20,155
但在我们开始之前，我要请大家举起右手。
But before we actually begin, I'm gonna ask you all to raise your right hand.

434
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:29,957
好的,很酷。现在你将要见证的是电影制作的一些最大的秘密。
Okay, cool. Now what you're about to witness are some of the biggest secrets of moviemaking.

435
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:34,545
所以我必须要求你们所有人发誓，不要泄露今天你们在这里看到的任何事情。
So I must ask that all of you swear not to reveal anything you may witness here today.

436
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:37,089
你发誓吗?
Do you swear?

437
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,552
呃,只是……就说，“我愿意。”
Uh, just... just say, "I do."

438
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,221
——我做的。——好的。
- I do. - Okay.

439
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:45,722
阿右ho,吉姆。
Righty ho, Jim.

440
00:37:55,399 --> 00:38:06,243
哦，哇，各位，你们今天在这里会得到特别的待遇，因为就在前面，我们实际上正在拍摄一个巨大的人群场景，为silvergate工作室最新的电影《致命特工病》拍摄。
Oh, wow, you're in for a special treat here today, people, 'cause just up ahead we're actually filming a giant crowd scene for the latest silvergate studio picture, lethal agent ill.

441
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,120
我就说我们应该去环球影城。
I told you we should've gone to universal.

442
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:15,043
原因很简单，前两部电影的亏损被摊销到特许经营的成本中。
Because quite simply, losses on the first two movies are amortized into the cost of the franchise.

443
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:18,255
我们拍这部电影几乎是无偿的。
We're making this movie for practically nothing.

444
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:25,846
好吧，但是，在这里或东欧拍电影不是比在两个地方都拍更便宜吗?
Okay, but still, wouldn't it be cheaper to make your films either here or in Eastern Europe instead of both places?

445
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,599
当然，但我们的电影是以东欧为背景的。
Sure, but our movies are set in Eastern Europe.

446
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,601
你不能伪造地点吗?
You can't fake the locations here?

447
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,729
我是说，他们在隔壁拍摄非洲丛林。
I mean, they're shooting an African jungle next door.

448
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,815
苏，我们能私下谈谈吗?
Sue, can you and I talk off the record?

449
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,374
亲爱的，能让我们单独谈谈吗?
Darling, will you excuse us for a minute?

450
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:40,486
确定。
Sure.

451
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:50,704
坦率地说，这些电影的成功或失败对我们来说并不重要。
Quite frankly, the, uh, the success or failure of these films is of little importance to us.

452
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:54,791
我们在抓更大的鱼。
We're after bigger fish.

453
00:38:56,877 --> 00:39:02,049
在曾经的苏联集团中有超过3亿人。
There are over 300 million people in what was once the Soviet bloc.

454
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,552
渴望娱乐的人。
People who are starved of entertainment.

455
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:10,098
在自家后院拍摄的电影，主角是他们自己的人。
Movies shot in their own backyard, starring their own people.

456
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:15,062
我指的是建造大型工作室、连锁电影院，甚至是主题公园。
I'm talking about building major studios, cineplex chains, even theme parks.

457
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:20,901
我所谈论的交易将使欧洲迪斯尼显得微不足道。
The deal I am talking about will make euro Disney seem penny ante.

458
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,571
这是个很棒的故事。俄罗斯的好莱坞。
Well, this is a great story. A Russian Hollywood.

459
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,324
那我们什么时候公开?
And when do we go on record?

460
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:32,204
两周,上衣。
Two weeks, tops.

461
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,622
但对于你,
But for you,

462
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,876
比世界其他地方早24小时。
24 hours before the rest of the world.

463
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,796
《新闻日报》独有。
Exclusive to newsday.

464
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,507
作为回报吗?
And in return?

465
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:47,344
推迟你已经开始的那部分。
Postpone the piece you've already started.

466
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:53,767
现在，它是什么?这是一个,嗯…这是一个关于小制片厂和他们两部不成功的电影的故事。
Right now, what is it? It's a, uh... It's a story about a small-time studio and their two unsuccessful movies.

467
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,061
谁在乎呢?
Who cares?

468
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,397
你说呢?
What do you say?

469
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:04,403
如果是独家新闻，那就成交吧。
Well, if it's a newsday exclusive, I guess you got a deal.

470
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,366
克莱尔，你带查尔顿女士去片场吧。
Claire, why don't you take Ms. Charleton down to the set.

471
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,411
你可以看到这个行业迷人的一面。
You can see the glamorous side of the business.

472
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,288
我会和你联系的。
I'll be in touch.

473
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:29,845
你是好的。
You are good.

474
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:35,851
我们可以把一个普通的男人或女人变成猿猴或小丑。
Where we can transform an ordinary man or woman into an ape or a clown.

475
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:46,320
好了,那么。现在，在我们进入下一个传送门之前，我有责任警告你们发现有几只危险的丛林生物正在逃跑，
All righty, then. Now, before we enter this next portal, it is my duty to warn you that several dangerous jungle creatures have been sighted on the loose,

476
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:49,197
所以，请始终待在车厢内。
so, please keep inside the tram at all times.

477
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,783
我不想再失去任何人了。
I don't want to lose anyone, again.

478
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:56,371
-爸爸，你带大刀了吗?-没想到我在这用得到
- Dad, do you have your big knife? - Oh, didn't think I'd need it here.

479
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,666
我可能带了小刀。你要它做什么?
I might have my pocket knife. What do you need it for?

480
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,835
我是说，以防丛林动物袭击。
I mean, in case the jungle animals attack.

481
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,420
哦……我想我们会没事的。
Oh... I think we'll be all right.

482
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,883
好了，小心，伙计们，这是一条巨大的致命蟒蛇!
Okay, look out, folks, it's a giant deadly anaconda!

483
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:22,939
-太棒了，伙计。-抱歉，反射动作。
- Well, that's awesome, dude. - Sorry, reflex action.

484
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,108
好吧。酷。
Okay. Cool.

485
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:26,693
我们走吧。
Let's get outta here.

486
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:30,947
喂!。
G'day.

487
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:35,577
-爸，那是男人的把戏吗?-你说对了，伙计。
- Was that more man stuff, dad? - You got that right, mate.

488
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:45,462
-嘿，你们两个。玩得开心吗?-是啊，很酷。
- Hey, you two. Did you have fun? - Yeah, it was cool.

489
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,006
是的。你的面试怎么样?
Yeah. So how'd your interview go?

490
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,427
令人毛骨悚然。
Creepy.

491
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,890
你有没有过这样的经历:当你和别人交谈时，你觉得他们所说的一切都是谎言?
Did you ever talk to someone and think everything they're saying is a lie?

492
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:58,934
是的。金块。
Yeah. Nugget.

493
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:05,434
金块是无害的。这家伙……你知道你该怎么做吗?
Well, nugget's harmless. This guy... You know what you should do?

494
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,829
你的报纸跟警察有关系，对吧?
Your paper's got police connections, right?

495
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,821
你让警察调查他的背景。
You get the cops to do a background check on him.

496
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,365
纽约警局的人就是这么做的。
That's the way they do it on NYPD blue.

497
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,617
嗯。
Hmm.

498
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:19,579
看来麦奇不是唯一一个整天看电视的人。
Well, I see Mikey's not the only one glued to the TV all day long.

499
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:23,875
是啊，但我们只看，呃，教育节目。伴侣?
Oh, yeah, but we only watch, uh, educational programs. Right, mate?

500
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,377
是的。像摔跤。
Yeah. Like wrestling.

501
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,047
“你能闻到石头在煮什么吗?”
"Can you smell what the rock is cooking?"

502
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,638
-他今天表现好吗?-哦，是的，他很好。
- Well, did he behave today? - Oh, yeah, he was good as gold.

503
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,433
我没跟你说话。我在和米奇说话。
I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Mikey.

504
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,562
不要再看电视了。你明天就要上学了。
And no more TV. You start school tomorrow.

505
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:09,129
喂!。米克敦提。
G'day. Mick dundee.

506
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:13,091
来接我的脚踝咬人犬。这是他第一天上班。
Here to pick up my ankle biter. It's his first day.

507
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:15,802
啊。巴里·卡茨。他是几年级的?
Ah. Barry katz. What, uh, grade's he in?

508
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,346
——呃,第四。-跟我儿子一样
- Uh, fourth. - Oh, same as my boy.

509
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,433
-我儿子在三垒。埃里克·贝瑞。——嗨,埃里克。
- My boy's in the third. Eric Berry. - Hi, Eric.

510
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,161
你看起来像个户外爱好者，米克。
Well, you look like an outdoorsman, Mick.

511
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:25,185
你觉得这个生存营的主意怎么样?
What do you think of this whole survival camp idea?

512
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:26,480
它是什么?
What is it?

513
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,082
学校打算今年夏天举办。
Well, the school's puttin' it on this summer.

514
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,786
教孩子们如何在树林里生存。
Teach the kids how to survive in the woods.

515
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:33,236
钓鱼,篝火。爸爸是受欢迎的。
Fishing, making campfires. Dads are welcome.

516
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,322
——哦。-我觉得这是个好主意。
- Oh. - I think it's a great idea.

517
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:38,036
让他们有机会接触大自然。
Gives them a chance to get in touch with nature.

518
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,452
-我要带小加里一起去。-哦，很好。
- I'm gonna take young Gary along. - Oh, good for you.

519
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:43,384
在丛林里待上几周，你和你儿子，你们都会喜欢的。
Couple of weeks in the bush, you and your boy, you'll both love it.

520
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,824
你带你儿子去过你去过的内陆吗?
You ever take your boy into the outback where you were?

521
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:47,959
下吗?
Down under?

522
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,129
所有的时间。
All the time.

523
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,007
就在上个月，我带他去了灌木丛。
Just last month, I took him into the bush.

524
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,135
教他如何用棍子打死野猪。
Taught him how to kill a wild boar with a stick.

525
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,180
杀死一个野猪吗?但他才九岁?
Kill a boar? But he's, like, nine years old?

526
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,935
你知道俗话怎么说吗?迟到总比不到好，是吧?
Yeah, well, you know what they say? Better late than never, eh?

527
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:09,272
再见，伙计们。
See you later, fellas.

528
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:17,781
嗨,爸爸。马西斯小姐想和你谈谈。我在那儿等你。
Hey, dad. Miss Mathis wants to talk to you. I'll meet you over there.

529
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,492
多萝西·马西斯，查尔顿先生。
Dorothy Mathis, Mr. Charleton.

530
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,494
哦，你好。事实上，我是米克·邓迪。
Oh, how do you do? Actually, it's Mick dundee.

531
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,997
-但我是米奇的爸爸。-哦，邓迪先生正确的。
- But I'm Mikey's dad. - Oh, Mr. Dundee. Right.

532
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:30,669
首先，麦奇是个可爱的男孩。明亮,友好。
Well, first off, Mikey is a lovely boy. Bright, friendly.

533
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:35,048
只是有个小问题，我们在这里经常遇到的问题。
Um, there's just one small problem, one we run into all the time here.

534
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,425
我们称之为“好莱坞综合症”。
We call it the "Hollywood syndrome."

535
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:43,181
就像父亲在电影中扮演警察一样，孩子们常常认为他就是警察。
Like when a dad plays a policeman in a movie, the children often believe he's actually a policeman.

536
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,308
对了，这里有很多演员的孩子。
Oh, right, you've got a lot of actors' kids here.

537
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,365
好吧，我又不是做电影的。
Yeah, well, I'm not in the movie business.

538
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:49,980
我是旅游业的。不那么迷人。
I'm in the, uh, tourism business. Not so glamorous.

539
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,273
完全正确。
Exactly.

540
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:55,235
这就是为什么你儿子试图让它听起来比实际情况更丰富多彩。
Which is why your son tries to make it sound a bit more colorful than it really is.

541
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,613
看起来无害，但小谎言是可以长出来的。
Now, it seems harmless, but little fibs can grow.

542
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:01,575
他说了些什么?
What's he been sayin'?

543
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:08,248
恐怕他告诉所有人你是猎人，你猎杀鳄鱼。
I'm afraid he told everyone you're a hunter, and you hunt and kill crocodiles.

544
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,042
哦。他比那更清楚。
Oh. He knows better than that.

545
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:15,130
鳄鱼是保护。我不杀他们，我活捉他们。
Crocodiles are protected. I don't kill 'em. I catch 'em alive.

546
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,801
哦?嗯,是的。当然可以。
Oh? Well, yes. Of course.

547
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,263
我会跟他说的。不会再有谎言了。
I'll talk to him. There'll be no more fibs.

548
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,806
很高兴见到你，多萝西。
Really nice to meet you, Dorothy.

549
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:31,438
看起来像个猎人。
Looks like a hunter.

550
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,569
漂亮的屁股。
Nice butt.

551
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:43,408
爸爸，你能告诉老师叫我邓迪，而不是查尔斯顿吗?
Dad, will you tell the teachers to call me dundee, not charleton?

552
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:49,414
哦,当然。我们只需要用你母亲的名字帮你登记入学，因为在这里那是你的合法名字。
Oh, sure. We just had to enroll you at school under your mother's name 'cause that's your legal name over here.

553
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,126
是因为你不想和妈妈结婚吗?
Is that 'cause you won't marry mum?

554
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,253
哦，不，我们结婚了……有几分。
Oh, no, we're married... sorta.

555
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,355
我们只是还没完成法律部分。
We just haven't done the legal bit yet.

556
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:01,174
当你告诉学校的孩子们你爸爸是个鳄鱼猎人时他们怎么说?
So what'd the kids at school say when you told them your dad was a crocodile hunter?

557
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,429
他们说"他在比弗利山庄做什么"
They said, "well, what's he doing in Beverly Hills?"

558
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:06,932
聪明的孩子。
Smart kids.

559
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:17,108
嘿，爸爸，那个男人在做什么?
Hey, dad, what's that man doing?

560
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,279
我不知道。我们去问问他吧。
I don't know. Let's go and ask him.

561
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:29,204
对不起,先生。你在干什么?
Excuse me, mister. What are you doing?

562
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:31,581
我在冥想，年轻人。
Well, I'm meditating, young man.

563
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,333
冥想是什么?
What's meditating?

564
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:40,757
冥想是我头脑中一个特别的地方，在那里没有干扰，我能获得强大的力量。
Meditating is a special place I go in my mind where there's no distraction, and I receive a great source of power.

565
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,469
酷。你能告诉我们怎么做吗?
Cool. Can you show us how, please?

566
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,263
确定。来吧，fonnard，请坐。
Sure. Come fonnard and have a seat.

567
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:52,560
-我叫麦奇。什么是你的吗?——嗨,米奇。我是迈克。
- My name's Mikey. What's yours? - Hi, Mikey. I'm Mike.

568
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,106
噢,嗨,迈克。我是米奇，米奇的爸爸。
Oh, hi, Mike. I'm Mick, Mikey's dad.

569
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,024
米奇,米克,迈克。
Mikey, Mick, Mike.

570
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:00,485
-你在开玩笑吧?——没有。
- You gotta be kidding me, right? - No.

571
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:11,663
好吧,好吧。像佛陀一样握住你的腿，抓住你的脚踝，这样会让你感觉不舒服，然后，嗯，我们要放松……闭上眼睛，放松。
Okay, okay. Hold your legs like in a Buddha position, grab your ankles to save yourself some discomfort, and, um, we're gonna take it easy... Close your eyes, relax.

572
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:14,582
吸入的积极性。
Inhale the positivity.

573
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:16,960
呼气的消极。
Exhale the negativity.

574
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:22,382
吸入积极的东西，呼出消极的东西。
Inhale the positivity, exhale the negativity.

575
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,804
睁开你的眼睛。醒来。放松。
Open your eyes. Wake up. Relax.

576
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:31,725
-你感觉如何?——非常强大。
- How do you feel? - Very powerful.

577
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,478
就是这样，爸爸。权力。一切都取决于权力。
And that's the ticket, daddy-o. Power. It's all in the power.

578
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:40,025
麦奇，你能快点吗。我要和迈克说几句话。
Mikey, would you just hurry up ahead. I need to talk to Mike for a minute.

579
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,234
——好的。——在私人。
- Okay. - In private.

580
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,529
——谢谢,迈克。-不客气，麦奇。
- Thanks, Mike. - You're welcome, Mikey.

581
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,281
——再见。-保重，伙计。
- See ya. - Take care, buddy.

582
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,243
迈克，帮我个忙。
Now, Mike, I need a favor.

583
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,787
米克，每个人都需要我帮忙。
You know, Mick, everybody needs a favor from me.

584
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,992
我需要你帮我起来。我的膝盖卡住了。
Well, I need you to help me up. My knees have locked.

585
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,293
这是我的错。没问题，伙计。
That's my bad right there. You got it, buddy.

586
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,338
-我不想让我的孩子看到。哦!-给你。
- I didn't want my kid to see. Oh! - There you go.

587
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:05,300
谢谢你！
Thank you.

588
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:10,889
爸爸，你看到麦克的肌肉有多大了吗?他们是巨大的。
Hey, dad, did you see the size of Mike's muscles? They were huge.

589
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:15,226
是的。你看，永远不要以貌取人。
Yeah. Now you see, you should never judge a book by its cover.

590
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:22,275
那个迈克，身材高大，体格健壮，但我一眼就看出他是个温和的人。
That Mike, big man, built like a brick dunny, but I could tell straightaway he was a gentle man.

591
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,239
他连一只苍蝇都不会伤害。我只是认识一些人。这是一个礼物。
He wouldn't hurt a fly. I just know people. It's a gift.

592
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:33,095
好吧，我需要你们把这里翻个底朝天。
All right, ineed you guys to tear this place apart.

593
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,247
啊，是保龄球。纯的海洛因。
Ah, it's the bowlin' ball. Pure heroin.

594
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,960
-我知道就在这里。-看看保龄球。
- I know it's here somewhere. - Check out the bowling ball.

595
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:45,632
-这个保龄球怎么样?-我就知道。
- Hey, how about this bowling ball? - There, I knew it.

596
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:02,023
——嘿,苏!——嗯?
- Hey, sue! - Hmm?

597
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:05,527
你在干什么，亲爱的?
What are you doin', love?

598
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,321
试着像记者一样思考。
Trying to think like a journalist again.

599
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:10,406
我以前做得很好。
I used to be pretty good at it.

600
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:19,833
不是说有人会把苏·查尔顿和普利策奖放在一起，但是…我只是难住了。
Not that anyone was gonna put sue charleton and pulitzer prize in the same sentence, but, ah... I'm just stumped.

601
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,168
是那个电影制片厂的事吗?
Is it that, uh, film studio thing?

602
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:27,799
我相信这是精心设计的幌子。但是什么?
I'm sure it's an elaborate front for something. But what?

603
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:29,843
他们smugglin”。
They're smugglin'.

604
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,930
-毒品或枪支。-你是怎么想到的?
- Drugs or guns. - How do you arrive at that?

605
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,431
一直都是这样。
That's what it always is.

606
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:39,310
他们走私到美国的最赚钱的东西就是毒品。
The big money thing they smuggle into america are drugs.

607
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,729
还有最重要的东西，枪。
And the big thing going out, guns.

608
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:50,113
这种对重大犯罪活动的洞察又是从何而来的呢?
And where did this insight into major criminal activities come from?

609
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:52,907
哦,从电视。我学东西很快。
Oh, from TV. I'm a quick learner.

610
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:56,661
我可能看起来像刚从萝卜车上摔下来，但我没摔到头。
Hey, I may look like I just fell off the turnip truck, but I didn't land on my head.

611
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,916
你知道你需要什么吗?你需要一个痣。
You know what you need? You need a mole.

612
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:06,588
-摩尔?——我。我会在录音棚找份工作。
- A mole? - Me. I'll get a job at the studio.

613
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:13,219
米克，我知道你有事要做，但是…我在电影派对上联系了很多人。
Oh, Mick, I know you need something to do, but... I made a lot of contacts at that movie party.

614
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,024
我打赌他们中的一个会帮我在那里找到工作。
I bet one of them would get me a job there.

615
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:18,659
那麦奇呢?明早谁送他去学校?
Well, what about Mikey? Who's gonna take him to school in the morning?

616
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,977
我去给他找个保姆。我会找一个好的。
I'll get him one of those nannies. I'll get a good one.

617
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,605
别担心。交给我吧。这是很重要的。
Don't worry. Leave it to me. This is important.

618
00:50:24,856 --> 00:50:28,484
有时候我觉得小麦奇觉得我是个乡巴佬。
See, sometimes I think young Mikey thinks I'm a bit of a hillbilly.

619
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:30,653
事实上，我是。
Well, I am, actually.

620
00:50:32,322 --> 00:50:36,233
我只是想让他知道乡巴佬并不意味着你就傻。
I just wanna show him that being a hillbilly doesn't necessarily mean you're dumb.

621
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:43,416
于是，我们的第一组人沿着街道漫步，后面跟着三个商人，步伐更加轻快。
So our first group, stroll up the street, followed by our three businessmen at a more brisk pace.

622
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,668
然后是两个建筑工人。
And then our two construction workers.

623
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:50,548
——迭戈冈萨雷斯。——是的,米克。米克·史密斯。
- Diego Gonzales. - Yeah, Mick. Mick Smith.

624
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,008
很高兴认识你，米克。
Nice to meet you, Mick.

625
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:56,554
现在我们在柏林，所以请像德国人一样走路!
Now, we're in Berlin, so please walk like Germans!

626
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,015
德国人怎么走路?
How do Germans walk?

627
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:02,310
我不知道。一只脚接着一只脚?
I don't know. One foot after the other?

628
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,394
好吧。
Okay.

629
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:07,148
所以，这是一次排练!背景!
So, this is a rehearsal! Background only!

630
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:10,109
,行动!
And, action!

631
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,451
你到底在干什么?
What the hell are you doing?

632
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:20,668
我只是想让我的孩子在照片里看到我。
I just wanted my kid to see me in the picture.

633
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:26,376
好吧，如果你在拍照的时候盯着相机看，他们就会把你从照片里去掉。——哦。
Yeah, well, if you start looking at the camera during the take, - they'll take you out of the picture. - Oh.

634
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:30,129
-你是新来的吧?-是的，第一个角色。有些紧张。
- You're new, aren't you? - Yeah, first role. Bit nervous.

635
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,175
减少!请回到1 !
Cut! Back to one, please!

636
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:36,052
听着，放轻松。
Well, look, just relax.

637
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,553
-看着我，好吗?-是的。
- Watch me, okay? - Yeah.

638
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:41,766
别管相机了。我们是两个要去酒吧的工作人员。
Forget about the camera. We're two working stiffs on our way to a bar.

639
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:44,519
-假装这是现实生活?-是的。
- Oh, just pretend it's real life? - Yeah.

640
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:54,612
好了，各位，这次我们是来真的，记住……请注意!
Okay, now, people, we will be doing it for real this time, and remember... Attention, please!

641
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,615
——安静,大家好!——安静!
- Quiet, everyone! - Quiet!

642
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,742
——图片!——图片!
- Picture's up! - Picture's up!

643
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,327
滚!
Roll!

644
00:52:01,411 --> 00:52:03,204
——声音的速度。——标记。
- Sound speed. - Marker.

645
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:08,293
——设置。-背景动作。
- Set. - And, background action.

646
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:11,921
和行动。
And action.

647
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:16,843
阻止那个人!
Stop that man!

648
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,599
——切!减少!-你没事吧?
- Cut! Cut! - Man, are you okay?

649
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:26,269
到底发生了什么?
What the hell happened?

650
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:33,985
是我的错。我只看见他跑…事情是这样的他…他试图在他跌倒时抓住他。
It was my fault. I just saw him runnin' and... Uh, what happened is that he... He tried to catch him as he fell.

651
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,654
我们都看见他绊倒了。他重重地倒下了。
We both saw him trip. He went down hard.

652
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,364
你确定你没事吗?
Are you sure you're okay?

653
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:43,703
-谢谢你的努力，伙计。-好的，我们再来一次。
- Thanks for trying, buddy. - Okay, we'll go again.

654
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:48,458
请回到1 !越快越好!我们快没光了!
Back to one, please! Fast as you can! We're losing the light!

655
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,169
谢谢你帮我掩饰。
Hey, thanks for covering up for me.

656
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:55,715
我没办法，你知道吗?反射。有点像橄榄球闪回。
I couldn't help it, you know? Reflex. Sort of like a football flashback.

657
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,427
橄榄球，我的天，那可不是合法的拦截。
Football, my ass. That wasn't exactly a legal tackle.

658
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:02,430
哦，它在家里。这叫销子和衣架。
Oh, it is at home. It's called a dowel and coat hanger.

659
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:05,433
不管怎样，我欠你个人情。
Anyway, I owe you one.

660
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:08,269
不，不，没关系。我必须把你留在这里。
No, no, it's okay. I had to keep you here.

661
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:11,522
你是有趣的。我想看看你要怎么做才能搞砸下一次拍摄。
You're fun. I want to see what you're gonna do to screw up the next take.

662
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,441
好吧。
Okay.

663
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,048
哦，怎么了，迈克尔?
Oh, uh, what's the problem, Michael?

664
00:53:37,465 --> 00:53:41,719
小姐，美国人喜欢老鼠吗，还是它们只是害虫?
Miss, do people like rats in america, or are they just pests?

665
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:43,721
为什么这么问?
Why do you ask?

666
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:47,141
因为书架上有只大老鼠。
'Cause there's a big rat in the bookshelves.

667
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:07,787
恶心!
Gross!

668
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:15,086
——是……它死了吗?-不，小姐，我只是把它打晕了。
- Is... is it dead? - No, miss. I only stunned it.

669
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:18,214
我爸爸说"除非你想吃，否则不要杀任何东西"
My dad says, "never kill anything unless you're gonna eat it."

670
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,383
哟!
Ew!

671
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,927
我想我们还是把它放在外面吧。
I think we'll just put it outside, please.

672
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,518
他是我最好的朋友，知道吗?
He's my best friend, you know?

673
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:36,315
你看，在这里生存的关键是你的脸要离镜头远点。
You see, the key to survival here is you gotta keep your face away from the camera.

674
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:38,526
这样他们就能一次又一次地利用你。
That way they can use you again and again.

675
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:40,945
每一场黑帮戏我都演过。
You know, I've been in every mob scene.

676
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,906
-你是专业的。-好了，各位!安定下来!
- You're a pro. - All right, everyone! Settle down!

677
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,700
——解决!——再试一次。
- Settling! - Try again.

678
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:49,287
和背景行动!
And background action!

679
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:51,789
行动。
Action.

680
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:56,461
看这个!看这个!琪琪，给我拿杯喝的。
Watch this! Watch this! Kiki, get me a drink.

681
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,093
——切!-被砍了!
- Cut! - That's a cut!

682
00:55:04,177 --> 00:55:05,636
这不是工作。
This isn't working.

683
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:07,930
猴子有什么问题?
What's the problem with the monkey?

684
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:11,934
对不起。她之前还好好的。来这里,琪琪。到这里来。
Sorry. She was fine earlier. Come here, kiki. Come here.

685
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,144
到这里来。
Come here.

686
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:17,064
我不明白你的意思。她从不这样做。
I don't understand. She never does this.

687
00:55:17,607 --> 00:55:19,025
来这里,琪琪!
Come here, kiki!

688
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:23,779
她只是有点紧张。你想让她怎么做?
She's just a bit nervous. What do you want her to do?

689
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,992
-你和动物一起工作过吗?-是的。有点。
- You ever work with animals? - Yeah. Kinda.

690
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:31,829
她应该走到桌子前给演员拿杯苏打水。
She's supposed to go to the table and take a soda to the actor.

691
00:55:39,128 --> 00:55:41,506
-节食还是有规律?——不管。饮食。
- Diet or regular? - Whatever. Diet.

692
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:48,179
-要来一杯吗?-她还没学会。
- Want a glass? - She hasn't learned that.

693
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:52,391
我们要迟到了。
We're running late here.

694
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,812
我们能再试一次吗?如果不成功，我们就放弃。
Can we try one more time? If this doesn't work, we'll drop it.

695
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:01,275
好，回到第一题。各位，这是真的。
Okay, back to one. This is the real thing, everybody.

696
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:02,652
集中注意力。
Concentrating.

697
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:05,905
- - - - - -滚!——图片!
- Roll! - Picture's up!

698
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,073
速度。标记。
Speed. Marker.

699
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:13,079
-背景动作!——行动!
- And background action! - Action!

700
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,958
看这个。看这个!琪琪，给我拿杯喝的。
Watch this. Watch this! Kiki, get me a drink.

701
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:22,755
让它成为减肥食品。
Make it a diet one.

702
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:27,468
还有一个杯子!谢谢你，我的朋友。
And a glass too! Thank you, mein iiebchen.

703
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:30,429
减少!印刷!检查门口。
Cut! Print! Check the gate.

704
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:32,515
哇!
Whoo!

705
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:36,644
他的书。
Book him.

706
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:41,941
听着，我有个问题。
Look, uh, I got a problem.

707
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:45,987
我所有的动物都在丛林拍摄，我不能总是和黑猩猩来回走动。
All of my animals are on the jungle set, and I can't keep coming back and forth with the chimp.

708
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:49,132
所以如果你能代替我，我会给你双倍的报酬。
So if you'll fill in for me, I'll double what you're getting paid.

709
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,533
我还会在照片上吗?
Will I still be on this picture?

710
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,744
每一天。琪琪是个超水平选手。
Every day. Kiki's an above-the-title player.

711
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:56,414
成交。
You got a deal.

712
00:56:57,582 --> 00:56:59,017
我是新来的训猴师。
You're looking at the new monkey wrangler.

713
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:02,670
-嘿，谢谢你的帮助，迭戈。,老兄,米克!
- Hey, thanks for you help, Diego. - Dude, Mick!

714
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:06,424
这对你的事业有积极的影响。
Hey, hey, this is a positive career move.

715
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:07,925
——你认为呢?——是的!
- You reckon? - Yeah!

716
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,469
我告诉你，你会大有作为的。
I'm telling you, you're gonna go far.

717
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,556
啊!现在别那么陌生了。
Ah! Don't be a stranger now.

718
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:18,686
真是个好人。
Hell of a nice guy.

719
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:25,818
不会演戏，但他可能会拍出自己的电视情景喜剧。
Can't act for shit, but he'll probably wind up with his own TV sitcom.

720
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,322
米奇!
Mikey!

721
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:31,657
等一下，亲爱的。
Waitjust a minute, dear.

722
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,120
-再见，迈克。——再见,米奇。
- See ya, Mike. - Bye, Mikey.

723
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,956
我猜你父亲又来接你了。
I suppose your father's picking you up again.

724
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:41,334
不，他这周在上班。
Nah, he's at work this week.

725
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:45,004
哦,游手好闲的人。那你怎么回家?
Oh, bummer. Well, how are you getting home then?

726
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:47,089
我和其他孩子一样有个保姆。
I've got a nanny like all the other kids.

727
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:49,258
哦!哪一个是你的?
Oh! Which one's yours?

728
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,260
在那里。最大的一个。
Over there. The big one.

729
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,389
你的保姆吗?
Your nanny?

730
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:58,184
他其实是老家的小杰叔叔。
Well, he's really uncle Jacko from back home.

731
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:01,896
-杰克叔叔结婚了吗?-没有，但他在找。
- And is uncle Jacko married? - Uh, no, but he's looking.

732
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,274
嗨。多萝西马西斯。我是米奇的老师。
Hi. Dorothy Mathis. I'm Mikey's teacher.

733
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,735
喂!,多萝西。叫我“怪人杰克”。
G'day, Dorothy. Call me Jacko.

734
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:14,158
血腥的。
Bloody marvelous.

735
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,912
洛杉矶,是吗?
Los Angeles, eh?

736
00:58:19,789 --> 00:58:20,831
有趣的名字。
Funny name.

737
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,084
洛杉矶。
Los Angeles.

738
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,754
是啊，意思是"迷失的天使"
Yeah, it means, uh, "lost angels."

739
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:31,050
这是意大利人。啊，在这里。
It's Italian. Ah, there it is.

740
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,886
我跟苏说要带你去一个特别的地方吃晚餐。
I told sue I'd take you somewhere really special for dinner.

741
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,821
你会喜欢这个地方的。相信我。
You're gonna love this place. Trust me.

742
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:48,651
现在，从菜单上选出你想要的，然后对着那个盒子大声喊出来。
Now, pick out what you want off the menu here, and you yell it out into that box.

743
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:53,344
两分钟后，你连车都没下就吃完了。
Two minutes later, you're scarfing it down without even getting out of the car.

744
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:59,161
当然我们在城里也有汽车影院，但这是一切开始的地方。
Of course we have these drive-ins back home in the cities, but this is where it all started.

745
00:58:59,912 --> 00:59:03,791
这样你就能像猪一样大吃特吃，没人能看见你。
So you can eat like a pig and no one can see you.

746
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:07,336
这些美国佬真聪明，是吧?
Clever buggers, these yanks, eh?

747
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,882
这就是为什么la。它以精致的菜肴闻名于世。
Well, this is why la. Is famous all around the world for its fine cuisine.

748
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,444
-欢迎光临温蒂餐厅。-您要点菜吗?
- Welcome to Wendy's. - Can I take your order, please?

749
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,304
让我来处理。晚上好,温迪。
Let me handle this. Good evening, Wendy.

750
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:22,059
今晚我们四个人在车里吃饭。
There will be four of us dining in the car this evening.

751
00:59:23,686 --> 00:59:28,649
我们需要四个三份汉堡加芝士和四份大薯条。
So we're gonna need four triple burgers with cheese and four biggie fries.

752
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,444
这就是经典的奶酪三份套餐。
So that's four classic triples with cheese.

753
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:33,004
-等一下-四份大薯条?
- Uh, wait a minute. - And four biggie fries?

754
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:36,323
斯坦和哈利来了。
Uh, here comes Stan and Harry.

755
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:47,126
他们今晚也会和我们一起吃饭，所以我们需要六个三份汉堡加奶酪和六份大薯条。
Uh, they'll also be dining with us tonight, so we need six triple burgers with cheese and six biggie fries.

756
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:51,797
好吧。六份经典三份加奶酪和六份大薯条?
Okay. Six classic triples with cheese and six biggie fries?

757
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,511
-你知道我真正想做什么吗?——那是什么?
- You know what I'd really like to do? - What's that?

758
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,182
直接上到摩天大楼的屋顶上。
Go right up on the roof on one of those skyscrapers.

759
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:04,185
这很简单。找一个空着的。
That's easy. Just find one that's open.

760
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:17,281
——哎哟!-这比艾尔斯岩高。
- Strewth! - This is higher than ayers rock.

761
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:23,662
是的。当然，纽约的建筑要高得多。
Yeah. Of course, the buildings in New York are a lot higher.

762
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:25,414
我当时在场，你知道的。
I was there, you know.

763
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,666
老纽约。
Old New York.

764
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:31,504
或者我们称之为“大苹果”。
Or as we call it, the "big apple."

765
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:35,132
大苹果吗?你为什么这么叫它?
Big apple? Why do you call it that?

766
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:42,932
因为它真的很大，而且…是啊，但那些建筑都没有这里危险。
Well, because it's really big and, uh... Yeah, but none of those buildings are as dangerous as this.

767
01:00:46,018 --> 01:00:47,019
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

768
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,230
嗯，纽约没有地震。
Well, they don't have earthquakes in New York.

769
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,273
他们一直都有，对吧?
They have 'em here all the time, right?

770
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:53,442
是的。
Yeah.

771
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:56,320
我们现在就可以有一个。
We could have one right now.

772
01:00:57,905 --> 01:00:58,906
上帝!
God!

773
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,377
你觉得这会对这栋楼造成什么影响?
What do you reckon it'd do to this building?

774
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:05,663
如果她开始发抖，我也不想待在这里，对吧?
Hey, I wouldn't wanna be up here if she started shakin', eh?

775
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:12,086
-我看够了。你做了什么?-哦,是的。没必要再逗留了。
- I've seen enough. You done? - Oh, yeah. No point in hangin' round.

776
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:18,926
地震,是吗?
Earthquakes, eh?

777
01:01:19,844 --> 01:01:20,886
不用担心。
No worries.

778
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:42,074
伙计，爬了1286级楼梯，我得喝一杯。
Oh, mate, I need a drink after all those 1,286 stairs.

779
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:43,993
不用担心,伴侣。
No worries, mate.

780
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:05,890
没有工作。
Didn't work.

781
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:07,975
你得等等。
Well, you gotta wait.

782
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:12,104
有几百辆车经过，只有我们两个想过马路。
There's hundreds of cars going through and just us two trying to cross.

783
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:17,484
是吗?现在我们有20个人了?
Yeah? Now there's 20 of us, eh?

784
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:19,320
是的，但你不能这么做。这是非法的。
Yeah, but you can't do that. It's illegal.

785
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:22,031
我没看到警察。
Well, I don't see any cops.

786
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:25,367
是啊，但所有路口都有摄像头，看到了吗?
Yeah, but they have cameras at all these intersections, see?

787
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:29,079
如果你做错了什么，他们会拍下你的照片，然后给你罚款。
And if you do anything wrong, they take your picture and then send you a fine.

788
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:36,754
是啊，但我脖子上又没挂车牌，他们怎么可能知道我是谁?
Yeah, but I ain't wearing a number plate around my neck, so how the hell are they gonna know who I am, huh?

789
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:43,719
你到这里的时候，你给他们看了你的护照，对吧?
Well, uh, when you landed here, you showed 'em your passport, right?

790
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,930
-是的。-里面有你的照片，笨蛋。
- Yeah. - Got your picture in it, dopey.

791
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:48,349
哦,是的,是的。
Oh, yeah, right.

792
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,602
我想知道他们要罚你多少钱。
I wonder how much they fine you.

793
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,349
这完全取决于你按了多少次按钮。
It all depends on how many times you push the button.

794
01:02:57,942 --> 01:03:02,363
-这看起来像我们。——哦,太棒了。德州酒吧。我们在。
- This looks like us. - Oh, great. Texas bar. We're in.

795
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,478
这可能会很有趣。
Now this could be a bit of fun.

796
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,242
这些美国牛仔喜欢在酒吧打架。
These American cowboys love a good barroom brawl.

797
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,245
你好,男孩。一步。
Howdy, boys. Step on in.

798
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:11,580
你好,女士。
Howdy, ma'am.

799
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,460
——女士。——你好,牛仔。
- Ma'am. - Howdy, cowboys.

800
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:26,345
天在下雨，哈利路亚石，该死的乌鸦!
It's raining men, hallelujah stone the bloody crows!

801
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,307
那一定是那种女式酒吧。
That must've been one of those poofter bars.

802
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:31,475
是的。
Yup.

803
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:34,770
我觉得正确的说法应该是"同性恋"
Only I believe the correct term is "gay homosexual."

804
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:37,938
那边的人就是这么称呼他们的"脱衬衫者"的。
That's what they call their shirtlifters over here.

805
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:41,151
那里唯一的女人就是门口那个女牛仔。
The only woman there was the cowgirl at the door.

806
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,827
投降吧，混蛋，不然我就杀了你。
Give it up, punk, or I'll blow you away.

807
01:03:50,661 --> 01:03:52,371
嗯,稍等。我听不见你说什么。
Uh, hang on. I can't hear you.

808
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:58,002
这是更好的。我能帮你什么忙吗?
That's better. Now how can I help you?

809
01:03:58,168 --> 01:03:59,628
自以为是的牛仔,嗯?
Smart-ass cowboy, huh?

810
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,089
-把你的钱给我，伙计!-他们不是牛仔。
- Hand me over your money, man! - They ain't cowboys.

811
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:06,719
-他们是盛装打扮的傻瓜!-是啊，傻子也有钱。
- They're fools dressed up! - Yeah, fools got money, too.

812
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:08,679
投降吧，不然我打爆你的屁股!
Give it up, or I'll bust a cap in your ass!

813
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:10,055
给我，婊子!
Yeah, hand it over, bitch!

814
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:12,391
婊子?
Bitch?

815
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:17,438
孩子，你知道要多快才能抓到一条虎蛇吗?
Son, you have any idea how quick you have to be to catch a tiger snake?

816
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,861
我总是被打劫。我必须看起来很富有。
I'm always getting mugged. I must look rich.

817
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,197
这是一辆软顶车。屈服。
Hey, it's one of them soft-topped cars. Cave in.

818
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:37,332
这就是为什么他们叫la。“轮子上的城市”。
You know, this must be why they call la. The "city on wheels."

819
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,542
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

820
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,745
他们甚至不会下车来抢劫你。
Well, they don't even get out of their car to mug you.

821
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:46,050
——嘿!——噢!
- Hey! - Ow!

822
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:49,219
都是你的错，伙计!你不该叫他婊子!
It's all your fault, homes! You shouldn't have called him a bitch!

823
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:56,435
我们要报警吗?
Should we call the cops?

824
01:04:57,019 --> 01:05:00,522
没有意义。在这里，伙计，他们可能会起诉我们。
No point. Over here, mate, they'd probably end up suing us.

825
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:03,984
而且，这不是他们的错。
Besides, it's not their fault.

826
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,236
这是毒品。
It's the drugs.

827
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:10,074
我在杰拉尔多·里维拉身上都看到了。
I saw all about it on that Geraldo Rivera.

828
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,034
他熟悉街道。
He knows the streets.

829
01:05:13,035 --> 01:05:14,995
我们喝杯咖啡回家吧。
Let's just get a cup of coffee and go home.

830
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:17,790
哦。在这里不要急着点咖啡。
Ooh. Don't be too hasty ordering coffee around here.

831
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:20,918
你可能对他们的服务方式不太满意。
You might not be too happy with the way they serve 'em.

832
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,503
相信我。
Trust me.

833
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:30,302
就在这里，一条大鳄鱼差点把他的腿咬掉。
And this is where a big crocodile almost bit his leg right off.

834
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:36,975
——哇!- Neafl说实话，孩子们，它其实没那么大。
- Whoa! - Neafl well, to tell the truth, kids, it wasn't really that big.

835
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:41,271
不超过20英尺左右。
No more than 20 feet or so anyway.

836
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:42,856
哇!这是巨大的!
Whoa! That's huge!

837
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:55,369
是的,我知道。
Yes, I know.

838
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:59,081
他们就是不欣赏真正的艺人。我也会咬他的。
They just don't appreciate a real artiste. I'd have bit him too.

839
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:01,125
我觉得你很棒。
I thought you were fabulous.

840
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,207
我不管那个导演说了什么。他是个白痴。
I don't care what that director said. He's an idiot.

841
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:07,131
你真的很棒。
You were really good.

842
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,318
-你说黑咖啡加一颗糖，对吧?-哦,是的。
- You said black with one sugar, right? - Oh, yes.

843
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:15,031
——谢谢,伴侣。太好了。- - -…我给这位朋友准备了点小礼物。
- Thanks, mate. Excellent. - And... I got us a little treat for our friend here.

844
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,473
哦,太棒了。那正合我意。
Oh, great. That'll hit the spot.

845
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,726
黑咖啡加一块糖。
Black and one sugar.

846
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,063
她今天脾气有点坏。
She's a bit grumpy today.

847
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:25,541
她对拖车的大小不满意。
Not happy with the size of her trailer.

848
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:30,821
她想要一个像维吉尔那样大的，但我一直告诉她，维吉尔是一头狮子。你只是一只猴子。”
She wants a big one like Virgil, but I keep telling her, "Virgil's a lion. You're only a monkey."

849
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,826
对不起。“黑猩猩”。
Sorry. "Chimpanzee."

850
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,047
你有没有想过换一种媒介?
Say, have you thought about changing agents?

851
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:44,126
迭戈，你在和黑猩猩说话。他们不会说英语。
Diego, you're talking to a chimp. They don't speak English.

852
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:45,627
是啊，我第一任妻子也不知道。
Yeah, neither did my first wife.

853
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:50,174
保持移动,dravos。
Keep moving, dravos.

854
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:23,290
别傻了!注意这幅画!
Don't be stupid! Mind the painting!

855
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,737
先把它小心地靠在墙上。
Just lean it carefully against the wall for now.

856
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:38,680
小心!
Carefully!

857
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,190
喂!,菲尔。发生了什么,伙计?
G'day, Phil. What's happening, mate?

858
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:52,027
你好,米克。通常的连续性噩梦。
Hi, Mick. The usual continuity nightmare.

859
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:53,570
正确的。
Right.

860
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:55,530
那是什么意思?
What's that mean?

861
01:07:56,031 --> 01:08:01,745
这意味着我必须让这个场景看起来和在南斯拉夫的场景一模一样。
It means I have to make this set look exactly like it did on location in yugoslavia.

862
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:07,209
南斯拉夫。这些画都是从那里来的吗?
Yugoslavia. Is that where all these paintings come from?

863
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:10,921
是的。他们在那里做的。愚蠢的。
Yep. They had them done there. Dumb.

864
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:13,632
在这里会更便宜，更现实。
Would've been cheaper here and more realistic.

865
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:18,387
所以这些都没有价值。它们都是复制品。
Oh, so none of these are valuable. They're just all copies.

866
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,556
是啊，而且还挺可怜的。
Yep, and rather poor ones at that.

867
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:25,769
这些又大又俗气的镜框呢?在上帝的缘故。
And these huge, tacky frames? For god's sakes.

868
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:32,150
他们经常把布景和道具从一个国家运到另一个国家再运回来吗?
Do they usually cart the sets and the props from one country to another and back again?

869
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:36,613
也许是在一部高成本的国际电影《不可能3》中。
Maybe in a big-budget international movie Impossible III.

870
01:08:36,989 --> 01:08:39,469
但我没在片场看到汤姆·克鲁斯，你呢?
But I haven't seen Tom Cruise hanging around the set, have you?

871
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:44,037
汤姆·克鲁斯。他长什么样?
Tom Cruise. What's he look like?

872
01:08:45,414 --> 01:08:47,541
像汤姆·克鲁斯。
Like Tom Cruise.

873
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,504
天啊，米克，你是在山洞里出生的吗?
Jeez, Mick, were you born in a cave?

874
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:54,423
是啊!你怎么知道的?
Yeah! How did you know that?

875
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:56,842
不要紧。
Never mind.

876
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,179
吉姆，梵高夫妇走错路了。
Jim, the Van goghs are down at the wrong end.

877
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,328
看，他们从高更画开始，一个比一个高。
See, here they started with the gauguins, one above the other.

878
01:09:05,267 --> 01:09:07,894
让我们把它做好。我们今晚得把这里收拾干净。
Let's get this right. We gotta be done in here tonight.

879
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:09,479
他们明天要在这里拍摄。
They're shooting in here tomorrow.

880
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:28,206
你可以把海洛因掺入膏药里，做成任何你喜欢的形状。
You see, you can mix heroin into a plaster, make it any shape you like.

881
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:34,716
所以当我看到这家伙因为撞了那副烂画而发疯时，我就知道毒品藏在哪里了。
So when I see this guy go nuts just 'cause they bumped the lousy painting, that's where I knew where the drugs were hidden.

882
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:36,548
压在相框里的
Molded into the picture frames.

883
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:39,760
纯海洛因，我们叫它"海洛因"
Pure heroin, or as we call it, "smack."

884
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,638
天啊，米克，你的思维真像个侦探。
Jeez, Mick, you really do think like a detective.

885
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:46,892
是的，伙计，这对我来说很自然，你知道吗?
Yeah, mate, it comes sort of natural to me, you know?

886
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,394
——嘿,米克。——啊。
- Hey, Mick. - Ah.

887
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:51,646
是警察实验室打来的。
That was the police lab.

888
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:56,109
对不起。这些画框只是灰泥。没有药物。
Sorry. The frames are just plaster. There's no drugs.

889
01:09:56,777 --> 01:09:57,778
哦,他妈的。
Oh, bugger it.

890
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,365
我以为我破案了。
I was sure I cracked the case.

891
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,327
我不知道。也许他们没有走私任何东西。
I don't know. Maybe they're not smuggling anything.

892
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,375
哦,不。他们在偷偷摸摸地做些什么。
Oh, no. They're sneaking around with something.

893
01:10:07,496 --> 01:10:08,705
我只是还没找到。
I just haven't found it yet.

894
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:16,963
就像我在书上看到的，他曾经每天推着一辆装满牛粪的手推车穿过边境。
Like I read about this fella, he used to push a wheelbarrow full of cow dung across the border every day.

895
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:20,092
“给花园施肥，”他会说。持续了几个月。
"Manure for the garden," he'd say. Went on for months.

896
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:26,390
边防警卫知道他在走私东西，所以他们会阻止他，他们会把那些粪肥耙得精光。
And the border guards knew he was smuggling something, so they'd stop him and they'd rake through that manure with a fine-tooth comb.

897
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,557
什么都没找到。
Never found a thing.

898
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:33,438
事实证明他们是对的。他在走私什么东西，手推车。
Turned out they were right. He was smuggling something, wheelbarrows.

899
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:36,858
就在他们眼皮底下。
Right under their noses.

900
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:41,905
你看，它就在那里，只是我还没发现。我将。
See, it's there, and I'm just not seeing it, yet. And I will.

901
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:47,452
不。我认为他第一次是对的。这是毒品。
Nah. I reckon he was right the first time. It's drugs.

902
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:50,288
他们不会为了独轮车费那么大劲。
They wouldn't go to all that trouble for wheelbarrows.

903
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:05,429
——切!和打印。——切!
- Cut! And print. - Cut!

904
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:08,265
他投的时候我们就砍，所以很顺利。
We'll cut when he throws, so that went fine.

905
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:10,049
——好吧!-干得好，保罗。
- All right! - Well done, Paul.

906
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,437
听着，各位，我们现在不能烧了城堡。
Listen, everyone, we do not burn down the castle now.

907
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,022
明天要进行第二组射击。
That will be a second-unit shot tomorrow.

908
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,443
这意味着每个人都要提前回家，明天休息。
That means everyone goes home early and has tomorrow off.

909
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,113
——哇!好吧!-好的，周五见!
- Whoo! All right! - Okay, see you all Friday!

910
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,489
第一件事!
First thing!

911
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,089
你们最近才看到这些画。
And you've actually seen these paintings quite recently.

912
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:42,466
是的,今天。
Yeah, today.

913
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:45,927
那就简单多了。它们是假货。
Well, then than makes it easy. They're fakes.

914
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,971
你能从照片上看出来吗?
You can tell that from the photographs?

915
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:49,848
好吧,通常情况下,没有。
Well, normally, no.

916
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:56,646
但是，你看，这些伦勃朗的作品，还有这个，梵高的橄榄树，不幸的是已经不存在了。
But, you see, these rembrandts, and this, the olive field by Van gogh, unfortunately no longer exist.

917
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:06,781
在北约轰炸贝尔格莱德期间，塞尔维亚国家艺术博物馆受到直接打击，连同这些画作的原件一起被烧毁
During the bombing of Belgrade by NATO, the national art museum of Serbia took a direct hit, burned to the ground along with the originals of these paintings

918
01:12:06,865 --> 01:12:10,702
也可能是东欧最好的古代大师收藏。
and possibly the finest collection of old masters in Eastern Europe.

919
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:12,996
这是艺术界的悲剧。
It was a tragedy for the art world.

920
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:17,292
因此，这些一定是复制品，赝品。
Ergo, these must be copies, fakes.

921
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,299
贝尔格莱德，是在南斯拉夫吗?
That, um, Belgrade, is that in yugoslavia?

922
01:12:25,926 --> 01:12:26,927
是的。
Yeah.

923
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:30,103
因为这些画就是从那里来的。
'Cause that's where these paintings come from.

924
01:12:32,265 --> 01:12:36,811
如果不是意外爆炸而是有人先把画拿走了呢?
What if it wasn't an accidental bombing and someone removed the paintings first?

925
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:39,773
战争的战利品吗?
Spoils of war?

926
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:46,154
也许我该看看这些。你能带我去吗?
Maybe I should take a look at these. Could you take me to them?

927
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,615
这可能是不可能的。
That's probably impossible.

928
01:12:50,534 --> 01:12:56,915
但如果我能找到其中一个拿给你，而且它是真的，那就意味着其他的可能也是真的，对吧?
But if I could get one of them and bring it to you and it was real, that means the rest are probably real, right?

929
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,793
一找到就给我打电话。
You must call me the minute you find one.

930
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,229
-我要见他们。——不用担心。
- I have to see them. - No worries.

931
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:02,337
——谢谢。——谢谢。
- Thank you. - Thank you.

932
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:11,012
-这是谁画的?——毕加索。
- Hey, who drew this? - Pablo Picasso.

933
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:15,308
我自己也是个酒鬼，但我从没喝得那么醉过。
I'm a drinking man myself, but I've never been that hammered.

934
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:26,778
这是小菜一碟。我对这一切都了如指掌。
This'll be a piece of cake. I know this lot backwards.

935
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:31,616
-在车里等着。——呃,米克吗?
- Wait in the car. - Uh, Mick?

936
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:35,120
我本来想说"小心点"
I was gonna say, "be careful,"

937
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:39,332
但我想这对一个捕猎鳄鱼的人来说有点蠢。
but I guess that's kind of a dumb thing to say to someone who hunts crocodiles.

938
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,542
不用担心。
No worries.

939
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:58,977
当然，这里的区别很明显，但在电影中，这是一个完美的匹配。
Of course the difference is obvious here, but on film, it's a perfect match.

940
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,979
——不是吗?-好了，我们拿到画了。
- Isn't it? - All right, we have the paintings.

941
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:04,608
我们还得继续搞这破电影生意吗?
Now must we continue with this stupid movie business bullshit?

942
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:06,484
你真的不明白，是吗?
You really don't get it, do you?

943
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,487
上帝就在细节中。
God is in the details.

944
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,407
这些是作为电影道具进入这个国家的。
These came into the country as film props.

945
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,827
如果有人想看，"抱歉，我们烧了。
Anyone wants to see them, "sorry, we burned them.

946
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:18,246
“想要证明吗?去看电影吧。”
"Want proof? Go see the movie."

947
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:23,168
死胡同。辉煌。
Dead end. Brilliant.

948
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,017
卡尔，我们需要你的帮助。
Carl, we need your help.

949
01:14:46,441 --> 01:14:49,235
卡尔，那幅画应该盖起来。
Carl, that painting should be covered.

950
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:50,979
我马上就来。
I'll be with you in a moment.

951
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:55,241
-那他是谁?——阻止他!
- Then who the hell is that? - Stop him!

952
01:14:55,742 --> 01:14:57,452
之后他!很快!
After him! Quickly!

953
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:01,331
拍摄低!不要撞到画!
Shoot low! Don't hit the painting!

954
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:04,376
之后他!封锁停车场!
After him! Seal off the lot!

955
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:05,669
快!持有这种!
Quick! Hold this!

956
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:06,753
——什么?——谢谢。
- What? - Thanks.

957
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:49,671
他跑进来了。Dravos跟着他。
He ran in here. Dravos followed him.

958
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:53,091
你守住所有出口。进去帮德拉佛把他赶出来。
You cover all the exits. Go in and help dravos flush him out.

959
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:59,264
嘘。我知道，我知道。米克让我在这里等。
Shh. I know, I know. Mick said to wait here.

960
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:01,266
这是他的半身像，对吧?
It's his bust, right?

961
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,309
我知道。我只是看看。
I know. I was just looking.

962
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:07,105
你是怎么来的?谁在照顾米奇?
How'd you get here anyway? Who's looking after Mikey?

963
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:09,983
马西斯小姐，他学校的老师。
Miss Mathis, his teacher from school.

964
01:16:10,442 --> 01:16:11,818
我开着她的车跟踪你。
I followed you in her car.

965
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:57,363
哦。我让你稍等。
Oh. I'll just keep you on hold.

966
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:16,549
“请稍等。”哈!我只是带着它们出来。
"Keep you on hold." Ha! I just come out with them.

967
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:21,596
-这个人是谁?他怎么……-我想他就是那只猴子。
- Who is this man? How does he... - I think he's the monkey guy.

968
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:24,891
米克，训练猴子的人。相同的帽子。
Mick, the guy that trains the monkey. Same hat.

969
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:28,394
那猴子是怎么知道画的?
How would the monkey guy know about the paintings?

970
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:31,731
他是独自一人吗?你最好祈祷他还活着。
Is he alone? You better hope he's still alive.

971
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:32,857
在那里。
Get in there.

972
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,088
我们进入了第四阶段。我们会按你的方式冲他
We're entering stage four. We'll flush him your way.

973
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:39,113
罗杰。
Roger that.

974
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:54,480
哦!
Oh!

975
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,376
拍摄低。我们要活捉他。
Shoot low. We need him alive.

976
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,331
小心。
Watch out.

977
01:19:58,795 --> 01:19:59,796
在墙上。
For the wall.

978
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:11,557
他去了丛林布景。
He's gone to the jungle set.

979
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,435
进出那里只有一条路。我在它。
There's only one way in and out of there. I'm on it.

980
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:16,616
在我们到达之前守住大门。
Just cover the gate till we get there.

981
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:21,335
嘿!嘿!嘿!嘿!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

982
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:25,923
高5。
High five.

983
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:29,685
-斯坦,副本。-老大说不要一个人进去。
- Stan, copy. - Boss said don't go in there alone.

984
01:21:30,428 --> 01:21:32,930
-斯坦?斯坦?-太迟了，伙计。
- Stan? Stan? - Too late, mate.

985
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:34,098
斯坦!
Stan!

986
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:56,746
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

987
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:05,630
做到了,嗯…它……我想它错过了。
Did it, um... It... it missed, I think.

988
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,176
我希望。
I hope.

989
01:22:27,318 --> 01:22:28,402
你好,米克。
Hi, Mick.

990
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,699
我知道你还在。
I know you're still here.

991
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,996
我们为什么不停止这个愚蠢的游戏呢?
Why don't we stop playing this silly game?

992
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:46,504
你可以出来加入你的朋友。
You can come out and join your friends.

993
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:50,424
我已经没有耐心了!
I have no more Patience for this!

994
01:22:51,676 --> 01:22:55,763
好吧,你赢了。我出来。
Okay, you win. I'm coming out.

995
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:03,938
只是不要突然行动。
Just don't make any sudden moves.

996
01:23:04,981 --> 01:23:07,859
你不必这么正式。我们都是朋友。
You don't have to be so formal. We're all friends.

997
01:23:07,942 --> 01:23:10,611
你可以把手放低。
You can lower your hands.

998
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:15,324
我不能降低这个。
Well, I can't really lower this one.

999
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:22,874
-为什么?-因为如果我放下这只胳膊，打断眼神交流，他可能会下来把你撕成碎片。
- And why is that? - 'Cause if I put this arm down and break eye contact, he might come down here and tear you apart.

1000
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,210
——谁?-住在里面的家伙。
- Who? - Fella who lives in there.

1001
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:33,509
看。在岩石上。
Look. Up on the rock.

1002
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:42,685
你疯了吗?点38口径的手枪杀不了一头狮子。
Are you nuts? You can't kill a lion with a .38 pistol.

1003
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:44,353
你会惹毛他的。
You'll just piss him off.

1004
01:23:46,314 --> 01:23:49,150
如果你开枪，最好别让他们流血。
If you shoot anyone, they better not bleed.

1005
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:51,569
是啊，狮子闻到血腥味就会发狂。
Yeah, lions go berserk when they smell blood.

1006
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:57,700
如果我是你，我会慢慢倒进笼子里。
If I was you, I'd back up slowly into that cage.

1007
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:12,173
嗯,是的。当然，那是一头温顺的狮子。
Uh, yeah. Surely, that's a, uh, tame lion.

1008
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:15,384
是的。你可能是对的。
Yeah. You could be right.

1009
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,684
我拍你。你流血。
I shoot you. You bleed.

1010
01:24:24,477 --> 01:24:25,895
我抓住机会。
I take my chances.

1011
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:28,064
是的，但他不是你的问题。
Yeah, but he's not your problem.

1012
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:30,733
我担心的是他老婆。
It's his missus I'm worried about.

1013
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:37,156
我对付不了她。
I can't handle her.

1014
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,410
我想她有经前综合症。可以从她的眼睛里看出来。
She's got pms, I think. Can see it in her eyes.

1015
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,124
不管怎样，你做你该做的。
Anyway, you do what you have to do.

1016
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:51,545
我要在他岳母下来之前进笼子。
I'm getting in the cage before his mother-in-law comes down.

1017
01:24:53,214 --> 01:24:55,383
不!不!
No! No!

1018
01:24:57,218 --> 01:25:00,178
-你去开门!快开门!-把枪给我把枪给我。
- You open the door! Open the door now! - Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

1019
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:05,768
你拿枪指着我妻子的头。
You held a gun to my wife's head.

1020
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:07,603
——嗯?——这是不可原谅的。
- Huh? - That's unforgivable.

1021
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,207
所以我要帮你减肥。
So I'm gonna help you lose some weight.

1022
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:14,318
——如何?-维吉尔会下来咬你的肥屁股一大块。
- How? - Virgil's gonna come down here and bite a big chunk out of your fat ass.

1023
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:18,114
维吉尔,午餐!
Virgil, lunch!

1024
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:26,289
坐!
Sit!

1025
01:25:41,721 --> 01:25:45,683
如果你敢碰我，我就把你告个精光。
If you touch me, I will sue you for every cent you've got.

1026
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:48,227
哈!听起来很公平。
Ha! Well, that sounds fair.

1027
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:54,608
嘿，大约40美元。
Hey, that's about 40 bucks.

1028
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:57,862
这是公平的交易。
It's a fair deal.

1029
01:25:57,987 --> 01:25:58,988
讨价还价。
Bargain.

1030
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:01,407
你好吗，小姐?
And how are you, miss?

1031
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:04,702
-你在这里做什么?-我不得不这么做
- What the hell were you doing in here? - Well, I had to.

1032
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:08,748
我手机没电了，我得进来找个电话打911。
My cell phone went dead, and I had to come in here to find a phone to call 911.

1033
01:26:09,123 --> 01:26:11,959
你是聪明的,苏。我从来没有想过。
You're clever, sue. I never would've thought of that.

1034
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:14,045
那是因为她是邓迪人。
Yeah, well, that's because she's a dundee.

1035
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,090
或者她应该是。
Or she ought to be.

1036
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:24,221
小杰，盯紧那些暴徒，把耳朵堵上。
Uh, Jacko, keep an eye on the goons and, uh, block your ears.

1037
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:27,850
——什么?-堵住耳朵。私人谈话。
- What? - Block your ears. Private talk.

1038
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:29,810
哦。不用担心,伴侣。
Oh. No worries, mate.

1039
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:35,316
我得告诉你这个。
Uh, I have to tell you this.

1040
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:39,487
我这辈子第一次真的很害怕。
I was just really scared for the first time in my life.

1041
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:42,948
好吧,没关系。大多数人害怕狮子。
Well, that's okay. Most people are frightened of lions.

1042
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:45,534
不，不是狮子。他们只是饿了。
No, not the lions. They're just hungry.

1043
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:48,412
当我看到那个暴徒拿枪指着你的头。
It's when I saw that goon with a gun at your head.

1044
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,333
那时我才意识到我有多…
That's when I realized how much I, uh...

1045
01:26:57,588 --> 01:27:01,425
你知道,嗯…你愿意嫁给我吗?
You know, um... Will you marry me?

1046
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:06,639
你做事确实很急，对吧，米克?
Well, you do rush into things, don't you, Mick?

1047
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:10,393
你确定不是因为浪漫的背景吗?
Are you sure it's not just the romantic setting?

1048
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:19,944
当地专家表示，这些复原艺术品的价值可能高达3亿美元。
Local experts say the value of the recovered art could run as high as $300 million.

1049
01:27:20,194 --> 01:27:23,364
最新消息，让我们连线现场的玛尔塔·沃勒。玛尔塔吗?
For the very latest, let's go live to marta waller at the scene. Marta?

1050
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:28,953
谢谢,哈尔。现在警察正在对这些价值连城的画作进行保护。
Thanks, hal. Right now the police are taking these priceless paintings into protective custody.

1051
01:27:29,328 --> 01:27:37,670
在我身后和侦探说话的那个女人，是苏·查尔顿女士，她是《新闻日报》的记者，带领侦探们找到了失窃的名作。
The woman behind me talking to the detective, is Ms. Sue charleton, the newsday reporter who led detectives to the cache of stolen masterpieces.

1052
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:44,301
不幸的是，真正抓住小偷的卧底特工拒绝接受摄像机采访。
Unfortunately, the undercover agent who actually captured the thieves declined to be interviewed on camera.

1053
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:49,723
不过，今晚早些时候，他确实告诉我，他实际上是艺术界的知名专家。
However, earlier tonight, he did tell me he is, in fact, a known expert in the art world.

1054
01:27:49,974 --> 01:27:52,685
他不是把臭鼬放在高速公路上的那个人吗?
Isn't that the guy who had the skunk on the freeway?

1055
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:53,769
嘿,哈尔!
Hey, hal!

1056
01:27:53,853 --> 01:27:56,355
呃,w……随着故事的展开，我们会有更多消息。
Uh, w... we'll have more as the story unfolds.

1057
01:27:56,439 --> 01:28:07,074
现在，让我们去马里布，昨晚将近四分之一英寸的大雨导致了灾难性的洪水和沿太平洋海岸高速公路的大规模泥石流。
Right now, let's go to Malibu where last night's downpour of almost a quarter inch of rain resulted in disastrous flooding and massive mud slides along the pacific coast highway.

1058
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:15,207
苏，你愿意接受拉瑞金做你的丈夫吗?
Sue, do you accept this larrikin as your wedded husband?

1059
01:28:16,459 --> 01:28:17,460
我做的事。
I do.

1060
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:21,255
米克，你愿意接受这位可爱的女士做你的妻子吗?
Mick, do you accept this lovely lady as your wedded wife?

1061
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:25,759
不用担心。
No worries.

1062
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:28,387
很好。
Fair enough.

1063
01:28:29,263 --> 01:28:32,850
我现在宣布你们结为夫妻。
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1064
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:41,984
-干得好，米克。——好吧!
- Good on you, Mick. - All right!

1065
01:28:53,913 --> 01:28:56,457
现在正式了，伙计。你是米克·邓迪二世。
It's official now, mate. You're Mick dundee ii.

1066
01:28:56,874 --> 01:29:06,884
——酷。-现在我想我们会等着看你是另一个鳄鱼邓迪还是迈克尔邓迪，报业大亨。
- Cool. - Now I guess we'll wait and see whether you turn out to be another crocodile dundee or Michael dundee, newspaper tycoon.

1067
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,303
哦，这是显而易见的，爸爸。
Oh, that's a no-brainer, dad.

1068
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:15,059
我要做鳄鱼邓迪，猎人和大报社的有钱老板。
I'm gonna be crocodile dundee, hunter and rich owner of a big newspaper.

1069
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:16,810
是啊，我没举哑铃。
Yeah, I didn't raise a dumbbell.

1070
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:19,855
把这个戴上拍照。
Put this on for the photos.

1071
01:29:21,357 --> 01:29:22,358
对什么?
What for?

1072
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:24,360
因为你穿那套衣服看起来像个傻瓜。
'Cause you look like a dork in that suit.

1073
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:25,694
不,我不喜欢。
No, I don't.

1074
01:29:25,945 --> 01:29:27,863
你应该看起来像鳄鱼邓迪。
You should look like crocodile dundee.

1075
01:29:35,329 --> 01:29:37,831
不，我想我狩猎鳄鱼的日子结束了。
No, I think my crocodile hunting days are over.

1076
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:44,421
从现在开始，我叫米克·邓迪，私家侦探。
Yeah, from here on in, it's Mick dundee, private eye.

1077
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,468
不。我kiddin”。
Nah. I'm kiddin'.

我来自南半球

1079
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:10,948
啤酒在流动，人在沸腾
the beer does flow and men chunder

1080
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:15,369
你没听见吗你没听见雷声吗?
can't you hear can't you hear the thunder?

1081
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:24,253
你最好跑，你最好找个掩护，是的，坐着一辆炸康比
You better run you better take cover, yeah traveling in a fried-out kombi

1082
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:42,438
在一个充满僵尸的嬉皮小径上我遇到了一个奇怪的女士她让我紧张她带我进去，给我早餐她说，你来自一个陆地下吗?
on a hippie trail head full of zombie I met a strange lady she made me nervous she took me in and gave me breakfast she said, do you come from a land down under?

1083
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:47,151
女人发光，男人掠夺
Where women glow and men plunder

1084
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:51,572
你没听见吗你没听见雷声吗?

你最好跑，你最好找个地方躲起来
You better run you better take cover, yeah

1086

在布鲁塞尔，一个身高六英尺四英寸、肌肉发达的男人买面包时说，你会说我的语言吗，兄弟?
Buying bread from a man in Brussels he was six foot four and full of muscle lsaid, do you speak my language, brother?

1087
01:31:16,347 --> 01:31:23,479
他只是笑了笑，给了我一个咸味三明治，他说，我来自澳大利亚
He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich he said, I come from a land down under

1088
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:28,150
哪里有啤酒流，哪里有男人吐
where beer does flow and men chunder

1089
01:31:30,194 --> 01:31:32,655
你没听见吗你没听见雷声吗?
can't you hear can't you hear the thunder?

1090
01:31:34,365 --> 01:31:39,161

You better run you better take cover, yeah

1091
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:46,335
躺在孟买的一间小屋里
lying in a den in Bombay

1092
01:31:48,462 --> 01:31:55,886
我对那个人说:你是想引诱我吗?
with a slack jaw and not a lot to say I said to the man are you trying to tempt me?

1093
01:31:57,763 --> 01:32:04,353
“因为我来自富饶之地，”他说，“你来自海底吗?”
Because I come from the land of plenty he said, do you come from a land down under?
