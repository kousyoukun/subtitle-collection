00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,400
- Who?
- Princess Pei Pei.

315
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,880
She was kidnapped
from the Forbidden City.

316
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,160
Forbidden City?
I like that, the Forbidden City.

317
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,880
A princess kidnapped.
It's so mysterious. Oh, go ahead.

318
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,120
The emperor sent us
to get her back.

319
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,360
Us? You mean your friends
from the train?

320
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,320
They are also Imperial Guards.
They have four days to bring
the gold to Carson City.

321
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,160
- What gold?
- The gold for the princess.

322
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,960
The gold--
Was the gold on the train?

323
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,720
Yes.

324
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,880
How much gold?

325
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,280
One hundred thousand pieces.

326
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Sir? Sir?
Could you hand us that book, please?

327
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,640
Sir, there's been
a mistake. He has--

328
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,960
Sir-- Yeah.

329
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,840
We're gonna get that book,
and we're gonna get you out of here.

330
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,600
- You help me escape?
- Shh. Yes.

331
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,560
- Why?
- Why? I'm gonna tell you why.

332
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,080
Because there are some things
in this world that are just wrong,

333
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,040
and stealing a princess
is one of them.

334
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,160
Yeah.
That's wrong.

335
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,240
I'll tell you another thing.
I feel guilty about leading you
up that mountain.

336
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,440
What was I thinking?
How much time did we waste there?

337
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,160
That was stupid.
It wasn't funny. All right?

338
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,440
Now, sit tight and let me
figure this out.

339
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,880
All right,
come on, Roy.

340
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,800
Maybe-- Maybe I pretend to be sick, then
attack the guards when they come in.

341
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,000
Okay, you mean
the sick prisoner routine?

342
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,280
Yeah. Does that still
work in China?

343
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,280
'Cause here it's sorta
been done to death.

344
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,320
- I have another idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.

345
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,560
Here's how you help me. You
stay on your side of the room,
let me figure it out over here.

346
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,760
Okay, you play over there.

347
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,800
Think. Think.
What do we got here? Oh, yeah.

348
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,680
Okay.

349
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,280
We got wood. We got a wall
made out of wood.

350
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,360
That's good.
Oh, we got pillows.

351
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,240
We got pillows, sheets.
We got the sheets and the mattress.

352
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,760
Okay, let's put it all together.
Let's think. Add it up, add it up.

353
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,680
What do we got?
What do we got?

354
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,000
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop!

355
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,160
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

356
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,320
- Hold this for me.
- No, no. That's your shirt.
You hold it.

357
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,160
I like your energy,
but I'm not with you.

358
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,720
- When the shirt gets wet,
it doesn't break.
- I don't know what that means.

359
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,000
And then--

360
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,560
Okay. And then what--
Then with the wet shirt, you--

361
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,840
You bend the bars.
That's the pay-off.

362
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,840
Don't waste my time
with stuff like that, okay?

363
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,360
A 2,000-year-old civilization,
that's all you can come up with?

364
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,760
Shame on you.
Shame on you.

365
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,280
Come on. Stop, please.
It's embarrassing.

[Metal Creaking]

367
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,240
- See? I told you so.
- No, you said, "Wet shirt don't break,"

368
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,280
not " Piss shirt
bend bar."

369
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,880
- Twist it.
- Help.

370
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,360
Okay, there.
Get it. There you go.

Just one more.
Yeah.

You're as strong as an ox!
Go! You can do it!

00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,880
There, you got it!
We're gettin' it!

374
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,440
- Hold it for me. I'll get through.
- Okay.

375
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,840
No, no, no. You hold it
and I'll go through.

[Groans]
No! Not your hand! Stop.

377

- Hold it.
- Adios, sucker.

378
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,440
- What?
- I'm just kidding. Come on. Go.

I wouldn't leave
my old pal there.

Go.
Really squeeze.

No, no, no, no.
Grab this, grab that.

Work your magic
right here.

-Too dry.
-What? Juice it up. Juice it up. Go.

I can't!
No more!

Ah, damn it.

- Hurry up.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

389
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,200
- Stop! Don't look at me.
- Relax!

- Relax. It'll come.
- Thanks.

- That helps. Yeah. Good.
- Is that called relax?

Whoa!

you're here. Get the guns!

- Get my book!
- I got it!

Whoa, whoa.
Wow, who's the pretty lady?

396
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,480
- That's my wife.
- How long you been in this country?

397
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,880
- Four days.
- Nice work.

Looks like Fido's giving you
some problems there.

404
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,560
You want me to, uh,
give you a hand?

405

- No, I can do it.
- Sure, you can.

406
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,080
How is a greenhorn like you
gonna make it to Carson City. ..

407
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,840
and rescue
this princess?

Stop, stop, stop, stop.

I can't take it any more.
Watch me do it.

Get it like this
and you put it up high.

See? It'll drift back
when you're riding.

412

- All right, I'll do it.
- Do what?

413
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,680
Take you to Carson City,
help you rescue Princess " Pee Pee."

414
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,360
Pei Pei. You do not
care about the princess.

415
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,720
You don't know me
very well, do you?

416
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,640
Tell you one thing-- I'd hate
to think of an innocent member. ..

417
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,680
of Chinese nobility
suffering.

Tell you that.

You people believe in karma
over there, right?

Well, I've been thinking.
There must be a reason why
we keep running into each other.

421
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,160
I've ridden with some terrible men--
just people I couldn't trust.

But when I
look at you,

there's something different
about you, and I can see it.

424
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,400
I can see it
in your eyes.

425

It's what the Indians
call Chippichawa.

426
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,880
- What's that?
- Chippichawa is nobility.

And you have it
in spades.

in your hand?

Well, it's customary,
to seal the deal.

Roy O'Bannon ain't got no partner,

from the damn train!

Just like that.
See, at kind of a rakish angle.

- How do I look?

- That's a terrible cowboy name.
- Why?

No, come on, that's not gonna work.
That's horrible.

- No!

It doesn't look
that bad, actually.

Now, before we go to Carson City, I
want to teach you some stuff. Come on.

You just follow me.

- What's that?
- Sensitivity. Increased reflexes.

Now, these are guns. These can be
your best friend or worst enemy.

That's a spin in my left hand.
That's a spin in my right hand.

463
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,360
That's two spins. Now, here,
I'm gonna let you hang onto this.

464
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,520
See? Whoa. Be careful.
Always be ready. Always be ready.

465
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,880
Now, try to exhale
for long-range shots,

466
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,880
inhale for short-range.

467
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,760
All right, now cover up your ears,
'cause this could be loud.

Cover up your ears.

469
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,840
I am like a wild horse.
You can't tame me.

470
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,160
You put the oats in the pen, though,
and I'll come in for a nibble every day.

471
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,080
But if you ever shut that gate,
I'll jump the fence.
You'll never see me again.

472
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,680
Thing about your husband--
and this is nothing against him,

473
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,680
because I really
like him--

474
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,040
he comes from a very
male-dominated society.

¤ I can smell a pig
from a mile away¤

482
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,480
Let me put it this way--

483
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,600
my horse is definitely
not my best friend.

484

Now, people start
looking at you funny,

487

all you gotta say is,
" Howdy, partner."

- Howdy, partner?
- Faster than that or people will
think you're slow in the head.

489

What happened to " Mr. Shanghai Kid"?
"Oh, I'm a wanted man"?

536
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,600
- Why?
- 'Cause you're an outlaw.

Drives the posse crazy.
