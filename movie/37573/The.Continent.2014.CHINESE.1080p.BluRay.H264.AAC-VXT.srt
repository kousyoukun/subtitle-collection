1
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:15,725
Although my birth

2
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,393
wasn't planned

3
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,730
that's not why I'm called Hu Sheng

4
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,401
I live on one of the eastern islands

5
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,321
It's prosperous here now

6
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,450
A few years ago

7
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,160
it wasn't like this

8
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,746
Everyone

9
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,414
had left the island

10
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,167
My two best friends and I

11
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,169
were the last to leave

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,131
They all thought

13
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,134
I was mentally challenged

14
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,303
except my two friends

15
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,346
which made me adore them

16
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,474
My pal, Haohan

17
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,060
has bummed around the world

18
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,687
His father died at sea

19
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,774
in Typhoon 17 of 1994

20
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,568
Haohan was only 10 years old back then

21
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,278
Today I'm on stage

22
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,239
and not afraid to embarrass myself

23
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,658
I want to tell everyone

24
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,286
we're going to...

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,497
Hello?

26
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,832
Hello?

27
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,377
He's very strong

28
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,297
I admire him greatly

29
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:32,927
Jiang He

30
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,054
was the only teacher on the island

31
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,098
He's weird

32
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,766
He likes to eat toast

33
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,392
with chilli sauce

34
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,730
He was assigned to the west
when the island was abandoned

35
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,775
Haohan drove him there

36
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:51,070
Three of us hit the road

37
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,406
We planned to drive across the country

38
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:55,866
During the trip

39
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,369
I'll meet my childhood neighbour girl

40
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,662
Zhou Mo

41
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,581
and Liu Yingying

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,041
Haohan's dream lover

43
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,210
Whom had been writing to for years

44
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:08,254
without seeing each other ever

45
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,422
I was thrilled

46
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,424
but on the first day

47
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,760
I was left alone

48
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,846
I was so sad

49
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,600
I waited for them for three years

50
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,061
until one day

51
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,021
I met a tourist here

52
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,773
He read me a book

53
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,899
I suddenly realized

54
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,359
what had happened to them

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,444
back in that night

56
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,946
This is the story of their journey

57
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,197
On the first day

58
00:03:58,364 --> 00:03:59,365
We'll

59
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,700
go to see Zhuo Mo

60
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,869
On the second day Haohan

61
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,121
will meet Liu Yingying

62
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,290
On the third and fourth days

63
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,459
they will sleep for two days

64
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,794
Shut up

65
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,462
On the fifth day

66
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,421
We will

67
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,257
drive Jiang He to the western hell

68
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,466
Stop

69
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,634
Jiang He, the government plans to abandon

70
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,511
small islands for developing the big ones

71
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,720
Our island is so big

72
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,222
Why's it being called small?

73
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:24,723
By the way

74
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,392
is there any ship waiting for us?

75
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,104
This island is only 1.7 square km.

76
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,522
The coastline

77
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,399
is only 7.7 km. long

78
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,360
Do you think it's big?

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,113
Yeah

80
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:43,993
It's too bad

81
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,079
This is one of China's

82
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,706
most eastern islands

83
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,749
We could develop it

84
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,917
into a beautiful resort, like Lijiang

85
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,712
Look at it now

86
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,255
like a ghost town

87
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,799
I returned here two years ago

88
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,260
to develop tourism

89
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,596
Now I have to leave

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,683
Look

91
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,561
This is where sunlight reaches China first

92
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,355
It's not exactly the Sunshine Coast

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,482
but we can call it

94
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:16,775
Yang Guang Beach

95
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,902
Jiang He

96
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,279
Your English is better than ours

97
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,281
How do you say it in English?

98
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,949
Eh... Sun

99
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,075
Hey I know

100
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,618
Son of Bitch (Sun of Beach)

101
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,960
Sun of Beach?

102
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,672
Let me show you something

103
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,640
I spent all of my three years savings

104
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,145
to buy this

105
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,315
What do you think?

106
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,150
Nice

107
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,446
What's wrong with the roof?

108
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,989
I modified somewhat

109
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,324
after market addition

110
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,492
Haohan

111
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:07,826
I've never seen you drive it

112
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,752
After being away from home

113
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,504
you notice that

114
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,883
buildings are so small

115
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,844
trees are so tiny

116
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,763
roads are so short

117
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,432
and streets are so narrow

118
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:36,855
Every memory

119
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,108
I have of my home

120
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,526
is different from reality

121
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,862
How?

122
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:47,991
I mean

123
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,536
after I shipped my car back

124
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,745
I found that

125
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,873
the damn roads were too narrow to drive

126
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,002
I'm still worried

127
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,380
We have thousands of kilometers to drive

128
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:02,881
What if we get separated?

129
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,383
Don't worry about that

130
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,763
We're travelling 3980 km.

131
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,932
If you get lost

132
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,809
just stay where you are

133
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:14,852
I've sorted out everything

134
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,145
I'm ready to go

135
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,022
If we follow my plan

136
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,524
everything will be fine

137
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,569
I know lots of people

138
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,821
My friends are everywhere

139
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,739
There's nothing to worry about

140
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,534
No matter where I shit

141
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,036
someone will send me toilet paper

142
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:50,262
Jiang He

143
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,680
why does Haohan

144
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,599
burn down his house?

145
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,601
If the fire spreads too fast

146
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,728
will Zhou Mo's house and mine be affected?

147
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,731
I want to keep my house here

148
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,982
Keep it forever

149
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,275
If you can't take it, then drop it

150
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,610
If you decide to drop it, then forget it

151
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,320
according to my dad

152
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:15,787
Haohan

153
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,456
Did you move the gas canister out?

154
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,166
Nope

155
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:36,725
"When a ship sinks into the ocean"

156
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:44,024
"When a person becomes a mystery"

157
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,985
"You don't know"

158
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,489
"why they leave"

159
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:57,371
"His farewell is his last word"

160
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:05,087
"When a car disappears into the horizon"

161
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:12,261
"When the past stands as a mystery"

162
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,180
"You don't know"

163
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,684
"why they leave"

164
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:25,607
"Just like you don't know where the end is"

165
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:33,282
"When every star falls from the Milky Way"

166
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:39,246
"It's time to say goodbye to myself"

167
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:46,712
"There is no need to know"

168
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,552
"What has been lost is lost forever"

169
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:01,977
It's an adventure

170
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:02,978
Let's take a selfie first

171
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,187
Shouldn't we move back a bit?

172
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,022
Shut up

173
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:05,897
It's going to snap the shot

174
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:06,732
Let's move forward

175
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:07,899
to get a better shot

176
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,568
Yeah

177
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,821
Hu Sheng

178
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,157
Let's buy Zhou Mo a gift when we get there

179
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,326
Should we tell her

180
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,452
about her house...

181
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,870
No

182
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,747
Will Zhou Mo still...

183
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,956
No

184
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,499
remember us?

185
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,230
Stand-in, off stage

186
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,278
Okay

187
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,073
Ready

188
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,407
Silence

189
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,659
Rolling

190
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,410
Scene 36, roll 11, take 4

191
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,495
Action

192
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,755
Life is like

193
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:12,964
a slow boiled frog

194
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,635
Life in a city is alike the studio

195
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:17,803
It doesn't mean much

196
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,429
So why did you leave the island?

197
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,515
You are... Jiang?

198
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:22,683
Jiang He

199
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,017
Jiang He, let me tell you

200
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,228
You have to have connections

201
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,397
to be successful in small towns

202
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:29,856
At least

203
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,149
people are more equal in cities

204
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,567
Get it?

205
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,069
Hey

206
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,153
Am I right?

207
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:36,780
Right

208
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:38,824
But in cities

209
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,492
if you have connections

210
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,911
you can go further

211
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,995
Well, I've left my hometown

212
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,164
so I have to be successful

213
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,582
Right?

214
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,542
Jiang He?

215
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:49,668
It depends

216
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,294
All my jobs have been assigned

217
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,338
I prefer quiet places

218
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,048
I'm fine with my life

219
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,384
What are you afraid of?

220
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,844
A man shouldn't be so conservative

221
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,429
If you don't move forward

222
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,930
in life

223
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,014
you'll be left behind

224
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,141
It doesn't matter

225
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,016
Each to his own

226
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:05,851
Everyone gets what they deserve

227
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:06,935
My life's great

228
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,980
I'm going to be a TV hostess

229
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,440
and a dramatic

230
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,607
actress

231
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,817
with lines!

232
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,026
Awesome

233
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,027
Take it easy

234
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,446
They're always talking about you

235
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,447
Really?

236
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,406
What about me?

237
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,699
About how your house

238
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:21,950
was empty

239
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,076
and was blocking their sunshine

240
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,537
Then blow it up

241
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,289
We already have

242
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,708
We

243
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,209
haven't seen you for ages

244
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,419
You're prettier than I remember

245
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,545
Hehe

246
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,046
Hehe

247
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,340
Haohan

248
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,717
Since you miss Liu Yingying so much

249
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,552
why not meet her sooner?

250
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:41,887
I'm not successful yet

251
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:42,888
no need to rush

252
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:43,889
Hey

253
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,515
Eh?

254
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:46,683
You're still the same

255
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,186
Luckily my crush on you

256
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,395
ended when I was 10 years old

257
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,397
Where to now?

258
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,398
Turn right

259
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,152
I need to get changed

260
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,445
Don't take off without me

261
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,078
Sorry to keep you waiting

262
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,132
You were nuts about this star

263
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,343
I met him in a play

264
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,928
and asked him to autograph his photo

265
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,304
for you

266
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,266
Oh, him

267
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,228
I have a new idol

268
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,316
That outfit makes you look frumpy

269
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,361
I know, it doesn't suit me

270
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,779
Neither does this wig

271
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,447
The studio tells me what to wear

272
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,538
Well

273
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,748
I know

274
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,041
we weren't childhood sweethearts

275
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,210
but we grew up together

276
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,838
We should meet more often

277
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,719
I have to get back to work

278
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,637
Walk over with me

279
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,972
Sure

280
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:08,682
Wake up!

281
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:13,937
Flowers for you

282
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,647
Thanks, but I can't carry them

283
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,483
Remember to come and see me

284
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,193
if you guys

285
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,278
still haven't figured out your lives

286
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:21,778
Can't we see you

287
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:22,863
if we're successful?

288
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,823
You won't come in that case

289
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,534
We're not snobs

290
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,330
Where are you going?

291
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:33,832
To the next place we stop

292
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,085
Then go

293
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,503
See you

294
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:42,507
Hey

295
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,051
Where are you going?

296
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,553
To my next play

297
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,452
Let's go

298
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,915
Don't look back

299
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:22,672
Ready

300
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,410
I've lived in this city for six years

301
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:53,870
I barely have friends

302
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,288
I have four cats

303
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,123
People say I should get a dog

304
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,249
It's more masculine

305
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,919
But dogs need company

306
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,420
I like dogs

307
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,089
but don't want to look after one

308
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,091
At night

309
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,634
I stare out of my window and wonder

310
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,260
why there are so many people

311
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,096
but nobody to talk to

312
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,597
I'm sorry, Sir

313
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,808
but your time is up

314
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,142
But I

315
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:28,989
Is this the hotel?

316
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,281
Yeah

317
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:32,826
Why this one?

318
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,953
It's cheap and convenient

319
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,287
It was meant to be

320
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,725
Hello?

321
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:58,518
Hi?

322
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,898
Mr. Jiang?

323
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,316
Yeah

324
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,486
You booked our deluxe king suite

325
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:09,571
The deposit is 500 Yuan

326
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,990
Party of three?

327
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,825
I booked a family suit

328
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,118
on your website

329
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,287
It was updated seven years ago

330
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,164
Is it the corner room?

331
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,540
Eh

332
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:21,708
Yeah, the love nest at the corner

333
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,212
Hey guys

334
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,297
Ah?

335
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,007
I'm going for a cigarette

336
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,091
You shouldn't smoke like me

337
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,607
Shit, is this the room?

338
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,084
What happened?

339
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:05,668
It's broken

340
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,557
Where's the remote?

341
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:26,898
What now?

342
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,132
Forget it

343
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,425
The number's real but the photo's fake

344
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,011
I was fooled so many times

345
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,472
I'm going to the bathroom

346
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,785
"Escort Services"

347
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,051
Excuse me

348
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,278
Okay if I come in?

349
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,243
My name is Su Mi

350
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,374
Cool, the photo is real

351
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:19,844
Well

352
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,388
I haven't called you yet

353
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:23,973
Sooner or later you will

354
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,685
What happened to the curtain?

355
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,355
I pulled it too hard

356
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,981
You're that strong?

357
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,816
I cannot tell

358
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,568
I'll fix it later

359
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,613
You're...

360
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,115
I'm...

361
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,868
Let's get to business

362
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,787
568 Yuan per hour

363
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,455
868 Yuan per night

364
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,374
What's included in the night?

365
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,550
Actually I'm new in this

366
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,803
I'm not so skilled

367
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,805
Can you say something boss?

368
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:04,889
I'm not a boss

369
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:05,723
I'm a teacher

370
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,142
Hello, teacher

371
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,186
Hello, student

372
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,194
Let me show you

373
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,029
Normally

374
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,906
toast

375
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:22,949
isn't eaten with

376
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,158
chilli sauce

377
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,286
But

378
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:33,918
when I

379
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,462
was just a little girl

380
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,798
I asked my mother

381
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,718
what will I be?

382
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,928
Will I be pretty?

383
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,055
Will I be rich?

384
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,558
Here's what she said to me

385
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,644
Que sera sera

386
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,273
Whatever will be, will be

387
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,191
The future

388
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,776
is not ours to see

389
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,279
Que sera

390
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,406
sera

391
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,658
What will be

392
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,076
will be

393
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,788
When I grew up

394
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,249
and fell in love

395
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,250
I asked my sweetheart

396
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,835
what lies ahead?

397
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,254
Will we have rainbows

398
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,757
day after day?

399
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:21,966
Here's what

400
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,177
my sweetheart said

401
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:28,890
Well I believe you're a teacher

402
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,435
An English teacher?

403
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:34,228
No, a geography teacher

404
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,908
Uh...

405
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,454
It's static

406
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:52,663
It's these cheap clothes

407
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,374
I can stop it for you

408
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,714
Take off your shoes

409
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,138
Take off your stockings too

410
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,556
Huh?

411
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,686
Teacher

412
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,313
do you have a foot fetish?

413
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,440
You won't get static

414
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,858
if you stand on the ground in bare feet

415
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:26,906
Do you teach physics

416
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,366
or geography?

417
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,034
I know a bit about both

418
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,370
Next you'll be a physiology teacher?

419
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,047
You're so quiet

420
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,675
even make some noises

421
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:51,722
Is someone else here?

422
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:53,933
I forgot to tell you

423
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,017
my friend...

424
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:55,768
In this case

425
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:56,644
No, listen to me

426
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:58,229
You need to pay extra

427
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:01,774
Forget it

428
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,276
I won't take your business

429
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,237
Wait

430
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:13,578
Police!

431
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,288
Room inspection!

432
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,330
Open the door

433
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,915
What?

434
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,459
You have to protect me

435
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,418
Don't worry

436
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,210
You can count on him

437
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:21,836
What?

438
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,087
No, I mean... you can count on me!

439
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,839
What are you going to do?

440
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:26,090
Open the door!

441
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,592
Quickly!

442
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:32,096
Room inspection!

443
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,222
Open it!

444
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:39,353
Open it!

445
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,480
Police inspection!

446
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:45,485
Run!

447
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,403
Open the damn door!

448
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,698
If you get caught, your reputation...

449
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:51,782
Run

450
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,372
Open it!

451
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:00,291
Take your shoes

452
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:01,667
The car's out there

453
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,960
Somewhere

454
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,295
Room inspection!

455
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:05,588
Haohan, move your ass!

456
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,714
Police

457
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,011
Open the fucking door!

458
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,346
Open it!

459
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,139
What?

460
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:15,723
Just leave me

461
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,474
Go!

462
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,600
What's wrong?

463
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,018
My legs fell asleep

464
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:19,685
Hah?

465
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:20,645
Open the door!

466
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:21,646
You fucker

467
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,277
Shit! Open it

468
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,654
Open the door!

469
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:33,115
Open the door!

470
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,076
Open the damn door!

471
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:39,997
Haohan are you out?

472
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,374
Open the damn door!

473
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,419
Hurry up!

474
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:47,672
Run!

475
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:48,839
Open the damn door!

476
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,299
Run!

477
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,301
Holy shit!

478
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,010
Wait!

479
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:53,761
Just give me a minute!

480
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:54,720
Open the door!

481
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,389
Fuck open it!

482
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,185
Shit! Open it quickly

483
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,520
Keep jamming the door

484
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:07,608
Jiang He

485
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,068
Run!

486
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,028
Open this freaking door!

487
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,500
Sorry

488
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:42,351
Haohan

489
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,085
Give me the key

490
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:20,640
Pull over

491
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,724
Let me drive

492
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,317
You were freaked out

493
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:32,777
Let me drive

494
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:35,404
No

495
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:36,947
I'm driving

496
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,908
No one will ever change

497
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,159
my mind

498
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,167
You should change your career

499
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,004
You know what bugs me the most?

500
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,631
Guys using hookers then telling them to quit

501
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:56,133
You fucked when I was in the toilet?

502
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,635
I was speaking generally

503
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,640
Who are you?

504
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,475
Chill out

505
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,310
I'm

506
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:07,061
Ma Haohan

507
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,313
I hate your surname

508
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,359
No matter what my name is

509
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,985
you won't like it

510
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,071
We're just trying to help you

511
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:18,989
Got it?

512
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,783
Especially this guy beside me

513
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,076
Haohan, it's fine

514
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,663
Su Mi

515
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,039
Listen

516
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,379
Shove it

517
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,006
I did follow others' advice

518
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,800
Still end up with a miserable life

519
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:41,679
Uncle, I'm fine

520
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:43,264
Don't worry

521
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:44,890
Oh, I've a question

522
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,769
Why did you book a king sized bed?

523
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,730
There're three of us

524
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,151
Shit

525
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,194
Hu Sheng!

526
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:01,991
It's okay

527
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,410
Let me call him first

528
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,207
It's dangerous here

529
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,543
Do you feel sick?

530
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,433
Where's Hu Sheng?

531
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,935
We left him in the hotel

532
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,397
and his cell phone is here

533
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,858
He'll find a phone and call us, won't he?

534
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,195
He's smart enough to do this, right?

535
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,907
I'm not sure

536
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:47,828
I don't have any tissue

537
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:49,872
Here's a toast to wipe your mouth

538
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,423
I got car sick

539
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:04,970
Sorry, it's my fault

540
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,180
I'll drive slower

541
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,226
Does it contain preservatives?

542
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,227
No, it doesn't

543
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,269
Do you want some?

544
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,563
I can buy some more toastes for you

545
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,565
Let's go

546
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:27,910
Where're we going?

547
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,286
This guy beside me

548
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,040
used to teach on the eastern island

549
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,625
Now he's banished

550
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,585
to teach near the western border

551
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,546
He's always done what others tell him

552
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,673
He's never stood up for himself

553
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,176
Tonight he finally did

554
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,511
Haohan

555
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,179
I'm not banished

556
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,639
I've been relocated

557
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:49,849
to relocate knowledge

558
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:50,808
from the metropolis of the eastern island

559
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,810
to the wild expanses of the west

560
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,437
Huh?

561
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,982
Am I wrong?

562
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:03,988
That car's following us

563
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,824
I noticed

564
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,952
It'd better not be the cops

565
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:23,674
Drive to the right

566
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:24,842
Park over there

567
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,399
If we got caught

568
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,776
Our reputation would be toasted

569
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:45,112
Losing my reputation...

570
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:47,781
Do I even have a reputation

571
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,450
to lose?

572
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,201
You're still young

573
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,537
You can start a fresh life

574
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,372
Mr. Jiang

575
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,374
Let me tell you one last time

576
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,627
I'm not your student

577
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,631
Don't try to be responsible to everyone you meet

578
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,758
and tell them what to do

579
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,887
I will fly out of here

580
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,556
to another country soon

581
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,225
It's my life to live

582
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,685
not yours

583
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,396
Okay

584
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,023
Let's get some rest

585
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,942
We can talk about it tomorrow

586
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,568
Go to sleep

587
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,528
I know nothing about you guys

588
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,364
I will keep myself awake

589
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,778
I haven't bought my plane ticket yet

590
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,531
Let's get out of here!

591
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,741
Go!

592
00:33:58,996 --> 00:33:59,872
Jiang He

593
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,749
Fill it full

594
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:02,958
I'm going for a smoke

595
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,501
You should quit smoking

596
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:40,704
Sister

597
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,039
Sister

598
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,499
We're here

599
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:44,792
Stop!

600
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:47,711
There's no time

601
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,588
to text on WeChat

602
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,048
Go get her!

603
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:03,477
I don't care who you are

604
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,562
leave my friend alone

605
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,398
This is family business

606
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:09,608
Get out of my way

607
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:15,531
Sister

608
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,241
I bought some stuff...

609
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,793
What took you guys so long?

610
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,384
Don't you get it?

611
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,469
She's with them

612
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,222
Last night was a scam

613
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,598
We even ran away

614
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,643
with their bait... he

615
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:45,686
What the...

616
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:46,145
Stop!

617
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,646
Stop!

618
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,872
You two talk

619
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,207
Let them talk

620
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:15,966
Truthfully

621
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,343
I don't know if you're really a teacher

622
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,179
but I'm not a hooker

623
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:25,225
I'm pregnant

624
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:26,810
The guy's an asshole

625
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,980
I'm leaving the country to give birth

626
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:31,440
I need money

627
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,067
Picking up prostitutes isn't right

628
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,485
so scamming johns isn't wrong

629
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,153
I'm not a...

630
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,654
I'm sick and tired

631
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,324
of your advice

632
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,619
I was always an excellent student

633
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,037
Why do you advice me to be good?

634
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,209
If we ever meet again

635
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,502
I'll tell you my stories

636
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,258
It's a pity that we have to say goodbye

637
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,843
Su Mi

638
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:06,725
(Sister)

639
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:13,023
(I found your stockings)

640
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,903
(Brother, I think I'm)

641
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,030
(in love with)

642
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,783
(that guy)

643
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:28,455
(Have you forgotten what your asshole ex did?)

644
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:36,713
No, I haven't

645
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:39,091
Wait

646
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:57,985
Scratch the positive end of the battery

647
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,239
against your pants

648
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,158
It'll get rid of the static

649
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,411
It doesn't matter

650
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,037
The weather's getting warmer

651
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,499
But winter comes every year

652
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,917
Not where I'm going

653
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,924
Do you guys always steal remotes?

654
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:23,802
Su Mi

655
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,611
Uncle, what happened to your hand?

656
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,113
Let's go

657
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,489
I want to tell you something

658
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,494
What you've done is wrong

659
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:50,954
No matter how tough life is

660
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,289
cheating is never right

661
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,374
You can borrow money

662
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,126
What's the difference

663
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,627
between borrowing money and cheating?

664
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,214
Borrowing money is cheating friends

665
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,384
What we've done isn't any worse

666
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:07,637
You can't do this any longer

667
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,527
Young people today

668
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,488
don't have a sense of social morality

669
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,656
smoking at gas stations

670
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,950
and littering cigarette butts

671
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:31,036
Hey

672
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,245
Shut up

673
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,997
If you dare call the police

674
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,499
you'll destroy her life

675
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,710
We're all in the same boat; nobody's better off

676
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:40,670
Let's go our separate ways

677
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,316
No one cares more for you than your family

678
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,279
Let's go

679
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:26,216
You're wrong

680
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,969
Only kids think there's a right and a wrong

681
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,720
Adults care about pros and cons

682
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,473
I know you're not a good guy

683
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,101
but you're not even a bad guy

684
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,229
How can you be so spineless?

685
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,567
Say what you want

686
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:44,359
but...

687
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:45,819
I'll give you some advice

688
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,487
I'll give you some too

689
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:49,739
Don't be offended

690
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:50,866
Do you know what you're saying?

691
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:52,200
Giving advice to me?

692
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,744
But I do have advice for you

693
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,246
You should never

694
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,622
put diesel in a gas tank

695
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,600
(Be safe)

696
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,478
What's that mean?

697
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,687
He said fuck off!

698
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:21,938
There's no need to keep in touch

699
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,523
He also said

700
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,066
Su Mi is a nice girl

701
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,943
She deserves better

702
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,488
than scumbags like you

703
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,780
She'll be happy again

704
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,200
I'm tough

705
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,576
It'd be a piece of cake to take you down

706
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,370
If you dare follow

707
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,122
I'll run over you

708
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,357
"when I was just a little girl"

709
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,317
"I asked my mother"

710
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,736
"what will I be?"

711
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,489
"Will I be pretty?"

712
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:14,324
"Will I be rich?"

713
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:17,536
"Here's what she said to me"

714
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,956
"Que sera sera"

715
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:25,335
"Whatever will be, will be"

716
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:29,172
"The future is not ours to see"

717
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,298
"Que sera"

718
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,968
"sera"

719
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:36,179
"What will be"

720
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,391
"will be"

721
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,201
Reception, please

722
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,582
The guy smoking outside last night...

723
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,375
Yeah?

724
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:52,380
What?

725
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,715
You didn't see anyone?

726
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:55,842
Okey, thanks

727
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,430
Male

728
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:01,431
24 years old

729
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:03,558
crew cut, sports jacket, jeans

730
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:04,768
1.8m tall

731
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,686
wide jaw

732
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,605
Appears mentally challenged

733
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:09,814
Is he retarded?

734
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,107
Yes

735
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:13,610
but he knows his name, Hu Sheng

736
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,779
We'll broadcast it immediately

737
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:17,656
Ok, thanks

738
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,167
Hu Sheng?

739
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:30,293
Good afternoon, Sir

740
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,003
You can invest in stores in the best locations

741
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,129
and make money

742
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,131
as easily as picking it off the ground

743
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,342
Hello, are you still there?

744
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:04,744
Don't think about her too much

745
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:09,916
It's great to have a clean towel

746
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,292
to dry off

747
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,503
in this weather

748
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:17,882
Let's go

749
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,010
What stinks?

750
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:39,904
What're you doing?

751
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,031
Drying my money

752
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,537
Isn't this too bling bling for us?

753
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,085
Yeah, we're showing off

754
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,006
Jiang He

755
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,260
What?

756
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:50,892
Where's my cash!

757
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:51,976
My card!

758
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,281
We definitely suck at showing off

759
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,586
When I was a kid

760
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:20,380
I didn't have any friends

761
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,173
I thought

762
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,425
as long as I shut my door

763
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,719
the storm would never get inside

764
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:29,764
Now

765
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,267
I know I was wrong

766
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:35,937
Kids think about right and wrong

767
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:37,856
Adults care about love and hate

768
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:43,778
I'm going to write about this adventure

769
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,738
I will call it

770
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,615
The Voyager--

771
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:48,658
a journey of a thousand miles

772
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,118
and we will never meet again

773
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:51,202
Great!

774
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,162
Don't forget to make me the hero

775
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:53,830
No

776
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:54,873
Haohan

777
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,791
The ending's not for you

778
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,378
Lot's of things in life go unspoken

779
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,463
In my ending

780
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,382
I will speak to Su Mi

781
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,434
Jiang He

782
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:15,018
Yeah?

783
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:16,519
How far is it to Liu Yingying's place?

784
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,279
Here's the map

785
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:27,572
I'll show you

786
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:28,865
Just tell me how far

787
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,327
How did you get to know her?

788
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:33,703
When I was in primary school

789
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,204
there was a funny program

790
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:36,456
called "Hands to Hands"

791
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:38,333
which linked kids in remote areas

792
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:39,918
with other kids

793
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:41,377
She was my pen pal

794
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,630
What remote area was she from?

795
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:46,633
She wasn't

796
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,093
I was

797
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:51,512
The program aided you?

798
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:52,889
Yeah

799
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,265
But listen

800
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,433
In the end

801
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,310
she totally fell for me

802
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,729
She told me she cared for me in every letter

803
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:02,231
Let me tell you

804
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,233
you need a friend like that

805
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,027
It's even better if it's a girl

806
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,363
because you can be dominant

807
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:10,156
If you want her

808
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,616
she'll always be there

809
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:14,160
Look at me

810
00:49:15,078 --> 00:49:16,955
I do whatever I want

811
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,289
whenever I want

812
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,707
I never take orders from anyone

813
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,250
I never hold back

814
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:22,752
My father was like that

815
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,421
He died at sea

816
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,715
It was a death worthy of his life

817
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:30,635
To be a man

818
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,011
is not like brewing beer

819
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,388
There's no need to wait

820
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:34,097
Brewing is a slow process

821
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,473
Life's too short to wait

822
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,768
But you've waited 19 years

823
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:43,231
18 years

824
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:01,666
Jiang He

825
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,252
Jiang He, Do I look okay?

826
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:06,462
You'd look better if you wash and shave

827
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:08,214
I'm going shopping

828
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:16,597
I need to calm down

829
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:17,640
Don't come back late

830
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:18,975
It's going to be great

831
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,492
No parking there

832
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:40,997
What're you doing?

833
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:41,873
It's fine

834
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,166
It's fine

835
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,174
Liu Yingying

836
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:43,684
Let's play a game

837
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:28,104
We've finally met

838
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,107
I have something to tell you

839
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,235
Listen

840
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:35,444
Don't ask questions

841
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,118
It's pretty late in contrast of the time

842
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:44,912
we ran into each other

843
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,458
It's pretty early in contrast of the time

844
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:53,963
we met each other

845
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,978
Do you remember Typhoon 17

846
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,314
19 years ago?

847
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:14,650
Your father went to sea

848
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:17,320
and never returned

849
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,621
that's what you told me

850
00:53:28,164 --> 00:53:29,707
You said he had a spirit of adventure

851
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,460
You treat him as your idol

852
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,087
who had an admirable death

853
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,177
It was not true

854
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,515
when you were 10 back then

855
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:49,185
or 11?

856
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:52,688
your father thought

857
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,357
in his responsibility to you

858
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,359
he had reached to a limit

859
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,820
He came to stay with us

860
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:03,157
My mum and I

861
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,205
He owed a lot to us

862
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:11,791
Of course

863
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,710
it was a payback to us

864
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,006
But to you

865
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:27,014
it was another story

866
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:32,895
I still can't accept him as my father

867
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:36,482
Actually

868
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:38,734
not all debt

869
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,069
can ever be paid back

870
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:47,118
I left home long ago

871
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:49,078
and opened this billiard room

872
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,038
I've never relied on my family since

873
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,586
Your dad

874
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,755
always wondered how you were

875
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:08,431
That's why

876
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,600
You and I accidentally

877
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:14,228
ran into each other

878
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:15,688
in the school program

879
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,110
We've been pen pals for ten more years

880
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,155
It wasn't me who wanted to hear from you

881
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:27,825
It was your dad

882
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,500
You must wonder how he is

883
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:39,920
and what he's doing

884
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,262
A few years ago

885
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,349
he passed away

886
00:55:58,314 --> 00:55:59,315
Believe me

887
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,152
He's dead now

888
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:15,581
Take it easy

889
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:30,846
How did my dad die?

890
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:34,683
He was drunk

891
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:36,685
and was smoking in bed

892
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,647
It caused a house fire

893
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:41,982
and he burnt to death

894
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:48,114
When did that happen?

895
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:51,909
It was the month I didn't write

896
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,286
That month...

897
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:01,544
After that I started writing to you again

898
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:06,298
I always wrote every letter

899
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:09,885
but now

900
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,096
I'm the only one who reads yours

901
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,397
It's time for me to go

902
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:28,946
I'm embarrassed for those letters

903
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,907
I might have gone too far

904
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:33,451
in expressing my feelings

905
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,161
I lost my mind

906
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,205
I was too explicit

907
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,667
You know

908
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:44,545
I don't mind

909
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:46,630
Love can be liberating

910
00:57:51,427 --> 00:57:53,262
Sometimes love need to be restrained

911
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,397
You know how to contact me

912
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,150
Bye

913
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:25,794
Haohan

914
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:27,463
How'd it go with Liu Yingying?

915
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:28,923
There's nothing there

916
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:33,427
It's more important to drive you to your school

917
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:26,146
Cheer up!

918
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,232
It's not a big deal

919
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:29,942
Open the window

920
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:42,705
Wind through the pine trees sounds like a wave

921
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:57,553
Wind chimes dance as beautifully as heaven

922
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:03,434
Standing alone in the silence of the city

923
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:06,645
I make all the noise

924
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:08,063
Shit

925
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:46,894
Dead?

926
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:49,855
Or unconscious?

927
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:56,070
Did you actually hit him?

928
01:00:56,612 --> 01:00:57,946
I didn't hit him

929
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:18,342
You know so much

930
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,302
What are we supposed to do now?

931
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:23,347
With people, pinch under the nose

932
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,308
With dogs, maybe also pinch under the nose

933
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,148
Right

934
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:45,994
The facial features are too tight

935
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,080
Where am I supposed to pinch?

936
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:01,427
What should we do?

937
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,058
Hey

938
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,353
Haohan

939
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:13,605
Do you think he's domestic or wild?

940
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,483
Wild, because we found him in the wild

941
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:19,403
That doesn't make sense

942
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:21,363
If a man's found in the wild

943
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:22,740
is he a wild man?

944
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,075
A man without a home

945
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,577
is no different

946
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,663
from a wild man

947
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,185
Is this the way?

948
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,561
Sure it is

949
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,235
Haven't we passed by here before

950
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:01,361
No way

951
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:45,572
Stop please

952
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:50,285
What's that noise?

953
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:07,052
Could you give me a ride?

954
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:07,803
Please?

955
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:10,806
Sure

956
01:04:19,648 --> 01:04:20,691
Thanks

957
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:24,152
Don't judge me by my appearance

958
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,113
I won't hurt anyone

959
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:31,410
Sorry

960
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,831
Aren't you hot?

961
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:38,625
Yes

962
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,507
Thanks

963
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:47,926
Close the door

964
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:51,096
What's your name?

965
01:04:52,014 --> 01:04:53,891
I hate my name

966
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,143
My parents were clueless when they named me

967
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,854
Just call me A Lu

968
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:01,023
From your accent,
you're from the south, aren't you?

969
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:02,858
I'm from Canton

970
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:06,695
Are you guys lost?

971
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:08,071
I know the way out

972
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:09,698
I've been here six times

973
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:12,034
Six times?

974
01:05:13,035 --> 01:05:14,119
What do you do?

975
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,955
I travel

976
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:18,707
I travel around the country on a motorcycle

977
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:20,500
I don't read a lot

978
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:22,544
but I've biked

979
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:24,922
140,000 km

980
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,466
140,000 km. isn't a big deal

981
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:28,592
When I was a taxi driver

982
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,552
I drove 140,000 km in a year

983
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,471
but I did it for my freedom

984
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:35,933
You did it for a living

985
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:37,225
What do you do to survive?

986
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:39,353
I live simply

987
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,229
When I travel

988
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:42,522
I take photos

989
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,274
and I write for travel journals

990
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:45,609
So I can make some money

991
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,236
So why were you walking?

992
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:49,571
I'm okay

993
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:50,280
Why were you walking?

994
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,032
Yeah, why were you walking?

995
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,160
You guys have a problem with me working?

996
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,704
I'm a great guy

997
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,081
Why do you think I'm not?

998
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:00,415
By walk

999
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:01,541
Walk

1000
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:02,751
Oh, you mean walking

1001
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,797
Because my motorbike

1002
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:08,090
was stolen

1003
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,929
Normally I don't tell people

1004
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:15,347
about my adventures

1005
01:06:15,806 --> 01:06:17,182
They can't understand me

1006
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,768
They think

1007
01:06:19,935 --> 01:06:21,436
a motorcycle is just used

1008
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,230
to go to work or make deliveries

1009
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,440
So why'd you tell us this?

1010
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:29,486
Don't pretend

1011
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,321
I know

1012
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:34,116
you two are bikers

1013
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:36,284
like me!

1014
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,079
Let's see your passion!

1015
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:40,414
We've lots of things in common

1016
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:46,962
Haohan

1017
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:47,754
turn on the headlights

1018
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,631
No, the tunnel won't be that long

1019
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:53,677
I don't care

1020
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:58,974
Shit. It was freaking long

1021
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,905
How's this possible?

1022
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:15,490
Where are your motorcycles?

1023
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,035
How come three great riders

1024
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,369
don't have one bike?

1025
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:21,580
Don't worry

1026
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,415
Let's ride back after dropping him

1027
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,250
at his new school tomorrow

1028
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:29,838
I want to ride home

1029
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:32,466
back to the Sun of Beach

1030
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,181
You're a teacher, right?

1031
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:41,516
How'd you know?

1032
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:43,935
Your persona tells me

1033
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,021
I've travelled for so long

1034
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:47,272
met so many people

1035
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:49,274
and fallen off several cliffs

1036
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:50,525
I can tell what people do

1037
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,152
just by looking at them

1038
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,656
But him

1039
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:58,075
I can't tell

1040
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,201
Que sera sera

1041
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:00,994
He's a mystery

1042
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:02,204
You've had a hard life

1043
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,830
with so much crap

1044
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,416
I'm not sure about that but

1045
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,126
I'm sure my cock is

1046
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:14,132
HARDER

1047
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:21,598
We have a missing person alert

1048
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:22,557
Male, 24 years old

1049
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:25,018
bald, sports jacket, jeans, 1.8m tall

1050
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:25,936
wide jaw

1051
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:26,937
mentally retarded

1052
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,188
Went missing three days ago

1053
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:31,566
Contact us if you find him

1054
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:52,129
Dr.han

1055
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:53,255
what can you do

1056
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,423
for my husband?

1057
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,092
Hello, lady

1058
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:58,552
Your husband

1059
01:08:58,718 --> 01:08:59,928
needs at least two doses

1060
01:09:00,095 --> 01:09:03,974
of our newest medicine

1061
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,476
When was your first road trip?

1062
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:08,937
It was for a class reunion

1063
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:11,606
I loved motorcycles when I was a kid

1064
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,276
I became good at repairing them

1065
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:16,444
All my classmates

1066
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:17,571
had left my hometown

1067
01:09:17,863 --> 01:09:18,822
and moved to cities

1068
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:20,615
But I stayed

1069
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:21,783
and opened

1070
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,577
a repair shop

1071
01:09:24,286 --> 01:09:25,370
You didn't want to leave your hometown?

1072
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:26,746
No

1073
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:28,331
I couldn't ride a motorbike in the city

1074
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,544
My classmates came back to town

1075
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:33,753
for the reunion

1076
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,797
Some were wealthy and famous

1077
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:37,507
I was still living in the town

1078
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,426
so I wanted to go to the reunion

1079
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:41,720
Besides a girl I had chased

1080
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:44,931
for all seven years of school

1081
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,141
was also going to be there

1082
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:47,809
Primary school is only six years long

1083
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:48,894
You repeated a year?

1084
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,103
No

1085
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:52,772
She failed a year

1086
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:54,316
so I stayed in school also

1087
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:55,525
to keep chasing her

1088
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:58,945
I had thought my repair business

1089
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:00,322
wasn't impressive enough

1090
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:02,199
I fixed up a motorcycle for myself

1091
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,367
and decided to do something

1092
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:06,536
nobody from my town had done

1093
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,496
Travel around China

1094
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:09,831
on a motorbike

1095
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:12,375
I calculated my trip

1096
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,501
so the day my bike trip ended

1097
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:15,045
would be the first day of the reunion

1098
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:17,047
I took photos every place I went to

1099
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,174
and wrote to the girl on each picture

1100
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,259
I thought I would meet her at the reunion

1101
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:22,677
and could keep pursuing her

1102
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:24,596
Then?

1103
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:28,183
I arrived late

1104
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,060
My timing was off

1105
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,394
When I got back to town

1106
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:32,604
it was the last night

1107
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,397
of the reunion

1108
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:36,233
What happened?

1109
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:38,860
I got stuck in a traffic jam in Beijing

1110
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,154
Shit

1111
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,114
Even a motorbike couldn't move

1112
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,324
Stuff happens

1113
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,368
I'm sure your classmates expected you

1114
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:49,037
Hardly. I asked them

1115
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:50,580
No one even mentioned me during

1116
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:51,998
the reunion party

1117
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:54,334
It's okay

1118
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:56,002
You did a road trip across China

1119
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:57,170
Everyone in town

1120
01:10:57,379 --> 01:10:58,421
must have been so proud of you

1121
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:04,177
Nobody seemed to care about it either

1122
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:14,187
Did you put diesel in your tank?

1123
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:25,198
Everyone thinks

1124
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,325
it's better to take a half day to fly

1125
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:28,910
somewhere than ten days to bike

1126
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:30,578
Biking

1127
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:31,788
doesn't mean shit to them

1128
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:38,712
Yeah, that's why

1129
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,464
I didn't ask you about the girl

1130
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:42,924
you had a crush on in primary school

1131
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:48,138
Know what?

1132
01:11:49,264 --> 01:11:50,765
She became my wife

1133
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:52,559
Hah?

1134
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:03,320
What's that?

1135
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:08,241
My helmet with my wife's picture on it

1136
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,082
This is my wife

1137
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:20,628
Your wife supports you

1138
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:28,720
Stop touching his wife

1139
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:30,722
Check the car

1140
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:31,806
Okay

1141
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:35,852
Sometimes

1142
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:37,479
you try to prove yourself to people

1143
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:39,731
you only need

1144
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:42,275
one person who understands you

1145
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:44,778
That's enough

1146
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,654
My wife

1147
01:12:47,155 --> 01:12:48,990
used to love riding with me

1148
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,910
Why isn't she here?

1149
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:06,841
Because

1150
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,259
she wasn't like a cat with nine lives

1151
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:10,220
I ride this route

1152
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,638
this time of the year

1153
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:12,639
to commemorate her

1154
01:13:13,515 --> 01:13:14,641
I might look dirty

1155
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:19,020
but I can't bear

1156
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:20,855
to have dirt on my helmet

1157
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,859
I'll always protect her

1158
01:13:26,194 --> 01:13:27,404
and be with her forever

1159
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:01,271
The car's ready

1160
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:02,272
Let's go

1161
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:38,391
I'm cleaning myself up

1162
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:41,478
so I can watch NT3M5P tomorrow

1163
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,564
What's NT3M5P?

1164
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,942
New Traveler 3 Model 5 Plus

1165
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,819
A satellite made in Finland

1166
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:51,779
It will be launched in India

1167
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,240
to explore outer space

1168
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,201
Bravo

1169
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:57,952
That satellite will

1170
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,662
follow Voyager 1

1171
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,082
I believe

1172
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:05,126
my fate's

1173
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:06,669
like that satellite

1174
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:09,881
A rocket will send me to outer space

1175
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:12,217
to follow Voyager 1

1176
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:14,844
You're the second person

1177
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:16,763
who understand this magic code

1178
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,518
My wife

1179
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:22,894
was the first

1180
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,154
I shouldn't have let her ride with me

1181
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:35,573
It was raining hard

1182
01:15:47,544 --> 01:15:48,419
It's the past now

1183
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:51,422
I don't blame you

1184
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:52,882
for damaging the helmet

1185
01:15:55,677 --> 01:15:56,636
So...

1186
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,012
Where are we now?

1187
01:15:58,346 --> 01:15:59,180
Near the border

1188
01:15:59,347 --> 01:16:00,431
The border?

1189
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:02,308
I have to get to my new school by tomorrow

1190
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,186
My wife

1191
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:08,523
would have loved to watch

1192
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,192
the emissions of NT3M5P

1193
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:12,944
I have to be at my new school tomorrow

1194
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:17,073
Alright

1195
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:19,367
Forget it

1196
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,040
We're all in the same boat

1197
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,543
You still miss your wife

1198
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:32,255
and our last few days have been hell

1199
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:35,592
but I'll be fine

1200
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:36,801
Life goes on

1201
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,053
Men shouldn't be held back

1202
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:41,806
by love issues

1203
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,559
The most important thing

1204
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:45,768
is our careers

1205
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,064
What's your career?

1206
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,326
I was a fisherman for four years

1207
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,745
a taxi driver for three

1208
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,080
a delivery man for two

1209
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,666
and a kindergarden guard for one

1210
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:11,085
I've built up my social network

1211
01:17:11,753 --> 01:17:13,546
to start a business at home on my island

1212
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,382
But I no longer have a hometown

1213
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:20,595
What about you?

1214
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:22,764
He's devoted

1215
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,265
himself to education

1216
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:26,351
for the last ten years

1217
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:27,894
Reading can be travelling

1218
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:29,312
But for him, reading is reading

1219
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:32,231
Dude

1220
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:34,484
You need to come out and see the world

1221
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:38,154
My world view is different from yours

1222
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:39,697
How can you have a view of the world

1223
01:17:39,906 --> 01:17:40,782
when you've never seen it?

1224
01:17:42,617 --> 01:17:43,534
Do you know what day it is?

1225
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:45,870
Your wedding anniversary?

1226
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:51,167
You're full of romantic crap

1227
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,211
Today

1228
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,088
the Voyager 1 will

1229
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,215
leave the solar system

1230
01:17:57,382 --> 01:17:59,801
and enter outer space

1231
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:09,352
After 36 years

1232
01:18:09,936 --> 01:18:11,437
36 years

1233
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,648
the unmanned spaceship, Voyager 1

1234
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:16,192
launched in 1977

1235
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:19,445
finally goes into interstellar space

1236
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,993
Epic loneliness in the universe

1237
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:28,287
aimed for the sole reason

1238
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:31,207
to uncover outer space

1239
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:34,335
Some people

1240
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,838
hide in corners for their whole lives

1241
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:39,507
too lazy to open a window

1242
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:41,467
or walk out a door

1243
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:44,387
Those people

1244
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:45,430
idolize pop stars

1245
01:18:48,099 --> 01:18:49,517
But I idolize

1246
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:51,394
this spaceship

1247
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,146
My name

1248
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:55,064
is

1249
01:18:57,859 --> 01:18:58,693
Voyager 2

1250
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:04,198
Hi

1251
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:06,367
I've sorted myself out

1252
01:19:06,868 --> 01:19:08,703
I gave my four cats to my friends

1253
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:10,246
and got a dog instead

1254
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:12,498
That's one small step for you;

1255
01:19:12,749 --> 01:19:14,250
one giant leap for your life

1256
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,919
Can I take one more step?

1257
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:18,296
Of course

1258
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,257
We're on the rooftop now

1259
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:37,440
Let me drive a while

1260
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:38,649
You two can take a break

1261
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,652
Go for it

1262
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:59,086
He's a great guy

1263
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:00,922
I agree

1264
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:06,636
Accelerate!

1265
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,277
Nice try

1266
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:30,952
Hasn't he

1267
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:33,287
gone a bit far?

1268
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:36,582
Adventurers like him

1269
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,459
normally push limits

1270
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:41,546
The further the better

1271
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:42,880
In the old saying

1272
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:44,131
distance tests a horse's stamina

1273
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:45,466
a long task proves a man's character

1274
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:48,970
Do you think he's driving away?

1275
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:51,013
No

1276
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,646
See!

1277
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:00,857
Don't blindly trust others

1278
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:02,567
until you know them well

1279
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:56,996
distance doesn't always test a horse's stamina

1280
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:59,457
long tasks don't always prove a man's character

1281
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:05,922
Asshole!

1282
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,598
He might have problems

1283
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:16,891
Like what?

1284
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:18,351
Who cares about our problems?

1285
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:20,061
Do you know how far we have to go?

1286
01:22:21,938 --> 01:22:23,064
I don't mind being cheated

1287
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:25,232
but I do mind being conned

1288
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:26,359
by someone I trusted

1289
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:29,570
Even though I might be late for work

1290
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:31,113
I'm not angry

1291
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,740
You know why?

1292
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:36,369
Because that's my car

1293
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:42,333
He told us what he thought

1294
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:45,670
People should go and see the world

1295
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,296
You mean screw up the world?

1296
01:22:48,339 --> 01:22:49,924
It's okay if you're not successful

1297
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:51,842
If I succeed in life

1298
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:53,469
it'll be without hurting others

1299
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:54,136
But...

1300
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:55,179
No more buts

1301
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:56,597
We've totally different values

1302
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:57,348
But...

1303
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:58,432
Shut up

1304
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,504
Finally a photo of us, but no faces

1305
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,679
I'm thirsty

1306
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:44,645
Go and swallow the sweet talk that thief fed you

1307
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:47,314
Don't jump to conclusions yet

1308
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:48,649
It's easy to conclude that

1309
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:51,694
I went out of my way for you

1310
01:23:52,403 --> 01:23:53,529
You flirted with Su Mi

1311
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:55,072
so we lost Hu Sheng

1312
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:56,657
You were duped by that guy

1313
01:23:56,866 --> 01:23:57,992
so we lost my car

1314
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,535
Now you're still on his side

1315
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:00,786
As a teacher I believe

1316
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,663
even bad students are worthwhile

1317
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:04,040
Nothing's absolute

1318
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:05,791
I don't hang out with low life

1319
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:07,668
You're the exception

1320
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,047
If everyone thinks like you

1321
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:12,506
you won't have friends either

1322
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:15,176
What do you mean?

1323
01:24:17,178 --> 01:24:18,345
Sorry

1324
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:19,972
I didn't mean it

1325
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,515
I feel sorry for his dead wife

1326
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:23,434
knowing what he's done

1327
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:24,852
How do you know he even had a wife?

1328
01:24:25,019 --> 01:24:26,020
How do you know he gives a shit

1329
01:24:26,187 --> 01:24:26,812
about the NT... 3P?

1330
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:28,064
It's all lies

1331
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,774
Some of it must be true

1332
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:30,649
Even an asshole

1333
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,526
can be partially trusted

1334
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:35,279
You're right

1335
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:37,406
I believe

1336
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,867
Su Mi is a whore

1337
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:47,374
Say it again

1338
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,460
She's a damn whore

1339
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:52,004
How dare you!

1340
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,883
How dare you!

1341
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:43,342
See

1342
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,302
Life is an open door

1343
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:49,473
I don't believe you

1344
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,934
Why're so many people's lives trapped?

1345
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:54,061
I thought you were an optimist

1346
01:27:58,857 --> 01:27:59,692
I am

1347
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:04,571
But now I know

1348
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:07,324
being optimistic can mean

1349
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:09,076
treating life

1350
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:11,120
like a joke

1351
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,124
Go to sleep

1352
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:45,112
What are you up to?

1353
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:47,865
Haohan

1354
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:50,617
Don't let your past

1355
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,119
depress you

1356
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:53,912
Let me show you an experiment

1357
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:55,164
Okay

1358
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:56,665
Even if it fails

1359
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,375
we'll have breakfast

1360
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:06,216
Give it company

1361
01:29:12,473 --> 01:29:14,641
The water's bubbling

1362
01:29:15,184 --> 01:29:16,894
and they're still not reacting

1363
01:29:18,187 --> 01:29:20,272
You understand this

1364
01:29:23,317 --> 01:29:24,485
Look

1365
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:27,154
They start to feel the change

1366
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,913
Creatures always react to environmental stress

1367
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:38,999
Everything will pass by

1368
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,670
The frogs won't be trapped

1369
01:29:44,088 --> 01:29:45,297
They'll jump out

1370
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:47,174
That's reality

1371
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,555
This is reality

1372
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,343
Even my car's gone

1373
01:30:34,972 --> 01:30:36,723
I can't help you anymore

1374
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,561
I need to think about

1375
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:43,397
my own career

1376
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:52,197
The border shouldn't be far

1377
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:56,535
My new school

1378
01:30:56,743 --> 01:30:58,912
will be across that slope

1379
01:31:00,414 --> 01:31:02,416
We've driven across the country

1380
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:11,925
What does it mean?

1381
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:39,495
A trip is just a trip

1382
01:31:40,496 --> 01:31:42,122
Nothing more

1383
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:46,460
You've told me before

1384
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:48,879
that you like dalmatians

1385
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:51,381
So that dog is yours

1386
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:52,925
That's not a dalmatian

1387
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:54,718
It's an Alaskan malamute

1388
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:58,180
Whatever

1389
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,516
Call it what you like

1390
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,809
Maybe a Madagascar bulldog

1391
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:04,770
with big spots

1392
01:32:08,023 --> 01:32:09,316
You should take him

1393
01:32:14,488 --> 01:32:16,448
People like you

1394
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:19,368
don't fit into society

1395
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,623
I'm not like you

1396
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,918
I'm the kind of guy

1397
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:31,088
who has friends everywhere

1398
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:36,510
You should take him

1399
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:39,513
Keep him so you have company in your old age

1400
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,932
Dogs only live about 14 years

1401
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:51,024
Many partnerships are even shorter

1402
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:04,371
Let him make his own choice

1403
01:34:25,285 --> 01:34:25,952
Friends

1404
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:27,621
This statue of Chai Bo Gong

1405
01:34:27,788 --> 01:34:30,791
is the landmark of Dongji Island

1406
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:32,834
It was also in a scene in The Voyager

1407
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:36,296
written by the famous author Jiang He

1408
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:38,548
The Voyager

1409
01:34:38,715 --> 01:34:40,133
has been adapted as

1410
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,052
an 80 episode TV series

1411
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:43,970
starring

1412
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:46,056
Haoran and Ali

1413
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:49,601
It's the most popular

1414
01:34:49,935 --> 01:34:51,645
TV show today

1415
01:34:51,812 --> 01:34:53,980
It's audience rating in Korea

1416
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:55,816
is even higher than The Heirs

1417
01:34:55,982 --> 01:34:58,276
It's broken the record for an exported TV series

1418
01:34:58,485 --> 01:34:59,486
Although the author

1419
01:34:59,653 --> 01:35:02,364
isn't satisfied with the producer's adaptation

1420
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:05,742
The Voyager has an immense following of fans

1421
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:08,620
Watch your step

1422
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:10,747
You have 15 minutes free time

1423
01:35:10,914 --> 01:35:13,667
Souvenirs are over there

1424
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:27,681
Don't be mad at me

1425
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:44,424
Haohan

1426
01:36:44,591 --> 01:36:46,092
How'd it go with Liu Yingying?

1427
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:48,386
There's nothing there

1428
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,597
It's more important to drive you to your school

1429
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:53,475
Have you started thinking about your book?

1430
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:55,977
I have an ending for you

1431
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,188
It will be something like

1432
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:01,608
Unexpectedly we said goodbye at that time

1433
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:04,903
When you say goodbye

1434
01:37:05,946 --> 01:37:07,614
say it with a full heart

1435
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:09,991
as one more word

1436
01:37:10,784 --> 01:37:12,661
may become the last word

1437
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:14,788
and one more glance

1438
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:17,707
may become the last glance

1439
01:37:19,501 --> 01:37:20,752
What do you think?

1440
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:22,420
It's a great ending, isn't it?
