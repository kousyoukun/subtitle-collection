1
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,470
混沌初开时
In the beginning.

2
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,890
世界只是一片汪洋
There was only ocean.

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,840
然后海岛之母特菲提来到了
Until the "Mother Island" emerged.

4
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,510
人间
Te Fiti.

5
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,270
特菲提之心有着世间最伟大的法力
Her heart held the greatest power ever known.

6
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,170
它能够创造生命
It could create life itself!

7
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,440
于是特菲提创造了人间的一切
And Te Fiti share it with the world.

8
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,500
可是后来，有人想要得到特菲提之心
But in time, some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

9
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,020
他们相信只要得到了它
They believed if they could possess it.

10
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,290
也就有了创造万物的法力
The great power of creation would be theirs.

11
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,660
有一天
And one day...

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,440
这些人中最勇敢的一位
The most daring of them all...

13
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,640
飘洋过海去寻找这颗心
Voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.

14
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,040
他是个主宰风和海的半神
He was the demigod of the wind and sea.

15
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,990
他是个勇士
He was a warrior ...

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,750
也是个变形者
A trickster!

17
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,920
他那充满魔力的鱼钩法杖
A shape shifter who could change form.

18
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,990
能让他变化无穷
With the power of his magical fish hook.

19
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:06,140
他的名字叫毛伊
And his name was Maui!

20
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,710
她的心被偷走了以后
But without her heart.

21
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,980
特菲提开始瓦解
Te Fiti began to crumble.

22
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,430
并释放出了可怕的黑暗势力
Giving birth to a terrible darkness.

23
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,690
在逃跑的路上
Maui tried to escape.

24
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,230
毛伊遇到了火恶魔恶卡
But was confronted by another, who sought the heart.

25
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,310
恶卡也在谋求特菲提之心
Te Ka! A demon of Earth and Fire.

26
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,030
毛伊被从天空击落
Maui was struck from the sky!

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,200
从此了无踪迹
Never to be seen again.

28
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,320
他那神奇的鱼钩法杖
And his magical fish hook ...

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,990
和特菲提之心一起沉入了大海
And the heart of Te Fiti, were lost to the sea.

30
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,360
即使在一千年后的今天
Where even now, a thousand years later.

31
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,310
恶卡和海里的恶魔依然妄图找到那颗心
Te Ka and the demons of the deep still hunt for the heart.

32
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,710
那些隐藏的黑暗势力仍在四处流窜
Hiding in a darkness that will continue to spread...

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,080
赶走了我们的鱼群
Chasing away our fish!

34
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,690
霸占了一座又一座的海岛
Draining the life from island after island!

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,860
迟早有一天
Until every one of us.

36
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,080
我们大家都难逃他们的魔爪
Is devoured by the blood-thirsty jaws.

37
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,020
注定要被他们吃掉
Of inescapable death!

38
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,610
但在那之前
But one day...

39
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,760
会有人把那颗心找回来
The heart will be found.

40
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,150
他将扬帆起航
By someone who would journey beyond our reef.

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,600
找到毛伊
Find Maui.

42
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,830
带他跨越整个大海
Deliver him across the great ocean...

43
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,210
归还特菲提之心
To restore Te Fiti's heart.

44
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,050
拯救全人类
And save us all.

45
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,650
好了好了，谢谢你妈妈
Thank you mother, that's enough.

46
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,570
爸爸
Papa...

47
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,760
放心，谁都不可能离开这的
No one goes outside the reef.

48
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,220
这里非常安全
We are safe here!

49
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,850
这没有黑暗势力，这没什么怪兽
There is no darkness. There are no monsters.

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,860
- 怪兽！怪兽！  - 没有怪兽，没有怪兽
- Monster! Monster! Monster!  - There's no monster... no monsters!

51
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,430
是黑暗势力
It's the darkness!

52
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,440
什么也没有，岛外面只有暴风雨
No, there is nothing beyond our reef but storms!

53
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,500
- 和汹涌的大海  - 我要吐了
- And rough seas!  - I gotta throw up!

54
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,490
只要我们大家都待在岛上
As long as we stay on our very safe island.

55
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
就会没事的
We'll be fine!

56
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,050
传说的都是真的
The legends are true.

57
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,900
总得有人去冒险
Someone will have to go!

58
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,600
妈妈
Mother...

59
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,750
莫图鲁尼就是天堂
Motunui is paradise!

60
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,790
谁会愿意离开这？
Who would want to go anywhere else?

61
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,620
莫阿娜
Moana!

62
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,130
你在这干什么，莫阿娜，真把我吓坏了
There you are Moana, what are you doing? You scared me!

63
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,580
我真想回去那
But I want us to go back.

64
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,640
我知道，知道
I know, I know...

65
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,580
以后不要再到海边去了
But you don't go out there.

66
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,350
那里很危险
It's dangerous.

67
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,890
莫阿娜，来啊
Moana, come on...

68
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,010
回村子去
Let's go back to the village.

69
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,800
你早晚也会成为一位伟大的酋长
You are the next great chief of our people.

70
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,830
你还会做很多伟大的事，我的小宝贝
And you do wonderous things, my little Minnow.

71
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,260
没错，不过
Oh yes, but first...

72
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,280
你首先要知道自己是属于哪的
You must learn where you're meant to be.

73
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,610
她来了
Moana...

74
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,800
大家，让开
Make way... Make way.

75
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,850
莫阿娜，你明白吗
Moana, it's time you knew.

76
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,920
这地方什么都有物资充裕
The village of Motunui is all you need.

77
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,020
我们舞伴在练习
The dancers are practicing

78
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,230
随着古老的舞曲
They dance to an ancient song.

79
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,610
古老的旋律比新的歌动听
Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need

80
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,670
保护传统是我的使命
This tradition is our mission.

81
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,100
这担子责任不轻
And Moana there's so much to do.

82
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,210
不要被树根绊倒，路上小心
Don't trip on the taro root. That's all you need.

83
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,170
分享所有的东西
We share everything we make.

84
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,460
有说有笑做个工具
We joke and we weave our baskets.

85
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,010
捕鱼的船渐渐靠近
The fishermen come back from the sea.

86
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,280
- 它在那里  - 不要走失
- I wanna see.  - Don't walk away.

87
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,680
莫阿娜你不要忘记
Moana stay on the ground now.

88
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,660
我们未来伟大领袖就是你
Our people will need a chief and there you are...

89
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,360
到那一天
There comes a day.

90
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,680
没人陪伴在你身边
When you're gonna look around.

91
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,900
你就会明白最快乐的是你家
And realize happiness is where you are.

92
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,600
你看看这些椰子
Consider the coconut!

93
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,070
这一片树林
Consider it's tree...

94
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,560
椰子的每一个部分
We use each part of the coconut.

95
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,770
都有价值
That's all we need.

96
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,200
椰子壳可以做鱼网
We make our nets from the fibers.

97
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,090
椰汁可口又清凉
The water is sweet inside.

98
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,150
椰子树干能把火生
We use the leaves to build fires.

99
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,950
叶子能够做好菜
We cook up the meat inside.

100
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,940
你看看这些椰子
Consider the coconuts!

101
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,360
树干和叶子多的是
The trunks and the leaves!

102
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,820
这小岛给我们所需
The island gives us what we need.

103
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,940
- 不要离去  - 就在这里
- And no one leaves.  - That's right we stay.

104
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,390
安全又有丰厚物资
We're safe and we're well provided.

105
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,340
带领我们美好未来
And when we look to the future...

106
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,500
全靠你
There you are.

107
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,210
直到一天
You'll be okay.

108
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,550
你会了解人生意义
In time you'll learn just as I did.

109
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,830
人生的快乐在你的家
You must find happiness right where you are!

110
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,890
我爱随着海浪舞蹈
I like to dance with the water.

111
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,950
高高低低的浪花
The undertow and the waves.

112
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,880
那海水非常顽皮
The water is mischievous, ha!

113
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,910
它脾气没法估计
I like how it misbehaves.

114
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,370
他们都说我太疯狂
The village may think I'm crazy.

115
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,180
也说我不守故址
Or say that I drift too far.

116
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,370
但我很了解自己，我有追寻
But once you know what you like. Well, there you are.

117
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,820
有其父必有其女
You are your father's daughter.

118
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,000
我自己注意
Stubbornness and pride.

119
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,270
他的教导虽有道理
Mind what he says, but remember.

120
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,340
你要听从你的心
You may hear a voice inside..

121
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,340
爸爸
Dad!

122
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,390
我只是在看看那些船
I was only looking at the boats.

123
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,140
我没打算要上去
I wasn't gonna get on them.

124
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,740
来吧
Come on.

125
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,840
跟我一起去个地方
There's something I need to show you.

126
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,860
从你出生时起，我就一直想带你来这的
I've wanted to bring you here from the moment you opened your eyes.

127
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,470
这里是个神圣的地方
This is a sacred place.

128
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,390
每代酋长都来过
A place of Chiefs.

129
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,380
总有一天
There will come a time

130
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,360
你也会站在这里，给这座山
When you will stand on this peak and place...

131
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,580
添上一块石头的
A stone on this mountain.

132
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,920
像我一样
Like I did.

133
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,490
我的父亲
Like my father did.

134
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,200
他的父亲，每一代酋长都这样做
And his father and every chief that has ever been.

135
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,560
你要知道
And on that day...

136
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,970
当你把石头放上去的时候
When you're at your stone.

137
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,560
这整座岛又会变得高一点
You will raise this whole island higher.

138
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,550
你是我们族人的未来，莫阿娜
You are the future of our people, Moana.

139
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,850
他们不在别的地方
And they are not out there.

140
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,800
就在我们这里
There are right here.

141
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,490
是该你为他们做事的时候了
It's time to be who they need you to be.

142
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,710
- 椰子可以做捕鱼网  - 可以做捕鱼网
- We make our nets from the fibers.  - We weave our nets from the fibers

143
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,650
- 椰汁又清凉  - 里面有甜蜜椰汁
- The water is sweet inside.  - The real taste of tree's inside.

144
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,650
- 我们用叶子把火生  - 我们一起来把歌唱
- We use the leaves to build fires.  - We sing these songs in our choirs.

145
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,710
- 能够做好菜  - 一天忙碌生活
- And cook up the meat inside.  - We have mouths to feed inside.

146
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,020
- 村民都相信我们  - 对啊
- The village believe in us.  - That's right!

147
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,020
村民都相信
The village believe!

148
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,310
这小岛给我们所需
The island gives us what we need.

149
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,730
不用离去  就在这里
And no one leaves!  So here I'll stay.

150
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,950
与我们的家人在一起
My home, my people beside me.

151
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,010
我的未来就在这里
And when I think of tomorrow.

152
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,250
我的家
There we are.

153
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,810
我的带领
I lead the way.

154
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,160
也需要你们的指引
I'll have my people to guide me.

155
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,300
一起把未来去建立
We'll build our future together.

156
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,280
我的家
Where we are.

157
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,220
每一条路的终点都是
'Cause every path leads you back to.

158
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,460
我的家
Where you are.

159
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:45,040
- 在这里最快乐的是  - 我的家
- You can find happiness right...  - Where you are

160
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,630
我的家
Where you are....

161
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,690
尽管我加盖了很多树叶，可每次下雨还是会漏水
Every storm, this roof leaks no matter how many fronds I add.

162
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,440
修好了
Fixed!

163
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,920
不是叶子的问题
Knot the fronds!

164
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,010
是风把柱子吹偏了
Wind shifted the post.

165
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,600
这猪肉真不错
That's good pork!

166
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,710
不是说你
Oh, I mean...

167
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,590
我的意思是
No, I wasn't ...

168
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,490
什么？他们在叫我，我得走了
What? They're calling me! So I gotta...

169
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,550
拜拜
Bye!

170
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,980
你真棒
You're doing great.

171
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,280
还没结束吗？
Is it done yet?

172
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,710
就快结束了
So close.

173
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,330
我很好奇为什么那只鸡
I'm curious about that chicken.

174
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,640
喜欢吃石头
Eating the rock!

175
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,960
它看起来好像已经完全
I think he seems to lack the basic intelligence required for

176
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,760
丧失理智了
Pretty much everything.

177
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,440
也许我们应该
Should we maybe just...

178
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,750
拿它做盘菜？
Cook him?

179
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,760
有时候我们需要透过现象看本质
Sometimes our strengths lie beneath the surface

180
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,760
不过不一定
Far beneath

181
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,290
能看得到
In some cases.

182
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
但我相信它肯定不会像看上去那么傻
But I'm sure there's more to Hei-hei than meets the eye!

183
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,980
这是今天摘的
It's the harvest.

184
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,070
早上我在剥椰子的时候
This morning I was husking the coconuts and ...

185
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,190
我们应该砍掉这些病树
We should clear the diseased trees.

186
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,750
然后重新种一片椰子林
And we will start a new grove

187
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,320
就在那儿
There!

188
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,910
谢谢，莫阿娜
Thanks, Moana.

189
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,780
她可真棒
She's doing great!

190
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,640
这很适合你
This suits you.

191
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,500
酋长
Chief!

192
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,400
我相信你应该看看这个
There's something you need to see.

193
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,960
这是我们在东礁湖设的捕鱼篓
Our traps in the east lagoon.

194
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,940
最近能捕到的鱼越来越少了
They're pulling out less and less fish.

195
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,080
那就换个地方试试
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

196
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,150
试过了，还是没有鱼
We have. There's no fish.

197
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,830
那就去岛的那一边试试
Then we'll fish the far side of the island.

198
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,650
也试过了
We tried.

199
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,410
迎风的那边？
The windward side?

200
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,610
还有背风的那边
And the leeward side.

201
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,920
浅礁，沟渠
The shallows, the channel.

202
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,790
整个礁湖我们都试过了
We've tried the whole lagoon!

203
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,070
就是找不到鱼
They're just... gone.

204
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,590
好吧，你们有没有试过换换鱼饵呢？
Well, have you tried using a different bait?

205
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,220
我觉得不是鱼饵的问题
I don't think it's the bait.

206
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,520
情况好像越来越糟了
It seems like it's getting worse and worse.

207
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,920
当然，我能理解你在担心什么
Of course I understand you have reason to concern.

208
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,570
我会和长老们商量的
I will talk to the counselor.

209
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,950
- 我们一定会...  - 我们...
- I'm sure we ca...  - What if...

210
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,560
为什么不能出海捕鱼
We fished beyond the reef.

211
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,340
从来没有人出过海
No one goes beyond the reef.

212
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,140
我知道，但如果礁湖里真的没有鱼了
I know! But if there are no fish in the lagoon...

213
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,900
- 莫阿娜  - 还有那么大一片海呢
- Moana!  - And there's a whole ocean...

214
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,520
我们要遵守规则
We have one rule!

215
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,210
可那是有鱼的时候制定的规则
An old rule when there were fish!

216
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,930
它能确保我们的安全
A rule that keeps us safe!

217
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,970
- 可是，爸爸  - 而不是像你说的那样
- But dad...  - Instead of endangering our people

218
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,830
让大家以身犯险
So you can run right back to the water!

219
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,840
我还以为你放弃了离岛的念头
Every time, I think you're past this.

220
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,250
所有人都不许离开这座岛
No one goes beyond the reef!

221
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,570
你不该当着你爸爸的面
Well, it's not like you said it in front of your dad

222
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,120
提出海的事情
Standing on a boat.

223
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,320
我说的是出海捕鱼
I didn't say go beyond the reef.

224
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,440
又不是要去冒险
Because I want to be on the ocean.

225
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,020
但你还是想去
But you still do.

226
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,340
- 你爸爸生你的气是因为  - 是因为他不懂我
- He's hard on you, because...  - Because he doesn't get me.

227
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,830
是因为他也曾跟你一样
Because he was you.

228
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,480
对大海着迷
Drawn to the ocean.

229
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,200
想去海上
Down by the shore.

230
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,710
莫阿娜，他曾经驾着独木舟
He took a canoe, Moana.

231
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,890
绕过那片礁石
He crossed the reef.

232
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,990
驶入了一片危险的海域
And found an unforgiving sea.

233
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,520
哪里的浪像山一样高
Waves like mountains.

234
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,960
他最好的朋友非要跟他一起出海
His best friend begged to be on that boat.

235
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,360
但你爸爸没能救回他
Your dad couldn't save him.

236
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,630
现在他不想让你重蹈覆辙
He's hoping he can save you.

237
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,030
有时候我们总想着
Sometimes, who we wish we were

238
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,390
要做些大事
What we wish we could do

239
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,270
却忘了该做些什么
It's just not meant to be.

240
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,610
我每天总喜欢眺望这海洋
I've been staring at the edge of the water.

241
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,510
没有尽头的彼方
Long as I can remember.

242
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,610
却不明白为什么
Never really knowing why.

243
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,410
也许你希望我听你的话
I wish I could be the perfect daughter.

244
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,640
我也曾经努力的尝试
But I come back to the water.

245
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,190
我还是回到这海洋
No matter how hard I try.

246
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,960
每一个转弯，每一个路段
Every turn I take, every trail I track.

247
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,960
每一次选择，每一次失望
Every path I make, every road leads back.

248
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,560
不怕多困难，那熟悉的地方
To the place I know where I cannot go.

249
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,960
是我的渴望
Where I long to be.

250
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,210
我听到地平线的那一边
See the line where the sky meets the sea?

251
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,690
呼唤我
It calls me.

252
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,540
谁会知道
And no one knows.

253
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,710
能走多远
How far it goes.

254
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,010
乘着风，迎着浪，扬着帆
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me.

255
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,360
终会知道
One day I'll know.

256
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,160
我要走的路不管有多远也好
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go.

257
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,790
虽然在这海岛每一个人仿佛开心没有忧愁
I know everybody on this island seems so happy, on this island

258
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,190
所有事都被安排
Everything is by design

259
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:24,910
虽然海岛上的每一个人都有他们的责任
I know everybody on this island has a role, on this island.

260
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,840
也许我有自己主张
So maybe I can roll with mine.

261
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,640
我可以带领，让你们坚强
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong.

262
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,490
也可以妥协，不再有期望
I'll be satisfied if I play along.

263
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,210
我心中想起另一个声音
But the voice inside sings a different song.

264
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,740
我不能自己
What is wrong with me?

265
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,310
那海岸在闪烁很耀眼
See the light as it shines on the sea?

266
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,990
的光芒
It's blinding.

267
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,810
谁会知道
But no one knows.

268
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,940
海有多深
How deep it goes.

269
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,490
仿佛它在等待我的回应
And it seems like it's calling out to me.

270
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,790
我在这里
So come find me.

271
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,340
请告诉我
And let me know.

272
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,860
我应该期待什么是未来
What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

273
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,510
在那地平线的另一边
See the line where the sky meets the sea?

274
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,910
呼唤我
It calls me.

275
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,690
谁会知道
And no one knows.

276
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,890
能走多远
How far it goes.

277
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,860
乘着风，迎着浪，扬着帆勇敢前行
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me.

278
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,910
中会知道
One day I'll know.

279
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,660
能走多远
How far I'll go.

280
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,760
别担心，胖胖
Okay, Pua.

281
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,360
相信我
I can do this.

282
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,440
出海肯定能补到更多的鱼
There's more fish beyond the reef.

283
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,880
我相信肯定能的
There's more beyond the reef.

284
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,630
没那么糟嘛
Not so bad!

285
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,920
胖胖
Pua!

286
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,370
不管发生了什么事
Whatever just happened.

287
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,320
就说是胖胖干的
Blame it on the pig!

288
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,400
奶奶
Grandma!

289
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,500
你会告诉爸爸吗？
Are you gonna tell dad.

290
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,710
我是他妈
I'm his mom.

291
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,130
不用事事都跟他汇报
I don't have to tell him anything.

292
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:21,640
他说得对
He was right.

293
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,230
海上很危险
About going out there.

294
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,820
我也应该接任酋长了
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.

295
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,140
好呀
Okay!

296
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,240
那就回村子去
Well, then head on back

297
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,950
把你的石头放上去
Put that stone up there.

298
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,900
你为什么不劝阻我呢
Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it?

299
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,750
你说了那是你想做的事
You said that's what you wanted.

300
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,180
没错呀
It is.

301
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,570
等我死了
When I die.

302
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,590
我想要变成一条黄貂鱼
I'm going to come back as one of these.

303
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,830
不然我背上的刺青就白刺了
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

304
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,040
你今天怎么怪怪的？
Why you're acting weird?

305
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,310
我是村里的怪奶奶啊
I'm the village crazy, lady.

306
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,790
这才是我嘛
That's my job.

307
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,110
如果你有什么话想跟我说
If there's something you want to tell me.

308
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,210
就直说吧
Just tell me.

309
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,000
您有什么话想跟我说吗？
Is there something you want to tell me?

310
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,440
你想听我说什么啊？
Is there something you want to hear?

311
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,590
我们族人的故事你都已经听过了
You've been told all our people stories.

312
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,350
可这个除外
But one.

313
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,300
这是哪儿啊？
What is this place?

314
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,980
你真以为我们的祖辈从来没有出过海吗？
Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef?

315
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,840
里面有什么呢？
What's in there?

316
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,430
有你
The answer.

317
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,760
一直在苦苦寻找的答案
To the question you keep asking yourself.

318
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,750
你想要做什么样的人
Who are you meant to be.

319
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,400
走进去
Go inside.

320
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,400
敲敲鼓
Bang the drum.

321
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,790
你就能找到答案
And find out.

322
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,110
对了，敲敲
Bang the drum.

323
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,130
看太阳高高在上
We read the wind and sky.

324
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,700
风吹散云彩
When the sun is high.

325
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,520
我们在大海航行，迎着风前进
We sail the length of the seas on the ocean breeze.

326
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,030
在夜里数每颗星能找到方向
At night we name every star. We know where we are.

327
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,310
知道我是谁
We know who we are.

328
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,560
我是谁
Who we are.

329
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,160
定好了目的地
We set a course to find.

330
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,270
每一次出行找寻新天地
A brand new island everywhere we roam.

331
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,100
家乡的模样放心里
We keep our island in our mind.

332
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,560
时间到了就回家
And when it's time to find home.

333
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,270
千山万水
We know the way.

334
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,680
我们去探索每一个符号
We are explorers reading every sign.

335
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,820
这里有我们的祖先
We tell the stories of our elders.

336
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,220
古老的故事与传承
In a never ending chain.

337
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,680

Te fenua, te malie.

338
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:51,130
千山万水
Nae ko hakilia. We know the way!

339
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,350
我们是航海者
We were voyagers.

340
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:04,280
我们是航海者
We were voyagers!

341
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,250
后来发生了什么？
Why'd we stop?

342
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,880
是毛伊
Maui!

343
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,990
在他偷走了特菲提之心后
When he stole from the Mother Island.

344
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,550
黑暗降临到了人间
Darkness fell.

345
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,470
恶卡苏醒了
Te Ka awoke.

346
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,070
海底的怪兽吞噬了渔船
Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back.

347
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,740
为了族人的安全，历代酋长都下令
To protect our people, the ancient chiefs

348
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,900
禁止航海
Forbid voyaging.

349
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,330
于是人们渐渐忘记了自己是航海者的后代
And now we have forgotten who we are.

350
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,710
然而黑暗势力仍在不断扩张
And the darkness has continued to spread.

351
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,430
他们赶走了我们的鱼群
Chasing away our fish.

352
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,270
霸占了
Draining the life

353
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,030
一座又一座海岛
From island after island.

354
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,840
我们的岛
Our island

355
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,590
但是，终有一天
But one day

356
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,680
有人会重新扬帆起航
Someone will journey beyond our reef.

357
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:50,990
找到毛伊
Find Maui.

358
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,100
并带他跨越整片大海
Deliver him across the great ocean.

359
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,860
归还特菲提之心
To restore the heart of Te Fiti.

360
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,980
那天我都看到了你
I was there that day.

361
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,890
大海选择了你
The ocean chose you!

362
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,320
我还以为那只是个梦
I thought it was a dream.

363
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,310
不是梦
Nope!

364
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,550
我们的祖先相信毛伊就在那里
Our ancestors believed, Maui lies there.

365
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,150
在钩形星座的尽头
At the bottom of his hook.

366
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,770
朝着它的方向走，你就能找到毛伊
Follow it, and you will find him.

367
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:35,550
但是
But...

368
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,880
大海为什么会选中我呢？
Why would it choose me?

369
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,550
我连怎么驾船出海都不会
I don't even know how to make it pass the reef.

370
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,950
但我知道谁能教我
But I know who does.

371
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,230
庄稼都变黑了
The crops are turning black!

372
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,280
那鱼呢？
What about the fish?

373
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,830
- 现在整座岛都是这样  - 安静
- This is happening all over the island.  - Please. please.

374
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,950
- 请安静  - 我们该怎么办？
- Settle down!  - What are you going to do?

375
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,020
我们会开垦更多田地
We will dig new fields.

376
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,180
- 找到解决方法的  - 我们能战胜黑暗势力
- We will find a way to...  - We can stop the darkness!

377
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,720
拯救我们的小岛
Save our island!

378
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,360
我发现一个山洞里有船
There's a cavern boats!

379
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,110
很大的船
Huge canoes!

380
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,100
我们可以驾着那些船找到毛伊
We can take them, find Maui

381
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,560
让他归还特菲提之心
Make him restore the heart.

382
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,430
我们是航海者
We were voyagers.

383
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,060
我们应该重新出海
We can voyage again!

384
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
你说过族人需要我们的保护
You told me to help our people.

385
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,510
只有这样才能保护他们
This is how we help our people!

386
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,330
爸爸
Dad?

387
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,380
你要干什么？
What are you doing?

388
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,090
我早就应该把那些船全都烧掉
I should've burned those boats a long time ago!

389
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,000
不，不要
No! Don't!

390
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,460
我们必须找到毛伊
We have to find Maui.

391
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,880
然后归还特菲提之心
We have to restore the heart.

392
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,270
根本没有什么心
There is no heart!

393
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,570
这就是一块石头
This...this is just a rock!

394
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,370
不
No!

395
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,210
酋长
Chief!

396
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,820
你母亲不行了
It's your mother!

397
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:01,920
妈妈
Mother.

398
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,560
现在还能做什么？
What can be done?

399
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,350
快去
Go.

400
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,570
奶奶
Grandma.

401
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,760
快去
Go.

402
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,440
现在不行
Not now.

403
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,750
我不能
I can't.

404
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,330
你必须去
You must!

405
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,560
大海选择了你
The ocean chose you!

406
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,280
- 朝着钩状星座的方向走  - 奶奶
- Follow the fish hook.  - Grandma.

407
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,860
等你找到毛伊
And when you find Maui.

408
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,560
你就揪着他的耳朵
You grab him by the ear!

409
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:49,910
告诉他
You say...

410
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,450
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui!

411
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,150
快上船
You will board my boat!

412
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,260
跨越整片大海
Sail across the sea!

413
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,140
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti!

414
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,920
我离不开您
I... I can't leave you.

415
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,300
无论你在哪里，我都与你同在
There is no way you could go, that I won't be with you.

416
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,300
快去
Go!

417
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,050
我听见地平线另一边在呼唤我
There's a line where the sky meet the sea. And he calls me.

418
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,950
谁会知道
But no one knows.

419
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,190
能走多远
How far it goes.

420
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,500
曾经的不知所措的日子已经远离
All time wondering where I need to be is behind me.

421
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,610
前靠自己
I'm on my own

422
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,120
我往前走
Towards unknown!

423
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,310
每一个转弯，每一个路段
Every turn I take. Every trail I track.

424
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,040
都是我选择，不能有遗憾
It's a choise I make. Now I can't turn back.

425
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,610
过去多伟大
From a great unknown.

426
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,220
未来独自闯，我渴望那里
Where I go alone. Where I long to be.

427
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:28,170
她光芒照亮了这海洋，呼唤我
See her light of the night. in the sea, she calls me.

428
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,890
让我知道
And yes, I know.

429
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,340
能走得到
That I can go.

430
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,570
在天空的月亮与晚风陪我前行
There's a moon in the sky and the wind is behind me.

431
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,180
终会知道
So now I'll know.

432
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:49,280
能走多远
How far I'll go!

433
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,650
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana Motunui.

434
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,140
快上船
You will board my boat.

435
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,860
我要带你跨越整片大海
Sail across the sea!

436
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,260
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

437
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,780
我是莫图鲁尼岛
I am Moana.

438
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,220
的莫阿...娜
Of Motu... nui.

439
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,310
憨憨？
Hei-hei?!

440
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,940
别害怕
It's okay.

441
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,470
没事的
You're alright.

442
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,870
看到了吧？
See?

443
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,870
我们走吧
There we go.

444
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,820
多棒的海水啊
Nice water.

445
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,270
大海是我们的朋友
The ocean is a friend of mine.

446
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,730
憨憨
Hei-hei?

447
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,060
憨憨
Hei-hei!

448
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,060
别动
Stay!

449
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:34,660
好了
Okay.

450
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,860
下一站
Next stop.

451
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,020
毛伊
Maui.

452
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,800
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

453
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,550
快上船
You will board my boat.

454
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,560
我要带你跨越整片大海
Sail across the sea.

455
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,120
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

456
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,330
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana... of .. Mo..tu....

457
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,300
快上船
Board my boat!

458
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,230
不
Oh, no!

459
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,410
不，不
No ... no... no...no!

460
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:16,940
不
No!

461
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:29,900
大海
Ocean?

462
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,630
你能帮帮我吗？
Can I get a little help?

463
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,560
糟了
No... no.

464
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:39,990
拜托
Please.

465
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,500
快点儿
Come on!

466
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,950
救命
Help me!

467
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,340
救命
Please!

468
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,720
什么情况
What?!

469
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,110
我说了我需要帮助
I said help me!

470
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,430
但你让大浪来袭击我的船？
And wrecking my boat?!

471
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,360
这也叫帮忙
Not helping!

472
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,710
就让你被鱼群臭死吧
Fish pee in you... all day!

473
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:53,960
那么
So...

474
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,460
毛伊？
Maui?

475
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,360
毛伊
Maui!

476
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,670
毛伊，主宰风和海的半神
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea

477
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,870
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui!

478
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,350
请上船吧
You will board my boat!

479
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,830
不
No!

480
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,640
快上船
You will board my boat!

481
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,150
没错
Yeah!

482
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,430
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
Hi, I'm Moana of Motunui.

483
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,900
- 快上...  - 船
- You will board my...  - Boat!

484
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,520
这有艘船
A boat!

485
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,080
老天爷赐给我一艘...
The Gods have given me a...

486
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,300
毛伊
Maui

487
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,530
万能的变形者
Shape shifter.

488
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,610
主宰风和海的半神
Demigod of the wind and sea.

489
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,960
- 我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜  - 男人们的英雄
- I am Moana of Mo...  - Hero of Men.

490
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,830
什么？
Wha..What?

491
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,540
应该说毛伊是万能的变形者
It's actually Maui, shape shifter.

492
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,990
主宰风和海的半神
Demigod of the wind and sea!

493
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,240
男人们的英雄
Hero of Men.

494
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,060
不好意思打断你了，从头开始吧，人类的英雄
I interupted. From the top. Hero of Men.

495
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,520
开始
Go!

496
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,860
- 我是莫...  - 等等，等等
- I am Mo...  - Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry.

497
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,920
所有人
And women.

498
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,210
包括男人和女人，所有人才对
Men and women. Both! All!

499
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,140
这个可不分男女
Not a guy-girl thing.

500
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,150
你知道的，毛伊是所有人的英雄
You know? Maui is a hero to all!

501
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,960
再来一遍吧
You're doing great.

502
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,050
什么？
What?

503
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,660
- 不，我来这儿是...  - 我知道
- No! I came here to ...  - Of course, of course.

504
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,920
好吧，好吧
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

505
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,360
毛伊对他的崇拜者总是很有耐心的
Maui always has time for his fans.

506
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,190
这种用鸟来写字的方式
When you use a bird to write with

507
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,230
叫做瞅瞅
It's called "tweeting".

508
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,860
我明白的，英雄可不是想见就能见到的
I know, not every day, you get a chance to meet your hero.

509
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,070
你可不是我的英雄
You are not my hero!

510
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,900
我来这儿也不是为了让你在我的桨上签名
And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!

511
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,180
我来这是因为你偷走了特菲提之心
I'm here because you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

512
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,580
现在我要你上船
And you will board my boat.

513
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,670
跟我一起把它还回去
Sail across the sea and put it back!

514
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,300
好吧
Yeah.

515
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,390
听起来你好像不太喜欢我
It almost sounded like you don't like me.

516
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,880
但这是不可能的，因我我已经被困在这里
Which is impossible because I got stuck here.

517
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,020
一千年了，就是为了
For a thousand years, trying to get the heart...

518
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,760
给你们凡人寻找那颗心
As a gift for you, mortals...

519
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,200
好让你们拥有创造生命的力量
So you could have the power to create life itself!

520
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,340
所以我猜你原本想说的是
Yeah, so what I believe you're trying to say.

521
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,590
- 谢谢  - 谢谢？
- Is thank you.  - Thank you?

522
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,520
- 不用谢  - 什么，不
- You're welcome.  - What? No, no, no.

523
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,020
我没有，我不会
I .. I didn't ... I wasn't ...

524
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,740
- 我为什么要说谢谢  - 好啦好啦
- Why would I ever say... I mean...  - Okay, okay, okay...

525
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,360
我知道发生了什么
I see what's happening, yeah.

526
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,970
面对这伟大的神明很奇妙
You're face to face with greatness and it's strange.

527
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,630
都不知道该怎么反应
You don't even know how you feel.

528
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,110
这是很可爱的
It's adorable!

529
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,170
我发觉人类一直没有改变
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change.

530
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,740
现在让你开眼界
Open your eyes let's begin.

531
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,690
要看清楚是我毛伊，请冷静
Yes, it's really me, It's Maui. Breathe it in.

532
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,920
我这完美的发型，身型
I know it's a lot the hair, the body!

533
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,840
当你盯着这优质神明
When you're staring at a Demigod

534
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,120
我只能说一句
What can I say?

535
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,310
不客气
Except you're welcome.

536
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,480
把潮汐、晴天送你
For the tides, the sun, the sky.

537
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:00,400
这很简单，很容易，不客气
Hey, it's okay. It is okay. You're welcome.

538
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,840
我只是一个普通硬汉子，嘿
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy, Hey!

539
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,140
我用手指把天空托起
Hey, what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky.

540
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,200
当你蹒跚前行有我扶持
When you were waddling yay high. This guy!

541
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,330
在寒冷夜里
When the nights got cold.

542
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,040
取暖的火都被偷走
Who stole you fire from down below?

543
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,730
有我在这里哟
You're looking at him, yo!

544
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:21,240
噢，是我让太阳升起
Oh, also I lasso'd the sun.

545
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,260
不客气
You're welcome.

546
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,860
让你多点开心日子
To stretch your days and bring you fun.

547
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,560
我能把狂风驾驭
Also I harnessed the breeze.

548
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,790
不客气 让船航行，树叶落地
You're welcome, to fill your sails and shake your trees.

549
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,840
这不过是小意思，不客气
So what can I say except You're welcome.

550
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,040
我让大地从海中耸立
For the islands I pulled from the sea.

551
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,940
不需要膜拜的意思，不客气
There's no need to pray, it's okay. You're welcome.

552
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,290
我只是单纯的做我自己
I guess it's just my way of being me.

553
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,490
不客气
You're welcome.

554
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,300
不客气
You're welcome.

555
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,590
啊，回头想一想
Well, come to think of it.

556
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,650
我其实可以一口气的
Kid, honestly I can go on and on.

557
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,480
把所有大自然的现象都解释
I can explain every natural phenomenon.

558
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,030
潮汐、草地、大地
The tide, the grass,  the ground.

559
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,830
都是我毛伊所做的好事
Oh... that was Maui just messing around.

560
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,590
我把海鳗狠狠地除掉
I killed an eel, I buried its guts.

561
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,340
种一颗树让你得到椰子
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts.

562
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,330
明不明白
What's the lesson?

563
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,330
有没有新启示
What is the takeaway.

564
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,090
就是当毛伊生气，你快点回避
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway.

565
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,740
你看我皮肤上的印记
And the tapestry here in my skin.

566
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,370
都是彰显胜利的标志
Is a map of the victories I win.

567
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,330
我到哪里，哪里就出现好事
Look where I've been, I make everything happen.

568
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,310
过去小气的小毛伊已变好脾气
Look at that mean mini Maui just tikitty tappin'

569
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,060
还是这句，告诉你，不客气
Well anyway, let me say, You're welcome

570
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,090
我把这世界变美丽
For the wonderful world you know.

571
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,080
这很简单，很容易，不客气
Hey, it's okay... it's okay. You're welcome

572
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,210
我现在想起来我要出行
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go.

573
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,460
给你机会说声不客气
Hey, it's your day to say You're welcome.

574
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,390
我要借用你的船
Cause I'm gonna need that boat.

575
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,580
要扬帆而去远地，不客气
I'm sailing away... away. You're welcome.

576
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,620
我除了漂浮，什么都最棒
Cause Maui can do everything but float.

577
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,880
不客气
You're welcome.

578
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,110
不客气
You're welcome.

579
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,180
谢谢你
And thank you!

580
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,380
放我出去
Hey, let me out!

581
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,820
你这个卑鄙的大骗子
You lying, slimy, son of a...

582
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,550
不用谢
You're welcome.

583
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,740
不
No!

584
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,830
我可不想跟着个小孩去特菲提岛
I'm not going to Te Fiti with some kid.

585
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,800
我还得找回我的鱼钩
I'm gonna get my hook.

586
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,100
你有一个，但我没有，毛伊不能没有鱼钩
You have yours. And I'm not Maui without mine.

587
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,530
好了，去我背后安静会儿
Okay, talk to the back.

588
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:26,890
旅途小点心
Boat snack!

589
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:57,340
再见啦，讨厌的石头岛
Good riddance you filthy pile of pebbles!

590
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,370
不
Oh, no, no, no.

591
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,790
别那样看着我
Don't look at me like that.

592
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,940
那个山洞挺好的，她肯定喜欢
It's a beautiful cave, she's gonna love it.

593
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,530
而且我会好好
And I'm going to love you.

594
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,240
享用你的
In my belly.

595
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,800
不过得先让你长点肉
Now let's fatten you up, drumstick!

596
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:33,690
真是精彩的一跳啊
I could watch that all day.

597
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,990
好了，这座岛是你的了
Okay, enjoy the island!

598
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,080
- 毛伊号，出发  - 不
- Maui, out!  - No!

599
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:38,890
停下
Stop!

600
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,930
你必须把那颗心还回去
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

601
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,570
什么时候回来的
Did not see that coming.

602
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,530
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

603
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,000
这是我的船
This is my canoe.

604
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,160
你必须跟我去特...
And you will journey to...

605
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:12,800
好了，摆平了，我们得走了
All right, get over it. We gotta move.

606
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,340
她又回来了
And she's back.

607
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,140
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫...
I am Moana of Motunu...

608
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,320
- 你叫莫阿娜，对吧  - 没错
- It was Moana, right?  - Yes.

609
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,070
你必须把这颗心还回去
And you will restore the heart.

610
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:42,400
好吧，我认输
All right, I'm out.

611
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,940
够了
Oh, come on!

612
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,490
你到底怎么回事
What is your problem?

613
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,960
- 你很怕它吗？  - 不
- Are you afraid of it?  - No.

614
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,590
我可没害怕
No. I'm not afraid...

615
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,300
别多管闲事，不然我把你塞进腋窝
Stay out of it or you're sleeping in my armpit.

616
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,770
你也闭嘴，这根本不是什么心
You stop it. That is not a heart.

617
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,020
而是个诅咒 我一拿到它
It is a curse. The second I took it

618
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,870
就被击落到海里
I got blasted out of the sky

619
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,900
还弄丢了我的鱼钩
And I lost my hook!

620
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,480
让它离我远点儿
Get it away from me.

621
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,310
你是说这个吗？
Get this away?

622
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,510
我是个半神，知道吗？
I'm Demigod, okay?

623
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,110
你在这样，我就揍你了
Stop that! I will smite you!

624
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:19,670
你真的想挨打？
You wannna get "smote"?

625
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,930
挨揍？
"Smoten"?

626
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,700
听着，那玩意儿根本没有创造生命的法力
Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life.

627
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,600
它是死神的追踪器
It's a homing beacon of death.

628
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,060
如果不丢掉它，可怕的事情就会接踵而来
If you don't put it away, bad things are gonna come for it.

629
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,350
来找这个吗，特菲提之心？
Come for this? The heart?

630
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,480
你说的就是这颗心吗
You mean this heart right here!

631
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,140
快来拿啊
Come and get it!

632
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,510
你这样会害死我们的
You are gonna get us killed.

633
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,720
不，我要带你去特菲提岛
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti.

634
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,080
让你亲手把它还回去
So you can put it back.

635
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:40,890
谢谢
Thank you.

636
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,360
不用谢
You're welcome.

637
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,940
卡卡穆拉
Kakamora.

638
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:49,980
卡卡什么？
Kaka... what?

639
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,660
杀人不眨眼的小海盗们
Murdering little pirates.

640
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,770
不知道他们来这儿做什么
Wonder what they're here for?

641
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,130
看起来挺可爱嘛
They're kind of cute.

642
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,640
大海，拜托了，帮帮我们
Ocean do something, help us!

643
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,160
大海帮不了你，你得靠自己
The ocean doesn't help you. You help yourself!

644
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,620
拉紧升降索，绑好支索
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

645
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,120
你不会驾船？
You can't sail?!

646
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,540
我
I...

647
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,180
我是自学的
I am self taught?

648
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,080
你不是会变身之类的吗？
Can't you shape shift or something?!

649
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,990
没看到我没有鱼钩吗？
Do you see my hook?

650
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,010
没有鱼钩我什么都变不了
No magic hook, no magic powers.

651
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,680
他们的船变成了很多条船
Their boat is turning into more boats!

652
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,490
没错，那是我干的
Yup! I just did that.

653
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,670
不不
No, no, no, no!

654
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,770
憨憨
Hei-hei!

655
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,130
毛伊，他们拿走了那颗心
Maui! They took the heart!

656
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:08,600
那是只鸡
That a chicken.

657
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:09,950
那颗心就在
The heart is in the...

658
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,390
我们得把它抢回来
We have to get him back!

659
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,490
毛伊
Maui!

660
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:34,790
那儿呢，就在那儿
There! Right there!

661
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,350
你转向了，你要干什么
You're turning?! What are you doing?!

662
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,780
逃跑啊
Escaping.

663
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,680
- 那颗心怎么办  - 别管它了，你拿不回来的
- The heart!  - Forget it, you'll never get it back.

664
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,950
况且你已经有了一颗更好的了
Beside, we got a better one.

665
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:44,940
嘿
Hey!

666
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,840
没有浆我还怎么划船
What do I gonna steer with?!

667
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,180
他们会杀了你的
They're just gonna kill you!

668
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,330
椰子小人儿
Coconuts.

669
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,740
拿到了
Got it!

670
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:43,350
嘿
Hey!

671
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,410
我们成功了
We did it!

672
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,010
恭喜你捡回一条命，姑娘
Congratulations, on not being dead, curly.

673
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,020
你让我大吃一惊
You surprise me.

674
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,990
但别指望我会碰那玩意儿
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

675
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,390
要到达特菲提岛
You wanna get to Te Fiti.

676
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,770
必须穿洋过海
You gotta go through a whole ocean of bad.

677
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,100
还可能会碰上恶卡
Not to mention Te Ka.

678
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,550
那个火山怪兽？
Lava monster?

679
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,960
你打败过火山怪兽吗？
Ever defeat a lava monster?

680
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,740
没有
No.

681
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,270
你呢？
Have you?

682
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,980
我可不想和一个凡人一起去找死
I'm not going on a suicide mission with some mortal.

683
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,550
没有我，你不可能把那颗心放回原处
You can't restore the heart without me.

684
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,470
而我已经拒绝了你
And me says no.

685
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,920
我要去找鱼钩
I'm getting my hook.

686
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,450
讨论结束
End of discussion.

687
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,090
你会成为大英雄的
You'd be a hero.

688
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,750
那才是你应该做的事情对吧
That's what you're all about, right?

689
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:00,750
小姑娘，我已经是大英雄了
Little girl, I am a hero.

690
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,140
过去可能是
Maybe you were but now...

691
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,530
现在你就是那个偷走了特菲提之心
Now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

692
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,670
让整个世界陷入灾难的小偷
The guy who cursed the world!

693
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,060
你已经不是英雄了
You're no one's hero.

694
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:14,760
不是吗？
No one?

695
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,840
但是，如果你把这个放回去
But, put this back.

696
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,870
你就拯救了全世界
Save the world.

697
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,430
就会成为所有人的英雄
You'd be everyone's hero.

698
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,920
毛伊
Maui! Maui! Maui!

699
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,480
你好伟大
You're so amazing!

700
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,260
没有鱼钩，我们到不了特菲提岛
We'd never make it without my hook.

701
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,940
因为我们不是恶卡的对手
Not pass Te Ka.

702
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,870
那就先去找你的鱼钩
Then we get your hook.

703
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,130
找到鱼钩，打败恶卡
We get you hook, take out Te Ka.

704
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:48,100
最后归还特菲提之心
Restore the heart.

705
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,140
除非你不想做回
Unless you don't wanna be

706
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:57,960
从前的毛伊，那个主宰风和海的半神，所有人的大英雄
Maui, Demigod of the Wind and Sea, Hero to all

707
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,280
首先我们去找鱼钩
First, we get my hook.

708
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,970
然后拯救全世界
Then save the world.

709
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,250
成交？
Deal?

710
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:07,400
成交
Deal.

711
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:12,950
就是想再试试
Worth a shot.

712
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,940
好吧，我们往东走
Okay, we go east.

713
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:18,080
去螃蟹怪的巢穴
To the lair of Tamatoa.

714
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:23,250
我的鱼钩肯定被那个眼尖的食底泥动物捡到了
If anyone has my hook, it's that beady-eyed bottom feeder.

715
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,280
教我驾船吧
Teach me to sail.

716
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,150
我的任务就是带你漂洋过海
My job is to deliver Maui across the great ocean.

717
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,310
所以我
I should...

718
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,610
我应该来驾船
I should be sailing.

719
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:50,080
这叫寻路，小公主
It's called Wayfinding, Princess.

720
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,460
寻路可不像驾船那么简单
And it's not just sails and knots.

721
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,390
你不仅要知道目的地在哪儿
It's seeing where you're going in your mind.

722
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:56,630
还要清楚当前的位置
Knowing where you are.

723
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,970
和已经走过的地方
By knowing where you've been.

724
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,800
好吧，不过我可不是什么公主
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

725
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,500
我是酋长的女儿
I'm the daughter of the chief.

726
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,620
- 没什么区别  - 有区别
- Same difference.  - No.

727
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:07,280
如果你穿条裙子，再带只小宠物
If you wear a dress, and you have an animal sidekick.

728
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,730
你就是公主了
You're a Princess.

729
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,190
所以你不是寻路人
You're not a wayfinder.

730
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,800
也永远不会成为寻路人
You will never be a wayfinder.

731
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,590
你不可能成为寻路
You will never be a way...

732
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:19,720
不会吧
Really?

733
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,370
拿我的屁股当靶子
Blow dart in my butt cheek.

734
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,680
真是个小混蛋
You are a bad person.

735
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:31,140
你只要能讲话，就能教我
If you can talk, you can teach.

736
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,470
寻路法则
Wayfinding.

737
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,310
第一课，开始吧
Lesson one. Hit it!

738
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,130
拉帆脚索
Pull the sheet.

739
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,050
不是那根
Not the sheet.

740
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:42,210
不对
No.

741
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,130
不对
Nope!

742
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:44,390
不对
Nope!

743
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,630
不对
No.

744
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,330
那根你已经试过了
Tried that one already.

745
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,830
我让你做的是观星
You're measuring the stars.

746
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,800
不是和空气击掌
Not giving the sky a high five.

747
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,910
如果洋流是温暖的，就说明你的航向没错
If the current's warm, you're going the right way.

748
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,150
是冷的
It's cold.

749
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,590
等等，现在变热了
Wait, it's getting warmer.

750
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,970
太恶心了
That is disgusting!

751
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:10,360
你是故意的
What is wrong with you?!

752
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,140
我们到了
We're here?

753
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,470
看到了吧，都说了我能行的
See? Told you I can do it!

754
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:41,130
莫图鲁尼
Motunui.

755
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,640
我又回来了
I'm home?

756
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:48,590
莫阿娜
Moana!

757
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,410
爸爸
Dad?

758
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,680
莫阿娜
Moana!

759
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:52,850
妈妈
Mom?

760
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,430
救命
Help!

761
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,560
不
No!

762
00:53:59,170 --> 00:53:59,970
莫阿娜
Moana!

763
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,410
美容觉睡得还好吧？
Enjoying your beauty rest?

764
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,620
要知道真正的寻路人从不睡觉
You know, a real wayfinder, never sleeps.

765
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,340
这样才能不偏离航线
So they actually get where they need to go.

766
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,470
打起精神来，小不点儿
Muscle up buttercup!

767
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,440
我们到了
We're here.

768
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,260
你确定你的鱼钩在他手里
You sure this guy's gonna have your hook?

769
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,030
螃蟹怪 我确定
Tamatoa? Oh, hell have it.

770
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,340
他就是个海底清道夫
He's a scavenger.

771
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,760
什么东西都要捡，还以为那样会很酷
Collects stuff, things that makes him look cool.

772
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,670
而且对于螃蟹怪来说
And for Tamatoa?

773
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,110
我的鱼钩肯定是最酷的收藏品
Trust me, my hook is the coolest collectible.

774
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,150
他住在那上面？
And he lives up there?

775
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,500
不，不
Oh, no, no, no...

776
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:38,970
那里只是一个入口
That's just the entrance

777
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,450
通往拉罗泰
To a Lalotai.

778
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,510
拉罗泰？
Lalotai?

779
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,410
怪兽王国？
Realm of Monsters?!

780
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,490
所以我们要去怪兽王国？
We're going to the Realm of Monsters?

781
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,380
我们？
We?

782
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,160
不
No.

783
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:49,830
我自己去
Me.

784
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,830
你就跟另外一只鸡一起待在这里
You are gonna stay here with the other chicken.

785
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,500
明白我的意思吧，来击个掌
That's what I'm talking about, give me some!

786
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,850
来嘛，我说得多好啊，你没听明白
Come on, that was a good one, how do you not get it?

787
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,000
我是说她是个胆小鬼，就跟船上的那只鸡一样
I called her a chicken, there's a chicken on the boat.

788
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,950
我知道她是个人，但那可不是，还是算了吧
I know she's human! But that's not the... You know what? Forget it.

789
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,770
别管它了，我不想跟你解释
Forget it! I'm not explaining it to you.

790
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,700
说明白就不好笑了啊
'Cause then it's not funny.

791
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,220
听着
So...

792
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,550
酋长的女儿
Daughter of the chief.

793
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,380
我觉得你应该待在村子里
I thought you stayed in the village.

794
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:29,380
哄哄小孩，坐坐家务什么的
You know, kissing babies and things.

795
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,460
我只是不太理解
Hey, I'm just trying to understand

796
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,100
为什么你的族人要让你
Why your people decided to send...

797
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,300
该怎么说呢
How do I phrase this?

798
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:37,160
来冒险
You!

799
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:37,880
我的族人
My people...

800
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,580
他们没让我来，让我来的是大海
Didn't send me. The ocean did.

801
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,230
大海？好吧，选了一个不会开船的
The ocean? Makes sense! You're what? Eight?

802
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,030
小不点儿
Can't sail?

803
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:47,260
真够明智的
Obvious choice.

804
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,310
它选择了我
It chose me.

805
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,010
自由它的原因
For a reason.

806
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:52,810
如果大海够聪明的话
If the ocean's so smart

807
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,560
它为什么不直接把特菲提之心送回去呢
Why didn't it just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself?

808
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,390
或者帮我找回鱼钩
Or bring me my hook?

809
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,430
我想它肯定是疯了
The ocean's straight up pooky dooks!

810
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,460
不过它选择你应该没错
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

811
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,750
你可是天之骄子
You're the chosen one.

812
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,340
大海选择你肯定有它的理由
The ocean chose you for a reason.

813
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,720
如果你要唱歌的话，我真的会吐的
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.

814
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,960
我没看到什么入口
So, not seeing entrance.

815
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:35,390
因为只有拿人献祭以后，入口才会出现
Yes, because it only appears after a human sacrifice.

816
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,660
开玩笑的
Kidding!

817
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,550
真没幽默感
So serious!

818
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,930
不用担心，它比看起来要深得多
Don't worry. It's a lot farther down than it looks.

819
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:16,490
我还在降落
I am still falling!

820
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,190
你能做到的
You can do this.

821
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:21,800
跳
Go!

822
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:45,090
毛伊完美落地
And he's sticks the landing.

823
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,290
什么
What?

824
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,980
你傻了吧，她根本没下来
Dumb-dumb, she's not even here.

825
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,760
凡人可不敢跳进怪兽王国
No mortal's gonna jump into the realm of mon...

826
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,610
她
Well....

827
00:57:59,120 --> 00:57:59,710
死定了
She's dead.

828
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:02,630
好了，我要去找鱼钩了
Okay, let's get my hook.

829
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,690
毛伊的鱼钩
Maui's fish hook.

830
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,030
是啊
Yeah!

831
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,760
抱歉
Sorry!

832
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:10,690
我以为你是个怪兽呢
I thought you're a monster, but...

833
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,450
不过我找到你的鱼钩了，你说得对
I found your hook! And you're right...

834
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,800
- 螃蟹怪的确很喜欢他的宝贝  - 老实待着
- This Tamatoa really likes his treasure. - Stay!

835
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,270
什么？不
What? No!

836
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:17,790
- 是我找到了你的  - 听着
- I... I'm the one who found...  - Listen...

837
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,200
一千年来
For a thousand years...

838
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,820
我一直留着这帅气的发型
I've only been thinking of keeping this hair silky

839
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,610
盼望着找回我的鱼钩，然后东山再起
Getting my hook, and being awesome again.

840
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,150
我可不想让一个凡人
And it's not getting screwed up by a mortal.

841
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:28,190
进到怪兽的洞里
Who has no business

842
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,600
去破坏我的好事
Inside of a monster's cave except...

843
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:33,940
除非
Except...

844
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,470
她可以做诱饵
Maybe as bait.

845
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,110
什么？
Huh?

846
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:40,790
这里真漂亮啊
Wow! The shiny, glittery cave.

847
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,400
就像我一样
And just like me.

848
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,240
到处都是闪闪发光的宝贝
It is covered in sparkly treasure.

849
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:46,740
闪呀，闪呀
Sparkle, sparkle

850
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:48,800
- 闪呀  - 你的演技真是太差了
- Sparkle. - You're not selling it.

851
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:51,120
这也太蠢了，我要直接去拿鱼钩
This is stupid! I'm just gonna walk up and get it.

852
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,010
不等你靠近，他就会把你杀了
You go up there, he will kill you.

853
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,210
乖乖按计划来
Just stick to the plan.

854
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,990
等他出现了，你就缠住他
Oh, when he shows up, keep him distracted.

855
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,680
让他跟你吹吹牛
Make him talk about himself.

856
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:02,010
他很喜欢吹嘘自己有多厉害
He loves bragging about how great he is!

857
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:04,090
那你们俩应该合得来
You two must get along as well!

858
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,690
在我扯断他的腿之前的确是的
No. Not since I ripped off his leg.

859
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,250
你扯断了他的
You ripped off his le...

860
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,140
毛伊
Maui?

861
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,650
看我找到了什么
What have we here?

862
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:24,020
这是个闪闪发光的
It's a sparkly, shiny.

863
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,410
等等
Wait a minute...

864
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,280
是个人呢
It's a human!

865
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,030
你来这里干什么？
What are you doing down here?

866
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:33,270
这里可是怪兽王... 看着我的一只眼睛，宝贝
In the realm of the mons... Just pick an eye, babe.

867
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:35,850
你晃得我都忘了要说什么了
I can't... I can't concentrate on what I'm saying

868
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,790
别晃，别晃了
If you keep... Yep, pick one, pick one!

869
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,970
你真是个有意思的小玩意儿
You're a funny looking little thing, aren't you?

870
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,460
别碰，这是我奶奶给的
Don't! That's my grandma's.

871
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,790
“这是我奶奶的” 我奶奶被我吃了
"That's my grandma's" I ate my grandma!

872
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:47,690
那花了我整整一周，因为她实在是太大了
And it took a week 'cause she was absolutely humongous.

873
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,900
你在这里做什么？
Why are you here?

874
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,270
我很崇拜你
'Cause you're amazing!

875
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:56,150
我们人类都知道海底有一只
And we mortals, have heard of the tale of the crab.

876
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,440
很了不起的大螃蟹
Who became a legend!

877
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,650
所以我只是想知道
And I just had to know...

878
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,790
你是怎么变得这么
How you being so crab...

879
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:05,460
了不起的？
-oulous?

880
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:10,320
你就想让我讲讲我自己的故事吗？
Are you just trying to get me to talk about myself?

881
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:12,970
如果真是这样
Because if you are...

882
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,410
我很乐意讲讲哦
I will gladly do so.

883
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:17,950
让我唱给你听
In song form!

884
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:23,680
我不是一直那么出众与美丽
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam.

885
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,450
我曾经是小蟹一只
I was a drab little crab once..

886
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,190
我明白蛤蜊都可以很开心
Now I know, I can be happy as a clam.

887
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:32,860
因为我非常的美丽
Because I'm beautiful, baby.

888
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,900
古老的一句，相信你自己
Did your granny say listen to your heart.

889
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,690
只要闪亮，不靠外表
Be who you are on the inside.

890
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,190
我用四个字可以推翻这论据
I need three words to tear her argument a part.

891
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:44,820
这是谎言
Your granny lied.

892
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,720
我宁愿要闪亮，就像沉没海底海盗的宝藏
I'd rather be shiny like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck.

893
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,630
擦亮甲板，就让它闪亮
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny.

894
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,390
就像珠宝挂在贵妇的身上
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck

895
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:59,200
让我来告诉你
Just a sec, don't you know?

896
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:03,140
小鱼很愚蠢，看见闪亮的就追逐
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb They chase anything that glitters

897
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:07,760
初级班 噢，看他们游过来
Beginners. Oh, and here they come, come, come.

898
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,090
向最闪亮的我追逐
To the brightest thing that glitters.

899
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,530
我的晚餐，这免费大餐
Mmm, fish dinners. I just love free food.

900
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,680
你是海洋大餐
And you look like seafood

901
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,830
- 不  - 大蟹饼
- No!  - Hey! Crab cake.

902
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,910
我回来了
I'm back!

903
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,790
毛伊登场了
It's Maui time!

904
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,720
想看点什么，伙计
What do you say, little buddy.

905
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:35,380
巨鹰？如你所愿
Giant hawk? Coming up!

906
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,920
毛伊
Well, well, well....

907
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,320
你小子不是会变形的吗
Little Maui's having trouble with his look.

908
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,120
这是什么假冒迷你神
You little semi-demi-mini-god.

909
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:59,430
哎呀，你的表现太差劲了，振作点行吗
Ouch! What a terrible performance. Get the hook! Get it?

910
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,490
你的法术已经失灵了
You don't swing it like you used to, man.

911
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:05,920
我全新的开始你也有功劳
Yet I have to give you credit for my start.

912
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,520
还有你漂亮的纹身
And your tattoos on the outside.

913
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:12,210
跟你一样，我让自己更有魅力
For just like you I made myself a work of art.

914
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,250
藏不住，因为我太闪亮
I'll never hide, I can't.

915
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:19,100
看我闪闪发亮像钻石那样
I'm too shiny! Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough.

916
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:22,380
看我全身是如此闪亮
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny.

917
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,190
再多军队，我也不会觉得多
Send your armies but they'll never be enough.

918
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,200
我的外壳好坚强
My shell's too tough, Maui man.

919
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,910
你能试一试
You could try, try, try...

920
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,360
可是讨价还价太麻烦
But you can't expect a demigod.

921
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,710
这样子太麻烦
To beat a decapod.

922
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:34,690
对不对
Look it up!

923
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:38,660
生命到尽头现在我要撕开小心脏
You will die, die, die. Now it's time for me to take apart.

924
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:40,430
你的那颗
Your aching heart.

925
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,950
你以为自己很重要
Far from the ones who abandoned you.

926
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:50,300
把所有的爱付出
Chasing the love of these humans.

927
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,590
人类他们把你抛弃
Who made you feel wanted.

928
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:56,190
你装作坚强
You try to be tough.

929
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,420
但你的内心其实很柔软
But your armour's just not hard enough.

930
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:05,220
毛伊，现在我要把你收拾
Maui! Now it's time to kick your hiney.

931
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,350
没有谁比我更闪亮
Ever seen someone so shiny?

932
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,300
没有关系，最后机会再看一次
Soak it in cause it's the last you'll ever see.

933
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:15,050
我就是注定那么的闪亮
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny!

934
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,130
在我吃掉你之前，你想不想
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea.

935
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,590
求求我
Just for me.

936
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:23,650
你才不会如此闪亮
You'll never be quite as shiny

937
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:29,600
你只是善良，不闪亮
You wish you were nice and shiny

938
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:31,300
嘿
Hey!

939
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,700
我有个宝贝给你
I got something shiny for you.

940
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,060
特菲提之心
The heart of Te Fiti.

941
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,810
你跑不了了
You can't run from me.

942
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:41,590
跑吧
Oh, you can?

943
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,190
你总能给我惊喜
You keep surprising me.

944
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:48,140
不过就你那两条细腿也跑不了多远
It's only so far you can get on these two little legs.

945
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,140
创造生命的法力
The power of creation!

946
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,790
就要属于我了
For a crustacean!

947
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,040
它在哪儿？
Where is it? Where is it?

948
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,550
我们快走
We gotta go!

949
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:01,730
那颗心怎么办
Well, what about the heart.

950
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:02,940
留给他好了
He can have it.

951
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:04,360
我还有一颗更好的
I've got a better one.

952
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:08,080
我找到了，等等
Yes, I have the ... Wait a minute.

953
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,220
她在贝壳上涂了
I see she's taken a barnacle

954
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:12,820
发光海藻，想要分散我的
And she's covered it in bioluminescent algae.

955
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,310
注意力
As a diversion.

956
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:18,610
给我回来
Come back here!

957
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,300
嘿
Hey! Hey!

958
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:28,020
你们喜欢我唱的歌吗？
Did you like the song?

959
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:37,810
我们还活着
We're alive!

960
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,590
我们还活
We're ali...

961
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,250
听着
Listen

962
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:45,240
我很感谢你在海底救了我
I appreciate what you did down there.

963
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,540
你很勇敢
Took guts.

964
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,540
但是，不好意思
But... I'm sorry.

965
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,440
我在跟你说真心话，可你好像并没有认真听
I'm tryin' to be sincere for once, and it feels like you're distracted.

966
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,020
- 怎么会，不可能  - 真的吗？
- No, no, no way!  - Really?

967
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,780
你看我的表情就像是看到了一个
'Cause you're looking at me like I have a ...

968
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:00,960
鲨鱼头
Shark head.

969
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,660
- 什么，你有个鲨鱼头吗  - 其实我
- Do you have a shark head? 'Cause I ...  - Look ...

970
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,960
听着，重点是
The point is ...

971
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:11,420
你只是个小女孩，小不点儿，总之，你本可以置身事外
For a little girl, child thing, whatever who had no business being down there.

972
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,420
却帮了我一个大忙
You did me a solid.

973
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,510
不过你也是死里逃生
But you also almost died.

974
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,010
现在的我连那只愚蠢的螃蟹都打不过
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab!

975
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,140
想要打败恶卡，简直是做梦
So chances of beating Te Ka, Bupkis.

976
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:23,730
所以我们肯定到不了特菲提岛
We're never making it to Te Fiti.

977
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,130
还是放弃吧
This mission is cursed.

978
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:27,300
不能放弃
It's not cursed.

979
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:31,070
- 鲨鱼头  - 绝对不能放弃
- Shark head.  - It is not cursed!

980
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:46,640
放弃吧
Cursed.

981
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,600
我只能跟你们说，我们死定了
What can I say, except we're dead soon.

982
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,600
我们死定了
We're dead soon.

983
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,610
你就不能再试试吗
Can you at least try?

984
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:03,640
巨鹰
Giant hawk.

985
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:09,720
没关系，我们死定了
Hey, it's okay, it's okay. We're dead soon.

986
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,670
好了，休息时间结束
All right, breaktime's over.

987
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,280
- 快起来  - 为什么？
- Get up!  - Why?

988
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:14,930
你又要长篇大论了
You're gonna give me a speech

989
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:19,330
告诉我我能打败恶卡，因为我是毛伊
Tell me I could beat Te Ka 'cause I'm "Maui"?

990
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,110
给我走开，小人
Take a hike, tiny.

991
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,450
你这些刺青是怎么来的？
How do you get your tattoo's?

992
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,260
我每做一件事刺青就会多一块
They show up when I earn them.

993
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,630
那块儿是怎么来的？
How'd you earn that one?

994
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,150
上面讲的是什么？
What's that for?

995
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,230
那是我帮人类发现了不你市
That's a man's discovery of Nanya.

996
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,790
不你市是哪儿？
What's Nanya?

997
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:42,850
就是不关你事
None ya business.

998
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,020
你不说我就一直问
I'll just keep asking.

999
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,950
它是怎么来的？
What's it for?

1000
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:51,890
收起你的破桨
You need to stop doing that.

1001
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:58,710
- 走开  - 告诉我它是怎么来的
- Back off!  - Just tell me what it is?!

1002
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,010
我说了走开
I said back off.

1003
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,800
是不是因为它，你的鱼钩才没了法力？
Is it why your hook's not working?

1004
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:19,230
如果你不想说
You don't wanna talk.

1005
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,910
那就别说了
Don't talk.

1006
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,130
如果你想把我扔下船
You wanna throw me off the boat.

1007
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:24,820
那就扔吧
Throw me off.

1008
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:28,220
你想说我根本不知道自己在干什么
You wanna tell me, I don't know what I'm doing?

1009
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:30,380
你说的没错
I know I don't.

1010
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,900
我也不知道大海为什么会选择我
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1011
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,420
你说得对
You're right.

1012
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:41,180
但是，我的小岛正在消亡
But my island is dying.

1013
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,600
我必须冒险
So I am here.

1014
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:48,060
现在只剩下我和你
It's just me and you.

1015
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:50,290
我想帮你
And I want to help.

1016
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:55,560
可你不愿意让我帮你
But I can't if you don't let me.

1017
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:03,510
我并不是天生的半神
I wasn't born a demigod.

1018
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,650
我的父母都是凡人
I had human parents.

1019
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,340
他们
They...

1020
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:10,100
他们只是看了一眼
They took one look and...

1021
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,490
就决定要把我扔掉
And decided they did not want me.

1022
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,410
他们把我丢到了海里
They threw me under the sea.

1023
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,930
就像什么事也没发生一样
Like I was nothing.

1024
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:25,840
不知怎么地，天神们发现了我
Somehow I was found by the Gods.

1025
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,770
还给了我这根鱼钩法杖
They gave me the hook.

1026
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:31,630
是他们让我成为了毛伊
They made me... Maui.

1027
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,630
之后我回到了人类当中
And back to the humans I went.

1028
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,780
为他们带去了海岛、火种、椰子
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts!

1029
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,700
他们要什么我就给什么
Anything they could ever want.

1030
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:45,790
你为他们拿了那颗心
You took the heart for them.

1031
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,770
为他们做任何事
You did everything for them.

1032
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,260
只希望能讨好他们
So they'd loved you.

1033
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:56,050
可他们永远都不满足
It was never enough.

1034
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:07,550
也许天神发现你是有原因的
Maybe the Gods found you for a reason.

1035
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,820
也许是大海把你带到了他们面前
Maybe the ocean brought you to them.

1036
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:14,840
因为它觉得你命不该绝
Because it saw someone who is worthy of being saved.

1037
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:19,740
但是让你成为毛伊的并不是天神
But the Gods aren't the ones who make you Maui.

1038
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,510
而是你自己
You are.

1039
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,510
好了
Okay, okay.

1040
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,370
我也爱你，伙计
I... I love you too, buddy.

1041
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,470
真棒
Yeah!

1042
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,410
下一站，特菲提岛
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1043
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:01,340
- 看什么？  - 我知道了
- What?  - I figured it out

1044
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,720
其实大海让我拉来那些岛屿
You know the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands.

1045
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,920
是为了让你的祖先们在航海时发现它们
'Cause your ancestors would sail our seas. Find them!

1046
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:12,490
然后在岛上建立村庄
All those new lands, new villages...

1047
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:15,280
所有的岛屿和村庄都因为大海而连在一起
It was the water that connected them all.

1048
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:17,740
如果我是大海
And if I were the ocean

1049
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,990
我也会选择一个
I think I'd be looking for a...

1050
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,170
卷发的酋长女儿
Curly haired, non-princess.

1051
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,500
让一切都从头开始
To start that again.

1052
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,480
你从来没有对我说过
That is literaly the nicest thing

1053
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:29,330
这么感人的话呢
You've ever said to me.

1054
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:33,110
也许你应该等到了特菲提岛再说
Probably should've saved it for Te Fiti.

1055
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,670
已经到了
I did.

1056
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:39,840
莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
Moana of Motunui.

1057
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:41,410
我想你
I believe.

1058
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,610
已经成功地带着毛伊
You have officially delivered Maui.

1059
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:45,630
跨越了整片大海
Across the great sea.

1060
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:50,120
莫阿娜
Moana!  Moana!  Moana!

1061
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:52,180
你好伟大
You're so amazing!

1062
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,770
时间到了
It's time.

1063
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,360
去拯救世界吧
Go, save the world.

1064
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,090
毛伊
Maui!

1065
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,160
你在干什么？
What... What are you doing?

1066
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:16,670
找一个更合适的入口
Finding you a better way in!

1067
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,740
- 我们过不去的  - 过得去
- We won't make it!  - Yes, we will!

1068
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:21,810
- 快掉头  - 不
- Turn around!  - No!

1069
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:23,380
- 莫阿娜，停下  - 不
- Moana, stop!  - No!

1070
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,520
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

1071
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,650
毛伊
Maui?

1072
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:05,700
我说了掉头
I told you to turn back.

1073
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,090
我觉得我们能过得去
I thought we could make it.

1074
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:11,760
我们
We?

1075
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,150
我觉得我能过得去
I thought I could make it.

1076
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,340
我们可以修好它
We can fix it!

1077
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,120
鱼钩法杖是天神做的
It was made by the Gods.

1078
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:22,270
你不可能修得好
You can't fix it!

1079
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:24,540
下次小心一点就好了
Next time we'll be more careful.

1080
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:27,140
恶卡只能待在障壁岛上
Te Ka was stuck on the barrier islands.

1081
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,550
它是熔岩做的
It's lava!

1082
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:29,700
不能碰水
It can't go in the water.

1083
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:31,130
我们可以绕路过去
We can find a way around.

1084
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:33,200
我不会再去了
I'm not going back.

1085
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,260
什么，我们还得把那颗心放回去呢
What... We still have to restore the heart.

1086
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:38,370
我的鱼钩已经裂了
My hook is cracked.

1087
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:40,450
再被击中一次，它就彻底毁了
One more hit and it's over.

1088
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,720
毛伊，你必须归还特菲提之心
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1089
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,810
没有鱼钩法杖，我什么都做不了
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1090
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,000
不是那样的
That's not true.

1091
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,280
没有鱼钩法杖，我什么都做不了
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1092
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:01,890
我们走到今天这一步，都是因为你当初偷了这颗心
We're only here because you stole the heart in the first place.

1093
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,160
不，这一切都是因为大海说你
No, we're here because the ocean told you

1094
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:07,910
与众不同，而你也就当了真
You're special and you believed it,

1095
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:12,360
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

1096
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,710
- 快上船，我要带你  - 再见了，莫阿娜
- You will board my boat.  - Goodbye, Moana.

1097
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:17,320
- 跨越整片大海  - 我不能为了
- Sail across the sea,  - I'm not killing myself

1098
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,930
证明自己而搭上我的性命
So you can prove you're something you're not!

1099
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,660
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1100
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:22,560
大海选择了我
The Ocean chose me!

1101
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:25,220
它选错了人
They chose wrong.

1102
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,710
毛伊
Maui!

1103
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,140
为什么要带我来这里
Why did you bring me here?

1104
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,810
你选错了人
I'm not the right person.

1105
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,910
去找个更合适的人吧
You have to choose someone else.

1106
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,970
找个更合适的人
Choose someone else!

1107
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,430
求你了
Please!

1108
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:33,430
不
No.

1109
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:52,380
你已经离家很远了
You're a long ways past the reef.

1110
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:54,370
奶奶？
Grandma?

1111
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,170
还好我选了黄貂鱼纹身
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1112
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,270
奶奶
Grandma!

1113
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,020
我尽力了，奶奶
I tried, grandma.

1114
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:09,820
可
I...

1115
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:12,720
我做不到
I couldn't do it.

1116
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,550
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

1117
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:18,890
我不该让你一个人承担这么多
I never should've put so much on your shoulders.

1118
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,330
如果你想要回家
If you are ready to go home.

1119
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:25,200
我可以陪你回去
I will be with you.

1120
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:43,800
你在犹豫什么
Why do you hesitate?

1121
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,370
我不知道
I don't know.

1122
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,970
有个女孩多么出众
I know a girl from an island.

1123
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:56,490
她来自那个海岛
She stands apart from the crowd.

1124
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,710
她爱海洋也爱家园
She loves the sea and her people.

1125
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:02,950
大家都为她骄傲
She makes her whole family proud.

1126
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:06,910
也许世界和你作对
Sometimes the world seems against you.

1127
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:10,020
旅途上跌倒受伤
The journey may leave a scar.

1128
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,510
但伤疤却见证了
But scars can heal and reveal

1129
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:15,380
你的成长
Just where you are.

1130
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:19,540
你爱的人能改变你
The people you love will change you.

1131
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:22,770
你学的知识指引你
The things you have learned will guide you.

1132
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:26,130
没有什么能阻止你
And nothing on earth can silence.

1133
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:29,680
你心中的那个声音
The quiet voice still inside you.

1134
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:33,050
当这声音轻轻地问
And when that voice starts to whisper

1135
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:36,060
莫阿娜，你已成长了这么多
Moana you've come so far.

1136
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,550
莫阿娜，现在
Moana listen.

1137
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:43,990
你是谁你知道吗？
Do you know who you are?

1138
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,950
我是谁？
Who am I?

1139
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,680
我就是我，热爱着小岛
I am a girl who loves my island.

1140
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,880
这海洋给我生命
I'm the girl who loves the sea.

1141
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,860
与使命
It calls me...

1142
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:05,050
伟大的酋长是我的父亲
I am the daughter of the village chief.

1143
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:08,920
我们的祖先越洋万里
We are descended from voyagers.

1144
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,640
找到这里，然后给我
Who found their way across the world.

1145
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:14,450
这启示
They call me ...

1146
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,070
带领大家找到这地方
I've delivered us to where we are.

1147
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,180
我的旅途漫长
I have journeyed farther.

1148
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:27,720
我没有保留付出所有，但在心里
I am everything I've learned and more. Still it calls me.

1149
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,820
我听到有个声音悄悄在
And the call isn't out there at all.

1150
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:33,840
呼唤我
It's inside me.

1151
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:40,730
像潮水涨退循环的交替
It's like the tide always falling and rising.

1152
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,540
我回把你收藏在心底
I will carry you here in my heart.

1153
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,680
给我提醒
You remind me.

1154
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,900
路有多难
That come what may.

1155
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:53,070
勇敢面对
I know the way!

1156
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:57,640
我是莫阿娜
I AM MOANA!

1157
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:34,620
我是莫图鲁尼岛的莫阿娜
I am Moana of Motunui.

1158
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:39,420
快上船，我要带你跨越整片大海
Aboard my boat, I will sail across the sea.

1159
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,480
归还特菲提之心
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

1160
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,060
恶卡不可能下到水里
Te Ka can't follow us into the water.

1161
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:23,850
我们可以穿过障壁岛
We'll make it pass the barrier islands.

1162
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,050
然后抵达特菲提
We'll make it to Te Fiti.

1163
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:27,940
可惜你什么都听不懂
None of which you understand.

1164
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,540
因为你只是一只鸡
Because you are a chicken.

1165
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:36,970
不
No!

1166
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,870
憨憨
Hei-hei!

1167
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,460
不
No, no, no, no, no!

1168
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:42,940
干得漂亮
Nice work!

1169
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:53,860
特菲提
Te Fiti!

1170
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,070
毛伊
Maui!

1171
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:25,850
你回来了
You came back.

1172
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:30,810
但你的鱼钩
But your hook.

1173
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,850
再被击中一次就
One more hit, and ...

1174
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,210
恶卡得先抓到我才行
Te Ka's gotta catch me first.

1175
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:39,670
我来掩护你，小英雄
I got your back, chosen one.

1176
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:41,810
去拯救世界吧
Go, save the world.

1177
01:25:42,230 --> 01:25:42,730
毛伊
Maui.

1178
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,500
谢谢你
Thank you.

1179
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:46,530
不用谢
You're welcome.

1180
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,540
嘿，恶卡
Hey... Te Ka!

1181
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:23,990
鲨鱼头
Shark head.

1182
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,720
莫阿娜
Moana!

1183
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,630
把那颗心放进漩涡里
Get the heart to the spiral!

1184
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:28,960
特菲提
Te Fiti.

1185
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:31,160
特菲提消失了
It's gone.

1186
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:46,260
恶卡
TE KA!!

1187
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,180
让她过来吧
Let her come to me.

1188
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:50,710
走过千山与万水追寻你
I have crossed the horizon to find you.

1189
01:28:57,130 --> 01:28:59,750
我了解你
I know your name.

1190
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:08,280
他们偷走你心底的自己
They have stolen the heart from inside you.

1191
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:15,010
却不能够定义你
But this does not define you.

1192
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,370
这不是真的你
This is not who you are.

1193
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:29,980
你是谁，你决定
You know who you are...

1194
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,540
谁才是真正的你
Who you trully are.

1195
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,480
特菲提
Te Fiti.

1196
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:34,950
小笨鸡还活着呢
The chicken lives.

1197
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,920
很抱歉毁了你的鱼钩
I'm sorry about your hook.

1198
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:44,280
其实，不管有没有鱼钩，我都是毛伊
Well, hook, no hook, I'm Maui.

1199
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,200
特菲提
Te Fiti!

1200
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:08,890
你最近好吗？
How you've been?

1201
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,720
好吧，都是我的错
Look, what I did was wrong.

1202
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:17,260
我真的很抱歉
I have no excuse.

1203
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:19,560
对不起
I'm sorry.

1204
01:31:28,610 --> 01:31:31,460
要知道拒绝女神给的礼物可不礼貌
You know, it'd be rude to refuse a gift from a Goddess.

1205
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:37,960
谢谢
Thank you.

1206
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:40,560
你的宽宏大量让我不胜感激
Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.

1207
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:31,770
我会想你的，小笨鸡
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1208
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,470
你可以跟我们一起走
You could come with us, you know.

1209
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:37,490
我的族人们需要寻路高手的指点
My people are going to need a master wayfinder.

1210
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:40,460
他们已经有一位了
They already have one.

1211
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:00,780
那就再见了，毛伊
See you out there, Maui.

1212
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,610
那就再见吧，莫阿娜
See you out there, Moana...

1213
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,420
妈妈，爸爸
Mom! Dad!

1214
01:33:58,700 --> 01:33:59,750
莫阿娜
Moana!

1215
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:12,390
我可能离家稍微远了点
I may have gone a little ways past the reef.

1216
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:15,210
这才是你
It suits you.

1217
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,500
- 她回来了  - 莫阿娜
- She's back!  - Moana!

1218
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,100
胖胖
Pua!

1219
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:22,760
莫阿娜
Moana!

1220
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:17,590
定好了目的地
We set a course to find...

1221
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:22,480
每一次出行找寻新天地
A brand new island everywhere we roam.

1222
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:27,100
家乡的模样放心里
We keep our island in our mind.

1223
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:32,270
时间到了就回家，千山万水
And when it's time to find home, We know the way

1224
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:36,830
我们去探索每一个符号
Aue, Aue. We are explorers reading every sign.

1225
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:41,770
这里有我们的祖先，古老的故事与传承
We tell the stories of our elders in a never ending chain.

1226
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:54,240
千山万水
We know the way....

1227
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:59,940
海洋奇缘

1228
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:03,940
