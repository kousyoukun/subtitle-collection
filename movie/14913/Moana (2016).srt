13
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:53,244
In the beginning.

14
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,663
There was only ocean.

15
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,609
Until the "Mother Island" emerged.

16
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:02,271
Te Fiti.

17
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,035
Her heart held the greatest
power ever known.

18
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:09,930
It could create life itself!

19
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:14,191
And Te Fiti share it with the world.

20
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:21,246
But in time, some began to seek
Te Fiti's heart.

21
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:23,770
They believed if they could possess it.

22
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,032
The great power of
creation would be theirs.

23
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,408
And one day...

24
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:33,185
The most daring of them all...

25
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:37,379
Voyaged across the vast
ocean to take it.

26
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,771
He was the demigod of the wind and sea.

27
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:46,721
He was a warrior ...

28
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:49,476
A trickster!

29
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,645
A shape shifter who could change form.

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,710
With the power of his magical fish hook.

31
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:03,856
And his name was Maui!

32
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:15,415
But without her heart.

33
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:17,684
Te Fiti began to crumble.

34
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,130
Giving birth to a terrible darkness.

35
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:41,371
Maui tried to escape.

36
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:44,910
But was confronted by another,
who sought the heart.

37
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:51,984
Te Ka! A demon of Earth and Fire.

38
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,698
Maui was struck from the sky!

39
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:05,865
Never to be seen again.

40
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,981
And his magical fish hook ...

41
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:14,654
And the heart of Te Fiti,
were lost to the sea.

42
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:19,016
Where even now, a thousand years later.

43
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:23,966
Te Ka and the demons of the deep
still hunt for the heart.

44
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:28,356
Hiding in a darkness that
will continue to spread...

45
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,722
Chasing away our fish!

46
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,330
Draining the life from island after island!

47
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:36,501
Until every one of us.

48
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,720
Is devoured by the blood-thirsty jaws.

49
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,658
Of inescapable death!

50
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:50,238
But one day...

51
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:52,388
The heart will be found.

52
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:55,772
By someone who would
journey beyond our reef.

53
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,227
Find Maui.

54
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:59,450
Deliver him across
the great ocean...

55
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,833
To restore Te Fiti's heart.

56
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:03,674
And save us all.

57
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,265
Thank you mother, that's enough.

58
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:07,187
Papa...

59
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:09,376
No one goes outside the reef.

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,836
We are safe here!

61
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:14,459
There is no darkness.
There are no monsters.

62
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:19,463
- Monster! Monster! Monster!
- There's no monster... no monsters!

63
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,033
It's the darkness!

64
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,046
No, there is nothing beyond
our reef but storms!

65
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,103
- And rough seas!
- I gotta throw up!

66
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:29,090
As long as we stay on our very safe island.

67
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,161
We'll be fine!

68
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:31,646
The legends are true.

69
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:33,498
Someone will have to go!

70
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,198
Mother...

71
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,344
Motunui is paradise!

72
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,382
Who would want to go anywhere else?

73
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,097
Moana!

74
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,590
There you are Moana, what are you doing?
You scared me!

75
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:19,048
But I want us to go back.

76
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:20,106
I know, I know...

77
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:22,044
But you don't go out there.

78
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:23,809
It's dangerous.

79
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,342
Moana, come on...

80
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,463
Let's go back to the village.

81
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:34,251
You are the next great
chief of our people.

82
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:37,275
And you do wonderous
things, my little Minnow.

83
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:38,709
Oh yes, but first...

84
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:41,728
You must learn where you're meant to be.

85
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:55,040
Moana...

86
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:58,231
Make way .. Make way.

87
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,284
Moana, it's time you knew.

88
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:04,346
The village of Motunui is all you need.

89
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,449
The dancers are practicing

90
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,649
They dance to an ancient song.

91
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:12,033
Who needs a new song?
This old one's all we need

92
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,087
This tradition is our mission.

93
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,517
And Moana there's so much to do.

94
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:20,628
Don't trip on the taro root.
That's all you need.

95
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:22,582
We share everything we make.

96
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:24,867
We joke and we weave our baskets.

97
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,417
The fishermen come back from the sea.

98
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:30,688
- I wanna see.
- Don't walk away.

99
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,083
Moana stay on the ground now.

100
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:37,066
Our people will need a
chief and there you are...

101
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,759
There comes a day.

102
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,077
When you're gonna look around.

103
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:45,298
And realize happiness
is where you are.

104
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,995
Consider the coconut!

105
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:49,465
Consider it's tree...

106
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,948
We use each part of the coconut.

107
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:53,161
That's all we need.

108
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:55,583
We make our nets from the fibers.

109
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:57,471
The water is sweet inside.

110
00:08:57,642 --> 00:08:59,530
We use the leaves
to build fires.

111
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:01,334
We cook up the meat inside.

112
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:03,318
Consider the coconuts!

113
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:05,741
The trunks and the leaves!

114
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:08,194
The island gives us what we need.

115
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:11,318
- And no one leaves.
- That's right we stay.

116
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,758
We're safe and we're well provided.

117
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:15,710
And when we look to the future...

118
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,867
There you are.

119
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:19,573
You'll be okay.

120
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:21,916
In time you'll learn just as I did.

121
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:27,188
You must find happiness right
where you are!

122
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,243
I like to dance with the water.

123
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,307
The undertow and the waves.

124
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:38,231
The water is mischievous, ha!

125
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:40,260
I like how it misbehaves.

126
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,721
The village may think I'm crazy.

127
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,529
Or say that I drift too far.

128
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:49,711
But once you know what you like.
Well, there you are.

129
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:53,158
You are your father's daughter.

130
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,341
Stubbornness and pride.

131
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:57,602
Mind what he says, but remember.

132
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,678
You may hear a voice inside..

133
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,929
And if the voice starts to whisper.

134
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:03,935
To follow the farthest star.

135
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,580
Moana, that voice inside
is who you are....

136
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:12,463
Dad!

137
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:14,516
I was only looking at the boats.

138
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:16,261
I wasn't gonna get on them.

139
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:20,856
Come on.

140
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:22,957
There's something I
need to show you.

141
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:28,976
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

142
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,579
This is a sacred place.

143
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:33,501
A place of Chiefs.

144
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:35,485
There will come a time

145
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:38,462
When you will stand on
this peak and place...

146
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:40,685
A stone on this mountain.

147
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:42,018
Like I did.

148
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,594
Like my father did.

149
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,300
And his father and every chief
that has ever been.

150
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:49,659
And on that day...

151
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,062
When you're at your stone.

152
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:55,647
You will raise this whole
island higher.

153
00:10:56,537 --> 00:10:58,636
You are the future of
our people, Moana.

154
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,932
And they are not out there.

155
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:03,884
There are right here.

156
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,570
It's time to be who they need you to be.

157
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:11,784
- We make our nets from the fibers.
- We weave our nets from the fibers

158
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:13,730
- The water is sweet inside.
- The real taste of tree's inside.

159
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,722
- We use the leaves to build fires.
- We sing these songs in our choirs.

160
00:11:16,012 --> 00:11:17,784
- And cook up the meat inside.
- We have mouths to feed inside.

161
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:20,089
- The village believe in us.
- That's right!

162
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:22,092
The village believe!

163
00:11:22,144 --> 00:11:24,373
The island gives us what we need.

164
00:11:24,398 --> 00:11:27,799
And no one leaves!
So here I'll stay.

165
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:30,009
My home, my people beside me.

166
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:32,071
And when I think of tomorrow.

167
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:34,310
There we are.

168
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:35,869
I lead the way.

169
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:38,212
I'll have my people to guide me.

170
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:40,355
We'll build our future together.

171
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:42,330
Where we are.

172
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:44,275
'Cause every path leads you back to.

173
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,510
Where you are.

174
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:50,089
- You can find happiness right...
- Where you are

175
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:53,674
Where you are....

176
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,729
Every storm, this roof leaks
no matter how many fronds I add.

177
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,480
Fixed!

178
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:02,961
Knot the fronds!

179
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,044
Wind shifted the post.

180
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:09,631
That's good pork!

181
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:13,736
Oh, I mean...

182
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:14,620
No, I wasn't ...

183
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:17,512
What? They're calling me! So I gotta...

184
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:18,578
Bye!

185
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:22,997
You're doing great.

186
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:24,300
Is it done yet?

187
00:12:26,557 --> 00:12:27,724
So close.

188
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,330
I'm curious about that chicken.

189
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:45,646
Eating the rock!

190
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:48,960
I think he seems to lack the
basic intelligence required for

191
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,756
Pretty much everything.

192
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,432
Should we maybe just...

193
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,750
Cook him?

194
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:57,749
Sometimes our strengths
 lie beneath the surface

195
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:00,749
Far beneath

196
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:02,274
In some cases.

197
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,482
But I'm sure there's more to
Hei-hei than meets the eye!

198
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:13,960
It's the harvest.

199
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:17,045
This morning I was
husking the coconuts and ...

200
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:24,681
Well...

201
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,154
We should clear the diseased trees.

202
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:29,712
And we will start a new grove

203
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,289
There!

204
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,873
Thanks, Moana.

205
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:36,743
She's doing great!

206
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,596
This suits you.

207
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:43,459
Chief!

208
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,358
There's something you need to see.

209
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,907
Our traps in the east lagoon.

210
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:50,893
They're pulling out less and less fish.

211
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:54,023
Then we'll rotate
the fishing grounds.

212
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:56,098
We have. There's no fish.

213
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:59,777
Then we'll fish the far side of the island.

214
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:00,595
We tried.

215
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,346
The windward side?

216
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,545
And the leeward side.

217
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:04,854
The shallows, the channel.

218
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,732
We've tried the whole lagoon!

219
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,005
They're just... gone.

220
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,524
Well, have you tried using
a different bait?

221
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,154
I don't think it's the bait.

222
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:21,495
I will talk to the counselor.

223
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:22,873
- I'm sure we ca...
- What if...

224
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,484
We fished beyond the reef!

225
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,260
No one goes beyond the reef.

226
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:31,059
I know! But if there are no fish in the lagoon...

227
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,814
- Moana!
- And there's a whole ocean...

228
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,432
We have one rule!

229
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:36,128
An old rule when there were fish!

230
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,843
A rule that keeps us safe!

231
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:39,881
- But dad...
- Instead of endangering our people

232
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:41,741
So you can run right back to the water!

233
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,744
Every time, I think
you're past this.

234
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,146
No one goes beyond the reef!

235
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:05,464
Well, it's not like you said it in
front of your dad

236
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:08,004
Standing on a boat.

237
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:11,209
I didn't say go beyond the reef.

238
00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:13,324
Because I want to be on the ocean.

239
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:14,898
But you still do.

240
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,216
- He's hard on you, because...
- Because he doesn't get me.

241
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,707
Because he was you.

242
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,356
Drawn to the ocean.

243
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,074
Down by the shore.

244
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:28,578
He took a canoe, Moana.

245
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:30,761
He crossed the reef.

246
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:33,861
And found an unforgiving sea.

247
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:36,389
Waves like mountains.

248
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,824
His best friend begged
to be on that boat.

249
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,218
Your dad couldn't save him.

250
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,487
He's hoping he can save you.

251
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:52,883
Sometimes, who we wish we were

252
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,244
What we wish we could do

253
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:59,117
It's just not meant to be.

254
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:17,497
Okay, Pua.

255
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:19,089
I can do this.

256
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:23,165
There's more fish
beyond the reef.

257
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:26,610
There's more beyond the reef.

258
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:36,351
Not so bad!

259
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,630
Pua!

260
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:40,034
Whatever just happened.

261
00:17:40,922 --> 00:17:41,987
Blame it on the pig!

262
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
Grandma!

263
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,162
Are you gonna tell dad.

264
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:51,371
I'm his mom.

265
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:53,786
I don't have to tell him anything.

266
00:17:57,655 --> 00:17:58,290
He was right.

267
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,875
About going out there.

268
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:06,464
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.

269
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:09,786
Okay!

270
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,878
Well, then head on back

271
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,587
Put that stone up there.

272
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:21,529
Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it?

273
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:23,378
You said that's what you wanted.

274
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:25,810
It is.

275
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:31,196
When I die.

276
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:35,212
I'm going to come back as one of these.

277
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,454
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

278
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,655
Why you're acting weird?

279
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,923
I'm the village crazy, lady.

280
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,406
That's my job.

281
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:46,722
If there's something you
want to tell me.

282
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:47,824
Just tell me.

283
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,607
Is there something you
want to tell me?

284
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:55,047
Is there something you want to hear?

285
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,185
You've been told all our people stories.

286
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:04,953
But one.

287
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,893
What is this place?

288
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:12,574
Do you really think our
ancestors stayed within the reef?

289
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:25,420
What's in there?

290
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:27,015
The answer.

291
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,340
To the question you
keep asking yourself.

292
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,329
Who are you meant to be.

293
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:37,969
Go inside.

294
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:39,967
Bang the drum.

295
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:42,362
And find out.

296
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,625
Bang the drum.

297
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:48,173
<i>Tatou o Tagata Folau</i>
(We read the wind and the sky)

298
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:49,915
<i>E vala’auina.</i>

(We know the way)

310
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:27,565
We read the wind and sky.

311
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:29,134
When the sun is high.

312
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:33,952
We sail the length of the seas on
the ocean breeze.

313
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:39,461
At night we name every star.
We know where we are.

314
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:41,732
We know who we are.

315
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:43,981
Who we are.

316
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:46,450
Aue, Aue...

317
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:48,583
We set a course to find.

318
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:53,684
A brand new island everywhere we roam.

319
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:55,704
Aue, Aue....

320
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,510
We keep our island in our mind.

00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,969
And when it's time to find home.

322

We know the way.

Aue, Aue....

324
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:08,081
We are explorers
reading every sign.

325
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:11,226
We tell the stories of our elders.

326
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:14,619
In a never ending chain.

327
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:18,074
Te fenua, te malie.

328

We know the way!

329
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:30,737
We were voyagers.

00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:40,657
We were voyagers!

331
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:41,622
Why'd we stop?

332
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:44,251
Maui!

333
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,361
When he stole from the Mother Island.

334
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:48,919
Darkness fell.

335
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:50,842
Te Ka awoke.

336
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,437
Monsters lurked and boats
stopped coming back.

337
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:58,108
To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs

338
00:23:58,144 --> 00:23:59,266
Forbid voyaging.

339
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:02,686
And now we have forgotten
who we are.

340
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:07,068
And the darkness has continued to spread.

341
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:09,784
Chasing away our fish.

342
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,627
Draining the life

343
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:15,384
From island after island.

344
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,186
Our island

345
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:22,936
But one day

346
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:26,020
Someone will journey beyond our reef.

347
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:27,329
Find Maui.

348
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,442
Deliver him across the great ocean.

349
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:35,197
To restore the heart of Te Fiti.

350
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:39,312
I was there that day.

351
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,217
The ocean chose you!

352
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:53,636
I thought it was a dream.

353
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,621
Nope!

354
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:05,858
Our ancestors believed, Maui lies there.

355
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:07,456
At the bottom of his hook.

356
00:25:08,397 --> 00:25:11,078
Follow it, and you will find him.

357
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:11,855
But...

358
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,181
Why would it choose me?

359
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,850
I don't even know how
to make it pass the reef.

360
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:20,250
But I know who does.

361
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:31,515
The crops are turning black!

362
00:25:31,684 --> 00:25:32,567
What about the fish?

363
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:34,114
- This is happening all over the island.
- Please. please.

364
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:35,235
- Settle down!
- What are you going to do?

365
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,306
We will dig new fields.

366
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:38,466
- We will find a way to...
- We can stop the darkness!

367
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:39,998
Save our island!

368
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:41,642
There's a cavern boats!

369
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:43,387
Huge canoes!

370
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,377
We can take them, find Maui

371
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:46,834
Make him restore
the heart.

372
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,704
We were voyagers.

373
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,337
We can voyage again!

374
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,628
You told me to help our people.

375
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:57,779
This is how we help our people!

376
00:25:58,663 --> 00:25:59,594
Dad?

377
00:25:59,614 --> 00:26:00,648
What are you doing?

378
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,353
I should've burned those
boats a long time ago!

379
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:04,266
No! Don't!

380
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,719
We have to find Maui.

381
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:07,142
We have to restore the heart.

382
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:08,533
There is no heart!

383
00:26:08,765 --> 00:26:10,829
This...this is just a rock!

384
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:11,628
No!

385
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:25,456
Chief!

386
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,061
It's your mother!

387
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:38,153
Mother.

388
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:55,780
What can be done?

389
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,570
Go.

390
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:04,783
Grandma.

391
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:08,969
Go.

392
00:27:09,848 --> 00:27:10,647
Not now.

393
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:11,957
I can't.

394
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:13,533
You must!

395
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:16,760
The ocean chose you!

396
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,487
- Follow the fish hook.
- Grandma.

397
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,058
And when you find Maui.

398
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,762
You grab him by the ear!

399
00:27:25,473 --> 00:27:26,104
You say...

400
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:29,642
I am Moana of Motunui!

401
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:32,346
You will board my boat!

402
00:27:32,937 --> 00:27:34,446
Sail across the sea!

403
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:38,328
And restore the heart of Te Fiti!

404
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,102
I... I can't leave you.

405
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:48,484
There is no way you could go,
that I won't be with you.

406
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:02,471
Go!

407
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:20,207
There's a line where the sky meet the sea.
And he calls me.

408
00:28:20,406 --> 00:28:23,100
But no one knows.

409
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:26,335
How far it goes.

410
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:31,646
All time wondering where
I need to be is behind me.

411
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:34,757
I'm on my own

412
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,261
Towards unknown!

413
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,442
Every turn I take.
Every trail I track.

414
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:44,170
It's a choise I make.
Now I can't turn back.

415
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,739
From a great unknown.

416
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:50,354
Where I go alone.
Where I long to be.

417
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:04,285
See her light of the night.
in the sea, she calls me.

418
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:07,008
And yes, I know.

419
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:10,457
That I can go.

420
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:15,675
There's a moon in the sky and the
wind is behind me.

421
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:18,286
So now I'll know.

422
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,380
How far I'll go!

423
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:43,741
I am Moana Motunui.

424
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:45,223
You will board my boat.

425
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,941
Sail across the sea!

426
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:49,338
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

427
00:29:49,508 --> 00:29:50,857
I am Moana.

428
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:56,298
Of Motu... nui.

429
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:09,376
Hei-hei?!

430
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:32,987
It's okay.

431
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,519
You're alright.

432
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:35,916
See?

433
00:30:36,987 --> 00:30:37,913
There we go.

434
00:30:38,282 --> 00:30:39,863
Nice water.

435
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,312
The ocean is a friend of mine.

436
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:46,766
Hei-hei?

437
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,096
Hei-hei!

438
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:05,081
Stay!

439
00:31:10,196 --> 00:31:10,678
Okay.

440
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:11,879
Next stop.

441
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,039
Maui.

442
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:23,806
I am Moana of Motunui.

443
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:26,554
You will board my boat.

444
00:31:27,693 --> 00:31:30,563
Sail across the sea.

445
00:31:31,187 --> 00:31:33,120
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

446
00:31:34,188 --> 00:31:38,325
I am Moana... of .. Mo..tu....

447
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:40,292
Board my boat!

448
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:44,225
Oh, no!

449
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:52,393
No ... no... no...no!

450
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:52,920
No!

451
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:05,876
Ocean?

452
00:32:06,596 --> 00:32:09,596
Can I get a little help?

453
00:32:12,706 --> 00:32:13,522
No... no.

454
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:15,950
Please.

455
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:17,464
Come on!

456
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:29,907
Help me!

457
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:31,292
Please!

458
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:17,635
What?!

459
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:20,028
I said help me!

460
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:22,344
And wrecking my boat?!

461
00:33:22,787 --> 00:33:24,273
Not helping!

462
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:28,619
Fish pee in you... all day!

463
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:29,865
So...

464
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:45,351
Maui?

465
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,251
Maui!

466
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,549
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea

467
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:01,755
I am Moana of Motunui!

468
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,227
You will board my boat!

469
00:34:03,296 --> 00:34:03,710
No!

470
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:05,518
You will board my boat!

471
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,028
Yeah!

472
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:08,301
Hi, I'm Moana of Motunui.

473
00:34:08,585 --> 00:34:11,774
- You will board my...
- Boat!

474
00:34:12,392 --> 00:34:13,392
A boat!

475
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:16,950
The Gods have given me a...

476
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:31,159
Maui

477
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:32,381
Shape shifter.

478
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:34,462
Demigod of the wind and sea.

479
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,809
- I am Moana of Mo...
- Hero of Men.

480
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:37,686
Wha..What?

481
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,393
It's actually Maui, shape shifter.

482
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:40,838
Demigod of the wind and sea!

483
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:42,084
Hero of Men.

484
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:44,906
I interupted. From the top.
Hero of Men.

485
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:45,368
Go!

486
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:49,697
- I am Mo...
- Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry.

487
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:50,757
And women.

488
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,047
Men and women. Both! All!

489
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:54,973
Not a guy-girl thing.

490
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,990
You know? Maui
is a hero to all!

491
00:34:57,086 --> 00:34:57,795
You're doing great.

492
00:34:58,445 --> 00:34:58,881
What?

493
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,494
- No! I came here to ...
- Of course, of course.

494
00:35:01,545 --> 00:35:02,748
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

495
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:05,185
Maui always has time
for his fans.

496
00:35:07,075 --> 00:35:09,014
When you use a bird to write with

497
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:12,052
It's called "tweeting".

498
00:35:14,928 --> 00:35:17,675
I know, not every day, you get a
chance to meet your hero.

499
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,884
You are not my hero!

500
00:35:21,093 --> 00:35:23,712
And I'm not here so you
can sign my oar!

501
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:25,990
I'm here because you stole
the heart of Te Fiti!

502
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:28,390
And you will board my boat.

503
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:31,480
Sail across the sea and put it back!

504
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:34,107
Yeah.

505
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,196
It almost sounded like you
don't like me.

506
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:38,686
Which is impossible
because I got stuck here.

507
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:40,818
For a thousand years,
trying to get the heart...

508
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:42,560
As a gift for you, mortals...

509
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:46,001
So you could have the power
to create life itself!

510
00:35:46,363 --> 00:35:49,130
Yeah, so what I believe
you're trying to say.

511
00:35:49,702 --> 00:35:51,386
- Is thank you.
- Thank you?

512
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:53,309
- You're welcome.
- What? No, no, no.

513
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:54,812
I .. I didn't ...
I wasn't ...

514
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:57,528
- Why would I ever say... I mean...
- Okay, okay, okay...

515
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:00,141
I see what's happening, yeah.

516
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:03,749
You're face to face with
greatness and it's strange.

517
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:06,407
You don't even know
how you feel.

518
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:07,887
It's adorable!

519
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:10,944
Well, it's nice to see that humans
never change.

520
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:14,517
Open your eyes let's begin.

521
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:17,459
Yes, it's really me, It's Maui.
Breathe it in.

522
00:36:18,185 --> 00:36:21,692
I know it's a lot the hair, the bod!

523
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:24,605
When you're staring at a Demigod

524
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:26,883
What can I say?

525
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,071
Except you're welcome.

526
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:32,244
For the tides, the sun, the sky.

527
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:36,161
Hey, it's okay. It is okay.
You're welcome.

528
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,595
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy, Hey!

529
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:42,889
Hey, what has two thumbs
and pulled up the sky.

530
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:45,949
When you were waddling yay high.
This guy!

531
00:36:46,234 --> 00:36:48,081
When the nights got cold.

532
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,789
Who stole you fire from down below?

533
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:52,478
You're looking at him, yo!

534
00:36:53,005 --> 00:36:56,980
Oh, also I lasso'd the sun.

535
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,001
You're welcome.

536
00:36:58,188 --> 00:37:00,600
To stretch your days and bring you fun.

537
00:37:00,814 --> 00:37:04,290
Also I harnessed the breeze.

538
00:37:04,344 --> 00:37:07,520
You're welcome, to fill your sails
and shake your trees.

539
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:11,566
So what can I say except
You're welcome.

540
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:14,765
For the islands I pulled from the sea.

541
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:18,664
There's no need to pray, it's okay.
You're welcome.

542
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,007
I guess it's just my way of being me.

543
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,207
You're welcome.

544
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:26,016
You're welcome.

545
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,302
Well, come to think of it.

546
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,368
Kid, honestly I can go on and on.

547
00:37:30,402 --> 00:37:32,190
I can explain every natural phenomenon.

548
00:37:32,426 --> 00:37:33,736
The tide, the grass,  the ground.

549
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,538
Oh... that was Maui just messing around.

550
00:37:35,572 --> 00:37:37,301
I killed an eel, I
buried its guts.

551
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,051
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts.

552
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,037
What's the lesson?

553
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:41,030
What is the takeaway.

554
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:42,793
Don't mess with Maui when he's
on the breakaway.

555
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,446
And the tapestry here in my skin.

556
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:46,067
Is a map of the victories I win.

557
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:48,033
Look where I've been, I
make everything happen.

558
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:50,005
Look at that mean mini Maui just
tikitty tappin'

559
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:57,754
Well anyway, let me say,
You're welcome

560
00:37:58,156 --> 00:38:00,781
For the wonderful world you know.

561
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,769
Hey, it's okay... it's okay.
You're welcome

562
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:07,891
Well, come to think of
it, I gotta go.

563
00:38:08,493 --> 00:38:12,137
Hey, it's your day to say
You're welcome.

564
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:15,066
Cause I'm gonna need that boat.

565
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:19,253
I'm sailing away... away.
You're welcome.

566
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,293
Cause Maui can do
everything but float.

567
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:24,549
You're welcome.

568
00:38:24,924 --> 00:38:26,778
You're welcome.

569
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:28,846
And thank you!

570
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:32,044
Hey, let me out!

571
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:35,486
You lying, slimy, son of a...

572
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,209
You're welcome.

573
00:38:46,843 --> 00:38:47,388
No!

574
00:38:47,648 --> 00:38:49,479
I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

575
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:50,454
I'm gonna get my hook.

576
00:38:50,477 --> 00:38:52,752
You have yours. And I'm not Maui
without mine.

577
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,173
Okay, talk to the back.

578
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:02,532
Boat snack!

579
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:32,956
Good riddance you filthy pile of pebbles!

580
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:33,987
Oh, no, no, no.

581
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:35,403
Don't look at me like that.

582
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:37,550
It's a beautiful cave, she's gonna love it.

583
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,135
And I'm going to love you.

584
00:39:40,742 --> 00:39:41,847
In my belly.

585
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,410
Now let's fatten you up, drumstick!

586
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:09,277
I could watch that all day.

587
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:11,579
Okay, enjoy the island!

588
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,665
- Maui, out!
- No!

589
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,476
Stop!

590
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,511
Hey! You have to put
back the heart!

591
00:40:33,423 --> 00:40:35,135
Did not see that coming.

592
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:40,089
I am Moana of Motunui.

593
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,557
This is my canoe.

594
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,714
And you will journey to...

595
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:48,356
Alright, get over it.
We gotta move.

596
00:40:50,726 --> 00:40:51,890
And she's back.

597
00:40:51,912 --> 00:40:54,690
I am Moana of Motunu...

598
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,865
- It was Moana, right?
- Yes.

599
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:04,610
And you will restore the heart.

600
00:41:15,928 --> 00:41:17,928
Alright, I'm out.

601
00:41:22,388 --> 00:41:23,471
Oh, come on!

602
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:26,010
What is your problem?

603
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:30,479
- Are you afraid of it?
- No.

604
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:33,111
No. I'm not afraid...

605
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:38,814
Stay out of it or you're
sleeping in my armpit.

606
00:41:39,001 --> 00:41:41,286
You stop it.
That is not a heart.

607
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:43,531
It is a curse. The second I took it

608
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,377
I got blasted out of the sky

609
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,409
And I lost my hook!

610
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:47,991
Get it away from me.

611
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,813
Get this away?

612
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:52,010
I'm Demigod, okay?

613
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:53,612
Stop that!
I will smite you!

614
00:41:53,798 --> 00:41:55,176
You wannna get "smote"?

615
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:57,429
"Smoten"?

616
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:00,193
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life.

617
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,092
It's a homing beacon of death.

618
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:04,558
If you don't put it away, bad things
are gonna come for it.

619
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:06,843
Come for this? The heart?

620
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,966
You mean this heart right here!

621
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:10,633
Come and get it!

622
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:11,995
You are gonna get us killed.

623
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:14,211
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti.

624
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,567
So you can put it back.

625
00:42:15,845 --> 00:42:16,372
Thank you.

626
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:17,839
You're welcome.

627
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:24,422
Kakamora.

628
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:25,457
Kaka... what?

629
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,132
Murdering little pirates.

630
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:30,239
Wonder what they're here for?

631
00:42:35,457 --> 00:42:37,600
They're kind of cute.

632
00:42:55,347 --> 00:42:58,095
Ocean do something, help us!

633
00:42:58,531 --> 00:43:00,606
The ocean doesn't help you.
You help yourself!

634
00:43:01,066 --> 00:43:03,066
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

635
00:43:04,274 --> 00:43:05,566
You can't sail?!

636
00:43:05,731 --> 00:43:06,987
I...

637
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,620
I am self taught?

638
00:43:20,543 --> 00:43:22,516
Can't you shape shift
or something?!

639
00:43:22,544 --> 00:43:23,423
Do you see my hook?

640
00:43:23,593 --> 00:43:25,441
No magic hook, no magic powers.

641
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:53,085
Their boat is turning into more boats!

642
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:14,877
Yup! I just did that.

643
00:44:20,843 --> 00:44:22,051
No, no, no, no!

644
00:44:23,149 --> 00:44:25,149
Hei-hei!

645
00:44:38,265 --> 00:44:40,499
Maui! They took the heart!

646
00:44:43,168 --> 00:44:43,968
That a chicken.

647
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,317
The heart is in the...

648
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:47,756
We have to get him back!

649
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:53,851
Maui!

650
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:10,132
There! Right there!

651
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:12,695
You're turning?!
What are you doing?!

652
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:14,125
Escaping.

653
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:17,015
- The heart!
- Forget it, you'll never get it back.

654
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:19,286
Beside, we got a better one.

655
00:45:19,805 --> 00:45:20,276
Hey!

656
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:22,175
What do I gonna steer with?!

657
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,513
They're just gonna kill you!

658
00:45:28,787 --> 00:45:29,660
Coconuts.

659
00:46:12,988 --> 00:46:14,033
Got it!

660
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:18,642
Hey!

661
00:46:34,671 --> 00:46:35,178
Yeah!

662
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,683
We did it!

663
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:41,279
Congratulations, on not being dead, curly.

664
00:46:41,477 --> 00:46:42,288
You surprise me.

665
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:45,258
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

666
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:47,662
You wanna get to Te Fiti.

667
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:50,032
You gotta go through
a whole ocean of bad.

668
00:46:50,123 --> 00:46:51,361
Not to mention Te Ka.

669
00:46:52,773 --> 00:46:53,812
Lava monster?

670
00:46:54,755 --> 00:46:56,218
Ever defeat a lava monster?

671
00:46:56,994 --> 00:46:57,994
No.

672
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,525
Have you?

673
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:10,233
I'm not going on a
suicide mission with some mortal.

674
00:47:10,623 --> 00:47:12,800
You can't restore the heart
without me.

675
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:14,711
And me says no.

676
00:47:16,164 --> 00:47:18,164
I'm getting my hook.

677
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,692
End of discussion.

678
00:47:26,841 --> 00:47:28,321
You'd be a hero.

679
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:32,976
That's what you're all about, right?

680
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:35,983
Little girl, I am a hero.

681
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:38,368
Maybe you were but now...

682
00:47:38,886 --> 00:47:41,753
Now you're just the guy who
stole the heart of Te Fiti.

683
00:47:42,081 --> 00:47:43,891
The guy who cursed the world!

684
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:47,279
You're no one's hero.

685
00:47:47,982 --> 00:47:49,982
No one?

686
00:47:58,484 --> 00:48:01,047
But, put this back.

687
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:03,076
Save the world.

688
00:48:03,478 --> 00:48:05,633
You'd be everyone's hero.

689
00:48:10,368 --> 00:48:14,121
Maui! Maui! Maui!

690
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,678
You're so amazing!

691
00:48:16,256 --> 00:48:17,458
We'd never make it without my hook.

692
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:19,137
Not pass Te Ka.

693
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,066
Then we get your hook.

694
00:48:20,387 --> 00:48:22,320
We get you hook, take out Te Ka.

695
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,286
Restore the heart.

696
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:26,324
Unless you don't wanna be

697
00:48:26,908 --> 00:48:33,139
Maui, Demigod of the Wind and
Sea, Hero to all

698
00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:38,458
First, we get my hook.

699
00:48:38,935 --> 00:48:40,148
Then save the world.

700
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,424
Deal?

701
00:48:41,977 --> 00:48:42,578
Deal.

702
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:48,124
Worth a shot.

703
00:48:48,913 --> 00:48:51,108
Okay, we go east.

704
00:48:51,743 --> 00:48:53,250
To the lair of Tamatoa.

705
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:58,414
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom feeder.

706
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:12,428
Teach me to sail.

707
00:49:14,961 --> 00:49:18,300
My job is to deliver
Maui across the great ocean.

708
00:49:18,775 --> 00:49:19,456
I should...

709
00:49:20,906 --> 00:49:22,751
I should be sailing.

710
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:25,216
It's called Wayfinding, Princess.

711
00:49:25,642 --> 00:49:27,597
And it's not just sails and knots.

712
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:30,528
 It's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

713
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:31,763
Knowing where you are.

714
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:34,099
By knowing where you've been.

715
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,932
Okay, first,
I'm not a princess.

716
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:38,627
I'm the daughter of the chief.

717
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:39,749
- Same difference.
- No.

718
00:49:39,766 --> 00:49:42,412
If you wear a dress, and you have an
animal sidekick.

719
00:49:42,724 --> 00:49:43,860
You're a Princess.

720
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:45,317
You're not a wayfinder.

721
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:46,927
You will never be a wayfinder.

722
00:49:46,979 --> 00:49:48,712
You will never be a way...

723
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:54,833
Really?

724
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:56,488
Blow dart in my butt cheek.

725
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:04,788
You are a bad person.

726
00:50:04,805 --> 00:50:06,245
If you can talk, you can teach.

727
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,580
Wayfinding.

728
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,419
Lesson one. Hit it!

729
00:50:13,224 --> 00:50:14,227
Pull the sheet.

730
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,149
Not the sheet.

731
00:50:16,804 --> 00:50:17,309
No.

732
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:18,227
Nope!

733
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:19,486
Nope!

734
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:20,728
No.

735
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,423
Tried that one already.

736
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,915
You're measuring the stars.

737
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:30,889
Not giving the sky a high five.

738
00:50:32,398 --> 00:50:34,995
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

739
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:38,234
It's cold.

740
00:50:38,862 --> 00:50:40,670
Wait, it's getting warmer.

741
00:50:42,627 --> 00:50:44,050
That is disgusting!

742
00:50:44,435 --> 00:50:45,438
What is wrong with you?!

743
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,206
We're here?

744
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,525
See? Told you I can do it!

745
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,181
Motunui.

746
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:18,687
I'm home?

747
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:23,636
Moana!

748
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:24,452
Dad?

749
00:51:25,276 --> 00:51:26,727
Moana!

750
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:27,889
Mom?

751
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:30,469
Help!

752
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:33,599
No!

753
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:35,010
Moana!

754
00:51:38,343 --> 00:51:39,443
Enjoying your beauty rest?

755
00:51:40,214 --> 00:51:42,649
You know, a real wayfinder, never sleeps.

756
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,367
So they actually get where they need to go.

757
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,494
Muscle up buttercup!

758
00:51:48,465 --> 00:51:50,465
We're here.

759
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,285
You sure this guy's gonna have your hook?

760
00:51:53,772 --> 00:51:56,048
Tamatoa? Oh, hell have it.

761
00:51:56,257 --> 00:51:57,362
He's a scavenger.

762
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,777
Collects stuff, things that makes
him look cool.

763
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:02,689
And for Tamatoa?

764
00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:06,123
Trust me, my hook
is the coolest collectible.

765
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:09,162
And he lives up there?

766
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:12,504
Oh, no, no, no...

767
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,974
That's just the entrance

768
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,454
To a Lalotai.

769
00:52:16,817 --> 00:52:17,514
Lalotai?

770
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,407
Realm of Monsters?!

771
00:52:20,626 --> 00:52:22,486
We're going to the Realm of Monsters?

772
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:23,382
We?

773
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:24,158
No.

774
00:52:24,371 --> 00:52:24,830
Me.

775
00:52:25,261 --> 00:52:27,828
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

776
00:52:30,492 --> 00:52:32,492
That's what I'm talking about,
give me some!

777
00:52:33,326 --> 00:52:35,837
Come on, that was a good one,
how do you not get it?

778
00:52:35,866 --> 00:52:37,990
I called her a chicken, there's
a chicken on the boat.

779
00:52:38,244 --> 00:52:40,931
I know she's human! But that's not the...
You know what? Forget it.

780
00:52:41,022 --> 00:52:42,749
Forget it! I'm not explaining it to you.

781
00:52:42,987 --> 00:52:44,677
'Cause then it's not funny.

782
00:52:58,756 --> 00:52:59,193
So...

783
00:52:59,445 --> 00:53:00,522
Daughter of the chief.

784
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:02,347
I thought you stayed in the village.

785
00:53:02,665 --> 00:53:04,341
You know, kissing babies and things.

786
00:53:05,344 --> 00:53:07,426
Hey, I'm just trying to understand

787
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:10,057
Why your people decided to send...

788
00:53:10,074 --> 00:53:11,260
How do I phrase this?

789
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:12,116
You!

790
00:53:12,124 --> 00:53:12,839
My people...

791
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:16,535
Didn't send me.
The ocean did.

792
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,184
The ocean? Makes sense!
You're what? Eight?

793
00:53:20,278 --> 00:53:20,985
Can't sail?

794
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,215
Obvious choice.

795
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,259
It chose me.

796
00:53:24,897 --> 00:53:25,963
For a reason.

797
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:27,760
If the ocean's so smart

798
00:53:27,953 --> 00:53:30,506
Why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

799
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,329
Or bring me my hook?

800
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:35,367
The ocean's straight up pooky dooks!

801
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:38,398
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

802
00:53:39,138 --> 00:53:40,691
You're the chosen one.

803
00:53:56,872 --> 00:53:59,259
The ocean chose you for a reason.

804
00:54:00,418 --> 00:54:02,635
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.

805
00:54:03,717 --> 00:54:05,877
So, not seeing entrance.

806
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:10,300
Yes, because it only
appears after a human sacrifice.

807
00:54:12,105 --> 00:54:13,572
Kidding!

808
00:54:13,661 --> 00:54:15,461
So serious!

809
00:54:38,544 --> 00:54:41,822
Don't worry. It's a lot farther
down than it looks.

810
00:54:48,467 --> 00:54:51,367
I am still falling!

811
00:54:55,676 --> 00:54:56,676
Go!

812
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:19,945
And he's sticks the landing.

813
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,148
What?

814
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:24,837
Dumb-dumb, she's not even here.

815
00:55:25,013 --> 00:55:27,610
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of mon...

816
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:33,461
Well....

817
00:55:33,954 --> 00:55:34,555
She's dead.

818
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,475
Okay, let's get my hook.

819
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,487
Maui's fish hook.

820
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:41,820
Yeah!

821
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:43,546
Sorry!

822
00:56:44,027 --> 00:56:45,480
I thought you're a monster, but...

823
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:47,237
I found your hook! And you're right...

824
00:56:47,254 --> 00:56:49,587
- This Tamatoa really likes his treasure.
- Stay!

825
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,055
What? No!

826
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,571
- I... I'm the one who found...
- Listen...

827
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:53,984
For a thousand years...

828
00:56:54,098 --> 00:56:56,596
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky

829
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:59,386
Getting my hook, and being awesome again.

830
00:56:59,533 --> 00:57:01,930
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal.

831
00:57:01,954 --> 00:57:02,963
Who has no business

832
00:57:02,981 --> 00:57:05,373
Inside of a monster's cave except...

833
00:57:07,686 --> 00:57:08,708
Except...

834
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:10,241
Maybe as bait.

835
00:57:10,876 --> 00:57:11,876
Huh?

836
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:15,556
Wow! The shiny, glittery cave.

837
00:57:15,772 --> 00:57:17,161
And just like me.

838
00:57:17,348 --> 00:57:20,002
It is covered in sparkly treasure.

839
00:57:20,138 --> 00:57:21,504
Sparkle, sparkle

840
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:23,559
- Sparkle.
- You're not selling it.

841
00:57:23,718 --> 00:57:25,872
This is stupid! I'm just gonna
walk up and get it.

842
00:57:25,912 --> 00:57:27,763
You go up there,
he will kill you.

843
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:28,964
Just stick to the plan.

844
00:57:30,099 --> 00:57:32,741
Oh, when he shows up,
keep him distracted.

845
00:57:32,956 --> 00:57:34,427
Make him talk about himself.

846
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:36,758
He loves bragging about
how great he is!

847
00:57:36,764 --> 00:57:38,831
You two must get along as well!

848
00:57:39,037 --> 00:57:41,437
No. Not since I ripped off his leg.

849
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,991
You ripped off his le...

850
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:43,886
Maui?

851
00:57:53,986 --> 00:57:55,386
What have we here?

852
00:57:56,066 --> 00:57:58,748
It's a sparkly, shiny.

853
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,143
Wait a minute...

854
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:03,007
It's a human!

855
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:04,753
What are you doing down here?

856
00:58:04,778 --> 00:58:07,992
In the realm of the mons...
Just pick an eye, babe.

857
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,566
I can't... I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying

858
00:58:10,595 --> 00:58:12,511
If you keep...
Yep, pick one, pick one!

859
00:58:13,321 --> 00:58:15,691
You're a funny looking
little thing, aren't you?

860
00:58:15,713 --> 00:58:17,176
Don't! That's my grandma's.

861
00:58:17,204 --> 00:58:19,508
"That's my grandma's"
I ate my grandma!

862
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,405
And it took a week 'cause
she was absolutely humongous.

863
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:23,607
Why are you here?

864
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:25,980
'Cause you're amazing!

865
00:58:26,782 --> 00:58:30,859
And we mortals, have heard of
the tale of the crab.

866
00:58:30,894 --> 00:58:32,147
Who became a legend!

867
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:34,352
And I just had to know...

868
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:38,488
How you being so crab...

869
00:58:39,178 --> 00:58:40,154
-oulous?

870
00:58:40,936 --> 00:58:45,014
Are you just trying to get me to
talk about myself?

871
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,659
Because if you are...

872
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:50,102
I will gladly do so.

873
00:58:51,112 --> 00:58:52,637
In song form!

874
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:58,366
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam.

875
00:58:58,653 --> 00:59:01,127
I was a drab little crab once..

876
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:04,863
Now I know, I can be
happy as a clam.

877
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:07,533
Because I'm beautiful, baby.

878
00:59:08,396 --> 00:59:11,571
Did your granny say listen to your heart.

879
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:14,364
Be who you are on the inside.

880
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:17,858
I need three words to tear her
argument a part.

881
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:19,486
Your granny lied.

882
00:59:19,537 --> 00:59:24,384
I'd rather be shiny like a treasure
from a sunken pirate wreck.

883
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:28,292
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny.

884
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:31,041
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck

885
00:59:31,515 --> 00:59:33,856
Just a sec, don't you know?

886
00:59:34,049 --> 00:59:37,795
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters

887
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:42,404
Beginners. Oh, and here they
come, come, come.

888
00:59:42,529 --> 00:59:44,734
To the brightest thing that glitters.

889
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:48,175
Mmm, fish dinners.
I just love free food.

890
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,322
And you look like seafood

891
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,464
- No!
- Hey! Crab cake.

892
00:59:58,521 --> 00:59:59,541
I'm back!

893
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:03,422
It's Maui time!

894
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,351
What do you say, little buddy.

895
01:00:08,406 --> 01:00:10,001
Giant hawk? Coming up!

896
01:00:22,264 --> 01:00:23,534
Well, well, well....

897
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:26,929
Little Maui's having trouble with his look.

898
01:00:27,428 --> 01:00:29,725
You little semi-demi-mini-god.

899
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:34,032
Ouch! What a terrible performance.
Get the hook! Get it?

900
01:00:34,057 --> 01:00:37,088
You don't swing it like you used to, man.

901
01:00:37,282 --> 01:00:40,516
Yet I have to give you credit for my start.

902
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:43,118
And your tattoos on the outside.

903
01:00:43,722 --> 01:00:46,803
For just like you I made
myself a work of art.

904
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:48,848
I'll never hide, I can't.

905
01:00:48,871 --> 01:00:53,689
I'm too shiny! Watch me dazzle like
a diamond in the rough.

906
01:00:53,728 --> 01:00:56,971
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny.

907
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,779
Send your armies but
they'll never be enough.

908
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:02,779
My shell's too tough, Maui man.

909
01:01:02,808 --> 01:01:04,488
You could try, try, try...

910
01:01:04,532 --> 01:01:06,943
But you can't expect a demigod.

911
01:01:07,147 --> 01:01:08,286
To beat a decapod.

912
01:01:08,513 --> 01:01:09,264
Look it up!

913
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:13,237
You will die, die, die.
Now it's time for me to take apart.

914
01:01:13,702 --> 01:01:15,000
Your aching heart.

915
01:01:15,527 --> 01:01:20,520
Far from the ones who abandoned you.

916
01:01:20,532 --> 01:01:24,861
Chasing the love of these humans.

917
01:01:25,092 --> 01:01:28,156
Who made you feel wanted.

918
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,752
You try to be tough.

919
01:01:31,194 --> 01:01:34,974
But your armour's just not hard enough.

920
01:01:35,244 --> 01:01:39,774
Maui! Now it's time to kick your hiney.

921
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:42,900
Ever seen someone so shiny?

922
01:01:43,184 --> 01:01:45,848
Soak it in cause it's
the last you'll ever see.

923
01:01:46,313 --> 01:01:49,591
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny!

924
01:01:49,733 --> 01:01:52,671
Now I'll eat you so prepare
your final plea.

925
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:54,131
Just for me.

926
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,190
You'll never be quite as shiny

927
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:04,137
You wish you were nice and shiny

928
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:05,833
Hey!

929
01:02:06,542 --> 01:02:08,231
I got something shiny for you.

930
01:02:10,478 --> 01:02:12,582
The heart of Te Fiti.

931
01:02:12,978 --> 01:02:15,333
You can't run from me.

932
01:02:15,425 --> 01:02:16,117
Oh, you can?

933
01:02:16,292 --> 01:02:17,715
You keep surprising me.

934
01:02:19,825 --> 01:02:22,659
It's only so far you can get on
these two little legs.

935
01:02:27,048 --> 01:02:28,651
The power of creation!

936
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:30,302
For a crustacean!

937
01:02:30,742 --> 01:02:32,547
Where is it?
Where is it?

938
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,060
We gotta go!

939
01:02:34,846 --> 01:02:36,240
Well, what about the heart.

940
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:37,451
He can have it.

941
01:02:37,635 --> 01:02:38,865
I've got a better one.

942
01:02:40,275 --> 01:02:42,582
Yes, I have the ...
Wait a minute.

943
01:02:43,098 --> 01:02:44,724
I see she's taken a barnacle

944
01:02:44,944 --> 01:02:47,319
And she's covered it in
bioluminescent algae.

945
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:48,810
As a diversion.

946
01:02:51,653 --> 01:02:53,105
Come back here!

947
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:00,786
Hey! Hey!

948
01:03:01,427 --> 01:03:02,504
Did you like the song?

949
01:03:10,773 --> 01:03:11,787
We're alive!

950
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:13,568
We're alive!

951
01:03:15,184 --> 01:03:16,223
Listen

952
01:03:16,312 --> 01:03:19,209
I appreciate what you did down there.

953
01:03:19,391 --> 01:03:20,509
Took guts.

954
01:03:20,924 --> 01:03:22,506
But... I'm sorry.

955
01:03:22,903 --> 01:03:26,406
I'm tryin' to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

956
01:03:26,416 --> 01:03:28,990
- No, no, no way!
- Really?

957
01:03:29,194 --> 01:03:30,747
'Cause you're looking at
me like I have a ...

958
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:34,917
Shark head.

959
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,613
- Do you have a shark head? 'Cause I ...
- Look ...

960
01:03:38,805 --> 01:03:39,916
The point is ...

961
01:03:40,506 --> 01:03:45,377
For a little girl, child thing, whatever
 who had no business being down there.

962
01:03:46,238 --> 01:03:47,366
You did me a solid.

963
01:03:48,154 --> 01:03:49,458
But you also almost died.

964
01:03:50,036 --> 01:03:51,961
And I couldn't even beat
that dumb crab!

965
01:03:52,306 --> 01:03:54,081
So chances of beating Te Ka.

966
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:57,673
We're never making it to Te Fiti.

967
01:03:57,936 --> 01:03:59,075
This mission is cursed.

968
01:03:59,441 --> 01:04:01,244
It's not cursed.

969
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:05,004
- Shark head.
- It is not cursed!

970
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:20,569
Cursed.

971
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:28,518
What can I say, except
we're dead soon.

972
01:04:28,938 --> 01:04:30,519
We're dead soon.

973
01:04:31,607 --> 01:04:33,526
Can you at least try?

974
01:04:35,847 --> 01:04:37,554
Giant hawk.

975
01:04:40,649 --> 01:04:43,623
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.
We're dead soon.

976
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,579
Alright, breaktime's over.

977
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:47,184
- Get up!
- Why?

978
01:04:47,422 --> 01:04:48,828
You're gonna give me a speech

979
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:53,225
Tell me I could beat Te Ka
'cause I'm "Maui"?

980
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:56,010
Take a hike, tiny.

981
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:04,337
How do you get your tattoo's?

982
01:05:04,852 --> 01:05:07,142
They show up when I earn them.

983
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:09,518
How'd you earn that one?

984
01:05:09,653 --> 01:05:11,035
What's that for?

985
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:14,116
That's a man's discovery of Nanya.

986
01:05:14,629 --> 01:05:15,667
What's Nanya?

987
01:05:15,726 --> 01:05:16,730
None ya business.

988
01:05:18,618 --> 01:05:19,896
I'll just keep asking.

989
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:23,821
What's it for?

990
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,760
You need to stop doing that.

991
01:05:30,566 --> 01:05:32,572
- Back off!
- Just tell me what it is?!

992
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,876
I said back off.

993
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:35,662
Is it why your hook's not working?

994
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:53,079
You don't wanna talk.

995
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:54,760
Don't talk.

996
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,975
You wanna throw me off the boat.

997
01:05:57,463 --> 01:05:58,661
Throw me off.

998
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,058
You wanna tell me, I don't
know what I'm doing?

999
01:06:03,203 --> 01:06:04,218
I know I don't.

1000
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:08,740
I have no idea why
the ocean chose me.

1001
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:10,252
You're right.

1002
01:06:11,436 --> 01:06:15,009
But my island is dying.

1003
01:06:16,137 --> 01:06:18,433
So I am here.

1004
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:21,882
It's just me and you.

1005
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,116
And I want to help.

1006
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:29,381
But I can't  if you don't let me.

1007
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:37,328
I wasn't born a demigod.

1008
01:06:38,129 --> 01:06:39,461
I had human parents.

1009
01:06:40,946 --> 01:06:42,150
They...

1010
01:06:42,817 --> 01:06:43,912
They took one look and...

1011
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,296
And decided they
did not want me.

1012
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:51,216
They threw me under the sea.

1013
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:54,730
Like I was nothing.

1014
01:06:56,942 --> 01:06:59,640
Somehow I was found by the Gods.

1015
01:07:00,411 --> 01:07:01,562
They gave me the hook.

1016
01:07:02,764 --> 01:07:05,422
They made me... Maui.

1017
01:07:07,128 --> 01:07:09,419
And back to the humans I went.

1018
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,565
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts!

1019
01:07:15,175 --> 01:07:16,484
Anything they could ever want.

1020
01:07:18,183 --> 01:07:19,572
You took the heart for them.

1021
01:07:21,267 --> 01:07:23,547
You did everything for them.

1022
01:07:24,828 --> 01:07:26,035
So they'd loved you.

1023
01:07:27,152 --> 01:07:29,827
It was never enough.

1024
01:07:38,562 --> 01:07:41,317
Maybe the Gods found
you for a reason.

1025
01:07:41,952 --> 01:07:44,577
Maybe the ocean brought you to them.

1026
01:07:45,376 --> 01:07:48,596
Because it saw someone who is
worthy of being saved.

1027
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:53,496
But the Gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1028
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:56,261
You are.

1029
01:08:05,709 --> 01:08:07,257
Okay, okay.

1030
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:11,110
I... I love you too, buddy.

1031
01:09:17,146 --> 01:09:18,153
Yeah!

1032
01:09:42,107 --> 01:09:44,080
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1033
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:34,967
- What?
- I figured it out

1034
01:10:35,453 --> 01:10:39,342
You know the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands.

1035
01:10:39,431 --> 01:10:42,542
'Cause your ancestors would sail our seas.
Find them!

1036
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:46,101
All those new lands, new villages...

1037
01:10:47,116 --> 01:10:48,896
It was the water that connected them all.

1038
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,352
And if I were the ocean

1039
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,597
I think I'd be looking for a...

1040
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:55,780
Curly haired, non-princess.

1041
01:10:56,677 --> 01:10:58,107
To start that again.

1042
01:10:58,695 --> 01:11:01,088
That is literaly the nicest thing

1043
01:11:01,099 --> 01:11:02,930
You've ever said to me.

1044
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:06,710
Probably should've saved it for Te Fiti.

1045
01:11:07,766 --> 01:11:09,266
I did.

1046
01:11:11,737 --> 01:11:13,438
Moana of Motunui.

1047
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:15,002
I believe.

1048
01:11:15,064 --> 01:11:17,196
You have officially delivered Maui.

1049
01:11:17,309 --> 01:11:19,221
Across the great sea.

1050
01:11:20,891 --> 01:11:23,707
Moana!  Moana!  Moana!

1051
01:11:23,766 --> 01:11:25,766
You're so amazing!

1052
01:11:27,351 --> 01:11:28,351
It's time.

1053
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:47,929
Go, save the world.

1054
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,640
Maui!

1055
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:48,682
What... What are you doing?

1056
01:12:48,693 --> 01:12:50,184
Finding you a better way in!

1057
01:12:52,344 --> 01:12:54,248
- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!

1058
01:12:54,288 --> 01:12:55,326
- Turn around!
- No!

1059
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:56,890
- Moana, stop!
- No!

1060
01:13:25,767 --> 01:13:27,009
Are you okay?

1061
01:13:29,136 --> 01:13:30,136
Maui?

1062
01:13:37,894 --> 01:13:39,172
I told you to turn back.

1063
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:43,565
I thought we could make it.

1064
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:45,230
We?

1065
01:13:46,664 --> 01:13:48,620
I thought I could make it.

1066
01:13:50,808 --> 01:13:51,808
We can fix it!

1067
01:13:51,909 --> 01:13:53,581
It was made by the Gods.

1068
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:55,735
You can't fix it!

1069
01:13:56,585 --> 01:13:57,999
Next time we'll be more careful.

1070
01:13:58,798 --> 01:14:00,601
Te Ka was stuck on the barrier islands.

1071
01:14:01,009 --> 01:14:02,009
It's lava!

1072
01:14:02,018 --> 01:14:03,161
It can't go in the water.

1073
01:14:03,587 --> 01:14:04,587
We can find a way around.

1074
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:06,657
I'm not going back.

1075
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:10,712
What... We still have to restore the heart.

1076
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:11,822
My hook is cracked.

1077
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:13,903
One more hit and it's over.

1078
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,172
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1079
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:18,253
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1080
01:14:18,275 --> 01:14:19,445
That's not true.

1081
01:14:19,466 --> 01:14:21,726
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1082
01:14:31,671 --> 01:14:35,325
We're only here because you
stole the heart in the first place.

1083
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,590
No, we're here because
the ocean told you

1084
01:14:39,612 --> 01:14:41,337
You're special and
you believed it,

1085
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:45,788
I am Moana of Motunui.

1086
01:14:46,071 --> 01:14:48,127
- You will board my boat.
- Goodbye, Moana.

1087
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:50,738
- Sail across the sea,
- I'm not killing myself

1088
01:14:50,747 --> 01:14:52,347
So you can prove you're
something you're not!

1089
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,081
And restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1090
01:14:54,312 --> 01:14:55,973
The Ocean chose me!

1091
01:14:57,632 --> 01:14:58,632
They chose wrong.

1092
01:15:09,116 --> 01:15:10,116
Maui!

1093
01:15:25,137 --> 01:15:26,526
Why did you bring me here?

1094
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:34,192
I'm not the right person.

1095
01:15:36,876 --> 01:15:39,291
You have to choose someone else.

1096
01:15:42,433 --> 01:15:44,350
Choose someone else!

1097
01:15:45,793 --> 01:15:46,808
Please!

1098
01:16:23,241 --> 01:16:25,723
You're a long ways past the reef.

1099
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:27,715
Grandma?

1100
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:32,507
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1101
01:16:33,606 --> 01:16:34,606
Grandma!

1102
01:16:39,842 --> 01:16:41,349
I tried, grandma.

1103
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:43,150
I...

1104
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:46,050
I couldn't do it.

1105
01:16:46,412 --> 01:16:47,880
It's not your fault.

1106
01:16:49,126 --> 01:16:52,215
I never should've put so much
on your shoulders.

1107
01:16:53,513 --> 01:16:55,654
If you are ready to go home.

1108
01:16:57,116 --> 01:16:58,519
I will be with you.

1109
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:17,103
Why do you hesitate?

1110
01:17:18,674 --> 01:17:19,674
I don't know.

1111
01:17:23,971 --> 01:17:26,261
I know a girl from an island.

1112
01:17:27,299 --> 01:17:29,783
She stands apart from the crowd.

1113
01:17:30,492 --> 01:17:33,001
She loves the sea and her people.

1114
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:36,236
She makes her whole family proud.

1115
01:17:37,211 --> 01:17:40,192
Sometimes the world seems against you.

1116
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:43,298
The journey may leave a scar.

1117
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:45,789
But scars can
heal and reveal

1118
01:17:45,806 --> 01:17:48,656
Just where you are.

1119
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,809
The people you love will change you.

1120
01:17:53,495 --> 01:17:56,042
The things you have learned will guide you.

1121
01:17:56,569 --> 01:17:59,399
And nothing on earth
can silence

1122
01:18:00,011 --> 01:18:02,942
The quiet voice still inside you.

1123
01:18:03,384 --> 01:18:06,312
And when that voice starts to whisper

1124
01:18:06,938 --> 01:18:09,322
Moana you've come so far.

1125
01:18:10,376 --> 01:18:11,812
Moana listen.

1126
01:18:12,266 --> 01:18:17,244
Do you know who you are?

1127
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,200
Who am I?

1128
01:18:22,676 --> 01:18:25,930
I am a girl who loves my island.

1129
01:18:26,253 --> 01:18:29,124
I'm the girl who loves the sea.

1130
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:33,098
It calls me...

1131
01:18:35,676 --> 01:18:38,284
I am the daughter of the village chief.

1132
01:18:38,998 --> 01:18:42,150
We are descended from voyagers.

1133
01:18:42,245 --> 01:18:44,876
Who found their way across the world.

1134
01:18:45,074 --> 01:18:47,676
They call me ...

1135
01:18:48,815 --> 01:18:51,301
I've delivered us to where we are.

1136
01:18:52,013 --> 01:18:54,403
I have journeyed farther.

1137
01:18:55,185 --> 01:19:00,939
I am everything I've learned and more.
Still it calls me.

1138
01:19:01,573 --> 01:19:04,036
And the call isn't out there at all.

1139
01:19:04,059 --> 01:19:07,058
It's inside me.

1140
01:19:07,271 --> 01:19:13,941
It's like the tide always
falling and rising.

1141
01:19:14,378 --> 01:19:16,747
I will carry you here in my heart.

1142
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:19,882
You remind me.

1143
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:23,099
That come what may.

1144
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:26,264
I know the way!

1145
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:30,833
I AM  MOANA!

1146
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:07,788
I am Moana of Motunui.

1147
01:20:09,201 --> 01:20:12,579
Aboard my boat, I will
sail across the sea.

1148
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:15,639
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

1149
01:20:52,278 --> 01:20:54,188
Te Ka can't follow us into the water.

1150
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:56,976
We'll make it pass the barrier islands.

1151
01:20:57,376 --> 01:20:59,176
We'll make it to Te Fiti.

1152
01:20:59,261 --> 01:21:01,061
None of which you understand.

1153
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,660
Because you are a chicken.

1154
01:22:09,037 --> 01:22:10,037
No!

1155
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:11,935
Hei-hei!

1156
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:13,526
No, no, no, no, no!

1157
01:22:15,147 --> 01:22:16,006
Nice work!

1158
01:22:26,076 --> 01:22:26,915
Te Fiti!

1159
01:22:52,422 --> 01:22:53,108
Maui!

1160
01:22:57,810 --> 01:22:58,876
You came back.

1161
01:23:02,837 --> 01:23:03,837
But your hook.

1162
01:23:04,334 --> 01:23:05,873
One more hit, and ...

1163
01:23:06,644 --> 01:23:08,231
Te Ka's gotta catch me first.

1164
01:23:11,215 --> 01:23:12,689
I got your back, chosen one.

1165
01:23:13,817 --> 01:23:14,826
Go, save the world.

1166
01:23:15,234 --> 01:23:15,744
Maui.

1167
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:17,515
Thank you.

1168
01:23:18,689 --> 01:23:19,539
You're welcome.

1169
01:23:53,659 --> 01:23:54,527
Hey... Te Ka!

1170
01:23:55,944 --> 01:23:56,974
Shark head.

1171
01:24:09,763 --> 01:24:10,692
Moana!

1172
01:24:20,788 --> 01:24:22,596
Get the heart to the spiral!

1173
01:25:01,186 --> 01:25:01,889
Te Fiti.

1174
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:04,089
It's gone.

1175
01:25:17,332 --> 01:25:19,175
TE KA!!

1176
01:25:54,895 --> 01:25:56,068
Let her come to me.

1177
01:26:19,425 --> 01:26:23,570
I have crossed the horizon
to find you.

1178
01:26:29,983 --> 01:26:32,608
I know your name.

1179
01:26:36,438 --> 01:26:41,130
They have stolen the heart from inside you.

1180
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:47,857
But this does not define you.

1181
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:55,205
This is not who you are.

1182
01:26:57,235 --> 01:27:02,812
You know who you are...

1183
01:27:09,278 --> 01:27:11,368
Who you trully are.

1184
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,289
Te Fiti.

1185
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:17,727
The chicken lives.

1186
01:28:19,984 --> 01:28:21,691
I'm sorry about your hook.

1187
01:28:22,343 --> 01:28:27,048
Well, hook, no hook,
I'm Maui.

1188
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:47,950
Te Fiti!

1189
01:28:50,634 --> 01:28:51,634
How you've been?

1190
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:57,465
Look, what I did was wrong.

1191
01:28:58,650 --> 01:28:59,996
I have no excuse.

1192
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:02,294
I'm sorry.

1193
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:14,184
You know, it'd be rude
to refuse a gift from a Goddess.

1194
01:29:19,885 --> 01:29:20,685
Thank you.

1195
01:29:20,765 --> 01:29:23,279
Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.

1196
01:30:13,347 --> 01:30:14,447
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1197
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:16,152
You could come with us, you know.

1198
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:20,163
My people are going to need a
master wayfinder.

1199
01:30:22,011 --> 01:30:23,131
They already have one.

1200
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:43,441
See you out there, Maui.

1201
01:30:44,184 --> 01:30:46,264
See you out there, Moana...

1202
01:31:39,856 --> 01:31:41,030
Mom! Dad!

1203
01:31:41,302 --> 01:31:42,356
Moana!

1204
01:31:50,726 --> 01:31:54,989
I may have gone a little ways past
the reef.

1205
01:31:56,621 --> 01:31:57,806
It suits you.

1206
01:31:58,362 --> 01:32:00,095
- She's back!
- Moana!

1207
01:32:00,698 --> 01:32:01,698
Pua!

1208
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:05,353
Moana!

1209
01:32:55,707 --> 01:32:58,026
Aue, Aue

1210
01:32:58,077 --> 01:33:00,135
We set a course to find...

1211
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:05,024
A brand new island everywhere we roam.

1212
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:07,060
Aue, Aue

1213
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,637
We keep our island in our mind.

1214
01:33:09,973 --> 01:33:14,803
And when it's time to find home,
We know the way

1215
01:33:14,831 --> 01:33:19,365
Aue, Aue
We are explorers reading every sign.

1216
01:33:19,407 --> 01:33:24,298
We tell the stories of our elders
in a never ending chain.

1217
01:33:24,366 --> 01:33:26,266
Aue, Aue

1218
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:31,196
Te Fenua, te Malie.
Nae ko hakilia.

1219
01:33:31,451 --> 01:33:36,756
We know the way....

1220
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:42,454
