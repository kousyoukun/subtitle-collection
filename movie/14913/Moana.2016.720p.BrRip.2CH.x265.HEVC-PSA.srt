00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,683
there was only ocean...

until the mother island emerged.

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,808
Te Fiti.

5
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:10,206
Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.

6
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,329
It could create life itself.

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,724
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

8
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,365
But in time...

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,563
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

10
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,847
They believed if they could possess it...

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,640
the great power of creation
would be theirs.

12
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,167
And one day...

13
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,325
the most daring of them all...

14
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,848
voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.

15
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,040
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,084
He was a warrior.

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,564
A trickster.

18
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,246
A shapeshifter who could change form...

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,045
with the power of his magical fish hook.

20
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,370
And his name...

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,406
was Maui.

24
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,408
But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,324
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

26
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,364
Maui tried to escape...

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,924
but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.

28
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,444
Te Kā!

29
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,603
A demon of earth and fire.

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,129
Maui was struck from the sky...

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,681
never to be seen again.

32
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,967
And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,930
were lost to the sea.

34
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,250
Where, even now...

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,367
1,000 years later...

36
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,126
Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,282
still hunt for the heart.

38
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,805
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,247
chasing away our fish...

40

draining the life
from island after island...

41

- Consider its tree

107

We use each part of the coconut
It's all we need

108

We make our nets from the fibers

109
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,923
The water is sweet inside

110
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,210
We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

111
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,124
Consider the coconuts

112
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,043
The trunks and the leaves

113
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,725
The island gives us what we need

114
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,644
And no one leaves

115
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,289
That's right, we stay

We're safe and we're well-provided

117
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,163
And when we look to the future

118
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,809
There you are

119
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,647
You'll be okay

120
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,609
In time you'll learn just as I did

121
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,480
You must find happiness
right where you are

122
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,009
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves

123
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,164
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves

124
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,245
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far

125
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,923
But once you know what you like
Well, there you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride

Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside

128
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,764
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star

129
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,442
Moana, that voice inside is who you are

130
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,528
- Uh-huh.
- Dad!

131

135
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,721

There will come a time...

when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

141
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,730
And on that day...

142
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,161
when you add your stone...

143
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,880
you will raise this whole island higher.

144
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,850
You are the future of our people, Moana.

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,571
And they are not out there.

146

They are right here.

147
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,923
It's time to be who they need you to be.

148
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
- We make our nets from the fibers
- We weave our nets from the fibers

149
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,682

150
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,000

- We have mouths to feed inside

152
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,923
- The village believes in us
- That's right

153

The village believes

154
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,922
The island gives us what we need

155

And no one leaves

156

So here I'll stay

Little Maui's having trouble with his look

970
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:03,847
Ya little semi-demi-mini-god

971
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,601
Ouch
What a terrible performance

972
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,210
Get the hook
Get it?

973
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,090
You don't swing it
Like you used to, man

974
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,730
Yet I have to give you
Credit for my start

975
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,849
And your tattoos on the outside

976
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:21,329
For just like you
I made myself a work of art

977
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,568
I'll never hide
I can't

978
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:24,766
I'm too shiny

979
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,889
Watch me dazzle
Like a diamond in the rough

980
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:31,407
Strut my stuff
My stuffis so shiny

981
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,079
Send your armies
But they'll never be enough

982
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,880
My shell's too tough
Maui, man

983
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,447
You can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod

984
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,442
To beat a decapod
Look it up

985
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,409
You will die, die, die

986
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:47,403
Now it's time for me to take apart

987
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:49,929
Your achin' heart

988
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:54,688
Far from the ones who abandoned you

989
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:59,519
Chasing the love of these humans

990
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,648
Who made you feel wanted

991
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,440
You tried to be tough

992
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,650
But your armor's just not hard enough

993
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,608
Maui, now it's time to kick your heinie

994
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,409
Ever seen someone so shiny

995
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,684
Soak it in
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see

996
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,451
C'est la vie
Mon ami

997
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:24,130
I'm so shiny

998
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,090
Now I eat you so prepare your final plea

999
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,360
Just for me

1000
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,121
You'll never be quite as shiny

1001
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:36,445
You wish you were nice and shiny

I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:23,682
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

I appreciate what you did down there.

Mm-hmm.

- Mm-hmm.

No, no. No way!

for a little girl, child, thing,

1041
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,449
you did me a solid.

And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,240
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

It's not cursed.

We're dead soon

We're dead soon

1055
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:08,083
Can you at least try?

1056
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:12,443
Giant hawk.

1057
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,407
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

Get up.

01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:23,887
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

1061
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:27,806
Tell me I can beat Te Kā
'cause I'm "Maui?"

1062
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:30,641
Take a hike, Tiny.

1063
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:39,119
How do you get your tattoos?

1064
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,766
They show up. When I earn them.

1065
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,563
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

1066
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:49,041
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

1067
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:50,326
What's Nunya?

1068
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,811
Nunya business.

1069
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,764
I'll just keep asking.

1070
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,041
What's it for?

1071
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,842
You need to stop doing that.

1072
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,208
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

1073
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,849
I said back off.

1074
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,684
Is it why your hook's not working?

1075
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,444
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1076
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,841
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1077
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:33,969
throw me off.

1078
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:37,442
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,564
I know I don't.

I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

You're right.

1082
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:50,204
But my island is dying...

1083
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,043
so I am here.

they did not want me.

Maui.

1098
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,645
And back to the humans I went.

1099
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:48,970
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1100

Anything they could ever want.

1101

You took the heart for them.

1102
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,890
You did everything for them.

1103
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,523
So they'd love you.

1104
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:05,283
It was never enough.

1105
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:16,728
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1106
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,042
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1107
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:24,329
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1108
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,167
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1109
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,079
You are.

1110
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,363
Okay, okay.

1111
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:45,845

1115
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:07,480
What?

1116
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,130
I figured it out.

1117
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:14,201
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1118
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:18,159
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1119
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,770
All those new lands, new villages.

1120
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,605
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1121
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,649
And if I were the ocean...

1122
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,930
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1123
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,483
to start that again.

1124
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:38,042
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1125
01:13:39,079 --> 01:13:41,207
Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti.

1126
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,921
I did.

1127

1128
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:54,724

delivered Maui across the great sea.

It's inside me

1229

It's like the tide
