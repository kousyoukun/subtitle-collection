2
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 In the beginning, there was only ocean

3
00:00:55,002 --> 00:01:01,000
Until,the mother island emerged."Te Fiti"

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,005
Her heart held the greatest power ever known

5
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,150
It could create life itself.

6
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,105
And Te fiti shared it with the world

7
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:21,618
But in time, some begun to seek Te fiti's heart

8
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:27,052
they beleived if they could possess it, the great power of creation would be theirs

9
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:38,063
And One day, the most daring of them all voyaged across the vast ocean to take it

10
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:44,565
He was a Demigod of the wind and sea.

11
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,138
He was a warrior. A Trikster.

12
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:58,533
A shape shifter who could change form with the power of his magical fish hook

13
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,374
And his name was Maui

14
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:21,607
But without her heart. Te fiti begun to crumble, giving birth to a terrible darkness

15
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:44,300
Maui tried to escape but was confronted by another who sought the heart

16
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:52,386
Te Ka. A demon of earth and fire

17
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:05,722
Maui was struck from the sky. never to be seen again

18
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:14,264
And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te fiti were lost to the sea

19
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:23,429
where even now, a thousand years later, Te ka and demons of the deep still hunt for the heart 

20
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,233
Hiding in the darkness that will continue to spread.

21
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:34,428
chasing a way of fish, draining the life from island after island

22
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:43,172
Until, every one of us is devoured by the blood thirsty jaws of inescapable death

23
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:55,490
But one day, the heart will be found by someone who would journey  beyond our reef

24
00:03:56,218 --> 00:04:03,890
find Maui, deliver him across the great ocean to restore Te Fiti's heart and save us all

25
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,300
oh! oh! oh! thank you mother. thats enough
Papa!!

26
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:14,356
No one goes out side the reef. we are safe here. there is no darkness. there are no monsters


27
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,390
 Monster! monster!
These are not mosters. no monsters.
there is just darkness 

28
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:24,269
there is nothing be....arms down...reef...but storms and rough sea

29
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:30,202
 as long as we stay on a very safe island, we will be fine.
 The legends are true

30
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,842
Someone will have to go.
Mother! Motunui is a paradise. who would want to go anywhere else?

31
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,725
Shoo!! Shoo! eeewww.


32
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,295
There you are Moana. what are you doing? You scared me

33
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,034
 But i want to go back

34
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:24,400
I know I Know but you don't go out there.Its Dangerous.
HMMMM....

35
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:29,168
Moana, come on. Lets go back to village

36
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,245
You are the next great chief of our people
And you do wonderous thing my little melon

37
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:41,686
Oh!Yes.But first,you must learn where you meant to be.

38
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:38,321
I like to dance with the water.The under toe on the waves.The water is mysterious.

39
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:51,200
The village may think am crazy and say that am too far but once you know what you like were there you are....

40
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:59,890
You are your father's daughter. stubborness and pride. mind what he says but remember you may here her voice aside.

41
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:10,234
And if the voice starts to whisper. to follow the fathers star. mOana the voice inside is all you are.

42
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:17,200
Dad!!! i was only looking at the boats.i wasn't gonna get on them

43
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:22,744
Come on. there is something i need to show you 

44
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,347
I wanted to bring you here from the moment you open your eyes

45
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:34,382
This is a sacred place. a place of chiefs.

46
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:43,256
They will come in time. when you stand on this peak and place a stone on this mountain. like i did. like my father did.

47
00:10:44,231 --> 00:08:06,989
And his father and every chiefs that is ever been

48
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:59,457
And on that day. when you had your stone, you will raise this whole island higher. you are the future of our people Moana.

49
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:04,426
And they are not out there.... they are right here.

50
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:08,130
Its time to be who they need you to be.

51
00:11:57,039 --> 00:08:16,600
Ahh.. every stone. this roof leaks no matter how many

52
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:18,141


53
00:12:09,880 --> 00:08:21,545
Thats,good pork

54
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:18,750
Oh!!... i wasn't....what?... they were going... so i got to.. Bye!!!

55
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,642
Awww...Awwww...AAwwww
You are doing great

56
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,719
is it done yet?

57
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:29,118
So Close..
Nooo....

58
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:49,939
Am curious about that chicken, eating the rock... he seems lack of basic intelligence required but pretty much everything

59
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,390
Should we may be just cook him?

60
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:58,666
Sometimes our strength lies, beneath the surface

61
00:13:00,838 --> 00:13:02,967
Far beneath.... in some cases....

62
00:12:03,207 --> 00:08:49,698
But am sure this more to Heihei than makes real....

63
00:13:49,876 --> 00:08:52,936
You eight are the most prosperous
street dealers in Gotham.

64
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:18,146
Its the harvest. This morning i was husking the coconuts, and......

65
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:31,345
we should clear the diseased trees and we will start a new grow... There...

66
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,386
Thanks Moana..... she's doing great

67
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,590
This suits you...

68
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,221
Chief!!!

69
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:51,80
There is something you need to see. our traps in the east lagoon...they are pulling out lace at least fish.

70
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:53,496
then we will ******the fishing grounds
71
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,699
we have. but there is no fish.

72
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,070
oh!!!  then we will fish in the far side of the island.

73
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,300
We tried.
the wind wood side?

74
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:06,400
The emily wood side, the shallows, the channels. we tried the whole lagoon.

75
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,060
they just gone

76
00:14:10,122 --> 00:14:13,714
were you tried to use a particular bait?.
I dont think its the bait.

77
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,389
I will talk to the council. am sure...
Hold it

78
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,293
We fish beyond the reef.

79
00:14:26,462 --> 00:14:29,090
No one goes beyond the reef.
I Know.

80
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:31,130
I know.but if there are is no fish in the lagoon...
Moana.

81
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:36,100
and  there is the whole ocean.
we have one rule.
An Old rule when there were fish.

82
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:42,442
A rule that keeps us safe.
 But dad!
Instead of endangering our people. so you can run back into water

83
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:56,409
every time i think you will pass this
No one goes beyond the reef

84
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:05,600
well, its not like you said it in front of your dad

85
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,182
standing on a boat

86
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,622
i didn't say, go beyond the reef,because i want to be on the ocean.

87
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:22,259
-He is hard on you because.....
-because he doesn't cared me.
-because he was you

88
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:30,222
Drawn to the ocean. dawn by the shore. he took a look a canoe Moana.
He crossed the reef

89
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:43,334
And found an unforgiving sea. waves like mountains. His best friend begged to be on that boat. your dad couldn't save him

90
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:48,457
He is hoping he can save you.

91
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:59,825
Sometimes, who we wish we were, what we wish we could do. this just not meant to be. 

92
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,497
Ok Pork. i can do this.

93
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:27,296
There is more fish beyond the reef. there is more beyond the reef.

94
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,166
Not so bad.

95
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,571
whatever just happened blame it on the bake
Grandma

96
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:50,338
Are you gonna tell dad?  

97
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:54,103
I miss mom. i dont have to tell him anything.

98
00:17:57,882 --> 00:18:01,042
He was right.About going out there.

99
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:07,166
-its time to put my stone on the mountain.

100
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:16,198
Ok.well,then head on back. put that stone out there.

101
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:24,036
why aren't  you try to stop me out of it.
You said thats what you wanted

102
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,769
It is.

103
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:35,671
When i die, am going to come back as one of these.

104
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,316
Or i chose the wrong tatoo.

105
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:40,547
Why are you acting weird.

106
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:45,105
Am the village crazy lady. thats my job.

107
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:48,336
Is there something you want to tell me? Just tell me.

108
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:52,276
Is there something you want to tell me?

109
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:55,224
Is there something you want to hear?

110
00:19:00,968 --> 00:19:05,362
you have been told all our peoples stories. but one.

111
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:07,464
What is this place?

112
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:13,344
Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef?

113
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:30,215
what's in there?
The Answer. To the questions, you keep asking yourself

114
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:34,132
Who are you meant to be?

115
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:42,865
Go inside. Bang the Drum. And find out.

116
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,340
Bang the drum.

117
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,675
[singing in tribal language]

118
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:34,512
We were voyagers. We were voyagers!! We were voyagers!! We were voyagers!!

119
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,654
why we stopped?
Maui.

120
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:55,585
when he stole from mother island,darkness fell. Te Ka awoke. Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back.

121
00:23:56,062 --> 00:24:03,155
To protect our people the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging and now we have forgotten who we are.

122
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:15,544
And the darkness has continued to spread. chasing the way of fish, draining the life from island after island.

123
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:35,753
Our Island.
But one day someone will journey beyond our reef. find maui. deliver him across the great ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

124
00:24:37,535 --> 00:24:44,368
I was there that day. The ocean chose you.

125
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:54,320
I thought it was dream

126
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:08,248
Nope. Our ansestors beleived Maui lies there at the bottom of  his hook.

127
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:11,261
Follow it and you will find him

128
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:18,397
but, why would it choose me. i dont even know how to make it past the reef

129
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:20,860
But i dont does.

130
00:25:30,803 --> 00:25:32,250
the crops turned black.
What about the fish?.

131
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:34,899
This is happening all over the island.
Please!!! Please!!! settle down.
How do you going to do?


132
00:25:35,111 --> 00:15:36,344
We will take new field. 

133
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:40,214
we will find a way to....
We can stop the darkness. save our island.

134
00:25:40,882 --> 00:25:47,343
There is a cavern of boats. Huge canoes. we can take them. find Maui. Make him restore the Heart.

135
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:50,686
We were voyagers. we can voyage again.

136
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:58,100
You told me to help our people.This is how we help our people.

137
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,100
Dad? What are you doing?
I should've burned those boats a long tome ago.

138
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:12,166
No. Dont. We have to find maui. we have to restore heart.
There is no heart. This... this is just a rock.
Nooo.

139
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,204
Chief. Its your Mother.

140
00:26:37,516 --> 00:26:38,347
Mother!!!.

141
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:56,490
What can be done?
(indistinct conversation)

142
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:06,495
GO.
Grandma.

143
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:14,396
Go.
Not now.I can't.
You must

144
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:19,407
The Ocean Chose you.Follow the fish hook.

145
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:29,620
When you find Maui, you grab him by the ear, you say i am Moana of Moutuni. 

146
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:38,250
you will aboard my boat,sail across the sea and restore the heart of Te fiti.

147
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:49,490
I... I can't Leave you.
there is nowhere you go that i won't be with you

148
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:03,296
GO!!!

182
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:46,371

236
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,228
you want to get it to Te fiti, you got to go through a whole ocean out there. not to mention Te Ka.

237
00:46:53,587 --> 00:46:59,479
Lava monster. ever defeated a Lava Monster?

238
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:10,252
Am not going on a suicide mission with some mortal.

239
00:47:11,235 --> 00:47:14,565
you can't restore the heart  without me, and me says no.

240
00:47:16,238 --> 00:47:20,435

244
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:42,447
but now?... now you are  just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

245
00:47:42,897 --> 00:47:44,397
And the guy who cursed the world.

246
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:50,463
Now you're no ones hero.
No one.....

247
00:47:58,986 --> 00:48:06,944
But, put this back. save the world. you would be every one's hero.

248
00:48:10,123 --> 00:48:13,557
Maui!! Maui !! Maui!!!  he's so awesome.

249
00:48:16,26 --> 00:48:19,426
We will never make it without my hook. not past Te ka.

250
00:48:19,895 --> 00:48:23,125
Then we get your hook. we get your hook. Take out Te ka. Restore the heart.

251
00:48:24,564 --> 00:48:33,565

Okay. we go east , the lair of Tamatoa.

256
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:58,845
If any one has my hook, its that be high bottomed feeder

257
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:14,653
Teach me to sail.

258
00:49:15,121 --> 00:49:18,486
My job is to deliver Maui across the great ocean.

259
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:25,646
I should.....  I should be sailing...
Its called Way finding Princess.

260
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:30,183
Is that a sails or not, its seeing where you going in your mind

261
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,427
Knowing where you are, find a way where you have been.

262
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:39,526
Okay. First am not a Princess. am the daughter of the Chief.
Same difference.

263
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:43,557
No.
If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick you're a Princess.

264
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:49,565
You are not a way finder. you will never be a way finder, you will never be...

265
00:49:54,103 --> 00:49:57,162
Really? Blow dart at my butt chick.

266
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:07,564
You are a bad person..
You can talk you can teach. Way finding. 

267
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:11,511

00:50:27,823 --> 00:50:31,181
you are measuring the stars. not giving the sky a hi five.

270
00:50:32,693 --> 00:50:35,024
If the currents more you are going in the right way.

271
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:46,027
Its cold. wait, its getting warmer. Ahhhhhh that is disgusting. what is wrong with you.

Enjoy your pity rest?

279
00:51:40,814 --> 00:51:46,575
You know a real way finder never sleeps. so they actually get where they need to go.

280

288
00:52:33,726 --> 00:32:38,548

The ocean?. Make sense. you are date. can sail obvious choice.

294
00:53:22,951 --> 00:53:30,418
It chose me for a reason.
if the ocean is so smart why  didn't it just take back the heart of Te Fiti itself..

295
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:33,082
Or bring me my hook

296
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,818
The ocean stride up, cookie dukes!

297
00:53:36,355 --> 00:53:38,475
But i'm sure it's not wrong about you

298
00:53:39,046 --> 00:53:41,116
You're the choosen one!


299
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:59,770
The ocean choose you for a reason.

300
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:03,236
If you start singing,
i'm gonna throw up.

301
00:54:03,683 --> 00:54:05,838
So, let's sing at entrance.

302
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,461
Yes, because it only appears
after a human sacrifice.


303
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,042
Kidding! Haha! So serious!


304
00:54:38,594 --> 00:54:41,872
Don't worry, it's a lot far
there down than looks.

305
00:54:48,436 --> 00:54:51,372
I'm still falling!

306
00:54:55,578 --> 00:54:56,688
Go!

307
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:21,046
And he sticks the landing.
Huh?

308
00:55:22,157 --> 00:55:24,871
What? Dumb, dumb,
she's not even here.

309
00:55:24,919 --> 00:55:27,625
No mortals gonna
jump into the realm of...

310
00:55:32,977 --> 00:55:33,977
Well...

311
00:55:33,986 --> 00:55:34,986
She's dead.

312
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:37,413
Okay! Let's get my hook!

313
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,491

314
00:56:38,497 --> 00:56:40,764
Maui's fish hook.

315
00:56:40,807 --> 00:56:41,807
Yeah...

316
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:46,711
Sorry... i thought you're a monster.
But, I found your hook and...

317
00:56:46,744 --> 00:56:48,910
You were right, this time it look like i really like the dis..

318
00:56:48,935 --> 00:56:51,886
Stay!
What? No! I'm the one who...

319
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:56,602
Listen, for thousand years i've only been
thinking to keep this hair soaky...

320
00:56:56,641 --> 00:56:59,258
...Getting my hook and being awesome again.

321
00:56:59,379 --> 00:57:02,887
And it's not getting screwed up by a mortal who has no business...

322
00:57:02,903 --> 00:57:05,666
...Inside of a monster cave.
Except...

323
00:57:07,602 --> 00:57:10,244
Except...
You made us bait.

324
00:57:12,522 --> 00:57:15,664
Wow...the shiny glittering cave.

325
00:57:15,681 --> 00:57:19,919
And just like me it is covered in sparkly treasure.

326
00:57:19,998 --> 00:57:22,324
Sparkle... Sparkle... Sparkle...

327
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:24,418
- You're not selling it!
- This is stupid!

328
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:27,632
I'm just gonna walk up and get it.
You go up there, he will kill you.

329
00:57:27,728 --> 00:57:29,261
Just stick to the plan.

330
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:32,831
Oh, when he shows up keep him distracted.

331
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:36,751
Make him talk about himself. He loves breaking about how grave he is.

332
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:38,950
You do it to us get along as well.

333
00:57:38,982 --> 00:57:41,315
You're right in the top of his leg.

334
00:57:43,387 --> 00:57:44,387
Maui?

335
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:55,929
Hohoho...
What have we here?

336
00:57:55,995 --> 00:57:58,765
It's a sparkly... shinny...

337
00:57:58,844 --> 00:58:00,712
Wait a minute...

338
00:58:01,828 --> 00:58:04,685
It's a human!
What are you doing down here?

339
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:06,783
In the Realm of the Mons...

340
00:58:06,966 --> 00:58:09,387
Just pick an eye, babe.
I can't... I can't concentrate...

341
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:12,870
...on what i'm sayin' if you keep...
Yep! Pick one! Pick One!

342
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:15,529
You're a funny looking
little thing, aren't you?

343
00:58:15,569 --> 00:58:18,132
 Don't! That's my grandma's!
That's my grandma's...

344
00:58:18,148 --> 00:58:22,331
I ate my grandma! And it took a weak
cause you was absolutely human just...

343
00:58:22,355 --> 00:58:23,806
Why are you here?

344
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,536
'Cause you're amazing!

345
00:58:26,717 --> 00:58:30,764
And we mortals have heard
of a tale of the crab...

346
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:34,209
...Who became a legend!
And i had to know...

347
00:58:34,225 --> 00:58:37,709
How...you... became... so...

348
00:58:37,757 --> 00:58:40,733
Crab?
Clueless...

349
00:58:40,828 --> 00:58:45,259
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

350
00:58:45,987 --> 00:58:47,924
Because if you are...

351
00:58:47,955 --> 00:58:50,138
...I will gladly do so!

352
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:53,646
In song form!
[singing]

353
01:02:04,726 --> 01:02:06,162
- Hey!
- Huh?

354
01:02:06,488 --> 01:02:08,688
I've got something shiny for ya..

355
01:02:10,384 --> 01:02:15,082
The Heart of Te Fiti.
You can't run from me!

356
01:02:15,345 --> 01:02:17,945
Oh,you can.
You keep suprising me!

357
01:02:19,805 --> 01:02:22,709
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

358
01:02:26,964 --> 01:02:30,371
The power of creation
for the crustacean!

359
01:02:30,776 --> 01:02:32,509
Where is it?
Where is it?

360
01:02:32,998 --> 01:02:34,553
We gotta go!

361
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:37,466
What about the heart?
He can have it.

362
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:38,911
I've got a better one.

363
01:02:40,315 --> 01:02:41,640
Yes! I have the...

364
01:02:41,863 --> 01:02:43,101
Wait a minute... Ahhh!

365
01:02:43,165 --> 01:02:47,402
I see she's takin' a bonicle
and she's covered it bioluminecent algae.

366
01:02:47,442 --> 01:02:48,823
Has a division!

367
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:52,531
Come back here!

368
01:02:59,293 --> 01:03:01,155
Hey! Heeey!

369
01:03:01,401 --> 01:03:03,361
Did you like the song?

370
01:03:10,694 --> 01:03:13,590
We're alive!
We're ali....huh?

371
01:03:15,186 --> 01:03:19,096
Listen, i appreciate
what you did down there...

372
01:03:19,392 --> 01:03:20,844
...Took guts...
Mmhmm.

373
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:24,519
But,uh... I'm sorry i'm trying
be some seer for once...

374
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,538
and it feels like you're distracted.
No! No! No way!

375
01:03:28,567 --> 01:03:31,289
Really? Cause you looking at me
like i have a... huh...

376
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:34,869
Shark head.

377
01:03:36,698 --> 01:03:40,312
Do you have a shark head? 'Coz you...
Look, the point is...

378
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:43,285
...For a little girl... child...
thing whatever...

379
01:03:43,325 --> 01:03:46,008
Who had no business being down there...

380
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:47,425
You did me a solid.

381
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:49,896
But you also almost died.

382
01:03:50,016 --> 01:03:54,571
And i couldn't even beat the dumb crab.
So chances of beating Te Ka...

853
01:03:56,087 --> 01:03:59,224
We'll never make it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

384
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:01,065
It's not cursed.

385
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:05,171
Sharkhead.
It is not cursed.

386
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:20,518
Cursed.

387
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:28,886
What can i say except,
"We're dead soon..."

388
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:31,055
We're dead soon...

389
01:04:31,545 --> 01:04:33,560
Can you at least... try?

390
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:37,774
Giant hawk!

391
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:43,529
Hey! It's okay! It's okay!
We're dead soon...

392
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:46,339
Alright, break time's over.
Get up!

393
01:04:46,688 --> 01:04:48,958
Why? You gonna give me a speech?

394
01:04:49,267 --> 01:04:53,220
Tell me i could beat Te Ka
coz i am... Maui?

395
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:56,124
Take a high, tiny.

396
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,716
How do you get your tatoos?

397
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:07,292
They showed up,
When i earn 'em.

398
01:05:08,006 --> 01:05:10,672
How do you earn that one?
What's that for?

399
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:14,212
That's ... Men's discovery of Nania.

400
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:17,427
- What's Nania?
- None of your business.

401
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:20,268
I'll just keep asking.

402
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:23,741
What's it for?

403
01:05:24,082 --> 01:05:25,949
You need to stop doing that.

404
01:05:30,563 --> 01:05:32,317
Back off!
Just tell me what it is!

405
01:05:32,325 --> 01:05:35,761
I said back off!
Is it why your hook's not working?

406
01:05:52,034 --> 01:05:53,486
You don't wanna talk...

407
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:54,589
Don't talk.

408
01:05:55,153 --> 01:05:57,288
You wanna throw me off the boat...

409
01:05:57,502 --> 01:05:58,732
Throw me off.

410
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:02,732
You wanna tell me,
i don't know what i'm doing...

411
01:06:03,164 --> 01:06:04,767
I know i don't.

412
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:08,727
I have no idea why the ocean choose me.

413
01:06:09,172 --> 01:06:10,172
You're right...

414
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:15,094
But, my island... is dying.

415
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:18,879
So i am here.

416
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:24,591
It's just me and you,
and i want to help.

417
01:06:25,324 --> 01:06:29,550
But i can't... If...
You don't let me.

418
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:36,352
I wasn't born...

419
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,693
...A demigod.

420
01:06:38,106 --> 01:06:39,876
I had human parents.

421
01:06:40,924 --> 01:06:45,963
They .... They took one look
and decided...

422
01:06:46,813 --> 01:06:49,427
They did not want me.

423
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:54,122
They threw me into the sea.
Like i was...

424
01:06:54,202 --> 01:06:55,543
...Nothing.

425
01:06:56,916 --> 01:07:00,064
Somehow, i was found by the gods.

426
01:07:00,376 --> 01:07:04,185
They gave me the hook.
They made me...

427
01:07:04,638 --> 01:07:06,663
...Maui.

428
01:07:07,115 --> 01:07:09,455
And...back to the humans i went.

429
01:07:10,289 --> 01:07:13,863
I gave them island, fire, coconuts.

430
01:07:15,127 --> 01:07:17,063
Anything they could ever want.

431
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,611
You took the heart for them.

432
01:07:21,175 --> 01:07:24,143
You did everything for them.

433
01:07:24,818 --> 01:07:26,135
So they loved you.

434
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:30,195
It was... never enough.

435
01:07:38,614 --> 01:07:41,447
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

436
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:45,003
Maybe the ocean brought you to them.

437
01:07:45,305 --> 01:07:49,051
Because it saw someone who
is worthy of being saved.

438
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:53,882
But the gods aren't the ones
who made you Maui.

439
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,249
You are.

440
01:08:05,662 --> 01:08:10,400
Okay... Okay... Hey...
I love you too, buddy.

441
01:10:31,536 --> 01:10:33,877
What?
I figured it out.

442
01:10:35,512 --> 01:10:39,215
You know the ocean used to love
when i pulled up islands.

443
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:42,654
'Cause your ancestors would sail
the seas... find them.

444
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,813
All those new lands, new villages...

445
01:10:47,195 --> 01:10:50,059
...It was the water
that connected them all.


446
01:10:50,084 --> 01:10:53,797
In the bioworthy ocean,
i think i'd be looking for uhh...

447
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:56,536
...Curly haired, non-princess...

448
01:10:56,624 --> 01:10:58,157
...To start that again.

449
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:03,594
That is literaly nicest thing
you've ever said to me.


450
01:11:03,989 --> 01:11:06,369
Probably you should've said
that to Te Fiti.

451
01:11:07,767 --> 01:11:08,767
I did.

452
01:11:11,818 --> 01:11:19,429
Moana of Motunui, i believe you have
officially delivered Maui across the great sea.

476
01:11:20,893 --> 01:11:23,671
Moana! Moana! Moana!

453
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:25,579
She's so amazing!

454
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:28,354
It's time.


455
01:11:46,654 --> 01:11:48,241
Go save the world!

456
01:12:11,655 --> 01:12:12,655
Maui!

457
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,519
What you... What are you doing?
Finding your better way in.

458
01:12:52,264 --> 01:12:54,185
We won't make it!
Yes we will!

459
01:12:54,248 --> 01:12:55,470
Turn around!
No!

460
01:12:55,494 --> 01:12:57,375
Moana stop!
No!

461
01:13:25,754 --> 01:13:27,267
Are you okay?

462
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,238
Maui?

463
01:13:37,854 --> 01:13:39,654
I told you to turn back.

464
01:13:42,013 --> 01:13:43,764
I thought we could make it.

465
01:13:44,179 --> 01:13:45,179
We?

466
01:13:46,624 --> 01:13:48,599
I thought... I could make it.

467
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:53,847
We can fix it!
It was made by the gods.

468
01:13:54,046 --> 01:13:56,101
You can't fix it!

469
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,632
Next time we'll be more careful.

470
01:13:58,895 --> 01:14:03,415
Te Ka was stuck on barrier islands.
It Lava, it can't go on the water.

471
01:14:03,546 --> 01:14:05,212
We can find a way around.

472
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:10,356
I'm not going back.

473
01:14:07,959 --> 01:14:10,451
Wha... We still have to restore the heart.

474
01:14:10,753 --> 01:14:13,893
My hook is cracked.
One more hit and it's over.


475
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:16,070
Maui, you have to restore the heart!

476
01:14:16,102 --> 01:14:18,246
Without my hook, i am nothing.

477
01:14:18,301 --> 01:14:19,367
That's not true!

478
01:14:19,404 --> 01:14:22,174
Without my hook, I am nothing!

479
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:35,976
We're only here because
you stole the heart in the first place.

480
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:41,794
No, we're here because the ocean
told you "You're special" and you believed it.

481
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:47,292
I am Moana of Motunui,
You will board my boat...

482
01:14:47,312 --> 01:14:48,098
Goodbye, Moana.

483
01:14:48,098 --> 01:14:51,207
- Sail across the sea...
- I'm not killing myself so you could...

484
01:14:51,232 --> 01:14:54,263
- ...Prove you're something you're not!
- ...And restore The Heart of Te Fiti.

485
01:14:54,288 --> 01:14:56,613
The ocean choose me!

486
01:14:57,613 --> 01:14:59,105
It chose wrong.

487
01:15:09,067 --> 01:15:10,067
Maui!

488
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,192
Why did you bring me here?

489
01:15:32,398 --> 01:15:34,747
I'm not the right person.

490
01:15:36,874 --> 01:15:40,176
You have to choose someone else.

491
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,750
Choose someone else!

492
01:15:45,562 --> 01:15:46,919
Please...

493
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:26,082
You're a long way past the reef.

494
01:16:26,629 --> 01:16:28,105
Grandma?

495
01:16:29,987 --> 01:16:32,868
Guess i choose the right tattoo.

496
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:34,527
Grandma!

497
01:16:39,837 --> 01:16:41,883
I'm trying, grandma.

498
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:43,138
I...

499
01:16:44,027 --> 01:16:45,773
I couldn't do it.

500
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,313
It's not your fault.

501
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:52,607
I never should've put so
much on your shoulders.

502
01:16:53,551 --> 01:16:55,631
If you are ready to go home...

503
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:59,651
...I'll be with you.

504
01:17:15,723 --> 01:17:17,316
Why do you hesitate?

505
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,304
I don't know.

506
01:17:23,975 --> 01:17:26,842
I know a girl from an island

507
01:17:27,285 --> 01:17:29,874
She stands apart from the crowd

508
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:33,347
She loves the sea and her people

509
01:17:33,648 --> 01:17:36,608
She makes her whole family proud

510
01:17:37,188 --> 01:17:40,371
Sometimes the world seems against you

511
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:43,430
The journey may leave a scar

512
01:17:43,588 --> 01:17:46,445
But scars can heal and reveal just

513
01:17:46,501 --> 01:17:49,794
Where you are

514
01:17:50,009 --> 01:17:53,029
The people you love will change you

515
01:17:53,394 --> 01:17:56,194
The things you have learned will guide you

516
01:17:56,592 --> 01:17:59,910
And nothing on Earth can silence

517
01:17:59,997 --> 01:18:03,187
The quiet voice still inside you

518
01:18:03,354 --> 01:18:06,687
And when that voice starts to whisper

519
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:10,204
Moana, you've come so far

544
01:18:10,244 --> 01:18:12,132
Moana, listen

520
01:18:12,212 --> 01:18:18,370
Do you know who you are?

521
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:21,116
Who am I?

522
01:18:22,632 --> 01:18:26,172
I am the girl who loves my island

523
01:18:26,219 --> 01:18:29,681
I'm the girl who loves the sea

524
01:18:30,565 --> 01:18:33,941
It calls me

525
01:18:35,572 --> 01:18:38,870
I am the daughter of the village chief

526
01:18:38,974 --> 01:18:42,117
We are descended from voyagers

527
01:18:42,196 --> 01:18:44,965
Who found their way across the world

528
01:18:45,077 --> 01:18:47,930
They call me

529
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,728
I've delivered us to where we are

530
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:54,672
I have journeyed farther

531
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:57,624
I am everything I've learned and more

532
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:01,087
Still it calls me

533
01:19:01,635 --> 01:19:04,174
And the call isn't out there at all

534
01:19:04,214 --> 01:19:07,249
It's inside me

535
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:14,254
It's like the tide
always falling and rising

536
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:16,745
I will carry you here in my heart

537
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:20,110
You'll remind me

538
01:19:20,142 --> 01:19:26,142
That come what may, I know the way

539
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:30,810
I am Moana!

540
01:20:05,489 --> 01:20:08,124
I am Moana of Motunui

541
01:20:09,156 --> 01:20:12,988
I'll aboard my boat
I will sail across the sea

542
01:20:13,029 --> 01:20:16,089
And restore The Heart Of Te Fiti.

543
01:20:52,228 --> 01:20:54,694
Te Ka can't follow us into the water.

544
01:20:54,894 --> 01:20:58,845
We make it past to the barrier island.
We make it to Te Fiti.

545
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:02,647
None of this will understand.
Because you're a chicken.

546
01:22:09,052 --> 01:22:10,052
No!

547
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:12,010
HeiHei!

548
01:22:12,026 --> 01:22:13,597
No! No! No! No! No!

549
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,097
Nice work!

550
01:22:26,065 --> 01:22:27,065
Te Fiti!

551
01:22:52,386 --> 01:22:53,386
Maui!

552
01:22:57,846 --> 01:22:59,272
You came back!

553
01:23:02,799 --> 01:23:03,865
But your hook...

554
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:06,086
One more hit and...

555
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,573
Te Ka's got to catch me first.

556
01:23:11,147 --> 01:23:13,663
Hey,i got your back, the choosen one!

557
01:23:13,798 --> 01:23:14,998
Go save the world!

558
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:16,203
Maui...

559
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,026
Thank you.

560
01:23:18,655 --> 01:23:20,183
You're welcome.

561
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,573
Hot! Hot! Hot!

562
01:23:53,592 --> 01:23:54,592
Hey, Te Ka!

563
01:23:56,075 --> 01:23:57,075
Shark head!

564
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:10,730
Moana!

565
01:24:20,726 --> 01:24:22,975
Get the high to the spiral!

566
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:02,141
Te Fiti...

567
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:04,756
It's gone.

568
01:25:17,308 --> 01:25:19,610
Te Ka!

569
01:25:54,943 --> 01:25:56,209
Let her come to me.

570
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:23,849
I have crossed the horizon to find you

571
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:33,208
I know your name

572
01:26:36,407 --> 01:26:40,899
I may have stolen the heart from inside you

573
01:26:44,822 --> 01:26:48,485
But this does not define you

574
01:26:51,395 --> 01:26:56,568
This is not who you are

575
01:26:57,155 --> 01:27:04,383
You know who you are

576
01:27:09,397 --> 01:27:11,721
Who you truly are.

577
01:27:35,210 --> 01:27:36,614
Te Fiti.

578
01:28:19,947 --> 01:28:21,843
I'm sorry about your hook.

579
01:28:22,336 --> 01:28:25,514
Well... Hook. No hook.

580
01:28:25,955 --> 01:28:27,161
I'm Maui.

581
01:28:46,312 --> 01:28:51,530
Te Fiti! Haha!
How have you been?

582
01:28:54,408 --> 01:28:58,364
Look, what i did was... wrong.

583
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:00,527
I have no excuse.

584
01:29:01,273 --> 01:29:02,273
I'm sorry.

585
01:29:11,261 --> 01:29:14,467
You know, it'd be rude
if it's a gift from a gods.

586
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:23,563
Thank you. Your kindness
is deeply pleasured.

587
01:29:24,796 --> 01:29:28,542
Look down...

588
01:29:29,082 --> 01:29:32,653
Upon our world

589
01:30:13,301 --> 01:30:16,243
- Got a mission, drum stick.
- You can come with us, you know.

590
01:30:16,706 --> 01:30:20,682
My people are going to need
a... Master Way Finder.

591
01:30:21,889 --> 01:30:23,436
They already have one.

592
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:43,746
See you out there, Maui.

593
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,548
See you out there, Moana.

594
01:31:39,808 --> 01:31:42,944
- Mom! Dad!
- Moana!

595
01:31:50,684 --> 01:31:55,021
I may have gone a little away
past the reef.

596
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:58,318
It suits you.

597
01:31:58,334 --> 01:32:02,113
She's back! Moana!

598
01:32:06,704 --> 01:32:08,405
Welcome home!

599
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:42,502
