Earth never existed!

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,438
Halt, Michael!

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,155
Do you hear me!
We will save you!

I'm going with you.
- Better not.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,036
For the two us, it would be...
You'd only hold me back.

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,118
It's the only way to save him.

30
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,320
And maybe even us.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,836
I'll be back in an hour.

32
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,392
What is he doing?

33
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,912
Michael!

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,838
Michael! Do you hear me?
We'll save you!

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,272
Do you hear me, Michael?

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,356
There's no other signal.

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,350
We will wait then.

38
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,795
We have travelled
billions of kilometres.

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,156
We are almost at the end
of our journey.

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,955
Time will pass and children will learn
that we were the first

41
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,988
who had set out on a journey
through the Universe to find life

42
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,198
on the planets of Alpha Centauri.

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,033
Geneva. Based on the latest news from
the World Aeronautics and Space Centre

44
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,676
the Ikaria launch maneuvres
are running according to schedule.

45
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,277
After 8 years of preparations, Ikaria
ceases to be one of Earth's satellites.

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,913
Ikaria XB 1 in fact is a small
space town for forty inhabitants.

47
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,193
Alpha Centauri was chosen
as the destination of the mission

48
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,073
not only for being a star
closest to Earth.

49
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,079
The decisive factor was that it is
similar to our Sun and has several

50
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,517
planets orbiting it, where the existence
of life is anticipated.

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,952
Throughout its construction
Ikaria orbited Earth

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,435
as a stationary satellite.

53
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,271
What will your father be doing
on the Ikaria? - Nothing.

54
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,796
How come nothing?
- Nothing.

55
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,036
When they land on some planet,

56
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,232
he will collect flowers and animals.

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,038
As we all know,
Ikaria will return in 15 years.

58
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,796
Due to time dilatation, however,
its crew, to put it popularly,

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,197
will only be 28 months older.

60
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,033
Mars. Our reporter informs us that
Ikaria has crossed Jupiter's orbit.

61
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,636
It should leave the solar system today.

62
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,234
Master Computer.

63
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,278
End of increased G-force.

64
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,151
Normal regime.

65
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,830
Autoregulation off.

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,159
That's that.

67
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,836
Get up, girls.

68
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,710
How are you feeling, Stephie?

69
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840
She was frightened.
- And you? - Me?

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,309
Just don't pretend to be a hero!

71
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,910
Especially not in front of your wife.

72
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,476
The lift off is not easy for anyone.

73
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,393
I thought it would be worse.

74
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,520
Commander MacDonald
to the transmission room.

75
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,195
If you only knew how many things
I wanted to tell you.

76
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,072
I know.

77
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,156
And I'm just saying
a lot of nonsense now.

78
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,599
What have you got there?

79
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,837
I picked it up in our garden.
A pebble.

80
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,918
Why...

81
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,878
Why are you looking at me like that?

82
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,958
When you come back...
- I know.

83
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,757
You'll be older than me.

84
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,952
I won't like you.
- It's not funny.

85
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,836
You'll look the same.

86
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,120
I'll have a fifteen year old daughter.

87
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,315
What?
Rena! Rena!

88
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,716
Navigation room!
What's the matter?

89
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,669
We're losing communication
with Earth, hurry up.

90
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,309
I was afraid we wouldn't
even say goodbye.

91
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,029
This time, there will be two
us waiting for you.

92
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,549
I was so anxious to teach her
first steps.

93
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,995
Now, I will see her for the first time
when she's 15.

94
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,997
You can teach her to dance.

95
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,395
She wouldn't thank me for that.

96
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,351
How are you feeling?

97
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,552
Are you happy that
you're finally flying?

98
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,515
It's a pity you can't fly with us.

99
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,032
What's the matter?

100
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,959
Never mind.
Give my regards to Stephie.

101
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,593
Tell her that...

102
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,674
I wish her a bon voyage.

103
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,274
To Stephie?
- Don't forget it.

104
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,033
Rena...

105
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,033
Rena.

106
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,680
He wanted to confuse the computer.
He ordered smoked bananas.

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,991
Dried beefbroth.
- And steak with what?

108
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,269
With honey.
- With honey.

109
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,120
And ice cream on garlic.
- And a steak with honey.

110
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,713
And this came out.

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,069
Enjoy it!

112
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,238
This is how our ancestors imagined
space food.

113
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,839
Romantics.

114
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,840
Well, I've finished my lunch.

115
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,312
Anthony.

116
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,511
Bon appetit.

117
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:29,390
It's June 26, 2163.

118
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,913
Morning temperatures around 15 degrees.
- This is the miracle of the last century.

119
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,391
A man of metal that not only...
- Wait, don't touch him.

120
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,916
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy...

121
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,910
Did you take it with you again?

122
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,953
As much as I remember, all crew members
may take with them:

123
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,311
Firstly, as many personal items,
as they wish.

124
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,874
Secondly...
- This is a personal item?

125
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,792
I have him for eighty years.

126
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,718
It's quite ancient then.

127
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,349
What?

128
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,551
But what will you do with it
here, Anthony?

129
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,831
What do you mean?
He always flies with me.

130
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,079
But all the robots here are controlled
centrally and are specialised.

131
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,309
Why should I care! Patrick is
universal. He can do anything.

132
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,872
But it's good for nothing.

133
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,078
Let's go Patrick.
- Let's go.

134
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,193
Not there.
- Not there.

135
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,077
Who is she?
- The new officer.

136
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,874
What new officer?
I don't know about any new officer.

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,232
She's flying instead of MacDonald's
wife. A historian. Why?

138
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,839
Never mind.

139
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,678
I don't know.

140
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,508
Don't tell me that it's not possible.
- It is, but on Earth.

141
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,275
Come on, Peter. A dandelion or a daisy
would do, or...

142
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,753
What daisy?

143
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,711
He wants me to grow him a flower.

144
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,518
For whom?
- That's not important. - Pardon.

145
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,194
Peter.
- I've got only unicells.

146
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,157
What if you give her a puppy.
- What?

147
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,920
A puppy,
one bitch is in pup.

148
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,555
I would like something...
- Poetic.

149
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,678
And what did the astrobiologists bring?

150
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,513
Nothing but poetry.
Peas, lentils, millet, rice.

151
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,438
Acorns, corn, onions.
- Sunflower seeds.

152
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,071
A sunflower is a flower too, isn't it?

153
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,752
I pull, nothing happens!

154
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,269
I pull once more, nothing happens.

155
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,549
I'm in hell, you see.

156
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,596
I look at the casing thermometer.

157
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,278
1,200.

158
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,351
That's big trouble, you see.

159
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,596
Stop saying you see!

160
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,870
And do you know what I did?

161
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,550
I activated the pulsator.
To full power.

162
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,473
Erik, listen...
Twenty kids and a teacher.

163
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,795
I pull one after another!
Really quickly, see?

164
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,673
They're yelling "Mummy"!
The teacher too, see?

165
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,516
And what happened next?

166
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,869
That sunflower is ready.
Do you still need it?

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,594
I don't know.
- Quite nice.

168
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,393
Who?
- The sunflower.

169
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,911
Let's hope he won't change his mind.

170
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,036
When I was his age.

171
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,478
Help him.

172
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,356
Sixty. You have a visitor at the door,
Eve. An important visitor.

173
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,473
Me?

174
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,357
Watch out!
- Don't be scared.

175
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,711
Some flower we've made you, eh?

176
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,114
Switch it over to the cabin.
- I can't. It's a private cabin.

177
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,598
Isn't this a bit imperfect?

178
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,199
On the contrary.

179
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,960
You won't get away, Anthony.

180
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,479
I had one after lunch.
- You did not.

181
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,915
You ran away as usual.
Come on.

182
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,759
I had one, ask anyone.

183
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,913
He's telling the truth. He had two.

184
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,110
Yes, two.
- You don't say!

185
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,552
You're all the same.
You'll suffer with avitaminosis.

186
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,110
One has to look after you
like a mother.

187
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,392
You know I've enjoyed being alone
since my childhood.

188
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,358
Brigitte!

189
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,270
It seems strange, but I really did.

190
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,154
I always thought nobody understood me.

191
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,959
Nonsense!

192
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,076
Anthony!

193
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,313
Can you still see Earth?

194
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,590
No.
- And the Sun?

195
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,390
Humans are like the stars.

196
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,639
What do you mean?

197
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,399
Somebody orbits around someone
else for years.

198
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,476
Who's orbiting?

199
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,075
That was a metaphor.
- A metaphor?

200
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,350
You're here again?
- Does he come here?

201
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,429
Everyday. What else should he do?
He's so lonely, no one understands him.

202
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,240
That pin head is the Sun?

203
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,872
May I?

204
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,752
Go on.

205
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,398
Nightly she sings on yon
pomegranate tree:

206
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,670
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale.

207
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,311
It was the lark,
the herald of the morn,

208
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,715
No nightingale:

209
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,555
Look, love, what envious streaks do lace
the severing clouds in yonder east:

210
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,158
Night's candles are burnt out,
and jocund day

211
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,474
Stands tiptoe on the misty
mountain tops.

212
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,071
Where's Herold?
- On duty. November?

213
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,758
Earth.

214
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,792
What day is it on Earth?

215
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,674
It was the 18th in the morning
and Christmas after lunch.

216
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,078
They must be celebrating
the New Year by now.

217
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,078
Time really flies.

218
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,349
It means I am as old
as my youngest sister.

219
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,199
Check!

220
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,158
It's strange anyway.

221
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,512
We're flying to Centauri.

222
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,871
Why hasn't anyone ever
flown to Earth.

223
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,072
Our solar system is of little interest.

224
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,078
Play.

225
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,877
Besides, it's too far from
the centre of the Galaxy.

226
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,709
26,000 light years.
Play!

227
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,551
You see, we're the backwoods
ofthe Universe.

228
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,118
Michael!

229
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,956
Are you looking at Alpha?

230
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,033
Yeah.

231
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,830
I come here often.

232
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,878
Do you think they're out there?

233
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,031
At least on one of the planets.
What do you think?

234
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,719
I can't believe that there's life
somewhere like on Earth.

235
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,277
I mean that we will land there,
get out from the ship,

236
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,313
and they will run to us,
waving their hands.

237
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,756
Maybe they don't have them.

238
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,276
What? Hands?

239
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,477
Do you know that Bernard
took his piano with him?

240
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,953
Why?

241
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,034
He was in some old music club
or something like that, you see.

242
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,277
Stop saying you see, you see!
Don't say it or else...

243
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,952
And stop doing this! Who's supposed
to look at it all the time!

244
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,718
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,354
I don't know what got into me.

246
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,998
No harm done.

247
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,239
When one looks at the same faces
for so many months...

248
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,312
That is why I summoned the Council.

249
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,756
We could not speak about Stephie's
pregnancy before.

250
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,799
The crew would become agitated.
It is a risky experiment.

251
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,679
None the less, it is essential
for future missions.

252
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,838
I should have been informed
as second-in-command.

253
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,675
Explain it to me.
- Stephie...

254
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,110
Stephie has been already
pregnant on Earth.

255
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,236
That means that my wife...

256
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,396
could have flown as well.

257
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,031
If she knew she could...

258
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,670
Why didn't you tell me?

259
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,239
Why?

260
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,356
Your wife knew it.

261
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,713
She was afraid.

262
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,311
It will be the first case in history.

263
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,114
No child has ever been born
under such circumstances.

264
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,470
Stephie is ten years younger.

265
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,956
That's why your wife
gave up her place.

266
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,988
Lightly.

267
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,872
Not so hard.

268
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,430
Something should happen.

269
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,796
It's taking too long.

270
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,037
Four months.

271
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,469
We're not even halfway there.

272
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,270
Where is everybody?

273
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,473
Isn't Kubes here somewhere?
- No.

274
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,035
Nobody has been here lately.

275
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,956
Why don't you call him
through the communicator?

276
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,753
This way, I can at least
take a short walk.

277
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,756
You're getting bored, eh?

278
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,394
It's Hopkins's birthday tomorrow.

279
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,193
Brigitte!

280
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,350
What's the matter?
- I don't know what to do.

281
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,391
I hadn't worn a skirt for four months
and now, just look at me!

282
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,158
Turn around!

283
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,398
Walk.

284
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,313
What did you expect!
It turned out really well.

285
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,796
Do you think he'll like it?

286
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,078
Anthony, let us now drink to Patrick!

287
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,668
So that you know that I didn't
really mean it then.

288
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,316
Patrick, that is...
- Herold. I am on my guard.

289
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,873
Shut up!
- Herold is here.

290
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,588
I am on my guard.
- What did you teach that robot?

291
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,280
I didn't. He learned it himself.

292
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,955
Will you dance?

293
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
I don't like dancing.
- Neither do I.

294
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,036
How are you feeling, Stephie?

295
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,956
Give my regards to Stephie.

296
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,959
When you come back,
I'll be older than you.

297
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,470
You won't like me.

298
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,916
When you come back.

299
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,952
I'm thirsty.

300
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,868
Oh no, I'm too old for this,
my child.

301
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,797
Eve will teach you.
- I will.

302
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,071
This jiggling is not for me.
- Jiggling, eh?

303
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,316
Nina, we...
You're a sociologist, aren't you?

304
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,953
We have...
- Some work for you.

305
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,913
A moral matter. - I see.
- And a social matter.

306
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,837
The thing is that she's
making fun of us.

307
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,234
Who?
- Brigitte.

308
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,870
At first, she kept obtruding.
- Obtruding? - Yes.

309
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,195
And now she doesn't want
to decide which of us to choose.

310
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,435
That's really interesting.
- It is, isn't it?

311
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,553
Oh yes. The reason may be that
she has a husband on Earth.

312
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,433
This is the Master Computer.

313
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,154
Report to your posts immediately!

314
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,230
Section commanders report
to your headquarters!

315
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,752
All officers report to
the navigation bridge!

316
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,554
An object of the 7th order detected

317
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,672
in the second safety zone!

318
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,875
Somebody turn that terrible noise off!

319
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,788
Distance?

320
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,239
309.

321
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,037
Angle 17.

322
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,118
It may be a comet.

323
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,197
Or a meteor.

324
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,875
It may belong to the Alpha Centauri
planetary system.

325
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,554
It's the first object from there.

326
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,716
What do you need, Anthony?

327
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,199
Time.

328
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,599
Here's your comet.

329
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,077
Composition: Iron, titanium, germanium
and traces of common elements.

330
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,432
Volume: 57,900 cubic metres.

331
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,109
Weight: 15,844 tons.

332
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,599
Alright, but...

333
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,075
And this is how it looks
from a close-up.

334
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,314
It contains organic substances.
- That's unbelievable.

335
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,919
And what about signals?
- No response so far.

336
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,837
Maybe it's an unmanned station.

337
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,512
No, it's a spacecraft. An automatic
station wouldn't be so large.

338
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,437
It seems primitive.

339
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,349
Just like Ikaria may seem primitive
to them. We know nothing about them.

340
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,674
Nothing at all.
- But why are they silent?

341
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,279
They have to see us.

342
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,678
I don't know.
Maybe they're afraid of us.

343
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,358
Afraid?

344
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,634
If they are afraid,
then they are similar to humans.

345
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,029
We can do more than to send
the Pythagorean proposition.

346
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,237
Prepare the explorer shuttle!

347
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,316
You can't be serious!

348
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,036
What do we have robots for?

349
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,396
What are they for?
- Wait.

350
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,675
Suppose there are living creatures
on that ship.

351
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,358
Just suppose...

352
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,996
What would we say if they came to us,
opened the door,

353
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,194
and out came a dozen machines.

354
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,677
How would you deal with them?

355
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,712
Try to understand that
there are things robots can't do.

356
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,836
Humans will be sent to that ship.

357
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,558
Two people.

358
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,116
Who do you propose?

359
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,518
Stand at attention, Erik.

360
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,838
Peter and me are entering into history.
And not only of mankind.

361
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,677
I've been in a similar situation once.

362
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,677
I understand.
- I wanted to give you advice.

363
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,872
You know more than the Master Computer.

364
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,674
I've always thought it didn't
exist any more.

365
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,358
What?

366
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,276
I don't know, but I envy you.

367
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,196
The explorer shuttle is ready.

368
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,909
Launch.

369
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,479
Launch complete.

370
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,676
Well?
- Everything's alright.

371
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,836
Activate screen transmission.

372
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,713
We'll keep on trying to establish
contact with the spaceship.

373
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,719
It's silent. They may have different
communication methods.

374
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,036
Maybe it's a wreck.

375
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,636
Do we have permission to land?

376
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,635
Guide the shuttle forlanding.

377
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,669
We are entering the craft.
There's vacuum here.

378
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,956
Do you see the material?

379
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,073
It looks like some sort
of aluminium alloy.

380
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,992
Prehistoric.

381
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,350
I thought we would find something
worthwhile here.

382
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,719
Look.

383
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,118
A number.
It's from Earth.

384
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,714
Nonsense, this can couldn't fly
out here.

385
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,032
Money?

386
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,710
Those are...
Those were humans.

387
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,750
We found humans, Captain Abayev.

388
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,279
Humans?

389
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,399
It's an ancient rocket from Earth.

390
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,556
From which century?

391
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,753
I don't know. Maybe the 20th
according to their clothes.

392
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,192
We found cigarettes, glass, paper.

393
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,471
The women are wearing jewellery.

394
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,680
They all died at the same moment.

395
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,395
How? How did they die?

396
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,788
I don't know.
Everything is intact.

397
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,158
They look as if they had fallen asleep.

398
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,398
Find out who they are
and how did they get out here.

399
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,073
You should have sent
an archaeologist instead.

400
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,319
Tigger, Tigger Fun.

401
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,111
Herold to Ikaria.

402
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,438
Find out what Tigger Fun means, Eve.

403
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,839
Look, Nina.

404
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,749
Tor-na-do.

405
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,075
Nineteen eighty seven.

406
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,270
Complete.
We have first data.

407
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,192
Master Computer.

408
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,511
Tigger Fun, also tiger breath.

409
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,155
Deadly poison with immediate effect.

410
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,756
Does not cause deterioration of objects.

411
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,480
The so-called clean weapon from
the end of the 20th century.

412
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,072
Tornado, a type of a military missile.

413
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,477
No further data available, stop.

414
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,998
They wanted to get to another planet.

415
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,038
Overthere. There's light there.

416
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,511
Caution, the ship still has power.
- That's not possible.

417
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,998
Why not? A reactor can work
a hundred years without operators.

418
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,678
A general.

419
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,072
He was in command.

420
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,396
There's two of them.

421
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,269
Look he has a back wound.

422
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,154
When they were running low on oxygen,
they killed the crew with Tigger Fun,

423
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,952
so that they would survive longer.

424
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,514
In the end, they fought one another.

425
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,392
Vultures.

426
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,359
I must be somewhere near the engines.
I'll find out.

427
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,070
What is it Kubes?
Answer!

428
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,671
Herold! Help Kubes, quick!
- The radioactivity level is increasing.

429
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,998
What happened, Kubes?
Answer!

430
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,591
At the right, that's
from Kubes's camera.

431
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,796
But that looks like...

432
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,555
You always get yourself into trouble.

433
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,351
My magnetic boot got caught.

434
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,035
Look, overthere!

435
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,315
Abandon the ship, quick!

436
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,551
There are nuclear weapons on board!

437
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,636
Don't touch anything!

438
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,510
Come on, hurry!

439
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,193
Send them the engine module,
Svenson.

440
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,829
Distance 3,458 kilometres.
- The shuttle is ready to lift off.

441
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,109
Don't stop!
Don't touch anything! Hurry!

442
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,678
Run!

443
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,555
We found people, Captain Abayev,
we found people.

444
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,351
We discovered the 20th century.

445
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,070
Would you send them there again?

446
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,596
If I knew there weren't
any humans there.

447
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,072
Humans...

448
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,196
They were our ancestors.

449
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,072
Not them.

450
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,918
Definitely not them!

451
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,315
You can't choose your ancestors.

452
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,837
You know who they were?

453
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,759
Human trash.

454
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,792
That left Auschwitz, Oradour

455
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,757
and Hiroshima behind them.

456
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,956
The 20th century.

457
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,518
Do you know it?

458
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,638
Honegger.

459
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,876
Also the 20th century.

460
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,515
We had to continue in our journey.

461
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:26,514
Svenson and Michael were to supervise
the installation of a reserve engine.

462
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,038
During such work they have to go out
into space on Ikaria's surface.

463
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,999
They weren't there long,
only some ten or fifteen minutes.

464
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,558
Under normal circumstances, this
would be an insignificant episode.

465
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:48,428
Thus, no one knew that this moment was
the beginning of lethal danger to us.

466
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,794
It entered into Ikaria with them.

467
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,434
How does it look out there, Erik?

468
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,991
Alright.
- The robots will do the rest.

469
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,035
That's Alpha Centauri.

470
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,870
There must be at least two planets
in the ecosphere.

471
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,996
In the sphere of life.

472
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,678
Do you think so?

473
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,633
I know, I calculated it.

474
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,629
Yet, the temperature will be high
on both the planets, like on our Venus.

475
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,557
But life could be there, because...

476
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,433
I'm not a prophet, I'm a mathematician.

477
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,393
We will find out in...
- In fifty-six days.

478
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,957
Precisely.

479
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,839
Milek...

480
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,438
It's normal.

481
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,356
Will you have a girl or a boy?

482
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,708
A boy.

483
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,913
How will you name him?

484
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,439
Wait.

485
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,118
Wait...

486
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,836
Do you know which name
is really nice?

487
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,158
Michael.

488
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,238
Anthony!

489
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,068
Anthony!

490
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,798
Listen.

491
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,795
A radio nebula.

492
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,719
Grandpa has caught a nebula again.

493
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,275
Golly, are we supposed
to survey every smudge?

494
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,392
Yes. Every single one.

495
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:56,038
Alert! Third deck! Lying person!
Non-responding person!

496
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,997
That can't be possible.

497
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,752
Alert! Non-responding person!

498
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,033
Who is it?
- Dead person! Dead person!

499
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,639
Michael.

500
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,513
Dead person! Dead person!

501
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,310
I...
I must have fallen asleep.

502
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,238
Well, well.

503
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,950
I was on my way from the observatory
and all of a sudden...

504
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,116
And that stupid computer thought...

505
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,914
Never mind the computer,
I thought so too.

506
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,956
Dead person on board.

507
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,357
And it will be surrounded
by a large garden.

508
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,436
Without paths?

509
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,710
There will be grass everywhere,
very high grass.

510
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,189
Report it next time or the computer
will take you as dead with no lunch.

511
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,676
I don't know how it could happen.

512
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,756
I knew one geologist once.

513
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,112
He fell asleep on an asteroid.

514
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,958
On asteroid 608.

515
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,232
Gosh, the whole zone was on alert
thinking he went missing.

516
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,115
At least 150 ships
were looking for him.

517
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,119
And I'm not counting unmanned crafts.

518
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,276
I will lie on my back

519
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,236
and look at the clouds.

520
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,278
Ants will be crawling on the grass.
- And it will start raining.

521
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,911
But we won't run for shelter, will we?
We will stay outside.

522
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,395
Raindrops will be running down our neck.

523
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,798
Erik!

524
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,716
I'm telling you I'm alright.

525
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,236
I've never needed this all my life.

526
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,994
And I'll never need it!
- Very well, go.

527
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,637
It is not a disease.

528
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,756
I'm doing what I can.

529
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,031
What about biological
separation from Earth?

530
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,312
That's out of the question nowadays.
- And time dilatation?

531
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,875
That's an abstract theory,
mathematical.

532
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,877
Will it continue?

533
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,953
Is it dead?
- Sleeping.

534
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,629
Stephie, honey,
what's wrong with you?

535
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,869
Nothing. Leave me alone.
- Do they know anything?

536
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,598
And the doctor?

537
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,116
What if the baby...

538
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,508
We did not know
what was happening to us.

539
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,315
We were not able to cope with it,

540
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,149
the fatigue, the drowsiness.

541
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,831
We were forced to activate
more and more automatons

542
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,270
to keep Ikaria running normally.

543
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,714
It was then when Hopkins revealed

544
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,311
that while focusing the telescope,

545
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,356
several stars kept disappearing
and reappearing.

546
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:44,439
There was something between them
and the Ikaria.

547
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,155
A gigantic body.

548
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,478
A Dark Star, to be more precise.

549
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,873
We didn't have the slightest idea
of its existence until then.

550
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,519
It came to light that the nature
of its radiation...

551
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,238
The nature ofits radiation
is simply beyond anything we know.

552
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,954
It is certain that its radiation causes

553
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,992
attenuation of biochemical processes
in living organisms.

554
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,273
Inducing fatigue and drowsiness.
- Where is it?

555
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,876
How long will the effect last?

556
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,912
We don't know that.
Or do we?

557
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:30,911
Here are 14,000 metres of reports from
labs, the observatory, astrobiologists.

558
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,557
Some of them are the first of their
kind and Earth has no idea about them.

559
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,310
What now?
Will we send them to Earth?

560
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,958
What for? Why should we worry
them for nothing?

561
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,436
But what if we don't come back?

562
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,518
Nonsense.

563
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:55,318
It's hard to believe that a star
could affect the fate of our mission.

564
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,433
But Earth knows nothing
about the Dark Star.

565
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,112
The next mission would
encounter it again.

566
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,037
It will be better if we do it.
- Alright.

567
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,789
In the old days, castaways
used to throw bottles into the sea.

568
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,556
We will send a module.

569
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,355
Yet are we castaways?

570
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,119
Try to understand, if we all fall asleep
it will take decades

571
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,153
before people get there,
where we are right now.

572
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,630
We're not on a holiday cruise!

573
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,999
Each of us knew what he was in for!
- Stop yelling.

574
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:16,719
Alert! Second deck!
Non-responding person, dead person!

575
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,031
I want tough men here.
That's all.

576
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,515
You can't blame anyone for this.

577
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,989
I know, but...

578
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,550
Those who want, will survive.

579
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,916
And those who don't...

580
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,198
Michael.

581
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,910
When I know that it's a disease,

582
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,033
that it has a name,
I will respect it.

583
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,913
Until then, it doesn't exist for us.

584
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,552
Is that clear?

585
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,354
They insisted that nothing new

586
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:24,156
could be discovered in the Universe.

587
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,353
They've been proclaiming that
for 300 years.

588
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,112
Fools.

589
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,872
But it can.

590
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,032
It can.

591
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,473
Why...
Why couldn't it.

592
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,513
Anthony!

593
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,038
How long will it take us
to get out of this?

594
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,515
Anthony! Do you hear me?

595
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,198
Sixty hours.

596
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,072
And then?

597
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,352
And then?

598
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,198
I don't know what will happen then.

599
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,879
Will we wake up?
Do you believe it?

600
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,230
I believe it.
- It's not about belief.

601
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,360
Belief is nothing.
Belief is a mere word.

602
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,630
Tell me how to endure.

603
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,953
Tell me when and how will we wake up.

604
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,437
What is the probability, what certainty.
That's my belief. Understand?

605
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,679
Prepare for 60 hours of sleep.

606
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,716
Is that all we know?

607
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,272
Where are you going?

608
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,796
To get the Ikaria back.

609
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,836
You think I'm afraid.

610
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,554
No, I'm not afraid.

611
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,678
Honestly.

612
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,558
I'd just...

613
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,510
I'd just love to hear

614
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,871
those words, you know.

615
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,915
That we made up together.

616
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,595
Nobody knows them here.

617
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,715
Nobody knows that...

618
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,039
I am your twinklet.
And your...

619
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,919
No, I really don't have to be brave.

620
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,760
I will only fall asleep.

621
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,953
You will hear me when I wake up.

622
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,036
It may take long before you find us.

623
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,996
Maybe you won't...

624
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:33,594
No, you will hear me.

625
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,159
One day...
You will hear me.

626
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,476
I am glad I went on this mission.

627
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,192
Only those sweet words.

628
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:03,039
Those words you made up for me

629
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,589
that nobody knew here.

630
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,233
Master Computer.
Message for Earth recorded.

631
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,116
I will get her back.

632
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,191
She will fly alone.

633
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,750
Back to the Sun.

634
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,792
They will find her.

635
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,956
I must get her back.

636
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,438
MacDonald!

637
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,236
You don't have the right.

638
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,876
You don't have the right!
Do you understand?

639
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,716
This is our last chance.

640
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,710
I want to save the Ikaria.

641
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,038
But we will wake up.

642
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,198
Believe it.

643
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,669
We will wake up.

644
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,479
Master Computer proceeds with
the autoregulation process.

645
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,070
End of first shift.
Second shift unmanned.

646
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,991
Attention, third shift must intake
the vitamin condensate.

647
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,191
Do not take fruit.

648
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,756
Anthony.

649
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,556
Anthony.

650
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,993
End of third shift.
First shift unmanned.

651
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,517
Master Computer proceeds with
the autoregulation process.

652
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,958
Normal regime.

653
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,552
Good morning.

654
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,556
Everything is alright.

655
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,038
It isn't.

656
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,948
We slept only twenty-five hours.

657
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,832
Not sixty.

658
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,758
Eve!

659
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,798
Stephie!

660
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,198
Stephie.

661
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,588
That's the only explanation.

662
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,918
Some kind of a force field was generated
between the Ikaria and the Dark Star.

663
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,234
Eat!

664
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,318
A force field that intercepted
the radiation.

665
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,000
That's why we woke up earlier.
- Eat, Anthony.

666
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,354
What?
- Eat!

667
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,789
I think there must be
a more simple explanation.

668
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,480
Our organism simply
got accustomed to it.

669
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:12,149
Accustomed? It got accustomed to
radiation in just a few hours, eh?

670
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,476
Perhaps your organism did.

671
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,833
Mine can't even get used
to this mash all the way.

672
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,998
You'll suffer with avitaminosis.
- Beware, though.

673
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,636
Where did the force field
that protected us come from?

674
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,871
Maybe it's just a coincidence, Anthony.

675
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,109
Coincidence?

676
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,193
Coincidence exists among us humans,
but not among the stars.

677
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,152
Finish your meal.

678
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,398
The main thing is we got out of it
without consequences.

679
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,752
Just imagine mankind would have sent
Ikaria on this mission without a crew.

680
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,036
It would be on her way back.

681
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,475
The automatons would have
turned it back.

682
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,519
Fortunately, man is not as perfect
as a machine.

683
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,598
Therefore, he has nothing left than
to hope and believe.

684
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,992
Blood circulation disorders.

685
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,788
Functional disorders of the higher
nervous system.

686
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,438
Will you get him out of it?

687
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,878
I don't know. It's not a disease, not in
the earthly sense of the word at least.

688
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,236
It is...
- The second stage?

689
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,358
The effect of the Dark Star's radiation.
- It means we're all in this together.

690
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,354
No. Erik was exposed to direct
radiation when installing the engine.

691
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,829
And where is Michael?
They were both out there.

692
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,678
Where's Michael?
- I don't know.

693
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,119
Have you seen him?

694
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,391
Was Michael here?
- No. What's the matter?

695
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,873
Have you seen Michael?

696
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,755
Navigation bride, find Michael!

697
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,835
You aren't afraid, are you?

698
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,632
It's not that bad.

699
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,915
We only fell asleep.

700
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,352
But those two outside,
they were fully exposed.

701
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,400
To the radiation of the Dark Star,
understand?

702
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,832
We were protected by Ikaria's shield,
we are alright.

703
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,680
We are. But what about him?

704
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,832
Michael is in the corridor on deck zero.

705
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,110
What is he doing there?
- I'll have a look.

706
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,558
Michael!

707
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,954
Michael.

708
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,392
What are you doing here?

709
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,798
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone!

710
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,920
Come with us.
- You're sick.

711
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,032
Leave me here.

712
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,633
I'm dead.

713
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,396
We will all die,
but I don't want to die!

714
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,318
I don't want to go with you!

715
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,073
No!

716
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,118
Michael!

717
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,636
Deck zero closed.
Alert! Alert!

718
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,874
Block the access
to the explorer shuttles!

719
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,956
Michael wants to return to Earth.

720
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,918
Where is he?

721
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,236
He destroyed his transmitter.

722
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,712
Michael, do you hear me!

723
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,349
Stop, we want to help you!
- He's coming back.

724
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,913
I can't see him now.

725
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,196
He's at the robot station.

726
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,837
He deactivated the robots.

727
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,836
But that means we're done.

728
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,155
He doesn't know, what he's doing.

729
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,279
He can destroy the cooling system.

730
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,960
Emergency mode.
- Or the oxygen regenerators.

731
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,638
For all zones!

732
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,798
We must get to him.

733
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,078
But how?
- I might have a solution.

734
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,791
More to the left.
- To the left.

735
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,995
Retreat, Patrick!
- He has a blaster.

736
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,119
Abayev!

737
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,673
Abayev!
- What is it?

738
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,312
I can't see it.

739
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,948
I can't see it.
- What, Michael?

740
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,912
Earth.

741
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,110
We will be there soon.

742
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,312
Don't lie!

743
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,632
Earth is gone.

744
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,070
Earth never existed!

745
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,999
Michael!

746
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,476
Halt, Michael!

747
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,073
Michael!

748
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,634
I'll get to him. - How?
- Through the air shafts.

749
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,870
Will it work? - It will.
- But... - I constructed them.

750
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,634
Be on guard, he has a blaster.
- I know.

751
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,068
I'm going with you.
- Better not.

752
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,549
It's not for two...
You'd only hold me back.

753
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,474
It's the only way to save him.

754
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,552
And maybe even us.

755
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,996
I'll be back in an hour.

756
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,952
What is he doing?

757
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,230
Michael! Listen to me.

758
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,553
Michael!

759
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,513
Michael!

760
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,793
Michael!

761
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,916
There's no other signal.

762
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,477
We will wait then.

763
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,911
We have travelled billions
of kilometres.

764
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,313
We are almost at the end
of our journey.

765
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,996
Give it to Stephie.
- What?

766
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,273
In memory of you?
- No, to safe keep it for me.

767
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,751
Look what it did to their spacesuits.

768
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,273
And they were outside
only ten minutes.

769
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,596
Burnt by the radiation.

770
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,313
Will you save him?

771
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,793
I will.

772
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,631
I will save him.

773
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,468
A pebble.

774
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,959
It's from their garden.

775
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,236
When do you expect the baby?

776
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,795
He must be there by now.

777
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,433
Michael.

778
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,672
Do you hear me?

779
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,830
I came for you.
Listen.

780
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,235
You blocked the robot station.

781
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,794
You're threatening our lives,
the whole ship.

782
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,275
You're sick, understand?

783
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,550
You're just sick.

784
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,315
You must come with me,
you'll get better.

785
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,389
Are you listening to me?
Michael?

786
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,350
You do want to return to Earth
with us, don't you!

787
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,032
Earth is gone.

788
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,240
Earth is gone.
- Earth is there, Michael.

789
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:55,436
It's far away, but it's there.

790
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,230
Why don't you let me go back then!

791
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,000
I want so see it.
- So do I, Michael.

792
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,075
We all do. That's why you have
to let me in the robot station.

793
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,913
That's why you have to get better.
- I can't go on any more.

794
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,911
I don't want to go with you.

795
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,197
Give me the explorer shuttle.
I'll go back.

796
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,750
Tell them, go.

797
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,076
I'm not going without you.

798
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,952
Go or I'll...

799
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,636
You'd kill a human.

800
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,998
A human.

801
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,793
No!

802
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:56,352
Come now, let's go.

803
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,955
Do you know you destroyed
Hopkins's Patrick?

804
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,116
Don't forget to apologise to him.

805
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,912
Will they save him?

806
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,756
It's that nebula again.

807
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,438
How is Stephie?

808
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,994
Go to the observatory, you're
no help here anyway.

809
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,071
I know, but just in case...

810
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,956
Is the baby born?

811
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,188
Well?

812
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,878
Not yet.

813
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,478
Go to the observatory, you're
no help here anyway.

814
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,229
Anthony.

815
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:13,198
That force field is moving along
with the Ikaria, Anthony.

816
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,711
We're enclosed in it
like a ship in a bottle.

817
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,193
And that.

818
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,710
Those radar signals

819
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,199
are no nebulae.

820
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,072
What are they then?

821
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,473
I... we don't know.

822
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,160
How about Saint Peter,
you haven't discovered him yet?

823
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,069
That surprises me.
Let's have a look at it.

824
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,437
I would like to introduce
our new crew member.

825
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,109
The assumption
that it was a radio nebula,

826
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,552
was quite logical.

827
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,316
Yet fallacious.

828
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,836
In fact,

829
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,956
it is an energy transmitter.

830
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,718
What transmitter?

831
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,718
As soon as we entered the sphere
of the Dark Star,

832
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,473
it located us.

833
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,875
Enclosing us in a force field

834
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,559
that shielded the Ikaria
from radiation.

835
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,914
But that means...
Anthony!

836
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,270
There's life on the White Planet!

837
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,512
Do you hear me?

838
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:55,599
Yes. I know.
- Anthony!

839
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,756
That's it.

840
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,390
The White Planet.

841
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,232
A world of beings that helped us,

842
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,876
when we encountered the Dark Star.

843
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,833
We set out into the Universe
to discover life,

844
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,228
while life discovered us.

845
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:22,312
Master Computer proceeds
with the flight regulation process.

846
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:28,910
Entry into orbit from the original
trajectory in nine minutes.

847
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,835
Attention,
entry into orbit in nine minutes.

848
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,560
Explorer shuttles ready.

849
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:43,359
In an hour, we will be standing on...

850
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,196
No, not on earth.

851
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,032
On...
Perhaps on grass.

852
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,829
Or...
I don't know.

853
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,553
In an hour.
