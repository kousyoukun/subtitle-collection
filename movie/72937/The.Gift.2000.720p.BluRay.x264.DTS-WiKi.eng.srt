1
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:43,054
Oh, thank you. They're pretty peaches.

2
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:46,530
Yes, ma'am.         So, how you been ?

3
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:49,626
I'm pretty good, I reckon.

4
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,438
You had any health problems since I saw you last ?

5
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,408
Ma'am ?         Have you been sick ?

6
00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:01,174
Well, back's been hurtin' a little.

7
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,580
No, no, it's not your back.

8
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:06,590
Have you been bleeding somewhere ?

9
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:15,384
Yes, ma'am, a little.         Yeah.

10
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:21,753
Have you been to a doctor ?         Oh, I

11
00:04:21,753 --> 00:04:24,813
I don't much like going to no doctors.

12
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:28,246
Well, I think maybe you should go.

13
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:30,932
No, it's not a venereal disease.

14
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:32,971
I just think it's some kind of kidney or some bladder infection.

15
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:37,049
But it's been around for a while.

16
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:39,485
Could lead to some more serious problems.

17
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:42,384
Do you want me to call a doctor for you ?

18
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,120
All right.         Okay.

19
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:53,065
You kids get on to bed now. It's nearly 9.:00.

20
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,216
Ah, Mama, can I stay up just a little bit ?

21
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,413
No. You heard me, mister.

22
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,236
Mama ?         Hmm ?

23
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:07,507
What does ''fuck'' mean ?

24
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:11,531
It's a bad word, hon, for something nice.

25
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:13,910
But what does it mean ?

26
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:16,823
Well, it means making love.

27
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:19,015
It's how your daddy and me made your brothers and you.

28
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:24,428
Take his turtles off, hon.

29
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:28,499
Mike, did you hear me ?         What ?

30
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:29,623
I said get to bed.

31
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:36,927
Oh, Mike, your lip's dragging the floor.

32
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:38,488
It's gonna freeze like that.

33
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,924
You act like I'm a kid.

34
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,106
You are a kid, honey.

35
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:42,330
Valerie, you may as well take your glasses off.

36
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,797
I know he's been hitting you again.

37
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:49,700
I see your lip.         Oh, no.

38
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:52,501
Oh, it it just embarrasses me.

39
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:55,304
It's okay.

40
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,470
Come on.

41
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:03,576
He got worse.

42
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:06,984
I went to the store yesterday 'cause we's out of some things.

43
00:07:07,224 --> 00:07:11,554
And he got home from work early, before I could get back.

44
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:15,861
He was waiting with a razor strap. My legs are all cut up.

45
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:20,593
And I got welts the size of footballs on my back and my legs.

46
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,604
I feel guilty, you payin' me money to tell you to get away from him.

47
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:26,608
You got to get help.

48
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:31,736
Legal help.         You don't know Donnie Barksdale.

49
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:34,247
He'll kill me if I leave him. He'll find me.

50
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:36,443
He said he would.

51
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:44,958
No, he's not crazy enough to kill anybody.

52
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:48,484
He's just an insecure redneck.

53
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,592
What ?

54
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:57,664
I think he's got a woman on the side.

55
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,934
Yeah, he's been laying out at night.

56
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,508
Excuse me, but the school's on the phone.

57
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,742
They say Mike's in some kind of trouble.

58
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,730
Mrs. Wilson.

59
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:33,262
Hi. Come on in. Have a seat.

60
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,367
Uh, where where's Mike ?         He's in the infirmary.

61
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:39,414
Now, it's nothing to get worked up about. He's fine.

62
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,881
He's got a few, um Sit down.

63
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:44,884
He's got a few, uh, nicks and bruises.

64
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:48,819
I think he might have a have a pretty good black eye by tomorrow.

65
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,825
But he's, uh he's okay.

66
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:54,088
He was in another fight ?         Yes, he was.

67
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,822
His grades are, uh are getting worse too. How's he doing at home ?

68
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:04,892
Um, not much better. He's real distant.

69
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,533
Mmhmm. Well, Mrs. Wilson,

70
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:09,975
I don't pretend to be a psychologist, but, um,

71
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:13,343
it's obvious to me that your boy's got a lot of anger in him.

72
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:22,713
Well, um, it's about this time last year his daddy passed away.

73
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,918
He's still real messed up over it.

74
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:28,859
Yeah. I never knew your husband. I understand he was a fine man.

75
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,922
Yes, he was.

76
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,828
Well, I don't know how you feel about therapy, but, uh

77
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:38,685
If you think Mike needs somebody to talk to,

78
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:40,102
I know a gentleman over

79
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,558
Mike doesn't need a therapist, Mr. Collins.

80
00:09:41,558 --> 00:09:43,140
He can talk to me.

81
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,584
Do you think he will, though ?

82
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:52,982
I'm sorry, Wayne. I didn't know you had anybody in here.

83
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:54,903
Oh, hi. Um         Ruby wasn't at her desk.

84
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:58,233
Yeah, she's out sick today. Uh, Mrs. Wilson, this is Jessica King,

85
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,239
my fiancee.         Nice to meet you.

86
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,001
You too.

87
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,737
We're just going to be a couple of minutes. Okay.

88
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,475
Uh, I gotta go anyway. I got people waiting.

89
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:13,276
Thanks a lot, Mr. Collins.

90
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:16,914
I'm real sorry about all this.         Oh, it's my job.

91
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,924
He's just a boy, that's all.

92
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:25,086
You're not that Wilson that's a fortuneteller, are you ?

93
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,996
I don't call myself that.

94
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:30,000
I'd love you to read my fortune.         I'm pretty booked up.

95
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:32,469
Do you think we'll live happily ever after ?

96
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,490
What's the matter?

97
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,832
You see something bad ?

98
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,463
Of course not.

99
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,029
No, I'm sure you'll be real happy together.

100
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:35,898
Hey, how you gettin' along today ?         I'm fine, Buddy.

101
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:40,063
Except the fact I can't keep my car door from just flying right open.

102
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:42,471
Have you got the time to fix it ?

103
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:46,806
III can get to it, uh, about an hour or two.

104
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:48,837
Uh, you wanna wait ?

105
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,077
Uh, no. Uh, I got to get home. I got people coming.

106
00:11:52,153 --> 00:11:53,982
Hey, you just want you just wanna leave it here,

107
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:56,021
and I'll I'll carry you on home ?

108
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:59,182
I can have it to you by probably by 6:00. That gonna be all right ?

109
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:03,091
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.         All right. All right.

110
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:05,062
Buddy ?         Yeah ?

111
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:08,190
Uh, I'm a little I'm a little low on my money this week.

112
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,895
I was just wondering if        Don't you worry about No, really.

113
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:13,563
No, stop it. Oh, come on, look.         I feel bad.

114
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:16,370
For all that you've done for me,

115
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,069
I just I just think the world of you.

116
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,644
You're about the only one I call a friend to me.

117
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,486
Thank you.

118
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:30,113
Yeah, you know. Annie.

119
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:32,453
I'll get the truck.

120
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:34,618
Take your time.

121
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:43,101
How you been, Buddy ?

122
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:48,069
I've been having some, uh some bad thoughts lately.

123
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:51,007
But I, you know Yesterday, I was feeling so happy.

124
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:53,376
Yeah ?         I was feeling on top of the world.

125
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:55,438
Good on you.

126
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:59,143
III didn't even feel like I needed my medicine.

127
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,345
I took it anyway.

128
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:05,185
You know, I'm getting I'm getting hooked on that stuff.

129
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,657
Well, I think you're gonna have a lot of happy days, Buddy.

130
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:12,928
Yeah, you're gonna get better and better.

131
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,990
Well, uh, I believe you when you say so.

132
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,202
Buddy ?

133
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:25,641
Honey ?

134
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,613
Honey, what's wrong ?

135
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:40,421
You have to tell me. You have to tell me now.

136
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:43,190
I'll I'll tell you, hon.

137
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,563
If I look into a blue diamond...

138
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:52,434
and I think a negative thought,

139
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,042
am I gonna die ?

140
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:59,237
No.

141
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,575
Mmmmm. You're not gonna die.

142
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,048
You're not gonna die, Buddy.

143
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:12,448
Oh, my God ! Oh, my God ! Oh, my God !

144
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:15,017
Oh, look

145
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:18,085
Okay. Well, thank you. 'Cause if you had said ''yes,''

146
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,155
I would have to kill myself before the sun goes down.

147
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:25,066
Oh, Buddy. Oh, honey.

148
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,300
You don't have to kill yourself, honey.

149
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:31,207
You know I'll always tell you.         Oh, man.

150
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,540
I'll always tell you, Buddy.         Oh, man.

151
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:38,014
You're fine. You can always talk to me, Buddy. Always.

152
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,245
Oh, don't use that, honey.         I feel embarrassed.

153
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:43,445
No. Here. Huh ?         Oh, no.

154
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:46,491
I can't soil that.         Buddy, I want you to have it.

155
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:50,618
This one's Ben's. I don't         He'd want you to have it.

156
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:53,097
Thank you. Thank you.

157
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:55,690
You all right ?         Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

158
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,668
All right.         All right.

159
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,535
II can walk home. You don't have to drive me. You can

160
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:06,735
No, no. No, I'm I'm good. I'm good.

161
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,337
Yeah ? You sure scared me, hon.         Oh, yeah.

162
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:11,576
No, I'm all right. I'm all right.

163
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:15,245
All right. You just take it nice and slow.

164
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:20,147
Nice and slow.

165
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,582
Could I help you ?

166
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:28,786
Yes, ma'am. I'm Donnie Barksdale.

167
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,773
I'm sorry to bother you so late,

168
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:33,261
but I believe you know my wife Valerie.

169
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:36,732
Yes, I do. I know who you are.

170
00:16:36,804 --> 00:16:39,168
Can I come in and talk to you ?

171
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,695
It's about my wife. Something's happened to her.

172
00:16:44,412 --> 00:16:48,640
What's happened ? She okay ?

173
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:51,877
Well, no, she's not, ma'am.

174
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,677
Ma'am, I promise. I'll just take a minute.

175
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:01,118
All right. Come on.

176
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:21,942
What's happened is she's getting her head filled full of shit...

177
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:24,411
by a goddamn Satan worshipper.

178
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:28,349
Or a damn good con artist, one of the two.

179
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:32,480
I know she's been coming over to see you and your damn voodoo.

180
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,526
You tell her bad things about me, don't you ?

181
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:40,190
You ain't no better than a Jew or a nigger.

182
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,842
Do you know what this is ?

183
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:57,872
It's a voodoo doll.

184
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:02,918
I'm going to use this voodoo doll on you, some of your own medicine.

185
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:05,286
If you don't stop seeing my wife,

186
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,519
I'm stickin' me a pin in this thing every night...

187
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:10,898
till you learn to leave folks alone.

188
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,955
Go back to bed. Everything's fine.

189
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:21,836
I bet you love those little children, don't you ?

190
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,899
And I bet they need their mama, don't they ?

191
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:28,444
What's your name ?         Get your ass out of my house !

192
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:31,880
Don't you threaten me or my kids. Now, what I do here is my business.

193
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:34,350
If your wife has any sense, she'll leave you so far behind,

194
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:35,820
you'll never find her.

195
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,856
Now you get out of here before I have you thrown in jail.

196
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,424
Messing with the Devil is gonna get you burned.

197
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,493
Everybody knows that.

198
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:55,533
I'll see you soon, boys.

199
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,012
Go back to bed. Come on.

200
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:23,288
Something smells like cat pee.         It's perfume, Ben.

201
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,837
And you're not supposed to cuss in front of appointments.

202
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:27,873
Something smells like cat pee. Something smells like cat pee.

203
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,874
Something smells like cat pee.         Be quiet!

204
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:33,741
He's got a great sense of humor.

205
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,507
Oh, he loves you.

206
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:42,575
Valerie. Oh, honey, yyou know, you shouldn't be here.

207
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,790
I'm sorry about the other night.

208
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,760
Oh, that's okay. I can take care of myself.

209
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:53,354
And I hate coming over here, but

210
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:59,027
I really need to talk to you.

211
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,769
Maybe you could read for me. Under a bridge or something.

212
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:09,540
All right, I'll read for you. But you got to start listening to me.

213
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:12,412
I can't leave him. Don't you understand ?

214
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:16,783
Hon, he's gonna keep hurting you till he puts you in the hospital.

215
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,915
I don't have anything to look forward to.

216
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:21,789
Maybe you can give me some hope.

217
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,624
Oh, Valerie, hon, I don't know how to make myself any clearer

218
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:27,358
Valerie!         Oh, Annie ! Annie, it's him ! No !

219
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,367
Calm down. I'll call the law.         No. No.

220
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,903
No, Annie, no ! If you're my friend, you won't ! No !

221
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:36,697
I'll deal with you later, you goddamn bitch !

222
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,903
You witch !

223
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,378
Get your ass in the truck !

224
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,778
That ain't fast enough !

225
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:49,045
I told you not to come here!

226
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:53,647
You let her go !         All right ! All right !

227
00:20:55,763 --> 00:20:59,456
Get in !         Mike, you stay there !

228
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,625
What did I fucking tell you ?

229
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,725
All right ! Ow ! Ow !

230
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:10,098
Sweet Jesus.

231
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:16,507
Mike ? Y'all bring Miss Francis her clothes.

232
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:21,848
Thanks, hon.

233
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,654
Granny.

234
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,892
Hey, Annabelle.

235
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:41,701
Gran Granny, what are you doing here ?

236
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:43,867
I brought you some persimmons, hon.

237
00:21:43,945 --> 00:21:47,742
Remember how you liked persimmons when you was little ?

238
00:21:49,884 --> 00:21:52,714
Granny, you're not supposed to be here.

239
00:21:52,753 --> 00:21:54,776
How How'd you get here ?

240
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,219
Oh, it ain't far to walk.

241
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:03,018
That boy's got your granddaddy's eyes.

242
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:09,527
Well, hon,

243
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,695
I better get back.

244
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:14,795
Looks like there's a storm coming.

245
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:18,172
No, Granny, it it's clear.

246
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:36,623
Annie, always use your instinct, honey.

247
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:59,640
* I've been asleep when teardrops come to stay *

248
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,277
* It hurts me, but I know *

249
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:05,920
*** It's just my sentimental way ******

250
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:09,585
Now you tell Miss Francis I'll be home by 9:30, okay ?

251
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:11,925
Bring back something.         All right, I promise.

252
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:14,557
I love you too, Mama.         I know. And I love you too, hon.

253
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:17,226
Be good. Bye.         Bye, Mama.

254
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:19,760
You ready ?

255
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,033
I don't know why I let you talk me into this.

256
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,667
'Cause it's time you quit living like a nun, that's why.

257
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:28,268
Don't worry. You're going to be the prettiest girl here, next to me.

258
00:23:28,516 --> 00:23:30,845
You still a married man ?

259
00:23:30,918 --> 00:23:33,646
I don't know about that.

260
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:37,778
Oh, thank you.         Thank you very much.

261
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:41,052
Do we pay him now or         Uhuh. I sign for it later.

262
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,219
Is it good ?

263
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:46,797
Annie, there he is.         Who ?

264
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:50,027
That guy I That guy I was telling you about. Look at him.

265
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:54,002
He's right over there by the bar. Don't he look like Antonio Banderas?

266
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:57,599
Oh, my God ! He saw me ! Shit ! He saw me staring at him.

267
00:23:57,678 --> 00:24:02,871
All right, get your cards out. Tell me if he's gonna come over here.

268
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,939
I don't have my cards with me. I am offduty.

269
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,042
Hello, Mrs. Wilson.

270
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:10,780
It's Annie.         Sit down. You're blocking my view.

271
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,620
Sorry. You remember Jessica ?         Hi, Annie.

272
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:18,356
I didn't know you were a member of the country club.

273
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,656
I'm not. I kind of tagged along with Linda.

274
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:25,327
How nice. It's a great outfit.         Thank you.

275
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:27,234
What's Mike up to tonight ?

276
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,300
Moping around his babysitters.

277
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:31,808
Yeah ? He's He's a great kid.

278
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:34,641
I was actually thinking you should have him come down to school and

279
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:37,704
Come on, Wayne. Let's not talk shop tonight, all right ?

280
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:39,808
Let's just have fun.         Okay.

281
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:42,683
Hi there, funseekers.         Hey, there.

282
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:45,917
How about a dance with Daddy ?         Of course I will, handsome.

283
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:53,660
Mr. King, I don't know if you know, uh, Annie Wilson.

284
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:57,667
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think I've seen you at church.

285
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,389
That is quite a dress, Miss Linda.

286
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,604
I'm glad somebody noticed.

287
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:06,131
You want to give it a try ?         Oh, no. No, I don't think so.

288
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,407
No, thank you.

289
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:11,341
Come on. I asked you to dance, not walk on hot coals.

290
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:14,146
When was the last time you danced ?

291
00:25:14,188 --> 00:25:16,881
I think it's so long, I've forgotten how to do it.

292
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:21,117
Well, I'll make you look good then, 'cause I'm a terrible dancer.

293
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:24,821
Wayne.

294
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:27,297
I'll dance.

295
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:32,026
Good luck.         Yeah.

296
00:25:32,106 --> 00:25:35,266
Missed your big chance.

297
00:25:41,382 --> 00:25:46,337
*** Well, I'm doin'my best not to open with ''I love you''******

298
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:58,427
Thank you.

299
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,913
Somebody might come in here.

300
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,744
I guess you better fuck me fast.

301
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:33,954
You having a good time ?

302
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:39,232
Me neither.

303
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:46,403
You seen Jessica around?

304
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:52,309
She up and disappeared on me again. She's got a way of doing that.

305
00:26:55,823 --> 00:27:00,222
What do you think of Jessica ?         She's She's very beautiful.

306
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:03,953
Yeah, the main thing about her, she's just...

307
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:06,429
so full of life.

308
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:09,297
We're a little different in that respect.

309
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,268
Oh. I'm used to tennis shoes.

310
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,501
This kind of reminds me when I was a kid.

311
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:23,942
I'd sit out on that porch.

312
00:27:23,984 --> 00:27:27,144
I'd have so many thoughts, just couldn't count 'em.

313
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:29,244
How'd you wind up in Brixton ?

314
00:27:29,323 --> 00:27:32,289
My husband. He got a job here at the cable plant.

315
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,449
Right.

316
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,165
What ?

317
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:45,427
Did Did you know...

318
00:27:45,506 --> 00:27:48,835
something was going to happen to your husband ?

319
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:54,835
In an E.S.P. kind of way ?

320
00:27:57,484 --> 00:28:01,382
Well, I don't know         You don't believe in it.

321
00:28:04,191 --> 00:28:06,282
I don't know. I guess I just

322
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:10,586
I don't believe there are any great mysteries in life.

323
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:13,820
I kind of figure what you see is what you get.

324
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:24,503
I didn't know that there was going to be an explosion.

325
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:28,478
But... the night before, I had this real bad,

326
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,606
bad dream, you know.

327
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,544
I dreamt that I was all by myself. That Ben

328
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:37,315
He wasn't around anymore and...

329
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:40,515
tried to stop him going to work the next day, but

330
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:47,195
So you can't keep a good man from work, right ?

331
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,529
You kind of remind me of him.

332
00:28:59,313 --> 00:29:01,938
Wayne ?

333
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:05,380
I've been looking for you.         I've been right here.

334
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:09,980
I see.

335
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:17,292
Let's go talk to Daddy. He's feeling real depressed tonight.

336
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:19,227
That big deal he's working on went bad.

337
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,289
Oh, we got a major crisis here, Annie. Excuse us ?

338
00:29:23,404 --> 00:29:25,494
Okay.         Bye.

339
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,599
See you later, alligator.

340
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,308
In a while, crocodile.         Good night, boys.

341
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:34,402
Go to sleep for Mama.

342
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:38,209
What's that, hon ?         Blueberry muffins.

343
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:40,580
Whatcha doin' with muffins in your pockets ?

344
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,882
Miss Francis cooked them.

345
00:29:42,957 --> 00:29:45,150
Yeah, but what are they doing in your pockets ?

346
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:49,214
They're in my pockets 'cause I put 'em there when she wasn't looking...

347
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:51,421
so I didn't have to eat them.

348
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:55,488
Her blueberry muffins is terrible.

349
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:01,237
Uh, y'all wait here a minute. Take Ben, hon.

350
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:33,651
When God's fighting for you, every soldier's important.

351
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,689
When God's fighting for you, every soldier's important.

352
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,168
God does not give one to the Devil.

353
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:41,568
If every child of God obeyed God,

354
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:43,574
the Devil cannot wipe you out.

355
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:45,803
He cannot take you out before your time.

356
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:47,808
If you obey God, I don't care what the Devil...

357
00:31:48,015 --> 00:31:52,538
has placed upon your life, Jesus can deliver you.

358
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,279
Jesus came to bring you out of your prison house.

359
00:31:56,356 --> 00:32:00,255
Mama, is everything okay ?         Yeah, everything's fine.

360
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:04,055
You sure ?         Yeah. Time for you to go to bed.

361
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,098
I know him. He's a squirrelhunting buddy of mine.

362
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,624
But II don't think that Donnie         I'm telling you it was him.

363
00:32:13,707 --> 00:32:16,832
What makes you think he'd want to bust into your house ?

364
00:32:17,077 --> 00:32:20,100
Well, his wife, she's a client of mine,

365
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,270
and he thinks I'm trying to break up their marriage.

366
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,680
Are you ?

367
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:29,378
Listen, um, Donnie's highstrung.

368
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:32,184
Uh, you know, ain't no doubt about that.

369
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,748
But I don't think he's the one that busted into your house.

370
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:38,260
Listen, I appreciate the coffee and everything. Take care.

371
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,237
I just can't get through a wall of some kind in my head...

372
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,435
or, uh or my soul.

373
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,878
Sometimes I don't even know the difference...

374
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:59,208
between my head or my soul.

375
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:01,878
I think everybody has that trouble, Buddy.

376
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,785
All right.

377
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,297
Your daddy

378
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:19,233
He took things away from you when you

379
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:21,637
when you were a little boy.

380
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,640
Do you understand that ?

381
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:33,779
He He seen me playing around with something, like a toy or something,

382
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:36,877
he'd just take it away from me.

383
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:39,612
Did he take other things away from you ?

384
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:48,457
Buddy

385
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:50,626
You got to find out, hon,

386
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:53,932
why you hate him so much.

387
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:57,402
My daddy's a good man. I don't hate my dad.

388
00:33:58,612 --> 00:34:00,737
He's good to Mama and me.

389
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,448
Every kid needs a hit with a belt sometime. I mean

390
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:11,920
Buddy, you got to try to get past this wall that you're talking about.

391
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:15,316
Hon, you need to talk about your daddy.

392
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:18,658
Why don't you tell me why I hate him ? You're the goddamn psychic !

393
00:34:18,732 --> 00:34:22,255
Huh ? You're the goddamn psychic !

394
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,582
I think I better go.

395
00:34:43,657 --> 00:34:46,801
II have to go home,

396
00:34:49,596 --> 00:34:51,585
right now.

397
00:34:51,665 --> 00:34:54,495
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

398
00:34:54,534 --> 00:34:56,591
It's all right.

399
00:34:57,871 --> 00:35:00,564
II just need I just need your help.

400
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,872
I just keep thinking about that blue diamond. I keep thinking about

401
00:35:06,947 --> 00:35:11,845
Buddy, if you think about these things in your childhood, hon,

402
00:35:11,918 --> 00:35:15,975
and you face up to them, then I will be able to help you.

403
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,585
I know, hon. I just

404
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:23,991
I think you got to do some thinking on your own.

405
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:28,498
Okay.

406
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:31,557
Oh.You Ahh !

407
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:33,570
I'll help you there.

408
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,970
Okay, you put it up there.         Hey, Ben.

409
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:39,839
Hello ?         You got a lot of pretty things.

410
00:35:39,913 --> 00:35:42,470
I liked looking at them.

411
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:44,879
You ever seen anybody skin a squirrel ?

412
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:47,748
You stick a knife in its belly and zip.

413
00:35:47,788 --> 00:35:50,016
That's what I'm going to do to you and your children...

414
00:35:50,058 --> 00:35:52,319
you ever call the police again.

415
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:54,358
I did not.

416
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:09,698
Mama ?

417
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,610
How come you're not asleep ?         I don't know.

418
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,648
What's that bat for?

419
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:26,655
Don't worry, honey. I'm I'm just working on my swing.

420
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:32,790
How come we never go to the cemetery and see Daddy ?

421
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:36,855
Well, we went out there just last month on his birthday.

422
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,663
Honey, I'm real busy, you know that.

423
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:43,571
Well, it seems like you have time for a lot of strangers.

424
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:46,939
If we're talking about my appointments, they're not strangers.

425
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,468
They're the ones that put food on our table.

426
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:51,947
But how come we don't even talk about Daddy ?

427
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:54,450
Go on, Mike. I'm trying to read.

428
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:04,046
Annie ?         We're going to have to frame that.

429
00:38:04,124 --> 00:38:06,090
It's just a painting.         That's beautiful.

430
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,023
Annie.

431
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:12,653
Hey, listen. I know why Kenneth King wasn't in church today.

432
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:16,721
Put your belt on. Why ?         'Cause his daughter disappeared.

433
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:18,701
Jessica ?         Mmhmm.

434
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,670
What do you mean she disappeared ?

435
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,399
Well, Kenneth woke up this morning and Jessica wasn't there,

436
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:25,033
and her bed hadn't even been slept in.

437
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:27,543
Annie, you think she ran off?

438
00:38:27,614 --> 00:38:29,977
I know her and Wayne were supposed to be married in June.

439
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,982
Maybe she got cold feet.         Maybe.

440
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,850
Maybe this will clear the way for you and Wayne.

441
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,615
What are you talking about ?         Oh, come on.

442
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:43,147
I saw the way y'all were looking at each other Friday night.

443
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,753
Y'all both just had stars in your eyes.

444
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:48,195
Oh, Linda, that's nuts.

445
00:38:48,235 --> 00:38:52,031
Yeah. Annie, love is nuts.         Come on. Go home.

446
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:55,663
Listen, I want you to get some rest.

447
00:38:55,742 --> 00:38:58,207
You look terrible, okay ? Bye, boys.

448
00:38:58,245 --> 00:39:00,803
I got to go.         Bye, Miss Linda.

449
00:39:15,529 --> 00:39:17,791
Ben, get your hand out of there !

450
00:39:17,864 --> 00:39:19,797
That's for y'all's cake tonight.

451
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:21,713
What am I gonna ice the cake with ?

452
00:39:21,713 --> 00:39:23,196
I like icin', Mama.

453
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,725
Yeah, I can see that, punkin.

454
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:27,794
Miller !

455
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:31,107
Miller, hon, would you go ask Miss Francis...

456
00:39:31,177 --> 00:39:33,837
if she's got another can of icing, please ?

457
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,574
Mama !         I'm coming, Ben.

458
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:00,767
Where you going, son ?

459
00:40:05,312 --> 00:40:07,676
You wanna ride in the truck ?

460
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:14,875
I got a question for you. You know my wife Valerie ?

461
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:17,547
She been around to see your mama lately ?

462
00:40:18,825 --> 00:40:21,950
Hey, boy, I asked you a question.

463
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,819
Get my hat.

464
00:40:32,672 --> 00:40:35,536
You know, I feel sorry for you and your brothers.

465
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:38,575
I mean, your mama being a witch and all.

466
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,906
If she don't stop her evil ways,

467
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:43,345
some day somebody's gonna burn her up.

468
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:46,549
And then you boys are gonna be without a daddy...

469
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,017
or a mama.

470
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:52,987
Hey, Miller? You all right ?

471
00:40:53,026 --> 00:40:56,288
He said mama's a witch and they're gonna burn her up.

472
00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:58,329
Oh, he did ?

473
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:06,792
You better mind your own business.         I intend to, Donnie.

474
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:16,981
Motherfucker!

475
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,608
Goddamn it! Fuck!

476
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,652
Look, fucker !

477
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:25,222
Shoot me ! Shoot me !

478
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:27,917
Shoot me, you motherfucker !

479
00:41:27,994 --> 00:41:30,960
Shoot me ! Shoot me !

480
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:50,175
You all right ?

481
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,058
Tuscan Rouge.

482
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:07,256
What was I thinking ?

483
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:12,231
I want icin', Mama.

484
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:14,363
Hon, you've had icing enough to put you in a coma.

485
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:16,407
And from now on,

486
00:42:16,443 --> 00:42:18,432
I want to know where you all are every minute of the day.

487
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:20,735
All right ?

488
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:24,741
Mike, I'm gonna start driving you and Miller to school.

489
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:29,079
I wish Daddy was here.

490
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:33,917
Well, he's not, hon. But Mama is. Okay ?

491
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,098
Eat your cake.

492
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,898
Hello.         Uh, this is Kenneth King.

493
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:51,407
Mr. King.         I imagine you, uh,

494
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:54,439
heard about my daughter's disappearance ?

495
00:42:54,481 --> 00:42:56,242
Yes.

496
00:42:56,316 --> 00:42:58,282
Mrs. Wilson, I don't believe in what you do.

497
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:00,317
I'll just be straight with you.

498
00:43:00,386 --> 00:43:04,977
Not only that, I don't like it. But we've got to the end of the road...

499
00:43:05,058 --> 00:43:08,717
and our investigation looked under every rock there is to look under,

500
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:12,125
and we'd like you to tell us what you can to help us.

501
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:15,755
Now, no hocuspocus and chanting and carrying on.

502
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:19,699
We know you talk to a lot of folks, know a lot of folks'business.

503
00:43:19,773 --> 00:43:23,762
You might have heard something or something.

504
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,470
The only thing we know is, uh,

505
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:29,440
one of Sheriff Johnson's men found my daughter's car...

506
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,777
sitting out on the parking lot of that honkytonk called Ay Jay's.

507
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,785
But nobody that was there on Saturday night...

508
00:43:35,855 --> 00:43:38,083
admits to having seen her.

509
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:42,352
So I'm afraid she might have been kidnapped or something ?

510
00:43:44,097 --> 00:43:47,222
Oh, Mr. King, I'm I'm sorry.

511
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,198
I don't know anything about your daughter's disappearance.

512
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,827
I think we were just hoping

513
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,371
Is there anything you can tell us ?

514
00:43:56,442 --> 00:43:58,907
I could read for you.

515
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,803
But that that's about all I could do.

516
00:44:03,883 --> 00:44:06,406
I need you to cut the cards for me.

517
00:44:16,796 --> 00:44:18,557
Oh, boy.

518
00:44:24,437 --> 00:44:26,426
Thank you.

519
00:44:33,413 --> 00:44:35,970
All right. You ready ?

520
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,574
Okay.

521
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:50,086
When were you getting married again, Wayne ?

522
00:44:50,163 --> 00:44:52,822
June 20         We're supposed to ask questions,

523
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,831
not you.         Shut up, Pearl ! Goddamn it !

524
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,833
Look, I have a hard time concentrating...

525
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,369
with more than one person in the room.

526
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:03,428
Well, I'm staying right here. I'm the law, and I need to hear this.

527
00:45:03,509 --> 00:45:06,566
Please, ma'am, just

528
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:07,947
just try to tell us what you see.

529
00:45:07,947 --> 00:45:09,140
just try to tell us what you see.

530
00:45:09,215 --> 00:45:12,010
I'm trying.

531
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:14,210
All right.

532
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:34,538
All right, all I'm picking up

533
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:38,869
it's like a it's a fence.

534
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,959
Like a split rail fence.

535
00:45:40,959 --> 00:45:45,045
Do you know how many fences there are in this county ?

536
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:49,453
And some pillars, like, with an opening going through.

537
00:45:54,494 --> 00:45:58,325
And there's lots of white flowers. I can I

538
00:45:58,398 --> 00:46:03,126
YYes. And, uh, is that where Jessie is ?

539
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,124
Well, that's that's, um, all I'm all I'm seeing.

540
00:46:18,124 --> 00:46:22,580
This is just mishmash. I told you this wouldn't lead to nothing.

541
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,621
You're right. It won't. I can't concentrate.

542
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:29,921
I can't do this now. I'm sorry.

543
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:31,449
Please, ma'am.

544
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,520
I really do hope you find your daughter.

545
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,656
But I'm I'm just not the person to help you with this.

546
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:22,088
Hey, Butch.

547
00:49:55,401 --> 00:49:57,333
And it was horrible.

548
00:49:57,403 --> 00:50:00,335
But that same chain that was wrapped around her when she was floatin',

549
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:05,465
you know, up in my tree, it was the same chain that I had in my dream.

550
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:08,534
I don't know. I just thought         Dave ?

551
00:50:11,117 --> 00:50:12,936
Yes, sir ?

552
00:50:12,936 --> 00:50:14,902
I could have sworn there was an eclair in there.

553
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,012
I didn't get it.

554
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:22,937
Tim was in a little earlier.

555
00:50:25,174 --> 00:50:28,045
So you saw all this in a dream ?

556
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:30,016
It wasn't just a dream.

557
00:50:30,086 --> 00:50:32,143
I don't investigate somebody's dream.

558
00:50:33,757 --> 00:50:35,814
I think she's dead, Sheriff.

559
00:50:35,892 --> 00:50:38,881
And I think she's in a pond.

560
00:50:38,962 --> 00:50:42,359
What do you know about this you ain't telling me ?

561
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:45,759
Hmm ? You can get in serious trouble withholding information.

562
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,858
Does it sound like a place you know ?

563
00:50:47,937 --> 00:50:49,903
Yeah, a bunch of places I know.

564
00:50:49,973 --> 00:50:53,166
Split rail fence, a pond, a stretch of woods.

565
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:54,895
Every rawbone ol' boy got that.

566
00:50:54,895 --> 00:50:56,102
What about the fiddler ?

567
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:01,378
ol' Tommy Lee Ballard plays a fiddle.

568
00:51:01,618 --> 00:51:04,141
But he wouldn't kill nobody. I've known him since he's a kid.

569
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:07,777
No, no, it's not the fiddler. Who are his neighbors ?

570
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:11,755
Well, his closest neighbor would be, uh

571
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:15,826
Well, let me see here. I guess

572
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:20,059
Well, his property borders, uh, Donnie Barksdale's place.

573
00:51:21,403 --> 00:51:23,869
Do you know Donnie Barksdale ?

574
00:51:25,942 --> 00:51:27,931
Ma'am ?

575
00:51:34,851 --> 00:51:37,079
Tim ! On the gate !

576
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,319
You did get a search warrant, didn't you ?

577
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,321
I want everything to be legal and proper.

578
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,857
Didn't have to. Got permission from the owner.

579
00:51:44,928 --> 00:51:48,121
Donnie Barksdale gave you permission

580
00:51:48,197 --> 00:51:50,838
His wife did. I told her it was routine.

581
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:54,128
We're checking all the ponds in the county.

582
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:56,328
Donnie's gone fishing today.

583
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:15,420
Excuse me. SheriffJohnson ?

584
00:52:15,491 --> 00:52:19,321
How much longer y'all gonna be ?         Long as it takes.

585
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:22,883
All right. You just said you're gonna be a few minutes.

586
00:52:22,966 --> 00:52:25,261
And we're going on two hours.

587
00:52:25,334 --> 00:52:28,323
Hey, Pearl ! I think I got something !

588
00:52:57,534 --> 00:53:00,864
False alarm. It's just an old bicycle.

589
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:07,033
None of y'all brought a Thermos of coffee out here ?

590
00:53:30,466 --> 00:53:32,523
That day at school.

591
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:36,936
You looked kind of strange at me and Jessica.

592
00:53:36,973 --> 00:53:39,370
Did you think something bad then ?

593
00:53:50,085 --> 00:53:52,415
Shit. Come on.

594
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:56,846
Donnie, he called. I told him         Pearl !

595
00:53:56,926 --> 00:53:58,949
Shut your mouth !

596
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,084
Goddamn it, Pearl, what are you doing on my property ?

597
00:54:01,163 --> 00:54:04,527
I'm on Sheriff's business, Donnie. I got permission from your wife.

598
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:06,533
You think I let that little ninny talk for me ?

599
00:54:07,342 --> 00:54:11,198
How'd your arm get all scratched up ?

600
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:17,000
Stray cat. She didn't like it when I killed her.

601
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:20,375
Now what brought you here ?        Just routine investigation.

602
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,609
We're checking all the ponds in the county.

603
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:33,816
I knew it was you.         No ! You Uhh !

604
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:41,090
Hey ! I'm on County business, Donnie. Don't fool with me.

605
00:54:41,169 --> 00:54:43,964
Hey, Pearl !         What ?

606
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:47,005
You need to take a look at this.         Watch him.

607
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:50,031
Haul it up, boys!

608
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:01,143
It's her !         Donnie ?

609
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:07,355
Get those hooks out of my baby !

610
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,555
Get her off them hooks ! Ohh !         Cuff him !

611
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:14,030
No ! No !         Mr. King !

612
00:55:16,372 --> 00:55:19,463
No ! Ohh !         Get an ambulance !

613
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:21,508
I think he's having a heart attack !

614
00:55:21,544 --> 00:55:24,169
I didn't do this !         Get him out of here !

615
00:55:24,246 --> 00:55:26,371
This ain't right ! Pearl !

616
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:30,677
Bitch ! Bitch ! Bitch ! Pearl !

617
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:45,541
Come in.

618
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:51,407
Somebody might come in here.

619
00:55:51,477 --> 00:55:54,068
I guess you better fuck me fast.

620
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,041
You want some coffee ? Mrs. Wilson ?

621
00:55:59,852 --> 00:56:02,045
You want some coffee ?

622
00:56:02,288 --> 00:56:04,481
No, thank you.

623
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:06,489
Have a seat.

624
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:14,329
Why Why have you called me here ?

625
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,594
Tomorrow Donnie Barksdale goes on trial for murder...

626
00:56:17,671 --> 00:56:20,728
and I feel that we have a powerful case.

627
00:56:20,807 --> 00:56:22,739
In fact, today the coroner verified...

628
00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:25,070
Donnie's tissue under the victim's fingernails.

629
00:56:25,311 --> 00:56:28,834
Now, I only have one weak link I got to worry about.

630
00:56:28,914 --> 00:56:32,074
What ?         You.

631
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:36,546
You see, you're how we found out where the victim's body was.

632
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:39,850
And how you found out, well,

633
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:43,085
that might open up a real can of worms for us.

634
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:47,762
Psychic phenomena, E.S.P., dreams, visions.

635
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:50,026
The defense could go to town on you.

636
00:56:50,102 --> 00:56:53,466
And if that's not bad enough, I understand there was bad blood...

637
00:56:53,506 --> 00:56:56,438
between you and Donnie Barksdale.

638
00:56:56,509 --> 00:56:58,668
Yeah. He threatened my kids.

639
00:56:58,745 --> 00:57:02,700
That's what I heard. I also heard that you threatened him right back.

640
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:04,873
Told his wife to leave him.

641
00:57:07,386 --> 00:57:09,783
Donnie's quite a ladies' man.

642
00:57:09,822 --> 00:57:12,015
Were you involved with him ?

643
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:16,491
What ?         I can deal with any revelation...

644
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:18,495
right now.

645
00:57:18,531 --> 00:57:21,497
But at the trial there can't be any surprises.

646
00:57:23,035 --> 00:57:25,763
So, is there anything I need to know about you or Donnie...

647
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:28,998
or Donnie's wife or the victim ?

648
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:31,632
No.

649
00:57:31,711 --> 00:57:33,938
Will that be all ?

650
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,046
Yes, ma'am.

651
00:57:39,852 --> 00:57:43,376
You know, Mr. Duncan,

652
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:46,853
the victim had a name.

653
00:57:46,892 --> 00:57:49,654
It was Jessica King.

654
00:57:53,499 --> 00:57:57,125
Mr. Hawkins, how long have you worked out at Ay Jay's ?

655
00:57:57,203 --> 00:57:59,135
About ten years.

656
00:57:59,205 --> 00:58:02,830
Now, were you working at Ay Jay's on Saturday night, April 8 ?

657
00:58:02,908 --> 00:58:05,534
Yes, sir.         And did you see the defendant,

658
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:09,204
Donnie Barksdale, there that night?        Yes, sir.

659
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:12,039
Could you describe the circumstances when you saw him ?

660
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:16,913
The circumstances were I come outside to throw out some trash.

661
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:18,921
And do you recall what time it was ?

662
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:21,219
About midnight, I reckon.

663
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,914
Anyhow, I seen Donnie Barksdale out there by his truck...

664
00:58:24,997 --> 00:58:28,895
havin'an argument with this white lady.

665
00:58:28,968 --> 00:58:33,764
She scratched his arm and he slapped the tar out of her.

666
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:36,703
About that time, I go back inside.

667
00:58:36,775 --> 00:58:39,037
Is this the woman you saw with Donnie Barksdale ?

668
00:58:39,078 --> 00:58:42,442
Yes, sir.         Your Honor, let the record show...

669
00:58:42,516 --> 00:58:46,539
that I've just shown Mr. Hawkins a photograph of Jessica King.

670
00:58:48,921 --> 00:58:54,081
You just said that your attention was drawn to the defendant's pond.

671
00:58:55,529 --> 00:58:58,552
Drawn in Well, drawn in what way ?

672
00:58:59,865 --> 00:59:02,695
Me, Wayne Collins and Kenneth King...

673
00:59:02,768 --> 00:59:04,700
went to see a woman, name of Annie Wilson.

674
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,134
What made you think this woman would be able to help you ?

675
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:12,968
Well, word around town was that she was a,

676
00:59:15,714 --> 00:59:19,771
Well, I don't know the right word.         Isn't it fortuneteller ?

677
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:23,815
I guess so.        What did this fortuneteller see...

678
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:26,845
when she looked into her little crystal ball ?

679
00:59:26,892 --> 00:59:31,756
Well, she didn't have no ball. She had these, uh, special cards.

680
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:35,024
What did she see when she looked into her little special cards ?

681
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,498
Uh, she didn't actually see nothing then.

682
00:59:37,537 --> 00:59:40,969
But next day, she come to see me and...

683
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,938
told me she had this dream.

684
00:59:43,008 --> 00:59:45,997
She had a dream ?         Yes, sir.

685
00:59:46,078 --> 00:59:50,238
She'd seen this pond and it looked a lot like Donnie Barksdale's and...

686
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:54,544
then she woke up from her dream...

687
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,677
and she went outside and looked up in this tree.

688
01:00:00,693 --> 01:00:02,716
I'm all ears.

689
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:09,789
She seen Jessica King...

690
01:00:09,868 --> 01:00:12,528
floatin' in the tree,

691
01:00:12,605 --> 01:00:15,265
halfnaked, with a chain wrapped around her.

692
01:00:15,341 --> 01:00:17,829
Floatin' around a tree ?

693
01:00:19,211 --> 01:00:21,177
Yes, sir.

694
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:24,737
Floatin' in a tree,

695
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:26,874
halfnaked,

696
01:00:28,821 --> 01:00:31,049
with a chain wrapped around her.

697
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:33,556
Thank you, Sheriff.

698
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,552
That little squirrel, Weems, is just mean and skinny.

699
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:40,028
Never have known a Weems worth a damn.

700
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:41,997
Well, he was just doing his job.

701
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:45,931
Uh, Mrs. Wilson ? Can I talk to you for a minute ?

702
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:49,233
Uh, just call me later on, okay ?

703
01:00:49,308 --> 01:00:51,240
Oh, okay.         Okay, bye.

704
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:56,004
Buddy, I got a lot on my mind. It's not a good time, okay ?

705
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,249
Um, Mrs. Wilson ?

706
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:04,308
You did tell me to do some thinkin' and talkin'. And I've been thinkin'.

707
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:06,220
What ? What ?

708
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:10,155
Can you tell me why I do things to myself...

709
01:01:10,229 --> 01:01:12,161
when I think about my daddy ?

710
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:14,288
All right, well

711
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,731
Bud, you call me later, hon, and we'll talk, all right ?

712
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:21,601
I need to talk to you.         Buddy.

713
01:01:21,674 --> 01:01:24,640
I've been thinking about my daddy and I've been touching myself.

714
01:01:24,677 --> 01:01:27,643
Touching yourself? How ?         Why do I do that ?

715
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,146
It's not a good time.

716
01:01:29,214 --> 01:01:32,611
Something's bad wrong with me.         Look, Buddy

717
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:35,640
And I I keep thinking about that blue diamond.

718
01:01:35,688 --> 01:01:39,348
You look into the blue diamond, you won't think a negative thought.

719
01:01:39,426 --> 01:01:43,256
I promise. Now, hon, I'm going through a hard time myself. I'm

720
01:01:43,329 --> 01:01:46,692
I just I can't talk to you now, okay ?

721
01:01:49,968 --> 01:01:52,661
You're gonna burn in hell, Annie Wilson !

722
01:02:03,248 --> 01:02:06,373
Now, Mike, I know you skipped school and went to that trial.

723
01:02:06,453 --> 01:02:09,714
How'd you know ?         A little bird told me.

724
01:02:09,788 --> 01:02:12,948
It's time you started making things easier on me instead of harder.

725
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:14,957
I'm very disappointed in you.

726
01:02:15,027 --> 01:02:18,425
The phone's ringing, Mama.         Second of all,

727
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:21,290
I'm gonna have to testify at that trial tomorrow.

728
01:02:21,367 --> 01:02:24,197
The phone's ringing, Mama.         I'm not deaf, Miller.

729
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,395
Let the machine get it.

730
01:02:26,472 --> 01:02:30,428
Donnie Barksdale's side, they're gonna try and give me a hard time.

731
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:33,142
They're gonna call me names and I

732
01:02:33,212 --> 01:02:35,144
I just want y'all to be prepared...

733
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:38,408
if you hear any bad stuff about me, all right ?

734
01:02:38,484 --> 01:02:42,042
Now, we're all gonna have to be sticking together on this one.

735
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:44,882
Annie Wilson, it's Buddy's mother.

736
01:02:44,957 --> 01:02:47,445
Buddy's done gone crazy. He's threatening to kill his daddy!

737
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:51,353
He's got Odell tied up in the backyard,

738
01:02:51,431 --> 01:02:53,453
accusing him of horrible things.

739
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:54,486
Have you called the police ?

740
01:02:54,486 --> 01:02:57,063
He said if I did he'd kill Odell.

741
01:02:57,102 --> 01:02:59,330
He wants you.

742
01:03:01,407 --> 01:03:04,134
Hey, Buddy.

743
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:10,866
Buddy, put that strap down and tell me what he's done to you.

744
01:03:10,949 --> 01:03:12,781
I'm here, Buddy. Like you said,

745
01:03:12,781 --> 01:03:14,143
you can talk to me, honey.

746
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:19,481
It's too late for that ! It's too goddamn late !

747
01:03:19,725 --> 01:03:23,351
This here is a criminal.

748
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:27,988
And he's gonna be punished.

749
01:03:28,066 --> 01:03:30,463
BudBuddy. Buddy, it's Annie.

750
01:03:30,536 --> 01:03:33,764
You shut up ! You shut up !         It's all right.

751
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,585
Get away ! Where were you ?

752
01:03:35,585 --> 01:03:37,896
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

753
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:42,308
You knew everything and you did nothing.

754
01:03:42,382 --> 01:03:45,177
You ruined me. You ruined me !

755
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,948
I was just a little boy, Daddy.

756
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:52,418
It got so I was embarrassed to go to school, Daddy.

757
01:03:52,491 --> 01:03:55,287
How could you do that to your little boy ?

758
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:10,329
No, Buddy. You put that down. No, Buddy.

759
01:04:10,409 --> 01:04:13,375
You put that down, Buddy. You put that down. You listen to me.

760
01:04:13,445 --> 01:04:16,775
You get away ! You get away ! Get away !

761
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:21,179
All right, Buddy. All right. It's all right. Come on.

762
01:04:22,588 --> 01:04:24,986
Why Why didn't you help me, Annie ?

763
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:26,852
What ?

764
01:04:26,925 --> 01:04:29,516
Why didn't you help me ?

765
01:04:29,595 --> 01:04:31,576
I had you for a friend and then

766
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,221
I am your friend, Buddy.

767
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:35,992
Now I have nobody.

768
01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:38,000
I have nobody !

769
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:51,447
But I'm gonna I'm gonna kill this thing.

770
01:04:52,885 --> 01:04:54,976
No !         No, Buddy !

771
01:05:00,092 --> 01:05:01,421
No !

772
01:05:02,895 --> 01:05:04,293
Help me !

773
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:07,488
Help me!         Look at that goddamn thing.

774
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:09,896
And you tell me what kind of thoughts you have ?

775
01:05:09,968 --> 01:05:12,957
You look!

776
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:15,004
You look into that thing!

777
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:39,525
Mrs. Wilson ? Mrs. Wilson.

778
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:44,124
Mrs. Wilson, your husband, Ben Wilson Senior,

779
01:05:44,203 --> 01:05:46,566
was one of the men killed last year in the explosion...

780
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:48,570
out at the Reinhold Cable Plant.

781
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,868
Yes, that's right.

782
01:05:50,943 --> 01:05:54,306
And you were left with three small children to raise on your own.

783
01:05:54,379 --> 01:05:56,937
Yes, sir.

784
01:05:57,015 --> 01:05:59,344
How do you provide for you and your sons ?

785
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:06,615
I get a little bit of money from Social Security...

786
01:06:06,692 --> 01:06:09,229
as a result of my husband's death.

787
01:06:10,696 --> 01:06:13,287
And, uh,

788
01:06:13,365 --> 01:06:15,558
I also give readings.

789
01:06:15,634 --> 01:06:17,623
Psychic readings.         Yes, sir.

790
01:06:17,703 --> 01:06:21,030
What does being psychic enable you to do ?

791
01:06:22,674 --> 01:06:25,004
I see things...

792
01:06:25,078 --> 01:06:28,407
and I, you know I sense... things...

793
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,571
that well, they hadn't happened yet...

794
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:33,945
or they were happening someplace else.

795
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:39,146
My granny told me that I I had a gift that runs in my family.

796
01:06:39,224 --> 01:06:41,452
And she told me that I shouldn't be afraid of it.

797
01:06:41,526 --> 01:06:46,618
I should just always use my instinct and I'd I'd be all right.

798
01:06:46,665 --> 01:06:48,654
So, you're swearing before this court...

799
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:51,030
that you didn't get your information about this tragedy...

800
01:06:51,104 --> 01:06:53,968
from any other means than your special ability ?

801
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,029
Your gift.         Yes, sir.

802
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:59,701
I'm swearing that. Yes.

803
01:06:59,945 --> 01:07:02,934
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.         Yes, sir.

804
01:07:02,982 --> 01:07:05,573
I have no further questions.         Mr. Weems.

805
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,080
Mrs. Wilson.

806
01:07:16,029 --> 01:07:18,426
How many fingers am I holding up behind my back ?

807
01:07:18,497 --> 01:07:20,486
Objection, Your Honor.         Your Honor,

808
01:07:20,532 --> 01:07:23,293
my client is sitting in this courtroom on trial for his life...

809
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:26,960
partly because of powers that this woman claims to have.

810
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,972
Now, in all fairness, I believe I should be given the opportunity...

811
01:07:30,009 --> 01:07:31,975
to test the alleged powers...

812
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:34,476
instead of having to stand here and take her word for it.

813
01:07:34,546 --> 01:07:38,070
You have a good point. Objection overruled.

814
01:07:38,151 --> 01:07:43,447
Can everyone in the jury box see how many fingers I'm showing ?

815
01:07:47,994 --> 01:07:50,152
How many fingers, Mrs. Wilson ?

816
01:07:55,734 --> 01:07:57,700
I don't know.

817
01:07:57,736 --> 01:08:00,066
You don't know ?

818
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:06,099
Seven. Seven fingers.

819
01:08:06,178 --> 01:08:08,667
That That doesn't prove anything.

820
01:08:08,747 --> 01:08:12,009
Your Honor, I can't do this, you know, at the drop of a hat.

821
01:08:12,085 --> 01:08:16,380
Well, then, ma'am, how about doing it at the drop of a dollar bill ?

822
01:08:16,455 --> 01:08:18,683
What are you trying to say ?

823
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:21,211
I'm trying to say maybe this special gift of yours doesn't work...

824
01:08:21,293 --> 01:08:22,607
unless you're being paid for it.

825
