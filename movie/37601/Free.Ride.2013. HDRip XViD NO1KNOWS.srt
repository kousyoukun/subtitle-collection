             GIRL:
  Don't you fucking touch her!

10

       Don't you fucking

12
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,388
              Mom!

00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,809
           CHRISTINA:
       Sandy? It's Chris.

16
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,380
         (Whispering):
     I got to get the girls
          out of here.

17
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:24,516
      He almost killed me
            tonight.

18
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,784
       SANDY, OVER PHONE:
           <i>Calm down.</i>

19
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,619
      <i>Go pack yourself up.</i>

21
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,558
            Really?

     (School bell ringing)

26
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,538
Going to the ring
    tonight?

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,108
                           Yeah.

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,409
Cool.

29
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,344
Everyone's going.

30
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,752
      Meet me outside.
I want to show you something.

31
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,755
             Okay.

32
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,192
            TEACHER:
Class, your homework assignment
          for tomorrow

33
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,429
         is chapter 5,
       questions 1, 2, 3.

34
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,264
   And then after you're done
           with that

35
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,899
        you can start on
     your next assignment,

36
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:18,403
   which will be chapter 10,
      one through seven...

37
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,771
(Giggling)

38
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,306
        Is there something funny
        that you'd like to share

39
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,641
                 with the class?
(Children laughing)

40
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,610
     (School bell ringing)
           Hurry up.

41
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:25,777
                      You got me
                     in trouble,

42
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,346
                  you dodo bird.

43
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,515
You're the dodo bird.

44
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,250
            Come on.

45
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,820
              Hey!

46
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,724
                What's going on?

47
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,527
We're going to Florida.

48
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,195
Here.

49
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,863
So that your eyes don't burn out
     from all the sunshine.

50
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,398
   Come on,
get in, get in.

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,733
                           Cool!

52
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,269
      (Car doors closing)

53
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,873
        Come on, get in.

54
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,278
               I'm going to need
                  a co-pilot.

55
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,815
               I'll be damned
            if I'm going to take

56
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,717
                any lame asses
              across state line.

57
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,953
      We either do this together
            or not at all.

58
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,755
      SHELL:
I'm not a lame ass.

59
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:13,258
Why are we going
  to Florida?

60
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,797
                 I called Sandy.

61
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,299
              She said she could
                 get me a job.

62
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,434
                  It's as simple
                     as that.

63
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,637
Does Grandma know?

64
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,706
                 I'll tell her
              when we get there.

65
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,544
       I need to get down there
      and make some money first.

66
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,780
       I'm not going to sit here
           and listen to her

67
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,682
          tell me what a fucking
                loser I am

68
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,784
           for having to move us
            back into her house.

69
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,320
          Is that okay with you?

70
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,225
                You're either in
                 or you're out.

71
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,763
             Travelin' 77 south.

72
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,433
     (Car engine starting)

73
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:14,486
               â™ª

74
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,576
  â™ª There's a house of cards

75
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,945
    â™ª And it's coming down

76
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
      â™ª There's a beating
          of a drum â™ª

77
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,986
   â™ª But it makes no sound

78
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,393
    â™ª There's a howling wind
 but the trees ain't swaying â™ª

79
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:57,863
    â™ª There's a hidden truth
in the words you're not saying â™ª

80
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,998
     â™ª It's a better way

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,968
     â™ª And the way is out

82
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,872
           CHRISTINA:
        Lock your doors.

83
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,840
   We wouldn't want some trucker
          crawling in here

84
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,942
          looking for a warm bed
              full of ladies.

85
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,878
Yeah, sure you wouldn't.

86
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,946
     Good night, John-Boy.

87
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,986
            It's not going to be
                  forever.

88
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,756
What if it sucks?

89
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,925
              Then we'll go back
                 to Grandma's.

90
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,028
     Is it just going to be
        the three of us?

91
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,631
           Just the three of us.

92
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,600
You promise?

93
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,003
                Yeah, I promise.

94
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,575
     Good night, John-Boy.

95
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,978
Good night,
Elizabeth.

96
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,414
                     Good night,
                     Mary Ellen.

     â™ª Every broken mile

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,701
          â™ª Smile on

100
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,637
      â™ª Your little ones

101
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,709
          â™ª Rise out

102
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,912
  â™ª Of another southern sky

103
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,816
    â™ª On your little ones

104
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:28,920
 â™ª Shine on your little ones

105
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:32,657
    â™ª On your little ones

106
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,075
   (All chattering excitedly)

107
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,578
           CHRISTINA:
    Okay, wait, wait, wait.

108
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,681
          Wait, wait.
   Let me park the car first.

109
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,518
             Sandy!

110
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,987
                     Hey, girls.

111
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,656
                Whoa, Nellie,
            don't spill my beer.

112
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,891
                      (Laughing)

113
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,861
                Come on.
       Welcome to Florida, baby.

114
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,464
             Sandy!

115
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,132
              Aah!

116
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,005
But the cleaning part
  is just for now.

117
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,640
The boss man has other stuff
         coming up,

118
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:25,143
but you're going to have to meet
    him before that happens.

119
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,612
         Do you think he's going
               to like me?

120
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,581
He's going to love you.

121
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,016
                            Why?

122
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:34,152
Well, you're good-looking,
         for one.

123
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,022
       What does that have to do
         with cleaning houses?

124
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,026
It doesn't.

125
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,061
But it matters.

126
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,538
       (Objects crashing)

127
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,107
         (Man and woman
        arguing loudly)

128
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,010
                   MAN:
         What's wrong with you?!

129
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,012
         Come back here, Shauna!

130
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,688
             SHELL:
  I don't know why you didn't

131
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,790
          just ask her
     if you could have it.

132
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:15,126
   I don't want her to think
I'm so charity case, that's why.

133
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,601
Where did you get that?

134
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,169
                           What?

                           Um...

137
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,510
                     back there.

138
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,211
Back where?

139
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,116
                   In the store.

140
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,285
We didn't buy any gum,
        Shell.

141
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,225
                Well, I couldn't
                    hold it,

142
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,794
                     so I put it
                    in my pocket

143
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,830
                    and I forgot
                   it was there.

144
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,766
Spit it out.

145
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,169
Spit it out.

146
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,277
Okay, we're going
   to go back,

147
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,613
  and you're going to tell
the store lady you stole it.

148
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,549
She'll probably make you
  give something back.

149
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,918
                           Why?!
Because we're not trash, Shell.

150
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,119
We don't steal.

151
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,154
I didn't mean to.

152
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,089
              Okay, but you did.
                   Come on.

153
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,659

154
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,193
                     Sorry, bud.

00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,563
                           Yeah.

268
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,164
          By yourself?

269
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,332
                         I wish.

270
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,067
(Laughing)

271
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,770
Ah, the parents, huh?
      I get it.

272
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,573
                   Yeah, my mom.

273
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,709
So, what's, uh...

274
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,611
what's your mom do?

275
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,081
                     She cleans.

276
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,590
        (Wolf whistling)

277
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,258
            PARROT:
             Hello.

278
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,296
         Relax, sister.

279
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,266
It's the moment of truth.

280
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,734
                           Yeah?
             Mm-hm.

281
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,737
       Boss man's having
  his birthday party tonight,

282
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,106
and he would be delighted
      to meet you.

283
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,208
             Cool.

284
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,078
           Look good.

285
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,546
    What? This isn't working
            for you?

286
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,148
           (Laughing)

287
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,716
      But I smell so good.

288
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,221
           CHRISTINA:
           You know,

289
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,425
 you might want to try staying
       inside the lines.

290
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,326
Okay.

291
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:52,336
               â™ª

292
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,608
     What's the word, perm?

293
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,245
              Hey.

294
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,513
            Really?

295
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,649
            Come on.
          Look at you.

296
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,184
           Seriously?

297
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,552
I look good.

298
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,854
(Engine starting)

299
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,256
    Look, don't spend it all
         in one place,

300
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,125
      and make sure Shell
     gets something to eat

301
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,827
       that isn't sugar,
           all right?

302
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,696
You look nice, by the way.

303
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,265
           Thank you.

304
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,421
Get your shoes on.

305
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,201
    (Indistinct chattering)

306
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,874
           Miss Ohio.

307
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,409
 Mm-mm. I'm glad
you could finally

308
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,411
            grace us
      with your presence.

309
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,614
       And this is, well,

310
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,216
      we like to call him
          the Captain.

311
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,152
Hi. Christina.

312
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,786
                       Pleasure.

313
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,723
           I heard some kind
      of rumour about being able

314
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,192
    to eat off the kitchen floor
         at the bird house.

315
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,295
              Wasn't like that
           when Sandy was at it.

316
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,730
            Come on.

317
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,266
         You know where
      my skills lie, hmm?

318
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,569
               So, uh, where did
                 you two meet?

319
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,938
We danced together at this place
      called Ember's Tomb.

320
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,574
     Oh, boy. Lunch shift.
        What a shithole.

321
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:37,742
           (Laughing)

322
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,577
         You work in the houses?
Yeah.

323
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,946
         Not for long.

324
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,882
                    CAPTAIN:
                Yeah, of course.

325
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,284
                    SANDY:
             Come on, follow me.

326
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,853
       I want to show you
           something.

327
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,224
               Nice to meet you.

328
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,210
                  Would you like
                     to dance?

329
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,316
                           Sure.

330
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,298
I've heard some real good things
      about you, Christina.

331
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,472
                    You must be
                   the boss man.

332
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,315
            Evening.

333
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,330
Hey, got a cigarette?

334
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,833
             Sure.

335
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,773
                   Your dad know
                   you out here?

336
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,509
No. He doesn't care.

337
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,713
             Chris.

338
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,049
             Zada.

339
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,718
    I'm upstairs if you ever
         need anything.

340
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,053
Thanks.

341
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,662
            Hey. I hope your ass
              is free tonight.

342
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,030
        Why? What's up?

343
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:40,998
              We're celebrating.

344
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,471
     Fucking what, already?

345
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,007
            Your first trip out.

346
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,810
            Really?

347
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,478
             When?

348
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,315
              Boss man wants you
              on the water ASAP.

349
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:01,485
              Apparently you got
                  potential.

350
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,387
             Cool.

351
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,891
                  All right,
             first things first.

352
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,492
                      The rules.

353
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,894
                      Follow me.

354
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,865
   One: no sampling the load.

355
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,401
                  Two: never,
              ever throw a load.

356
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,970
     And three: no relationships
       inside the organization.

357
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,340
      The boss man does not like
        the right hand knowing

358
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,841
     what the left hand's doing.

359
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,377
                      Comprende?
What?

360
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,879
    I'm not fucking around here,
               Chris.

361
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,381
       You got to pay attention.

362
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,616
I'm here for you, Sandy.
   Whatever you need.

363
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,818
                      All right.

364
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,587
        First thing we got to do
             is find a boat.

365
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,055
How about that one?

366
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,891
    Too big. We're looking for
  a 30- to 40-foot fishing boat.

367
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,494
            Anything bigger
       draws too much attention.

368
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:46,597
   Anything smaller doesn't have
          enough storage.

369
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,532
       All right, Chris.
    Let's see what you got.

370
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,934
        This guy's cool.

371
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,137
                  Anyone aboard?

372
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,442
Can I help you?
                             Hi.

373
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,946
      Uh, I was wondering
     if you rent your boat.

374
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,949
Sure do, but I won't be around
          to run it.

375
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,550
I've got some relatives
       in town.

376
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,085
       You got to start thinking
             like a sailor.

377
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,887
             So you only want
         to buy food that keeps,

378
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,756
 because you never know how long
  you're going to be out there.

379
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:14,959
 You want canned, dry, pickled,
smoked, but only the good stuff.

380
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,528
Look, Chris, we're moving drugs,
          not rockets.

381
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,631
   Just be good at your job,
    and look good doing it.

382
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,881
My, oh, my.

383
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,816
Must be destiny.

384
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:39,984
You know Ray,
the Captain.

385
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,419
And this is Duane.

386
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,720
    He's the best fisherman
          in Florida.

387
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,088
           You make good coffee?

388
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,723
                 I've been told.
      RAY:
Well, you better,

389
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,591
 because we got a hot date in
the morning with this charmer,

390
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,660
    and you don't want
to see him behind the wheel

391
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,929
when Sandy's making coffee.

392
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,932
           (Snorting)
          This is my new friend.

393
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,601
      Rain. You want some?

394
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,173
  (Erotic rock music playing)

395
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,850
          â™ª Here I go
   falling down, down, down â™ª

396
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,552
     â™ª My mind is a blank

397
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:18,022
     â™ª My head is spinning
      around and around â™ª

398
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:22,493
         â™ª As I go deep
   into the funnel of love â™ª

399
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:28,065
      â™ª It's such a crazy,
        crazy feeling â™ª

400
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,034
  â™ª I get weak in the knees

401
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,703
       â™ª My poor old head
          is reeling â™ª

402
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:37,041
         â™ª As I go deep
   into the funnel of love â™ª

403
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:42,847
     â™ª I tried and I tried
       to run and hide â™ª

404
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,584
   â™ª Even tried to run away

405
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:50,554
      â™ª You just can't run
   from the funnel of love â™ª

406
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,790
What do the stars say,
       captain?

407
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,526
Are we in trouble?

408
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,661
            Sure looks that way.

409
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,779
     How long are you going
          to be gone?

410
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,615
               A couple of days.

411
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,183
Hey.

412
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,785
    I didn't think you guys
     were going to make it.

413
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,054
          (Chuckling)

414
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,972
Hey, beautiful.

415
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,041
What kind of bait
   you using?

416
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,311
            I'm not.

417
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,847
   Well, you got to offer
the fish something, darling.

418
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,249
           I thought it was just
           supposed to look like

419
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,118
                  we're out here
                     fishing.

420
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,287
I mean, it is, you know?

421
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,055
 But we might as well see
what Poseidon has to offer

422
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,925
while we're doing it,
       right?

423
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:03,027
Let's see what
 we got here.

424
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,596
All right. Okay.

425
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,266
  Actually,
you know what?

426
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:13,037
It's bad luck to have someone
 bait your hook. Come here.

427
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,638
Come here.

428
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,310
      You know, I never took you
        for the squeamish type.

429
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:22,146
I'm not. It's just I've never
   used something so big.

430
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,582
You give me a minnow
and I'm all over it.

431
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,116
             Well, it's the same
                  principle.

432
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,986
  You're going to want to get it
     on there nice and secure,

433
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:32,790
    and leave just enough dangle
       to get their attention.

434
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,335
               Flip that switch.

435
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,391
                 Come on,
          we got the mothership.

436
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,850
              RAY:
 Think you got this, Miss Ohio?

437
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,021
                 Don't you worry
                   about cops?

438
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:40,190
   No. International waters.

439
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,728
           CHRISTINA:
  Where does it go from here?

440
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,264
              RAY:
            Inland.

441
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,966
           You know,
       the boss's houses,

442
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:51,802
     where we hold it until
 it's picked up and goes north.

443
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,844
       (Knocking at door)

444
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,788
Get your shit packed,
       girls.

445
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,756
                            Hey.
Hmm.

446
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,960
Get up.

447
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:26,970
               â™ª

448
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,378
         Well? Come on.

449
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,480
        It's all yours.

450
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,785
            Oh, wow.

451
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,454
           (Laughing)

452
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,360
    (Indistinct chattering)

453
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,070
           CHRISTINA:
           All right.

454
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,005
I think I can
handle this.

455
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,808
(Playing notes)

456
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,976
                      (Laughing)

457
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,177
                 No, no, no, no.

458
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,345
                 Let me show you
                  how it's done.

459
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,880
Okay.
                      All right.

460
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,348
           (Playing)

461
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,226
                      (Laughing)

462
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,261
All right.

463
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,332
                       Told you.

464
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:30,400
(Snickering)

465
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,077
            No way.

466
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,279
           Come here.

467
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,781
    (Making kissing sounds)

468
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:44,815
              Hi.

469
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:47,017
           (Laughing)

470
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,353
            Hi. Hi.

471
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,522
            Hi, bud.
       What's your name?

472
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:53,357
                     SHELL:
                Sandy told Mommy

473
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,425
                  it's a gift
              from the boss man.

474
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,062
       What if he doesn't
            like us?

475
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,499
Then we'll...

476
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,268
We'll run away
 on the horse

477
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,003
        and call Grandma
        to come get us.

478
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,871
                 Can we do that?

479
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,973
             Yeah.

480
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,109
          Grandma said
       I'm an adult now,

481
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:15,279
        and I can leave
        whenever I want.

482
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,514
     I mean take the horse.

483
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,983
She said it was
a gift, right?

484
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,018
             Yeah.

485
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,320
        Then it's ours.

486
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,128
 (Engine sputtering distantly)

487
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,496
(Vehicle approaching)

488
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,107
(Engine shuts off)

489
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,046
                            Mom?

490
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,382
      Turn the light off.

491
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,585
           Come here.

492
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,398
           CHRISTINA:
 Do you want to keep the horse?

493
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,905
Then you got to be cool,
          MJ.

494
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,574
 Boss man's storing
some stuff in there,

495
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:21,011
and we need to be cool
      about it.

496
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:27,885
  No one but me, you or Shell
     goes inside the barn.

497
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,419
You understand?

498
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,323
                           Yeah.

499
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:34,925
Good.

500
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,929
  Because I'd like us
to stay put for a while.

501
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:19,536
               â™ª

502
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,576
             SHELL:
        You look stupid.

503
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,679
            Mom says it makes me
                 look smart.

504
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,952
           Pancakes!

505
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,653
             And...

506
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:40,490
         fresh-squeezed
      Florida orange juice

507
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,092
    for my two lucky ladies.

508
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,694
               Why are we lucky?

509
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:45,462
   Because I took the day off
 so I could make you breakfast

510
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,031
         and drive you
  to your first day of school.

511
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,534
  But the bus comes
right to the driveway.

512
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:53,103
     I know, but I thought
   it would be a nice treat.

513
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,671
     But it comes
right to the driveway.

514
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,673
And I want to watch my two girls
     walk into that school

515
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,542
         with all those
        other rich kids.

516
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,278
 No, but I want
to ride the bus.

517
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,480
     Why are you giving me
such a hard time about this, MJ?

518
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,315
  Because I don't want to be
dropped off like a little kid.

519
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,050
I want to ride the bus.

520
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,728
           CHRISTINA:
        Remember, baby,

521
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,564
      you're the smartest
           girl here.

522
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,532
     (School bell ringing)

523
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,513
So?

524
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,015
         It's so cool.

525
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,583
    They have a treasure box
            in class

526
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,718
    that only the good girls
          get to see.

527
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,187
       And I already have
  a best friend, named Megan.

528
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,056
Great. So?

529
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,424
It's okay.

530
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:49,059
            She has a boyfriend.

531
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,260
What? I do not.

532
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,428
          Really? Who?

533
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,629
                     The boy
                down the street.

534
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,731
Wait, no, no.
And he's not.

535
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,334
His locker is next to mine.
        Jeez, spaz.

536
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:58,468
                            Hey!
           Hey, hey.

537
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,736
        Enough, enough.
           All right,

538
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,605
     I got to show you guys
           something.

539
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,545
Whoa.

540
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,783
                      Holy shit.
     Hey, watch your mouth.

541
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,786
   Okay, here's how it goes.

542
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:19,256
       That's for Bugsy.
          That's not.

543
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:31,802
               â™ª

544
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,702
              RAY:
Mm, that smells like homecoming.

545
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:40,403
             (Captain chuckling)

546
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:43,140
   Oh, yeah. And I'm thinking
of having some homecoming dinner

547
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,574
      over at Duke's joint
            tonight.

548
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:45,809
      You want to join me?

549
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,844
Well, as long as he's still
        got his mom

550
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,313
chained to the stove,
     absolutely.

551
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,349
       (Captain laughing)

552
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,551
             Shit.

553
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,453
                           What?
       They're stranded.

554
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:59,156
  CHRISTINA: How can you tell?
      CAPTAIN: The flare.

555
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,590
  Shit. Is everything covered?

556
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,826
Uh, mostly. But we didn't get
   everything underneath.

557
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:06,363
           CHRISTINA:
 Can't we just turn around and
pretend like we didn't see them?

558
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:09,332
 No. It's illegal to leave the
 scene of a vessel in distress.

559
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,268
        And they saw us.

560
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,439
          Coast Guard.

561
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,742
            Fuck me.

562
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,412
             Hello!

563
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,748
          Hey, there.

564
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,349
      What's the trouble?

565
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,851
         COAST GUARD OFFICER:
     We've been taking on water.

566
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,819
             Can you transfer us
                   to port?

567
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,223
           Of course.

568
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,424
                   Come onboard.

569
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,262
      COAST GUARD OFFICER:
  This is one beautiful skiff.

570
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,665
                       (Sighing)

571
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,366
       A container, huh?

572
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,503
All those cargo ships
  must have created

573
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:48,371
a debris field
on the way out.

574
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,807
I will be making a thorough
    and detailed report

575
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,475
once we get back
  to dry land.

576
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,748
       Work or pleasure?

577
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,651
Both. I'm working...

578
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:02,786
(Laughing)

579
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:03,954
...they are pleasuring.

580
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:05,889
     It's a honeymoon job.

581
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,324
      COAST GUARD OFFICER:
           Oh, I see.

582
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:10,460
          I've been on
     a few of those myself.

583
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,697
   Gentlemen, would you care
   to join me on the bridge?

584
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:14,864
          I got a nip
     of 12-year-old scotch

585
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,466
  I can't wait to break into.

586
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,268
      COAST GUARD OFFICER:
 No, sir. We are still on duty.

587
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,638
      Although a cup of joe
 always seems to calm my nerves.

588
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,406
Of course.

589
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,409
 Ray, would you mind making
the officer a cup of coffee?

590
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,546
    Oh, no, no. I don't want
     to bother your hires.

591
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:30,814
         I know my way
        around a galley.

592
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:31,982
          Oh, no, no.

593
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,717
       Come on, Captain.
           Tell him.

594
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,286
        He wants my cup
           of coffee.

595
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:39,522
        I mean, anything
      for the coastguard.

596
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,892
            CAPTAIN:
   Christina, would you mind
  bringing it up to the bridge

597
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,427
        when it's ready?

598
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,329
           Of course.

599
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,840
Hey.

600
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,910
      COAST GUARD OFFICER:
    You. You have mahogany?

601
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,577
That was fucking crazy, man.

602
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,381
I mean, those sea scouts
were on our fucking boat.

603
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,855
That's your cut.

604
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,726
It won't bite you.

605
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,528
                  Sure it won't.

606
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,553
       (Shell shrieking)

607
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,923
       They're biting me!
                      Come here!

608
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,904
(Gasping)

609
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,639
Where were you?
           (Gasping and panting)

610
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,446
     Up, up.
Arms up. Arms up.

611
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,550
I leave you for one day.

612
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,753
You kidding me?

613
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:51,454
It's okay.
                    (Whimpering)

614
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,022
Shh. It's okay.

615
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,125
It's okay. Hey, hey.

616
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,560
Shh. Look at me.
   It's okay.

617
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,028
           (Shushing)

618

619
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:20,984
             SANDY:
        Two more shots.

620
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:24,487
           He is hung
     like a fucking horse.

621
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,890
           Hey, how do you feel?

622
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,826
A little nervous.
                           Good.

623
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,127
    Terry, this is my girl,
             Chris.

624
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,762
       Nice to meet you,
          Girl Chris.

625
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,597
Nice to meet you,
   Boy Terry.

626
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,468
      Well, as a great fisherman
              once said,

627
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,604
    better is the end of a thing
        when it's beginning.

628
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,141
         I have no idea
  what the fuck you just said.

629
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,678
               No one does
        till they're at the end.

630
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,182
     (Speaking foreign language)

631
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,569
              Mom?

632
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,676
          (Indistinct murmuring)

633
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:21,010
Hey, what's going on?

634
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,646
       Sandy didn't show.
    Neither did the Captain.

635
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,949
        What do you mean
          didn't show?

636
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:28,084
           They left.
    They're not coming back.

637
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,762
Hey.

638
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,732
                   You must be
                 the hired help.

639
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,034
             I'm the Big Kahuna,

640
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,604
                  but my friends
                    call me BK.

641

        What's going on?

654
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,046
             Shit.

 We're still going to the beach

        Yeah, everything's cool.

661
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,263
            Just go back to bed.

666
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,286

667
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:20,123

00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,231
They're the hottest shit
       right now.

672
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:29,666
                 Really far out.

673
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:31,000
               Like, right now
            there's no current--

674
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,835
Nobody sounds like that.

675
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,671
                       MJ:
                Okay, yeah but--

676
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,239
              No, but the others
                 are legends.

677
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,808
Innovational.
Innovational.

678
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,809
                 Who's a legend?

679
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,177
                 (Laughing):
            You're out of your--

680
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,779
          You've lost your mind.

681
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,989
             SHELL:
    He's a jerk. I hate him.

682
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,157
    You don't even know him.

683
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,925
               He never says hi.

684
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:58,227
        And all he does
  is just look at your boobs.

685
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,003
   Would you like to go
on the slide, Mr. Doodles?

686
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:09,005
     Oh, yes. I would love
      to go on the slide.

687
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:11,240
Yeah, I love...

688
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,846
                 Are you fucking
                 kidding me, MJ?

689
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,282
              MJ!

690
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,017
       You get back here!

691
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,720
              MJ!

692
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:26,089
 You want to fuck up everything
      we got going here?!

693
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,290
                     MJ:
             Why does it matter?

694
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,392
Because I told you no one
     goes in there.

695
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,728
                So fucking what?
So fucking what?!

696
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,464
So fucking what?! Who the fuck
    do you think you are?

697
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:36,766
    Do you understand
what you could have done?

698
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:37,934
(Shell screaming)

699
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,202
Stop hurting her!

700
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,903
                       (Panting)

701
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,739
                     Get off me.

702
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,775
             Get out of my room!

703
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:48,778
       Jesus, I hate you!
    Get out! Shell, get out!

704
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,979
           (Panting)

705
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,517
                            Now!

706
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,976
           I'm leaving.
 You think you can stick around,

707
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:22,345
        or are you planning
  on prowling the neighbourhood?

708
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,516
      We should have never
           left Ohio.

709
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,553
        Because I don't want you
            ruining your life

710
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:32,355
               with the shithead
                   next door?

711
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,492
  Because Grandma took care
of Shell and I didn't have to.

712
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,362
   Don't worry about taking care
          of your sister.

713
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:42,231
I'll find someone who's thankful
 to have a roof over their head

714
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:45,501
       and doesn't mind a little
       responsibility in return.

715
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,573
           I'm disappointed, MJ.

716
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,945
   Stop acting like it was so
fucking great at your grandma's.

717
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,585
      (Crickets chirping)

718
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,056
             SHELL:
    Why do some look bigger
          than others?

719
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,091
              MJ:
         I don't know.

720
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,363
     Why are some brighter?

721
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,570
      Maybe they were born
           that way.

722
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,339
Why?

723
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,945
    God wanted it that way,
            I guess.

724
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,283
I don't think so.

725
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,419
     I think they were all
          born bright,

726
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:39,088
    and then after a while,

727
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,358
   all the stuff around them,
        dust and stuff,

728
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,993
        covered them up.

729
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:46,395
          So you just
        can't see them.

730
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:49,632
    But they're still bright
          underneath.

731
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:52,635
        It's still there
   if you look close enough.

732
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,476
    That's why you're going
        to be the doctor

733
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,112
         and I'm going
        to ride horses.

734
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,104
    (Indistinct chattering)

735
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,178
        MAN:
Who the fuck is that?

736
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,582
(Chain rattling)

737
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,020
                 You need a job?

738
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,236
        (Phone ringing)

739
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,573
                          Hello?

740
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,510
                     Yeah, yeah.
                     No problem.

741
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,247
                           Okay.

742
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,651
                 I have to leave
                 for a few days.

743
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,456
             Zada, you can take
            the reins from here?

744
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,705
  All right,
give me a kiss.

745
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:38,007
     Can we go to the beach
       when you get back?

746
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:40,176
      MJ really wants to.
                    No, I don't.

747
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,579
Yes, she does.

748
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,015
Sure.

749
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:47,550
All right, I'll call you
    when I get back.
                           Okay.

750
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:49,218
Bye, girls.

751
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,161
              MJ:
I'm already going to the beach.

752
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,030
             SHELL:
              How?

753
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,698
              MJ:
     Don't worry about it.

754
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,035
             WOMAN:
   But you got nice colours.

755
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,470
I'm so white.
                         I know.

756
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:10,039
         No, but it's beautiful.
                It's nice.

757
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,679
          (Squawking)

758
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,626
(Engine rumbling)

759
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,328
You got to be fucking
     kidding me.

760
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,330
                  What happened?
He just hit a fucking sandbar.

761
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:37,700
        Hey, I usually don't
    come in this way, all right?

762
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,802
         It's low tide
       and we're loaded.

763
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,472
                     Push! Push!

764
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,241
...three, push!

765
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,810
       (Grunting loudly)

766
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:50,513
                         Fuck...

767
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:52,281
      Oh! I think it moved
           a little.

768
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:53,449
        (All straining)

769
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:55,151
              Oh!

770
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,560
         (All groaning)

771
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,129
And a push!

772
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:08,297
Push!

773
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,734
           (Gasping)

774
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,303
Fuck!

775
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,139
                        Come on.

776
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,609
Fuck it. Fucker!

777
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,178
             Fuck!

778
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,746
             DUANE:
   It's just too heavy, man.

779
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,648
       Tell me something
  I don't fucking know, Duane!

780
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,183
           CHRISTINA:
             Push!

781
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,517
Come on!
              Oh!

782
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,219
        (All squawking)

783
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,659
      We're sitting ducks.

784
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:38,461
We just wait for the tide
   and we'll be fine.

785
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:40,529
We're throwing it.
       We are not throwing load.

786
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,264
      Radio the boss man.

787
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,167
He wants me to go down for him
 and there's no fucking way.

788
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:47,269
 Let me just think for a minute.
There's no fucking time

789
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,404
         to think, man!

790
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:49,805
         The sun is up!

791
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,340
    The cops are going to be
  crawling on my fucking boat!

792
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,175
          I don't owe
     the boss man nothing.

793
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:56,779
So grab a bale and get the fuck
      over the rail here.

794
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,320
      I'm not touching it.

795
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,864
               (Water splashing)

796
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,439
               (Water splashing)

797
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,393
       We have a problem.

798
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,831
   (Door opening and closing)

799
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,205
     Did you know that the study
          of human behaviour

800
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,807
              first began with
           the study of animals?

801
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,913
       Darwin discovered
          that animals

802
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:06,348
 exhibit patterns of behaviour
       based on survival

803
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,184
     and natural selection.

804
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,487
      And once you control
         the variables,

805
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:15,391
     those behaviours also
  can be limited, manipulated.

806
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,597
           In theory,

807
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,201
          if an animal
       is taken care of,

808
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:27,503
nurtured, fed...

809
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:32,808
it will exhibit behaviour
 that can be predicted.

810
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,348
       But every so often

811
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,784
         a random gene
         enters the mix

812
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:44,620
   and changes the direction
         of the group.

813
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:47,823
           And it has
        to be extracted.

814
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:51,293
     before the entire herd
   can duplicate the pattern.

815
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:54,330
Boss, I did not throw that load.
        I swear to God.

816
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,335
      You tell me exactly
         what happened.

817
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:10,012
    The rules exist
for a reason, Christina.

818
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,949
But I'm sure you already
    understand that.

819
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:19,855
Dollar a pound.

820
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,891
Your cut, plus BK
  and Duane's.

821
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:25,527
    They won't
be needing theirs.

822
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,767
It pays to be more intelligent
       than an animal.

823
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,913
           CHRISTINA:
             Terry?

824
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:21,550
                    TERRY:
              I'll be right out.

   MJ, put the magazine down.

842
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,976
     I love you very much.

843
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:59,481
         You know that,
           don't you?

844
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,956

to ever happen--

846
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,659
     What's going to happen
            to you?

00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,029
Nothing's going
to happen to me.

848
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,165
Nothing's going to happen.
        I just...

849
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:22,204
 I just want to make sure
that you know what to do...

850
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,207
if anything ever did.

851
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:28,143
I know you're
big girls now,

852
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:32,548
but if something does...

853
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:38,020
I want you to call your grandma
 so she can come get you, okay?

854
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:39,755
 What's going
to happen, Mom?

855
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:41,723
      Nothing's going to happen.

857
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,732
             Okay.

858
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,913
      You're going to need
   a larger boat than usual.

859
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:06,648
       Big enough to fit
          six tonnes.

860
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,750
              Wow.

861
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,121
           New group.

862
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,657
        Get someone else
         to handle it.

863
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,493
      No, I can handle it.

864
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,497
             Good.

865
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,165
       You wanted to make
         an impression.

866
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:26,602
  I figured I could trust you
          to do that.

867
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:30,072
     I'll take care of it.

           RAIN: Hey.

870
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,675
 Guess who's going out tonight?

871
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,277
   CHRISTINA: I have no idea.
         RAIN: We are.

872
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:09,678
           CHRISTINA:
         No, we're not.

873
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,113
             RAIN:
  Wait, wait. No, no. Please.

874
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:12,681
         Please, please, please,
             please, please.

875
00:59:12,683 --> 00:59:14,616
      It took me some real bo-jo
         to get these tickets.

876
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:16,985
Get what?
  Tickets to Blue Comet Cowboys.

877
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,587
           CHRISTINA:
    Hey, man, I got to work.

878
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:19,988
    I mean, maybe if you had
   given me a little notice.

879
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,723
                 Can't you skip?
No.

880
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,126
Wait, I'll go.

881
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,996
Absolutely not.
         Wait, why not?

882
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:29,598
Because.
          Because why?

883
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,134
         I finished off
          my homework.

884
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:33,569
      It's a school night.

885
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:35,237
      We wouldn't be late,
        would we, Rain?

886
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,072
      Nope, not too late.

887
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:41,877
              MJ:
  See? Mom, we won't be late.
            Please.

888
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,912
           CHRISTINA:
  I don't have time for this.

889
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:46,014
          It's my first concert.
What do you want me to say?

890
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:48,083
                            Yes.

891
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,719
                         Please.

892
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,088
Fine.

893
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,356
                  Oh, my God.
              Thank you so much.

894
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:56,792
              Thank you so much.
               Rain, I'm coming!

895
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,201
         Looking good.

896
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,271
             Right.

897
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,911
Now, since I know
  these dudes,

898
01:00:15,913 --> 01:00:18,680
we're going to be going
  backstage and shit.

899
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:20,916
      All right?
So you got to be cool.

900
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:22,818
Copasetic?

901
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,753
                        Totally.

902
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:25,921
All right.

903
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,727
        (Keys jingling)

904
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:32,961
You ready?
                           Yeah.

905
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,296
Okay.

906
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,937
      â™ª Will cause tyrants
          to tremble â™ª

907
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:46,208
     â™ª Or sink at our guns
  like the Cumberland's crew â™ª

908
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:50,112
          That's not a bad song.
             Mm-mm.

909
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,214
You know, I thought we would
       try something

910
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:54,049
a little more civilized
       tonight.

911
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:56,118
          Well, isn't that nice.

912
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,285
        Yeah. Beautiful.

913
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,755
           And I bet
      it tastes good too.

914
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:01,189
                    Smells good.

915
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,429
      (Rock music playing
          over radio)

916
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:25,947
Can I have some?

917
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,987
             Okay.

918
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,764

                 (Rain laughing)

921
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,027
Hola, chica.

922
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,895
                      CHRISTINA:
                          Hi.

923
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,263
CÃ³mo estÃ¡s?
How are you?

924
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:17,432
              Good, good.
       You got something for me?

925
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:20,235
Yes. The yacht behind us.

926
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,337
          It's coming.

927
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,440
                    Ah, gracias.

928
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:27,843
        Nothing like a cold beer
              on a hot day.

929
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:29,778
I know, right? Salud.
                      (Laughing)

930
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,379
                         Cheers.

931
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,349
Mm.

932
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:38,186
         So, does boss man--
    Where does he have you stay?

933
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:39,354
In Lauderdale.

934
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:41,323
      Ah. You live by the beach.

935
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:43,992
No. Our holding house
  is at the canal.

936
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:45,460
               Ah. The big ones.

937
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:47,529
Mm-hm.
                      (Laughing)

          He really knows how
      to take care of his girls.

939
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:53,001
Yes, he does.

     in front of the moon?

970
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:51,019
It's associated with warm fronts
         and moisture.

                  I'm in, Chris.

             Yeah?
        You got a call.

992
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,048

                     Be careful.

    now get your skanky ass
          out of here

Don't try to talk.

  I shouldn't
have let you go.

It's just that...

1212
01:23:30,539 --> 01:23:32,706
    â™ª Through darkened seas
           at night â™ª

1213
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:34,775
     â™ª And use the stars

1214
01:23:34,777 --> 01:23:37,177
 â™ª To guide my journey bright

1215
01:23:37,179 --> 01:23:39,446
      â™ª Oh, what a sight

1216
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:42,783
      â™ª When I sail away

1217
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,054
    â™ª High winds and waves

1218
01:23:47,056 --> 01:23:49,323
   â™ª This is a deadly ride

1219
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:51,358
       â™ª How can it be

1220
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,594
       â™ª That this is how
            I die? â™ª

1221
01:23:53,596 --> 01:23:56,030
      â™ª Who cried for me

1222
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:59,133
   â™ª When I'm going insane?

1223
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:28,362
       â™ª A sinking ship

1224
01:24:28,364 --> 01:24:30,330
   â™ª Out on the ocean blue

1225
01:24:30,332 --> 01:24:32,232
       â™ª It seems as if

1226
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,601
       â™ª My sailing days
         are through â™ª

1227
01:24:34,603 --> 01:24:36,770
     â™ª I'll know my drift

1228
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:40,674
         â™ª It's so sad,
           but true â™ª

1229
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,244
       â™ª Maybe the tide

1230
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,680
      â™ª Will bring me back
           someday â™ª

1231
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:48,682
      â™ª I guess for now

1232
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:50,784
  â™ª The sea will be my grave

1233
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:53,520
      â™ª For I must brave

1234
01:24:53,522 --> 01:24:56,757
      â™ª When I sail away

1235
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:03,263
        â™ª And as I sink
        into the ocean â™ª

1236
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:07,701
          â™ª On a ship
      that's lost at sea â™ª

1237
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:11,605
     â™ª Goodbye, land-loving
          strangers â™ª

1238
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:15,742
  â™ª Don't shed a tear for me
