这是怎么回事？
What's going on?

从所有的阳光。
So that your eyes don't burn out

任何瘸驴
跨州行。

00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:13,258
我们为什么要去
佛罗里达？
Why are we going
to Florida?

60
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,797

给我一个工作。

get me a job.

62
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:22,434
它就是这么简单
作为。
It's as simple
as that.

63
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,637
难道奶奶知道吗？
Does Grandma know?

64
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,706
我会告诉她
当我们到达那里。
I'll tell her
when we get there.

65
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,544
我需要得到那里
并提出一些金钱至上。
I need to get down there
and make some money first.

66
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,780
我不会坐在这里
并听她的
I'm not going to sit here
and listen to her

67
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,682
告诉我什么是他妈的
失败者我
tell me what a fucking
loser I am

对于有移动我们
回到她的房子。
for having to move us
back into her house.

69
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,320
那是与你没关系？
Is that okay with you?

70
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,225
你要么在
或者你就出局了。
You're either in
or you're out.

71
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,763
远行“77南。
Travelin' 77 south.

72
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,433
(Car engine starting)

73
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:14,486
â™ª

74
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,576
有纸牌做的房子
â™ª There's a house of cards

75
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,945
而且它灌进
â™ª And it's coming down

76
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,816
有一个跳动
的鼓
â™ª There's a beating
of a drum â™ª

77
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,986
但它不会发出声音
â™ª But it makes no sound

78
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,393
有一个瑟瑟的风
但树不摇曳
â™ª There's a howling wind
but the trees ain't swaying â™ª

79
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:57,863
有一个隐藏的真相
在的话你不说
â™ª There's a hidden truth
in the words you're not saying â™ª

80
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,998
这是一个更好的办法
â™ª It's a better way

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,968
的，路是出
â™ª And the way is out

82
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,872
锁定你的门。
CHRISTINA:
Lock your doors.

83
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,840
我们不希望一些卡车司机
爬行在这里
We wouldn't want some trucker
crawling in here

84
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,942
寻找一个温暖的床
充满淑女。
looking for a warm bed
full of ladies.

85

晚安，约翰 - 男孩。
Good night, John-Boy.

87
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,986
它不会是
永远。
It's not going to be
forever.

88
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,756
如果它很烂？
What if it sucks?

89
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,925
然后，我们会回去
奶奶的。
Then we'll go back
to Grandma's.

90
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,028
难道只是要
我们三个？
Is it just going to be
the three of us?

91
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,631
只是我们三个人。
Just the three of us.

92
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,600
你答应？
You promise?

在你的小家伙

(All chattering excitedly)

107
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,578
好吧，等待，等待，等待。
CHRISTINA:
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

108
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,681
等等，等等。
首先，让我停好车。
Wait, wait.
Let me park the car first.

109
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,518
桑迪
Sandy!

110
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,987
嘿，女孩。

哇，尼尔森，
不洒我的啤酒。
Whoa, Nellie,
don't spill my beer.

112
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,891
(Laughing)

113
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,861
来吧。
欢迎来到佛罗里达州，宝贝。
Come on.
Welcome to Florida, baby.

114
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:12,464
桑迪
Sandy!

115
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,132
啊哈
Aah!

116
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,005
但在清洁部
只是现在。
But the cleaning part
is just for now.

117
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,640
老板人有其他的东西
来了，
The boss man has other stuff
coming up,

118
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:25,143
但你将不得不满足
他在这之前发生。
but you're going to have to meet
him before that happens.

119
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,612
你觉得他是怎么回事
喜欢我？
Do you think he's going
to like me?

120
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,581
他会爱你。
He's going to love you.

121
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,016
为什么呢？
Why?

122
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:34,152
好吧，你是好看，
一。
Well, you're good-looking,
for one.

123
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,022
那必须做的是什么
用清洁的房子？
What does that have to do
with cleaning houses?

124
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,026
它没有。
It doesn't.

125
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,061
但它的问题。
But it matters.

126
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,538
(Objects crashing)

127
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,107
(Man and woman
arguing loudly)

128
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,010
有什么不对吗？
MAN:
What's wrong with you?!

129
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,012
回来这里，绍纳
Come back here, Shauna!

130
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,688
我不知道你为什么没
SHELL:
I don't know why you didn't

131
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,790
只是问她
如果你能拥有它。
just ask her
if you could have it.

132
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:15,126
我不想让她觉得
我很慈善的情况下，这就是原因。
I don't want her to think
I'm so charity case, that's why.

133
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,601
你从哪儿弄来的？
Where did you get that?

134
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,169
What?

135
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,538
含在嘴里的口香糖。
The gum in your mouth.

136
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,074
嗯...
Um...

137
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,510
回到那里。
back there.

138
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,211
回哪里？
Back where?

139
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,116
在店里。
In the store.

140
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,285
我们没有购买任何胶，
壳牌。
We didn't buy any gum,
Shell.

141
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,225
好吧，我不能
拿着它，
Well, I couldn't
hold it,

142
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,794
所以我把它
在我的口袋
so I put it
in my pocket

143
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,830
我忘了
它在那里。
and I forgot
it was there.

144
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,766
吐了出来。
Spit it out.

145
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,169
吐了出来。
Spit it out.

146
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,277
好了，我们要去
回去，
Okay, we're going
to go back,

147
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,613
而你要告诉
店里小姐你偷了它。
and you're going to tell
the store lady you stole it.

148
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,549
她可能会让你
回馈。
She'll probably make you
give something back.

149
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,918
为什么呢？
因为我们不是垃圾，壳牌。
Why?!
Because we're not trash, Shell.

150
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,119
我们不偷。
We don't steal.

151
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,154
我不是故意的。
I didn't mean to.

152
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,089
好吧，但你没有。
来吧。
Okay, but you did.
Come on.

153
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,659
太差劲了。
This sucks.

154
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,193
对不起，萌芽状态。
Sorry, bud.

155
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,132
让我们所有吃。

让我们做一些面食。
Let's make some pasta.

158
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,138
好吧，
祝我好运。
All right,
wish me luck.

159
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,606
为了什么？清洁？
For what? Cleaning?

160
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,808
祝你好运
谢谢，壳牌。
Good luck!
Thank you, Shell.

161
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,144
她会喜欢
住在这里。
She'll like
living here.

162
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:42,147
我要得到
食品。
I'm going to get
the food.

这是来不及回头
â™ª It's too late to turn back

166
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,860
那是他妈的

嗯。

Uh-huh.

我可以得到其中的一个？
Can I get one of those?

171

这是奇怪的

今晚
â™ª Tonight

Are you fucking

180
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,093
你好。

好吧，
没有人在这里。
All right,
nobody's here.

183
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,198
所有你必须做的
是灰尘的地方。
All you got to do
is dust the place.

184
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,899
你会发现一切
你需要在厨房里。

you need in the kitchen.

后来。
Later.

嘿。这是怎么回事，英里的Amiga？
嗯？
Hey. What's up, mi amiga?
Hmm?

203
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,780
你在做什么
到这里，桑迪？
What are you doing

工作。

是的，但是做什么的？
Yeah, but doing what?

207
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,254
要知道，同样的狗屎
我是做在俄亥俄州，
You know, same shit
I was doing in Ohio,

208
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,023
只是更大。
just bigger.

209
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,063
哎呀，克里斯，
它只是锅。
Jeez, Chris,
it's just pot.

210
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,498
多少大？
How much bigger?

211

不能说。
Can't say.

212

对不起，奇卡。
Sorry, chica.

说谁呢？
Says who?

215
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,875
老板人。
The boss man.

216
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,978
这就是现在的样子
他这样做了。
That's just the way
he does it.

217
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,291
好吧，看。
All right, look.

218
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,560
清洁是第一个梯级。
Cleaning's the first rung.

219
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,329
在这之后，
如果他喜欢你的工作
After that,
if he likes your work

220
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,832
那么你可以做
有趣的东西。
then you can do
the fun stuff.

221
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:23,468
如果没有，那么，
然后让我们只说
And if not, well,
then let's just say

222
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,937
你必须要找到你自己
一个新的老本行。
you got to find yourself
a new line of work.

223
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,438
哦，是吗？像什么？
Oh, yeah? Like what?

224
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,908
我不知道。
有一个漂亮的屁股。
I don't know.
Got a nice ass.

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,976
也许有点
去，去跳舞。
Maybe a little
go-go dancing.

226

如果你认为我会回来

没事，没事。

谢谢你能来这么快。
来到这里。
SANDY:
Thanks for coming so quick.
Come here.

233
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,127
好吧，
现在开始的乐趣。
All right,
now the fun starts.

234
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,930
所以这家伙雷，
这个炎热的纨绔子弟，
So this dude Ray,
this hot dude,

235
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,899
他会问你改变
在一个白色的皮卡车。
he's going to ask you for change
in a white pickup truck.

236
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,902
而我只是把它交给他？
就是这样。
And I just hand it to him?
That's it.

237
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,237
好的。
All right.

238
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,938
你确定你没事
这样做？
Are you sure you're all right
doing this?

239
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,075
因为这是
最后一站，克里斯。
Because this is
the last stop, Chris.

240
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,144
好吧。
Okay.

241
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,448
他将被期待
我的车。拿去吧。
He's going to be expecting
my car. Take it.

Wow, Sandy.

244
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,933
Either you got
better-looking

245
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,434
or I'm about to meet
the new girl

246
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,903
boss man's been
talking about.

247
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,537
You better not let Sandy
hear you say that.

248
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,307
It'll be our little
secret.

249
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,309
How do you know
I can keep one?

250
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:14,112
只是一种感觉。
Just a feeling.

251
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,449
你有一些变化
给我吗？
You got some change
for me?

252
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:37,602
你看，如果你需要
导游或任何东西，
Look, if you ever need
a tour guide or anything,

253
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,204
我每小时收费
是相当合理的。

is pretty reasonable.

Ray. So I guess the position
of the tour guide is taken.

256

获得第一个名字。

我会带你四处看看
大沼泽地。
I'll show you around
the Everglades.

260

你，呃...
You, uh...

261
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,999
你可能认识
一些家庭成员那里。

是啊。
Yeah.

269
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,332
我希望。
I wish.

啊，对父母，对吧？
我明白了。
Ah, the parents, huh?
I get it.

是啊，我的妈妈。
Yeah, my mom.

273

那么，什么是，呃...
So, what's, uh...

274
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,611
什么是你的妈妈吗？
what's your mom do?

275

00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,078
好看。
Look good.

285
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,546
什么？这是不工作
你吗？
What? This isn't working
for you?

286
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,148
(Laughing)

287
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,716
不过，我闻到这么好。
But I smell so good.

288
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,221
你知道，
CHRISTINA:
You know,

289
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,425
你可能想尝试住
内的行。
you might want to try staying
inside the lines.

290
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,326
好吧。
Okay.

291
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:52,336
â™ª

292
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,608
有什么话，烫发？
What's the word, perm?

293
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,245
嘿。
Hey.

294
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,513
真的吗？
Really?

295
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,649
来吧。
看看你。
Come on.
Look at you.

296
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,184
真的吗？
Seriously?

297
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,552
我好看。
I look good.

298
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,854
(Engine starting)

299
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,256
看，不花这一切
在一个地方，
Look, don't spend it all
in one place,

300
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,125
并确保壳牌
得到吃的东西
and make sure Shell
gets something to eat

301
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,827
这不是糖，
没事吧？
that isn't sugar,
all right?

302
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,696
你看起来不错，顺便说一句。
You look nice, by the way.

303
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,265
谢谢。
Thank you.

304
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,421
让你的鞋子。
Get your shoes on.

305
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,201
(Indistinct chattering)

306
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,874
俄亥俄小姐。
Miss Ohio.

307
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,409
毫米毫米。我很高兴
你终于可以
Mm-mm. I'm glad
you could finally

308
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,411
恩我们
有你的存在。
grace us
with your presence.

309
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,614
这是，嗯，
And this is, well,

310
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:12,216
我们喜欢叫他
船长。
we like to call him
the Captain.

311
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,152
你好。克里斯蒂娜。
Hi. Christina.

312
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,786
快感。
Pleasure.

313
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,723
我听说某种
谣言对能够的
I heard some kind
of rumour about being able

314
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,192
吃了厨房地板
在鸟屋。
to eat off the kitchen floor
at the bird house.

315
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,295
不是这样的
当桑迪是在它。
Wasn't like that
when Sandy was at it.

316
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,730
来吧。
Come on.

317
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,266
你知道在哪里
我所擅长的领域，嗯？
You know where
my skills lie, hmm?

318
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,569
所以，呃，哪儿来
你们两人见面？
So, uh, where did
you two meet?

319
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,938
我们一起跳舞在这个地方
所谓Ember的墓。
We danced together at this place
called Ember's Tomb.

320
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,574
呵呵，小伙子。午餐转变。
什么是shithole。
Oh, boy. Lunch shift.
What a shithole.

321
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:37,742
(Laughing)

322
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,577
你的房子的？
是啊。
You work in the houses?
Yeah.

323
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,946
时间不长。
Not for long.

324
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,882
是的，当然。
CAPTAIN:
Yeah, of course.

325
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,284
来吧，跟我走。
SANDY:
Come on, follow me.

326
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,853
我想告诉你
东西。
I want to show you
something.

327
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,224
认识你很高兴。
Nice to meet you.

328
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,210
你想
跳舞吗？
Would you like
to dance?

329
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,316
当然可以。
Sure.

330
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,298
我听说过一些真正的好东西
你，克里斯蒂娜。
I've heard some real good things
about you, Christina.

331
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,472
您必须是
老板人。
You must be
the boss man.

332
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,315
傍晚。
Evening.

333
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,330
哎，得了一根烟？
Hey, got a cigarette?

334
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,833
当然可以。
Sure.

335
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,773
你爸知道
你在这里？
Your dad know
you out here?

336
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,509
不，他并不在乎。
No. He doesn't care.

337
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,713
克里斯。
Chris.

338
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,049
扎达。
Zada.

339
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,718
我在楼上，如果你曾经
需要什么。
I'm upstairs if you ever
need anything.

340
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,053
谢谢。
Thanks.

341
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,662
嘿。我希望你的屁股
是今晚有空。
Hey. I hope your ass
is free tonight.

342
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,030
为什么呢？这是怎么回事？
Why? What's up?

343
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:40,998
我们正在庆祝
We're celebrating.

344
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,471
他妈的什么，已经？
Fucking what, already?

345
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,007
你第一次出来。
Your first trip out.

346
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,810
真的吗？
Really?

347
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,478
什么时候？
When?

348
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,315
老板人想要你
在水面上的ASAP。
Boss man wants you
on the water ASAP.

349
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:01,485
显然，你有
潜力。
Apparently you got
potential.

350
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,387
凉爽。
Cool.

351
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,891
好吧，
首先第一件事情。
All right,
first things first.

352
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,492
该规则。
The rules.

353
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,894
跟我来。
Follow me.

354
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,865
一：无采样负载。
One: no sampling the load.

355
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,401
二：从来没有，
曾经抛出一个负载。
Two: never,
ever throw a load.

356
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,970
三：没有任何关系
里面的组织。
And three: no relationships
inside the organization.

357
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,340
老板人不喜欢
右手知道
The boss man does not like
the right hand knowing

358
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,841
什么左手在做什么。
what the left hand's doing.

359
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,377
Comprende?
What?

360
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,879
I'm not fucking around here,
Chris.

361
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,381
你一定要注意。
You got to pay attention.

362
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,616
我在这里为你，桑迪。
你需要什么。
I'm here for you, Sandy.
Whatever you need.

363
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,818
好的。
All right.

364
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,587
我们必须做的第一件事
是找到了一条船。
First thing we got to do
is find a boat.

365
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,055
那家怎么样？
How about that one?

366
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,891
太大了。我们正在寻找
30 - 到40英尺的渔船。
Too big. We're looking for
a 30- to 40-foot fishing boat.

367
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,494
还有更大的
吸引太多的关注。
Anything bigger
draws too much attention.

368
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:46,597
更小的东西不具有
足够的存储空间。
Anything smaller doesn't have
enough storage.

369
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,532
好吧，克里斯。
让我们来看看你得到了什么。
All right, Chris.
Let's see what you got.

370
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,934
这家伙的凉爽。
This guy's cool.

371
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,137
船上的人？
Anyone aboard?

372
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,442
我可以帮你吗？
你好。
Can I help you?
Hi.

373
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,946
呃，我想知道
如果你租你的船。
Uh, I was wondering
if you rent your boat.

374
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,949
当然有，但我不会左右
运行它。
Sure do, but I won't be around
to run it.

375
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,550
我有一些亲戚
在城里。
I've got some relatives
in town.

376
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,085
你必须开始思考
像一个水手。
You got to start thinking
like a sailor.

377
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:09,887
所以只想
买食物，保持，
So you only want
to buy food that keeps,

378
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,756
因为你永远不知道过了多久
你要到这里来了。
because you never know how long
you're going to be out there.

379
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:14,959
你想罐头，干，腌，
抽烟，但只有好东西。
You want canned, dry, pickled,
smoked, but only the good stuff.

380
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,528
你看，克里斯，我们正在药物，
不是火箭。
Look, Chris, we're moving drugs,
not rockets.

381
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,631
就做好你的工作，
并期待好做。
Just be good at your job,
and look good doing it.

382
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,881
我，哦，我的。
My, oh, my.

383
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,816
必须是命运。
Must be destiny.

384
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:39,984
你知道雷，
船长。
You know Ray,
the Captain.

385
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,419
这是杜安。
And this is Duane.

386
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,720
他是最好的渔夫
在佛罗里达州。
He's the best fisherman
in Florida.

387
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,088
你让好咖啡？
You make good coffee?

388
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,723
- 我一直在说。
- 嗯，你最好，
I've been told.
RAY:
Well, you better,

389
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,591
因为我们得到了一个火热日期
早上用这个魔术师，
because we got a hot date in
the morning with this charmer,

390
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,660
而你不想要
看他后面的车轮
and you don't want
to see him behind the wheel

391
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,929
当桑迪的煮咖啡。
when Sandy's making coffee.

392
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,932
这是我的新朋友。
(Snorting)
This is my new friend.

393
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,601
雨。你要吗？
Rain. You want some?

394
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,173
(Erotic rock music playing)

395
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,850
这里，我去
飘落下来，下来，下来
â™ª Here I go
falling down, down, down â™ª

396
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,552
我的头脑一片空白
â™ª My mind is a blank

397
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:18,022
我的头纺纱
一圈又一圈
â™ª My head is spinning
around and around â™ª

398
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:22,493
我去深
爱情的漏斗
â™ª As I go deep
into the funnel of love â™ª

399
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:28,065
这是如此疯狂，
疯狂的感觉
â™ª It's such a crazy,
crazy feeling â™ª

400
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,034
我变得软弱的膝盖
â™ª I get weak in the knees

401
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,703
我可怜的老首长
是缫丝
â™ª My poor old head
is reeling â™ª

402
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:37,041
我去深
爱情的漏斗
â™ª As I go deep
into the funnel of love â™ª

403
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:42,847
我试过，我试过
运行和隐藏
â™ª I tried and I tried
to run and hide â™ª

404
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,584
甚至试图逃跑
â™ª Even tried to run away

405
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:50,554
你就不能运行
从爱情的漏斗
â™ª You just can't run
from the funnel of love â™ª

406
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,790
什么星星说，
队长？
What do the stars say,
captain?

407
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,526
我们是否有麻烦？
Are we in trouble?

408
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,661
当然看起来是这样。
Sure looks that way.

409
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,779
你多久去
要到哪里去了？
How long are you going
to be gone?

410
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:17,615
几天。
A couple of days.

411
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,183
嘿。
Hey.

412
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,785
我没想到你们
打算做出来。
I didn't think you guys
were going to make it.

413
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,054
(Chuckling)

414
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,972
嘿，漂亮。
Hey, beautiful.

415
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,041
什么样的诱饵
您使用的是？
What kind of bait
you using?

416
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,311
我不是。
I'm not.

417
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,847
好吧，你一定要提供
鱼什么的，亲爱的。
Well, you got to offer
the fish something, darling.

418
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,249
我以为那只是
应该看起来像
I thought it was just
supposed to look like

419
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,118
我们在这里
钓鱼。
we're out here
fishing.

420
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,287
我的意思是，这是，你知道吗？
I mean, it is, you know?

421
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,055
但我们不妨看看
什么海神所提供的
But we might as well see
what Poseidon has to offer

422
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,925
而我们正在做，
对不对？
while we're doing it,
right?

423
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:03,027
让我们来看看
我们来到这里。
Let's see what
we got here.

424
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,596
好的。好吧。
All right. Okay.

425
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,266
其实，
你知道吗？
Actually,
you know what?

426
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:13,037
这是运气不好有一个人
你的饵钩。来到这里。
It's bad luck to have someone
bait your hook. Come here.

427
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,638
来到这里。
Come here.

428
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,310
你知道，我从来没有把你
对于娇气的类型。
You know, I never took you
for the squeamish type.

429
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:22,146
我不是。这只是我从来没有
使用的东西这么大。
I'm not. It's just I've never
used something so big.

430
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,582
你给我一个鲦鱼
和我一切都结束吧。
You give me a minnow
and I'm all over it.

431
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,116
嗯，这是相同的
原则。
Well, it's the same
principle.

432
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,986
你会希望得到它
上有好和安全，
You're going to want to get it
on there nice and secure,

433
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:32,790
并留下刚好够垂
以获得他们的注意。
and leave just enough dangle
to get their attention.

434
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,335
翻转的开关。
Flip that switch.

435
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,391
来吧，
我们得到的母舰。
Come on,
we got the mothership.

436
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,850
认为你有这个，俄亥俄小姐？
RAY:
Think you got this, Miss Ohio?

437
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,021
难道你不担心
关于警察？
Don't you worry
about cops?

438
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:40,190
号国际水域。
No. International waters.

439
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,728
它在哪里何去何从？
CHRISTINA:
Where does it go from here?

440
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,264
内陆地区。
RAY:
Inland.

441
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,966
你知道，
老板的房子，
You know,
the boss's houses,

442
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:51,802
我们持有它，直到
它拿起，去北方。
where we hold it until
it's picked up and goes north.

443
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,844
(Knocking at door)

444
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,788
让你的狗屎包装，
女孩子。
Get your shit packed,
girls.

445
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,756
嘿。
嗯。
Hey.
Hmm.

446
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,960
起床了。
Get up.

447
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:26,970
â™ª

448
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,378
嗯？来吧。
Well? Come on.

449
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,480
这一切都属于你。
It's all yours.

450
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,785
哦，哇。
Oh, wow.

451
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,454
(Laughing)

452
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,360
(Indistinct chattering)

453
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,070
好的。
CHRISTINA:
All right.

454
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,005
我想我可以
处理这个问题。
I think I can
handle this.

455
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,808
(Playing notes)

456
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,976
(Laughing)

457
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,177
不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no.

458
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:08,345
让我告诉你
它是如何做。
Let me show you
how it's done.

459
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,880
好吧。
好的。
Okay.
All right.

460
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,348
(Playing)

461
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,226
(Laughing)

462
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,261
好的。
All right.

463
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,332
告诉你了。
Told you.

464
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:30,400
(Snickering)

465
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,077
没办法。
No way.

466
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,279
来到这里。
Come here.

467
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,781
(Making kissing sounds)

468
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:44,815
你好。
Hi.

469
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:47,017
(Laughing)

470
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,353
你好。你好。
Hi. Hi.

471
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,522
嗨，芽。
你叫什么名字？
Hi, bud.
What's your name?

472
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:53,357
桑迪告诉妈咪
SHELL:
Sandy told Mommy

473
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,425
它是一个礼物
从老板的人。
it's a gift
from the boss man.

474
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,062
如果他不
像我们这样的？
What if he doesn't
like us?

475
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,499
然后，我们将...
Then we'll...

476
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,268
我们会跑掉
对马
We'll run away
on the horse

477
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,003
和奶奶打电话
来帮我们。
and call Grandma
to come get us.

478
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:07,871
我们可以做到这一点？
Can we do that?

479
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,973
是啊。
Yeah.

480
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,109
奶奶说
我是个成年人了，
Grandma said
I'm an adult now,

481
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:15,279
我可以离开
每当我想要的。
and I can leave
whenever I want.

482
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,514
我的意思是拿马。
I mean take the horse.

483
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,983
她说，这是
礼物，对不对？
She said it was
a gift, right?

484
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,018
是啊。
Yeah.

485
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,320
然后，它是我们的。
Then it's ours.

486
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,128
(Engine sputtering distantly)

487
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,496
(Vehicle approaching)

488
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,107
(Engine shuts off)

489
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,046
妈妈？
Mom?

490
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,382
关灯。
Turn the light off.

491
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:54,585
来到这里。
Come here.

492
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,398
你想保留的马？
CHRISTINA:
Do you want to keep the horse?

493
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,905
那么你一定要冷静，
MJ。
Then you got to be cool,
MJ.

494
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,574
老板人的存储
有些东西在里面，
Boss man's storing
some stuff in there,

495
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:21,011
我们需要冷静
关于它。
and we need to be cool
about it.

496
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:27,885
没有人，但我说，你还是壳牌
去谷仓内。
No one but me, you or Shell
goes inside the barn.

497
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,419
你明白吗？
You understand?

498
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,323
是啊。
Yeah.

499
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:34,925
好。
Good.

500
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,929
因为我希望我们
原地不动一段时间。
Because I'd like us
to stay put for a while.

501
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:19,536
â™ª

502
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,576
SHELL:
You look stupid.

503
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,679
Mom says it makes me
look smart.

504
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,952
煎饼
Pancakes!

505
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,653
和...
And...

506
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:40,490
鲜榨
佛罗里达橙汁
fresh-squeezed
Florida orange juice

507
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,092
我的两位幸运的女士。
for my two lucky ladies.

508
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,694
为什么我们的幸运？
Why are we lucky?

509
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:45,462
因为我花了一天假
这样我就可以让你的早餐
Because I took the day off
so I could make you breakfast

510
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,031
并开车送你
上学的第一天。
and drive you
to your first day of school.

511
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,534
但公交车来
右边的车道。
But the bus comes
right to the driveway.

512
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:53,103
我知道，但我想
这将是一个很好的治疗。
I know, but I thought
it would be a nice treat.

513
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:54,671
但它
右边的车道。
But it comes
right to the driveway.

514
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,673
我想看着我的两个女孩
走进那所学校
And I want to watch my two girls
walk into that school

515
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,542
与所有这些
其他富家子弟。
with all those
other rich kids.

516
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,278
没有，但我想
坐公车。
No, but I want
to ride the bus.

517
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,480
你为什么给我
关于这个如此艰难的时刻，MJ？
Why are you giving me
such a hard time about this, MJ?

518
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,315
因为我不希望
就像一个小孩子下车。
Because I don't want to be
dropped off like a little kid.

519
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,050
我想坐公共汽车。
I want to ride the bus.

520
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,728
记住，宝宝，
CHRISTINA:
Remember, baby,

521
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,564
你是最聪明的
女孩在这里。
you're the smartest
girl here.

522
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,532
(School bell ringing)

523
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,513
所以呢？
So?

524
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,015
这太酷了。
It's so cool.

525
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,583
他们有一个宝盒
在课堂
They have a treasure box
in class

526
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,718
只有好女孩
能看到。
that only the good girls
get to see.

527
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,187
而且我已经有
一个最好的朋友，叫梅根。
And I already have
a best friend, named Megan.

528
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,056
大。所以呢？
Great. So?

529
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,424
这没关系。
It's okay.

530
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:49,059
她有一个男朋友。
She has a boyfriend.

531
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,260
什么？我不知道。
What? I do not.

532
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,428
真的吗？谁？
Really? Who?

533
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,629
男孩
在街上。
The boy
down the street.

534
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,731
等等，不，不。
而他不是。
Wait, no, no.
And he's not.

535
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,334
他的更衣室旁边是我的。
哎呀，怪人。
His locker is next to mine.
Jeez, spaz.

536
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:58,468
嘿
嘿，嘿。
Hey!
Hey, hey.

537
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,736
够了，够了。
好吧，
Enough, enough.
All right,

538
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,605
我得给你们
东西。
I got to show you guys
something.

539
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,545
哇。
Whoa.

540
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,783
神圣的狗屎。
嘿，看你的嘴。
Holy shit.
Hey, watch your mouth.

541
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,786
好吧，这里是怎么回事。
Okay, here's how it goes.

542
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:19,256
这对巴格西。
这不是。
That's for Bugsy.
That's not.

543
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:31,802
â™ª

544
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,702
嗯，那闻起来像衣锦还乡。
RAY:
Mm, that smells like homecoming.

545
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:40,403
(Captain chuckling)

546
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:43,140
哦，是的。而且我想
具有一定衣锦还乡晚餐
Oh, yeah. And I'm thinking
of having some homecoming dinner

547
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,574
对在杜克大学的联合
今晚。
over at Duke's joint
tonight.

548
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:45,809
你想和我一起？
You want to join me?

549
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,844
好了，只要他仍然
得到了他的妈妈
Well, as long as he's still
got his mom

550
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,313
拴在炉子上，
绝对。
chained to the stove,
absolutely.

551
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,349
(Captain laughing)

552
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,551
妈的。
Shit.

553
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,453
什么？
他们搁浅。
What?
They're stranded.

554
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:59,156
- 你怎么知道？
- 火炬。
CHRISTINA: How can you tell?
CAPTAIN: The flare.

555
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,590
妈的。一切都被覆盖？
Shit. Is everything covered?

556
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,826
呃，主要是。但我们没有得到
下面的一切。
Uh, mostly. But we didn't get
everything underneath.

557
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:06,363
难道我们不能转身
并假装我们没有看到他们？
CHRISTINA:
Can't we just turn around and
pretend like we didn't see them?

558
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:09,332
不，这是违法的离开
现场遇险的船只。
No. It's illegal to leave the
scene of a vessel in distress.

559
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,268
他们看见我们。
And they saw us.

560
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,439
海岸警卫队。
Coast Guard.

561
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,742
他妈的我。
Fuck me.

562
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,412
您好
Hello!

563
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,748
嘿，有。
Hey, there.

564
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,349
有什么麻烦？
What's the trouble?

565
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,851
我们一直在服用水。
COAST GUARD OFFICER:
We've been taking on water.

566
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,819
你可以转移我们
端口？
Can you transfer us
to port?

567
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,223
当然。
Of course.

568
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,424
船上来。
Come onboard.

569
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,262
这是一款漂亮的小船。
COAST GUARD OFFICER:
This is one beautiful skiff.

570
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,665
(Sighing)

571
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,366
容器，是吧？
A container, huh?

572
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,503
所有这些货船
必须已创建
All those cargo ships
must have created

573
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:48,371
一个碎片场
的出路。
a debris field
on the way out.

574
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,807
我会做一个彻底的
和详细的报告
I will be making a thorough
and detailed report

575
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,475
一旦我们找回
旱地。
once we get back
to dry land.

576
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,748
工作或休闲？
Work or pleasure?

577
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,651
两者。我的工作...
Both. I'm working...

578
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:02,786
(Laughing)

579
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:03,954
......他们愉悦。
...they are pleasuring.

580
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:05,889
这是一个度蜜月的工作。
It's a honeymoon job.

581
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,324
哦，我明白了。
COAST GUARD OFFICER:
Oh, I see.

582
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:10,460
我一直在
几个这个我自己。
I've been on
a few of those myself.

583
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,697
先生们，你们会在乎
和我一起在桥上？
Gentlemen, would you care
to join me on the bridge?

584
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:14,864
我有一个夹
12岁的苏格兰威士忌
I got a nip
of 12-year-old scotch

585
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,466
我迫不及待地闯入。
I can't wait to break into.

586
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:18,268
不，先生。我们仍然值班。
COAST GUARD OFFICER:
No, sir. We are still on duty.

587
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,638
虽然乔杯
似乎总是镇定我的神经。
Although a cup of joe
always seems to calm my nerves.

588
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,406
当然。
Of course.

589
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,409
雷，你会介意制作
官一杯咖啡？
Ray, would you mind making
the officer a cup of coffee?

590
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,546
哦，不，不。我不想
打扰你的员工。
Oh, no, no. I don't want
to bother your hires.

591
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:30,814
我知道我的路
围绕一个厨房。
I know my way
around a galley.

592
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:31,982
哦，不，不。
Oh, no, no.

593
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,717
来吧，舰长。
告诉他。
Come on, Captain.
Tell him.

594
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,286
他想要我的杯子
咖啡。
He wants my cup
of coffee.

595
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:39,522
我的意思是，任何事情
为海岸警卫队。
I mean, anything
for the coastguard.

596
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,892
克里斯蒂娜，你会
介意把它到桥
CAPTAIN:
Christina, would you mind
bringing it up to the bridge

597
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,427
当它准备？
when it's ready?

598
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,329
当然。
Of course.

599
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,840
嘿。
Hey.

600
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,910
您。你有红木？
COAST GUARD OFFICER:
You. You have mahogany?

601
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,577
这是他妈的疯了，伙计。
That was fucking crazy, man.

602
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,381
我的意思是，那些球探海
是我们他妈的船。
I mean, those sea scouts
were on our fucking boat.

603
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,855
那是你晋级。
That's your cut.

604
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,726
它不会咬你。
It won't bite you.

605
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,528
当然不会。
Sure it won't.

606
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,553
(Shell shrieking)

607
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,923
他们在咬我
来这里
They're biting me!
Come here!

608
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,904
(Gasping)

609
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,639
你在哪里？
Where were you?
(Gasping and panting)

610
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,446
起来，起来。
双臂。双臂。
Up, up.
Arms up. Arms up.

611
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,550
我离开你一天。
I leave you for one day.

612
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,753
你在开玩笑吧？
You kidding me?

613
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:51,454
这没关系。
It's okay.
(Whimpering)

614
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,022
嘘。这没关系。
Shh. It's okay.

615
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,125
这没关系。嘿，嘿。
It's okay. Hey, hey.

616
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,560
嘘。看我。
这没关系。
Shh. Look at me.
It's okay.

617
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,028
(Shushing)

618
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:19,416
â™ª

619
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:20,984
两个更多的投篮。
SANDY:
Two more shots.

620
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:24,487
他是鸿
像一个他妈的马。
He is hung
like a fucking horse.

621
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,890
嘿，你感觉如何？
Hey, how do you feel?

622
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,826
有点紧张。
好。
A little nervous.
Good.

623
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,127
特里，这是我的女孩，
克里斯。
Terry, this is my girl,
Chris.

624
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,762
很高兴见到你，
女孩克里斯。
Nice to meet you,
Girl Chris.

625
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,597
很高兴见到你，
男孩特里。
Nice to meet you,
Boy Terry.

626
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,468
那么，作为一个伟大的渔夫
曾经说过，
Well, as a great fisherman
once said,

627
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,604
更好的是一个事物的结束
当它开始。
better is the end of a thing
when it's beginning.

628
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,141
我不知道
你刚才说什么他妈的。
I have no idea
what the fuck you just said.

629
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,678
没有人做
直到他们在最后。
No one does
till they're at the end.

630
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,182
(Speaking foreign language)

631
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,569
妈妈？
Mom?

632
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,676
(Indistinct murmuring)

633
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:21,010
嘿，这是怎么回事？
Hey, what's going on?

634
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,646
桑迪没有显示。
无论做了队长。
Sandy didn't show.
Neither did the Captain.

635
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,949
你是什么意思
没有显示？
What do you mean
didn't show?

636
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:28,084
他们离开。
他们不会回来了。
They left.
They're not coming back.

637
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,762
嘿。
Hey.

638
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,732
您必须是
请来帮忙。
You must be
the hired help.

639
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,034
我是大暗礁，
I'm the Big Kahuna,

640
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,604
但我的朋友
打电话给我BK。
but my friends
call me BK.

641
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,040
(Phone line ringing)

642
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,144
喂？
RAY:
Hello?

643
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,779
射线，这是怎么回事？
CHRISTINA:
Ray, what's going on?

644
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,248
我不知道。
RAY:
I don't know.

645
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,083
队长抓起桑迪
昨天深夜
Captain grabbed Sandy
late last night

646
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:01,217
和跳过镇。
and skipped town.

647
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:02,886
老板人的生气。
The boss man's pissed.

648
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:05,522
所以只是低调
一会儿。
So just lay low
for a bit.

649
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,158
是啊。好吧。
CHRISTINA:
Yeah. Okay.

650
00:42:52,236 --> 00:43:02,245
â™ª

651
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,853
(Indistinct chattering)

652
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,366
(All laughing)

653
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,110
这是怎么回事？
What's going on?

654
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,046
妈的。
Shit.

655
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:39,382
你在做什么呢？
What are you doing up?

656
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,719
你回来了。
You're back.

657
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,387
回去睡觉，宝贝。
CHRISTINA:
Go back to bed, baby.

658
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,957
(Snickering)

659
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,793
我们还是去海边
早上，对不对？
We're still going to the beach
in the morning, right?

660
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,128
是啊，一切都很酷。
CHRISTINA:
Yeah, everything's cool.

661
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,263
刚回去睡觉了。
Just go back to bed.

662
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,336
反正...
Anyway...

663
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,405
(All laughing drunkenly)

664
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,748
哦，上帝你他妈的疯了
(Laughing):
Oh, God! You're fucking crazy!

665
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,918
不是很兴奋，
RAIN:
Not very exciting,

666
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,286
但如果我不得不选择一个，
but if I had to pick one,

667
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:20,123
如果这是最后一天
在地球上，
if it was the last day
on planet Earth,

668
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:23,259
我会选择利群
在蜜蜂啧啧的。
I'd pick ABBA
over the Bee Gee's.

669
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:25,361
每个人都不过你。
MJ:
Everybody but you.

670
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:26,763
你在开玩笑吧？
RAIN:
Are you kidding me?

671
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,231
他们是最热的狗屎
现在。
They're the hottest shit
right now.

672
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:29,666
真的不远了。
Really far out.

673
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:31,000
喜欢，就是现在
没有电流...
Like, right now
there's no current--

674
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,835
没有人听起来好像是。
Nobody sounds like that.

675
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,671
好吧，是的，可是......
MJ:
Okay, yeah but--

676
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,239
没有，但其他人
是传说。
No, but the others
are legends.

677
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,808
创新。
创新。
Innovational.
Innovational.

678
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,809
谁是传奇？
Who's a legend?

679
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:41,177
你出你的...
(Laughing):
You're out of your--

680
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,779
你已经失去了你的心。
You've lost your mind.

681
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,989
他是个混蛋。我恨他。
SHELL:
He's a jerk. I hate him.

682
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:54,157
你甚至不知道他的。
You don't even know him.

683
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,925
他从不说喜。
He never says hi.

684
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:58,227
而他所做的一切
只是看你的胸部。
And all he does
is just look at your boobs.

685
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,003
你喜欢去
在幻灯片上，涂鸦先生？
Would you like to go
on the slide, Mr. Doodles?

686
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:09,005
哦，是的。我喜欢
走在幻灯片上。
Oh, yes. I would love
to go on the slide.

687
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:11,240
是的，我爱...
Yeah, I love...

688
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,846
你他妈的
开玩笑吧，MJ？
Are you fucking
kidding me, MJ?

689
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,282
MJ
MJ!

690
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,017
你回来了
You get back here!

691
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:23,720
MJ
MJ!

692
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:26,089
你想他妈的了一切
我们竟能在这里？
You want to fuck up everything
we got going here?!

693
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,290
为什么这很重要？
MJ:
Why does it matter?

694
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,392
因为我告诉你没有人
去那里。
Because I told you no one
goes in there.

695
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,728
所以他妈的什么？
所以他妈的什么？
So fucking what?
So fucking what?!

696
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:34,464
所以他妈的什么？谁他妈的
你以为你是谁？
So fucking what?! Who the fuck
do you think you are?

697
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:36,766
你明白
你可以这样做？
Do you understand
what you could have done?

698
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:37,934
(Shell screaming)

699
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,202
停止伤害她
Stop hurting her!

700
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,903
(Panting)

701
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,739
我下车。
Get off me.

702
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,775
滚出我的房间
Get out of my room!

703
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:48,778
耶稣，我恨你
滚出去壳牌，滚出去
Jesus, I hate you!
Get out! Shell, get out!

704
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,979
(Panting)

705
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,517
现在
Now!

706
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,976
我要走了。
你认为你能留下来，
I'm leaving.
You think you can stick around,

707
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:22,345
或者你打算
在窜来窜去的邻里关系？
or are you planning
on prowling the neighbourhood?

708
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,516
我们应该永远
左俄亥俄州。
We should have never
left Ohio.

709
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,553
因为我不想让你
毁了你的生活
Because I don't want you
ruining your life

710
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:32,355
与shithead
隔壁？
with the shithead
next door?

711
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,492
因为奶奶照顾
壳牌和我没得。
Because Grandma took care
of Shell and I didn't have to.

712
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:39,362
不要担心照顾
你的妹妹。
Don't worry about taking care
of your sister.

713
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:42,231
我会找到谁是感激
有瓦遮头
I'll find someone who's thankful
to have a roof over their head

714
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:45,501
并且不介意一点点
责任的回报。
and doesn't mind a little
responsibility in return.

715
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,573
我很失望，MJ。
I'm disappointed, MJ.

716
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,945
停止行事就像是这样
他妈的伟大的在你奶奶的。
Stop acting like it was so
fucking great at your grandma's.

717
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,585
(Crickets chirping)

718
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,056
为什么有些期待
比其他的大？
SHELL:
Why do some look bigger
than others?

719
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,091
我不知道。
MJ:
I don't know.

720
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,363
为什么有些亮？
Why are some brighter?

721
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,570
也许他们出生
这种方式。
Maybe they were born
that way.

722
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,339
为什么呢？
Why?

723
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,945
上帝希望它这样，
我猜。
God wanted it that way,
I guess.

724
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,283
我不认为如此。
I don't think so.

725
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,419
我觉得他们都
出生明亮，
I think they were all
born bright,

726
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:39,088
再经过一段时间，
and then after a while,

727
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,358
他们周围所有的东西，
灰尘之类的东西，
all the stuff around them,
dust and stuff,

728
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,993
覆盖起来。
covered them up.

729
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:46,395
所以你只要
无法看到它们。
So you just
can't see them.

730
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:49,632
但他们仍然光明
下面。
But they're still bright
underneath.

731
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:52,635
它仍然存在
如果你足够接近。
It's still there
if you look close enough.

732
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,476
这就是为什么你会
为医生
That's why you're going
to be the doctor

733
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,112
我要去
骑的马。
and I'm going
to ride horses.

734
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,104
(Indistinct chattering)

735
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,178
谁他妈的是什么？
MAN:
Who the fuck is that?

736
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,582
(Chain rattling)

737
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,020
你需要一份工作？
You need a job?

738
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,236
(Phone ringing)

739
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,573
喂？
Hello?

740
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,510
是啊，是啊。
没问题。
Yeah, yeah.
No problem.

741
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,247
好吧。
Okay.

742
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,651
我要走了
几天。
I have to leave
for a few days.

743
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,456
扎达，你可以采取
从这里缰绳？
Zada, you can take
the reins from here?

744
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,705
好吧，
给我一个吻。
All right,
give me a kiss.

745
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:38,007
我们可以去海边
当你回来？
Can we go to the beach
when you get back?

746
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:40,176
MJ真的想。
不，我没有。
MJ really wants to.
No, I don't.

747
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,579
是的，她喜欢。
Yes, she does.

748
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,015
当然可以。
Sure.

749
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:47,550
好吧，我会打电话给你的时候我回来。
好吧。
All right, I'll call you
when I get back.
Okay.

750
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:49,218
再见，女孩。
Bye, girls.

751
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,161
我已经去海滩。
MJ:
I'm already going to the beach.

752
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,030
怎么样？
SHELL:
How?

753
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,698
不用担心这个。
MJ:
Don't worry about it.

754
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,035
但你有漂亮的颜色。
WOMAN:
But you got nice colours.

755
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:07,470
我是那么白。
我知道了。
I'm so white.
I know.

756
00:50:07,472 --> 00:50:10,039
没有，但它的美丽。
这是很好的。
No, but it's beautiful.
It's nice.

757
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,679
(Squawking)

758
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,626
(Engine rumbling)

759
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,328
你一定是他妈的
跟我开玩笑。
You got to be fucking
kidding me.

760
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,330
发生了什么事？
他只是打了一个他妈的沙洲。
What happened?
He just hit a fucking sandbar.

761
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:37,700
嘿，我做不出来
进来这样，好吗？
Hey, I usually don't
come in this way, all right?

762
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,802
这是退潮
我们正在加载。
It's low tide
and we're loaded.

763
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,472
推推
Push! Push!

764
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,241
......三，推
...three, push!

765
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,810
(Grunting loudly)

766
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:50,513
他妈的...
Fuck...

767
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:52,281
哦我觉得很感动
一点。
Oh! I think it moved
a little.

768
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:53,449
(All straining)

769
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:55,151
哦
Oh!

770
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,560
(All groaning)

771
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,129
和一推
And a push!

772
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:08,297
推
Push!

773
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,734
(Gasping)

774
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,303
他妈的
Fuck!

775
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,139
来吧。
Come on.

776
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,609
他妈的它。笨蛋
Fuck it. Fucker!

777
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,178
他妈的
Fuck!

778
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,746
这太沉重，男人。
DUANE:
It's just too heavy, man.

779
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,648
告诉我的东西
我不知道他妈的，杜安
Tell me something
I don't fucking know, Duane!

780
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,183
推
CHRISTINA:
Push!

781
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,517
来吧
哦
Come on!
Oh!

782
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,219
(All squawking)

783
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,659
我们坐在鸭子。
We're sitting ducks.

784
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:38,461
我们只是等待潮
我们会没事的。
We just wait for the tide
and we'll be fine.

785
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:40,529
我们正在把它扔。
我们不是抛负载。
We're throwing it.
We are not throwing load.

786
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,264
电台老板人。
Radio the boss man.

787
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,167
他要我下去给他
而且也没有他妈的方式。
He wants me to go down for him
and there's no fucking way.

788
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:47,269
让我想起了一分钟。
有没有他妈的时间
Let me just think for a minute.
There's no fucking time

789
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,404
想想，男人
to think, man!

790
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:49,805
太阳升起来了
The sun is up!

791
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,340
警察将要
爬在我他妈的船
The cops are going to be
crawling on my fucking boat!

792
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,175
我不欠
老板人什么都没有。
I don't owe
the boss man nothing.

793
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:56,779
因此，抓住一个包，并得到了他妈的
在这里的轨道。
So grab a bale and get the fuck
over the rail here.

794
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,320
我没有触碰它。
I'm not touching it.

795
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:14,864
(Water splashing)

796
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,439
(Water splashing)

797
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,393
我们有一个问题。
We have a problem.

798
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:48,831
(Door opening and closing)

799
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,205
你知道吗，在研究
人类行为的
Did you know that the study
of human behaviour

800
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,807
刚开始用
动物的研究？
first began with
the study of animals?

801
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,913
达尔文发现
动物
Darwin discovered
that animals

802
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:06,348
行为的展览模式
根据生存
exhibit patterns of behaviour
based on survival

803
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,184
和自然选择。
and natural selection.

804
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,487
一旦你控制
变量，
And once you control
the variables,

805
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:15,391
这些行为也
可被限制，操纵。
those behaviours also
can be limited, manipulated.

806
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,597
从理论上讲，
In theory,

807
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,201
如果动物
是照顾，
if an animal
is taken care of,

808
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:27,503
培育，喂...
nurtured, fed...

809
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:32,808
它会表现出行为
可以预见的。
it will exhibit behaviour
that can be predicted.

810
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,348
但每隔一段时间
But every so often

811
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,784
一个随机的基因
进入混合
a random gene
enters the mix

812
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:44,620
并改变方向
该组。
and changes the direction
of the group.

813
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:47,823
它有
要被提取。
And it has
to be extracted.

814
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:51,293
整个牛群前
可重复的图案。
before the entire herd
can duplicate the pattern.

815
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:54,330
老大，我没扔的负荷。
我向上帝发誓。
Boss, I did not throw that load.
I swear to God.

816
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,335
你告诉我到底
发生了什么事。
You tell me exactly
what happened.

817
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:10,012
该规则的存在
是有原因的，克里斯蒂娜。
The rules exist
for a reason, Christina.

818
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,949
但我敢肯定你已经
理解这一点。
But I'm sure you already
understand that.

819
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:19,855
块钱一斤。
Dollar a pound.

820
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,891
您的剪裁，加上BK
和杜安的。
Your cut, plus BK
and Duane's.

821
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:25,527
他们不会
是需要他们的。
They won't
be needing theirs.

822
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,767
它支付更聪明
除了动物。
It pays to be more intelligent
than an animal.

823
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,913
特里？
CHRISTINA:
Terry?

824
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:21,550
我马上就出来。
TERRY:
I'll be right out.

825
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:24,520
...的影响
感觉所有的整个社区。
NEWSWOMAN, OVER TV:
...The impact felt all
throughout the community.

826
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,555
今晚，地区检察官
是说
Tonight, the district attorney
is saying

827
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:30,092
它周围的一切
一件事：毒品。
it was all surrounding
one thing: drugs.

828
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:32,628
妮可·雅可布新
信息。
Nicole Jacobs with new
information.

829
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:33,762
你有什么，妮可？
What do you have, Nicole?

830
