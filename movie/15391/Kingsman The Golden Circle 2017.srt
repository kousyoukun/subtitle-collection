1
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,303
Eggy.

2
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:30,207
You mind if I share your cab?

3
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:40,717
Charlie?

4
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,623
It's ironic, isn't it?

5
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:49,226
You look like a gentleman,
I look like a pleb.

6
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,397
If I was you,
I'd unlock your cab.

7
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:14,152
Pete, get us out of here!

8
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,408
You think that shit's
gonna work this time?

9
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,278
You're way out of your depth.

10
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,457
Fuck!

11
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,590
Take him out!

12
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,501
Merlin! We've got
a Code Purple.

13
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:52,569
My driver's down.

14
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,805
Permission to blow
these fuckers away.

15
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:55,939
Denied.

16
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:57,941
Cannot be contained.

17
00:05:57,975 --> 00:05:59,610
Head south,
I'm clearing the route.

18
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,489
Shit!

19
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,129
Merlin, I'm entering Hyde Park.

20
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,031
Can I get on with it?

21
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,501
Merlin!

22
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:00,436
Dark zone confirmed.
Permission to fire.

23
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,739
Oh, thank fuck for that!

24
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,256
No time to relax.
Police are right behind you.

25
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,593
You have 30 seconds before
they reach your position.

26
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:24,828
Go directly to Rendezvous Swan.

27
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,141
Merlin, you do realize
I haven't even got a windscreen right now?

28
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:39,614
I seem to remember
from your training

29
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:41,355
you were rather good
at holding your breath.

30
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,388
It wasn't a revenge mission.

31
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:23,614
Charlie could've just
killed you immediately.

32
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:25,449
Not boasting,
but I trained him well enough

33
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:26,883
that even he wouldn't
mess that up.

34
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,051
Merlin, I'm sorry,

35
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:29,495
we're gonna have to do
the debrief tomorrow.

36
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,831
I've got to get
to a dinner tonight...

37
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:31,898
and if I miss it, let's just say

38
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:33,233
Charlie might as well
have killed me.

39
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:34,124
Well, if you can't wait

40
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:35,301
for the police
to clear the park...

41
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,826
there's another way out
in the corner.

42
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:48,605
Fuck!

43
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,343
How important is that dinner?

44
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:58,281
Let me show you.

45
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,129
For fuck's sake!

46
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:50,467
Babe.

47
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,003
I'm home!

48
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:54,071
I'm here.

49
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:02,312
What the hell happened?

50
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:05,816
It's a long story
that deserves a kiss.

51
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,351
Not even JB
would kiss you right now.

52
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,922
If you really love me,
just one little kiss.

53
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,394
You were really gonna do it?

54
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,529
Yeah.

55
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:21,097
Now, that is
true love right there.

56
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,333
Amazing. I'm gonna
go get changed.

57
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,904
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

58
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:35,311
And Tilde made that
for you herself, bruv.

59
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:36,678
Mmm-hmm.

60
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:38,414
The royal baker's not available.

61
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:40,951
Oh, shut up, Brandon.

62
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,253
Especially if you
want some of this.

63
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,455
Oh! Wait. Is that that
Swedish stuff right there?

64
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:46,290
Yes.

65
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:47,733
No, no. I ain't drinkin'
none of that.

66
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,426
Last time here,
I was wrecked, man.

67
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,437
Yeah, but that's 'cause you
were a lightweight, Jamal.

68
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:55,699
No, no, babe, I'm good.
Not for me, thank you.

69
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,835
Oh, what?
What's going on, man?

70
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:58,903
I'm meeting her parents

71
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,302
for the first time
tomorrow night.

72
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,372
I wanna make a good
impression, so what?

73
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,742
Oh, yeah, Jamal,
are you free to dogsit JB

74
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:07,111
tomorrow night
while we're there?

75
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,513
Ah, sorry, bruv, I've got
to look after my nan tomorrow.

76
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:10,748
But Liam's free, though.

77
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:11,882
Oh, yeah?

78
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:14,050
I can't, mate.
I'm allergic to dogs.

79
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:14,985
Bullshit.

80
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:16,319
Dogshit, actually.

81
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,298
That leaves you, Brandon.
What you doing tomorrow night?

82
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,890
Yeah, I'll look after
your dog, mate,

83
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,492
but I got one condition.

84
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:23,627
What's that?

85
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,262
You have a drink with us.
Yeah.

86
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,497
Got to do it, babe.

87
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:27,663
Got to do it.

88
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,232
Brandon, happy birthday!

89
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,168
Happy birthday.

90
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:32,503
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

91
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:34,237
Shit.

92
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:40,043
My drugs are everywhere.

93
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,647
They were never my thing...

94
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:44,915
but here I am,

95
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:49,052
running the biggest
drug cartel in the world.

96
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:53,557
The only downside is having to
live in the middle of nowhere.

97
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,563
You know, these ruins
are technically undiscovered.

98
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:02,866
I just added a few touches
to remind me of home.

99
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:08,104
I grew up on all that
awesome 50s nostalgia.

100
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:11,575
Grease. American Graffiti.
Happy Days.

101
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:14,310
But I digress.

102
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,213
The thing you need to understand

103
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,314
is the hard work
and ingenuity...

104
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:21,684
it took to achieve
a global monopoly...

105
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,085
on the drug trade.

106
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,256
And that's all on me.
Not to toot my own horn...

107
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:28,791
I just think
it's really important

108
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,694
for new recruits
to understand...

109
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,630
the history
of The Golden Circle.

110
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,871
So. Lifelong friends, huh?

111
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,807
Charles, do you think
your buddy here

112
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,341
is worthy of joining us?

113
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:46,942
Ms. Poppy, I would
not have brought him

114
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:48,587
all the way to see you
if I didn't think so.

115
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:50,546
Excellent.
Well, you hungry?

116
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:51,748
Starving.

117
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:54,151
Wonderful! Right this way.

118
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:55,985
Make yourselves at home.

119
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:59,388
So, fellas...

120
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,259
I have a couple of things
that I wanna clarify.

121
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,529
You understand that
in The Golden Circle...

122
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:10,033
my authority is never
to be questioned, right?

123
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,835
And the importance
of following orders?

124
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:14,003
Do you understand that?

125
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:16,105
And the value of loyalty?

126
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,108
It's easy to nod, isn't it?

127
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:24,514
I don't like easy.
I like proof.

128
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,321
What's your name?
Angel, ma'am.

129
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,856
Angel, baby.

130
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,990
Hey.

131
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,293
Your old pal, Charles,
has messed up.

132
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:38,729
That's all I'm gonna tell you,

133
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:39,904
'cause that's all
you need to know.

134
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:41,432
So put him in the mincer, okay?

135
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,029
No, Miss Poppy!

136
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:06,449
Good job!

137
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:10,119
See my salon across the way?

138
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,459
Head there for your makeover.

139
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:28,504
Eggsy, I hope you're hungry.

140
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:34,244
Oh, babe, I was gonna
grab breakfast at work.

141
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:35,555
This looks lovely,
but I'm running late.

142
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,915
I just thought maybe
we could practice?

143
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:40,049
For tonight.

144
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,784
Practice?
Mm-hmm.

145
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:42,818
Eating?

146
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:46,023
You said you've never
eaten at a palace before.

147
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:49,826
And Pappa is sort of picky
about table manners.

148
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,895
Well, as it happens, babe,
I've got this shit on lock.

149
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,263
I know what every single one

150
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:56,232
of them knives and forks is for.

151
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,703
This is a butter knife.

152
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,047
It's the only one
you need to remember,

153
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:03,311
the rest of the cutlery is easy.

154
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:04,441
You start from the outside,

155
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:06,677
and you work your way in
with each course.

156
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,513
And never let anyone
describe you as "H.K.L.P."...

157
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:10,680
What's that?

158
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:12,315
"Holds knife like pen."

159
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:13,582
A habit erroneously believed

160
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,684
to be upper class
dining etiquette.

161
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,587
It is quite the opposite.

162
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,361
White wine, pudding wine,
red wine, water and pop.

163
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:26,262
Or whatever tipple
takes your fancy.

164
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,341
Am I supposed to wait
for everyone else

165
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:30,708
to be served
before I start eating?

166
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:32,445
Only if the dish
being served is cold.

167
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,572
Or if the Queen is present.
Otherwise tuck in.

168
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:38,474
Got to be honest...

169
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,877
never really thought
the royalty bit would be relevant.

170
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,180
Harry would've been chuffed.

171
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:46,850
Oh. I wish I could've met him.

172
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:54,825
You miss him too,
don't you, Mr. Pickle?

173
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,728
Mmm?

174
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:08,505
Mr. Pickle says, "Yeah."

175
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,974
Hey, no, no, sit down, I'm fine.

176
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,911
I'm fine. Have a good day.

177
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:15,745
Okay.

178
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:46,108
Ah, Galahad! You're late.

179
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:47,911
We were wondering if you'd had

180
00:18:47,944 --> 00:18:49,779
a second encounter with Charlie.

181
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:52,649
I wish. I'm looking forward
to finishing him off.

182
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:58,521
All right, gents.

183
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:01,257
Merlin, come in.

184
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:03,026
Galahad and Lancelot,

185
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,194
please remain
for Merlin's debrief.

186
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:08,798
Everyone else,
reconvene at 1900 hours.

187
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,268
So...

188
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,870
the man who attacked
Galahad in the taxi

189
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,440
was Charlie Hesketh.

190
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:18,540
Rejected Kingsman
applicant turned bad.

191
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:21,076
We last saw him back
at Richmond Valentine's HQ.

192
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:23,412
I've caught a fucking spy!

193
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:29,186
Like everyone else there...

194
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:31,321
Charlie had a security implant
in his neck.

195
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:34,290
A weakness we had no choice
but to exploit.

196
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:40,396
Hey, Merlin.
Still fucking spectacular, eh?

197
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,434
Come on, guys, loosen up.
We saved the world.

198
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:47,336
Yeah.

199
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,341
Unfortunately, Galahad,
you also saved Charlie.

200
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:54,344
When you electrocuted him,
you damaged his implant.

201
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:55,912
Instead of his head exploding...

202
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,414
he only lost an arm
and his vocal chords.

203
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:00,616
Fucker should be thanking me.

204
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,384
And now he's back for revenge?

205
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,120
We don't think so, sir.

206
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:05,263
We believe he's being recruited

207
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,689
by an unknown organization.

208
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:07,923
Lancelot?

209
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,358
Got the police autopsy reports

210
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:12,228
from Charlie's colleagues
in the SUVs.

211
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,730
They're not just goons for hire.

212
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,965
Fingerprints removed.

213
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:17,100
Teeth filed smooth.

214
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,670
I did a face recognition.
Nothing.

215
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:20,670
And that thing?

216
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:24,340
A cosmetic tattoo
made of 24-carat gold.

217
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,209
They all had them.

218
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:30,047
Seems like we're looking
at some kind of underworld organization.

219
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,619
Senora Poppy has sent me
for my makeover.

220
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,754
Follow me.

221
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,693
Please take your shirt off.

222
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:26,702
It's beautiful, isn't it?

223
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,473
Not that.

224
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:31,607
This.

225
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:34,643
♪ The sun is out
The sky is blue ♪

226
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:36,446
Bon appetit.

227
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:39,915

228
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:42,085

232
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,088
How is it?

233
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:20,123
It's delicious.

234
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,461
Welcome to Golden Circle.

235
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:28,731
♪ Raining in my heart ♪

236
00:22:37,338 --> 00:22:39,975
Mmm.

237
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:44,848
I think we should
do you the favor

238
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:47,150
of conversing in English, yes.

239
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:51,253
So, tell me...

240
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,488
what do you do?

241
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:55,090
I work for Kingsman,
the tailors, Your Highness.

242
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,327
You may address my daughter
as "Your Highness."

243
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:01,864
Please address the Queen and
myself with "Your Majesty."

244
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:04,266
Pappa, this is
a family dinner...

245
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,702
not some state function.

246
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:09,572
Well then, Eggsy.

247
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:11,941
What do you make
of the current situation

248
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,043
in the Indian financial markets?

249
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,679
Pappa!

250
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:17,647
Uh...

251
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,550
Well...

252
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:25,955
I don't think we can
underestimate the impact

253
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,723
of ECB's quantitative
easing measures.

254
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:29,868
And of course,
the liquidity wave

255
00:23:29,892 --> 00:23:31,559
from the US Federal
Reserve rate hike...

256
00:23:31,594 --> 00:23:33,063
getting pushed back.

257
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,105
Frida Kahlo.

258
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,244
Well, other than the 1939
acquisition by the Louvre...

259
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:49,578
she wasn't really acknowledged

260
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:51,314
until the new Mexicanisimo
art movement...

261
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,016
of the late 1970s.

262
00:23:57,953 --> 00:23:59,588
Moorish revival.

263
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:01,490
Ah. The Palazzo Sammezzano.

264
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:02,826
In Tuscany.

265
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:05,193
Beautiful.

266
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:07,730
Bluetooth technology.

267
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:09,397
Which, of course, got its name

268
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,200
from the legendary
Danish king...

269
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,867
Harald Blatand, whose name

270
00:24:12,902 --> 00:24:16,037
translates to
"Bluetooth" in English.

271
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:17,673
And the Bluetooth logo
is his initials

272
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,274
in Norse runic symbols.

273
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:21,376
And, as I'm sure you know...

274
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,779
the Bluetooth logo
is his initials...

275
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:25,582
in Norse runic symbols.

276
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:27,215
Oh, my God, Eggsy.

277
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,085
Why isn't he eating
his fucking pudding?

278
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:30,952
I need to research
this gold tattoo.

279
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:32,288
I found records of other people

280
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:33,790
with the same
body modifications.

281
00:24:35,524 --> 00:24:36,935
All of them have
high level involvement...

282
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:39,061
with crime and international
drug trafficking.

283
00:24:39,095 --> 00:24:42,163
And there's rumors of something
called The Golden Circle.

284
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:43,266
Hmm.

285
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,173
Best agent or best friend?

286
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:02,952
Come on, JB.
Give it a rest, mate.

287
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:06,189
Stop scratching the door.
I'm gonna get the blame now.

288
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:07,222
There you are. Happy?

289
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:24,039
With the decks and all that.

290
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,710
Shit, boy!

291
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,111
What the...

292
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:37,787
Do you reckon, JB...

293
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:40,090
model material?

294
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:46,061
I must say, you're really
not as I expected.

295
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:49,432
Well, thank you very much...

296
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,100
Your Majesty.

297
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,869
Eggsy?
Is that you, mate?

298
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:54,836
What the fuck is going on here?

299
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,239
You a gangster now or something?

300
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:58,840
Fuckin' hell. Is that Tilde's
mom and dad's house?

301
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:00,519
Tell you what. Whatever
you're doing, I want in.

302
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:03,946
Put it down!

303
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,882
Why?

304
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,518
I said, put it down now!

305
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,752
What's wrong with it?

306
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,254
Shut it! Fucking shut it!

307
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:13,922
Eggsy.
I beg your pardon?

308
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:15,725
Shut it! Shut it now!

309
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:18,193
All right, mate.
Chill your boots.

310
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:21,797
Eggsy, what...

311
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,932
Oh, no. Oh, my God, no.
I'm so sorry.

312
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,994
You shut up and all.
You got me in enough trouble.

313
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:56,432
The next order of business...

314
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:58,334
Agent Percival.

315
00:27:05,074 --> 00:27:06,142
Arthur.

316
00:27:09,746 --> 00:27:10,947
Oh, fuck.

317
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:18,387
Yep.

318
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:21,825
Kingsman is crumpets.

319
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:27,396
Like toast, but British.

320
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,097
And to say thank you...

321
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:31,701
I got you a present, Charlie.

322
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:36,772
My guys made you this.

323
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:43,479
Bigger, badder, better.
I call it...

324
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:46,048
ARMageddon.

325
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,202
Let's see if your game improves.

326
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,350
Ouch.

327
00:28:59,255 --> 00:29:01,056
Someone decides to wipe out

328
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:02,891
every Kingsman property...

329
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:05,294
every agent, and somehow...

330
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,096
conveniently,
you weren't at home.

331
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,899
I could say the same thing
about you.

332
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:12,300
What, you think I'd kill Roxy?

333
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,171
And my mate, Brandon,
and my fucking dog?

334
00:29:15,203 --> 00:29:16,205
No.

335
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:19,875
You think I would?

336
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:26,883
This thing...

337
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:30,184
hacked us.

338
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:32,588
Clearly, this arm can be
remotely controlled.

339
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,190
I'm only alive
because my address

340
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:37,426
wasn't on the database
with the agents.

341
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:39,595
Whoever Charlie's working with

342
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:44,366
doesn't think that mere
staff are missile-worthy.

343
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,801
This ain't funny.

344
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:48,938
Roxy is dead!

345
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,106
Everyone's dead! Gone!
Do you even care?

346
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,675
Pull yourself together.

347
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,143
Remember your training.

348
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:57,079
There's no time for emotion
in this scenario.

349
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:01,617
Now...

350
00:30:01,651 --> 00:30:03,818
as all surviving agents
are present,

351
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:06,221
we follow the doomsday protocol.

352
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,459
When that's done,
and only then...

353
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,863
you may shed a tear in private.

354
00:30:16,664 --> 00:30:18,634
Okay.

355
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,202
What's the doomsday protocol?

356
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:23,273
We go shopping.

357
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:40,989
We're from Kingsman.
We'd like to buy some wine.

358
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:44,026
And use tasting room
number three, please.

359
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:49,132
Not one of my predecessors

360
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:51,366
has ever been
in this situation before.

361
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:54,970
Thank God.

362
00:30:58,173 --> 00:30:59,174
A-ha.

363
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:03,945
Remember this?

364
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,248
Yeah, how could I forget?

365
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:17,592
Whatever's in that safe
is the answer to all our problems.

366
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,402
Huh.

367
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:35,044
Is that it?

368
00:31:35,076 --> 00:31:37,279
I suppose that must be
upper-class humor.

369
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,249
I don't get it.

370
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,321
Me neither. What the fuck
are we supposed to do now?

371
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,188
I think we should drink a toast

372
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,056
to our fallen comrades.

373
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:52,795
To Roxy.

374
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,062
Roxy.

375
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,201
Ooh.

376
00:32:02,238 --> 00:32:04,307
To Arthur.
Arthur.

377
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,211
Mmm.

378
00:32:09,243 --> 00:32:10,578
Should we do one for JB?

379
00:32:10,612 --> 00:32:11,781
I think we should.

380
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:27,462
I should have seen it coming.

381
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,864
Charlie, the taxi.

382
00:32:29,897 --> 00:32:31,232
It's all my fault.

383
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:35,071
No, that's bullshit, Merlin.
It ain't all your fault.

384
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:37,572
You're the best, bruv.

385
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:39,508
Honestly, without you...

386
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,743
I'd have lost it
a long time ago.

387
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,181
I think we should
drink to Scotland.

388
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,117
I think we've probably
had enough, to be honest.

389
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,420
You're probably right.

390
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:01,296
Merlin.
Aye?

391
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:03,598
I think we're going to Kentucky.

392
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,601
Fried Chicken?

393
00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:06,801
I love fried chicken.

394
00:33:06,836 --> 00:33:09,372
No, proper Kentucky. Look.

395
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,207
You know what else I love?

396
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,809
Country and western music.

397
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:17,179
♪ Country roads ♪

398
00:33:17,813 --> 00:33:19,816
♪ Take me home ♪

399
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:24,653
♪ To the place I belong ♪

400
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:46,175
Oh! Here's where we leave
the casks to age.

401
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,409
Unfortunately, we can't go in,

402
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,078
as it's a temperature-controlled
environment.

403
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,748
So let's move on to
our world class stud farm...

404
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,683
and meet three of
our Kentucky Derby winners.

405
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:00,823
Biometric security scanner
just to protect

406
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:03,090
a few old barrels of whiskey?

407
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,727
Pull the other one, love.

408
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:06,729
Got it.

409
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,571
Are you getting anything?

410
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:17,573
Not yet.

411
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,476
Fucking hell.

412
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:22,310
It's a shame it's not scotch.

413
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,147
Hang on.

414
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:27,549
According to this,
there's a huge

415
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:29,617
underground structure
right beneath us.

416
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,587
And if my calculations
are correct...

417
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:36,459
This...

418
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,627
is the way in.

419
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,964
Fucking hell, Merlin. Shit.

420
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,533
You know, my mama...

421
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:47,535
she always told me...

422
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:51,106
us southerners get our good
manners from the British.

423
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,243
I was thinkin',
ain't that a pity.

424
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:56,345
Y'all didn't keep nothing
for yourselves.

425
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:06,855
Y'all ain't never heard of
knocking before you enter?

426
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:09,124
Well, actually we had
an invitation. Didn't we?

427
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:10,292
Yeah.
Oh, did you now?

428
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:13,261
Yeah. It came in the
shape of a bottle.

429
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,162
We're from the Kingsman
tailor shop in London.

430
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,731
Maybe you've heard of us?

431
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:17,866
Oh, the Kingsman.

432
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:20,167
Yeah.
Huh.

433
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,580
That's where y'all got
them fine suits

434
00:35:21,604 --> 00:35:23,205
and them fancy
spectacles y'all got on?

435
00:35:23,238 --> 00:35:24,774
Exactly.
That's right.

436
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:27,142
Y'all look damn sharp.

437
00:35:27,174 --> 00:35:28,520
Let me see
if I got it right, here.

438
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,814
You want me to believe that
it's normal for a tailor...

439
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:35,151
to hack through an advanced
biometric security system...

440
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,720
with nothing but a little
bitty old watch on?

441
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:44,892
I can promise you...

442
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:46,028
that dog don't hunt.

443
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:47,705
So why don't you go on and get down
on your knees...

444
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,798
and tell me
who you really work for.

445
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:03,178
That's 1963 Statesman Reserve.

446
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:04,580
You just made it personal.

447
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:27,569
Who the fuck are you?

448
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,316
A bottle in a secret wall.

449
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,053
You really expect me
to take that seriously?

450
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,422
See, I think
your story's horse shit.

451
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,892
Y'all just trying to cover
for a failed rescue mission.

452
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:53,462
You here for the lepidopterist,
ain't you?

453
00:36:57,566 --> 00:37:00,002
Okay, so your
mystery bottle, huh?

454
00:37:02,705 --> 00:37:04,114
Look anything like that,
right there?

455
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,408
Yes. Same brand,
much older.

456
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:07,943
All right.

457
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:10,745
Let's see here.

458
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,315
You know why the measurement

459
00:37:13,348 --> 00:37:16,384
of alcohol content's
called "proof"?

460
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:17,786
Oh, fuck off!

461
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,654
Oh, for Pete's sake.

462
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:22,524
See, comes from back
in the old days...

463
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:25,094
when pirates wanted to test
the strength of their rum.

464
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:27,529
They used to pour a little bit out
on gunpowder.

465
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:33,401
That'll make you wanna slap
your mama right there, boy.

466
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:35,803
And if the gunpowder,

467
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,473
if it burnt when
they set it alight...

468
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,208
they considered it proof...

469
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,444
that their rum
was good and strong.

470
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:45,914
But see, I ain't got
no gunpowder on me, do I?

471
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,161
But I'm pretty sure
you boys'll make

472
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:51,018
just as impressive of a sound...

473
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,555
when I set your balls on fire.

474
00:37:56,825 --> 00:37:59,194
Or you could just tell me who the fuck
y'all really are...

475
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:00,371
and how the hell y'all found us.

476
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:01,830
Look, for the last time,

477
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,332
we have nothing to protect
but our honor.

478
00:38:04,366 --> 00:38:06,201
So you can take
your cheap horse piss

479
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:07,403
that you call whiskey...

480
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:08,980
which, by the way,
is spelled without an "e"...

481
00:38:09,004 --> 00:38:11,440
and is nothing compared
to a single malt scotch...

482
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:13,743
and you can go fuck yourself.

483
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:17,912
What about you?

484
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:19,080
Me?
Yeah.

485
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:21,616
No, I love
a Jack and Coke, bruv.

486
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:24,720
But I do agree with the part
where you go fuck yourself.

487
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:29,524
All right.

488
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:30,634
Y'all ain't got
nothing to protect

489
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:31,893
other than your honor.

490
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:35,131
Let's see what happens
when we change things up.

491
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,873
Fuck me.
Harry?

492
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,942
Y'all got three seconds
to tell me the truth.

493
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:48,076
Wait. No.

494
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:49,278
No!
Harry!

495
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,212
He can't hear you.
But I can, so talk.

496
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,347
No!
Get down, Harry!

497
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,216
Harry! Harry!
That's two.

498
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,518
Harry!
Harry!

499
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,120
Harry!
Three.

500
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,855
Stop!

501
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:02,424
Their story checked out.

502
00:39:02,457 --> 00:39:04,492
I opened our doomsday
scenario locker

503
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,428
and that umbrella was in it.

504
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:09,665
Kingsman.
It's got our logo on it.

505
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:12,166
I'm really sorry.

506
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,836
My apologies, boys.

507
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:16,971
I hope there ain't
no hard feelings.

508
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,039
I was just doin' my job.

509
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,374
Welcome to the Statesman,

510
00:39:20,408 --> 00:39:22,576
independent intelligence agency.

511
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:23,912
Just like y'all, I reckon.

512
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,113
But our founders went
into the booze business.

513
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:27,227
Thank the sweet Lord above.

514
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:29,116
This is Ginger Ale.

515
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:30,884
She's our strategy executive.

516
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:31,921
Hello.

517
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,789
I'm Agent Tequila.

518
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:36,759
This is the part
where you untie us.

519
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:41,630
Thank you.

520
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:49,004
Harry.

521
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,506
Hello.
Hello, mate.

522
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:56,946
Harry.

523
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:58,047
How do you do?

524
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,982
Have we met before?

525
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:05,419
Harry, it's okay. It's fine.
They know that we know you.

526
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:07,855
I think there must be
some mistake.

527
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:10,591
It's been such
a long time, Harry.

528
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,762
I need to get
my brogues resoled.

529
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:16,631
Yeah, and my oxfords
are done in as well.

530
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,968
Why are you telling me
about your shoes?

531
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:25,206
I'm a lepidopterist.

532
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,441
You're a what?

533
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:29,010
I study butterflies.

534
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:36,551
Well, you wanted to be before
you joined the army, but...

535
00:40:38,486 --> 00:40:39,955
Harry, look at me.

536
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:47,897
It's good to see you.

537
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,098
We'll be back soon.

538
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:53,167
So these fellas right here
are our doomsday protocol?

539
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,571
Turns out, our founder's
tailor was Kingsman.

540
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,384
What the fuck
have you done to him?

541
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:02,677
Nothing. Only tried
to help him.

542
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,011
He's got retrograde amnesia.

543
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:05,286
Now, we knew from his eyeglasses

544
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:06,346
that he was intelligence.

545
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,616
We just didn't know whose.

546
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,318
How did he get here?

547
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:14,723
What the hell?

548
00:41:14,756 --> 00:41:17,058
Tequila, I'm getting
a crazy spike...

549
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:19,727
of extreme low frequency waves
11 miles from here.

550
00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:21,721
I'm gonna need you to
escort me there immediately.

551
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:51,225
I need your alpha gel.

552
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:54,763
I'll go check the church.

553
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,446
We developed
our alpha gel technology

554
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:12,680
for our own agents...

555
00:42:12,714 --> 00:42:14,482
in the event of a head shot.

556
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:15,951
The gel protects the brain.

557
00:42:15,984 --> 00:42:18,587
Then, in the lab,
we use nanites...

558
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,323
micro-bots,
to repair tissue damage.

559
00:42:27,863 --> 00:42:29,464
There are side effects.

560
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:30,698
Partial amnesia...

561
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:32,734
regression to the younger self.

562
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:36,738
With no idea who he was,
there was nothing we could do.

563
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:40,140
But now you guys are here...

564
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:42,176
there's a good chance
we can bring him back.

565
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:11,573
You're late.

566
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:13,241
Why are you still wearing that?

567
00:43:13,274 --> 00:43:16,877
Until you get rid of
the perimeter landmines...

568
00:43:16,912 --> 00:43:19,314
I'll keep wearing the suit,
thank you very much.

569
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:20,449
Scaredy-cat.

570
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:21,783
Shut up and sit down.

571
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:23,151
Let's go!

572
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,390
Crocodile Rock, please.

573
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:32,127
Fuck you!

574
00:43:34,062 --> 00:43:37,766
Hey, hey, Elton, language.

575
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:41,036
Okay, as fabulous
as your catalogue is...

576
00:43:41,069 --> 00:43:43,605
I think I want to hear
some Gershwin.

577
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:47,042
I still can't believe...

578
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:49,578
you got away with
kidnapping Elton John.

579
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:52,446
I know! But with Valentine
abducting those celebrities...

580
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:55,383
it seemed silly not to take
advantage of the confusion.

581
00:43:56,984 --> 00:43:59,387
Shit. Has Elton
got the blue rash?

582
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:03,658
Lights.

583
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:07,562
Hey, Elton.

584
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:09,596
Have you been a bad boy again?

585
00:44:09,629 --> 00:44:10,665
Mmm-mmm.

586
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:13,167
You're lying.
Look at your hands.

587
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,038
What is it?

588
00:44:18,071 --> 00:44:21,008
It's proof that my plan
is gonna work.

589
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:25,279
It's also the first sign
of a slow and horrible death.

590
00:44:26,948 --> 00:44:29,218
Don't worry, I can fix it.

591
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,886
Tell me who you partied with.

592
00:44:34,656 --> 00:44:36,225
It was Angel.

593
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:40,827
Huh, not very angelic.

594
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:42,497
Gonna have to clip his wings.

595
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,035
Close the door behind you.

596
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:31,912
At what point are you
going to start behaving

597
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:33,814
like a Statesman, Tequila?

598
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:36,384
You wanna go back
to being a rodeo clown?

599
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,352
No, sir. I apologize, sir.

600
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:42,424
I'm Champagne.

601
00:45:42,457 --> 00:45:44,926
But anyone who knows
what's good for him...

602
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:47,962
calls me Champ.

603
00:45:48,763 --> 00:45:50,364
Sorry for your troubles.

604
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:52,966
As your American cousins...

605
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,207
I'm placing all of Statesman's considerably
larger resources at your disposal.

606
00:46:00,808 --> 00:46:03,477
Can you imagine us
in the clothing business?

607
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:09,150
Now, how can I help you?

608
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,086
First of all,
I've got to thank you

609
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:12,687
for saving Agent Galahad.

610
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,888
Wait.

611
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:15,789
You said that you were Galahad.

612
00:46:15,823 --> 00:46:18,125
Oh, no, he's talking
about the butterfly guy.

613
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,828
That used to be his handle.
Oh.

614
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:20,995
Galahad always said,

615
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:22,239
"You've got to look at
the bigger picture..."

616
00:46:22,263 --> 00:46:24,297
"ask 'why' as well as 'who'."

617
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:26,334
So if someone wanted
to take out Kingsman...

618
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:28,536
then they've got to be
planning something major.

619
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:29,836
So what do you know?

620
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,238
They're a drug cartel, we think.

621
00:46:31,272 --> 00:46:33,642
The name Golden Circle
keeps coming up.

622
00:46:33,674 --> 00:46:36,109
Mmm. We'll look
into them. What else?

623
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:38,712
One of our former trainees
is working with them.

624
00:46:38,747 --> 00:46:41,348
Charlie Hesketh.
Total prick.

625
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,651
You got any promising
leads on him?

626
00:46:43,685 --> 00:46:44,819
His ex-girlfriend.

627
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:47,821
I've been tracking her
through social media.

628
00:46:47,854 --> 00:46:51,225
We believe she's still
in contact with him.

629
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:54,996
And she's going
to Glastonbury Music Festival.

630
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,098
Oh, good.

631
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:00,468
Agent Tequila,
break out your dancing shoes.

632
00:47:00,502 --> 00:47:01,736
You have a new mission.

633
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,071
Yes, sir.

634
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,040
Hold up.

635
00:47:07,442 --> 00:47:08,409
You feeling okay?

636
00:47:08,442 --> 00:47:11,446
I'm a little tired,
but fine, thanks.

637
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:12,613
Galahad, you ready?

638
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:13,748
Your face...

639
00:47:13,781 --> 00:47:15,150
You got...

640
00:47:17,886 --> 00:47:19,921
What the fuck?

641
00:47:19,953 --> 00:47:21,589
Oh, shit.

642
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:23,990
Head to the sick bay.

643
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:26,528
Have Ginger check you out.

644
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,463
Hey, give him your glasses.

645
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:36,104
You're in luck, kid.
Put 'em on.

646
00:47:37,171 --> 00:47:39,005
You get our finest senior agent

647
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,975
to join you instead.

648
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:43,577
Right now,
he's in our New York office.

649
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,214
Galahad, meet Agent Whiskey.

650
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:50,151
Kid...

651
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:53,755
looks like we're hookin' up
with a chick at a rock concert.

652
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,857
My favorite kind of mission.

653
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,326
I'm sending my jet
to pick you up.

654
00:48:09,337 --> 00:48:12,341
We've dealt with
this kind of amnesia before.

655
00:48:12,374 --> 00:48:16,011
Harry's like a computer
that needs to be rebooted.

656
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:21,116
We need to recreate a shock
or trauma from his past...

657
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:22,517
to trigger his memory.

658
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:25,386
I hope you're right.

659
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,364
Uh, excuse me.

660
00:48:36,397 --> 00:48:39,100
There seems to be
some sort of a problem here.

661
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:41,770
Help! Somebody!

662
00:48:41,803 --> 00:48:45,107
What the hell is
going on? Help me!

663
00:48:47,942 --> 00:48:49,177
Help!

664
00:48:50,877 --> 00:48:52,013
Oh, God!

665
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:54,316
Stop! Fuck!

666
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:16,638
Get him out now.

667
00:49:16,671 --> 00:49:18,607
No, no, wait. His instincts
are gonna kick in.

668
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:32,421
No. I'm sorry to do this.

669
00:49:53,374 --> 00:49:55,609
Are you okay?
What happened?

670
00:49:55,642 --> 00:49:58,211
Harry, you've forgotten
who you are.

671
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,648
We thought this might
jog your memory.

672
00:50:01,683 --> 00:50:04,752
Look, when you were young,
you had a choice.

673
00:50:04,785 --> 00:50:07,521
To either be a lepidopterist
or to join the army.

674
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:10,357
You chose the army.
That led to Kingsman.

675
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,360
You became a Kingsman agent.

676
00:50:13,395 --> 00:50:14,829
I doubt whether
I'd work for anyone

677
00:50:14,863 --> 00:50:15,943
who drowns their employees.

678
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,232
I want to go home.

679
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,867
I want my butterfly collection.

680
00:50:21,169 --> 00:50:22,703
I want to see Mother.

681
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:26,374
There's nothing more we can do.

682
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,343
It's time to let him go.

683
00:50:39,053 --> 00:50:40,531
Babe, I wish
I could stay longer,

684
00:50:40,555 --> 00:50:42,190
but I've got to go on
with this mission.

685
00:50:42,223 --> 00:50:45,326
Wait, wait, wait.

686
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,863
Before you go,
I wanna show you something.

687
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:51,199
Aw!

688
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:53,768
I know he could
never replace JB...

689
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,203
but...

690
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:59,339
Oh, my days.

691
00:50:59,374 --> 00:51:01,609
I hoped he might make you happy.

692
00:51:04,578 --> 00:51:07,214
And give you another reason
to come back home soon.

693
00:51:07,948 --> 00:51:09,282
I love him.

694
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,419
But I don't need another
reason to come home.

695
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:22,230
I apologize.
Just waiting for my friend.

696
00:51:22,263 --> 00:51:24,165
I'll be back as soon
as I can, I promise.

697
00:51:25,899 --> 00:51:28,001
Got to go save the world?
Yep.

698
00:51:28,035 --> 00:51:29,837
Well, if you save the world...

699
00:51:31,038 --> 00:51:32,807
you know what that means.

700
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:34,476
Yeah, all right.

701
00:51:37,745 --> 00:51:38,747
Bye, buddy.

702
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:46,687
Got the passes from my contact.

703
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,524
You're gonna love Glastonbury.

704
00:51:50,457 --> 00:51:52,459
Well, that's the easy part, kid.

705
00:51:52,493 --> 00:51:54,596
Take a look in the glove box.

706
00:51:58,966 --> 00:52:00,334
Fucking hell, bruv.

707
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,803
Thought everything
was supposed to be bigger in America.

708
00:52:02,837 --> 00:52:05,239
Is this why you overcompensate
with these massive cars?

709
00:52:05,272 --> 00:52:07,040
Goes on your finger.

710
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:08,451
The surveillance tracker
is in the tip.

711
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:11,845
Apply light pressure for three
seconds to release it.

712
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:20,287
Okay, so according
to her Instagram feed...

713
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:23,290
Charlie's ex-girlfriend
is up ahead at the VIP bar.

714
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:25,158
Which one of us is gonna
plant the tracker?

715
00:52:25,192 --> 00:52:26,528
Bands, boys.

716
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:29,297
Yeah, that's fine.

717
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,033
I say we both
make an approach...

718
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,968
whoever gets on best,
goes for it.

719
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:35,612
Well, it doesn't have
to be a competition, bruv.

720
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:37,005
Why don't we just
go up to her...

721
00:52:37,038 --> 00:52:38,315
shake her hand,
pat her on the back,

722
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:40,475
whatever, you know.
Job done.

723
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:43,678
The hand is not
a mucous membrane, Eggsy.

724
00:52:43,712 --> 00:52:45,646
Neither is the back.

725
00:52:45,678 --> 00:52:47,480
They teach you anything
at Kingsman?

726
00:52:47,515 --> 00:52:48,950
What are you talking about?

727
00:52:48,982 --> 00:52:51,685
Our trackers are designed
to enter the bloodstream.

728
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:55,055
They circulate harmlessly,
providing full audio and GPS.

729
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,257
Mucus membrane.

730
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,959
That's like up the nose,
isn't it?

731
00:52:57,991 --> 00:52:59,928
What the fuck am I gonna do?
Stick my finger...

732
00:53:03,797 --> 00:53:06,000
It's not just inside
the nose, is it?

733
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:09,037
No, Eggsy, it ain't.
Fuck.

734
00:53:09,069 --> 00:53:10,904
All right,
I'll take the first crack.

735
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,640
Watch and learn, buddy.

736
00:53:15,308 --> 00:53:16,711
Good luck.

737
00:53:22,517 --> 00:53:24,417
Here you go, ma'am.
Thank you.

738
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,586
Miss, I beg your pardon.

739
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,888
Now, I don't wanna pester you...

740
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:29,921
but I just have to know,
what time are you playing?

741
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,593
I'm not in a band.

742
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:34,094
Oh, God.
Who did you think I was?

743
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,528
Please don't say
someone ghastly.

744
00:53:35,562 --> 00:53:38,232
God damn it,
now I feel like a fool.

745
00:53:38,265 --> 00:53:42,636
I just assumed that a woman
with your charisma...

746
00:53:42,669 --> 00:53:44,805
well, she just had
to be somebody.

747
00:53:44,839 --> 00:53:45,974
Right.

748
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,575
Thank you.

749
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:49,109
No, it's okay.
I know you didn't mean

750
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,410
to make me feel
like a dumb-ass.

751
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:51,684
So I'll let you make it up to me

752
00:53:51,712 --> 00:53:53,547
by letting me buy you a drink.

753
00:53:54,214 --> 00:53:55,549
Follow my finger.

754
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:02,088
What are we doing?

755
00:54:02,122 --> 00:54:04,157
Swiping to the left.

756
00:54:04,191 --> 00:54:06,294
What, you don't do
Tinder in America?

757
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,662
Tinder what?

758
00:54:07,694 --> 00:54:10,698
Do you know, I think it's
probably a generational thing.

759
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:13,701
It translates as
"Go away, old man."

760
00:54:17,104 --> 00:54:18,339
Be good, be cool.

761
00:54:18,772 --> 00:54:19,841
Bye.

762
00:54:21,274 --> 00:54:23,110
Thank you for that.

763
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:25,279
I'm Clara.
River.

764
00:54:25,312 --> 00:54:28,281
Bloody hell, is that the time?

765
00:54:28,314 --> 00:54:29,426
You know what, I'm so jetlagged

766
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,384
I don't know
if I'm coming or going.

767
00:54:31,419 --> 00:54:32,987
Where've you been?
Anywhere nice?

768
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,290
South America. Been spending
a bit of time out there.

769
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:37,558
Training with the shaman,

770
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:39,827
and trying to really connect
with my spirit animal.

771
00:54:39,861 --> 00:54:41,996
Yeah.
I'm a crow.

772
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,732
And, hang on, let me guess...

773
00:54:43,765 --> 00:54:45,366
No.
Jaguar.

774
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:47,502
What? No! Oh, my God!

775
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:49,604
Yes?
How did you even know that?

776
00:54:49,636 --> 00:54:52,305
Look, it totally is.
Check it out.

777
00:54:52,339 --> 00:54:54,941
Oh. Ino Moxo.
Black jaguar. Very nice.

778
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:58,145
You know what?
I wanna buy you a drink.

779
00:55:06,854 --> 00:55:08,790
Eggsy sent this
from Glastonbury.

780
00:55:10,823 --> 00:55:14,395
And #bluerash is
trending on Twitter.

781
00:55:14,428 --> 00:55:16,730
Have you found any correlation
between these cases?

782
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:18,865
Only recreational drug use.

783
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:19,933
Ah.

784
00:55:21,236 --> 00:55:23,171
I know.
Not very Statesman-like.

785
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,605
Tequila here...

786
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,842
he is our resident bad boy.

787
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:30,343
You don't think
this could be related

788
00:55:30,377 --> 00:55:32,546
to The Golden Circle, do you?

789
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:36,482
A drug cartel
poisoning its customers?

790
00:55:36,517 --> 00:55:37,819
Doesn't make sense.

791
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:39,520
Mmm.

792
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,895
Poppy, would you
pass the sugar, please?

793
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,096
Okay.

794
00:55:49,129 --> 00:55:52,834
But it's really bad for you.

795
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:55,903
Eight times more addictive
than cocaine.

796
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:58,573
Five times more likely
to cause death.

797
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,241
But it's legal...

798
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,576
so, you go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

799
00:56:03,877 --> 00:56:07,013
Don't get me started
on tobacco and alcohol.

800
00:56:07,047 --> 00:56:09,450
Peddle that stuff
and you're in Fortune 500.

801
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:11,118
But me? No!

802
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:12,553
I'm out here hiding

803
00:56:12,587 --> 00:56:15,256
in the middle of
nowhere. Homesick.

804
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,656
Because I sell drugs.

805
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:20,193
Oh, Pops. You're doing this
because you're homesick?

806
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:21,929
Yes.

807
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,231
I want freedom.

808
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:26,167
I want fame.

809
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,569
Our profits were
250 billion dollars last year.

810
00:56:29,604 --> 00:56:31,080
I am the most successful
businesswoman

811
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:33,240
in the world,
but nobody knows who I am.

812
00:56:33,274 --> 00:56:34,409
Pops, Pops.

813
00:56:34,442 --> 00:56:36,377
It's not long now, eh?

814
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,345
You're right, thank you.

815
00:56:38,377 --> 00:56:39,747
Sorry to interrupt you.

816
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:42,415
You wanted to see me,
Madam Poppy?

817
00:56:42,448 --> 00:56:45,485
Yes, Angel.
In The Golden Circle...

818
00:56:45,518 --> 00:56:47,687
we do not sample
the merchandise...

819
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:50,725
and we do not break the rules.

820
00:56:50,758 --> 00:56:53,493
Which is why I have
invested in robots...

821
00:56:53,528 --> 00:56:55,863
because they are
so much more reliable

822
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:58,198
and trustworthy
than human beings.

823
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:07,642
Oh!

824
00:57:28,062 --> 00:57:29,797
Oh! Oh, no. Whoa! Whoa!

825
00:57:46,779 --> 00:57:49,149
Sorry we never
found your friends.

826
00:57:49,183 --> 00:57:51,385
Well, we all go on
our separate journeys...

827
00:57:51,419 --> 00:57:53,054
but, ultimately,
we'll all arrive

828
00:57:53,087 --> 00:57:54,655
at the same destination.

829
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:57,723
Shall we check my tent?
See if they're there?

830
00:57:57,758 --> 00:58:00,028
Uh... Yeah.
Oh, come on.

831
00:58:05,098 --> 00:58:06,600
Wow.

832
00:58:06,633 --> 00:58:08,268
This is amazing.

833
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,338
Come on.

834
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:14,408
Uh, you know what, I'm busting
for a pee actually.

835
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:16,143
You could do it on me
if you want.

836
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:18,046
Uh...

837
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:20,047
Maybe in a bit.

838
00:58:20,781 --> 00:58:22,448
Give me a sec, yeah?

839
00:58:22,482 --> 00:58:24,986
Okay, but hurry up, River.

840
00:58:25,018 --> 00:58:27,988
Been waiting all night for you
to at least kiss me.

841
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:35,830
Hey!

842
00:58:35,863 --> 00:58:38,832
Hi, babe.
Uh, bit of a nightmare.

843
00:58:38,866 --> 00:58:40,201
I've got to sleep
with a target...

844
00:58:40,234 --> 00:58:42,936
but I won't do it, unless
you agree that it's all right.

845
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,506
You've got
to be fucking kidding.

846
00:58:45,538 --> 00:58:47,341
What was I, target practice?

847
00:58:47,374 --> 00:58:49,877
Babe, surely it's better that
I'm honest with you...

848
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,621
rather than me doing it
and not telling you.

849
00:58:51,645 --> 00:58:54,480
Kind of got a bit of
a "save the world" situation here.

850
00:58:54,515 --> 00:58:56,384
How the fuck is screwing someone

851
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:58,018
gonna save the world?

852
00:58:58,051 --> 00:58:59,953
Well, it's a bit complicated...

853
00:58:59,986 --> 00:59:02,923
but trust me, I would not be
doing it if I didn't have to.

854
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,495
Babe, please believe me.
I love you.

855
00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:09,739
You are the person I wanna spend

856
00:59:09,763 --> 00:59:11,031
the rest of my life with.

857
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,334
Is that a proposal?

858
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:17,571
Um...

859
00:59:17,604 --> 00:59:19,439
Because I think I'd give you
my permission.

860
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:23,277
Having that security, knowing
that we were committed...

861
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:26,279
In that context, yeah.
Yeah, I'd feel different.

862
00:59:27,348 --> 00:59:29,317
Right. Well, I mean...

863
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,484
I want to be with you,

864
00:59:30,517 --> 00:59:32,118
but being
a public figure, babe...

865
00:59:32,153 --> 00:59:33,388
like a prince...

866
00:59:34,388 --> 00:59:35,565
It's a bit of a factor,
you know,

867
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:36,891
what with my job and stuff.

868
00:59:38,524 --> 00:59:40,694
Oh, no, no, no, come on. Okay.

869
00:59:40,727 --> 00:59:42,762
Uh, look, we need to talk
about this properly.

870
00:59:42,796 --> 00:59:44,898
Just give me five minutes, okay?

871
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:48,502
Don't put yourself down, Eggsy.

872
00:59:48,535 --> 00:59:50,771
I'm sure you can last
longer than that.

873
01:00:16,997 --> 01:00:19,667
What's the matter?
Nothing.

874
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,100
I just feel that
our spirit animals

875
01:00:21,134 --> 01:00:22,803
need more time to get in sync...

876
01:00:22,837 --> 01:00:26,206
and find a harmonious bond
on the spiritual plane.

877
01:00:26,238 --> 01:00:27,441
Totally.

878
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:28,841
Yeah?

879
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,379
Or we could just...

880
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:33,948
fuck?

881
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,022
Clara, I don't think I can.

882
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:52,765
But you know what?

883
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,268
My crow is looking
for a place to nest.

884
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:40,446
Good work, Eggsy!

885
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,848
Tracker fully functional.

886
01:01:44,051 --> 01:01:46,921
Don't worry, I've been
through this with Whiskey before.

887
01:01:47,921 --> 01:01:49,322
Nice to be working with an agent

888
01:01:49,357 --> 01:01:51,091
who knows what he's doing.

889
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:55,696
Wow, Mr. Crow. My turn.

890
01:01:55,729 --> 01:01:57,597
I'm sorry. I can't.

891
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,899
I'm in a relationship.

892
01:01:58,933 --> 01:02:01,302
That's adorable.
Listen, so am I.

893
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:05,071
What happens at Glasto,
stays in Glasto.

894
01:02:05,671 --> 01:02:06,907
I can't.

895
01:02:07,374 --> 01:02:08,442
Bye, Clara.

896
01:02:13,913 --> 01:02:15,114
This is Princess T,

897
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:16,450
please leave a message.

898
01:02:18,685 --> 01:02:19,996
Motor Manor Hotel...

899
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,221
Yeah, can you put me through
to Princess Tilde, please.

900
01:02:22,256 --> 01:02:24,958
Oh, actually, sir, I'm just
looking at my computer...

901
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,526
and I'm afraid that the princess

902
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,728
is already checked out.

903
01:02:27,761 --> 01:02:28,963
Thank you.

904
01:02:31,598 --> 01:02:32,600
Fuck!

905
01:02:59,759 --> 01:03:00,962
Harry.

906
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,298
What's going on?
I was just packing.

907
01:03:05,332 --> 01:03:06,532
Look at these lovely toiletries

908
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:08,835
Merlin very kindly gave me
as a leaving present.

909
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,104
Here, try this aftershave.

910
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,973
Yeah, I know, Harry.
I'm wearing it.

911
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,245
Listen, you can't just give up.

912
01:03:18,444 --> 01:03:19,613
Give up?

913
01:03:19,647 --> 01:03:22,750
No, on the contrary.
I'm about to achieve my dream.

914
01:03:22,783 --> 01:03:24,017
Researching rare butterflies

915
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:26,487
alongside some of the finest
minds in entomology.

916
01:03:36,196 --> 01:03:39,834
You know, you may as well
have me stuck up on this wall.

917
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:43,470
'Cause you're never gonna find a butterfly
more interesting than me.

918
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:44,604
Sorry?

919
01:03:44,638 --> 01:03:49,109
When you and I first met,
I was just, like, a maggot.

920
01:03:49,142 --> 01:03:50,511
Maggots turn into flies.

921
01:03:50,544 --> 01:03:52,112
Perhaps you mean larva.

922
01:03:52,145 --> 01:03:54,080
Larva, yeah, okay.
Whatever. The point is...

923
01:03:54,113 --> 01:03:56,182
everyone wanted to squash me.

924
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:58,785
But not you.

925
01:03:58,819 --> 01:04:01,889
You helped me
to become a caterpillar.

926
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:03,523
And now I've got wings.

927
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:06,526
I'm flying higher
than I ever dreamed.

928
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,362
And that is all thanks to you.

929
01:04:08,395 --> 01:04:10,430
I hate to seem rude,
but I need to finish packing

930
01:04:10,464 --> 01:04:11,632
and get some sleep.

931
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:13,066
Harry, you can't just walk away.

932
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,668
Kingsman needs you.

933
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:17,004
The whole world needs you.

934
01:04:19,805 --> 01:04:21,374
I need you.

935
01:04:22,243 --> 01:04:24,478
Eggy, whoever the Harry was

936
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:27,014
that you knew,
he's gone, I'm afraid.

937
01:04:27,379 --> 01:04:28,448
Goodbye.

938
01:05:07,587 --> 01:05:08,888
That's not a martini.

939
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:10,857
It is in Kentucky.

940
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:12,093
Fair enough.

941
01:05:20,399 --> 01:05:21,836
Here's to you, Eggsy.

942
01:05:21,868 --> 01:05:24,238
You're exactly
what Kingsman needs.

943
01:05:34,915 --> 01:05:36,149
This is Princess T.

944
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:37,618
Please leave a message.

945
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,956
Can I have
another martini, please?

946
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:44,392
Sure.

947
01:05:45,392 --> 01:05:46,460
Thanks.

948
01:06:00,473 --> 01:06:01,575
Give up.

949
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:37,977
You know what?

950
01:06:38,011 --> 01:06:40,314
That was the best martini
I've ever had.

951
01:06:41,448 --> 01:06:42,816
Keep the change.

952
01:06:42,848 --> 01:06:44,117
Thanks.

953
01:06:58,631 --> 01:06:59,909
It's all right.
Don't panic.

954
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,670
Just thought I'd bring you
a little leaving present.

955
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:09,652
What do you think?
He's lovely, isn't he?

956
01:07:10,877 --> 01:07:12,412
Would you like to hold him?

957
01:07:15,482 --> 01:07:16,650
Hello.

958
01:07:25,558 --> 01:07:27,794
Do you think I should shoot him?

959
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:30,297
Are you quite mad?
What? What's the problem?

960
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:32,432
No! You can't!
Eh? What?

961
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:34,668
No, you'll have to shoot me!
Shoot you?

962
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:35,601
Well, I will shoot you.

963
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,112
No. No one's sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

964
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,181
Well, what about you, Harry?

965
01:07:38,205 --> 01:07:39,616
You were sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

966
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,741
Do you remember?

967
01:08:03,263 --> 01:08:05,198
You were sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

968
01:08:33,092 --> 01:08:35,028
It was a blank.
Yes, Harry. Yes!

969
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:36,129
It was a fucking blank!

970
01:08:36,162 --> 01:08:37,206
That's right. It was a blank!

971
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:38,499
I would never hurt Mr. Pickle!

972
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,366
Yes, Harry!
He lived to a ripe old age!

973
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,869
He died of pancreatitis!

974
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,743
You're not Mr. Pickle.

975
01:08:56,949 --> 01:08:57,951
Eggsy.

976
01:08:59,919 --> 01:09:01,387
Hello, Harry.

977
01:09:13,866 --> 01:09:15,401
Eggsy.

978
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,141
Valentine has to be stopped.
No, I know.

979
01:09:22,176 --> 01:09:23,385
He has a device.
It's all right.

980
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,278
It's sorted. Don't worry.

981
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:27,314
We got a lot of
catching up to do.

982
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,283
Well, well.

983
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:32,552
I suppose I should
cancel that taxi.

984
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:34,688
Yes.

985
01:09:34,722 --> 01:09:35,990
If you don't mind...

986
01:09:37,723 --> 01:09:38,926
Merlin.

987
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:42,829
Welcome back...

988
01:09:42,863 --> 01:09:43,963
Galahad.

989
01:09:48,701 --> 01:09:50,645
Now that we've finished
the debrief, Harry...

990
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:52,538
here's a couple of
welcome back gifts.

991
01:09:52,573 --> 01:09:54,208
First up...

992
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,208
a brand-new Kingsman watch.

993
01:09:56,241 --> 01:09:57,377
Advanced software,

994
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:59,479
it can hack into anything
with a microchip.

995
01:09:59,512 --> 01:10:00,879
It is the bollocks.

996
01:10:00,914 --> 01:10:02,382
And Merlin...

997
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:03,616
I made you these.

998
01:10:07,052 --> 01:10:08,354
A-ha.

999
01:10:26,506 --> 01:10:29,075
Thank you, Merlin, Eggsy.

1000
01:10:29,109 --> 01:10:31,211
How do I look?
You look...

1001
01:10:31,244 --> 01:10:35,048
Like some faggot lookin' for
an eye fuckin'.

1002
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:38,083
Now...

1003
01:10:38,118 --> 01:10:41,321
why don't you
get out of our bar...

1004
01:10:41,354 --> 01:10:44,258
before I take out
your other one?

1005
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:46,159
Now, is that any way
to welcome a visitor

1006
01:10:46,191 --> 01:10:48,028
from out of town, moonshine?

1007
01:10:48,061 --> 01:10:49,463
Okay.

1008
01:10:50,629 --> 01:10:53,266
Suck my southern dick...

1009
01:10:53,299 --> 01:10:55,134
bitch.

1010
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,604
Oh, I don't think
that'll be necessary.

1011
01:10:58,872 --> 01:11:00,406
Good day, sir.

1012
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,178
Well?

1013
01:11:06,213 --> 01:11:08,048
What are you ladies waitin' for?

1014
01:11:08,615 --> 01:11:09,917
Manners...

1015
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:12,752
maketh...

1016
01:11:15,289 --> 01:11:16,690
man.

1017
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:19,959
Do you know what that means?

1018
01:11:22,162 --> 01:11:24,097
Then let me teach you a lesson.

1019
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:36,441
Are we going to stand
around here all day?

1020
01:11:36,476 --> 01:11:37,877
Or are we going to...

1021
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:41,448
You big...

1022
01:11:59,531 --> 01:12:01,467
Well, pick him up.

1023
01:12:01,502 --> 01:12:04,972
Now, that is not what I call
a Kentucky welcome.

1024
01:12:07,007 --> 01:12:11,143
Manners maketh man.

1025
01:12:11,177 --> 01:12:12,579
Let me translate that for you.

1026
01:12:32,397 --> 01:12:33,566
What's wrong with me, Merlin?

1027
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,734
I thought you fixed me?

1028
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,037
Well, we rebuilt
your neural pathways.

1029
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:39,372
But it'll take time to get
your coordination back.

1030
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,794
And the phantom butterflies?

1031
01:13:01,828 --> 01:13:03,562
You will experience episodes...

1032
01:13:03,596 --> 01:13:04,830
lapses of clarity.

1033
01:13:04,864 --> 01:13:06,933
You'll be back to normal soon.

1034
01:13:22,048 --> 01:13:24,051
Whoo.

1035
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:26,586
I feel like a tornado
in a trailer park.

1036
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:31,524
♪ Golden Circle proudly presents ♪

1037
01:13:31,556 --> 01:13:34,526
Mr. President,
my name is Poppy Adams.

1038
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,763
I believe the UN has no teeth.

1039
01:13:37,798 --> 01:13:39,608
So I've selected you,
as leader of the free world,

1040
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:41,500
to receive this communication.

1041
01:13:41,534 --> 01:13:43,202
And I invite you
to begin negotiations...

1042
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:47,272
on the largest scale
hostage situation in history.

1043
01:13:47,306 --> 01:13:48,507
A few weeks ago,

1044
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,343
an engineered virus
was released...

1045
01:13:50,377 --> 01:13:53,178
contained in all
varieties of my product.

1046
01:13:53,213 --> 01:13:57,683
Cannabis, cocaine, heroin,
opium, ecstasy...

1047
01:13:57,717 --> 01:13:59,119
...and crystal meth.

1048
01:14:00,387 --> 01:14:03,023
Some of you
are already infected.

1049
01:14:03,056 --> 01:14:05,092
And this is what you can expect

1050
01:14:05,124 --> 01:14:07,025
in the coming days.

1051
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:10,062
After a brief
incubation period...

1052
01:14:10,096 --> 01:14:12,065
victims present
with stage one symptoms.

1053
01:14:13,432 --> 01:14:14,634
A blue rash.

1054
01:14:15,567 --> 01:14:16,668
Next...

1055
01:14:16,701 --> 01:14:18,704
second stage symptoms appear.

1056
01:14:18,738 --> 01:14:20,507
Mania...

1057
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,174
as the virus enters the brain.

1058
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,544
Very distressing to the victim

1059
01:14:24,576 --> 01:14:26,312
and those around them.

1060
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,781
Stage three...

1061
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:31,183
Paralysis.

1062
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:34,087
Muscles enter a state
of catastrophic seizure.

1063
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,989
And once the muscles of
the thorax become affected...

1064
01:14:37,024 --> 01:14:39,593
breathing becomes impossible...

1065
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:43,963
leading to a very nasty death
within 12 hours.

1066
01:14:45,766 --> 01:14:50,970
But I have good news to
the millions already affected.

1067
01:14:51,003 --> 01:14:52,738
It doesn't have to be this way.

1068
01:14:52,772 --> 01:14:56,043
I have an antidote.

1069
01:15:10,824 --> 01:15:14,061
What have you done to me,
you fucking bitch?

1070
01:15:15,962 --> 01:15:17,696
100% effective...

1071
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,466
and ready to ship out worldwide

1072
01:15:19,498 --> 01:15:21,100
at a moment's notice.

1073
01:15:21,133 --> 01:15:23,336
Get out of my room!
You have my word.

1074
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:25,038
Get out!
I will do this...

1075
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:28,640
if the following
conditions are met.

1076
01:15:28,674 --> 01:15:31,345
Get out of my fucking room!

1077
01:15:32,579 --> 01:15:35,415
First, you agree
to end the war on drugs,

1078
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:36,848
once and for all.

1079
01:15:36,882 --> 01:15:39,586
All classes of substance
are legalized...

1080
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:41,588
paving the way
to a new marketplace

1081
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,690
in which sales
are regulated and taxed...

1082
01:15:44,723 --> 01:15:46,124
as per alcohol.

1083
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:51,464
And second, my colleagues and
I receive full legal immunity.

1084
01:15:51,497 --> 01:15:52,632
Meet my terms...

1085
01:15:52,664 --> 01:15:53,809
and I look forward
to helping you

1086
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,935
keep our beloved
country great...

1087
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:57,302
boosting our ailing economy,

1088
01:15:57,337 --> 01:16:00,473
and easing spending
on law enforcement.

1089
01:16:00,507 --> 01:16:02,843
Or continue this
blinkered, outmoded...

1090
01:16:02,875 --> 01:16:06,812
and, frankly, disastrous
exercise in prohibition...

1091
01:16:06,846 --> 01:16:09,116
and live with blood
on your hands.

1092
01:16:10,182 --> 01:16:12,718
Save lives. Legalize.

1093
01:16:18,257 --> 01:16:21,060
I told you that shit
was no good for you.

1094
01:16:29,936 --> 01:16:31,738
Who is Poppy Adams?

1095
01:16:31,771 --> 01:16:33,507
After graduating
Harvard Business School...

1096
01:16:33,539 --> 01:16:34,873
Adams was briefly held

1097
01:16:34,908 --> 01:16:36,776
for serious mental
health issues...

1098
01:16:36,808 --> 01:16:38,845
before disappearing
without a trace.

1099
01:16:38,878 --> 01:16:41,547
Intelligent, ambitious,
ruthless,

1100
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:45,083
lacks empathy,
superficial charm.

1101
01:16:45,118 --> 01:16:48,721
All the elements of a great CEO.

1102
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:51,190
Or a psychopath.

1103
01:16:51,223 --> 01:16:52,225
Following the broadcast

1104
01:16:52,258 --> 01:16:53,826
of Adams's message
to the president...

1105
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:56,029
there were scenes
of chaos today...

1106
01:16:56,061 --> 01:16:58,664
at medical centers
across the country and around the world.

1107
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:00,009
We have no more beds available.

1108
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:03,102
The hospital is
at full capacity.

1109
01:17:03,136 --> 01:17:04,704
The blue rash
is now being renamed

1110
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:06,004
"The Dancing Disease"...

1111
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:09,442
as victims begin to exhibit
stage two symptoms.

1112
01:17:15,281 --> 01:17:17,016
Let's prep the cryo unit.

1113
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,351
You want to freeze him?

1114
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:19,752
Exactly.

1115
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:20,986
Victims of the virus

1116
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:23,556
caused by contaminated
recreational drugs...

1117
01:17:23,589 --> 01:17:27,526
flooded hospitals and clinics
in fear for their lives.

1118
01:17:30,629 --> 01:17:32,073
Curfews and no travel orders

1119
01:17:32,097 --> 01:17:34,066
are being considered
as authorities assess

1120
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,802
the scale of the disaster.

1121
01:17:36,201 --> 01:17:37,870
Close it.

1122
01:17:39,271 --> 01:17:40,772
But there has still been

1123
01:17:40,806 --> 01:17:42,808
no official response
from the president...

1124
01:17:42,842 --> 01:17:45,879
who remains locked
in emergency talks.

1125
01:17:47,613 --> 01:17:50,249
Prepare a presidential decree.

1126
01:17:50,283 --> 01:17:52,618
Tell intelligence and law enforcement
to stand down.

1127
01:17:52,651 --> 01:17:54,753
We're gonna dance
to this lady's tune.

1128
01:17:54,788 --> 01:17:55,888
Good.

1129
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:58,057
We can make this work.

1130
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,491
We spin it
that it's not a matter

1131
01:17:59,525 --> 01:18:00,826
of negotiation with terrorists.

1132
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,829
No, what I'm proposing...

1133
01:18:02,861 --> 01:18:05,730
is we appear
to agree to her demands

1134
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:07,167
to prevent global panic...

1135
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:12,570
and then let the junkie scum
go down in flames. Huh?

1136
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:16,609
Huh? Yeah.

1137
01:18:16,641 --> 01:18:20,612
Take Poppy Adams and her so-called
Golden Circle down with them.

1138
01:18:20,646 --> 01:18:25,317
No drug users, no drug trade.
It's a win-win situation here.

1139
01:18:25,351 --> 01:18:28,720
But, sir, we're not talking about
a handful of hostages.

1140
01:18:28,753 --> 01:18:30,222
We could be looking
at the deaths

1141
01:18:30,256 --> 01:18:32,092
of hundreds
of millions worldwide.

1142
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,402
Hundreds of millions
of criminals,

1143
01:18:33,426 --> 01:18:34,861
burdens to society.

1144
01:18:35,695 --> 01:18:37,197
Am I right, McCoy?

1145
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:38,364
Absolutely, sir.

1146
01:18:38,397 --> 01:18:40,199
But, sir, that's...

1147
01:18:40,232 --> 01:18:42,869
What about people who were
just experimenting?

1148
01:18:42,901 --> 01:18:44,837
Folks who self-medicate?

1149
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:47,772
Functioning
professionals? Kids?

1150
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,541
Oh, spare me the crap, Fox.

1151
01:18:49,574 --> 01:18:50,976
The fact is,

1152
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:54,047
this presidency has just
won the war on drugs.

1153
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:55,314
Congratulations, sir.

1154
01:18:55,882 --> 01:18:57,817
Thank you.

1155
01:18:59,785 --> 01:19:02,888
And that deserves a toast.

1156
01:19:02,923 --> 01:19:05,525
This is totally unethical, sir.

1157
01:19:05,557 --> 01:19:07,259
Fox, shut up!

1158
01:19:07,959 --> 01:19:10,096
McCoy, declare martial law.

1159
01:19:10,129 --> 01:19:12,832
We need to keep control,
commandeer stadiums,

1160
01:19:12,865 --> 01:19:14,767
schools, civic centers...

1161
01:19:14,801 --> 01:19:16,201
order a press blackout.

1162
01:19:16,235 --> 01:19:18,071
And put the military on standby

1163
01:19:18,104 --> 01:19:20,140
to round these junkies up.

1164
01:19:21,074 --> 01:19:22,842
Whether they broke
the law or not,

1165
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:25,145
those victims are human beings.

1166
01:19:27,413 --> 01:19:28,415
Tequila.

1167
01:19:29,615 --> 01:19:31,151
He's a great guy.

1168
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:34,419
And a great agent.

1169
01:19:34,453 --> 01:19:38,223
Right now, he's lying in deep
freeze waitin' on our help.

1170
01:19:38,257 --> 01:19:40,659
We can't make
this personal, sir.

1171
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:41,961
Personal?

1172
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:44,897
Agent, we can't stand by
and let folks like him die.

1173
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:47,467
These people,
we're their only hope.

1174
01:19:49,235 --> 01:19:51,071
Now, we have
to find that antidote.

1175
01:19:51,104 --> 01:19:53,707
Poppy's stockpiles, well,
they could be anywhere.

1176
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:55,675
She must have some on hand.

1177
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,277
Locate Poppy...

1178
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:01,146
and obtain a sample
for analysis.

1179
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,048
Maybe it can be replicated.

1180
01:20:03,082 --> 01:20:04,549
Sorry to cut in, guys.

1181
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,127
But Charlie is on the phone
with his girlfriend.

1182
01:20:06,151 --> 01:20:08,386
Looping you in now.

1183
01:20:08,419 --> 01:20:09,989
Don't worry.
I'm on a payphone...

1184
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:12,624
covered in a fucking blue rash.

1185
01:20:12,658 --> 01:20:13,959
Why didn't you tell me?

1186
01:20:13,993 --> 01:20:16,562
All you said was,
"Don't take any drugs."

1187
01:20:16,596 --> 01:20:18,998
It was a music festival
for fuck's sake.

1188
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:23,102
Fuck. Shit. Shit! Okay.

1189
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,305
Listen. You need to get
to the lab in Italy.

1190
01:20:26,338 --> 01:20:27,841
Do you remember
where we went skiing?

1191
01:20:27,873 --> 01:20:30,342
Yes. Yes, I remember.

1192
01:20:30,377 --> 01:20:31,711
Yeah. Meet me there

1193
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,445
and I'll give you the antidote.

1194
01:20:34,814 --> 01:20:36,115
Okay.

1195
01:20:39,951 --> 01:20:41,787
All right. Jet's ready.

1196
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,356
Whiskey, Galahad, get to Italy.

1197
01:20:48,326 --> 01:20:50,229
You two need to fix
this code name thing.

1198
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:51,797
And with all due respect, sir...

1199
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:53,132
I don't think Galahad senior

1200
01:20:53,165 --> 01:20:54,700
is ready to return to fieldwork.

1201
01:20:55,802 --> 01:20:58,070
I did actually mean...
Of course.

1202
01:20:58,104 --> 01:21:00,673
And with all disrespect...

1203
01:21:00,707 --> 01:21:02,475
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

1204
01:21:03,743 --> 01:21:06,446
Brains, skills...

1205
01:21:07,646 --> 01:21:08,647
skipping rope?

1206
01:21:11,217 --> 01:21:13,018
- It's a lasso.
- Whatever.

1207
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:14,854
Come on.

1208
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,758
Go on. Vamoose.

1209
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,060
Yes, sir.

1210
01:21:32,771 --> 01:21:34,140
Drink it.

1211
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:45,917
Wow.

1212
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:47,552
It's working already.

1213
01:21:47,587 --> 01:21:49,388
Thank God.

1214
01:21:50,022 --> 01:21:51,222
Agent Whiskey.

1215
01:21:51,257 --> 01:21:53,826
Antidote confirmed
at the target's location.

1216
01:21:53,859 --> 01:21:55,195
Good luck.

1217
01:22:03,636 --> 01:22:05,937
Hold up.
We need you down here, Galahad.

1218
01:22:05,972 --> 01:22:07,373
To secure the control room.

1219
01:22:07,405 --> 01:22:09,141
Probably a good idea, Harry.

1220
01:22:10,075 --> 01:22:11,744
Call you from the top, yeah?

1221
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,321
Buongiorno!

1222
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:23,656
Buongiorno.

1223
01:22:36,903 --> 01:22:38,104
Hey!

1224
01:22:39,105 --> 01:22:40,385
So sorry about this.

1225
01:22:45,843 --> 01:22:48,147
At the controls. In position.

1226
01:23:07,266 --> 01:23:09,335
Keep this cable car here
till we get back.

1227
01:23:09,369 --> 01:23:10,937
Roger that, Eggsy.

1228
01:23:10,970 --> 01:23:12,905
Clara's definitely here.

1229
01:23:12,939 --> 01:23:14,339
We're getting warmer.

1230
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:22,549
Harry Hart, Harry Hart,
super spy, super spy.

1231
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,052
Looks like we've got a door.

1232
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,287
Yep.

1233
01:23:28,052 --> 01:23:29,254
There you go.

1234
01:23:39,698 --> 01:23:41,366
I'll cover.

1235
01:23:42,502 --> 01:23:43,503
Hi, there.

1236
01:23:43,836 --> 01:23:44,904
Whew.

1237
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,604
Sorry I'm late.

1238
01:23:46,637 --> 01:23:49,040
You guys did not make
this place easy to find.

1239
01:23:49,074 --> 01:23:51,009
Who are you?

1240
01:23:51,043 --> 01:23:53,679
I'm here to collect
this antidote.

1241
01:23:53,712 --> 01:23:54,714
For Singapore?

1242
01:23:55,647 --> 01:23:56,850
Yeah.

1243
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,655
You are Wu Ting Feng?

1244
01:24:07,627 --> 01:24:08,628
Yes.

1245
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,397
Hey, how are you still alive?

1246
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:14,633
River, what are you doing here?

1247
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:15,735
River?

1248
01:24:15,767 --> 01:24:17,002
Hi, Clara.

1249
01:24:17,035 --> 01:24:20,140
What happens at Glasto,
stays in Glasto.

1250
01:24:23,008 --> 01:24:24,776
You motherfucker!
Bye, Charlie.

1251
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,913
Sound the alarm!

1252
01:24:26,945 --> 01:24:28,446
You fucking cockroach!

1253
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:30,483
Jam the door!
Give...

1254
01:24:37,522 --> 01:24:39,124
Fuck!

1255
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:41,026
Galahad, we're coming.

1256
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:42,762
All clear at the bottom?

1257
01:24:43,695 --> 01:24:46,064
Galahad, come in!

1258
01:24:46,097 --> 01:24:47,899
Open the fucking door.
They've locked.

1259
01:24:47,932 --> 01:24:49,168
Open the door!

1260
01:24:51,035 --> 01:24:52,346
Harry, come on, we're in.
Let's go.

1261
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:53,806
Away, butterflies.

1262
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:56,308
Butterfly? No, Harry. You've
got to shut the doors, please.

1263
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,310
Come on.
We've gotta go now. Please!

1264
01:24:58,342 --> 01:25:00,278
Shut the fucking door, Harry!

1265
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:01,914
Harry, are you there?

1266
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:05,618
Well done, Harry.
Good. Thanks, man.

1267
01:25:05,651 --> 01:25:06,718
Come on. Now!

1268
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,390
It's done.
Thank you.

1269
01:25:34,245 --> 01:25:35,948
You all good down there, Harry?

1270
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:37,216
All clear.

1271
01:25:42,754 --> 01:25:43,789
Hello, Eggsy.

1272
01:25:45,123 --> 01:25:47,226
Enjoy the ride, bruv.

1273
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:57,437
Oh, shit.

1274
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:08,381
All the buttons are dead.
Controls gone.

1275
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:10,650
Everything's in shutdown.
You're on your own, Eggsy.

1276
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:57,529
What the fuck is that?

1277
01:27:13,779 --> 01:27:14,881
Oh, my God.

1278
01:27:48,748 --> 01:27:50,817
You've gotta be fucking kidding!

1279
01:28:09,601 --> 01:28:11,470
Jesus fucking Christ!
What the fuck is that?

1280
01:28:11,503 --> 01:28:13,806
What the hell is that?

1281
01:28:13,838 --> 01:28:14,873
Shit!

1282
01:28:40,097 --> 01:28:44,903
That's the first decent shit
I've had in three weeks.

1283
01:28:49,507 --> 01:28:51,910
Harry, meet us at the
emergency rendezvous point.

1284
01:28:51,944 --> 01:28:53,111
Roger that.

1285
01:28:53,846 --> 01:28:55,114
Got you on the GPS.

1286
01:29:23,909 --> 01:29:25,578
So weird to think
this tiny thing

1287
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,312
could save the world.

1288
01:29:27,346 --> 01:29:29,114
Let me have a look.

1289
01:29:32,817 --> 01:29:33,985
Harry.

1290
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:39,892
Am I late?

1291
01:29:40,692 --> 01:29:41,927
You found the antidote.

1292
01:29:44,864 --> 01:29:45,964
Get down!

1293
01:30:03,048 --> 01:30:04,417
You fucking dickhead!

1294
01:30:04,449 --> 01:30:05,916
Fuck you!
I just saved your life!

1295
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:08,154
Yeah, and cost millions
of people theirs!

1296
01:30:21,734 --> 01:30:24,703
All right, they're going
for cover and reloading.

1297
01:30:24,736 --> 01:30:26,972
I'll fix their wagons.
Cover me, boys!

1298
01:30:30,007 --> 01:30:31,042
Wait.

1299
01:30:31,075 --> 01:30:33,645
Eggsy, I think he could be
working for the other side.

1300
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,513
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1301
01:30:35,547 --> 01:30:38,083
You're having
a brain fart! Look!

1302
01:30:38,116 --> 01:30:41,654
Does that look like
he's working with them?

1303
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:44,622
Harry, are you seeing
butterflies again?

1304
01:30:44,655 --> 01:30:46,057
I know what I'm seeing.

1305
01:31:37,942 --> 01:31:40,512
Good job
he didn't need our help.

1306
01:31:40,546 --> 01:31:43,281
Thank fucking Christ
I didn't need any backup!

1307
01:31:49,655 --> 01:31:52,090
I'm out of ammo!
Troop carrier coming in.

1308
01:31:52,123 --> 01:31:53,224
What've you got?

1309
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,095
Fuck!

1310
01:32:00,333 --> 01:32:01,968
Shit!
There's a fuck ton of 'em!

1311
01:32:05,303 --> 01:32:06,939
What is this?

1312
01:32:06,972 --> 01:32:09,942
Looks like you packed for
a fucking slumber party, not a mission!

1313
01:32:11,043 --> 01:32:13,912
And they've got
fucking Gatling guns!

1314
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:17,248
You have 10 seconds
to surrender before we open fire!

1315
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:18,417
Guys, hurry up!

1316
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:19,483
10!

1317
01:32:19,517 --> 01:32:20,918
Hey!

1318
01:32:20,953 --> 01:32:23,089
9!
Butterfly guy!

1319
01:32:24,489 --> 01:32:25,558
8!

1320
01:32:25,591 --> 01:32:27,493
You don't look like
Ginger fixed you right.

1321
01:32:27,525 --> 01:32:28,626
7!

1322
01:32:28,659 --> 01:32:29,794
I said I'm empty!

1323
01:32:29,829 --> 01:32:31,330
6!
Give me yours.

1324
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:32,831
5!

1325
01:32:32,865 --> 01:32:34,199
Harry, give him the fucking gun!

1326
01:32:34,231 --> 01:32:35,266
4!

1327
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:39,137
Harry, no!

1328
01:32:43,275 --> 01:32:44,710
Oh, fuck it! Fire!

1329
01:32:44,744 --> 01:32:45,978
Harry, get down!

1330
01:32:53,485 --> 01:32:54,886
I mean, honestly, Harry,

1331
01:32:54,919 --> 01:32:56,355
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1332
01:32:56,387 --> 01:32:58,756
He broke the vial on purpose!

1333
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:01,192
You're a fucking idiot!
You're out of control, Harry!

1334
01:33:01,226 --> 01:33:03,306
If we made it out of here,
he was gonna kill us both!

1335
01:33:08,167 --> 01:33:10,703
For fuck's sake, it looks like he wouldn't
have fucking had to!

1336
01:33:10,735 --> 01:33:12,171
Oh, ye of little faith.

1337
01:33:33,859 --> 01:33:36,227
This does not mean
you're off the fucking hook!

1338
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:38,664
We need to go dark.

1339
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:39,940
We don't know
who else at Statesman

1340
01:33:39,964 --> 01:33:42,433
could be working against us.

1341
01:33:42,467 --> 01:33:43,567
Shit! This is all my fault.

1342
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:44,679
You weren't ready for the field

1343
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:45,770
and I pushed for it!

1344
01:33:45,803 --> 01:33:46,872
He showed his hand.

1345
01:33:46,905 --> 01:33:48,707
You think he'd have let us live?

1346
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:50,741
You should be thanking me
for saving our arses!

1347
01:33:50,775 --> 01:33:51,844
Saving our arses?

1348
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:53,412
Try saying that
to fucking Whiskey!

1349
01:34:03,622 --> 01:34:06,025
You are unbelievable!

1350
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,926
- Merlin, can you hear me?
- Yes, Eggsy.

1351
01:34:07,959 --> 01:34:09,261
Whiskey's down.
He's been shot.

1352
01:34:09,761 --> 01:34:11,163
What happened?

1353
01:34:18,035 --> 01:34:20,905
He got caught in the crossfire.

1354
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:22,975
I've applied the alpha gel.
We'll bring him in.

1355
01:34:23,007 --> 01:34:24,853
But first, I've gotta find a
way to get back up to that lab

1356
01:34:24,877 --> 01:34:26,678
and retrieve more antidote.

1357
01:34:29,381 --> 01:34:32,484
Charlie, what's
happening? Where are you?

1358
01:34:32,516 --> 01:34:34,118
Everything's under control.

1359
01:34:34,151 --> 01:34:36,855
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I'm so sorry.

1360
01:34:36,887 --> 01:34:39,156
Please don't tell Poppy
it was me they followed.

1361
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:40,658
Don't worry, darling.

1362
01:34:40,692 --> 01:34:42,694
What happens in Italy...

1363
01:34:45,196 --> 01:34:46,431
stays in Italy.

1364
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:48,833
Thank you.

1365
01:35:01,981 --> 01:35:06,552
Merlin, change of plans.
Wu Ting Feng, Singapore.

1366
01:35:06,584 --> 01:35:07,819
- Who?
- Exactly.

1367
01:35:07,852 --> 01:35:09,520
It's the only lead we've got.

1368
01:35:09,555 --> 01:35:11,222
So I suggest
you find out who he is.

1369
01:35:13,123 --> 01:35:14,159
Come on.

1370
01:35:18,163 --> 01:35:20,932
Wu Ting Feng, he's
an assistant at a law firm.

1371
01:35:20,964 --> 01:35:22,601
Let's get through
their firewall.

1372
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:23,868
Yep.

1373
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:26,004
Merlin...

1374
01:35:26,037 --> 01:35:28,507
have you ever wanted
to do more than this?

1375
01:35:29,507 --> 01:35:31,109
Are you serious?
Yeah.

1376
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:32,076
This is vital.

1377
01:35:32,110 --> 01:35:33,778
Without us, they'd be lost.

1378
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:36,113
I know, but you know
what I mean.

1379
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,549
Get out there in the field.

1380
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:39,750
Well, have you ever asked?

1381
01:35:39,784 --> 01:35:41,020
Of course I have.

1382
01:35:41,052 --> 01:35:43,488
But every time an agent's
position has come up...

1383
01:35:43,521 --> 01:35:46,324
Whiskey has voted against me.

1384
01:35:46,357 --> 01:35:48,258
No.
Yeah.

1385
01:35:48,293 --> 01:35:50,562
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, check it out.

1386
01:35:50,596 --> 01:35:51,664
Email in from Poppy,

1387
01:35:51,696 --> 01:35:53,565
from a senior partner
at the firm.

1388
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,534
They're coordinates.

1389
01:36:00,138 --> 01:36:01,373
Cambodia?

1390
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,909
You have any reconnaissance
drones down in Asia?

1391
01:36:04,942 --> 01:36:06,622
Sure do.
Sending them in right now.

1392
01:36:13,383 --> 01:36:14,962
The government today urged

1393
01:36:14,986 --> 01:36:16,154
Golden Circle victims...

1394
01:36:16,186 --> 01:36:18,122
to report to
the temporary field hospitals

1395
01:36:18,155 --> 01:36:21,025
now set up across the country.

1396
01:36:21,058 --> 01:36:22,869
The president's
handling of the crisis

1397
01:36:22,893 --> 01:36:25,664
has been commended
by other world leaders.

1398
01:36:25,698 --> 01:36:28,433
Damn. Politics has
never been so easy.

1399
01:36:28,467 --> 01:36:30,602
Oh, Jesus, Fox.

1400
01:36:30,634 --> 01:36:31,936
What?

1401
01:36:39,878 --> 01:36:41,247
Oh, God.

1402
01:36:45,984 --> 01:36:47,151
Like I said, sir...

1403
01:36:47,185 --> 01:36:49,888
this affects all people
from all backgrounds.

1404
01:36:49,921 --> 01:36:51,722
I'm disappointed, Fox.

1405
01:36:51,756 --> 01:36:53,624
Disappointed and disgusted.

1406
01:36:53,658 --> 01:36:56,662
Mr. President,
I routinely work

1407
01:36:56,695 --> 01:36:59,130
a 20 hour day for you,
7 days a week.

1408
01:36:59,164 --> 01:37:02,301
Maybe some can do that
without chemical help.

1409
01:37:02,333 --> 01:37:05,470
Countless people
are going to die.

1410
01:37:05,503 --> 01:37:07,138
You can save them, sir.

1411
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:09,642
Innocent people like me.

1412
01:37:12,009 --> 01:37:13,913
Not that innocent.

1413
01:37:44,409 --> 01:37:45,544
He looks great.

1414
01:37:45,576 --> 01:37:46,611
Good.

1415
01:37:51,949 --> 01:37:53,317
Good news, gentlemen.

1416
01:37:53,351 --> 01:37:54,953
He'll be back on
his feet in no time.

1417
01:37:54,986 --> 01:37:56,954
I'm not certain
that's a good idea.

1418
01:37:56,988 --> 01:37:58,089
What do you mean?

1419
01:37:58,123 --> 01:38:00,159
I shot Agent Whiskey.
Deliberately.

1420
01:38:00,592 --> 01:38:01,692
What, why?

1421
01:38:01,726 --> 01:38:02,927
He was working against us.

1422
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:05,062
And until we find out why,
I say we trust no one.

1423
01:38:05,096 --> 01:38:07,231
Merlin, Harry's sick.

1424
01:38:07,265 --> 01:38:09,133
This whole thing is my fault.

1425
01:38:09,167 --> 01:38:10,668
I thought he was ready.

1426
01:38:15,973 --> 01:38:18,543
I'm sorry,
I've got to take this.

1427
01:38:18,576 --> 01:38:19,977
Listen to me.

1428
01:38:20,011 --> 01:38:21,613
This is not about
my mental health.

1429
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:24,249
If there's a chance there's
a double agent in our midst...

1430
01:38:24,281 --> 01:38:28,953
or worse, if Statesman itself
has a dark agenda...

1431
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:30,654
we have to safeguard
this mission.

1432
01:38:30,687 --> 01:38:34,625
We both know the president
wants these victims dead.

1433
01:38:34,659 --> 01:38:36,027
Hey, baby.

1434
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:39,230
Hey.

1435
01:38:41,565 --> 01:38:42,499
Fuck.

1436
01:38:42,533 --> 01:38:45,336
Look, Harry, I trust you.
I always have.

1437
01:38:45,369 --> 01:38:49,973
But it's about this situation.
We need Statesman's resources.

1438
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:52,075
And I need to know
that you are fit for work.

1439
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:53,845
Babe, why didn't you call me?

1440
01:38:53,878 --> 01:38:55,379
Are you the banana man?

1441
01:38:55,413 --> 01:38:56,915
Listen, we're on
the verge of finding

1442
01:38:56,948 --> 01:38:58,549
an antidote.
It's gonna be all right.

1443
01:38:58,583 --> 01:38:59,451
Now, look left for me.

1444
01:38:59,484 --> 01:39:00,761
There's nothing wrong
with my brain.

1445
01:39:00,785 --> 01:39:02,252
Look right.

1446
01:39:02,287 --> 01:39:03,555
Can you remember the headline

1447
01:39:03,588 --> 01:39:05,332
when you uncovered
that spy ring in the Pentagon?

1448
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:07,491
The football.
England beat Germany, 5-1.

1449
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:09,026
Thatcher's
assassination attempt.

1450
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:10,128
Charles and Di's wedding.

1451
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,730
Hey, Bjorn Borg.

1452
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,976
Babe, if you can hear me,

1453
01:39:24,008 --> 01:39:26,278
I want you to know
that I love you.

1454
01:39:26,311 --> 01:39:28,355
And if we get through this,
and you'll have me back...

1455
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:31,216
I wanna be with you.
No matter what.

1456
01:39:31,249 --> 01:39:32,326
I promise I won't let you down.

1457
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:33,951
It's all gonna be all right.

1458
01:39:33,985 --> 01:39:35,386
My favorite singer.

1459
01:39:35,419 --> 01:39:37,655
I don't bloody know.
How would I know that?

1460
01:39:37,689 --> 01:39:39,991
It's John Denver.
Merlin!

1461
01:39:40,025 --> 01:39:42,027
Have you got eyes
on that location yet?

1462
01:39:42,061 --> 01:39:44,129
Soon. The reconnaissance
drone's about an hour away.

1463
01:39:44,162 --> 01:39:45,305
Which gives us time
to sort out...

1464
01:39:45,329 --> 01:39:47,031
Bollocks, we haven't
time for anything.

1465
01:39:47,065 --> 01:39:49,368
I'm leaving now.
With or without you.

1466
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:09,287
Hello!

1467
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:10,689
Identify yourself.

1468
01:40:10,722 --> 01:40:15,259
My name is Stacey Prewitt.
I'm Ms. Poppy Adams' attorney.

1469
01:40:15,293 --> 01:40:17,362
Poppy, you expecting
a lawyer tonight?

1470
01:40:17,395 --> 01:40:19,431
Oh, yes. Please send him in.

1471
01:40:19,463 --> 01:40:22,567
But don't forget to
reactivate the landmines.

1472
01:40:27,905 --> 01:40:29,439
Good evening, Ms. Adams.

1473
01:40:29,473 --> 01:40:34,745
My lawyer is bringing you
the document right now.

1474
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:36,248
Hurry up.

1475
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,381
And once you countersign,

1476
01:40:37,415 --> 01:40:38,749
it becomes
an executive decree...

1477
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,884
and you can't back out,

1478
01:40:39,918 --> 01:40:41,219
and then I release the antidote.

1479
01:40:41,252 --> 01:40:42,587
Can you give me any assurance

1480
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:44,388
you can get it
out there in time?

1481
01:40:44,422 --> 01:40:45,500
And where's it gonna come from?

1482
01:40:45,524 --> 01:40:46,857
How long it'll take
to distribute?

1483
01:40:46,891 --> 01:40:49,494
I wouldn't worry about that.
I have secure stockpiles...

1484
01:40:49,528 --> 01:40:52,564
hidden in every
major city worldwide.

1485
01:40:52,597 --> 01:40:55,000
And when I enter
the access code...

1486
01:40:55,033 --> 01:40:56,433
my fleet of drones

1487
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,337
will distribute
the antidote immediately.

1488
01:40:59,369 --> 01:41:01,872
So don't dilly-dally
signin' that document

1489
01:41:01,906 --> 01:41:03,674
'cause time is running out.

1490
01:41:06,512 --> 01:41:07,846
You dumb bitch!

1491
01:41:17,823 --> 01:41:18,856
You all right?

1492
01:41:20,926 --> 01:41:22,961
What was that
phone call you got?

1493
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:25,263
Let's not, Harry.

1494
01:41:25,296 --> 01:41:26,597
I don't think
you'd sympathize...

1495
01:41:26,631 --> 01:41:28,799
and I'm not really in
the mood for a lecture.

1496
01:41:32,803 --> 01:41:33,838
All right.

1497
01:41:36,708 --> 01:41:39,645
How about a martini?
For old times' sake?

1498
01:41:41,745 --> 01:41:42,780
Yeah, all right.

1499
01:41:55,927 --> 01:41:57,896
I had a girlfriend.

1500
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:01,632
I lost her.

1501
01:42:02,633 --> 01:42:04,203
And it broke me.

1502
01:42:06,171 --> 01:42:08,606
And now,
if this mission fails...

1503
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,375
she's gonna die.

1504
01:42:13,378 --> 01:42:15,681
I know it's against
Kingsman rules,

1505
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,748
having a relationship.

1506
01:42:21,753 --> 01:42:23,554
When I was shot...

1507
01:42:23,588 --> 01:42:25,156
can you guess
what the last thing was

1508
01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:26,658
that flashed through my mind?

1509
01:42:29,127 --> 01:42:32,830
It was absolutely nothing.

1510
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:36,802
I had no ties.

1511
01:42:37,502 --> 01:42:40,471
No bittersweet memories.

1512
01:42:40,503 --> 01:42:42,573
I was leaving nothing behind.

1513
01:42:44,542 --> 01:42:46,812
Never experienced
companionship...

1514
01:42:47,811 --> 01:42:49,347
never been in love...

1515
01:42:50,448 --> 01:42:52,383
and in that moment...

1516
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:56,120
all I felt was loneliness...

1517
01:42:56,154 --> 01:42:57,388
and regret.

1518
01:42:59,024 --> 01:43:00,557
I'm sorry.

1519
01:43:00,592 --> 01:43:01,627
Don't be.

1520
01:43:03,828 --> 01:43:06,365
Just know that
having something to lose...

1521
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:10,868
is what makes life worth living.

1522
01:43:11,735 --> 01:43:13,838
Now, let's go
and save your girl.

1523
01:43:15,173 --> 01:43:16,875
I missed you, Harry.

1524
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:23,480
Gentlemen.

1525
01:43:23,513 --> 01:43:25,417
I hate to break up a party.

1526
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:28,586
We're nearly there,
so I suggest we get ready.

1527
01:43:29,887 --> 01:43:30,921
Follow me.

1528
01:43:40,698 --> 01:43:42,801
Oh, yes.

1529
01:43:52,276 --> 01:43:53,877
Hello, gorgeous.

1530
01:43:53,912 --> 01:43:55,046
I'm Jack. What's your name?

1531
01:43:55,079 --> 01:43:57,381
How would you like to ride
home on a real cowboy?

1532
01:43:57,415 --> 01:43:58,984
I got a six pack
of cold ones on ice

1533
01:43:59,016 --> 01:44:00,184
and my roomie's out all night.

1534
01:44:00,217 --> 01:44:03,453
So you can scream my name
as loud as you need to, sugar.

1535
01:44:03,488 --> 01:44:06,258
I hate to do this to you, Jack.

1536
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:07,391
Who's this pretty lady?

1537
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,826
She's dead.

1538
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:11,462
Cops said wrong place,
wrong time.

1539
01:44:11,494 --> 01:44:13,631
Hey, honey. I'm heading
to the grocery store.

1540
01:44:18,602 --> 01:44:19,971
My name is Poppy Adams.

1541
01:44:36,921 --> 01:44:37,955
Ginger.

1542
01:44:37,989 --> 01:44:41,426
Goddamn butterfly guy shot me
in the fucking head.

1543
01:44:41,458 --> 01:44:42,927
Why would he do that?

1544
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:47,932
Well, I'm guessing
you didn't fix him right.

1545
01:44:47,966 --> 01:44:49,567
And where the hell is he?

1546
01:44:49,601 --> 01:44:53,304
He's on his way to Cambodia
with Eggsy and Merlin.

1547
01:44:53,337 --> 01:44:55,373
That's where Poppy's base is.

1548
01:44:55,406 --> 01:44:57,107
Eggsy's gonna need backup.

1549
01:44:57,141 --> 01:44:58,375
Yes, he is.

1550
01:44:58,409 --> 01:44:59,845
Get the Silver Pony
on the runway

1551
01:44:59,878 --> 01:45:01,079
and ready to take off.

1552
01:45:11,823 --> 01:45:13,124
Hey, hey.

1553
01:45:13,156 --> 01:45:15,726
Looking good, Merlin.

1554
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:18,262
Feeling good, Eggsy.

1555
01:45:21,298 --> 01:45:23,567
Right. This is yours.

1556
01:45:24,970 --> 01:45:26,104
That's for you.

1557
01:45:38,917 --> 01:45:40,619
Press the "S".

1558
01:45:41,384 --> 01:45:42,954
Minesweeper.

1559
01:45:42,986 --> 01:45:44,954
Courtesy of Statesman.

1560
01:45:44,989 --> 01:45:47,225
- And what about these?
- Careful.

1561
01:45:47,257 --> 01:45:48,726
Those are hand grenades.

1562
01:45:50,994 --> 01:45:52,963
As discussed...

1563
01:45:52,997 --> 01:45:54,165
this is for the endgame.

1564
01:45:55,065 --> 01:45:56,600
I'm entrusting it to you.

1565
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:05,744
And I'm entrusting this...

1566
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:09,748
to me.

1567
01:46:32,137 --> 01:46:35,973
Millions of
Golden Circle victims worldwide...

1568
01:46:36,007 --> 01:46:38,810
are now entering
stage three paralysis.

1569
01:46:41,445 --> 01:46:42,555
In his latest statement...

1570
01:46:42,579 --> 01:46:44,149
the president promised
he was doing

1571
01:46:44,181 --> 01:46:45,548
everything in his power...

1572
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:48,720
to speed up negotiations
and save lives.

1573
01:46:48,753 --> 01:46:50,421
But fears are growing
that for many,

1574
01:46:50,454 --> 01:46:52,223
it may soon be too late.

1575
01:46:52,257 --> 01:46:55,426
Our thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.

1576
01:46:55,458 --> 01:46:56,727
God help us all.

1577
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,948
Right.
This is where we split up.

1578
01:47:41,972 --> 01:47:43,373
Pincer movement.

1579
01:47:43,406 --> 01:47:44,741
Merlin, you're with me.

1580
01:47:44,775 --> 01:47:46,978
Eggsy, you signal
when we're in position.

1581
01:47:55,186 --> 01:47:57,255
Don't move.

1582
01:47:58,289 --> 01:48:00,992
You move, we die.

1583
01:48:09,433 --> 01:48:11,602
Luckily, I have this.

1584
01:48:19,944 --> 01:48:23,714
This spray will freeze
the trigger mechanism...

1585
01:48:23,748 --> 01:48:26,817
give us a split second.

1586
01:48:27,619 --> 01:48:30,121
So on the count of three...

1587
01:48:30,154 --> 01:48:31,422
what I want you to...

1588
01:48:31,454 --> 01:48:32,690
Merlin!

1589
01:48:48,472 --> 01:48:50,541
Merlin, what the fuck
have you done?

1590
01:48:50,574 --> 01:48:54,144
Our journey together
began many years ago...

1591
01:48:54,178 --> 01:48:56,815
when your father
did the same thing for us.

1592
01:48:56,847 --> 01:48:59,549
Our journey began
with a mistake I made.

1593
01:48:59,583 --> 01:49:01,653
Give me the can.
That's an order.

1594
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:03,188
Can's empty.

1595
01:49:03,855 --> 01:49:05,623
Split second's over.

1596
01:49:05,656 --> 01:49:07,292
You two need to get going.

1597
01:49:07,324 --> 01:49:09,026
No, no, no.
There's got to be another way.

1598
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:10,061
He's right.

1599
01:49:10,095 --> 01:49:11,596
Mission comes first.

1600
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:12,963
Bollocks, mission comes first!

1601
01:49:12,997 --> 01:49:14,065
Eggsy!

1602
01:49:14,097 --> 01:49:16,734
This is no time for emotion.
Remember your training.

1603
01:49:16,767 --> 01:49:18,203
Or we all die.

1604
01:49:20,504 --> 01:49:22,306
Now get on with it.

1605
01:49:22,338 --> 01:49:24,842
Do as you're told.
Move it!

1606
01:49:32,283 --> 01:49:33,284
Go.

1607
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,361
It's been an honor.

1608
01:49:45,629 --> 01:49:46,830
Good luck.

He stepped on a land mine.

01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:45,350
Can we get somebody out there

Crap. We're under attack.

Sir Elton, stay here.
We're under attack.

1647
01:52:17,213 --> 01:52:19,449
Is it a rescue attempt?
Might be.

1648
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:21,551

01:52:34,097 --> 01:52:36,167
What day is it today?
Wednesday.

1656
01:52:36,199 --> 01:52:37,367
Exactly!

1657
01:53:18,107 --> 01:53:20,345
Elton, just calm down.
Fuck you!

1658
01:53:32,123 --> 01:53:33,424
Stay there, Elton.

1659
01:53:33,457 --> 01:53:34,557
Fuck off!

1660
01:53:34,592 --> 01:53:36,594
Or I'll fuck you up.

1661
01:54:11,494 --> 01:54:12,497
Fuck me.

1662
01:55:11,954 --> 01:55:14,292
Holy cow.
Get this out of here. Go!

1663
01:55:16,125 --> 01:55:17,328
Eggsy, get the case.

1664
01:55:22,165 --> 01:55:23,834
You are going to tell me...

1665
01:55:23,868 --> 01:55:25,401
what the access code is.

1666
01:56:55,993 --> 01:56:58,428
Come on, Jet. Good girl.

1667
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,369
Motherfucker!

1668
01:57:37,834 --> 01:57:40,102
Get out of the way, Elton.

1669
01:57:40,137 --> 01:57:42,406
Stay down.
It's not allowed to hurt me.

1670
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:43,441
Thank you.

1671
01:58:21,744 --> 01:58:22,913
Fuck you, Poppy!

1672
01:58:23,646 --> 01:58:24,948
Fuck you, Poppy!

1673
01:58:25,615 --> 01:58:27,618
Fuck you, Elton.

1674
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:31,689
Kill Elton John.

1675
01:58:34,824 --> 01:58:35,892
Fuck!

1676
01:58:38,095 --> 01:58:39,797
Elton, take the ball.

1677
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:50,407
Thank you.

1678
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:52,842
Now, go off and save the world.

1679
01:58:52,875 --> 01:58:54,678
If I save the world,
can I have two tickets

1680
01:58:54,712 --> 01:58:55,879
to your next concert?

1681
01:58:55,913 --> 01:58:57,881
Darling, if you save the world,

1682
01:58:57,914 --> 01:58:59,717
you can have a backstage pass.

1683
01:59:07,991 --> 01:59:09,726
Fuck you.

1684
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:14,030
Time's up.

1685
01:59:14,064 --> 01:59:15,333
Fuck!

1686
01:59:20,936 --> 01:59:22,136
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie!

1687
01:59:22,539 --> 01:59:23,573
Get them!

1688
01:59:23,606 --> 01:59:24,673
Got it.

1689
01:59:25,810 --> 01:59:27,178
Kill him, Bennie!

1690
01:59:27,211 --> 01:59:29,512
Here, heel! Heel! Good boy!

1691
01:59:29,546 --> 01:59:30,580
Come on!

1692
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:38,254
Give me the code.

1693
01:59:38,288 --> 01:59:40,024
No. We're not done yet.

1694
01:59:46,096 --> 01:59:47,364
Lucky for you, Charlie...

1695
01:59:47,396 --> 01:59:48,464
one of us understands

1696
01:59:48,498 --> 01:59:49,999
what it means to be a gentleman.

1697
01:59:55,539 --> 01:59:57,008
Let's make this fair.

1698
02:00:43,753 --> 02:00:45,021
Give me the code!

1699
02:00:45,055 --> 02:00:46,990
I can't.

1700
02:00:47,024 --> 02:00:48,792
Only Poppy knows it.

1701
02:00:48,824 --> 02:00:50,627
Well, then you're no use
to me, are you?

1702
02:00:51,294 --> 02:00:52,428
For the record, Charlie...

1703
02:00:52,462 --> 02:00:55,799
I'm more of a gentleman
than you'll ever be.

1704
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:58,402
But right now, it's time
to drop the gentle bit.

1705
02:00:59,570 --> 02:01:01,038
This is for Kingsman.

1706
02:01:02,039 --> 02:01:03,641
For my mate Brandon.

1707
02:01:04,374 --> 02:01:06,208
For Roxy.

1708
02:01:06,241 --> 02:01:07,778
For JB.

1709
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:11,649
And for Merlin.

1710
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:14,918
Good night, bruv.

1711
02:01:41,343 --> 02:01:43,513
Hey, fellas.

1712
02:01:43,547 --> 02:01:45,115
You're going to
give us the code.

1713
02:01:45,147 --> 02:01:47,049
Mmm.

1714
02:01:47,083 --> 02:01:48,352
Or what?

1715
02:01:48,386 --> 02:01:50,588
'Cause you don't seem like
the kind of gentleman

1716
02:01:50,620 --> 02:01:53,123
who would hurt a lady.

1717
02:01:55,958 --> 02:01:58,761
Perhaps not.
Call me old-fashioned...

1718
02:01:58,794 --> 02:02:01,196
I don't consider genocide
especially ladylike.

1719
02:02:01,231 --> 02:02:03,968
Right. Enough small talk.

1720
02:02:06,235 --> 02:02:07,336
Give us the code.

1721
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:08,638
Sure.

1722
02:02:08,672 --> 02:02:10,975
No. I don't think so.

1723
02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:12,776
Ooh!

1724
02:02:15,178 --> 02:02:16,446
Ow!

1725
02:02:21,016 --> 02:02:22,618
Heroin.

1726
02:02:22,651 --> 02:02:24,020
You know, where I come from...

1727
02:02:24,053 --> 02:02:26,213
this shit you've been peddling's
ruined a lot of lives.

1728
02:02:27,289 --> 02:02:29,426
But yours is even more deadly.

1729
02:02:29,458 --> 02:02:31,528
But it feels so nice,
it's gonna make you

1730
02:02:31,561 --> 02:02:33,363
lower your guard.
Mmm.

1731
02:02:33,396 --> 02:02:36,900
Our colleague, Merlin,
may he rest in peace...

1732
02:02:36,932 --> 02:02:39,435
managed to synthesize your
horrible little formula...

1733
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:40,771
and speed up its effects.

1734
02:02:40,805 --> 02:02:43,807
So I would say you have
just under eight minutes...

1735
02:02:43,841 --> 02:02:46,643
before paralysis sets in
and your breathing stops.

1736
02:02:46,677 --> 02:02:49,379
But, of course,
you know all about that.

1737
02:02:49,413 --> 02:02:52,415
So here's the deal.
You release the antidote worldwide,

1738
02:02:52,449 --> 02:02:54,250
and we make sure you get a dose.

1739
02:02:54,284 --> 02:02:56,385
I have to give you
the code to live?

1740
02:02:56,419 --> 02:02:59,656
Honey, you're so smart.
You should work for me.

1741
02:02:59,690 --> 02:03:02,259
Right. Give us the code.

1742
02:03:02,293 --> 02:03:06,263
Why not? The decree's getting
signed soon...

1743
02:03:06,297 --> 02:03:07,964
anyhoo. Um...

1744
02:03:08,597 --> 02:03:10,967
It's "Viva las vegan."

1745
02:03:12,069 --> 02:03:13,169
Get it?

1746
02:03:13,838 --> 02:03:16,306
"Viva las..."

1747
02:03:16,339 --> 02:03:17,708
Mmm.

1748
02:03:18,708 --> 02:03:20,778
Come snuggle with me.

1749
02:03:21,578 --> 02:03:23,647
I like you.

1750
02:03:25,649 --> 02:03:27,852
I don't think
that's terribly likely.

1751
02:03:50,173 --> 02:03:51,308
She's OD'd.

1752
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:52,810
You gave her too much.

1753
02:03:52,842 --> 02:03:54,377
Did I?

1754
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:57,023
You know, I really don't have as much
experience with all this drug stuff...

1755
02:03:57,047 --> 02:03:58,048
as people think.

1756
02:03:58,714 --> 02:04:00,049
Better be the right code.

1757
02:04:03,887 --> 02:04:07,356
"Viva las..."

1758
02:04:07,391 --> 02:04:08,692
So?

1759
02:04:12,262 --> 02:04:13,597
Don't move, kid.

1760
02:04:13,629 --> 02:04:14,832
You try anything funny,

1761
02:04:14,865 --> 02:04:16,185
and I'll turn
this thing electric.

1762
02:04:17,667 --> 02:04:20,303
Now give up your guns,
fellas. Slide 'em over.

1763
02:04:26,008 --> 02:04:26,909
Whiskey.

1764
02:04:26,944 --> 02:04:28,812
We are all
on the same side here.

1765
02:04:28,846 --> 02:04:29,946
You've had a head injury.

1766
02:04:29,980 --> 02:04:31,748
The exact same thing
happened to Harry.

1767
02:04:31,781 --> 02:04:34,250
You're havin'
some sort of brain glitch.

1768
02:04:34,284 --> 02:04:37,154
Nope. My brain's
all good, kid.

1769
02:04:37,686 --> 02:04:39,122
And you know what?

1770
02:04:39,155 --> 02:04:42,926
I reckon the same was true for your friend
Harry over here.

1771
02:04:42,958 --> 02:04:45,961
Real fine instincts,
I'll give him that.

1772
02:04:45,995 --> 02:04:47,396
So stay still...

1773
02:04:47,430 --> 02:04:48,541
or I'll dice him up so small,

1774
02:04:48,565 --> 02:04:49,675
you can take him
home in a bucket...

1775
02:04:49,699 --> 02:04:51,067
and still have room
for what's left

1776
02:04:51,101 --> 02:04:52,636
of your buddy, Merlin.

1777
02:04:53,671 --> 02:04:55,338
Well, that's just fucking great.

1778
02:04:55,372 --> 02:04:56,940
You're working
for the president?

1779
02:04:56,973 --> 02:04:58,208
That asshole?

1780
02:04:59,342 --> 02:05:03,480
Hell no. It's a matter
of personal principle, agent.

1781
02:05:03,512 --> 02:05:06,015
No more drug users.

1782
02:05:06,048 --> 02:05:09,118
And the Statesman
share price rockets.

1783
02:05:10,587 --> 02:05:13,890
So those are your principles?
Making money?

1784
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:16,226
Our agencies were
founded to uphold peace.

1785
02:05:16,258 --> 02:05:17,461
To protect the innocent.

1786
02:05:17,494 --> 02:05:19,562
Do you wanna know
who was innocent?

1787
02:05:19,596 --> 02:05:22,600
My high school sweetheart.

1788
02:05:23,066 --> 02:05:24,901
Love of my life.

1789
02:05:24,935 --> 02:05:26,837
Pregnant with my little boy.

1790
02:05:27,736 --> 02:05:29,707
He'd be about your age now...

1791
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:31,708
if his mama hadn't got caught
in the crossfire...

1792
02:05:31,741 --> 02:05:32,842
when two meth head freaks

1793
02:05:32,875 --> 02:05:35,913
decided to rob
a fucking convenience store.

1794
02:05:38,449 --> 02:05:41,618
A world without
those people in it...

1795
02:05:41,650 --> 02:05:44,120
sure smells like peace to me.

1796
02:05:44,887 --> 02:05:47,056
You break the law...

1797
02:05:47,091 --> 02:05:48,959
you pay the price.

1798
02:05:49,625 --> 02:05:51,660
Good riddance...

1799
02:05:51,694 --> 02:05:53,964
to all of them.

1800
02:05:58,701 --> 02:06:01,971
That's why I got
to destroy that case.

1801
02:06:02,004 --> 02:06:05,708
Now slide it over,
Agent Galahad.

1802
02:06:10,579 --> 02:06:12,181
Thank you.

1803
02:06:12,214 --> 02:06:14,183
Do you know what, Harry?

1804
02:06:14,217 --> 02:06:15,284
I think he's got a point.

1805
02:06:17,921 --> 02:06:21,225
I think it sounds
like a bright idea.

1806
02:08:37,961 --> 02:08:42,031
Put alpha gel on that, dickhead.

1807
02:08:51,940 --> 02:08:53,543
"Viva las vegan."

1808
02:08:55,744 --> 02:08:57,064
This one's for you, Merlin.

1809
02:09:11,662 --> 02:09:12,772
It's a day
of worldwide celebration

1810
02:09:12,796 --> 02:09:15,198
as millions rejoice...

1811
02:09:15,231 --> 02:09:18,602
after they or their loved ones
were saved from death.

1812
02:09:30,513 --> 02:09:33,192
Distribution of The
Golden Circle antidote continues...

1813
02:09:33,216 --> 02:09:35,118
and field hospitals
are emptying...

1814
02:09:35,151 --> 02:09:38,488
as victims return
to their homes tonight, cured.

1815
02:09:59,741 --> 02:10:01,977
Come on, Liam. Man, come on.

1816
02:10:02,012 --> 02:10:04,481
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1817
02:10:10,086 --> 02:10:11,722
I love you, man!
I love you!

1818
02:10:11,754 --> 02:10:13,990
I'm never touching
that shit again!

1819
02:10:17,293 --> 02:10:18,294
What happened?

1820
02:10:19,829 --> 02:10:22,065
Did I miss something?
You sure did.

1821
02:10:22,097 --> 02:10:26,202
From now on, Tequila,
I suggest you stick to booze.

1822
02:10:28,838 --> 02:10:30,407
The president
actively sanctioned

1823
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:33,677
the deaths of hundreds
of millions of people...

1824
02:10:34,543 --> 02:10:37,046
and lied to the public.

1825
02:10:37,079 --> 02:10:40,249
I am proud to be responsible
for his impeachment...

1826
02:10:40,283 --> 02:10:42,084
and I will do everything I can

1827
02:10:42,118 --> 02:10:44,588
to ensure a smooth
transition of power.

1828
02:10:45,588 --> 02:10:48,458
In honor
of this historic occasion,

1829
02:10:48,491 --> 02:10:49,927
we have purchased...

1830
02:10:50,961 --> 02:10:53,297
a distillery in Scotland.

1831
02:10:54,431 --> 02:10:55,598
This shows the world...

1832
02:10:55,632 --> 02:11:00,504
that Kingsman is now
joining the liquor business.

1833
02:11:01,137 --> 02:11:03,473
Before we were cousins.

1834
02:11:03,506 --> 02:11:07,910
Now we're brothers,
working side-by-side.

1835
02:11:07,944 --> 02:11:11,080
All our resources are now yours.

1836
02:11:11,114 --> 02:11:13,350
You can rebuild.

1837
02:11:13,382 --> 02:11:15,317
Yeah, y'all shittin'
in high cotton now.

1838
02:11:16,518 --> 02:11:18,888
Agent Tequila,
this is a formal occasion...

1839
02:11:18,922 --> 02:11:20,723
where's your tie and jacket?

1840
02:11:20,757 --> 02:11:21,891
Sorry, sir.

1841
02:11:21,924 --> 02:11:25,662
Maybe the Kingsman boys
can dress you properly.

1842
02:11:26,762 --> 02:11:28,332
To our union!

1843
02:11:29,399 --> 02:11:30,400
To our union!

1844
02:11:34,236 --> 02:11:36,239
Final order of business...

1845
02:11:37,039 --> 02:11:38,473
we would be honored

1846
02:11:38,507 --> 02:11:42,044
if one of you would be
our new Agent Whiskey.

1847
02:11:42,079 --> 02:11:46,950
Yeah, this two Galahad thing
is just fucking confusing.

1848
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:49,586
Well, I'm very honored...

1849
02:11:51,887 --> 02:11:53,089
Champ...

1850
02:11:54,891 --> 02:11:57,094
I'd like to throw
my hat in the ring.

1851
02:12:01,364 --> 02:12:02,432
All right!

1852
02:12:03,667 --> 02:12:05,002
Statesmen, the vote.

1853
02:12:08,003 --> 02:12:09,972
Looks like she's in.

1854
02:12:10,006 --> 02:12:11,307
Have a seat.

1855
02:12:15,845 --> 02:12:17,613
To Agent Whiskey!

1856
02:12:17,646 --> 02:12:18,781
Agent Whiskey!

1857
02:12:26,388 --> 02:12:27,457
Cheers!

1858
02:12:32,294 --> 02:12:34,698
Are you sure
I don't look like a dick?

1859
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:38,668
Look in the mirror.

1860
02:12:44,707 --> 02:12:46,075
What do you see?

1861
02:12:46,109 --> 02:12:49,611
Someone who can't believe
what the fuck is going on.

1862
02:12:50,914 --> 02:12:52,649
I see a man who is honorable...

1863
02:12:54,850 --> 02:12:56,119
brave...

1864
02:12:56,819 --> 02:12:58,488
loyal...

1865
02:12:58,521 --> 02:13:00,791
who's fulfilled
his huge potential.

1866
02:13:02,458 --> 02:13:04,828
A man who's done
something good with his life.

1867
02:13:06,128 --> 02:13:08,364
I owe you everything, Harry.

1868
02:13:09,632 --> 02:13:11,034
Thank you.

1869
02:13:11,066 --> 02:13:12,368
Don't mention it.

1870
02:13:13,636 --> 02:13:14,638
You ready?

1871
02:13:17,606 --> 02:13:19,542
Not a doubt in my mind.

1872
02:14:11,227 --> 02:14:14,129
As one of our
founding Kingsman once said...

1873
02:14:14,163 --> 02:14:16,132
this is not the end.

1874
02:14:16,165 --> 02:14:19,302
It is not even the beginning
of the end.

1875
02:14:19,334 --> 02:14:23,806
But it is, perhaps,
the end of the beginning.

1876
02:14:24,574 --> 02:14:25,842
Yeah!
