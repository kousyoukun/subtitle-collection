00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:42,821
Charles, do you think
your buddy here

155
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:44,355
is worthy of joining us?

156
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:45,956
Ms. Poppy, I would
not have brought him

157
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,601
all the way to see you
if I didn't think so.

158
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,560
Excellent.
Well, you hungry?

159
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,762
Starving.

160
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,165
Wonderful! Right this way.

I have a couple of things
that I wanna clarify.

00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,543
You understand that
in The Golden Circle...

165
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:09,047
my authority is never
to be questioned, right?

166
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,849
And the importance
of following orders?

167
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:13,017
Do you understand that?

168
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,119
And the value of loyalty?

169
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:18,122
It's easy to nod, isn't it?

170
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:23,528
I don't like easy.
I like proof.

about table manners.

00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,909
Well, as it happens, babe,
I've got this shit on lock.

202
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:53,277
I know what every single one

of them knives
and forks is for.

204

This is a butter knife.

It's the only one
you need to remember,

206
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:02,325
the rest of
the cutlery is easy.

207
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:03,455
You start from the outside,

208
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:05,691
and you work your way in
with each course.

209

And never let anyone
describe you as "H.K.L.P."...

00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,329
"Holds knife like pen."

212
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:12,596
A habit erroneously believed

213
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,698
to be upper class
dining etiquette.

214
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,601
It is quite the opposite.

215
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:23,375
White wine, pudding wine,
red wine, water and pop.

Or whatever tipple
takes your fancy.

217

with Charlie.

was Charlie Hesketh.

Charlie had a security implant
in his neck.

Unfortunately, Galahad,

When you electrocuted him,
you damaged his implant.

Instead of
his head exploding...

256
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,428
he only lost an arm
and his vocal chords.

We don't think so, sir.

Teeth filed smooth.
