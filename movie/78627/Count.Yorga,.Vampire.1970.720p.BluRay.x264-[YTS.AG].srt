1
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:44,583
<i>A vampire, in ancient belief,
was a malignant spirit</i>

2
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,589
<i>who, when the Earth lost its sunlight,</i>

3
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,468
<i>rose nightly from its dark grave</i>

4
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,344
<i>to suck blood from the throats
of the living.</i>

5
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,814
<i>Its powers were many.</i>

6
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,809
<i>It could see in the dark,</i>

7
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,837
<i>which was no small ability</i>

8
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,736
<i>in a world half-veiled from light.</i>

9
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,657
<i>Its hypnotic skills
baffled the domain of science.</i>

10
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,995
<i>It was of a cunning more than mortal,</i>

11
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,620
<i>for its cunning was the growth of ages.</i>

12
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,216
<i>Since it could not die
by the mere passing of time,</i>

13
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,486
<i>it had to have been by a wooden stake</i>

14
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,135
<i>driven deep into its heart,</i>

15
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,930
<i>or exposure to the rays of the sun,</i>

16
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,039
<i>which would instantly decompose its body</i>

17
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,939
<i>into a miasma of putrid decay.</i>

18
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,773
<i>The believers of this superstition</i>

19
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:56,825
<i>referred to vampires as the "living dead."</i>

20
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,830
<i>I seem to be making use of the past tense.</i>

21
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,871
<i>Perhaps the present would be more precise.</i>

22
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,923
<i>For it stands to reason
that if one is superstitious,</i>

23
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:15,882
<i>even on a small,
seemingly insignificant level,</i>

24
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:21,516
<i>one must be vulnerable
to all superstitions.</i>

25
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:27,351
<i>Conceivably, even those of vampires.</i>

26
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,074
Our hands are joined.

27
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:43,038
Hopefully, we will now
be able to act as one body, one soul.

28
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,269
Generating, through touching flesh,
the power to accomplish the task

29
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,996
upon which we are all agreed.

30
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,440
It has not been mere chance

31
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,318
that has brought us here
together this evening.

32
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,779
For there are unknown elements
surrounding our beings

33
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,428
that would stagger
a child's vast dreamworld.

34
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,742
Elements that, perhaps once known,

35
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,891
might horrify even the scientist's
endless imagination.

36
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,500
But my purpose is to assist you
in keeping an open mind.

37
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,460
To clear away the dark mist of falsity

38
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,860
so that you can more easily
accept an unshrouded truth.

39
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,552
A total truth, that has since the beginning
of time, agonizingly cried out,

40
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,906
"Everything, every conceivable imagining,
is possible."

41
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,267
When you believe this fact,
you then help me bring to this table

42
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,792
the living spirit of our dear Donna's
deceased mother.

43
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,003
For those of you who doubt, relax.

44
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,794
Accept and try not to question.

45
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,614
Relax completely, permitting the total
resources of the mind and spirit

46
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,341
to open with unguarded trust.

47
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,161
Relax.

48
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,040
- Come on, Paul, knock it off.
- That's terrible.

49
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,250
Okay, I'm sorry.

50
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,543
That's terrible, Paul.

51
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,044
Be serious, will you?

52
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,863
Okay, all right, no more fooling around.

53
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,320
Please, close your eyes.

54
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,410
Spirit!

55
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,616
Spirit, we humble our mortal selves.

56
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,121
We fear, yet trust your use
of the powers at your command.

57
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,106
Trust us, as we do you.

58
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,335
Heed our voices as we ask
comfort for your daughter.

59
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,637
A comfort only you can bring at this time.

60
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,303
If you are there, let it be known.

61
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,219
Give us knowledge of your presence.

62
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,977
Allow the warmth of your living spirit
to engulf us.

63
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,267
Are you there? Show us.

64
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,610
Permit us to experience an intimacy
only few dare to consider.

65
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,444
Show us!

66
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,327
Oh, no.

67
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,560
Count, I'm so sorry.

68
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,603
Oh, Donna!

69
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,522
I'm so embarrassed. Please forgive me.

70
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,899
- Don't worry about it.
- What's the matter with you?

71
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,342
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,155
Donna, do you care to continue?

73
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,698
Yes, I do.

74
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,847
Come on, everybody,
please try to take this seriously.

75
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,514
It doesn't make any sense,
it's getting farcical.

76
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,750
With all due respects to you, Count Yorga,
I can't keep a straight face.

77
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,478
Well, Michael, try,
it's important to Donna.

78
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,463
I must have everyone's willingness.

79
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,591
Well, I'm willing to try, but I have
a friend here who keeps breaking me up.

80
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,593
What do you mean me?
You're the one that's fooling around.

81
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,366
Oh, please.

82
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,245
Oh, I'm the heavy now, is that it?

83
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,914
Okay, Count, all right, I'll try.

84
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,271
- Well, I love it.
- Me, too.

85
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,522
So do I.

86
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,232
Then please,

87
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,212
for Donna's sake and with your permission,
let us all try again.

88
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,138
Thank you.

89
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,804
Place your hands together.

90
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,943
Now, close your eyes
and attempt an inner sensation of space.

91
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,212
A space filled with the living spirit
of Donna's mother,

92
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,236
who waits only
for the security of our trust.

93
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,011
She asks only that we
believe in her existence.

94
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,079
For to believe is the answer.

95
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,744
To believe sets us apart from all.

96
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,994
Do you all believe?

97
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,605
Do you believe?

98
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,922
I believe.

99
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,924
Do you all believe?

100
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,923
I believe.

101
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,213
Then concentrate.

102
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,802
Concentrate more deeply than
you ever thought possible.

103
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,558
Concentrate.

104
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,645
Spirit, we know you are there.

105
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,048
We know somewhere in the massive energies

106
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:47,281
encircling our lives,
the soft wind of your being is near.

107
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,949
Near enough to brush against our bodies,
sweetly caressing our memories.

108
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,329
We are waiting.

109
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,338
Give our lives meaning.

110
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,297
Enrich our existence by helping us to grasp
some semblance of your eternal spirit.

111
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,471
Help us to know you are near.

112
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,265
Are you here?

113
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,402
Are you here in this room?

114
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,972
Jesus.

115
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,648
Contact has obviously been made.

116
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,692
Please continue concentrating.

117
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,319
Relax and concentrate.

118
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,568
Donna?

119
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,536
Mother.

120
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,164
Mother, I miss you.

121
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,617
I miss you terribly.

122
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,203
If you're here, please stay.

123
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,231
Please let me know you'll never leave me.

124
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,273
Donna.

125
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,400
Quiet.

126
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,111
I need you. Please.

127
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,212
Please.

128
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,155
I don't like being alone.

129
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,949
- Tell her.
- I miss you.

130
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,892
Tell your mourning daughter
you are with her.

131
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,203
That you will be with her for always.

132
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,247
- I want to see you.
- You can't desert your child.

133
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,581
I want to see you.

134
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,583
- If you care.
- Mother!

135
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,129
- If you still love, show yourself!
- That's enough.

136
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,547
I said, that's enough!

137
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,923
Your daughter demands it.

138
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:07,966
Mother, please.

139
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,067
I demand it.

140
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,977
Peter, get the lights.

141
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,795
Right.

142
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,522
No!

143
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,692
- Is she going to be all right?
- Get the goddamn lights!

144
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,294
No!

145
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,879
Find the fuse box!

146
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,674
You're all right now.

147
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,536
There's nothing to be frightened of.

148
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,058
Shouldn't we call a doctor?

149
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,706
Yes!

150
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,355
Please, I can help her.

151
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,738
You keep away from her.
The doctor will take care of it.

152
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,900
There won't be any doctor.
The phone is dead.

153
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,777
Do you really know what you're doing?

154
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,237
Yes.

155
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,847
If you cause her any more...

156
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,325
Michael! Excuse us.

157
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,961
Will she be all right?

158
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,254
Yes.

159
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,336
Please, may I have a candle?

160
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,096
Donna, this is Count Yorga.

161
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,933
I want you to relax.

162
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,565
There is nothing to be upset about.

163
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,061
You are safe from everything.

164
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,657
Listen to the sound of my voice
as you concentrate on this flame.

165
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,321
Keep your eyes on the flame.

166
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,241
Watch it as it flows seeping
into darkness.

167
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:43,458
As you watch, you are beginning to feel
a deep sense of soft comfort.

168
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,464
You are now at peace.

169
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,302
There is nothing to fear. Nothing.

170
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,974
You are safe, safe as long as
you listen to all that I say.

171
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,769
You will forget everything you saw
during the séance.

172
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,185
It will be wiped from your memory forever.

173
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,312
<i>You will do everything I say</i>

174
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,450
<i>whenever and from wherever I say it.</i>

175
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,117
<i>You will do everything I say</i>

176
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:22,076
<i>whenever and from wherever I say it.</i>

177
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,230
When my two hands touch your forehead,
you will awaken,

178
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,924
free of mind and completely relaxed,

179
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,803
having forgotten the total
experience of this séance.

180
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,208
What took you so long?
Where's the fuse box?

181
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,527
I don't know, I never found it.

182
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,550
What are you all staring at me for?

183
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,094
I tell you, you sure got shaken
for a while there.

184
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,346
- Yes, sir.
- Why? What happened?

185
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,473
- You mean you really don't remember?
- No.

186
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,291
Erica, get her some brandy.

187
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,937
Oh, so here you are.

188
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,440
That was an absolutely
smashing job, Count.

189
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,608
Thank you.

190
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,443
Would you care for some brandy?

191
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,760
No, no thank you.

192
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,488
You know, you're really not
a very good dinner guest.

193
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,032
You haven't touched a parcel of food,

194
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,201
and you haven't had
anything to drink all night.

195
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:25,705
Well, it's not very attractive to complain
of a troubled stomach, but I'm afraid I must.

196
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,041
Perhaps I'll have a little snack later on.

197
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,735
- Erica?
- Right, right. I'm going.

198
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,887
My friend, tell me what happened.

199
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,182
Try not to think of it now,
I'll call you tomorrow and explain.

200
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,725
And thank you for a lovely party.

201
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,976
Oh, are you leaving?

202
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,436
Yes, I'm afraid I must.

203
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,939
Ah, well, maybe you can come by
for breakfast tomorrow.

204
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,315
We could talk then.

205
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,901
I wish I could,
but I'm afraid it's impossible.

206
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,319
I believe I brought a cape.

207
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,171
I'll get it for you.

208
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,830
- Join the crowd.
- Perhaps some other time.

209
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,228
- Oh, you're not leaving?
- Yes.

210
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,064
Do you have a ride?

211
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,464
This is very kind of you.

212
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,259
I hope you don't mind
this sort of transportation.

213
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,702
No, no, not at all.

214
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,904
I'm glad.

215
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,089
Well, I was scared.

216
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,091
Won't anyone tell me what happened?

217
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,243
First, you get a good night's rest.

218
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,703
I feel fine.

219
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,579
Uh, we'll talk about it tomorrow.

220
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,581
I'll tell you all about it then, okay?

221
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,682
Ow!

222
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,817
Have you two set a date?

223
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,878
February 17.

224
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,922
That's only four weeks away.
Congratulations.

225
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,023
Yeah.

226
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,179
Who is that Count anyway?

227
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,156
He is something, he is.

228
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,327
Donna?

229
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,381
Oh, I'm sorry.

230
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,421
You all right?

231
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,486
- I'm fine.
- You're sure?

232
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,135
Yes. Can't I daydream?

233
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,991
Honey, who is Count Yorga?

234
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,784
He was my mother's boyfriend.

235
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,244
How come I never met him before?

236
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,689
'Cause she only knew him
for three weeks before she died.

237
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,274
Excuse me.

238
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,561
Wait a minute. Of course you met him.

239
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,438
Last week, at my mother's funeral.

240
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,024
I don't remember seeing him there.
Do you, Peter?

241
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,868
No, and how do you forget
a character like that?

242
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,657
You must have.

243
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,203
You know, you're right.

244
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,207
He wasn't there.
I don't remember seeing him either.

245
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,208
How come?

246
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,591
Was he a good friend?

247
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,942
They were lovers.

248
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,761
In fact, he was the one
who talked me out of cremation.

249
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,322
Cremation?

250
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,949
- You were going to cremate your mother?
- Yes.

251
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,576
The Count was so emotionally involved,

252
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,146
that I did what he asked
and gave her a regular burial.

253
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,890
That's odd.

254
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,226
Why wasn't he there?

255
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,335
Do not be alarmed.

256
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,692
Good evening, Brudah.

257
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,619
Good evening.

258
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,123
You may drive on now.

259
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,117
Is that your wife?

260
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,594
No.

261
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,262
Oh.

262
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,414
Would you care to come in for a drink?

263
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,606
- Yes.
- No.

264
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,085
Please. We have lots of time, we can talk.

265
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,923
Oh, please, Paul.
This house is super, I'd love to see it.

266
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,966
I said, no, not tonight.

267
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,885
- Perhaps some other time.
- Right.

268
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,408
Then good night and thank you
for the ride.

269
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,935
Good night.

270
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,254
Delighted to have met you.

271
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,877
It was my pleasure.

272
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,445
Drive carefully.

273
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,799
The old hill road to the gate is narrow
and can be treacherous.

274
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,393
Are we stuck?

275
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,795
I'd say that, yes.

276
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,523
- Can we get out?
- I don't know that yet.

277
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,068
Paul?

278
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,804
Why didn't you accept
the Counts offer for a drink?

279
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,076
You know, it might have been fun.

280
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,246
You're kidding?

281
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,546
Erica, my love, I adore you.

282
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,775
One of these days,
I may even let you marry me.

283
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,152
But at this particular moment,
we're stuck in a mire of mud,

284
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,571
and I'd like to get the hell out of it,

285
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,426
so please spare me the questions
pertaining to social handicaps.

286
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,786
I do have one suggestion for you, however.

287
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,831
You might get your fat ass out of the car
and see if you can't be of some help.

288
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,374
It is not a fat ass!

289
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,209
Is, too. It's huge.

290
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,686
It is not!

291
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,883
Paul, don't you ever do that to me again.

292
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,010
Aw.

293
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,612
No, it's not funny.

294
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,197
I love you.

295
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,367
I don't love you, you're mean.

296
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,670
Okay, your ass isn't huge.

297
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,668
You're damn right it's not.

298
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,568
Did you hear that?

299
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,508
Paul?

300
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,076
Did you hear those wolves?

301
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,615
They're not wolves.

302
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,989
They are, too.

303
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,581
All right, they're wolves.

304
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,767
Erica, start it up
and ease it forward a little.

305
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,310
And don't race it!

306
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,313
Paul, let's go back to the Counts
and ask if we can stay the night.

307
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,007
Erica, will you please do what I ask?

308
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,182
Hold it! Hold it!

309
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,986
I don't like it here.

310
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,154
Erica?

311
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,868
Yeah?

312
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,262
Honey, it didn't rain
here tonight, did it?

313
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,224
No, there was a lot of thunder
and stuff like that,

314
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,600
but no rain. Why?

315
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,727
This is a narrow road, right?

316
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,919
Yeah.

317
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,523
When we drove over this road
a few minutes ago with the Count,

318
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,671
and I didn't see any water or mud.

319
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,195
On a road this narrow,
we couldn't have missed it.

320
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,697
So?

321
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,867
So, look at the rest of the road.

322
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,766
Not a sign of water anywhere,
just this one spot.

323
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,189
One huge, muddy spot.

324
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,440
A bicycle couldn't have
missed this mud, yet we did.

325
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,191
Just a few minutes ago,

326
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,073
if it was here just a few minutes ago.

327
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,662
Now I'm scared. I was fine
until you opened your big mouth.

328
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:05,833
I'm sorry, baby, but it is curious.

329
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:10,771
Well, come on, we'll go on and spend
the rest of the night with the Count.

330
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,022
Oh!

331
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:15,109
Screw you, love. I'm not leaving this car.

332
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,031
Then I'd like to strongly suggest

333
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,869
we take immediate advantage
of this ghoulish situation.

334
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,335
What's the matter, Paul?

335
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,728
Paul, what's wrong?

336
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,599
I don't... Look outside
and see if you see anything.

337
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,279
Nothing. I didn't see anything.

338
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,062
Are we all right, Paul?

339
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,539
Yeah, we're fine, honey.

340
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,340
Come on, let's try and get some sleep now.

341
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,464
You're kidding?

342
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,466
Try, will you. Hmm?

343
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,744
Erica doesn't remember
anything about last night?

344
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,458
Not a thing.

345
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,456
Then she must be in shock.

346
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,276
I don't know, she called me
a little while ago and said she felt dizzy,

347
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,028
and was going to see Dr. Hayes.

348
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,675
So, I guess we'll find out something.

349
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,140
Tell me about the mud again.

350
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,100
There's no more to tell.

351
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,744
When we woke up this morning, it was gone.

352
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,938
It was as though there never was any mud.

353
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:02,915
Maybe the sun dried it up.

354
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,234
No. Impossible. There was much too much.

355
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,920
Neither of you saw who did it?

356
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,070
No. He rocked my head so fast
I thought it was going to break off.

357
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,367
And Erica just doesn't remember.

358
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,371
It sounds to me like
it'd be the big guy at the gate.

359
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,224
Who knows? It could've been him,
it could've been the Count.

360
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,747
All I know is his grip
was like a steel vise.

361
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,687
One interesting thing, though...

362
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,291
When we went back to the mansion this
morning to ask Brudah to open the gate,

363
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,468
he said the Count had left for the day.

364
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,070
So?

365
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,696
So, we were stuck
in the middle of his driveway.

366
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,532
How did he get out? Fly over us?

367
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,450
Maybe he doesn't have a car.

368
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,785
You had to drive him home last night.

369
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,371
All right, fine, but he still had to
pass my car to leave this morning.

370
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,832
Why wouldn't he have awakened us,
offered help?

371
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,650
He could have a rear exit to the house.

372
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,947
I don't know, Mike.
So help me, I just don't know.

373
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,384
You've lost an unusual amount of blood.

374
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,532
That's obviously the reason
for your dizziness.

375
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,198
When you get home,
I want you to stuff yourself with steaks.

376
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,283
Steaks.

377
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,086
And I want you to eat them
as rare as possible.

378
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,289
That goes for the next few days.

379
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,009
- Yes.
- What?

380
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,212
I said yes.

381
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,882
You been getting enough sleep?

382
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,426
- Yes.
- You don't look it. Better get some more.

383
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,329
You know, we came close
to giving you a transfusion.

384
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,415
There doesn't seem to be
any internal hemorrhaging,

385
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,940
so, it must be those puncture marks
on your throat.

386
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,818
I wish you could remember
where you got them.

387
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,371
A bad joke would be that your boyfriend
was a bit overzealous in his passion.

388
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,032
Let me see them again.

389
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,247
Absolutely fascinating.
Never seen anything like it.

390
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,342
Are you sure you didn't
fall against anything?

391
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,219
I don't know.

392
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,467
No, of course you don't.

393
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,391
Otherwise you would have told me.

394
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:06,397
Well, regardless, that shot I gave you
will take care of any potential infection.

395
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,900
<i>Docteur.</i>

396
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,978
Oh, yes. Thank you.

397
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,192
Babette?

398
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,906
Uh, I told you
it's not necessary to curtsy.

399
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,471
<i>Merci, le Docteur.</i>

400
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,743
<i>Merci.</i>

401
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,377
Uh, she doesn't speak English very well.

402
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,497
She's very efficient.

403
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,421
Let's see what the report has to say.

404
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:41,883
Now, Dr. Schteingart
wants to run some further tests.

405
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,161
It seems he's found some
unfamiliar sediments in your blood system.

406
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,310
Now, it's not leukemia or anything
like that, so don't worry.

407
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,071
Look, you go on home and get some sleep.

408
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,298
And most of all, don't worry.

409
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,492
And don't forget to eat those steaks.

410
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,283
How's Donna?

411
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,683
She's beat. I wanted to see her today,

412
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,126
but she begged off.

413
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,752
She just wanted to sleep.

414
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,331
Did she remember the seance last night?

415
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,212
She still doesn't remember what she saw.

416
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,760
You know what's weird?

417
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,237
I don't know that much about it,

418
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,967
but have you ever seen
a hysterical person being hypnotized?

419
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,097
I thought the same thing.

420
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,686
As far as I know, they're supposed to be

421
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,539
conditioned, relaxed
and, most of all, willing.

422
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,251
Right, yet, this Count Yorga,
or whatever the hell his name is,

423
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:36,649
was able to do it
with Donna screaming her head off,

424
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,839
and she did everything
he suggested to her.

425
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,590
He told her to calm down, she calmed down,

426
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,863
he told her to forget everything,
she forgot everything.

427
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,196
- You know what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.

428
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,056
The two girls have something in common.

429
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,124
Hysteria, loss of memory
and maybe the Count.

430
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,838
She says she's fine, but still sleepy.

431
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,173
You can't get mad at that.

432
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,590
<i>Erica?</i>

433
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,988
<i>Erica, is that you? Are you there?</i>

434
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,427
What's the matter?

435
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,904
Erica, are you all right?

436
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,245
<i>Erica, please, if you're there answer me.</i>

437
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,939
- Come on.
- What's wrong?

438
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,383
All I know is I want
to get over there, fast.

439
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,122
Erica!

440
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,774
Michael, get Dr. Hayes
over here right away.

441
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:21,921
Right.

442
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,839
Don't come near me.

443
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,932
I said, don't come near me!

444
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,829
This is Mike Thompson. Yes.

445
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,415
You've got to get over to
Erica Landers' immediately.

446
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,918
No, I can't explain. It's an emergency.
Please hurry.

447
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,112
- Okay.
- Erica.

448
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,778
Paul.

449
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,163
Paul.

450
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,406
No.

451
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,632
No, don't...

452
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,180
No.

453
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,353
Oh. Oh.

454
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,222
Oh.

455
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,524
Paul...

456
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,655
Oh.

457
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,386
She's lost much too much blood.

458
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,160
We're incredible lucky
your blood factors were compatible.

459
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,001
Please don't hate me, Paul.

460
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,414
Oh, God, I'm so ashamed.

461
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,941
Please don't hate me.

462
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,543
Nobody hates you, baby.

463
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,216
- Jim, can't you knock her out completely?
- No.

464
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,757
Not until the transfusion is over.

465
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,075
Besides, I want to hear
what she might have to say.

466
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,203
- Here's a washcloth.
- Put it on her forehead.

467
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,349
Paul.

468
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:02,522
Paul, I love you.

469
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,354
I love you.

470
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,314
No.

471
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:12,532
No! Oh, don't let it happen.

472
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,472
My God, I don't want it to happen.

473
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,620
Please, I'm so afraid.

474
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,710
Of what, Erica? What are you afraid of?

475
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,396
I...

476
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,839
I can't remember.

477
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,794
I want to, but I... I just can't remember.

478
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,030
Does it have anything to do
with the marks on your throat?

479
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,823
Oh, no. Oh, oh.

480
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,767
Erica, does it have anything to do
with those marks on your throat?

481
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,290
Let me die.
Oh, please, God, just let me die.

482
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,188
Let her alone, please.

483
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,226
Well, she looks a lot better.

484
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,876
Take it easy, that's your third drink.
You gave a lot of blood today.

485
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,070
Yeah, I know, but I feel like a drink.

486
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,815
What was the purpose
of making Erica vomit?

487
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,077
How'd you like to wake up knowing
you had parts of a cat inside your stomach?

488
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,029
Cheers.

489
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,531
Yeah.

490
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,412
I wish you guys knew more
about this... Count Yorga.

491
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,793
Donna says he's from Bulgaria.

492
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,217
- Bulgaria?
- Yes.

493
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,087
Well, it fits.

494
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,199
I'm gonna tell you two guys something.
I want you to keep it to yourselves.

495
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,972
Don't tell the girls.

496
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:09,769
A colleague of mine, Dr. Schteingart,
ran a blood test on Erica this afternoon.

497
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,436
Now, he admits that his findings
are pure conjecture,

498
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,839
but what I told him
about the marks on her throat,

499
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,612
it made him feel all the more certain.

500
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,110
Of what?

501
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:27,115
Oh, I wish he was here with us,
but he left for Europe for two months.

502
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,459
Jim, what are you trying to say?

503
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,749
Well, he feels that Erica was bitten...

504
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,922
By a vampire.

505
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,478
A vampire?

506
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,644
You mean a...

507
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:57,712
Well, he... he told me
not to discount the possibilities.

508
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,655
Oh, come on, Jim.

509
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:01,900
On what grounds?

510
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:07,180
Well, I don't know. Instinct, theory,
what dictates to most great minds?

511
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,015
Well, I mean, the guy's obviously a nut.

512
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,893
Yeah, well, this nut happens to be one
of the top blood specialists in the world.

513
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,728
I'm not about to disregard his opinion.

514
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,063
Well, fine, marvelous,

515
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:18,024
but, I mean, I think he's asking you
to swallow quite a bit, don't you?

516
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,671
I'm not arguing with you,

517
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:24,013
but can you prove
that vampires don't exist?

518
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:28,743
Can you say unequivocally,
that all those stories we read as children

519
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,412
were merely superstitious horror tales
and not fact?

520
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,039
Oh, Dr. Hayes.

521
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,124
Don't "doctor" me. It's never been proven.

522
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,376
Yes, but...

523
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:39,025
Michael, it has never been proven!

524
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,045
Cheers.

525
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,455
Now, what you're saying
is that Count Yorga

526
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:18,151
is responsible for Erica's condition,
and he's a vampire?

527
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,880
No, I'm saying it's possible.

528
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,383
Well, I refuse to believe it.
I can't accept that vampires exist today.

529
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,011
Today! Then you concede
they could have at one time?

530
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,387
No, that's not what I'm saying.

531
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,390
I'm saying I'll never accept
that they ever existed, except in fiction.

532
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,019
Well, all right, let's call the police in
and have them investigate.

533
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,293
They'd laugh at you.
Besides, it's premature.

534
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,085
We have to find out a lot more
before we can draw any conclusions.

535
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:48,364
Schteingart dug up some antiquated
volumes on the folklore of vampires.

536
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,075
I'll read them and see
what I can find out.

537
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,849
Then, I think I'd like to meet
this Count Yorga.

538
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,730
You're not really convinced, are you?

539
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,207
Michael, of course not.
Nothing's been proven so far,

540
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,501
so, how can I speak with any conviction?

541
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,879
I'll tell you one thing,
I'm willing to be convinced.

542
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,858
If there's this much threat of danger,
I am willing.

543
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,284
Don't shut yourself off, Mike.

544
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:10,887
- Thanks for the drinks, Paul.
- Thank you, Jim.

545
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,057
Listen, I gave her enough to keep her
sleeping peacefully for the rest of the night,

546
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,808
but I think you should stay here.

547
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:19,333
Keep awake. And if anything happens,
anything at all, you call me.

548
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:24,108
Listen, Jim, if there is anything
to this vampire business,

549
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,755
what happens to people who get bitten?

550
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,551
We'll talk about that in the morning.

551
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,065
Erica, my darling,

552
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,116
I've come to offer you eternal love.

553
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,402
To keep you with me forever.

554
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,993
Outlasting centuries.

555
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,785
Magnificence beyond existence.

556
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,255
This, I now give to you.

557
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,008
He said he looked all over for her
but couldn't find her anywhere.

558
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,344
So he's on his way to the Count's mansion.

559
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:44,595
Yes, alone.

560
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,846
Oh, that idiot.

561
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,808
If that Count is what I think he is,
Paul is as good as dead.

562
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,519
Look, how soon can you get over here?

563
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,838
It's 3:30 now.

564
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,277
All right, listen to this.
1313 Garden Avenue.

565
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,720
You know where that is?

566
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,472
All right. And bring Donna with you.

567
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,804
Because, my friend, she's safer with us
than she is being left alone.

568
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,772
Well, shouldn't we call the police?

569
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,141
I told you, calling the police is useless.

570
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,520
Okay, see you there as soon as I can.

571
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,448
I'm sorry, Cleo, my love. I gotta go.

572
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,891
That doesn't sound
like a house call to me.

573
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:31,976
Hmm.

574
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:35,546
Well, it doesn't sound
like a house call... To me.

575
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,341
Well, my dear, it is,
and then again it isn't.

576
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,424
Well then, what's the rush?

577
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,325
Cleo, my love,
you are an intelligent girl.

578
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,426
Do you agree?

579
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,766
Yeah.

580
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,523
All right, let's say
that you were the police.

581
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:56,684
Uh-huh.

582
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:01,982
I call up and I said that there was
a vampire loose in this city.

583
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,867
- Would you believe me?
- Sure.

584
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,744
Yeah, you would.

585
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,432
Sure, you want to know why?

586
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,683
No.

587
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,103
Because I read in yesterday's paper

588
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,924
where they found a little tiny baby
dead in the swamps.

589
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,427
All drained of blood and white as a ghost.

590
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,214
- What?
- Yeah!

591
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:27,719
Isn't it awful?

592
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,927
It said the baby's neck was all chewed up.

593
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,643
And if ever the police
believed in vampires...

594
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,265
Ooh.

595
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,746
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. You better go home.

596
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,310
Will you be long?

597
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,754
Yes. Operator, give me the police.

598
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,584
Sergeant? This is Dr. James Hayes.

599
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,153
I think I know who killed that baby
who was found in the swamps,

600
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,988
the one that was drained of blood.

601
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:12,764
I have... Hayes! H-A-Y-E-S!

602
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,933
I've excellent reason to believe
that there is a vampire loose...

603
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,560
Sergeant I...

604
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,986
But I think I can prove it.

605
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:24,897
Sergeant!

606
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,156
What did he say?

607
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,288
I am the 47th nut

608
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,687
who has reported a vampire
in the last 14 hours

609
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:44,463
and I should be ashamed of myself for
having such a sick, morbid sense of humor.

610
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,300
Oh.

611
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,178
Yorga!

612
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:09,747
Brudah,

613
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,833
you can expect more guests.

614
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,921
All right, let me do most of the talking.

615
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,160
Michael, if either one of us gets a chance
to go look for Paul and Erica, do it.

616
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,747
Just remember, the important thing is,
no matter how we have to do it,

617
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,124
what excuses we have to make,

618
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:14,604
the important thing is to keep him up
and awake until the sun rises.

619
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,023
Donna.

620
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,718
What a charming surprise.

621
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,303
- How are you? How do you feel?
- Fine, thank you.

622
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,888
You remember Michael?

623
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,036
Of course. Michael.

624
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,476
And this is Dr. James Hayes.

625
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,894
Count Yorga.

626
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:31,995
How do you do?

627
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,624
It's a pleasure, Doctor.

628
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,046
May we come in?

629
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,423
Of course, forgive me.

630
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:43,553
It's such a surprise seeing someone
at your door at this late hour. Please.

631
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:47,786
Doctor?

632
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,138
Thank you.

633
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,107
Doctor.

634
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,954
We were afraid
you might have been sleeping.

635
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,039
No, no, not at all.

636
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,960
- What keeps you up so late?
- What keeps you up so late?

637
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,800
But first, please, sit down.

638
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,972
Now, if you're comfortable,
what can I do for you?

639
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:36,610
Certainly a visit at this late hour indicates
something more than a social call.

640
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,774
Count Yorga, did Paul and Erica
drop by here this evening?

641
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,402
Paul and Erica?

642
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,950
They were at the séance last night.

643
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,224
Yes, yes the charming couple
who drove me home. No.

644
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,059
Why? Did they say they were coming?

645
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,144
Uh, Paul said he might drop by.

646
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,772
It seems that Erica's
disappeared and, uh...

647
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,920
He thought she might come here.

648
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,591
But why would she come by here?

649
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,391
Well, it seems that she
was quite taken with you.

650
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,287
That's very flattering.
No, I'm afraid I've seen neither one of them.

651
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,580
I do hope you find them.

652
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,082
I'm sure we will.

653
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,793
They're probably together right now
and making fools out of all of us

654
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,019
for being so concerned.

655
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,990
If I may ask, Doctor,
what have you to do with all of this?

656
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,027
Jim's been a friend of ours for years.

657
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,617
Yes?

658
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:34,043
Good. What field of medicine
do you practice, Doctor?

659
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,712
Well, actually, I don't have
a practice as such. I...

660
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,254
I'm in research. I'm a blood specialist.

661
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,044
Are you?

662
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,548
That must be fascinating work.

663
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,892
Yes. Yes, it is.

664
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,272
It's a very beautiful home you have here.

665
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,667
Thank you.

666
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,627
Could we have a look around?

667
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,698
Of course, but some other time.
It's much too late.

668
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,776
One could probably get lost.
How many rooms do you have?

669
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,971
I must confess,
I haven't the slightest idea.

670
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,472
I've only been here a short while.

671
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,449
Oh? From where?

672
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,644
A small village in Bulgaria.

673
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,417
Well, your English is excellent.

674
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,457
Yes, isn't it?

675
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,352
They told me you conducted
a very impressive séance last night.

676
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,099
Thank you. Yes.

677
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,231
Are you a student of the mystic arts?

678
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,061
Excuse me.

679
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,283
Washroom. I'd like to splash
some water on my face.

680
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,071
But you don't know the way.

681
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:53,618
I'm sure I can find it.

682
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,495
Brudah will show you.

683
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,792
Please, don't bother.
Just tell me where it is.

684
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,006
It's no bother.

685
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,796
Brudah.

686
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,147
Now, where were we?

687
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,485
You said you were involved
in the mystic arts.

688
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,563
Did I?

689
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,733
I recall your having asked,
I don't remember having answered.

690
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,069
But you're quite right, of course. I am.

691
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,197
You would find it very interesting.

692
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,641
Yes, I'm sure I would.

693
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:41,621
Now, have your studies been extensive,
or is this just a hobby?

694
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:46,550
A true hobby, Dr. Hayes,
is probably the most intense study of all.

695
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,920
Yes, I suppose you're right.

696
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,516
What about all these Voodoo rituals
and things like that?

697
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,873
Forgive me,
but the question is rather vague.

698
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,192
If you mean, do I believe? Yes.

699
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,363
Excuse me, Doctor,
could you tell me the time?

700
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:13,035
Yes, it's 4:30.
The sun should be rising soon.

701
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,195
Yes.

702
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,292
Do you mind if I take a look at the view?

703
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,578
Please.

704
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:25,872
Excuse me.

705
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,506
Donna, why so quiet?

706
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,220
Just thinking.

707
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,137
They must be very sad thoughts.

708
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,394
You're much too tense.

709
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,193
Relax.

710
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,950
That's better.

711
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:58,913
Simply relax.

712
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,373
You mustn't think about your friends.

713
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,420
I'm sure they're fine.

714
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,714
<i>When I call, you will come.</i>

715
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,638
View's lovely.

716
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,476
Yes, isn't it? Ah, Michael,
you're with us again.

717
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,836
Gentlemen, it's very late.

718
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,274
Your Donna is tired, and I must confess
my age has the better of me.

719
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:37,118
Could we have just one more drink
before we go?

720
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,074
The brandy is excellent.

721
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,725
Of course.

722
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:44,826
Thank you.

723
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:48,546
Michael, what time is it?

724
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,879
4:35.

725
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:56,221
Count Yorga, what about werewolves?

726
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:00,050
Do you think they existed?
I mean, in the literal sense.

727
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:05,747
In your part of the world, that is
a difficult question to answer truthfully.

728
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:09,209
Then what you're saying is,
you do believe in werewolves.

729
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:10,310
Yes.

730
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,519
Brandy?

731
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,521
No. No, thank you.

732
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,566
Do you drink at all?

733
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,234
No.

734
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:25,535
Well, do you believe they existed
at some time or that they still exist?

735
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,625
They exist, now.

736
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,374
Have you ever seen one?

737
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,338
Yes.

738
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,069
Really?

739
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:38,321
Yes. Gentlemen, it's very late.

740
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,640
I don't wish to be rude,
but I must retire.

741
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,076
If you are genuinely
interested in the occult,

742
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,911
I shall be most happy
to answer any of your questions

743
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,809
here in my house tomorrow evening.

744
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,416
Please forgive me my awkwardness.
I don't mean to be,

745
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,690
but I'm still clumsy at entertaining guests
in the style of your country.

746
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,034
Damn it! It's such an exciting subject.

747
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,280
Could we possibly stay just,
just a bit longer?

748
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,740
Gentlemen, you are forcing me
to be distasteful.

749
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,702
Yes, you're right.
We are being inconsiderate.

750
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,992
Please accept our apologies.

751
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,371
Brudah will show you out. Good night.

752
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:15,592
Do you, uh...

753
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:17,719
Do you believe in vampires?

754
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:25,719
Yes.

755
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,100
That's interesting.

756
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,153
Vampires have always fascinated me.

757
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:41,819
They should. Their intelligence
is far superior to humans.

758
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,738
Are you saying that a vampire isn't human?

759
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,577
They live forever. Humans cannot.

760
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:53,630
I'm going to leave you now.

761
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:58,485
Is it true that vampires must be in their
resting places before the sun rises?

762
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:01,759
That if the rays of the sun hit them,
they will disintegrate?

763
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,520
I shall save the answer for that question
until the next time we meet.

764
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:16,628
And you may be very comfortable
in knowing, Dr. Hayes,

765
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,823
we shall most definitely meet again.

766
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,276
Brudah.

767
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,614
Michael?

768
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,185
How would you feel about driving
a wooden stake through somebody's heart?

769
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,286
Marvelous.

770
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:35,830
That's good.

771
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:40,151
Because I think you and I
are going to have to kill Count Yorga.

772
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,236
What?

773
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:42,320
That's right.

774
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,405
You gotta be joking.

775
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:45,678
Uh-uh, I mean it.

776
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,387
- Listen to me.
- No! You gotta listen to me for a change.

777
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,664
First, you ask me to believe in vampires,

778
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:54,833
which is incredible
on your part to begin with.

779
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,127
Then, you tell me Count Yorga's a vampire.

780
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,229
No valid proof or anything,
just your theory.

781
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,214
And now you're saying
we're gonna have to kill him?

782
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:02,549
That's right.

783
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:04,718
You've gotta be out of your mind!

784
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,616
Right. Right, suppose we do kill him.

785
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,848
How do we convince anybody
we were justified in doing it?

786
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,976
"Excuse me, Judge. You see, it's all right,
he was a villainous vampire."

787
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:14,669
There won't be any proof.

788
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,396
You're out of your mind!

789
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:18,231
- His body will turn to ashes.
- Oh!

790
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,192
Michael, we're not gonna do anything
unless we can convince ourselves,

791
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,237
absolutely convince ourselves,
that he is a vampire.

792
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,657
Doctor, vampires were born out of,
and belong to, folklore and fiction.

793
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:28,742
All right, number one.

794
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,369
What about Paul and Erica? Where are they?

795
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,412
Now Erica we don't know about,

796
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:35,040
but Paul, you know damn well, went over
to the Count's mansion last night,

797
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,208
you haven't heard from him since.

798
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,919
Number two.
What did Donna's mother die of?

799
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,129
Pernicious anemia.

800
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:42,651
Pernicious anemia!

801
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:46,801
What you don't know is Erica was well
on her way to having pernicious anemia.

802
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:50,531
Number three. Do you know
how vampires continue to exist?

803
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,703
The only way they can exist?

804
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,917
By sucking the blood from the living.

805
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,479
What about those marks on Erica's throat?

806
01:05:57,579 --> 01:06:00,128
Her need for blood? Her need for blood!

807
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:04,694
I have a feeling
we can't waste any more time.

808
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,279
I say we should try to stop him now,

809
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,223
even if it means driving
a wooden stake through his heart.

810
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,228
Wow.

811
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,402
Yeah.

812
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,610
Michael, I sincerely hope I'm wrong,

813
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,363
but I'm positive I'm not.

814
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,074
When do we start?

815
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,796
A little later this afternoon,
before sunset.

816
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:47,654
Well, I'd better get going.
Get some sleep, set the alarm.

817
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,240
Meet me in my office
at about 2:00 this afternoon.

818
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,308
I should know what we need by then.

819
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:56,204
We'll still have about three or four hours
before the sun goes down,

820
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,557
before he can get out of his coffin.

821
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,610
- Shouldn't you get some sleep?
- No, my adrenalin is going pretty good.

822
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:04,646
Jim?

823
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:08,775
Thank you.

824
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,928
Michael, I think you should know
that if I'm right

825
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,347
we'll be putting our heads on the block.

826
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,808
Vampires supposedly have the wisdom
of centuries on their sides.

827
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:18,518
They don't live that long by being fools.

828
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:21,622
So, it's a bit possible he might get us.

829
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,872
That's cheery.

830
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,629
Another interesting point...

831
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,611
It's conceivable that Paul and Erica
might have turned into vampires.

832
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,930
If that's true
we'll have to kill them, too.

833
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,513
Don't forget to set the alarm.

834
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:31,257
Uh, Sergeant, this is Dr. James Hayes.

835
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,200
H-A-Y-E-S.

836
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,204
Now please listen to me
before you hang up.

837
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:40,371
I would like to try to convince you,
very seriously convince you,

838
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,879
that a vampire, in fact,
does exist in this city.

839
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:59,807
Now I'm the 58th nut to report a vampire.

840
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:06,606
Did it ever occur to you
that we may be right, you dumb ass?

841
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,410
<i>Donna.</i>

842
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,739
<i>Donna.</i>

843
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,368
<i>It is time.</i>

844
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,580
<i>The time has come for us to be one,</i>

845
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,462
<i>eternally together.</i>

846
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,842
<i>Come. Come, my love.</i>

847
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:37,886
<i>Come.</i>

848
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,131
<i>Donna.</i>

849
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,298
<i>Donna.</i>

850
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:52,732
Hello?

851
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:53,958
Donna's gone.

852
01:10:55,793 --> 01:11:00,198
Oh, my God, it's 4:30.
Why the hell didn't you call me?

853
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:01,345
The alarm didn't go off.

854
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,597
I'll be right over.

855
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:03,136
Ridiculous, right?

856
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:06,264
The age of atomic weapons
and we have to use sticks.

857
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,307
See if you can find a cross or a crucifix.

858
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,475
What for?

859
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:12,145
According to the book, vampires
are supposed to be afraid of crosses.

860
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:14,188
What they represent,
good and evil, etcetera.

861
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:17,383
They'll be our only protection
if he is a vampire.

862
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,378
Michael!

863
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,991
I couldn't find a crucifix, but I got
some cord and I'll make them on the way.

864
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:26,576
- Is that a broom handle?
- Yeah.

865
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:27,768
Why not?

866
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,913
You think we're wise,
leaving the car so far from the house?

867
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,831
Suppose we have to make a run for it?

868
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,709
Well, if we have to leave
this place on the run, we lose.

869
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,152
- Think we're in time?
- No.

870
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,772
The sun is down.

871
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,568
If the book is right,
our Count charming is up and around.

872
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:29,284
Look, the first thing we do is try to
find Donna and make sure she's safe.

873
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:32,450
Then, I guess we try to find the Count.

874
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:37,855
If we can prove to ourselves
that he is what I think he is,

875
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,398
enjoy yourself.

876
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:41,421
Will these crosses work?

877
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,337
Unfortunately, we'll soon find out.

878
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:45,822
Good luck.

879
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,014
You, too.

880
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:48,616
You scared?

881
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:49,842
Yes.

882
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,561
So am I.

883
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:55,890
Go.

884
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:47,401
The girl. Upstairs.

885
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,075
Forgive me.

886
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:00,750
Please.

887
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:19,432
We have visitors.

888
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,852
We cannot afford their knowledge.

889
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,025
Dr. Hayes.

890
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:48,146
What an unexpected surprise.

891
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:56,370
Yes, so much so that I almost
had a massive coronary.

892
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:59,865
Would you care to come in?

893
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,838
As a matter of fact, I was...

894
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:08,082
Just thinking of that very thing.

895
01:17:10,668 --> 01:17:11,669
Please.

896
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:20,870
Very nice seeing you again.

897
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,347
Thank you.

898
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:13,255
Are you still interested in continuing
last evening's conversation?

899
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:16,108
Yes, I... I'd like that very much.

900
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,538
On what subject did we end?

901
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,245
Vampires.

902
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:25,409
Vampires.

903
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:28,162
Yes.

904
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,590
May I?

905
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,149
Now where shall we begin?

906
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:56,674
I believe I told you
last night, did I not,

907
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:59,994
that vampires have minds
far superior to those of mortals?

908
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:01,745
Yes, you did.

909
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:07,335
It is due, of course,
to their unique power to outlast centuries.

910
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:09,311
Time to gather and absorb wisdom

911
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:13,006
from some of the most potent
minds that have ever lived.

912
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,011
What would you say was
their greatest strength?

913
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:23,176
Their ability to rule that
which they choose to rule.

914
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:29,311
Their ability to make a fool
out of any man.

915
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:45,198
I guess there's no reason
to continue this, is there?

916
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,743
I quite agree.

917
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,961
Would you care now to see
that which you hope not to see?

918
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,069
Erica.

919
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,131
Do you find it interesting, Doctor?

920
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:41,838
Where's Donna and Paul?

921
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:46,809
Donna is upstairs. Paul is dead.

922
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,771
You shall never see either of them again.

923
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,480
You enjoyed your little joke
last night, Doctor.

924
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:59,112
But as you can see, tonight is mine.

925
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:02,817
It's incredible. You really are a...

926
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:06,237
Vampire? Yes.

927
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:11,250
You really are naive.

928
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,125
Michael!

929
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,095
Michael!

930
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:26,803
Michael!

931
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,117
- Michael!
- Michael!

932
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,461
Michael!

933
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,053
Paul.

934
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:36,099
My God, Paul!

935
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,269
Oh, my God!

936
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,525
You've been wanting to see your mother.

937
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:51,404
Now you may.

938
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,247
Hello, my darling.

939
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:34,068
Dirty bastard!

940
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:37,609
Donna...

941
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:41,747
Upstairs.

942
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:09,516
Erica?

943
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,088
Get away from her.

944
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,967
So, Michael, you were very lucky.

945
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:22,927
I said, get away from her.

946
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:25,513
Donna, are you all right?

947
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:27,390
Yes.

948
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,064
Come over here and get behind me.

949
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,566
Don't be afraid.

950
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:36,736
- Hold it!
- Michael! You'll never win.

951
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:42,075
Donna, damn it, I said come here!

952
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,627
Honey, let's get out of here.

953
01:30:27,964 --> 01:30:29,762
I'm sorry.

954
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:32,720
Let's go.

955
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:11,803
Oh, my God!

956
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:17,724
I'm looking at it and I still
can't believe it all happened.

957
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:21,233
Let's go.

958
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:02,393
Oh, baby. Baby.

959
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:23,209
<i>Superstition.</i>
