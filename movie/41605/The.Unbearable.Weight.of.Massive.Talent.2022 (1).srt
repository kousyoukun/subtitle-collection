1
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,504
我想去理发。
I meant to get a haircut.

2
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:38,179
我有个礼物给你，凯西。
I got a present for ya', Casey.

3
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:48,909
凯西，亲爱的，你现在把你爸爸的礼物拿走。
Casey, sweetie, you take your daddy's present now.

4
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,837
我也有你的照片。
I got a picture of you, too.

5
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,144
Maria!

6
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,481
不!不,不!不!
No! No, no! No!

7
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:15,216
生日快乐,亲爱的。
Happy birthday, darlin'.

8
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,495
不!
No!

9
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:47,782
哇!
Whoa!

10
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,935
谢谢你！
Thank you.

11
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:09,378
你肯定见过曼凯维奇家的陌生人。
Obviously, you've seen mankiewicz's house of strangers.

12
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:10,814
这是我最喜欢的电影之一。
It's one of my all-time favorite movies.

13
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,678
这正是你的剧本让我想到的。
That's exactly what your script reminded me of.

14
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:15,576
权力之争，权势之争。是的。是的。
The power struggle, the fight for relevance. Yeah. Yeah.

15
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:19,412
你可能会觉得这听起来有点疯狂，但在某种程度上，这就是李尔王。
And you're gonna think this sounds a little crazy, but in some ways, it's king lear.

16
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:20,681
李尔王。是的,没错。
It's king lear. Yeah, exactly.

17
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:23,492
看，我就知道你会理解我想用这部电影做什么。
See, I knew you'd understand what I'm trying to do with this film.

18
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:24,985
正确的。
Right.

19
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:31,792
大卫，我不知道该说什么，但这是我一生中最重要的角色我真的很想参与其中。
David, I don't know what to say exactly, except this is the role of a lifetime and I'd really love to be a part of this.

20
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:33,603
酷,伙计。过几天我再给你打电话。
Cool, man. I'll just give you a shout in a couple of days.

21
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:37,297
哦。如果你担心波士顿口音，我可以模仿波士顿口音。
Oh. If you're worried about the Boston accent, I can do the Boston accent.

22
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,541
我这一周都在写。
I've been working on it all week.

23
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:39,967
我不担心，尼克。
I'm not worried, Nick.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,804
好吧，如果你还有其他问题或者想聊聊，给我打电话。
Okay, well, if you have any other questions or you just wanna talk, give me a call.

25
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:48,441
或者如果你想让我…读……你不需要为我读书。
Or if you'd like me to, uh... To read... You don't need to read for me.

26
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,376
当然不是。
Of course not.

27
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,812
很明显，我不会这么做。
And obviously, I'm not going to.

28
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,681
很明显。
Obviously.

29
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,424
但我打赌你一定很想听我朗读，对吧?
But I bet a part of you would love to hear me read, right?

30
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:56,549
我是说，你为什么不呢?
I mean, why wouldn't you?

31
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:58,284
如果我是你，我会想听的。
If I were you, I'd want to hear it.

32
00:02:58,318 --> 00:02:59,958
说真的，我不想你读书。好吧。
Seriously, I don't want you to read. Okay.

33
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:04,424
总之，这是我，所以我要…你知道吗?我要读。
Anyway, this is me, so I'm gonna... Well, you know what? I'm gonna read.

34
00:03:04,457 --> 00:03:06,761
“这是注定的结局，吉米。
"It's a foregone conclusion, Jimmy.

35
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:10,898
人脑向身体发送信息需要13毫秒。
"It takes 13 milliseconds for the human brain "to send a message to the body.

36
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:18,773
"所以，当你的子弹击中我的时候，我的大脑皮层"会"向"控制我扳机手指的17块健康肌肉"传递信号。
"So, by the time your bullets hit me, my cerebral cortex "will have transmitted a signal "to the 17 healthy muscles "that operate my trigger finger.

37
00:03:18,806 --> 00:03:26,946
"在你屁眼还没撅起嘴之前，"你的延髓"就会被溅到你身后的墙上。
"And before your asshole has had a chance to pucker up, "your medulla oblongata "will be splattered on a fucking wall behind ya.

38
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,848
"如果这是我最后完成的事"
"And if that's the last thing I accomplish"

39
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:30,650
“在这个美丽的绿色地球上，”
"on this beautiful green earth,"

40
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:35,054
“好吧，那么，哈，我说，哈，这他妈是怎么去的。”
"well, then, ha, I say, ha, what a way to fucking go."

41
00:03:37,757 --> 00:03:39,324
天呐
Holy shit.

42
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,631
如果你想，我可以再做一个。
I can do another if you want.

43
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:52,504
该死的,男人!
Damn, man!

44
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,741
很好，对吧?感觉很好。
That was good, right? Felt good.

45
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:57,342
曼凯维奇?Whoo-hoo !令人难以置信的吸引力。
Mankiewicz? Whoo-hoo! Incredible pull.

46
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:59,411
我知道。我突然想到了。
I know. It just popped into my head.

47
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:01,380
嗯,很好。我为你感到高兴。
Well, good. I'm happy for you.

48
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:05,484
因为，老实说，伙计，你真的需要这个。
Because, honestly, man, you really need this.

49
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:07,452
什么?这是什么意思?
What? What is that supposed to mean?

50
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:09,956
你得到它。这可能会改变游戏规则。
You get it. This could be a game changer.

51
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:12,001
我不需要改变游戏规则的人。如果它发生了，它就发生了。
I don't need a game changer. If it happens, it happens.

52
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,769
如果不行，我就继续工作。这就是我的工作。
If it doesn't, I'll just keep working. That's what I do.

53
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:16,763
我只是说，你可以更有策略一点。
I'm just saying, you could be a little more strategic.

54
00:04:16,796 --> 00:04:18,564
多选择电影明星。
Make more movie star choices.

55
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:21,610
就像迈尔斯·戴维斯告诉我的…“有时候，是那些音符”
It's like miles Davis told me... "Sometimes, it's the notes"

56
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:22,836
“你不玩。”
"you don't play."

57
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,403
迈尔斯·戴维斯是个海洛因瘾君子。
Miles Davis was a heroin addict.

58
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:28,551
我是说，我爱他，他是个大师，但我工作的时候很开心，很健康。我是一个演员。
I mean, I love him, he was a maestro, but I'm happy, I'm healthy when I'm working. I'm an actor.

59
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,009
不，你他妈是个电影明星!
No, you're a fucking movie star!

60
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:31,476
你永远不要忘记这一点!
And don't you ever forget that!

61
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,088
好吧，我不需要这个。我不需要这个。
Okay, I don't need this. I don't need this.

62
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:35,048
滚出我的车。尼基，滚出我的车。
Get out of my car. Nicky, get out of my car.

63
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,716
我不需要这个。
I don't need this.

64
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:47,426
我需要这个。
I need this.

65
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,428
这可能会改变游戏规则。
This could be a game changer.

66
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:53,800
所以，你对你的职业发展不满意，因为你似乎一直在工作。
So, you're not happy with how your career is going because you seem to be working all the time.

67
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,502
我从来没把它当成职业，只是把它当成工作。
Well, I never viewed it as a career, only as work.

68
00:04:57,536 --> 00:04:58,581
这有什么问题吗?
And what's wrong with that?

69
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:04,519
我的意思是，在其他工作中，努力工作是值得关注的，但在电影表演中，“你拍的电影太多了，尼克”
I mean, in any other job, hard work is something to behold, but with film performance, "You're making too many movies, Nick."

70
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:05,879
“你工作太辛苦了，尼克。”
"You're working too hard, Nick."

71
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:07,422
"让观众更想你，尼克"
"Have the audience miss you more, Nick."

72
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:08,691
我是说，“你好，这是我的工作。”
I mean, "hello, it's my job."

73
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:09,983
“我付账单。”
"I pay my bills."

74
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,684
“我养活我的家人。你烦人。”
"I feed my family. You're annoying."

75
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:12,986
我的天哪!
My gosh!

76
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:15,855
是的。
Yeah.

77
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,657
那么，你担心什么呢，尼克?
So, what's the worry here, Nick?

78
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,492
你失去了一些你的能力，你作为演员的天赋?
You've lost some of your ability, your talent as an actor?

79
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:23,662
不。
No.

80
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:27,465
嗯…不，只是我真的很想这样。
Uh... No, it's just that I really want this.

81
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:28,800
这是一生中最重要的角色。
This is the role of a lifetime.

82
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,736
这是一个很棒的角色。
It's a great part.

83
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:36,041
你认为你和工作的关系会如何影响你和女儿的关系?
Well, how do you think your relationship with your work affects your relationship with your daughter?

84
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:38,076
我们把艾迪也牵扯进来，好吗?
Let's bring addy into this, shall we?

85
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:42,214
什么?你不用这么做的。
What? Oh, you don't have to do that.

86
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:43,682
你们可以继续聊。
You guys can keep talking.

87
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:46,526
好吧，我只想说，这样的角色不是每天都能出现的。
Well, I'll just finish with, a role like this doesn't come along every day.

88
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,719
现在，我要闭嘴了。
And now, I'm gonna zip it.

89
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:48,863
-我拉得很好。-阿迪。
- I zipped it good. - Addy.

90
00:05:48,887 --> 00:05:52,724
你觉得你爸爸对自己事业的焦虑对你有什么影响?
How do you think your dad's anxiety over his career has affected you?

91
00:05:52,758 --> 00:05:55,794
他的事业几乎是我们唯一谈论的话题。
Well, his career is pretty much the only thing we talk about.

92
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:59,231
或者他让我看老电影，然后讨论。
That or he makes me watch old movies, and then discuss them.

93
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:01,800
其实就是他给我上了两个小时的课。
Which is really just him lecturing me for two hours.

94
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,568
这是一个谈话。这更像是一种对话。
It's a conversation. It's more of a conversation.

95
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:07,538
他让我看了部奇怪的老电影。
He made me watch this bizarre old movie.

96
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:10,208
它叫什么名字?卡拉马里博士岛?
What was it called? The island of Dr. Calamari?

97
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:13,211
卡里加里博士的内阁。你喜欢吗，艾迪?
The cabinet of Dr. Caligari. And did you like it, addy?

98
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:15,546
这是我最喜欢的电影之一。你看过吗?
It's one of my favorite films. Have you seen it?

99
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,748
不，我没有。
No, I have not.

100
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:22,486
讲的是一个疯癫的老医生被一个梦游者完全迷住了。
It's about this insane old doctor who has a sleepwalker completely under his spell.

101
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,856
这个老疯子。
This crazy old loon.

102
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,794
你能想象那会有多可怕吗?
Can you imagine how horrifying that would be?

103
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,004
完全被某人迷住了?
To be completely under someone's spell?

104
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:31,897
你喜欢，对吧?
And you liked it, right?

105
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,000
我是说，你喜欢那些彩绘布景和化妆…不，我没有。
I mean, you like the painted sets, and the makeup... No, I did not.

106
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:38,170
在我看来，她可能不想看这部电影。
Sounds to me like maybe she didn't want to see the movie.

107
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:39,604
你想过吗，尼克?
Did you think about that, Nick?

108
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:40,973
关于她想要什么?
About what she wants?

109
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:42,941
谢丽尔,来吧。这是个问题吗?
Cheryl, come on. Is that a real question?

110
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:45,110
你觉得他会说什么?
What do you think he's gonna say?

111
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:49,014
她有惊人的视觉感受力。总是。
She has an amazing visual sensibility. Always has.

112
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:52,617
我们非常亲密，在这种亲密关系中，我能够确定……
We're very close, and within that closeness, I was able to ascertain...

113
00:06:57,222 --> 00:06:58,256
嗨,蜂蜜。嗨,妈妈。
Hey, honey. Hi, mom.

114
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,592
再见,阿迪。我爱你。
Bye, addy. I love you.

115
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,296
哦，不，发生什么事了?
Oh, no, what happened?

116
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,298
她生我的气是因为我们看了。
Oh, she's mad at me because we watched.

117
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:11,803
卡利加里博士的内阁成员她很讨厌，我觉得很奇怪，因为她的品味一般都很成熟。
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari together and she hated it, which I find odd, given how mature her taste normally is.

118
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:17,675
等等，你很惊讶你十几岁的女儿不想和你一起看一部疯狂的百年德国电影吗?
Wait, you're surprised your teenage daughter didn't wanna watch an insane 100-year-old German film with you?

119
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,744
是的。哦,我的上帝。好吧。
Yes. Oh, my god. Okay.

120
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:21,112
好吧，不仅仅是这样。
Well, it's not just that.

121
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:24,749
你知道，她从来没读过玛丽·雪莱，简·奥斯汀，甚至是马克·吐温。
You know, she's never read Mary shelley, or Jane Austen, or even twain.

122
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:27,885
真是个小市侩。我们应该和她断绝关系吗?
What a little philistine. Should we disown her?

123
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,021
她以为亨弗莱·鲍嘉是个色情明星。
She thought Humphrey bogart was a porn star.

124
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:33,858
是的…什么,真的吗?是的。
Yeah... What, really? Yeah.

125
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:36,060
这是令人失望的。
That's disappointing.

126
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:38,662
除非有个叫汉弗莱·鲍嘉的艳星。
Unless there is a porn star called Humphrey bogart.

127
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:40,931
那是可行的，不是吗?汉弗莱。驼峰。
That would work, wouldn't it? Humphrey. Hump.

128
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:43,601
没有?
No?

129
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:48,315
看,你只是……你现在和她在一起很棘手，好吗?
Look, you're just... You're at a tricky stage right now with her, okay?

130
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,210
如果你不学会连接，它就会一直断下去……你他妈笑什么?嗯?
And if you don't learn to connect, it's gonna stay broken for... What the fuck are you smiling at? Huh?

131
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:54,612
你笑什么?我不是。
Why are you smiling? I'm not.

132
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:55,980
你。好吧。
You are. Okay.

133
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:57,057
奥利维亚，我准备出演一部激动人心的电影。
Olivia, I'm up for a very exciting movie.

134
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,849
我认为这是会发生的。
And I think it's gonna happen.

135
00:07:58,883 --> 00:08:00,327
哦,我的上帝。你能帮我个忙吗?是的。
Oh, my god. Look, will you do me a favor? Yes.

136
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:01,819
参加她的生日聚会。
Turn up for her birthday party.

137
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:03,621
当然可以。当然可以。
Of course. Of course.

138
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:04,989
天啊!
Gosh!

139
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:07,158
芬克，我们见个面吧。我有一些问题。
Hey, fink, let's meet up. I have some questions.

140
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,026
我不知道。我真的很想要这个。
I don't know. I just really want this.

141
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,099
这是我一生中最重要的角色，作为我的经纪人…尼克，我感觉很好，好吗?
I mean, this is the role of a lifetime, and as my agent... Nick, I've got a good feeling, okay?

142
00:08:15,132 --> 00:08:16,934
好吧。现在,来吧。
Okay. Now, come on.

143
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,969
我知道你有多紧张。
I know how tense you get.

144
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:21,172
这能帮你放松。
This is going to help you relax.

145
00:08:21,906 --> 00:08:23,140
他妈的!
Fuck!

146
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,209
哦,我的天!妈的，我太喜欢了。
Oh, my! Fuck, I love this so much.

147
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,380
这伤得这么重吗?他妈的!
Is this supposed to hurt this much? Fuck!

148
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:31,315
它是。越痛越好。
It is. The more pain the better.

149
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:35,386
他妈的……为什么?这对血液循环有好处。
Fuckin'... Why? It's good for circulation.

150
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:45,896
尼克，我们有了另一份工作。
So, Nick, we got another offer.

151
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,970
今天早上刚到。
Just came in this morning.

152
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:48,833
太好了。它是什么?
Excellent. What's it about?

153
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:51,268
大概有一百万美元。
It's about a million bucks.

154
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,838
它是什么?
What is it?

155
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:55,272
生日派对，芬克?
A birthday party, fink?

156
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:57,174
你到底在说什么?
What are you even talking about?

157
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,986
你去，我不知道，讲些故事，逗他们笑。
You go, and I don't know, tell some stories, make 'em laugh.

158
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,113
让他们笑?喜欢……像马戏团的小丑?
Make 'em laugh? Like... like a circus clown?

159
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:03,647
一个训练有素的密封?
A trained seal?

160
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:10,254
尼克，我接到你业务经理肯尼的电话。
Nick, I got a call from your business manager, Kenny.

161
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:12,399
你在日落塔住了一年多了。
You've been living at the sunset tower for over a year.

162
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,924
所以呢?他们喜欢我在那里。
And so? They love having me there.

163
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,694
你欠他们60万美元。
You owe them $600,000.

164
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,195
他们把账单寄给肯尼。
They sent the bills to Kenny.

165
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,831
我会处理的。
I'll take care of it.

166
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:24,134
肯尼说你还有很多债务。
Kenny says you still have substantial debts.

167
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:30,740
现在，离婚，你的消费习惯，还有…好吧，我来处理这些，芬克。
And now, the divorce, and your spending habits and, and, and... Okay, I'm gonna deal with all that, fink.

168
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:33,042
你知道我会的。
You know I will.

169
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:38,214
但我会得到下一个角色当我得到时，一切都变了。
But I'm gonna get this next role and when I do, all of that changes.

170
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:41,384
然后,我回来了。
Then, I'm back.

171
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:44,687
顺便说一句，不是说我去哪儿了。
And, by the way, not that I went anywhere.

172
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:46,222
不是说你去哪儿了。
Not that you went anywhere.

173
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:47,690
你从不在自己身上拉屎。
You never shit on yourself.

174
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:50,393
来吧!永远不要在自己身上拉屎。
Come on! Never shit on yourself.

175
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:06,809
芬克，等一下。让我找个安静的地方。
Fink, hold on a second. Let me get somewhere quiet.

176
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:10,446
芬克，你还在吗?我现在能听到你说话了。
Fink, you still there? I can hear you now.

177
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,224
-你和他说话了吗?-我和大卫谈过了。
- Did you talk to him? - I talked to David.

178
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:14,350
哦,你在这里。太好了。等一等。
Oh, you're here. Great. Hold on.

179
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:15,952
对，我们在做蛋糕。
Right, we're doing cake.

180
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:18,955
嗯…天啊，你这是…我得接完这个电话。
Uh... Oh, my god, you're doing... I have to finish this call.

181
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:21,858
哦,我的上帝!耶稣基督!
Oh, my god! Jesus Christ!

182
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:22,926
来吧!
Come on!

183
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,728
芬克，你和他谈过了吗?
Fink, did you talk to him?

184
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:27,030
尼克，你能听到我说话吗?
Nick, can you hear me?

185
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:29,766
是的，我能听到你。他说了什么?
Yes, I can hear you. What did he say?

186
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:35,438
他说他爱你，但他最终为这个角色选择了不同的方向。
He said he loves you, but he ultimately went in a different direction for the role.

187
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:36,906
对不起,伙计。
Sorry, dude.

188
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:59,762
♬祝你生日快乐我讨厌它。

195

Gather round the piano. It's showtime, folks.

196
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:27,365
-他在干什么?——什么?
- What's he doing? - What?

197
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,991
尼克?尼克?
Nick? Nick?

198
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:30,759
离钢琴远点，尼克。
Uh, step away from the piano, Nick.

199
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,295
你好,路易斯。
Hi, Lewis.

200
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,330
你们现在都长大了。
You're all grown up now.

201
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:37,165
什么,你……什么，你15岁了?
What, are you... What, are you 15?

202
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,233
爸，别跟路易斯说话。
Dad, don't talk to Lewis.

203
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:39,835
好吧。
Okay.

204
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:45,107
我女儿九岁的时候，我和她第一次一起去旅行。
When she was nine years old, my daughter and I took our first trip together.

205
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,012
我们连夜开车，穿过沙漠，来到大峡谷。
We drove overnight, across the desert, to the Grand Canyon.

206
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,346
你还记得吗，亲爱的?
You remember that, sweetheart?

207
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,015
我确实记得。
I do remember that.

208
00:11:53,048 --> 00:12:03,191
当太阳升起来的时候，我把车停在路边，她的小脑袋靠在我的肩上，我们就这样看着……
And when the sun came up, I pulled over to the side of the road as she rested her little head on my shoulder and we just watched...

209
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,095
看着太阳升起。
Watched the sun come up.

210
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:12,968
那是我一生中最快乐的时刻。
That was the happiest moment of my life.

211
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:17,406
在那一刻，我为她的16岁生日谱写了一首小曲。
And in that moment, I composed a little tune for her 16th birthday.

212
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,875
从那以后我就一直在研究它。
I've been working on it ever since.

213
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:24,146
还有，生日快乐，亲爱的。在这里。
And, uh, happy birthday, sweetheart. Here goes.

214
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:45,300
♬看着太阳升起♬看着太阳升起♬爱就在我们的眼里哦，该死的上帝!
♪ Watching the sun come up ♪ watching the sun rise ♪ addy ♪ addy ♪ addy ♪ the love is in our eyes oh, fucking Jesus!

215
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:48,170
我很期待看到你的人生，亲爱的。
I'm so excited to see what you do with your life, honey.

216
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:50,606
无论你选择什么，我都会支持。
And I'll support whatever you choose.

217
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,875
只是，我不建议你去搞艺术。
Only, I wouldn't recommend a life in the arts.

218
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:58,581
尤其是，真正的人才在这个鬼地方不被赏识。
Especially, with how real talent goes unappreciated in this shithole town.

219
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:02,884
♬太阳升起♬太阳升起

220
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:11,225
我不知道，奥利维亚。
I don't know, Olivia.

221
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:13,194
我不知道。
I don't know.

222
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:31,412
你还记得我们三个曾经躺在纽约公寓客厅的地板上，你和我一看就是几个小时吗?
Do you remember when the three of us used to lie on the living room floor in the New York apartment, and you and I would watch her for hours on end?

223
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:32,947
还记得吗?
Remember?

224
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,950
那时候要容易得多。
It was so much easier then.

225
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,084
是的。
Yeah.

226
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,961
听。
Listen.

227
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,163
我要说点什么，但我不知道该不该说。
I'm gonna say something, and I'm not sure I should.

228
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:50,464
说出来。
Say it.

229
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,501
好吧。
Okay.

230
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,035
我需要你。
I need you.

231
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,470
你需要我吗?
You need me?

232
00:13:56,504 --> 00:14:00,007
我需要你振作起来，尼克。
I need you to get your shit together, Nick.

233
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,243
好吧?她不再是两岁的孩子了。
Okay? She's not two years old anymore.

234
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:05,312
她是个聪明的女孩，需要爸爸。
She is a smart girl who needs her dad.

235
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:09,350
她不需要…她不需要这个男人。
She doesn't need... She doesn't need this guy.

236
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:21,495
是的。
Yeah.

237
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,628
不,不。来吧。
No, no. Come on.

238
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,349
尼克。芬克。
Nick. Fink.

239
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,720
马略卡岛的事情……什么?生日聚会吗?如此令人沮丧。
The majorca thing... What? The birthday party? So depressing.

240
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,288
我真的很抱歉提起这件事。
I am honestly sorry for even bringing it up.

241
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,389
我就要它了。
I'll take it.

242
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,658
会很棒的。
It's gonna be great.

243
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:30,563
最好是这样，因为一旦结束，我就完了。
It better be because when it's over, I'm done.

244
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,266
就像热狗放在烤架上。
Like hot dogs on a grill.

245
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,535
我戒烟行动。
I'm quitting acting.

246
00:15:35,569 --> 00:16:00,360
所以，你可以打电话给交易员，告诉他们我说这是一个巨大的……荣誉……作为最古老的人类传统之一，讲故事和创造神话的一小部分。
So, you can call the trades, and tell them I said it was a tremendous... Honor... To be a small part of one of the oldest of human traditions, storytelling and mythmaking.

247
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,662
啊，操，伙计，对不起。
Ah, fuck, man, I'm sorry.

248
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,405
我正开车穿过山丘。一次。
I'm driving through the hills. One more time.

249
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,565
我说我不干了…
I said I'm quitting...

250
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:12,238
回到我们的头条新闻，加泰罗尼亚总统候选人。
Back to our main news story as catalan's presidential candidate.

251
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,408
查尔斯·德尔加多的女儿周一被绑架了。
Charles delgado's daughter was kidnapped on Monday.

252
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,478
警方已证实他们不知道她的下落。
The police have confirmed that they have no information as to her whereabouts.

253
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:23,349
他们问过任何有…你觉得我们少说废话怎么样，混蛋?
They have asked anyone with any... What do you say we cut the chitchat, a-hole?

254
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,818
你差点害死我两次。
You almost got me killed twice.

255
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:26,820
好吧。
Okay.

256
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,744
我在的位置。
I'm in position.

257
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:53,757
好吧，我一看到巴尔达萨里，你就过去把他带走。
All right, as soon as I have eyes on baldassari, you move in and take him.

258
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:54,782
收到
Copy that.

259
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,753
等等,等等,等等。这不是博尔达萨。
Wait, wait, wait. It's not baldassari.

260
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,487
这他妈是怎么回事?
What the fuck is happening right now?

261
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,457
马丁，跟我说话。谁在飞机上?
Martin, talk to me. Who's on the plane?

262
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:11,396
我不知道我是不是疯了，但我很确定那是演员尼克·凯奇。
I don't know if I'm losing my goddamn mind, but I'm pretty sure that's the actor Nick cage.

263
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,165
《月光迷魂》里那个混蛋?
That motherfucker from moonstruck?

264
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,767
耽于幻想的吗?不。变脸。
Moonstruck? no. From face/off.

265
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,569
等等,等等,等等。
Wait, wait, wait.

266
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,137
尼克·凯奇为什么会在这架飞机上?
Why the fuck is Nick cage on this plane?

267
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,809
你知道吗?我们退出。
You know what? We're pulling out.

268
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:23,886
我不喜欢这样。快离开那里。
I don't like this. Get out of there.

269
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,344
马丁。
Martin.

270
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,646
不，快离开那里。现在。
No, get out of there. Now.

271
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,318
薇薇安，听到了吗?我说，听到了吗?
Vivian, do you copy? I said, do you copy?

272
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,419
你知道吗?
You know what?

273
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,488
不。
No.

274
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:37,566
你什么意思，不?不,不,不。
What do you mean, no? No, no, no.

275
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,430
你在干什么?薇薇安，你在干什么?
What are you doing? Vivian, what are you doing?

276
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,761
谢谢你！
Thank you.

277
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,529
这是我们的机会。不,出去。
This is our shot. No, get out.

278
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:50,903
薇薇安，马上给我滚出去…尼古拉斯·凯奇!哦,我的上帝!你他妈太棒了!
Vivian, get the fuck out of there right... Nicolas cage! Oh, my god! You're so fucking awesome!

279
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,772
我爱你!噢,谢谢你。
I love you! Oh, thank you.

280
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,441
我和我侄子雷蒙德刚看了《荒野求生》
Oh, me and my nephew Raymond just watched croods 2.

281
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,344
老兄!让我们动心了。
Dude! Cracked us up.

282
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,880
我可以自拍吗?确定。
Can I get a selfie? Sure.

283
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,390
哦,狗屎。哦,我的上帝。不，我也喜欢那部电影。
Oh, shit. Oh, my god. No, I like that movie, too.

284
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,458
你在那部电影里演得太棒了。
You did so good in that movie, man.

285
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,717
谢谢你！我的天啊。
Thank you. My goodness.

286
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,184
我和艾玛·斯通一起拍了那部电影。
I made that movie with Emma stone.

287
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,620
你做了吗?她是我的最爱之一。
You did? She's one of my favorites.

288
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:08,831
-但你是最棒的。-谢谢你。
- But you were the best. - Well, thank you.

289
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,288
我们看起来很好。
We look good.

290
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,366
替我向你侄子问好。
Well, say hi to your nephew for me.

291
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,692
好吧。是的。雷蒙德。好吧。
Okay. Yeah. Raymond. Okay.

292
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,627
谢谢你！好吧,再见。
Thank you. All right, bye.

293
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:17,964
GPS掉在他身上了。
Dropped that GPS on him.

294
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,465
你疯了吗?他只是个平民。
Are you out of your mind? He's a fucking civilian.

295
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,868
他是一个演员。
He's an actor.

296
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,444
你还记得里斯本发生了什么吗?
Do you remember what went down in Lisbon?

297
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:24,804
他妈的里斯本,男人!
Fuck Lisbon, man!

298
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,439
那声音有点大。
That was kind of loud.

299
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,909
但他妈的里斯本。那不是我的错。
But fuck Lisbon. That wasn't my fault.

300
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,612
顺便问一下，你看过野蛮人2吗?不。
And by the way, have you seen croods 2? No.

301
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,212
我今年44岁。
I'm 44 years old.

302
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,848
我他妈为什么会看到野人?
Why the fuck would I see croods 2?

303
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:36,949
我来接你。
I'm picking you up.

304
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,701
芬克，你能等一下吗?
Yeah, fink, can you hold on?

305
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,644
打扰一下，这里是洛杉矶。我得接个电话。
Excuse me, it's Los Angeles calling. I need to take this.

306
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,302
仅仅两分钟。当然可以。
Just two minutes. Of course.

307
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,371
你能稍等一下吗?我要上船了。
Can you hold one second? I'm getting on a boat.

308
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:02,406
谢谢你！是的。
Thank you. Yeah.

309
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,409
我是说，我们对这家伙了解多少?
I mean, what do we know about this guy anyway?

310
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:10,347
他是西班牙的诺博士吗?他喜欢什么奇怪的东西吗?
Is he a Spanish Dr. No? Is he into something strange?

311
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:11,759
-艾伦做了一些调查。——坚持。
- Allan did some research. - Hold on.

312
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,350
艾伦，这家伙是做什么的?
Allan, what does this guy do?

313
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,953
他显然拥有橄榄园。
He owns olive groves apparently.

314
00:19:14,986 --> 00:19:18,790
还有，他写了这个剧本，他想让尼克出演。
Also, he wrote this screenplay, and he wants Nick to star in it.

315
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,458
把它扔进垃圾桶。
Throw that in the fucking trash.

316
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:21,860
尼克,你很好。
Nick, you're fine.

317
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:25,940
他又不是想让你给他口交或者干他老婆，或者看着你看着他干他老婆。
It's not like he's gonna want you to suck his dick or fuck his wife, or watch you watch him fuck his wife.

318
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,799
我不这么认为。放松。
I wouldn't think so. Relax.

319
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,601
玩得开心，搞定后给我打电话。
Have fun and give me a call when it's done.

320
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:30,794
你可以把一切都告诉我。
You can tell me all about it.

321
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,411
好地方。
Nice place.

322
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:42,480
也许我应该做橄榄生意。
Maybe I ought to get into the olive business.

323
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:44,515
笼子里先生,我……是的,对不起。真正的快。
Mr. Cage, I... Yeah, excuse me. Real quick.

324
00:19:44,548 --> 00:19:45,860
这房子的主人叫什么名字?
The guy that owns this house, what's his name?

325
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,285
杰维。是的,杰维。
Javi. Yeah, Javi.

326
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,959
哈维会不会想让我…我不太明白。
Is Javi going to want me to, uh, you know... I'm not sure I understand.

327
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:58,873
如果哈维想让我给他口交，或者上他老婆，或者看着我看着他上他老婆，那是不行的。你明白吗?这不是好。
Look, if Javi wants me to suck his dick, or fuck his wife, or watch me watch him fuck his wife, that's a no-go. You understand? It's no bueno.

328
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,833
我想是的。好吧，如果哈维…我是杰维。
I think so. Okay, and if Javi... I am Javi.

329
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:10,776
尼克凯奇。
Nick cage.

330
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,580
怎么样?
So, how was it?

331
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,549
很好，很正常。没什么大不了的。
It was fine, normal. No big deal.

332
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,719
来吧。告诉我真相。好吧,好吧。
Come on. Tell me the truth. Okay, okay.

333
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,654
他是难以置信的。是他吗?
He was incredible. Was he?

334
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:24,055
但也很酷。
But also, like, super cool.

335
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,769
他比我想象的要高一点，因为你知道，人们都说演员都很矮。
He was a little taller than I had imagined because you know they say actors are pretty short.

336
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,827
那么，他矮吗?
So, was he short?

337
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,995
不。没有?
No. No?

338
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:34,032
他是……刚刚好。
He was... Just right.

339
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,105
好吧，但他有提到你的剧本吗?
Okay, but did he say anything about your screenplay?

340
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,945
不。他没提，我也没提。
No. He didn't bring it up, I didn't bring it up.

341
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,337
时机不对。
It wasn't the right time.

342
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:47,846
想想如果在派对上当着所有人的面说尼古拉斯·凯奇主演了你写的电影会是什么感觉。
Just think about how would it feel to say in front of everyone at the party that Nicolas cage is starring in a movie that you wrote.

343
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,520
我不知道，加布里埃拉，也许我活在幻想世界里。
I don't know, Gabriela, maybe I am living in a fantasy world.

344
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:51,482
我是说，看看我们在说谁。
I mean, look who we're talking about here.

345
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:52,717
他是个传奇!
The man is a legend!

346
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:04,094
嗨。
Hi.

347
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:08,599
嘿。
Hey.

348
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:17,107
欢呼。
Cheers.

349
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:28,551
嗯?
Huh?

350
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:30,486
什么?
What?

351
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,058
哦，不，对不起，我以为…你刚才说……不,我……哦,不要紧。
Oh, no, I'm sorry, I thought that... Did you say... no, I did... Oh, never mind.

352
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:43,643
对，同样的，我在想…如果你没看过也没关系，但我想知道你有没有看过我的剧本?
Yeah, so along those same lines, I was wondering... And it's totally okay if you haven't, but I was just wondering if you had a chance to read my screenplay?

353
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,069
Javi!

354
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:49,640
我能来吗，还是只有贵宾才能来?
Can I come or it's only for vip?

355
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:52,442
凯奇先生，这位是加布里埃拉·卢凯西女士。嗨。
Uh, Mr. Cage, this is Ms. Gabriela lucchesi. Hi.

356
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:55,012
她负责我们所有的农业业务。
She runs all of our agricultural operations.

357
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:57,047
这是我的表弟。
And this is my cousin.

358
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:58,883
卢卡斯古铁雷斯。
Lucas Gutierrez.

359
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:02,686
凯奇先生，我们很高兴你能来。
Mr. Cage, we obviously are very excited to have you here.

360
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,954
你接下来要做什么?
What are you working on next?

361
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:08,491
这个问题对演员来说很难回答，但没关系。
Well, that's a tough question for an actor to get, but it's fine.

362
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:11,494
——哦。-因为我不再是演员了。
- Oh. - 'Cause I'm no longer an actor.

363
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:12,863
我已经退休了。
I've retired.

364
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:16,000
什么?退休是什么意思?
What? What do you mean, retired?

365
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,736
那你现在打算怎么办?
So, what are you going to do now?

366
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:23,007
过着家猫的生活。
Live the life of a house cat.

367
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:33,684
因为楼上的大发电厂迟早会停止供电我们就会退回到我们起源的那个虚无的黑坑里去。
Because it's just a matter of time before the great power plant upstairs turns off the juice and we retreat to the black pit of nothingness from whence we came.

368
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,757
那么，跟我们说说怎么造石头吧。
So, tell us about making the rock.

369
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:45,029
凯奇先生，你肯定希望自己还在拍那样的电影吧?
Bet you wish you were still making movies like that, huh, Mr. Cage?

370
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:49,632
当明星感觉一定很好。
Must have been nice to have been a star.

371
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,734
而现在……
And now...

372
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,729
笼子里的先生吗?醒来。
Mr. Cage? Wake up.

373
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:21,197
耶稣基督!
Jesus Christ!

374
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,534
古铁雷斯先生一整天都在等你起床。
So, Mr. Gutierrez has been waiting all day for you to get up.

375
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:28,280
他很想带你去西班牙他最喜欢的一个地方。
He really wants to show you one of his favorite places of all Spain.

376
00:23:28,304 --> 00:23:30,273
这叫导师的悬崖峭壁。
It's called the cliffs of cap de for mentor.

377
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:35,611
是这样的，我时差倒得很厉害，所以我不会参加的，好吗?
Yeah, see, well, I'm very jet lagged, so I won't be attending that, okay?

378
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:36,679
谢谢你！
Thank you.

379
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:41,651
哦,我的上帝!笼子里先生。
Oh, my god! Mr. Cage.

380
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:46,699
如果古铁雷斯先生让你跟他一起去看悬崖，你就得跟他一起去看悬崖。
If Mr. Gutierrez is asking you to go with him and see the cliffs, you're gonna go with him and see the cliffs.

381
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:48,057
你会爱上悬崖的。
And you're gonna love the cliffs.

382
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:49,625
即使你讨厌悬崖!
Even if you hate the cliffs!

383
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:51,694
我们清楚吗?
Are we clear?

384
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,632
加布里埃拉说你对悬崖很兴奋。
Gabriela said you are really excited about the cliffs.

385
00:23:56,666 --> 00:24:07,577
是的，的确如此。它只是…我现在感觉不太好，所以如果你想一个人出去，我可以回房间…哦,狗屎!
Yeah, very much so. It's just... I'm not feeling tip-top right now, so if you wanna go out there alone, I could go back to the room... Oh, shit!

386
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,045
狗屎!什么?
Shit! What?

387
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:14,217
我们现在必须走了。
We must go now.

388
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,685
嘿!
Hey!

389
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,520
Javi!

390
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:22,992
Javi!

391
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,594
这是怎么回事?
What is going on?

392
00:24:24,627 --> 00:24:25,762
快!
Faster!

393
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:27,597
我们在逃避什么?
What are we running from?

394
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,898
将军!
The general!

395
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:31,667
Javi!

396
00:24:33,703 --> 00:24:35,304
嘿!
Hey!

397
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:39,685
你现在就得告诉我到底发生了什么，否则我就拿回我的东西，回洛杉矶去。
You need to tell me right now what the hell is going on, or I'm getting my shit, and I'm going back to Los Angeles.

398
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,710
将军!
The general!

399
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:45,148
将军不准我见他女儿玛蒂尔达。
The general forbade me to see his daughter Matilda.

400
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:48,850
但我们违抗了他的命令!
But we defied his orders!

401
00:24:48,884 --> 00:24:53,055
现在，他想结束我的生命。
And now, he wants to end my life.

402
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:54,589
你看不见他吗?
Can't you see him?

403
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:02,097
好吧，好吧，我知道了。
All right, all right, I get it.

404
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,298
这是你编的?
You're making this up?

405
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,866
这是什么?
What is this?

406
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,170
就像斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的即兴表演?
Like a little stanislavski improv thing?

407
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:09,671
好吧，你可以停下来了。
Well, you can stop.

408
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:11,640
“?他是抵抗组织的一员吗?
Stanislavski? Is he part of the resistance?

409
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:14,709
停!我是你的客人!
Stop! I am your guest!

410
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:17,145
今早加布里埃拉把我的床罩扯下来了。
Gabriela ripped the bedspread off me this morning.

411
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,182
现在你让我去白费力气了!
Now you're sending me on, like, a wild goose chase!

412
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:22,717
我很抱歉，但你不能放弃表演!你不能!
I'm sorry, but you can't quit acting! You can't!

413
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:24,252
这不关你的事。
That's none of your business.

414
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:27,656
不管你喜不喜欢，你都有天赋。
Whether you like it or not, you have a gift.

415
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:35,931
这份礼物为这个日益黑暗和破碎的世界带来了光明和欢乐!
And that gift brings light and joy to an increasingly dark and broken world!

416
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:43,638
而背弃这份天赋就是背弃整个人类。
And to turn your back on that gift is to turn your back on the entire human race.

417
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:46,141
人类吗?
The human race?

418
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:48,243
恐怕是这样的。
I'm afraid so.

419
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:50,212
我该怎么办?
What am I gonna do?

420
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:54,182
哦,哇。如果我们现在不走，他们会杀了我们!
Oh, wow. If we don't go now, they will fucking kill us!

421
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:56,961
这些人闻到血腥味就跑了过来。我该怎么办?
These people smell blood and they come running. What am I gonna do?

422
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:58,429
他们快到森林的边缘了。
They're almost to the edge of the forest.

423
00:25:58,453 --> 00:25:59,921
我能听到他们。
I can hear them.

424
00:25:59,955 --> 00:26:01,890
玛蒂尔达，她在海岸边等我。
And Matilda, she is waiting down the coast.

425
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:04,626
我们现在就得走!我们得跳下去!
We have to go now! We have to jump!

426
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:16,037
你的处境岌岌可危。
You're in an untenable situation.

427
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:17,139
你知道的，对吧?
You know that, right?

428
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:20,175
告诉我一件事。
So tell me one thing.

429
00:26:21,877 --> 00:26:23,378
你爱她吗?
Do you love her?

430
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:25,447
我一直很爱她。
I've always loved her.

431
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,751
那我们就把你活着带出去。
Then let's get you out of here alive.

432
00:26:36,892 --> 00:26:39,427
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

433
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,399
他妈的!
Fuck!

434
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:46,834
哦,上帝!
Oh, god!

435
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:48,145
我不知道有悬崖!
I didn't know there was a cliff!

436
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:49,870
我不知道有那么高!
I didn't know it was that high!

437
00:26:49,904 --> 00:26:51,138
我们可能会死!
We could have died!

438
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:55,209
你真是个野人。
You're a wild man.

439
00:26:57,878 --> 00:26:59,158
我更喜欢波旁威士忌，谢谢。
I prefer bourbon, but thank you.

440
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:03,684
天啊，这地方太美了。
God, this place is stunning.

441
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:08,389
我打赌我女儿会喜欢这里的。这对她有好处。
I bet my daughter would like it out here. It'd be good for her.

442
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:10,057
你们俩关系好吗?
Are you two close?

443
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:13,127
跟一个16岁的孩子亲近是不可能的。
Well, it's impossible to be close with a 16-year-old.

444
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,831
但我试着陪在她身边。它只是…养育孩子没有剧本。
But I've tried to be there for her. It's just... There's no script for parenting.

445
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:20,801
感谢上帝，有我的前男友奥利维亚。
Thank god for my ex, Olivia.

446
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,336
你是怎么认识奥利维亚的?
How did you meet Olivia?

447
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:25,739
她是科雷利上尉曼陀林上的化妆师。
She was a make-up artist on captain corelli's mandolin.

448
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,208
美丽的电影。谢谢你！
Beautiful film. Thank you.

449
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:29,043
被低估的。
Underrated for sure.

450
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:30,244
我们很合得来，你知道的。
We just hit it off, you know.

451
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:32,880
她风趣、聪明、漂亮。
She was funny, smart, beautiful.

452
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:34,148
所以,发生了什么事?
So, what happened?

453
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,117
发生了什么事?
What happened?

454
00:27:41,255 --> 00:27:44,091
你呢?曾经结过婚吗?孩子吗?
What about you? Ever been married? Kids?

455
00:27:44,124 --> 00:27:45,125
不。
No.

456
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:57,304
有一个女人，但是，有时候环境会阻碍爱情，事情就是这样。
There is one woman, but, uh, sometimes circumstances get in the way of love and that's just the way it is.

457
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:07,114
凯奇先生，你最喜欢的电影是什么?
Anyway, Mr. Cage, what is your favorite movie?

458
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:10,551
哦……最喜欢的电影?
Oh... favorite movie?

459
00:28:10,585 --> 00:28:18,959
哦,哇!我的意思是,……也就是说,嗯…这是一个无法回答的问题。
Oh, wow! I mean, that... that is, uh... That's one of those questions that's impossible to answer.

460
00:28:18,993 --> 00:28:23,397
因为，你看，一百多年来丰富的电影。
Because, you see, 100-plus years of rich cinema.

461
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,266
你不能把它限制为一个。
You can't just limit it to one.

462
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:28,369
这取决于你的心情，季节。
It depends upon your mood, the seasons.

463
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:30,971
好吧，我们来看看前三名。你开始。
All right, let's do top three. You start.

464
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:33,073
第一,变脸。
Number one, face/off.

465
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:34,241
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

466
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:37,544
吴宇森是一位大师。谢谢你！
Woo is a maestro. Thank you.

467
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:43,883
第二，让我想想……卡里加里博士的内阁。
Number two, let me think... The cabinet of Dr. Caligari.

468
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:46,252
-你喜欢卡利加利?-我爱卡里加里。
- You love caligari? - I love caligari.

469
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:49,555
哇!我还以为我是唯一一个。
Wow! I was beginning to think I was the only one.

470
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,457
你来掌管这里吧，贾弗?
You gonna run the table here, jav?

471
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:55,895
是很困难的。就像你说的，100多年的丰富电影。
It's hard. It's like you said, 100-plus years of rich cinema.

472
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:58,965
谢谢你！
Thank you.

473
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:03,102
听着，你能不能别拖拖拉拉，赶紧回答问题?
Look, can you just stop stalling and answer the question?

474
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:05,204
你第三喜欢的电影是什么?
What is your third favorite movie of all time?

475
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:10,577
帕丁顿2。
Paddington 2.

476
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:12,879
什么?
What?

477
00:29:12,912 --> 00:29:14,615
帕丁顿2号卡利加里博士内阁。
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Paddington 2.

478
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:16,015
连接这些点。
Connect those dots.

479
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:19,018
我是说，我不想显得势利，但是…我从头到尾都在哭。
I mean, I don't wanna be a snob, but... I cried through the entire thing.

480
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:20,486
这让我想成为一个更好的人。
It made me want to be a better man.

481
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,089
废话,男人!
Bullshit, man!

482
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:32,098
《帕丁顿熊2》简直不可思议。
Paddington 2 is incredible.

483
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,468
我他妈的告诉过你。
I fucking told you.

484
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:42,408
真心话大冒险，尼克?
Truth or dare, Nick?

485
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:44,344
真理。
Truth.

486
00:29:49,982 --> 00:29:53,086
你讨厌我的剧本吗?如果你做了也没关系。
Did you hate my screenplay? It's okay if you did.

487
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,387
我只是想知道。
I just need to know.

488
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,255
你写了剧本?
You wrote a script?

489
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:59,058
我把它发给你的经纪人了。
I sent it to your agent.

490
00:29:59,092 --> 00:30:00,336
他应该把它给你的。
He was supposed to give it to you.

491
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,662
好吧,他没有。
Well, he didn't.

492
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:05,599
我想我能理解为什么他没有，但它在哪里?我现在就看。
I guess I can understand why he didn't, but where is it? I'll read it right now.

493
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:07,467
现在?现在?现在。
Now? Like, right now? Right now.

494
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,501
发送它。
Send it.

495
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:21,582
我发送它。太棒了。
I sent it. Fantastic.

496
00:30:21,615 --> 00:30:25,218
我们进城喝一杯庆祝一下吧。
Let's go into town, have a celebratory drink.

497
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:27,086
你可以看着我读。
You can watch me read it.

498
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,055
看它拖到哪里。它会很有趣。
See where it drags. It'll be fun.

499
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:30,189
不。
No.

500
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:33,192
老实说，我太紧张了。
Honestly, I'm too nervous.

501
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:34,595
我的心跳得很快。
My heart is beating so fast.

502
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:39,297
我想我该睡觉了。
I think I need to go to bed.

503
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:44,069
听着,杰维,真理。
Listen, Javi, truth.

504
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:52,944
我对来到这里并不感到兴奋，但今晚是我这么长时间以来最开心的一次。
I wasn't that thrilled about coming out here, but tonight has been the most fun I've had in a long, long time.

505
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:55,180
所以,谢谢你。
So, thank you.

506
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:14,634
哦。嗨,尼克。
Oh. Hey, Nicky.

507
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,301
那你还没退休?
So, you're unretired then?

508
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,136
这是这个想法。
That's the idea.

509
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:22,474
哈维启发了你，是吗?你喜欢这家伙?
Javi inspired you, did he? You like this guy?

510
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:24,577
他对电影很有鉴赏力。
He has good taste in movies.

511
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:30,583
另外，和伟大的导演一起演一些小角色对我也有好处。
Plus, it could be good for me to do some smaller roles with great directors.

512
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:33,018
一些具有挑战性的角色塑造。
Some challenging character work.

513
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:35,220
嗯。所以,像,嗯……像什么?
Huh. So, like, um... like what?

514
00:31:35,253 --> 00:31:39,090
下一部《双面兄弟》里的基佬叔叔之类的吗?
The gay uncle in the next duplass brothers movie kind of thing?

515
00:31:39,124 --> 00:31:40,392
完全正确。
Exactly.

516
00:31:40,425 --> 00:31:43,028
你他妈在说什么?
What the fuck are you talking about?

517
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:50,502
你15岁以后我们就没工作了…41年才成为一部学生电影的第七名。
We haven't worked since you were 15... Forty-one years to be number seven on a call sheet of a goddamn student film.

518
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:52,103
我认为这是个好主意。
I think it's a good idea.

519
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:53,405
你听我说。
You listen to me.

520
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:56,141
你是尼克他妈的
You're Nick fucking

521
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:08,520
笼子里!
Cage!

522
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:10,790
艾迪不需要一个努力奋斗的艺术家做父亲。
Addy doesn't need a struggling artist for a father.

523
00:32:10,823 --> 00:32:13,458
她需要你成为明星。
She needs you to be a star.

524
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:16,394
现在轮到你下一个了，宝贝，我们回来了。
Now you get the next one, baby, and we're back.

525
00:32:16,428 --> 00:32:18,029
不是说我们去哪儿了。
Not that we went anywhere.

526
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:21,667
不是说我们去哪儿了。
Not that we went anywhere.

527
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:23,001
到这里来。
Come here.

528
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,513
是啊，尼克·凯奇亲吻得很好。
Yeah, Nick cage smooches good.

529
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:39,483
你告诉他们!尼克·凯奇吻得真好!
You tell 'em! Nick cage smooches good!

530
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:41,753
我再来一杯。
I'll have another one.

531
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:56,333
耶稣!
Jesus!

532
00:32:58,235 --> 00:33:00,170
你们想要什么?你想要钱吗?
What do you guys want? You want money?

533
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:02,506
拿着我的表。这不是复制品，这是真的。
Here, take my watch. It's not a copy, it's real.

534
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,577
凯奇先生，我们是美国政府的人。我们需要你的帮助。
Mr. Cage, we're with the U.S. government. We need your help.

535
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:09,480
和你在一起的人是一个暴力国际军火集团的头目。
The man you're staying with is the head of a violent international arms cartel.

536
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:11,750
等等,等等,等等。杰维吗?
Wait, wait, wait. Javi?

537
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,618
他是个无情的混蛋。
He's a ruthless motherfucker.

538
00:33:13,652 --> 00:33:15,620
他从西班牙沿海的小地方开始。
He started small, coastal Spain.

539
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:17,288
但后来，他变得贪婪起来。
But then, he got greedy.

540
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:20,291
他想把业务扩展到东部和西部。
Trying to expand his operations east, west.

541
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:22,159
他身后有一堆尸体。
Trail of dead bodies in his wake.

542
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:23,260
杰维古铁雷斯吗?
Javi Gutierrez?

543
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:24,763
是的,杰维。
Yes, Javi.

544
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,406
我觉得我们说的不是同一个哈维。
I don't think we're talking about the same Javi.

545
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,642
我们说的绝对是同一个哈维。
We're definitely talking about the same fucking Javi.

546
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:28,676
是同一个人，伙计。
It's the same fucking guy, man.

547
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,469
好吧,好吧。你是中情局的情报人员，对吧?
Okay, okay. So, you're CIA, some kind of intelligence, right?

548
00:33:32,503 --> 00:33:34,371
你的工作就是读懂别人，对吧?
And your job is to read people, yeah?

549
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:36,540
作为一个演员，这也是我的工作。
Well, as a thespian, that is also my job.

550
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:39,376
去理解人们的性格，去感受他们的感受。
To understand people's characters, to feel what they're feeling.

551
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,581
所以我才知道哈维不是枪贩子。
Which is how I know that Javi is not a gun dealer.

552
00:33:42,614 --> 00:33:48,419
你是说你的演技胜过了世界上最好的情报机构五年以来收集的确凿数据吗?
You're saying your acting ability trumps five years of hard data collected by the world's finest intelligence agency?

553
00:33:48,452 --> 00:33:50,789
我的新萨满教演技?
My nouveau shamanic acting ability?

554
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,156
你他妈最好相信。
You better fucking believe it.

555
00:33:52,189 --> 00:33:54,458
哦!嘿，伙计们，这太糟糕了。
Oh! Hey, guys, this sucks.

556
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:59,631
尼古拉斯·凯奇的新萨满表演能力决定了我们抓错人了。
Uh, Nicolas cage's nouveau shamanic acting ability has determined that we got the wrong guy.

557
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:02,199
所以，让我们收拾东西回家吧。
So, let's pack up our shit and fucking go home.

558
00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:04,636
嘿，伙计，别理他。他内心一片混乱。
Hey, man, don't mind him. He's all messed up inside.

559
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,171
他刚发现他老婆和他爸有一腿。
He just found out his wife's been fucking his dad.

560
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:09,874
这并不完全正确。
That's not all the way true.

561
00:34:09,908 --> 00:34:12,276
你认识这个女孩吗?
Look, do you recognize this girl?

562
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:15,412
不。
No.

563
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:17,214
这是玛丽亚德尔珈朵。
It's Maria delgado.

564
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:19,350
加泰罗尼亚总统的女儿。
President of catalonia's daughter.

565
00:34:19,383 --> 00:34:24,355
哈维的人两天前绑架了她迫使她父亲退出选举给更有利于贩毒集团的人让路。
Javi's men kidnapped her two days ago to force her father out of the election and make way for someone more cartel-friendly.

566
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:25,824
是的，美国不喜欢这样。
Yeah, the U.S. doesn't like that.

567
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:27,324
是的,看,嘿。
Yeah, look, hey.

568
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,660
我们得进入哈维的监控录像。
We need to access Javi's security cameras.

569
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,395
我们无法接近那个院子，因为它太坚固了。
We can't get anywhere near that compound because it's too fortified.

570
00:34:33,396 --> 00:34:34,665
然后，你出现了。
And then, you show up.

571
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,366
你想让我怎么做?
So, you want me to, what?

572
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,701
监视杰维?
Spy on Javi?

573
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:39,202
宾果。
Bingo.

574
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:40,771
是的，我不会那样做的。
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

575
00:34:40,804 --> 00:34:42,438
你有个和她差不多大的女儿，对吧?
You have a daughter about her age, right?

576
00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:45,375
这是昨天收到的。
This came in yesterday.

577
00:34:47,945 --> 00:34:50,513
你觉得你会有什么感觉?
How do you think you would feel, huh?

578
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,515
知道你本可以帮忙的?
Knowing you could have helped?

579
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,217
但你选择不这么做。
But you chose not to.

580
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:58,622
背负着很大的罪恶感，不是吗?
Be a lot of guilt to carry, wouldn't it?

581
00:34:58,656 --> 00:35:08,364
因为每次你看着你的女儿，相信我，你都会看到那个小女孩被埋在某处的沟里。
Because every time you look at your daughter, believe me, you are gonna see that little girl buried in a ditch somewhere.

582
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:13,737
这将会困扰你的余生。
And that will haunt you for the rest of your life.

583
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,523
好了，开始吧，尼克。
All right, here we go, Nick.

584
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:27,985
我们要制造一个足够大的能量光点来重启所有的监控摄像头。
We're going to create a power blip big enough to reboot all the security cameras.

585
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:33,691
一旦发生这种情况，你有4分10秒的时间在他们重新上线之前进入和退出。
Once that happens, you got exactly four minutes and ten seconds to get in and get out before they come back online.

586
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:39,789
——别忘了。-装好摄像头，走的时候再拿过来。
- Don't forget. - Set the cameras, and then grab them when you leave.

587
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:50,800
哦。该死，有人来了。
Uh-oh. Oh, shit, we got a guy coming.

588
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,334
尼克，守卫在路上。
Nick, guard on the way.

589
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:53,579
好了，尼克，保持冷静。
All right, Nick, stay calm.

590
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:55,071
就像我们说的那样。
Just like we talked about.

591
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:57,840
把致残剂从袋里拿出来。
Take the incapacitating agent out of the pouch.

592
00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:58,975
把它放在你的手里。
Put it in your hand.

593
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,610
去掉外层。
Remove the outer layer.

594
00:37:00,643 --> 00:37:02,645
内层有化学物质。
The inner layer has the chemical on it.

595
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,581
现在，如果你用这个碰别人的皮肤，他们几秒钟内就会死。
Now, if you touch that to someone's skin, they'll be out in seconds.

596
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,751
找个地方躲起来。
Now, find a place to hide.

597
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,587
这里没有藏身之处。
There's nowhere to hide in here.

598
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:13,623
等一等。
Hold on.

599
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,697
我想我可以躲在…我摸了摸自己的额头。
I think I can hide under the... I touched my forehead.

600
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:23,099
你摸了你的额头?
You touched your forehead?

601
00:37:23,132 --> 00:37:24,801
我想是的。我不是百分之百确定。
I think so. I'm not 100% sure.

602
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:26,334
你做了还是没做?
Did you or didn't you?

603
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:27,728
你知道吗?我想我没有。
You know what? I don't think I did.

604
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:33,643
我做到了。我做到了。
I did. I did.

605
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:35,477
尼克，现在听我说。
Nick, listen to me right now.

606
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,122
30秒后你就会流口水了。
You have 30 seconds until you're drooling on the floor.

607
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:39,982
回到袋子里，尽快拿到解药。
Go back into the pouch and get the antidote asap.

608
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,353
它是锁着的。
It's locked.

609
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:46,698
我们给你的钥匙呢?
Where's the key that we gave you?

610
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,025
里面有解药。
Inside with the antidote.

611
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,360
哦，该死的!好吧。哦,狗屎。好吧。
Oh, fuck this shit! Okay. Oh, shit. Okay.

612
00:37:55,865 --> 00:37:57,967
尼克，你左边有个窗户。
Okay, Nick, there's a window to your left.

613
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,536
从窗户出去，到外面，穿过窗台，好吗?
Go out that window, get outside, go across the ledge, okay?

614
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,932
爬过窗台，然后爬进保安室的窗户。
Scoot across the ledge, and then climb into the security room window.

615
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,653
你他妈有什么毛病?他在三层楼上。
What the fuck is wrong with you? He's three stories up.

616
00:38:07,677 --> 00:38:08,797
他喝得烂醉如泥。
He's stoned out of his mind.

617
00:38:12,982 --> 00:38:13,983
你好。
Hola.

618
00:38:15,818 --> 00:38:18,553
-快点，尼克!现在!-他越来越近了。
- Do it now, Nick! Now! - He's getting closer.

619
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,488
他是他妈的死了。他死了。
He's fucking dead. He's dead.

620
00:38:20,522 --> 00:38:23,091
马丁，我能听到你说话。
Martin, I can hear you.

621
00:38:34,669 --> 00:38:36,470
快点,尼克。你能做到的，好吗?
Come on, Nick. You can do this, okay?

622
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:38,505
继续前进。继续前进。
Keep moving. Keep moving.

623
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:41,508
你好吗?
Hola?

624
00:38:47,115 --> 00:38:49,718
我的腿没知觉了。
I can't feel my legs.

625
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:51,753
你知道，我真的很喜欢为中央情报局工作。
You know, I really enjoyed working for the CIA.

626
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:54,155
等不及要搬回家在索尼克工作了。
Can't wait to move back home and work at fucking Sonic.

627
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,891
狗屎!
Shit!

628
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,460
像橡胶。
Like rubber.

629
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:01,997
来吧，尼克，你能行的。继续,好吗?
Come on, Nick, you got this. Keep moving, okay?

630
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:08,870
等一等。房间里有个守卫。
Hold on. We got a guard in the room.

631
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:13,540
醒来的时候,尼克。
Wake up, Nick.

632
00:39:15,677 --> 00:39:17,679
好了，快，快，快，尼克。
Okay, go, go, go, Nick.

633
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:19,781
我爱你。
I love you.

634
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:22,050
和我呆在一起。保持清醒。
Stay with me. Stay awake.

635
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,152
继续前进。你可以做到的。
Keep moving. You can do this.

636
00:39:24,185 --> 00:39:25,654
现在把腿收起来。
Pull your legs in now.

637
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:26,988
把腿收起来。
Pull your legs in.

638
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,162
我不能移动。
I can't move.

639
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:36,097
然后你就会死。你想今晚就死吗?
Then you're gonna die. Do you wanna die tonight?

640
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:37,832
你不是这样死的。
This is not how you die.

641
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:39,634
我想是的。
I think it is.

642
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:50,712
来吧。
Come on.

643
00:39:50,745 --> 00:39:52,247
拜托，你做到了。你在那里。
Come on, you did it. You're in there.

644
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,882
去吧，去吧!保持清醒!
Do it, do it! Stay awake!

645
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:55,684
来吧!快点,尼克!
Come on! Come on, Nick!

646
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:58,119
来吧。来吧。
Come on. Come on.

647
00:39:58,153 --> 00:39:59,486
来吧。你明白了。
Come on. You got it.

648
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,022
你明白了。你明白了。
You got it. You got it.

649
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:02,190
你明白了。你明白了。
You got it. You got it.

650
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:06,995
看在上帝的份上，伙计!醒醒吧!
Oh, for fuck's sake, man! Wake up!

651
00:40:07,028 --> 00:40:08,139
——醒来。——醒来。
- Wake up. - Wake up.

652
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:09,864
起床,尼克。起床了。
Get up, Nick. Get up.

653
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:10,999
起床了。
Get up.

654
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:12,968
快点,尼克。
Come on, Nick.

655
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:15,136
来吧!起来!
Come on! Get up!

656
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,537
起床,尼克。
Get up, Nick.

657
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:21,742
行动!
Action!

658
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:28,048
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my god!

659
00:40:28,082 --> 00:40:29,683
是的!
Yes!

660
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:31,752
-他怎么样了?——训练演员。
- How is he up? - Trained actor.

661
00:40:31,785 --> 00:40:33,287
好了，伙计，我们加入。
All right, man, we in.

662
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,924
那样背叛哈维，感觉不太好。
You know, it didn't feel great betraying Javi like that.

663
00:40:36,957 --> 00:40:39,893
尤其是，我还不确定他就是你要找的人。
Especially, since I'm still not convinced he's your guy.

664
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:42,939
但奇怪的是……我能预见自己会做更多这样的事。
But the strange thing is... I can see myself doing more of this stuff.

665
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:44,698
你知道的，间谍技术。
You know, spy craft.

666
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:46,900
托词。你有什么。
Subterfuge. What have you.

667
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:48,669
我觉得我可能有这方面的天赋。
I think I might have a real gift for it.

668
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:50,637
很好，因为我们有另一个任务给你。
Good, 'cause we got another mission for you.

669
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:53,107
不,不,不!去他的吧!
No, no, no! Fuck that!

670
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,875
这是可怕的。
It was terrifying.

671
00:40:54,908 --> 00:41:02,583
派对结束后我要去机场，所以…尼克，我们的情报显示哈维现在把玛丽亚·德尔加多关在院子里。
I'm about to leave for the airport after the party, so... Nick, our intel suggests that Javi is holding Maria delgado on the compound right now.

672
00:41:02,616 --> 00:41:04,084
在复合吗?是的。
On the compound? Yeah.

673
00:41:04,118 --> 00:41:05,786
我们需要你帮我们找到她。
We need you to help us find her.

674
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:08,989
所以我们需要你想办法多待一会儿。
Which means we need you to figure out a way to stay a little longer.

675
00:41:09,023 --> 00:41:12,926
薇薇安，我做不到。
Vivian, I can't do this.

676
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,962
是的,你可以。我们刚刚看到你这么做了。
Yes, you can. We just saw you do it.

677
00:41:15,896 --> 00:41:17,297
那个小女孩，尼克?
That little girl, Nick?

678
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:18,899
她没有别人了。
She doesn't have anybody else.

679
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:21,835
只有你。
Just you.

680
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,641
如果你走了，我不知道她会怎么样。
And if you leave, I don't know what's gonna happen to her.

681
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:45,993
我想感谢大家今晚的到来。
I just want to thank you all for coming tonight.

682
00:41:46,026 --> 00:41:48,095
这对我的意义超乎你的想象。
It means more to me than you can know.

683
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:50,264
我想讲一个故事。
And I would like to tell a story.

684
00:41:51,198 --> 00:42:00,040
几年前，我和父亲的关系恶化到了不再说话的地步。
A few years ago, my relationship with my father had deteriorated to the point where we were no longer speaking.

685
00:42:00,074 --> 00:42:02,843
我的父亲可能很难相处。
He could be extremely difficult, my father.

686
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:04,745
说句公道话，也许我也好不到哪里去。
And to be fair, maybe I am not much better.

687
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:16,823
但当他生病时，我意识到我不想在我们修复破裂的关系之前失去他。
But when he got sick, I realized I didn't want to lose him before we could repair our broken relationship.

688
00:42:17,924 --> 00:42:19,225
但我不知道该怎么做。
But I didn't know how.

689
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:24,897
然后，有一天，大约在他死前一周，事情发生了。
And then, one day, about a week before he died, it happened.

690
00:42:24,931 --> 00:42:26,032
一个奇迹。
A miracle.

691
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:28,000
我抬头一看……
I looked up...

692
00:42:30,436 --> 00:42:36,709
我在医院的小电视上看到…保护苔丝。
And I saw on a tiny little hospital TV... Guarding Tess.

693
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:40,847
我和父亲几乎在所有事情上都有分歧。
We disagreed about literally everything, my father and I.

694
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,148
除了这部电影。
Except for this movie.

695
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:45,318
我们都很喜欢。
We both loved it.

696
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:48,287
我们会反复引用它。
We would quote it back and forth.

697
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:51,424
在某种程度上，我父亲就是苔丝。
In a way, my father was Tess.

698
00:42:51,457 --> 00:42:52,925
前第一夫人。
The former first lady.

699
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:55,895
我是道格·切斯尼克。
And I was Doug chesnic.

700
00:42:55,928 --> 00:42:58,798
负责照顾他的特勤局特工。
The secret service agent charged with taking care of him.

701
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:04,837
那部电影让我们走到了一起。
That movie brought us together.

702
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:10,910
所以，我代表我已故的父亲和我自己，
So, on behalf of my late father and myself,

703
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:14,313
我想谢谢你。
I want to thank you.

704
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:23,322
我打赌你不知道道格·切斯尼克能对一个人产生如此大的影响。
I bet you didn't know Doug chesnic could have such an impact on someone.

705
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:26,859
道格是个复杂的人。
Well, Doug was a complicated guy.

706
00:43:26,893 --> 00:43:38,404
他有相互竞争的忠诚有时候，像他这样的角色会让他付出代价。
He had, um, competing allegiances and sometimes, being in the skin of a character like that can take its toll.

707
00:43:38,437 --> 00:43:39,939
谢谢你的牺牲。
Well, thank you for your sacrifice.

708
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:41,274
这是非凡的。
It was extraordinary.

709
00:43:41,307 --> 00:43:43,009
谢谢你们邀请我。
Thank you for having me.

710
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,745
和我……
And I'm...

711
00:43:48,748 --> 00:44:00,760
我…我很激动地宣布，哈维终于允许我读他的剧本了，太棒了。
I'm... Excited to announce that Javi has finally allowed me to read his screenplay which is fantastic.

712
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:02,795
这是真正的大师班。
It's truly a masterclass.

713
00:44:02,828 --> 00:44:05,398
这无疑是我多年来读过的最好的书之一。
It's easily one of the best things I've read in years.

714
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:07,400
所以，这意味着你想加入吗?
So, does that mean that you want to be in it?

715
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:08,467
我不喜欢。
I don't.

716
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:17,442
但是我想在这里花更多的时间和你们在这个化合物上。
But what I would like is to spend a little more time here on the compound with you.

717
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:21,479
拿出我们自己的…电影。
Coming up with our own... Movie.

718
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:23,315
你说呢?
What do you say?

719
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:27,352
我说是。
I say yes.

720
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:30,755
是的。
Yes.

721
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:38,163
我解雇了伯爵。
I fired Earl.

722
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:39,373
-这已经发生两次了。——没有。
- This has happened twice now. - No.

723
00:44:39,397 --> 00:44:43,301
他是特勤局雇用的司机。
He is a driver in the employ of the secret service.

724
00:44:43,335 --> 00:44:44,779
我对厨师和护士无能为力。
I can't do anything about the cook or the nurse.

725
00:44:44,803 --> 00:44:46,271
不，他们为你工作。
No, they work for you.

726
00:44:46,304 --> 00:44:48,039
但这家伙是我们的人，他走了!
But this guy works for us and he's gone!

727
00:44:52,344 --> 00:44:54,179
尼克。
Nick.

728
00:44:54,212 --> 00:44:56,390
监控录像给了我们玛丽亚的可能位置。
The security cameras gave us a probable location for Maria.

729
00:44:56,414 --> 00:44:59,084
我现在就发给你。
I'm sending it to you now.

730
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:00,752
想办法进入那个房间，尼克。
Find a way to get into that room, Nick.

731
00:45:05,257 --> 00:45:06,258
笼子里先生。
Mr. Cage.

732
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:09,394
哦,嘿,杰维。尼克。
Oh, hey, Javi. Nick.

733
00:45:09,427 --> 00:45:17,435
我意识到，如果我们要创作一件艺术作品，我们不能只是坐在那里盯着屏幕。
I realized that if we are going to create a work of art, we can't just sit and stare at a screen.

734
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:22,540
我们必须敞开心扉去探索宇宙所提供的无限可能。
We have to open our minds to the infinite possibilities of what the cosmos has to offer.

735
00:45:24,442 --> 00:45:25,910
你拿的是什么?
What have you got there?

736
00:45:25,944 --> 00:45:27,445
神圣的灵感。
Divine inspiration.

737
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:29,514
LSD。
LSD.

738
00:45:35,954 --> 00:45:37,956
他妈的烦!
Fuck it!

739
00:45:57,275 --> 00:46:01,112
所以，我在想也许我们的电影应该以角色为导向。
So, I was thinking that maybe our movie would be character-driven.

740
00:46:01,146 --> 00:46:02,914
是的。
Yeah.

741
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:06,518
不依赖老掉牙的特效。
Something that doesn't rely on corny special effects.

742
00:46:06,552 --> 00:46:09,019
正确的。或者像大爆炸。
Right. Or like big explosions.

743
00:46:09,053 --> 00:46:10,555
它必须细致入微。
It has to be nuanced.

744
00:46:10,588 --> 00:46:12,523
并且在多个层面上工作。
And work on multiple levels.

745
00:46:12,557 --> 00:46:15,326
它应该完全与性能有关。
It should be completely about performance.

746
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:21,165
也许这只是毒品在说话，但如果我们有一个大的毒品场景呢?
And maybe it's just the drugs talking, but what if we had like a big drug scene?

747
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:24,301
哦,哇!
Oh, wow!

748
00:46:25,936 --> 00:46:28,005
一定会很棒的。
It's gonna be so fucking good.

749
00:46:30,307 --> 00:46:33,578
但是，它是关于什么的?
But, like, what's it about?

750
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:44,355
就类型而言，我喜欢喜剧。
In terms of genre, I like comedies.

751
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:47,524
但当只有两个人坐在一起聊天的时候就不一样了。
But not when it's just two people sitting around talking.

752
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,261
天啊，我受不了喜剧。
Oh, man, I can't stand talkie comedies.

753
00:46:51,295 --> 00:46:53,631
你必须有一些情节来推动它向前发展。
You gotta have some plot to drive it forward.

754
00:47:01,004 --> 00:47:02,005
这是我的女儿。
It's my daughter.

755
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:03,440
哦。
Oh.

756
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,890
尼克,听。
Nick, listen.

757
00:47:21,191 --> 00:47:23,427
你知道我在想什么吗?
You know what I was thinking?

758
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,530
也许我们可以从偏执狂惊悚的角度。
Maybe we could have, like, a paranoid thriller-y angle.

759
00:47:26,564 --> 00:47:30,167
哦。偏执的角度。太好了。
Ooh. Paranoid angle. Excellent.

760
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,600
看到那边那两个家伙了吗?
Like, see those two guys over there?

761
00:47:33,504 --> 00:47:34,639
他们一直在监视我们。
They've been watching us.

762
00:47:34,672 --> 00:47:36,106
正确的。正确的。
Right. Right.

763
00:47:38,308 --> 00:47:40,144
等等，他们一直在监视我们吗?
Wait, have they been watching us?

764
00:47:40,177 --> 00:47:42,146
我不知道。有他们吗?
I don't know. Have they?

765
00:47:44,548 --> 00:47:47,384
他妈的!
Fuck!

766
00:47:47,418 --> 00:47:49,386
你看到了吗?他们只是看着我们。
Did you see that? They just looked over at us.

767
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,422
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

768
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:54,024
哦,狗屎!这是怎么呢
Oh, shit! What's going on?

769
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:55,468
不,不,不。也许这只是一个巧合。
No, no, no. Maybe it was just a coincidence.

770
00:47:55,492 --> 00:47:56,960
我再看看。你准备好了吗?
I will look again. Are you ready?

771
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:58,195
不!不要有眼神交流。
No! Don't make eye contact.

772
00:47:58,228 --> 00:47:59,664
这样才能吓到他们。
That's how you spook them.

773
00:47:59,697 --> 00:48:01,733
不，这样才能吓到熊。
No, that's how you spook a bear.

774
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:04,034
这是正确的。这样才能吓到一只熊。
That's right. That is how you spook a bear.

775
00:48:04,067 --> 00:48:05,636
我道歉。
I apologize.

776
00:48:05,669 --> 00:48:09,038
但如果你要看的话，可能会喜欢假笑。
But if you are gonna look, maybe do like a fake laugh.

777
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:10,707
一个假笑?好的,很好。是的。
A fake laugh? Okay, good. Yeah.

778
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:20,216
哦,不。
Oh, no.

779
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:28,592
好吧,好吧。让我们……我们数到三慢慢站起来，然后跑。
Okay, okay. Let's... Let's just get up slowly on the count of three and run.

780
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,159
好吧?
Okay?

781
00:48:30,193 --> 00:48:33,262
一个……哦,他妈的!
One... Oh, fuck!

782
00:48:38,635 --> 00:48:40,036
走,走,走!
Go, go, go!

783
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:42,205
快!
Faster!

784
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:45,308
这太他妈疯狂了。
This is fucking crazy.

785
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:47,611
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

786
00:48:47,644 --> 00:48:48,712
这是太高了。
It's too high.

787
00:48:48,745 --> 00:48:50,246
在这里。
Here.

788
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:53,516
把我当人的大便吧。
Use me as a human stool.

789
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:55,619
做到!
Do it!

790
00:49:04,327 --> 00:49:05,328
抓住我的手。
Grab my hand.

791
00:49:06,162 --> 00:49:07,163
抓住它。
Grab it.

792
00:49:11,133 --> 00:49:12,401
你比看上去重多了。
You're heavier than you look.

793
00:49:16,472 --> 00:49:17,674
我有一个很大的头。
I have a very big head.

794
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:20,076
巨大的。一个巨大的头。
Enormous. An enormous head.

795
00:49:22,378 --> 00:49:24,681
我撑不过去了，对吧?
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

796
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,583
你能告诉加布里埃拉我会想她吗?
Will you tell Gabriela I will miss her?

797
00:49:26,617 --> 00:49:28,484
你可以自己告诉她。不。
You can tell her yourself. No.

798
00:49:28,518 --> 00:49:31,153
没关系。你去好好生活吧。
It's okay. You go live a good life.

799
00:49:31,187 --> 00:49:32,532
没有你我哪也不去!
I'm not going anywhere without you!

800
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:35,224
现在，抓住我的手，士兵!
Now, grab my hand, soldier!

801
00:49:41,297 --> 00:49:45,134
但那样的话，我们都会死在那之后我就再也无法忍受自己了。
But then, we will both die and I could never live with myself after that.

802
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:46,402
所以你放手了。
So you let go.

803
00:49:47,503 --> 00:49:48,504
你放手!
You let go!

804
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:57,179
再见,尼古拉斯凯奇。
Goodbye, Nicolas cage.

805
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:02,083
我永远不会忘记你的，爪哇。
I'll never forget you, javs.

806
00:50:02,117 --> 00:50:03,553
我永远不会忘记你。
I'll never forget you.

807
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,389
现在你给我滚出去。
Now, you get the hell out of here.

808
00:50:09,324 --> 00:50:11,059
你走吧!
You go!

809
00:50:23,138 --> 00:50:24,272
笼子里的先生吗?
Mr. Cage?

810
00:50:26,241 --> 00:50:27,242
杰维吗?
Javi?

811
00:50:28,343 --> 00:50:29,679
好友!嘿。
Buddy! Hey.

812
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,847
你从哪里来?
Where'd you come from?

813
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:34,149
哦。
Oh.

814
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:39,665
是的…原来我们可以随便走走。
Yeah... Turns out we could have just walked around.

815
00:50:39,689 --> 00:50:41,757
是啊，我想是吧?无论什么。
Yeah, I guess so, huh? Whatever.

816
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:44,860
他们在那。
There they are.

817
00:50:46,528 --> 00:50:48,864
哦,狗屎!哦,狗屎!快跑!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Run!

818
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,568
你看到他们了吗?
Do you see 'em?

819
00:50:52,602 --> 00:50:54,770
哦,他妈的!哦!
Oh, fuck! Oh!

820
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:56,137
狗屎!
Shit!

821
00:50:57,405 --> 00:50:58,406
嗷,嗷。
Ow, ow.

822
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:04,446
不,不。我不能服用迷幻药开车。我不能服用迷幻药开车。
No, no. I can't drive on acid. I can't drive on acid.

823
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:05,681
你必须服用迷幻药才能开车。
You have to drive on acid.

824
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:07,248
你开车比我好。
You are a better driver than me.

825
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:08,918
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

826
00:51:08,951 --> 00:51:11,687
因为我听说你在一分钟内完成了所有的驾驶特技。
Because I read that you did all of your own driving stunts in gone in 60 seconds.

827
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:14,289
嗯,这是真的。我的后轮车开得不错，对吧?
Well, that's true. I popped some good wheelies, right?

828
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:16,626
前轮轮是惊人的。现在开车吧!
The wheelies are amazing. Now drive the car!

829
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:18,526
他们来了!我们走吧!
They're coming! Let's go!

830
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:33,843
哦。神圣的狗屎!什么?
Oh. Holy shit! What?

831
00:51:33,876 --> 00:51:35,276
神圣的狗屎!
Holy shit!

832
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:36,344
什么?你看到他们了吗?
What? Do you see 'em?

833
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:39,214
不，尼克，我有个主意。
No, Nick, I have an idea.

834
00:51:39,247 --> 00:51:41,917
也许这部电影，也许是关于这个的。
Maybe this movie, maybe it's about this.

835
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,586
关于我们。
About us.

836
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:45,453
我们的关系。
Our relationship.

837
00:51:47,556 --> 00:51:48,624
这很好。
That's good.

838
00:51:50,325 --> 00:51:51,426
这很好。
That's good.

839
00:52:28,997 --> 00:52:30,632
有人在里面吗?
Is anyone in there?

840
00:52:30,665 --> 00:52:31,800
你好吗?
Hola?

841
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:32,834
喂?
Hello?

842
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:35,536
喂?
Hello?

843
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:41,408
你想让我让你进去吗?
You want me to let you in there, huh?

844
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:43,912
我做的事。
I do.

845
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:46,548
我想知道里面是什么。
I wanna know what's inside.

846
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:48,750
不顾后果吗?
Regardless of what the consequences are?

847
00:52:58,059 --> 00:53:03,765
因为一旦你进去，可能会改变你对我的感觉。
Because once you go in there, it could change the way you feel about me.

848
00:53:10,004 --> 00:53:12,841
我们的关系可能会改变，尼克·凯奇。
Our entire relationship could change, Nick cage.

849
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,311
我要进去，jav。
I need to go in, jav.

850
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,981
开门。
Open the door.

851
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:51,545
是不是太多了?
Is it too much?

852
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,581
迷糊了。
Trippy.

853
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,349
迷糊了。
Trippy.

854
00:53:56,382 --> 00:53:58,852
——我知道。-如果有点奇怪，我很抱歉。
- I know. - I am sorry if it is weird.

855
00:53:58,886 --> 00:54:00,854
嗯，这是一个很好的收藏。
Well, it's a good collection.

856
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:04,925
很彻底。
It's very thorough.

857
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:08,028
“一串非常优雅的珍珠配置。”
"A really elegant string of pearls configuration."

858
00:54:09,096 --> 00:54:10,363
那块小石头。
The rock.

859
00:54:10,396 --> 00:54:13,033
“把兔子放回盒子里。”
"Put the bunny back in the box."

860
00:54:13,066 --> 00:54:14,500
空中监狱。
Con air.

861
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:19,573
好吧，那真的很恐怖。
Well, that's just really creepy.

862
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:21,074
不，一点也不恐怖。
No, it's not creepy.

863
00:54:21,108 --> 00:54:22,542
哦。
Oh.

864
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:23,977
那是曼迪送的电锯吗?
Is that the chainsaw from Mandy?

865
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,078
曼迪是一个杰作。
Mandy is a masterpiece.

866
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,882
你知道那些是真枪吧?
You know those are real guns, right?

867
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,584
它们当然是真实的。
Of course they are real.

868
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,956
定制的斯普林菲尔德军械库。
Custom Springfield armory.

869
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:38,959
专门为这部电影制作的。
Made specifically for the film.

870
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:40,861
这是我吗?
Is this supposed to be me?

871
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:44,631
这是……怪诞。
It's... Grotesque.

872
00:54:44,665 --> 00:54:46,867
看看这些枪。
Just look at the guns.

873
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:53,874
如果你不介意我问的话，你花了多少钱买了这个令人不安的雕像?
If you don't mind me asking, how much did you pay for this disturbing statue?

874
00:54:53,907 --> 00:54:56,109
嗯。约6000美元。
Hmm. About $6,000.

875
00:54:57,811 --> 00:54:59,646
我给你2万美元。
I'll give you $20,000 for it.

876
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:06,019
抱歉，凯奇先生，这是非卖品。
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage, but this is not for sale.

877
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:15,528
-坏消息。-女孩不在那儿。
- Bad news. - Girl's not there.

878
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,632
好消息。脚本的烹饪。
Good news. Script's cooking.

879
00:55:18,665 --> 00:55:22,468
感觉就像电影里的伊纳里多加上一点冯提尔的影子。
Feels like cassavetes meets inarritu with a dash of Von trier.

880
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:24,838
尼克,但是……我知道你要说什么。
Nick, but... I know what you're gonna say.

881
00:55:24,872 --> 00:55:30,409
哈维有他的问题，但是，我的天，他对故事的直觉令人难以置信。
Javi has his issues but, my god, he has an unbelievably intuitive sense for story.

882
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:32,045
他绑架了一个年轻女孩。
He kidnapped a young girl.

883
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,618
每过一天，她被哈维或他的手下谋杀的可能性就会增加。
And every day that passes, the likelihood goes up that she's gonna be murdered by Javi or one of his men.

884
00:55:38,886 --> 00:55:40,519
你现在想让我做什么?
What do you want me to do now?

885
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:41,722
我不知道。
I don't know.

886
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,790
我还在琢磨。
I'm still figuring that out.

887
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:48,095
但现在，你为什么不给你的电影加一条有人被绑架的情节呢?
But for now, why don't you add a plotline to your movie where someone gets kidnapped?

888
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:51,964
这样你就能知道，理论上，他可能把人质藏在哪。
That way you can see where he might, theoretically, hide a hostage.

889
00:55:51,998 --> 00:55:53,866
我在这里做两份工作。
I'm working two jobs here.

890
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:55,701
好吧。
Okay.

891
00:55:57,703 --> 00:56:05,878
薇薇安，这是一个接地气的成人戏剧，关于两个强硬，敏感的男人和他们不太可能的友谊。
Vivian, this is a grounded, adult drama about two tough, sensitive men and their unlikely friendship.

892
00:56:05,912 --> 00:56:07,623
他们有点像在和基督人物决斗。
They're kind of like dueling Christ figures.

893
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:11,183
这本身就是一个很有革命性的想法。
Which is obviously a pretty revolutionary idea in itself.

894
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:16,689
但不是革命性的想法就是绑架。
But what is not A revolutionary idea is a kidnapping.

895
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:19,801
如果我把这事牵扯进来，哈维就会知道出事了。
And if I bring that into the mix, Javi's gonna know something's up.

896
00:56:19,825 --> 00:56:23,095
他语气强硬，这次任务会失败的。好吧?
He's a hardliner for tone, and this mission will be blown. Okay?

897
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,864
基督耶稣他妈的!
Jesus fucking Christ!

898
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:33,005
尼克，我觉得绑架能让这部电影更有吸引力。
You know, Nick, I think a kidnapping could give this movie a wider appeal.

899
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,541
我是说，现在很难找到观众，对吧?
I mean, it's pretty hard to find an audience these days, right?

900
00:56:36,575 --> 00:56:38,911
除非你是漫威电影，星球大战之类的。
Unless you're a marvel movie, star wars, whatever, yeah.

901
00:56:38,945 --> 00:56:40,255
是啊，听起来不是这样的。
Yeah, doesn't sound like this is that.

902
00:56:40,279 --> 00:56:41,747
不，薇薇安，不是。
No, Vivian, it isn't.

903
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,916
这是一部适合成年人观看的智慧电影。
This is an intelligent film for grown-ups.

904
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:52,158
就我个人而言，我想要一部聪明的，以角色为导向的，关于真实生活，真实人物的成人电影。
Now, personally, I want a smart, character-driven, adult drama about real life, real people.

905
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:57,930
但现实是，大多数人都需要一些诱饵才能进入影院。
But the reality is, most people need a bit of a hook to get 'em into the theater.

906
00:56:57,964 --> 00:56:59,632
好吧，现在你在谈论市场营销。
Okay, now you're talking about marketing.

907
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:03,970
如果你说的是市场营销，那么，是的，你确实需要一个吸引他们进入影院的诱饵。
And if you're talking about marketing, then, yes, you do need a hook to get them into the theater.

908
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,038
好吧，带他们去剧院。来吧。
Well, get 'em into the theater. Come on.

909
00:57:06,072 --> 00:57:08,473
你只需要一个预告片。
All you need is a trailer moment.

910
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:10,475
拉!
Pull!

911
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:16,615
等一下，等一下。你女儿被绑架了?
Hold on, hold on. Your daughter gets kidnapped?

912
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:18,050
是的，这是一个重要的拖车时刻。
Yeah, it's a big trailer moment.

913
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:19,585
嘿，我这么做对吗?
Hey, am I doing this right?

914
00:57:19,618 --> 00:57:20,996
因为那东西在我的视线里。
'Cause I had that thing in my sights.

915
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,088
但是谁绑架了她?
But who kidnaps her?

916
00:57:22,121 --> 00:57:23,589
呃，可能是桶变形了。
Uh, maybe the barrel's warped.

917
00:57:23,622 --> 00:57:24,633
枪管肯定没有翘曲。
The barrel is definitely not warped.

918
00:57:24,657 --> 00:57:25,658
谁绑架她?
Who kidnaps her?

919
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:27,660
坏蛋。
Bad guys.

920
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:32,174
我们都冒着生命危险去救女儿，并因此成为更好的人。
We both put our lives on the line to save the daughter and become better men for it.

921
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,766
它的经典。
It's classic.

922
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:34,843
这感觉像是一部完全不同的电影。
It feels like a completely different movie.

923
00:57:34,867 --> 00:57:36,202
杰维,请。
Javi, please.

924
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:37,970
跟我一起走下去吧。
Just walk down the road with me on this.

925
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:39,672
然后呢?
And then what?

926
00:57:39,705 --> 00:57:42,775
大结局是两个男人救了那个女孩?
The finale is about two men saving the girl?

927
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:44,143
这是可怕的。
That's terrible.

928
00:57:44,176 --> 00:57:45,644
把枪给我。
Give me the gun.

929
00:57:47,747 --> 00:57:49,513
你知道投篮好关键是什么吗?
You know the key to shooting well?

930
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:52,584
控制你的呼吸。
Controlling your breath.

931
00:57:54,252 --> 00:57:56,187
你知道怎么控制呼吸吗，尼克?
And you know how to control your breath, Nick?

932
00:57:57,222 --> 00:57:58,623
你的心。
Your heart.

933
00:57:58,656 --> 00:58:01,259
你的心必须静止。
Your heart must be still.

934
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:02,627
安宁。
At peace.

935
00:58:03,962 --> 00:58:07,098
我的心不平静。
My heart is not still.

936
00:58:07,132 --> 00:58:09,934
我的心不安宁。
My heart is not at peace.

937
00:58:13,705 --> 00:58:14,873
你知道为什么吗?
Do you know why?

938
00:58:14,906 --> 00:58:16,241
嘿,杰维。
Hey, Javi.

939
00:58:16,274 --> 00:58:18,777
如果你不开枪，不如把枪给我?
If you're not gonna shoot, maybe hand me the gun?

940
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:20,278
因为你在骗我。
Because you're lying to me.

941
00:58:20,311 --> 00:58:21,346
什么?
What?

942
00:58:21,379 --> 00:58:24,849
别他妈骗我。
Don't fucking lie to me.

943
00:58:24,883 --> 00:58:25,950
我不是!
I'm not!

944
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:28,686
别他妈骗我!
Don't fucking lie to me!

945
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,321
天啊，我没有!我发誓!
Oh, my god, I'm not! I swear!

946
00:58:30,355 --> 00:58:32,857
我知道你为什么一直在说这个被绑架的女孩。
I know why you keep on talking about this kidnapped girl.

947
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:37,095
你对自己和亲生女儿的关系感到内疚。
You feel guilty about your relationship to your own daughter.

948
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:41,266
天啊，是的。
Oh, my god, yes.

949
00:58:41,299 --> 00:58:43,868
一千次，是的。你被屏蔽。
A thousand times, yes. You are blocked.

950
00:58:43,902 --> 00:58:45,804
创造性的。
Creatively.

951
00:58:45,837 --> 00:58:49,007
因为你对自己是一个什么样的父亲感到内疚。
Because you feel guilty about what kind of father you have been.

952
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,109
你是对的。是的。
You're right. Yep.

953
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:52,177
你是100%正确的。
You're 100% right.

954
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,278
拉!
Pull!

955
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:15,266
薇薇安，怎么了?
Vivian, what's going on?

956
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,669
尼克，你得马上离开那栋房子。
Nick, you need to get out of that house immediately.

957
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:19,671
中情局窃听了我们的电话。
The agency caught a wiretap on our phones.

958
00:59:19,704 --> 00:59:21,339
然后我遇到一个跟踪我的人。
Then I picked up a guy tailing me.

959
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:23,942
如果他们造了我，那你也有可能。
If they've made me, they've likely made you.

960
00:59:23,975 --> 00:59:25,376
好吧。大便。
All right. Shit.

961
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,645
尼克，我们不能再保证你的安全了。
Nick, we can no longer guarantee your safety.

962
00:59:29,714 --> 00:59:30,748
耶稣基督!
Jesus Christ!

963
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:32,050
你吓死我了。
You scared the hell out of me.

964
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:35,253
尼克，我需要你跟我走。
Nick, I need you to come with me.

965
00:59:37,755 --> 00:59:38,823
现在好些了吗?
Right now?

966
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,362
我很抱歉不得不这么做，尼克。
I'm sorry to have to take this step, Nick.

967
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:48,298
-但你没有。-你真的不知道。
- You don't, though. - You really don't.

968
00:59:48,332 --> 00:59:50,033
不，这是唯一的选择。
No, it is the only option.

969
00:59:51,468 --> 00:59:54,238
我能尽快给家人打个电话吗?
Can I just call my family quickly?

970
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:55,806
告诉他们我爱他们。
Tell them I love them.

971
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,774
什么?
What?

972
00:59:57,808 --> 00:59:59,776
没必要打电话给他们。
There's no need to call them.

973
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:00,844
他们都在这里。
They are here.

974
01:00:02,112 --> 01:00:03,180
爸爸。尼克。
Dad. Nick.

975
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:06,083
你还好吗?什么……这到底是怎么回事?
Are you okay? What... What the hell is going on?

976
01:00:06,116 --> 01:00:09,052
你朋友打电话说你病得很重，不能说话。
Your friend called to say you were so sick you couldn't talk.

977
01:00:09,086 --> 01:00:10,954
我们都很担心你。是的。
We're worried about you. Yeah.

978
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:12,866
你想跟我算账吗，哈维?你来对付我。
You wanna deal with me, Javi? You deal with me.

979
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:15,859
但我求你了，求你别把我家人扯进来。
But I'm begging you, please, please leave my family out of this.

980
01:00:15,893 --> 01:00:17,103
不幸的是，我不能那样做。
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

981
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:18,228
你让我别无选择。
You've left me no choice.

982
01:00:18,262 --> 01:00:20,430
你要死了吗，爸爸?是的。
Are you dying, dad? Yes.

983
01:00:20,464 --> 01:00:21,732
哦,我的上帝。什么?
Oh, my god. What?

984
01:00:21,765 --> 01:00:23,367
创造性的。哦,来吧。
Creatively. Oh, come on.

985
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,968
不，他的身体非常棒。
No, physically, he is tremendous.

986
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:27,804
我是说，他可能会活得比我们都长。
I mean, he will probably outlive us all.

987
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:29,439
所以你根本没生病?
So, you're not even sick?

988
01:00:29,473 --> 01:00:30,874
我很好,亲爱的。
I'm okay, honey.

989
01:00:30,908 --> 01:00:32,709
我很好。我很好。去你妈的。
I'm fine. I'm okay. Fuck you.

990
01:00:32,743 --> 01:00:35,379
听着，我已经非常关心你父亲了。
Look, I have grown to care very deeply about your father.

991
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:36,980
和前夫。
And ex-husband.

992
01:00:37,014 --> 01:00:38,382
我们在一起拍电影。
We are working on a movie together.

993
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:42,753
一个美丽的角色驱动的成人戏剧。
A beautiful character-driven, adult drama.

994
01:00:42,786 --> 01:00:50,127
但他和你之间有太多未解决的问题，这开始以一种消极的方式渗透到工作中。
But he has so many unresolved issues with you that it is beginning to bleed into the work in a negative way.

995
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,328
对吗，尼克?
Isn't that right, Nick?

996
01:00:51,361 --> 01:00:53,897
你们都他妈疯了吗?
Are you both out of your fucking minds?

997
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:55,799
你看，他有很多遗憾。
Well, you see, he has so many regrets.

998
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:58,435
是的。好吧，还有一个要加到列表里。
Yeah. Well, here is another one to add to the list.

999
01:00:58,468 --> 01:01:00,003
我们坐过飞机。
We've been on a plane.

1000
01:01:00,404 --> 01:01:02,039
所有的一天!
All day!

1001
01:01:02,072 --> 01:01:03,240
我不得不取消客户。
I had to cancel clients.

1002
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:05,909
我们很恐慌，因为我们找不到人来喂猫。
We were panicking because we couldn't find anyone to feed the cats.

1003
01:01:05,943 --> 01:01:09,012
你知道吗，等我们完事回家他们可能已经死了。
You know, they could be dead by the time we get home after this bullshit.

1004
01:01:09,046 --> 01:01:11,014
房子闻起来像只死猫。太好了。
House smelling like a dead cat. That's great.

1005
01:01:11,048 --> 01:01:12,416
这是有趣的。
That's fun.

1006
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:14,251
我曾经有只猫死在厨房里。
Well, I had a cat die in the kitchen once.

1007
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:18,188
而我的祖母永远也摆脱不掉那股气味。
And my grandmother was never able to get rid of the smell.

1008
01:01:18,222 --> 01:01:21,358
很抱歉给您带来不便，但这是紧急情况。
I am very sorry for the inconvenience, but this is an emergency.

1009
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:23,527
和我们一起吃午饭吧。
Have lunch with us.

1010
01:01:23,561 --> 01:01:25,262
让他说他想说的。
And let him say what he has to say.

1011
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:27,030
你不觉得这是个好主意吗，尼克?
Don't you think that's a good idea, Nick?

1012
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:33,503
午餐是个好主意，哈维。
Lunch is a wonderful idea, Javi.

1013
01:01:33,537 --> 01:01:36,873
之后，他们就可以回家了，对吧?
And then, afterwards, they can go home, right?

1014
01:01:39,009 --> 01:01:40,210
太好了。
Great.

1015
01:01:40,244 --> 01:01:41,944
我们吃点西班牙小吃吧。
Let's have some fucking tapas.

1016
01:01:43,547 --> 01:01:45,047
这太奇怪了。
This is so weird.

1017
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:48,851
是的,嗯…这是……你期待什么?
Yeah, well... that's... What'd you expect?

1018
01:01:50,152 --> 01:01:52,955
我想向你们两个道歉。
I wanna apologize to both of you.

1019
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:59,028
我想我在家的时候应该多陪陪她。
I think I should have been more present while I was at home.

1020
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:03,399
我不需要总是专注于我的工作。
I didn't always need to be focused on my work.

1021
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:05,935
我在剧本里的脸。
My face in a script.

1022
01:02:07,903 --> 01:02:11,107
但这是我一直想说的。
But here's what I keep coming back to.

1023
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:16,112
你们有谁想阻止我实现我的艺术梦想吗?
Would either of you have wanted to prevent me from living my artistic dreams?

1024
01:02:16,145 --> 01:02:20,349
因为我很清楚我不希望你们俩那样。
Because I sure know I wouldn't have wanted that for either of you.

1025
01:02:24,153 --> 01:02:26,222
我们飞到马略卡岛就是为了这个?
We flew to majorca for that?

1026
01:02:26,255 --> 01:02:27,857
哇。
Wow.

1027
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,425
真他妈可悲。
That was fucking pathetic.

1028
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:31,127
天啊，真的是这样，不是吗?
God, it really was, wasn't it?

1029
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,600
不,不,不。我真的无言以对。
No, no, no. I am honestly speechless.

1030
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:35,331
真的吗?因为这种事，你会习惯的。
Really? Because this shit, you get used to it.

1031
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:37,166
是啊，这是意料之中的事。
Yeah, that's pretty much par for the course.

1032
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:38,234
嗯。
Mmm-hmm.

1033
01:02:40,236 --> 01:02:45,308
我们就不能专注于我们一起度过的美好时光吗?
Can't we just focus on the good times we did have together?

1034
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:48,844
艾迪，我们穿越沙漠的那次旅行。
Addy, that trip we took across the desert.

1035
01:02:48,878 --> 01:02:55,552
我以前从没给你看过这个，但我把这张小照片放在我的钱包里，提醒我我们有过的所有乐趣。
I never showed you this before, but I keep this little photo in my wallet to remind me of all the fun we had.

1036
01:02:56,352 --> 01:03:04,594
我知道不是很好，但那首歌…我指的是我写那首歌的那一刻。
And, uh, I know it wasn't great, but that song... I meant that moment that I wrote in that song.

1037
01:03:04,628 --> 01:03:06,062
我的意思是它。
I meant it.

1038
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:07,963
不是你写的。
You didn't write it.

1039
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:13,336
你喝醉了，然后瞎编的，因为你不能忍受没有两秒钟不成为焦点。
You got drunk and you made it up, because you couldn't stand not being the center of attention for two fucking seconds.

1040
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:14,870
阿迪。
Addy.

1041
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:17,473
因为一切都要以你为中心。
Because everything always has to be about you.

1042
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,209
你喜欢什么。
What you like.

1043
01:03:20,242 --> 01:03:21,477
你读过什么书?
What books you've read.

1044
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,112
你喜欢什么电影。
What movies you're into.

1045
01:03:23,145 --> 01:03:25,915
这太糟糕了，你知道吗?
It's fucked up, you know?

1046
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:31,387
我是你女儿，我很紧张。
Like, I'm your daughter and I get nervous.

1047
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:37,526
就像一种极度的焦虑如果我不喜欢你喜欢的东西，你也不会喜欢我。
Like, debilitating fucking anxiety that if I don't like what you like, you won't like me.

1048
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:41,664
艾迪，我只是在分享对我有意义的东西。
Addy, I was sharing the things that were meaningful to me.

1049
01:03:41,697 --> 01:03:42,964
这对我来说很重要。
That were important to me.

1050
01:03:42,997 --> 01:03:45,166
不,你没有。你不是。
No, you weren't. You weren't.

1051
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,069
你想把我塑造成你的小版本。
You were trying to mold me into this little version of you.

1052
01:03:48,503 --> 01:03:50,004
模具吗?
Mold you?

1053
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:52,340
指导你。艾迪，我爱你。
Guide you. Addy, I love you.

1054
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:55,544
我爱你胜过世界上的一切。
I love you more than anything in the world.

1055
01:03:55,578 --> 01:03:59,114
我想让你知道我很努力。
And I want you to know I was trying.

1056
01:03:59,147 --> 01:04:00,982
我知道。我知道你在努力。
I know. I know you were trying.

1057
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:04,119
你总是尝试。
You're always trying.

1058
01:04:04,152 --> 01:04:06,388
靠，这才是最可悲的部分。
Fuck, that's actually the saddest part.

1059
01:04:12,527 --> 01:04:14,396
大便。
Shit.

1060
01:04:14,429 --> 01:04:16,789
我觉得我们还有很多工作要做，但这很好。
I think we have more work than I realized, but this is good.

1061
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:19,602
这很好。
This is very good.

1062
01:04:19,635 --> 01:04:21,503
这是良好的第一步。
This is a good first step.

1063
01:04:24,038 --> 01:04:27,676
抱歉打扰，古铁雷斯先生，有人来看你。
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Gutierrez, but you have a visitor.

1064
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:28,943
谢谢。
Gracias.

1065
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:37,720
哦!好莱坞杰维。他就在这里。
Oh! Hollywood Javi. There he is.

1066
01:04:42,323 --> 01:04:44,560
我有消息要告诉你。
I have some news for you.

1067
01:04:44,593 --> 01:04:46,294
杰维科波拉。
Javi Ford coppola.

1068
01:04:46,327 --> 01:04:48,096
坐下。
Sit.

1069
01:04:48,129 --> 01:04:49,297
和我一起吃饭。
Eat with me.

1070
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:03,945
果脆圈吗?
Froot Loops?

1071
01:05:05,581 --> 01:05:06,615
美味。
Delicious.

1072
01:05:08,082 --> 01:05:09,250
品尝它。
Taste it.

1073
01:05:13,521 --> 01:05:14,657
我喜欢果脆圈。
I love Froot Loops.

1074
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,367
塞尔吉奥·博尔达萨?嗯?
Sergio baldassari? Huh?

1075
01:05:57,297 --> 01:05:58,298
嗯。
Hmm.

1076
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:10,612
是的。
Yeah.

1077
01:06:14,816 --> 01:06:20,220
但如果我被出卖了我就不能和意大利人做交易。
But I can't do a deal with the Italians if I am being betrayed.

1078
01:06:25,259 --> 01:06:28,171
他让我的妻子和女儿飞到马略卡岛。
He flew my wife and daughter all the way out to majorca.

1079
01:06:28,195 --> 01:06:29,229
我的家人!
My family!

1080
01:06:29,263 --> 01:06:30,330
狗屎!
Shit!

1081
01:06:30,364 --> 01:06:31,833
不，不要说“狗屎”!
No, don't say "shit"!

1082
01:06:31,866 --> 01:06:33,768
是你把我们卷进来的。你救我们出去。
You got us into this. You get us out of this.

1083
01:06:33,801 --> 01:06:37,170
我们不可能及时调动撤离人员。
There's no way we can mobilize an extraction in time.

1084
01:06:37,204 --> 01:06:38,740
那我该怎么办?
Then, what am I supposed to do?

1085
01:06:38,773 --> 01:06:43,778
如果你能让哈维一个人待着，然后干掉他，就能为局里争取时间让你们都离开那里。
If you can get Javi alone, and then take him out, it'll buy the agency time to get you all out of there.

1086
01:06:43,811 --> 01:06:45,580
你能拿到枪吗?
Do you have access to a firearm?

1087
01:06:46,814 --> 01:06:48,148
我可能会。
I might.

1088
01:06:48,181 --> 01:06:51,811
尼克，我很抱歉，但这是保护你家人的最好办法。
Nick, I'm sorry, but this is the best way to safeguard your family.

1089
01:06:56,658 --> 01:06:58,860
听着，我需要你对我说实话。
Listen, I need you to be honest with me.

1090
01:06:58,893 --> 01:07:00,160
这他妈的是怎么回事?
What the fuck is happening?

1091
01:07:00,193 --> 01:07:01,495
好吧。
Okay.

1092
01:07:01,528 --> 01:07:04,431
我要告诉你一件事，但请不要惊慌。
I'm going to tell you something, but please don't freak out.

1093
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,101
我在为中情局工作。
I'm working for the CIA.

1094
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,851
你精神崩溃了吗?
Are you having a nervous breakdown?

1095
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:16,443
可能。但我说的是实话。
Probably. But I'm telling you the truth.

1096
01:07:16,476 --> 01:07:20,180
他们想要哈维生意上的信息所以我一直在帮他们。
They wanted some information on Javi's business dealings so I've been helping them.

1097
01:07:20,213 --> 01:07:24,418
奇怪的是，考虑到这么多表演就像间谍一样，这确实有点说得通。
And the strange thing is, it does kind of make sense given that so much of acting is like spying.

1098
01:07:24,451 --> 01:07:25,863
你知道这听起来怎么样吗?
Do you have any idea how this sounds?

1099
01:07:25,887 --> 01:07:28,121
因为我是说，这不是…还不是很好。
'Cause I mean, it's not... It's not good.

1100
01:07:28,155 --> 01:07:36,228
好吧，我需要一个小时为他们做最后一件事我回来后，我们三个一起飞洛杉矶，好吗?
Okay, I need an hour to do one final thing for them and when I get back, the three of us will fly to Los Angeles together, okay?

1101
01:07:36,262 --> 01:07:38,197
我不知道该说什么。
I don't know what to say.

1102
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,867
不要说任何东西。把艾迪带回我的房间。
Don't say anything. Just take addy back to my room.

1103
01:07:40,901 --> 01:07:42,836
不要和任何人说话。不要去任何地方。
Don't talk to anyone. Don't go anywhere.

1104
01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:44,705
我会回来接你的。我保证。
I'll be back to get you. I promise.

1105
01:07:44,738 --> 01:07:45,739
我爱你。
I love you.

1106
01:07:58,885 --> 01:08:05,592
你的朋友，尼古拉斯·凯奇，好莱坞的明星在为美国政府工作。
Your friend, Nicolas cage, the fucking star of Hollywood is working for the U.S. government.

1107
01:08:22,408 --> 01:08:23,910
哦,胡说!
Oh, bullshit!

1108
01:08:23,944 --> 01:08:25,311
胡说!
Bullshit!

1109
01:08:25,344 --> 01:08:26,580
胡说!
Bullshit!

1110
01:08:28,749 --> 01:08:30,584
胡说!
Bullshit!

1111
01:08:30,617 --> 01:08:31,718
听。
Listen.

1112
01:08:34,788 --> 01:08:37,634
我觉得自己会做更多这样的事情。你知道的，间谍技术。
I see myself doing more of this stuff. You know, spy craft.

1113
01:08:37,658 --> 01:08:39,860
托词。你有什么。
Subterfuge. What have you.

1114
01:08:39,893 --> 01:08:41,762
我觉得我可能有这方面的天赋。
I think I might have a real gift for it.

1115
01:08:41,795 --> 01:08:43,864
很好，因为我们有另一个任务给你。
Good, 'cause we got another mission for you.

1116
01:08:51,638 --> 01:08:52,873
不。
No.

1117
01:08:52,906 --> 01:08:54,373
卢卡斯,不。
Lucas, no.

1118
01:09:03,016 --> 01:09:04,216
卢卡斯。
Lucas.

1119
01:09:17,898 --> 01:09:19,933
不!不,不,不!
No! No, no, no!

1120
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:33,746
我很愿意相信你，老大。
I would love to believe you, primo.

1121
01:09:34,947 --> 01:09:40,886
但要么我杀了你，要么你杀了尼古拉斯·凯奇。
But either I kill you, or you kill Nicolas cage.

1122
01:09:46,826 --> 01:09:48,226
你的选择。
Your choice.

1123
01:10:57,563 --> 01:10:58,564
嗨。
Hi.

1124
01:10:59,531 --> 01:11:00,800
嘿。
Hey.

1125
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:03,602
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1126
01:11:03,636 --> 01:11:06,504
我应该在拿下他们之前先问你的。
I should have asked you before bringing them down.

1127
01:11:07,405 --> 01:11:08,941
是的。
Yeah.

1128
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:13,679
我在想也许绑架也行。
And I was thinking maybe a kidnapping would work.

1129
01:11:13,712 --> 01:11:21,086
我们的电影一开始会是一个美丽的角色片段，然后，慢慢地变成一个更激动人心的……好莱坞大片。
Our movie would start out as a beautiful character piece and then, slowly change into a more thrilling... Hollywood blockbuster.

1130
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,689
然后每个人都有适合自己的东西。
Then there's something for everyone.

1131
01:11:24,722 --> 01:11:26,791
你想开车去悬崖边吗?
Would you like to drive out to the cliffs?

1132
01:11:29,093 --> 01:11:31,830
清醒一下头脑，想清楚第三幕?
Clear our heads, and think through the third act?

1133
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,099
完美的。
Perfect.

1134
01:11:54,085 --> 01:11:55,086
所以…
So...

1135
01:11:57,856 --> 01:11:58,890
我们应该去。
We should go.

1136
01:11:59,757 --> 01:12:00,825
是的。
Yeah.

1137
01:12:08,666 --> 01:12:09,868
那双是新鞋吗?
Are those new shoes?

1138
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:10,935
这些吗?
These?

1139
01:12:10,969 --> 01:12:12,804
不，我吃过。
No, I've had these.

1140
01:12:12,837 --> 01:12:14,606
哦。
Oh.

1141
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:16,040
我以前没见过他们。
I haven't seen them before.

1142
01:12:16,074 --> 01:12:17,474
我不常穿。
I don't wear them very much.

1143
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:18,752
我觉得他们不是真正的我。
I don't think they're really me.

1144
01:12:18,776 --> 01:12:20,011
什么?
What?

1145
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,146
他们好了。你穿起来真好看。
They're great. They look incredible on you.

1146
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,616
他们完全是你的风格。爱他们。
They're totally you. Love 'em.

1147
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:25,984
你想试试吗?
Do you wanna try them on?

1148
01:12:26,017 --> 01:12:27,552
我觉得你穿上一定很好看。
I think they would look amazing on you.

1149
01:12:30,154 --> 01:12:31,155
哦,哇!
Oh, wow!

1150
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:34,893
你穿起来真漂亮。
Those look incredible on you.

1151
01:12:34,926 --> 01:12:36,861
我喜欢你戴上它的样子。是的。
I like how those look on you. Yeah.

1152
01:12:39,864 --> 01:12:41,431
你想要交易吗?
You wanna trade?

1153
01:12:41,465 --> 01:12:42,466
永久?
Like, permanently?

1154
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:45,502
好吧。
Okay.

1155
01:12:55,947 --> 01:12:57,148
酷。
Cool.

1156
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:04,555
很高兴认识你。
I'm really glad I got to meet you.

1157
01:13:05,823 --> 01:13:15,465
你是那种我多年不见的朋友，甚至都没跟你说过话，只是重新开始我们的感情。
You're the kind of friend I could not see for years, and not even really talk to and just pick up right where we left off.

1158
01:13:15,499 --> 01:13:16,734
我完全同意。
I totally agree.

1159
01:13:17,635 --> 01:13:20,537
它只是…别紧张
It's just... Easy.

1160
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,184
嗯…
Well...

1161
01:13:37,554 --> 01:13:40,157
我想是时候弄清楚这事的结局了。
I guess it's time to figure out how this thing ends.

1162
01:13:56,907 --> 01:14:00,911
尼克……我刚才说的都是真的。
Nick... I meant what I said back there.

1163
01:14:01,845 --> 01:14:02,946
我也是。
Me, too.

1164
01:14:04,214 --> 01:14:06,116
这就是为什么这真的很伤人。
Which is why this really hurts.

1165
01:14:08,151 --> 01:14:09,820
杰维。
Javi.

1166
01:14:09,853 --> 01:14:12,055
你带我来是要杀了我吗?
You brought me out here to kill me, man?

1167
01:14:12,089 --> 01:14:13,156
对不起,尼克。
I'm sorry, Nick.

1168
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:14,725
我也一样。
So am I.

1169
01:14:14,758 --> 01:14:16,760
因为你扣动扳机，我们就都死了。
'Cause you pull that trigger and we're both dead.

1170
01:14:16,793 --> 01:14:19,863
等待。你要杀了我?
Wait. You were gonna kill me?

1171
01:14:19,896 --> 01:14:21,698
那些是我的金枪吗?
And are those my golden guns?

1172
01:14:21,732 --> 01:14:24,301
它们是我的金枪。
They're my golden guns.

1173
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,546
看起来我们都有一个小秘密，不是吗?
And it looks like we both had a little secret, doesn't it?

1174
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:27,971
你他妈为什么要杀我?
Why the fuck would you kill me?

1175
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,806
你是犯罪组织的头头。
You're the head of a criminal organization.

1176
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,743
我表弟卢卡斯是这个组织的负责人。
My cousin Lucas is the head of the organization.

1177
01:14:32,776 --> 01:14:34,711
中情局说是你干的。
CIA said you ran it.

1178
01:14:34,745 --> 01:14:36,980
全世界都认为是我在经营。
The whole world thinks I run it.

1179
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,583
我父亲死后，卢卡斯接手了。
When my father died, Lucas took over.

1180
01:14:39,616 --> 01:14:41,218
他逼我做傀儡。
He forced me to be the figurehead.

1181
01:14:41,251 --> 01:14:42,619
你拿了他的钱。
You take his money.

1182
01:14:42,652 --> 01:14:44,888
你不能就这么离开这个世界，尼克。
You don't just leave this world, Nick.

1183
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:47,891
你和你关心的所有人都处于危险之中。
You and everyone you care about is in constant danger.

1184
01:14:47,924 --> 01:14:49,693
你为什么觉得我不能和加布里埃拉在一起?
Why do you think I cannot be with Gabriela?

1185
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,629
你……你喜欢加芙?
You... you're into Gabriela?

1186
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:53,964
你他妈开什么玩笑?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1187
01:14:53,997 --> 01:14:56,876
我不能和盖比瑞拉在一起，那样会成为她的目标。
I can't be with Gabriella, because that would put a target on her back.

1188
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,835
等等，你真的没发现我们喜欢对方吗?
Wait, you seriously didn't realize that we liked each other?

1189
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,037
你是中央情报局的!
You're in the CIA!

1190
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,338
我不是中情局的人。
I'm not in the CIA.

1191
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:04,775
我是个该死的演员。你知道的。
I'm a goddamn actor. You know that.

1192
01:15:04,808 --> 01:15:08,712
我唯一加入的组织是美国演员工会。
The only organization I'm a part of is the screen actors guild of america.

1193
01:15:08,745 --> 01:15:10,256
和aftra。但我都不知道那是什么。
And aftra. But I don't even know what that is.

1194
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,225
我想是收音机的问题。把枪放下。
I think it's a radio thing. Just put down the gun.

1195
01:15:12,249 --> 01:15:14,117
不可能。你先走。
No way. You go first.

1196
01:15:14,151 --> 01:15:15,728
我不会先说的。你把我的家人带到了这里。
I'm not going first. You brought my family out here.

1197
01:15:15,752 --> 01:15:17,362
这太操蛋了!我不想杀你。
This is so fucked! I don't wanna kill you.

1198
01:15:17,386 --> 01:15:18,888
你是我最不想杀的人。
You're the last person I wanna kill.

1199
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:20,890
我爱死你了!我爱你!
I fucking love you! I love you!

1200
01:15:26,729 --> 01:15:28,030
这是我的表弟。
It's my cousin.

1201
01:15:28,064 --> 01:15:29,174
他一定知道我不会杀你。
He must have known I wouldn't kill you.

1202
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:30,633
我这样认为。
I thought so.

1203
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:34,070
这就是为什么我应该一直相信我作为一个演员的萨满本能。
Which is why I should always trust my shamanic instincts as a thespian.

1204
01:15:35,638 --> 01:15:37,773
他妈的!
Fuck!

1205
01:15:44,146 --> 01:15:46,248
快!我尝试。
Faster! I'm trying.

1206
01:15:46,282 --> 01:15:48,184
你的鞋子不能支撑脚踝。
Your shoes don't offer any ankle support.

1207
01:15:53,722 --> 01:15:55,224
啊,操!
Ah, fuck!

1208
01:16:00,162 --> 01:16:02,631
好吧。你只要跑出去。你去开卡车。
Okay. You just run out there. You get the truck.

1209
01:16:02,665 --> 01:16:04,342
你回来接我。我来放哨。
You come back and get me. I will keep a lookout.

1210
01:16:04,366 --> 01:16:07,303
啊哈。爱死它了。爱的计划。
Uh-huh. Love it. Love the plan.

1211
01:16:07,336 --> 01:16:13,242
但鉴于你让我背上了一堆破烂的包袱也许你该走了，我留在这里。
But given that you've saddled me with what basically amounts to fucking penny loafers maybe you should go, and I'll stay here.

1212
01:16:13,275 --> 01:16:14,977
我喜欢这个计划，真的。
I love that plan, I do.

1213
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:18,781
但你跑得比我快，即使你穿的鞋不怎么样。
But you are a faster runner than me, even with subpar footwear.

1214
01:16:18,814 --> 01:16:20,192
我看到你在国家宝藏的速度有多快了。
I saw how fast you were in national treasure.

1215
01:16:20,216 --> 01:16:21,984
不，那是特技部门。
No, that'd be the stunt department.

1216
01:16:22,017 --> 01:16:23,986
不是根据制作的特点。
Not according to the making of featurette.

1217
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:27,790
好,我去。等等!
Fine, I'll go. Wait!

1218
01:16:27,823 --> 01:16:29,725
你要去吗?我和你一起去。
So, you're gonna go? I'm going with you.

1219
01:16:39,068 --> 01:16:40,069
他们在那!
There they are!

1220
01:16:53,115 --> 01:16:54,383
啊,狗屎!
Ah, shit!

1221
01:16:57,953 --> 01:16:59,221
他朝我们过来了。
He's coming up on us.

1222
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:05,027
在你的左手边!在你的左手边!
On your left! On your left!

1223
01:17:08,097 --> 01:17:09,732
神圣的狗屎!
Holy shit!

1224
01:17:13,935 --> 01:17:15,436
踩下刹车!什么?
Hit the brakes! What?

1225
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:17,081
踩下刹车。他会撞到卡车后部的。
Hit the brakes. He will hit the back of the truck.

1226
01:17:17,105 --> 01:17:18,315
是行不通的。是的,它会。是的,它会。
That won't work. Yes, it will. Yes, it will.

1227
01:17:18,339 --> 01:17:19,807
想做就做。做到!做到!做到!
Just do it. Do it! Do it! Do it!

1228
01:17:24,212 --> 01:17:25,947
别担心，他完全晕过去了。
Don't worry, he's totally passed out.

1229
01:17:27,148 --> 01:17:28,850
他妈的!
Fuck!

1230
01:17:32,453 --> 01:17:34,756
我很好。你还好吗?
I'm okay. Are you okay?

1231
01:17:47,335 --> 01:17:48,836
丽芙·。
Liv.

1232
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,310
他们带走了艾迪，尼克。他们把阿迪?
They took addy, Nick. They took addy?

1233
01:17:50,338 --> 01:17:51,949
她出去找你，然后他们就抓住了她。
She went outside to find you and they just grabbed her.

1234
01:17:51,973 --> 01:17:53,841
有更多的士兵来了。我们得走了。
There are more soldiers coming. We have to go.

1235
01:17:54,342 --> 01:17:55,343
他妈的!
Fuck!

1236
01:18:01,482 --> 01:18:03,318
薇薇安?你好。
Vivian? Hello.

1237
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:04,152
尼克，我把地址发给你了。
Nick, I've sent you the address.

1238
01:18:04,185 --> 01:18:05,253
你在路上吗?
You on the way?

1239
01:18:05,286 --> 01:18:07,155
什么?他们抓了我女儿。
What? They have my daughter.

1240
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:08,489
他们想要她做什么?
What do they want with her?

1241
01:18:08,523 --> 01:18:13,437
不幸的是，她被用来向美国政府施压这样他们就不会再支持德尔加多了。
Unfortunately, she's being used to put pressure on the U.S. government so they'll back off their support of delgado.

1242
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:20,101
除非德尔加多退出选举尼克，我很抱歉，但他们说要杀了两个女孩。
And unless delgado drops out of the election... Nick, I'm sorry, but they said they're gonna kill both girls.

1243
01:18:21,102 --> 01:18:22,437
什么?什么?什么?
What? What? What?

1244
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,072
你会让他退学的，对吧?
You're gonna get him to drop out, right?

1245
01:18:24,105 --> 01:18:25,541
你会让他退学的!
You're gonna get him to drop out!

1246
01:18:25,574 --> 01:18:28,042
直接过来就可以了。
Just come directly here.

1247
01:19:24,364 --> 01:19:25,866
哦,他妈的…
Oh, fucking...

1248
01:19:29,369 --> 01:19:30,913
他的人可能还在那片区域。
His people could still be in the area.

1249
01:19:30,937 --> 01:19:32,406
我们得走了。在哪里?
We have to go. Where?

1250
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,241
我有地方住。我们走吧。
I have a place. Let's go.

1251
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:35,714
——走吧。——来,来了。现在来。
- Let's go. - Come, come. Come now.

1252
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:40,615
那么，我们的计划是什么?
So, what's the plan here?

1253
01:19:40,648 --> 01:19:44,351
你要当大英雄吗?保存阿迪自己吗?
You gonna be a big hero? Save addy yourself?

1254
01:19:44,384 --> 01:19:46,520
你会像她一样死掉的。
You'll end up dead like her.

1255
01:19:46,554 --> 01:19:49,222
让专业人士来做吧。
Leave it to the professionals.

1256
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:51,058
当地警方。谁。
Local police. Whomever.

1257
01:19:51,091 --> 01:19:52,492
没有其他人了。
There is no one else.

1258
01:19:55,996 --> 01:19:57,331
我爱你。
I love you.

1259
01:19:57,364 --> 01:19:59,366
我也一直在照顾你。
And I have always looked out for you.

1260
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:01,201
放开我!
Get off of me!

1261
01:20:01,234 --> 01:20:02,603
我必须进去。
I have to go in there.

1262
01:20:02,637 --> 01:20:05,138
因为艾迪必须知道我为她而战。
Because addy has to know I fought for her.

1263
01:20:07,341 --> 01:20:10,077
我在帮你，你却不听!
I'm trying to help you, and you won't listen!

1264
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:11,878
你是怎么帮我的?
How are you helping me, huh?

1265
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:13,347
你是怎么帮我的?
How are you ever helping me?

1266
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:17,652
你得知道你是谁，尼克。
You need to know who you are, Nick.

1267
01:20:17,685 --> 01:20:19,186
这不是角色。
This isn't a role.

1268
01:20:19,219 --> 01:20:21,054
你不是英雄。
You're not a hero.

1269
01:20:21,088 --> 01:20:22,465
你只是个差点害死我们的人。
You're just some guy who's about to get us killed.

1270
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:24,191
你他妈的白痴!
You fucking idiot!

1271
01:20:37,605 --> 01:20:41,642
我20年前买了这栋房子就是为了这种情况。
I bought this house 20 years ago for a situation just like this.

1272
01:20:41,676 --> 01:20:45,613
它有我们需要的一切。食物，护照，伪装材料。
It has everything we need. Food, passports, materials for disguise.

1273
01:20:46,714 --> 01:20:48,081
今晚我们就安全了。
We'll be safe for the night.

1274
01:20:52,285 --> 01:20:55,489
奥利维亚，我保证你会把女儿找回来的。
Olivia, I promise you will get your daughter back.

1275
01:21:07,032 --> 01:21:10,002
女孩们可能被关在我表姐的院子里。
The girls are likely being held in my cousin's compound.

1276
01:21:10,035 --> 01:21:13,607
他们用修道院作为掩护，但它是一座堡垒。
It is a monastery that they use as a cover, but it is a fortress.

1277
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,642
这是令人费解的。四面都是墙。
It is impenetrable. There are walls on every side.

1278
01:21:15,675 --> 01:21:17,009
逃生路线吗?
Any escape routes?

1279
01:21:17,042 --> 01:21:20,547
隧道。但金属门只能从里面打开。
Tunnels. But with metal doors that only open from the inside.

1280
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:24,016
即使没有全副武装的警卫，也不可能进去。
Even if it weren't for all of the armed guards, it is impossible to get in.

1281
01:21:24,049 --> 01:21:27,587
我是说，这个变态会在12小时内杀死我们的女儿。
I mean, this psychopath is gonna kill our daughter in 12 hours.

1282
01:21:27,621 --> 01:21:29,556
那我们他妈该怎么办?
So, what the fuck are we gonna do?

1283
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:41,133
我们要直接从前门进去。
We are going to walk straight in through the front gate.

1284
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,105
好的,很酷。非常戏剧性的回答。
Okay, cool. Very dramatic answer.

1285
01:21:46,138 --> 01:21:48,274
这是怎么回事?
How's that supposed to work?

1286
01:21:48,307 --> 01:21:52,579
卢卡斯正试图与calabero犯罪家族的首领Sergio baldassari结盟。
Lucas is trying to form an alliance with Sergio baldassari, the head of the calabero crime family.

1287
01:21:52,612 --> 01:21:55,649
巴尔达萨里，15年没人见过他了。
Baldassari, I mean, no one has seen him for 15 years.

1288
01:21:55,682 --> 01:22:02,288
完全正确。既然没人见过他也没人知道他长什么样。
Exactly. And since no one has seen him no one knows exactly what he looks like.

1289
01:22:02,321 --> 01:22:03,623
奥利维亚。
Olivia.

1290
01:22:03,657 --> 01:22:06,392
尼克说你们认识的时候你是个很棒的化妆师。
Nick says that you were an incredible makeup artist when you met.

1291
01:22:06,425 --> 01:22:11,397
所以，用一些假肢和一点化妆品…然后我就可以演塞尔吉奥了。
So, with some prosthetics and a little makeup... Then I could play Sergio.

1292
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,347
卢卡斯古铁雷斯!
Lucas Gutierrez!

1293
01:22:33,085 --> 01:22:34,797
我想介绍一下我的妻子芭芭拉。
I'd like to introduce my wife Barbara.

1294
01:22:34,821 --> 01:22:38,424
为什么?她出生在加州的圣巴巴拉。
Why for? She was born in Santa Barbara, California.

1295
01:22:41,728 --> 01:22:44,664
你他妈觉得我蠢吗，塞尔吉奥?
You think I'm fucking stupid, Sergio, hmm?

1296
01:22:44,698 --> 01:22:50,412
你以为15年后你就这么走进来杀了我吗，你个混蛋?
You think you're just gonna walk in here after 15 years and kill me, you motherfucker, hmm?

1297
01:22:50,436 --> 01:22:51,614
他要把我的耳朵割下来!
He's cutting my fucking ear off!

1298
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:53,439
你为谁工作?三秒。
Who are you working for? Three seconds.

1299
01:22:53,472 --> 01:22:55,241
这只是我!两个!
It's just me! Two!

1300
01:22:55,274 --> 01:22:56,308
我保证!
I promise!

1301
01:23:00,513 --> 01:23:03,182
你觉得她能帮你吗，塞尔吉奥?
You think she can help you, Sergio, hmm?

1302
01:23:04,783 --> 01:23:06,585
去做吧。
Go ahead.

1303
01:23:06,619 --> 01:23:09,320
你杀了他，我还是会做交易。
You kill him, I'll still make the deal.

1304
01:23:09,354 --> 01:23:11,055
但我觉得你不会杀了他。
But I don't think you're gonna kill him.

1305
01:23:12,758 --> 01:23:14,560
你觉得我不会杀了他吗?
You don't think I'll kill him?

1306
01:23:14,593 --> 01:23:17,630
不，我觉得如果你要杀他，你早就动手了。
No, I think if you were gonna kill him, you would have done it by now.

1307
01:23:17,663 --> 01:23:19,364
所以，不，我不认为你会这么做。
So, no, I don't think you'll do it.

1308
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:26,404
不过，我想知道你他妈凭什么觉得你能吓到我?
Although, I am wondering why the fuck you think you can intimidate me?

1309
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,142
好的，来自圣巴巴拉的芭芭拉。
Okay, Barbara from Santa Barbara.

1310
01:23:31,175 --> 01:23:32,243
好吧,芭芭拉。
Okay, Barbara.

1311
01:23:33,812 --> 01:23:35,781
很高兴见到你，塞尔吉奥。
It is good to see you, Sergio.

1312
01:23:35,814 --> 01:23:37,315
已经太久了。
Been far too long.

1313
01:23:37,348 --> 01:23:38,584
你没事吧?
You okay?

1314
01:23:38,617 --> 01:23:40,686
我的人会带你去一个房间。
My people will show you to a room.

1315
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:44,188
梳洗一下，然后我们再谈。
Freshen up, and then, we'll talk.

1316
01:23:44,222 --> 01:23:47,626
天啊，我的耳朵看起来怎么样?他差点割了我的耳朵。
God, how does my ear look? He almost cut off my ear.

1317
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,203
狗屎!我们只有15分钟了，尼克。
Shit! We've only got about 15 minutes, Nick.

1318
01:23:49,227 --> 01:23:50,596
我们得去找艾迪。
We've gotta go find addy.

1319
01:23:50,629 --> 01:23:55,546
——我知道。我知道。-根据哈维的地图，他们可能把她关在这幢楼的地下室里。
- I know. I know. - According to Javi's map, they're probably holding her in the basement of the building right here.

1320
01:24:05,276 --> 01:24:06,277
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

1321
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:24,262
我们该怎么办?
What do we do?

1322
01:24:30,501 --> 01:24:31,502
哦,好的。
Oh, good one.

1323
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:37,342
得到他的枪。
Get his gun.

1324
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:42,380
放下枪，塞尔吉奥。
Drop the gun, Sergio.

1325
01:24:46,552 --> 01:24:48,486
你们俩都不该在这里。
Neither of you are supposed to be here.

1326
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:50,521
跟我来。
Come with me.

1327
01:24:57,763 --> 01:24:58,764
卢卡斯。
Lucas.

1328
01:25:07,872 --> 01:25:08,912
一把枪?
A gun?

1329
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,374
好的,塞吉奥。
Okay, Sergio.

1330
01:25:10,407 --> 01:25:12,309
怎么了，伙计?
What's the deal, my man?

1331
01:25:12,342 --> 01:25:24,197
你他妈有什么问题想告诉我还是…我还以为那女孩不在你手上，而我们的协议是德尔加多退出-他会退出的。——操。
You got a fucking problem you'd like to tell me about or... I was beginning to think you don't have the girl and since our deal was based on delgado dropping out... - He'll drop out. - Fuck.

1332
01:25:24,221 --> 01:25:25,522
但他还没有这么做。
But he hasn't done it yet.

1333
01:25:25,556 --> 01:25:27,257
Lucas.

1334
01:25:33,731 --> 01:25:35,198
卢卡斯!现在!
Lucas! Now!

1335
01:25:36,834 --> 01:25:37,835
好吧。
Okay.

1336
01:25:41,005 --> 01:25:48,913
如果你和我要一起做生意，塞尔吉奥，你得相信我。
You know, if you and I are gonna be in business together, Sergio, you're gonna need to trust me.

1337
01:25:49,547 --> 01:25:50,548
嗯?
Hmm?

1338
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,320
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

1339
01:25:57,354 --> 01:25:58,488
什么鬼，什么?
What the fuck, what?

1340
01:25:58,522 --> 01:25:59,657
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

1341
01:25:59,691 --> 01:26:04,261
你的脸……哦,狗屎!我要打爆他的头!
Your face... Oh, shit! I'll blow his fucking head off, man!

1342
01:26:04,294 --> 01:26:06,664
别他妈的移动!
Don't fucking move!

1343
01:26:06,698 --> 01:26:07,999
奥利维亚，带着孩子们走。
Olivia, take the girls and go.

1344
01:26:08,032 --> 01:26:09,499
你有什么计划，尼克?
What's the plan here, Nick?

1345
01:26:09,534 --> 01:26:11,903
你把姑娘们活着带出去!
You get the girls out of here alive!

1346
01:26:11,936 --> 01:26:13,905
不，我们不能把他留在这里。
No, we can't just leave him here.

1347
01:26:13,938 --> 01:26:15,405
艾迪，和你妈妈一起去!
Addy, go with your mom!

1348
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:16,473
嘿!那就去吧。走吧!

你就跑,阿迪。

1351
01:26:21,411 --> 01:26:23,480
你喜欢吗?嗯?
You like that? Huh?

1352
01:26:23,513 --> 01:26:25,016
哦,我的上帝。尼克的笼子里。

尼克不要脸的笼子!

想都别想!

好的,这样。来吧。

尼克在哪里?
Where's Nick?

1360
01:26:42,967 --> 01:26:45,002
他拿枪指着卢卡斯。
He's got a gun on Lucas.

1361
01:26:45,036 --> 01:26:46,871
他为我们争取了一些时间，但还有其他人。
He bought us some time, but there's others.

1362
01:26:46,904 --> 01:26:48,940
他不可能活着离开那里。
He will never make it out of there alive.

1363
01:26:53,845 --> 01:26:55,913
这是我知道的，尼克·凯奇。
Here's what I know, Nick cage.

1364
01:26:55,947 --> 01:27:00,817
我有四个人拿枪指着你的头。
I've got four guys with guns pointed directly at your head.

1365
01:27:00,851 --> 01:27:04,386
是的,这是真的。但我知道的是。
Yeah, that's true. But here's what I know.

1366
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:05,989
我的家庭是安全的。
My family's safe.

1367
01:27:06,022 --> 01:27:07,224
这才是最重要的。
And that's all that matters.

1368
01:27:10,827 --> 01:27:12,528
嘿!
Hey!

1369
01:27:12,562 --> 01:27:13,997
他就在这里。
There he is.

1370
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:15,766
他他妈的在那儿!

美国的英雄。
The American hero.

1372
01:27:17,934 --> 01:27:19,435
哦!
Oh!

1373
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:22,505
好莱坞的明星，对吧?
The fucking star of Hollywood, eh?

1374
01:27:22,539 --> 01:27:26,076
哦,哇。来吧。这是什么?
Ooh, whoa. Come on. What is this?

1375
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:28,678
还有这个鼻子，对吧?
And this nose, yeah?

1376
01:27:28,712 --> 01:27:30,013
别他妈的移动!
Don't fucking move!

1377
01:27:30,046 --> 01:27:32,414
耶稣基督!又是这个该死的家伙。

卡洛斯。

01:27:35,051 --> 01:27:37,096
请卡洛斯。你不会想这样对我的。
Carlos, please. You don't wanna do this to me.

1380
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,789
你不会想这样对哈维的。
You don't wanna do this to Javi.

1381
01:27:38,822 --> 01:27:41,591
他一直对你很好。
He's been nothing but good to you.

1382
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,759
哈维就要死了。
Javi is about to die.

1383
01:27:43,526 --> 01:27:45,494
你也一样。
As are you.

1384
01:27:45,528 --> 01:27:46,997
狗屎!
Shit!

1385
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:49,566
在你死之前有什么想说的吗?
Anything you'd like to say before you die?

1386
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,739
人脑向身体发送信息需要13毫秒。
"It takes 13 milliseconds for the human brain "to send a message to the body.

1387
01:27:55,772 --> 01:28:05,582

"在你屁眼还没撅起嘴之前，"你的延髓就会"溅得你身后的墙上到处都是!
"And before your asshole has a chance to pucker up, "your medulla oblongata will be splattered "all over the fucking wall behind ya!

1389
01:28:14,558 --> 01:28:18,962
"如果这是我在这个美丽的绿色地球上完成的最后一件事"
"And if that's the last thing I accomplish "on this beautiful green earth,"

1390
01:28:18,995 --> 01:28:21,932
“那么，哈，我说，哈……”
"well, then, ha, I say, ha..."

1391
01:28:21,965 --> 01:28:24,534
“这他妈是怎么死的。”
"What a way to fucking go."

1392
01:28:27,604 --> 01:28:28,672
嘿!
Hey!

1393
01:28:31,608 --> 01:28:33,610
妈的,来吧!尼克,走吧!走吧!
Shit, come on! Nick, go! Go!

1394
01:28:39,115 --> 01:28:40,482
我们杀了他吗?
Did we kill him?

1395
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:47,389
狗屎!
Shit!

1396
01:28:47,423 --> 01:28:49,659
你死了。
You're dead.

1397
01:28:49,693 --> 01:28:51,027
你们所有的人!
All of you!

1398
01:29:00,536 --> 01:29:01,971
尼古拉斯凯奇吗?
Nicolas cage?

1399
01:29:04,607 --> 01:29:06,609
这是他妈的酷。
That's fucking cool.

1400
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:13,115
阿迪……艾迪,他……他伤害你了吗?
Addy... addy, did he... Did he hurt you?

1401
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:14,750
更好的没有。不。
Better not have. No.

1402

你饿了吗?不。
Are you hungry? No.

1403
01:29:16,218 --> 01:29:18,854
杰维苹果。你想要一台麦金托什吗?蜂蜜脆?
Javi has apples. You want a McIntosh? Honey crisp?

1404
01:29:18,888 --> 01:29:20,455
没有苹果,尼克。
No apples, Nick.

1405
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:21,456
爸爸，拜托，看着路。拜托!
Dad, just please, watch the road. Please!

1406
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:22,758
哦,狗屎!

1407
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:29,999
哦,狗屎!
Oh, shit!

1408
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,034
哦。
Oh.

01:29:38,007 --> 01:29:39,818
奥利维亚，把枪给我。它们就在那里。
Olivia, hand me the guns. They're right in there.

1410
01:29:39,842 --> 01:29:41,076
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1411
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:43,178
不。
No.

1412
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:44,488
好了，停车。我会让他们慢下来的。
Okay, stop the truck. I will slow them down.

1413
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:45,848
没门!是的。
No way! Yes.

1414
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:47,515
你们离大使馆还有两公里。
You are two kilometers from the embassy.

1415
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:48,693
如果我能拖住他们，你们就都能成功。
If I slow them down, then you will all make it.

1416
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:49,761
-哈维，我能带我们过去。——不!
- Javi, I can get us there. - No!

1417
01:29:49,785 --> 01:29:50,945
待在卡车里!Javs !
Just stay in the truck! Javs!

1418
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:55,824
不!
No!

1419
01:29:55,858 --> 01:29:57,525
快上车，哈维!
Just get in the car, Javi!

1420
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:04,867
如果我不反抗我表姐，我就永远活不下去!
I'm never gonna have any kind of a life unless I stand up to my cousin!

1421
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:07,836
我需要这个。
I need this.

1422
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:10,072
现在,走了。
Now, go.

当然可以。

是的。把这个拿走。
Yeah. Take this left here.

1430
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:24,812
狗屎!
Shit!

1431
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,155
等一等。
Hold on.

1432
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:51,606
我们甩掉他们了吗?我想我们甩掉他们了。
Did we lose 'em? I think we lost 'em.

1433
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:53,207
爸爸,小心!
Dad, watch out!

1434
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:01,549
-我的天啊
- Oh, my god.

1435
01:32:23,805 --> 01:32:26,074
我要杀了你，尼克·凯奇!
I'm gonna kill you, Nick fucking cage!

1436
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,645

01:32:55,735 --> 01:32:57,170

1457
01:34:49,148 --> 01:34:50,416
不是说我们去哪儿了。
Not that we went anywhere.

1458
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:03,128
谢谢。哦,谢谢。
Thanks. Oh, thanks.

1459
01:35:06,398 --> 01:35:08,067
尼克。
Nick.

1460
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,501
哈维，我一直在找你。
Javi, I've been looking for you.

1461
01:35:09,536 --> 01:35:11,070
我还在想你去哪儿了呢。
I was wondering where you went.

1462
01:35:11,103 --> 01:35:15,241
不，我看不下去了。我,呃…我太紧张了。
Oh, no, I couldn't watch. I was, uh... I was too nervous.

1463
01:35:15,274 --> 01:35:16,442
它是怎么玩的?
How did it play?

1464
01:35:16,475 --> 01:35:19,044
他们喜欢它。祝贺你。
They loved it. Congratulations.

1465
01:35:19,078 --> 01:35:20,412
真的吗?是的。
Really? Yeah.

1466
01:35:20,446 --> 01:35:21,947
哦,哇!
Oh, wow!

1467
01:35:23,015 --> 01:35:27,554
这是……尼克……谢谢你！
This is... Nick... Thank you.

1468
01:35:27,587 --> 01:35:29,989
哈维，我们一起做的。谢谢你！
Javi, we did this together. Thank you.

1469
01:35:30,022 --> 01:35:32,024
你想和我一起去派对吗?
Do you wanna ride to the party with me?

1470
01:35:32,057 --> 01:35:34,927
他们想采访我们。嗯,《名利场》。
They want to interview us. Uh, vanity fair.

1471
01:35:37,896 --> 01:35:39,999
是的，不，今晚不行。但你走了。
Yeah, no, I can't tonight. But you go.

1472
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,401
玩得开心。享受这个。
Have fun. Enjoy this.

1473
01:35:42,434 --> 01:35:44,270
代我向加布里埃拉问好。
And give Gabriela my love.

1474
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:51,544
艾迪想借你的皮带。
Addy wants to borrow your belt.

1475
01:35:51,578 --> 01:35:53,045
哦，是的，我喜欢。
Oh, yeah, I do.

1476
01:35:53,078 --> 01:35:55,080
看起来还挺重的。
It looks like it's got some weight.

1477
01:35:55,114 --> 01:35:57,416
没错，是只又大又肥的狼蛛。
Well, yeah, it's a big, fat tarantula.

1478
01:35:57,449 --> 01:35:59,084
你知道我的梳妆台，杰夫。
You know my dresser, Jeff.

1479
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:00,286
内曼•马库斯先生吗?是的。
Mr. Neiman Marcus? Yes.

1480
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:01,954
他想让我戴上一只蜜蜂。
He wanted me to wear a bee.

1481
01:36:01,987 --> 01:36:03,856
我说，杰夫，不是蜜蜂。没有蜜蜂”。
And I said, "Jeff, not the bees. Not the bees".

1482
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:06,935
于是，他说，“那么，蝎子怎么样?”我说:“杰夫，我觉得蝎子有点攻击性。”
So, he said, "well, how about a scorpion? " I said, "I think a scorpion is a little aggressive, Jeff."

1483
01:36:06,959 --> 01:36:08,093
“狼蛛怎么样?”
"What about a tarantula?"

1484
01:36:08,127 --> 01:36:09,395
他说"我不认为"
He goes, "well, I don't think"

1485
01:36:09,428 --> 01:36:10,606
“那就没那么咄咄逼人了，尼克。”
"that's any less aggressive, Nick."

1486
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:11,870
我说"对我来说是"
And I say, "well, it is to me."

1487
01:36:11,897 --> 01:36:12,941
它们很可爱，毛茸茸的，对吧?
They're cute and fuzzy, right?

1488
01:36:12,965 --> 01:36:14,075
好吧，艾迪想借。
Well, addy wants to borrow it.

1489
01:36:14,099 --> 01:36:15,602
不客气。
Not at all.

1490
01:36:15,635 --> 01:36:17,369
给你吧。这是你的。
You can have it. It's yours.

1491
01:36:17,403 --> 01:36:19,905
你确定你不需要留在首映礼上吗?
Are you sure you didn't need to stay at the premiere?

1492
01:36:19,938 --> 01:36:22,007
百分百。是吗?
Hundred percent. Yeah?

1493
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:23,184
谁选黛米·摩尔扮演妈妈的?
Who chose Demi Moore to play mom?

1494
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:24,977
工作室。
Studio.

1495
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:27,246
但这并不能真正公正地对待你母亲，不是吗?
But it doesn't really do your mother justice, does it?

1496
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:28,447
哦,来吧。
Oh, come on.

1497
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,582
她是美丽的。
She's gorgeous.

1498
01:36:29,616 --> 01:36:30,983
你也是，奥利维亚。
So are you, Olivia.

1499
01:36:31,016 --> 01:36:33,252
爸，别跟老妈调情了。
Ew, dad, stop hitting on mom.

1500
01:36:33,285 --> 01:36:34,953
我不是在勾引她。
I'm not hitting on her.

1501
01:36:34,987 --> 01:36:37,389
哦,恶心。我不想再听这些了。
Oh, gross. I don't wanna listen to this anymore.

1502
01:36:37,423 --> 01:36:39,457
你知道吗?我们看个电影怎么样?
You know what? What do you say we watch a movie?

1503
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:41,459
是啊，随便你，爸爸。
Yeah, whatever you want, dad.

1504
01:36:41,492 --> 01:36:42,960
不,真的。你选择。
No, really. You choose.

1505
01:36:44,262 --> 01:36:45,496
真的?
Really?

1506
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:47,533
给我们看看你喜欢的。
Yeah, show us something you like.

1507
01:36:47,566 --> 01:36:51,369
这是……你看过《帕丁顿熊2》吗?
This is... Have you ever seen Paddington 2?

1508
01:37:37,649 --> 01:37:41,386
你是尼克他妈的……
You're Nick Fucking...

1509
01:37:47,626 --> 01:37:49,427
Whoa! Cage!
