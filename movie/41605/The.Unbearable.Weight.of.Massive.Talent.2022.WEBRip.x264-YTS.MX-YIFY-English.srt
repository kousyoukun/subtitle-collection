1
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,428
I meant to get a haircut.

2
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,103
I got a present for ya', Casey.

3
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,479
<i>Casey, sweetie,</i>

4
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:48,833
<i>you take your daddy's
present now.</i>

5
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:52,652
Whoa.

6
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,761
<i>I got a picture of you, too.</i>

7
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,068
Maria!

8
00:01:11,303 --> 00:01:13,405
No! No, no! No!

9
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:15,140
<i>Happy birthday, darlin'.</i>

10
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:28,420
No!

11
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,707
Whoa!

12
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:07,860
Thank you.

13
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:09,303
<i>Obviously, you've seen
Mankiewicz's </i>House of Strangers.

14
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:10,739
It's one of my
all-time favorite movies.

15
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,603
That's exactly what your
script reminded me of.

16
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,766
The power struggle,

17
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,501
the fight for relevance.
Yeah. Yeah.

18
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,211
And you're gonna think
this sounds a little crazy,

19
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,337
but in some ways,
it's <i>King Lear.</i>

20
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:20,606
It's <i>King Lear.</i>
Yeah, exactly.

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,240
See, I knew you'd understand

22
00:02:22,273 --> 00:02:23,417
what I'm trying to do
with this film.

23
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,910
Right.

24
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,445
David, I don't know
what to say exactly,

25
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,314
except this is the role
of a lifetime

26
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:31,717
and I'd really love
to be a part of this.

27
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,528
Cool, man. I'll just give you
a shout in a couple of days.

28
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:35,688
Oh. If you're worried
about the Boston accent,

29
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,222
I can do the Boston accent.

30
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:38,466
I've been working on it
all week.

31
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,892
I'm not worried, Nick.

32
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,469
Okay, well, if you have
any other questions

33
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,729
or you just wanna talk,
give me a call.

34
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,966
Or if you'd like me to, uh...
to read...

35
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,366
You don't need to read for me.

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,301
Of course not.

37
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:51,737
And obviously, I'm not going to.

38
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,606
Obviously.

39
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,349
But I bet a part of you would
love to hear me read, right?

40
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:56,474
I mean, why wouldn't you?

41
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,209
If I were you,
I'd want to hear it.

42
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,879
Seriously, I don't want you to read.
Okay.

43
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:01,647
Anyway, this is me,
so I'm gonna...

44
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,349
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna read.

45
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:06,686
"It's a foregone conclusion,
Jimmy.

46
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,988
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain

47
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:10,823
"to send a message to the body.

48
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,659
"So, by the time your bullets
hit me, my cerebral cortex

49
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,870
"will have transmitted a signal

50
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,327
"to the 17 healthy muscles

00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,698

52
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,001
"And before your asshole

53
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,903
"your medulla oblongata

54
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:26,872
"will be splattered

55
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,774
"And if that's the last thing
I accomplish

56
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,576
"on this beautiful green Earth,"

57
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,980
"well, then, ha, I say, ha,
what a way to fucking go."

58
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:39,250
Holy shit.

59
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:44,557
I can do another if you want.

60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,430
Damn, man!

61
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:54,667
That was good, right?
Felt good.

62
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,268
Mankiewicz? Whoo-hoo!
Incredible pull.

63
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:59,337
I know.
It just popped into my head.

64
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,306
Well, good.
I'm happy for you.

65
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:05,410
Because, honestly, man,
you really need this.

66
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:07,378
What?
What is that supposed to mean?

67
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:09,882
You get it.
This could be a game changer.

68
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,927
I don't need a game changer.
If it happens, it happens.

69
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,695
If it doesn't, I'll just keep working.
That's what I do.

70
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,689
I'm just saying, you could be
a little more strategic.

71
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,490
Make more movie star choices.

72
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,458
It's like Miles Davis told me...

73
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,532
"Sometimes, it's the notes"

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,762
"you don't play."

75
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,329
Miles Davis was a heroin addict.

76
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:25,607
I mean, I love him,
he was a maestro,

77
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,032
but I'm happy,

78
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,477
I'm healthy when I'm working.
I'm an actor.

79
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,935
No, you're a fucking movie star!

80
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,402
And don't you ever forget that!

81
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:33,014
Okay, I don't need this.
I don't need this.

82
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,974
Get out of my car.
Nicky, get out of my car.

83
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,642
I don't need this.

84
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,352
I need this.

85
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:49,354
This could be a game changer.

86
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:51,066
So, you're not happy
with how your career is going

87
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,726
because you seem to be
working all the time.

88
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,428
Well, I never viewed it
as a career, only as work.

89
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:58,507
And what's wrong with that?

90
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,099
I mean, in any other job,

91
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,600
hard work is something
to behold,

92
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,002
but with film performance,

93
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:04,445
"You're making
too many movies, Nick."

94
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:05,805
"You're working
too hard, Nick."

95
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,348
"Have the audience
miss you more, Nick."

96
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,607
I mean, "Hello, it's my job."

97
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,909
"I pay my bills."

98
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,610
"I feed my family.
You're annoying."

99
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,912
My gosh!

100
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,781
Yeah.

101
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,583
So, what's the worry here, Nick?

102
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,450
You've lost
some of your ability,

103
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:21,419
your talent as an actor?

104
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,589
No.

105
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,490
Uh...

106
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,392
No, it's just that
I really want this.

107
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:28,727
This is the role of a lifetime.

108
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,663
It's a great part.

109
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:33,566
Well, how do you think your
relationship with your work

110
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,968
affects your relationship
with your daughter?

111
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:38,003
Let's bring Addy into this,
shall we?

112
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:42,141
What?
Oh, you don't have to do that.

113
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,609
You guys can keep talking.

114
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:44,944
Well, I'll just finish with,

115
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,453
a role like this
doesn't come along every day.

116
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:47,646
And now, I'm gonna zip it.

117
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,781
- I zipped it good.
- Addy.

118
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:50,950
How do you think
your dad's anxiety

119
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,651
over his career
has affected you?

120
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,153
Well, his career is pretty much

121
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,721
the only thing we talk about.

122
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:57,590
That or he makes me watch
old movies,

123
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,158
and then discuss them.

124
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:01,727
Which is really just him
lecturing me for two hours.

125
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,495
It's a conversation.
It's more of a conversation.

126
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,465
He made me watch
this bizarre old movie.

127
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:10,135
What was it called?
The Island of Dr. Calamari?

128
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,138
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>
And did you like it, Addy?

129
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,473
It's one of my favorite films.
Have you seen it?

130
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:16,675
No, I have not.

131
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,144
It's about this insane
old doctor

132
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,413
who has a sleepwalker
completely under his spell.

133
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,783
This crazy old loon.

134
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,721
Can you imagine
how horrifying that would be?

135
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:29,931
To be completely
under someone's spell?

136
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:31,824
And you liked it, right?

137
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:33,635
I mean, you like the painted
sets, and the makeup...

138
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,927
No, I did not.

139
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,128
Sounds to me like

140
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:38,097
maybe she didn't want to see
the movie.

141
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,531
Did you think about that, Nick?

142
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,900
About what she wants?

143
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,868
Cheryl, come on.
Is that a real question?

144
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,037
What do you think
he's gonna say?

145
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,941
She has an amazing
visual sensibility. Always has.

146
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,619
We're very close,
and within that closeness,

147
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,544
I was able to ascertain...

148
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,183
Hey, honey.
Hi, Mom.

149
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,519
Bye, Addy. I love you.

150
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:04,223
Oh, no, what happened?

151
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,225
Oh, she's mad at me
because we watched

152
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,761
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>
together and she hated it,

153
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,730
which I find odd, given how
mature her taste normally is.

154
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,532
Wait, you're surprised
your teenage daughter

155
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,734
didn't wanna watch an insane

156
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,603
100-year-old German film
with you?

157
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,672
Yes.
Oh, my God. Okay.

158
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,040
Well, it's not just that.

159
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,517
You know, she's never read
Mary Shelley,

160
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,677
or Jane Austen, or even Twain.

161
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,813
What a little philistine.
Should we disown her?

162
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,949
She thought Humphrey Bogart
was a porn star.

163
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,250
Yeah...

164
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:33,786
What, really?
Yeah.

165
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:35,988
That's disappointing.

166
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:38,590
Unless there is a porn star
called Humphrey Bogart.

167
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,859
That would work, wouldn't it?
Humphrey. Hump.

168
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,529
No?

169
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,030
Look, you're just...

170
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,932
You're at a tricky stage
right now

171
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,233
with her, okay?

172
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,702
And if you don't learn
to connect,

173
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:50,970
it's gonna stay broken for...

174
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,138
What the fuck are you smiling at?
Huh?

175
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,540
Why are you smiling?
I'm not.

176
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:55,908
You are.
Okay.

177
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,985
Olivia, I'm up for
a very exciting movie.

178
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,777
And I think it's gonna happen.

179
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,255
Oh, my God. Look, will
you do me a favor? Yes.

180
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,747
Turn up for her birthday party.

181
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,549
Of course.
Of course.

182
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:04,917
Gosh!

183
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,086
Hey, Fink, let's meet up.
I have some questions.

184
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,954
I don't know.
I just really want this.

185
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,690
I mean, this is the role of
a lifetime, and as my agent...

186
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,027
Nick, I've got
a good feeling, okay?

187
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,862
Okay.
Now, come on.

188
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,897
I know how tense you get.

189
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,100
This is going to help you relax.

190
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,068
Fuck!

191
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,137
Oh, my!
Fuck, I love this so much.

192
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,308
Is this supposed to hurt
this much? Fuck!

193
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,243
It is.
The more pain the better.

194
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,845
Fuckin'...

195
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:35,314
Why?
It's good for circulation.

196
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,824
So, Nick, we got another offer.

197
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,898
Just came in this morning.

198
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,761
Excellent. What's it about?

199
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,196
It's about a million bucks.

200
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,766
What is it?

201
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,200
A birthday party, Fink?

202
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,102
What are you even talking about?

203
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,604
You go, and I don't know,

204
00:08:58,637 --> 00:08:59,914
tell some stories,
make 'em laugh.

205
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:02,041
Make 'em laugh?
Like... Like a circus clown?

206
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,575
A trained seal?

207
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,182
Nick, I got a call from your
business manager, Kenny.

208
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:12,327
You've been living at the
Sunset Tower for over a year.

209
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,853
And so?
They love having me there.

210
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,623
You owe them $600,000.

211
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,124
They sent the bills to Kenny.

212
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,760
I'll take care of it.

213
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,063
Kenny says you still have
substantial debts.

214
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,799
And now, the divorce,
and your spending habits

215
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,867
and, and, and...
Okay, I'm gonna deal

216
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,669
with all that, Fink.

217
00:09:30,702 --> 00:09:32,971
You know I will.

218
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,107
But I'm gonna get this next role

219
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,143
and when I do,
all of that changes.

220
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,313
Then, I'm back.

221
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:44,616
And, by the way,
not that I went anywhere.

222
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,151
Not that you went anywhere.

223
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,619
You never shit on yourself.

224
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,322
Come on!
Never shit on yourself.

225
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:06,738
Fink, hold on a second.
Let me get somewhere quiet.

226
00:10:08,273 --> 00:10:10,375
Fink, you still there?
I can hear you now.

227
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,144

<i>- I talked to David.</i>

Okay.

260
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:41,767
When she was nine years old,

261
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,037
my daughter and I
took our first trip together.

262
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,206
We drove overnight,

263
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,942
across the desert,
to the Grand Canyon.

I pulled over
to the side of the road

268
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:01,320

on my shoulder

00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:42,441
it was a tremendous...

323
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,511
honor...

324
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,282
to be a small part

325
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:53,653
of one of the oldest
of human traditions,

326
00:15:55,387 --> 00:16:00,292
storytelling and mythmaking.

327
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:01,594
<i>Ah, fuck, man, I'm sorry.</i>

328
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,337
<i>I'm driving through the hills.
One more time.</i>

329
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,497
I said I'm quitting...

330
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,335
<i>Back to our main news story</i>

331
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:12,170
<i>as Catalan's
presidential candidate</i>

332
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,371
<i>Charles Delgado's daughter</i>

333
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,340
<i>was kidnapped on Monday.</i>

334
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,151
<i>The police have confirmed
that they have no information</i>

335
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:18,410
<i>as to her whereabouts.</i>

336
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:19,721
<i>They have asked anyone

337
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,279
<i>What do you say</i>

338
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,281
<i>we cut the chitchat, a-hole?</i>

339
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,750
<i>You almost got me killed twice.</i>

340
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,752
Okay.

341
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,676
I'm in position.

342
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,377
<i>All right,
as soon as I have eyes</i>

343
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,689
<i>on Baldassari,
you move in and take him.</i>

344
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:54,714
Copy that.

345
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:00,686
Wait, wait, wait.
It's not Baldassari.

346
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,420
What the fuck is happening
right now?

347
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:05,390
Martin, talk to me.
Who's on the plane?

348
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:08,426
I don't know
if I'm losing my goddamn mind,

349
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,329
but I'm pretty sure
that's the actor Nick Cage.

350
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,098
That motherfucker
from <i>Moonstruck?</i>

351
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,700
<i>Moonstruck?</i> No.
From <i>Face/Off.</i>

352
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,502
Wait, wait, wait.

353
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,070
Why the fuck is Nick Cage
on this plane?

354
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:22,742
You know what?
We're pulling out.

355
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,819
<i>I don't like this.
Get out of there.</i>

356
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,277
Martin.

357
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,579
<i>No, get out of there.
Now.</i>

358
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,251
<i>Vivian, do you copy?
I said, do you copy?</i>

359
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,352
You know what?

360
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:36,421
No.

361
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:37,499
What do you mean, no?
No, no, no.

362
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,363
What are you doing?
Vivian, what are you doing?

363
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,694
Thank you.

364
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,462
This is our shot.
<i>No, get out.</i>

365
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,364
Vivian, get the fuck
out of there right...

366
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,836
Nicolas Cage! Oh, my God!
You're so fucking awesome!

367
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,705
I love you!
Oh, thank you.

368
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,374
Oh, me and my nephew Raymond
just watched <i>Croods 2.</i>

369
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,277
<i>Dude! Cracked us up.</i>

370
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,813
Can I get a selfie?
Sure.

371
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,323
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
No, I like that movie, too.

372
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,391
You did so good
in that movie, man.

373
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,650
Thank you.
My goodness.

374
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,117
I made that movie
with Emma Stone.

375
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,553
You did?
She's one of my favorites.

376
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,764
- But you were the best.
- Well, thank you.

377
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,221
We look good.

378
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,299
Well, say hi
to your nephew for me.

379
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,625
Okay. Yeah.
Raymond. Okay.

380
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,560
Thank you.
All right, bye.

381
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:17,897
Dropped that GPS on him.

382
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,398
Are you out of your mind?
He's a fucking civilian.

383
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,801
<i>He's an actor.</i>

384
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,377
Do you remember
what went down in Lisbon?

385
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:24,737
Fuck Lisbon, man!

386
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,372
That was kind of loud.

387
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:29,842
But fuck Lisbon.
That wasn't my fault.

388
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,343
And by the way,

389
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,545
have you seen <i>Croods 2?</i>
<i>No.</i>

390
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,145
I'm 44 years old.

391
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,781
Why the fuck
would I see <i>Croods 2?</i>

392
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:36,882
I'm picking you up.

393
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,634
Yeah, Fink, can you hold on?

394
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,578
Excuse me, it's Los Angeles calling.
I need to take this.

395
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,236
Just two minutes.
Of course.

396
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:00,305
Can you hold one second?
I'm getting on a boat.

397
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:02,340
Thank you. Yeah.

398
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,343
I mean, what do we know
about this guy anyway?

399
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:10,281
Is he a Spanish Dr. No?
Is he into something strange?

400
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,684
<i>Allan did some research.
Hold on.</i>

401
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,284
<i>Allan, what does this guy do?</i>

402
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,887
<i>He owns olive groves apparently.</i>

403
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,822
Also, he wrote this screenplay,

404
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,724
and he wants Nick to star in it.

405
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,392
Throw that in the fucking trash.

406
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,794
<i>Nick, you're fine.</i>

407
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,505
It's not like he's gonna
want you to suck his dick

408
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,664
or fuck his wife,

409
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:25,874
or watch you watch him
fuck his wife.

410
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,733
I wouldn't think so.
<i>Relax.</i>

411
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,535
<i>Have fun and give me a call
when it's done.</i>

412
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,728
You can tell me all about it.

413
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,345
Nice place.

414
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,414
Maybe I ought to get into
the olive business.

415
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,449
Mr. Cage, I...
Yeah, excuse me. Real quick.

416
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:45,794
The guy that owns this house,
what's his name?

417
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,219
Javi.
Yeah, Javi.

418
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,956
Is Javi going to want me to,
uh, you know...

419
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,893
I'm not sure I understand.

420
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,637
Look, if Javi wants me to suck
his dick, or fuck his wife,

421
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,362
or watch me watch him
fuck his wife,

422
00:19:57,395 --> 00:19:58,807
that's a no-go.
You understand? It's <i>no bueno.</i>

423
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,666
I think so.
Okay, and if Javi...

424
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,767
I am Javi.

425
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,710
Nick Cage.

426
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,514
So, how was it?

427
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,483
It was fine, normal.
No big deal.

428
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,653
Come on. Tell me the truth.
Okay, okay.

429
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,588
He was incredible.
Was he?

430
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,989
But also, like, super cool.

431
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,791
He was a little taller
than I had imagined

432
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,703
because you know they say
actors are pretty short.

433
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,761
So, was he short?

434
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:29,929
No.
No?

435
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:30,963
He was...

436
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,966
just right.

437
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,039
Okay, but did he say anything
about your screenplay?

438
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,879
No. He didn't bring it up,
I didn't bring it up.

439
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,271
It wasn't the right time.

440
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,640
Just think about
how would it feel

441
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,609
to say in front of everyone
at the party

442
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,780
that Nicolas Cage is starring
in a movie that you wrote.

443
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,981
I don't know, Gabriela,

444
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,454
maybe I am living
in a fantasy world.

445
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,416
I mean, look who
we're talking about here.

446
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,651
The man is a legend!

447
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,029
Hi.

448
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:08,534
Hey.

449
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,042
Cheers.

450
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:28,486
Huh?

451
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,421
What?

452
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,566
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
I thought that...

453
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,390
Did you say...
No, I did...

454
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:33,993
Oh, never mind.

455
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,508
Yeah, so along those
same lines, I was wondering...

456
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,642
and it's totally okay
if you haven't,

457
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,034
but I was just wondering

458
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,578
if you had a chance
to read my screenplay?

459
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,004
Javi!

460
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:49,575
Can I come or it's only for VIP?

461
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,377
Uh, Mr. Cage, this is Ms.
Gabriela Lucchesi. Hi.

462
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,947
She runs all of
our agricultural operations.

463
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,982
And this is my cousin.

464
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,818
Lucas Gutierrez.

465
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:02,621
Mr. Cage, we obviously are
very excited to have you here.

466
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,889
What are you working on next?

467
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,058
Well, that's a tough question

468
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,426
for an actor to get,
but it's fine.

469
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:11,429
Oh.
'Cause I'm no longer an actor.

470
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:12,798
I've retired.

471
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,935
What?
What do you mean, retired?

472
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,671
So, what are you going
to do now?

473
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,942
Live the life of a house cat.

474
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,144
Because it's just a matter
of time

475
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,681
before the great power plant
upstairs turns off the juice

476
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,017
and we retreat to
the black pit of nothingness

477
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,619
from whence we came.

478
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,692
So, tell us
about making <i>The Rock.</i>

479
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,962
Bet you wish you were still
making movies

480
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,964
like that, huh, Mr. Cage?

481
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,568
Must have been nice
to have been a star.

482
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,670
And now...

483
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,665
Mr. Cage? Wake up.

484
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,133
Jesus Christ!

485
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,736
So, Mr. Gutierrez has been

486
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,470
waiting all day for you
to get up.

487
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,839
He really wants to show you

488
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,216
one of his favorite places
of all Spain.

489
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,209
It's called the cliffs
of Cap de Formentor.

490
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,645
Yeah, see, well,
I'm very jet lagged,

491
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,547
so I won't be attending that,
okay?

492
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,615
Thank you.

493
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,587
Oh, my God!
Mr. Cage.

494
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,555
If Mr. Gutierrez
is asking you

495
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,990
to go with him
and see the cliffs,

496
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,635
you're gonna go with him
and see the cliffs.

497
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:47,993
And you're gonna love
the cliffs.

498
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,561
Even if you hate the cliffs!

499
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,630
Are we clear?

500
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,568
Gabriela said you are really
excited about the cliffs.

501
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,606
Yeah, very much so.
It's just...

502
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,942
I'm not feeling tip-top
right now,

503
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,743
so if you wanna
go out there alone,

504
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,513
I could go back to the room...
Oh, shit!

505
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,981
Shit!
What?

506
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,153
We must go now.

507
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,621
Hey!

508
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,456
Javi!

509
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,928
Javi!

510
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,530
What is going on?

511
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,698
Faster!

512
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:27,533
What are we running from?

513
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,834
The General!

514
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,603
Javi!

515
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,240
Hey!

516
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,018
You need to tell me right now
what the hell is going on,

517
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,277
or I'm getting my shit,

518
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,621
and I'm going back
to Los Angeles.

519
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,646
The General!

520
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,084
The General forbade me
to see his daughter Matilda.

521
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,787
But we defied his orders!

522
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,992
And now,
he wants to end my life.

523
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,526
Can't you see him?

524
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,034
All right, all right, I get it.

525
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,235
You're making this up?

526
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,803
What is this?

527
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:08,107
Like a little Stanislavski
improv thing?

528
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,608
Well, you can stop.

529
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,577
Stanislavski?
Is he part of the resistance?

530
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,646
Stop! I am your guest!

531
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,082
Gabriela ripped the bedspread
off me this morning.

532
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:20,119
Now you're sending me on,
like, a wild goose chase!

533
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:22,654
I'm sorry, but you can't
quit acting! You can't!

534
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,189
That's none of your business.

535
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:27,593
Whether you like it or not,
you have a gift.

536
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:32,097
And that gift brings light
and joy to an increasingly

537
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,868
dark and broken world!

538
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:39,338
And to turn your back
on that gift

539
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,575
is to turn your back
on the entire human race.

540
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,078
The human race?

541
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,180
I'm afraid so.

542
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,149
What am I gonna do?

543
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,650
Oh, wow.
If we don't go now,

544
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,119
they will fucking kill us!

545
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,654
These people smell blood

546
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,898
and they come running.
What am I gonna do?

547
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,366
They're almost to the edge
of the forest.

548
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,858
I can hear them.

549
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,827
And Matilda,
she is waiting down the coast.

550
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,563
We have to go now!
We have to jump!

551
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,974
You're in an untenable
situation.

552
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,076
You know that, right?

553
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,112
So tell me one thing.

554
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,315
Do you love her?

555
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,384
I've always loved her.

556
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,688
Then let's get you
out of here alive.

557
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,364
Oh, shit!

558
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,337
Fuck!

559
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,772
Oh, God!

560
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,073
I didn't know there was a cliff!

561
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,808
I didn't know it was that high!

562
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,076
We could have died!

563
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,147
You're a wild man.

564
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,056
I prefer bourbon, but thank you.

565
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,622
God, this place is stunning.

566
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,358
I bet my daughter

567
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,327
would like it out here.
It'd be good for her.

568
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,995
Are you two close?

569
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,065
Well, it's impossible to be
close with a 16-year-old.

570
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,300
But I've tried to be there
for her. It's just...

571
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,769
There's no script for parenting.

572
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,739
Thank God for my ex, Olivia.

573
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,274
How did you meet Olivia?

574
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,677
She was a make-up artist
on <i>Captain Corelli's Mandolin.</i>

575
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,146
Beautiful film.
Thank you.

576
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,981
Underrated for sure.

577
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,182
We just hit it off, you know.

578
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,818
She was funny, smart, beautiful.

579
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,086
So, what happened?

580
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,055
What happened?

581
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,029
What about you?
Ever been married? Kids?

582
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:45,063
No.

583
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,668
There is one woman, but, uh,

584
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,474
sometimes circumstances
get in the way of love

585
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,242
and that's just the way it is.

586
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,184
Anyway, Mr. Cage,

587
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,052
what is your favorite movie?

588
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,489
Oh... Favorite movie?

589
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:15,427
Oh, wow! I mean, that...
That is, uh...

590
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,897
That's one of those questions
that's impossible to answer.

591
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:23,335
Because, you see,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

592
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,204
You can't just limit it to one.

593
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,307
It depends upon your mood,
the seasons.

594
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,909
All right, let's do top three.
You start.

595
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:33,011
Number one, <i>Face/Off.</i>

596
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,179
Oh, thank you.

597
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:37,482
Woo is a maestro.
Thank you.

598
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,886
Number two, let me think...

599
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:43,822
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

600
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,191
You love <i>Caligari?</i>
I love <i>Caligari.</i>

601
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:49,494
Wow! I was beginning to think
I was the only one.

602
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,396
You gonna run
the table here, Jav?

603
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,834
It's hard. It's like you said,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

604
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,904
Thank you.

605
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:01,373
Look, can you just stop stalling

606
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,041
and answer the question?

607
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,143
What is your third favorite
movie of all time?

608
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,516
<i>Paddington 2.</i>

609
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,818
What?

610
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,554
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,
Paddington 2.</i>

611
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:15,954
Connect those dots.

612
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,365
I mean, I don't wanna be
a snob, but...

613
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,957
I cried through
the entire thing.

614
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,425
It made me want
to be a better man.

615
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:23,028
Bullshit, man!

616
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,037
<i>Paddington 2</i> is incredible.

617
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:35,407
I fucking told you.

618
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,347
Truth or dare, Nick?

619
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,283
Truth.

620
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,025
Did you hate my screenplay?
It's okay if you did.

621
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,326
I just need to know.

622
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,194
You wrote a script?

623
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,997
I sent it to your agent.

624
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,275
He was supposed
to give it to you.

625
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,601
Well, he didn't.

626
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,902
I guess I can understand
why he didn't,

627
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,538
but where is it?
I'll read it right now.

628
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,406
Now? Like, right now?
Right now.

629
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,440
Send it.

630
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,521
I sent it.
Fantastic.

631
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:25,157
Let's go into town,
have a celebratory drink.

632
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,025
You can watch me read it.

633
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,994
See where it drags.
It'll be fun.

634
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,128
No.

635
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,131
Honestly, I'm too nervous.

636
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,534
My heart is beating so fast.

637
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,237
I think I need to go to bed.

638
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,009
Listen, Javi, truth.

639
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,445
I wasn't that thrilled
about coming out here,

640
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:49,515
but tonight has been
the most fun

641
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:52,884
I've had in a long, long time.

642
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,120
So, thank you.

643
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,574
Oh. Hey, Nicky.

644
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,241
So, you're unretired then?

645
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,076
That's the idea.

646
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,414
Javi inspired you, did he?
You like this guy?

647
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,517
He has good taste in movies.

648
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,552
Plus, it could be good
for me to do

649
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:30,523
some smaller roles
with great directors.

650
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,958
Some challenging character work.

651
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,160
Huh. So, like, um...
Like what?

652
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,696
The gay uncle

653
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:39,030
in the next Duplass Brothers
movie kind of thing?

654
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,332
Exactly.

655
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,968
What the fuck
are you talking about?

656
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,970
We haven't worked
since you were 15...

657
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,439
forty-one years
to be number seven

658
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,442
on a call sheet of a goddamn
student film.

659
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,043
I think it's a good idea.

660
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,345
You listen to me.

661
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,081
You're Nick fucking...

662
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:08,460
Cage!

663
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,730
Addy doesn't need a struggling
artist for a father.

664
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,398
She needs you to be a star.

665
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,334
Now you get the next one,
baby, and we're back.

666
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,969
Not that we went anywhere.

667
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:21,607
Not that we went anywhere.

668
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:22,941
Come here.

669
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,454
Yeah, Nick Cage smooches good.

670
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:39,424
You tell 'em!
Nick Cage smooches good!

671
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,694
I'll have another one.

672
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,274
Jesus!

673
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,111
What do you guys want?
You want money?

674
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,447
Here, take my watch.
It's not a copy, it's real.

675
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,518
Mr. Cage, we're with the U.S. Government.
We need your help.

676
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,419
The man you're staying with
is the head

677
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,421
of a violent
international arms cartel.

678
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,691
Wait, wait, wait. Javi?

679
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:13,559
He's a ruthless motherfucker.

680
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:15,561
He started small, coastal Spain.

681
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:17,229
But then, he got greedy.

682
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:20,232
Trying to expand
his operations east, west.

683
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,100
Trail of dead bodies
in his wake.

684
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,201
Javi Gutierrez?

685
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,704
Yes, Javi.

686
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:26,347
I don't think we're talking
about the same Javi.

687
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,583
We're definitely talking about
the same fucking Javi.

688
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:28,617
It's the same fucking guy, man.

689
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:30,643
Okay, okay. So, you're CIA,

690
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,410
some kind of intelligence,
right?

691
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,312
And your job
is to read people, yeah?

692
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:36,481
Well, as a thespian,
that is also my job.

693
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:37,726
To understand
people's characters,

694
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,317
to feel what they're feeling.

695
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,522
Which is how I know
that Javi is not a gun dealer.

696
00:33:42,555 --> 00:33:44,222
You're saying
your acting ability

697
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,825
trumps five years of hard data

698
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,360
collected by the world's
finest intelligence agency?

699
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,730
My nouveau shamanic
acting ability?

700
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,097
You better fucking believe it.

701
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,399
Oh! Hey, guys, this sucks.

702
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,503
Uh, Nicolas Cage's nouveau
shamanic acting ability

703
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,572
has determined
that we got the wrong guy.

704
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,140
So, let's pack up our shit
and fucking go home.

705
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,577
Hey, man, don't mind him.
He's all messed up inside.

706
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,112
He just found out his wife's
been fucking his dad.

707
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,815
That's not all the way true.

708
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:12,217
Look,
do you recognize this girl?

709
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,353
No.

710
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,155
It's Maria Delgado.

711
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,291
President of
Catalonia's daughter.

712
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,860
Javi's men kidnapped her
two days ago

713
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,403
to force her father
out of the election

714
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,296
and make way for someone
more cartel-friendly.

715
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,765
Yeah, the U.S.
doesn't like that.

716
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,265
Yeah, look, hey.

717
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:29,602
We need to access
Javi's security cameras.

718
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,112
We can't get anywhere
near that compound

719
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,337
because it's too fortified.

720
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:34,607
And then, you show up.

721
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,308
So, you want me to, what?

722
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,643
Spy on Javi?

723
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:39,144
Bingo.

724
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,713
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

725
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,380
You have a daughter
about her age, right?

726
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:45,317
This came in yesterday.

727
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:50,455
How do you think
you would feel, huh?

728
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,457
Knowing you could have helped?

729
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,159
<i>But you chose not to.</i>

730
00:34:55,628 --> 00:34:58,564
<i>Be a lot of guilt to carry,
wouldn't it?</i>

731
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,701
<i>Because every time
you look at your daughter,</i>

732
00:35:01,734 --> 00:35:03,301
<i>believe me,</i>

733
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,705
<i>you are gonna see
that little girl</i>

734
00:35:05,738 --> 00:35:08,306
<i>buried in a ditch somewhere.</i>

735
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,375
<i>And that will haunt you</i>

736
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,679
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

737
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:24,456
<i>All right, here we go, Nick.</i>

738
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,200
<i>We're going to create
a power blip big enough</i>

739
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,927
<i>to reboot
all the security cameras.</i>

740
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,695
<i>Once that happens,</i>

741
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:31,597
<i>you got exactly four minutes
and ten seconds</i>

742
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,633
<i>to get in and get out
before they come back online.</i>

743
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:37,563
<i>Don't forget.
Set the cameras,</i>

744
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,732
<i>and then grab them
when you leave.</i>

745
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,743
Uh-oh. Oh, shit,
we got a guy coming.

746
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:52,277
<i>Nick, guard on the way.</i>

747
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,512
<i>All right, Nick, stay calm.</i>

748
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:55,014
<i>Just like we talked about.</i>

749
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,783
Take the incapacitating agent
out of the pouch.

750
00:36:57,817 --> 00:36:58,918
<i>Put it in your hand.</i>

751
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,553
<i>Remove the outer layer.</i>

752
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,588
<i>The inner layer
has the chemical on it.</i>

753
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:03,965
<i>Now, if you touch that
to someone's skin,</i>

754
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:05,524
<i>they'll be out in seconds.</i>

755
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,694
<i>Now, find a place to hide.</i>

756
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,530
There's nowhere to hide in here.

757
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,566
Hold on.

758
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,004
I think I can hide under the...

759
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,640
I touched my forehead.

760
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,042
You touched your forehead?

761
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,744
I think so.
I'm not 100% sure.

762
00:37:24,777 --> 00:37:26,277
Did you or didn't you?

763
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,671
You know what?
I don't think I did.

764
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:33,586
I did. I did.

765
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,420
<i>Nick, listen to me right now.</i>

766
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,065
You have 30 seconds until
you're drooling on the floor.

767
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,925
<i>Go back into the pouch
and get the antidote ASAP.</i>

768
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,296
It's locked.

769
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,632
<i>Where's the key
that we gave you?</i>

770
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,968
Inside with the antidote.

771
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:52,303
Oh, fuck this shit!
Okay. Oh, shit. Okay.

772
00:37:55,808 --> 00:37:57,910
<i>Okay, Nick,
there's a window to your left.</i>

773
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,979
Go out that window, get outside,

774
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:01,479
go across the ledge, okay?

775
00:38:01,514 --> 00:38:03,082
Scoot across the ledge,

776
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,875
<i>and then climb into
the security room window.</i>

777
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,596
What the fuck is wrong with
you? He's three stories up.

778
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,740
He's stoned out of his mind.

779
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:13,926
<i>Hola.</i>

780
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:18,496
<i>Do it now, Nick! Now!
He's getting closer.</i>

781
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:20,431
He's fucking dead. He's dead.

782
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:23,035
Martin, I can hear you.

783
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,414
Come on, Nick.
You can do this, okay?

784
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,449
Keep moving.
Keep moving.

785
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,452
<i>Hola?</i>

786
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,662
I can't feel my legs.

787
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,697
You know, I really enjoyed
working for the CIA.

788
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,099
Can't wait to move back home
and work at fucking Sonic.

789
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:55,835
Shit!

790
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,404
Like rubber.

791
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,941
Come on, Nick, you got this.
Keep moving, okay?

792
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,814
<i>Hold on.
We got a guard in the room.</i>

793
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,484
<i>Wake up, Nick.</i>

794
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:17,623
<i>Okay, go, go, go, Nick.</i>

795
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:19,725
I love you.

796
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,994
<i>Stay with me.
Stay awake.</i>

797
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:24,096
<i>Keep moving.
You can do this.</i>

798
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:25,598
<i>Pull your legs in now.</i>

799
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:26,932
<i>Pull your legs in.</i>

800
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:34,106
I can't move.

801
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:36,041
Then you're gonna die.
Do you wanna die tonight?

802
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:37,776
This is not how you die.

803
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,578
I think it is.

804
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:50,656
Come on.

805
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,191
Come on, you did it.
You're in there.

806
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,826
Do it, do it!
Stay awake!

807
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,628
<i>Come on!
Come on, Nick!</i>

808
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,063
Come on.
Come on.

809
00:39:58,097 --> 00:39:59,430
Come on.
You got it.

810
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:00,966
You got it. You got it.

811
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,134
You got it.
You got it.

812
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,939
Oh, for fuck's sake, man!
Wake up!

813
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:08,073
<i>- Wake up.
- Wake up.</i>

814
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:09,808
<i>Get up, Nick. Get up.</i>

815
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:10,943
<i>Get up.</i>

816
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:12,912
Come on, Nick.

817
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:15,080
Come on! Get up!

818
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:16,481
<i>Get up, Nick.</i>

819
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:21,687
Action!

820
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:27,993
Oh, my God!

821
00:40:28,027 --> 00:40:29,628
Yes!

822
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:31,697
How is he up?
Trained actor.

823
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,232
All right, man, we in.

824
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:36,869
You know, it didn't feel great
betraying Javi like that.

825
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:39,838
Especially, since I'm still
not convinced he's your guy.

826
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,707
But the strange thing is...

827
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,884
I can see myself
doing more of this stuff.

828
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,643
You know, spycraft.

829
00:40:44,677 --> 00:40:46,845
Subterfuge. What have you.

830
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,614
I think I might have
a real gift for it.

831
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,582
Good, 'cause we got
another mission for you.

832
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:53,052
No, no, no! Fuck that!

833
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:54,820
It was terrifying.

834
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:56,932
I'm about to leave for the
airport after the party, so...

835
00:40:56,956 --> 00:41:00,526
Nick, our intel suggests that
Javi is holding Maria Delgado

836
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,528
on the compound right now.

837
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:04,029
- On the compound?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

838
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:05,731
We need you to help us find her.

839
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,032
Which means we need you

840
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:08,934
to figure out a way
to stay a little longer.

841
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:12,871
Vivian, I can't do this.

842
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:14,907
Yes, you can.
We just saw you do it.

843
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:17,242
That little girl, Nick?

844
00:41:17,276 --> 00:41:18,844
She doesn't have anybody else.

845
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:21,780
<i>Just you.</i>

846
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:25,184
<i>And if you leave,</i>

847
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:27,586
<i>I don't know
what's gonna happen to her.</i>

848
00:41:43,202 --> 00:41:45,938
I just want to thank you all
for coming tonight.

849
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:48,040
It means more to me
than you can know.

850
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:50,209
And I would like to tell
a story.

851
00:41:51,143 --> 00:41:53,112
A few years ago,

852
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:55,047
my relationship with my father

853
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,116
had deteriorated to the point

854
00:41:57,149 --> 00:41:59,985
where we were
no longer speaking.

855
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:01,162
He could be extremely difficult,

856
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,788
my father.

857
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,690
And to be fair,
maybe I am not much better.

858
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,694
But when he got sick,

859
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,830
I realized

860
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:13,599
I didn't want to lose him

861
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:16,769
before we could repair
our broken relationship.

862
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,171
But I didn't know how.

863
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,673
And then, one day,

864
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:24,843
about a week before he died,
it happened.

865
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:25,978
A miracle.

866
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:27,946
I looked up...

867
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:33,819
and I saw on a tiny
little hospital TV...

868
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:36,655
<i>Guarding Tess.</i>

869
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:40,793
We disagreed about literally
everything, my father and I.

870
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:42,094
Except for this movie.

871
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,264
We both loved it.

872
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:48,233
We would quote it
back and forth.

873
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:51,370
In a way, my father was Tess.

874
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:52,871
The former First Lady.

875
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:55,841
And I was Doug Chesnic.

876
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:57,076
The Secret Service agent

877
00:42:57,109 --> 00:42:58,744
charged with taking care of him.

878
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:04,783
That movie brought us together.

879
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:10,856
So, on behalf of
my late father and myself,

880
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,259
I want to thank you.

881
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,333
I bet you didn't know
Doug Chesnic could have

882
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,268
such an impact on someone.

883
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:26,805
Well, Doug was
a complicated guy.

884
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:28,273
He had, um,

885
00:43:29,408 --> 00:43:30,943
competing allegiances

886
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,311
and sometimes,

887
00:43:32,344 --> 00:43:35,781
being in the skin
of a character like that

888
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:38,350
can take its toll.

889
00:43:38,383 --> 00:43:39,885
Well, thank you
for your sacrifice.

890
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,220
It was extraordinary.

891
00:43:41,253 --> 00:43:42,955
Thank you for having me.

892
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:45,691
And I'm...

893
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:49,795
I'm...

894
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:53,398
excited to announce that

895
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:58,370
Javi has finally allowed me
to read his screenplay

896
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:00,706
which is fantastic.

897
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,741
It's truly a masterclass.

898
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:05,344
It's easily one of the best
things I've read in years.

899
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:07,346
So, does that mean
that you want to be in it?

900
00:44:07,379 --> 00:44:08,413
I don't.

901
00:44:08,447 --> 00:44:11,884
But what I would like is to

902
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:14,186
spend a little more time here

903
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:17,389
on the compound with you.

904
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,358
Coming up with our own...

905
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:21,426
movie.

906
00:44:22,194 --> 00:44:23,262
What do you say?

907
00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:27,299
I say yes.

908
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:30,702
Yes.

909
00:44:36,275 --> 00:44:38,110
<i>I fired Earl.</i>

910
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:39,320
<i>- This has happened twice now.
- No.</i>

911
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,812
<i>He is a driver</i>

912
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:43,248
<i>in the employ
of the Secret Service.</i>

913
00:44:43,282 --> 00:44:44,726
<i>I can't do anything
about the cook or the nurse.</i>

914
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,218
<i>No, they work for you.</i>

915
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,986
<i>But this guy works for us
and he's gone!</i>

916
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:54,126
<i>Nick.</i>

917
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,337
The security cameras gave us
a probable location for Maria.

918
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:59,031
I'm sending it to you now.

919
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:00,699
<i>Find a way
to get into that room, Nick.</i>

920
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:06,205
Mr. Cage.

921
00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:09,341
Oh, hey, Javi.
Nick.

922
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:11,376
I realized

923
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:15,414
that if we are going to create
a work of art,

924
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:17,382
we can't just sit and stare
at a screen.

925
00:45:18,317 --> 00:45:19,519
We have to open our minds

926
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:21,053
to the infinite possibilities

927
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:22,487
of what the cosmos has to offer.

928
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,857
What have you got there?

929
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,392
Divine inspiration.

930
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,461
LSD.

931
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,903
Fuck it!

932
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:59,324
So, I was thinking
that maybe our movie

933
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:01,059
would be character-driven.

934
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:02,861
Yeah.

935
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:06,465
Something that doesn't rely
on corny special effects.

936
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:08,967
Right. Or like big explosions.

937
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:10,503
It has to be nuanced.

938
00:46:10,536 --> 00:46:12,471
And work on multiple levels.

939
00:46:12,505 --> 00:46:15,274
It should be completely
about performance.

940
00:46:15,307 --> 00:46:18,343
And maybe it's just
the drugs talking,

941
00:46:18,377 --> 00:46:21,113
but what if we had
like a big drug scene?

942
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:24,249
Oh, wow!

943
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:27,953
It's gonna be so fucking good.

944
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:31,256
But, like,

945
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:33,526
what's it about?

946
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,303
<i>In terms of genre,
I like comedies.</i>

947
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:47,472
But not when it's just two
people sitting around talking.

948
00:46:47,507 --> 00:46:51,209
Oh, man,
I can't stand talkie comedies.

949
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:53,579
You gotta have some plot
to drive it forward.

950
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:01,953
It's my daughter.

951
00:47:02,354 --> 00:47:03,388
Oh.

952
00:47:18,638 --> 00:47:19,838
Nick, listen.

953
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:23,375
You know what I was thinking?

954
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:26,478
Maybe we could have, like,
a paranoid thriller-y angle.

955
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:30,115
Ooh. Paranoid angle.
Excellent.

956
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:31,548
Like, see those two guys
over there?

957
00:47:33,452 --> 00:47:34,587
They've been watching us.

958
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,054
Right. Right.

959
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:40,092
Wait, have they been
watching us?

960
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:42,094
I don't know. Have they?

961
00:47:44,496 --> 00:47:47,332
Fuck!

962
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:49,334
Did you see that?
They just looked over at us.

963
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:51,370
Oh, shit!

964
00:47:51,403 --> 00:47:53,972
Oh, shit!
What's going on?

965
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:55,416
No, no, no. Maybe it was
just a coincidence.

966
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,908
I will look again.
Are you ready?

967
00:47:56,942 --> 00:47:58,143
No! Don't make eye contact.

968
00:47:58,176 --> 00:47:59,612
That's how you spook them.

969
00:47:59,645 --> 00:48:01,681
No, that's how you spook a bear.

970
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:03,982
That's right.
That is how you spook a bear.

971
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,585
I apologize.

972
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:08,987
But if you are gonna look,
maybe do like a fake laugh.

973
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,656
A fake laugh? Okay, good.
Yeah.

974
00:48:18,731 --> 00:48:20,165
Oh, no.

975
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:22,968
Okay, okay. Let's...

976
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:25,370
Let's just get up slowly

977
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:27,105
on the count of three

978
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:28,541
and run.

979
00:48:28,574 --> 00:48:30,108
Okay?

980
00:48:30,142 --> 00:48:31,176
One...

981
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,211
Oh, fuck!

982
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:39,985
Go, go, go!

983
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:42,154
Faster!

984
00:48:43,756 --> 00:48:45,257
This is fucking crazy.

985
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:47,560
Oh, shit!

986
00:48:47,593 --> 00:48:48,661
It's too high.

987
00:48:48,694 --> 00:48:50,195
Here.

988
00:48:51,463 --> 00:48:53,465
Use me as a human stool.

989
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:55,568
Do it!

990
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:05,277
Grab my hand.

991
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:07,112
Grab it.

992
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:12,350
You're heavier than you look.

993
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:17,623
I have a very big head.

994
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:20,025
Enormous. An enormous head.

995
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:24,630
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

996
00:49:24,664 --> 00:49:26,532
Will you tell Gabriela
I will miss her?

997
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:28,433
You can tell her yourself.
No.

998
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:31,102
It's okay.
You go live a good life.

999
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,481
I'm not going anywhere
without you!

1000
00:49:32,505 --> 00:49:35,173
Now, grab my hand, soldier!

1001
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:43,114
But then, we will both die

1002
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:45,083
and I could never
live with myself after that.

1003
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:46,351
So you let go.

1004
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:48,453
You let go!

1005
00:49:55,628 --> 00:49:57,128
Goodbye, Nicolas Cage.

1006
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:02,033
I'll never forget you, Javs.

1007
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:03,503
I'll never forget you.

1008
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,339
Now, you get the hell
out of here.

1009
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:11,009
You go!

1010
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:24,222
Mr. Cage?

1011
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:27,192
Javi?

1012
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:29,629
Buddy!
Hey.

1013
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,797
Where'd you come from?

1014
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:34,099
Oh.

1015
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:36,301
Yeah...

1016
00:50:38,103 --> 00:50:39,615
Turns out we could have just
walked around.

1017
00:50:39,639 --> 00:50:41,707
Yeah, I guess so, huh?
Whatever.

1018
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:44,810
There they are.

1019
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:48,814
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Run!

1020
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:52,518
Do you see 'em?

1021
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:54,720
Oh, fuck! Oh!

1022
00:50:54,754 --> 00:50:56,087
Shit!

1023
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:58,356
Ow, ow.

1024
00:51:01,894 --> 00:51:04,396
No, no. I can't drive on acid.
I can't drive on acid.

1025
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,631
You have to drive on acid.

1026
00:51:05,665 --> 00:51:07,198
You are a better driver than me.

1027
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:08,868
How do you know that?

1028
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:10,177
Because I read that you did
all of your own driving stunts

1029
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:11,637
in <i>Gone in 60 Seconds.</i>

1030
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:14,239
Well, that's true. I popped
some good wheelies, right?

1031
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:16,576
The wheelies are amazing.
Now drive the car!

1032
00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:18,476
They're coming! Let's go!

1033
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:33,793
Oh. Holy shit!
What?

1034
00:51:33,826 --> 00:51:35,226
Holy shit!

1035
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,294
What? Do you see 'em?

1036
00:51:36,328 --> 00:51:39,164
No, Nick, I have an idea.

1037
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:41,867
Maybe this movie,
maybe it's about this.

1038
00:51:41,901 --> 00:51:43,536
About us.

1039
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:45,403
Our relationship.

1040
00:51:47,506 --> 00:51:48,574
That's good.

1041
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:51,376
That's good.

1042
00:52:28,948 --> 00:52:30,583
Is anyone in there?

1043
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:31,751
<i>Hola?</i>

1044
00:52:31,784 --> 00:52:32,785
Hello?

1045
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:35,487
Hello?

1046
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:41,359
You want me
to let you in there, huh?

1047
00:52:42,862 --> 00:52:43,863
I do.

1048
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,499
I wanna know what's inside.

1049
00:52:46,532 --> 00:52:48,701
Regardless of what
the consequences are?

1050
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,879
Because once you go in there,

1051
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:03,716
it could change the way
you feel about me.

1052
00:53:09,955 --> 00:53:12,792
Our entire relationship
could change, Nick Cage.

1053
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,262
I need to go in, Jav.

1054
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:19,932
Open the door.

1055
00:53:49,995 --> 00:53:51,496
Is it too much?

1056
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,532
Trippy.

1057
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:56,301
Trippy.

1058
00:53:56,334 --> 00:53:58,804
I know.
I am sorry if it is weird.

1059
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:00,806
Well, it's a good collection.

1060
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,877
It's very thorough.

1061
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,980
"A really elegant string
of pearls configuration."

1062
00:54:09,048 --> 00:54:10,315
<i>The Rock.</i>

1063
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:12,985
"Put the bunny
back in the box."

1064
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:14,452
<i>Con Air.</i>

1065
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:19,525
Well, that's just really creepy.

1066
00:54:19,558 --> 00:54:21,026
No, it's not creepy.

1067
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,494
Oh.

1068
00:54:22,528 --> 00:54:23,929
Is that the chainsaw from <i>Mandy?</i>

1069
00:54:23,963 --> 00:54:25,030
<i>Mandy</i> is a masterpiece.

1070
00:54:27,032 --> 00:54:28,834
You know
those are real guns, right?

1071
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:30,536
Of course they are real.

1072
00:54:32,972 --> 00:54:35,908
Custom Springfield Armory.

1073
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:38,911
Made specifically for the film.

1074
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:40,813
Is this supposed to be me?

1075
00:54:41,547 --> 00:54:42,681
It's...

1076
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:44,583
grotesque.

1077
00:54:44,617 --> 00:54:46,819
Just look at the guns.

1078
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:48,754
If you don't mind me asking,

1079
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:50,990
how much did you pay for this

1080
00:54:51,891 --> 00:54:53,826
disturbing statue?

1081
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:56,061
Hmm. About $6,000.

1082
00:54:57,763 --> 00:54:59,598
I'll give you $20,000 for it.

1083
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:02,701
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage,

1084
00:55:04,537 --> 00:55:05,971
but this is not for sale.

1085
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:15,480
<i>Bad news.
Girl's not there.</i>

1086
00:55:15,514 --> 00:55:18,584
Good news. Script's cooking.

1087
00:55:18,617 --> 00:55:20,886
Feels like
Cassavetes meets Inarritu

1088
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,420
with a dash of Von Trier.

1089
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,790
Nick, but...
I know what you're gonna say.

1090
00:55:24,824 --> 00:55:27,126
Javi has his issues but, my God,

1091
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:30,361
he has an unbelievably
intuitive sense for story.

1092
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:31,997
He kidnapped a young girl.

1093
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:34,533
And every day that passes,
the likelihood goes up

1094
00:55:34,567 --> 00:55:37,570
that she's gonna be murdered
by Javi or one of his men.

1095
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:40,471
What do you want me to do now?

1096
00:55:40,506 --> 00:55:41,674
I don't know.

1097
00:55:41,707 --> 00:55:43,742
I'm still figuring that out.

1098
00:55:43,776 --> 00:55:46,612
But for now, why don't you
add a plotline to your movie

1099
00:55:46,645 --> 00:55:48,047
where someone gets kidnapped?

1100
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,715
That way you can see

1101
00:55:49,748 --> 00:55:51,917
where he might,
theoretically, hide a hostage.

1102
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:53,819
I'm working two jobs here.

1103
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,654
Okay.

1104
00:55:57,656 --> 00:55:59,625
Vivian,

1105
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:02,094
this is a grounded, adult drama

1106
00:56:02,127 --> 00:56:04,395
about two tough, sensitive men

1107
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:05,831
and their unlikely friendship.

1108
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:07,576
They're kind of like
dueling Christ figures.

1109
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,136
Which is obviously a pretty
revolutionary idea in itself.

1110
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,639
But what is not

1111
00:56:13,672 --> 00:56:16,642
a revolutionary idea
is a kidnapping.

1112
00:56:16,675 --> 00:56:18,510
And if I bring that
into the mix,

1113
00:56:18,544 --> 00:56:19,754
Javi's gonna know
something's up.

1114
00:56:19,778 --> 00:56:20,946
He's a hardliner for tone,

1115
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,048
and this mission
will be blown. Okay?

1116
00:56:23,082 --> 00:56:24,817
Jesus fucking Christ!

1117
00:56:27,753 --> 00:56:28,787
You know, Nick,

1118
00:56:28,821 --> 00:56:30,155
I think a kidnapping

1119
00:56:30,189 --> 00:56:32,958
could give this movie
a wider appeal.

1120
00:56:32,992 --> 00:56:34,560
I mean, it's pretty hard

1121
00:56:34,593 --> 00:56:36,494
to find an audience
these days, right?

1122
00:56:36,528 --> 00:56:38,864
Unless you're a Marvel movie,
<i>Star Wars,</i> whatever, yeah.

1123
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:40,208
Yeah, doesn't sound like
this is that.

1124
00:56:40,232 --> 00:56:41,700
No, Vivian, it isn't.

1125
00:56:41,734 --> 00:56:43,869
This is an intelligent film
for grown-ups.

1126
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:45,537
Now, personally,

1127
00:56:45,571 --> 00:56:49,541
I want a smart,
character-driven, adult drama

1128
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:52,111
about real life, real people.

1129
00:56:52,144 --> 00:56:53,746
But the reality is,

1130
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:56,515
most people need a bit of a hook

1131
00:56:56,548 --> 00:56:57,883
to get 'em into the theater.

1132
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,585
Okay, now you're talking
about marketing.

1133
00:56:59,618 --> 00:57:01,153
And if you're talking
about marketing,

1134
00:57:01,186 --> 00:57:03,923
then, yes, you do need a hook
to get them into the theater.

1135
00:57:03,956 --> 00:57:05,991
Well, get 'em
into the theater. Come on.

1136
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:08,426
All you need
is a trailer moment.

1137
00:57:09,161 --> 00:57:10,428
Pull!

1138
00:57:13,832 --> 00:57:16,568
Hold on, hold on.
Your daughter gets kidnapped?

1139
00:57:16,602 --> 00:57:18,003
Yeah, it's a big trailer moment.

1140
00:57:18,037 --> 00:57:19,538
Hey, am I doing this right?

1141
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:20,949
'Cause I had that thing
in my sights.

1142
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:22,041
But who kidnaps her?

1143
00:57:22,074 --> 00:57:23,542
Uh, maybe the barrel's warped.

1144
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:24,586
The barrel
is definitely not warped.

1145
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,611
Who kidnaps her?

1146
00:57:26,245 --> 00:57:27,613
Bad guys.

1147
00:57:28,614 --> 00:57:29,815
We both put our lives

1148
00:57:29,848 --> 00:57:30,959
on the line to save the daughter

1149
00:57:30,983 --> 00:57:32,127
and become better men for it.

1150
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:33,719
It's classic.

1151
00:57:33,752 --> 00:57:34,796
It feels like a completely
different movie.

1152
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,155
Javi, please.

1153
00:57:36,188 --> 00:57:37,923
Just walk down the road
with me on this.

1154
00:57:37,957 --> 00:57:39,625
And then what?

1155
00:57:39,658 --> 00:57:42,728
The finale is about two men
saving the girl?

1156
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:44,096
That's terrible.

1157
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:45,597
Give me the gun.

1158
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,467
You know
the key to shooting well?

1159
00:57:51,003 --> 00:57:52,538
Controlling your breath.

1160
00:57:54,206 --> 00:57:56,141
And you know how to control
your breath, Nick?

1161
00:57:57,176 --> 00:57:58,577
Your heart.

1162
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:01,213
Your heart must be still.

1163
00:58:01,246 --> 00:58:02,581
At peace.

1164
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:05,617
My heart

1165
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:07,052
is not still.

1166
00:58:07,086 --> 00:58:08,854
My heart

1167
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:09,888
is not at peace.

1168
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:14,827
Do you know why?

1169
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,195
Hey, Javi.

1170
00:58:16,228 --> 00:58:18,731
If you're not gonna shoot,
maybe hand me the gun?

1171
00:58:18,764 --> 00:58:20,232
Because you're lying to me.

1172
00:58:20,265 --> 00:58:21,300
What?

1173
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:24,803
Don't fucking lie to me.

1174
00:58:24,837 --> 00:58:25,904
I'm not!

1175
00:58:25,938 --> 00:58:28,640
Don't fucking lie to me!

1176
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:30,275
Oh, my God, I'm not!
I swear!

1177
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:32,811
I know why you keep on talking
about this kidnapped girl.

1178
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:35,881
You feel guilty
about your relationship

1179
00:58:35,914 --> 00:58:37,049
to your own daughter.

1180
00:58:39,184 --> 00:58:41,220
Oh, my God, yes.

1181
00:58:41,253 --> 00:58:43,822
A thousand times, yes.
You are blocked.

1182
00:58:43,856 --> 00:58:45,758
Creatively.

1183
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:47,126
Because you feel guilty

1184
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:48,961
about what kind of father
you have been.

1185
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:51,063
You're right. Yep.

1186
00:58:51,096 --> 00:58:52,131
You're 100% right.

1187
00:58:52,164 --> 00:58:53,232
Pull!

1188
00:59:13,285 --> 00:59:15,220
Vivian, what's going on?

1189
00:59:15,254 --> 00:59:17,623
Nick, you need to get
out of that house immediately.

1190
00:59:17,656 --> 00:59:19,625
<i>The Agency caught a wiretap
on our phones.</i>

1191
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:21,293
<i>Then I picked up a guy
tailing me.</i>

1192
00:59:21,326 --> 00:59:23,896
If they've made me,
they've likely made you.

1193
00:59:23,929 --> 00:59:25,330
All right. Shit.

1194
00:59:25,364 --> 00:59:27,599
<i>Nick, we can no longer
guarantee your safety.</i>

1195
00:59:29,668 --> 00:59:30,702
Jesus Christ!

1196
00:59:30,736 --> 00:59:32,004
You scared the hell out of me.

1197
00:59:32,037 --> 00:59:33,772
Nick,

1198
00:59:33,806 --> 00:59:35,207
I need you to come with me.

1199
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:38,777
Right now?

1200
00:59:41,814 --> 00:59:44,316
I'm sorry to have to
take this step, Nick.

1201
00:59:45,818 --> 00:59:48,253
You don't, though.
You really don't.

1202
00:59:48,287 --> 00:59:49,988
No, it is the only option.

1203
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,193
Can I just call my family
quickly?

1204
00:59:54,226 --> 00:59:55,761
Tell them I love them.

1205
00:59:56,295 --> 00:59:57,729
What?

1206
00:59:57,763 --> 00:59:59,731
There's no need to call them.

1207
00:59:59,765 --> 01:00:00,799
They are here.

1208
01:00:02,067 --> 01:00:03,135
Dad.
Nick.

1209
01:00:03,168 --> 01:00:04,236
Are you okay? What...

1210
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:06,038
What the hell is going on?

1211
01:00:06,071 --> 01:00:07,172
Your friend called to say

1212
01:00:07,206 --> 01:00:09,007
you were so sick
you couldn't talk.

1213
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:10,909
We're worried about you.
Yeah.

1214
01:00:10,943 --> 01:00:12,811
You wanna deal with
me, Javi? You deal with me.

1215
01:00:12,845 --> 01:00:14,246
But I'm begging you, please,

1216
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:15,814
please leave my family
out of this.

1217
01:00:15,848 --> 01:00:17,049
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

1218
01:00:17,082 --> 01:00:18,183
You've left me no choice.

1219
01:00:18,217 --> 01:00:20,385
Are you dying, Dad?
Yes.

1220
01:00:20,419 --> 01:00:21,687
Oh, my God.
What?

1221
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,322
Creatively.
Oh, come on.

1222
01:00:23,355 --> 01:00:24,923
No, physically,
he is tremendous.

1223
01:00:24,957 --> 01:00:27,759
I mean, he will probably
outlive us all.

1224
01:00:27,793 --> 01:00:29,394
So, you're not even sick?

1225
01:00:29,428 --> 01:00:30,829
I'm okay, honey.

1226
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:32,664
I'm fine. I'm okay.
Fuck you.

1227
01:00:32,698 --> 01:00:35,334
Look, I have grown to care
very deeply about your father.

1228
01:00:35,367 --> 01:00:36,935
And ex-husband.

1229
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:38,337
We are working
on a movie together.

1230
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:42,708
A beautiful character-driven,
adult drama.

1231
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:46,845
But he has so many
unresolved issues with you

1232
01:00:46,879 --> 01:00:48,981
that it is beginning to bleed
into the work

1233
01:00:49,014 --> 01:00:50,082
in a negative way.

1234
01:00:50,115 --> 01:00:51,283
Isn't that right, Nick?

1235
01:00:51,316 --> 01:00:53,852
Are you both
out of your fucking minds?

1236
01:00:53,886 --> 01:00:55,754
Well, you see,
he has so many regrets.

1237
01:00:55,787 --> 01:00:58,390
Yeah. Well, here is another
one to add to the list.

1238
01:00:58,423 --> 01:00:59,958
We've been on a plane.

1239
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:01,994
All day!

1240
01:01:02,027 --> 01:01:03,195
I had to cancel clients.

1241
01:01:03,228 --> 01:01:04,897
We were panicking

1242
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:05,864
because we couldn't find
anyone to feed the cats.

1243
01:01:05,898 --> 01:01:07,166
You know, they could be dead

1244
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,967
by the time we get home
after this bullshit.

1245
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:10,969
House smelling like
a dead cat. That's great.

1246
01:01:11,003 --> 01:01:12,371
That's fun.

1247
01:01:12,404 --> 01:01:14,206
Well, I had a cat die
in the kitchen once.

1248
01:01:15,407 --> 01:01:16,808
And my grandmother
was never able

1249
01:01:16,842 --> 01:01:18,143
to get rid of the smell.

1250
01:01:18,177 --> 01:01:19,811
I am very sorry
for the inconvenience,

1251
01:01:19,845 --> 01:01:21,313
but this is an emergency.

1252
01:01:21,346 --> 01:01:23,482
Have lunch with us.

1253
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:25,217
And let him say
what he has to say.

1254
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,985
Don't you think
that's a good idea, Nick?

1255
01:01:30,122 --> 01:01:33,458
Lunch is a wonderful idea, Javi.

1256
01:01:33,492 --> 01:01:36,828
And then, afterwards,
they can go home, right?

1257
01:01:38,964 --> 01:01:40,165
Great.

1258
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:41,900
Let's have some fucking tapas.

1259
01:01:43,503 --> 01:01:45,003
This is so weird.

1260
01:01:45,037 --> 01:01:46,371
Yeah, well...
That's...

1261
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:48,807
What'd you expect?

1262
01:01:50,108 --> 01:01:52,911
I wanna apologize
to both of you.

1263
01:01:54,479 --> 01:01:56,848
I think I should have been
more present

1264
01:01:56,882 --> 01:01:58,984
while I was at home.

1265
01:01:59,017 --> 01:02:03,355
I didn't always need
to be focused on my work.

1266
01:02:03,388 --> 01:02:05,891
My face in a script.

1267
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:11,063
But here's what
I keep coming back to.

1268
01:02:11,096 --> 01:02:14,333
Would either of you
have wanted to prevent me

1269
01:02:14,366 --> 01:02:16,068
from living my artistic dreams?

1270
01:02:16,101 --> 01:02:18,837
Because I sure know
I wouldn't have wanted that

1271
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,305
for either of you.

1272
01:02:24,109 --> 01:02:26,178
We flew to Majorca for that?

1273
01:02:26,211 --> 01:02:27,813
Wow.

1274
01:02:27,846 --> 01:02:29,381
That was fucking pathetic.

1275
01:02:29,414 --> 01:02:31,083
God, it really was, wasn't it?

1276
01:02:31,116 --> 01:02:32,556
No, no, no.
I am honestly speechless.

1277
01:02:32,585 --> 01:02:35,287
Really? Because this shit,
you get used to it.

1278
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,122
Yeah, that's pretty much
par for the course.

1279
01:02:37,155 --> 01:02:38,190
Mmm-hmm.

1280
01:02:40,192 --> 01:02:42,427
Can't we just focus

1281
01:02:42,461 --> 01:02:45,264
on the good times
we did have together?

1282
01:02:45,297 --> 01:02:48,800
Addy, that trip we took
across the desert.

1283
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:50,503
I never showed you this before,

1284
01:02:50,536 --> 01:02:52,505
but I keep this little photo
in my wallet

1285
01:02:52,538 --> 01:02:55,508
to remind me
of all the fun we had.

1286
01:02:56,308 --> 01:02:57,577
And, uh,

1287
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:00,178
I know it wasn't great,

1288
01:03:00,212 --> 01:03:01,847
but that song...

1289
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,550
I meant that moment
that I wrote in that song.

1290
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:06,018
I meant it.

1291
01:03:06,051 --> 01:03:07,919
You didn't write it.

1292
01:03:07,953 --> 01:03:09,288
You got drunk
and you made it up,

1293
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:10,590
because you couldn't stand

1294
01:03:10,623 --> 01:03:12,157
not being
the center of attention

1295
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,292
for two fucking seconds.

1296
01:03:13,325 --> 01:03:14,826
Addy.

1297
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,429
Because everything
always has to be about you.

1298
01:03:18,497 --> 01:03:20,165
What you like.

1299
01:03:20,198 --> 01:03:21,433
What books you've read.

1300
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:23,068
What movies you're into.

1301
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:25,871
It's fucked up, you know?

1302
01:03:26,905 --> 01:03:28,340
Like, I'm your daughter

1303
01:03:29,241 --> 01:03:31,343
and I get nervous.

1304
01:03:31,376 --> 01:03:33,579
Like, debilitating
fucking anxiety

1305
01:03:33,613 --> 01:03:35,380
that if I don't like
what you like,

1306
01:03:35,414 --> 01:03:37,482
you won't like me.

1307
01:03:37,517 --> 01:03:41,621
Addy, I was sharing the things
that were meaningful to me.

1308
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:42,921
That were important to me.

1309
01:03:42,954 --> 01:03:45,123
No, you weren't.
You weren't.

1310
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:46,358
You were trying to mold me

1311
01:03:46,391 --> 01:03:48,026
into this little version of you.

1312
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:49,961
Mold you?

1313
01:03:49,995 --> 01:03:52,297
Guide you.
Addy, I love you.

1314
01:03:52,331 --> 01:03:55,501
I love you more than anything
in the world.

1315
01:03:55,535 --> 01:03:59,071
And I want you to know
I was trying.

1316
01:03:59,104 --> 01:04:00,939
I know.
I know you were trying.

1317
01:04:01,641 --> 01:04:04,076
You're always trying.

1318
01:04:04,109 --> 01:04:06,345
Fuck, that's actually
the saddest part.

1319
01:04:12,484 --> 01:04:14,353
Shit.

1320
01:04:14,386 --> 01:04:16,746
I think we have more work than
I realized, but this is good.

1321
01:04:18,156 --> 01:04:19,559
This is very good.

1322
01:04:19,592 --> 01:04:21,460
This is a good first step.

1323
01:04:23,995 --> 01:04:25,931
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Gutierrez,

1324
01:04:25,964 --> 01:04:27,633
but you have a visitor.

1325
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:28,900
<i>Gracias.</i>

1326
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:37,677
Oh! Hollywood Javi.
There he is.

1327
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,517
I have some news for you.

1328
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,251
Javi Ford Coppola.

1329
01:04:46,284 --> 01:04:48,053
Sit.

1330
01:04:48,086 --> 01:04:49,254
Eat with me.

1331
01:05:02,367 --> 01:05:03,902
Froot Loops?

1332
01:05:05,538 --> 01:05:06,572
Delicious.

1333
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:09,207
Taste it.

1334
01:05:13,478 --> 01:05:14,614
I love Froot Loops.

1335
01:05:24,256 --> 01:05:26,324
Sergio Baldassari?
Huh?

1336
01:05:57,255 --> 01:05:58,256
Hmm.

1337
01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:10,570
Yeah.

1338
01:06:14,774 --> 01:06:17,543
But I can't do
a deal with the Italians

1339
01:06:18,511 --> 01:06:20,178
if I am being betrayed.

1340
01:06:25,217 --> 01:06:27,052
He flew my wife and daughter

1341
01:06:27,085 --> 01:06:28,129
all the way out to Majorca.

1342
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:29,187
My family!

1343
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:30,288
Shit!

1344
01:06:30,322 --> 01:06:31,791
No, don't say "shit"!

1345
01:06:31,824 --> 01:06:33,726
You got us into this.
You get us out of this.

1346
01:06:33,759 --> 01:06:35,260
<i>There's no way</i>

1347
01:06:35,293 --> 01:06:37,128
we can mobilize
an extraction in time.

1348
01:06:37,162 --> 01:06:38,698
Then, what am I supposed to do?

1349
01:06:38,731 --> 01:06:41,399
If you can get Javi alone,
and then take him out,

1350
01:06:41,433 --> 01:06:43,736
<i>it'll buy the Agency time
to get you all out of there.</i>

1351
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:45,538
Do you have access to a firearm?

1352
01:06:46,772 --> 01:06:48,106
I might.

1353
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:49,775
<i>Nick, I'm sorry,</i>

1354
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:51,769
<i>but this is the best way
to safeguard your family.</i>

1355
01:06:56,616 --> 01:06:58,818
Listen, I need you
to be honest with me.

1356
01:06:58,851 --> 01:07:00,118
What the fuck is happening?

1357
01:07:00,151 --> 01:07:01,453
Okay.

1358
01:07:01,486 --> 01:07:03,088
I'm going to tell you something,

1359
01:07:03,121 --> 01:07:04,389
but please don't freak out.

1360
01:07:05,858 --> 01:07:08,059
I'm working for the CIA.

1361
01:07:12,598 --> 01:07:13,809
Are you having
a nervous breakdown?

1362
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:16,401
Probably.
But I'm telling you the truth.

1363
01:07:16,434 --> 01:07:18,514
They wanted some information
on Javi's business dealings

1364
01:07:18,538 --> 01:07:20,138
so I've been helping them.

1365
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:21,617
And the strange thing is,
it does kind of make sense

1366
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:24,376
given that so much of acting
is like spying.

1367
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:25,821
Do you have any idea
how this sounds?

1368
01:07:25,845 --> 01:07:28,079
'Cause I mean, it's not...
It's not good.

1369
01:07:28,113 --> 01:07:31,316
Okay, I need an hour
to do one final thing for them

1370
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:32,818
and when I get back,

1371
01:07:32,852 --> 01:07:36,187
the three of us will fly to
Los Angeles together, okay?

1372
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:38,156
I don't know what to say.

1373
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:40,826
Don't say anything. Just take
Addy back to my room.

1374
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,795
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't go anywhere.

1375
01:07:42,828 --> 01:07:44,664
I'll be back to get you.
I promise.

1376
01:07:44,697 --> 01:07:45,698
I love you.

1377
01:07:58,844 --> 01:08:01,479
Your friend, Nicolas Cage,

1378
01:08:01,514 --> 01:08:03,381
the fucking star of Hollywood

1379
01:08:03,415 --> 01:08:05,551
is working
for the U.S. government.

1380
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:23,869
Oh, bullshit!

1381
01:08:23,903 --> 01:08:25,270
Bullshit!

1382
01:08:25,303 --> 01:08:26,539
Bullshit!

1383
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:30,543
Bullshit!

1384
01:08:30,576 --> 01:08:31,677
Listen.

1385
01:08:34,747 --> 01:08:36,314
<i>I see myself doing more</i>

1386
01:08:36,348 --> 01:08:37,593
<i>of this stuff.
You know, spycraft.</i>

1387
01:08:37,617 --> 01:08:39,819
<i>Subterfuge. What have you.</i>

1388
01:08:39,852 --> 01:08:41,721
<i>I think I might have
a real gift for it.</i>

1389
01:08:41,754 --> 01:08:43,823
<i>Good, 'cause we got
another mission for you.</i>

1390
01:08:51,597 --> 01:08:52,832
No.

1391
01:08:52,865 --> 01:08:54,332
Lucas, no.

1392
01:09:02,975 --> 01:09:04,175
Lucas.

1393
01:09:17,857 --> 01:09:19,892
No! No, no, no!

1394
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,706
I would love
to believe you, <i>primo.</i>

1395
01:09:34,907 --> 01:09:37,643
But either I kill you,

1396
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:40,846
or you kill Nicolas Cage.

1397
01:09:46,786 --> 01:09:48,186
Your choice.

1398
01:10:57,523 --> 01:10:58,524
Hi.

1399
01:10:59,491 --> 01:11:00,760
Hey.

1400
01:11:00,793 --> 01:11:03,562
I'm sorry.

1401
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:06,464
I should have asked you
before bringing them down.

1402
01:11:07,365 --> 01:11:08,901
Yeah.

1403
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:10,870
And I was thinking

1404
01:11:10,903 --> 01:11:13,639
maybe a kidnapping would work.

1405
01:11:13,672 --> 01:11:16,542
Our movie would start out
as a beautiful character piece

1406
01:11:16,575 --> 01:11:18,878
and then, slowly change
into a more thrilling...

1407
01:11:18,911 --> 01:11:21,046
Hollywood blockbuster.

1408
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:24,650
Then there's something
for everyone.

1409
01:11:24,683 --> 01:11:26,752
Would you like to drive out
to the cliffs?

1410
01:11:29,054 --> 01:11:31,791
Clear our heads, and think
through the third act?

1411
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:35,060
Perfect.

1412
01:11:54,046 --> 01:11:55,047
So...

1413
01:11:57,817 --> 01:11:58,851
We should go.

1414
01:11:59,718 --> 01:12:00,786
Yeah.

1415
01:12:08,627 --> 01:12:09,829
Are those new shoes?

1416
01:12:09,862 --> 01:12:10,896
These?

1417
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,765
No, I've had these.

1418
01:12:12,798 --> 01:12:14,567
Oh.

1419
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,001
I haven't seen them before.

1420
01:12:16,035 --> 01:12:17,435
I don't wear them very much.

1421
01:12:17,468 --> 01:12:18,708
I don't think they're really me.

1422
01:12:18,737 --> 01:12:19,972
What?

1423
01:12:20,005 --> 01:12:22,107
They're great.
They look incredible on you.

1424
01:12:22,141 --> 01:12:24,577
They're totally you.
Love 'em.

1425
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:25,945
Do you wanna try them on?

1426
01:12:25,978 --> 01:12:27,513
I think they would look
amazing on you.

1427
01:12:30,115 --> 01:12:31,116
Oh, wow!

1428
01:12:33,185 --> 01:12:34,854
Those look incredible on you.

1429
01:12:34,887 --> 01:12:36,822
I like how those look on you.
Yeah.

1430
01:12:39,825 --> 01:12:41,392
You wanna trade?

1431
01:12:41,426 --> 01:12:42,427
Like, permanently?

1432
01:12:44,462 --> 01:12:45,463
Okay.

1433
01:12:55,908 --> 01:12:57,109
Cool.

1434
01:13:01,547 --> 01:13:04,516
I'm really glad
I got to meet you.

1435
01:13:05,784 --> 01:13:07,820
You're the kind of friend
I could

1436
01:13:09,622 --> 01:13:13,025
not see for years,
and not even really talk to

1437
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:15,426
and just pick up
right where we left off.

1438
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,695
I totally agree.

1439
01:13:17,596 --> 01:13:19,164
It's just...

1440
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:20,499
Easy.

1441
01:13:33,145 --> 01:13:34,146
Well...

1442
01:13:37,516 --> 01:13:38,817
I guess it's time to figure out

1443
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:40,119
how this thing ends.

1444
01:13:56,869 --> 01:13:58,871
Nick...

1445
01:13:58,904 --> 01:14:00,873
I meant what I said back there.

1446
01:14:01,807 --> 01:14:02,908
Me, too.

1447
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:06,078
Which is why this really hurts.

1448
01:14:08,113 --> 01:14:09,782
Javi.

1449
01:14:09,815 --> 01:14:12,017
You brought me out here
to kill me, man?

1450
01:14:12,051 --> 01:14:13,118
I'm sorry, Nick.

1451
01:14:13,152 --> 01:14:14,687
So am I.

1452
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,722
'Cause you pull that trigger
and we're both dead.

1453
01:14:16,755 --> 01:14:19,825
Wait.
You were gonna kill me?

1454
01:14:19,858 --> 01:14:21,660
And are those my golden guns?

1455
01:14:21,694 --> 01:14:24,263
They're my golden guns.

1456
01:14:24,296 --> 01:14:26,508
And it looks like we both had
a little secret, doesn't it?

1457
01:14:26,532 --> 01:14:27,933
Why the fuck would you kill me?

1458
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,768
You're the head
of a criminal organization.

1459
01:14:29,802 --> 01:14:32,705
My cousin Lucas is the head
of the organization.

1460
01:14:32,738 --> 01:14:34,673
CIA said you ran it.

1461
01:14:34,707 --> 01:14:36,942
The whole world thinks I run it.

1462
01:14:36,976 --> 01:14:39,545
When my father died,
Lucas took over.

1463
01:14:39,578 --> 01:14:41,180
He forced me
to be the figurehead.

1464
01:14:41,213 --> 01:14:42,581
You take his money.

1465
01:14:42,614 --> 01:14:44,850
You don't just leave
this world, Nick.

1466
01:14:44,883 --> 01:14:47,853
You and everyone you care
about is in constant danger.

1467
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:49,655
Why do you think
I cannot be with Gabriela?

1468
01:14:50,823 --> 01:14:52,591
You... You're into Gabriela?

1469
01:14:52,624 --> 01:14:53,926
Are you fucking kidding me?

1470
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:55,561
I can't be with Gabriella,

1471
01:14:55,594 --> 01:14:56,838
because that would
put a target on her back.

1472
01:14:56,862 --> 01:14:57,830
Wait, you seriously
didn't realize

1473
01:14:57,863 --> 01:14:58,797
that we liked each other?

1474
01:14:58,831 --> 01:14:59,999
You're in the CIA!

1475
01:15:00,032 --> 01:15:01,300
I'm not in the CIA.

1476
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:04,737
I'm a goddamn actor.
You know that.

1477
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,171
The only organization
I'm a part of

1478
01:15:06,205 --> 01:15:08,674
is the Screen Actors Guild
of America.

1479
01:15:08,707 --> 01:15:10,218
And AFTRA. But I don't
even know what that is.

1480
01:15:10,242 --> 01:15:12,187
I think it's a radio thing.
Just put down the gun.

1481
01:15:12,211 --> 01:15:14,079
No way. You go first.

1482
01:15:14,113 --> 01:15:15,690
I'm not going first. You
brought my family out here.

1483
01:15:15,714 --> 01:15:17,325
This is so fucked!
I don't wanna kill you.

1484
01:15:17,349 --> 01:15:18,851
You're the last person
I wanna kill.

1485
01:15:18,884 --> 01:15:20,853
I fucking love you!
I love you!

1486
01:15:26,692 --> 01:15:27,993
It's my cousin.

1487
01:15:28,027 --> 01:15:29,137
He must have known
I wouldn't kill you.

1488
01:15:29,161 --> 01:15:30,596
I thought so.

1489
01:15:30,629 --> 01:15:31,997
Which is why
I should always trust

1490
01:15:32,031 --> 01:15:34,033
my shamanic instincts
as a thespian.

1491
01:15:35,601 --> 01:15:37,736
Fuck!

1492
01:15:44,109 --> 01:15:46,211
- Faster!
- I'm trying.

1493
01:15:46,245 --> 01:15:48,147
Your shoes don't offer
any ankle support.

1494
01:15:53,685 --> 01:15:55,187
Ah, fuck!

1495
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,594
Okay. You just run out there.
You get the truck.

1496
01:16:02,628 --> 01:16:04,305
You come back and get me.
I will keep a lookout.

1497
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:07,266
Uh-huh. Love it.
Love the plan.

1498
01:16:07,299 --> 01:16:09,034
But given that you've saddled me

1499
01:16:09,068 --> 01:16:11,336
with what basically amounts
to fucking penny loafers

1500
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:13,205
maybe you should go,
and I'll stay here.

1501
01:16:13,238 --> 01:16:14,940
I love that plan, I do.

1502
01:16:14,973 --> 01:16:17,042
But you are a faster runner
than me,

1503
01:16:17,076 --> 01:16:18,744
even with subpar footwear.

1504
01:16:18,777 --> 01:16:20,155
I saw how fast you were
in <i>National Treasure.</i>

1505
01:16:20,179 --> 01:16:21,947
No, that'd be
the stunt department.

1506
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,949
Not according to
the <i>Making Of</i> featurette.

1507
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:27,753
Fine, I'll go.
Wait!

1508
01:16:27,786 --> 01:16:29,688
So, you're gonna go?
I'm going with you.

1509
01:16:39,031 --> 01:16:40,032
There they are!

1510
01:16:53,078 --> 01:16:54,346
Ah, shit!

1511
01:16:57,916 --> 01:16:59,184
He's coming up on us.

1512
01:17:03,755 --> 01:17:04,990
On your left! On your left!

1513
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,695
Holy shit!

1514
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:15,400
Hit the brakes!
What?

1515
01:17:15,434 --> 01:17:17,045
Hit the brakes. He will hit
the back of the truck.

1516
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:18,279
That won't work.
Yes, it will. Yes, it will.

1517
01:17:18,303 --> 01:17:19,771
Just do it.
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1518
01:17:24,176 --> 01:17:25,911
Don't worry,
he's totally passed out.

1519
01:17:27,112 --> 01:17:28,814
Fuck!

1520
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:34,720
I'm okay.
Are you okay?

1521
01:17:47,299 --> 01:17:48,800
Liv.

1522
01:17:48,834 --> 01:17:50,274
They took Addy, Nick.
They took Addy?

1523
01:17:50,302 --> 01:17:51,913
She went outside to find you
and they just grabbed her.

1524
01:17:51,937 --> 01:17:53,805
There are more soldiers
coming. We have to go.

1525
01:17:54,306 --> 01:17:55,307
Fuck!

1526
01:18:01,446 --> 01:18:03,282
Vivian? Hello.

1527
01:18:03,315 --> 01:18:04,116
<i>Nick, I've sent you the address.</i>

1528
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:05,217
<i>You on the way?</i>

1529
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,119
What? They have my daughter.

1530
01:18:07,152 --> 01:18:08,453
What do they want with her?

1531
01:18:08,487 --> 01:18:09,988
<i>Unfortunately, she's being used</i>

1532
01:18:10,022 --> 01:18:11,790
<i>to put pressure
on the U.S. government</i>

1533
01:18:11,823 --> 01:18:13,401
<i>so they'll back off
their support of Delgado.</i>

1534
01:18:13,425 --> 01:18:16,228
<i>And unless Delgado
drops out of the election...</i>

1535
01:18:16,261 --> 01:18:17,863
<i>Nick, I'm sorry,</i>

1536
01:18:17,896 --> 01:18:20,065
<i>but they said
they're gonna kill both girls.</i>

1537
01:18:21,066 --> 01:18:22,401
What? What? What?

1538
01:18:22,434 --> 01:18:24,036
You're gonna get him
to drop out, right?

1539
01:18:24,069 --> 01:18:25,505
You're gonna get him
to drop out!

1540
01:18:25,538 --> 01:18:28,006
Just come directly here.

1541
01:19:24,329 --> 01:19:25,831
Oh, fucking...

1542
01:19:29,334 --> 01:19:30,869
His people
could still be in the area.

1543
01:19:30,902 --> 01:19:32,371
We have to go.
Where?

1544
01:19:32,404 --> 01:19:34,206
I have a place.
Let's go.

1545
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,599
- Let's go.
- Come, come. Come now.

1546
01:19:38,944 --> 01:19:40,580
So, what's the plan here?

1547
01:19:40,613 --> 01:19:44,316
You gonna be a big hero?
Save Addy yourself?

1548
01:19:44,349 --> 01:19:46,485
You'll end up dead like her.

1549
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:49,187
Leave it to the professionals.

1550
01:19:49,221 --> 01:19:51,023
Local police. Whomever.

1551
01:19:51,056 --> 01:19:52,457
There is no one else.

1552
01:19:55,961 --> 01:19:57,296
I love you.

1553
01:19:57,329 --> 01:19:59,331
And I have always
looked out for you.

1554
01:19:59,364 --> 01:20:01,166
Get off of me!

1555
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:02,568
I have to go in there.

1556
01:20:02,602 --> 01:20:05,103
Because Addy has to know
I fought for her.

1557
01:20:07,306 --> 01:20:10,042
I'm trying to help you,
and you won't listen!

1558
01:20:10,075 --> 01:20:11,843
How are you helping me, huh?

1559
01:20:11,877 --> 01:20:13,312
How are you ever helping me?

1560
01:20:15,247 --> 01:20:17,617
You need to know
who you are, Nick.

1561
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:19,151
This isn't a role.

1562
01:20:19,184 --> 01:20:21,019
You're not a hero.

1563
01:20:21,053 --> 01:20:22,430
<i>You're just some guy
who's about to get us killed.</i>

1564
01:20:22,454 --> 01:20:24,156
<i>You fucking idiot!</i>

1565
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:39,371
I bought this house 20 years ago

1566
01:20:39,404 --> 01:20:41,607
for a situation just like this.

1567
01:20:41,641 --> 01:20:44,042
It has everything we need.
Food, passports,

1568
01:20:44,076 --> 01:20:45,578
materials for disguise.

1569
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:48,046
We'll be safe for the night.

1570
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,619
Olivia,

1571
01:20:53,653 --> 01:20:55,454
I promise you will get
your daughter back.

1572
01:21:06,998 --> 01:21:08,333
The girls are likely being held

1573
01:21:08,367 --> 01:21:09,968
in my cousin's compound.

1574
01:21:10,001 --> 01:21:12,037
It is a monastery
that they use as a cover,

1575
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:13,573
but it is a fortress.

1576
01:21:13,606 --> 01:21:15,608
It is impenetrable.
There are walls on every side.

1577
01:21:15,641 --> 01:21:16,975
Any escape routes?

1578
01:21:17,008 --> 01:21:18,910
Tunnels.
But with metal doors

1579
01:21:18,944 --> 01:21:20,513
that only open from the inside.

1580
01:21:20,546 --> 01:21:22,023
Even if it weren't
for all of the armed guards,

1581
01:21:22,047 --> 01:21:23,982
it is impossible to get in.

1582
01:21:24,015 --> 01:21:26,385
I mean, this psychopath
is gonna kill our daughter

1583
01:21:26,418 --> 01:21:27,553
in 12 hours.

1584
01:21:27,587 --> 01:21:29,522
So, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

1585
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:41,099
We are going to walk straight
in through the front gate.

1586
01:21:43,636 --> 01:21:46,071
Okay, cool.
Very dramatic answer.

1587
01:21:46,104 --> 01:21:48,240
How's that supposed to work?

1588
01:21:48,273 --> 01:21:49,350
Lucas is trying
to form an alliance

1589
01:21:49,374 --> 01:21:50,676
with Sergio Baldassari,

1590
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:52,545
the head
of the Calabero crime family.

1591
01:21:52,578 --> 01:21:55,615
Baldassari, I mean, no one
has seen him for 15 years.

1592
01:21:55,648 --> 01:21:59,484
Exactly.
And since no one has seen him

1593
01:21:59,519 --> 01:22:02,254
no one knows exactly
what he looks like.

1594
01:22:02,287 --> 01:22:03,589
Olivia.

1595
01:22:03,623 --> 01:22:04,666
Nick says
that you were an incredible

1596
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:06,358
makeup artist when you met.

1597
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:09,394
So, with some prosthetics
and a little makeup...

1598
01:22:09,428 --> 01:22:11,363
Then I could play Sergio.

1599
01:22:26,746 --> 01:22:28,313
Lucas Gutierrez!

1600
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:34,754
I'd like to
introduce my wife Barbara.

1601
01:22:34,787 --> 01:22:38,390
Why for? She was born
in Santa Barbara, California.

1602
01:22:41,694 --> 01:22:44,630
You think I'm fucking stupid,
Sergio, hmm?

1603
01:22:44,664 --> 01:22:47,232
You think you're just gonna
walk in here after 15 years

1604
01:22:47,265 --> 01:22:48,701
and kill me,

1605
01:22:48,734 --> 01:22:50,368
you motherfucker, hmm?

1606
01:22:50,402 --> 01:22:51,580
He's cutting my fucking ear off!

1607
01:22:51,604 --> 01:22:53,405
Who are you working for?
Three seconds.

1608
01:22:53,438 --> 01:22:55,207
It's just me!
Two!

1609
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,274
I promise!

1610
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:03,148
You think she can help you,
Sergio, hmm?

1611
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,552
Go ahead.

1612
01:23:06,586 --> 01:23:09,287
You kill him,
I'll still make the deal.

1613
01:23:09,321 --> 01:23:11,022
But I don't think
you're gonna kill him.

1614
01:23:12,725 --> 01:23:14,527
You don't think I'll kill him?

1615
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,037
No, I think
if you were gonna kill him,

1616
01:23:16,061 --> 01:23:17,597
you would have done it by now.

1617
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:19,331
So, no,
I don't think you'll do it.

1618
01:23:21,534 --> 01:23:23,736
Although, I am wondering

1619
01:23:23,769 --> 01:23:26,371
why the fuck you think
you can intimidate me?

1620
01:23:29,207 --> 01:23:31,109
Okay, Barbara
from Santa Barbara.

1621
01:23:31,142 --> 01:23:32,210
Okay, Barbara.

1622
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:35,748
It is good to see you, Sergio.

1623
01:23:35,781 --> 01:23:37,282
Been far too long.

1624
01:23:37,315 --> 01:23:38,551
You okay?

1625
01:23:38,584 --> 01:23:40,653
My people will show you
to a room.

1626
01:23:40,686 --> 01:23:44,155
Freshen up,
and then, we'll talk.

1627
01:23:44,189 --> 01:23:47,593
God, how does my ear look?
He almost cut off my ear.

1628
01:23:47,627 --> 01:23:49,170
Shit! We've only got
about 15 minutes, Nick.

1629
01:23:49,194 --> 01:23:50,563
We've gotta go find Addy.

1630
01:23:50,596 --> 01:23:52,364
I know. I know.
According to Javi's map,

1631
01:23:52,397 --> 01:23:53,799
they're probably holding her

1632
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,513
in the basement
of the building right here.

1633
01:24:05,243 --> 01:24:06,244
You ready?

1634
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:24,229
What do we do?

1635
01:24:30,468 --> 01:24:31,469
Oh, good one.

1636
01:24:36,308 --> 01:24:37,309
Get his gun.

1637
01:24:40,646 --> 01:24:42,347
Drop the gun, Sergio.

1638
01:24:46,519 --> 01:24:48,453
Neither of you
are supposed to be here.

1639
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:50,488
Come with me.

1640
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:58,731
Lucas.

1641
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,874
A gun?

1642
01:25:08,908 --> 01:25:10,342
Okay, Sergio.

1643
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:12,277
What's the deal, my man?

1644
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:13,713
You got a fucking problem

1645
01:25:13,746 --> 01:25:15,915
you'd like to
tell me about or...

1646
01:25:15,948 --> 01:25:18,584
I was beginning to think
you don't have the girl

1647
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:22,722
and since our deal was based
on Delgado dropping out...

1648
01:25:22,755 --> 01:25:24,155
- He'll drop out.
- Fuck.

1649
01:25:24,189 --> 01:25:25,490
But he hasn't done it yet.

1650
01:25:25,524 --> 01:25:27,225
Lucas.

1651
01:25:33,699 --> 01:25:35,166
- Lucas!
- Now!

1652
01:25:36,802 --> 01:25:37,803
Okay.

1653
01:25:40,973 --> 01:25:42,775
You know,

1654
01:25:42,808 --> 01:25:47,178
if you and I are gonna be
in business together, Sergio,

1655
01:25:47,212 --> 01:25:48,881
you're gonna need to trust me.

1656
01:25:49,515 --> 01:25:50,516
Hmm?

1657
01:25:55,988 --> 01:25:57,288
What the fuck?

1658
01:25:57,322 --> 01:25:58,456
What the fuck, what?

1659
01:25:58,490 --> 01:25:59,625
Oh, shit.

1660
01:25:59,659 --> 01:26:01,627
Your face...

1661
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:04,229
Oh, shit! I'll blow his
fucking head off, man!

1662
01:26:04,262 --> 01:26:06,632
Don't fucking move!

1663
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:07,967
Olivia, take the girls and go.

1664
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,467
What's the plan here, Nick?

1665
01:26:09,502 --> 01:26:11,871
You get the girls
out of here alive!

1666
01:26:11,904 --> 01:26:13,873
No, we can't just
leave him here.

1667
01:26:13,906 --> 01:26:15,373
Addy, go with your mom!

1668
01:26:15,407 --> 01:26:16,441
Hey! Just go. Go!

1669
01:26:16,474 --> 01:26:17,910
Come on.

1670
01:26:17,943 --> 01:26:19,879
Just run, Addy.

1671
01:26:21,379 --> 01:26:23,448
You like that? Huh?

1672
01:26:23,481 --> 01:26:24,984
Oh, my God.
Nick fucking Cage.

1673
01:26:25,017 --> 01:26:26,852
Nick motherfucking Cage!

1674
01:26:26,886 --> 01:26:28,721
Don't even think about it!

1675
01:26:32,323 --> 01:26:33,626
Okay, this way.
Come on.

1676
01:26:35,293 --> 01:26:36,294
Come on.

1677
01:26:38,964 --> 01:26:40,533
Now, go!

1678
01:26:40,566 --> 01:26:41,834
Wait!

1679
01:26:41,867 --> 01:26:42,902
Where's Nick?

1680
01:26:42,935 --> 01:26:44,970
He's got a gun on Lucas.

1681
01:26:45,004 --> 01:26:46,839
He bought us some time,
but there's others.

1682
01:26:46,872 --> 01:26:48,908
He will never make it
out of there alive.

1683
01:26:53,813 --> 01:26:55,881
Here's what I know, Nick Cage.

1684
01:26:55,915 --> 01:27:00,786
I've got four guys with guns
pointed directly at your head.

1685
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:04,355
Yeah, that's true.
But here's what I know.

1686
01:27:04,389 --> 01:27:05,958
My family's safe.

1687
01:27:05,991 --> 01:27:07,193
And that's all that matters.

1688
01:27:10,796 --> 01:27:12,497
Hey!

1689
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:13,966
There he is.

1690
01:27:13,999 --> 01:27:15,735
There he fucking is!

1691
01:27:15,768 --> 01:27:17,503
The American hero.

1692
01:27:17,903 --> 01:27:19,404
Oh!

1693
01:27:19,437 --> 01:27:22,474
The fucking star
of Hollywood, eh?

1694
01:27:22,508 --> 01:27:26,045
Ooh, whoa. Come on.
What is this?

1695
01:27:26,078 --> 01:27:28,647
And this nose, yeah?

1696
01:27:28,681 --> 01:27:29,982
Don't fucking move!

1697
01:27:30,015 --> 01:27:32,383
Jesus Christ!
This fucking guy again.

1698
01:27:32,417 --> 01:27:33,451
Carlos.

1699
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,056
Carlos, please.
You don't wanna do this to me.

1700
01:27:37,089 --> 01:27:38,758
You don't wanna do this to Javi.

1701
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:41,560
He's been nothing
but good to you.

1702
01:27:41,594 --> 01:27:42,728
Javi is about to die.

1703
01:27:43,495 --> 01:27:45,463
As are you.

1704
01:27:45,497 --> 01:27:46,966
Shit!

1705
01:27:46,999 --> 01:27:49,535
Anything you'd like to say
before you die?

1706
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,405
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain

1707
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:55,708
"to send a message to the body.

1708
01:27:55,741 --> 01:27:57,743
"So, by the time
your bullets hit me,

1709
01:27:57,777 --> 01:28:00,679
"my cerebral cortex
will be transmittin' a signal

1710
01:28:00,713 --> 01:28:02,581
"to the 17 healthy muscles

1711
01:28:02,615 --> 01:28:05,551
"that operate my trigger finger.

1712
01:28:05,584 --> 01:28:08,888
"And before your asshole
has a chance to pucker up,

1713
01:28:08,921 --> 01:28:11,356
"your medulla oblongata
will be splattered

1714
01:28:11,389 --> 01:28:14,492
"all over the fucking wall

1715
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:16,962
"And if that's the last thing
I accomplish

1716
01:28:16,996 --> 01:28:18,931

1717
01:28:18,964 --> 01:28:21,901
"well, then, ha, I say, ha..."

1718
01:28:21,934 --> 01:28:24,503
"what a way to fucking go."

1719
01:28:27,573 --> 01:28:28,641
Hey!

1720
01:28:31,577 --> 01:28:33,579
Shit, come on!
Nick, go! Go!

1721
01:28:39,084 --> 01:28:40,451
Did we kill him?

1722
01:28:45,624 --> 01:28:47,358
Shit!

1723
01:28:47,392 --> 01:28:49,628
You're dead.

1724
01:28:49,662 --> 01:28:50,996
All of you!

1725
01:29:00,506 --> 01:29:01,941
Nicolas Cage?

1726
01:29:04,577 --> 01:29:06,579
That's fucking cool.

1727
01:29:11,449 --> 01:29:13,085
Addy... Addy, did he...
Did he hurt you?

1728
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:14,720
Better not have.
No.

1729
01:29:14,753 --> 01:29:16,155
Are you hungry?
No.

1730
01:29:16,188 --> 01:29:18,824
Javi has apples. You want a McIntosh?
Honeycrisp?

1731
01:29:18,858 --> 01:29:20,425
No apples, Nick.

1732
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:21,426
Dad, just please,
watch the road. Please!

1733
01:29:21,459 --> 01:29:22,728
Oh, shit!

1734
01:29:28,634 --> 01:29:29,969
Oh, shit!

1735
01:29:31,003 --> 01:29:32,004
Oh.

1736
01:29:37,977 --> 01:29:39,788
Olivia, hand me the guns.
They're right in there.

1737
01:29:39,812 --> 01:29:41,046
What are you doing?

1738
01:29:41,747 --> 01:29:43,148
No.

1739
01:29:43,182 --> 01:29:44,458
Okay, stop the truck.
I will slow them down.

1740
01:29:44,482 --> 01:29:45,818
- No way!
- Yes.

1741
01:29:45,851 --> 01:29:47,485
You are two kilometers
from the embassy.

1742
01:29:47,519 --> 01:29:48,663
If I slow them down,
then you will all make it.

1743
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:49,731
- Javi, I can get us there.
- No!

1744
01:29:49,755 --> 01:29:50,915
Just stay in the truck! Javs!

1745
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:55,794
No!

1746
01:29:55,828 --> 01:29:57,495
Just get in the car, Javi!

1747
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:02,635
I'm never gonna have
any kind of a life

1748
01:30:02,668 --> 01:30:04,837
unless I stand up to my cousin!

1749
01:30:06,739 --> 01:30:07,806
I need this.

1750
01:30:08,974 --> 01:30:10,042
Now, go.

1751
01:30:11,577 --> 01:30:12,578
Go!

1752
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,121
You stayed.

1753
01:30:22,855 --> 01:30:23,989
Of course.

1754
01:31:01,226 --> 01:31:03,595
Don't worry, Addy.
Everyone's gonna be okay.

1755
01:31:03,629 --> 01:31:05,064
How's Maria doing?
She's okay.

1756
01:31:05,097 --> 01:31:06,265
Dad, please go faster.

1757
01:31:06,298 --> 01:31:07,499
Yeah. Take this left here.

1758
01:31:23,615 --> 01:31:24,783
Shit!

1759
01:31:31,991 --> 01:31:34,126
- Hold on.
- Oh!

1760
01:31:36,862 --> 01:31:38,664
Oh!

1761
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:51,577
Did we lose 'em?
I think we lost 'em.

1762
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:53,178
- Dad, watch out!
- Oh!

1763
01:31:59,218 --> 01:32:01,520
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

1764
01:32:23,776 --> 01:32:26,045
I'm gonna kill you,
Nick fucking Cage!

1765
01:32:28,881 --> 01:32:30,616
Get down!
Everybody get down!

1766
01:32:35,087 --> 01:32:36,121
Hold on!

1767
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:54,807
What just happened?

1768
01:32:55,707 --> 01:32:57,142
Addy?

1769
01:32:57,176 --> 01:32:58,343
Come out!
Gun!

1770
01:32:58,377 --> 01:32:59,611
Come on!

1771
01:33:04,116 --> 01:33:05,717
Don't you move!

1772
01:33:07,786 --> 01:33:11,123
Get back!
Get back!

1773
01:33:11,156 --> 01:33:12,624
Come near me
and I'm gonna kill him.

1774
01:33:12,658 --> 01:33:13,859
Addy?

1775
01:33:16,028 --> 01:33:17,096
Dad!

1776
01:33:29,808 --> 01:33:31,243
We made it, Nick.

1777
01:33:34,813 --> 01:33:36,081
We made it.

1778
01:33:37,816 --> 01:33:38,951
All of us.

1779
01:33:42,121 --> 01:33:43,922
I love you, Daddy.

1780
01:34:35,307 --> 01:34:37,442
"I love you, Daddy"?

1781
01:34:37,476 --> 01:34:39,111
Javi wrote that.
Okay.

1782
01:34:39,912 --> 01:34:41,480
Congratulations.

1783
01:34:41,514 --> 01:34:42,848
Thanks, Olivia.

1784
01:34:46,418 --> 01:34:47,452
We're back.

1785
01:34:47,486 --> 01:34:49,087
Not that we went anywhere.

1786
01:34:49,121 --> 01:34:50,389
Not that we went anywhere.

1787
01:35:01,501 --> 01:35:03,101
Thanks.
Oh, thanks.

1788
01:35:06,371 --> 01:35:08,040
Nick.

1789
01:35:08,073 --> 01:35:09,474
Javi, I've been looking for you.

1790
01:35:09,509 --> 01:35:11,043
I was wondering where you went.

1791
01:35:11,076 --> 01:35:13,312
Oh, no, I couldn't watch.
I was, uh...

1792
01:35:13,345 --> 01:35:15,214
I was too nervous.

1793
01:35:15,247 --> 01:35:16,415
How did it play?

1794
01:35:16,448 --> 01:35:19,017
They loved it.
Congratulations.

1795
01:35:19,051 --> 01:35:20,385
Really?
Yeah.

1796
01:35:20,419 --> 01:35:21,920
Oh, wow!

1797
01:35:22,988 --> 01:35:24,323
This is...

1798
01:35:24,356 --> 01:35:25,357
Nick...

1799
01:35:26,225 --> 01:35:27,527
Thank you.

1800
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,962
Javi, we did this together.
Thank you.

1801
01:35:29,995 --> 01:35:31,997
Do you wanna ride to the party
with me?

1802
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:34,900
They want to interview us.
Uh, <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

1803
01:35:37,869 --> 01:35:39,972
Yeah, no, I can't tonight.
But you go.

1804
01:35:40,005 --> 01:35:42,374
Have fun. Enjoy this.

1805
01:35:42,407 --> 01:35:44,243
And give Gabriela my love.

1806
01:35:49,848 --> 01:35:51,517
Addy wants to borrow your belt.

1807
01:35:51,551 --> 01:35:53,018
Oh, yeah, I do.

1808
01:35:53,051 --> 01:35:55,053
It looks like
it's got some weight.

1809
01:35:55,087 --> 01:35:57,389
Well, yeah,
it's a big, fat tarantula.

1810
01:35:57,422 --> 01:35:59,057
You know my dresser, Jeff.

1811
01:35:59,091 --> 01:36:00,259
Mr. Neiman Marcus?
Yes.

1812
01:36:00,292 --> 01:36:01,927
He wanted me to wear a bee.

1813
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,829
And I said, "Jeff,
not the bees. Not the bees"

1814
01:36:03,862 --> 01:36:05,373
So, he said, "Well, how about
a scorpion?" I said,

1815
01:36:05,397 --> 01:36:06,908
"I think a scorpion
is a little aggressive, Jeff."

1816
01:36:06,932 --> 01:36:08,066
"What about a tarantula?"

1817
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,368
He goes, "Well, I don't think"

1818
01:36:09,401 --> 01:36:10,579
"that's any
less aggressive, Nick."

1819
01:36:10,603 --> 01:36:11,837
And I say,
"Well, it is to me."

1820
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:12,914
They're cute and fuzzy, right?

1821
01:36:12,938 --> 01:36:14,048
Well, Addy wants to borrow it.

1822
01:36:14,072 --> 01:36:15,575
Not at all.

1823
01:36:15,608 --> 01:36:17,342
You can have it.
It's yours.

1824
01:36:17,376 --> 01:36:19,878
Are you sure you didn't need
to stay at the premiere?

1825
01:36:19,911 --> 01:36:21,980
Hundred percent.
Yeah?

1826
01:36:22,014 --> 01:36:23,157
Who chose Demi Moore
to play Mom?

1827
01:36:23,181 --> 01:36:24,950
Studio.

1828
01:36:24,983 --> 01:36:27,219
But it doesn't really do your
mother justice, does it?

1829
01:36:27,252 --> 01:36:28,420
Oh, come on.

1830
01:36:28,453 --> 01:36:29,555
She's gorgeous.

1831
01:36:29,589 --> 01:36:30,956
So are you, Olivia.

1832
01:36:30,989 --> 01:36:33,225
Ew, Dad, stop hitting on Mom.

1833
01:36:33,258 --> 01:36:34,926
I'm not hitting on her.

1834
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,362
Oh, gross. I don't wanna
listen to this anymore.

1835
01:36:37,396 --> 01:36:39,431
You know what? What do you say
we watch a movie?

1836
01:36:39,464 --> 01:36:41,433
Yeah, whatever you want, Dad.

1837
01:36:41,466 --> 01:36:42,934
No, really. You choose.

1838
01:36:44,236 --> 01:36:45,470
Really?

1839
01:36:45,505 --> 01:36:47,507
Yeah, show us something
you like.

1840
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:49,141
This is...

1841
01:36:49,174 --> 01:36:51,343
Have you ever seen <i>Paddington 2?</i>

1842
01:37:37,623 --> 01:37:39,057
<i>You're Nick</i>

1843
01:37:39,091 --> 01:37:41,360
<i>fucking...</i>

1844
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,401
<i>Whoa! Cage!</i>
