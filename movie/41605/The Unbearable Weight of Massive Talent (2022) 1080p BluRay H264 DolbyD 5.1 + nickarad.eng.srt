1
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,429
I meant to get a haircut.

2
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:38,104
I got a present for ya', Casey.

3
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,481
<i>Casey, sweetie,</i>

4
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:48,835
<i>you take your
daddy's present now.</i>

5
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,654
Whoa.

6
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,762
<i>I got a picture of you, too.</i>

7
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:10,069
Maria!

8
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,406
No! No, no! No!

9
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,141
<i>Happy birthday, darlin'.</i>

10
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,421
No!

11
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,709
Whoa!

12
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,861
Thank you.

13
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,305
<i>Obviously, you've seen
Mankiewicz's</i> House of Strangers.

14
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,740
It's one of my all-time
favorite movies.

15
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,604
That's exactly what your
script reminded me of.

16
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,768
The power struggle,

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,502
the fight for
relevance. Yeah. Yeah.

18
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,212
And you're gonna think
this sounds a little crazy,

19
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:19,338
but in some ways,
it's <i>King Lear.</i>

20
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,608
It's <i>King Lear.</i> Yeah, exactly.

21
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,241
See, I knew you'd understand

22
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,419
what I'm trying
to do with this film.

23
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,912
Right.

24
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,447
David, I don't know
what to say exactly,

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,316
except this is the
role of a lifetime

26
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,718
and I'd really love
to be a part of this.

27
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,530
Cool, man. I'll just give you
a shout in a couple of days.

28
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,689
Oh. If you're worried
about the Boston accent,

29
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,223
I can do the Boston accent.

30
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,468
I've been working
on it all week.

31
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,894
I'm not worried, Nick.

32
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,471
Okay, well, if you have
any other questions

33
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,730
or you just wanna
talk, give me a call.

34
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,968
Or if you'd like me
to, uh... to read...

35
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,367
You don't need to read for me.

36
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,302
Of course not.

37
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,739
And obviously, I'm not going to.

38
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,608
Obviously.

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,350
But I bet a part of you would
love to hear me read, right?

40
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,475
I mean, why wouldn't you?

41
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,211
If I were you, I'd
want to hear it.

42
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,884
Seriously, I don't
want you to read. Okay.

43
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,649
Anyway, this is
me, so I'm gonna...

44
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,350
Well, you know
what? I'm gonna read.

45
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,687
"It's a foregone
conclusion, Jimmy."

46
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,990
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain"

47
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,824
"to send a message to the body."

48
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,661
"So, by the time your bullets
hit me, my cerebral cortex"

49
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,872
"will have transmitted a signal"

50
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,329
"to the 17 healthy muscles"

51
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,699
"that operate
my trigger finger."

52
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:22,002
"And before your asshole
has had a chance to pucker up,"

53
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,905
"your medulla oblongata"

54
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,873
"will be splattered on a
fucking wall behind ya."

55
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,776
"And if that's the last
thing I accomplish"

56
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,578
"on this beautiful green Earth,"

57
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,981
"well, then, ha, I say, ha,
what a way to fucking go."

58
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,252
Holy shit.

59
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,558
I can do another if you want.

60
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,432
Damn, man!

61
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,668
That was good, right? Felt good.

62
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,270
Mankiewicz?
Whoo-hoo! Incredible pull.

63
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,338
I know. It just
popped into my head.

64
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,307
Well, good. I'm happy for you.

65
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,412
Because, honestly,
man, you really need this.

66
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,379
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

67
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,884
You get it. This could
be a game changer.

68
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,929
I don't need a game changer.
If it happens, it happens.

69
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:13,697
If it doesn't, I'll just keep
working. That's what I do.

70
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,690
I'm just saying, you could
be a little more strategic.

71
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,492
Make more movie star choices.

72
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,459
It's like Miles Davis told me...

73
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:21,538
"Sometimes, it's the notes"

74
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,764
"you don't play."

75
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:24,331
Miles Davis was a heroin addict.

76
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:25,608
I mean, I love him,
he was a maestro,

77
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,033
but I'm happy,

78
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,478
I'm healthy when I'm
working. I'm an actor.

79
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,937
No, you're a fucking movie star!

80
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,403
And don't you ever forget that!

81
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,016
Okay, I don't need
this. I don't need this.

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,975
Get out of my car.
Nicky, get out of my car.

83
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,644
I don't need this.

84
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,353
I need this.

85
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,355
This could be a game changer.

86
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,067
So, you're not happy with
how your career is going

87
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,728
because you seem to
be working all the time.

88
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:57,430
Well, I never viewed it
as a career, only as work.

89
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,509
And what's wrong with that?

90
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,100
I mean, in any other job,

91
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,601
hard work is
something to behold,

92
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,004
but with film performance,

93
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,447
"You're making too
many movies, Nick."

94
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,807
"You're working too hard, Nick."

95
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,350
"Have the audience
miss you more, Nick."

96
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:08,608
I mean, "Hello, it's my job."

97
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:09,911
"I pay my bills."

98
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,612
"I feed my family.
You're annoying."

99
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:12,913
My gosh!

100
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,783
Yeah.

101
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,584
So, what's the worry here, Nick?

102
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,451
You've lost some
of your ability,

103
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,420
your talent as an actor?

104
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,591
No.

105
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,492
Uh...

106
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,394
No, it's just that
I really want this.

107
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,728
This is the role of a lifetime.

108
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,665
It's a great part.

109
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,567
Well, how do you think your
relationship with your work

110
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,970
affects your relationship
with your daughter?

111
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,004
Let's bring Addy
into this, shall we?

112
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,143
What? Oh, you
don't have to do that.

113
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,610
You guys can keep talking.

114
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:44,946
Well, I'll just finish with,

115
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,454
a role like this doesn't
come along every day.

116
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:47,648
And now, I'm gonna zip it.

117
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:48,792
- I zipped it good.
- Addy.

118
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,951
How do you think
your dad's anxiety

119
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,653
over his career
has affected you?

120
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,154
Well, his career is pretty much

121
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,723
the only thing we talk about.

122
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,591
That or he makes
me watch old movies,

123
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,159
and then discuss them.

124
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,728
Which is really just him
lecturing me for two hours.

125
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,497
It's a conversation. It's
more of a conversation.

126
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,466
He made me watch
this bizarre old movie.

127
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,137
What was it called? The
Island of Dr. Calamari?

128
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,139
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>
And did you like it, Addy?

129
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,475
It's one of my favorite
films. Have you seen it?

130
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,677
No, I have not.

131
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,146
It's about this
insane old doctor

132
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,415
who has a sleepwalker
completely under his spell.

133
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,785
This crazy old loon.

134
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,723
Can you imagine how
horrifying that would be?

135
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,932
To be completely
under someone's spell?

136
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,826
And you liked it, right?

137
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,637
I mean, you like the painted
sets, and the makeup...

138
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:34,928
No, I did not.

139
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,129
Sounds to me like

140
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,098
maybe she didn't
want to see the movie.

141
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,533
Did you think about that, Nick?

142
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,901
About what she wants?

143
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,870
Cheryl, come on. Is
that a real question?

144
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,038
What do you think
he's gonna say?

145
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,942
She has an amazing visual
sensibility. Always has.

146
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,620
We're very close, and
within that closeness,

147
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,545
I was able to ascertain...

148
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,185
Hey, honey. Hi, Mom.

149
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,521
Bye, Addy. I love you.

150
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,225
Oh, no, what happened?

151
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,226
Oh, she's mad at me
because we watched

152
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,762
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>
together and she hated it,

153
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,731
which I find odd, given how
mature her taste normally is.

154
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,533
Wait, you're surprised
your teenage daughter

155
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,735
didn't wanna watch an insane

156
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,605
100-year-old
German film with you?

157
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,673
Yes. Oh, my God. Okay.

158
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,042
Well, it's not just that.

159
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,519
You know, she's never
read Mary Shelley,

160
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,678
or Jane Austen, or even Twain.

161
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,814
What a little philistine.
Should we disown her?

162
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,951
She thought Humphrey
Bogart was a porn star.

163
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,252
Yeah...

164
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,788
What, really? Yeah.

165
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,990
That's disappointing.

166
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,591
Unless there is a porn star
called Humphrey Bogart.

167
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,860
That would work, wouldn't
it? Humphrey. Hump.

168
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,531
No?

169
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,031
Look, you're just...

170
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,933
You're at a tricky
stage right now

171
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,235
with her, okay?

172
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,704
And if you don't
learn to connect,

173
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:50,971
it's gonna stay broken for...

174
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,139
What the fuck are
you smiling at? Huh?

175
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,542
Why are you smiling? I'm not.

176
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,909
You are. Okay.

177
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:56,987
Olivia, I'm up for a
very exciting movie.

178
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,778
And I think it's gonna happen.

179
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,257
Oh, my God. Look, will
you do me a favor? Yes.

180
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,749
Turn up for her birthday party.

181
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,550
Of course. Of course.

182
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:04,918
Gosh!

183
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,088
Hey, Fink, let's meet up.
I have some questions.

184
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,956
I don't know. I just
really want this.

185
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,692
I mean, this is the role of a
lifetime, and as my agent...

186
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,028
Nick, I've got a
good feeling, okay?

187
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,863
Okay. Now, come on.

188
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,899
I know how tense you get.

189
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,101
This is going to help you relax.

190
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,069
Fuck!

191
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,139
Oh, my! Fuck, I
love this so much.

192
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,310
Is this supposed to
hurt this much? Fuck!

193
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,245
It is. The more pain the better.

194
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,846
Fuckin'...

195
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,316
Why? It's good for circulation.

196
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,826
So, Nick, we got another offer.

197
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,899
Just came in this morning.

198
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,763
Excellent. What's it about?

199
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:51,197
It's about a million bucks.

200
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,768
What is it?

201
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,201
A birthday party, Fink?

202
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,104
What are you even talking about?

203
00:08:57,138 --> 00:08:58,605
You go, and I don't know,

204
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,915
tell some stories,
make 'em laugh.

205
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,043
Make 'em laugh? Like...
Like a circus clown?

206
00:09:02,076 --> 00:09:03,576
A trained seal?

207
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,183
Nick, I got a call from your
business manager, Kenny.

208
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,328
You've been living at the
Sunset Tower for over a year.

209
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,855
And so? They love
having me there.

210
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:17,625
You owe them $600,000.

211
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,125
They sent the bills to Kenny.

212
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,761
I'll take care of it.

213
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,065
Kenny says you still
have substantial debts.

214
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,801
And now, the divorce,
and your spending habits

215
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,869
and, and, and...
Okay, I'm gonna deal

216
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,671
with all that, Fink.

217
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,972
You know I will.

218
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,109
But I'm gonna get this next role

219
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:38,144
and when I do,
all of that changes.

220
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,315
Then, I'm back.

221
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,618
And, by the way, not
that I went anywhere.

222
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,153
Not that you went anywhere.

223
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:47,620
You never shit on yourself.

224
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,323
Come on! Never shit on yourself.

225
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,740
Fink, hold on a second.
Let me get somewhere quiet.

226
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,376
Fink, you still there?
I can hear you now.

227
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,154
Did you talk to him?
<i>I talked to David.</i>

228
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,280
Oh, you're here. Great. Hold on.

229
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,883
Right, we're doing cake.

230
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,650
Uh... Oh, my
God, you're doing...

231
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:18,885
I have to finish this call.

232
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,788
Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

233
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:22,856
Come on!

234
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,658
Fink, did you talk to him?

235
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,961
<i>Nick, can you hear me?</i>

236
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,697
Yes, I can hear you.
What did he say?

237
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,365
<i>He said he loves you,</i>

238
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,868
<i>but he ultimately went
in a different direction</i>

239
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,369
<i>for the role.</i>

240
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,836
<i>Sorry, dude.</i>

241
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,692
I hate it.

242
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,830
Thank you, Mom.

243
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,836
Thank you.

244
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:14,008
Thank you.

245
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,010
Blow, blow. Make a wish.

246
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,216
Happy birthday, Addy!
All right, everybody!

247
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:26,086
Gather round the piano.
It's showtime, folks.

248
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,297
What's he doing?
- What?

249
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,923
Nick? Nick?

250
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:30,691
Uh, step away
from the piano, Nick.

251
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:33,226
Hi, Lewis.

252
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,261
You're all grown up now.

253
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:37,096
What, are you...
What, are you 15?

254
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,164
Dad, don't talk to Lewis.

255
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,767
Okay.

256
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,769
When she was nine years old,

257
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,038
my daughter and I took
our first trip together.

258
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,207
We drove overnight,

259
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,943
across the desert,
to the Grand Canyon.

260
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,278
You remember that, sweetheart?

261
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:52,947
I do remember that.

262
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,149
And when the sun came up,

263
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,784
I pulled over to
the side of the road

264
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,322
as she rested her little
head on my shoulder

265
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,123
and we just watched...

266
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,027
Watched the sun come up.

267
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,899
That was the happiest
moment of my life.

268
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,235
And in that moment,

269
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:17,337
I composed a little tune
for her 16th birthday.

270
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,807
I've been working
on it ever since.

271
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,077
And, uh, happy birthday,
sweetheart. Here goes.

272
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,231
Oh, fucking Jesus!

273
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,101
I'm so excited to see what
you do with your life, honey.

274
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,538
And I'll support
whatever you choose.

275
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:53,807
Only, I wouldn't
recommend a life in the arts.

276
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:56,844
Especially, with how real
talent goes unappreciated

277
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,513
in this shithole town.

278
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,158
I don't know, Olivia.

279
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,126
I don't know.

280
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,205
Do you remember
when the three of us

281
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,041
used to lie on the
living room floor

282
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,610
in the New York apartment,

283
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:31,345
and you and I would
watch her for hours on end?

284
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,879
Remember?

285
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,883
It was so much easier then.

286
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,017
Yeah.

287
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,894
Listen.

288
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,096
I'm gonna say something,
and I'm not sure I should.

289
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,397
Say it.

290
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,433
Okay.

291
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,967
I need you.

292
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,403
You need me?

293
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:59,940
I need you to get
your shit together, Nick.

294
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,176
Okay? She's not two
years old anymore.

295
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,245
She is a smart girl
who needs her dad.

296
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,346
She doesn't need...

297
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,283
She doesn't need this guy.

298
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,427
Yeah.

299
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,561
No, no. Come on.

<i>I am honestly sorry
for even bringing it up.</i>

304
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,322
I'll take it.

00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,591
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

306

It better be because

307
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,496
when it's over, I'm done.

308
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:33,200
Like hot dogs on a grill.

309
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,469

honor...

<i>was kidnapped on Monday.</i>

323
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,153
<i>The police have confirmed
that they have no information</i>

324
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,412
<i>as to her whereabouts.</i>

325
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,722
<i>They have asked
anyone with any...</i>

326
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,280
<i>What do you say</i>

327
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,283
<i>we cut the chitchat, a-hole?</i>

328
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,751
<i>You almost got me killed twice.</i>

329
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:26,754
Okay.

330
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,677
I'm in position.

331
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,379
<i>All right, as
soon as I have eyes</i>

332
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:53,691
<i>on Baldassari, you
move in and take him.</i>

333
00:16:53,715 --> 00:16:54,716
Copy that.

334
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,687
Wait, wait, wait.
It's not Baldassari.

335
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,422
What the fuck is
happening right now?

336
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:05,392
Martin, talk to me.
Who's on the plane?

337
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,428
I don't know if
I'm losing my goddamn mind,

338
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,330
but I'm pretty sure that's
the actor Nick Cage.

339
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,099
That motherfucker
from <i>Moonstruck?</i>

340
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,701
<i>Moonstruck?</i> No. From <i>Face/Off.</i>

341
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:16,503
Wait, wait, wait.

342
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:19,071
Why the fuck is Nick
Cage on this plane?

343
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,743
You know what?
We're pulling out.

344
00:17:22,777 --> 00:17:23,820
<i>I don't like this.
Get out of there.</i>

345
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:25,278
Martin.

346
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,580
<i>No, get out of there. Now.</i>

347
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:33,252
<i>Vivian, do you copy?
I said, do you copy?</i>

348
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:34,354
You know what?

349
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,423
No.

350
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,500
What do you mean,
no? No, no, no.

351
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:39,365
What are you doing?
Vivian, what are you doing?

352
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,695
Thank you.

353
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,463
This is our shot. <i>No, get out.</i>

354
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,365
Vivian, get the fuck
out of there right...

355
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,837
Nicolas Cage! Oh, my God!
You're so fucking awesome!

356
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:52,707
I love you! Oh, thank you.

357
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,375
Oh, me and my nephew
Raymond just watched <i>Croods 2.</i>

358
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,278
<i>Dude! Cracked us up.</i>

359
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:00,815
Can I get a selfie? Sure.

360
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,325
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
No, I like that movie, too.

361
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,393
You did so good
in that movie, man.

362
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,652
Thank you. My goodness.

363
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:06,118
I made that movie
with Emma Stone.

364
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:07,555
You did? She's
one of my favorites.

365
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,766
But you were the best.
Well, thank you.

366
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,222
We look good.

367
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,300
Well, say hi to
your nephew for me.

368
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,626
Okay. Yeah. Raymond. Okay.

369
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,561
Thank you. All right, bye.

370
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,898
Dropped that GPS on him.

371
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,400
Are you out of your mind?
He's a fucking civilian.

372
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,803
<i>He's an actor.</i>

373
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:23,378
Do you remember what
went down in Lisbon?

374
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,739
Fuck Lisbon, man!

375
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:27,374
That was kind of loud.

376
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,844
But fuck Lisbon.
That wasn't my fault.

377
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,345
And by the way,

378
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,547
have you seen <i>Croods 2? No.</i>

379
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:34,146
I'm 44 years old.

380
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,782
Why the fuck would
I see <i>Croods 2?</i>

381
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:36,884
I'm picking you up.

382
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,635
Yeah, Fink, can you hold on?

383
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,579
Excuse me, it's Los Angeles
calling. I need to take this.

384
00:18:56,604 --> 00:18:58,238
Just two minutes. Of course.

385
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,307
Can you hold one second?
I'm getting on a boat.

386
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,342
Thank you. Yeah.

387
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,345
I mean, what do we know
about this guy anyway?

388
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:10,282
Is he a Spanish Dr. No? Is
he into something strange?

389
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,694
<i>Allan did some
research. Hold on.</i>

390
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:13,286
<i>Allan, what does this guy do?</i>

391
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,888
<i>He owns olive groves apparently.</i>

392
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,824
Also, he wrote this screenplay,

393
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:18,726
and he wants Nick to star in it.

394
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,394
Throw that in the fucking trash.

395
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,796
<i>Nick, you're fine.</i>

396
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,507
It's not like he's gonna
want you to suck his dick

397
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,665
or fuck his wife,

398
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:25,875
or watch you watch
him fuck his wife.

399
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,734
I wouldn't think so. <i>Relax.</i>

400
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,537
<i>Have fun and give me
a call when it's done.</i>

401
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,730
You can tell me all about it.

402
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:40,346
Nice place.

403
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,415
Maybe I ought to get
into the olive business.

404
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,451
Mr. Cage, I... Yeah,
excuse me. Real quick.

405
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,796
The guy that owns this
house, what's his name?

406
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:48,221
Javi. Yeah, Javi.

407
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,958
Is Javi going to want
me to, uh, you know...

408
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,894
I'm not sure I understand.

409
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,638
Look, if Javi wants me to
suck his dick, or fuck his wife,

410
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,364
or watch me watch
him fuck his wife,

411
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,808
that's a no-go. You
understand? It's <i>no bueno.</i>

412
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,667
I think so. Okay, and if Javi...

413
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:01,769
I am Javi.

414
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,711
Nick Cage.

415
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:15,516
So, how was it?

416
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:18,484
It was fine,
normal. No big deal.

417
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,654
Come on. Tell me
the truth. Okay, okay.

418
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:22,589
He was incredible. Was he?

419
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:23,990
But also, like, super cool.

420
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:25,792
He was a little taller
than I had imagined

421
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,704
because you know they
say actors are pretty short.

422
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:28,762
So, was he short?

423
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:29,931
No. No?

424
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:30,964
He was...

425
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,968
just right.

426
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,040
Okay, but did he say anything
about your screenplay?

427
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,881
No. He didn't bring it
up, I didn't bring it up.

428
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,272
It wasn't the right time.

429
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,642
Just think about
how would it feel

430
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,611
to say in front of
everyone at the party

431
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:47,781
that Nicolas Cage is starring
in a movie that you wrote.

432
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:48,982
I don't know, Gabriela,

433
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,455
maybe I am living
in a fantasy world.

434
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,417
I mean, look who
we're talking about here.

435
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,653
The man is a legend!

436
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,030
Hi.

437
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:08,536
Hey.

438
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,044
Cheers.

439
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,488
Huh?

440
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,423
What?

441
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,567
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
I thought that...

442
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:32,392
Did you say... No, I did...

443
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,994
Oh, never mind.

444
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,509
Yeah, so along those same
lines, I was wondering...

445
00:21:39,534 --> 00:21:40,644
and it's totally
okay if you haven't,

446
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,036
but I was just wondering

447
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,579
if you had a chance
to read my screenplay?

448
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,006
Javi!

449
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,576
Can I come or it's only for VIP?

450
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,378
Uh, Mr. Cage, this is
Ms. Gabriela Lucchesi. Hi.

451
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,949
She runs all of our
agricultural operations.

452
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,983
And this is my cousin.

453
00:21:57,018 --> 00:21:58,819
Lucas Gutierrez.

454
00:21:58,853 --> 00:22:02,623
Mr. Cage, we obviously are
very excited to have you here.

455
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:03,891
What are you working on next?

456
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:06,059
Well, that's a tough question

457
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,428
for an actor to
get, but it's fine.

458
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,431
Oh. 'Cause
I'm no longer an actor.

459
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,799
I've retired.

460
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:15,936
What? What do you mean, retired?

461
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,673
So, what are you
going to do now?

462
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,943
Live the life of a house cat.

463
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:25,145
Because it's just
a matter of time

464
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,682
before the great power plant
upstairs turns off the juice

465
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:32,019
and we retreat to the
black pit of nothingness

466
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:33,621
from whence we came.

467
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,693
So, tell us about
making <i>The Rock.</i>

468
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:42,963
Bet you wish you
were still making movies

469
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:44,965
like that, huh, Mr. Cage?

470
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,569
Must have been nice
to have been a star.

471
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:51,672
And now...

472
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:19,666
Mr. Cage? Wake up.

473
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,134
Jesus Christ!

474
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,738
So, Mr. Gutierrez has been

475
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,471
waiting all day
for you to get up.

476
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:26,840
He really wants to show you

477
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:28,218
one of his favorite
places of all Spain.

478
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,211
It's called the cliffs
of Cap de Formentor.

479
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,646
Yeah, see, well,
I'm very jet lagged,

480
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,548
so I won't be
attending that, okay?

481
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,616
Thank you.

482
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,588
Oh, my God! Mr. Cage.

483
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:43,557
If Mr. Gutierrez is asking you

484
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,991
to go with him
and see the cliffs,

485
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,636
you're gonna go with
him and see the cliffs.

486
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:47,994
And you're gonna
love the cliffs.

487
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:49,563
Even if you hate the cliffs!

488
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,632
Are we clear?

489
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,569
Gabriela said you are
really excited about the cliffs.

490
00:23:56,604 --> 00:24:00,607
Yeah, very much so. It's just...

491
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,943
I'm not feeling
tip-top right now,

492
00:24:02,977 --> 00:24:04,744
so if you wanna
go out there alone,

493
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,515
I could go back to
the room... Oh, shit!

494
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:08,982
Shit! What?

495
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:14,154
We must go now.

496
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:15,623
Hey!

497
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:18,458
Javi!

498
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:22,930
Javi!

499
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:24,531
What is going on?

500
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:25,700
Faster!

501
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:27,535
What are we running from?

502
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,836
The General!

503
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,605
Javi!

504
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:35,241
Hey!

505
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:37,019
You need to tell me right
now what the hell is going on,

506
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:38,278
or I'm getting my shit,

507
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,623
and I'm going back
to Los Angeles.

508
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:40,647
The General!

509
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,086
The General forbade me
to see his daughter Matilda.

510
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,788
But we defied his orders!

511
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:52,993
And now, he
wants to end my life.

512
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,528
Can't you see him?

513
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,036
All right, all right, I get it.

514
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,237
You're making this up?

515
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,805
What is this?

516
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:08,108
Like a little Stanislavski
improv thing?

517
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:09,609
Well, you can stop.

518
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,578
Stanislavski? Is he
part of the resistance?

519
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:14,647
Stop! I am your guest!

520
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:17,084
Gabriela ripped the
bedspread off me this morning.

521
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:20,121
Now you're sending me
on, like, a wild goose chase!

522
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:22,655
I'm sorry, but you can't
quit acting! You can't!

523
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,191
That's none of your business.

524
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,595
Whether you like it
or not, you have a gift.

525
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:32,098
And that gift brings light
and joy to an increasingly

526
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:35,869
dark and broken world!

527
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:39,339
And to turn your
back on that gift

528
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:43,576
is to turn your back on
the entire human race.

529
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,079
The human race?

530
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:48,182
I'm afraid so.

531
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:50,151
What am I gonna do?

532
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:51,652
Oh, wow. If we don't go now,

533
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:54,121
they will fucking kill us!

534
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:55,655
These people smell blood

535
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:56,900
and they come running.
What am I gonna do?

536
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:58,367
They're almost to
the edge of the forest.

537
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,859
I can hear them.

538
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:01,828
And Matilda, she is
waiting down the coast.

539
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:04,565
We have to go now!
We have to jump!

540
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:15,976
You're in an
untenable situation.

541
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,077
You know that, right?

542
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,114
So tell me one thing.

543
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:23,317
Do you love her?

544
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,385
I've always loved her.

545
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:29,690
Then let's get you
out of here alive.

546
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,365
Oh, shit!

547
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,338
Fuck!

548
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:46,773
Oh, God!

549
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:48,085
I didn't know there was a cliff!

550
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,809
I didn't know it was that high!

551
00:26:49,844 --> 00:26:51,077
We could have died!

552
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,148
You're a wild man.

553
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,097
I prefer bourbon, but thank you.

554
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,624
God, this place is stunning.

555
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:06,359
I bet my daughter

556
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,328
would like it out here.
It'd be good for her.

557
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:09,997
Are you two close?

558
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:13,067
Well, it's impossible to
be close with a 16-year-old.

559
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,301
But I've tried to be
there for her. It's just...

560
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:17,770
There's no script for parenting.

561
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,740
Thank God for my ex, Olivia.

562
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,276
How did you meet Olivia?

563
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,679
She was a make-up artist
on <i>Captain Corelli's Mandolin.</i>

564
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:27,147
Beautiful film. Thank you.

565
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:28,982
Underrated for sure.

566
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:30,183
We just hit it off, you know.

567
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:32,819
She was funny, smart, beautiful.

568
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:34,087
So, what happened?

569
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,057
What happened?

570
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:44,030
What about you? Ever
been married? Kids?

571
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:45,065
No.

572
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,670
There is one woman, but, uh,

573
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:55,476
sometimes circumstances
get in the way of love

574
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,243
and that's just the way it is.

575
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:05,185
Anyway, Mr. Cage,

576
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,054
what is your favorite movie?

577
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:10,490
Oh... Favorite movie?

578
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:15,429
Oh, wow! I mean,
that... That is, uh...

579
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:18,898
That's one of those questions
that's impossible to answer.

580
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:23,336
Because, you see,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

581
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,205
You can't just limit it to one.

582
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,308
It depends upon your
mood, the seasons.

583
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:30,911
All right, let's do
top three. You start.

584
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:33,012
Number one, <i>Face/Off.</i>

585
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,181
Oh, thank you.

586
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:37,483
Woo is a maestro. Thank you.

587
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:40,887
Number two, let me think...

588
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:43,824
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

589
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:46,192
You love
<i>Caligari?</i> I love <i>Caligari.</i>

590
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:49,496
Wow! I was beginning to
think I was the only one.

591
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,397
You gonna run
the table here, Jav?

592
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:55,836
It's hard. It's like you said,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

593
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,905
Thank you.

594
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,375
Look, can you just stop stalling

595
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,042
and answer the question?

596
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,144
What is your third
favorite movie of all time?

597
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:10,518
<i>Paddington 2.</i>

598
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:12,819
What?

599
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:14,556
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,
Paddington 2.</i>

600
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:15,955
Connect those dots.

601
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,366
I mean, I don't wanna
be a snob, but...

602
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:18,959
I cried through
the entire thing.

603
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:20,426
It made me want
to be a better man.

604
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:23,029
Bullshit, man!

605
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,038
<i>Paddington 2</i> is incredible.

606
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:35,409
I fucking told you.

607
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,348
Truth or dare, Nick?

608
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:44,285
Truth.

609
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:53,027
Did you hate my
screenplay? It's okay if you did.

610
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,327
I just need to know.

611
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:56,195
You wrote a script?

612
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,999
I sent it to your agent.

613
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:00,277
He was supposed
to give it to you.

614
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,603
Well, he didn't.

615
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:03,903
I guess I can
understand why he didn't,

616
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,539
but where is it?
I'll read it right now.

617
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,407
Now? Like, right now? Right now.

618
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:08,442
Send it.

619
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:21,522
I sent it. Fantastic.

620
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:25,159
Let's go into town,
have a celebratory drink.

621
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:27,027
You can watch me read it.

622
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,996
See where it
drags. It'll be fun.

623
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,130
No.

624
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:33,133
Honestly, I'm too nervous.

625
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,536
My heart is beating so fast.

626
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:39,239
I think I need to go to bed.

627
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,010
Listen, Javi, truth.

628
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:46,447
I wasn't that thrilled
about coming out here,

629
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,517
but tonight has
been the most fun

630
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,885
I've had in a long, long time.

631
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,122
So, thank you.

632
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,576
Oh. Hey, Nicky.

633
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,242
So, you're unretired then?

634
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:18,077
That's the idea.

635
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:22,415
Javi inspired you, did
he? You like this guy?

636
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:24,519
He has good taste in movies.

637
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,554
Plus, it could be
good for me to do

638
00:31:26,587 --> 00:31:30,525
some smaller roles
with great directors.

639
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:32,960
Some challenging character work.

640
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35,162
Huh. So, like, um... Like what?

641
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:36,698
The gay uncle

642
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,031
in the next Duplass
Brothers movie kind of thing?

643
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:40,334
Exactly.

644
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,970
What the fuck are
you talking about?

645
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:44,971
We haven't worked
since you were 15...

646
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:47,441
forty-one years to
be number seven

647
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:50,443
on a call sheet of a
goddamn student film.

648
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:52,045
I think it's a good idea.

649
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,346
You listen to me.

650
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,083
You're Nick fucking...

651
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,461
Cage!

652
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,731
Addy doesn't need a
struggling artist for a father.

653
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:13,400
She needs you to be a star.

654
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:16,336
Now you get the next
one, baby, and we're back.

655
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,971
Not that we went anywhere.

656
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:21,608
Not that we went anywhere.

657
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:22,942
Come here.

658
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:35,455
Yeah, Nick Cage smooches good.

659
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:39,425
You tell 'em! Nick
Cage smooches good!

660
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,695
I'll have another one.

661
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:56,276
Jesus!

662
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,113
What do you guys
want? You want money?

663
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:02,449
Here, take my watch.
It's not a copy, it's real.

664
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,519
Mr. Cage, we're with the U.S.
Government. We need your help.

665
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:07,421
The man you're
staying with is the head

666
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,423
of a violent
international arms cartel.

667
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,692
Wait, wait, wait. Javi?

668
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:13,560
He's a ruthless motherfucker.

669
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:15,563
He started small, coastal Spain.

670
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,230
But then, he got greedy.

671
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:20,233
Trying to expand his
operations east, west.

672
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:22,102
Trail of dead
bodies in his wake.

673
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,202
Javi Gutierrez?

674
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:24,705
Yes, Javi.

675
00:33:24,739 --> 00:33:26,348
I don't think we're talking
about the same Javi.

676
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:27,585
We're definitely talking
about the same fucking Javi.

677
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:28,618
It's the same fucking guy, man.

678
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:30,644
Okay, okay. So, you're CIA,

679
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:32,412
some kind of
intelligence, right?

680
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,314
And your job is to
read people, yeah?

681
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:36,482
Well, as a thespian,
that is also my job.

682
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:37,728
To understand
people's characters,

683
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:39,318
to feel what they're feeling.

684
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:42,523
Which is how I know that
Javi is not a gun dealer.

685
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:44,223
You're saying
your acting ability

686
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:45,826
trumps five years of hard data

687
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,362
collected by the world's
finest intelligence agency?

688
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,731
My nouveau
shamanic acting ability?

689
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:52,098
You better fucking believe it.

690
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:54,401
Oh! Hey, guys, this sucks.

691
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:57,505
Uh, Nicolas Cage's nouveau
shamanic acting ability

692
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,574
has determined that
we got the wrong guy.

693
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:02,142
So, let's pack up our
shit and fucking go home.

694
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,578
Hey, man, don't mind him.
He's all messed up inside.

695
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:07,114
He just found out his
wife's been fucking his dad.

696
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,817
That's not all the way true.

697
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:12,219
Look, do you
recognize this girl?

698
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,355
No.

699
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,157
It's Maria Delgado.

700
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,293
President of
Catalonia's daughter.

701
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:20,862
Javi's men kidnapped
her two days ago

702
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,405
to force her father
out of the election

703
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,297
and make way for
someone more cartel-friendly.

704
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:25,766
Yeah, the U.S.
doesn't like that.

705
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,266
Yeah, look, hey.

706
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,603
We need to access
Javi's security cameras.

707
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:31,114
We can't get anywhere
near that compound

708
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,338
because it's too fortified.

709
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,608
And then, you show up.

710
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:36,309
So, you want me to, what?

711
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:37,644
Spy on Javi?

712
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,146
Bingo.

713
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,715
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

714
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:42,382
You have a daughter
about her age, right?

715
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:45,318
This came in yesterday.

716
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,456
How do you think
you would feel, huh?

717
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,458
Knowing you could have helped?

718
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:54,161
<i>But you chose not to.</i>

719
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,565
<i>Be a lot of guilt to
carry, wouldn't it?</i>

720
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,702
<i>Because every time
you look at your daughter,</i>

721
00:35:01,735 --> 00:35:03,302
<i>believe me,</i>

722
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:05,706
<i>you are gonna
see that little girl</i>

723
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:08,307
<i>buried in a ditch somewhere.</i>

724
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:10,376
<i>And that will haunt you</i>

725
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,681
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

726
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:24,458
<i>All right, here we go, Nick.</i>

727
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,202
<i>We're going to create
a power blip big enough</i>

728
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,929
<i>to reboot all the
security cameras.</i>

729
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,697
<i>Once that happens,</i>

730
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,599
<i>you got exactly four
minutes and ten seconds</i>

731
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:33,635
<i>to get in and get out before
they come back online.</i>

732
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,565
<i>Don't forget. Set the cameras,</i>

733
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:39,733
<i>and then grab them
when you leave.</i>

734
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:50,744
Uh-oh. Oh, shit, we
got a guy coming.

735
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:52,278
<i>Nick, guard on the way.</i>

736
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,523
<i>All right, Nick, stay calm.</i>

737
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,016
<i>Just like we talked about.</i>

738
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,784
Take the incapacitating
agent out of the pouch.

739
00:36:57,818 --> 00:36:58,920
<i>Put it in your hand.</i>

740
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:00,554
<i>Remove the outer layer.</i>

741
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:02,590
<i>The inner layer has
the chemical on it.</i>

742
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:03,967
<i>Now, if you touch
that to someone's skin,</i>

743
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,525
<i>they'll be out in seconds.</i>

744
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,695
<i>Now, find a place to hide.</i>

745
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:11,532
There's nowhere to hide in here.

746
00:37:12,532 --> 00:37:13,568
Hold on.

747
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:19,005
I think I can hide under the...

748
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,641
I touched my forehead.

749
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:23,043
You touched your forehead?

750
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:24,746
I think so. I'm not 100% sure.

751
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:26,278
Did you or didn't you?

752
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,672
You know what?
I don't think I did.

753
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:33,588
I did. I did.

754
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:35,422
<i>Nick, listen to me right now.</i>

755
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,067
You have 30 seconds until
you're drooling on the floor.

756
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,927
<i>Go back into the pouch
and get the antidote ASAP.</i>

757
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:45,297
It's locked.

758
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:46,643
<i>Where's the
key that we gave you?</i>

759
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:48,969
Inside with the antidote.

760
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:52,304
Oh, fuck this shit!
Okay. Oh, shit. Okay.

761
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:57,911
<i>Okay, Nick,
there's a window to your left.</i>

762
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,981
Go out that window, get outside,

763
00:38:00,014 --> 00:38:01,481
go across the ledge, okay?

764
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:03,083
Scoot across the ledge,

765
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,876
<i>and then climb into the
security room window.</i>

766
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:07,597
What the fuck is wrong with
you? He's three stories up.

767
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:08,742
He's stoned out of his mind.

768
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:13,927
<i>Hola.</i>

769
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:18,498
<i>Do it now, Nick!
Now! He's getting closer.</i>

770
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:20,432
He's fucking dead. He's dead.

771
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,036
Martin, I can hear you.

772
00:38:34,614 --> 00:38:36,416
Come on, Nick. You
can do this, okay?

773
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,451
Keep moving. Keep moving.

774
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,454
<i>Hola?</i>

775
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:49,664
I can't feel my legs.

776
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:51,699
You know, I really
enjoyed working for the CIA.

777
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:54,101
Can't wait to move back
home and work at fucking Sonic.

778
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:55,836
Shit!

779
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:59,405
Like rubber.

780
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,943
Come on, Nick, you got
this. Keep moving, okay?

781
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:08,815
<i>Hold on. We got a
guard in the room.</i>

782
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,485
<i>Wake up, Nick.</i>

783
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,625
<i>Okay, go, go, go, Nick.</i>

784
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:19,726
I love you.

785
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,996
<i>Stay with me. Stay awake.</i>

786
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:24,097
<i>Keep moving. You can do this.</i>

787
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,599
<i>Pull your legs in now.</i>

788
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:26,934
<i>Pull your legs in.</i>

789
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:34,108
I can't move.

790
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,043
Then you're gonna die.
Do you wanna die tonight?

791
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:37,777
This is not how you die.

792
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:39,579
I think it is.

793
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,657
Come on.

794
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,193
Come on, you did
it. You're in there.

795
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,827
Do it, do it! Stay awake!

796
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,630
<i>Come on! Come on, Nick!</i>

797
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:58,065
Come on. Come on.

798
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,431
Come on. You got it.

799
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:00,967
You got it. You got it.

800
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,135
You got it. You got it.

801
00:40:04,704 --> 00:40:06,940
Oh, for fuck's sake,
man! Wake up!

802
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:08,085
<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

803
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:09,809
<i>Get up, Nick. Get up.</i>

804
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:10,945
<i>Get up.</i>

805
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:12,914
Come on, Nick.

806
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:15,081
Come on! Get up!

807
00:40:15,115 --> 00:40:16,483
<i>Get up, Nick.</i>

808
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:21,688
Action!

809
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:27,994
Oh, my God!

810
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:29,630
Yes!

811
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:31,699
How is he up? Trained actor.

812
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:33,233
All right, man, we in.

813
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:36,871
You know, it didn't feel
great betraying Javi like that.

814
00:40:36,903 --> 00:40:39,840
Especially, since I'm still
not convinced he's your guy.

815
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:41,708
But the strange thing is...

816
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:42,885
I can see myself
doing more of this stuff.

817
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:44,644
You know, spycraft.

818
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,847
Subterfuge. What have you.

819
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,615
I think I might
have a real gift for it.

820
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:50,583
Good, 'cause we got
another mission for you.

821
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:53,054
No, no, no! Fuck that!

822
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:54,822
It was terrifying.

823
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,934
I'm about to leave for the
airport after the party, so...

824
00:40:56,958 --> 00:41:00,527
Nick, our intel suggests that
Javi is holding Maria Delgado

825
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:02,530
on the compound right now.

826
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,030
On the compound? <i>Yeah.</i>

827
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:05,733
We need you to help us find her.

828
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:07,034
Which means we need you

829
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:08,936
to figure out a way
to stay a little longer.

830
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:12,873
Vivian, I can't do this.

831
00:41:12,907 --> 00:41:14,909
Yes, you can. We
just saw you do it.

832
00:41:15,842 --> 00:41:17,244
That little girl, Nick?

833
00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:18,846
She doesn't have anybody else.

834
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,782
<i>Just you.</i>

835
00:41:23,117 --> 00:41:25,186
<i>And if you leave,</i>

836
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:27,588
<i>I don't know what's
gonna happen to her.</i>

837
00:41:43,204 --> 00:41:45,940
I just want to thank you
all for coming tonight.

838
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:48,041
It means more to me
than you can know.

839
00:41:48,074 --> 00:41:50,210
And I would like
to tell a story.

840
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:53,114
A few years ago,

841
00:41:53,146 --> 00:41:55,048
my relationship with my father

842
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:57,117
had deteriorated to the point

843
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,987
where we were
no longer speaking.

844
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:01,164
He could be extremely difficult,

845
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,789
my father.

846
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:04,692
And to be fair, maybe
I am not much better.

847
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:08,695
But when he got sick,

848
00:42:09,896 --> 00:42:11,831
I realized

849
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,601
I didn't want to lose him

850
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:16,771
before we could repair
our broken relationship.

851
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,172
But I didn't know how.

852
00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:21,675
And then, one day,

853
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:24,844
about a week before
he died, it happened.

854
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:25,980
A miracle.

855
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,947
I looked up...

856
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:33,820
and I saw on a tiny
little hospital TV...

857
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:36,657
<i>Guarding Tess.</i>

858
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,795
We disagreed about literally
everything, my father and I.

859
00:42:40,827 --> 00:42:42,096
Except for this movie.

860
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:45,266
We both loved it.

861
00:42:45,298 --> 00:42:48,235
We would quote
it back and forth.

862
00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:51,371
In a way, my father was Tess.

863
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:52,873
The former First Lady.

864
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:55,842
And I was Doug Chesnic.

865
00:42:55,876 --> 00:42:57,077
The Secret Service agent

866
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,746
charged with taking care of him.

867
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:04,784
That movie brought us together.

868
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,858
So, on behalf of my
late father and myself,

869
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:14,260
I want to thank you.

870
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,335
I bet you didn't know
Doug Chesnic could have

871
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:23,269
such an impact on someone.

872
00:43:23,304 --> 00:43:26,806
Well, Doug was
a complicated guy.

873
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,275
He had, um,

874
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:30,945
competing allegiances

875
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:32,313
and sometimes,

876
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:35,782
being in the skin of
a character like that

877
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:38,351
can take its toll.

878
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:39,887
Well, thank you
for your sacrifice.

879
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,222
It was extraordinary.

880
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:42,956
Thank you for having me.

881
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,693
And I'm...

882
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:49,797
I'm...

883
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:53,400
excited to announce that

884
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:58,371
Javi has finally allowed
me to read his screenplay

885
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:00,708
which is fantastic.

886
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,742
It's truly a masterclass.

887
00:44:02,775 --> 00:44:05,346
It's easily one of the best
things I've read in years.

888
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:07,347
So, does that mean
that you want to be in it?

889
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,414
I don't.

890
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:11,885
But what I would like is to

891
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:14,188
spend a little more time here

892
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:17,391
on the compound with you.

893
00:44:17,423 --> 00:44:19,360
Coming up with our own...

894
00:44:20,293 --> 00:44:21,427
movie.

895
00:44:22,195 --> 00:44:23,264
What do you say?

896
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:27,300
I say yes.

897
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:30,704
Yes.

898
00:44:36,277 --> 00:44:38,112
<i>I fired Earl.</i>

899
00:44:38,144 --> 00:44:39,322
<i>- This has happened twice now.
- No.</i>

900
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:40,813
<i>He is a driver</i>

901
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:43,250
<i>in the employ of
the Secret Service.</i>

902
00:44:43,284 --> 00:44:44,728
<i>I can't do anything about
the cook or the nurse.</i>

903
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:46,219
<i>No, they work for you.</i>

904
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:47,987
<i>But this guy works
for us and he's gone!</i>

905
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,128
<i>Nick.</i>

906
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:56,338
The security cameras gave
us a probable location for Maria.

907
00:44:56,362 --> 00:44:59,032
I'm sending it to you now.

908
00:44:59,065 --> 00:45:00,701
<i>Find a way to get
into that room, Nick.</i>

909
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:06,206
Mr. Cage.

910
00:45:07,273 --> 00:45:09,342
Oh, hey, Javi. Nick.

911
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:11,378
I realized

912
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:15,416
that if we are going
to create a work of art,

913
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,384
we can't just sit and
stare at a screen.

914
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:19,521
We have to open our minds

915
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:21,054
to the infinite possibilities

916
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:22,489
of what the cosmos has to offer.

917
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,858
What have you got there?

918
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:27,393
Divine inspiration.

919
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,905
Fuck it!

920
00:45:57,224 --> 00:45:59,326
So, I was thinking
that maybe our movie

921
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,061
would be character-driven.

922
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,862
Yeah.

923
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:06,467
Something that doesn't
rely on corny special effects.

924
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:08,969
Right. Or like big explosions.

925
00:46:09,003 --> 00:46:10,505
It has to be nuanced.

926
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:12,472
And work on multiple levels.

927
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:15,275
It should be completely
about performance.

928
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:18,344
And maybe it's just
the drugs talking,

929
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:21,114
but what if we had
like a big drug scene?

930
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:24,251
Oh, wow!

931
00:46:25,885 --> 00:46:27,954
It's gonna be so fucking good.

932
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:31,257
But, like,

933
00:46:32,425 --> 00:46:33,527
what's it about?

934
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:44,304
<i>In terms of
genre, I like comedies.</i>

935
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:47,474
But not when it's just two
people sitting around talking.

936
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:51,210
Oh, man, I can't
stand talkie comedies.

937
00:46:51,244 --> 00:46:53,581
You gotta have some
plot to drive it forward.

938
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:01,954
It's my daughter.

939
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:03,389
Oh.

940
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:19,840
Nick, listen.

941
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:23,376
You know what I was thinking?

942
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:26,480
Maybe we could have, like,
a paranoid thriller-y angle.

943
00:47:26,514 --> 00:47:30,117
Ooh. Paranoid angle. Excellent.

944
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,550
Like, see those
two guys over there?

945
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:34,588
They've been watching us.

946
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:36,056
Right. Right.

947
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:40,094
Wait, have they
been watching us?

948
00:47:40,126 --> 00:47:42,096
I don't know. Have they?

949
00:47:44,498 --> 00:47:47,333
Fuck!

950
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:49,335
Did you see that? They
just looked over at us.

951
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:51,371
Oh, shit!

952
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:53,974
Oh, shit! What's going on?

953
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:55,418
No, no, no. Maybe it
was just a coincidence.

954
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:56,909
I will look again.
Are you ready?

955
00:47:56,943 --> 00:47:58,144
No! Don't make eye contact.

956
00:47:58,177 --> 00:47:59,614
That's how you spook them.

957
00:47:59,646 --> 00:48:01,682
No, that's how you spook a bear.

958
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:03,983
That's right. That is
how you spook a bear.

959
00:48:04,016 --> 00:48:05,586
I apologize.

960
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:08,989
But if you are gonna look,
maybe do like a fake laugh.

961
00:48:09,021 --> 00:48:10,657
A fake laugh? Okay, good. Yeah.

962
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:20,166
Oh, no.

963
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:22,969
Okay, okay. Let's...

964
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:25,371
Let's just get up slowly

965
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:27,106
on the count of three

966
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:28,543
and run.

967
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:30,110
Okay?

968
00:48:30,143 --> 00:48:31,177
One...

969
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:33,213
Oh, fuck!

970
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:39,987
Go, go, go!

971
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:42,155
Faster!

972
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:45,259
This is fucking crazy.

973
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,561
Oh, shit!

974
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:48,663
It's too high.

975
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:50,197
Here.

976
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:53,467
Use me as a human stool.

977
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:55,570
Do it!

978
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:05,278
Grab my hand.

979
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:07,114
Grab it.

980
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:12,351
You're heavier than you look.

981
00:49:16,422 --> 00:49:17,625
I have a very big head.

982
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:20,027
Enormous. An enormous head.

983
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:24,632
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

984
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,534
Will you tell Gabriela
I will miss her?

985
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:28,434
You can tell her yourself. No.

986
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:31,103
It's okay. You
go live a good life.

987
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:32,483
I'm not going
anywhere without you!

988
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:35,175
Now, grab my hand, soldier!

989
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:43,115
But then, we will both die

990
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,085
and I could never live
with myself after that.

991
00:49:45,117 --> 00:49:46,353
So you let go.

992
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:48,454
You let go!

993
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,130
Goodbye, Nicolas Cage.

994
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,034
I'll never forget you, Javs.

995
00:50:02,068 --> 00:50:03,505
I'll never forget you.

996
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:07,340
Now, you get the
hell out of here.

997
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:11,010
You go!

998
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,224
Mr. Cage?

999
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:27,193
Javi?

1000
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:29,630
Buddy! Hey.

1001
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:31,798
Where'd you come from?

1002
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:34,101
Oh.

1003
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:36,302
Yeah...

1004
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:39,617
Turns out we could
have just walked around.

1005
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:41,708
Yeah, I guess so, huh? Whatever.

1006
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,811
There they are.

1007
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,815
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Run!

1008
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,519
Do you see 'em?

1009
00:50:52,554 --> 00:50:54,722
Oh, fuck! Oh!

1010
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:56,088
Shit!

1011
00:50:57,356 --> 00:50:58,358
Ow, ow.

1012
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,398
No, no. I can't drive on
acid. I can't drive on acid.

1013
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:05,632
You have to drive on acid.

1014
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:07,199
You are a better driver than me.

1015
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:08,869
How do you know that?

1016
00:51:08,902 --> 00:51:10,179
Because I read that you did
all of your own driving stunts

1017
00:51:10,202 --> 00:51:11,639
in <i>Gone in 60 Seconds.</i>

1018
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:14,240
Well, that's true. I popped
some good wheelies, right?

1019
00:51:14,273 --> 00:51:16,577
The wheelies are
amazing. Now drive the car!

1020
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,478
They're coming! Let's go!

1021
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:33,795
Oh. Holy shit! What?

1022
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:35,228
Holy shit!

1023
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:36,295
What? Do you see 'em?

1024
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:39,166
No, Nick, I have an idea.

1025
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:41,869
Maybe this movie,
maybe it's about this.

1026
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:43,538
About us.

1027
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:45,405
Our relationship.

1028
00:51:47,507 --> 00:51:48,576
That's good.

1029
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:51,378
That's good.

1030
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:30,585
Is anyone in there?

1031
00:52:30,617 --> 00:52:31,753
<i>Hola?</i>

1032
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:32,786
Hello?

1033
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:35,489
Hello?

1034
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:41,360
You want me to let
you in there, huh?

1035
00:52:42,864 --> 00:52:43,864
I do.

1036
00:52:44,931 --> 00:52:46,501
I wanna know what's inside.

1037
00:52:46,534 --> 00:52:48,702
Regardless of what
the consequences are?

1038
00:52:58,012 --> 00:52:59,880
Because once you go in there,

1039
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,717
it could change the
way you feel about me.

1040
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:12,793
Our entire relationship
could change, Nick Cage.

1041
00:53:15,394 --> 00:53:17,264
I need to go in, Jav.

1042
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:19,934
Open the door.

1043
00:53:49,996 --> 00:53:51,498
Is it too much?

1044
00:53:52,431 --> 00:53:53,534
Trippy.

1045
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:56,302
Trippy.

1046
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:58,806
I know. I am
sorry if it is weird.

1047
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,807
Well, it's a good collection.

1048
00:54:02,043 --> 00:54:04,878
It's very thorough.

1049
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:07,981
"A really elegant string
of pearls configuration."

1050
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,317
<i>The Rock.</i>

1051
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:12,987
"Put the bunny back in the box."

1052
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:14,454
<i>Con Air.</i>

1053
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:19,527
Well, that's just really creepy.

1054
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:21,027
No, it's not creepy.

1055
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:22,496
Oh.

1056
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,931
Is that the chainsaw from <i>Mandy?</i>

1057
00:54:23,965 --> 00:54:25,032
<i>Mandy</i> is a masterpiece.

1058
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:28,835
You know those
are real guns, right?

1059
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:30,538
Of course they are real.

1060
00:54:32,974 --> 00:54:35,909
Custom Springfield Armory.

1061
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:38,913
Made specifically for the film.

1062
00:54:38,945 --> 00:54:40,815
Is this supposed to be me?

1063
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:42,682
It's...

1064
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:44,585
grotesque.

1065
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:46,820
Just look at the guns.

1066
00:54:46,853 --> 00:54:48,755
If you don't mind me asking,

1067
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:50,992
how much did you pay for this

1068
00:54:51,893 --> 00:54:53,827
disturbing statue?

1069
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,063
Hmm. About $6,000.

1070
00:54:57,764 --> 00:54:59,599
I'll give you $20,000 for it.

1071
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:02,702
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage,

1072
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:05,972
but this is not for sale.

1073
00:55:13,748 --> 00:55:15,481
<i>Bad news. Girl's not there.</i>

1074
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:18,585
Good news. Script's cooking.

1075
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:20,887
Feels like Cassavetes
meets Inarritu

1076
00:55:20,922 --> 00:55:22,422
with a dash of Von Trier.

1077
00:55:22,454 --> 00:55:24,791
Nick, but... I know
what you're gonna say.

1078
00:55:24,826 --> 00:55:27,128
Javi has his issues but, my God,

1079
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:30,362
he has an unbelievably
intuitive sense for story.

1080
00:55:30,396 --> 00:55:31,998
He kidnapped a young girl.

1081
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:34,534
And every day that passes,
the likelihood goes up

1082
00:55:34,568 --> 00:55:37,572
that she's gonna be murdered
by Javi or one of his men.

1083
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,472
What do you want me to do now?

1084
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:41,675
I don't know.

1085
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:43,744
I'm still figuring that out.

1086
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:46,614
But for now, why don't you
add a plotline to your movie

1087
00:55:46,646 --> 00:55:48,048
where someone gets kidnapped?

1088
00:55:48,081 --> 00:55:49,717
That way you can see

1089
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,918
where he might,
theoretically, hide a hostage.

1090
00:55:51,952 --> 00:55:53,820
I'm working two jobs here.

1091
00:55:54,621 --> 00:55:55,655
Okay.

1092
00:55:57,657 --> 00:55:59,626
Vivian,

1093
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:02,096
this is a grounded, adult drama

1094
00:56:02,128 --> 00:56:04,396
about two tough, sensitive men

1095
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:05,833
and their unlikely friendship.

1096
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:07,577
They're kind of like
dueling Christ figures.

1097
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:11,137
Which is obviously a pretty
revolutionary idea in itself.

1098
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:13,641
But what is not

1099
00:56:13,673 --> 00:56:16,643
a revolutionary
idea is a kidnapping.

1100
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,512
And if I bring
that into the mix,

1101
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,755
Javi's gonna know
something's up.

1102
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,947
He's a hardliner for tone,

1103
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:23,050
and this mission
will be blown. Okay?

1104
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:24,818
Jesus fucking Christ!

1105
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:28,789
You know, Nick,

1106
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:30,157
I think a kidnapping

1107
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,960
could give this
movie a wider appeal.

1108
00:56:32,994 --> 00:56:34,561
I mean, it's pretty hard

1109
00:56:34,594 --> 00:56:36,496
to find an audience
these days, right?

1110
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,865
Unless you're a Marvel movie,
<i>Star Wars,</i> whatever, yeah.

1111
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,210
Yeah, doesn't
sound like this is that.

1112
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:41,702
No, Vivian, it isn't.

1113
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:43,871
This is an intelligent
film for grown-ups.

1114
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:45,539
Now, personally,

1115
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:49,543
I want a smart,
character-driven, adult drama

1116
00:56:49,577 --> 00:56:52,112
about real life, real people.

1117
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:53,748
But the reality is,

1118
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,516
most people need a bit of a hook

1119
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,885
to get 'em into the theater.

1120
00:56:57,918 --> 00:56:59,586
Okay, now you're
talking about marketing.

1121
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,155
And if you're talking
about marketing,

1122
00:57:01,188 --> 00:57:03,925
then, yes, you do need a
hook to get them into the theater.

1123
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,992
Well, get 'em into
the theater. Come on.

1124
00:57:06,027 --> 00:57:08,427
All you need is
a trailer moment.

1125
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:10,429
Pull!

1126
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:16,570
Hold on, hold on. Your
daughter gets kidnapped?

1127
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,005
Yeah, it's a big trailer moment.

1128
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:19,539
Hey, am I doing this right?

1129
00:57:19,572 --> 00:57:20,951
'Cause I had that
thing in my sights.

1130
00:57:20,974 --> 00:57:22,043
But who kidnaps her?

1131
00:57:22,076 --> 00:57:23,543
Uh, maybe the barrel's warped.

1132
00:57:23,577 --> 00:57:24,588
The barrel is
definitely not warped.

1133
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:25,612
Who kidnaps her?

1134
00:57:26,246 --> 00:57:27,614
Bad guys.

1135
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:29,817
We both put our lives

1136
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:30,960
on the line to save the daughter

1137
00:57:30,985 --> 00:57:32,128
and become better men for it.

1138
00:57:32,152 --> 00:57:33,721
It's classic.

1139
00:57:33,753 --> 00:57:34,797
It feels like a completely
different movie.

1140
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:36,157
Javi, please.

1141
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,925
Just walk down the
road with me on this.

1142
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,626
And then what?

1143
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:42,730
The finale is about
two men saving the girl?

1144
00:57:42,762 --> 00:57:44,097
That's terrible.

1145
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,599
Give me the gun.

1146
00:57:47,702 --> 00:57:49,469
You know the key
to shooting well?

1147
00:57:51,005 --> 00:57:52,539
Controlling your breath.

1148
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:56,143
And you know how to
control your breath, Nick?

1149
00:57:57,177 --> 00:57:58,579
Your heart.

1150
00:57:58,612 --> 00:58:01,215
Your heart must be still.

1151
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:02,583
At peace.

1152
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:05,619
My heart

1153
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:07,054
is not still.

1154
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:08,856
My heart

1155
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:09,889
is not at peace.

1156
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:14,829
Do you know why?

1157
00:58:14,862 --> 00:58:16,197
Hey, Javi.

1158
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,733
If you're not gonna shoot,
maybe hand me the gun?

1159
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:20,233
Because you're lying to me.

1160
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:21,302
What?

1161
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:24,804
Don't fucking lie to me.

1162
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:25,905
I'm not!

1163
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,641
Don't fucking lie to me!

1164
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,277
Oh, my God, I'm not! I swear!

1165
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:32,813
I know why you keep on
talking about this kidnapped girl.

1166
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,882
You feel guilty about
your relationship

1167
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:37,050
to your own daughter.

1168
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,222
Oh, my God, yes.

1169
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:43,824
A thousand times,
yes. You are blocked.

1170
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:45,760
Creatively.

1171
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:47,128
Because you feel guilty

1172
00:58:47,161 --> 00:58:48,963
about what kind of
father you have been.

1173
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:51,065
You're right. Yep.

1174
00:58:51,097 --> 00:58:52,132
You're 100% right.

1175
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:53,233
Pull!

1176
00:59:13,286 --> 00:59:15,222
Vivian, what's going on?

1177
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:17,625
Nick, you need to get out
of that house immediately.

1178
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:19,626
<i>The Agency caught a
wiretap on our phones.</i>

1179
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,295
<i>Then I picked up
a guy tailing me.</i>

1180
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:23,898
If they've made me,
they've likely made you.

1181
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:25,331
All right. Shit.

1182
00:59:25,365 --> 00:59:27,601
<i>Nick, we can no longer
guarantee your safety.</i>

1183
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,704
Jesus Christ!

1184
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:32,005
You scared the hell out of me.

1185
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:33,773
Nick,

1186
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:35,208
I need you to come with me.

1187
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:38,778
Right now?

1188
00:59:41,815 --> 00:59:44,318
I'm sorry to have to
take this step, Nick.

1189
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,255
You don't,
though. You really don't.

1190
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:49,989
No, it is the only option.

1191
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:54,195
Can I just call
my family quickly?

1192
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:55,762
Tell them I love them.

1193
00:59:56,297 --> 00:59:57,731
What?

1194
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:59,733
There's no need to call them.

1195
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:00,800
They are here.

1196
01:00:02,068 --> 01:00:03,137
Dad. Nick.

1197
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,237
Are you okay? What...

1198
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:06,039
What the hell is going on?

1199
01:00:06,072 --> 01:00:07,173
Your friend called to say

1200
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:09,009
you were so sick
you couldn't talk.

1201
01:00:09,043 --> 01:00:10,911
We're worried about you. Yeah.

1202
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:12,813
You wanna deal with me,
Javi? You deal with me.

1203
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:14,248
But I'm begging you, please,

1204
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,815
please leave my
family out of this.

1205
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:17,059
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

1206
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,184
You've left me no choice.

1207
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:20,387
Are you dying, Dad? Yes.

1208
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,688
Oh, my God. What?

1209
01:00:21,722 --> 01:00:23,324
Creatively. Oh, come on.

1210
01:00:23,356 --> 01:00:24,925
No, physically,
he is tremendous.

1211
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:27,760
I mean, he will
probably outlive us all.

1212
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:29,396
So, you're not even sick?

1213
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:30,831
I'm okay, honey.

1214
01:00:30,864 --> 01:00:32,666
I'm fine. I'm okay. Fuck you.

1215
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:35,335
Look, I have grown to care
very deeply about your father.

1216
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:36,936
And ex-husband.

1217
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:38,338
We are working
on a movie together.

1218
01:00:38,371 --> 01:00:42,710
A beautiful
character-driven, adult drama.

1219
01:00:42,742 --> 01:00:46,847
But he has so many
unresolved issues with you

1220
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,983
that it is beginning
to bleed into the work

1221
01:00:49,016 --> 01:00:50,083
in a negative way.

1222
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:51,284
Isn't that right, Nick?

1223
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:53,853
Are you both out of
your fucking minds?

1224
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,755
Well, you see, he
has so many regrets.

1225
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:58,391
Yeah. Well, here is
another one to add to the list.

1226
01:00:58,425 --> 01:00:59,960
We've been on a plane.

1227
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,996
All day!

1228
01:01:02,028 --> 01:01:03,197
I had to cancel clients.

1229
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,898
We were panicking

1230
01:01:04,931 --> 01:01:05,865
because we couldn't find
anyone to feed the cats.

1231
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,168
You know, they could be dead

1232
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:08,969
by the time we get
home after this bullshit.

1233
01:01:09,003 --> 01:01:10,971
House smelling like a
dead cat. That's great.

1234
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:12,373
That's fun.

1235
01:01:12,405 --> 01:01:14,208
Well, I had a cat die
in the kitchen once.

1236
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:16,809
And my grandmother
was never able

1237
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:18,144
to get rid of the smell.

1238
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:19,813
I am very sorry for
the inconvenience,

1239
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,315
but this is an emergency.

1240
01:01:21,347 --> 01:01:23,483
Have lunch with us.

1241
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:25,219
And let him say
what he has to say.

1242
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:26,987
Don't you think that's
a good idea, Nick?

1243
01:01:30,123 --> 01:01:33,460
Lunch is a wonderful idea, Javi.

1244
01:01:33,494 --> 01:01:36,829
And then, afterwards,
they can go home, right?

1245
01:01:38,965 --> 01:01:40,166
Great.

1246
01:01:40,201 --> 01:01:41,902
Let's have some fucking tapas.

1247
01:01:43,505 --> 01:01:45,005
This is so weird.

1248
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:46,373
Yeah, well... That's...

1249
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,809
What'd you expect?

1250
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,913
I wanna apologize
to both of you.

1251
01:01:54,481 --> 01:01:56,849
I think I should have
been more present

1252
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:58,985
while I was at home.

1253
01:01:59,018 --> 01:02:03,356
I didn't always need to
be focused on my work.

1254
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:05,893
My face in a script.

1255
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,065
But here's what I
keep coming back to.

1256
01:02:11,097 --> 01:02:14,335
Would either of you
have wanted to prevent me

1257
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:16,070
from living my artistic dreams?

1258
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:18,838
Because I sure know I
wouldn't have wanted that

1259
01:02:18,871 --> 01:02:20,306
for either of you.

1260
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,179
We flew to Majorca for that?

1261
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:27,815
Wow.

1262
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:29,382
That was fucking pathetic.

1263
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:31,085
God, it really was, wasn't it?

1264
01:02:31,117 --> 01:02:32,557
No, no, no. I am
honestly speechless.

1265
01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:35,289
Really? Because this
shit, you get used to it.

1266
01:02:35,322 --> 01:02:37,123
Yeah, that's pretty
much par for the course.

1267
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:38,192
Mmm-hmm.

1268
01:02:40,193 --> 01:02:42,429
Can't we just focus

1269
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:45,266
on the good times
we did have together?

1270
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:48,802
Addy, that trip we
took across the desert.

1271
01:02:48,835 --> 01:02:50,505
I never showed you this before,

1272
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:52,507
but I keep this little
photo in my wallet

1273
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:55,510
to remind me of
all the fun we had.

1274
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:57,579
And, uh,

1275
01:02:57,612 --> 01:03:00,179
I know it wasn't great,

1276
01:03:00,213 --> 01:03:01,849
but that song...

1277
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:04,552
I meant that moment
that I wrote in that song.

1278
01:03:04,585 --> 01:03:06,019
I meant it.

1279
01:03:06,052 --> 01:03:07,920
You didn't write it.

1280
01:03:07,954 --> 01:03:09,289
You got drunk
and you made it up,

1281
01:03:09,322 --> 01:03:10,592
because you couldn't stand

1282
01:03:10,625 --> 01:03:12,159
not being the
center of attention

1283
01:03:12,192 --> 01:03:13,293
for two fucking seconds.

1284
01:03:13,327 --> 01:03:14,827
Addy.

1285
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:17,431
Because everything
always has to be about you.

1286
01:03:18,498 --> 01:03:20,166
What you like.

1287
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:21,434
What books you've read.

1288
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,070
What movies you're into.

1289
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:25,873
It's fucked up, you know?

1290
01:03:26,907 --> 01:03:28,342
Like, I'm your daughter

1291
01:03:29,242 --> 01:03:31,344
and I get nervous.

1292
01:03:31,378 --> 01:03:33,581
Like, debilitating
fucking anxiety

1293
01:03:33,614 --> 01:03:35,382
that if I don't
like what you like,

1294
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:37,483
you won't like me.

1295
01:03:37,518 --> 01:03:41,623
Addy, I was sharing the things
that were meaningful to me.

1296
01:03:41,655 --> 01:03:42,922
That were important to me.

1297
01:03:42,956 --> 01:03:45,125
No, you weren't. You weren't.

1298
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:46,360
You were trying to mold me

1299
01:03:46,393 --> 01:03:48,027
into this little version of you.

1300
01:03:48,461 --> 01:03:49,963
Mold you?

1301
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:52,298
Guide you. Addy, I love you.

1302
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:55,503
I love you more than
anything in the world.

1303
01:03:55,536 --> 01:03:59,072
And I want you to
know I was trying.

1304
01:03:59,106 --> 01:04:00,940
I know. I know you were trying.

1305
01:04:01,643 --> 01:04:04,077
You're always trying.

1306
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,347
Fuck, that's actually
the saddest part.

1307
01:04:12,485 --> 01:04:14,355
Shit.

1308
01:04:14,387 --> 01:04:16,748
I think we have more work
than I realized, but this is good.

1309
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:19,561
This is very good.

1310
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:21,461
This is a good first step.

1311
01:04:23,996 --> 01:04:25,932
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Gutierrez,

1312
01:04:25,965 --> 01:04:27,635
but you have a visitor.

1313
01:04:27,668 --> 01:04:28,902
<i>Gracias.</i>

1314
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:37,679
Oh! Hollywood Javi. There he is.

1315
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:44,518
I have some news for you.

1316
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:46,253
Javi Ford Coppola.

1317
01:04:46,286 --> 01:04:48,054
Sit.

1318
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:49,255
Eat with me.

1319
01:05:02,369 --> 01:05:03,903
Froot Loops?

1320
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:06,574
Delicious.

1321
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,208
Taste it.

1322
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,615
I love Froot Loops.

1323
01:05:24,257 --> 01:05:26,326
Sergio Baldassari? Huh?

1324
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:58,257
Hmm.

1325
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:10,572
Yeah.

1326
01:06:14,775 --> 01:06:17,545
But I can't do a
deal with the Italians

1327
01:06:18,512 --> 01:06:20,179
if I am being betrayed.

1328
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:27,054
He flew my wife and daughter

1329
01:06:27,086 --> 01:06:28,130
all the way out to Majorca.

1330
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:29,188
My family!

1331
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:30,289
Shit!

1332
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:31,793
No, don't say "shit"!

1333
01:06:31,826 --> 01:06:33,728
You got us into this.
You get us out of this.

1334
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,262
<i>There's no way</i>

1335
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:37,130
we can mobilize
an extraction in time.

1336
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:38,699
Then, what am I supposed to do?

1337
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:41,400
If you can get Javi alone,
and then take him out,

1338
01:06:41,434 --> 01:06:43,737
<i>it'll buy the Agency time
to get you all out of there.</i>

1339
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:45,539
Do you have access to a firearm?

1340
01:06:46,773 --> 01:06:48,108
I might.

1341
01:06:48,141 --> 01:06:49,777
<i>Nick, I'm sorry,</i>

1342
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:51,771
<i>but this is the best way
to safeguard your family.</i>

1343
01:06:56,617 --> 01:06:58,820
Listen, I need you
to be honest with me.

1344
01:06:58,853 --> 01:07:00,119
What the fuck is happening?

1345
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:01,454
Okay.

1346
01:07:01,487 --> 01:07:03,090
I'm going to tell you something,

1347
01:07:03,123 --> 01:07:04,391
but please don't freak out.

1348
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,061
I'm working for the CIA.

1349
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:13,811
Are you having a
nervous breakdown?

1350
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:16,402
Probably. But I'm
telling you the truth.

1351
01:07:16,436 --> 01:07:18,516
They wanted some information
on Javi's business dealings

1352
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:20,139
so I've been helping them.

1353
01:07:20,172 --> 01:07:21,619
And the strange thing is,
it does kind of make sense

1354
01:07:21,643 --> 01:07:24,378
given that so much
of acting is like spying.

1355
01:07:24,411 --> 01:07:25,822
Do you have any
idea how this sounds?

1356
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:28,081
'Cause I mean, it's
not... It's not good.

1357
01:07:28,114 --> 01:07:31,318
Okay, I need an hour to
do one final thing for them

1358
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:32,820
and when I get back,

1359
01:07:32,853 --> 01:07:36,188
the three of us will fly to
Los Angeles together, okay?

1360
01:07:36,222 --> 01:07:38,157
I don't know what to say.

1361
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:40,827
Don't say anything. Just
take Addy back to my room.

1362
01:07:40,862 --> 01:07:42,797
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't go anywhere.

1363
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:44,666
I'll be back to get
you. I promise.

1364
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:45,699
I love you.

1365
01:07:58,846 --> 01:08:01,481
Your friend, Nicolas Cage,

1366
01:08:01,516 --> 01:08:03,382
the fucking star of Hollywood

1367
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:05,552
is working for the
U.S. government.

1368
01:08:22,368 --> 01:08:23,871
Oh, bullshit!

1369
01:08:23,904 --> 01:08:25,271
Bullshit!

1370
01:08:25,305 --> 01:08:26,541
Bullshit!

1371
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,545
Bullshit!

1372
01:08:30,578 --> 01:08:31,679
Listen.

1373
01:08:34,748 --> 01:08:36,315
<i>I see myself doing more</i>

1374
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,595
<i>of this stuff. You
know, spycraft.</i>

1375
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:39,820
<i>Subterfuge. What have you.</i>

1376
01:08:39,854 --> 01:08:41,722
<i>I think I might
have a real gift for it.</i>

1377
01:08:41,756 --> 01:08:43,824
<i>Good, 'cause we
got another mission for you.</i>

1378
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:52,833
No.

1379
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:54,333
Lucas, no.

1380
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:04,176
Lucas.

1381
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:19,894
No! No, no, no!

1382
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:33,707
I would love to
believe you, <i>primo.</i>

1383
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:37,645
But either I kill you,

1384
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,847
or you kill Nicolas Cage.

1385
01:09:46,787 --> 01:09:48,188
Your choice.

1386
01:10:57,524 --> 01:10:58,525
Hi.

1387
01:10:59,493 --> 01:11:00,761
Hey.

1388
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:03,564
I'm sorry.

1389
01:11:03,597 --> 01:11:06,466
I should have asked you
before bringing them down.

1390
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:08,903
Yeah.

1391
01:11:08,935 --> 01:11:10,872
And I was thinking

1392
01:11:10,904 --> 01:11:13,640
maybe a kidnapping would work.

1393
01:11:13,673 --> 01:11:16,543
Our movie would start out
as a beautiful character piece

1394
01:11:16,577 --> 01:11:18,880
and then, slowly change
into a more thrilling...

1395
01:11:18,912 --> 01:11:21,047
Hollywood blockbuster.

1396
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:24,652
Then there's
something for everyone.

1397
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:26,753
Would you like to
drive out to the cliffs?

1398
01:11:29,055 --> 01:11:31,792
Clear our heads, and
think through the third act?

1399
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,061
Perfect.

1400
01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:55,048
So...

1401
01:11:57,819 --> 01:11:58,853
We should go.

1402
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:00,787
Yeah.

1403
01:12:08,628 --> 01:12:09,831
Are those new shoes?

1404
01:12:09,863 --> 01:12:10,898
These?

1405
01:12:10,931 --> 01:12:12,766
No, I've had these.

1406
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,569
Oh.

1407
01:12:14,601 --> 01:12:16,002
I haven't seen them before.

1408
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:17,436
I don't wear them very much.

1409
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:18,715
I don't think they're really me.

1410
01:12:18,738 --> 01:12:19,974
What?

1411
01:12:20,006 --> 01:12:22,109
They're great. They
look incredible on you.

1412
01:12:22,143 --> 01:12:24,578
They're totally you. Love 'em.

1413
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:25,947
Do you wanna try them on?

1414
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:27,515
I think they would
look amazing on you.

1415
01:12:30,117 --> 01:12:31,118
Oh, wow!

1416
01:12:33,186 --> 01:12:34,855
Those look incredible on you.

1417
01:12:34,889 --> 01:12:36,823
I like how those
look on you. Yeah.

1418
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:41,394
You wanna trade?

1419
01:12:41,427 --> 01:12:42,429
Like, permanently?

1420
01:12:44,463 --> 01:12:45,465
Okay.

1421
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:57,110
Cool.

1422
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:04,518
I'm really glad I
got to meet you.

1423
01:13:05,786 --> 01:13:07,822
You're the kind
of friend I could

1424
01:13:09,623 --> 01:13:13,027
not see for years, and
not even really talk to

1425
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,427
and just pick up
right where we left off.

1426
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:16,697
I totally agree.

1427
01:13:17,597 --> 01:13:19,166
It's just...

1428
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,501
Easy.

1429
01:13:33,146 --> 01:13:34,148
Well...

1430
01:13:37,518 --> 01:13:38,819
I guess it's time to figure out

1431
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:40,121
how this thing ends.

1432
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:58,872
Nick...

1433
01:13:58,905 --> 01:14:00,875
I meant what I said back there.

1434
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:02,909
Me, too.

1435
01:14:04,177 --> 01:14:06,079
Which is why this really hurts.

1436
01:14:08,114 --> 01:14:09,783
Javi.

1437
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:12,019
You brought me out
here to kill me, man?

1438
01:14:12,052 --> 01:14:13,119
I'm sorry, Nick.

1439
01:14:13,154 --> 01:14:14,689
So am I.

1440
01:14:14,721 --> 01:14:16,724
'Cause you pull that
trigger and we're both dead.

1441
01:14:16,756 --> 01:14:19,827
Wait. You were gonna kill me?

1442
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:21,662
And are those my golden guns?

1443
01:14:21,695 --> 01:14:24,265
They're my golden guns.

1444
01:14:24,297 --> 01:14:26,510
And it looks like we both
had a little secret, doesn't it?

1445
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:27,935
Why the fuck would you kill me?

1446
01:14:27,969 --> 01:14:29,770
You're the head of a
criminal organization.

1447
01:14:29,804 --> 01:14:32,707
My cousin Lucas is the
head of the organization.

1448
01:14:32,739 --> 01:14:34,675
CIA said you ran it.

1449
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,944
The whole world thinks I run it.

1450
01:14:36,978 --> 01:14:39,546
When my father
died, Lucas took over.

1451
01:14:39,579 --> 01:14:41,181
He forced me to
be the figurehead.

1452
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:42,582
You take his money.

1453
01:14:42,615 --> 01:14:44,851
You don't just leave
this world, Nick.

1454
01:14:44,885 --> 01:14:47,854
You and everyone you care
about is in constant danger.

1455
01:14:47,887 --> 01:14:49,657
Why do you think I
cannot be with Gabriela?

1456
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,592
You... You're into Gabriela?

1457
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:53,927
Are you fucking kidding me?

1458
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:55,563
I can't be with Gabriella,

1459
01:14:55,595 --> 01:14:56,840
because that would
put a target on her back.

1460
01:14:56,863 --> 01:14:57,832
Wait, you seriously
didn't realize

1461
01:14:57,864 --> 01:14:58,798
that we liked each other?

1462
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:00,001
You're in the CIA!

1463
01:15:00,033 --> 01:15:01,301
I'm not in the CIA.

1464
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:04,738
I'm a goddamn
actor. You know that.

1465
01:15:04,771 --> 01:15:06,172
The only organization
I'm a part of

1466
01:15:06,207 --> 01:15:08,676
is the Screen Actors
Guild of America.

1467
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,220
And AFTRA. But I don't
even know what that is.

1468
01:15:10,243 --> 01:15:12,189
I think it's a radio thing.
Just put down the gun.

1469
01:15:12,212 --> 01:15:14,081
No way. You go first.

1470
01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:15,692
I'm not going first. You
brought my family out here.

1471
01:15:15,716 --> 01:15:17,327
This is so fucked! I
don't wanna kill you.

1472
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,853
You're the last
person I wanna kill.

1473
01:15:18,886 --> 01:15:20,854
I fucking love you! I love you!

1474
01:15:26,694 --> 01:15:27,994
It's my cousin.

1475
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:29,139
He must have known
I wouldn't kill you.

1476
01:15:29,162 --> 01:15:30,597
I thought so.

1477
01:15:30,631 --> 01:15:31,998
Which is why I
should always trust

1478
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:34,034
my shamanic
instincts as a thespian.

1479
01:15:35,603 --> 01:15:37,738
Fuck!

1480
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:46,212
Faster! I'm trying.

1481
01:15:46,247 --> 01:15:48,149
Your shoes don't
offer any ankle support.

1482
01:15:53,686 --> 01:15:55,189
Ah, fuck!

1483
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:02,595
Okay. You just run out
there. You get the truck.

1484
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,306
You come back and get
me. I will keep a lookout.

1485
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:07,268
Uh-huh. Love it. Love the plan.

1486
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:09,036
But given that you've saddled me

1487
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:11,337
with what basically amounts
to fucking penny loafers

1488
01:16:11,372 --> 01:16:13,207
maybe you should
go, and I'll stay here.

1489
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:14,942
I love that plan, I do.

1490
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,043
But you are a faster
runner than me,

1491
01:16:17,078 --> 01:16:18,746
even with subpar footwear.

1492
01:16:18,779 --> 01:16:20,157
I saw how fast you were
in <i>National Treasure.</i>

1493
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,948
No, that'd be the
stunt department.

1494
01:16:21,981 --> 01:16:23,951
Not according to the
<i>Making Of</i> featurette.

1495
01:16:25,051 --> 01:16:27,755
Fine, I'll go. Wait!

1496
01:16:27,787 --> 01:16:29,689
So, you're gonna
go? I'm going with you.

1497
01:16:39,033 --> 01:16:40,033
There they are!

1498
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:54,347
Ah, shit!

1499
01:16:57,917 --> 01:16:59,185
He's coming up on us.

1500
01:17:03,756 --> 01:17:04,992
On your left! On your left!

1501
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:09,697
Holy shit!

1502
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,402
Hit the brakes! What?

1503
01:17:15,435 --> 01:17:17,046
Hit the brakes. He will
hit the back of the truck.

1504
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:18,280
That won't work.
Yes, it will. Yes, it will.

1505
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:19,773
Just do it. Do it! Do it! Do it!

1506
01:17:24,177 --> 01:17:25,912
Don't worry, he's
totally passed out.

1507
01:17:27,113 --> 01:17:28,815
Fuck!

1508
01:17:32,418 --> 01:17:34,721
I'm okay. Are you okay?

1509
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:48,801
Liv.

1510
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:50,275
They took Addy,
Nick. They took Addy?

1511
01:17:50,304 --> 01:17:51,914
She went outside to find
you and they just grabbed her.

1512
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:53,806
There are more soldiers
coming. We have to go.

1513
01:17:54,307 --> 01:17:55,309
Fuck!

1514
01:18:01,448 --> 01:18:03,283
Vivian? Hello.

1515
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:04,118
<i>Nick, I've sent you the address.</i>

1516
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:05,219
<i>You on the way?</i>

1517
01:18:05,252 --> 01:18:07,121
What? They have my daughter.

1518
01:18:07,154 --> 01:18:08,454
What do they want with her?

1519
01:18:08,488 --> 01:18:09,989
<i>Unfortunately, she's being used</i>

1520
01:18:10,024 --> 01:18:11,792
<i>to put pressure on
the U.S. government</i>

1521
01:18:11,824 --> 01:18:13,403
<i>so they'll back off their
support of Delgado.</i>

1522
01:18:13,426 --> 01:18:16,229
<i>And unless Delgado
drops out of the election...</i>

1523
01:18:16,262 --> 01:18:17,864
<i>Nick, I'm sorry,</i>

1524
01:18:17,898 --> 01:18:20,067
<i>but they said they're
gonna kill both girls.</i>

1525
01:18:21,068 --> 01:18:22,403
What? What? What?

1526
01:18:22,435 --> 01:18:24,037
You're gonna get
him to drop out, right?

1527
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,506
You're gonna get
him to drop out!

1528
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:28,007
Just come directly here.

1529
01:19:24,331 --> 01:19:25,832
Oh, fucking...

1530
01:19:29,336 --> 01:19:30,880
His people
could still be in the area.

1531
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:32,372
We have to go. Where?

1532
01:19:32,405 --> 01:19:34,207
I have a place. Let's go.

1533
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,680
Come, come. Come now.

1534
01:19:38,945 --> 01:19:40,582
So, what's the plan here?

1535
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:44,318
You gonna be a big
hero? Save Addy yourself?

1536
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:46,487
You'll end up dead like her.

1537
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,189
Leave it to the professionals.

1538
01:19:49,222 --> 01:19:51,024
Local police. Whomever.

1539
01:19:51,057 --> 01:19:52,458
There is no one else.

1540
01:19:55,962 --> 01:19:57,297
I love you.

1541
01:19:57,331 --> 01:19:59,332
And I have always
looked out for you.

1542
01:19:59,365 --> 01:20:01,167
Get off of me!

1543
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:02,569
I have to go in there.

1544
01:20:02,604 --> 01:20:05,104
Because Addy has to
know I fought for her.

1545
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:10,043
I'm trying to help you,
and you won't listen!

1546
01:20:10,077 --> 01:20:11,845
How are you helping me, huh?

1547
01:20:11,878 --> 01:20:13,314
How are you ever helping me?

1548
01:20:15,248 --> 01:20:17,618
You need to know
who you are, Nick.

1549
01:20:17,652 --> 01:20:19,153
This isn't a role.

1550
01:20:19,185 --> 01:20:21,020
You're not a hero.

1551
01:20:21,055 --> 01:20:22,431
<i>You're just some guy
who's about to get us killed.</i>

1552
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:24,158
<i>You fucking idiot!</i>

1553
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:39,372
I bought this house 20 years ago

1554
01:20:39,405 --> 01:20:41,609
for a situation just like this.

1555
01:20:41,643 --> 01:20:44,043
It has everything we
need. Food, passports,

1556
01:20:44,078 --> 01:20:45,579
materials for disguise.

1557
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,047
We'll be safe for the night.

1558
01:20:52,252 --> 01:20:53,621
Olivia,

1559
01:20:53,654 --> 01:20:55,456
I promise you will get
your daughter back.

1560
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,335
The girls are likely being held

1561
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:09,970
in my cousin's compound.

1562
01:21:10,002 --> 01:21:12,038
It is a monastery that
they use as a cover,

1563
01:21:12,072 --> 01:21:13,574
but it is a fortress.

1564
01:21:13,608 --> 01:21:15,609
It is impenetrable. There
are walls on every side.

1565
01:21:15,643 --> 01:21:16,976
Any escape routes?

1566
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,912
Tunnels. But with metal doors

1567
01:21:18,945 --> 01:21:20,515
that only open from the inside.

1568
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:22,024
Even if it weren't for
all of the armed guards,

1569
01:21:22,048 --> 01:21:23,984
it is impossible to get in.

1570
01:21:24,016 --> 01:21:26,386
I mean, this psychopath
is gonna kill our daughter

1571
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,555
in 12 hours.

1572
01:21:27,588 --> 01:21:29,524
So, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

1573
01:21:37,631 --> 01:21:41,100
We are going to walk straight
in through the front gate.

1574
01:21:43,637 --> 01:21:46,073
Okay, cool. Very
dramatic answer.

1575
01:21:46,105 --> 01:21:48,242
How's that supposed to work?

1576
01:21:48,274 --> 01:21:49,351
Lucas is trying
to form an alliance

1577
01:21:49,376 --> 01:21:50,677
with Sergio Baldassari,

1578
01:21:50,712 --> 01:21:52,546
the head of the
Calabero crime family.

1579
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:55,617
Baldassari, I mean, no one
has seen him for 15 years.

1580
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:59,485
Exactly. And since
no one has seen him

1581
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,256
no one knows exactly
what he looks like.

1582
01:22:02,288 --> 01:22:03,591
Olivia.

1583
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:04,667
Nick says that you
were an incredible

1584
01:22:04,692 --> 01:22:06,359
makeup artist when you met.

1585
01:22:06,393 --> 01:22:09,395
So, with some prosthetics
and a little makeup...

1586
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,364
Then I could play Sergio.

1587
01:22:26,747 --> 01:22:28,314
Lucas Gutierrez!

1588
01:22:33,052 --> 01:22:34,756
I'd like to introduce
my wife Barbara.

1589
01:22:34,788 --> 01:22:38,391
Why for? She was born in
Santa Barbara, California.

1590
01:22:41,695 --> 01:22:44,631
You think I'm fucking
stupid, Sergio, hmm?

1591
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:47,234
You think you're just gonna
walk in here after 15 years

1592
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:48,703
and kill me,

1593
01:22:48,735 --> 01:22:50,369
you motherfucker, hmm?

1594
01:22:50,404 --> 01:22:51,582
He's cutting my fucking ear off!

1595
01:22:51,605 --> 01:22:53,407
Who are you working
for? Three seconds.

1596
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:55,208
It's just me! Two!

1597
01:22:55,242 --> 01:22:56,275
I promise!

1598
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,149
You think she can
help you, Sergio, hmm?

1599
01:23:04,752 --> 01:23:06,554
Go ahead.

1600
01:23:06,587 --> 01:23:09,288
You kill him, I'll
still make the deal.

1601
01:23:09,323 --> 01:23:11,024
But I don't think
you're gonna kill him.

1602
01:23:12,726 --> 01:23:14,529
You don't think I'll kill him?

1603
01:23:14,561 --> 01:23:16,038
No, I think if you
were gonna kill him,

1604
01:23:16,063 --> 01:23:17,599
you would have done it by now.

1605
01:23:17,631 --> 01:23:19,332
So, no, I don't
think you'll do it.

1606
01:23:21,536 --> 01:23:23,738
Although, I am wondering

1607
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:26,372
why the fuck you think
you can intimidate me?

1608
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:31,110
Okay, Barbara
from Santa Barbara.

1609
01:23:31,144 --> 01:23:32,212
Okay, Barbara.

1610
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,750
It is good to see you, Sergio.

1611
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:37,283
Been far too long.

1612
01:23:37,317 --> 01:23:38,552
You okay?

1613
01:23:38,586 --> 01:23:40,654
My people will
show you to a room.

1614
01:23:40,688 --> 01:23:44,157
Freshen up, and
then, we'll talk.

1615
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:47,595
God, how does my ear
look? He almost cut off my ear.

1616
01:23:47,628 --> 01:23:49,171
Shit! We've only got
about 15 minutes, Nick.

1617
01:23:49,195 --> 01:23:50,564
We've gotta go find Addy.

1618
01:23:50,597 --> 01:23:52,375
I know. I know.
According to Javi's map,

1619
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:53,801
they're probably holding her

1620
01:23:53,835 --> 01:23:55,515
in the basement of
the building right here.

1621
01:24:05,244 --> 01:24:06,246
You ready?

1622
01:24:23,229 --> 01:24:24,230
What do we do?

1623
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:31,470
Oh, good one.

1624
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:37,310
Get his gun.

1625
01:24:40,648 --> 01:24:42,349
Drop the gun, Sergio.

1626
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,454
Neither of you are
supposed to be here.

1627
01:24:49,422 --> 01:24:50,489
Come with me.

1628
01:24:57,731 --> 01:24:58,733
Lucas.

1629
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:08,876
A gun?

1630
01:25:08,909 --> 01:25:10,344
Okay, Sergio.

1631
01:25:10,377 --> 01:25:12,279
What's the deal, my man?

1632
01:25:12,311 --> 01:25:13,715
You got a fucking problem

1633
01:25:13,747 --> 01:25:15,917
you'd like to tell
me about or...

1634
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:18,586
I was beginning to think
you don't have the girl

1635
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:22,724
and since our deal was based
on Delgado dropping out...

1636
01:25:22,756 --> 01:25:24,157
- He'll drop out.
- Fuck.

1637
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:25,492
But he hasn't done it yet.

1638
01:25:25,525 --> 01:25:27,226
Lucas.

1639
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:35,167
- Lucas!
- Now!

1640
01:25:36,804 --> 01:25:37,805
Okay.

1641
01:25:40,975 --> 01:25:42,777
You know,

1642
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:47,180
if you and I are gonna be
in business together, Sergio,

1643
01:25:47,213 --> 01:25:48,882
you're gonna need to trust me.

1644
01:25:49,516 --> 01:25:50,518
Hmm?

1645
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:57,289
What the fuck?

1646
01:25:57,323 --> 01:25:58,457
What the fuck, what?

1647
01:25:58,492 --> 01:25:59,627
Oh, shit.

1648
01:25:59,661 --> 01:26:01,628
Your face...

1649
01:26:01,662 --> 01:26:04,230
Oh, shit! I'll blow
his fucking head off, man!

1650
01:26:04,264 --> 01:26:06,634
Don't fucking move!

1651
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:07,969
Olivia, take the girls and go.

1652
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:09,469
What's the plan here, Nick?

1653
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:11,872
You get the girls
out of here alive!

1654
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:13,875
No, we can't just
leave him here.

1655
01:26:13,908 --> 01:26:15,375
Addy, go with your mom!

1656
01:26:15,408 --> 01:26:16,443
Hey! Just go. Go!

1657
01:26:16,475 --> 01:26:17,912
Come on.

1658
01:26:17,944 --> 01:26:19,881
Just run, Addy.

1659
01:26:21,381 --> 01:26:23,449
You like that? Huh?

1660
01:26:23,483 --> 01:26:24,985
Oh, my God. Nick fucking Cage.

1661
01:26:25,019 --> 01:26:26,854
Nick motherfucking Cage!

1662
01:26:26,887 --> 01:26:28,722
Don't even think about it!

1663
01:26:32,324 --> 01:26:33,627
Okay, this way. Come on.

1664
01:26:35,295 --> 01:26:36,296
Come on.

1665
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:40,534
Now, go!

1666
01:26:40,568 --> 01:26:41,836
Wait!

1667
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:42,904
Where's Nick?

1668
01:26:42,936 --> 01:26:44,971
He's got a gun on Lucas.

1669
01:26:45,006 --> 01:26:46,841
He bought us some
time, but there's others.

1670
01:26:46,873 --> 01:26:48,909
He will never make
it out of there alive.

1671
01:26:53,814 --> 01:26:55,882
Here's what I know, Nick Cage.

1672
01:26:55,917 --> 01:27:00,787
I've got four guys with guns
pointed directly at your head.

1673
01:27:00,822 --> 01:27:04,356
Yeah, that's true. But
here's what I know.

1674
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:05,960
My family's safe.

1675
01:27:05,993 --> 01:27:07,194
And that's all that matters.

1676
01:27:10,797 --> 01:27:12,498
Hey!

1677
01:27:12,533 --> 01:27:13,967
There he is.

1678
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:15,737
There he fucking is!

1679
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:17,505
The American hero.

1680
01:27:17,904 --> 01:27:19,405
Oh!

1681
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:22,475
The fucking star
of Hollywood, eh?

1682
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:26,046
Ooh, whoa. Come
on. What is this?

1683
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:28,649
And this nose, yeah?

1684
01:27:28,682 --> 01:27:29,984
Don't fucking move!

1685
01:27:30,016 --> 01:27:32,385
Jesus Christ! This
fucking guy again.

1686
01:27:32,418 --> 01:27:33,453
Carlos.

1687
01:27:35,021 --> 01:27:37,057
Carlos, please. You
don't wanna do this to me.

1688
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:38,760
You don't wanna do this to Javi.

1689
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:41,561
He's been nothing
but good to you.

1690
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:42,729
Javi is about to die.

1691
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:45,465
As are you.

1692
01:27:45,498 --> 01:27:46,967
Shit!

1693
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:49,537
Anything you'd like
to say before you die?

1694
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:54,407
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain"

1695
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:55,719
"to send a message to the body."

1696
01:27:55,743 --> 01:27:57,744
"So, by the time
your bullets hit me,"

1697
01:27:57,779 --> 01:28:00,680
"my cerebral cortex will
be transmittin' a signal"

1698
01:28:00,715 --> 01:28:02,582
"to the 17 healthy muscles"

1699
01:28:02,617 --> 01:28:05,552
"that operate
my trigger finger."

1700
01:28:05,586 --> 01:28:08,890
"And before your asshole
has a chance to pucker up,"

1701
01:28:08,922 --> 01:28:11,358
"your medulla oblongata
will be splattered"

1702
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:14,493
"all over the fucking
wall behind ya!"

1703
01:28:14,529 --> 01:28:16,963
"And if that's the last
thing I accomplish"

1704
01:28:16,997 --> 01:28:18,932
"on this beautiful green Earth,"

1705
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:21,903
"well, then, ha, I say, ha..."

1706
01:28:21,935 --> 01:28:24,505
"what a way to fucking go."

1707
01:28:27,574 --> 01:28:28,643
Hey!

1708
01:28:31,578 --> 01:28:33,581
Shit, come on! Nick, go! Go!

1709
01:28:39,086 --> 01:28:40,453
Did we kill him?

1710
01:28:45,626 --> 01:28:47,359
Shit!

1711
01:28:47,394 --> 01:28:49,630
You're dead.

1712
01:28:49,663 --> 01:28:50,997
All of you!

1713
01:29:00,507 --> 01:29:01,943
Nicolas Cage?

1714
01:29:04,578 --> 01:29:06,581
That's fucking cool.

1715
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:13,087
Addy... Addy, did
he... Did he hurt you?

1716
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:14,721
Better not have. No.

1717
01:29:14,755 --> 01:29:16,157
Are you hungry? No.

1718
01:29:16,189 --> 01:29:18,826
Javi has apples. You want
a McIntosh? Honeycrisp?

1719
01:29:18,859 --> 01:29:20,426
No apples, Nick.

1720
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,427
Dad, just please,
watch the road. Please!

1721
01:29:21,461 --> 01:29:22,729
Oh, shit!

1722
01:29:28,636 --> 01:29:29,970
Oh, shit!

1723
01:29:31,005 --> 01:29:32,006
Oh.

1724
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:39,789
Olivia, hand me the
guns. They're right in there.

1725
01:29:39,814 --> 01:29:41,047
What are you doing?

1726
01:29:41,748 --> 01:29:43,149
No.

1727
01:29:43,184 --> 01:29:44,460
Okay, stop the truck.
I will slow them down.

1728
01:29:44,484 --> 01:29:45,819
No way! Yes.

1729
01:29:45,853 --> 01:29:47,487
You are two kilometers
from the embassy.

1730
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,664
If I slow them down,
then you will all make it.

1731
01:29:48,689 --> 01:29:49,733
Javi, I can get us there.
- No!

1732
01:29:49,756 --> 01:29:50,917
Just stay in the truck! Javs!

1733
01:29:54,761 --> 01:29:55,796
No!

1734
01:29:55,829 --> 01:29:57,497
Just get in the car, Javi!

1735
01:30:01,101 --> 01:30:02,636
I'm never gonna
have any kind of a life

1736
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,838
unless I stand up to my cousin!

1737
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,807
I need this.

1738
01:30:08,975 --> 01:30:10,043
Now, go.

1739
01:30:11,578 --> 01:30:12,579
Go!

1740
01:30:21,122 --> 01:30:22,122
You stayed.

1741
01:30:22,856 --> 01:30:23,990
Of course.

1742
01:31:01,228 --> 01:31:03,596
Don't worry, Addy.
Everyone's gonna be okay.

1743
01:31:03,631 --> 01:31:05,065
How's Maria doing? She's okay.

1744
01:31:05,099 --> 01:31:06,266
Dad, please go faster.

1745
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,501
Yeah. Take this left here.

1746
01:31:23,617 --> 01:31:24,784
Shit!

1747
01:31:31,993 --> 01:31:34,127
Oh!

1748
01:31:36,863 --> 01:31:38,666
Oh!

1749
01:31:48,341 --> 01:31:51,578
Did we lose 'em?
I think we lost 'em.

1750
01:31:51,612 --> 01:31:53,180
Dad, watch out! OLIVIA: Oh!

1751
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:01,521
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

1752
01:32:23,778 --> 01:32:26,046
I'm gonna kill you,
Nick fucking Cage!

1753
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:30,618
Get down! Everybody get down!

1754
01:32:35,088 --> 01:32:36,122
Hold on!

1755
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:54,809
What just happened?

1756
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:57,144
Addy?

1757
01:32:57,177 --> 01:32:58,345
Come out! Gun!

1758
01:32:58,378 --> 01:32:59,613
Come on!

1759
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:05,719
Don't you move!

1760
01:33:07,787 --> 01:33:11,125
Get back! Get back!

1761
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:12,626
Come near me and
I'm gonna kill him.

1762
01:33:12,659 --> 01:33:13,860
Addy?

1763
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:17,097
Dad!

1764
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:31,244
We made it, Nick.

1765
01:33:34,814 --> 01:33:36,082
We made it.

1766
01:33:37,818 --> 01:33:38,953
All of us.

1767
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:43,923
I love you, Daddy.

1768
01:34:35,309 --> 01:34:37,444
"I love you, Daddy"?

1769
01:34:37,478 --> 01:34:39,113
Javi wrote that. Okay.

1770
01:34:39,913 --> 01:34:41,481
Congratulations.

1771
01:34:41,515 --> 01:34:42,850
Thanks, Olivia.

1772
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:47,453
We're back.

1773
01:34:47,488 --> 01:34:49,088
Not that we went anywhere.

1774
01:34:49,122 --> 01:34:50,390
Not that we went anywhere.

1775
01:35:01,502 --> 01:35:03,103
Thanks. Oh, thanks.

1776
01:35:06,372 --> 01:35:08,042
Nick.

1777
01:35:08,074 --> 01:35:09,475
Javi, I've been looking for you.

1778
01:35:09,511 --> 01:35:11,045
I was wondering where you went.

1779
01:35:11,078 --> 01:35:13,314
Oh, no, I couldn't
watch. I was, uh...

1780
01:35:13,346 --> 01:35:15,216
I was too nervous.

1781
01:35:15,248 --> 01:35:16,417
How did it play?

1782
01:35:16,449 --> 01:35:19,019
They loved it. Congratulations.

1783
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:20,386
Really? Yeah.

1784
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:21,921
Oh, wow!

1785
01:35:22,989 --> 01:35:24,324
This is...

1786
01:35:24,358 --> 01:35:25,359
Nick...

1787
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:27,529
Thank you.

1788
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:29,963
Javi, we did this
together. Thank you.

1789
01:35:29,997 --> 01:35:31,998
Do you wanna ride
to the party with me?

1790
01:35:32,032 --> 01:35:34,902
They want to interview
us. Uh, <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

1791
01:35:37,871 --> 01:35:39,974
Yeah, no, I can't
tonight. But you go.

1792
01:35:40,006 --> 01:35:42,376
Have fun. Enjoy this.

1793
01:35:42,408 --> 01:35:44,244
And give Gabriela my love.

1794
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:51,519
Addy wants to borrow your belt.

1795
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,020
Oh, yeah, I do.

1796
01:35:53,052 --> 01:35:55,055
It looks like it's
got some weight.

1797
01:35:55,088 --> 01:35:57,390
Well, yeah, it's a
big, fat tarantula.

1798
01:35:57,423 --> 01:35:59,059
You know my dresser, Jeff.

1799
01:35:59,092 --> 01:36:00,261
Mr. Neiman Marcus? Yes.

1800
01:36:00,293 --> 01:36:01,929
He wanted me to wear a bee.

1801
01:36:01,962 --> 01:36:03,831
And I said, "Jeff, not
the bees. Not the bees"

1802
01:36:03,863 --> 01:36:05,375
So, he said, "Well, how
about a scorpion?" I said,

1803
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:06,909
"I think a scorpion is a
little aggressive, Jeff."

1804
01:36:06,934 --> 01:36:08,068
"What about a tarantula?"

1805
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:09,369
He goes, "Well, I don't think"

1806
01:36:09,403 --> 01:36:10,581
"that's any less
aggressive, Nick."

1807
01:36:10,604 --> 01:36:11,845
And I say, "Well, it is to me."

1808
01:36:11,872 --> 01:36:12,916
They're cute and fuzzy, right?

1809
01:36:12,939 --> 01:36:14,050
Well, Addy wants to borrow it.

1810
01:36:14,073 --> 01:36:15,577
Not at all.

1811
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:17,344
You can have it. It's yours.

1812
01:36:17,377 --> 01:36:19,880
Are you sure you didn't
need to stay at the premiere?

1813
01:36:19,912 --> 01:36:21,981
Hundred percent. Yeah?

1814
01:36:22,015 --> 01:36:23,158
Who chose Demi
Moore to play Mom?

1815
01:36:23,182 --> 01:36:24,952
Studio.

1816
01:36:24,984 --> 01:36:27,220
But it doesn't really do
your mother justice, does it?

1817
01:36:27,253 --> 01:36:28,421
Oh, come on.

1818
01:36:28,454 --> 01:36:29,556
She's gorgeous.

1819
01:36:29,591 --> 01:36:30,957
So are you, Olivia.

1820
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:33,226
Ew, Dad, stop hitting on Mom.

1821
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:34,927
I'm not hitting on her.

1822
01:36:34,962 --> 01:36:37,363
Oh, gross. I don't wanna
listen to this anymore.

1823
01:36:37,398 --> 01:36:39,432
You know what? What do
you say we watch a movie?

1824
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:41,435
Yeah, whatever you want, Dad.

1825
01:36:41,467 --> 01:36:42,935
No, really. You choose.

1826
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:45,471
Really?

1827
01:36:45,506 --> 01:36:47,509
Yeah, show us
something you like.

1828
01:36:47,542 --> 01:36:49,143
This is...

1829
01:36:49,176 --> 01:36:51,345
Have you ever seen <i>Paddington 2?</i>

1830
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:39,059
<i>You're Nick</i>

1831
01:37:39,092 --> 01:37:41,362
<i>fucking...</i>

1832
01:37:47,601 --> 01:37:49,403
<i>Whoa! Cage!</i>
