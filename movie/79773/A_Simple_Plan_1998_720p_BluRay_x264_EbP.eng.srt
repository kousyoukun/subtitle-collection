1
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,578
<i>When I was still just a kid,</i>

2
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,328
<i>I remember my father telling me</i>

3
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,969
<i>what he thought that it took
for a man to be happy.</i>

4
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:58,124
Tommy, finally! Come on, man,
New Year's is tonight.

5
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,921
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Don't worry. I covered for you.

6
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:01,821
Thanks, Hank.

7
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:03,836
What, did you stay out
till they hung the last dog?

8
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:05,072
- Yeah.
- Ha!

9
00:03:05,307 --> 00:03:07,016
<i>Simple things, really...</i>

10
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,801
<i>A wife he loves,</i>

11
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:12,892
<i>a decent job,</i>

12
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:17,061
<i>friends and neighbors
who like and respect him.</i>

13
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,739
<i>And for a while there,</i>

14
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,026
<i>without hardly even realizing it,</i>

15
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,536
<i>I had all that.</i>

16
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,784
<i>I was a happy man.</i>

17
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,040
Hey, tom.

18
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,421
Remember we talked about
me getting off early today?

19
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:43,645
Hey, Hank!

20
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:45,890
Hey, Happy New Year, Schmitt!

21
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:51,275
- Hey, Linda, Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

22
00:03:51,443 --> 00:03:53,151
- Hey, where you guys going?
- Sledding!

23
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:55,355
- Hey, can I come?
- No!

24
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:57,184
Ohh... Please! Ohh!

25
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,707
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, happy new year, Hank.

26
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,965
You gotta start charging people for that.

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,333
Ha ha ha! Yeah, it'd pay better
than the county does.

28
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,656
Honey, it's me.

29
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:41,031
- How you feelin' today?
- Hey. Good.

30
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,995
- Oh, my gosh.
- He was sure kickin' a lot today.

31
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,293
Uh-oh...

32
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:04,063
Looks like it's gonna be
a long afternoon for you.

33
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,858
He brought Lou along.

34
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:07,351
Oh, great.

35
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:11,112
Yeah. I'll just be lyin' here, relaxing.

36
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:12,566
- Oh...
- Ha ha ha!

37
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:17,278
Hey, Jacob!

38
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,439
Ha ha ha!

39
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:31,147
What's he doing here?

40
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:33,348
He needed a ride home.

41
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:34,555
Little out of the way, isn't it?

42
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:38,355
We can drop him off when we're done,
you know. It's no big deal, Hank.

43
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,000
What's the big deal, Hank?

44
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,084
Hey, you know, you need to shovel this shit
off of your, uh... whatcha-call-it deal there.

45
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:48,165
I'll pay you a quarter to do it.

46
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,249
Huh! I could use it.

47
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:52,585
Ha ha! Look at Lou.

48
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,433
Here, hold this, will you?

49
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:03,149
- Wanna put it back there?
- No, no, it's gonna wilt.

50
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:05,692
Hank, say hi to...
You didn't say hi to Mary Beth.

51
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:06,605
Oh, yeah.
Hi, Mary Beth!

52
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:08,331
He said hi, Mary Beth.

53
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,716
Hank said hi.
Hi, Lou.

54
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:10,967
Come here.

55
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:49,613
Somebody else was here.

56
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:52,079
Oh, I brought those.

57
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:54,614
When?

58
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:57,909
Well... What the hell do you think, Hank?

59
00:06:57,944 --> 00:07:00,545
This is the only day we can come here?

60
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,876
What the hell's wrong with you?

61
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:07,969
Hey, Jacob! Look!
I'm writing my name!

62
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:11,640
Hang on a second!
Let me get Mrs. Johnson out here!

63
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:13,270
I'll help you out.

64
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,150
You know what the guy says?

65
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,580
Says it's the crock pot
or, uh, crock box?

66
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:48,082
No, no. Pay attention now...
Oh, no, that's the preacher, see?

67
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:48,330
- This is the cowboy.
- Yeah, he says "moo."

68
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:52,421
No, no. It's the guy standing
by the road. He says:

69
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:55,587
"Why, officer? It's just a pine apple."

70
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:57,006
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha!

71
00:07:57,313 --> 00:07:58,712
- You get it?
- Yeah.

72
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:02,139
Well, Mr. accountant doesn't get it.

73
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:03,061
Ha ha ha ha...

74
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:04,937
Look out!

75
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,918
Shit!

76
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:10,462
You ok, baby?

77
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:12,185
Go on, get out!

78
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:15,073
Look at that, man!

79
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,107
My truck.

80
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:19,950
Come on, get out.

81
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:21,614
Mary Beth!

82
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:28,244
- She's gonna come back.
- Hey, what are you doing?

83
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:30,665
- It's a nature preserve, you know that.
- So what?

84
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,714
So you can't hunt here.
Come on, put the gun back.

85
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,465
But it... but it messed up my truck.

86
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,400
- So what? Come on.
- Hey, hey, Hank...

87
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,843
It's not like we're huntin' here, uh-uh.

88
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,648
- We're collectin' the dead.
- That's right.

89
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,024
We're collecting the dead.

90
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,544
- Just look at him...
- He runs like my wife.

91
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:12,204
Hey, come on, wait up!
Come on, I'm not dressed for this shit!

92
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,546
Mary Beth!

93
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,529
Jesus! Look at all them birds!

94
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:36,655
Those things are always waitin' on
something to die so they can eat it, right?

95
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,499
What a weird job.

96
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,106
Wish we had something to drink.

97
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:02,986
Always be prepared.

98
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,942
Oh, that's a good idea.
Let's all start drinking now.

99
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:08,074
See there?
See how he is?

100
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:13,906
Wonk! Dit-dit...
Like that guy, huh?

101
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:16,006
Remember? Wonk! Dit-dit.
- Uh-huh.

102
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:18,372
- You want some?
- I'm not thirsty.

103
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,670
What, you don't drink till after 5:00?

104
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:22,130
After 5:00, heh heh.

105
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:24,407
Or maybe you just don't wanna share.

106
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,710
You're afraid you'll catch
something from us, huh?

107
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,872
Yeah...

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,493
Hey, Hank!

109
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:32,724
Hey! Come on, what are you doing?
Quit jackin' around.

110
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:34,579
Now, you see...

111
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:38,005
That's what you might call
an "insinuating" throw.

112
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:39,357
Remember?

113
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,566
You said that to me last time I saw you.

114
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,493
Could've just said "hint".
But no, you had to put on airs.

115
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:50,329
Show us all them fancy words you know.

116
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,328
What, do you sit around,
you think about this stuff?

117
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,239
When was that, two months ago?

118
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,215
Kiss my ass.

119
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:01,502
What the hell is it?

120
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:15,731
- Jesus Christ.
- Shit, that's a airplane.

121
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:22,779
You know what, it's probably
one of those drunk doctors.

122
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:22,814
They're always crashing
their plane, you know?

123
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:27,113
Yeah, it must've come down right there.
See all them broken trees, Jake?

124
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,620
It's too dark. I can't see.

125
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:31,833
Scrape some of that snow
off the windshield!

126
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:35,753
Can't see a damn thing.

127
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:39,043
Door's stuck.

128
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:41,096
Probably a singer or something.

129
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,773
Still can't see nothin' here.

130
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:59,982
Still can't see anything.
Can't see a damn thing.

131
00:12:00,036 --> 00:12:01,579
I see the pilot!

132
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:05,233
What's he talking about?

133
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,540
Said somebody's in there.

134
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,372
Are you ok?

135
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:15,554
Hey. Hey, buddy...

136
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:17,535
Aah! Whoaaa...

137
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:20,871
Ah! Aah! Aah!

138
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,226
Hey, get... get off!

139
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:24,728
What the hell is going on..?

140
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:26,709
Aah! Ohh!

141
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:28,688
Oh, God!

142
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:29,732
Shit!

143
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:32,524
Hey, lemme outta here.

144
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:40,698
- Good grief, Hank.
- Let me get this off of him. Here...

145
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,923
Hank, did you... did you...
Did you see all them birds?

146
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,130
Did I "see the birds"?!

147
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:55,800
Come on, help me get outta here.

148
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:04,816
- Hank, put that on your eye.
- Thanks.

149
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,518
- You tore your coat, you know.
- Oh, my God!

150
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,608
Oh, my God! Look at this!

151
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:12,289
Shit!

152
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,210
Oh, my God!

153
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:15,409
How much you think is in here?

154
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:19,371
God almighty! These are $100 bills!
The whole bag's full of 'em!

155
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,413
Is this... is it real money, Lou?

156
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,423
Oh, hell, yes, it's real.
Don't be stupid.

157
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:28,002
Why would somebody be flying
around with this kind of cash?

158
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:29,640
You know what? I bet
it's drug money.

159
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,552
That's probably
I bet you're what it is. Right.

160
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:32,403
This guy's a dope dealer

161
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,220
because that's what they do.

162
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:35,931
They fly around in
these little planes.

163
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:38,310
- I guaran-damn-tee you, this is dirty money.
- That's right. I saw it on 20/20.

164
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:41,734
"Dirty money"? What do you mean?
Are you telling me it's counterfeit?

165
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, no.
No, this is real.

166
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:48,192
Whatever it is, it's a police matter now.
What do you think we should do?

167
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,534
Somebody should stay here,
somebody should go after the cops?

168
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,701
- How you wanna Work it?
- What? Let's think this through.

169
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,383
- What?
- Hold on!

170
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,788
What if we didn't turn it in?

171
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,926
You wanna keep it?

172
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,000
Ha ha ha! He wants to keep it...
Well, that's a hot one!

173
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,329
Why wouldn't we?

174
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,713
- Why wouldn't we?
- Yeah.

175
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,358
- Because we'd go to prison!
- Why?

176
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:14,015
Why? Because it's stealing.

177
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:15,973
"Stealing"...
Stealing from who?

178
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:19,399
From him? Hell, he won't mind!

179
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:19,871
Ha ha ha...

180
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:22,309
Oh, 'cause he's dead, right?

181
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:25,698
Ha ha! That's pretty funny...
He's dead, he won't mind.

182
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:29,951
I say we take this bag back to the truck,
and we pretend like we were never here.

183
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:31,036
Fuck yeah. Why not?

184
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,034
Why not? Because we'd get caught.

185
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:36,461
Aw, hell! I'll tell you what.
Stay the hell out of it then.

186
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,544
You know, we don't need you.
It'd just be more money for us.

187
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,252
Hey, I don't wanna stump you
another fancy word, Lou,

188
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,297
but does the term "accomplice"
mean anything to you?

189
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:46,467
Come on, that's stupid!

190
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:49,258
But, Hank...
Why would we get caught?

191
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:52,436
Because it's a lot of money, Jacob.
Somebody's bound to be looking for it.

192
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,988
When they find that plane
and the money's not in it...

193
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:55,624
- Bullshit!
- No, it's not bullshit!

194
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,036
- They'll come looking for us.
- Bullshit! This is dirty money!

195
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:01,238
And as far as that guy's concerned,
the cops don't even know he exists.

196
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:04,195
Nobody knows about this...

197
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,334
...but us.

198
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,235
See there?

199
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,663
Nobody knows but us.
It's like we came out here on a hike,

200
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,205
and found lost treasure, right?

201
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,703
It's the American dream
in a goddamn gym bag.

202
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,550
He... he just wants
to walk away from it.

203
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,044
You work for the American dream.
You don't steal it.

204
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,802
Then this is even better.

205
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,392
If this guy's a dope dealer, then...
like we're talkin' about...

206
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,082
then that means we're like Robin hood.

207
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,021
Oh, yeah, and I'll tell you what...
You got a beautiful wife at home.

208
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:33,984
You're about to have a baby.

209
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:36,442
I know you ain't pullin' down
that much at the feed mill.

210
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,405
Wouldn't you love to have a piece of this?

211
00:15:39,576 --> 00:15:42,661
Hell, yes, I would.
But we can't just take it.

212
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,367
Hey, what if there's a reward?
Maybe there's a reward, and they'll give...

213
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,368
Maybe there's not!

214
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:49,445
How about this...
I tell you what...

215
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,307
I'll bet you $10,000...
just one of these packets, ...

216
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:54,489
that when they find this plane, ...

217
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:58,002
there's no mention of this money.

218
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,991
Hank, why... why turn it in until we know
whether or not somebody's lookin' for it?

219
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,484
That's right.

220
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:23,739
If you scratch, then don't... don't itch.
If you... if it's...

221
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:27,275
If it's broken, don't fix it.
Right?

222
00:16:27,392 --> 00:16:29,260
Or if you... if... if...
if the... if... if... if...

223
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:32,634
And I know what you mean.

224
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:49,352
Suppose I was the one to keep it?

225
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:52,522
For how long?

226
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,026
Just till spring, till they find the plane.

227
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:57,951
Then what?

228
00:16:58,374 --> 00:17:00,000
Then, if you're right and
nobody mentions the money,

229
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,075
we split it up, and we all leave town.

230
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,957
Why should you get to hold it?

231
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:09,927
That's the only way I'll do it.
Otherwise we can just turn it in right now.

232
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:11,519
So, what, you mean...
You... you...

233
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,799
You don't trust us?
Is that what you mean?

234
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:19,184
That's a lot of money.
I guess I don't.

235
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:20,801
Look, no... no promises.

236
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,950
If somebody comes searching
for the money, I'll burn it.

237
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:25,491
- Hank...
- No, that's the only way I'll do this!

238
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,655
Look, we gotta be agreed on this.

239
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:30,073
That's the deal.
That's the deal.

240
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:32,504
I hold onto it,
we wait till they find the plane.

241
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,286
If nobody mentions it,
we split it up, and we move away.

242
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,225
OK?

243
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,786
I'm in.

244
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:41,416
We count it first.

245
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:46,878
That's probably a good idea.

246
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:50,222
I mean, you know...

247
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,281
Heh heh heh...

248
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,262
- Heh heh...
- Heh heh...

249
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:58,437
This is nuts! Oh, my God!

250
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:02,237
Hey, what you gonna buy, Jakey boy?

251
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,196
I'm gonna buy me a truck.

252
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:07,818
No, fuck that!
Get something classy... Trans Am!

253
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,449
Oh, yeah, in my wildest
fuckin' dreams, a Trans Am.

254
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:13,698
- You could buy a fleet of Trans Ams!
- Mary Beth!

255
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:17,040
Where you been, huh?

256
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:38,976
4,380,000...

257
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:41,858
4,390,000...

258
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:44,892
$4,400,000!

259
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:47,295
Isn't that great?
Listen to that.

260
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:50,790
Look at that shit, man.
Look how square it is.

261
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,331
That is cool, huh?
How much is that apiece?

262
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:54,914
About a million and...

263
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:57,000
- A million and a half?
- Shh!

264
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,000
- Shh!
- What?

265
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,415
You hear that?

266
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,553
Uh-uh.

267
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,283
Oh, shit!

268
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:17,561
Get in the truck, I'll handle this.

269
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,482
Go on! Let's go!
Come on, cover up the money!

270
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:22,279
Jake, get in the truck!
Dummy up! Let's go!

271
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,708
Come on!

272
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:36,338
Hey, Carl.

273
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,257
- Engine trouble, Hank?
- Oh, I wish. Dog trouble.

274
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,673
Jacob's mutt chased
a fox into the woods.

275
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:42,763
She tree it?

276
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:46,054
We thought so, but just when we went
after it, she came running back.

277
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,110
What'd you do to your head there?

278
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:53,690
Oh. God, uh...
Ran into a tree branch.

279
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:59,232
- Your brother still out of work?
- Yeah.

280
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:01,155
- Lou?
- Yeah, him, too.

281
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,496
That's a shame, ain't it?

282
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,331
Well, we probably better be heading back...

283
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:10,795
- Hey, hello, Jacob!
- Hey, Carl, how you doin'?

284
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,294
Good, good.

285
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:15,056
I was beginning to think
you were trying to avoid me.

286
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:16,716
I'm sorry?

287
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:18,965
Well, you sittin' over there in that truck.

288
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:20,849
I thought you was trying to avoid me.

289
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:23,018
No, I was just sittin' in the truck.

290
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:26,258
It's a little cold out here, you know.
Just keepin' warm.

291
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:28,800
Well, we probably better be...

292
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,161
Did you tell him about the plane?

293
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,189
- It sou-sounded like a plane.
- What plane?

294
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,247
What, you heard a plane?

295
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,949
I don't know what he heard.
You know he's always hearing shit.

296
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,249
Maybe you better tell me, Jacob.

297
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,663
No, that's OK.
We're gonna get on home.

298
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,067
- All right.
- All right.

299
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,089
Come on, man!
It's New Year's, let's get outta here!

300
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:52,753
Call me, Carl.
Happy New Year!

301
00:20:52,971 --> 00:20:55,806
- Sure you don't need any help?
- No, we're all set. Thanks.

302
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,592
All right.

303
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:00,096
Goddamn it! I've seen you do
some pretty stupid things, Jacob.

304
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:02,477
But that pretty much takes the cake!

305
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:05,395
- It was my idea.
- Oh, well, that's brilliant, Lou.

306
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,894
Now when they find the plane,
and they realize the money's gone,

307
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:10,112
they'll know right off who took it.

308
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,442
Well, that's... that's what's
cool about it, though.

309
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,155
I mean, we wouldn't tell somebody
if we were the ones that did it.

310
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:19,787
It's not like he said that you actually
saw a plane going down.

311
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:22,202
Just you thought you might've
heard one with engine trouble.

312
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:24,253
You want me to burn the money?!

313
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,590
I am not going to prison over this!

314
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,333
If it looks like there's even the slightest
chance of us getting caught,

315
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:33,380
I swear to God, it's all gonna vanish!
You understand?

316
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:47,638
"It was a pine apple."
Ha ha ha...

317
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:02,289
Oh, God...
This is gonna be fun.

318
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:06,200
Where the hell have you been?!

319
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,072
You always come when I'm finished.
I'm finished, you asshole!

320
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:13,760
Hey, Nancy!

321
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:17,308
Don't... Don't hit...
Don't hit Mary Beth.

322
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:20,182
Remember, nobody knows about this.
That includes Nancy.

323
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:22,655
She's gonna have to find out
about it sooner or later.

324
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,530
She's gonna wonder where all
the money's coming from.

325
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,744
2 hours late!

326
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,644
Stop it!

327
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,982
Tell her when we decide
it's safe to keep it, but not before then.

328
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:31,952
Then the same goes for Sarah.

329
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:34,288
Of course.

330
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:35,959
Damn it!

331
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:40,627
Come on! You promised to shovel
the walk, you lazy son of a bitch!

332
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:42,800
Calm down, baby!
I got a good reason for being late.

333
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:43,899
What?

334
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,127
See you, Lou!

335
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:50,934
You know, I bet he's telling her.

336
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:53,516
That guy can't keep a secret.

337
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,401
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

338
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:10,823
Where you been?

339
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,093
I was starting to get worried about you.

340
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,630
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, that's all right.

341
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,970
Hey!

342
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:24,384
What happened to your head?

343
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,180
- It's OK. It's just a scratch.
- It's all bloody.

344
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:29,808
Can I ask you something?

345
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,310
Yeah, sure.

346
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:34,527
What if you were walking in the woods...

347
00:23:34,695 --> 00:23:35,893
It's not deep.

348
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:38,195
And you found a bag full of money,

349
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:42,995
let's say $4 million...
Would you keep it?

350
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,282
Of course not.
Here, hold that.

351
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,538
How come?

352
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,462
Well, for starters, it'd be stealing.

353
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,916
We were talking about lost money here,
nobody's looking for it.

354
00:23:57,388 --> 00:23:59,795
- $4 million of lost money...
- Yeah.

355
00:24:00,056 --> 00:24:01,635
- that nobody's looking for?
- Yeah.

356
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:05,934
Well, so then whose money is it?

357
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,226
Yours.

358
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,250
Oh!

359
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,291
Ooh!

360
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:15,480
It's my money?
But whose money was it before?

361
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:17,408
A bank robber's.

362
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,411
So then it's the bank's money.

363
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:25,033
All right, it's, uh, a drug dealer's.

364
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,700
Hank.

365
00:24:30,966 --> 00:24:32,600
I mean, this is really silly.

366
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,668
Obviously you want me to say
something in particular.

367
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:37,698
I don't know what it is, but you
want me to agree with you or say

368
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,637
that you're right or something.
But I wouldn't take it.

369
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:42,603
That's just me. I wouldn't.

370
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,404
It's real.

371
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:15,139
If we keep it, we never have to
worry about money again.

372
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,550
But we don't have to worry
about money now, Hank.

373
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,681
You've got a good job.

374
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,601
We don't need it.

375
00:25:23,443 --> 00:25:26,444
Yeah, but nobody gets
hurt by us keeping it.

376
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:33,363
I mean, that's what makes it a crime,
doesn't it? Somebody getting hurt?

377
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:35,702
What makes it a crime
is that it's against the law.

378
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:37,823
It doesn't matter if somebody
gets hurt or if they don't.

379
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,590
- If you get caught, then you go to jail.
- Nobody's gonna get caught.

380
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,150
The money's the only evidence
that we've done anything wrong.

381
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:47,253
We sit on it, we see what happens.

382
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:51,509
If somebody comes searching for it,
then we just burn it and that will be that.

383
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:54,478
There's no risk.
We'll always be in control.

384
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,979
What about Jacob and Lou?

385
00:25:57,148 --> 00:26:00,683
As long as we're handling the money
they have to let us call the shots.

386
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:07,522
It seems... crazy just to give it up.

387
00:26:07,784 --> 00:26:10,323
I mean, before we know if
anybody's searching for it.

388
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,703
This is it.
It ain't champagne, but...

389
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,545
Happy New Year!

390
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:32,556
You have to go back and
return some of the money.

391
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:34,968
What?

392
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:39,601
A lot. Like 500,000.

393
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:44,402
You see, that way when they find the plane
they'll assume nobody's been there yet.

394
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:46,568
It will put us beyond suspicion.

395
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:48,568
No one would walk away
from that much money...

396
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:49,897
Wait a second!

397
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:52,573
We're gonna keep the rest?

398
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,078
You'll have to go in the morning
so when it storms later it'll cover your tracks.

399
00:26:58,258 --> 00:26:59,421
You can't tell Jacob though.

400
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:01,838
What, do you think
he'd go back and take it?

401
00:27:04,097 --> 00:27:05,889
It's... it's just being careful.

402
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:09,091
That's what we have to be from now on.
We have to be careful.

403
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,144
We have to be thinking ahead all the time.

404
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:15,379
OK. OK.

405
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:20,296
OK.

406
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:41,475
Jacob!

407
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:46,683
Jacob, come on, open up!

408
00:27:53,362 --> 00:27:55,745
Hey, I screwed up,
I moved the pilot.

409
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:58,494
Come on, we gotta go put
him back like he was.

410
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:01,446
Come on, I need a lookout.

411
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:20,200
If somebody comes by,
you pretend you're changing the tire.

412
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:26,604
You know, that's not gonna work.

413
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:28,312
What do you mean,
it's not gonna work?

414
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:30,567
Nobody's gonna believe that.
It's not flat.

415
00:28:34,783 --> 00:28:36,361
You're kinda crafty.

416
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:39,740
I observe things.

417
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:43,838
Observe and learn, my friend.
Observe and learn.

418
00:28:52,011 --> 00:28:53,209
That's cool.

419
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:56,956
Jacob, what happened,
she die on you?

420
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:58,856
No, we had a flat.
We had a flat tire.

421
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,800
I fixed it. See?
The new one's on there now.

422
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,126
I took the other one,
the bad one, and put it in the trunk.

423
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,910
It's back there now,
flat as a pancake.

424
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,536
But it's cool now.
Everything's all right.

425
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,847
You see that God damned fox
come by here about 5 minutes ago

426
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,475
heading right on down
to the woods?

427
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,950
No, I didn't see a fox.
I didn't see any fox.

428
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,913
Well, if you'd been standing where
I'm sitting he'd have bit you on the ass.

429
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:36,536
Why don't you stay here?

430
00:30:36,694 --> 00:30:37,736
Hey, Hank!

431
00:30:42,427 --> 00:30:44,586
Don't do anything stupid.

432
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:49,893
Jacob!

433
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,541
Oh, God...

434
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:55,899
Jesus, Jacob, what the fuck?!

435
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:59,104
I... I... I... I hit...
I hit the farmer.

436
00:30:59,613 --> 00:31:02,091
- He was tracking a fox. I... I...
- Dwight!

437
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:04,000
He was gonna go right by the plane.
I had to do something.

438
00:31:04,082 --> 00:31:05,700
I was just trying to help us out.

439
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,536
Just listen... listen to his...
to his heart or something like that.

440
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:10,992
Come on, man, listen.
You gotta do it... you...

441
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:12,701
He's... he's gonna be OK.

442
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,210
Oh, God, Jacob,
I think you killed him.

443
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:18,358
I'm pretty sure he's gonna be OK.
What else was I gonna do?

444
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,551
Oh, God. He's dead.

445
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,843
Oh, Hank, that's not right.

446
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,942
No, we could probably...
We could probably do...

447
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:30,471
We can probably do that CPR deal.

448
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:33,685
And you know, you could do that, uh,
cardiac arrest thing, couldn't you?

449
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,403
We could do something,
goddamn it!

450
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:37,065
Jacob, what the hell you doing?

451
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:38,898
- Stop it!
- Come on!

452
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,353
I'm working CPR!

453
00:31:40,554 --> 00:31:41,655
Goddamn it, stop it!

454
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Come on! Come on!

455
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:46,862
Be still. Let me think.
OK, we can't panic.

456
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,372
Have any cars gone by?

457
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,935
- Uh, cars?
- Cars, cars, come on, think.

458
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,573
While I was in the woods,
you see any cars go by?

459
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:54,374
Why, Hank?

460
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:57,297
Oh, God.

461
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:58,923
All right.

462
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:00,681
We gotta make this look
like it was an accident.

463
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:02,081
- Come on.
- An accident?

464
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,426
Grab his legs.

465
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:09,806
Wait, wait, wait.
We can't do that.

466
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,552
What do you mean we can't do it?

467
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:14,541
Because we're gonna make tracks and
they're gonna see them and follow 'em.

468
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,551
It's gonna be like a
crime scene or something.

469
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,575
We're gonna drive the car
back to the bridge.

470
00:32:18,744 --> 00:32:20,571
I'll put him on the snowmobile
and take him through the park.

471
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:22,418
You gotta get there
ahead of me.

472
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:24,371
So whatever you do,
I don't want you to stop.

473
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:25,723
I want you to just drive
on by then circle back.

474
00:32:25,758 --> 00:32:27,041
I don't want people to
see you sitting there.

475
00:32:27,076 --> 00:32:28,750
- Circle back?
- That's right.

476
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:29,041
That's right.

477
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:30,430
Come on, come on now.

478
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,801
They're not gonna take me away, are they?
I mean, you gotta promise me...

479
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,592
Nobody's gonna take you away,
I promise. But we gotta hurry.

480
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:38,761
It's gonna be OK, right, Hank?

481
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:40,345
Come on, we gotta go.

482
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,100
- You gonna be there, right?
- I'm gonna be there. Now just go!

483
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,437
Go!

484
00:33:22,774 --> 00:33:23,890
Dwight?

485
00:33:26,902 --> 00:33:28,351
Dwight!

486
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,901
Your brother.

487
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:32,826
He hit me.

488
00:33:36,456 --> 00:33:37,620
You call the police.

489
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:42,540
Get the police.

490
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,502
Jacob, what are you doing?
Come on, before anybody sees!

491
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,340
- I'm not gonna do this.
- What?

492
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,137
Well, it's just stupid. I mean, if...
See, if we cover it up

493
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,347
it's just gonna be worse anyhow.
So, you know, I'm... I'm just...

494
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:48,922
Get in the car!

495
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:52,149
I'm just gonna go and pull him out, you know?
We're just gonna tell everybody the truth.

496
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,149
Just gonna tell 'em about the money
and everything and just say that I... that I...

497
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:57,778
- You're gonna leave tracks!
- Wait a minute.

498
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,608
This is my decision!

499
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:01,752
Mine!

500
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:03,198
Not yours!

501
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:10,336
You didn't kill him.

502
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:18,805
We both did.

503
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:22,719
What are you talking about, Hank?

504
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:30,223
He was alive when you left.
I smothered him.

505
00:36:31,821 --> 00:36:34,110
I guess that makes it my decision.

506
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:57,469
It's gonna be OK.
I mean, it looked real.

507
00:36:57,642 --> 00:37:01,971
And even if... I mean, let's say it didn't
look like an accident. Whatever. I mean...

508
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:04,183
Why would anyone think of us?

509
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:06,232
Your tracks lead right to the plane.

510
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:09,987
But it's gonna snow! Any minute now,
it's gonna start snowing.

511
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:11,615
Was there any blood?

512
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:12,906
Blood?

513
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,840
Jacob hit him.
Was there blood anywhere?

514
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:17,230
Did he get blood on anything?
Was there blood on the road or...

515
00:37:17,328 --> 00:37:18,244
I don't remember.

516
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:20,325
- Did you look?
- I looked, but I... I just don't...

517
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:22,540
I mean, it was all hap...

518
00:37:23,713 --> 00:37:27,289
Honey, it's gonna snow. It's gonna snow
and everything's gonna be covered up.

519
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,991
- All the tracks...
- Shh.

520
00:37:30,554 --> 00:37:32,962
<i>He was apparently trying to cross
along this bank of snow.</i>

521
00:37:33,141 --> 00:37:35,809
<i>when his snowmobile slipped over the edge</i>

522
00:37:35,976 --> 00:37:39,511
<i>throwing him into the icy
waters of Anders creek.</i>

523
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:44,767
<i>Wright county deputies recovered the body
shortly before 4:00 this afternoon.</i>

524
00:37:44,945 --> 00:37:49,323
<i>A tragic beginning to this new year
for one local family.</i>

525
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,047
<i>Back to you, Paul.</i>

526
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:52,395
<i>Thanks, Tracy.</i>

527
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:01,750
I wish you hadn't told Jacob.

528
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:05,044
I wish he still thought that he did it.

529
00:38:05,969 --> 00:38:06,799
Does it scare you?

530
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:08,964
Yeah, it scares me.
What if he tells somebody?

531
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:10,135
I mean, what I did.

532
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:13,262
What you did?

533
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,646
Well, I know that you only did it
because you felt trapped.

534
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:18,467
That you couldn't find any other way.

535
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,992
Would you have done the same thing?
I mean, if you'd been there instead of me?

536
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,907
I... I...
I just need to know if it's possible.

537
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,324
Oh, honey!

538
00:38:50,644 --> 00:38:52,476
You listening to me, Hank?

539
00:38:52,544 --> 00:38:56,900
Every Monday I come down here,
buy 2 bags of feed, regular as clock work.

540
00:38:57,193 --> 00:39:02,350
2 bags of wheat, 4 times a month.
That's 8 bags I'm supposed to be billed for.

541
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,152
- I don't know how else to get through to you.
- December started on a Monday, Mr. Schmitt.

542
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,000
So there were 5 mondays in the month.
So you came in here 5...

543
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,453
Are you telling me there were
5 weeks last month?

544
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,579
No, sir, I'm telling you
there were 5 Mondays. Excuse me.

545
00:39:14,838 --> 00:39:15,669
I got it.

546
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,597
Yeah.

547
00:39:16,632 --> 00:39:18,209
<i>Hey, Hank, it's me.</i>

548
00:39:18,717 --> 00:39:20,093
Hang on a second.

549
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:23,051
Listen, check that calendar over there
if you don't believe me, sir.

550
00:39:23,223 --> 00:39:24,302
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

551
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:26,763
Well, I'm a little busy right now, Jacob.
What is it?

552
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:29,225
<i>OK, listen,
can you meet me at the farm?</i>

553
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:31,017
<i>- What farm?
- Our farm.</i>

554
00:39:32,107 --> 00:39:33,851
Look, uh, what is it?

555
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:36,518
<i>On your lunch break.
12:30, OK?</i>

556
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:39,105
Hey, are we straight on this, Mr. Schmitt?

557
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:41,444
Thanks for coming in.

558
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,988
Look, I can't drive out there right...

559
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,188
Jacob?

560
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:10,881
Jacob?

561
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:14,982
Hey, what are you doing here?

562
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,521
Look out!
Ha ha ha ha ha.

563
00:40:17,868 --> 00:40:20,359
- What the hell'd you drag me out here for?
- Listen to this. I'm gonna buy it back.

564
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:24,454
I'm gonna fix it up. I'm gonna rebuild it
just like it was before mom and dad died.

565
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,787
Whoa, whoa. Come on, wait, wait.
We've been through all this.

566
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:31,540
We've been over this. Once we split up
the money, we've gotta leave. We have to go.

567
00:40:33,677 --> 00:40:38,055
What do you... what do you want me to do,
just like that, just drive off by myself?

568
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,600
Well, I mean, suppose you stay...

569
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,583
Where are you gonna tell
people you got the money?

570
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:44,900
Oh, that's easy.

571
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,200
We just tell people that Sarah
inherited some money. It's easy.

572
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,155
You know, nobody around here
knows anything about her family.

573
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:57,986
You guys could've just bought the farm,
you know, and then left me to run it.

574
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:00,571
- It's not gonna work.
- I thought this was gonna make you happy.

575
00:41:00,842 --> 00:41:02,184
Jacob...

576
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,828
Farming? Come on.

577
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:11,165
You don't just buy a farm.
You gotta... you gotta work it.

578
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,925
You gotta know about machinery and seed.

579
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,473
- I know that.
- No, you don't.

580
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:20,242
Fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides,
drainage, irrigation, the weather?

581
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,724
Come on, you don't know
about any of that stuff.

582
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:24,975
You're gonna end up just like dad!

583
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:26,808
Why do you think he ended up like that?

584
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,146
I'll tell you how he ended up like that.

585
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,775
He had 2 mortgages riding on the place.
He couldn't make the payments.

586
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:35,526
- Where do you think the money went?
- He was a bad businessman.

587
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:39,289
Where do you think the money went?
No, you think he spent it all on the farm?

588
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,664
I'll tell you exactly where the money went:
4 years of college, bud!

589
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:46,341
Yeah, or didn't you ever think
about how he paid for that?

590
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:49,213
- Didn't that ever occur to you?
- No, my tuition was...

591
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:51,885
Listen, I'm supposed to get the farm!

592
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:57,635
What do I get?!
I'm supposed to get the farm.

593
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,800
Jacob, you got... you got...
the whole world. You can...

594
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,069
I don't wanna hear that.

595
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,988
You can go anywhere you want.

596
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:18,153
This is what I want.

597
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,661
This is... this is where
I wanna be.

598
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:25,745
It's my home, Hank.

599
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:48,749
Shit.

600
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,248
- Hey, honey.
- What?

601
00:43:07,426 --> 00:43:09,751
I wanna show you something.

602
00:43:12,058 --> 00:43:13,205
- What is it?
- I got this...

603
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,013
I had it sent over
from the other branch.

604
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:17,182
Look, here it is.

605
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,805
"Heiress's body ID'd by feds."

606
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:22,224
"$4.4 million ransom."

607
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:27,444
You see? This person nobody knows
has just disappeared right into thin air.

608
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:30,282
Do you recognize one
of them from the plane?

609
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:31,781
I can't tell.

610
00:43:32,287 --> 00:43:34,078
His face was...

611
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,100
What?

612
00:43:39,257 --> 00:43:40,831
This changes it.

613
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,120
Why is that?

614
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,542
We can't say it isn't stealing anymore.

615
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:50,894
Well, Hank, it's always been stealing.
We just didn't know who we were stealing from.

616
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,203
We thought it was drug money.
We thought it was money that we could find...

617
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:56,875
- No, you thought that. This is good. I'm glad...
- It's good?

618
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,860
Yes, it's good we know where it's from,
because I was starting to get worried.

619
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,689
I thought that it might
be counterfeit or marked.

620
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,856
- It might still be marked.
- No, it says right here.

621
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,114
Look: "denomination in unmarked bills".
Unmarked, you see?

622
00:44:11,748 --> 00:44:15,918
You're just being paranoid, Hank.
It's over. It's good.

623
00:44:16,474 --> 00:44:18,142
Sarah?

624
00:44:18,714 --> 00:44:20,043
Would you come here, please?

625
00:44:20,216 --> 00:44:22,340
Sure. OK, just a second.

626
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:24,260
I'll see you tonight.

627
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,100
Ha ha ha ha ha.

628
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Jesus!

629
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,787
Hey, come on, Hank!
Open up!

630
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,150
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, "Mr. Accountant"!

631
00:45:30,165 --> 00:45:32,000
Well, I've come to make a tiny withdrawal.

632
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,000
Go home.
Turn around and go home right now.

633
00:45:34,142 --> 00:45:37,550
- Oh, come on! It's freezing out here, Hank!
- Shh! Keep it down!

634
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:39,381
All right, just for a second.

635
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:45,845
I don't have time for this shit.
I gotta get up and go to work.

636
00:45:46,605 --> 00:45:48,065
I want my share.

637
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,269
What?

638
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,559
I do. I want my share.

639
00:45:53,238 --> 00:45:56,400
I don't have the money here,
and even if I did, I wouldn't give you any.

640
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,600
Oh, come on, now.

641
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,483
Look, just because you have it
doesn't mean it's yours.

642
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:03,161
Part of that is my money.

643
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,367
Part of it might be your money...

644
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:09,169
If we decide to keep it.

645
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:12,251
The plan was to sit on the money
till we decide that it's safe to keep it.

646
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,950
- Why are you coming over here with this shit?
- All right, look. I'll tell you what.

647
00:46:15,054 --> 00:46:18,138
Just give me one packet, OK?

648
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:23,220
Just one packet.
And I'll come back later for the rest.

649
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,024
Ask me again, and I'll go
burn it tomorrow morning.

650
00:46:28,402 --> 00:46:29,731
Is that clear?

651
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:33,491
It's a bluff.

652
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:34,739
What?

653
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:38,435
Yeah, it's a bluff!
B-L-U-F-F.

654
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:42,080
Oh, then why don't you call it then
and just see what happens?

655
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:44,257
- Yeah.
- All right. OK.

656
00:46:45,046 --> 00:46:48,545
See, Jacob told me a little secret,
"Mr. Accountant".

657
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,545
I know what happened to Dwight Stephanson.

658
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,435
You drank too much.

659
00:46:59,605 --> 00:47:01,597
I want one of those packets!

660
00:47:03,526 --> 00:47:08,000
I told you, I don't have the money here.
I hid it away from the house.

661
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,950
Mm-hmm. Well, you know what?
It'd be a shame if somebody was to

662
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,340
drop a note to Carl Jenkins saying

663
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:18,960
there might just be a little something
suspicious about Dwight Stephanson's accident.

664
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:22,951
He just drove off that bridge?
Do you believe that? Do you?!

665
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,088
Come on. Jesus, Lou!

666
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:28,171
Remember, you're a thief, too.

667
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:32,302
We're all in this together.
If one of us goes to jail, we all do.

668
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,382
Oh, God.

669
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:52,487
I need my share, Hank.

670
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:54,405
I do.

671
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,294
I'm broke...

672
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:00,337
And I owe people money.

673
00:48:03,546 --> 00:48:07,190
- Christ, Lou, I mean wh-wh...
- I need some help here, man.

674
00:48:09,516 --> 00:48:11,095
OK, just wait here.

675
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:29,916
Here, here.

676
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:32,365
40 dollars?

677
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:34,411
Shh! That's all I got.

678
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:37,795
Maybe I can go to the bank
and get you a loan out of our savings.

679
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:42,169
Look, look, look.
The money's a day's drive from here.

680
00:48:42,345 --> 00:48:45,263
Even if I wanted go get it, I can't go get it,
not till Sarah has the baby.

681
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:46,463
A day's drive?!

682
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:51,093
Yeah, that's right. I put it in a storage locker
above the interstate.

683
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:55,925
- What the hell is it doing in a storage...
- Shh! It's safe. Don't worry, all right?

684
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:58,559
I didn't want it near us in case
we come under any suspicion.

685
00:48:58,731 --> 00:49:01,056
- How the hell's that gonna happen?
- How's that gonna happen?

686
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:04,819
How about Carl knowing about
the plane, huh? Who's idea was that?

687
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:08,948
Yeah.

688
00:49:09,105 --> 00:49:10,148
All right.

689
00:49:11,953 --> 00:49:17,861
But we go get it as soon as she's done,
split it up right there...

690
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,494
Right?

691
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:24,451
Yeah.

692
00:49:31,853 --> 00:49:33,000
Hank...

693
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:39,234
# Skippy and Buddy...
# Skippy and Buddy...

694
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:46,211
Hey, I said whoa.

695
00:49:46,399 --> 00:49:50,611
I'm looking for Hank and Sarah.
I'm sorry.

696
00:49:53,735 --> 00:49:55,063
Oh, God, look at this.

697
00:49:57,213 --> 00:50:00,001
Do you have a car seat in the car
you'll be traveling home in?

698
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:01,795
Is it currently installed?

699
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:03,594
Hello, look who's here!

700
00:50:04,888 --> 00:50:07,925
Bearing tidings and gifts and great joy.

701
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,263
Would you sign here?

702
00:50:09,685 --> 00:50:11,457
Sure.

703
00:50:11,813 --> 00:50:13,687
What do you mean "gambling"?
Where?

704
00:50:13,857 --> 00:50:15,399
At the casino. He lost some money.

705
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:17,856
- How much?
- I don't know how much.

706
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,172
Shh!

707
00:50:19,238 --> 00:50:21,019
- Hey, congratulations!
- Thank you.

708
00:50:21,464 --> 00:50:22,956
Did you see that little baby?

709
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:24,449
It looked like a little tomato.

710
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:27,905
How could you have told him that, huh?

711
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:31,910
I put myself out for you.
What do you do, you betray me?

712
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:32,999
What are you talking about?

713
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,207
What am I talking about?
It's like there's two sides now.

714
00:50:36,716 --> 00:50:40,500
Why are you both always talking
about sides? There's no sides.

715
00:50:40,678 --> 00:50:42,054
Who's talking about sides?

716
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:46,057
I'm on both of your sides.
We're all in this together, man.

717
00:50:46,227 --> 00:50:49,562
If you had to pick right now,
who'd it be?

718
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,521
No, I don't...
why would I wanna pick?

719
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,940
No, I wanna know...

720
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,356
Me or Lou?

721
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:07,789
Good grief, man. I...

722
00:51:09,461 --> 00:51:11,455
I'd pick you.
You're my brother.

723
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:31,903
I bou... I bought
a present for the baby.

724
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:38,566
OK... OK, I... I brought it from the house.
I didn't buy it, but, look, it's...

725
00:51:39,912 --> 00:51:41,914
It's kinda cool.
Just trust me on this one.

726
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,874
You're gonna like it, I think,
when you see what it is.

727
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:54,467
Thanks.

728
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,813
- God, it's used.
- Let me see that.

729
00:52:08,403 --> 00:52:10,362
Oh, my gosh, this was his...

730
00:52:10,655 --> 00:52:12,280
when we were kids.

731
00:52:13,284 --> 00:52:14,943
Oh, I guess it's sweet
of him then, isn't it?

732
00:52:15,118 --> 00:52:16,613
Buddy the bear.

733
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:18,532
Here's your little girl.

734
00:52:22,502 --> 00:52:23,761
Oh, good, good, good.

735
00:52:24,671 --> 00:52:27,756
Got her?
She's just about ready for her feeding.

736
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,963
Would you grab that thing?

737
00:52:29,998 --> 00:52:32,002
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

738
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,966
Hello, little girl.

739
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:38,166
Hello.

740
00:52:39,104 --> 00:52:40,433
She's hungry.

741
00:52:48,156 --> 00:52:50,778
I want you to buy one of
those little tape recorders.

742
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:53,821
You know, the little dictating kind,
the kind you can hide in your pocket?

743
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,360
Why do you want a tape recorder?

744
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:57,955
You're gonna tape Lou
confessing to Stephanson's murder.

745
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:00,125
What?
What are you talking about?

746
00:53:06,635 --> 00:53:10,633
You and Jacob invite him out for drinks.
Get him drunk.

747
00:53:11,266 --> 00:53:13,222
You take him back to his place.

748
00:53:13,392 --> 00:53:17,477
Then you start joking around,
kidding about confessing to the police.

749
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,016
Each of you takes a turn
pretending how you'd do it.

750
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:21,937
You go first,

751
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:26,751
Jacob second, and Lou last.
And when Lou goes, you tape him.

752
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:29,607
Come on, that's not gonna work.

753
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:32,263
Jacob helps you.
That's the key.

754
00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:34,996
If Jacob eggs him on, he'll do it.

755
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:39,379
Yeah, but even if he, you know, even if he
talks on the tape, it won't mean anything.

756
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:41,504
I mean, who's ever gonna believe it?

757
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:45,716
Well, it doesn't matter
as long as Lou believes it,

758
00:53:46,096 --> 00:53:48,718
as long as he sees that
Jacob's taking your side.

759
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,094
That's all you want.

760
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,394
We should at least try,
shouldn't we?

761
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:59,058
We can't lose anything by trying...

762
00:54:00,058 --> 00:54:01,457
Right?

763
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:04,558
Come on, it's not like
I'm asking you to do that much.

764
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,278
Here, just pick up the phone
and give him a call and say:

765
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,200
"Hey, Lou, Hank suggested we go out
drinking." tomorrow night."

766
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:11,248
Hank suggested we go out drinking?
What are talking about?

767
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:12,581
- Will you let me finish?
- We suggest we go out drinking.

768
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,420
- You don't ever suggest we go out drinking.
- I'm getting to that. Let me finish.

769
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,000
I'm saying:

770
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,206
Tell him I've agreed to split up the money.

771
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:22,420
I thought it'd be a good idea for us to...
to go out and celebrate first.

772
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:25,638
So you want me to trick him?
You want me to trick Lou?

773
00:54:25,673 --> 00:54:26,765
You want me to trick my friend?
OK.

774
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:28,600
Do you get what's happening here?

775
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,139
Do you understand the seriousness
of the situation we're in?

776
00:54:31,314 --> 00:54:34,648
- He can put us both in jail, Jacob.
- He's not gonna send us to jail.

777
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:39,563
Well, I can't take that chance,
not now, not with the baby.

778
00:54:40,783 --> 00:54:42,775
I can't afford to go to prison, Jacob.

779
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:45,236
I mean, wh-what about Sarah, huh?

780
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:47,915
Wh-what are they gonna do?

781
00:54:50,628 --> 00:54:52,627
I'm gonna have to get rid of that
Christmas tree out of here.

782
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:54,379
It's too dry. It's gonna start a fire...

783
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,004
Would you pay attention here?
Pay attention!

784
00:54:57,261 --> 00:54:59,381
- What would dad do?
- I'll think about it.

785
00:54:59,465 --> 00:55:00,465
Don't do that, please, Hank.

786
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,336
Don't you think he'd
want us to stick together?

787
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,895
Don't say that. I mean, you don't
know what the hell dad would do.

788
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:08,225
That's fucked up.
Don't bring him up.

789
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,109
Well...

790
00:55:20,452 --> 00:55:24,285
What if I was to say I'd help you
get the farm back, huh?

791
00:55:28,985 --> 00:55:30,463
All right...

792
00:55:31,507 --> 00:55:33,713
I'll help you buy back the farm.

793
00:55:35,845 --> 00:55:37,838
But you got to help me first.

794
00:55:46,273 --> 00:55:48,979
You know, all I meant by that
about the tree is it's just dried out.

795
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,737
And it could start a fucking fire.
You know how that stuff goes.

796
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,548
It wasn't like I was trying to ignore you
or something like that.

797
00:55:56,618 --> 00:55:59,906
I was just, you know, I was talking about
practical shit to you is all it was.

798
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:16,506
Yeah, we got that white carpet.

799
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:19,876
- Honey?
- Oh. Oh, hey.

800
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,980
Hey, Sarah.

801
00:56:21,023 --> 00:56:22,195
Hey, Jacob.

802
00:56:22,481 --> 00:56:24,936
I take my shoes off for you there, see?

803
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:25,818
Thank you.

804
00:56:26,152 --> 00:56:27,694
Oh, uh...

805
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,363
It's a nice shirt.

806
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,563
Ta-da! Ha ha.

807
00:56:32,451 --> 00:56:34,443
Here, let me do that.

808
00:56:34,744 --> 00:56:36,239
Hey, I gotta pee.

809
00:56:36,413 --> 00:56:37,528
Yeah, go ahead.

810
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:43,003
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

811
00:56:43,255 --> 00:56:46,173
- You brought him here?
- Yeah. I invited him for dinner.

812
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:49,954
Oh! Good.
Good, good.

813
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:53,849
OK...
So he's gonna do it?

814
00:56:56,018 --> 00:56:57,741
I had to promise him the farm.

815
00:56:57,776 --> 00:56:59,950
You what?
Wait, I thought you said...

816
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,359
we agreed that you were
gonna say something.

817
00:57:02,455 --> 00:57:05,283
Where's he supposed to go,
Sarah, huh? I mean...

818
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:08,000
What's he gonna do, drive away?

819
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:11,195
I don't know, honey. I don't know,
but if he stays, we get caught.

820
00:57:12,522 --> 00:57:14,399
I know, I know. It's just...

821
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:16,206
It's just a matter of
time before he screws up.

822
00:57:16,374 --> 00:57:18,866
I know. That's not what I'm saying.
I just...

823
00:57:23,675 --> 00:57:25,714
I just wish he could, that's all.

824
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,591
No, no, you remember what she did?

825
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:37,898
She was so freaked out that she called
the volunteer fire department,

826
00:57:38,066 --> 00:57:39,477
and then, remember,
they came out...

827
00:57:39,651 --> 00:57:41,858
- Oh, yeah, there was all of dad's buddies...
- All his drinkin' buddies.

828
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:43,712
Yeah, yeah.

829
00:57:43,822 --> 00:57:45,400
That's... that's all the volunteer
fire department was,

830
00:57:45,435 --> 00:57:47,654
was guys he knew, you know?
So they show up...

831
00:57:47,702 --> 00:57:50,703
And he's sitting there in the kitchen
with that ice pack on his face.

832
00:57:50,872 --> 00:57:55,701
That's ridiculous. He felt like an idiot,
'cause they're all gathered in there

833
00:57:55,736 --> 00:57:56,914
like there's some huge
murder going down, you know?

834
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,863
Shh, shh.

835
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:07,081
OK.

836
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,927
Well, back on call.

837
00:58:11,646 --> 00:58:13,572
Hey, how about some more wine?
You got a full glass here.

838
00:58:13,648 --> 00:58:16,684
What's it like, a walkie-talkie, Sarah,
kind of like a baby walkie-talkie?

839
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,652
Yeah, yeah.
It's kinda cool.

840
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:21,739
Remember, we had that thing we did
with them little walkie-talkies?

841
00:58:21,908 --> 00:58:24,113
- Oh, yeah.
- You got that kit for Christmas.

842
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:25,573
Remember that?

843
00:58:26,748 --> 00:58:27,790
Yeah.

844
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:29,042
Yeah.

845
00:58:29,332 --> 00:58:32,998
You know, it's weird.
I think... I think about that stuff.

846
00:58:33,033 --> 00:58:33,033
I think it's kinda weird...

847
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,961
You remember everything, too,
don't you?

848
00:58:35,255 --> 00:58:38,506
Well, yeah. I was always...
I was always talking to dad.

849
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:40,999
I know you were.

850
00:58:41,262 --> 00:58:44,139
I was always figuring out
what's going on, you know?

851
00:58:44,175 --> 00:58:46,339
I was always nervous about
shit, you know, I guess.

852
00:58:46,477 --> 00:58:48,386
But I tell you what, he's a...

853
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:54,394
If he... if he had the still
like we got goin' on right now, you know?

854
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:57,028
He would... he would... he
would have done the same thing.

855
00:58:57,197 --> 00:58:59,771
I don't know, I don't know.
I guess so.

856
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,811
I mean, 'cause that's what he...

857
00:59:01,854 --> 00:59:04,278
He always wanted to get
everything set up, you know.

858
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,164
I mean, he always wanted to have enough
to just take care of things and relax, you know.

859
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:09,257
Yeah.

860
00:59:09,396 --> 00:59:13,338
He never quite had that,
so I think he'd done it.

861
00:59:13,373 --> 00:59:14,955
But, uh, I tell you what, he'd still...

862
00:59:15,716 --> 00:59:18,059
I guarantee you, if he'd had this,
he'd still be here.

863
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,639
He'd never have done that.

864
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:25,889
Done what?

865
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:30,146
Killed hisself, you know.
It just wouldn't have happened.

866
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,279
What?

867
00:59:33,405 --> 00:59:35,065
What are you talking about?

868
00:59:35,657 --> 00:59:37,615
Hank, dad killed himself,
you know that?

869
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:41,534
What?
What are you talking about?

870
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:44,578
Come on, what are you talking about?
They were drunk, they had a wreck.

871
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,765
That's out on Jack's spur road.

872
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,750
That's like that ramp is...
Where he went every day?

873
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:52,504
You ain't gonna roll away
on a ramp like that.

874
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:55,679
He'd be on that thing
8,000 times a year, you know.

875
00:59:56,138 --> 00:59:58,808
You think all of a sudden
he forgot his way?

876
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:00,685
Good grief!

877
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:07,000
He figured that, you know,
all that insurance money, it'd be...

878
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:10,990
You know, it'd take care of the whole
deal that he wanted to... you know...

879
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:14,823
- What? No, no. What? Wait...
- You know that, Hank.

880
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:17,529
I mean, think about it.

881
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,050
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
well, maybe I misjudged you, Hank.

882
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:07,000
'Cause, I mean, you're a bit more,
well, I don't know, let's... let's say...

883
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,111
serious... ha ha ha... than a guy like me.
And, you know, maybe sometimes...

884
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:16,000
you can come across like you
sort of got a stick up your ass.

885
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:20,608
I... I... I mean to... someone who
doesn't really know you, to...

886
01:01:20,758 --> 01:01:24,511
to someone who can't get beneath
that first impression.

887
01:01:24,613 --> 01:01:29,105
And, OK, OK, maybe...
Maybe sometimes...

888
01:01:29,243 --> 01:01:34,781
Well... I can come off
a little bit like an asshole.

889
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:35,989
You think?
No, come on.

890
01:01:36,024 --> 01:01:37,162
Yeah. Oh, no, no, no! No.

891
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:40,802
I know what I'm talking about.

892
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:45,054
But fuck it.

893
01:01:46,144 --> 01:01:48,101
It's all in the past, right?

894
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,685
What do you say?

895
01:01:51,234 --> 01:01:53,464
- Come on.
- Sounds good to me.

896
01:01:53,527 --> 01:01:57,135
- Hell, yes. Live and let live.
- Live and let live.

897
01:01:59,409 --> 01:02:01,152
I gotta take a leak.

898
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:08,330
Don't look at me like that.

899
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:10,849
Whoo!

900
01:02:10,884 --> 01:02:11,827
Jerk!

901
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:21,722
What, you think that's funny?

902
01:02:22,422 --> 01:02:24,523
- Ahh!
- Ahh, what, huh?

903
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,803
I'm asking you, you think it's funny tripping
a guy on the way to the fucking can?

904
01:02:26,982 --> 01:02:29,651
- Look, buddy...
- Oh, don't buddy me! What the...

905
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,254
See, that right here is my buddy.
This guy right here is my buddy.

906
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:36,157
You're not my fucking
buddy, huh, you got it?

907
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,410
Come on up here!
Come on up here!

908
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:39,070
I'll kill... come on!

909
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,100
Come on. Come on.

910
01:02:41,214 --> 01:02:43,915
- It's not worth it.
- Come on out here, right out in front!

911
01:02:44,084 --> 01:02:47,454
I'll paint you up and down
the fucking sidewalk, motherfucker!

912
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,706
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, shut the fuck up, Ray!

913
01:02:49,856 --> 01:02:51,168
Get out, asshole!

914
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,797
You know what? You...
You shit in one hand.

915
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,236
You better get the fuck out of here!

916
01:03:10,197 --> 01:03:13,732
So, listen, if you got to pee,
pee out here.

917
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,950
So... so anyway,

918
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,750
this one guy, see, he steps forward
and he says, uh, he says...

919
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,214
"You know what? The guy was OK
until we twisted his head back around,"

920
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:32,137
"and then he just fucking died on us."

921
01:03:32,447 --> 01:03:33,646
You get it?

922
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:37,529
Hey, I got one!

923
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,913
Ah, shit...

924
01:03:38,938 --> 01:03:41,856
This old drunk was telling jokes...

925
01:03:42,024 --> 01:03:44,730
to his 2 drunk friends, ...

926
01:03:44,903 --> 01:03:46,363
and he was keeping up his wife,

927
01:03:46,446 --> 01:03:48,819
who, unlike him, had a job
to go to in the morning.

928
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,203
So, see, she gets so fucking fed up,
she comes downstairs and she says,

929
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:58,574
"if he doesn't shut up, he's gonna have to
find some other place to live rent-free."

930
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:01,995
- Do you get that one?
- No, listen, babe...

931
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:04,207
Hey, baby, come on, now.
We're just drinking.

932
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,665
Come on, what are you waiting for?
I don't want to be here all night.

933
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,300
Let's get this over with.

934
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,287
- I won't do it, Hank.
- What?

935
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,711
It's not fair.

936
01:04:14,385 --> 01:04:15,549
We had a deal.

937
01:04:15,929 --> 01:04:17,340
It's not right.

938
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,300
It's not right.

939
01:04:19,374 --> 01:04:20,721
Ah, dummy up!

940
01:04:22,103 --> 01:04:24,890
Better just keep it down a little bit.

941
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:27,687
- Don't say anything.
- Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

942
01:04:28,192 --> 01:04:29,687
You know how it is.

943
01:04:30,279 --> 01:04:32,687
What the fuck's wrong with you, Hank?

944
01:04:39,789 --> 01:04:42,744
Do you see this?
You see the way this boy drinks?

945
01:04:42,918 --> 01:04:45,456
You see Hank take a
drink of that whiskey?

946
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,105
It's like... it's like...

947
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,407
Ha ha ha ha.

948
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:52,728
Like... like in,
you know, like...

949
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:56,547
Like some kind of commercial...
for preparation of the mouth?

950
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:59,556
Like he lives on Primrose Lane?

951
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,310
You look like some
goddamn bird or something.

952
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,525
You gonna start playing big brother now,
teach me how to drink my whiskey?

953
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,240
Did you ever see anybody
drink like that before?

954
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:19,496
No, to tell you the truth, I don't believe
I've ever seen anybody drink like that before.

955
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:22,377
I don't...
I don't drink like that.

956
01:05:22,412 --> 01:05:24,597
- My dad didn't drink like that.
- Uh-oh.

957
01:05:24,632 --> 01:05:27,419
You know, we don't have one thing
in common, me and him,

958
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:29,752
except maybe our last name.

959
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:32,382
You're more like a brother
to me than he is.

960
01:05:35,068 --> 01:05:36,615
Oh! Ha ha ha.

961
01:05:37,438 --> 01:05:39,596
Do... do him crossing the field.

962
01:05:40,608 --> 01:05:42,482
Ha ha ha ha. Do it!
He won't care.

963
01:05:42,652 --> 01:05:44,894
Come on, you don't care,
do you, Hank, huh?

964
01:05:46,698 --> 01:05:48,094
Crossing the field?

965
01:05:48,494 --> 01:05:49,902
Uh, crossing the field.

966
01:05:50,202 --> 01:05:53,653
Do like you did that night,
the snow, he had...

967
01:05:54,312 --> 01:05:56,680
It's just like, uh, say, what was it?
OK.

968
01:05:58,036 --> 01:05:59,500
And... and...
the way it starts out

969
01:05:59,537 --> 01:06:01,831
like he's walking across, like,
that fucking, like, uh,

970
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,713
like he's a quail or some shit.

971
01:06:05,636 --> 01:06:10,133
"Hey, guys, come on, you know...
Hey, wait up, wait up! Wait for me."

972
01:06:10,808 --> 01:06:12,416
"I... I...
I'm not dressed right."

973
01:06:12,451 --> 01:06:16,036
You're only wearing your
pissy little loafers, you know?

974
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:21,522
Do him when the crow flies out
and pecks him in the head!

975
01:06:21,557 --> 01:06:22,649
That's good.

976
01:06:24,157 --> 01:06:25,273
No, that's fucked up.

977
01:06:25,308 --> 01:06:26,872
It's like...
That was like...

978
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:29,920
You know...

979
01:06:29,955 --> 01:06:31,913
The fucking thing wasn't electric, shit.

980
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,413
You know, we shouldn't
ever let him keep that money.

981
01:06:40,717 --> 01:06:44,845
No, I'm not shitting. We shouldn't...
we shouldn't have done that.

982
01:06:45,682 --> 01:06:48,302
We should have never let him keep
that money. Look how he's looking at us.

983
01:06:48,476 --> 01:06:50,599
It's like he's fucking better and everything.

984
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:52,830
Like... like... like
you own us or something.

985
01:06:52,898 --> 01:06:55,602
I think we've all had too much to drink.
Let's call it a night.

986
01:06:55,776 --> 01:06:57,650
You're gonna keep the
money and shit, you know.

987
01:06:58,153 --> 01:06:59,352
Let's all go home.

988
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,500
That's what... that's what you
wanted, wasn't it, Hank?

989
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,400
You wanted me to pick sides.
Isn't that what you said?

990
01:07:07,706 --> 01:07:09,102
What are you talking about?

991
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:13,668
You know what...
You know what he's going to do?

992
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:17,587
He's gonna crawl into Carl's office
like, on his belly like a fucking snake.

993
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:19,170
He's gonna end up confessing.

994
01:07:19,344 --> 01:07:21,337
You know what, you're right.

995
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,800
I bet you would rat on us just to
get off the hook, now, wouldn't ya?

996
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:24,928
Take... take me home, man.
Let's go.

997
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,770
I don't want to stay here.
I gotta get home.

998
01:07:27,937 --> 01:07:29,052
No, huh,
you know what? Wait.

999
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:31,300
- Come on, take home.
- Uh, no!

1000
01:07:31,368 --> 01:07:32,800
We got... we got
something else for you, Hank.

1001
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:35,902
I tell you what... Let's do this:
Let's do more playacting, ...

1002
01:07:36,071 --> 01:07:38,823
and let's do it where he...
where Hank confesses, OK?...

1003
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,000
...to Carl, all right?
This is gonna be cool.

1004
01:07:42,003 --> 01:07:44,000
You be... and you be Hank
and I'll be Carl.

1005
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:46,532
No, you do... you do it.
You go out and be Hank,

1006
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,658
- like you'd knock on Carl's door.
- I can't do anything like him.

1007
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:51,007
But when you're fucked up,
you're funny as shit.

1008
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,365
- Come on, do it.
- OK.

1009
01:07:52,756 --> 01:07:56,007
And you're knocking on the door...
and I'm like sitting here doing paperwork

1010
01:07:56,177 --> 01:07:58,799
and dumb ass comes in, OK?

1011
01:07:59,014 --> 01:08:01,256
Dumb ass comes in with his
tail between his legs, OK?

1012
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:03,467
OK, here, I'm coming in.

1013
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:04,900
You ready?

1014
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
OK.

1015
01:08:06,586 --> 01:08:07,628
Hello?

1016
01:08:07,786 --> 01:08:08,828
Carl...

1017
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,281
It's Hank Mitchell.

1018
01:08:12,112 --> 01:08:14,036
- Well, hey, Hank, how you doing?
- Hey, how you doing?

1019
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,000
Sit... sit down.

1020
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:16,901
I need to talk to you.

1021
01:08:17,075 --> 01:08:18,784
Yeah, OK, what about?

1022
01:08:20,204 --> 01:08:21,700
It's about Dwight Stephanson.

1023
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,601
Yeah?

1024
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:26,372
He didn't die in an accident.

1025
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:28,796
What are you talking about?

1026
01:08:29,215 --> 01:08:30,874
No, no, I killed him.

1027
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:34,010
- You killed Dwight Stephanson?
- That's right.

1028
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:37,088
I suffocated him with his own scarf,

1029
01:08:37,265 --> 01:08:40,884
and then I just shoved him
off the bridge into Anders creek.

1030
01:08:41,521 --> 01:08:44,687
I made it look like an accident.

1031
01:08:45,066 --> 01:08:46,457
Well, why would you do
something like that?

1032
01:08:46,595 --> 01:08:47,116
That... that's OK...

1033
01:08:47,151 --> 01:08:51,481
4.5 million dollars is worth a hell of
a lot more to me than some old man's life.

1034
01:08:51,656 --> 01:08:53,116
- All right, that's enough.
- No.

1035
01:08:53,283 --> 01:08:55,193
I'm up to the part
where you're gonna agree

1036
01:08:55,369 --> 01:08:57,956
to testify against us, OK?
Can I just do that? Come on...

1037
01:08:58,163 --> 01:08:59,445
<i>I killed him.</i>

1038
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,414
<i>- You killed Dwight Stephanson?
- That's right.</i>

1039
01:09:03,545 --> 01:09:05,871
<i>I suffocated him with his own scarf,</i>

1040
01:09:06,048 --> 01:09:10,426
<i>and then I just shoved him off
the bridge into Anders creek.</i>

1041
01:09:10,803 --> 01:09:11,834
You taped this?

1042
01:09:13,806 --> 01:09:16,927
<i>I made it look like an accident.</i>

1043
01:09:22,232 --> 01:09:23,941
Well, why would you do that, Hank?

1044
01:09:24,235 --> 01:09:28,280
It's your confession. It's you saying
how you killed Dwight Stephanson.

1045
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,071
Nobody's going to believe that.

1046
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:35,285
I mean... I mean, it's obvious I'm just
kidding around on there, isn't it, Jacob?

1047
01:09:35,355 --> 01:09:40,043
Why... why would anybody believe it?
I mean, let's just think about this.

1048
01:09:40,212 --> 01:09:43,296
If... if you and I both go into
Carl's office tomorrow afternoon

1049
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:45,600
and we both claim the other one
killed Dwight Stephanson...

1050
01:09:45,642 --> 01:09:48,200
Who... who do you think he's
gonna believe, huh? You?

1051
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:50,670
A 40-year-old unemployed
high school dropout,

1052
01:09:50,848 --> 01:09:53,387
who's proud when people call
him the town drunk, or me?

1053
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:55,762
I've got a job.

1054
01:09:56,145 --> 01:09:58,324
I don't get drunk
and... and... and...

1055
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:01,312
and scream obscenities
at my wife in public.

1056
01:10:01,485 --> 01:10:04,238
I don't pass out on
other people's doorways.

1057
01:10:05,782 --> 01:10:07,027
I wonder who he's gonna believe?

1058
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:08,783
Yeah.

1059
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:11,783
Now we're all back
in the same boat again.

1060
01:10:11,818 --> 01:10:13,786
Isn't that right, Jacob?

1061
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,952
You seem to have forgotten
we're all in this together.

1062
01:10:19,797 --> 01:10:21,200
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's all...

1063
01:10:21,296 --> 01:10:22,547
- That's all it is, Lou.
- That's all it is.

1064
01:10:22,717 --> 01:10:25,553
You know, it's not to hurt you.
That... that's what Hank said.

1065
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:28,213
- It's just so you don't hurt him.
- That's right.

1066
01:10:28,259 --> 01:10:29,740
And... and... and
it's like...

1067
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,684
It's just in case you confess or...

1068
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,432
Wait a minute.

1069
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,985
Are you... are you telling me
you knew about this, Jacob?

1070
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:41,436
Take it easy.

1071
01:10:41,614 --> 01:10:44,699
- You saying you knew about this?
- He isn't going to use it, unless, uh...

1072
01:10:45,035 --> 01:10:47,442
Is that what...
Is that what you're saying here, Jacob?

1073
01:10:48,455 --> 01:10:50,780
That... that... that
you two worked together?

1074
01:10:51,124 --> 01:10:54,079
I... he said he'd help me
buy back the farm, Lou.

1075
01:10:54,532 --> 01:10:55,679
Oh!

1076
01:10:55,732 --> 01:10:56,879
Oh! Ha ha ha.

1077
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:00,919
So that's cool, right?

1078
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,586
- Hey, Lou, please don't be pissed off.
- Come on, let's go.

1079
01:11:03,764 --> 01:11:06,136
You know, he was...
We were just gonna...

1080
01:11:06,593 --> 01:11:08,361
He'll cool down, Hank.

1081
01:11:08,521 --> 01:11:10,470
Move, move, move!
Let's go.

1082
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:11,470
Don't move!

1083
01:11:12,816 --> 01:11:15,272
- What the hell are you doing?
- You give me that tape!

1084
01:11:15,444 --> 01:11:17,021
Goddamn, put down the gun!

1085
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:19,438
No! No, you're not leaving here
until I get that fucking tape!

1086
01:11:19,907 --> 01:11:21,965
OK, just settle down.

1087
01:11:22,035 --> 01:11:25,435
- Hey, Lou, leave him alone.
- Or what?

1088
01:11:25,606 --> 01:11:27,779
What, are you gonna shoot me,
Jake, huh?

1089
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,411
Just leave...
just leave him alone.

1090
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:32,354
No, you stabbed me in the back,
right here in my own house!

1091
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:33,526
Lou?

1092
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:34,689
What's going on?

1093
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:36,149
Come on, Lou, please!

1094
01:11:36,254 --> 01:11:37,675
You know I need that money.

1095
01:11:37,969 --> 01:11:39,132
Please, Lou, leave him alone.

1096
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:41,750
No, let me do it!
I need it tomorrow.

1097
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:44,334
You know, they're gonna...
They're gonna take my truck.

1098
01:11:44,434 --> 01:11:46,143
Put the gun... put
the gun down, Lou!

1099
01:11:46,312 --> 01:11:48,185
You said he's got a job.
It's you and me, buddy.

1100
01:11:48,355 --> 01:11:50,349
We're the ones...
We're the ones who needs it.

1101
01:11:50,733 --> 01:11:52,275
- He just wants it!
- OK, OK.

1102
01:11:52,287 --> 01:11:56,811
- Oh, Lou, put it down.
- No! Now, shut up!

1103
01:11:56,957 --> 01:11:59,748
Please, Lou, come on, man,
Lou, please, don't do that.

1104
01:11:59,827 --> 01:12:01,838
Do you think he's your friend, huh?

1105
01:12:01,845 --> 01:12:03,338
Lou, put it down!

1106
01:12:03,373 --> 01:12:06,001
He doesn't give a fuck about you, do ya?

1107
01:12:06,109 --> 01:12:08,535
Come on, Lou, let's all settle down.
We'll talk it through.

1108
01:12:11,228 --> 01:12:12,375
Jesus!

1109
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:15,545
That was an "insinuation".

1110
01:12:16,053 --> 01:12:17,334
Lou, for God's sakes.

1111
01:12:17,514 --> 01:12:18,462
Put the gun down, baby!

1112
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:20,611
Lou!

1113
01:12:21,268 --> 01:12:23,992
This...
This is the real thing.

1114
01:12:24,136 --> 01:12:26,679
Lou, no!
No, Lou, don't it!

1115
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:27,978
Put it down!

1116
01:12:32,059 --> 01:12:33,402
Aah!

1117
01:12:34,009 --> 01:12:35,702
Oh, God!

1118
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:43,746
Oh, my baby!

1119
01:12:49,194 --> 01:12:51,658
Oh, my baby!
Oh, my baby!

1120
01:12:52,019 --> 01:12:54,758
Hank, please stay
out here and talk to me.

1121
01:12:54,793 --> 01:12:55,063
Don't... don't...

1122
01:12:55,098 --> 01:12:56,805
Tell me what's going on, Hank?

1123
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,434
It's OK, Nancy.

1124
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:03,700
Call 911! Call the cops!

1125
01:13:03,732 --> 01:13:07,980
I'll call 911, but we got to decide...
We got to decide what we're gonna say.

1126
01:13:08,154 --> 01:13:10,300
You saw what happened.
It was an accident.

1127
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:13,191
- You killed him.
- He got drunk, he went crazy.

1128
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:15,393
- You killed him for the money!
- You can have his share.

1129
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,006
You can have it.

1130
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:20,606
You fucking think I like just money?!

1131
01:13:22,128 --> 01:13:24,168
- You stay out!
- Settle down.

1132
01:13:25,549 --> 01:13:26,462
Stop it!

1133
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:31,419
What are you doing?
Stop it!

1134
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:34,092
Take it easy, Nancy.

1135
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:36,205
Oh, my God!

1136
01:13:36,394 --> 01:13:38,219
No. No,
I wasn't going to...

1137
01:13:38,522 --> 01:13:41,716
No, no, no, no, I'm not
gonna... I wasn't gonna... no...

1138
01:13:41,725 --> 01:13:43,600
You saw what happened.
It was self-defense.

1139
01:13:43,783 --> 01:13:44,930
No, wait!

1140
01:13:46,948 --> 01:13:49,618
Let's just talk, ok?
Figure this out?

1141
01:13:49,829 --> 01:13:52,185
Come on, we gotta, OK?

1142
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:53,694
Aah!

1143
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:54,694
No!

1144
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:14,224
Hank.

1145
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,317
Hello, yes. There...
There's been a shooting.

1146
01:15:08,707 --> 01:15:11,245
H-Hank Mitchell.
I'm at Lou Chambers' place,

1147
01:15:11,418 --> 01:15:14,336
County Road 27,
just past the burnt road.

1148
01:15:16,382 --> 01:15:18,956
They're both...
They're both dead!

1149
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,543
Oh, God, please hurry!

1150
01:16:07,426 --> 01:16:08,569
Jacob?

1151
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,122
Jacob?

1152
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:21,120
Hey, what are you doing?

1153
01:16:21,624 --> 01:16:23,284
Huh?

1154
01:16:23,624 --> 01:16:25,284
What, are you going to be OK?

1155
01:16:27,629 --> 01:16:30,464
Come on, we can make this work.
We don't have much time.

1156
01:16:36,556 --> 01:16:39,177
Now, listen to what I have to say
very carefully, OK?

1157
01:16:40,936 --> 01:16:42,763
They were fighting, OK?

1158
01:16:43,063 --> 01:16:47,809
They were both drunk.
And Lou started pushing Nancy around.

1159
01:16:48,527 --> 01:16:53,025
When we tried to stop him, he got really
pissed off and he grabbed his shotgun.

1160
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,572
And she ran in the kitchen
and got her pistol.

1161
01:16:56,161 --> 01:16:58,783
You ran out to your truck
and got your rifle,

1162
01:16:58,997 --> 01:17:02,782
but by the time we got back to the house,
it was too late. He'd already shot her.

1163
01:17:04,212 --> 01:17:08,210
He was shooting up the whole place.
The ceilings, the walls, everything.

1164
01:17:08,383 --> 01:17:11,800
When we stepped in the doorway,
he shot at me, but he missed.

1165
01:17:12,137 --> 01:17:14,593
So he aimed the shotgun at my chest,

1166
01:17:15,308 --> 01:17:17,597
and just before he pulled the trigger...

1167
01:17:18,269 --> 01:17:19,550
you killed him.

1168
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,147
You saved my life.

1169
01:17:24,777 --> 01:17:25,975
See?

1170
01:17:26,945 --> 01:17:28,440
It was self-defense.

1171
01:17:30,826 --> 01:17:32,201
Come on, Jacob.

1172
01:17:33,661 --> 01:17:35,868
I need to hear you say it.

1173
01:17:43,589 --> 01:17:45,049
They were fighting.

1174
01:17:48,387 --> 01:17:50,593
Lou got really mad.

1175
01:17:51,098 --> 01:17:54,052
He shot the walls, he shot the ceiling.

1176
01:17:55,687 --> 01:17:57,430
Then what did we do?

1177
01:17:59,065 --> 01:18:00,974
We ran out to the truck.

1178
01:18:01,235 --> 01:18:04,458
You ran outside with Jacob,
'cause, uh...

1179
01:18:04,556 --> 01:18:11,284
Jacob said, uh... he ran out to get
his rifle on his own. He said, uh...

1180
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,500
See, he said, uh...

1181
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,411
"Lou ran you out of the house
after he shot Nancy."

1182
01:18:18,588 --> 01:18:19,936
Jacob said that?

1183
01:18:23,381 --> 01:18:24,424
Huh...

1184
01:18:31,226 --> 01:18:33,054
Well, I suppose...

1185
01:18:34,814 --> 01:18:36,854
I can see how it might've seemed
that way to him.

1186
01:18:42,072 --> 01:18:43,483
Because...

1187
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,652
he did... he did go out
to the truck alone.

1188
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,115
I followed him, but...

1189
01:18:53,335 --> 01:18:55,208
then, when I heard the shot...

1190
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:58,588
and Nancy got killed...

1191
01:18:59,384 --> 01:19:01,709
I turned back toward the house...

1192
01:19:02,178 --> 01:19:06,888
I was on the porch
wh-when Lou started outside...

1193
01:19:07,684 --> 01:19:11,220
And that's when I turned
to run out into the yard.

1194
01:19:13,358 --> 01:19:14,389
So...

1195
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:18,445
I guess...

1196
01:19:19,907 --> 01:19:23,952
I... I can see how it might've seemed that
way to Jacob, that I was running outside.

1197
01:19:28,433 --> 01:19:29,475
Yeah.

1198
01:19:34,173 --> 01:19:38,918
Go home, Hank. We'll, uh...
I think we got what we need for right now.

1199
01:19:40,054 --> 01:19:42,343
- "May they rest in peace."
- May they rest in peace.

1200
01:19:43,016 --> 01:19:45,500
"And may their souls and the souls"

1201
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:49,000
"of all the faithful departed, through
the mercy of God, rest in peace."

1202
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:51,604
- Amen.
- Amen.

1203
01:19:51,751 --> 01:19:53,875
In the name of the father,
the son, and the holy spirit...

1204
01:20:05,994 --> 01:20:07,193
Hey.

1205
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,782
Oh, I think the little
baby's ready to come out.

1206
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,581
Maybe she's getting a little cold.

1207
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:23,778
Whoa...
Yeah...

1208
01:21:24,795 --> 01:21:25,733
Shh...

1209
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:32,800
Shh...

1210
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:35,096
- Who could that be?
- I don't know.

1211
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,309
It's Carl.

1212
01:21:51,538 --> 01:21:53,503
Hey, Carl.

1213
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:56,373
I hope I didn't wake you, Hank.
I saw a light was still on.

1214
01:21:56,541 --> 01:22:00,076
Oh, no, no. Just, you know,
getting ready for bed.

1215
01:22:03,633 --> 01:22:06,302
I hate like hell to have
to do this to you, Hank.

1216
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:13,597
I was, uh... driving out by
Lou Chambers' place, and, uh...

1217
01:22:14,312 --> 01:22:17,895
I saw your brother's truck parked
out in the middle of the road.

1218
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,059
I could barely squeeze around it.

1219
01:22:20,903 --> 01:22:22,811
I found him inside the house
passed out in an armchair.

1220
01:22:25,032 --> 01:22:27,606
Oh. I appreciate
you bringing him here.

1221
01:22:28,369 --> 01:22:30,611
I... I mean, I hope
it wasn't too much...

1222
01:22:31,957 --> 01:22:36,251
I know you guys had a real rough time.
Just... have a talk with him, ok?

1223
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,828
And I'll try to keep an eye on him, too.

1224
01:22:40,507 --> 01:22:43,509
Come on, what the hell
were you thinking about, huh?

1225
01:22:43,803 --> 01:22:46,377
That's the last place in the world
you oughta be.

1226
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:52,479
God, I just about had a heart attack
when Carl knocked on the door.

1227
01:22:54,941 --> 01:22:56,732
We gotta be careful.

1228
01:22:58,236 --> 01:23:00,028
Can't take any chances.

1229
01:23:05,995 --> 01:23:07,200
Get yourself over.

1230
01:23:07,219 --> 01:23:08,470
There we go.

1231
01:23:12,336 --> 01:23:13,498
Comfortable?

1232
01:23:15,381 --> 01:23:18,964
Only I don't think I should be here
in the baby's room. It's... it's clean in here.

1233
01:23:19,677 --> 01:23:22,465
What? It's OK.
The baby sleeps with us.

1234
01:23:24,307 --> 01:23:25,802
Hey, you remember this?

1235
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:28,676
Everything goes to sleep.

1236
01:23:30,022 --> 01:23:33,720
Your head goes to sleep.
Remember when dad used to do that?

1237
01:23:33,752 --> 01:23:35,613
Your head goes to sleep.

1238
01:23:35,648 --> 01:23:37,475
Your shoulders go to sleep.

1239
01:23:37,505 --> 01:23:38,965
Your arms go to sleep.

1240
01:23:39,324 --> 01:23:41,281
Your back goes to sleep.

1241
01:23:41,743 --> 01:23:43,783
Hank, do you ever feel evil?

1242
01:23:52,505 --> 01:23:53,668
I do.

1243
01:23:55,383 --> 01:23:56,962
I feel evil.

1244
01:24:23,123 --> 01:24:25,994
You know, maybe I can get
a family of my own now.

1245
01:24:26,877 --> 01:24:28,752
I mean, with the money and all.

1246
01:24:35,554 --> 01:24:38,306
Why? Don't you think somebody
would marry me if I'm rich?

1247
01:24:39,058 --> 01:24:40,172
You don't need money for that.

1248
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Hank.

1249
01:24:43,229 --> 01:24:47,393
Hey, come on.
What about... What was her name?

1250
01:24:47,568 --> 01:24:48,784
Carrie Richards?

1251
01:24:49,862 --> 01:24:52,400
She liked you even though
you were broke-dick.

1252
01:24:55,994 --> 01:24:59,079
Oh, her. Yeah.
That was a whole different deal.

1253
01:24:59,184 --> 01:25:00,225
That was...

1254
01:25:00,373 --> 01:25:03,992
Her... her friends, they pitched in
100 bucks altogether

1255
01:25:04,211 --> 01:25:07,415
and betted her that she wouldn't
go steady with me for a month.

1256
01:25:13,722 --> 01:25:15,265
Jesus, Jacob.

1257
01:25:19,145 --> 01:25:21,018
I thought you guys had a thing.

1258
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:28,165
I don't know. It...

1259
01:25:28,489 --> 01:25:30,197
It weren't that bad.

1260
01:25:32,911 --> 01:25:35,449
I mean, actually,
it was kind of cool.

1261
01:25:35,789 --> 01:25:40,451
We used to walk around
together a lot, you know.

1262
01:25:40,486 --> 01:25:40,486
Take walks, you know?

1263
01:25:43,089 --> 01:25:45,627
And, uh, we talked about
all kinda cool stuff.

1264
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:51,090
I held hands with her one time.
We were walking around,

1265
01:25:51,264 --> 01:25:54,799
but my hand sweated so much
she kinda had to let it go.

1266
01:25:56,187 --> 01:25:57,978
I was nervous, I guess.

1267
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:03,058
But it was cool.
When the month was over, she, uh...

1268
01:26:03,653 --> 01:26:08,529
You know, kinda would say hi to me
sometimes in the hallway when I'd see her.

1269
01:26:10,495 --> 01:26:11,739
She didn't have to do that.

1270
01:26:12,371 --> 01:26:13,866
That was cool of her.

1271
01:26:18,044 --> 01:26:22,292
God, Hank, you know, I've never...
I've never even kissed a girl before.

1272
01:26:27,848 --> 01:26:33,000
And you know what? If being rich will
change that, I'm all for it. I don't care.

1273
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:37,389
I just wanna feel it, you know? I just wanna
know what people do, you know?

1274
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:40,687
I don't care if it's 'cause of the money.

1275
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:57,294
Hank?
I'm gonna be happy now, right?

1276
01:26:58,882 --> 01:27:00,210
Sure you are.

1277
01:27:00,802 --> 01:27:02,130
We all are.

1278
01:27:04,848 --> 01:27:06,591
Yeah, that's right.
We all are.

1279
01:27:07,934 --> 01:27:11,600
You know what? I'm gonna, you know,
buy back the farm, you know?

1280
01:27:12,022 --> 01:27:15,723
And have, uh... And have a lot of kids,
'cause I'll meet this nice girl

1281
01:27:15,901 --> 01:27:18,689
and she'll be really cool to me
and be really nice.

1282
01:27:18,863 --> 01:27:21,734
Just normal,
a normal woman, you know.

1283
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:27,783
And, uh... And then you and Sarah
will come over and bring Amanda,

1284
01:27:28,291 --> 01:27:30,828
and we'll all sit around
and tell stories and stuff.

1285
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:34,870
We'll drink on the porch
like dad and Uncle Ted used to do.

1286
01:27:35,018 --> 01:27:36,860
- You know?
- Yeah.

1287
01:28:03,539 --> 01:28:05,532
He nod off on you, Jack?

1288
01:28:26,648 --> 01:28:29,436
Hey, Carl. Gettin' a bit thin
up top there, Hank.

1289
01:28:32,446 --> 01:28:34,522
Don't you have any crimes to solve?

1290
01:28:34,699 --> 01:28:35,778
Maybe.

1291
01:28:37,118 --> 01:28:40,570
Think you could track down Jacob,
bring him by my office tomorrow afternoon?

1292
01:28:40,747 --> 01:28:42,870
Sure. What for?

1293
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:46,585
Man from the FBI's gonna
be driving through.

1294
01:28:47,088 --> 01:28:49,625
Thought you two might
be able to help him out.

1295
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,506
Seems they're looking for a lost plane.

1296
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:53,363
Huh.

1297
01:28:57,141 --> 01:28:59,632
- See ya about 3:00.
- You bet.

1298
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:11,000
Maybe we should just leave.

1299
01:29:11,051 --> 01:29:13,881
Take the money and the baby
and just leave the country.

1300
01:29:13,993 --> 01:29:15,404
Stop it, Hank!

1301
01:29:15,703 --> 01:29:18,373
You'll go in there
and you'll see what he knows.

1302
01:29:18,623 --> 01:29:20,527
If anything looks bad,
we can always move the money.

1303
01:29:20,538 --> 01:29:24,400
- It's still the only thing tying us to anything.
- The connections are just under the surface!

1304
01:29:24,714 --> 01:29:28,000
Sarah, I mean, think about it.
It wouldn't be that hard

1305
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:30,666
for somebody to just put it all together.

1306
01:29:31,304 --> 01:29:33,877
There's the plane and...
and Stephanson.

1307
01:29:34,057 --> 01:29:35,256
There's Lou and Nancy.

1308
01:29:35,434 --> 01:29:37,473
You've gotta remember how people see you.

1309
01:29:37,645 --> 01:29:39,518
You're just a normal guy,
a nice, sweet, normal guy.

1310
01:29:39,688 --> 01:29:42,262
- They're gonna know!
- No, they won't!

1311
01:29:43,526 --> 01:29:47,026
Nobody would ever believe that you'd
be capable of doing what you've done.

1312
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:57,781
Well, it was snowin' pretty hard,
so we're not really sure,

1313
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:01,162
but it sounded kinda like
an engine cuttin' on and off.

1314
01:30:01,714 --> 01:30:05,000
But that was it.
We didn't hear anything more.

1315
01:30:05,635 --> 01:30:08,969
No... No crash.
No engine. Nothing.

1316
01:30:13,268 --> 01:30:14,513
Anything you want to add to that, Jacob?

1317
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:20,188
No.

1318
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:22,188
I can't think of anything.

1319
01:30:22,362 --> 01:30:23,737
That's about it.

1320
01:30:24,447 --> 01:30:26,986
It was probably
a snowmobile or something.

1321
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:27,813
You know?

1322
01:30:41,133 --> 01:30:41,963
Well, guess that's it, guys.

1323
01:30:43,177 --> 01:30:45,300
- Thanks for comin'.
- My pleasure, Carl.

1324
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:45,919
Good to see you, Carl.

1325
01:30:46,306 --> 01:30:48,547
- Nice to have met you.
- I'll talk to you later.

1326
01:30:52,604 --> 01:30:54,680
Do you think you could
take us out there?

1327
01:30:57,943 --> 01:30:59,318
To the nature preserve?

1328
01:30:59,738 --> 01:31:02,608
Have to go in the morning, I guess,
after the storm passes.

1329
01:31:05,618 --> 01:31:07,030
C-can you tell us what
this is all about?

1330
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,325
Lookin' for a plane.

1331
01:31:11,751 --> 01:31:13,625
There's no way
it's from the armored car robbery.

1332
01:31:13,795 --> 01:31:17,544
This isn't a guess, honey.
The guy from the FBI told me.

1333
01:31:19,467 --> 01:31:21,295
It doesn't make sense.

1334
01:31:22,387 --> 01:31:23,882
The kidnapping made sense.

1335
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,631
He's looking for a plane full of money.

1336
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:27,600
I mean, how many of those
can there be around here?

1337
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:29,704
It was hundred-dollar bills, Hank.

1338
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:31,842
If it was an armored car robbery,
there'd be other denominations.

1339
01:31:31,983 --> 01:31:34,182
There'd be 50s and 20s and 10s.

1340
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:38,773
Well, congratulations, Sarah.
I guess you know more than the FBI.

1341
01:31:45,062 --> 01:31:46,105
Hank?

1342
01:31:49,043 --> 01:31:50,835
Did he show you his badge?

1343
01:31:51,379 --> 01:31:52,754
Why would he show me his badge?

1344
01:31:53,506 --> 01:31:54,420
Wait.

1345
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,890
It's him, isn't it?

1346
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:14,524
It's the older one... Vernon.
He's looking for his brother.

1347
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:16,239
I guy I met today was skinnier.

1348
01:32:16,657 --> 01:32:18,235
He didn't have a beard.

1349
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:20,900
Well, maybe he lost weight.
Maybe he shaved.

1350
01:32:21,496 --> 01:32:24,283
Well, that doesn't make
a difference, does it?

1351
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:27,668
I mean, no matter who he is,
I still have to take him to the plane.

1352
01:32:28,671 --> 01:32:30,248
Well, if we think it's him,
you shouldn't go.

1353
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:31,837
Why not?

1354
01:32:32,217 --> 01:32:36,464
Because he's gonna shoot all 3 of you, Hank.
As soon as he sees the plane.

1355
01:32:37,264 --> 01:32:39,304
That's why he wants you to go,
so he can get rid of the witnesses.

1356
01:32:39,934 --> 01:32:42,342
But if he's really from the FBI,

1357
01:32:42,729 --> 01:32:45,481
and I don't show up,
it's gonna look suspicious as hell.

1358
01:32:50,112 --> 01:32:53,232
I'll call the FBI in the morning.
I'll ask for an agent Baxter.

1359
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:56,409
That won't work. I'm meeting him at 9:00.
They won't be open before that.

1360
01:32:56,577 --> 01:32:59,034
You can stall them for a bit.

1361
01:33:00,165 --> 01:33:03,949
And, uh, I'll call from here,
and then I'll call you at Carl's office.

1362
01:33:04,461 --> 01:33:06,703
- And what if there's no agent Baxter?
- Then what?

1363
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:11,792
Well, then you won't go.
You can tell Carl that the baby's sick

1364
01:33:13,305 --> 01:33:15,178
and... and that you have to come home.

1365
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:16,849
What about Jacob?

1366
01:33:18,101 --> 01:33:20,593
Say he's hung over.
Carl would believe that.

1367
01:33:21,147 --> 01:33:23,685
Whoever the guy is,
you don't want Jacob there.

1368
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:27,437
It sounds like a B.S. excuse.

1369
01:33:27,612 --> 01:33:29,272
- Hank, what do you want?
- Well...

1370
01:33:30,115 --> 01:33:33,283
Do you want to just walk out there
and get shot by this guy?

1371
01:33:33,453 --> 01:33:35,575
No, I don't wanna walk out
there and get shot!

1372
01:33:35,871 --> 01:33:38,078
- Well, I'm trying to come up with a plan.
- A plan?

1373
01:33:38,875 --> 01:33:43,495
Like the one to take the money back to
the plane, and we end up killing Stephanson?

1374
01:33:43,964 --> 01:33:47,630
Or maybe the one where we tape Lou,
and 2 more people end up dead.

1375
01:33:47,885 --> 01:33:50,377
Is that the sort of plan
you're thinking of?

1376
01:33:50,847 --> 01:33:52,258
Well, I've got a plan!

1377
01:33:53,057 --> 01:33:56,261
I'm taking the money back right now...
All of it.

1378
01:33:56,285 --> 01:33:57,285
- Hank.
- No!

1379
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:01,941
I'm gonna put it back, and everything's
gonna be just like it used to be.

1380
01:34:02,943 --> 01:34:05,731
That money, goddamn it!
Fuckin' money!

1381
01:34:05,905 --> 01:34:08,527
Is that what you think?
Is that what you think you want?

1382
01:34:08,825 --> 01:34:11,198
Walking off to the feed store
every morning for the next 30 years,

1383
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:16,198
waiting for tom Butler to retire or die
so you can finally get a raise?

1384
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:18,418
And what about Amanda?

1385
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:21,790
Do you think she's gonna like growing up
in somebody else's hand-me-down clothes?

1386
01:34:22,132 --> 01:34:24,837
Playing with some kid's old toys
because we can never afford

1387
01:34:25,011 --> 01:34:26,718
to buy her anything new?

1388
01:34:26,887 --> 01:34:28,299
Don't say any more.

1389
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:29,837
And me...

1390
01:34:32,143 --> 01:34:33,637
What about me?

1391
01:34:38,526 --> 01:34:42,987
Spending the rest of my life, 8 hours a day,
with a fake smile plastered on my face

1392
01:34:43,573 --> 01:34:45,447
checking out books.

1393
01:34:45,826 --> 01:34:48,661
And then coming home
to cook dinner for you...

1394
01:34:48,829 --> 01:34:53,538
The same meals over and over again,
whatever the week's coupons will allow.

1395
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:58,292
Only going out to restaurants
for special occasions...

1396
01:34:58,465 --> 01:35:01,549
Birthdays or anniversaries. And even
then having to watch what we order...

1397
01:35:01,718 --> 01:35:05,218
Skipping the appetizer,
coming home for dessert.

1398
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:07,216
You think that's gonna make me happy?

1399
01:35:07,683 --> 01:35:10,720
- That's enough.
- No, no. I haven't done Jacob yet.

1400
01:35:11,187 --> 01:35:13,476
It's back to the welfare office for Jacob.

1401
01:35:13,648 --> 01:35:15,689
The occasional odd job.

1402
01:35:16,026 --> 01:35:17,935
But with Lou gone now...

1403
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:22,649
Just himself and his dog all alone in that filthy
apartment. How long do you give him, Hank?

1404
01:35:22,826 --> 01:35:24,106
Stop it!

1405
01:35:27,914 --> 01:35:29,326
Sounds wonderful, doesn't it?

1406
01:35:30,251 --> 01:35:31,958
Everything just like it used to be.

1407
01:35:42,389 --> 01:35:43,504
<i>Federal bureau of investigation.</i>

1408
01:35:44,225 --> 01:35:46,384
I would like to speak to...

1409
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:49,979
Is there an agent Neil Baxter there?

1410
01:35:51,691 --> 01:35:53,022
Well, if Jacob can't make it,

1411
01:35:53,071 --> 01:35:56,260
that just leaves more of Linda's
homemade breakfast treats to go around.

1412
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,350
Hank, go ahead.
Have one of those.

1413
01:35:58,741 --> 01:36:00,284
Help yourself.

1414
01:36:00,535 --> 01:36:04,615
That's her own special creation there...
Deep-fried dietetic donuts...

1415
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:10,285
And so inedible, you won't be able
to get enough of it down to be bad for you.

1416
01:36:13,051 --> 01:36:17,756
Hey, this guy, uh... You know, this guy Baxter,
he showed you his badge or anything?

1417
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,344
Badge?

1418
01:36:20,014 --> 01:36:23,348
Yeah. This is kinda stupid,
but, you know, I always wondered

1419
01:36:23,518 --> 01:36:25,013
if they look like
they do in the movies.

1420
01:36:25,187 --> 01:36:26,385
Yeah? How's that?

1421
01:36:27,004 --> 01:36:31,000
Well, you know, kinda
bright and silver with a big "FBI"

1422
01:36:31,029 --> 01:36:32,193
stamped across the center.

1423
01:36:33,029 --> 01:36:34,193
Not really.

1424
01:36:34,407 --> 01:36:35,402
He showed you his?

1425
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:38,364
Well, no,
but I've seen them before.

1426
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:43,784
I wonder where he is.

1427
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:47,244
Well, you know, I bet he'd show it to you
if you just ask him that.

1428
01:36:50,466 --> 01:36:54,001
Hell, he might even let you hold his gun
if you ask him real nice.

1429
01:36:58,809 --> 01:37:00,174
You know what, later on,

1430
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:04,951
I could take you for a ride in my truck
and make the lights flash for you.

1431
01:37:05,552 --> 01:37:06,352
Yeah?

1432
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:07,420
<i>- Carl?
- Yes.</i>

1433
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,405
<i>It's Sarah. Hi.
I'm looking for Hank. Is he there?</i>

1434
01:37:10,572 --> 01:37:11,652
Yes, ma'am.
You found him.

1435
01:37:11,824 --> 01:37:15,110
He's standing right here.
He's trying to avoid eating

1436
01:37:15,286 --> 01:37:18,371
one of my wife's homemade donuts.
How's the baby?

1437
01:37:18,915 --> 01:37:22,035
<i>She's not doing so good. That's part
of what I'm calling to tell him about.</i>

1438
01:37:23,378 --> 01:37:24,837
I'm sorry to hear...

1439
01:37:25,297 --> 01:37:28,247
Well, you probably better
tell him that yourself, OK?

1440
01:37:28,408 --> 01:37:29,400
All right. You take care.

1441
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:30,340
That's your wife.

1442
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:32,200
Hi, honey.

1443
01:37:32,275 --> 01:37:33,955
<i>- It's him.
- What?</i>

1444
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:36,679
<i>It's him, Hank.
Come home.</i>

1445
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:38,280
<i>You gotta get out of there.</i>

1446
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:42,188
<i>Hank?</i>

1447
01:37:43,317 --> 01:37:44,776
I gotta stay.

1448
01:37:45,194 --> 01:37:46,774
<i>What do you mean you gotta stay?</i>

1449
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:49,553
<i>We agreed that if I called you,
that you were gonna come home.</i>

1450
01:37:50,117 --> 01:37:51,575
What about Carl?

1451
01:37:53,245 --> 01:37:56,994
<i>I don't know. Tell Carl...
Tell him to give the guy the directions</i>

1452
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:59,622
<i>and that you two will meet him there later...</i>

1453
01:38:00,128 --> 01:38:01,373
Everybody ready to roll?

1454
01:38:01,671 --> 01:38:03,878
<i>Hank, he's gonna...
He's gonna shoot you both.</i>

1455
01:38:04,049 --> 01:38:05,459
Ready to roll.

1456
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:08,231
<i>Hank?</i>

1457
01:38:08,389 --> 01:38:09,431
Yeah.

1458
01:38:11,899 --> 01:38:13,776
<i>Hank?</i>

1459
01:38:16,187 --> 01:38:18,643
Well, they're waiting
for me, baby. I gotta go.

1460
01:38:18,755 --> 01:38:20,699
- Carl, how you doin'?
- Good morning. How'd you sleep?

1461
01:38:20,943 --> 01:38:22,500
<i>You come home, OK? Please, baby.</i>

1462
01:38:22,557 --> 01:38:23,516
Sarah.

1463
01:38:24,201 --> 01:38:25,163
OK.

1464
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:25,979
<i>Wait, Hank!</i>

1465
01:38:26,157 --> 01:38:27,568
Yeah, I'll see you then.

1466
01:38:27,762 --> 01:38:31,300
Ok. Yeah. Yeah,
I'll see you then.

1467
01:38:31,362 --> 01:38:33,271
<i>God damn it! Don't!</i>

1468
01:38:33,415 --> 01:38:34,791
I love you, too.

1469
01:38:35,722 --> 01:38:36,973
<i>Wait! Hank?</i>

1470
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:40,662
Everything OK?

1471
01:38:41,091 --> 01:38:45,670
Oh, yeah. You know, just, uh...
Some confusion about this evening's plans.

1472
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,717
Where's your brother?

1473
01:38:47,558 --> 01:38:50,426
Oh, uh, Jacob won't be
joining us this morning.

1474
01:38:50,514 --> 01:38:53,182
It seems he tied one on
again last night.

1475
01:38:53,981 --> 01:38:56,650
- Ready when you are, Hank.
- Good. Let's go.

1476
01:39:02,077 --> 01:39:03,641
Oh, no. You
should've asked me.

1477
01:39:04,953 --> 01:39:06,900
Oh, hey.

1478
01:39:06,953 --> 01:39:08,993
I forgot my hat.
I'll catch up with you guys.

1479
01:39:09,164 --> 01:39:11,406
Well, go get it.
It's cold out there.

1480
01:39:12,573 --> 01:39:14,563
You saw that truck right
around the corner, didn't you?

1481
01:39:45,654 --> 01:39:47,218
Shit.

1482
01:41:10,467 --> 01:41:13,137
Oh, this is the place, Hank.
I'm pretty sure of it.

1483
01:41:13,304 --> 01:41:16,800
Look. Right there
is that, uh, nature preserve sign.

1484
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:18,316
That's where you guys were.

1485
01:41:18,351 --> 01:41:21,500
I guess you're right, but I thought
it was a little further down,

1486
01:41:21,582 --> 01:41:22,900
just, you know...

1487
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:26,523
And, you know, if it was off over on
that side, that's farmland over there.

1488
01:41:26,694 --> 01:41:28,604
Those farmers probably
would have found it by now.

1489
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:31,022
The best bet's gotta be over
here in the nature preserve.

1490
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:35,067
So I think the best idea is each of us take
a different section of the woods...

1491
01:41:35,704 --> 01:41:39,537
Oh, good for Jacob.
This will make things go faster.

1492
01:41:44,088 --> 01:41:45,667
Bring your rifle!

1493
01:41:48,386 --> 01:41:50,627
We'll take a different section of the woods.

1494
01:41:50,804 --> 01:41:53,759
If you or I find it, Baxter, we'll just
fire a couple of shots into the air.

1495
01:41:55,894 --> 01:41:58,931
And, uh, Hank, here, you take that whistle.
And if you find it, just blow it loud as you can.

1496
01:41:59,106 --> 01:42:00,897
We'll all come running.

1497
01:42:12,496 --> 01:42:13,776
I thought you weren't up for this.

1498
01:42:14,456 --> 01:42:15,619
I talked to Sarah.

1499
01:42:18,127 --> 01:42:19,752
Well, I got up, and I felt better.

1500
01:42:20,129 --> 01:42:22,003
You're right. You don't look good.
Something wrong?

1501
01:42:23,508 --> 01:42:25,216
Oh, I just...
I had a rough night.

1502
01:42:25,385 --> 01:42:26,500
Well, let's go, guys.

1503
01:42:27,804 --> 01:42:29,264
- I'll take the center.
- All right.

1504
01:44:15,859 --> 01:44:16,663
Hey! Hey!

1505
01:44:16,774 --> 01:44:18,025
Carl...

1506
01:44:39,203 --> 01:44:40,578
Wait, Carl!

1507
01:44:41,705 --> 01:44:43,433
Get outta there!
Run!

1508
01:44:43,608 --> 01:44:45,036
Hey! Hey! I found it.
It's right down here.

1509
01:44:45,501 --> 01:44:48,075
Pull your gun on him!
Make him show you his badge!

1510
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,955
- What?
- He's got a gun!

1511
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:51,681
He's got a gun!

1512
01:44:51,716 --> 01:44:54,050
He's not FBI! He's lying!

1513
01:44:54,111 --> 01:44:55,320
What are you talking about?

1514
01:44:55,387 --> 01:44:56,218
Just do it!

1515
01:44:57,807 --> 01:45:00,180
I guess you might as well
just show him your badge.

1516
01:45:00,215 --> 01:45:01,437
All right, all right.

1517
01:45:01,644 --> 01:45:03,437
It's OK, Hank. He's gonna
show you his badge.

1518
01:45:03,689 --> 01:45:05,349
Don't turn your back!

1519
01:45:06,326 --> 01:45:07,369
Aah!

1520
01:45:12,156 --> 01:45:13,532
Where's my money?

1521
01:45:14,666 --> 01:45:15,813
Where is it?

1522
01:45:22,126 --> 01:45:23,669
It's in the plane.

1523
01:45:24,587 --> 01:45:25,369
Then go get it.

1524
01:45:26,369 --> 01:45:27,469
Come on!

1525
01:45:31,429 --> 01:45:33,765
You waiting for something, genius?
Do it!

1526
01:45:33,814 --> 01:45:34,856
OK, OK.

1527
01:46:04,006 --> 01:46:05,798
Come on! Today!

1528
01:46:19,566 --> 01:46:21,227
OK, I've got it!

1529
01:46:32,956 --> 01:46:35,163
Where the fuck is the rest...

1530
01:46:39,588 --> 01:46:40,751
So you had a piece, huh?

1531
01:46:49,099 --> 01:46:52,136
But you're not the cold-blooded type,
are you, Mr. Mitchell?

1532
01:46:58,026 --> 01:47:00,731
Looks like we're both gonna have
an awful lot of explaining to do.

1533
01:47:03,282 --> 01:47:04,278
Just me.

1534
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:20,809
Jacob?

1535
01:47:29,636 --> 01:47:31,304
Hank?

1536
01:47:32,982 --> 01:47:34,227
It's ok.

1537
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:44,543
Don't.

1538
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:44,919
Maybe...

1539
01:47:44,954 --> 01:47:46,385
Don't. Don't.

1540
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:47,172
You're gonna mess it up.

1541
01:47:47,207 --> 01:47:49,994
- Mess it... mess it up?
- Just leave him be.

1542
01:47:50,103 --> 01:47:51,145
OK.

1543
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:01,428
You understand what we gotta say?

1544
01:48:01,463 --> 01:48:02,628
Huh?

1545
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:08,144
We're gonna tell them that Carl lent me
the gun to signal if I found the plane.

1546
01:48:09,606 --> 01:48:13,307
Then when I saw Baxter shoot him...

1547
01:48:13,611 --> 01:48:15,236
We can't do this, Hank.

1548
01:48:15,405 --> 01:48:16,400
What do you mean we can't?

1549
01:48:16,781 --> 01:48:18,608
We're gonna have to tell on ourselves.

1550
01:48:20,493 --> 01:48:21,324
No, we don't.

1551
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:23,609
We... we can't.

1552
01:48:23,644 --> 01:48:24,297
No. No.

1553
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:28,789
- No. This is gonna work.
- Not anymore.

1554
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:34,062
Yeah.

1555
01:48:34,385 --> 01:48:36,009
Yeah, it's gonna work.

1556
01:48:38,973 --> 01:48:40,171
It's perfect.

1557
01:48:41,602 --> 01:48:42,749
Come on, Jacob.

1558
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:48,606
We just gotta get through the next
couple of hours, and then we're home.

1559
01:48:48,776 --> 01:48:50,318
We're home-free.

1560
01:48:56,576 --> 01:48:58,237
You wanna be happy?

1561
01:49:00,997 --> 01:49:02,790
You want a wife and kids?

1562
01:49:03,626 --> 01:49:06,960
Me and you sitting around on
the porch drinking late at night?

1563
01:49:10,717 --> 01:49:13,339
Well, God damn it,
this is what it costs...

1564
01:49:14,513 --> 01:49:16,387
Right here, right now.

1565
01:49:21,009 --> 01:49:21,945
Come on.

1566
01:49:23,009 --> 01:49:23,945
Come on.

1567
01:49:24,065 --> 01:49:27,731
Let's go over this again, make sure
we haven't overlooked anything.

1568
01:49:30,156 --> 01:49:31,982
I wish somebody else
had found that money.

1569
01:49:32,157 --> 01:49:34,151
Well, they didn't. Now quit.

1570
01:49:43,796 --> 01:49:45,920
OK. Baxter came down here.

1571
01:49:46,508 --> 01:49:49,129
He came up behind Carl.

1572
01:49:52,222 --> 01:49:55,508
I was over there.
Yeah, and you were in the woods.

1573
01:49:55,543 --> 01:49:55,543
Yeah. Yeah.

1574
01:49:59,564 --> 01:50:02,684
Yeah. It's gonna work.
It's gonna work. Yeah.

1575
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:09,653
W-what are you doing?
Now put this back.

1576
01:50:14,289 --> 01:50:17,077
Make it look like
the bad guy did it, Hank.

1577
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:21,440
What?

1578
01:50:22,256 --> 01:50:23,834
W-we're almost home.

1579
01:50:24,801 --> 01:50:26,259
I'm tired, Hank.

1580
01:50:32,017 --> 01:50:35,967
A-a-and I don't care. It's ok with me.
I'm not... I'm not afraid.

1581
01:50:38,849 --> 01:50:39,824
No, Jacob.

1582
01:50:39,859 --> 01:50:42,267
- I'm not afraid. It's perfect.
- Stop that, Jacob.

1583
01:50:42,289 --> 01:50:43,539
It's... it's perfect.

1584
01:50:43,574 --> 01:50:43,574
No. No.

1585
01:50:43,863 --> 01:50:45,608
Come on, Hank.
Let me do something.

1586
01:50:45,643 --> 01:50:47,353
This is...
This is the only thing.

1587
01:50:47,458 --> 01:50:49,443
See, I don't wanna sit around
the rest of my life

1588
01:50:49,587 --> 01:50:51,204
thinking about this shit.
I can't do it...

1589
01:50:51,239 --> 01:50:52,822
Sit on the porch and drink.
I can't do it.

1590
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:54,701
So you're gonna have to do it.

1591
01:50:54,877 --> 01:50:55,623
Couple more hours,
we'll be home.

1592
01:50:55,794 --> 01:50:58,998
You can do this, and it's
gonna be perfect for you.

1593
01:50:59,173 --> 01:51:02,507
You got something to go on for, Hank,
and you know it.

1594
01:51:03,636 --> 01:51:05,345
I don't wanna be here.

1595
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,290
No. Please, no.

1596
01:51:09,559 --> 01:51:12,395
Come on, Hank.
Let me do something.

1597
01:51:14,439 --> 01:51:18,652
You just tell the little girl that I...
that, you know, that bear is from me.

1598
01:51:18,915 --> 01:51:20,062
You know?

1599
01:51:34,587 --> 01:51:36,415
If you love me, Hank,
you'll do it.

1600
01:51:38,383 --> 01:51:40,258
I'll give you a chance.
I won't look at you.

1601
01:51:42,347 --> 01:51:44,505
I won't look at you, Hank,
but if you don't do it...

1602
01:51:46,882 --> 01:51:48,133
then I'm gonna do it,

1603
01:51:48,155 --> 01:51:50,889
and then we're gonna both
gonna be fucked, aren't we?

1604
01:51:56,404 --> 01:52:01,100
We don't need to both be fucked.
I'll... I'll do it, Hank, if you don't.

1605
01:52:01,117 --> 01:52:03,075
- No!
- I'm telling you I will.

1606
01:52:11,879 --> 01:52:16,008
Boy, it's... it's funny about f-finding
this fucking plane, wasn't it?

1607
01:52:21,361 --> 01:52:22,403
Jacob!

1608
01:52:43,253 --> 01:52:44,296
Oh, Jacob!

1609
01:53:11,322 --> 01:53:15,450
To someone who's been properly trained,
there are many ways to detect a liar.

1610
01:53:15,702 --> 01:53:19,700
The shifty eyes of detective novels
have a certain basis in fact.

1611
01:53:20,165 --> 01:53:22,288
A wooden or stilted tone.

1612
01:53:23,043 --> 01:53:25,617
Gestures that seem either slightly robotic

1613
01:53:25,796 --> 01:53:28,632
or else unnecessarily expansive.

1614
01:53:30,093 --> 01:53:32,549
Details tend to be vague, slippery.

1615
01:53:34,306 --> 01:53:37,722
Sometimes the suspect will cover his mouth
with his hand when he speaks.

1616
01:53:38,936 --> 01:53:41,938
Did you notice anything like that
in the guy you shot today?

1617
01:53:44,943 --> 01:53:47,399
He was lying to you, Mr. Mitchell.
He wasn't from the FBI.

1618
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:49,000
His name was Vernon Bokovsky.

1619
01:53:49,001 --> 01:53:52,083
His brother was in that crashed plane
you found out there today.

1620
01:53:52,118 --> 01:53:56,163
Bokovski and his brother were the guys who
kidnapped that McMartin girl last November.

1621
01:53:56,331 --> 01:53:58,704
Remember the one they shot
and dumped in the lake?

1622
01:53:58,917 --> 01:54:01,871
4.4 million in ransom money.
Want to touch it?

1623
01:54:03,339 --> 01:54:04,619
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

1624
01:54:08,804 --> 01:54:09,883
Pretty hefty, huh?

1625
01:54:09,955 --> 01:54:11,928
That's only part of it.
We're still tracking down the rest.

1626
01:54:12,098 --> 01:54:13,474
Yeah. It's just a matter of time.

1627
01:54:14,184 --> 01:54:15,512
A matter of time?

1628
01:54:17,230 --> 01:54:20,270
Well... we had the money for 2 hours
before the kidnappers picked it up.

1629
01:54:20,441 --> 01:54:23,893
Couldn't mark it. We were afraid they'd
detect the markings and kill the girl, so, um...

1630
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:26,823
We put together a task force of 20 agents,

1631
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:31,300
and they wrote down as many of
the serial numbers as they could.

1632
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:34,076
We managed to record just
under 5.000 of them.

1633
01:54:34,249 --> 01:54:35,992
That's 1 out of 10 of the bills.

1634
01:54:37,752 --> 01:54:41,336
Now it's simply a matter of waiting
for the numbers to turn up.

1635
01:54:42,049 --> 01:54:45,659
Can't go around passing $100 bills without
eventually sticking in someone's memory.

1636
01:54:50,855 --> 01:54:52,002
No. No!

1637
01:54:53,461 --> 01:54:54,921
No, Hank. Hank!
Oh, Hank!

1638
01:54:56,774 --> 01:54:58,565
Hank, we can run with it.
We could leave the country.

1639
01:54:58,734 --> 01:55:02,353
We could go to South America
or to Australia or someplace far away.

1640
01:55:02,388 --> 01:55:03,658
Please, Hank!

1641
01:55:03,693 --> 01:55:04,929
Aah! Aah.

1642
01:56:08,439 --> 01:56:12,022
<i>There are days when I manage
not to think of anything at all...</i>

1643
01:56:14,069 --> 01:56:15,398
<i>Not the money...</i>

1644
01:56:16,697 --> 01:56:18,108
<i>Or the murders...</i>

1645
01:56:20,035 --> 01:56:21,232
<i>Or Jacob...</i>

1646
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:27,661
<i>Days when Sarah and I try to pretend
that we're just like everyone else...</i>

1647
01:56:29,212 --> 01:56:31,418
<i>As if none of it had ever happened.</i>

1648
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:36,671
<i>But those days are few and far between.</i>
