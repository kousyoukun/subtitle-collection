00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,800
Jacob:
you know what,

167
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,500
It's probably one of
those drunk doctors.

168
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
They're always crashing
their plane, you know?

169
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,400
Lou: yeah, it must've
come down right there.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
See all them
broken trees, jake?

171
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,800
It's too dark.
I can't see.

172
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,900
Scrape some of that snow
off the windshield.

173
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,500
Lou:...can't see
a damn thing.

174
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,000
Door's stuck.

175
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,900
Jacob: probably
a singer or something.

176
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Lou: still can't see
nothin' here.

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,100
Still can't see
anything.

178
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,600
Can't see
a damn thing.

179
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,800
I see the pilot!

180
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,500
What's he
talking about?

181
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Said somebody's
in there.

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Are you ok?

183
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,400
Hey. Hey, buddy...

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,300
Aah! Whoaaa...

185
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,500
Ah! Aah! Aah!

186
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Hey, get--Get off!

[Crows squawking]

188
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,200
Lou: what the hell
is going on..?

00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,100
Aah! Ohh!

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,100
Oh, god!

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Shit!

192
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,000
Hey, lemme
outta here.

193
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,100
Good grief, hank.

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,300
Let me get this
off of him. Here...

195
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,700
Hank, did you--
Did you--

196
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,500
Did you see--Did you
see all them birds?

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,300
Did i see the birds?

198
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,900
Come on, help me
get outta here.

199
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Hank, put that
on your eye.

200
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,800
Thanks.

201
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,800
You tore your coat,
you know.

202
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, my god...

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,400
Oh, my god!
Look at this!

204
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
Shit!

205
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh, my god!

206
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,800
How much you think
is in here?

207
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,100
God almighty!
These are $100 bills!

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
The whole bag's
full of 'em!

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,900
Is this--Is it
ha ha! Real money, lou?

210
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,300
Oh, hell, yes,
it's real.

211
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,100
Don't be stupid.

212
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,700
Why would somebody
be flying around

213
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,900
With this kind
of cash?

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,300
You know what? I bet
it's drug money.

215
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,300
That's probably
i bet you're what it is. Right.

216
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,000
This guy's
a dope dealer

217
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,900
Because that's
what they do.

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They fly around in
these little planes.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
I guaran-Damn- Tee you.
This is dirty money.

220
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,200
That's right.

221
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,100
I saw it
on 20/20.

222
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,600
"Dirty money"?
What do you mean?

223
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,300
Are you telling me
it's counterfeit?

224
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,200
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

225
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,400
No, this
is real.

226
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,200
Whatever it is,
it's a police matter now.

227
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,500
What do you think
we should do?

228
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,400
Somebody should
stay here,

229
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,900
Somebody should go
after the cops?

230
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,400
How you wanna
what? Work it?

231
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Let's think
this through.

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
What?
Hold on!

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,400
What if we didn't
turn it in?

234
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,600
You wanna keep it?

235
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,300
Ha ha ha!
He wants to keep it.

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Well,
that's a hot one.

237
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,500
Why wouldn't we?

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,800
Why wouldn't we?
Yeah.

239
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,500
Because we'd go
to prison.  Why?

240
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,300
Why? Because
it's stealing.

241
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Stealing.
Stealing from who?

242
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,700
From him? Hell,
he won't mind.

243
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,300
Heh heh...

244
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,100
Oh, 'cause he's
dead, right? Ha ha ha!

245
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,200
Ha ha! That's
pretty funny--

246
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,400
He's dead.
He won't mind.

247
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
I say we take this bag
back to the truck,

248
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,500
And we pretend like
we were never here.

249
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Fuck yeah.
Why not?

250
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,800
Why not? Because
we'd get caught.

251
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,400
Aw, hell! I'll
tell you what.

252
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,900
Stay the hell
out of it then.

253
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,500
You know, we
don't need you.

254
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,200
It'd just be more
money for us.

255
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,300
Hey, i don't wanna stump you
another fancy word, lou,

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,900
But does the term "accomplice"
mean anything to you?

257
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,100
Come on. That's stupid.

258
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,700
But, hank, why
would we get caught?

259
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,400
Because it's a lot
of money.

260
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Somebody's bound
to be looking for it.

261
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,000
When they find
that plane

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,700
And the money's
not in it,

263
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
They'll come
bullshit! Looking for us. Bullshit!

264
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,400
This is
dirty money!

265
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,900
And as far as that
guy's concerned,

266
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,600
The cops don't even
know he exists.

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,400
Nobody knows
about this...

268
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
But us.
See there?

269
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,300
Nobody knows
but us.

270
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
It's like we came
out here on a hike,

271
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,400
And found lost treasure.
Right?

272
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,400
It's the american dream
in a goddamn gym bag.

273
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,300
He--He just wants
to walk away from it.

274
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,000
You work for
the american dream.

275
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,000
You don't steal it.

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,400
Then this is
even better.

277
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,900
If this guy's
a dope dealer,

278
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,000
Then--Like we're
talkin' about--

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
Then that means we're
like robin hood.

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,500
Oh, yeah, and i'll
tell you what.

281

You got a beautiful
wife at home.

282

You're about
to have a baby.

283
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,500
I know you ain't
pullin' down that much

284
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,200
At the feed mill.

285
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,100
Wouldn't you love to
have a piece of this?

286
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,900
Hell, yes, i would,
but we can't just take it.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Hey, what if
there's a reward?

288
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,900
Maybe there's a reward,
and they'll give--

289
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,600
Maybe there's not!

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,500
How about this.
I tell you what.

291
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,600
I'll bet you
$10,000--

292
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,300
Just one of
these packets--

293
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
That when they
find this plane,

294
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
There's no mention
of this money.

295
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,000
Hank, why--
Why turn it in

296
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,100
Until we know
whether or not

297
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
Somebody's
lookin' for it?

298
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,600
That's right.

299
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,300
If you scratch,
then don't--Don't itch.

300
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
If you--If it's--

301
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,200
If it's broken,
don't fix it. Right?

302
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,900
Or if you--If--If--
If the--If--If--If--

303
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,700
And i know
what you mean.

304
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,500
[Caw caw]

305
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,200
Suppose i was
the one to keep it?

306
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,100
For how long?

307
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,900
Just till spring,
till they find the plane.

308
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,000
Then what?

309
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,900
Then, if you're right and
nobody mentions the money,

310
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
We split it up,
and we all leave town.

311
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,700
Why should you
get to hold it?

312
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,800
That's the only way
i'll do it.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,700
Otherwise we can just
turn it in right now.

314
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,300
So, what, you mean--
You--You--

315
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,600
You don't trust us?
Is that what you mean?

316
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,100
That's a lot of money.
I guess i don't.

317
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
Look, no--No promises.
If somebody comes searching

318
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,600
For the money,
i'll burn it.

319
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
I'll burn it,
listen, and that's it. Hank...

320
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
No. That's the only way
i'll do this!

321
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,100
Look, we gotta be
agreed on this.

322
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,600
That's the deal.
That's the deal.

323
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,400
I hold onto it, we wait
till they find the plane.

324
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,200
If nobody mentions it,

325
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
We split it up,
and we move away.

326
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Ok?

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm in.

328
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,400
We count it
first.

329
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,100
That's probably
a good idea.

330
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,600
I mean, you know...

331
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
Heh heh heh...

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,300
Heh heh...
heh heh...

333
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
This is nuts.

334
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,500
Oh, my god...

335
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,400
Hey, what you gonna
buy, jakey boy?

336
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm gonna buy me
a truck.

337
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,400
No. Fuck that.

338
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,700
Get something
classy.

339
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,300
Trans-Am.

340
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,900
Oh, yeah, in my wildest
fuckin' dreams, a trans-Am.

341
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,800
You could buy a fleet
of trans-Ams.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,700
Mary beth!
Mary beth!

343
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,200
Where the hell
have you been?

344
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,900
Where you
been, huh?

345
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,800
There's shoes
for baby, ha ha!

346
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,800
Lou:...4,350,000,

347
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,900
4,360,000...
4,370,000...

348
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
4,380,000...

349
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,000
4,390,000...

350
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,800
$4,400,000!

351
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,500
Isn't that great?
Listen to that.

352
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,900
Look at that shit, man.
Look how square it is.

353
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That is cool, huh?

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,300
How much is that
apiece?

355
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
About a million
and a...

356
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
A million
and what? Shh!

357
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,400
A million and
a half? What?

358
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,800
Shh! You
hear that?

359
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Uh-Uh.

360
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,100
Oh, shit.

361
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
Get in the truck.
I'll handle this.

362
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,900
Shit.
Go on!

363
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Hank: let's go!

364
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
Come on, cover up
the money!

365
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Jake, get
in the truck!

366
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,600
Dummy up.
Let's go!

367
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,100
Come on!

368
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,900
Hey, carl.

369
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,000
Engine trouble,
hank?

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
Oh, i wish.
Dog trouble.

371
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,900
Jacob's mutt chased
a fox into the woods.

372
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,500
She tree it?

373
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,800
We thought so, but just
when we went after it,

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,300
She came running back.

375
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,000
Ah.

376
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,600
What'd you do
to your head there?

377
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,700
Oh. God, uh...

378
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,500
Heh. Ran into
a tree branch.

379
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,800
Your brother
still out of work?

380
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Yeah.

381
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,300
Lou?

382
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,400
Yeah, him, too.

383
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,300
That's a shame,
ain't it?

384
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,400
Well, we probably better
be heading back--

385
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,900
Hey, hello, jacob!

386
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,100
Hey, carl,
how you doin'?

387
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,600
Good, good.

388
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
I was beginning
to think

389
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
You were trying
to avoid me.

390
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,100
I'm sorry?

391
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,900
Well, you sittin'
over there in that truck.

392
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,100
I thought you was
trying to avoid me.

393
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
No. Just sittin'
in the truck.

394
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,900
It's a little cold
out here, you know.

395
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Just keepin' warm.

396
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,700
Well, we probably
better be--

397
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,200
Did you tell him
about the plane?

398
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
It sou-Sounded
like a plane.

399
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,600
What plane?

400
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
What, you heard
a plane?

401
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,300
Uh...i don't know
what he heard.

402
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
You know he's always
hearing shit.

403
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,900
Maybe you better
tell me, jacob.

404
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,300
No, that's ok.

405
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,800
We're gonna
get on home.

406
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,800
All right.

407
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,500
All right.
Come on, man.

408
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,200
It's new year's!
Let's get outta here.

409
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Jacob:
call me, carl.

410
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,400
Happy new year.

411
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
Sure you don't
need any help?

412
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
No, we're all set.

413
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
Thanks.
All right.

414
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,600
Goddamn it!

415
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,800
I've seen you do some
pretty stupid things, jacob,

416
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,500
But that pretty much
takes the cake!

417
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,500
It was my idea.

418
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,800
Oh, well, that's
brilliant, lou.

419
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
Now when they find
the plane,

420
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,900
And they realize
the money's gone,

421
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,700
They'll know right off
who took it.

422
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,100
Well, that's--

423
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
That's what's cool
about it, though.

424
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,300
I mean, we wouldn't
tell somebody

425
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,900
If we were the ones
that did it.

426
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,000
It's not like he said

427
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,700
That you actually saw
a plane going down.

428
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,500
Just you thought you
might've heard one

429
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,500
With engine trouble.

430
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
You want me to
burn the money?!

431
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,800
I am not going
to prison over this!

432
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,700
If it looks like there's
even the slightest chance

433
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,300
Of us getting caught,

434
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
I swear to god,
it's all gonna vanish!

435
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,200
You understand?

436
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,000
"It was a pine apple."

437
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,100
Hee hee hee hee hee...

438
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,300
[Groaning] oh, god...
this is gonna be fun.

439
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,400
Woman: where the hell
have you been?!

440
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
You come when
i'm always finished.

441
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
I'm finished,
you asshole!

442
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,700
Hey, nancy!

443
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Don't--
Don't hit--

444
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,900
Don't hit
mary beth.

445
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,500
[Low] remember,
nobody knows about this.

446
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,400
That includes nancy.

447
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
She'll have to find out
about it sooner or later.

448
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,500
She'll wonder where all
the money's coming from.

449
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,600
2 hours late!

450
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,000
Ow! Stop it!

451
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,800
Tell her when we decide
it's safe to keep it,

452
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
But not before then.

453
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,100
Then the same goes
for sarah.

454
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,200
Of course.

455
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,200
[Thunk]

456
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Damn it!

457
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,700
Nancy: come on!

458
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,200
You promised to
shovel the walk,

459
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
You lazy son
of a bitch!

460
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:47,900
Calm down, baby.

461
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,800
I got a good reason
for being late. What?

462
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
See you, lou!

463
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,800
[Indistinct arguing]

464
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,100
You know, i bet
he's telling her.

465
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
That guy can't
keep a secret.

466
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,400
Hey, honey.

467
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Hey.

468
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,000
Where you been?

469
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,100
I was starting to get
worried about you.

470
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Sorry i'm late.

471
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
Oh, that's all right.

472
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,400
Hey.

473
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,900
What happened to your head?

474
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,300
It's ok. It's
just a scratch.

475
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,800
It's all bloody.

476
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,000
Can i ask you something?

477
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,400
Yeah, sure.

478
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,400
What if you were
walking in the woods--

479
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,000
It's not deep.

480
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,600
And you found
a bag full of money,

481
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,300
Let's say $4 million...

482
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,800
Would you keep it?

483
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,500
Of course not.

484
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Here, hold that.

485
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,100
How come?

486
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,800
Well, for starters,
it'd be stealing.

487
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,100
We were talking about
lost money here,

488
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,000
Nobody's looking for it.

489
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,700
$4 million
of lost money...

490
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,200
Yeah.

491
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,900
That nobody's
yeah. Looking for?

492
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,300
Well, so then
whose money is it?

493
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
Yours.

494
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,300
Oh.

495
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Ooh.

496
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,800
It's my money?

497
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,300
But whose money
was it before?

498
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,600
A bank robber's.

499
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,300
So then it's
the bank's money.

500
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
All right, it's, uh,

501
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,000
A drug dealer's.

502
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
It was--

503
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Hank.

504
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,800
I mean, this is
really silly.

505
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,600
Obviously you want me to say
something in particular.

506
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,400
I don't know what it is,

507
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,100
But you want me
to agree with you

508
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,700
Or say that you're right
or something.

509
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,200
But i wouldn't take it.

510
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,700
That's just me. I wouldn't.

511
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,300
It's real.

512
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
If we keep it,
we never have to worry

513
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,100
About money again.

514
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,200
But we don't have to worry
about money now, hank.

515
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,100
You've got a good job.

516
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,900
We don't need it.

517
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,200
Yeah, but nobody gets
hurt by us keeping it.

518
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,900
I mean, that's
what makes it a crime,

519
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,200
Doesn't it?

520
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,100
Somebody getting hurt?

521
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,100
What makes it
a crime

522
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,200
Is that it's
against the law.

523
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,600
It doesn't matter if
somebody gets hurt

524
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,400
Or if they don't.

525
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,900
If you get caught,
you go to jail.

526
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,000
Nobody's
gonna get caught.

527
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,400
The money's the only evidence

528
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,600
That we've done anything wrong.

529
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,400
We sit on it,
we see what happens.

530
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
If somebody comes
searching for it,

531
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Then we just burn it
and that will be that.

532
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,200
There's no risk.

533
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,900
We'll always be
in control.

534
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,900
What about
jacob and lou?

535
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,700
As long as we're
handling the money

536
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,300
They have to let us
call the shots.

537
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,800
It seems...crazy

538
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
Just to give it up.

539
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
I mean, before we know if
anybody's searching for it.

540
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,000
Tv: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

541
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,700
This is it.

542
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
It ain't champagne,

543
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,100
But happy new year.

544
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,300
You have to go back and
return some of the money.

545
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
What?

546
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,200
A lot. Like 500,000.

547
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
You see, that way
when they find the plane

548
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,900
They'll assume nobody's
been there yet.

549
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,200
It'll put us beyond
suspicion.

550
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,100
No one would walk away
from that much money--

551
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,900
Wait a second.

552
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,500
We're gonna keep
the rest?

553
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
You'll have to go
in the morning

554
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,900
So when it storms later
it'll cover your tracks.

555
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,400
You can't tell jacob
though.

556
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,700
What, do you think he'd
go back and take it?

557
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,100
It's--It's just
being careful.

558
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,400
That's what we have
to be from now on.

559
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,500
We have to be careful.

560
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,300
We have to be thinking ahead
all the time.

561
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Ok. Ok.

562
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Ok.

Hey, i screwed up,
i moved the pilot.

Come on, we gotta go put
him back like he was.

Come on,
i need a lookout.

If somebody comes by,

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,900
You pretend you're
changing the tire.

You know,
that's not gonna work.

574

What do you mean
it's not gonna work?

575
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,500
Nobody's gonna believe
that. It's not flat.

576
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,000
You're kinda crafty.

577
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,300
I observe things.

578
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,400
Observe and learn,
my friend.

579

Jacob, what happened,
she die on you?

584
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,800
No, we had a flat.
We had a flat tire.

585
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,600
I fixed it. See? The
new one's on there now.

586
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,200
I took the other one,
the bad one,

587
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,000
And put it in the trunk.

588
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,700
It's back there now,
flat as a pancake.

589
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,000
But it's cool now.
Everything's all right.

590
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,600
You see that god damned fox
come by here about 5 minutes ago

Heading right on down
to the woods?

No, i didn't see a fox.

I didn't see any fox.

Well, if you'd been
standing where i'm sitting

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Why?
We can't do that.

649
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,500
Come on.
We can't do that.

650
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,400
What do you mean
we can't do it?

651
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,100
Because we're gonna
make tracks

652
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,000
And they're gonna see
them and follow 'em. Ok.

653
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,100
It's gonna be like
a crime scene or something.

654
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,900
We're gonna drive the
car back to the bridge.

655
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,300
I'll put him
on the snowmobile

656
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,300
And take him
through the park.

657
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,600
You gotta get there
ahead of me.

658
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,100
So whatever you do, i
don't want you to stop.

659
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,900
I want you to just drive
on by then circle back.

660
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,500
I don't want people to
see you sitting there.

661
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,500
Circle back?
That's right.

662
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,300
That's right.

663
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,600
Come on,
come on now.

664
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,200
They're not gonna
take me away, are they?

665
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,800
You gotta promise me--

666
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,700
Nobody's gonna take
you away, i promise.

667
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,500
But we gotta hurry.

668
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,800
It's gonna be ok,
right, hank?

669
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,300
Come on. We gotta go.

670
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,300
You gonna be there,
right?

671
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,900
I'm gonna be there.
Now just go.

672
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
Go.

Dwight.

678
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
Your brother.

679
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,800
He hit me.

680
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,800
You call the police.

681
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,500
Get the police.

682
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,600
Jacob, what
are you doing?

683
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,100
Come on before
anybody sees.

684
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,700
I'm not gonna
what? Do this.

685
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,200
Well, it's
just stupid.

686
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,900
I mean, if--

687
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,600
See, if we cover it up

688
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
It's just gonna be
worse anyhow.

689
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,100
So, you know,
i'm--I'm just--

690
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,000
Get in the car.

691
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,400
I'm just gonna go and
pull him out, you know?

692
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,100
We're just gonna tell
everybody the truth.

693
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,000
Just gonna tell 'em
about the money

694
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,800
And everything and just
say that i--That i--

695
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,500
You're gonna
leave tracks.

696
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,700
Wait a minute.

697
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,200
This is
my decision.

698
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,400
Mine.

699
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,500
Not yours.

700
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,700
You didn't kill him.

701
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,200
We both did.

702
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,100
What are you
talking about, hank?

703
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
He was alive when you left.

704
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
I smothered him.

705
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,400
I guess that makes it
my decision.

706
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,400
It's gonna be ok.
I mean, it looked real.

707
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,200
And even if--I mean,
let's say it didn't

708
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,600
Look like an accident.

709
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,300
Whatever. I mean...

710
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,700
Why would anyone
think of us?

711
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Your tracks lead
right to the plane.

712
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,800
But it's gonna snow.

713
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,100
Any minute now, it's
gonna start snowing.

714
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,700
Was there any blood?

715
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,500
Blood?

716
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,200
Jacob hit him. Was
there blood anywhere?

717
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,500
Did he get blood
on anything?

718
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,200
Was there blood
on the road or--Or--

719
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,800
I don't remember.

720
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,000
Did you look?
I looked,

721
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,600
But i--I just don't--
It was all hap--

722
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,000
Honey, it's gonna snow.

723
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,400
It's gonna snow

724
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,800
And everything's gonna
be covered up.

725

726
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,400
Shh.

727
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,100
Tv:  he was apparently
trying to cross

728
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,500
Along this bank of snow

729
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,900
When his snowmobile
slipped over the edge

730
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,900
Throwing him into the icy
waters of anders creek.

731
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,100
Wright county deputies
recovered the body

732

Shortly before
4:00 this afternoon.

to this new year

Thanks, tracy.

I wish you hadn't
told jacob.

738
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,200
I wish he still thought
that he did it.

739
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
Does it scare you?

740
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,600
Yeah, it scares me.

741
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,600
What if he tells somebody?

742
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,900
I mean, what i did.

743
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,800
What you did?

744
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,000
Well, i know that
you only did it

745
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,200
Because you felt trapped.

746
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,500
That you couldn't
find any other way.

747
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Would you have done
the same thing?

748
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,400
I mean, if you'd been
there instead of me?

749
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,900
I--I--I just need to
know if it's possible.

750
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,700
Oh, honey.

751
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,200

hank?

Every monday i come down
here, buy 2 bags of feed

Regular as clock work.

2 bags of wheat
4 times a month.

755

That's 8 bags i'm supposed
to be billed for.

756
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,900
I don't know how else
to get through to you.

on a monday, mr. Schmitt.

in the month.

So you came in here 5--

760
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,800
Are you telling me there
were 5 weeks last month?

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,600
No, sir, i'm telling you
there were 5 mondays.

Listen, check that
calendar over there

If you don't believe me,
sir.

769
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I need to talk to you.

770
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,100
Well, i'm a little busy
right now, jacob.

771
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:51,900
What is it?

772
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,500
Ok, listen, can you
meet me at the farm?

773
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,700
What farm?
Our farm.

774
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,600
Look, uh,
what is it?

775
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
On your lunch break.
12:30, ok?

on this, mr. Schmitt?

out there right--

doing here?

Look out!
Ha ha ha ha ha.

783

What the hell'd you
drag me out here for?

784
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,200
Listen to this.
I'm gonna buy it back.

785
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,700
I'm gonna fix it up.
I'm gonna rebuild it

786
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,800
Just like it was
before mom and dad died.

787
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,900
Whoa, whoa. Come on, wait, wait.
We've been through all this.

788
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
We've been over this.

789
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,800
Once we split up the money,
we've gotta leave.

790
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,200
We have to go.

791
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,400
What do you--What do
you want me to do,

792
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,900
Just like that, just
drive off by myself?

793
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,200
Well, i mean,
suppose you stay.

794
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,000
Where are you gonna tell
people you got the money?

795
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,800
Oh, that's easy.

796
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,400
We just tell people
that sarah

797
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,300
Inherited some money.
It's easy.

798
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,900
Nobody around here knows
anything about her family.

799
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,600
You guys coulda just
bought the farm, you know,

800
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,100
And then left me to run it.

801
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,300
It's not gonna work.

802
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,000
I thought this was
gonna make you happy.

803
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Jacob...

804
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,800
Farming? Come on.

805
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,800
You don't just buy a farm.
You gotta--You gotta work it.

806
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,200
You gotta know
about machinery and seed.

807
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,200
I know that.

808
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,600
No, you don't.

809
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,700
Fertilizers, pesticides,
herbicides,

810
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,300
Drainage, irrigation,
the weather?

811
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,200
Come on, you don't know
about any of that stuff.

812
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,500
You're gonna end up
just like dad.

813
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,900
Why do you think he
ended up like that?

814
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,700
I'll tell you how he
ended up like that.

815
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,900
He had 2 mortgages riding
on the place.

816
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
He couldn't make the payments.

817
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,400
Where do you think
the money went?

818
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,400
He was a bad businessman.

819
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,600
Where do you think
the money went?

820
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,300
No, you think he spent
it all on the farm?

821
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,900
I'll tell you exactly
where the money went.

822
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,300
4 years of college, bud.

823
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,300
Yeah, didn't you ever think
about how he paid for that?

824
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,500
Didn't that ever
occur to you?

825
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,600
No, my tuition was--

826
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,200
Listen, i'm supposed
to get the farm!

827
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,100
What do i get?!

828
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,600
I'm supposed
to get the farm.

829
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,600
You got--You got
the whole world. You can...

830
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,900
I don't wanna hear that.

831
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,600
You can go anywhere
you want.

832
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,900
This is what i want.

833
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,800
This is--This is where
i wanna be.

834
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
It's my home, hank.

835
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Shit.

836
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,000
Hey, honey.

837
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,500
What?

838
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,000
I wanna show you
something.

839
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,500
What is it?

840
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,000
I got this.

841
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,700
I had it sent over
from the other branch.

842
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,600
Look. Here it is.

843
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
"Heiress's body
id'd by feds."

844
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
$4.4 million ransom.

845
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,900
You see? This person
nobody knows

846
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,200
Has just disappeared
right into thin air.

847
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,300
Do you recognize one
of them from the plane?

848
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,800
I can't tell.

849
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,900
His face was...

850
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
What?

851
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,600
This changes it.

852
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,700
Why is that?

853
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,200
We can't say it isn't
stealing anymore.

854
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,000
Well, hank, it's
always been stealing.

855
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,400
We just didn't know who
we were stealing from.

856
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,300
We thought it was drug money.

857
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,100
We thought it was money
that we could find--

858
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,100
No, you thought that.

859
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,500
This is good.
I'm glad--

860
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,600
It's good?

861
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,600
Yes, it's good we know
where it's from,

862
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,900
Because i was starting
to get worried.

863
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,300
I thought that it might
be counterfeit or marked.

864
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,700
It might still be marked.

865
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,700
No, it says right here.

866
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,200
Look. Denomination
in unmarked bills.

867
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,500
Unmarked.

868
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You see?

869
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,400
You're just being
paranoid, hank.

870
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,700
It's over. It's good.

871
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,200
Man: sarah?

872
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,900
Would you
come here, please?

873
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,800
Sure. Ok. Just a second.

874
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,900
I'll see you tonight.

875
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
[Banging]

876
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,900
Ha ha ha ha ha.

877
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:33,900
Jesus.

878
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,900
Hey, come on, hank.
Open up.

879
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,400
What the hell
are you doing?

880
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,400
Hey, mr. Accountant.

881
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,100
Well, i've come to make
a tiny withdrawal.

882
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,900
Go home. Turn around
and go home right now.

883
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,800
Oh, come on, it's
freezing out here, hank.

884
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,900
Shh! Keep it down.

885
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,000
Invite me in.

886
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,500
All right,
just for a second.

887
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,400
I don't have time
for this shit.

888
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,100
I gotta get up
and go to work.

889
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,400
I want my share.

890
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,400
What?

891
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,600
I do. I want my share.

892
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,100
I don't have the money here,

893
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,100
And even if i did,
i wouldn't give you any.

894
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
Oh, come on, now.

895
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,900
Look, just because
you have it

896
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,200
Doesn't mean it's yours.
Part of that is my money.

897
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,100
Part of it might be
your money...

898
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,600
If we decide to keep it.

899
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,500
The plan was to sit
on the money

900
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,400
Till we decide that
it's safe to keep it.

901
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,300
Why are you coming over here
with this shit?

902
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,800
All right, look.

903
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,200
I'll tell you what.

904
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,700
Just give me
one packet, ok?

905
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Just one packet.

906
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,200
And i'll come back
later for the rest.

907
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,600
Ask me again, and i'll go
burn it tomorrow morning.

908
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,600
Is that clear?

909
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
Bluff.

910
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,100
What?

911
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,600
It's a bluff.
B-L-U-F-F.

912
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,600
Oh, then why don't you
call it then

913
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,300
And just see what happens?

914
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,800
Yeah.

915
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,100
All right. Ok.

916
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,100
See, jacob told me

917
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,800
A little secret,
mister accountant.

918
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,800
I know what happened
to dwight stephanson.

919
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,600
You drank too much.

920
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
I want one
of those packets.

921
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,200
Well, i told you,
i don't have the money here,

922
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,400
And i hid it away
from the house.

923
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,500
Mm-Hmm. Well,
you know what?

924
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,900
It'd be a shame
if somebody

925
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,600
Was to drop a note
to carl jenkins

926
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,900
Saying there
might just be

927
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,400
A little something
suspicious about

928
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,300
Dwight stephanson's
accident.

929
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,300
He just drove off
that bridge?

930
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,600
Do you believe that?
Do you?!

Come on. Jesus, lou.

932

Remember, you're a thief, too.

933
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,200
We're all in this together.

934
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,700

we all do.

935

936
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,600
I need my share, hank.

937
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,200
I do.

938
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,200
I'm broke...

939
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,200

$40?

945
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,200
That's all i got.

946
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,400
Maybe i can go to the bank

947
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,400
And get you a loan out
of our savings.

948
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,900
Look, look, look.

949
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,700
The money's a day's drive
from here.

950
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,400
Even if i wanted go get it,
i can't go get it,

951
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,600
Not till sarah
has the baby.

952
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,000
A day's drive?!

953
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,600
Yeah, that's right.

954
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,900
I put it in a storage locker
above the interstate.

955
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,600
What the hell is it
doing in a storage--

956
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,300
Shh! It's safe.
Don't worry, all right?

957
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,900
I didn't want it near us

958
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,500
In case we come under
any suspicion.

959
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,000
How the hell's
that gonna happen?

960

about the plane, huh?

Yeah.

All right.

965
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,400
But we go get it as
soon as she's done,

966
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,200
Split it up
right there...right?

00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,100
Hey. I said whoa.

972
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,700
I'm looking
for hank and sarah.

973
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I'm sorry.

974
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,700
Oh, god,
look at this.

975
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:55,800
Jacob: hello.

976
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,900
Do you have a car seat

977
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,600
In the car you'll be
traveling home in?

978
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,800
Yes.
Yes.

979
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,200
Is it currently
installed?

980
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,500
Hello, look who's here

981
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,200
Bearing tidings and gifts
and great joy.

982
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,200
Would you sign here?

983
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,600
Sure.

984
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,100
What do you mean
"gambling"? Where?

985
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,400
At the casino.
He lost some money.

986
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,300
How much?

987
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,700
I don't know
how much.

988
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,300
Shh. Hey,
congratulations.

989
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,500
Woman: thank you.

990
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,200
Congratulations.

991
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,700
Did you see that
little baby?

992
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,900
It looked like
a little tomato.

993
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,800
How could you have
told him that, huh?

994
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,900
I put myself out for you.

995
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,600
What do you do,
you betray me?

996
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,300
What are you
talking about?

997
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,500
What am i talking about?

998
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,800
It's like
there's 2 sides now.

999
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,600
Why are you both always
talking about sides?

1000
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,400
There's no sides.

1001
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,700
Who's talking about sides?

1002
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,800
I'm on both of your sides.

1003
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,400
We're all in this
together, man.

1004
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,300
If you had to pick right now,
who'd it be?

1005
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,100
No, i don't--Why would
i wanna pick?

1006
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,800
No, i wanna know--
Me or lou?

1007
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,800
Good grief, man. I...

1008
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,400
I'd pick you.
You're my brother.

1009
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,300
I bou--I bought
a present for the baby.

1010
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,800
Ok--Ok, i--I brought it
from the house.

1011
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,900
I didn't buy it, but, look,
it's--It's kinda cool.

1012
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,700
Just trust me on this one.

1013
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,900
You're gonna
like it, i think,

1014
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,300
When you see what it is.

1015
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,800
Thanks.

1016
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,600
God, it's used.

1017
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,200
Let me see that.

1018
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,500
Oh, my gosh, this was his
when we were kids.

1019
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,900
Oh, i guess it's sweet
of him then, isn't it?

1020
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,500
Buddy the bear.

1021
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,000
Here's your little girl.

1022
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,900
Oh, good,
good, good.

1023
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,800
Got her?

1024
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,900
She's just about ready
for her feeding.

1025
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,100
Would you grab
that thing?

1026
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,900
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1027
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,600
Hello, little girl.

1028
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Hello.

1029
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,300
She's hungry.

1030
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:40,900
I want you to buy

1031
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,200
One of those little
tape recorders,

1032
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,800
You know, the little
dictating kind,

1033
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,900
The kind you can
hide in your pocket?

1034
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,800
Why do you want
a tape recorder?

1035
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,000
You're gonna tape
lou confessing

1036
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,300
To stephanson's murder.

1037
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,200
What? What are you
talking about?

1038
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,200
[Curtain being drawn]

1039
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
You and jacob invite
him out for drinks.

1040
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,500
Get him drunk.

1041
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,000
You take him back
to his place,

1042
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,800
Then you start
joking around,

1043
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,600
Kidding about confessing
to the police.

1044
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,700
Each of you take a turn
pretending how you'd do it.

1045
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,400
You go first, jacob
second, and lou last,

1046
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,900
And when lou goes,
you tape him.

1047
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,400
Come on,
that's not gonna work.

1048
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
Jacob helps you.
That's the key.

1049
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,200
If jacob eggs him on,
he'll do it.

1050
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,400
Yeah, but even
if he, you know,

1051
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,900
Even if he talks on the tape,
it won't mean anything.

1052
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,700
I mean, who's ever
gonna believe it?

1053
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,300
Well, it doesn't matter
as long as lou believes it,

1054
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,300
As long as he sees that
jacob's taking your side.

1055
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's all you want.

1056
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,400
We should at least try,
shouldn't we?

1057
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,800
We can't lose anything
by trying...right?

1058
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
Hank: come on,
it's not like

1059
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm asking you
to do that much.

1060
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,200
Here, just pick up the phone
and give him a call

1061
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,700
And say, "hey,
lou, hank suggested

1062
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,600
We go out drinking
tomorrow night."

1063
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,100
Hank suggested
we go out drinking?

1064
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
What are talking about?

1065
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:00,800
Will you let me finish?

1066
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,800
We suggest we
go out drinking.

1067
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,900
You don't ever suggest
we go out drinking.

1068
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm getting to that.
Let me finish.

1069
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,600
I'm saying, tell him i've
agreed to split up the money.

1070
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,300
I thought it'd be
a good idea for us

1071
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,200
To--To go out and
celebrate first.

1072
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,100
So you want me
to trick him?

1073
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,200
You want me
to trick lou?

1074
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,600
You want me to
trick my friend?

1075
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,300
Ok.

1076
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,000
Do you get what's
happening here?

1077
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,900
Do you understand
the seriousness

1078
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,600
Of the situation
we're in?

1079
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,200
He can put us both
in jail, jacob.

1080
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,800
He's not gonna
send us to jail.

1081
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,700
Well, i can't take
that chance,

1082
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,900
Not now,
not with the baby.

1083
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,500
I can't afford to
go to prison, jacob.

1084
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,800
I mean, wh-What
about sarah, huh?

1085
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,400
Wh-What are
they gonna do?

1086
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm gonna
have to get rid

1087
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,100
Of that christmas tree
out of here.

1088
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,500
It's too dry. It's
gonna start a fire--

1089
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,200
Would you--Would you
pay attention here?

1090
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,600
Pay attention.

1091
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,900
I'll think about it.

1092
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,900
What would dad do?

1093
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,800
Don't do that,
please, hank.

1094
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,300
Don't you think he'd
want us to stick together?

1095
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,200
Don't--Don't say that.

1096
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,100
I mean,
you don't know

1097
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,100
What the hell
dad would do.

1098
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,700
That's fucked up.
Don't bring him up.

1099
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,100
Well...

1100
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,900
What if i was to say

1101
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,800
I'd help you get
the farm back, huh?

1102
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
All right,

1103
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,900
I'll help you
buy back the farm.

1104
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,200
But you got
to help me first.

1105
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,400
You know, all i meant by
that about the tree is

1106
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's just dried out,

1107
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,500
And it could start
a fucking fire.

1108
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,100
You know how
that stuff goes.

1109
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,800
It wasn't like i was
trying to ignore you

1110
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,600
Or something like that.
I was just, you know,

1111
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,900
I was talking about
practical shit to you

1112
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,300
Is all it was.

1113
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,200
Hank: yeah, we got
that white carpet.

1114
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,500

Hey, sarah.

Hey, jacob.

1118
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,300
I take my shoes off
for you there, see?

1119
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,400
Thank you.

1120
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,200
Oh, uh...

1121
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,700
It's a nice shirt.

1122

Ta-Da! Ha ha.

1123
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,200
Here, let me do that.

[Whispering]
hey, i gotta pee.

1125

Yeah, go ahead.

00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,300
Well, yeah. I invited
him for dinner.

1129
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,900
Oh. Oh! Oh, good.

1130
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,100
Good, good.

1131
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,600
Ok.

1132
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,700
So he's gonna do it?

1133
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,600
I had to promise him
the farm.

1134
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,300
You what? Wait,
i thought you said--

1135
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,100
We agreed that you
were gonna say something.

1136
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,800
Where's he supposed
to go, sarah, huh?

1137
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,500
I mean, what's
he gonna do,

1138
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,300
Drive away?

1139
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,000
I don't know, honey.
I don't know,

1140
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,900
But if he stays,
we get caught.

1141
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,800
I know, i know.
It's just--

1142
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,800
It's just a matter of
time before he screws up.

1143
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,700
I know. That's
not what i'm saying.

1144
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,500
I just...

1145
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,400
I just wish he could,
that's all.

1146
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,200
[Laughter]
[laughter]

1147
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,000
No, no, you remember
what she did?

1148
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,700
She was so freaked out
that she called

1149
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,400
The volunteer
fire department,

1150
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,000
And then, remember,
they came out...

1151
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,700
Oh, yeah, there was
all of dad's buddies--

1152
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,400
All his drinkin'
buddies.

1153
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, yeah.

1154
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,900
That's--That's all the volunteer
fire department was,

1155
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,700
Was guys he knew,
you know?

1156
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,900
So they show up--

1157
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,600
And he's sitting
there in the kitchen

1158
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,500
With that ice pack
on his face.

1159
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,900
That's ridiculous.
He felt like an idiot,

1160
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,000
'Cause they're
all gathered in there

1161
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,800
Like there's some huge
murder going down, you know?

1162
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,100
[Baby cries]

1163
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,300
Shh, shh.

1164
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,700
[Baby cries]

1165
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,800
Ok.

1166
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,800
[Baby cries]

1167
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,100
Well, back on call.

1168
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,600
Hey, how about
some more wine?

1169
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,400
You got a full
glass here.

1170
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,100
What's it like,
a walkie-Talkie, sarah,

1171
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,600
Kind of like a baby
walkie-Talkie?

1172
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,000
Yeah, yeah.
It's kinda cool.

1173
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,800
Remember, we had
that thing we did

1174
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,400
With them little
walkie-Talkies?

1175
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,000
Oh, yeah.

1176
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,500
You got that kit
for christmas.

1177
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,900
Remember that?

1178
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,800
Yeah.

1179
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,200
Yeah.

1180
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,400
You know, it's weird.

1181
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,800
I think--I think
about that stuff.

1182
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,900
I think it's kinda weird--

1183
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,700
You remember everything,
too, don't you?

1184
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,600
Well, yeah.
I was always--

1185
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,000
I was always
talking to dad.

1186
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,000
I know you were.

1187
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,800
I was always figuring out
what's going on, you know?

1188
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,200
I was always nervous about
shit, you know, i guess.

1189
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,200
But i tell you what,
he's a...

1190
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,500
If he--If
he had the still

1191
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,000
Like we got goin' on
right now, you know?

1192
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,100
He would--He would--He
would have done the same thing.

1193
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,800
I don't know,
i don't know.

1194
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,400
I guess so.

1195
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,500
I mean, 'cause
that's what he--

1196
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,500
He always wanted to get
everything set up, you know.

1197
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,200
I mean, he always
wanted to have enough

1198
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,600
To just take care of things
and relax, you know.

1199
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,600
Yeah.

1200
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,000
He never quite had that,

1201
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,700
So i think
he'd a done it.

1202
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,800
But, uh, i tell you what,
he'd still--

1203
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,700
I guarantee you,
if he'd had this,

1204
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,400
He'd still be here.
He'd never have done that.

1205
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,200
Done what?

1206
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,600
Killed hisself,
you know.

1207
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
It just wouldn't
have happened.

1208
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,600
What?

1209
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,600
What are you
talking about?

1210
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,100
Hank, dad killed himself,
you know that?

1211
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,100
What? What are you
talking about?

1212
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,100
Come on, what are
you talking about?

1213
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,000
They were drunk,
they had a wreck.

1214
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,200
That's out on
jack's spur road.

1215
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,500
That's like
that ramp is--

1216
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,100
Where he went every day?

1217
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,600
You ain't gonna roll
away on a ramp like that.

1218
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,100
He'd be on that thing
8,000 times a year, you know.

1219
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,800
You think all of a sudden
he forgot his way?

1220
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,000
Good grief!

1221
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,000
He figured that, you know,
all that insurance money,

1222
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,300
It'd be, you know, it'd
take care of the whole--

1223
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,000
The whole deal that
he wanted to, you know--

1224
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,100
What? No, no.
What? What? Wait--

1225
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,200
You know that, hank.

1226
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,000
I mean, think about it.

1227
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,500
Lou: i guess what
i'm trying to say is,

1228
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,600
Well, maybe i
misjudged you, hank.

1229
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,100
'Cause, i mean,
you're a bit more,

1230
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,900
Well, i don't know,

1231
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,300
Let's--Let's say...

1232
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,100
Serious--Ha ha ha--
Than a guy like me,

1233
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,500
And, you know,
maybe sometimes

1234
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,800
You can come across

1235
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,500
Like you sort of got
a stick up your ass.

1236
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,000
I--I--I mean to--

1237
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,300
To someone who doesn't
really know you,

1238
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:52,900
To--To someone who--

1239
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,500
Who can't get beneath
that first impression.

1240
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,900
And, ok, ok, maybe...

1241
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:01,000
Maybe sometimes,

1242
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,400
Well...

1243
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,600
I can come off a little bit
like an asshole.

1244
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,200
You think?
No, come on.

1245
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,700
Yeah. Oh, no, no, no! No.

1246
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,100
I know what
i'm talking about.

1247
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But fuck it. Ha ha.

1248
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:17,600
Yeah.

1249
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,200
It's all in
the past, right?

1250
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,300
What do you say?

1251
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,500
Come on.

1252
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,400
Sounds good
to me.

1253
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,500
Hell, yes.
Live and let live.

1254
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,100
Live and
let live.

1255
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,500
I gotta take a leak.

1256
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,100
Don't look at me
like that.

1257
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,500
Whoo!

1258
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,500
Jerk!

1259
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,500
What, you think
that's funny?

1260
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,500
Ahh!

1261
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,700
Ahh, what, huh?
I'm asking you,

1262
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,100
You think it's
funny tripping a guy

1263
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,600
On the way to
the fucking can?

1264
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,500
Look, buddy--

1265
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,000
Oh, don't buddy me!
What the--

1266
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,700
See, that right here
is my buddy.

1267
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,100
This guy right
here is my buddy.

1268
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,400
You're not my fucking
buddy, huh, you got it?

1269
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,000
Come on up here.
Come on up here.

1270
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,900
I'll kill--Come on!

1271
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,900
Come on.
Come on.

1272
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:10,800
It's not
worth it.

1273
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,500
Come on out here,
right out in front.

1274
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,100
I'll paint you up and down
the fucking sidewalk,

1275
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,200
Motherfucker!

1276
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:16,800
Yeah, yeah.

1277
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,300
Oh, shut
the fuck up, ray!

1278
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,100
Get out, asshole!

1279
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
You know what? You--
You shit in one hand.

1280
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,400
You better get
the fuck out of here!

1281
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,900
[Laughter]
[laughter]

1282
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,800
Lou: so, listen,
if you got to pee,

1283
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,100
Pee out here.

1284
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,400
Lou: so--So anyway,

1285
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,700
This one guy, see,
he steps forward

1286
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,000
And he says, uh,

1287
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,700
He says,
"you know what?

1288
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,400
"The guy was ok

1289
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,800
"Until we twisted
his head back around,

1290
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,500
And then he just
fucking died on us."

1291
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,700
You get it?

1292
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
Get it?

1293
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,300
Hey,
i got one.

1294
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,200
Ah, shit.

1295
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,800
This old drunk
was telling jokes

1296
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,600
To his 2 drunk friends,

1297
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,400
And he was
keeping up his wife,

1298
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,900
Who, unlike him, had a job
to go to in the morning.

1299
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,400
So, see, she gets
so fucking fed up,

1300
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,400
She comes downstairs
and she says,

1301
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,800
"If he doesn't shut up,

1302
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,500
"He's gonna have to find
some other place

1303
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,100
To live rent-Free."

1304
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,100
Do you get that one?

1305
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,400
No, listen, babe--

1306
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:27,900
Get it, guys?

1307
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,100
Hey, baby,
come on, now.

1308
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:29,900
We're just drinking.

1309
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,100
Come on, what
are you waiting for?

1310
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,300
I don't want to
be here all night?

1311
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,300
Let's get this over with.

1312
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,600
I won't do it, hank.

1313
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,200
What?

1314
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,900
It's not fair.

1315
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,200
We had a deal.

1316
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,900
It's not right.

1317
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,000
It's not right.

1318
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,400
Ah, dummy up.

1319
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,600
Better just keep it
down a little bit.

1320
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,900
Don't say anything.

1321
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,400
Oh, shit, oh, shit,
oh, shit.

1322
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,700
You know how it is.

1323
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,800
What the fuck's wrong
with you, hank?

1324
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,200
Do you see this?

1325
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,600
You see the way
this boy drinks?

1326
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,100
You see hank take a
drink of that whiskey?

1327
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,900
It's like--It's like...

1328
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,300
Ha ha ha ha.

1329
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,200
Like--Like in,
you know, like--

1330
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,600
What is it like--

1331
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,000
Like some kind
of commercial--

1332
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:18,900
Ha ha ha ha.

1333
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,400
For preparation h
of the mouth?

1334
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,300
Like he lives
on primrose lane?

1335
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,100
You look like

1336
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,700
Some goddamn bird
or something.

1337
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,500
You gonna start
playing big brother now,

1338
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,100
Teach me how to
drink my whiskey?

1339
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,000
Ha ha ha ha.

1340
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,900
Did you ever see anybody
drink like that before?

1341
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,100
No, to tell you
the truth,

1342
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,400
I don't believe
i've ever seen

1343
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,900
Anybody drink
like that before.

1344
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,700
I don't--I don't
drink like that,

1345
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,600
My dad didn't
drink like that.

1346
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,300
Uh-Oh.

1347
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,000
You know, we don't have
one thing in common,

1348
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,200
Me and him,

1349
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,600
Except maybe
our last name.

1350
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,200
You're more
like a brother to me

1351
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,400
Than he is.

1352
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,200
Oh! Ha ha ha.

1353
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,300
Do--Do him
crossing the field.

1354
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,500
Ha ha ha ha.
Do it.

1355
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,600
He won't care.
Come on,

1356
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,300
You don't care,
do you, hank, huh?

1357
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,500
Crossing the field?

1358
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,300
Uh, crossing the field.

1359
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,100
Lou:
get up, get up!

1360
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,700
Do like you
did that night,

1361
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,500
The snow,
he had...

1362
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,200
It's just like, uh,
say, what was it?

1363
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,600
Ok.

1364
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,300
And--And--The way
it starts out

1365
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,100
Like he's walking across, like,
that fucking, like, uh,

1366
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,000
Like he's a quail
or some shit.

1367
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,800
Hey! Ha ha ha ha.

1368
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,500
Ha ha ha ha.

1369
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,000
Hey, guys, come on,
you know--

1370
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,400
Hey, wait up,
wait up.

1371
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,300
Wait for me.

1372
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,900
I--I--I'm
not dressed right.

1373
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You're only wearing
your pissy little loafers.

1374
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,800
You know?

1375
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,000
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1376
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,500
Do him when--
Do him when

1377
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,000
The crow
flies out

1378
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,400
And--And pecks
him in the head.

1379
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,300
That's good.

1380
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,700
No, that's fucked up.

1381
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,600
It's like--
That was like...

1382
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,500
Ha ha ha ha.

1383
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,400
You know...

1384
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,100
The fucking thing
wasn't electric, shit.

1385
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,600
Ha ha ha ha.

1386
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,000
You know,

1387
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,400
We shouldn't--
We shouldn't ever

1388
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,700
Let him keep that money.

1389
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,800
Ha ha ha ha.

1390
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,300
No, i'm not shitting.

1391
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,200
We shouldn't--We shouldn't
have done that.

1392
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,100
We should have never
let him keep that money.

1393
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,600
Look how he's
looking at us,

1394
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,300
Like he's fucking better
and everything.

1395
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,500
Like--Like--Like
you own us or something.

1396
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,100
I think we've all
had too much to drink.

1397
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:14,600
Let's call it a night.

1398
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,300
You're gonna keep the
money and shit, you know.

1399
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,300
Let's all go home.

1400
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,100
That's what--That's what you
wanted, wasn't it, hank?

1401
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,600
You wanted me
to pick sides.

1402
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,700
Isn't that
what you said?

1403
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,000
What are you
talking about?

1404
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,100
Yeah, you know--You know--
You know what--

1405
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,400
You know what
he's going to do?

1406
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,200
He's gonna--He's gonna
crawl into carl's office

1407
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,200
Like--Like, on his belly
like a fucking snake.

1408
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,400
He's gonna
end up confessing.

1409
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,200
You know what,
you're right.

1410
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,400
I bet you would rat on us
just to get off the hook,

1411
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,200
Now, wouldn't ya?

1412
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,900
Take--Take me home,
man. Let's go.

1413
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,400
I don't want
to stay here.

1414
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,500
I gotta get home.

1415
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,900
No, huh,
you know what? Wait.

1416
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,700
Come on, take home.

1417
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,600
Uh, no! We got--We got
something else for you, hank.

1418
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,600
I tell you what?
Let's do this.

1419
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,100
Let's do--Let's do
more playacting,

1420
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,500
And let's do it where he--

1421
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,900
Where hank confesses, ok,

1422
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,900
To carl, all right?
This is gonna be cool.

1423
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,400
You be--And you be hank
and i'll be carl. No.

1424
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,100
No, you do--You do it.

1425
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,500
You go out and be hank,

1426
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,000
Like you'd knock
on carl's door.

1427
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:05,800
I can't do
anything like him.

1428
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,700
But when you're fucked up,
you're funny as shit.

1429
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,800
Come on, do it.

1430
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,400
Ok.

1431
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,000
And you're knocking
on the door--

1432
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:11,700
Ok.

1433
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,400
And i'm, like, sitting
here doing paperwork

1434
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,800
And dumb ass comes in, ok?

1435
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,700
Dumb ass comes in with his
tail between his legs, ok?

1436
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,300
Ok, here,
i'm coming in.

1437
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,800
You ready?

1438
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:21,800
Jacob: ok.

1439
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Hello?

1440
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,400
Carl...

1441
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,800
It's hank mitchell.

1442
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,100
Well, hey, hank,
how you doing?

1443
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,300
Hey, how you doing?

1444
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,100
Jacob:
sit--Sit down.

1445
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,600
I need to
talk to you.

1446
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,000
Yeah, ok, what about?

1447
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,500
[Sighs]

1448
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,800
It's about
dwight stephanson.

1449
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,900
Yeah?

1450
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,600
He didn't die
in an accident.

1451
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,200
What are you
talking about?

1452
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,600
No, no, i killed him.

1453
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,400
Jacob: you killed
dwight stephanson?

1454
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,700
That's right.

1455
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,400
I suffocated him
with his own scarf,

1456
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,800
And then i just shoved
him off the bridge

1457
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,400
Into anders creek.

1458
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,000
I made it look
like an accident.

1459
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,900
Well, why would you
do something like that?

1460
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,800
That--That's ok. We don't
really want to hear that.

1461
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,000
$4 1/2 million

1462
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,200
Is worth a hell of
a lot more to me

1463
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,700
Than some
old man's life.

1464
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,400
All right,
that's enough.

1465
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,200
I'm up to the part
where you're gonna agree

1466
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,500
To testify
against us, ok?

1467
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,000
Can i just do that?

1468
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,300
Come on--

1469
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,500
Lou's voice: i killed him.

1470
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,200
Jacob's voice: you
killed dwight stephanson?

1471
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,100
Lou's voice: that's right.

1472
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,800
I suffocated him
with his own scarf,

1473

And then i just shoved
him off the bridge

You taped this?

Lou's voice: i made it
look like an accident.

[Tape stops]

1478
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,700
Well, why would you
do that, hank?

1479
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:37,700
It's your confession.

1480
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,600
It's you saying how you
killed dwight stephanson.

1481
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Nobody's going
to believe that.

1482
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,300
I mean--I mean,
it's obvious

1483
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,900
I'm just kidding
around on there,

1484
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,300
Isn't it, jacob?

1485
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,700
Why--Why would
anybody believe it?

1486
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,700
I mean, let's just
think about this.

1487
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:52,900
If--If you and i

1488
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,600
Both go into carl's office
tomorrow afternoon

1489
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,400
And we both claim the other
killed dwight stephanson,

1490
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,300
Who--Who do you think he's
gonna believe, huh? You?

A 40-Year-Old unemployed
high school dropout,

1492

him the town drunk, or me?

1493

I've got a job.

at my wife in public.

I don't pass out on
other people's doorways.

1497
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,700
I wonder who
he's gonna believe?

1498
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,400
Yeah.

1499
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,100
Now we're all back
in the same boat again,

1500
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,300
Isn't that right, jacob?

Hank: you seem
to have forgot

Hank:
that's all it is.

1506
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,800
You know, it's
not to hurt you.

1507
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,900
That--That's
what hank said.

1508
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,400
It's just so
you don't hurt him.

Are you--Are you
telling me

You knew about
this, jacob?

Lou: you saying you
knew about this?

1517

He isn't going to
use it, unless, uh--

Is that what--

1519

Is that what you're
saying here, jacob?

That--That--That
you two worked together?

buy back the farm, lou.

And lou started pushing
nancy around.

When we tried to stop him,
he got really pissed off,

grabbed his shotgun.

He shot at me,
but he missed.

1664

So he aimed
the shotgun at my chest,

And just before
he pulled the trigger...

01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,700
Only i don't think
i should be here

1764
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,400
In the baby's room.

1765
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,900
It's--It's clean
in here.

1766
01:19:58,100 --> 01:19:59,000
[Baby crying]

1767
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,700
What? It's ok. The baby
sleeps with us.

1768
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,500
Hey, you remember this?

1769
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,800
Everything goes to sleep.

1770
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,400
Your head goes to sleep.

1771
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,300
Remember when dad
used to do that?

1772
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,000
Your head goes to sleep.

1773
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:14,700
Your shoulders
go to sleep.

1774
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,700
Your arms go to sleep.

1775
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,500
Your back goes to sleep.

1776
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,300
Hank, do you ever
feel evil?

1777
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,400
I do.

1778
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,900
I feel evil.

1779
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,100
You know, maybe i can get
a family of my own now.

1780
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,500
I mean, with
the money and all.

1781
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,100
Why? Don't you think
somebody would marry me

1782
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:13,800
If i'm rich?

1783
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,600
You don't need
money for that.

1784
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,200
Hank.

1785
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,300
Hey, come on.

1786
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,700
What about...

1787
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,300
What was her name?

1788
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,500
Carrie richards?

1789
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,400
She liked you

1790
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,000
Even though
you were broke-Dick.

1791
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,800
Oh, her. Yeah.

1792
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,100
That was a whole
different deal.

1793
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,900
That was...

1794
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:34,800
Her--Her friends,

1795
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,500
They pitched in
100 bucks altogether

1796
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:39,400
And betted her

1797
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,300
That she wouldn't go steady
with me for a month.

1798
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,400
Jesus, jacob.

1799
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,800
I...

1800
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,600
I thought you guys
had a thing.

1801
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,600
I don't know. It...

1802
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,600
It weren't that bad.

1803
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,900
I mean, actually,
it was kind of cool.

1804
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,900
We used to walk around
together a lot, you know.

1805
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,600
Take walks, you know?

1806
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
And, uh, we talked about
all kinda cool stuff.

1807
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,700
I held hands with her
one time.

1808
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,400
We were walking around,

1809
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:25,800
But my hand sweated so much
she kinda had to let it go.

1810
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,400
I was nervous, i guess.

1811
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:31,900
But it was cool.

1812
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:34,000
When the month was over,
she, uh...

1813
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:37,300
You know, kinda would
say hi to me sometimes

1814
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,100
In the hallway
when i'd see her.

1815
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,800
She didn't have
to do that.

1816
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,700
That was cool of her.

1817
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,000
God, hank, you know,
i've never--

1818
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,200
I've never even
kissed a girl before.

1819
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,700
And you know what?

1820
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,100
If being rich
will change that,

1821
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,400
I'm all for it.

1822
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,900
I don't care.

1823
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,400
I just wanna
feel it, you know?

1824
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,000
I just wanna know what
people do, you know?

1825
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,100
I don't care if it's
'cause of the money.

1826
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,400
Hank?

1827
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,900
I'm gonna be happy
now, right?

1828
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,800
Sure you are.

1829
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,000
We all are.

1830
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,100
Yeah, that's right.

1831
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,700
We all are.

1832
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,000
You know what?

1833
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,500
I'm gonna, you know,
buy back the farm,

1834
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:40,800
You know?

1835
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,000
And have, uh...

1836
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,200
And have a lot of kids,

1837
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,500
'Cause i'll meet
this nice girl

1838
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,700
And she'll be
really cool to me

1839
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,100
And be really nice.

1840
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,700
Just normal, a normal
woman, you know.

1841
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,100
And, uh...

1842
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,700
And then you and sarah
will come over

1843
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,900
And bring amanda,

1844
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,500
And we'll all sit around
and tell stories and stuff.

1845
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,200
We'll drink on the porch

1846
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,800
Like dad and uncle ted
used to do.

1847
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,000
You know?

1848
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,200
Yeah.

1849
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,100
He nod off
on you, jack?

1850
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,600
Hey, carl.

1851
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:54,100
Gettin' a bit thin
up top there, hank.

1852
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,600
Don't you have
any crimes to solve?

1853
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,100
Maybe.

1854
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,300
Think you could
track down jacob,

1855
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,800
Bring him by my office
tomorrow afternoon?

1856
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,200
Sure. What for?

1857
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,600
Man from the fbi's gonna
be driving through.

1858
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,700
Thought you two might
be able to help him out.

1859
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,100
Seems they're looking
for a lost plane.

1860
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:18,200
Huh.

1861
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,700
See ya about 3:00.

1862
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:23,900
You bet.

1863
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,300
Hank: maybe we
should just leave.

1864
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,800
Take the money
and the baby

1865
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:37,100
And just leave
the country.

1866
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:39,000
Stop it, hank.

1867
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,500
You'll go in there

1868
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,700
And you'll see
what he knows.

1869
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:42,500
If anything looks bad,

1870
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:43,400
We can always
move the money.

1871
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,000
It's still the only thing
tying us to anything.

1872
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,700
The connections are just
under the surface.

1873
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,500
Sarah, i mean,
think about it.

1874
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,100
It wouldn't be
that hard

1875
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,000
For somebody to just
put it all together.

1876
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,900
There's the plane
and...

1877
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,500
And stephanson.

1878
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,800
There's lou
and nancy.

1879
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,600
You've gotta remember
how people see you.

1880
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,600
You're just
a normal guy,

1881
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,000
A nice, sweet,
normal guy.

1882
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,200
They're gonna know.

1883
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,700
No, they won't.

1884
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,800
Nobody would
ever believe

1885
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,600
That you'd be capable
of doing what you've done.

1886
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,400
Hank: well, it was
snowin' pretty hard,

1887
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,300
So we're not
really sure,

1888
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,200
But it sounded
kinda like

1889
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,700
An engine cuttin'
on and off.

1890
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,500
But that was it.

1891
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,900
We didn't hear
anything more.

1892
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,300
No...no crash.

1893
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,600
No engine.

1894
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:30,900
Nothing.

1895
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,500
Anything you want
to add to that, jacob?

1896
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:40,700
No.

1897
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,100
I can't think
of anything.

1898
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,600
That's about it.

1899
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,100
It was probably
a snowmobile or something.

1900
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:48,800
You know?

1901
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,000
Well, guess
that's it, guys.

1902
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,400
Thanks for comin'.

1903
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,800
My pleasure, carl.

1904
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,400
Good to see you,
carl.

1905
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,800
Nice to have met you.
I'll talk to you later.

1906
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,200
Do you think you could
take us out there?

1907
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,300
To the nature preserve?

1908
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,300
Have to go
in the morning, i guess,

1909
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,100
After the storm passes.

1910
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,200
C-Can you tell us what
this is all about?

1911
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,000
Lookin' for a plane.

1912
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,600
Sarah: there's no way

1913
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,200
It's from the armored
car robbery.

1914
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,400
This isn't a guess,
honey.

1915
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,900
The guy from the fbi
told me.

1916
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:36,900
[Timer dings]

1917
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,700
It doesn't
make sense.

1918
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,000
The kidnapping
made sense.

1919
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,400
He's looking for a plane
full of money.

1920
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,500
I mean, how many of those
can there be around here?

1921
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,800
It was hundred-Dollar
bills, hank.

1922
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,300
If it was an armored
car robbery,

1923
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,900
There'd be other
denominations.

1924
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,600
There'd be 50s
and 20s and 10s.

1925
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,300
Well, congratulations,
sarah.

1926
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,100
I guess you know more
than the fbi.

1927
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:03,900
Hank?

1928
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,900
Did he show you
his badge?

1929
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,100
Why would he show me
his badge?

1930
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,400
Wait.

1931
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,200
It's him, isn't it?

1932
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,400
It's the older one--
Vernon.

1933
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,200
He's looking
for his brother.

1934
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,900
I guy i met today
was skinner.

1935
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,500
He didn't have
a beard.

1936
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,100
Well, maybe he lost weight.
Maybe he shaved.

1937
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,300
Well, that doesn't make
a difference, does it?

1938
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,000
I mean, no matter
who he is,

1939
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,000
I still have to take him
to the plane.

1940
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:45,800
Well, if we think it's him,
you shouldn't go.

1941
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,000
Why not?

1942
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,100
Because he's gonna shoot
all 3 of you, hank.

1943
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,500
As soon as he
sees the plane.

1944
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,700
That's why
he wants you to go,

1945
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:54,000
So he can get rid
of the witnesses.

1946
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,600
But if he's really
from the fbi,

1947
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,700
And i don't show up,

1948
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,200
It's gonna look
suspicious as hell.

1949
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,000
I'll call the fbi
in the morning.

1950
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,300
I'll ask for
an agent baxter.

1951
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,900
That won't work.
I'm meeting him at 9:00.

1952
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,600
They won't be open
before that.

1953
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,500
You can stall them
for a bit.

1954
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,200
And, uh, i'll call
from here,

1955
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,200
And then i'll call you
at carl's office.

1956
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,700
And what if there's
no agent baxter?

1957
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:20,700
Then what?

1958
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:21,700
Well, then you
won't go.

1959
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:25,000
You can tell carl
that the baby's sick

1960
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,100
And...and that you
have to come home.

1961
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,000
What about jacob?

1962
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,100
Say he's hung over.

1963
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,600
Carl would believe that.

1964
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,000
Whoever the guy is,

1965
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,500
You don't
want jacob there.

1966
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,200
It sounds like
a b.S. Excuse.

1967
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,800
Hank, what do
you want?

1968
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,000
Well--
What do you want?

1969
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,600
Do you want to just
walk out there

1970
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,100
And get shot
by this guy?

1971
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,500
No, i don't wanna
walk out there

1972
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,100
And get shot!

1973
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,900
Well, i'm trying
to come up with a plan.

1974
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,600
A plan? Like the one

1975
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,600
To take the money
back to the plane,

1976
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,300
And we end up
killing stephanson?

1977
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,000
Or maybe the one
where we tape lou,

1978
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,700
And 2 more people
end up dead.

1979
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,300
Is that the sort of plan
you're thinking of?

1980
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,100
Well, i've got a plan!

1981
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,800
I'm taking the money
back right now--

1982
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:08,400
All of it.

1983
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,300
Hank.
No!

1984
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,400
I'm gonna
put it back,

1985
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,400
And everything's
gonna be

1986
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,800
Just like
it used to be.

Is that what
you think?

Is that what you
think you want?

You wanna be happy?

2243
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:37,300
You want
a wife and kids?

2244
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,700
Me and you sitting
around on the porch

2245
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,200
Drinking late at night?

2246
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,200
Well, god damn it,

2247
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,700
This is what it costs--

2248
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:49,800
Right here, right now.

2249
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,700
Come on.

2250
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:57,300
Come on.

2251
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,800
Let's go over this again,

2252
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,600
Make sure we haven't
overlooked anything.

2253
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:05,400
I wish somebody else
had found that money.

2254
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,000
Well, they didn't.
Now quit.

2255
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:18,300
Ok. Baxter
came down here.

2256
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:21,600
He came up
behind carl.

2257
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,500
I was over there.

2258
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,500
Yeah, and you were
in the woods.

2259
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:28,800
Yeah. Yeah.

2260
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:32,400
Yeah. It's gonna work.

2261
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,300
It's gonna work.
Yeah.

2262
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,600
W-What are you doing?

2263
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,300
Now put this back.

2264
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:48,400
Make it look like
the bad guy did it, hank.

2265
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:53,000
What?

2266
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,800
W-We're almost home.

2267
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:57,800
I'm tired, hank.

2268
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:03,800
A-A-And i don't care.

2269
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:05,400
It's ok with me.

2270
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:06,600
I'm not--I'm not afraid.

2271
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:10,700
No, jacob.

2272
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:12,000
I'm not afraid.
It's perfect.

2273
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:13,000
Stop that, jacob.

2274
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,200
It's--It's perfect.

2275
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:14,600
No. No.

2276
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,400
Come on, hank.
Let me do something.

2277
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:18,000
This is--
This is the only thing.

2278
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,800
See, i don't wanna sit around
the rest of my life

2279
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,700
Thinking about this shit.
I can't do it--

2280
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:22,900
Sit on the porch
and drink.

2281
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,700
I can't do it,
so you're gonna have to do it.

2282
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,100
Couple more hours,
we'll be home.

2283
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,500
You can do this, and it's
gonna be perfect for you.

2284
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:29,800
And you got something--

2285
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:32,100
You got something to go on for,
hank, and you know it.

2286
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,300
I don't wanna be here.

2287
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:37,100
No.

2288
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:38,900
No. Please, no.

2289
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,100
Come on, hank.
Let me do something.

2290
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,800
You just tell
the little girl that i--

2291
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,900
That, you know, that bear--
Bear is from me.

2292
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,000
You know?

2293
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,900
If you love me, hank,
you'll do it.

2294
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:08,400
I'll give you a chance.
I won't look at you.

2295
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:12,600
I won't look at you, hank,
but if you don't do it...

2296
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,200
Then i'm gonna do it,

2297
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:18,100
And then we're gonna both
gonna be fucked, aren't we?

2298
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:25,600
We don't need
to both be fucked.

2299
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:28,400
I'll--I'll do it, hank,
if you don't. No!

2300
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,000
I'm telling you i will.

2301
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:40,500
Boy, it's--It's funny

2302
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,300
About f-Finding
this fucking plane, wasn't it?

2303
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:49,800
Jacob!

2304
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:05,900
[Sobbing]

2305
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:10,800
Oh, jacob!

2306
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:37,900
To someone who's
been properly trained,

2307
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:39,900
There are many ways
to detect a liar.

2308
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,500
The shifty eyes
of detective novels

2309
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,400
Have a certain
basis in fact.

2310
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,300
A wooden
or stilted tone.

2311
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:50,100
Gestures that seem
either slightly robotic

2312
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:52,100
Or else
unnecessarily expansive.

2313
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:56,000
Details tend to be
vague, slippery.

2314
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,800
Sometimes the suspect
will cover his mouth

2315
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,000
With his hand
when he speaks.

2316
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,500
Did you notice
anything like that

2317
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,000
In the guy
you shot today?

2318
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:09,000
He was lying to you,
mr. Mitchell.

2319
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,700
He wasn't
from the fbi.

2320
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,200
His name was
vernon bokovsky.

2321
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:13,700
His brother was in
that crashed plane

2322
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:15,300
You found
out there today.

2323
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,700
Bokovski
and his brother

2324
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,100
Were the guys
who kidnapped

2325
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,500
That mcmartin girl
last november.

2326
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:21,300
Remember the one they shot
and dumped in the lake?

2327
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:24,200
4.4 million
in ransom money.

2328
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:25,700
Want to touch it?

2329
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,700
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

2330
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:31,400
[Laughs]

2331
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:32,400
Pretty hefty,
huh?

2332
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:33,400
That's only part of it.

2333
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:34,800
We're still
tracking down the rest.

2334
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:36,500
Yeah. It's just
a matter of time.

2335
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,900
A matter of time?

2336
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,500
Well--Well, we had
the money for 2 hours

2337
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:42,300
Before the kidnappers
picked it up.

2338
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:43,100
Couldn't mark it.

2339
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,900
We were afraid they'd
detect the markings

2340
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,400
And kill the girl,
so, um...

2341
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,200
We put together
a task force of 20 agents,

2342
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,100
And they wrote down

2343
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:51,800
As many of the serial
numbers as they could.

2344
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,400
We managed to record
just

2345
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,300
That's 1 out of 10
of the bills.

2346
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,300
Now it's simply a matter

2347
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,000
Of waiting for
the numbers to turn up.

2348
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,500
Can't go around
passing $100 bills

2349
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:06,400
Without eventually sticking
in someone's memory.

2350
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:13,300
Sarah: no. No.

2351
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:16,100
No, hank. Hank!
Oh, hank!

2352
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:18,100
Hank, we can
run with it.

2353
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,400
We could leave
the country.

2354
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,100
We could go
to south america

2355
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,700
Or to australia
or someplace far away.

2356
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,300
Please, hank!

2357
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,700
Aah! Aah.

2358
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:26,800
There are days

2359
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,100
When i manage not to think
of anything at all...

2360
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:32,700
Not the money...

2361
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,200
Or the murders...

2362
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,500
Or jacob...

2363
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:41,600
Days when sarah and i

2364
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,500
Try to pretend that we're
just like everyone else...

2365
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:47,000
As if none of it
had ever happened.

2366
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,800
But those days
are few and far between.

2367
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:23,800
