They don't actually come
into the dream.
他不必真正M入到粞Y，
他只要…

249
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,140
They just design the levels
他只要O好每一拥艟常

That's all.

Mal won't let me.

Come back to reality, Dom.

Those kids, your grandchildren...
我的孩子、你的外O，

...they're waiting for their father

他正等著他的父H回家，

257

That's their reality.
@就是他的F。

And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.
@工作、@最K的工作，

259
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,970
I would not be standing here

我不站在@Y的，
要是我知道有e的什Nk法。

260
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:36,842
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.
我需要O，

00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:42,647
I've got somebody better.

262
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,999
Ariadne?

00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,989
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

If you have a few moments,
如果你有crg，

Mr. Cobb has a job offer

I have a test for you.

You're not gonna tell me

你不想先透露我c
那是什N拥墓ぷ鳎

Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.
在我描述@份工作之前，
我得先知道你必能偃巍

272
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,910
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
- 槭颤N？
- 栏竦卣f它不太合法。

273
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,485
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.
o你煞昼rgO出一

274
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,551

Stop.
停。

277
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,898
You're gonna have to do better than that.
你得加把挪判邪　

278
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,178
That's more like it.
@差不多。

279
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,369
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.
一般J槲只是部分地利用了
我大X的真正的能，

280
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,237
Now, that's when we're awake.
然，那是指我醒著的r候；

281
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,375
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.
我在睡眠中，我的^X
缀蹩梢宰鋈魏问虑椤

282
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,474
Such as?
比如f？

283
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:19,646
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.
O想你正在O一座建B，
你有意R地造它的方方面面。

284
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,630
But sometimes, it feels like
it's almost creating itself,
但有的r候，你X得那些造
自然而然地就a生了，

285
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:23,751
if you know what I mean.
你明白我的意思幔

286
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:25,924
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.
是的，像是我o意撞的。

287
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,221
Genuine inspiration, right?
真正的`感，幔

288
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,865
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.
如果是在粞Y，我的^X
Bm不嗟刈鲋@拥氖拢

289
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,671
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.
我一造，同r
一感知我的世界，

290
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:40,231
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.
我的^X做得如此出色，
以至於我甚至都不知道l生了什N。

291
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,334
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.
那使得我能
直接介入@一^程之中。

292
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,889
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.
- 怎N介入？
- 通^起造的角色。

293
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:47,479
Now, this is where I need you.
@Y就是我需要你的地方了：

294
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,996
You create the world of the dream.
你造出糁械氖澜纾

295
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,670
We bring the subject into that dream,
我把主w入那簦

296
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,418
and they fill it
with their subconscious.
然後他用自己的意R
充M那艟场

297
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,406
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?
我怎N可能@得足虻募
好他J槟蔷褪钦娴模

298
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:04,131
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?
我做的簦感X都很真，
只要我是在粞Y，N？ 

299
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:08,661
It's only when we wake up that we
realize something was actually strange.
只有我醒了之後，
才意R到有些|西其很奇怪。

300
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,629
Let me ask you a question.
我你}：

301
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:14,341
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?
你…你砘不起
某舻拈_^，幔

302
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,535
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.
你只得糇龅揭话耄
然後就嗔说哪且徊糠帧

303
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:18,744
I guess, yeah.
我想是的，是@印

304
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,639
So how did we end up here?
那N我怎N在@旱模

305
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:22,978
Well, we just came from the, uh...
唔，我是摹呃……

306
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,847
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?
仔想想，<u>阿Y阿德涅</u>，
你怎N磉@旱模

307
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,948
Where are you right now?
你F在究竟在哪海

308
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,558
We're dreaming?
我在做簦

309
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,143
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.
你H上F在正在
一g工S人X，

310
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:39,959
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
@是你分享艟车牡谝徽n。
e慌。

311
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,991
If it's just a dream,
then why are you?
如果@只是一簦
那你槭颤N……？

312
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,032
Because it's never just a dream, is it?
因楦杏X完全不像是在做簦是不是？

313
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,550
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
M的碎玻璃渣，疼得要命。

314
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,613
When you're in it, it feels real.
只要你在粞Y，感X就很真。

315
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,961
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.
@就是槭颤N方
研l出了艟撤窒硐到y，

316
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,360
It was a training program
for soldiers to shoot,
他有目，
士兵互相射簟

317
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,211
stab and strangle each other 
and then wake up.
刺、和扼死，最後再醒^怼

318
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,214
How did architects become involved?
O在其中起什N作用？

319
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,019
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?
得有人碓O艟常N？

320
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,487
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?
你再o我五分w一下吧。

321
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,795
Five minutes?
五分？

322
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,599
What? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.
怎N？我了
好像至少有一^。

323
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,991
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...
在粞Y你的^X\D得更加快，

324
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,995
...therefore time seems
to feel more slow.
因此rg似乎就感X慢了。

325
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,403
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.
真世界的五分
o你一小r在粞Y。

326
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:59,996
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?
槭颤N你不再五分，
看看你能做些什N？

327
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,209
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, cafe.
你有了@些基本的丫帧―
店、咖啡^，

328
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,992
Almost everything else is here too.
@Y似乎一切有M有。

329
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,126
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.
- @些人物是l？
- 是我的意R的投影。

330
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,319
- Yours?
- Yes.
- 你的？
- 是的。

331
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,123
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.
你看，你是主粽撸
你建造@世界。

332
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,999
I am the subject. My mind populates it.
我是主w，我的精神充斥在@Y。

333
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:22,056
You can literally talk to my subconscious.
你其可以和我的意Rυ，

334
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,137
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.
正因槿绱耍我可以
闹黧w那Y提取出Y。

335
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,601
How else do you do it?
能做些e的幔

336
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:30,745
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.
通^造出一些安全的地方，
比如y行的金旎蚴潜Oz，

337
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,610
The mind automatically fills it with
information it's trying to protect.
^X就自拥
需要保o的Y放在Y面，

338
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,544
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?
- 你明白幔
- 然後由你黻J入和I取？

339
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,644
Well...
@嘛……

340
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:43,218
I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...
我想我之前以粞Y的空g
只和X形象有P，

341
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,651
...but it's more about the feel of it.
但F在看砀像和感X有P。

342
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:50,257
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?
我的}是，如果你想和
物理律_起玩笑l生什N？

343
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,995
It's something, isn't it?
延^吧，你f呢？

344
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:35,267
Yes, it is.
是啊。

345
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,825
Why are they all looking at me?
槭颤N他都那忧浦我？

346
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:04,528
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.
因槲业意R感X到了
有另外的人在造@世界。

347
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,370
The more you change things,
你改的事物越多，

348
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,991
the quicker the projections
start to converge on you.
@些投影就越快地
_始向你聚n^怼

349
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:10,200
Converge?
聚n？

350
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,438
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.
他察X出主粽叩耐傩裕

351
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,325
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.
就像白胞那樱
向受到感染的部位l起攻簟

352
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,579
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.
- 怎N，他攻粑幔
- 不，不，

353
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,013
Just you.
只攻裟恪

354
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,995
This is great, but I'm telling you,
@雍馨簦不^我跟你f，

355
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,890
if you keep changing things like this...
如果你像@硬煌５馗淖事物……

356
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:35,061
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?
天哪！能不能招呼下你的意R，
他放pc？

357
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:38,297
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.
那是我的意R，
要知道，我是]k法控制的。

358
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,818
Very impressive.
相能帧

359
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:48,201
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?
我JR@座颍
@地方是真的，幔

360
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,603
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.
是啊，我每天去大W都要穿^。

361
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,920
Never re-create places from your memory.
千fe用你的碓造h境，

362
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:54,208
Always imagine new places.
是要想像出新的h境。

363
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,208
You draw from stuff you know, right?
可是你得用你熟悉的|西碓O吧？

364
00:32:56,374 --> 00:33:00,722
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.
只能用的|西，比如呃…一K街簦
或一亭，^不能用整^域。

365
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,992
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...
- 槭颤N不能？
- 因槿绻你用建造艟场

366
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:06,704
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.
使你很容易失去把握，
分不清什N是F，而什N又是簟

367
00:33:06,728 --> 00:33:08,828
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.
- 你是不是就是@樱

A totem, it's a small personal...
Dv是一件小小的人……

That's some subconscious

比如，@是灌了U的骰子。

That would defeat the purpose.
不，我不能你碰它，

- 你是不是植入得不蛏睿

What kind of tricks?

That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.
那可以你造出]合的路，

...the boundaries of the dream you create.

But how big do these levels have to be?
但@些艟有多大？

It could be anything from the floor

多大都可以，囊蛔建B的一
一直到整座城市。

- 一座迷m？
- ]e，迷m，

483
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,635
And the better the maze...
迷m越}s……

484
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,626
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?
那N我有越L的rg

485
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,739
Exactly.
正是。

你的迷mO得怎N恿耍

608
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:02,347
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...
每一佣寂c我想要接近的
主w的意R的…

609
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,981
...that we are trying to access.
…某一部分有M，

610
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:07,045
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
因此我把最底釉O成了t院，

611
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,651
so Fischer will bring his father.
@<u>M希</u>把父HУ侥茄Y，唔…

612
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:12,705
You know, I... Actually, I have
a question about this layout.
你看，我…其P於@O
我有}……

613
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:15,440
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
不，不，不，e…eo我看。

614
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,593
Only the dreamer should know the layout.
只有主粽卟胖道O方案。

615
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:18,942
Why is that so important?
槭颤N@那N重要？

616
00:49:18,988 --> 00:49:21,111
In case one of us brings in
our projections.
f一我其他人
把我的投影нM粞Yr，

617
00:49:21,157 --> 00:49:23,995
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.
我不想@些投影

618
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,467
You mean in case you bring Mal in.
你是ff一你把<u></u>нM粞Y？

You can't keep her out, can you?
你o法不她出F，是幔

620
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,710
- Right.
- You can't build...
- 是的。
- 你自己不能建造它…

621
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,982
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.
是因槿绻你t解了迷m的，
她也就t解了，

622
00:49:36,005 --> 00:49:38,309
Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.
她就破恼行印

623
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,279
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.
- <u>考博</u>，其他人知道@幔
- 不，他不知道。

624
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,702
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.
你提醒他一下，
有可能出F很糟糕的情r。

625
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,784
No one said it's getting worse.
不出F很糟糕的情r！

626
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:50,489
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.
我必回家，
@就是目前我所P心的。

627
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:53,123
Why can't you go home?
你槭颤N不能回家？

628
00:49:56,225 --> 00:49:58,362
Because they think I killed her.
因樗J槭俏⒌乃。

629
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,868
- Thank you.
- For what?
- xx你。
- x什N？

630
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,337
For not asking whether I did.
x你]我是不是我⒌摹

631
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,713
"I will split up my father's empire."
“我要拆分我父H的帝。”

632
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:13,048
Now, this is obviously an idea that 
Robert himself would choose to reject....
@@然是<u>_伯特</u>他自己
F在想要抗拒的意念，

633
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:16,014
...which is why we need to plant it
deep in his subconscious.
所以槭颤N我需要⑺深深地
植入到他的意R之中。

634
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:19,758
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.
意R是由感情拥模幔
而不是理智。

635
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:23,657
We need to find a way to translate 
this into an emotional concept.
我需要找到某N方式
⑦@D化成感情上的概念。

636
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,257
How do you translate business 
strategy into emotion?
你如何⒁环N商I策略D化成感情？

637
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,180

That's what we're here to figure out, right?
我在@壕褪且找出k法恚N？

638
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,930
Robert's relationship with his father...
退一步f，<u>_伯特</u>c他父H的PS…

639
00:50:30,092 --> 00:50:32,951
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?
- …也是相o的。
- 我能不能利用@c？

640
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,670
We could suggest to him
breaking up his father's company
我可以他X得
他拆分他父H的公司，

641
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,844
as a "screw you" to the old man.
就是老^子最好的打簦

642
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,600
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.
不好，因槲艺J榉eO的感情
是能龠^消O的感情，

643
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:44,444
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.
我都渴望和解，
精神上的宣。

644
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,800
We need Robert Fischer...
我需要<u>_伯特</u>・<u>M希</u>…

00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,382
...to have a positive
emotional reaction to all this.
…@一切a生eO的
感情上的反。

646
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,281
All right, well, try this. Um...
好吧，要N@，唔…

647
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,770
"My father accepts that I want to
create for myself,
“我父HJ可我想自己I，

648
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,390
not follow in his footsteps."
而不是追S他的足印。”

649
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:56,753
That might work.
@也S行。

650
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,992
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might".
也S？我需要比“也S”更LM一c。

651
00:51:00,156 --> 00:51:02,226
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.
噢，xx你的I，<u>瑟</u>。

652
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:05,330
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.
原我想要求一些π裕<u>伊姆斯</u>。

653
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,631
Specificity?
π裕懂幔

654
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,633
Inception's not about being specific.
“l”的^程可不一定那N明_，

655
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:12,872
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.
我M入到他的^X之後，
我必WC行事才行。

656
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,975
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...
在最上r，我_始打造
他c父Hg的PS，

657
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:20,311
...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps".
即：“我不想追S我父H的足印。”

658
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:25,152
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself".
然後在下一樱我灌o他：
“我要槲易约I。”

659
00:51:25,214 --> 00:51:28,654
Then, by the time we hit the bottom
level, we bring out the big guns.
然後，我到_底r，
我端出致命武器…

660
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,322
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.
- “我父H不想我成樗。”
- 正是。

661
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,722
Three layers down,
the dreams are gonna collapse...
在三艟持下，
得相脆弱，

662
00:51:34,735 --> 00:51:36,597
...with the slightest disturbance.
即使是最微弱的_印

663
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,928
Sedation.
o睡眠。

664
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,933
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...
榱造出三艟常
睡眠得足蚍定，

665
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:45,204
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.
@游必Y合用
O其诺逆o。

666
00:51:56,345 --> 00:51:57,414
Good night.
晚安。

667
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:00,318
The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...
我用砉灿艟车乃…

668
00:52:00,382 --> 00:52:02,419
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...
…在主粽咧ga生
非常清晰的B接，

669
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,980
...whilst accelerating brain function.
同r它H上加快大X的功能。

670
00:52:04,993 --> 00:52:06,828
In other words,
more time on each level.
Q句f，在每一艟持
它o我更多的rg。

671
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,162
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.
糁写竽X的功能比通常要快20倍。

672
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:13,833
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.
如果你M入到糁兄簦
那效果翻番。

673
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,001
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20...
三粝喈於10小r乘以20……

674
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:19,070
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?
Σ黄穑呃…W砭筒皇俏业，
到底是多Lrg？

675
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:21,907
It's a week, the first level down.
下面第一邮且星期，

676
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:25,445
Six months the second level down,
and the third level...
下面第二邮橇月，
第三邮恰…

677
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,344
That's 10 years.
10年。

678
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,049
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?
l意在一粞Y耗上10年？

679
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:33,516
Depends on the dream.
那得看你做什N袅恕

680
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,187
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?
那N我一旦完成任眨
我怎N回砟兀

681
00:52:36,252 --> 00:52:39,491
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.
我希望你已有了更文明的k法，
而不是朝我^上_一？

682
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,427
- A kick.
- What's a kick?
- 用反_/踢。
- 什N是反_？

683
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,496
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.
@，<u>阿Y阿德涅</u>，就叫反_。

684
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:50,134
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.
感X到落就⒛阏鹦眩

685
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:52,010
Snaps you out of the dream.

686
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,669
Are we gonna feel a kick
with this sedation?
用了那N力的o┽
我能感X到反_幔

687
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:54,935
That's the clever part.
噢，妙就妙在@Y，

688
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,330
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.
我特u的o┎影
榷【平衡感X器】的功能，

689
00:52:58,374 --> 00:53:03,317
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.
那右恚o你的睡眠有多深，
你仍然能感X到落，

690
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:05,851
Or tipping.
或翻倒。

691
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:10,957
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.
PIc是要使反_同步，
而且它能穿越所有三艟场

692
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:14,927
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.
我可以利用音返涤r器
硗步不同鹊姆_。

693

他]有任何的手g安排、

Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?
他不是需要做膝w手g幔

00:53:28,337 --> 00:53:31,577
Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need...
]有，]有什N能有C

We need at least a good 10 hours.
我至少需要足的10小r。

Sydney to Los Angeles.

One of the longest flights in the world.

He makes it every two weeks.

700
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,321
He must be flying private, then.
那他也是用他的私人wC。

701
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,892
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.
要是他的私人wC需要
意外S修的就不行了。

702
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,194
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?
- 那就需要一架波音747。
- 槭颤N？

703
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:50,928
On a 747, the pilot's up top...
因747上w行T在上面，

704
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,300
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.
^等位於C^，
所以]有人走碜呷ァ

705
00:53:54,363 --> 00:53:57,990
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.
不^你得I下整^等，

706
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,804

Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

You know how to find me.

You know what you have to do.

You shouldn't be here.
你不磉@Y。
