1
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,720
   

2
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,600
    

3
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,590
                 

4
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,190
     

5
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,200
              

6
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
   

7
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,450
Are you here to kill me?


8
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,630
I know what this is.
       

9
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,870
I've seen one before. Many, many years ago.
               

10
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,380
It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.
           ,    

11
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,480
A man possessed of some radical notions.
           

12
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,230
What is the most resilient parasite?
          ?

13
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,860
A bacteria? A virus?
  ?   ?

14
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,700
An intestinal worm?
  ?

15
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,260
Uh...
 ...

16
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,070
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...
      ...

17
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,430
An idea.
   

18
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,230
Resilient. Highly contagious.
         

19
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,400
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate.
                       

20
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,120
An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks.
             

21
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,520
Right in there somewhere.
     

22
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,250
For someone like you to steal?
         ?

23
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,360
Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered...
                ...

24
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,960
...and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
...           

25
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,360
It's called extraction.
     

26
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,090
Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself...
                       

27
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,760
...from even the most skilled extractor.
...            

28
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,100
How can you do that?
      ?

29
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,100
Because I am the most skilled extractor.
            

30
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,980
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.
                        

31
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,080
And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep...
               ...

32
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,580
...your defense is never down.
...        

33
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,390
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me.
                       

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,920
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...
                 ...

35
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,390
...better than your therapist, better than anyone.
...                

36
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,490
If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets...
                    

37
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,000
...I need to know what's in that safe.
...              

38
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,630
In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.
                   

39
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,140
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal.
                     

40
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,640
He knows.
    

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,150
What's going on up there?
        ?

42
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,000
Saito knows. He's playing with us.
           

43
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,740
Doesn't matter. I can get it here. Trust me.
            

44
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,400
The information is in the safe.
        

45
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,740
He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
  "  "           

46
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,140
What's she doing here?
     ?

47
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,960
Just head back to the room. All right? I'll take care of this.
      ?      

48
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,150
Okay, make sure you do. We're here to work.
                

49
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,270
If I jumped, would I survive?
            ?

50
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,040
With a clean dive, perhaps.
            

51
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,870
Mal, what are you doing here?
         ?

52
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,240
I thought you might be missing me.
        

53
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,680
You know that I am.
      

54
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,720
But I can't trust you anymore.
         

55
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,820
So what?
    ?

56
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,590
Looks like Arthur's taste.
        

57
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,390
Actually, the subject is partial to postwar British painters.
                 

58
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,790
Please, have a seat.
   

59
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,980
Tell me...
    

60
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,940
...do the children miss me?
...      ?

61
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,980
You can't imagine.
       

62
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,250
What are you doing?
    ?

63
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,950
Just getting some fresh air.
       

64
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,120
Stay where you are, Mal.
        

65
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,670
Goddamn it.
   

66
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,100
Turn around.
   

67
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,300
The gun, Dom.
       

68
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,710
Please.
    

69
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,200
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.
         

70
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,000
Did she tell you? Or have you known all along?
      ?        ?

71
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,400
That you're here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?
                     ?

72
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,910
I want to know the name of your employer.
         

73
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,780
Ah, there's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?
               ?

74
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,420
That depends on what you're threatening.
         

75
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,490
Killing him would just wake him up.
            

76
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,420
But pain...
     

77
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,270
Pain is in the mind.
       

78
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,170
And judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
                      ?

79
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,680
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.
-    ?      
-            

81
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,290
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer. We're almost there.
              

82
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,460
He was close. Very close.
        

83
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,350
Stop him!
   !

84
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,340
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.
        

85
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,110
He won't wake.
   

86
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,880
- Give him the kick.
- What?
-     
-   ?

87
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,440
Dunk him.
    

88
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,360
He's out.
    

89
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,730
You came prepared, hmm?
          ?

90
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,740
Not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it?
                       ?

91
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,100
It's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret...
                        

92
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,800
...particularly where there's a married woman involved.
...       

93
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,950
- She would never...
- Yet here we are.
-       
-     

94
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,110
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.
-     
-      

95
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,050
- You got what you came for.
- Well, that's not true.
-            
-    

96
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,880
You left out a key piece of information, didn't you?
                ?

97
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,250
You held something back because you knew what we were up to.
                

98
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,290
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.
-                ?
-   

99
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,430
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.
-     ?
-         

100
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,300
We extracted every bit of information you had in there.
               

101
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,000
But your deception was obvious.
        

102
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,320
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
-        
-             

103
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,720
That corporation that hired us, they won't accept failure.
              

104
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,020
We won't last two days.
       

105
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,160
Cobb?
  ?

106
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,460
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.
         

107
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,400
Tell us what you know! Tell us what you know, now!
         !     !

108
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,640
I've always hated this carpet.
         

109
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,180
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.
          

110
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,010
But very definitely made of wool.
        

111
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,550
Right now...
   

112
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,020
...I'm lying on polyester.
...       

113
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,730
Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment.
               

114
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,870
You have lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb.
           

115
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,330
I'm still dreaming.
     

116
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,840
- How'd it go?
- Not good.
-     ?
-   

117
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,350
Dream within a dream, huh? I'm impressed.
      ?        

118
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,120
But in my dream, you play by my rules.
               

119
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,560
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...
            

120
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,130
We're not in your dream.
          

121
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,860
We're in mine.
    

122
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,900
Asshole. How do you mess up the carpet?
          ?

123
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,380
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.
-      
-      

124
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,680
I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!
             !

125
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,940
That's enough.
  

126
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,580
You. What the hell was all that?
         ?

127
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,960
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.
-        
-        

128
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,890
We don't have time for this. I'm getting off at Kyoto.
              

129
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,890
He's not gonna check every compartment.
          

130
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,690
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.
         

131
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,630
Listen. Every man for himself.
        

132
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes, hello?
  

133
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,810
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Dad.
-     
-   

134
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,940
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you? How you doing, huh?
          ?

135
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,350
- Good.
- Okay, I guess.
-    
-    

136
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,250
Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James?
                

137
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,330
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?
             ?

138
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,960
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't. Not for a while, remember?
                  ?

139
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,470
Why?
   ?

140
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,370
Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?
                ?

141
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,510
Grandma says you're never coming back.
           

142
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,080
Phillipa, is that you?
       ?

143
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,380
Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?
        ?

144
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,250
She's shaking her head.
    

145
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,880
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.
       

146
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,950
Daddy?
   

147
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,680
Yeah, James?
      ?

148
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,520
Is Mommy with you?
        ?

149
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,360
James, we talked about this.
             

150
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,000
Mommy's not here anymore.
       

151
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,300
Where?
    ?

152
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,670
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.
           

153
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,870
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?
                  ?

154
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,070
And you be good, you be...
        

155
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,790
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.
-       
-   

156
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,130
Hey, are you okay?
      ?

157
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,170
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
         

158
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,770
Well, down in the dream, Mal showing up.
         

159
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,170
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg. Won't happen again.
                   

160
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,940
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?
-          ?
-             ?

161
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,580
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?
-      ?
-        ?

162
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,220
We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans...
                  ...

163
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,150
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.
...         

164
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,550
By now, they know we failed. It's time we disappear.
                  

165
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,580
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.
-      ?
-        

166
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,030
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?
                        ?

167
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,390
Stateside.
    

168
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,090
Send my regards.
    

169
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,000
He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.
                   

170
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,980
So I offer you the satisfaction.
       

171
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,450
It's not the way I deal with things.
        

172
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,600
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.
-       ?
-     

173
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,500
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.
             

174
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,010
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.
-         ?
-   (    )

175
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,030
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.
-    ?
-      

176
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,390
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind...
              ...

177
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,430
...why can't you plant one there instead?
...            ?

178
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,690
Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.
             

179
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,170
I say, "Don't think about elephants." What are you thinking about?
   "    "       ?

180
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,360
Elephants.
  

181
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,700
Right. But it's not your idea, because you know I gave it to you.
                     

182
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,880
The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.
              

183
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:50,240
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.
-           
-    

184
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,880
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?
-      ?
-      ?

185
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,720
Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.
                  

186
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,920
Then you do have a choice.
        

187
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,860
Then I choose to leave, sir.
         

188
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,460
Tell the crew where you want to go.
         

189
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,800
Hey, Mr. Cobb.
      

190
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,040
How would you like to go home?
     ?

191
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,150
To America. To your children.
          

192
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,920
You can't fix that. No one can.
         

193
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,320
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.
-       
-      

194
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,960
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.
-            ?
-     

195
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,660
No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.
                   

196
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,560
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.
               

197
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,510
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.
              

198
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,970
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.
             

199
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,340
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.
-           
-   

200
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,690
If I were to do this, if I even could do it...
                

201
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,760
...I'd need a guarantee.
...       

202
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,190
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.
-             ?
-      

203
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,260
But I can.
       

204
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,430
So do you want to take a leap of faith...
           ...

205
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,700
...or become an old man, filled with regret...
...            

206
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,470
...waiting to die alone?
...     ?

207
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,850
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely.
                 

208
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,790
Look, I know how much you wanna go home.
            

209
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,330
This can't be done.
    

210
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,760
Yes, it can. Just have to go deep enough.
          

211
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,490
You don't know that.
     

212
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,670
I've done it before.
     

213
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,040
Who'd you do it to?
  ?

214
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,270
Why are we going to Paris?
         ?

215
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,580
We're gonna need a new architect.
         

216
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,560
You never did like your office, did you?
                ?

217
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,400
No space to think in that broom cupboard.
           

218
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,510
Is it safe for you to be here?
       ?

219
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,150
Extradition between France and the United States...
         ...

220
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,550
...is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.
...            

221
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,450
I think they might find a way to make it work in your case.
               

222
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,120
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance.
                  

223
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,890
It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal...
        ...

224
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,030
...to convince those children they still have a father.
...            

225
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,030
I'm just doing what I know. I'm doing what you taught me.
                

226
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,730
I never taught you to be a thief.
        

227
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,100
No, you taught me to navigate people's minds.
              

228
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,570
But after what happened...
      

229
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,300
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.
...                 

230
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,940
What are you doing here, Dom?
          ?

231
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,460
I think I found a way home.
          

232
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,190
It's a job for some very, very powerful people.
         

233
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,830
People who I believe can fix my charges permanently.
               

234
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,900
But I need your help.
      

235
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,900
You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.
                

236
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,970
You know what I'm offering. Let them decide for themselves.
                  

237
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,610
- Money.
- Not just money.
-  
-      

238
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,110
You remember.
    

239
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,510
It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities...
               

240
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,450
...things that never existed...
...        ...

241
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,810
...things that couldn't exist in the real world.
...             

242
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:52,150
So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?
               ?

243
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,290
They don't actually come into the dream.
        

244
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,730
They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
                    

245
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,130
Design it yourself.
      

246
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,290
Mal won't let me.
       

247
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,640
Come back to reality, Dom.
       

248
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,540
- Please.
- Reality.
-   
-   

249
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,440
Those kids, your grandchildren...
      

250
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,610
...they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.
...                 

251
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,990
And this job, this last job, that's how I get there.
                   

252
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,160
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.
              

253
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,230
I need an architect who's as good as I was.
               

254
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,430
I've got somebody better.
          

255
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,630
Ariadne?
      

256
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,770
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
         

257
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,270
Pleased to meet you.
      

258
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,110
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.
                      

259
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,310
A work placement?
    ?

260
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,020
Not exactly.
   

261
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,520
I have a test for you.
      

262
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,320
You're not gonna tell me anything first?
           ?

263
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,120
Before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it.
                    

264
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,500
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
-    ?
-            

265
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,270
You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.
                        

266
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,340
Stop.
 

267
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,980
Again.
  

268
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,450
Stop.
 

269
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,680
You're gonna have to do better than that.
    

270
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,970
That's more like it.
     

271
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,060
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential.
                 

272
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,920
Now, that's when we're awake.
           

273
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,070
When we're asleep, our mind can do almost anything.
                  

274
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,260
Such as?
  ?

275
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,430
Imagine you're designing a building. You consciously create each aspect.
                      

276
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,440
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself, if you know what I mean.
                    

277
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,580
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.
            

278
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,010
Genuine inspiration, right?
        ?

279
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,510
Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this.
               

280
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,320
We create and perceive our world simultaneously.
                 

281
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,890
And our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.
                    

282
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,790
That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.
           

283
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,330
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.
-   ?
-        

284
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,130
Now, this is where I need you.
          

285
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,670
You create the world of the dream.
        

286
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,210
We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.
                     

287
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,040
How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?
                      ?

288
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,670
Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right?
                     ?

289
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,550
It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
                

290
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,420
Let me ask you a question.
      

291
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,990
You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?
                ?

292
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,190
You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
          

293
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,390
I guess, yeah.
    

294
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,120
So how did we end up here?
           ?

295
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,590
Well, we just came from the, uh...
     

296
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,240
Think about it, Ariadne. How did you get here?
                 ?

297
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,740
Where are you right now?
      ?

298
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,210
We're dreaming?
     ?

299
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,810
You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping.
            

300
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,950
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
                 

301
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,420
If it's just a dream, then why are you...?
              

302
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,790
Because it's never just a dream, is it?
             ?

303
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,260
And a face full of glass hurts like hell. When you're in it, it feels real.
               
          

304
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,630
That's why the military developed dream sharing.
           

305
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,500
It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each other...
                       

306
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,800
...and then wake up.
...    

307
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,900
How did architects become involved?
          ?

308
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,810
Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?
            ?

309
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,280
Why don't you give us another five minutes?
          ?

310
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,540
Five minutes?
    ?

311
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,250
What...? We were talking for, like, at least an hour.
               

312
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,650
In a dream, your mind functions more quickly...
              ...

313
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,660
...therefore time seems to feel more slow.
...         

314
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,190
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.
              

315
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,990
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?
               ?

316
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,840
You've got the basic layout. Bookstore, caf .
                 

317
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,670
Almost everything else is here too.
          

318
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,780
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.
-      ?
-           

319
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,110
- Yours?
- Yes.
-   ?
-   

320
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,810
Remember, you are the dreamer. You build this world.
                

321
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,650
I am the subject. My mind populates it.
              

322
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,720
You can literally talk to my subconscious.
           

323
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,790
That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.
                  

324
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,220
How else do you do it?
        ?

325
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,390
By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail.
                   

326
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,300
The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.
                

327
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,230
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?
-    ?
-           ?

328
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,430
Well...
   ...

329
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,100
I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual...
            ...

330
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,140
...but it's more about the feel of it.
...          

331
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,740
My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?
                    ?

332
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,650
It's something, isn't it?
       ?

333
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,060
Yes, it is.
  

334
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,510
Why are they all looking at me?
        ?

335
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,180
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.
                   

336
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,660
The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.
                  

337
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,890
Converge?
  ?

338
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,120
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.
           

339
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,960
They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection.
                  

340
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,970
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.
-           ?
-    

341
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,100
Just you.
   

342
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:28,280
This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this...
                     

343
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,750
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?
              ?

344
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,580
It's my subconscious. Remember? I can't control it.
            ?       

345
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,610
Very impressive.
    

346
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,880
I know this bridge. This place is real, isn't it?
                 ?

347
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,390
Yeah, I cross it every day to get to the college.
            

348
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,000
Never re-create places from your memory. Always imagine new places.
                      

349
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,000
You draw from stuff you know, right?
               ?

350
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:00,370
Only use details. A streetlamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas.
                 
        

351
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,670
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...
-      ?
-         ...

352
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,330
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.
...              

353
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,570
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.
-       ?
-    

354
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,740
This has nothing to do with me, understand?
         ?

355
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,890
That why you need me to build your dreams?
            ?

356
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,580
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.
           

357
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,380
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!
-      !
-    !

358
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,490
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!
-    !    !
-   !

359
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,090
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!
-   !
-       !

360
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,060
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!
-        !
-  !

361
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,720
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!
-     !
-    !

362
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:31,330
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. You're okay. You're okay.
                

363
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,740
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?
-  
-         

364
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,630
There was still time on the clock.
        

365
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,340
You can't wake up from within the dream unless you die.
                  

366
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,100
- She'll need a totem.
- What?
-       
-   ?

367
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,750
A totem, it's a small personal...
            ...

368
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,440
That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!
              

369
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,450
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.
-     
-  

370
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,250
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?
-            
-      ?

371
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,150
Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy.
     ,           

372
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,800
Something you can have on you that no one else knows.
             

373
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,230
- Like a coin?
- No.
-     ?
-  

374
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,030
It needs to be more unique than that. Like, this is a loaded die.
                  

375
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,040
No, I can't let you touch it. That would defeat the purpose.
                  

376
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,410
See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.
                      

377
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,410
That way, when you look at your totem...
             ...

378
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,670
...you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.
...                

379
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,420
I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to...
                         

380
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,120
...but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.
...                 

381
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,230
And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.
             

382
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,770
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.
                   

383
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,440
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now, and when she comes back...
                     ...

384
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,780
When she comes back, you're gonna have her building mazes.
            

385
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,210
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.
-      ?
-        

386
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,510
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa. It's Cobol's back yard.
   ?                   

387
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,280
It's a necessary risk.
      

388
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,920
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.
-        
-        

389
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,090
We need a forger.
         

390
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,360
Rub them together all you want, they're not gonna breed.
               

391
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,970
You never know.
     

392
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,940
I'm gonna get you a drink.
     

393
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,480
You're buying.
    

394
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,250
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.
-          
-     

395
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,390
How's your handwriting?
      ?

396
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,390
- It's versatile.
- Good.
-     
-   

397
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,790
Thank you very much.
    

398
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,830
Inception.
  

399
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,900
Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible, let me...
                    

400
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,370
No, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult.
              

401
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,800
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.
                 

402
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,210
Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud?
              ?

403
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,070
He is good at what he does, right?
             ?

404
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,310
Oh, he's the best, but he has no imagination.
             

405
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,510
Not like you.
     

406
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,650
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception, you need imagination.
                

407
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,380
Let me ask you something. Have you done it before?
           ?

408
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,190
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn't take.
                 

409
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,690
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.
-          ?
-           

410
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,860
You need the simplest version of the idea...
         

411
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,700
...in order for it to grow naturally in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.
...                    

412
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,400
So, what is this idea that you need to plant?
            ?

413
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,770
We need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father's empire.
                    

414
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,380
Right there you have various political motivations...
          ...

415
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,540
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth.
...          

416
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,550
But all of that stuff, it's, um...
        

417
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,590
It's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice, you see?
              ?

418
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,250
What you have to do is start at the absolute basic.
         

419
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,980
Which is what?
    ?

420
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,390
The relationship with the father.
    

421
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,260
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.
-       ?
-     

422
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,490
Right. Okay, well, there's a man here, Yusuf.
            

423
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,100
He, uh, formulates his own versions of the compounds.
         

424
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,570
Why don't you take me there?
        ?

425
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,800
Once you've lost your tail. The man at the bar.
              

426
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,440
Cobol Engineering.
    

427
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,940
That price on my head, was that dead or alive?
             ?

428
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,640
Don't remember. Let's see if he starts shooting.
              

429
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,450
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?
                 ?

430
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,610
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.
-     ?
-           

431
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,490
All right.
  

432
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,490
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.
           

433
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,130
My God, it's you, isn't it?
      ?

434
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,730
No, it isn't you.
      

435
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,340
Not dreaming now, are you?
        ?

436
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,130
Get him!
   !

437
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,780
There!
   

438
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,050
One caf .
    

439
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,540
Shh.
 

440
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,660
One caf .
    

441
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,160
One caf .
    

442
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,220
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
         ?

443
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,920
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.
-         ?
-       

444
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,360
Ah. So this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?
            ?

445
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,550
Different tail.
     

446
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,000
Cobb said you'd be back.
         

447
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,670
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.
-          
-          

448
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,510
It's just...
   

449
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,350
...pure creation.
...   

450
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,010
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?
           ?

451
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,180
You're gonna have to master a few tricks...
              

452
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,880
...if you're gonna build three complete dream levels. Excuse me.
...              

453
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,490
What kind of tricks?
    ?

454
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,150
In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.
                   

455
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:08,230
That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps.
                 

456
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,090
The infinite staircase.
    

457
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,240
See?
  

458
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,470
Paradox.
  

459
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,050
So a closed loop like that...
           ...

460
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,310
...will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.
...             

461
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,450
But how big do these levels have to be?
        ?

462
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,750
It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.
                  

463
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,360
They have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projections.
                 

464
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,930
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.
-   ?
-      

465
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,430
And the better the maze...
       ...

466
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,290
Then the longer we have before the projections catch us?
                  ?

467
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,730
Exactly.
  

468
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,030
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.
-           
-              

469
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,110
No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.
            

470
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,370
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
            ?

471
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,040
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.
                     

472
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,610
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.
                  

473
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,880
Why?
    

474
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,280
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.
               

475
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,020
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.
-    ?
-       

476
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:07,350
- They're still together?
- No.
-        ?
-   

477
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,080
No, she's dead.
   

478
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,790
What you see in there is just his projection of her.
            

479
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,800
What was she like in real life?
            ?

480
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,000
She was lovely.
    

481
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,080
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.
-       ?
-   

482
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,370
To formulate compounds for a job?
        ?

483
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,920
And to go into the field with us.
        

484
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,320
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.
            

485
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:39,220
Well, we'd need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs.
                  

486
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,490
- Which are?
- Great depth.
-     ?
-      

487
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,930
A dream within a dream? Two levels?
   ?    ?

488
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,720
Three.
   

489
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,460
Not possible. That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.
                

490
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,600
It is possible. You just have to add a sedative.
              

491
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,440
A powerful sedative.
       

492
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,480
- How many team members?
- Five.
-      ?
-   

493
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,380
Six.
  

494
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,280
The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.
                       

495
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,550
There's no room for tourists on a job like this, Mr. Saito.
                 

496
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,090
This time, it seems there is.
          

497
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,760
This, I think, is a good place to start. I use it every day.
                   

498
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,060
- What for?
- Here, I'll show you.
-    ?
-     

499
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,100
Perhaps you will not want to see.
          

500
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,640
After you.
   

501
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,950
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.
               

502
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,890
They come every day to share the dream.
          

503
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,490
You see? Very stable.
       

504
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,270
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.
-         ?
-      

505
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,570
In dream time?
    ?

506
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,410
With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day.
           40  

507
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,880
- Why do they do it?
- Tell him, Mr. Cobb.
-         ?
-         

508
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,850
After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream.
                   

509
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,960
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
          ?

510
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,990
- They come here every day to sleep?
- No.
-          ?
-  

511
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:26,430
They come to be woken up.
        

512
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,730
The dream has become their reality.
          

513
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,040
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?
           ?

514
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,970
Let's see what you can do.
      

515
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,550
You know how to find me.
       

516
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,150
You know what you have to do.
        

517
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,460
Sharp, no?
   ?

518
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,880
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?
         ?

519
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,190
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.
      

520
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:36,330
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
        "         "    

521
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,400
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?
            ?

522
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,160
That's not your concern.
       

523
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,940
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical corporate espionage.
                 

524
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,700
You asked me for inception.
     

525
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,250
I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.
              

526
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,380
Now, the seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea.
                

527
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,420
This idea will define him.
        

528
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,420
It may come to change...
       

529
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,890
Well, it may come to change everything about him.
          

530
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:05,390
We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.
                 

531
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,620
And we can no longer compete.
          

532
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,260
Soon, they'll control the energy supply of half the world.
                  

533
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,800
In effect, they become a new superpower.
               

534
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,540
The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.
                 

535
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,270
That's where we come in.
        

536
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,710
How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?
                ?

537
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,610
Rumor is the relationship is quite complicated.
            

538
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,280
Well, we can't work based solely on rumor, can we?
               ?

539
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,650
Can you get me access to this man here? Browning.
         ?    

540
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:36,990
Fischer Senior's right-hand man. Fischer Junior's godfather.
                

541
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,430
It should be possible, if you can get the right references.
                

542
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,060
References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
              

543
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,640
I'm not smelling settlement here. Take them down.
             

544
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:49,900
Mr. Browning...
     ...

545
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,910
...Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation.
...                 

546
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,940
Well, shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly?
             ?

547
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,520
Not sure that's necessary.
     

548
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,350
No, no, no. I think we should.
         

549
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,200
How is he?
    ?

550
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:31,810
I don't want to bother him unnecessarily, but...
           

551
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,450
Robert, I told you keep out the damn... Wait. So do it. Get...
               ...       ...

552
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,820
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.
-      
-    

553
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,790
Never, never. Never do the same as I asked.
            

554
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,760
Leave that.
   

555
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:52,840
Here.
  

556
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,510
Must be a cherished memory of his.
          

557
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:03,140
I put it beside his bed. He hasn't even noticed.
               

558
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,980
Robert...
   ...

559
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,750
...we need to talk about a power of attorney.
...           

560
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,220
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative...
- Not now, Uncle Peter.
-               
-          

561
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,030
The vultures are circling.
     

562
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,600
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.
                        

563
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,170
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning...
            ...

564
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:31,170
... and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.
...                    

565
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:35,210
So now in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning.
                

566
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,610
And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.
            

567
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,620
Then, when we take him a level deeper...
                

568
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,280
...his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.
...                 

569
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,390
So he gives himself the idea.
         

570
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,790
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick. It has to seem self-generated.
                        

571
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,360
Eames, I am impressed.
          

572
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:58,090
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.
               

573
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,450
Were you going under on your own?
       ?

574
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:25,120
No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments.
            

575
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,270
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...
           

576
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,100
Yeah, I was just... I was working on my totem, actually.
             

577
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,430
Here, let me take a look.
    

578
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,900
So you're learning, huh?
       ?

579
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:38,570
An elegant solution for keeping track of reality.
          

580
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,610
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...
-       ?
-        

581
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,910
It was Mal's, actually. This...
       

582
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,380
This one was hers. She would spin it in the dream and it would never topple.
                      

583
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,490
Just spin and spin.
      

584
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,960
Arthur told me she passed away.
       

585
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,920
How are the mazes coming along?
      ?

586
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,000
Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious...
              

587
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,630
...that we are trying to access.
...      

588
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:09,240
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so Fischer will bring his father.
                     

589
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,370
You know, l... Actually, I have a question about this layout.
                 

590
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:17,280
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics. Only the dreamer should know the layout.
                     

591
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,610
Why is that so important?
     ?

592
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,780
In case one of us brings in our projections.
              

593
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,290
We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.
              

594
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,160
You mean in case you bring Mal in.
           

595
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,730
You can't keep her out, can you?
         ?

596
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,150
- Right.
- You can't build...
-   
-      ...

597
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,630
...because if you know the maze, then she knows it.
...               

598
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,000
Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.
        

599
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,970
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.
-         ?
-    

600
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,370
You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.
                

601
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,480
No one said it's getting worse.
        

602
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,980
I need to get home. That's all I care about right now.
             

603
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,910
Why can't you go home?
        ?

604
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,050
Because they think I killed her.
           

605
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,560
- Thank you.
- For what?
-   
-    ?

606
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,030
For not asking whether I did.
         

607
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,360
"I will split up my father's empire."
"          "

608
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:12,730
Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject...
             ...

609
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,700
...which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious.
...                 

610
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,400
The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason.
                   ?

611
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,340
We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
               

612
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,950
How do you translate business strategy into emotion?
             ?

613
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,710
That's what we're here to figure out. Robert's relationship with his father...
                      

614
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:32,620
- ...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?
- ...     ,   
-        ?

615
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:36,390
We suggest breaking up his father's company as a "screw you" to the old man.
              
          

616
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,020
No, because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.
                     

617
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:44,130
We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis.
          

618
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,070
We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
                      

619
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,070
All right, well, try this. Um...
         ...

620
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,980
"My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps."
"                     "

621
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,440
That might work.
     

622
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,780
Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than "might."
  ?         

623
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,920
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.
         

624
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,020
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.
               

625
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,320
Specificity?
  ?

626
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:08,320
Inception's not about being specific.
       

627
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:12,450
When we get inside his mind, we're gonna have to work with what we find.
                     

628
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,760
On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father...
                   

629
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,000
...and say, "I will not follow in my father's footsteps."
    "           "

630
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:24,840
Then the next level down, we feed him, "I will create something for myself."
               
          

631
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,340
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns.
                   

632
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,910
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
- Exactly.
- "          "
-   

633
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,280
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.
                     

634
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,620
Sedation.
   

635
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,620
For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...
             ...

636
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:44,690
...we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.
...             

637
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,200
Good night.
  

638
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,000
The compound we'll be using to share the dream...
         

639
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,110
... creates a clear connection between dreamers...
...           ...

640
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,510
...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.
- ...        
-                    

641
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,850
Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.
            20 

642
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,510
And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded.
             

643
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:15,790
It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20...
        10    20 ...

644
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,860
Math was never my strong subject. How much time is that?
              ?

645
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,690
It's a week, the first level down.
         

646
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,230
Six months the second level down, and the third level...
            ...

647
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,840
That's 10 years.
    

648
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,640
Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?
             ?

649
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,200
Depends on the dream.
       

650
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,680
So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?
            ?

651
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:39,180
I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.
                 

652
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,120
- A kick.
- What's a kick?
-    
-      ?

653
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,980
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.
           

654
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,820
It's that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake.
             

655
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,230
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?
-       
-               ?

656
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,590
That's the clever part.
       

657
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:58,000
I customized the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired.
                  

658
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:03,010
That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling.
                 

659
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,540
Or tipping.
    

660
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,340
The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.
              

661
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,410
We could use a musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.
                 

662
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,790
He hasn't got any surgery scheduled, no dental, nothing.
               

663
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,960
Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?
            ?

664
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,360
Nothing. Nothing that they'll put him under for, anyway. And we need...
                      

665
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,470
We need at least a good 10 hours.
      10       

666
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,970
Sydney to Los Angeles.
      

667
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:40,570
One of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks.
                

668
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,910
He must be flying private, then.
          

669
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,580
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.
                   

670
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,980
- It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?
-    747  
-     

671
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:50,620
On a 747, the pilot's up top...
747         

672
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,990
...the first-class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through.
...              

673
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,650
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.
                

674
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,390
I bought the airline.
            

675
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:02,760
It seemed neater.
       

676
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:07,170
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.
     10   

677
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,970
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.
     ?          

678
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:01,150
You know how to find me.
       

679
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,060
You know what you have to do.
        

680
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,360
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
            ?

681
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,260
Of course I do.
     

682
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,860
You said you had a dream.
       

683
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,580
That we'd grow old together.
        

684
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,710
And we can.
     

685
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,330
You shouldn't be here.
    

686
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,560
Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.
              

687
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,930
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.
-      
-        

688
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:51,910
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.
-          
-           

689
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:05,190
Why do you do this to yourself?
         ?

690
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,290
It's the only way I can still dream.
         

691
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,260
Why is it so important to dream?
         ?

692
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,430
In my dreams, we're still together.
          

693
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,510
These aren't just dreams.
      

694
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,340
These are memories. And you said never to use memories.
               

695
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,580
I know I did.
      

696
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:42,750
You're trying to keep her alive. You can't let her go.
              

697
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,920
You don't understand. These are moments I regret.
              

698
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,660
They're memories that I have to change.
         

699
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,370
Well, what's down there that you regret?
        ?

700
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,900
Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me.
               

701
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,970
This is your house?
    ?

702
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:09,120
Mine and Mal's, yes.
      

703
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:10,980
Where is she?
    ?

704
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,650
She's already gone.
     

705
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,920
That's my son, James.
         

706
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,190
He's digging for something, maybe a worm.
             

707
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,700
That's Phillipa.
     

708
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,100
I thought about calling out to them...
       

709
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:31,040
...so they'd turn and smile and I could see...
...               

710
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:36,870
...those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late.
...               

711
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,880
Right now or never, Cobb.
       

712
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,150
Then I start to panic.
        

713
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:49,020
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...
          ...

714
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,190
...that I need to see their faces one last time.
...              

715
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,860
James! Phillipa! Come on in!
          !

716
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:57,060
But the moment's past.
       

717
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:02,640
And whatever I do, I can't change this moment.
               

718
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,700
As I'm about to call out to them...
         

719
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,840
...they run away.
...      

720
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,850
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again, I've gotta get back home.
               

721
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,380
The real world.
      

722
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,430
What are you doing here?
     ?

723
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,360
My name is...
   

724
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:04,830
I know who you are. What are you doing here?
            ?

725
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,450
I'm just trying to understand.
      

726
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,740
How could you understand?
       ?

727
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,080
Do you know what it is to be a lover?
         ?

728
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,220
To be half of a whole?
    ?

729
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,020
No.
    

730
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,490
I'll tell you a riddle.
       

731
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,260
You're waiting for a train.
       

732
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,460
A train that will take you far away.
           

733
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,810
You know where you hope this train will take you...
              ...

734
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,110
...but you don't know for sure.
...      

735
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,180
But it doesn't matter.
    

736
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,550
How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?
                ?

737
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,480
Because you'll be together.
        

738
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,620
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?
-             ?
-     ?

739
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,190
This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary.
                 

740
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,690
What happened here?
       ?

741
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,430
You promised! You promised we'd be together!
    !           !

742
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,930
Please, I need you to stay here just for now!
           !

743
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,330
You said we'd be together! You said we'd grow old together!
           !           !

744
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,980
I'll come back for you. I promise.
           

745
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:41,560
Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?
                   ?

746
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,570
Do you really think that that's gonna contain her?
             ?

747
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,730
It's time.
    

748
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,300
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
             

749
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,640
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.
-        ?
-        

750
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:56,080
Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.
                     

751
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:57,710
All right.
  

752
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,340
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.
-        
-           

753
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,650
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.
                 

754
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,390
And it doesn't have to be me...
        

755
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,860
...but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.
...              

756
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,330
Get us another seat on the plane.
        

757
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:27,440
If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement...
               ...

758
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:31,280
...when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life.
...                   

759
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:34,150
Complete the job en route...
          ...

760
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,790
...I make one phone call from the plane...
...         ...

761
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,860
...you have no trouble getting through Immigration.
...         

762
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:56,100
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
-    
-   

763
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:57,830
Thank you.
  

764
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,740
Excuse me, I think this is yours? You must have dropped it.
           ?       

765
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,810
Would you care for a drink?
      ?

766
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,280
Oh. Water, please.
    

767
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,750
Oh, um, same, please.
    

768
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,020
Um...
 ...

769
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,850
Thank you.
  

770
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,890
You know, I couldn't help but notice...
           

771
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:50,650
...but you wouldn't happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer, would you?
...                  ?

772
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,320
Yes, he, um...
    

773
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,260
He was my father.
    

774
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:59,730
Well, he was a very inspiring figure. I'm sorry for your loss.
             

775
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:04,370
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
-  
-   

776
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,870
Hey.
 

777
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,900
To your father.
    

778
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,740
May he rest in peace, huh?
    

779
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,520
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.
-         ?
-     

780
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,750
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff?
        

781
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,010
Ha, ha, bloody ha.
         

782
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,160
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.
            

783
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,860
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try...?
- Walk away.
-          ?
-   

784
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,160
Just have him ca... I gotta go.
         

785
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,450
All right. Taxi. Thank you.
        

786
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,260
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.
           

787
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:12,170
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.
-     ?
-             

788
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,830
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.
-   
-        

789
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,840
Maybe not. Can you pull over and get this...?
         ...?

790
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,140
Great.
  

791
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,550
Come on.
  

792
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:41,290
There's $500 in there. The wallet's worth more than that.
   500        

793
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,160
You might at least drop me at my stop.
      

794
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,430
I'm afraid that it doesn't...
      ...

795
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,940
- Cover him!
- Down! Down now!
-    !
-       !

796
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:57,740
What the hell is going on?
      ?

797
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,720
This wasn't in the design.
        

798
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,020
Cobb?
   

799
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,280
Cobb?
   

800
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,400
Get him!
   !

801
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,520
Are you all right?
    ?

802
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,880
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
         

803
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,950
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.
           

804
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,350
Saito?
  ?

805
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,400
Get Fischer in the back room now.
        

806
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:37,410
- Get him in the back room. Move.
- What the hell happened?
-         
-     ?

807
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:39,320
Has he been shot? Is he dying?
    ?      ?

808
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,210
- I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.
-    
-    

809
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,820
- What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.
-           ?
-        

810
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:45,960
Why put a train in a downtown intersection?
               ?

811
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,720
- I didn't.
- Where'd it come from?
-     
-        ?

812
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:49,550
Why the hell were we ambushed?
                ?

813
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:53,130
Those were not normal projections. They'd been trained, for God's sakes.
                     

814
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,860
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...
-          
-          ...

815
01:07:56,030 --> 01:08:00,230
...teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized.
...          
             

816
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,030
It should've shown in the research.
           

817
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,000
- Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.
-         ?
-    

818
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,510
Don't tell me to calm down!
       !

819
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,610
This was your job, goddamn it! This was your responsibility!
                !

820
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,840
You were meant to check Fischer's background!
             !

821
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:14,350
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!
-          !
-              !

822
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,610
We'll be more careful and we're gonna be fine!
            !

823
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:18,580
This was not a part of the plan! He's dying.
        !         

824
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,810
Put him out his misery.
     

825
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:22,820
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.
-           !
-     

826
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:25,090
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.
         

827
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,160
No. It won't wake him up.
         

828
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:30,930
What do you mean, it won't wake him up? When we die in a dream, we wake up.
            ?
            

829
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,360
Not from this.
    

830
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:35,060
We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.
               

831
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:37,370
Right. So, what happens when we die?
           ?

832
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,370
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?
-       
-      ?

833
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,070
- Limbo?
- Unconstructed dream space.
-     ?
-        

834
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:45,510
- Well, what the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.
-           ?
-          

835
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:48,880
Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind...
                ...

836
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:51,950
...by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.
...           

837
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,020
Which, in our case, is just you.
        

838
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:56,890
- How long could we be stuck?
- Can't even think about...
-        ?
-        

839
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,460
- ...trying to escape until the sedation...
- How long?
- ...             ...
-   ?

840
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:02,860
Decades. It could be infinite. Ask him, he's the one who's been there.
                    

841
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:04,230
Let's get him upstairs.
     

842
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,300
Great.
   

843
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:09,770
Thank you.
  

844
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:13,710
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army.
               
         

845
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,350
And if we get killed...
       

846
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:18,740
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?
...                    ?

847
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,490
Someone got first aid?
      ?

848
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,220
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.
-               ?
-         

849
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,330
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.
-         
-      

850
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,830
This was the only way to go three layers deep.
           

851
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,030
You knew about this and went along with it?
            ?

852
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,230
I trusted him.
    

853
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:44,310
When? When he promised you half his share?
    ?           ?

854
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,740
No. His whole share. Besides, he said he'd done it before.
                    

855
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,970
What, with Mal? Because that worked so good?
       ?      ?
         ?

856
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:53,580
That has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to to get to my children.
                   

857
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,650
You led us into a war zone with no way out?
             ?

858
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:59,850
There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible...
                    ...

859
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,360
...and we get out using the kick, just like before.
...             

860
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:04,990
Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes.
                 

861
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,030
I am sitting this one out on this level.
          

862
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,630
Fischer's security is surrounding this place.
                    

863
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,060
Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.
                

864
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,970
That means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee you.
                    

865
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:20,340
We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.
                

866
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:24,380
Downwards is the only way forwards.
        

867
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:27,080
Get ready.
   

868
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,450
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.
 ,       

869
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:37,320
I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million.
           

870
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,430
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.
-         
-   !     

871
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,860
In your father's office, below the bookshelves...
             ...

872
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,090
...is his personal safe. We need the combination.
...                

873
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:47,870
I don't know any safe.
         

874
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:50,940
That doesn't mean you don't know the combination.
            

875
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,910
Tell us what it is.
         

876
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,510
I don't know.
    

877
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:03,580
We have it on good authority you do know.
                

878
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,090
Yeah? Whose authority?
  ?    ?

879
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:11,080
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
- What's inside it?
-         
-      ?

880
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,130
Cash, cards, ID. And this.
             

881
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,660
Useful?
   ?

882
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:23,430
Maybe.
  

883
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:25,710
You're on. You've got an hour.
          

884
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,130
An hour?
   ?

885
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,710
I was supposed to have all night to crack this.
         

886
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,480
And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
         

887
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:36,810
You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please.
                 

888
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,790
- What's that?
- Good authority.
-     ?
-      

889
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:47,730
Uncle Peter.
    

890
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:50,560
Just make them stop.
     

891
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:53,200
- The combination.
- I don't know it.
-   
-     

892
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:56,030
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.
-          ?
-    

893
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,680
Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.
             

894
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,740
You have one hour. Start talking.
           

895
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:06,940
You all right?
    ?

896
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,150
You okay?
    ?

897
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:17,520
Those bastards have had at me for two days.
          

898
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,660
They have someone with access to your father's office.
            

899
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:22,700
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.
-           
-   

900
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:25,600
They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it.
               

901
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:28,500
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?
-          
-   ?

902
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:32,500
Maurice told me that when he passed, you were the only one able to open it.
                  

903
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,200
No, he never gave me any combination.
             

904
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:40,080
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just didn't know it was a combination.
                   

905
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:41,450
Well, what, then?
    ?

906
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:44,140
I don't know, some meaningful combination of numbers...
                 ...

907
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:48,260
...based on your experiences with Maurice.
...            

908
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,900
We didn't have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together.
              

909
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:56,100
Perhaps after your mother died.
          

910
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,900
After my mother died, you know what he told me?
              ?

911
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:08,160
"Robert, there's really nothing to be said."
"           "

912
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,680
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.
       

913
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:13,540
I was 11, Uncle Peter.
    11      

914
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,550
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.
-     ?
-     

915
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:21,310
When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.
                  

916
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:22,720
And if he dies?
      ?

917
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,360
Worst-case scenario?
      

918
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:28,220
When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.
           

919
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,460
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.
            

920
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:34,330
I appreciate that, Saito.
       

921
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,560
But when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.
                    

922
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:40,770
Limbo is gonna become your reality.
           

923
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:44,710
You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.
               

924
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:46,510
Filled with regret?
    ?

925
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:49,040
Waiting to die alone.
     

926
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,810
No.
 

927
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:53,010
I'll come back.
     

928
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,480
And we'll be young men together again.
         

929
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,520
Breathe.
  

930
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,720
These people are gonna kill us if we don't give them the combination.
                

931
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,800
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.
-        
-         

932
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:12,870
They're gonna lock us in that van, and then drive it into the river.
                 

933
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,510
All right. What is in the safe?
          ?

934
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:16,770
Something for you.
     

935
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:21,540
Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.
                  

936
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,340
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
-     
-            -     

937
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,750
That's an alternate.
     

938
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,290
This would supersede the other if you want it to.
                 

939
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,090
It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.
             

940
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:35,960
It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
                 

941
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,600
Destroying my whole inheritance?
          ?

942
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:43,430
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.
-         ?
-      

943
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:48,280
He loved you, Robert.
       

944
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,470
In his own way.
       

945
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:52,440
In his own way.
     

946
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,270
At the end...
    

947
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,750
...he called me in to his deathbed.
...        

948
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,090
He could barely speak.
        

949
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:06,390
But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.
              

950
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,520
He pulled me close.
     

951
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,290
And I could only make out...
       

952
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:17,600
...one word.
...   

953
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:23,280
"Disappointed."
"  "

954
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,110
When were you in limbo?
           ?

955
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:35,180
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job.
             

956
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,720
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?
-          
-   ?     ?

957
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:42,060
The truth that, at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall.
                   

958
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:46,290
The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.
                 

959
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:48,870
And the truth that, as we go deeper into Fischer...
                 ...

960
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,830
...we're also going deeper into you.
...           

961
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:54,940
And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.
             

962
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,410
We were working together.
        

963
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:04,250
We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.
           

964
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:05,710
I kept pushing things.
      

965
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,460
I wanted to go deeper and deeper. I wanted to go further.
               

966
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:14,840
I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there...
                    

967
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:17,740
...that we could get trapped so deep...
..      ...

968
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:21,880
...that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious...
...               

969
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,010
... we lost sight of what was real.
...          

970
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:33,650
...We created. We built the world for ourselves.
                

971
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,290
We did that for years.
     

972
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:40,400
We built our own world.
          

973
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:43,470
How long were you stuck there?
       ?

974
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,730
Something like 50 years.
   50  

975
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:51,310
Jesus.
  

976
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:54,950
How could you stand it?
      ?

977
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,850
It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods.
              

978
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:01,050
The problem was knowing that none of it was real.
             

979
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:05,630
Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that.
            

980
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:07,190
And what about for her?
    

981
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:14,570
She had locked something away, something deep inside her.
               

982
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:21,200
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
                

983
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:26,640
Limbo became her reality.
            

984
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,780
What happened when you woke up?
       

985
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,980
Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades...
                ...

986
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:39,550
... to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?
...            ?

987
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:44,230
I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn't admit it.
               

988
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,870
Eventually, she told me the truth.
          

989
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,670
She was possessed by an idea.
         

990
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:57,540
This one very simple idea that changed everything.
           

991
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,150
That our world wasn't real.
               

992
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:06,350
That she needed to wake up to come back to reality...
            ...

993
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:09,250
...that in order to get back home...
...      

994
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,290
...we had to kill ourselves.
...       

995
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:22,390
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...
-            
-          

996
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:25,560
... that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.
...               

997
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,440
- I'm their mother!
- Calm down.
-         
-    

998
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:28,870
I can tell the difference.
           

999
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,380
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?
                   

1000
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:33,240
You don't know you're dreaming!
           

1001
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,610
She was certain there was nothing I could do...
             ...

1002
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:39,620
...no matter how much I begged, no matter how much I pleaded.
...            

1003
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:45,620
She wanted to do it, but she could not do it alone.
                  

1004
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:52,290
She loved me too much, so she came up with a plan on our anniversary.
        
                 

1005
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:21,160
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.
-           
-      

1006
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:25,600
Just... Just step back inside. All right? Just step back inside now, come on.
           

1007
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:30,200
No. I'm going to jump, and you're coming with me.
               

1008
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:32,070
No, I'm not.
      

1009
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,330
Now, you listen to me.
   

1010
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:39,180
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up, remember? You're gonna die.
                  

1011
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,280
Now, just step back inside.
   

1012
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:44,180
Come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this.
             

1013
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:46,290
We've talked enough.
       

1014
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,020
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...
-   
-       ...

1015
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:52,890
- ...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.
- ...         
-   

1016
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:58,960
We're gonna talk about this.
      

1017
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,000
All right?
   

1018
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:06,230
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.
-        
-        

1019
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:10,200
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.
             

1020
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,140
Take a second, think about our children.
       

1021
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,040
Think about James.
     

1022
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,410
Think about Phillipa, now.
     

1023
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:20,520
If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway.
                

1024
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:23,990
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...
-      
-           ...

1025
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:27,760
...explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.
...         

1026
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,130
How you've threatened to kill me.
         

1027
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,560
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.
-         
-       

1028
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,500
Why did...? Why would you do this to me?
   ...          

1029
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:42,540
I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
             

1030
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:45,740
We're going home to our real children.
           

1031
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:49,540
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me, all right? Mal, look at me, please?
                     

1032
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,020
You're waiting for a train.
        

1033
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,080
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.
-          
-         

1034
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,250
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!
           

1035
01:20:57,430 --> 01:21:01,260
You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure.
                    

1036
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:03,630
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.
-   ,    
-      

1037
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,000
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.
-              
-          

1038
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:11,000
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!
               

1039
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,610
Jesus Christ!
     

1040
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:19,840
She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists.
              

1041
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:24,210
It made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness.
            

1042
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:25,610
So I ran.
     

1043
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,690
Right now, or never, Cobb.
              

1044
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:40,690
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!
                

1045
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:42,030
All right, let's go.
     

1046
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:46,370
I left my children behind and I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.
                

1047
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:50,810
Your guilt defines her. It's what powers her.
          

1048
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:54,280
But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.
          

1049
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,080
And if we are gonna succeed in this...
        ...

1050
01:21:58,250 --> 01:22:03,210
...you have to forgive yourself, and you're gonna have to confront her.
...             

1051
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,220
But you don't have to do that alone.
           

1052
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:07,660
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.
-      
-         

1053
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:13,430
Because they have no idea the risk they've taken coming down here with you.
                     

1054
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,000
We have to move.
     

1055
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,610
Time's up.
    

1056
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:24,510
All right. I don't know any combination.
        

1057
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,770
- Not consciously, anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?
-         
-        ?

1058
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:31,890
I got somebody in your father's office right now ready to tap in the combination.
                   

1059
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:34,950
Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now.
              

1060
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,350
- I have no idea.
- Right now!
-     
-     

1061
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:39,760
I said, right now! Right now!
         

1062
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:43,830
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.
5,2,8,4,9,1

1063
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,690
You'll have to do better than that.
      

1064
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:53,200
All right. Bag them. You're going for a ride.
             

1065
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:01,710
We're worth more to you alive. You hear me?
               

1066
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:08,480
What'd you get?
       

1067
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:11,420
Relationship with his father is worse than we imagined.
                

1068
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:12,620
This helps us how?
     

1069
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:15,890
The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis.
                 

1070
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:20,190
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.
-                 
-      

1071
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:23,900
Work faster. The projections are closing in quick.
              

1072
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:27,630
We gotta break out of here before we're totally boxed in.
             

1073
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:03,770
Damn it.
  

1074
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:06,940
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.
           

1075
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:26,690
We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.
                   

1076
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:30,900
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...
-               
-               ...

1077
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:33,370
...whilst exposing his godfather's true nature.
...           

1078
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:36,530
We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job.
                  

1079
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,080
His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper.
                      

1080
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:41,740
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.
-              
-   

1081
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:43,580
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.
-         
-       

1082
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:47,280
The second we get into that hotel his security's gonna be all over us.
              
            

1083
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,550
We run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job.
                  

1084
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,060
- You've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't work.
-      ?
-       

1085
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:55,720
The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
           
             

1086
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:57,920
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?
               

1087
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,190
- I need some kind of distraction.
- No problem.
-          
-    

1088
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:02,560
How about a lovely lady that I've used before?
              

1089
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:04,800
Listen to me. You drive carefully, all right?
            

1090
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:07,440
Everything down there is gonna be unstable as hell.
          

1091
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:15,350
Don't jump too soon. We only got one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.
                     

1092
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,820
I'll play the music to let you know it's coming. The rest is on you.
                    

1093
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,780
- You ready?
- Ready!
-       
-      

1094
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,120
Sweet dreams.
    

1095
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:25,190
Am I boring you?
         

1096
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:29,690
I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn't to your liking.
                 

1097
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:34,200
Um, I have a lot on my mind.
     

1098
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,330
There goes Mr. Charles.
       

1099
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,670
Mr. Fischer, right?
          

1100
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:48,340
Pleasure to see you again. Rod Green from marketing. L...
                   

1101
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,640
Hmm.
 

1102
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:52,480
- And you must be?
- Leaving.
-     
-   

1103
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,850
In case you get bored.
      

1104
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:03,460
Must've blown you off.
        

1105
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:06,360
That is, unless her phone number really is only six digits.
            6  

1106
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:12,970
Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that.
              

1107
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:19,240
Goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least 500...
            500...

1108
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:20,540
About $500, right?
500      

1109
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,680
Don't worry about it. My people are already on it as we speak.
                    

1110
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:25,790
Who or what is Mr. Charles?
             

1111
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:29,680
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.
                    

1112
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,190
And why don't you approve?
           

1113
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,350
It involves telling the mark that he's dreaming...
              ...

1114
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:35,660
...which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.
...         

1115
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:38,770
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.
-             
-  

1116
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:40,700
So now you've noticed how much time...
        ...

1117
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:43,500
...Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.
...           

1118
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,000
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?
          

1119
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:49,610
- I'm sorry, but...
- Hold on! Wait!
-     ...
-    

1120
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:52,240
You look a bit perkier.
      

1121
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:54,750
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
         

1122
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:02,480
Turbulence on the plane?
       ?

1123
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,350
No, it's much closer.
         

1124
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:06,190
That's Yusuf's driving.
      

1125
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:17,000
Um, I'm sorry. Who did you say you were?
            

1126
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:19,270
Rod Green from marketing.
         

1127
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,030
But that's not true at all, is it?
          

1128
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:26,600
My name is Mr. Charles. You remember me, don't you?
                

1129
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,780
I'm the head of your security down here.
            

1130
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:31,990
Get out on a different floor, keep moving.
          

1131
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:34,490
Dump the wallet. Security will be looking for that.
            

1132
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:38,150
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.
-   
-              

1133
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,350
Security, huh?
  ?

1134
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,960
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.
-          ?
-    

1135
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:52,730
I specialize in a very specific type of security.
          

1136
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,800
Subconscious security.
         

1137
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,070
You're talking about dreams?
       

1138
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:00,110
Are you talking about, um, extraction?
       ?

1139
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,550
I am here to protect you.
        

1140
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,520
Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you in the event...
              ...

1141
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:22,070
...that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.
...               

1142
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,870
You're not safe here.
       

1143
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:27,300
They're coming for you.
       

1144
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:47,690
Strange weather, isn't it?
          

1145
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:53,660
You feel that?
       

1146
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,830
What's happening?
    

1147
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:00,240
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream...
               ...

1148
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:03,280
...which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.
...             

1149
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,500
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.
            

1150
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,390
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.
-          
-           

1151
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,080
We should probably get out of here.
     

1152
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:36,940
You feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.
                      

1153
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:41,100
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity.
               

1154
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,450
None of this is real. You're in a dream.
           

1155
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,490
Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself...
               ...

1156
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:55,750
...is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?
...                     

1157
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:57,890
Yeah, I...
    

1158
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:00,590
No, breathe, breathe. Remember your training.
              

1159
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:05,930
Accept the fact that you're in a dream, and I'm here to protect you. Go on.
                     

1160
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,310
Mm-hm.

1161
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:13,940
- You're not real?
- No.
-        ?
-   

1162
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:17,480
No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.
             

1163
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:19,750
I was sent here to protect you in the event...
        ...

1164
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,820
...that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.
...           

1165
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:26,220
And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer.
                 

1166
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,350
Yeah.
  

1167
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:29,620
Okay.
  

1168
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:31,760
Okay.
  

1169
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,590
Can you get me out of here?
         

1170
01:30:37,510 --> 01:30:40,100
Right away. Follow me.
          

1171
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,650
Hold on a second.
  

1172
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,430
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?
         

1173
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:04,860
These men were sent here to abduct you, all right?
            

1174
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:07,590
If you want my help, you have to remain calm.
               

1175
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:11,640
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.
            

1176
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:26,950
If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?
                    

1177
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,210
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer.
                    

1178
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:32,880
I believe they have you sedated, and if you pull that trigger...
                    ...

1179
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,220
...you may not wake up.
...         

1180
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:39,660
You may go into a further dream state. Now, you know what I'm talking about.
                    

1181
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,660
You remember the training.
     

1182
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:46,210
Remember what I said to you.
           

1183
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,240
Give me the gun.
    

1184
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,650
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.
-        528   ?
-   

1185
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:13,520
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.
             

1186
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:17,540
What do you remember from before this dream?
            

1187
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:20,530
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.
      

1188
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:23,300
There was rain.
   

1189
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,440
Uncle Peter.
    

1190
01:32:25,710 --> 01:32:29,340
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?
-       
-            

1191
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:35,650
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.
-        
-       

1192
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:37,920
You're in the back of a van. Keep going.
           

1193
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:40,360
It had something to do with, um...
     

1194
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,860
Something to do with a safe.
       

1195
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,130
God, why is it so hard to remember?
         

1196
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:49,000
It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.
                

1197
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:50,900
Listen, it takes years of practice.
        

1198
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:53,470
You and Browning have been pulled into this dream...
             ...

1199
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,410
...because they're trying to steal something from your mind.
...                 

1200
01:32:56,580 --> 01:33:00,140
I need you to focus and try and remember what that is.
             

1201
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:01,940
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!
             

1202
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:05,850
A combination. They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.
                   

1203
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:08,750
They're trying to extract a number from your subconscious.
                

1204
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:12,690
It can represent anything. We're in a hotel right now.
                 

1205
01:33:13,490 --> 01:33:16,620
We should try hotel rooms. What was the number, Mr. Fischer?
                

1206
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,630
Try and remember for me. This is very important.
          

1207
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,130
Five.

1208
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,540
Five, two... It was something, it was a long number.
5 2 ...        

1209
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:26,800
That's good. We can start there. Fifth floor.
          5 

1210
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:28,000
Yep.
 

1211
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:32,200
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.
-          
-          

1212
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:35,680
While you're all asleep in 528, I wait for Yusuf's kick.
    528             

1213
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:37,980
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.
-            
-      

1214
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:42,090
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.
                

1215
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:45,450
So we get a nice synchronized kick.
         

1216
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:48,030
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.
                 

1217
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,460
But if it's too late, I won't be able to drop us.
             

1218
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:55,430
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.
-      ?
-            

1219
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:58,800
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.
-              
-   

1220
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:06,680
They're with me. Go on.
      

1221
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:32,030
Mr. Charles.
     

1222
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:35,180
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.
-                
-    

1223
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:37,400
They were trying to put you under.
            

1224
01:34:37,850 --> 01:34:39,900
- I'm already under.
- Under again.
-        
-     

1225
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,640
What do you mean, a dream within a dream?
          

1226
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:45,720
Hey. I see you've changed.
       

1227
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:47,510
I'm sorry?
   

1228
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:51,890
Oh, I'm sorry. I mistook you for a friend.
              

1229
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,320
Oh.
 

1230
01:34:53,490 --> 01:34:55,620
Good-Iooking fellow, I'm sure.
        

1231
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:59,230
No, no, no. That's Fischer's projection of Browning.
                

1232
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,270
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.
            

1233
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,400
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...
-     
-            ...

1234
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:06,900
...if Fischer is starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to.
...                   

1235
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:08,100
Shh.
 

1236
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:15,170
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?
-     
-            ?

1237
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:18,790
Well, not exactly. They already had him. They were torturing him.
                 

1238
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:20,420
And you saw them torture him?
         ?

1239
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,790
The kidnappers are working for you?
       ?

1240
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:32,230
Robert.
   

1241
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:36,230
You're trying to get that safe open? To get the alternate will?
              ?

1242
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:40,870
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life. I can't let you destroy it.
                      

1243
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,410
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
                   

1244
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:47,740
I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.
                

1245
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:51,580
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?
-      
-             

1246
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:53,690
That's his last insult.
          

1247
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:57,480
A challenge for you to build something for yourself...
            ...

1248
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:01,460
...by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.
...            

1249
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:12,500
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.
-         
-    

1250
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:16,970
But he's wrong.
    

1251
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:20,340
You can build a better company than he ever did.
           

1252
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:22,950
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.
          

1253
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,210
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.
-      
-          

1254
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:28,150
He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is.
               

1255
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,760
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.
                

1256
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:39,390
We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
                      

1257
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,140
All right.
  

1258
01:36:48,110 --> 01:36:49,370
- He's out.
- Wait.
-     
-   

1259
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:51,600
Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?
             

1260
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:53,110
We're going into Fischer's.
    

1261
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,980
I told him it was Browning's so he'd be a part of our team.
               
          

1263
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:58,480
He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.
              

1264
01:36:58,650 --> 01:37:00,210
That's right.
   

1265
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:02,450
Security's gonna run you down hard.
          

1266
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:04,960
And I will lead them on a merry chase.
          

1267
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:08,150
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.
-         
-          

1268
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:14,560
You good?
    ?

1269
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:19,070
Hey. You ready?
       

1270
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,840
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.
        

1271
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:36,720
Cobb?
  ?

1272
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:39,830
Cobb? What's down there?
         

1273
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,790
Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn.
               

1274
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:47,870
I mean, what's down there for you?
                

1275
01:40:24,460 --> 01:40:26,220
Did you see that?
    

1276
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:46,540
Eames, this is your dream.
          

1277
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:49,810
I need you to draw the security away from the complex, understand?
               

1278
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:51,780
- Who guides Fischer in?
- Not me.
-        ?
-    

1279
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:54,420
If I know the route, everything could be compromised.
                 

1280
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:57,110
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.
-         
-         

1281
01:40:57,290 --> 01:40:58,820
I could do it.
   

1282
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,690
All right. Brief him on the route into the complex.
             

1283
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:06,060
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?
-         
-       

1284
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:09,070
You keep this live. I'll be listening in the whole time.
            

1285
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:13,370
The windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower.
                    

1286
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:14,840
You're not coming in?
    ?

1287
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:17,340
In order to find out the truth about your father...
            ...

1288
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:20,540
...you're gonna need to break into Browning's mind on your own.
...             

1289
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:22,880
Come on, Fischer!
        

1290
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:21,630
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!
-         
-       

1291
01:42:21,810 --> 01:42:23,330
Move!
   

1292
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:25,940
Go!
  

1293
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,190
Sod it.
 

1294
01:42:53,370 --> 01:42:55,030
I hope you're ready.
         

1295
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:05,550
No, it's too soon.
        

1296
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:13,250
Cobb, do you hear that?
        

1297
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:16,990
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago, I thought it was the wind up here.
 20               

1298
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:20,020
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.
        

1299
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,600
So, what do we do?
      

1300
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:23,170
We move fast.
    

1301
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:30,910
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.
 10        

1302
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:35,150
Which gives Arthur three minutes.
       

1303
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,180
- Hey!
- That's him!
-   
-    

1304
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:40,580
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.
-          
- 60  

1305
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:44,020
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.
-              
-           

1306
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:47,060
Then they need a new route, a more direct route.
                

1307
01:43:58,270 --> 01:43:59,900
It's designed as a labyrinth.
         

1308
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:02,540
There must be access routes that cut through the maze.
           

1309
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:04,300
Eames?
     

1310
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:28,660
Did Eames add any features?
           

1311
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:30,300
I don't think I should tell you.
      

1312
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:32,770
We don't have time for this. Did he add anything?
               

1313
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:35,970
He added an air-duct system that can cut through the maze.
                 

1314
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:37,340
Good. Explain it to them.
       

1315
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:38,740
- Saito?
- Go ahead.
-   ?
-  

1316
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,640
Paradox.
   

1317
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,580
- What was that?
- The kick.
-      
-   

1318
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:28,090
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?
                 

1319
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,950
Yeah, we missed it.
      

1320
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:31,320
Man.
   

1321
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:35,790
Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh?
            

1322
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:37,230
Uh-huh.

1323
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:40,130
Well, what the hell do we do now?
        

1324
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,130
We finish the job before the next kick.
           

1325
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,400
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.
-           
-       

1326
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:10,700
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
               

1327
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:12,700
If you need help, hang up...
            

1328
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:16,230
How do I drop you without gravity?
           

1329
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:21,400
Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20.
          20  

1330
01:47:44,830 --> 01:47:46,490
You okay?
     

1331
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:54,840
Run! Turn around! Move to base! Move to base!
                

1332
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:56,530
Go, go, go!
      

1333
01:47:58,710 --> 01:47:59,870
There's something wrong.
      

1334
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:02,380
They're heading your way, like they know something.
                   

1335
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:05,850
Just buy us more time, all right?
            

1336
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:07,850
- Come on!
- On my way.
-    
-   

1337
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:09,720
Come on! Move!
      

1338
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:35,430
All right.
 

1339
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:50,420
Okay. That's the antechamber outside the strong room.
         

1340
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:54,080
- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.
-         
-         

1341
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:56,490
Let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.
              

1342
01:49:58,130 --> 01:50:01,460
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.
-              
-   

1343
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:05,000
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.
-         ?
-         

1344
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:33,030
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.
-     
-            

1345
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,030
There's an entire army headed your way.
            

1346
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:03,230
I'm in.
    

1347
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:09,660
There he is.
   

1348
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:54,940
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.
-      
-              

1349
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,680
Come on. Come on, a little lower.
       

1350
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:05,580
Cobb.
  

1351
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:08,750
No, she is not real.
        

1352
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,590
How do you know that?
      

1353
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:14,390
She is just a projection. Fischer. Fischer is real.
               

1354
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:19,930
Hello.
  

1355
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:27,810
Eames! Eames, get to the antechamber now!
              

1356
01:53:11,730 --> 01:53:14,590
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.
-        
-         

1357
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:18,890
I couldn't shoot her.
     

1358
01:53:19,570 --> 01:53:22,930
There's no use in reviving him. His mind's already trapped down there.
                 

1359
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:24,160
It's all over.
      

1360
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:27,530
So that's it, then? We failed?
     ?      ?

1361
01:53:28,170 --> 01:53:30,340
We're done. I'm sorry.
       

1362
01:53:34,210 --> 01:53:36,840
It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?
               

1363
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:41,450
Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.
                  
       

1364
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:43,680
Let's set the charges.
        

1365
01:53:45,530 --> 01:53:47,020
No, there's still another way.
        

1366
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:51,730
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.
-              
-     

1367
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:54,730
No, but there will be enough time down there.
         

1368
01:53:55,870 --> 01:53:56,960
And we will find him.
      

1369
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:01,070
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive him.
                  

1370
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:04,140
We can give him his own kick down below.
              

1371
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:06,870
Look, you get him in there.
       

1372
01:54:07,050 --> 01:54:09,910
As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital...
            ...

1373
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,880
...and we all ride the kick back up the layers.
...                

1374
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:18,850
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges.
                         

1375
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:21,120
Saito will never make it, will he?
        

1376
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:25,630
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.
-          
-   

1377
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:28,730
If you are not back before the kick, I am gone with or without you.
                  

1378
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:32,130
She's right. She's right. Come on. Let's go.
         

1379
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:38,570
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?
              

1380
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:39,940
Mal's gonna be down there.
      

1381
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:42,550
I know where to find her. She'll have Fischer.
                 

1382
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:46,620
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.
-       
-           

1383
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:48,950
She wants me back down there with her.
                

1384
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:16,740
All right?
    

1385
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:26,650
- This is your world?
- It was.
-        ?
-    

1386
01:55:27,460 --> 01:55:29,390
And this is where she'll be.
     

1387
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:31,690
Come on.
  

1388
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:20,650
Saito. Saito.
     

1389
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:25,040
I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?
                

1390
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:28,650
No room for tourists on these jobs.
       

1391
01:56:31,290 --> 01:56:32,450
Don't be silly.
   

1392
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:07,020
You built all this? This is incredible.
       ?     

1393
01:57:07,490 --> 01:57:09,520
We built for years.
         

1394
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,550
Then we started in on the memories.
          

1395
01:57:19,610 --> 01:57:21,010
This way.
   

1396
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:04,780
This was our neighborhood.
       

1397
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:07,280
Places from our past.
          

1398
01:58:07,450 --> 01:58:09,220
That was our first apartment.
          

1399
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:11,620
Then we moved to that building right there.
             

1400
01:58:11,790 --> 01:58:14,320
After Mal became pregnant, that became our home.
           

1401
01:58:14,490 --> 01:58:17,290
You reconstructed all of this from memory?
            ?

1402
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:19,730
Like I told you, we had lots of time.
            

1403
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:21,490
What is that?
     

1404
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,800
That's the house Mal grew up in.
       

1405
01:58:24,970 --> 01:58:27,410
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.
-        
-   

1406
01:58:27,740 --> 01:58:28,760
Come on.
  

1407
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:32,270
We both wanted to live in a house, but we loved this type of building.
                      

1408
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:35,380
In the real world, we'd have to choose, but not here.
                    

1409
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:17,980
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?
            

1410
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:20,830
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick.
           

1411
01:59:20,990 --> 01:59:22,390
What?
   

1412
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:24,490
I'm gonna improvise.
     

1413
01:59:24,660 --> 01:59:29,330
Listen, there's something you should know about me. About inception.
                   

1414
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:46,280
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.
              

1415
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:48,680
Highly contagious.
     

1416
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:52,190
And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.
             

1417
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:55,230
It can grow to define...
       ...

1418
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:57,820
...or destroy you.
...       

1419
02:00:00,970 --> 02:00:03,730
The smallest idea, such
        

1420
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:06,700
"Your world is not real."
"         "

1421
02:00:06,970 --> 02:00:10,740
Simple little thought that changes everything.
             

1422
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:16,470
So certain of your world. Of what's real.
                

1423
02:00:16,650 --> 02:00:18,450
Do you think he is?
         

1424
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:23,150
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?
             ?

1425
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:25,780
I know what's real, Mal.
            

1426
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:30,160
No creeping doubts?
         

1427
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:33,490
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?
          

1428
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:35,130
Chased around the globe...
          ...

1429
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:37,960
...by anonymous corporations and police forces...
...     ...

1430
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:40,770
...the way the projections persecute the dreamer?
...             ?

1431
02:00:42,380 --> 02:00:43,870
Admit it.
   

1432
02:00:45,180 --> 02:00:48,010
You don't believe in one reality anymore.
        

1433
02:00:48,180 --> 02:00:49,710
So choose.
    

1434
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:52,150
Choose to be here.
     

1435
02:00:52,650 --> 02:00:54,140
Choose me.
    

1436
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:21,270
You know what I have to do.
        

1437
02:01:21,450 --> 02:01:24,110
I have to get back to our children because you left them.
                 

1438
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:26,980
Because you left us.
        

1439
02:01:27,150 --> 02:01:28,950
- You're wrong. 
- I'm not wrong.
-    
-    

1440
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:31,150
You're confused.
    

1441
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:34,320
Our children are here.
        

1442
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:38,360
And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?
            

1443
02:01:38,530 --> 02:01:41,590
Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal.
                 

1444
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:57,240
Up above?
  ?

1445
02:01:58,150 --> 02:02:01,780
Listen to yourself. These are our children.
                 

1446
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:03,690
Watch.
  

1447
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:05,890
James? Phillipa?
        

1448
02:02:06,060 --> 02:02:08,490
Don't do this, Mal. Please. Those aren't my children.
                  

1449
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:11,130
You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it.
             

1450
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:13,200
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?
-      
-         

1451
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:15,900
What if I'm what's real?
          

1452
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:19,330
You keep telling yourself what you know.
           

1453
02:02:20,910 --> 02:02:23,140
But what do you believe?
         

1454
02:02:24,110 --> 02:02:25,340
What do you feel?
        

1455
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:28,910
Guilt.
   

1456
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:32,350
I feel guilt, Mal.
        

1457
02:02:32,890 --> 02:02:36,820
And no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am...
             ...

1458
02:02:36,990 --> 02:02:41,260
...no matter how confused, that guilt is always there...
...             ...

1459
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:43,950
...reminding me of the truth.
...          

1460
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:45,760
What truth?
     

1461
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:53,430
That the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me.
         

1462
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:59,940
You planted the idea in my mind?
             ?

1463
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:02,940
What is she talking about?
      

1464
02:03:03,850 --> 02:03:09,120
The reason I knew inception was possible was because I did it to her first.
          
                

1465
02:03:10,160 --> 02:03:13,130
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?
-           
-     

1466
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:15,350
We were lost in here.
         

1467
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:20,930
I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it.
                

1468
02:03:24,140 --> 02:03:29,800
She had locked something away, something deep inside.
                  

1469
02:03:30,580 --> 02:03:34,710
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.
                 

1470
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:37,810
And she couldn't break free.
       

1471
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:43,250
So I decided to search for it.
        

1472
02:03:43,820 --> 02:03:48,690
I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.
                

1473
02:03:48,860 --> 02:03:50,760
And I broke in...
       ...

1474
02:03:51,330 --> 02:03:53,490
... and I planted an idea.
...       

1475
02:03:54,230 --> 02:03:58,000
A simple little idea that would change everything.
              

1476
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:05,610
That her world wasn't real.
           

1477
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:21,620
That death was the only escape.
        

1478
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:30,800
You're waiting for a train.
        

1479
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:35,840
A train that'll take you far away.
          

1480
02:04:37,010 --> 02:04:40,000
You know where you hope this train will take you...
             ...

1481
02:04:41,110 --> 02:04:43,140
...but you can't know for sure.
...      

1482
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,840
Yet it doesn't matter.
     

1483
02:04:47,290 --> 02:04:50,450
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!
-        
-           

1484
02:04:54,790 --> 02:04:58,860
But I never knew that that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer...
                       ...

1485
02:04:59,030 --> 02:05:01,430
... that even after she woke...
...        ...

1486
02:05:04,340 --> 02:05:06,800
That even after you came back to reality...
        ...

1487
02:05:09,740 --> 02:05:12,710
...that you'd continue to believe your world wasn't real.
...              

1488
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:17,880
That death was the only escape.
        

1489
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:20,710
Mal, no! Jesus!
           

1490
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:24,580
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.
-         
-         

1491
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:26,160
You betrayed me.
     

1492
02:05:26,990 --> 02:05:30,690
But you can make amends. You can still keep your promise.
              

1493
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:33,890
We can still be together, right here...
           ...

1494
02:05:34,070 --> 02:05:36,530
...in the world we built together.
...           

1495
02:06:57,350 --> 02:06:59,680
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.
           

1496
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:01,850
You can't have him.
       

1497
02:07:02,890 --> 02:07:06,320
- Lf I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?
-              
-       

1498
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,630
Fischer is on the porch.
       

1499
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:15,790
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.
-                 
-          

1500
02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:18,600
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.
               

1501
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:37,350
He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!
             

1502
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:41,190
- You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.
-       
-         

1503
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:46,460
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.
             

1504
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:50,120
That means he's down here somewhere. That means I have to find him.
              

1505
02:07:52,140 --> 02:07:55,230
I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.
                 

1506
02:07:55,410 --> 02:07:58,810
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
              

1507
02:07:58,980 --> 02:08:00,310
No.
 

1508
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:02,910
I wish.
     

1509
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:07,010
I wish more than anything, but...
             ...

1510
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:10,850
...I can't imagine you with all your complexity...
...          ...

1511
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:13,550
...all your perfection, all your imperfection.
...        

1512
02:08:14,660 --> 02:08:15,680
- You all right?
- Yeah.
-     ?
-   

1513
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:17,690
Look at you.
   

1514
02:08:18,930 --> 02:08:23,870
You're just a shade. You're just a shade of my real wife.
                  

1515
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:26,930
And you were the best that I could do, but...
               ...

1516
02:08:27,770 --> 02:08:30,210
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.
...          

1517
02:08:30,380 --> 02:08:32,000
Does this feel real?
       

1518
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:37,010
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.
-       
-     

1519
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:47,320
No, no, no!
      

1520
02:08:48,290 --> 02:08:50,690
In there, now. Go, go, go.
       

1521
02:09:35,540 --> 02:09:37,440
I was dis...
    

1522
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:41,480
I was dis... Disa...
    

1523
02:09:42,350 --> 02:09:44,870
- I know, Dad.
- Dis...
-       
-   

1524
02:09:50,890 --> 02:09:52,980
I know you were disappointed...
       ...

1525
02:09:53,790 --> 02:09:55,160
...I couldn't be you.
...         

1526
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:57,050
No.
 

1527
02:09:57,560 --> 02:09:58,790
No, no, no.
     

1528
02:09:59,830 --> 02:10:01,820
I was disappointed...
    ...

1529
02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:05,500
...that you tried.
...           

1530
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:30,420
What?
   

1531
02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:41,000
Come on, come on.
     

1532
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:12,730
Dad?
   

1533
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:54,140
That's the kick, Ariadne! You have to go now!
              

1534
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:10,430
Don't lose yourself! Find Saito and bring him back!
                  

1535
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:12,260
I will!
    

1536
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,170
You remember when you asked me to marry you?
          

1537
02:12:55,340 --> 02:12:56,430
Yes.
  

1538
02:12:56,610 --> 02:12:59,670
You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
           

1539
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:03,870
But we did.
            

1540
02:13:05,820 --> 02:13:08,180
We did. You don't remember?
           ?

1541
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:15,690
I miss you more than I can bear...
         ...

1542
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:20,050
...but we had our time together.
...         

1543
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:23,460
And I have to let you go.
        

1544
02:13:25,570 --> 02:13:27,370
I have to let you go.
      

1545
02:14:18,620 --> 02:14:19,920
I'm sorry, Robert.
       

1546
02:14:47,590 --> 02:14:51,250
You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man...
               ...

1547
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,350
...not just to live for him.
...          

1548
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:58,490
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.
          

1549
02:15:08,270 --> 02:15:09,500
What happened?
    

1550
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:11,670
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?
-      
-        

1551
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:13,110
No, to find Saito.
       

1552
02:15:15,380 --> 02:15:17,140
He'll be lost.
     

1553
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:21,520
No, he'll be all right.
       

1554
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:39,500
Have you come to kill me?
       ?

1555
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:46,240
I'm waiting for someone.
      

1556
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:53,480
Someone from a half-remembered dream.
        

1557
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:57,620
Cobb?
  ?

1558
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:01,320
Impossible.
   

1559
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:04,450
We were young men together.
        

1560
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:08,400
I'm an old man.
       

1561
02:16:09,630 --> 02:16:11,690
Filled with regret.
    

1562
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:17,540
Waiting to die alone.
    

1563
02:16:20,710 --> 02:16:22,870
I've come back for you.
       

1564
02:16:26,150 --> 02:16:30,020
To remind you of something.
       

1565
02:16:33,290 --> 02:16:35,660
Something you once knew.
         

1566
02:16:38,530 --> 02:16:40,760
That this world is not real.
        

1567
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:50,160
To convince me to honor our arrangement?
       ?

1568
02:16:51,010 --> 02:16:53,770
To take a leap of faith, yes.
     

1569
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:01,220
Come back...
   ...

1570
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:07,120
...so we can be young men together again.
...          

1571
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:12,860
Come back with me.
    

1572
02:17:15,970 --> 02:17:17,400
Come back.
   

1573
02:17:27,150 --> 02:17:28,840
Hot towel, sir?
         

1574
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:32,350
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 20 minutes.
     20           

1575
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:34,820
Do you need immigration forms?
            

1576
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:38,250
Thank you.
  

1577
02:17:38,720 --> 02:17:40,350
Hot towel, sir?
          

1578
02:17:41,360 --> 02:17:44,350
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?
-  
-            ?

1579
02:18:55,730 --> 02:18:56,790
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
         

1580
02:18:57,940 --> 02:18:59,560
Thank you, sir.
     

1581
02:19:43,620 --> 02:19:44,980
Welcome.
  

1582
02:19:45,450 --> 02:19:46,850
This way.
   

1583
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:11,500
James? Phillipa?
        

1584
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:16,510
Look who's here.
     

1585
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:23,180
Hey.
 

1586
02:20:24,290 --> 02:20:26,990
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- Daddy! Daddy!
-            
-       

1587
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:29,420
- Daddy!
- How are you?
-    
-     

1588
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:32,120
Look what I've been building!
       

1589
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:35,990
- What are you building?
- We're building a house on the cliff!
-       
-              

1590
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:39,030
On the cliff? Come on, I want you to show me. Can you show me?
   ?          

1591
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:41,760
- Let's go.
- Come on, Daddy!
-   
-       

1592
02:20:56,370 --> 02:20:59,490
       

1593
