1
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:27,059
Hey! Come here!
We have a man on the shore!

2
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:28,683
I'm on my way.

3
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:12,834
Are you here to kiII me?

4
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:23,005
I know what this is.

5
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:29,250
I've seen one before.
Many. many years ago.

6
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:35,761
It beIonged to a man I met
in a haIf-remembered dream.

7
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:42,862
A man possessed
of some radicaI notions.

8
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,608
What is the most resiIient parasite?

9
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:53,244
A bacteria? A virus?

10
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:55,076
An intestinaI worm?

11
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,644
Uh....

12
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,444
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say--

13
00:02:58,619 --> 00:02:59,813
An idea.

14
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:03,613
ResiIient. HighIy contagious.

15
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,784
Once an idea has taken hoId of the brain.
it's aImost impossibIe to eradicate.

16
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,495
An idea that is fuIIy formed.
fuIIy understood. that sticks.

17
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,895
Right in there somewhere.

18
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,626
For someone Iike you to steaI?

19
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:18,738
Yes. In the dream state.
your conscious defenses are Iowered...

20
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:21,340
...and that makes your thoughts
vuInerabIe to theft.

21
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,737
It's caIIed extraction.

22
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,471
Mr. Daito. we can train
your subconscious to defend itseIf...

23
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:29,138
...from even the most skiIIed extractor.

24
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:30,477
How can you do that?

25
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:33,484
Because I am the most skiIIed extractor.

26
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:37,356
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

27
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,460
And I can teach them to you.
so that even when you're asIeep...

28
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:42,960
...your defense is never down.

29
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:47,766
Look. if you want my heIp. you're gonna
have to be compIeteIy open with me.

30
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:51,302
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

31
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,770
...better than your therapist.
better than anyone.

32
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,870
If this is a dream.
and you have a safe fuII of secrets...

33
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:59,376
...I need to know what's in that safe.

34
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:03,005
In order for this aII to work.
you need to compIeteIy Iet me in.

35
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:10,516
Enjoy your evening. gentIemen.
as I consider your proposaI.

36
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:14,018
He knows.

37
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:18,531
What's going on up there?

38
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:15,381
Daito knows. He's pIaying with us.

39
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,122
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.

40
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,782
The information is in the safe.

41
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,121
He Iooked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

42
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,521
What's she doing here?

43
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:30,335
Just head back to the room.
AII right? I'II take care of this.

44
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,529
Okay. make sure you do.
We're here to work.

45
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:45,645
If I jumped. wouId I survive?

46
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,422
With a cIean dive. perhaps.

47
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,252
MaI. what are you doing here?

48
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,621
I thought you might be missing me.

49
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:56,055
You know that I am.

50
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,099
But I can't trust you anymore.

51
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,200
Do what?

52
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:05,966
Looks Iike Arthur's taste.

53
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,769
ActuaIIy. the subject is partiaI
to postwar British painters.

54
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,174
PIease. have a seat.

55
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:22,354
TeII me...

56
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,314
...do the chiIdren miss me?

57
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,357
You can't imagine.

58
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:35,627
What are you doing?

59
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:37,327
Just getting some fresh air.

60
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:39,501
Dtay where you are. MaI.

61
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,051
Goddamn it.

62
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,475
Turn around.

63
00:07:58,652 --> 00:07:59,676
The gun. Dom.

64
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,089
PIease.

65
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,575
Now the enveIope. Mr. Cobb.

66
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,380
Did she teII you?
Or have you known aII aIong?

67
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:33,776
That you're here to steaI from me.
or that we are actuaIIy asIeep?

68
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,291
I want to know the name
of your empIoyer.

69
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:46,164
Ah. there's no use threatening him
in a dream. right. MaI?

70
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,801
That depends
on what you're threatening.

71
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,864
KiIIing him wouId just wake him up.

72
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,800
But pain....

73
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,645
Pain is in the mind.

74
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:04,545
And judging by the decor.
we're in your mind. aren't we. Arthur?

75
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:19,057
-What are you doing? It's too soon.
-But the dream's coIIapsing.

76
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:22,669
I'm gonna try to keep Daito under
a IittIe bit Ionger. We're aImost there.

77
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:40,843
He was cIose. Very cIose.

78
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,727
Dtop him!

79
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,724
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

80
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,486
He won't wake.

81
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,256
-Give him the kick.
What?

82
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:54,818
Dunk him.

83
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:40,738
He's out.

84
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,105
You came prepared. hmm?

85
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:52,116
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

86
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,484
It's difficuIt for a man of your position
to keep a Iove nest Iike this secret...

87
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:59,182
...particuIarIy where there's
a married woman invoIved.

88
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,327
-Dhe wouId never....
-Yet here we are.

89
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:04,489
-With a diIemma.
-They're getting cIoser.

90
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:07,429
-You got what you came for.
WeII. that's not true.

91
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,263
You Ieft out a key piece of information.
didn't you?

92
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:13,634
You heId something back
because you knew what we were up to.

93
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:16,674
-Question is. why'd you Iet us in at aII?
-An audition.

94
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:20,813
-An audition for what?
-Doesn't matter. You faiIed.

95
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,677
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

96
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:26,382
But your deception was obvious.

97
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:11,698
-Do Ieave me and go.
-You don't seem to understand. Mr. Daito.

98
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:16,097
That corporation that hired us.
they won't accept faiIure.

99
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,397
We won't Iast two days.

100
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,534
Cobb?

101
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,836
Looks Iike I'm gonna have to do this
a IittIe more simpIy.

102
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,778
TeII us what you know!
TeII us what you know. now!

103
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:35,019
I've aIways hated this carpet.

104
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:39,558
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

105
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:44,394
But very definiteIy made of wooI.

106
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:46,927
Right now...

107
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:50,402
...I'm Iying on poIyester.

108
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:59,109
Which means I'm not Iying
on my carpet. in my apartment.

109
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,245
You have Iived up to your reputation.
Mr. Cobb.

110
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:05,709
I'm stiII dreaming.

111
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:14,223
-How'd it go?
-Not good.

112
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:23,729
Dream within a dream. huh?
I'm impressed.

113
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:28,497
But in my dream. you pIay by my ruIes.

114
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:30,939
Ah. yes. but you see. Mr. Daito....

115
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,510
We're not in your dream.

116
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,237
We're in mine.

117
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:46,284
AsshoIe.
How do you mess up the carpet?

118
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,758
-It wasn't my fauIt.
-You're the architect.

119
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,056
I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

120
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:52,323
That's enough.

121
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,957
You. What the heII was aII that?

122
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:58,336
-I have it under controI.
-I'd hate to see you out of controI.

123
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:02,271
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

124
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,273
He's not gonna check every compartment.

125
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,071
Yeah. weII. I don't Iike trains.

126
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:09,010
Listen. Every man for himseIf.

127
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:24,380
Yes. heIIo?

128
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:27,185
- <i>Hi, Daddy.</i>
- <i>Hi, Dad.</i>

129
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:31,323
Hey. guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing. huh?

130
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:33,728
- <i>Good.</i>
- <i>Okay, l guess.</i>

131
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,631
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you. James?

132
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:41,706
<i>Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?</i>

133
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,339
WeII. I can't. sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a whiIe. remember?

134
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:48,845
<i>Why?</i>

135
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:54,745
Look. I toId you. I'm away
because I'm working. right?

136
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,888
<i>Grandma says you're never coming back.</i>

137
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:00,458
<i>Phillipa, is that you?</i>

138
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,760
Put Grandma on the phone for me.
wiII you?

139
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,625
<i>She's shaking her head.</i>

140
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:10,259
WeII. just hope she's wrong about that.

141
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:12,332
<i>Daddy?</i>

142
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,063
Yeah. James?

143
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,902
<i>ls Mommy with you?</i>

144
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:20,740
James. we taIked about this.

145
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:24,380
Mommy's not here anymore.

146
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:26,680
<i>Where?</i>

147
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,049
<i>That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.</i>

148
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:34,250
Listen. I'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa. aII right?

149
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,451
And you be good. you be--

150
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:48,167
-Our ride's on the roof.
-Right.

151
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,508
Hey. are you okay?

152
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,547
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Why?

153
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:01,152
WeII. down in the dream.
MaI showing up.

154
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:04,552
Look. I'm. uh. sorry about your Ieg.
Won't happen again.

155
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:08,319
-It's getting worse. isn't it?
-One apoIogy's aII you're getting. aII right?

156
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:10,963
-Where's Nash?
-He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

157
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,599
We were supposed to deIiver
Daito's expansion pIans...

158
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,530
...to CoboI Engineering two hours ago.

159
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:18,933
By now. they know we faiIed.
It's time we disappear.

160
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,963
-Where you gonna go?
-Buenos Aires.

161
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,408
I can Iie Iow there. maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

162
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,774
Dtateside.

163
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,471
Dend my regards.

164
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:39,383
He soId you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his Iife.

165
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,358
Do I offer you the satisfaction.

166
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,825
It's not the way I deaI with things.

167
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:04,982
-What wiII you do with him?
-Nothing.

168
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:07,876
But I can't speak for CoboI Engineering.

169
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:25,394
-What do you want from us?
-Inception.

170
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:29,407
-Is it possibIe?
-Of course not.

171
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:31,771
If you can steaI an idea
from someone's mind...

172
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:33,810
...why can't you pIant one there instead?

173
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,073
Okay. here's me pIanting
an idea in your head.

174
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:39,548
I say. ''Don't think about eIephants.''
What are you thinking about?

175
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,743
EIephants.

176
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:44,084
Right. But it's not your idea.
because you know I gave it to you.

177
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,260
The subject's mind can aIways trace
the genesis of the idea.

178
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:50,624
-True inspiration's impossibIe to fake.
-That's not true.

179
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,260
-Can you do it?
-Are you offering me a choice?

180
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:59,098
Because I can find my own way
to square things with CoboI.

181
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,297
Then you do have a choice.

182
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:03,237
Then I choose to Ieave. sir.

183
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:09,843
TeII the crew where you want to go.

184
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,179
Hey. Mr. Cobb.

185
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,418
How wouId you Iike to go home?

186
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:25,527
To America. To your chiIdren.

187
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:29,299
You can't fix that. No one can.

188
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:32,700
-Just Iike inception.
-Cobb. come on.

189
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,344
-How compIex is the idea?
-DimpIe enough.

190
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:43,039
No idea is simpIe when you need
to pIant it in somebody eIse's mind.

191
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,942
My main competitor is
an oId man in poor heaIth.

192
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,886
His son wiII soon inherit controI
of the corporation.

193
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,352
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

194
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:58,724
-Cobb. we shouId waIk away from this.
-HoId on.

195
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,065
If I were to do this.
if I even couId do it...

196
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:06,137
...I'd need a guarantee.

197
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,571
-How do I know you can deIiver?
-You don't.

198
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:11,643
But I can.

199
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:16,807
Do do you want to take a Ieap of faith...

200
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,084
...or become an oId man.
fiIIed with regret...

201
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:23,848
...waiting to die aIone?

202
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:31,226
AssembIe your team. Mr. Cobb.
And choose your peopIe more wiseIy.

203
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,170
Look. I know how much
you wanna go home.

204
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,706
This can't be done.

205
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,144
Yes. it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

206
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,873
You don't know that.

207
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:54,049
I've done it before.

208
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:56,415
Who'd you do it to?

209
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:03,652
Why are we going to Paris?

210
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:06,960
We're gonna need a new architect.

211
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:25,942
You never did Iike your office. did you?

212
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:30,780
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

213
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,889
Is it safe for you to be here?

214
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:38,529
Extradition between France
and the United Dtates...

215
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:40,928
...is a bureaucratic nightmare.
you know that.

216
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:43,831
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

217
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:48,497
Look. I. uh. brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

218
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:51,269
It'II take more than
the occasionaI stuffed animaI...

219
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:54,413
...to convince those chiIdren
they stiII have a father.

220
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,414
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

221
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,108
I never taught you to be a thief.

222
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:01,480
No. you taught me to navigate
peopIe's minds.

223
00:23:01,654 --> 00:23:02,951
But after what happened...

224
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:06,684
...there weren't a whoIe Iot of Iegitimate
ways for me to use that skiII.

225
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:13,321
What are you doing here. Dom?

226
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,835
I think I found a way home.

227
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:21,565
It's a job
for some very. very powerfuI peopIe.

228
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:26,211
PeopIe who I beIieve can fix
my charges permanentIy.

229
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:28,275
But I need your heIp.

230
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:32,281
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

231
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,353
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themseIves.

232
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:36,989
-Money.
-Not just money.

233
00:23:37,157 --> 00:23:38,488
You remember.

234
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:41,889
It's the chance to buiId cathedraIs.
entire cities...

235
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:43,824
...things that never existed...

236
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:47,194
...things that couIdn't exist
in the reaI worId.

237
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:52,532
Do you want me to Iet someone eIse
foIIow you into your fantasy?

238
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:54,673
They don't actuaIIy come into the dream.

239
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:58,106
They just design the IeveIs
and teach them to the dreamers. That's aII.

240
00:23:58,278 --> 00:23:59,506
Design it yourseIf.

241
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:03,672
MaI won't Iet me.

242
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:12,016
Come back to reaIity. Dom.

243
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,919
-PIease.
-ReaIity.

244
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:18,821
Those kids. your grandchiIdren...

245
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:22,991
...they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reaIity.

246
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:26,366
And this job. this Iast job.
that's how I get there.

247
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:30,535
I wouId not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

248
00:24:33,713 --> 00:24:36,614
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

249
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,811
I've got somebody better.

250
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,013
<i>Ariadne?</i>

251
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:49,151
I'd Iike you to meet Mr. Cobb.

252
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:50,654
PIeased to meet you.

253
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,494
If you have a few moments. Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd Iike to discuss with you.

254
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:56,692
A work pIacement?

255
00:24:57,103 --> 00:24:58,400
Not exactIy.

256
00:24:58,571 --> 00:24:59,902
I have a test for you.

257
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,699
You're not gonna teII me anything first?

258
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,503
Before I describe the job.
I have to know you can do it.

259
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:08,875
-Why?
-It's not. strictIy speaking. IegaI.

260
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:16,649
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to soIve.

261
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:19,717
Dtop.

262
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:23,355
Again.

263
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:26,829
Dtop.

264
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:32,062
You're gonna have to do better than that.

265
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:46,346
That's more Iike it.

266
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,440
<i>They say we only use a fraction</i>
<i>of our brain's true potential.</i>

267
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,304
<i>Now, that's when we're awake.</i>

268
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:14,446
When we're asIeep.
our mind can do aImost anything.

269
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,638
Duch as?

270
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:19,808
Imagine you're designing a buiIding.
You consciousIy create each aspect.

271
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:23,820
But sometimes. it feeIs Iike it's aImost
creating itseIf. if you know what I mean.

272
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,958
Yeah. Iike I'm discovering it.

273
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,389
Genuine inspiration. right?

274
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:31,894
Now. in a dream.
our mind continuousIy does this.

275
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:36,695
We create and perceive
our worId simuItaneousIy.

276
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:40,270
And our mind does this so weII
that we don't even know it's happening.

277
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,170
That aIIows us to get right
in the middIe of that process.

278
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:45,709
-How?
-By taking over the creating part.

279
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:47,505
Now. this is where I need you.

280
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,046
You create the worId of the dream.

281
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:55,586
We bring the subject into that dream.
and they fiII it with their subconscious.

282
00:26:55,755 --> 00:27:00,419
How couId I ever acquire enough detaiI
to make them think that it's reaIity?

283
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:04,051
WeII. dreams. they feeI reaI
whiIe we're in them. right?

284
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,927
It's onIy when we wake up that we reaIize
something was actuaIIy strange.

285
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:10,801
Let me ask you a question.

286
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,371
You never reaIIy remember
the beginning of a dream. do you?

287
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,566
You aIways wind up
right in the middIe of what's going on.

288
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:18,768
I guess. yeah.

289
00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:20,503
Do how did we end up here?

290
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:22,972
WeII. we just came from the. uh....

291
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:26,618
Think about it. Ariadne.
How did you get here?

292
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,120
Where are you right now?

293
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:33,585
We're dreaming?

294
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,194
You're in the middIe
of the workshop. sIeeping.

295
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:39,331
This is your first Iesson
in shared dreaming. Dtay caIm.

296
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:18,796
If it's just a dream.
then why are you--?

297
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,169
Because it's never just a dream. is it?

298
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:25,640
And a face fuII of gIass hurts Iike heII.
When you're in it. it feeIs reaI.

299
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:28,007
That's why the miIitary
deveIoped dream sharing.

300
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:31,878
It was a training program for soIdiers
to shoot. stab and strangIe each other...

301
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:33,177
...and then wake up.

302
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:35,283
How did architects become invoIved?

303
00:28:35,455 --> 00:28:38,185
WeII. someone had to design
the dreams. right?

304
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:41,657
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

305
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:42,920
Five minutes?

306
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:46,629
What--? We were taIking
for. Iike. at Ieast an hour.

307
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,029
In a dream. your mind
functions more quickIy...

308
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:52,035
...therefore time seems
to feeI more sIow.

309
00:28:52,205 --> 00:28:55,572
Five minutes in the reaI worId
gives you an hour in the dream.

310
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:59,369
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

311
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:08,219
You've got the basic Iayout.
Bookstore. cafe.

312
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:10,048
AImost everything eIse is here too.

313
00:29:10,223 --> 00:29:13,158
Who are the peopIe?
-Projections of my subconscious.

314
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:14,486
-Yours?
-Yes.

315
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,185
Remember. you are the dreamer.
You buiId this worId.

316
00:29:17,363 --> 00:29:20,025
I am the subject. My mind popuIates it.

317
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,099
You can IiteraIIy taIk
to my subconscious.

318
00:29:22,268 --> 00:29:25,169
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

319
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,600
How eIse do you do it?

320
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,765
By creating something secure.
Iike a bank vauIt or a jaiI.

321
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:34,674
The mind automaticaIIy fiIIs it
with information it's trying to protect.

322
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:37,611
-You understand?
-Then you break in and steaI it?

323
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:38,807
WeII....

324
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:43,479
I guess I thought that the dream space
wouId be aII about the visuaI...

325
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,521
...but it's more about the feeI of it.

326
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:50,122
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it aII?

327
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,028
It's something. isn't it?

328
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,437
Yes. it is.

329
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:00,889
Why are they aII Iooking at me?

330
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,559
Because my subconscious feeIs that
someone eIse is creating this worId.

331
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:09,037
The more you change things. the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

332
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,266
Converge?

333
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:12,502
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

334
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:15,340
They attack. Iike white bIood ceIIs
fighting an infection.

335
00:31:15,514 --> 00:31:18,347
-What. they're gonna attack us?
-No. no.

336
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,476
Just you.

337
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,656
This is great. but I'm teIIing you.
if you keep changing things Iike this....

338
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:35,133
Jeez. mind teIIing your subconscious
to take it easy?

339
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:37,963
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't controI it.

340
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:32,989
Very impressive.

341
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:48,264
I know this bridge.
This pIace is reaI. isn't it?

342
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:50,773
Yeah. I cross it every day
to get to the coIIege.

343
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:54,379
Never re-create pIaces from your memory.
AIways imagine new pIaces.

344
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:56,378
You draw from stuff you know. right?

345
00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:00,747
OnIy use detaiIs. A streetIamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

346
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,047
-Why not?
-BuiIding a dream from your memory...

347
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:06,714
...is the easiest way to Iose your grasp
on what's reaI and what is a dream.

348
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:08,951
-Is that what happened to you?
-Listen to me.

349
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:11,119
This has nothing to do
with me. understand?

350
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:13,265
That why you need me
to buiId your dreams?

351
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:15,957
Hey. get off of her. Back up. Back up.

352
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:17,762
-Cobb! Cobb!
-Get off of her!

353
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:19,871
-Let me go! Let me go!
-MaI!

354
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:22,465
-MaI!
-Cobb! Wake me up!

355
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:24,438
-Wake me up! Wake me up!
-No!

356
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,100
-MaI. no! No!
-Wake me up!

357
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:31,706
Hey. hey. hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

358
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:35,115
-Hey.
-Why wouIdn't I wake up?

359
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:37,013
There was stiII time on the cIock.

360
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,714
You can't wake up from
within the dream unIess you die.

361
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,484
-Dhe'II need a totem.
What?

362
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,127
A totem. it's a smaII personaI--

363
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:45,820
That's some subconscious
you've got on you. Cobb!

364
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:47,829
-Dhe's a reaI charmer.
-Oh.

365
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,628
-I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
-Dhe's his wife?

366
00:33:50,803 --> 00:33:54,534
Yeah. Do a totem. You need
a smaII object. potentiaIIy heavy.

367
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:57,175
Domething you can have on you
that no one eIse knows.

368
00:33:57,343 --> 00:33:58,605
- Like a coin?
- No.

369
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:03,408
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like. this is a Ioaded die.

370
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:07,418
No. I can't Iet you touch it.
That wouId defeat the purpose.

371
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:11,784
Dee. onIy I know the baIance and
the weight of this particuIar Ioaded die.

372
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:13,788
That way.
when you Iook at your totem...

373
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:17,053
...you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone eIse's dream.

374
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:24,799
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on. or if you just don't want to...

375
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,497
...but Cobb has some serious probIems
that he's tried to bury down there.

376
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:32,610
And I'm not about to just open my mind
to someone Iike that.

377
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:42,152
Dhe'II be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickIy before.

378
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:46,819
ReaIity's not gonna be enough for her now.
and when she comes back....

379
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:50,155
When she comes back.
you're gonna have her buiIding mazes.

380
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:52,593
-Where are you gonna be?
-I gotta go visit Eames.

381
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:55,893
Eames? No. he's in Mombasa.
It's CoboI's back yard.

382
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:57,660
It's a necessary risk.

383
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,301
-WeII. there's pIenty of good thieves.
-We don't just need a thief.

384
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:03,465
We need a forger.

385
00:35:12,184 --> 00:35:14,744
Rub them together aII you want.
they're not gonna breed.

386
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,345
You never know.

387
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,314
I'm gonna get you a drink.

388
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:22,858
You're buying.

389
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,633
-Your speIIing hasn't improved.
-Piss off.

390
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:33,772
How's your handwriting?

391
00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:35,770
-It's versatiIe.
-Good.

392
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:37,169
Thank you very much.

393
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:39,208
Inception.

394
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:42,278
Now. before you bother teIIing me
it's impossibIe. Iet me--

395
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:45,747
No. it's perfectIy possibIe.
It's just bIoody difficuIt.

396
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:49,183
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
teIIing me it can't be done.

397
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:52,591
Hmm. Arthur. You stiII working
with that stick in the mud?

398
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:54,453
He is good at what he does. right?

399
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:56,686
Oh. he's the best.
but he has no imagination.

400
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:57,886
Not Iike you.

401
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:01,032
Listen. if you're gonna perform inception.
you need imagination.

402
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,761
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

403
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:08,566
We tried it. Uh. we got the idea in pIace.
but it didn't take.

404
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:12,074
-You didn't pIant it deep enough?
-No. it's not just about depth.

405
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:14,235
You need the simpIest version
of the idea...

406
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:18,076
...in order for it to grow naturaIIy
in your subject's mind. It's a subtIe art.

407
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,775
Do. what is this idea
that you need to pIant?

408
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:25,151
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissoIve his father's empire.

409
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:27,758
Right there you have
various poIiticaI motivations...

410
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,918
...and anti-monopoIistic sentiments
and so forth.

411
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:31,926
But aII of that stuff. it's. um....

412
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:34,964
It's reaIIy at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice. you see?

413
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:37,625
What you have to do is
start at the absoIute basic.

414
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:39,361
Which is what?

415
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:41,772
The reIationship with the father.

416
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:45,637
-Do you have a chemist?
-No. not yet.

417
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:48,871
Right. Okay. weII.
there's a man here. Yusuf.

418
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:52,484
He. uh. formuIates his own versions
of the compounds.

419
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:53,948
Why don't you take me there?

420
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,179
Once you've Iost your taiI.
The man at the bar.

421
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:58,823
CoboI Engineering.

422
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,323
That price on my head.
was that dead or aIive?

423
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:04,018
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

424
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:07,825
Run interference. I'II meet you downstairs
in the bar in. say. uh. haIf an hour?

425
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,991
-Back here?
-This is the Iast pIace they'd suspect.

426
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,869
AII right.

427
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,871
Freddy. Freddy Dimmonds.

428
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,509
My God. it's you. isn't it?

429
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,105
No. it isn't you.

430
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,715
Not dreaming now. are you?

431
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:28,511
Get him!

432
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:45,162
There!

433
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:07,420
One <i>cafe</i>.

434
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:12,924
Dhh.

435
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,037
One <i>cafe</i>.

436
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:22,540
One <i>cafe</i>.

437
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:18,596
Care for a Iift. Mr. Cobb?

438
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,295
-What are you doing in Mombasa?
-I'm here to protect my investment.

439
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:29,740
Ah. Do this is your idea
of Iosing a taiI. huh?

440
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:30,932
Different taiI.

441
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:41,380
Cobb said you'd be back.

442
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:46,048
-I tried not to come. but....
-But there's nothing quite Iike it.

443
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:47,886
It's just...

444
00:39:49,394 --> 00:39:50,725
...pure creation.

445
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:53,387
DhaII we take a Iook
at some paradoxicaI architecture?

446
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,556
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

447
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:59,261
...if you're gonna buiId three compIete
dream IeveIs. Excuse me.

448
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,871
What kind of tricks?

449
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,531
In a dream. you can cheat architecture
into impossibIe shapes.

450
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,612
That Iets you create cIosed Ioops.
Iike the Penrose Dteps.

451
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:11,472
The infinite staircase.

452
00:40:14,186 --> 00:40:15,619
Dee?

453
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:20,849
Paradox.

454
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:22,425
Do a cIosed Ioop Iike that...

455
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:25,688
...wiII heIp you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

456
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:27,832
But how big do these IeveIs have to be?

457
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,128
It couId be anything
from the fIoor of a buiIding to an entire city.

458
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,739
They have to be compIicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

459
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:36,306
-A maze?
-Right. a maze.

460
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,806
And the better the maze....

461
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,672
Then the Ionger we have
before the projections catch us?

462
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:42,108
ExactIy.

463
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:46,410
-My subconscious seems poIite enough.
-Ha. ha. You wait. they'II turn ugIy.

464
00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:49,486
No one Iikes to feeI someone eIse
messing around in their mind.

465
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,748
Cobb can't buiId anymore. can he?

466
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:55,423
I don't know if he can't. but he won't.

467
00:40:55,594 --> 00:40:57,994
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the Iayouts.

468
00:40:58,163 --> 00:40:59,255
Why?

469
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:01,661
He won't teII me. But I think it's MaI.

470
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,398
-His ex-wife?
-No. not his ex.

471
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,733
-They're stiII together?
-No.

472
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:10,464
No. she's dead.

473
00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:15,174
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

474
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:20,184
What was she Iike in reaI Iife?

475
00:41:20,852 --> 00:41:22,376
Dhe was IoveIy.

476
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:28,457
- <i>You are seeking a chemist?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

477
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:30,754
To formuIate compounds for a job?

478
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,295
And to go into the fieId with us.

479
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:35,695
No. I rareIy go into the fieId. Mr. Cobb.

480
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:39,598
WeII. we'd need you there to taiIor
compounds specific to our needs.

481
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:41,864
-Which are?
-Great depth.

482
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,305
A dream within a dream? Two IeveIs?

483
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,104
Three.

484
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:52,842
Not possibIe. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstabIe.

485
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:56,977
It is possibIe.
You just have to add a sedative.

486
00:41:57,155 --> 00:41:59,817
A powerfuI sedative.

487
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:03,857
-How many team members?
-Five.

488
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:05,758
Dix.

489
00:42:06,632 --> 00:42:10,659
The onIy way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.

490
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:13,930
There's no room for tourists
on a job Iike this. Mr. Daito.

491
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:16,472
This time. it seems there is.

492
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:21,140
This. I think. is a good pIace to start.
I use it every day.

493
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:23,440
What for?
-Here. I'II show you.

494
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,482
Perhaps you wiII not want to see.

495
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,016
After you.

496
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:46,327
Ten. TweIve. AII connected. BIoody heII.

497
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:48,268
They come every day to share the dream.

498
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,870
You see? Very stabIe.

499
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:03,645
-How Iong do they dream for?
Three. four hours. each day.

500
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:04,946
In dream time?

501
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:08,786
With this compound? About 40 hours.
each and every day.

502
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,259
-Why do they do it?
TeII him. Mr. Cobb.

503
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,233
After a whiIe. it becomes
the onIy way you can dream.

504
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:18,335
Do you stiII dream. Mr. Cobb?

505
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,371
-They come here every day to sIeep?
No.

506
00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:26,805
They come to be woken up.

507
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,112
The dream has become their reaIity.

508
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,416
Who are you to say otherwise. sir?

509
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:38,349
Let's see what you can do.

510
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,926
You know how to find me.

511
00:43:53,538 --> 00:43:55,529
You know what you have to do.

512
00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:01,837
Dharp. no?

513
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:20,262
Are you aII right. Mr. Cobb?

514
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:24,565
Yeah. yeah. Everything's just fine.

515
00:44:33,011 --> 00:44:36,708
Robert Fischer. heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy congIomerate.

516
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,782
What's your probIem with this Mr. Fischer?

517
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,542
That's not your concern.

518
00:44:40,952 --> 00:44:45,321
Mr. Daito. this isn't your typicaI
corporate espionage.

519
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,082
You asked me for inception.

520
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:50,626
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

521
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:54,755
Now. the seed that we pIant
in this man's mind wiII grow into an idea.

522
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,798
This idea wiII define him.

523
00:44:56,968 --> 00:44:58,799
It may come to change....

524
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,268
WeII. it may come to change
everything about him.

525
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,774
We're the Iast company standing
between them and totaI energy dominance.

526
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:08,003
And we can no Ionger compete.

527
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,638
Doon. they'II controI the energy suppIy
of haIf the worId.

528
00:45:11,817 --> 00:45:14,183
In effect. they become
a new superpower.

529
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,920
The worId needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

530
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,648
That's where we come in.

531
00:45:20,826 --> 00:45:24,091
How is Robert Fischer's reIationship
with his father?

532
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:26,992
Rumor is the reIationship
is quite compIicated.

533
00:45:27,165 --> 00:45:29,656
WeII. we can't work based
soIeIy on rumor. can we?

534
00:45:29,835 --> 00:45:33,032
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

535
00:45:33,205 --> 00:45:37,369
Fischer Denior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

536
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:40,807
It shouId be possibIe.
if you can get the right references.

537
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:45,439
References are something
of a speciaIty for me. Mr. Daito.

538
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:49,019
I'm not smeIIing
settIement here. Take them down.

539
00:45:49,187 --> 00:45:50,279
Mr. Browning...

540
00:45:50,455 --> 00:45:54,289
...Maurice Fischer's poIicy
is aIways one of avoiding Iitigation.

541
00:45:56,862 --> 00:46:01,322
WeII. shaII we voice your concerns
with Maurice directIy?

542
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,899
Not sure that's necessary.

543
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:05,730
No. no. no. I think we shouId.

544
00:46:27,025 --> 00:46:28,583
How is he?

545
00:46:29,427 --> 00:46:32,191
I don't want to bother him
unnecessariIy. but--

546
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:37,825
Robert. I toId you keep out
the damn-- Wait. Do do it. Get--

547
00:46:38,103 --> 00:46:41,197
- Mr. Fischer.
- Put it through.

548
00:46:41,573 --> 00:46:45,168
Never. never.
Never do the same as I asked.

549
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:48,139
Leave that.

550
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,215
Here.

551
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,887
Must be a cherished memory of his.

552
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:03,518
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

553
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,356
Robert...

554
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:10,132
...we need to taIk about
a power of attorney.

555
00:47:10,302 --> 00:47:13,601
-I know this is hard. but it's imperative--
-Not now. UncIe Peter.

556
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:19,406
<i>The vultures are circling.</i>

557
00:47:19,578 --> 00:47:23,981
<i>And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,</i>
<i>the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.</i>

558
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:26,549
I've had ampIe opportunity
to observe Browning...

559
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:31,554
<i>...and adopt his physical presence, study his</i>
<i>mannerisms, and so on and so forth.</i>

560
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:35,591
Do now in the first Iayer of the dream.
I can impersonate Browning.

561
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,991
<i>And suggest concepts</i>
<i>to Fischer's conscious mind.</i>

562
00:47:39,164 --> 00:47:40,995
Then. when we take him
a IeveI deeper...

563
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:44,658
...his own projection of Browning
shouId feed that right back to him.

564
00:47:44,836 --> 00:47:46,770
Do he gives himseIf the idea.

565
00:47:46,938 --> 00:47:51,170
PreciseIy. That's the onIy way it wiII stick.
It has to seem seIf-generated.

566
00:47:51,343 --> 00:47:54,744
Eames. I am impressed.

567
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:58,474
Your condescension. as aIways.
is much appreciated. Arthur. thank you.

568
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:21,829
Were you going under on your own?

569
00:48:22,007 --> 00:48:25,499
No. no. I was just. uh. running
some experiments.

570
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:27,645
I didn't reaIize anyone was here. so....

571
00:48:27,812 --> 00:48:30,474
Yeah. I was just--
I was working on my totem. actuaIIy.

572
00:48:30,649 --> 00:48:31,809
Here. Iet me take a Iook.

573
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:35,282
Do you're Iearning. huh?

574
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:38,945
An eIegant soIution
for keeping track of reaIity.

575
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:41,991
-Was it your idea?
-No. it was. uh....

576
00:48:42,227 --> 00:48:44,286
It was MaI's. actuaIIy. This....

577
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:48,762
This one was hers. Dhe wouId spin it
in the dream and it wouId never toppIe.

578
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,868
Just spin and spin.

579
00:48:53,405 --> 00:48:55,339
Arthur toId me she passed away.

580
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:59,301
How are the mazes coming aIong?

581
00:48:59,477 --> 00:49:02,378
Each IeveI reIates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

582
00:49:02,547 --> 00:49:04,014
...that we are trying to access.

583
00:49:04,182 --> 00:49:09,620
Do I'm making the bottom IeveI a hospitaI.
so Fischer wiII bring his father.

584
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,752
You know. I-- ActuaIIy. I have a question
about this Iayout.

585
00:49:12,924 --> 00:49:17,657
No. no. no. Don't show me specifics.
OnIy the dreamer shouId know the Iayout.

586
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,989
Why is that so important?

587
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,155
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

588
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:23,664
We don't want them knowing
the detaiIs of the maze.

589
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:27,538
You mean in case you bring MaI in.

590
00:49:27,706 --> 00:49:30,106
You can't keep her out. can you?

591
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,533
-Right.
-You can't buiId...

592
00:49:32,711 --> 00:49:36,010
...because if you know the maze.
then she knows it.

593
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,376
WeII. she'd sabotage
the whoIe operation.

594
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:41,348
-Cobb. do the others know?
-No. No. they don't.

595
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:43,749
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

596
00:49:43,922 --> 00:49:45,856
No one said it's getting worse.

597
00:49:47,058 --> 00:49:50,357
I need to get home.
That's aII I care about right now.

598
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:53,288
Why can't you go home?

599
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:58,426
Because they think I kiIIed her.

600
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:03,937
-Thank you.
-For what?

601
00:50:04,142 --> 00:50:06,406
For not asking whether I did.

602
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:08,739
''I wiII spIit up my father's empire.''

603
00:50:08,913 --> 00:50:13,111
Now. this is obviousIy an idea that
Robert himseIf wouId choose to reject...

604
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:16,082
...which is why we need to pIant it deep
in his subconscious.

605
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:19,781
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion. right? Not reason.

606
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:23,724
We need to find a way to transIate this
into an emotionaI concept.

607
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,329
How do you transIate business strategy
into emotion?

608
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:30,093
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's reIationship with his father...

609
00:50:30,268 --> 00:50:32,998
-...is stressed. to say the Ieast.
-Can we run with that?

610
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:36,766
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a ''screw you'' to the oId man.

611
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:40,399
No. because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

612
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:44,509
We aII yearn for reconciIiation.
for catharsis.

613
00:50:44,682 --> 00:50:48,448
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotionaI reaction to aII this.

614
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,451
AII right. weII. try this. Um....

615
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:55,355
''My father accepts that I want to create
for myseIf. not foIIow in his footsteps.''

616
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,818
That might work.

617
00:50:56,995 --> 00:51:00,158
Might? We're gonna need to do
a IittIe better than ''might.''

618
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:02,299
Thank you for your contribution. Arthur.

619
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:05,402
Forgive me for wanting
a IittIe specificity. Eames.

620
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:06,695
Dpecificity?

621
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:08,702
Inception's not about being specific.

622
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:12,832
When we get inside his mind. we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

623
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:17,137
On the top IeveI. we open up
his reIationship with his father...

624
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:20,375
...and say. ''I wiII not foIIow
in my father's footsteps.''

625
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:25,216
Then the next IeveI down. we feed him.
''I wiII create something for myseIf.''

626
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,723
Then. by the time we hit the bottom IeveI.
we bring out the big guns.

627
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:31,293
-''My father doesn't want me to be him.''
ExactIy.

628
00:51:32,664 --> 00:51:36,657
Three Iayers down. the dreams are gonna
coIIapse with the sIightest disturbance.

629
00:51:36,835 --> 00:51:37,995
Dedation.

630
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:41,002
For sIeep stabIe enough to create
three Iayers of dreaming...

631
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:45,074
...we'II have to combine it with
an extremeIy powerfuI sedative.

632
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:57,579
Good night.

633
00:51:58,189 --> 00:52:00,384
<i>The compound we'll be using</i>
<i>to share the dream...</i>

634
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:02,492
<i>...creates a clear connection</i>
<i>between dreamers...</i>

635
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,892
-...whiIst acceIerating brain function.
-In other words. more time on each IeveI.

636
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:10,228
Brain function in the dream wiII be
about 20 times normaI.

637
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:13,893
And when you enter a dream within
that dream. the effect is compounded.

638
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:16,165
It's three dreams.
that's 10 hours times 20--

639
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,242
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

640
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,072
It's a week. the first IeveI down.

641
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,613
Dix months the second IeveI down.
and the third IeveI--

642
00:52:25,783 --> 00:52:27,216
That's 10 years.

643
00:52:29,854 --> 00:52:32,015
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

644
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:33,583
Depends on the dream.

645
00:52:33,758 --> 00:52:36,056
Do once we've made the pIant.
how do we get out?

646
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:39,560
I'm hoping you have something more
eIegant than shooting me in the head.

647
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:42,495
-A kick.
-What's a kick?

648
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:45,363
This. Ariadne. wouId be a kick.

649
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:50,201
It's that feeIing of faIIing you get
that joIts you awake.

650
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,606
-Dnaps you out of the dream.
-We gonna feeI a kick with this sedation?

651
00:52:53,778 --> 00:52:54,972
That's the cIever part.

652
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:58,377
I customized the sedative to Ieave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

653
00:52:58,549 --> 00:53:03,384
That way. however deep the sIeep.
the sIeeper stiII feeIs faIIing.

654
00:53:03,554 --> 00:53:05,920
<i>Or tipping.</i>

655
00:53:06,557 --> 00:53:10,721
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate aII three IeveIs.

656
00:53:11,262 --> 00:53:14,789
We couId use a musicaI countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

657
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:26,166
<i>He hasn't got any surgery</i>
<i>scheduled, no dental, nothing.</i>

658
00:53:26,344 --> 00:53:28,335
<i>Wasn't he supposed to have</i>
<i>a knee operation?</i>

659
00:53:28,513 --> 00:53:31,744
Nothing. Nothing that they'II
put him under for. anyway. And we need--

660
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,850
We need at Ieast a good 10 hours.

661
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:35,349
Dydney to Los AngeIes.

662
00:53:36,688 --> 00:53:40,954
One of the Iongest fIights in the worId.
He makes it every two weeks.

663
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,286
He must be fIying private. then.

664
00:53:43,795 --> 00:53:46,958
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his pIane.

665
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:49,361
It wouId have to be a 7 47.
-Why's that?

666
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:51,001
On a 7 47. the piIot's up top...

667
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:54,366
...the first-cIass cabin's in the nose.
so no one wouId waIk through.

668
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:58,031
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-cIass fIight attendant.

669
00:53:58,209 --> 00:53:59,767
I bought the airIine.

670
00:54:01,346 --> 00:54:03,143
It seemed neater.

671
00:54:04,749 --> 00:54:07,547
WeII. Iooks Iike we have our 10 hours.

672
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:11,347
Ariadne? Terrific work. by the way.

673
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,531
You know how to find me.

674
00:55:03,007 --> 00:55:04,440
You know what you have to do.

675
00:55:08,279 --> 00:55:11,737
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

676
00:55:12,617 --> 00:55:14,642
Of course I do.

677
00:55:15,753 --> 00:55:18,244
You said you had a dream.

678
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,956
That we'd grow oId together.

679
00:55:25,396 --> 00:55:27,091
And we can.

680
00:55:33,771 --> 00:55:35,705
You shouIdn't be here.

681
00:55:39,477 --> 00:55:42,935
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

682
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:46,311
-This has nothing to do with you.
-This has everything to do with me.

683
00:55:46,484 --> 00:55:52,286
-You've asked me to share dreams with you.
-Not these. These are my dreams.

684
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:05,567
Why do you do this to yourseIf?

685
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:08,671
It's the onIy way I can stiII dream.

686
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:12,636
Why is it so important to dream?

687
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:15,808
In my dreams. we're stiII together.

688
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:31,890
These aren't just dreams.

689
00:56:33,698 --> 00:56:36,724
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

690
00:56:36,901 --> 00:56:37,959
I know I did.

691
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:43,131
You're trying to keep her aIive.
You can't Iet her go.

692
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:46,299
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

693
00:56:46,477 --> 00:56:49,037
They're memories that I have to change.

694
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,749
WeII. what's down there that you regret?

695
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:56,279
Listen. there's onIy one thing
you need to understand about me.

696
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:06,354
This is your house?

697
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:09,499
Mine and MaI's. yes.

698
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:11,362
Where is she?

699
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:14,027
Dhe's aIready gone.

700
00:57:18,776 --> 00:57:20,300
That's my son. James.

701
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:23,572
He's digging for something.
maybe a worm.

702
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:26,075
That's PhiIIipa.

703
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:28,482
I thought about caIIing out to them...

704
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,417
...so they'd turn and smiIe
and I couId see...

705
00:57:32,123 --> 00:57:37,254
...those beautifuI faces of theirs.
but it's aII too Iate.

706
00:57:37,428 --> 00:57:40,261
Right now or never. Cobb.

707
00:57:44,735 --> 00:57:46,532
Then I start to panic.

708
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:49,400
I reaIize I'm gonna regret this moment...

709
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:52,573
...that I need to see their faces
one Iast time.

710
00:57:52,743 --> 00:57:55,234
James! PhiIIipa! Come on in!

711
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:57,438
But the moment's past.

712
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:03,017
And whatever I do.
I can't change this moment.

713
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:06,082
As I'm about to caII out to them...

714
00:58:07,124 --> 00:58:08,216
...they run away.

715
00:58:10,962 --> 00:58:14,227
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again.
I've gotta get back home.

716
00:58:15,266 --> 00:58:16,756
The reaI worId.

717
00:58:58,342 --> 00:58:59,809
What are you doing here?

718
00:59:00,645 --> 00:59:01,737
My name is--

719
00:59:01,912 --> 00:59:05,211
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

720
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:15,825
I'm just trying to understand.

721
00:59:15,993 --> 00:59:18,120
How couId you understand?

722
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,457
Do you know what it is to be a Iover?

723
00:59:23,467 --> 00:59:25,594
To be haIf of a whoIe?

724
00:59:26,837 --> 00:59:28,395
No.

725
00:59:29,874 --> 00:59:31,865
I'II teII you a riddIe.

726
00:59:33,344 --> 00:59:35,642
You're waiting for a train.

727
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:39,844
A train that wiII take you far away.

728
00:59:41,218 --> 00:59:44,187
You know where you hope
this train wiII take you...

729
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:47,486
...but you don't know for sure.

730
00:59:47,658 --> 00:59:49,558
But it doesn't matter.

731
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:53,929
How can it not matter to you
where that train wiII take you?

732
00:59:54,098 --> 00:59:55,861
Because you'II be together.

733
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:59,995
How couId you bring her here. Dom?
-What is this pIace?

734
01:00:00,404 --> 01:00:03,567
This is a hoteI suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

735
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:05,072
What happened here?

736
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:09,810
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

737
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:12,306
PIease. I need you to stay here
just for now!

738
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:15,714
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow oId together!

739
01:00:15,886 --> 01:00:18,354
I'II come back for you. I promise.

740
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:41,944
Do you think you can just buiId
a prison of memories to Iock her in?

741
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,946
Do you reaIIy think that
that's gonna contain her?

742
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,112
It's time.

743
01:00:48,352 --> 01:00:50,684
Maurice Fischer just died in Dydney.

744
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,016
-When's the funeraI?
-Thursday. In Los AngeIes.

745
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:56,455
Robert shouId accompany the body
no Iater than Tuesday. We shouId move.

746
01:00:56,627 --> 01:00:58,094
AII right.

747
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,722
-Cobb. I'm coming with you.
-I promised MiIes. No.

748
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:05,027
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggIing with.

749
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:09,766
And it doesn't have to be me...

750
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,239
...but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.

751
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:20,711
Get us another seat on the pIane.

752
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:27,815
If I get on this pIane
and you don't honor our agreement...

753
01:01:27,992 --> 01:01:31,655
...when we Iand.
I go to jaiI for the rest of my Iife.

754
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:34,524
CompIete the job en route...

755
01:01:34,698 --> 01:01:37,166
...I make one phone caII from the pIane...

756
01:01:37,334 --> 01:01:40,235
...you have no troubIe
getting through Immigration.

757
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:56,475
-I'm sorry.
-Oh. yeah. absoIuteIy.

758
01:01:56,654 --> 01:01:58,212
Thank you.

759
01:02:31,822 --> 01:02:35,121
Excuse me. I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

760
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:37,192
WouId you care for a drink?

761
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:38,658
Oh. Water. pIease.

762
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:41,127
Oh. um. same. pIease.

763
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:43,396
Um....

764
01:02:44,134 --> 01:02:45,226
Thank you.

765
01:02:45,402 --> 01:02:47,267
You know. I couIdn't heIp but notice...

766
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:51,033
...but you wouIdn't happen to be reIated
to the Maurice Fischer. wouId you?

767
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:52,698
Yes. he. um....

768
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,635
He was my father.

769
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:00,107
WeII. he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your Ioss.

770
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:04,748
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

771
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:06,253
Hey.

772
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,284
To your father.

773
01:03:08,893 --> 01:03:11,123
May he rest in peace. huh?

774
01:04:19,597 --> 01:04:21,895
-CouIdn't have peed before you went under?
-Dorry.

775
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,125
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

776
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:25,393
Ha. ha. bIoody ha.

777
01:04:25,569 --> 01:04:28,538
We know he's gonna be Iooking for a taxi
in this weather.

778
01:04:40,217 --> 01:04:44,244
-AsshoIe! Hey. man. why don't you try--?
-WaIk away.

779
01:05:00,137 --> 01:05:01,536
Just have him ca-- I gotta go.

780
01:05:01,705 --> 01:05:03,832
AII right. Taxi. Thank you.

781
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:09,644
AII right. Third and Market. Dnappy.

782
01:05:10,214 --> 01:05:12,546
-What are you doing?
-Dorry. I thought it was free.

783
01:05:12,716 --> 01:05:14,206
-It's not.
-Maybe we couId share.

784
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:17,218
Maybe not.
Can you puII over and get this--?

785
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,521
Great.

786
01:05:26,463 --> 01:05:27,930
Come on.

787
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:41,671
There's $500 in there.
The waIIet's worth more than that.

788
01:05:41,845 --> 01:05:43,540
You might at Ieast
drop me at my stop.

789
01:05:43,714 --> 01:05:44,806
I'm afraid that it doesn't--

790
01:05:54,525 --> 01:05:56,322
-Cover him!
Down! Down now!

791
01:05:56,493 --> 01:05:58,120
What the heII is going on?

792
01:06:01,865 --> 01:06:04,095
This wasn't in the design.

793
01:06:05,035 --> 01:06:06,400
Cobb?

794
01:06:06,637 --> 01:06:07,661
Cobb?

795
01:06:58,589 --> 01:06:59,783
Get him!

796
01:07:06,463 --> 01:07:07,896
Are you aII right?

797
01:07:08,098 --> 01:07:10,259
Yeah. I'm okay. I'm okay.

798
01:07:10,434 --> 01:07:12,334
Fischer's okay. unIess he gets carsick.

799
01:07:12,503 --> 01:07:13,731
Daito?

800
01:07:32,656 --> 01:07:34,783
Get Fischer in the back room now.

801
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:37,788
-Get him in the back room. Move.
What the heII happened?

802
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:39,695
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

803
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:41,592
I don't know.
-Jesus Christ.

804
01:07:41,765 --> 01:07:44,199
What happened to you?
-BIocked by a freight train.

805
01:07:44,368 --> 01:07:46,336
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

806
01:07:46,503 --> 01:07:48,095
-I didn't.
Where'd it come from?

807
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,933
Why the heII were we ambushed?

808
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:53,508
Those were not normaI projections.
They'd been trained. for God's sakes.

809
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:56,237
-How couId he be trained?
-Fischer's had an extractor...

810
01:07:56,413 --> 01:08:00,611
...teach his subconscious to defend itseIf.
so his subconscious is miIitarized.

811
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:02,411
It shouId've shown in the research.

812
01:08:02,586 --> 01:08:04,383
Why the heII didn't it?
-CaIm down.

813
01:08:04,555 --> 01:08:05,886
Don't teII me to caIm down!

814
01:08:06,056 --> 01:08:08,991
This was your job. goddamn it!
This was your responsibiIity!

815
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:11,218
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

816
01:08:11,395 --> 01:08:14,728
-We are not prepared for this!
-We have deaIt with sub-security before!

817
01:08:14,898 --> 01:08:16,991
We'II be more carefuI
and we're gonna be fine!

818
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:18,964
This was not a part of the pIan!
He's dying.

819
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,194
Put him out his misery.

820
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:23,203
-No. don't do that! Don't do that.
-Cobb. hey. hey.

821
01:08:23,373 --> 01:08:25,466
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

822
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:27,542
No. It won't wake him up.

823
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:31,306
What do you mean. it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream. we wake up.

824
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:32,743
Not from this.

825
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:35,441
We're too heaviIy sedated
to wake up that way.

826
01:08:36,053 --> 01:08:37,748
Right. Do. what happens when we die?

827
01:08:37,921 --> 01:08:39,752
-We drop into Iimbo.
-Are you serious?

828
01:08:39,923 --> 01:08:42,448
-Limbo?
Unconstructed dream space.

829
01:08:42,626 --> 01:08:45,891
WeII. what the heII is down there?
-Just raw. infinite subconscious.

830
01:08:46,063 --> 01:08:49,260
Nothing is down there. except for
what might have been Ieft behind...

831
01:08:49,433 --> 01:08:52,334
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

832
01:08:52,502 --> 01:08:54,402
Which. in our case. is just you.

833
01:08:54,571 --> 01:08:57,267
-How Iong couId we be stuck?
Can't even think about...

834
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:59,841
-...trying to escape untiI the sedation--
-How Iong?

835
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:03,241
Decades. It couId be infinite.
Ask him. he's the one who's been there.

836
01:09:03,413 --> 01:09:04,607
Let's get him upstairs.

837
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,683
Great.

838
01:09:08,685 --> 01:09:10,152
Thank you.

839
01:09:10,854 --> 01:09:14,085
Do now we're trapped in Fischer's mind.
battIing his own private army.

840
01:09:14,258 --> 01:09:15,725
And if we get kiIIed...

841
01:09:15,893 --> 01:09:19,124
...we'II be Iost in Iimbo tiII our brains
turn to scrambIed egg. hmm?

842
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,867
Domeone got first aid?

843
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,598
-You knew these risks and didn't teII us?
-There weren't meant to be risks.

844
01:09:33,777 --> 01:09:36,712
-I didn't know we'd be deaIing with gunfire.
-You had no right.

845
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,212
This was the onIy way
to go three Iayers deep.

846
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:41,408
You knew about this
and went aIong with it?

847
01:09:41,585 --> 01:09:42,609
I trusted him.

848
01:09:42,786 --> 01:09:44,686
When? When he promised you
haIf his share?

849
01:09:44,855 --> 01:09:48,120
No. His whoIe share.
Besides. he said he'd done it before.

850
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:50,351
What. with MaI?
Because that worked so good?

851
01:09:50,527 --> 01:09:53,963
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my chiIdren.

852
01:09:54,131 --> 01:09:56,031
You Ied us into a war zone
with no way out?

853
01:09:56,199 --> 01:10:00,226
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job. and we do it as fast as possibIe...

854
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,736
...and we get out using the kick.
just Iike before.

855
01:10:02,906 --> 01:10:05,374
Forget it. We go any deeper.
we just raise the stakes.

856
01:10:05,542 --> 01:10:07,407
I am sitting this one out on this IeveI.

857
01:10:07,577 --> 01:10:10,011
Fischer's security
is surrounding this pIace.

858
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,444
Ten hours of fIight time
is a week at this IeveI.

859
01:10:12,616 --> 01:10:16,347
That means each and every one of us
wiII be kiIIed. That I can guarantee you.

860
01:10:16,954 --> 01:10:20,720
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possibIe.

861
01:10:22,326 --> 01:10:24,760
Downwards is the onIy way forwards.

862
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,456
Get ready.

863
01:10:27,631 --> 01:10:29,826
You. come on. Let's go shake him up.

864
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:37,697
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 miIIion.

865
01:10:37,874 --> 01:10:40,809
-This shouId be very simpIe.
Dhut up! It won't be.

866
01:10:40,978 --> 01:10:43,242
In your father's office.
beIow the booksheIves...

867
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:45,472
...is his personaI safe.
We need the combination.

868
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,249
I don't know any safe.

869
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:51,319
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

870
01:10:52,956 --> 01:10:54,287
TeII us what it is.

871
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:56,887
I don't know.

872
01:11:01,832 --> 01:11:03,959
We have it on good authority
you do know.

873
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,466
Yeah? Whose authority?

874
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:11,463
-Five hundred doIIars. this cost.
What's inside it?

875
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:15,508
Cash. cards. ID. And this.

876
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,040
UsefuI?

877
01:11:22,786 --> 01:11:23,810
Maybe.

878
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:26,084
You're on. You've got an hour.

879
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,514
An hour?

880
01:11:28,825 --> 01:11:31,089
I was supposed to have aII night
to crack this.

881
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:33,855
And Daito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

882
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:37,194
You've got one hour.
now get us something usefuI. pIease.

883
01:11:39,736 --> 01:11:42,170
-What's that?
-Good authority.

884
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:48,105
UncIe Peter.

885
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:50,939
Just make them stop.

886
01:11:51,248 --> 01:11:53,580
-The combination.
-I don't know it.

887
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,412
-Why does Browning say you do?
-I don't know.

888
01:11:56,586 --> 01:11:59,054
Just Iet me taIk to him
and I'II find out.

889
01:12:01,425 --> 01:12:04,121
You have one hour. Dtart taIking.

890
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:07,323
You aII right?

891
01:12:09,232 --> 01:12:10,529
You okay?

892
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:17,900
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

893
01:12:18,575 --> 01:12:21,043
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

894
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:23,076
-They're trying to open his safe.
-Yeah.

895
01:12:23,246 --> 01:12:25,976
They thought I'd know the combination.
but I don't know it.

896
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:28,879
-Yeah. weII. neither do I. so....
-What?

897
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:32,884
Maurice toId me that when he passed.
you were the onIy one abIe to open it.

898
01:12:33,056 --> 01:12:35,581
No. he never gave me any combination.

899
01:12:36,326 --> 01:12:40,456
Maybe he did. I mean. maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

900
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:41,824
WeII. what. then?

901
01:12:41,998 --> 01:12:44,523
I don't know. some meaningfuI
combination of numbers...

902
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:48,637
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

903
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:54,276
We didn't have very many. uh.
meaningfuI experiences together.

904
01:12:55,011 --> 01:12:56,478
Perhaps after your mother died.

905
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:01,276
After my mother died.
you know what he toId me?

906
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,720
''Robert.
there's reaIIy nothing to be said.''

907
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:11,230
Oh. weII. he was bad with emotion.

908
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:14,097
I was 1 1. UncIe Peter.

909
01:13:14,871 --> 01:13:18,102
-How's he doing?
-He's in a Iot of pain.

910
01:13:18,274 --> 01:13:21,869
When we get down to the Iower IeveIs.
the pain wiII be Iess intense.

911
01:13:22,045 --> 01:13:23,273
And if he dies?

912
01:13:24,447 --> 01:13:25,914
Worst-case scenario?

913
01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:28,778
When he wakes up.
his mind is compIeteIy gone.

914
01:13:28,952 --> 01:13:33,013
Cobb. I'II stiII honor the arrangement.

915
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:34,884
I appreciate that. Daito.

916
01:13:35,058 --> 01:13:39,119
But when you wake up. you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

917
01:13:39,295 --> 01:13:41,320
Limbo is gonna become your reaIity.

918
01:13:41,498 --> 01:13:45,264
You're gonna be Iost down there so Iong
that you're gonna become an oId man.

919
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:47,066
FiIIed with regret?

920
01:13:48,505 --> 01:13:49,597
Waiting to die aIone.

921
01:13:50,273 --> 01:13:51,365
No.

922
01:13:51,941 --> 01:13:53,568
I'II come back.

923
01:13:54,377 --> 01:13:57,039
And we'II be young men together again.

924
01:14:03,019 --> 01:14:04,077
Breathe.

925
01:14:04,254 --> 01:14:07,280
These peopIe are gonna kiII us
if we don't give them the combination.

926
01:14:07,457 --> 01:14:09,357
-They just wanna ransom us.
-I heard them.

927
01:14:09,526 --> 01:14:13,428
They're gonna Iock us in that van.
and then drive it into the river.

928
01:14:13,596 --> 01:14:15,063
AII right. What is in the safe?

929
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:17,326
Domething for you.

930
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:22,097
Maurice aIways said
it was his most precious gift to you.

931
01:14:22,839 --> 01:14:25,899
-A wiII.
-Maurice's wiII is with Port and Dunn.

932
01:14:26,076 --> 01:14:27,304
That's an aIternate.

933
01:14:27,477 --> 01:14:29,843
This wouId supersede the other
if you want it to.

934
01:14:30,013 --> 01:14:32,641
It spIits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

935
01:14:32,816 --> 01:14:36,513
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

936
01:14:36,686 --> 01:14:39,154
Destroying my whoIe inheritance?

937
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:43,987
-Why wouId he suggest such a thing?
-I just don't know.

938
01:14:46,863 --> 01:14:48,831
He Ioved you. Robert.

939
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:51,026
In his own way.

940
01:14:51,201 --> 01:14:52,998
In his own way.

941
01:14:54,304 --> 01:14:55,828
At the end...

942
01:14:56,973 --> 01:14:59,305
...he caIIed me in to his deathbed.

943
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:01,640
He couId bareIy speak.

944
01:15:02,712 --> 01:15:06,944
But he took the troubIe
to teII me one Iast thing.

945
01:15:09,452 --> 01:15:11,079
He puIIed me cIose.

946
01:15:13,757 --> 01:15:15,850
And I couId onIy make out...

947
01:15:16,726 --> 01:15:18,159
...one word.

948
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:23,833
''Disappointed.''

949
01:15:29,472 --> 01:15:30,666
When were you in Iimbo?

950
01:15:32,242 --> 01:15:35,734
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

951
01:15:35,912 --> 01:15:38,278
-But they don't know the truth.
-Truth? What truth?

952
01:15:38,481 --> 01:15:42,611
The truth that. at any minute. you might
bring a freight train through the waII.

953
01:15:42,786 --> 01:15:46,847
The truth that MaI is bursting
through your subconscious.

954
01:15:47,023 --> 01:15:49,423
And the truth that.
as we go deeper into Fischer...

955
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,389
...we're aIso going deeper into you.

956
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:55,493
And I'm not sure
we're gonna Iike what we find.

957
01:15:59,502 --> 01:16:00,969
We were working together.

958
01:16:01,137 --> 01:16:04,800
We were expIoring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

959
01:16:05,008 --> 01:16:06,270
I kept pushing things.

960
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:10,105
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

961
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:15,482
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours couId turn into years down there...

962
01:16:15,652 --> 01:16:18,382
...that we couId get trapped so deep...

963
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:22,521
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

964
01:16:23,126 --> 01:16:25,651
<i>...we lost sight of what was real.</i>

965
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:34,294
We created.
We buiIt the worId for ourseIves.

966
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,930
<i>We did that for years.</i>

967
01:16:39,075 --> 01:16:41,043
<i>We built our own world.</i>

968
01:16:42,412 --> 01:16:44,107
How Iong were you stuck there?

969
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:47,374
Domething Iike 50 years.

970
01:16:50,787 --> 01:16:51,947
Jesus.

971
01:16:54,257 --> 01:16:55,588
How couId you stand it?

972
01:16:55,758 --> 01:16:58,488
It wasn't so bad at first.
feeIing Iike gods.

973
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:01,687
<i>The problem was knowing</i>
<i>that none of it was real.</i>

974
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,268
EventuaIIy. it just became impossibIe
for me to Iive Iike that.

975
01:17:04,436 --> 01:17:05,835
And what about for her?

976
01:17:09,307 --> 01:17:13,209
<i>She had locked something away,</i>
<i>something deep inside her.</i>

977
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:19,796
<i>A truth that she had once known,</i>
<i>but chose to forget.</i>

978
01:17:22,737 --> 01:17:25,228
Limbo became her reaIity.

979
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,372
What happened when you woke up?

980
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:32,573
WeII. to wake up from that
after years. after decades...

981
01:17:33,648 --> 01:17:38,142
<i>...to become old souls thrown back</i>
<i>into youth like that?</i>

982
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:42,820
<i>l knew something was wrong with her.</i>
<i>She just wouldn't admit it.</i>

983
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:46,456
EventuaIIy. she toId me the truth.

984
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:50,262
<i>She was possessed by an idea.</i>

985
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:56,132
<i>This one very simple idea</i>
<i>that changed everything.</i>

986
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:59,740
That our worId wasn't reaI.

987
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:04,941
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reaIity...

988
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,846
...that in order to get back home...

989
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:10,881
...we had to kiII ourseIves.

990
01:18:17,525 --> 01:18:20,983
<i>-What about your children?</i>
<i>-She thought they were projections...</i>

991
01:18:21,162 --> 01:18:24,154
<i>...that our real children were waiting</i>
<i>for us up there somewhere.</i>

992
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:26,027
- I'm their mother!
- CaIm down.

993
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,463
I can teII the difference.

994
01:18:27,636 --> 01:18:29,968
If this is my dream.
why can't I controI this?

995
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:31,833
You don't know you're dreaming!

996
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:34,202
<i>She was certain</i>
<i>there was nothing l could do...</i>

997
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:38,210
...no matter how much I begged.
no matter how much I pIeaded.

998
01:18:41,182 --> 01:18:44,208
Dhe wanted to do it.
but she couId not do it aIone.

999
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:50,882
<i>She loved me too much, so she came up</i>
<i>with a plan on our anniversary.</i>

1000
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,750
-Dweetheart. what are you doing?
-Join me.

1001
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:24,187
Just-- Just step back inside. AII right?
Just step back inside now. come on.

1002
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:28,796
No. I'm going to jump.
and you're coming with me.

1003
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,659
No. I'm not.

1004
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,925
Now. you Iisten to me.

1005
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:37,767
If you jump. you're not gonna wake up.
remember? You're gonna die.

1006
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,873
Now. just step back inside.

1007
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:42,771
Come on. Dtep back inside
so we can taIk about this.

1008
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,878
We've taIked enough.

1009
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,609
-MaI.
-Come out onto the Iedge...

1010
01:19:48,783 --> 01:19:51,479
-...or I'II jump right now.
-Okay.

1011
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:57,554
We're gonna taIk about this.

1012
01:19:58,426 --> 01:19:59,586
AII right?

1013
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:04,824
-I'm asking you to take a Ieap of faith.
-No. honey.

1014
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,792
No. I can't. You know I can't do that.

1015
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,734
Take a second. think about our chiIdren.

1016
01:20:11,906 --> 01:20:13,635
Think about James.

1017
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,003
Think about PhiIIipa. now.

1018
01:20:16,177 --> 01:20:19,112
If I go without you.
they'II take them away anyway.

1019
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,579
-What does that mean?
-I fiIed a Ietter with our attorney...

1020
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:26,351
...expIaining how I'm fearfuI
for my safety.

1021
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,717
How you've threatened to kiII me.

1022
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:36,156
-Why did you do this?
-I Iove you. Dom.

1023
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,094
Why did--? Why wouId you do this to me?

1024
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:41,133
I've freed you from the guiIt
of choosing to Ieave them.

1025
01:20:41,302 --> 01:20:44,328
We're going home to our reaI chiIdren.

1026
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:48,135
Oh. no. no. no. MaI. you Iisten to me.
aII right? MaI. Iook at me. pIease?

1027
01:20:48,309 --> 01:20:49,606
You're waiting for a train.

1028
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:53,672
-MaI. goddamn it. don't do this!
-A train that wiII take you far away.

1029
01:20:53,848 --> 01:20:55,839
James and PhiIIipa are waiting for you!

1030
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:59,851
You know where you hope this train
wiII take you. but you can't know for sure.

1031
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:02,216
-MaI. Iook at me!
-But it doesn't matter.

1032
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,587
-MaI. goddamn it! MaI. Iisten to me!
-Because you'II be together.

1033
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,594
Dweetheart! Look at me! MaI. no!

1034
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:11,197
Jesus Christ!

1035
01:21:14,702 --> 01:21:18,433
Dhe had herseIf decIared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1036
01:21:18,606 --> 01:21:22,804
It made it impossibIe for me to try
to expIain the nature of her madness.

1037
01:21:22,977 --> 01:21:24,205
<i>So l ran.</i>

1038
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,277
Right now. or never. Cobb.

1039
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:39,286
James! PhiIIipa! Come on in! Come on!

1040
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,619
AII right. Iet's go.

1041
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:44,962
I Ieft my chiIdren behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1042
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:49,401
Your guiIt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1043
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,870
But you are not responsibIe
for the idea that destroyed her.

1044
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:56,669
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1045
01:21:56,845 --> 01:22:01,805
...you have to forgive yourseIf.
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1046
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:03,814
But you don't have to do that aIone.

1047
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:06,249
-No. you're not....
-I'm doing it for the others.

1048
01:22:06,921 --> 01:22:12,018
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1049
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,588
We have to move.

1050
01:22:18,766 --> 01:22:20,199
Time's up.

1051
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:23,098
AII right. I don't know any combination.

1052
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:26,365
-Not consciousIy. anyway.
How about instinctiveIy. huh?

1053
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:30,477
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1054
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:33,546
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1055
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,945
-I have no idea.
-Right now!

1056
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,347
I said. right now! Right now!

1057
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,422
Five. two. eight. four. nine. one.

1058
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,285
You'II have to do better than that.

1059
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:51,796
AII right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1060
01:22:56,171 --> 01:23:00,301
We're worth more to you aIive.
You hear me?

1061
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,070
What'd you get?

1062
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,007
ReIationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1063
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:11,209
This heIps us how?

1064
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:14,480
The stronger the issues.
the more powerfuI the catharsis.

1065
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,784
-How are we gonna reconciIe them?
-I'm working on that.

1066
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,487
Work faster.
The projections are cIosing in quick.

1067
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:26,225
We gotta break out of here
before we're totaIIy boxed in.

1068
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:02,360
Damn it.

1069
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,529
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a IittIe bigger. darIing.

1070
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:25,282
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1071
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:29,487
-Destroy his one positive reIationship?
-No. repair his reIationship with his father...

1072
01:24:29,664 --> 01:24:31,962
...whiIst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1073
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:35,125
We shouId charge Fischer a Iot more
than Daito for this job.

1074
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:37,669
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1075
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,330
-I think we run with Mr. CharIes.
-No.

1076
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,175
Who's Mr. CharIes?
-Bad idea.

1077
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:45,870
The second we get into that hoteI
his security's gonna be aII over us.

1078
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:48,140
We run with Mr. CharIes
Iike on the Dtein job.

1079
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,648
-You've done it before?
Yeah. and it didn't work.

1080
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:54,310
The subject reaIized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1081
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:56,514
ExceIIent. But you Iearned a Iot. right?

1082
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:58,784
-I need some kind of distraction.
No probIem.

1083
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,155
How about a IoveIy Iady
that I've used before?

1084
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:03,388
Listen to me.
You drive carefuIIy. aII right?

1085
01:25:03,564 --> 01:25:06,032
Everything down there is
gonna be unstabIe as heII.

1086
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:13,938
Don't jump too soon. We onIy got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1087
01:25:14,108 --> 01:25:17,407
I'II pIay the music to Iet you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1088
01:25:17,578 --> 01:25:19,375
-You ready?
-Ready!

1089
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:21,707
Dweet dreams.

1090
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,783
Am I boring you?

1091
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:28,283
I was teIIing you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your Iiking.

1092
01:25:30,124 --> 01:25:32,786
Um. I have a Iot on my mind.

1093
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:35,921
There goes Mr. CharIes.

1094
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:43,263
Mr. Fischer. right?

1095
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:46,930
PIeasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. I--

1096
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:48,234
Hmm.

1097
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:51,071
-And you must be?
-Leaving.

1098
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:55,441
In case you get bored.

1099
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:02,053
Must've bIown you off.

1100
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,953
That is. unIess her phone number
reaIIy is onIy six digits.

1101
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:11,565
Funny way to make friends.
someone steaIing your waIIet Iike that.

1102
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,835
Goddamn it. The waIIet aIone
is worth at Ieast 500--

1103
01:26:18,005 --> 01:26:19,131
About $500. right?

1104
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:22,276
Don't worry about it.
My peopIe are aIready on it as we speak.

1105
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:24,377
Who or what is Mr. CharIes?

1106
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:28,276
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1107
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:29,780
And why don't you approve?

1108
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:31,942
It invoIves teIIing the mark
that he's dreaming...

1109
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,247
...which invoIves attracting
a Iot of attention to us.

1110
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:37,357
-Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
-Hmm.

1111
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:39,288
Do now you've noticed how much time...

1112
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:42,088
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1113
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,594
Mr. Daito. can I have a moment?

1114
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:48,201
-I'm sorry. but....
HoId on! Wait!

1115
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:50,834
You Iook a bit perkier.

1116
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:53,337
Very amusing. Mr. Eames.

1117
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,070
TurbuIence on the pIane?

1118
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:02,944
No. it's much cIoser.

1119
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:04,778
That's Yusuf's driving.

1120
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:15,595
Um. I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

1121
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:17,856
Rod Green from marketing.

1122
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:19,624
But that's not true at aII. is it?

1123
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:25,194
My name is Mr. CharIes.
You remember me. don't you?

1124
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,374
I'm the head of your security down here.

1125
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:30,577
Get out on a different fIoor.
keep moving.

1126
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:33,077
Dump the waIIet.
Decurity wiII be Iooking for that.

1127
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:36,739
-Okay.
-We need to buy Cobb a IittIe more time.

1128
01:27:40,388 --> 01:27:41,946
Decurity. huh?

1129
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:46,553
-You work for the hoteI?
-No. no.

1130
01:27:46,727 --> 01:27:51,323
I speciaIize in a very specific type
of security.

1131
01:27:51,732 --> 01:27:53,393
Dubconscious security.

1132
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:55,661
You're taIking about dreams?

1133
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:58,704
Are you taIking about. um. extraction?

1134
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:01,139
I am here to protect you.

1135
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:17,114
Mr. Fischer. I'm here
to protect you in the event...

1136
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:20,658
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1137
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:23,456
You're not safe here.

1138
01:28:24,298 --> 01:28:25,890
They're coming for you.

1139
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:46,277
Dtrange weather. isn't it?

1140
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,251
You feeI that?

1141
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:55,422
What's happening?

1142
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,827
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1143
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,867
...which is making his subconscious
Iook for the dreamer.

1144
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:05,096
For me. Quick. give me a kiss.

1145
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:13,979
-They're stiII Iooking at us.
-Yeah. it was worth a shot.

1146
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:16,674
We shouId probabIy get out of here.

1147
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:35,527
You feeI that? You've actuaIIy
been trained for this. Mr. Fischer.

1148
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:39,696
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather. the shift in gravity.

1149
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:43,037
None of this is reaI. You're in a dream.

1150
01:29:47,848 --> 01:29:50,078
Now. the easiest way
for you to test yourseIf...

1151
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:54,345
...is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hoteI. Can you do that?

1152
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:56,486
Yeah. I....

1153
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:59,182
No. breathe. breathe.
Remember your training.

1154
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:04,525
Accept the fact that you're in a dream.
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

1155
01:30:06,534 --> 01:30:07,899
Mm-hm.

1156
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:12,536
-You're not reaI?
-No.

1157
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:16,074
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1158
01:30:16,243 --> 01:30:18,336
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

1159
01:30:18,512 --> 01:30:21,413
...that extractors
tried to puII you into a dream.

1160
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:24,813
And I beIieve that's what's
going on right now. Mr. Fischer.

1161
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,944
Yeah.

1162
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:28,213
Okay.

1163
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:30,351
Okay.

1164
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,185
Can you get me out of here?

1165
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:38,691
Right away. FoIIow me.

1166
01:30:52,913 --> 01:30:54,244
HoId on a second.

1167
01:30:59,186 --> 01:31:01,017
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1168
01:31:01,188 --> 01:31:03,452
These men were sent here
to abduct you. aII right?

1169
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:06,184
If you want my heIp.
you have to remain caIm.

1170
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:10,226
I need you to work with me. Mr. Fischer.

1171
01:31:21,942 --> 01:31:25,537
If this is a dream. I shouId just
kiII myseIf to wake up. right?

1172
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:27,806
I wouIdn't do that if I were you.
Mr. Fischer.

1173
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:31,474
I beIieve they have you sedated.
and if you puII that trigger...

1174
01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:32,812
...you may not wake up.

1175
01:31:33,954 --> 01:31:38,254
You may go into a further dream state.
Now. you know what I'm taIking about.

1176
01:31:40,594 --> 01:31:42,255
You remember the training.

1177
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:44,796
Remember what I said to you.

1178
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:46,826
Give me the gun.

1179
01:31:58,646 --> 01:32:01,240
-This room shouId be directIy beIow 528?
-Yeah.

1180
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,114
Think. Mr. Fischer. think.

1181
01:32:12,293 --> 01:32:16,127
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1182
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:19,125
There was. um. a Iot of gunfire.

1183
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,894
There was rain.

1184
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,028
UncIe Peter.

1185
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:27,934
-Oh. my God. we've been kidnapped.
-Where were they hoIding you?

1186
01:32:30,978 --> 01:32:34,243
-They had us in the back of a van.
-That expIains the gravity shifts.

1187
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,507
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1188
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:38,948
It had something to do with. um....

1189
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:42,454
Domething to do with a safe.

1190
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:44,717
God. why is it so hard to remember?

1191
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:47,588
It's Iike trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1192
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:49,491
Listen. it takes years of practice.

1193
01:32:49,663 --> 01:32:52,063
You and Browning have been puIIed
into this dream...

1194
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,997
...because they're trying to steaI
something from your mind.

1195
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:58,730
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1196
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:00,533
What is it. Mr. Fischer? Think!

1197
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:04,439
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1198
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:07,342
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1199
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:11,281
It can represent anything.
We're in a hoteI right now.

1200
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:15,214
We shouId try hoteI rooms.
What was the number. Mr. Fischer?

1201
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:18,222
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1202
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:19,723
Five.

1203
01:33:20,694 --> 01:33:23,128
Five. two-- It was something.
it was a Iong number.

1204
01:33:23,297 --> 01:33:25,390
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth fIoor.

1205
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:26,590
Yep.

1206
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:30,794
-Do do you use a timer?
-No. I have to judge it for myseIf.

1207
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:34,270
WhiIe you're aII asIeep in 528.
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1208
01:33:34,441 --> 01:33:36,568
-WeII. how wiII you know?
-His music warns me.

1209
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:40,680
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge. that shouId be unmistakabIe.

1210
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:44,045
Do we get a nice synchronized kick.

1211
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:46,618
If it's too soon.
we won't get puIIed out.

1212
01:33:46,787 --> 01:33:50,052
But if it's too Iate.
I won't be abIe to drop us.

1213
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:54,024
-WeII. why not?
-Because the van wiII be in freefaII.

1214
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:57,395
-Can't drop you without gravity.
-Right.

1215
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:05,267
They're with me. Go on.

1216
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:30,621
Mr. CharIes.

1217
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:33,767
-Do you know what that is. Mr. Fischer?
-Yeah. I think so.

1218
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:35,993
They were trying to put you under.

1219
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:38,496
-I'm aIready under.
-Under again.

1220
01:34:38,672 --> 01:34:41,232
What do you mean.
a dream within a dream?

1221
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:44,310
Hey. I see you've changed.

1222
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,105
I'm sorry?

1223
01:34:46,614 --> 01:34:50,482
Oh. I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

1224
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:51,913
Oh.

1225
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:54,213
Good-Iooking feIIow. I'm sure.

1226
01:34:54,889 --> 01:34:57,824
No. no. no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1227
01:34:57,992 --> 01:34:59,857
Let's foIIow him
and see how he behaves.

1228
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:01,995
-Why?
-Because how he acts wiII teII us...

1229
01:35:02,162 --> 01:35:05,495
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1230
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:06,690
Dhh.

1231
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:13,763
-UncIe Peter.
-You said you were kidnapped together?

1232
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:17,377
WeII. not exactIy. They aIready had him.
They were torturing him.

1233
01:35:17,544 --> 01:35:19,011
And you saw them torture him?

1234
01:35:26,553 --> 01:35:28,384
The kidnappers are working for you?

1235
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:30,823
Robert.

1236
01:35:30,991 --> 01:35:34,825
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the aIternate wiII?

1237
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:39,461
Fischer Morrow has been my entire Iife.
I can't Iet you destroy it.

1238
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:41,999
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

1239
01:35:42,169 --> 01:35:46,333
I couIdn't Iet you rise
to your father's Iast taunt.

1240
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:50,167
-What taunt?
-The wiII. Robert. That wiII?

1241
01:35:50,344 --> 01:35:52,278
That's his Iast insuIt.

1242
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:56,075
A chaIIenge for you to buiId something
for yourseIf...

1243
01:35:56,250 --> 01:36:00,050
...by teIIing you you're not worthy
of his accompIishments.

1244
01:36:05,726 --> 01:36:11,096
-What. but that he was. um. disappointed?
-I'm sorry.

1245
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:15,560
But he's wrong.

1246
01:36:16,303 --> 01:36:18,931
You can buiId a better company
than he ever did.

1247
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:21,540
Mr. Fischer? He's Iying.

1248
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:23,802
-How do you know?
-Trust me. it's what I do.

1249
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:26,742
He's hiding something.
and we need to find out what that is.

1250
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:31,349
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1251
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:37,982
We'II enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

1252
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:40,726
AII right.

1253
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:47,962
He's out.
-Wait.

1254
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,194
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactIy?

1255
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:51,702
We're going into Fischer's.

1256
01:36:51,872 --> 01:36:54,568
I toId him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1257
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:57,074
He's gonna heIp us break
into his own subconscious.

1258
01:36:57,244 --> 01:36:58,802
That's right.

1259
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:01,038
Decurity's gonna run you down hard.

1260
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:03,547
And I wiII Iead them on a merry chase.

1261
01:37:04,118 --> 01:37:06,746
-Just be back before the kick.
-Go to sIeep. Mr. Eames.

1262
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:13,153
You good?

1263
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,661
Hey. You ready?

1264
01:37:17,831 --> 01:37:21,426
Yes. yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1265
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:35,312
Cobb?

1266
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,417
Cobb? What's down there?

1267
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:44,383
HopefuIIy. the truth
we want Fischer to Iearn.

1268
01:37:44,558 --> 01:37:46,458
I mean. what's down there for you?

1269
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:24,813
Did you see that?

1270
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:45,134
Eames. this is your dream.

1271
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:48,399
I need you to draw the security away
from the compIex. understand?

1272
01:40:48,575 --> 01:40:50,372
-Who guides Fischer in?
Not me.

1273
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:53,012
If I know the route.
everything couId be compromised.

1274
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:55,705
-I designed the pIace.
No. you're with me.

1275
01:40:55,882 --> 01:40:57,406
I couId do it.

1276
01:40:57,851 --> 01:41:00,285
AII right. Brief him on the route
into the compIex.

1277
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:04,652
-Fischer. you'II be going with him.
-AII right. What about you?

1278
01:41:04,825 --> 01:41:07,658
You keep this Iive.
I'II be Iistening in the whoIe time.

1279
01:41:07,828 --> 01:41:11,958
The windows on that upper fIoor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1280
01:41:12,132 --> 01:41:13,429
You're not coming in?

1281
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,932
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

1282
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:19,129
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1283
01:41:20,007 --> 01:41:21,474
Come on. Fischer!

1284
01:42:16,563 --> 01:42:20,226
-Dound the aIarm! Dound the aIarm!
-Go. go. go!

1285
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,924
Move!

1286
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:24,528
Go!

1287
01:42:39,753 --> 01:42:40,777
Dod it.

1288
01:42:51,965 --> 01:42:53,626
I hope you're ready.

1289
01:43:02,376 --> 01:43:04,139
No. it's too soon.

1290
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:11,844
Cobb. do you hear that?

1291
01:43:12,018 --> 01:43:15,579
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago.
I thought it was the wind up here.

1292
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:18,614
Yeah. I hear it. It's music.

1293
01:43:18,792 --> 01:43:20,191
Do. what do we do?

1294
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,759
We move fast.

1295
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:29,497
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1296
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:33,737
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1297
01:43:34,674 --> 01:43:36,767
-Hey!
-That's him!

1298
01:43:37,444 --> 01:43:39,173
-Which gives us what?
-Dixty minutes.

1299
01:43:39,346 --> 01:43:42,611
-Can they make that route in an hour?
-They have to cIimb to the terrace.

1300
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:45,650
Then they need a new route.
a more direct route.

1301
01:43:56,863 --> 01:43:58,490
It's designed as a Iabyrinth.

1302
01:43:58,665 --> 01:44:01,133
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1303
01:44:01,301 --> 01:44:02,893
Eames?

1304
01:44:25,992 --> 01:44:27,254
Did Eames add any features?

1305
01:44:27,427 --> 01:44:28,894
I don't think I shouId teII you.

1306
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:31,360
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

1307
01:44:31,798 --> 01:44:34,562
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1308
01:44:34,734 --> 01:44:35,928
Good. ExpIain it to them.

1309
01:44:36,102 --> 01:44:37,330
<i>Saito?</i>
-Go ahead.

1310
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:12,228
Paradox.

1311
01:46:22,108 --> 01:46:24,167
What was that?
-The kick.

1312
01:46:24,778 --> 01:46:26,678
Cobb! Cobb. did we miss it?

1313
01:46:26,846 --> 01:46:28,541
Yeah. we missed it.

1314
01:46:28,715 --> 01:46:29,909
Man.

1315
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:34,383
CouIdn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?

1316
01:46:34,554 --> 01:46:35,816
Uh-huh.

1317
01:46:36,556 --> 01:46:38,717
<i>Well, what the hell do we do now?</i>

1318
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:40,723
We finish the job before the next kick.

1319
01:46:40,894 --> 01:46:42,987
-What next kick?
-When the van hits the water.

1320
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:09,288
<i>lf you'd like to</i>
<i>make a call, please hang up and try again.</i>

1321
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:11,287
<i>lf you need help, hang up....</i>

1322
01:47:11,524 --> 01:47:14,823
How do I drop you without gravity?

1323
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:19,992
Arthur has a coupIe minutes.
and we have about 20.

1324
01:47:43,423 --> 01:47:45,084
You okay?

1325
01:47:49,562 --> 01:47:53,430
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1326
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,124
Go. go. go!

1327
01:47:57,303 --> 01:47:58,463
There's something wrong.

1328
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:00,970
They're heading your way.
Iike they know something.

1329
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:04,438
Just buy us more time. aII right?

1330
01:48:04,611 --> 01:48:06,442
-Come on!
-On my way.

1331
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:08,308
Come on! Move!

1332
01:49:32,499 --> 01:49:34,023
AII right.

1333
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:49,010
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1334
01:49:49,182 --> 01:49:52,674
-Does the strong room have windows?
-It wouIdn't be very strong if it did.

1335
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:55,082
Let's hope Fischer Iikes
what he finds in there.

1336
01:49:56,723 --> 01:50:00,056
-Are those projections his subconscious?
-Yes.

1337
01:50:00,226 --> 01:50:03,593
-Are you destroying parts of his mind?
-No. They're just projections.

1338
01:50:29,889 --> 01:50:31,618
-We're here.
-You're cIear. but hurry.

1339
01:50:31,791 --> 01:50:33,622
There's an entire army headed your way.

1340
01:51:00,453 --> 01:51:01,818
I'm in.

1341
01:51:07,126 --> 01:51:08,252
There he is.

1342
01:51:50,904 --> 01:51:53,600
-There's someone in there.
-Fischer. it's a trap. Get out.

1343
01:51:54,774 --> 01:51:57,334
Come on. Come on. a IittIe Iower.

1344
01:52:03,082 --> 01:52:04,242
Cobb.

1345
01:52:04,884 --> 01:52:07,409
No. she is not reaI.

1346
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:09,249
How do you know that?

1347
01:52:09,422 --> 01:52:13,051
Dhe is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is reaI.

1348
01:52:17,063 --> 01:52:18,587
HeIIo.

1349
01:52:23,269 --> 01:52:26,466
Eames!
Eames. get to the antechamber now!

1350
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:13,250
What happened?
-MaI kiIIed Fischer.

1351
01:53:15,521 --> 01:53:17,546
I couIdn't shoot her.

1352
01:53:18,224 --> 01:53:21,591
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's aIready trapped down there.

1353
01:53:21,761 --> 01:53:22,819
It's aII over.

1354
01:53:24,564 --> 01:53:26,191
Do that's it. then? We faiIed?

1355
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,994
We're done. I'm sorry.

1356
01:53:32,872 --> 01:53:35,500
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my famiIy. is it?

1357
01:53:36,209 --> 01:53:40,111
Dhame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

1358
01:53:40,279 --> 01:53:42,338
Let's set the charges.

1359
01:53:44,183 --> 01:53:45,673
No. there's stiII another way.

1360
01:53:46,986 --> 01:53:50,387
-We have to foIIow Fischer down there.
-Not enough time.

1361
01:53:50,556 --> 01:53:53,389
No. but there wiII be enough time
down there.

1362
01:53:54,527 --> 01:53:55,619
And we wiII find him.

1363
01:53:55,795 --> 01:53:59,731
Okay. as soon as Arthur's music kicks in.
just use the defibriIIator to revive him.

1364
01:53:59,899 --> 01:54:02,800
We can give him his own kick
down beIow.

1365
01:54:03,836 --> 01:54:05,531
Look. you get him in there.

1366
01:54:05,705 --> 01:54:08,572
As soon as the music ends.
you bIow up the hospitaI...

1367
01:54:08,741 --> 01:54:11,539
...and we aII ride the kick
back up the Iayers.

1368
01:54:12,745 --> 01:54:17,512
It's worth a shot. if Daito can hoId
the guards off whiIe I set the charges.

1369
01:54:17,683 --> 01:54:19,776
Daito wiII never make it. wiII he?

1370
01:54:21,087 --> 01:54:24,284
-Cobb. come on. We've gotta try this.
-Go for it.

1371
01:54:24,457 --> 01:54:27,392
If you are not back before the kick.
I am gone with or without you.

1372
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:30,791
Dhe's right. Dhe's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1373
01:54:35,034 --> 01:54:37,229
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1374
01:54:37,403 --> 01:54:38,597
MaI's gonna be down there.

1375
01:54:38,771 --> 01:54:41,205
I know where to find her.
Dhe'II have Fischer.

1376
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:45,276
-How do you know?
-Because she wants me to come after him.

1377
01:54:45,445 --> 01:54:47,606
Dhe wants me back down there with her.

1378
01:55:14,373 --> 01:55:15,397
AII right?

1379
01:55:22,648 --> 01:55:25,310
-This is your worId?
-It was.

1380
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:28,053
And this is where she'II be.

1381
01:55:28,855 --> 01:55:30,345
Come on.

1382
01:56:16,836 --> 01:56:19,304
Daito. Daito.

1383
01:56:19,739 --> 01:56:23,698
I need you to take care of Fischer
whiIe I go set some charges. okay?

1384
01:56:23,876 --> 01:56:27,312
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1385
01:56:29,949 --> 01:56:31,109
Don't be siIIy.

1386
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:05,675
You buiIt aII this? This is incredibIe.

1387
01:57:06,152 --> 01:57:08,177
We buiIt for years.

1388
01:57:09,222 --> 01:57:11,213
Then we started in on the memories.

1389
01:57:18,264 --> 01:57:19,663
This way.

1390
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:03,433
This was our neighborhood.

1391
01:58:03,609 --> 01:58:05,941
PIaces from our past.

1392
01:58:06,112 --> 01:58:07,875
That was our first apartment.

1393
01:58:08,047 --> 01:58:10,277
Then we moved to that buiIding
right there.

1394
01:58:10,449 --> 01:58:12,974
After MaI became pregnant.
that became our home.

1395
01:58:13,152 --> 01:58:15,950
You reconstructed aII of this
from memory?

1396
01:58:16,122 --> 01:58:18,386
Like I toId you. we had Iots of time.

1397
01:58:18,557 --> 01:58:20,149
What is that?

1398
01:58:21,694 --> 01:58:23,457
That's the house MaI grew up in.

1399
01:58:23,629 --> 01:58:26,063
-WeII. wiII she be in there?
-No.

1400
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:27,423
Come on.

1401
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:30,933
We both wanted to Iive in a house.
but we Ioved this type of buiIding.

1402
01:58:31,103 --> 01:58:34,038
In the reaI worId.
we'd have to choose. but not here.

1403
01:59:14,613 --> 01:59:16,638
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1404
01:59:17,049 --> 01:59:19,483
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1405
01:59:19,652 --> 01:59:21,051
What?

1406
01:59:22,054 --> 01:59:23,146
I'm gonna improvise.

1407
01:59:23,322 --> 01:59:27,986
Listen. there's something you shouId
know about me. About inception.

1408
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:44,941
An idea is Iike a virus. ResiIient.

1409
01:59:45,778 --> 01:59:47,336
HighIy contagious.

1410
01:59:47,513 --> 01:59:50,846
And the smaIIest seed
of an idea can grow.

1411
01:59:51,917 --> 01:59:53,885
It can grow to define...

1412
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:56,478
...or destroy you.

1413
02:00:02,995 --> 02:00:05,361
''Your worId is not reaI.''

1414
02:00:05,631 --> 02:00:09,397
DimpIe IittIe thought
that changes everything.

1415
02:00:10,636 --> 02:00:15,130
Do certain of your worId. Of what's reaI.

1416
02:00:15,307 --> 02:00:17,104
Do you think he is?

1417
02:00:18,911 --> 02:00:21,812
Or do you think he's as Iost as I was?

1418
02:00:22,948 --> 02:00:24,438
I know what's reaI. MaI.

1419
02:00:26,519 --> 02:00:28,817
No creeping doubts?

1420
02:00:29,522 --> 02:00:32,150
Not feeIing persecuted. Dom?

1421
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:33,789
Chased around the gIobe...

1422
02:00:33,959 --> 02:00:36,621
...by anonymous corporations
and poIice forces...

1423
02:00:36,796 --> 02:00:39,424
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1424
02:00:41,033 --> 02:00:42,523
Admit it.

1425
02:00:43,836 --> 02:00:46,669
You don't beIieve in one reaIity anymore.

1426
02:00:46,839 --> 02:00:48,363
Do choose.

1427
02:00:48,541 --> 02:00:50,805
Choose to be here.

1428
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:52,800
Choose me.

1429
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:19,933
You know what I have to do.

1430
02:01:20,105 --> 02:01:22,767
I have to get back to our chiIdren
because you Ieft them.

1431
02:01:24,109 --> 02:01:25,633
Because you Ieft us.

1432
02:01:25,811 --> 02:01:27,608
-You're wrong.
I'm not wrong.

1433
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:29,805
You're confused.

1434
02:01:30,916 --> 02:01:32,975
Our chiIdren are here.

1435
02:01:33,752 --> 02:01:37,017
And you'd Iike to see their faces again.
wouIdn't you?

1436
02:01:37,189 --> 02:01:40,249
Yes. but I'm gonna see them
up above. MaI.

1437
02:01:53,906 --> 02:01:55,897
Up above?

1438
02:01:56,809 --> 02:02:00,438
Listen to yourseIf.
These are our chiIdren.

1439
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:02,345
Watch.

1440
02:02:02,848 --> 02:02:04,543
James? PhiIIipa?

1441
02:02:04,717 --> 02:02:07,151
Don't do this. MaI. PIease.
Those aren't my chiIdren.

1442
02:02:07,319 --> 02:02:09,787
You keep teIIing yourseIf that.
but you don't beIieve it.

1443
02:02:09,955 --> 02:02:11,855
-No. I know it.
-What if you're wrong?

1444
02:02:12,258 --> 02:02:14,556
What if I'm what's reaI?

1445
02:02:15,761 --> 02:02:17,991
You keep teIIing yourseIf what you know.

1446
02:02:19,565 --> 02:02:21,795
But what do you beIieve?

1447
02:02:22,768 --> 02:02:23,996
What do you feeI?

1448
02:02:26,138 --> 02:02:27,571
GuiIt.

1449
02:02:28,774 --> 02:02:31,004
I feeI guiIt. MaI.

1450
02:02:31,544 --> 02:02:35,480
And no matter what I do.
no matter how hopeIess I am...

1451
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:39,914
...no matter how confused.
that guiIt is aIways there...

1452
02:02:40,085 --> 02:02:42,610
...reminding me of the truth.

1453
02:02:43,122 --> 02:02:44,419
What truth?

1454
02:02:46,859 --> 02:02:52,092
That the idea that caused you to question
your reaIity came from me.

1455
02:02:55,467 --> 02:02:58,595
You pIanted the idea in my mind?

1456
02:03:00,105 --> 02:03:01,595
What is she taIking about?

1457
02:03:02,508 --> 02:03:07,775
The reason I knew inception was possibIe
was because I did it to her first.

1458
02:03:08,814 --> 02:03:11,783
-I did it to my own wife.
-Why?

1459
02:03:12,518 --> 02:03:14,008
We were Iost in here.

1460
02:03:14,954 --> 02:03:19,584
<i>l knew we needed to escape,</i>
<i>but she wouldn't accept it.</i>

1461
02:03:22,795 --> 02:03:28,461
<i>She had locked something away,</i>
<i>something deep inside.</i>

1462
02:03:29,234 --> 02:03:33,364
<i>A truth that she had once known,</i>
<i>but chose to forget.</i>

1463
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:36,467
And she couIdn't break free.

1464
02:03:39,178 --> 02:03:41,908
<i>So l decided to search for it.</i>

1465
02:03:42,481 --> 02:03:47,350
<i>l went deep into the recess of her mind</i>
<i>and found that secret place.</i>

1466
02:03:47,519 --> 02:03:49,419
<i>And l broke in...</i>

1467
02:03:49,989 --> 02:03:52,150
<i>...and l planted an idea.</i>

1468
02:03:52,891 --> 02:03:56,657
<i>A simple little idea</i>
<i>that would change everything.</i>

1469
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:04,266
<i>That her world wasn't real.</i>

1470
02:04:17,082 --> 02:04:20,279
That death was the onIy escape.

1471
02:04:27,693 --> 02:04:29,456
You're waiting for a train.

1472
02:04:31,764 --> 02:04:34,494
A train that'II take you far away.

1473
02:04:35,668 --> 02:04:38,660
You know where you hope
this train wiII take you...

1474
02:04:39,772 --> 02:04:41,797
...but you can't know for sure.

1475
02:04:42,975 --> 02:04:44,499
Yet it doesn't matter.

1476
02:04:45,944 --> 02:04:49,107
-Now. teII me why!
-Because you'II be together!

1477
02:04:53,452 --> 02:04:57,513
<i>But l never knew that that idea</i>
<i>would grow in her mind like a cancer...</i>

1478
02:04:57,690 --> 02:05:00,090
<i>...that even after she woke....</i>

1479
02:05:02,995 --> 02:05:05,463
That even after
you came back to reaIity...

1480
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,369
...that you'd continue to beIieve
your worId wasn't reaI.

1481
02:05:14,139 --> 02:05:16,539
That death was the onIy escape.

1482
02:05:16,709 --> 02:05:19,371
MaI. no! Jesus!

1483
02:05:19,545 --> 02:05:23,242
-You infected my mind.
-I was trying to save you.

1484
02:05:23,415 --> 02:05:24,814
You betrayed me.

1485
02:05:25,651 --> 02:05:29,348
But you can make amends.
You can stiII keep your promise.

1486
02:05:29,521 --> 02:05:32,547
We can stiII be together. right here...

1487
02:05:32,725 --> 02:05:35,193
...in the worId we buiIt together.

1488
02:06:56,008 --> 02:06:58,340
Cobb. we need to get Fischer.

1489
02:06:59,211 --> 02:07:00,508
You can't have him.

1490
02:07:01,547 --> 02:07:04,983
-If I stay here. wiII you Iet him go?
-What are you taIking about?

1491
02:07:09,454 --> 02:07:11,285
Fischer is on the porch.

1492
02:07:11,857 --> 02:07:14,451
-Go check he's aIive. Ariadne.
-Cobb. you can't do this.

1493
02:07:14,626 --> 02:07:17,254
Go check he's aIive right now. Do it.

1494
02:07:32,911 --> 02:07:36,005
He's here! And it's time.
but you have to come now!

1495
02:07:36,181 --> 02:07:39,844
You take Fischer with you. aII right?
-You can't stay here to be with her.

1496
02:07:42,421 --> 02:07:45,117
I'm not. Daito's dead by now.

1497
02:07:45,290 --> 02:07:48,782
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1498
02:07:50,796 --> 02:07:53,890
I can't stay with her anymore.
because she doesn't exist.

1499
02:07:54,066 --> 02:07:57,467
I'm the onIy thing
you do beIieve in anymore.

1500
02:07:57,636 --> 02:07:58,967
No.

1501
02:08:00,138 --> 02:08:01,571
I wish.

1502
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:05,666
I wish more than anything. but...

1503
02:08:06,778 --> 02:08:09,508
...I can't imagine you
with aII your compIexity...

1504
02:08:09,681 --> 02:08:12,206
...aII your perfection.

1505
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:14,342
-You aII right?
-Yeah.

1506
02:08:14,519 --> 02:08:16,350
Look at you.

1507
02:08:17,589 --> 02:08:22,526
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my reaI wife.

1508
02:08:22,961 --> 02:08:25,589
And you were the best
that I couId do. but...

1509
02:08:26,431 --> 02:08:28,865
...I'm sorry. you're just not good enough.

1510
02:08:29,034 --> 02:08:30,661
Does this feeI reaI?

1511
02:08:33,071 --> 02:08:35,665
-What are you doing?
-Improvising.

1512
02:08:44,283 --> 02:08:45,978
No. no. no!

1513
02:08:46,952 --> 02:08:49,352
In there. now. Go. go. go.

1514
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:36,099
I was dis--

1515
02:09:37,803 --> 02:09:40,135

No. no. no.

1521
02:09:58,490 --> 02:10:00,481
I was disappointed...

1522
02:10:02,227 --> 02:10:04,161
...that you tried.

1523
02:10:27,419 --> 02:10:29,080
What?

1524
02:10:38,530 --> 02:10:39,656
Come on. come on.

1525
02:11:09,895 --> 02:11:11,385
Dad?

1526
02:11:49,735 --> 02:11:52,795
That's the kick. Ariadne!
You have to go now!

02:12:53,999 --> 02:12:55,091
Yes.

1531
02:12:55,267 --> 02:12:58,327
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow oId together.

1532
02:13:01,039 --> 02:13:02,529
But we did.

1533
02:13:04,476 --> 02:13:06,842
<i>We did. You don't remember?</i>

1534
02:13:11,516 --> 02:13:14,349
I miss you more than I can bear...

1535
02:13:16,721 --> 02:13:18,712
...but we had our time together.

1536
02:13:20,058 --> 02:13:22,117

You know. the wiII means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1540
02:14:50,982 --> 02:14:53,007
...not just to Iive for him.

1541
02:14:54,619 --> 02:14:57,144
That's what I'm gonna do. UncIe Peter.

02:15:42,434 --> 02:15:44,902

02:15:54,879 --> 02:15:56,278
Cobb?

1551
02:15:58,216 --> 02:15:59,979
ImpossibIe.

1552
02:16:00,518 --> 02:16:03,112
We were young men together.

1553
02:16:04,723 --> 02:16:07,055
I'm an oId man.

1554

Domething you once knew.

That this worId is not reaI.

1560
02:16:44,329 --> 02:16:48,823
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1561
02:16:49,667 --> 02:16:52,431
To take a Ieap of faith. yes.

1562
02:16:58,543 --> 02:16:59,874
Come back...

1563
