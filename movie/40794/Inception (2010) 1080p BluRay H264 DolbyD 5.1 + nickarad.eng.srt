"I will split up my father's empire."

669

Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

670
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,870
which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious.

The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason.

company as a "screw you" to the old man.

No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis.

a positive emotional reaction to all this.

And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

02:15:19,730 --> 02:15:21,530
No, he'll be all right.

1717
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:40,290
SAITO: Have you come to kill me?

1718
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:46,180
I'm waiting for someone.

1719
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:53,850
COBB: Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1720
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:57,480
Cobb?

1721
02:15:58,690 --> 02:15:59,590
[SCOFFS]

1722
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:01,270
Impossible.

1723
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:04,440
We were young men together.

1724
02:16:06,110 --> 02:16:08,280
I'm an old man.

1725
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:11,870
Filled with regret.

1726
02:16:14,870 --> 02:16:17,580
Waiting to die alone.

1727
02:16:20,750 --> 02:16:22,830
I've come back for you.

1728
02:16:26,210 --> 02:16:30,180
To remind you of something.

1729
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:35,770
Something you once knew.

1730
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:41,360
That this world is not real.

1731
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:50,070
To convince me to honor our arrangement?

1732
02:16:51,070 --> 02:16:54,280
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1733
02:16:59,910 --> 02:17:01,500
Come back...

1734
02:17:03,790 --> 02:17:06,920
so we can be young men together again.

1735
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:13,180
Come back with me.

1736
02:17:16,010 --> 02:17:17,510
Come back.

1737
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:29,520
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Hot towel, sir?

1738
02:17:29,530 --> 02:17:32,560
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 20 minutes.

1739
02:17:32,570 --> 02:17:36,940
Do you need immigration forms?

1740
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:38,780
Thank you.

1741
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:41,400
Hot towel, sir?

1742
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:46,410
No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1743
02:18:55,780 --> 02:18:57,980
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1744
02:18:57,990 --> 02:18:59,990
Thank you, sir.

1745
02:19:43,810 --> 02:19:45,120
Welcome.

1746
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:46,460
This way.

1747
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:13,100
MILES: James? Phillipa?

1748
02:20:15,270 --> 02:20:20,270
Look who's here.

1749
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:24,320
Hey...

1750
02:20:24,330 --> 02:20:27,190
Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
- PHILLIPA: Daddy! Daddy!

1751
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:30,570
JAMES: Daddy!
- COBB: How are you?

1752
02:20:30,580 --> 02:20:32,320
Look what I've been building!

1753
02:20:32,330 --> 02:20:36,200
What are you building?
- JAMES: We're building a house on the cliff!

1754
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:39,250
COBB: On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1755
02:20:39,260 --> 02:20:42,030
JAMES: Let's go.
- PHILLIPA: Come on, Daddy!

1756
02:20:53,660 --> 02:21:27,000
