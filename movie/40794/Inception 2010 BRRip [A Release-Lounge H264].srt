1
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:38,459
He was delirious. But asked for you
by name.

2
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,058
Show him.

3
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:46,059
He was carrying nothing but this....

4
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:49,062
... and this.

5
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,528
Are you here to kill me?

6
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,704
l know what this is.

7
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,947
l've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

8
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:35,453
lt belonged to a man l met
in a half-remembered dream.

9
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:42,561
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

10
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:49,299
What is the most resilient parasite?

11
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:52,937
A bacteria? A virus?

12
00:02:53,502 --> 00:02:54,770
An intestinal worm?

13
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:56,338
Uh....

14
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:58,139
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say

15
00:02:58,304 --> 00:02:59,507
An idea.

16
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:03,314
Resilient. Highly contagious.

17
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:07,485
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

18
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:12,190
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

19
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:13,589
Right in there somewhere.

20
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,325
For someone like you to steal?

21
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,429
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

22
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:21,031
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

23
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:22,432
lt's called extraction.

24
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,170
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

25
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,838
...from even the most skilled extractor.

26
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:30,173
How can you do that?

27
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:33,177
Because l am the most skilled extractor.

28
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:37,048
l know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. l know the tricks.

29
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:40,151
And l can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

30
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:42,653
...your defense is never down.

31
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:47,460
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

32
00:03:47,623 --> 00:03:50,996
l need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

33
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:53,464
...better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

34
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:56,568
lf this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

35
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:59,070
...l need to know what's in that safe.

36
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:02,708
ln order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

37
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:10,217
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as l consider your proposal.

38
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:13,718
He knows.

39
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:18,222
What's going on up there?

40
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,082
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

41
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,818
Doesn't matter. l can get it here.
Trust me.

42
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,485
The information is in the safe.

43
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:21,822
He looked right at it
when l mentioned secrets.

44
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,224
What's she doing here?

45
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:30,031
Just head back to the room.
All right? l'll take care of this.

46
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,233
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

47
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:45,348
lf l jumped, would l survive?

48
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:50,118
With a clean dive, perhaps.

49
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:51,952
Mal, what are you doing here?

50
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,322
l thought you might be missing me.

51
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,756
You know that l am.

52
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,795
But l can't trust you anymore.

53
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,896
So what?

54
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:05,667
Looks like Arthur's taste.

55
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,472
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

56
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,874
Please, have a seat.

57
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:22,050
Tell me...

58
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,018
...do the children miss me?

59
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,058
You can't imagine.

60
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,330
What are you doing?

61
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,031
Just getting some fresh air.

62
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,200
Stay where you are, Mal.

63
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,751
Goddamn it.

64
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,181
Turn around.

65
00:07:58,348 --> 00:07:59,384
The gun, Dom.

66
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:09,794
Please.

67
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:24,276
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

68
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:28,082
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?

69
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:33,487
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

70
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:39,993
l want to know the name
of your employer.

71
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:45,867
Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?

72
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,501
That depends
on what you're threatening.

73
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:51,571
Killing him would just wake him up.

74
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:53,505
But pain....

75
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:59,344
Pain is in the mind.

76
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:04,253
And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

77
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,767
-What are you doing? It's too soon.
-But the dream's collapsing.

78
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:22,370
l'm gonna try to keep Saito under
a little bit longer. We're almost there.

79
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:40,555
He was close. Very close.

80
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:56,437
Stop him!

81
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:24,433
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

82
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,191
He won't wake.

83
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:52,962
-Give him the kick.
What?

84
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:54,529
Dunk him.

85
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,444
He's out.

86
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,817
You came prepared, hmm?

87
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:51,825
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

88
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:56,197
lt's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

89
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,897
...particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

90
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:01,033
-She would never....
-Yet here we are.

91
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,203
-With a dilemma.
-They're getting closer.

92
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:07,140
-You got what you came for.
Well, that's not true.

93
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:09,976
You left out a key piece of information,
didn't you?

94
00:12:10,141 --> 00:12:13,346
You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.

95
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,382
-Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
-An audition.

96
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:20,521
-An audition for what?
-Doesn't matter. You failed.

97
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:23,389
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

98
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:26,091
But your deception was obvious.

99
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:11,407
-So leave me and go.
-You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

100
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,811
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

101
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:18,112
We won't last two days.

102
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:21,248
Cobb?

103
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:24,554
Looks like l'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

104
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:28,490
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

105
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:34,729
l've always hated this carpet.

106
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:39,269
lt's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

107
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:44,106
But very definitely made of wool.

108
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:46,640
Right now...

109
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:50,112
...l'm lying on polyester.

110
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,822
Which means l'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

111
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:02,959
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.

112
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:05,428
l'm still dreaming.

113
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,936
-How'd it go?
-Not good.

114
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,448
Dream within a dream, huh?
l'm impressed.

115
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:28,219
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

116
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:30,653
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito....

117
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:32,221
We're not in your dream.

118
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:33,955
We're in mine.

119
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:46,001
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?

120
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:48,472
-lt wasn't my fault.
-You're the architect.

121
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,774
l didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

122
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:52,040
That's enough.

123
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,677
You. What the hell was all that?

124
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:58,049
-l have it under control.
-l'd hate to see you out of control.

125
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:01,986
We don't have time for this.
l'm getting off at Kyoto.

126
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,987
He's not gonna check every compartment.

127
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,788
Yeah, well, l don't like trains.

128
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:08,726
Listen. Every man for himself.

129
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,102
Yes, hello?

130
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:26,906
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Dad.

131
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:31,045
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?

132
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,446
Good.
Okay, l guess.

133
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:37,353
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

134
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:41,423
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?

135
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,061
Well, l can't, sweetheart. l can't.
Not for a while, remember?

136
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:48,560
Why?

137
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:54,472
Look, l told you, l'm away
because l'm working, right?

138
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:57,605
Grandma says you're never coming back.

139
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:00,173
Phillipa, is that you?

140
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,477
Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?

141
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:05,346
She's shaking her head.

142
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:09,984
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

143
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,052
Daddy?

144
00:17:12,752 --> 00:17:13,787
Yeah, James?

145
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:15,622
Is Mommy with you?

146
00:17:18,258 --> 00:17:20,461
James, we talked about this.

147
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:24,098
Mommy's not here anymore.

148
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:26,400
Where?

149
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,772
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

150
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:33,976
Listen, l'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?

151
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:35,174
And you be good, you be

152
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,890
-Our ride's on the roof.
-Right.

153
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,230
Hey, are you okay?

154
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:58,268
Yeah. Yeah, l'm fine. Why?

155
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:00,869
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.

156
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:04,274
Look, l'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

157
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:08,045
-lt's getting worse, isn't it?
-One apology's all you're getting, all right?

158
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,680
-Where's Nash?
-He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

159
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:13,317
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

160
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:15,250
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.

161
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,655
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

162
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:21,691
-Where you gonna go?
-Buenos Aires.

163
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:26,130
l can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

164
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:27,496
Stateside.

165
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:29,197
Send my regards.

166
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:39,109
He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.

167
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:43,078
So l offer you the satisfaction.

168
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,554
lt's not the way l deal with things.

169
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:04,702
-What will you do with him?
-Nothing.

170
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:07,604
But l can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

171
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:25,122
-What do you want from us?
-lnception.

172
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:29,127
-ls it possible?
-Of course not.

173
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,496
lf you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

174
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,531
...why can't you plant one there instead?

175
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,800
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

176
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:39,272
l say, ''Don't think about elephants.''
What are you thinking about?

177
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:40,472
Elephants.

178
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,809
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know l gave it to you.

179
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,980
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

180
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:50,349
-True inspiration's impossible to fake.
-That's not true.

181
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:55,989
-Can you do it?
-Are you offering me a choice?

182
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:58,824
Because l can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.

183
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,026
Then you do have a choice.

184
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:02,961
Then l choose to leave, sir.

185
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:09,568
Tell the crew where you want to go.

186
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,908
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

187
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:21,146
How would you like to go home?

188
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:25,253
To America. To your children.

189
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:29,023
You can't fix that. No one can.

190
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,427
-Just like inception.
-Cobb, come on.

191
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,065
-How complex is the idea?
-Simple enough.

192
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,771
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

193
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:46,674
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

194
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:50,613
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

195
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:55,084
l need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

196
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:58,453
-Cobb, we should walk away from this.
-Hold on.

197
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,792
lf l were to do this,
if l even could do it...

198
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:05,859
...l'd need a guarantee.

199
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:09,298
-How do l know you can deliver?
-You don't.

200
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:11,366
But l can.

201
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:16,540
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

202
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:20,811
...or become an old man,
filled with regret...

203
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:23,579
...waiting to die alone?

204
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:30,955
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

205
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,896
Look, l know how much
you wanna go home.

206
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:45,433
This can't be done.

207
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,872
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

208
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,605
You don't know that.

209
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:53,776
l've done it before.

210
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:56,144
Who'd you do it to?

211
00:22:01,381 --> 00:22:03,384
Why are we going to Paris?

212
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:06,689
We're gonna need a new architect.

213
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:25,676
You never did like your office, did you?

214
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:30,513
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

215
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:34,618
ls it safe for you to be here?

216
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:38,255
Extradition between France
and the United States...

217
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:40,657
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

218
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:43,562
l think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

219
00:22:43,726 --> 00:22:48,234
Look, l, uh, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

220
00:22:48,396 --> 00:22:51,001
lt'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

221
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:54,139
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

222
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:57,141
l'm just doing what l know.
l'm doing what you taught me.

223
00:22:57,305 --> 00:22:58,841
l never taught you to be a thief.

224
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:01,213
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

225
00:23:01,377 --> 00:23:02,680
But after what happened...

226
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:06,419
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

227
00:23:11,553 --> 00:23:13,056
What are you doing here, Dom?

228
00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:17,562
l think l found a way home.

229
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:21,300
lt's a job
for some very, very powerful people.

230
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,939
People who l believe can fix
my charges permanently.

231
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:28,004
But l need your help.

232
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:32,012
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

233
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:35,080
You know what l'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

234
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:36,715
-Money.
-Not just money.

235
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,216
You remember.

236
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:41,621
lt's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

237
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,555
...things that never existed...

238
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,926
...things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

239
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,267
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

240
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:54,399
They don't actually come into the dream.

241
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:57,838
They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

242
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,238
Design it yourself.

243
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:03,408
Mal won't let me.

244
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:11,751
Come back to reality, Dom.

245
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,657
-Please.
-Reality.

246
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,558
Those kids, your grandchildren...

247
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:22,731
...they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.

248
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:26,100
And this job, this last job,
that's how l get there.

249
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,270
l would not be standing here
if l knew any other way.

250
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:36,343
l need an architect
who's as good as l was.

251
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:42,547
l've got somebody better.

252
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:43,750
Ariadne?

253
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:48,890
l'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

254
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,390
Pleased to meet you.

255
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:55,231
lf you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

256
00:24:55,395 --> 00:24:56,430
A work placement?

257
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,131
Not exactly.

258
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,632
l have a test for you.

259
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,437
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

260
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:05,239
Before l describe the job,
l have to know you can do it.

261
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:08,611
-Why?
-lt's not, strictly speaking, legal.

262
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:16,387
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

263
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:19,452
Stop.

264
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:23,091
Again.

265
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:26,560
Stop.

266
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,800
You're gonna have to do better than that.

267
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:46,080
That's more like it.

268
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:09,172
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.

269
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:11,040
Now, that's when we're awake.

270
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:14,178
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

271
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:15,377
Such as?

272
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:19,550
lmagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

273
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:23,554
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what l mean.

274
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:25,688
Yeah, like l'm discovering it.

275
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:28,125
Genuine inspiration, right?

276
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,629
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

277
00:26:31,794 --> 00:26:36,435
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

278
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:40,005
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

279
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:42,908
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

280
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,444
-How?
-By taking over the creating part.

281
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:47,243
Now, this is where l need you.

282
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,780
You create the world of the dream.

283
00:26:49,945 --> 00:26:55,323
We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

284
00:26:55,485 --> 00:27:00,160
How could l ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

285
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:03,796
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

286
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,666
lt's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

287
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:10,534
Let me ask you a question.

288
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:14,106
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

289
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:17,310
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

290
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:18,509
l guess, yeah.

291
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:20,244
So how did we end up here?

292
00:27:20,643 --> 00:27:22,714
Well, we just came from the, uh....

293
00:27:22,914 --> 00:27:26,352
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

294
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,853
Where are you right now?

295
00:27:32,156 --> 00:27:33,324
We're dreaming?

296
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:35,929
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.

297
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:39,064
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

298
00:28:16,401 --> 00:28:18,538
lf it's just a dream,
then why are you?

299
00:28:20,172 --> 00:28:21,909
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

300
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:25,380
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

301
00:28:25,544 --> 00:28:27,749
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

302
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:31,619
lt was a training program for soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

303
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:32,918
...and then wake up.

304
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:35,021
How did architects become involved?

305
00:28:35,187 --> 00:28:37,927
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

306
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:41,395
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

307
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:42,663
Five minutes?

308
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:46,367
What ? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.

309
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:48,769
ln a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

310
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,773
...therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

311
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:55,312
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

312
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:59,114
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

313
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:07,958
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, café.

314
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,790
Almost everything else is here too.

315
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,895
Who are the people?
-Projections of my subconscious.

316
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,228
-Yours?
-Yes.

317
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:16,932
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

318
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:19,768
l am the subject. My mind populates it.

319
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:21,835
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

320
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:24,906
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

321
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:26,340
How else do you do it?

322
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,514
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

323
00:29:30,678 --> 00:29:34,419
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

324
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:37,353
-You understand?
-Then you break in and steal it?

325
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:38,553
Well....

326
00:29:38,718 --> 00:29:43,228
l guess l thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...

327
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:45,261
...but it's more about the feel of it.

328
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:49,867
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

329
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:32,776
lt's something, isn't it?

330
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,178
Yes, it is.

331
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:00,637
Why are they all looking at me?

332
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:04,311
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

333
00:31:04,474 --> 00:31:08,782
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

334
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:10,012
Converge?

335
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,250
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

336
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:15,088
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

337
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:18,091
-What, they're gonna attack us?
-No, no.

338
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,225
Just you.

339
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:28,402
This is great, but l'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this....

340
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:34,874
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

341
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,710
lt's my subconscious.
Remember? l can't control it.

342
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:32,733
Very impressive.

343
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:48,016
l know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

344
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,518
Yeah, l cross it every day
to get to the college.

345
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:54,122
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.

346
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:56,124
You draw from stuff you know, right?

347
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,497
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

348
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,797
-Why not?
-Building a dream from your memory...

349
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:06,469
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

350
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:08,704
-ls that what happened to you?
-Listen to me.

351
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:10,872
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

352
00:33:11,037 --> 00:33:13,007
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

353
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,710
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.

354
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,512
-Cobb! Cobb!
-Get off of her!

355
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:19,615
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Mal!

356
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:22,218
-Mal!
-Cobb! Wake me up!

357
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:24,186
-Wake me up! Wake me up!
-No!

358
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:25,854
-Mal, no! No!
-Wake me up!

359
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:31,462
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

360
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,865
-Hey.
-Why wouldn't l wake up?

361
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:36,765
There was still time on the clock.

362
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:39,469
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

363
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,236
-She'll need a totem.
What?

364
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:42,872
A totem, it's a small personal

365
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:45,575
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

366
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,577
-She's a real charmer.
-Oh.

367
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:50,380
-l see you met Mrs. Cobb.
-She's his wife?

368
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:54,286
Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.

369
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,920
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

370
00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:58,353
Like a coin?
No.

371
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,162
lt needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.

372
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,163
No, l can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

373
00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:11,538
See, only l know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

374
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:13,538
That way,
when you look at your totem...

375
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:16,809
...you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

376
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:24,550
l don't know if you can't see what's
going on, or if you just don't want to...

377
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:28,253
...but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

378
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:32,358
And l'm not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.

379
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:41,901
She'll be back. l've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

380
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:46,573
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,
and when she comes back....

381
00:34:47,236 --> 00:34:49,908
When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.

382
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:52,343
-Where are you gonna be?
-l gotta go visit Eames.

383
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:55,648
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

384
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:57,415
lt's a necessary risk.

385
00:34:57,814 --> 00:35:01,053
-Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
-We don't just need a thief.

386
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:03,219
We need a forger.

387
00:35:11,928 --> 00:35:14,500
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

388
00:35:15,065 --> 00:35:16,100
You never know.

389
00:35:17,035 --> 00:35:19,072
l'm gonna get you a drink.

390
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:22,607
You're buying.

391
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:31,384
-Your spelling hasn't improved.
-Piss off.

392
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:33,520
How's your handwriting?

393
00:35:33,685 --> 00:35:35,521
-lt's versatile.
-Good.

394
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:36,921
Thank you very much.

395
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:38,957
lnception.

396
00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:42,028
Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me

397
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:45,500
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

398
00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:48,935
lnteresting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

399
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:52,339
Hmm. Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

400
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,206
He is good at what he does, right?

401
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:56,443
Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.

402
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:57,643
Not like you.

403
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,781
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.

404
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:04,520
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

405
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:08,322
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.

406
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:11,827
-You didn't plant it deep enough?
-No, it's not just about depth.

407
00:36:11,991 --> 00:36:13,993
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

408
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:17,832
...in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

409
00:36:17,996 --> 00:36:20,535
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

410
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,908
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

411
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:27,508
Right there you have
various political motivations...

412
00:36:27,673 --> 00:36:29,677
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

413
00:36:29,843 --> 00:36:31,680
But all of that stuff, it's, um....

414
00:36:31,845 --> 00:36:34,717
lt's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

415
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:37,385
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

416
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,120
Which is what?

417
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:41,522
The relationship with the father.

418
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,392
-Do you have a chemist?
-No, not yet.

419
00:36:45,558 --> 00:36:48,631
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

420
00:36:48,796 --> 00:36:52,234
He, uh, formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

421
00:36:52,397 --> 00:36:53,700
Why don't you take me there?

422
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:56,939
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.

423
00:36:57,104 --> 00:36:58,574
Cobol Engineering.

424
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:01,076
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

425
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:03,779
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

426
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:07,584
Run interference. l'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?

427
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:09,751
-Back here?
-This is the last place they'd suspect.

428
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:13,621
All right.

429
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:16,626
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

430
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,259
My God, it's you, isn't it?

431
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:22,863
No, it isn't you.

432
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,466
Not dreaming now, are you?

433
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:28,270
Get him!

434
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:44,920
There!

435
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:07,177
One cafe.

436
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:12,682
Shh.

437
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,790
One cafe.

438
00:38:20,824 --> 00:38:22,292
One cafe.

439
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:18,350
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

440
00:39:19,951 --> 00:39:24,059
-What are you doing in Mombasa?
-l'm here to protect my investment.

441
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:29,495
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

442
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:30,696
Different tail.

443
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:41,140
Cobb said you'd be back.

444
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:45,814
-l tried not to come, but....
-But there's nothing quite like it.

445
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:47,648
lt's just...

446
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:50,483
...pure creation.

447
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:53,152
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

448
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:55,322
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

449
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:59,026
...if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.

450
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:00,627
What kind of tricks?

451
00:40:00,793 --> 00:40:04,300
ln a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

452
00:40:04,463 --> 00:40:08,369
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

453
00:40:09,234 --> 00:40:11,237
The infinite staircase.

454
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,375
See?

455
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:20,612
Paradox.

456
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:22,182
So a closed loop like that...

457
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:25,455
...will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

458
00:40:25,617 --> 00:40:27,587
But how big do these levels have to be?

459
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:30,894
lt could be anything
from the floor of a building to an entire city.

460
00:40:31,058 --> 00:40:34,496
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

461
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:36,063
-A maze?
-Right, a maze.

462
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:37,564
And the better the maze....

463
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:40,436
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

464
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,869
Exactly.

465
00:40:42,535 --> 00:40:46,174
-My subconscious seems polite enough.
-Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

466
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:49,244
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

467
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,513
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

468
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:55,184
l don't know if he can't, but he won't.

469
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:57,753
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

470
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,020
Why?

471
00:40:59,186 --> 00:41:01,423
He won't tell me. But l think it's Mal.

472
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:04,160
-His ex-wife?
-No, not his ex.

473
00:41:04,325 --> 00:41:07,497
-They're still together?
-No.

474
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,231
No, she's dead.

475
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:14,938
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

476
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:19,942
What was she like in real life?

477
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:22,144
She was lovely.

478
00:41:25,846 --> 00:41:28,218
You are seeking a chemist?
Yes.

479
00:41:28,383 --> 00:41:30,520
To formulate compounds for a job?

480
00:41:31,186 --> 00:41:33,056
And to go into the field with us.

481
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:35,458
No, l rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

482
00:41:35,622 --> 00:41:39,364
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

483
00:41:39,527 --> 00:41:41,631
-Which are?
-Great depth.

484
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:45,069
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

485
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:48,871
Three.

486
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:52,610
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

487
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:56,749
lt is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

488
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:59,584
A powerful sedative.

489
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:03,620
-How many team members?
-Five.

490
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:05,522
Six.

491
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:10,430
The only way to know you've done the job
is if l go in with you.

492
00:42:10,592 --> 00:42:13,699
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

493
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,234
This time, it seems there is.

494
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:20,907
This, l think, is a good place to start.
l use it every day.

495
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,208
What for?
-Here, l'll show you.

496
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:29,246
Perhaps you will not want to see.

497
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,785
After you.

498
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:46,098
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.

499
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,033
They come every day to share the dream.

500
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,639
You see? Very stable.

501
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:03,418
-How long do they dream for?
Three, four hours, each day.

502
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,715
ln dream time?

503
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:08,555
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

504
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:12,026
-Why do they do it?
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

505
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,995
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

506
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,097
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

507
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:22,136
-They come here every day to sleep?
No.

508
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:26,572
They come to be woken up.

509
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:30,879
The dream has become their reality.

510
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:34,180
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

511
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:38,118
Let's see what you can do.

512
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:50,696
You know how to find me.

513
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:55,302
You know what you have to do.

514
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:01,607
Sharp, no?

515
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,029
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

516
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,334
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

517
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:36,478
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy conglomerate.

518
00:44:36,642 --> 00:44:38,545
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

519
00:44:38,711 --> 00:44:40,314
That's not your concern.

520
00:44:40,713 --> 00:44:45,090
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

521
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:46,854
You asked me for inception.

522
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:50,393
l do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

523
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:54,532
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

524
00:44:54,694 --> 00:44:56,564
This idea will define him.

525
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,567
lt may come to change....

526
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:01,038
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

527
00:45:01,203 --> 00:45:05,543
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

528
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:07,775
And we can no longer compete.

529
00:45:07,942 --> 00:45:11,416
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

530
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,952
ln effect, they become
a new superpower.

531
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:18,688
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

532
00:45:18,852 --> 00:45:20,423
That's where we come in.

533
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:23,861
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

534
00:45:24,026 --> 00:45:26,764
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

535
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:29,432
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

536
00:45:29,598 --> 00:45:32,804
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

537
00:45:32,968 --> 00:45:37,142
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

538
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:40,577
lt should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

539
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:45,217
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

540
00:45:45,846 --> 00:45:48,786
l'm not smelling
settlement here. Take them down.

541
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,053
Mr. Browning...

542
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:54,059
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

543
00:45:56,626 --> 00:46:01,102
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

544
00:46:01,264 --> 00:46:02,666
Not sure that's necessary.

545
00:46:02,831 --> 00:46:05,504
No, no, no. l think we should.

546
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:28,359
How is he?

547
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:31,963
l don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but

548
00:46:32,128 --> 00:46:37,606
Robert, l told you keep out
the damn - Wait. So do it. Get

549
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:40,973
Mr. Fischer.
Put it through.

550
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:44,944
Never, never.
Never do the same as l asked.

551
00:46:46,243 --> 00:46:47,912
Leave that.

552
00:46:51,615 --> 00:46:52,985
Here.

553
00:46:55,253 --> 00:46:57,656
Must be a cherished memory of his.

554
00:46:58,756 --> 00:47:03,299
l put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

555
00:47:03,461 --> 00:47:05,131
Robert...

556
00:47:07,499 --> 00:47:09,903
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

557
00:47:10,068 --> 00:47:13,374
-l know this is hard, but it's imperative
-Not now, Uncle Peter.

558
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:19,178
The vultures are circling.

559
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:23,752
And the sicker Maurice fischer becomes,
the more powemul Peter Browning becomes.

560
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:26,319
l've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

561
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:31,327
...and adopt his physical presence, study his
mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

562
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,364
So now in the first layer of the dream,
l can impersonate Browning.

563
00:47:35,528 --> 00:47:38,767
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

564
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,767
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

565
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:44,439
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

566
00:47:44,603 --> 00:47:46,540
So he gives himself the idea.

567
00:47:46,705 --> 00:47:50,946
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

568
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,516
Eames, l am impressed.

569
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,255
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

570
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:21,609
Were you going under on your own?

571
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:25,283
No, no, l was just, uh, running
some experiments.

572
00:48:25,446 --> 00:48:27,416
l didn't realize anyone was here, so....

573
00:48:27,582 --> 00:48:30,253
Yeah, l was just
l was working on my totem, actually.

574
00:48:30,417 --> 00:48:31,585
Here, let me take a look.

575
00:48:33,753 --> 00:48:35,056
So you're learning, huh?

576
00:48:35,223 --> 00:48:38,729
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

577
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,763
-Was it your idea?
-No, it was, uh....

578
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:44,065
lt was Mal's, actually. This....

579
00:48:44,765 --> 00:48:48,539
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

580
00:48:48,736 --> 00:48:51,641
Just spin and spin.

581
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:55,110
Arthur told me she passed away.

582
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,080
How are the mazes coming along?

583
00:48:59,247 --> 00:49:02,152
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

584
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:03,786
...that we are trying to access.

585
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:09,394
So l'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

586
00:49:09,757 --> 00:49:12,530
You know, l- Actually, l have a question
about this layout.

587
00:49:12,694 --> 00:49:17,437
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

588
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,767
Why is that so important?

589
00:49:18,933 --> 00:49:20,936
ln case one of us brings in
our projections.

590
00:49:21,102 --> 00:49:23,440
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

591
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,312
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

592
00:49:27,476 --> 00:49:29,880
You can't keep her out, can you?

593
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,315
-Right.
-You can't build...

594
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:35,787
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

595
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,154
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

596
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,125
-Cobb, do the others know?
-No. No, they don't.

597
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,528
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

598
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:45,629
No one said it's getting worse.

599
00:49:46,828 --> 00:49:50,135
l need to get home.
That's all l care about right now.

600
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:53,069
Why can't you go home?

601
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:58,208
Because they think l killed her.

602
00:50:01,444 --> 00:50:03,714
-Thank you.
-For what?

603
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:06,183
For not asking whether l did.

604
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:08,520
''l will split up my father's empire.''

605
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:12,893
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

606
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:15,860
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

607
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:19,565
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

608
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:23,504
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

609
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:26,104
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

610
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:29,876
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

611
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:32,778
-...is stressed, to say the least.
-Can we run with that?

612
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:36,550
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a ''screw you'' to the old man.

613
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:40,187
No, because l think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

614
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:44,292
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

615
00:50:44,456 --> 00:50:48,229
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

616
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:50,228
All right, well, try this. Um....

617
00:50:50,394 --> 00:50:55,137
''My father accepts that l want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps.''

618
00:50:55,533 --> 00:50:56,601
That might work.

619
00:50:56,768 --> 00:50:59,940
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than ''might.''

620
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:02,074
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

621
00:51:02,238 --> 00:51:05,178
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

622
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:06,479
Specificity?

623
00:51:06,644 --> 00:51:08,481
lnception's not about being specific.

624
00:51:08,646 --> 00:51:12,621
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

625
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:16,923
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

626
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:20,159
...and say, ''l will not follow
in my father's footsteps.''

627
00:51:20,325 --> 00:51:25,001
Then the next level down, we feed him,
''l will create something for myself.''

628
00:51:25,163 --> 00:51:28,502
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

629
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:31,071
-''My father doesn't want me to be him.''
Exactly.

630
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:36,445
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

631
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:37,777
Sedation.

632
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:40,783
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

633
00:51:40,946 --> 00:51:44,853
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

634
00:51:56,294 --> 00:51:57,363
Good night.

635
00:51:57,963 --> 00:52:00,168
The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

636
00:52:00,332 --> 00:52:02,269
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

637
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:06,676
-...whilst accelerating brain function.
-ln other words, more time on each level.

638
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:10,012
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

639
00:52:10,176 --> 00:52:13,683
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

640
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:15,951
lt's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20

641
00:52:16,115 --> 00:52:19,021
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

642
00:52:19,186 --> 00:52:21,857
lt's a week, the first level down.

643
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,395
Six months the second level down,
and the third level

644
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,995
That's 10 years.

645
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,800
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

646
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:33,366
Depends on the dream.

647
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:35,838
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

648
00:52:36,003 --> 00:52:39,342
l'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

649
00:52:39,507 --> 00:52:42,278
-A kick.
-What's a kick?

650
00:52:42,443 --> 00:52:45,148
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

651
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,985
lt's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

652
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:53,389
-Snaps you out of the dream.
-We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

653
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:54,757
That's the clever part.

654
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:58,161
l customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

655
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:03,168
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

656
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,703
Or tipping.

657
00:53:06,334 --> 00:53:10,509
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

658
00:53:11,038 --> 00:53:14,579
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

659
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:25,957
He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.

660
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:28,124
Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?

661
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:31,529
Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need

662
00:53:31,694 --> 00:53:33,631
We need at least a good 10 hours.

663
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,131
Sydney to Los Angeles.

664
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:40,739
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

665
00:53:40,904 --> 00:53:43,074
He must be flying private, then.

666
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:46,745
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

667
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:49,147
It would have to be a 141.
-Why's that?

668
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:50,781
On a 141, the pilot's up top...

669
00:53:50,947 --> 00:53:54,153
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

670
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:57,823
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

671
00:53:57,987 --> 00:53:59,558
l bought the airline.

672
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,927
lt seemed neater.

673
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:07,331
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

674
00:54:07,997 --> 00:54:11,137
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

675
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,320
You know how to find me.

676
00:55:02,787 --> 00:55:04,222
You know what you have to do.

677
00:55:08,059 --> 00:55:11,532
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

678
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:14,434
Of course l do.

679
00:55:15,533 --> 00:55:18,038
You said you had a dream.

680
00:55:20,972 --> 00:55:23,745
That we'd grow old together.

681
00:55:25,177 --> 00:55:26,880
And we can.

682
00:55:33,551 --> 00:55:35,488
You shouldn't be here.

683
00:55:39,258 --> 00:55:42,733
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

684
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:46,101
-This has nothing to do with you.
-This has everything to do with me.

685
00:55:46,265 --> 00:55:52,077
-You've asked me to share dreams with you.
-Not these. These are my dreams.

686
00:56:02,949 --> 00:56:05,353
Why do you do this to yourself?

687
00:56:05,518 --> 00:56:08,457
lt's the only way l can still dream.

688
00:56:10,224 --> 00:56:12,427
Why is it so important to dream?

689
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:15,597
ln my dreams, we're still together.

690
00:56:29,944 --> 00:56:31,681
These aren't just dreams.

691
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,519
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

692
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,752
l know l did.

693
00:56:38,385 --> 00:56:42,927
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.

694
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:46,096
You don't understand.
These are moments l regret.

695
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,833
They're memories that l have to change.

696
00:56:50,064 --> 00:56:52,535
Well, what's down there that you regret?

697
00:56:52,934 --> 00:56:56,074
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

698
00:57:04,544 --> 00:57:06,148
This is your house?

699
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,286
Mine and Mal's, yes.

700
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,153
Where is she?

701
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,823
She's already gone.

702
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,095
That's my son, James.

703
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:23,368
He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.

704
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:25,869
That's Phillipa.

705
00:57:26,403 --> 00:57:28,273
l thought about calling out to them...

706
00:57:28,437 --> 00:57:31,208
...so they'd turn and smile
and l could see...

707
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:37,051
...those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.

708
00:57:37,213 --> 00:57:40,052
Right now or never, Cobb.

709
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,323
Then l start to panic.

710
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:49,193
l realize l'm gonna regret this moment...

711
00:57:50,026 --> 00:57:52,364
...that l need to see their faces
one last time.

712
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:55,033
James! Phillipa! Come on in!

713
00:57:55,198 --> 00:57:57,235
But the moment's past.

714
00:57:59,436 --> 00:58:02,811
And whatever l do,
l can't change this moment.

715
00:58:03,706 --> 00:58:05,877
As l'm about to call out to them...

716
00:58:06,911 --> 00:58:08,012
...they run away.

717
00:58:10,748 --> 00:58:14,020
lf l'm ever gonna see their faces again,
l've gotta get back home.

718
00:58:15,052 --> 00:58:16,554
The real world.

719
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,598
What are you doing here?

720
00:59:00,432 --> 00:59:01,534
My name is

721
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:05,006
l know who you are.
What are you doing here?

722
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:15,616
l'm just trying to understand.

723
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,918
How could you understand?

724
00:59:19,118 --> 00:59:21,255
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

725
00:59:23,256 --> 00:59:25,393
To be half of a whole?

726
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,195
No.

727
00:59:29,661 --> 00:59:31,664
l'll tell you a riddle.

728
00:59:33,132 --> 00:59:35,437
You're waiting for a train.

729
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:39,641
A train that will take you far away.

730
00:59:41,007 --> 00:59:43,980
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

731
00:59:45,012 --> 00:59:47,282
...but you don't know for sure.

732
00:59:47,447 --> 00:59:49,350
But it doesn't matter.

733
00:59:50,316 --> 00:59:53,723
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

734
00:59:53,887 --> 00:59:55,656
Because you'll be together.

735
00:59:56,689 --> 00:59:59,795
How could you bring her here, Dom?
-What is this place?

736
01:00:00,193 --> 01:00:03,365
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

737
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,866
What happened here?

738
01:00:06,766 --> 01:00:09,605
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

739
01:00:10,037 --> 01:00:12,108
Please, l need you to stay here
just for now!

740
01:00:12,273 --> 01:00:15,512
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

741
01:00:15,676 --> 01:00:18,147
l'll come back for you. l promise.

742
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:41,741
Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?

743
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:44,741
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

744
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:46,908
It's time.

745
01:00:48,142 --> 01:00:50,480
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

746
01:00:50,645 --> 01:00:52,815
-When's the funeral?
-Thursday. In Los Angeles.

747
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:56,253
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

748
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:57,887
All right.

749
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:01,526
-Cobb, l'm coming with you.
-l promised Miles. No.

750
01:01:01,689 --> 01:01:04,828
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

751
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,566
And it doesn't have to be me...

752
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:13,038
...but then you have to show Arthur
what l just saw.

753
01:01:18,807 --> 01:01:20,509
Get us another seat on the plane.

754
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,620
If l get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...

755
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:31,457
...when we land,
l go to jail for the rest of my life.

756
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:34,325
Complete the job en route...

757
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,963
...l make one phone call from the plane...

758
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:40,032
...you have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

759
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:56,282
-l'm sorry.
-Oh, yeah, absolutely.

760
01:01:56,447 --> 01:01:58,017
Thank you.

761
01:02:31,616 --> 01:02:34,922
Excuse me, l think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

762
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:36,989
Would you care for a drink?

763
01:02:37,155 --> 01:02:38,456
Oh. Water, please.

764
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:40,927
Oh, um, same, please.

765
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:43,195
Um....

766
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:45,031
Thank you.

767
01:02:45,197 --> 01:02:47,067
You know, l couldn't help but notice...

768
01:02:47,232 --> 01:02:50,838
...but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

769
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:52,504
Yes, he, um....

770
01:02:53,438 --> 01:02:55,441
He was my father.

771
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:59,915
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
l'm sorry for your loss.

772
01:03:02,881 --> 01:03:04,550
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

773
01:03:04,716 --> 01:03:06,052
Hey.

774
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:08,088
To your father.

775
01:03:08,688 --> 01:03:10,925
May he rest in peace, huh?

776
01:04:19,394 --> 01:04:21,697
-Couldn't have peed before you went under?
-Sorry.

777
01:04:21,861 --> 01:04:23,932
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

778
01:04:24,097 --> 01:04:25,200
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

779
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:28,338
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi
in this weather.

780
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:44,055
-Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try?
-Walk away.

781
01:04:59,934 --> 01:05:01,337
Just have him ca - l gotta go.

782
01:05:01,503 --> 01:05:03,640
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

783
01:05:06,575 --> 01:05:09,448
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.

784
01:05:10,012 --> 01:05:12,349
-What are you doing?
-Sorry, l thought it was free.

785
01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:14,016
-lt's not.
-Maybe we could share.

786
01:05:14,183 --> 01:05:17,021
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this?

787
01:05:19,989 --> 01:05:21,325
Great.

788
01:05:26,262 --> 01:05:27,732
Come on.

789
01:05:38,842 --> 01:05:41,480
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.

790
01:05:41,645 --> 01:05:43,348
You might at least
drop me at my stop.

791
01:05:43,513 --> 01:05:44,615
l'm afraid that it doesn't

792
01:05:54,324 --> 01:05:56,127
-Cover him!
Down! Down now!

793
01:05:56,294 --> 01:05:57,929
What the hell is going on?

794
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,902
This wasn't in the design.

795
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:06,204
Cobb?

796
01:06:06,437 --> 01:06:07,472
Cobb?

797
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,592
Get him!

798
01:07:06,264 --> 01:07:07,700
Are you all right?

799
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,070
Yeah, l'm okay. l'm okay.

800
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,138
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

801
01:07:12,305 --> 01:07:13,540
Saito?

802
01:07:32,459 --> 01:07:34,595
Get Fischer in the back room now.

803
01:07:34,894 --> 01:07:37,600
-Get him in the back room. Move.
What the hell happened?

804
01:07:38,032 --> 01:07:39,502
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

805
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:41,403
l don't know.
-Jesus Christ.

806
01:07:41,568 --> 01:07:44,005
What happened to you?
-Blocked by a freight train.

807
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,140
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

808
01:07:46,305 --> 01:07:47,908
-l didn't.
Where'd it come from?

809
01:07:48,074 --> 01:07:49,744
Why the hell were we ambushed?

810
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:53,316
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

811
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,052
-How could he be trained?
-Fischer's had an extractor...

812
01:07:56,216 --> 01:08:00,424
...teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.

813
01:08:00,587 --> 01:08:02,222
lt should've shown in the research.

814
01:08:02,389 --> 01:08:04,191
Why the hell didn't it?
-Calm down.

815
01:08:04,358 --> 01:08:05,694
Don't tell me to calm down!

816
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,799
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

817
01:08:08,963 --> 01:08:11,033
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

818
01:08:11,198 --> 01:08:14,538
-We are not prepared for this!
-We have dealt with sub-security before!

819
01:08:14,702 --> 01:08:16,806
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

820
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:18,774
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

821
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:20,008
Put him out his misery.

822
01:08:20,174 --> 01:08:23,013
-No, don't do that! Don't do that.
-Cobb, hey, hey.

823
01:08:23,177 --> 01:08:25,282
He's in agony. l'm waking him up.

824
01:08:25,447 --> 01:08:27,349
No. It won't wake him up.

825
01:08:27,515 --> 01:08:31,121
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

826
01:08:31,285 --> 01:08:32,554
Not from this.

827
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,258
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

828
01:08:35,858 --> 01:08:37,561
Right. So, what happens when we die?

829
01:08:37,726 --> 01:08:39,562
-We drop into limbo.
-Are you serious?

830
01:08:39,727 --> 01:08:42,264
-Limbo?
Unconstructed dream space.

831
01:08:42,431 --> 01:08:45,703
Well, what the hell is down there?
-Just raw, infinite subconscious.

832
01:08:45,868 --> 01:08:49,074
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

833
01:08:49,237 --> 01:08:52,142
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

834
01:08:52,307 --> 01:08:54,210
Which, in our case, is just you.

835
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:57,080
-How long could we be stuck?
Can't even think about...

836
01:08:57,245 --> 01:08:59,650
-...trying to escape until the sedation
-How long?

837
01:08:59,815 --> 01:09:03,055
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

838
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:04,421
Let's get him upstairs.

839
01:09:06,055 --> 01:09:07,491
Great.

840
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:09,960
Thank you.

841
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,899
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

842
01:09:14,064 --> 01:09:15,534
And if we get killed...

843
01:09:15,699 --> 01:09:18,937
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

844
01:09:25,842 --> 01:09:27,679
Someone got first aid?

845
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:33,419
-You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
-There weren't meant to be risks.

846
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:36,522
-l didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
-You had no right.

847
01:09:36,686 --> 01:09:39,024
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

848
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:41,226
You knew about this
and went along with it?

849
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:42,426
l trusted him.

850
01:09:42,593 --> 01:09:44,495
When? When he promised you
half his share?

851
01:09:44,661 --> 01:09:47,934
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

852
01:09:48,099 --> 01:09:50,169
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

853
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,773
That has nothing to do with it.
l did what l had to to get to my children.

854
01:09:53,938 --> 01:09:55,840
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

855
01:09:56,006 --> 01:10:00,048
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

856
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:02,548
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

857
01:10:02,713 --> 01:10:05,184
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

858
01:10:05,348 --> 01:10:07,219
l am sitting this one out on this level.

859
01:10:07,385 --> 01:10:09,822
Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

860
01:10:09,987 --> 01:10:12,257
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

861
01:10:12,422 --> 01:10:16,164
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That l can guarantee you.

862
01:10:16,762 --> 01:10:20,536
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

863
01:10:22,133 --> 01:10:24,572
Downwards is the only way forwards.

864
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,273
Get ready.

865
01:10:27,438 --> 01:10:29,643
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

866
01:10:34,478 --> 01:10:37,518
l'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

867
01:10:37,683 --> 01:10:40,622
-This should be very simple.
Shut up! It won't be.

868
01:10:40,786 --> 01:10:43,056
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

869
01:10:43,223 --> 01:10:45,293
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

870
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,060
l don't know any safe.

871
01:10:48,259 --> 01:10:51,131
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

872
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:54,100
Tell us what it is.

873
01:10:54,968 --> 01:10:56,705
l don't know.

874
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,778
We have it on good authority
you do know.

875
01:11:03,943 --> 01:11:06,280
Yeah? Whose authority?

876
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:11,287
-Five hundred dollars, this cost.
What's inside it?

877
01:11:11,552 --> 01:11:15,324
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

878
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,863
Useful?

879
01:11:22,596 --> 01:11:23,631
Maybe.

880
01:11:24,098 --> 01:11:25,900
You're on. You've got an hour.

881
01:11:26,298 --> 01:11:27,333
An hour?

882
01:11:28,635 --> 01:11:30,906
l was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

883
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,676
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

884
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:37,013
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

885
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,983
-What's that?
-Good authority.

886
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,923
Uncle Peter.

887
01:11:48,623 --> 01:11:50,760
Just make them stop.

888
01:11:51,059 --> 01:11:53,395
-The combination.
-l don't know it.

889
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,231
-Why does Browning say you do?
-l don't know.

890
01:11:56,396 --> 01:11:58,869
Just let me talk to him
and l'll find out.

891
01:12:01,236 --> 01:12:03,941
You have one hour. Start talking.

892
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:07,142
You all right?

893
01:12:09,044 --> 01:12:10,346
You okay?

894
01:12:14,049 --> 01:12:17,723
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

895
01:12:18,385 --> 01:12:20,857
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

896
01:12:21,022 --> 01:12:22,892
-They're trying to open his safe.
-Yeah.

897
01:12:23,058 --> 01:12:25,798
They thought l'd know the combination,
but l don't know it.

898
01:12:25,961 --> 01:12:28,700
-Yeah, well, neither do l, so....
-What?

899
01:12:29,464 --> 01:12:32,703
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

900
01:12:32,867 --> 01:12:35,405
No, he never gave me any combination.

901
01:12:36,138 --> 01:12:40,279
Maybe he did. l mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

902
01:12:40,442 --> 01:12:41,645
Well, what, then?

903
01:12:41,811 --> 01:12:44,348
l don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

904
01:12:44,512 --> 01:12:48,453
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

905
01:12:50,152 --> 01:12:54,094
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

906
01:12:54,825 --> 01:12:56,293
Perhaps after your mother died.

907
01:12:58,961 --> 01:13:01,098
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

908
01:13:03,396 --> 01:13:08,372
''Robert,
there's really nothing to be said.''

909
01:13:08,535 --> 01:13:10,872
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

910
01:13:11,037 --> 01:13:13,743
l was 11, Uncle Peter.

911
01:13:14,507 --> 01:13:17,747
-How's he doing?
-He's in a lot of pain.

912
01:13:17,912 --> 01:13:21,519
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

913
01:13:21,682 --> 01:13:22,917
And if he dies?

914
01:13:24,085 --> 01:13:25,554
Worst-case scenario?

915
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,424
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

916
01:13:28,588 --> 01:13:32,663
Cobb, l'll still honor the arrangement.

917
01:13:32,828 --> 01:13:34,529
l appreciate that, Saito.

918
01:13:34,695 --> 01:13:38,769
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

919
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:40,971
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

920
01:13:41,136 --> 01:13:44,910
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

921
01:13:45,374 --> 01:13:46,710
Filled with regret?

922
01:13:48,142 --> 01:13:49,245
Waiting to die alone.

923
01:13:49,911 --> 01:13:51,013
No.

924
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:53,215
l'll come back.

925
01:13:54,016 --> 01:13:56,687
And we'll be young men together again.

926
01:14:02,657 --> 01:14:03,726
Breathe.

927
01:14:03,892 --> 01:14:06,931
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

928
01:14:07,095 --> 01:14:08,999
-They just wanna ransom us.
-l heard them.

929
01:14:09,165 --> 01:14:13,072
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

930
01:14:13,235 --> 01:14:14,704
All right. What is in the safe?

931
01:14:15,804 --> 01:14:16,973
Something for you.

932
01:14:17,606 --> 01:14:21,748
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

933
01:14:22,477 --> 01:14:25,549
-A will.
-Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

934
01:14:25,714 --> 01:14:26,950
That's an alternate.

935
01:14:27,116 --> 01:14:29,487
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

936
01:14:29,651 --> 01:14:32,289
lt splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

937
01:14:32,455 --> 01:14:36,163
lt'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

938
01:14:36,327 --> 01:14:38,799
Destroying my whole inheritance?

939
01:14:40,463 --> 01:14:43,635
-Why would he suggest such a thing?
-l just don't know.

940
01:14:46,502 --> 01:14:48,472
He loved you, Robert.

941
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:50,674
ln his own way.

942
01:14:50,841 --> 01:14:52,642
In his own way.

943
01:14:53,943 --> 01:14:55,479
At the end...

944
01:14:56,612 --> 01:14:58,950
...he called me in to his deathbed.

945
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,287
He could barely speak.

946
01:15:02,353 --> 01:15:06,594
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

947
01:15:09,093 --> 01:15:10,728
He pulled me close.

948
01:15:13,398 --> 01:15:15,502
And l could only make out...

949
01:15:16,368 --> 01:15:17,803
...one word.

950
01:15:21,505 --> 01:15:23,476
''Disappointed.''

951
01:15:29,114 --> 01:15:30,316
When were you in limbo?

952
01:15:31,883 --> 01:15:35,389
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

953
01:15:35,552 --> 01:15:37,924
-But they don't know the truth.
-Truth? What truth?

954
01:15:38,123 --> 01:15:42,265
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

955
01:15:42,428 --> 01:15:46,501
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

956
01:15:46,663 --> 01:15:49,068
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

957
01:15:49,234 --> 01:15:51,038
...we're also going deeper into you.

958
01:15:51,871 --> 01:15:55,143
And l'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

959
01:15:59,145 --> 01:16:00,614
We were working together.

960
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:04,453
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

961
01:16:04,649 --> 01:16:05,918
l kept pushing things.

962
01:16:06,085 --> 01:16:09,758
l wanted to go deeper and deeper.
l wanted to go further.

963
01:16:10,256 --> 01:16:15,132
l just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

964
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:18,034
...that we could get trapped so deep...

965
01:16:18,864 --> 01:16:22,170
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

966
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:25,305
...we lost sight of what was real.

967
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:33,950
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

968
01:16:35,581 --> 01:16:37,585
We did that for years.

969
01:16:38,717 --> 01:16:40,687
We built our own world.

970
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:43,757
How long were you stuck there?

971
01:16:44,925 --> 01:16:47,030
Something like 50 years.

972
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:51,598
Jesus.

973
01:16:53,899 --> 01:16:55,236
How could you stand it?

974
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:58,142
lt wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

975
01:16:58,142 --> 01:17:01,180
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

976
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:05,617
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

977
01:17:05,781 --> 01:17:07,183
And what about for her?

978
01:17:10,653 --> 01:17:14,559
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

979
01:17:15,958 --> 01:17:21,201
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

980
01:17:24,134 --> 01:17:26,637
Limbo became her reality.

981
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:29,773
What happened when you woke up?

982
01:17:30,305 --> 01:17:33,980
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

983
01:17:35,045 --> 01:17:39,552
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

984
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:44,223
l knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

985
01:17:45,588 --> 01:17:47,859
Eventually, she told me the truth.

986
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:51,664
She was possessed by an idea.

987
01:17:51,829 --> 01:17:57,538
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

988
01:17:58,667 --> 01:18:01,140
That our world wasn't real.

989
01:18:02,073 --> 01:18:06,346
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

990
01:18:06,876 --> 01:18:09,248
...that in order to get back home...

991
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,283
...we had to kill ourselves.

992
01:18:18,923 --> 01:18:22,396
-What about your children?
-She thought they were projections...

993
01:18:22,559 --> 01:18:25,564
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

994
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:27,432
l'm their mother!
Calm down.

995
01:18:27,597 --> 01:18:28,867
l can tell the difference.

996
01:18:29,034 --> 01:18:31,370
lf this is my dream,
why can't l control this?

997
01:18:31,534 --> 01:18:33,237
You don't know you're dreaming!

998
01:18:33,403 --> 01:18:35,607
She was certain
there was nothing l could do...

999
01:18:35,773 --> 01:18:39,614
...no matter how much l begged,
no matter how much l pleaded.

1000
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:45,618
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

1001
01:18:45,783 --> 01:18:52,296
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversay.

1002
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:21,155
-Sweetheart, what are you doing?
-Join me.

1003
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:25,594
Just - Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1004
01:19:25,757 --> 01:19:30,199
No. l'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1005
01:19:30,362 --> 01:19:32,065
No, l'm not.

1006
01:19:32,231 --> 01:19:34,336
Now, you listen to me.

1007
01:19:34,935 --> 01:19:39,175
lf you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1008
01:19:39,338 --> 01:19:41,275
Now, just step back inside.

1009
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,180
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1010
01:19:44,344 --> 01:19:46,281
We've talked enough.

1011
01:19:48,347 --> 01:19:50,017
-Mal.
-Come out onto the ledge...

1012
01:19:50,183 --> 01:19:52,889
-...or l'll jump right now.
-Okay.

1013
01:19:57,157 --> 01:19:58,960
We're gonna talk about this.

1014
01:19:59,827 --> 01:20:00,995
All right?

1015
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:06,237
-l'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
-No, honey.

1016
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:10,207
No, l can't. You know l can't do that.

1017
01:20:10,371 --> 01:20:13,143
Take a second, think about our children.

1018
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,044
Think about James.

1019
01:20:15,775 --> 01:20:17,411
Think about Phillipa, now.

1020
01:20:17,577 --> 01:20:20,517
lf l go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1021
01:20:20,681 --> 01:20:23,988
-What does that mean?
-l filed a letter with our attorney...

1022
01:20:24,418 --> 01:20:27,756
...explaining how l'm fearful
for my safety.

1023
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,128
How you've threatened to kill me.

1024
01:20:34,929 --> 01:20:37,566
-Why did you do this?
-l love you, Dom.

1025
01:20:37,731 --> 01:20:39,502
Why did ? Why would you do this to me?

1026
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:42,538
l've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1027
01:20:42,703 --> 01:20:45,742
We're going home to our real children.

1028
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:49,547
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1029
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:51,014
You're waiting for a train.

1030
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:55,086
-Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
-A train that will take you far away.

1031
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,254
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1032
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:01,260
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1033
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,627
-Mal, look at me!
-But it doesn't matter.

1034
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:06,999
-Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
-Because you'll be together.

1035
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:11,004
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1036
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:12,602
Jesus Christ!

1037
01:21:16,106 --> 01:21:19,845
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1038
01:21:20,009 --> 01:21:24,217
lt made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1039
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:25,616
So l ran.

1040
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:29,687
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1041
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:40,700
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

1042
01:21:40,964 --> 01:21:42,032
All right, let's go.

1043
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:46,372
l left my children behind and l've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1044
01:21:46,937 --> 01:21:50,810
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1045
01:21:50,974 --> 01:21:54,281
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1046
01:21:55,512 --> 01:21:58,083
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1047
01:21:58,248 --> 01:22:03,225
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1048
01:22:03,387 --> 01:22:05,224
But you don't have to do that alone.

1049
01:22:05,389 --> 01:22:07,659
-No, you're not....
-l'm doing it for the others.

1050
01:22:08,326 --> 01:22:13,436
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1051
01:22:18,502 --> 01:22:20,005
We have to move.

1052
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:21,607
Time's up.

1053
01:22:21,772 --> 01:22:24,510
All right. l don't know any combination.

1054
01:22:24,674 --> 01:22:27,780
-Not consciously, anyway.
How about instinctively, huh?

1055
01:22:27,945 --> 01:22:31,886
l got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1056
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:34,955
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1057
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,356
-l have no idea.
-Right now!

1058
01:22:37,521 --> 01:22:39,759
l said, right now! Right now!

1059
01:22:39,924 --> 01:22:43,831
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1060
01:22:47,698 --> 01:22:49,701
You'll have to do better than that.

1061
01:22:49,867 --> 01:22:53,207
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1062
01:22:57,576 --> 01:23:01,716
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

1063
01:23:06,986 --> 01:23:08,488
What'd you get?

1064
01:23:08,887 --> 01:23:11,425
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1065
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:12,625
This helps us how?

1066
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:15,896
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1067
01:23:17,096 --> 01:23:20,202
-How are we gonna reconcile them?
-l'm working on that.

1068
01:23:20,366 --> 01:23:23,905
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1069
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:27,643
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1070
01:24:02,743 --> 01:24:03,778
Damn it.

1071
01:24:03,944 --> 01:24:06,948
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1072
01:24:23,697 --> 01:24:26,702
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1073
01:24:26,867 --> 01:24:30,909
-Destroy his one positive relationship?
-No, repair his relationship with his father...

1074
01:24:31,073 --> 01:24:33,376
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1075
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:36,546
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1076
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,082
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1077
01:24:39,247 --> 01:24:41,752
-l think we run with Mr. Charles.
-No.

1078
01:24:42,151 --> 01:24:43,586
Who's Mr. Charles?
-Bad idea.

1079
01:24:43,752 --> 01:24:47,291
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1080
01:24:47,455 --> 01:24:49,560
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1081
01:24:49,724 --> 01:24:52,062
-You've done it before?
Yeah, and it didn't work.

1082
01:24:52,228 --> 01:24:55,734
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1083
01:24:55,897 --> 01:24:57,933
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

1084
01:24:58,099 --> 01:25:00,204
-l need some kind of distraction.
No problem.

1085
01:25:00,369 --> 01:25:02,573
How about a lovely lady
that l've used before?

1086
01:25:02,737 --> 01:25:04,807
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1087
01:25:04,973 --> 01:25:07,445
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1088
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:15,354
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1089
01:25:15,518 --> 01:25:18,825
l'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1090
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:20,791
-You ready?
-Ready!

1091
01:25:22,024 --> 01:25:23,126
Sweet dreams.

1092
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:25,195
Am l boring you?

1093
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:29,702
l was telling you my story.
l guess it wasn't to your liking.

1094
01:25:31,535 --> 01:25:34,207
Um, l have a lot on my mind.

1095
01:25:35,738 --> 01:25:37,341
There goes Mr. Charles.

1096
01:25:42,044 --> 01:25:44,683
Mr. Fischer, right?

1097
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:48,355
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. l

1098
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:49,653
Hmm.

1099
01:25:49,819 --> 01:25:52,491
-And you must be?
-Leaving.

1100
01:25:55,726 --> 01:25:56,861
ln case you get bored.

1101
01:26:02,099 --> 01:26:03,469
Must've blown you off.

1102
01:26:03,634 --> 01:26:06,373
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1103
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:12,981
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

1104
01:26:16,913 --> 01:26:19,251
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500

1105
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:20,552
About $500, right?

1106
01:26:20,718 --> 01:26:23,691
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

1107
01:26:23,855 --> 01:26:25,792
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1108
01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:29,696
lt's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1109
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:31,197
And why don't you approve?

1110
01:26:31,363 --> 01:26:33,366
lt involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

1111
01:26:33,532 --> 01:26:35,669
...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1112
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:38,772
-Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
-Hmm.

1113
01:26:38,936 --> 01:26:40,706
So now you've noticed how much time...

1114
01:26:40,872 --> 01:26:43,510
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1115
01:26:45,244 --> 01:26:47,013
Mr. Saito, can l have a moment?

1116
01:26:47,179 --> 01:26:49,616
-l'm sorry, but....
Hold on! Wait!

1117
01:26:50,949 --> 01:26:52,252
You look a bit perkier.

1118
01:26:52,418 --> 01:26:54,754
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1119
01:27:00,993 --> 01:27:02,496
Turbulence on the plane?

1120
01:27:02,662 --> 01:27:04,365
No, it's much closer.

1121
01:27:04,531 --> 01:27:06,200
That's Yusuf's driving.

1122
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:17,012
Um, l'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

1123
01:27:17,177 --> 01:27:19,281
Rod Green from marketing.

1124
01:27:19,445 --> 01:27:21,047
But that's not true at all, is it?

1125
01:27:23,148 --> 01:27:26,622
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1126
01:27:26,819 --> 01:27:28,790
l'm the head of your security down here.

1127
01:27:30,056 --> 01:27:31,992
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

1128
01:27:32,157 --> 01:27:34,495
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

1129
01:27:34,661 --> 01:27:38,168
-Okay.
-We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1130
01:27:41,802 --> 01:27:43,372
Security, huh?

1131
01:27:45,806 --> 01:27:47,976
-You work for the hotel?
-No, no.

1132
01:27:48,141 --> 01:27:52,750
l specialize in a very specific type
of security.

1133
01:27:53,146 --> 01:27:54,817
Subconscious security.

1134
01:27:54,982 --> 01:27:57,086
You're talking about dreams?

1135
01:27:57,252 --> 01:28:00,122
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

1136
01:28:01,154 --> 01:28:02,557
l am here to protect you.

1137
01:28:16,003 --> 01:28:18,541
Mr. Fischer, l'm here
to protect you in the event...

1138
01:28:18,707 --> 01:28:22,080
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1139
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:24,881
You're not safe here.

1140
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:27,317
They're coming for you.

1141
01:28:45,668 --> 01:28:47,705
Strange weather, isn't it?

1142
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:53,676
You feel that?

1143
01:28:55,645 --> 01:28:56,847
What's happening?

1144
01:28:57,012 --> 01:29:00,253
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1145
01:29:00,417 --> 01:29:03,288
...which is making his subconscious
Iook for the dreamer.

1146
01:29:03,452 --> 01:29:06,524
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1147
01:29:11,528 --> 01:29:15,401
-They're still looking at us.
-Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1148
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,101
We should probably get out of here.

1149
01:29:33,383 --> 01:29:36,956
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1150
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:41,126
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1151
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:44,463
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1152
01:29:49,266 --> 01:29:51,504
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

1153
01:29:51,703 --> 01:29:55,777
...is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?

1154
01:29:56,607 --> 01:29:57,909
Yeah, l....

1155
01:29:58,075 --> 01:30:00,613
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1156
01:30:00,778 --> 01:30:05,955
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and l'm here to protect you. Go on.

1157
01:30:07,952 --> 01:30:09,322
Mm-hm.

1158
01:30:12,122 --> 01:30:13,959
-You're not real?
-No.

1159
01:30:14,124 --> 01:30:17,499
No. l'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1160
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:19,766
l was sent here to protect you
in the event...

1161
01:30:19,931 --> 01:30:22,836
...that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

1162
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,240
And l believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1163
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:28,374
Yeah.

1164
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:29,642
Okay.

1165
01:30:30,542 --> 01:30:31,777
Okay.

1166
01:30:34,613 --> 01:30:36,616
Can you get me out of here?

1167
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:40,120
Right away. Follow me.

1168
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:55,669
Hold on a second.

1169
01:31:00,606 --> 01:31:02,444
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1170
01:31:02,609 --> 01:31:04,879
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

1171
01:31:05,044 --> 01:31:07,616
lf you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1172
01:31:09,349 --> 01:31:11,653
l need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1173
01:31:23,364 --> 01:31:26,969
lf this is a dream, l should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1174
01:31:27,132 --> 01:31:29,237
l wouldn't do that if l were you,
Mr. Fischer.

1175
01:31:29,403 --> 01:31:32,909
l believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1176
01:31:33,073 --> 01:31:34,241
...you may not wake up.

1177
01:31:35,376 --> 01:31:39,684
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what l'm talking about.

1178
01:31:42,016 --> 01:31:43,686
You remember the training.

1179
01:31:44,819 --> 01:31:46,221
Remember what l said to you.

1180
01:31:47,087 --> 01:31:48,256
Give me the gun.

1181
01:32:00,068 --> 01:32:02,672
-This room should be directly below 528?
-Yeah.

1182
01:32:12,047 --> 01:32:13,550
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1183
01:32:13,715 --> 01:32:17,556
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1184
01:32:17,919 --> 01:32:20,557
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

1185
01:32:20,722 --> 01:32:23,326
There was rain.

1186
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:25,463
Uncle Peter.

1187
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:29,366
-Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
-Where were they holding you?

1188
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:35,673
-They had us in the back of a van.
-That explains the gravity shifts.

1189
01:32:35,872 --> 01:32:37,942
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1190
01:32:38,107 --> 01:32:40,377
lt had something to do with, um....

1191
01:32:41,009 --> 01:32:43,882
Something to do with a safe.

1192
01:32:44,514 --> 01:32:46,149
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1193
01:32:46,314 --> 01:32:49,019
lt's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1194
01:32:49,184 --> 01:32:50,921
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1195
01:32:51,087 --> 01:32:53,493
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

1196
01:32:53,656 --> 01:32:56,427
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1197
01:32:56,592 --> 01:33:00,165
l need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1198
01:33:00,328 --> 01:33:01,965
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1199
01:33:02,132 --> 01:33:05,873
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1200
01:33:06,036 --> 01:33:08,774
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1201
01:33:08,938 --> 01:33:12,713
lt can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1202
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:16,649
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1203
01:33:16,813 --> 01:33:19,651
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1204
01:33:19,815 --> 01:33:21,151
Five.

1205
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:24,557
Five, two - It was something,
it was a long number.

1206
01:33:24,721 --> 01:33:26,825
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

1207
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:28,025
Yep.

1208
01:33:28,191 --> 01:33:32,233
-So do you use a timer?
-No, l have to judge it for myself.

1209
01:33:32,428 --> 01:33:35,701
While you're all asleep in 528,
l wait for Yusuf's kick.

1210
01:33:35,866 --> 01:33:38,003
-Well, how will you know?
-His music warns me.

1211
01:33:38,168 --> 01:33:42,110
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1212
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:45,478
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1213
01:33:45,642 --> 01:33:48,047
lf it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1214
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:51,485
But if it's too late,
l won't be able to drop us.

1215
01:33:51,649 --> 01:33:55,455
-Well, why not?
-Because the van will be in freefall.

1216
01:33:55,987 --> 01:33:58,826
-Can't drop you without gravity.
-Right.

1217
01:34:04,461 --> 01:34:06,700
They're with me. Go on.

1218
01:34:31,023 --> 01:34:32,058
Mr. Charles.

1219
01:34:32,224 --> 01:34:35,197
-Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
-Yeah, l think so.

1220
01:34:35,361 --> 01:34:37,430
They were trying to put you under.

1221
01:34:37,863 --> 01:34:39,933
-l'm already under.
-Under again.

1222
01:34:40,099 --> 01:34:42,671
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

1223
01:34:43,268 --> 01:34:45,741
Hey. l see you've changed.

1224
01:34:45,905 --> 01:34:47,541
l'm sorry?

1225
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:51,914
Oh, l'm sorry.
l mistook you for a friend.

1226
01:34:52,077 --> 01:34:53,346
Oh.

1227
01:34:53,512 --> 01:34:55,650
Good-looking fellow, l'm sure.

1228
01:34:56,315 --> 01:34:59,254
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1229
01:34:59,418 --> 01:35:01,288
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

1230
01:35:01,453 --> 01:35:03,423
-Why?
-Because how he acts will tell us...

1231
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:06,929
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1232
01:35:07,093 --> 01:35:08,128
Shh.

1233
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:15,204
-Uncle Peter.
-You said you were kidnapped together?

1234
01:35:15,367 --> 01:35:18,807
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1235
01:35:18,972 --> 01:35:20,441
And you saw them torture him?

1236
01:35:27,982 --> 01:35:29,818
The kidnappers are working for you?

1237
01:35:30,785 --> 01:35:32,254
Robert.

1238
01:35:32,419 --> 01:35:36,260
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

1239
01:35:36,657 --> 01:35:40,899
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
l can't let you destroy it.

1240
01:35:41,063 --> 01:35:43,433
l'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

1241
01:35:43,597 --> 01:35:47,771
l couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

1242
01:35:48,568 --> 01:35:51,609
-What taunt?
-The will, Robert. That will?

1243
01:35:51,773 --> 01:35:53,710
That's his last insult.

1244
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:57,513
A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...

1245
01:35:57,678 --> 01:36:01,485
...by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

1246
01:36:07,154 --> 01:36:12,532
-What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
-l'm sorry.

1247
01:36:13,895 --> 01:36:17,002
But he's wrong.

1248
01:36:17,734 --> 01:36:20,370
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

1249
01:36:20,534 --> 01:36:22,972
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

1250
01:36:23,138 --> 01:36:25,242
-How do you know?
-Trust me, it's what l do.

1251
01:36:25,406 --> 01:36:28,179
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

1252
01:36:29,378 --> 01:36:32,784
l need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1253
01:36:35,351 --> 01:36:39,425
We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

1254
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:42,159
All right.

1255
01:36:48,131 --> 01:36:49,399
He's out.
-Wait.

1256
01:36:49,564 --> 01:36:51,635
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

1257
01:36:51,801 --> 01:36:53,136
We're going into Fischer's.

1258
01:36:53,302 --> 01:36:56,008
l told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1259
01:36:56,173 --> 01:36:58,509
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1260
01:36:58,674 --> 01:37:00,243
That's right.

1261
01:37:00,409 --> 01:37:02,479
Security's gonna run you down hard.

1262
01:37:02,645 --> 01:37:04,983
And l will lead them on a merry chase.

1263
01:37:05,548 --> 01:37:08,186
-Just be back before the kick.
-Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1264
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:14,592
You good?

1265
01:37:17,761 --> 01:37:19,096
Hey. You ready?

1266
01:37:19,263 --> 01:37:22,871
Yes, yes. l'm fine. l'm ready.

1267
01:37:35,413 --> 01:37:36,749
Cobb?

1268
01:37:37,414 --> 01:37:39,852
Cobb? What's down there?

1269
01:37:43,221 --> 01:37:45,826
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

1270
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:47,893
l mean, what's down there for you?

1271
01:40:24,486 --> 01:40:26,256
Did you see that?

1272
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:46,578
Eames, this is your dream.

1273
01:40:46,743 --> 01:40:49,850
l need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

1274
01:40:50,014 --> 01:40:51,815
-Who guides Fischer in?
Not me.

1275
01:40:51,981 --> 01:40:54,452
lf l know the route,
everything could be compromised.

1276
01:40:54,617 --> 01:40:57,156
-l designed the place.
No, you're with me.

1277
01:40:57,321 --> 01:40:58,857
l could do it.

1278
01:40:59,289 --> 01:41:01,726
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

1279
01:41:01,892 --> 01:41:06,100
-Fischer, you'll be going with him.
-All right. What about you?

1280
01:41:06,263 --> 01:41:09,102
You keep this live.
l'll be listening in the whole time.

1281
01:41:09,266 --> 01:41:13,407
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1282
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:14,874
You're not coming in?

1283
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,376
ln order to find out the truth
about your father...

1284
01:41:17,541 --> 01:41:20,580
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1285
01:41:21,445 --> 01:41:22,915
Come on, Fischer!

1286
01:42:18,003 --> 01:42:21,676
-Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
-Go, go, go!

1287
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,376
Move!

1288
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:25,978
Go!

1289
01:42:41,194 --> 01:42:42,229
Sod it.

1290
01:42:53,406 --> 01:42:55,076
l hope you're ready.

1291
01:43:03,816 --> 01:43:05,587
No, it's too soon.

1292
01:43:12,092 --> 01:43:13,294
Cobb, do you hear that?

1293
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:17,035
l first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
l thought it was the wind up here.

1294
01:43:17,565 --> 01:43:20,070
Yeah, l hear it. It's music.

1295
01:43:20,234 --> 01:43:21,636
So, what do we do?

1296
01:43:21,802 --> 01:43:23,205
We move fast.

1297
01:43:28,709 --> 01:43:30,946
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1298
01:43:32,813 --> 01:43:35,186
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1299
01:43:36,118 --> 01:43:38,221
-Hey!
-That's him!

1300
01:43:38,885 --> 01:43:40,622
-Which gives us what?
-Sixty minutes.

1301
01:43:40,788 --> 01:43:44,062
-Can they make that route in an hour?
-They have to climb to the terrace.

1302
01:43:44,226 --> 01:43:47,098
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

1303
01:43:58,307 --> 01:43:59,942
lt's designed as a labyrinth.

1304
01:44:00,108 --> 01:44:02,580
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1305
01:44:02,745 --> 01:44:04,347
Eames?

1306
01:44:27,437 --> 01:44:28,705
Did Eames add any features?

1307
01:44:28,871 --> 01:44:30,341
l don't think l should tell you.

1308
01:44:30,506 --> 01:44:32,810
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

1309
01:44:33,243 --> 01:44:36,015
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1310
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:37,381
Good. Explain it to them.

1311
01:44:37,547 --> 01:44:38,783
Saito?
-Go ahead.

1312
01:45:12,116 --> 01:45:13,685
Paradox.

1313
01:46:23,557 --> 01:46:25,626
What was that?
-The kick.

1314
01:46:26,225 --> 01:46:28,128
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1315
01:46:28,294 --> 01:46:29,996
Yeah, we missed it.

1316
01:46:30,163 --> 01:46:31,365
Man.

1317
01:46:31,531 --> 01:46:35,839
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?

1318
01:46:36,002 --> 01:46:37,271
Uh-huh.

1319
01:46:38,003 --> 01:46:40,175
Well, what the hell do we do now?

1320
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:42,177
We finish the job before the next kick.

1321
01:46:42,342 --> 01:46:44,446
-What next kick?
-When the van hits the water.

1322
01:47:07,301 --> 01:47:10,740
If you'd like to
make a call, please hang up and ty again.

1323
01:47:10,905 --> 01:47:12,742
lf you need help, hang up....

1324
01:47:12,974 --> 01:47:16,281
How do l drop you without gravity?

1325
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:21,452
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1326
01:47:44,873 --> 01:47:46,543
You okay?

1327
01:47:51,013 --> 01:47:54,888
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1328
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:56,586
Go, go, go!

1329
01:47:58,754 --> 01:47:59,922
There's something wrong.

1330
01:48:00,088 --> 01:48:02,426
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1331
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:05,897
Just buy us more time, all right?

1332
01:48:06,062 --> 01:48:07,899
-Come on!
-On my way.

1333
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:09,766
Come on! Move!

1334
01:49:33,952 --> 01:49:35,488
All right.

1335
01:49:47,667 --> 01:49:50,472
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1336
01:49:50,636 --> 01:49:54,141
-Does the strong room have windows?
-lt wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1337
01:49:54,306 --> 01:49:56,544
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1338
01:49:58,177 --> 01:50:01,517
-Are those projections his subconscious?
-Yes.

1339
01:50:01,681 --> 01:50:05,054
-Are you destroying parts of his mind?
-No. They're just projections.

1340
01:50:31,344 --> 01:50:33,081
-We're here.
-You're clear, but hurry.

1341
01:50:33,246 --> 01:50:35,083
There's an entire army headed your way.

1342
01:51:01,909 --> 01:51:03,278
l'm in.

1343
01:51:08,582 --> 01:51:09,718
There he is.

1344
01:51:52,294 --> 01:51:54,999
-There's someone in there.
-Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1345
01:51:56,166 --> 01:51:58,738
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1346
01:52:04,473 --> 01:52:05,642
Cobb.

1347
01:52:06,276 --> 01:52:08,814
No, she is not real.

1348
01:52:09,412 --> 01:52:10,647
How do you know that?

1349
01:52:10,814 --> 01:52:14,454
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1350
01:52:18,455 --> 01:52:19,990
Hello.

1351
01:52:24,662 --> 01:52:27,867
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1352
01:53:11,777 --> 01:53:14,649
What happened?
-Mal killed Fischer.

1353
01:53:16,915 --> 01:53:18,952
l couldn't shoot her.

1354
01:53:19,618 --> 01:53:22,991
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

1355
01:53:23,155 --> 01:53:24,223
lt's all over.

1356
01:53:25,957 --> 01:53:27,593
So that's it, then? We failed?

1357
01:53:28,226 --> 01:53:30,396
We're done. l'm sorry.

1358
01:53:34,266 --> 01:53:36,904
lt's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1359
01:53:37,603 --> 01:53:41,510
Shame. l wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. l swear we had this.

1360
01:53:41,674 --> 01:53:43,743
Let's set the charges.

1361
01:53:45,577 --> 01:53:47,080
No, there's still another way.

1362
01:53:48,381 --> 01:53:51,788
-We have to follow Fischer down there.
-Not enough time.

1363
01:53:51,951 --> 01:53:54,790
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

1364
01:53:55,921 --> 01:53:57,024
And we will find him.

1365
01:53:57,190 --> 01:54:01,131
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1366
01:54:01,294 --> 01:54:04,199
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1367
01:54:05,231 --> 01:54:06,935
Look, you get him in there.

1368
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:09,971
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1369
01:54:10,136 --> 01:54:12,941
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1370
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:18,917
lt's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while l set the charges.

1371
01:54:19,079 --> 01:54:21,183
Saito will never make it, will he?

1372
01:54:22,481 --> 01:54:25,689
-Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
-Go for it.

1373
01:54:25,853 --> 01:54:28,792
lf you are not back before the kick,
l am gone with or without you.

1374
01:54:28,956 --> 01:54:32,195
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1375
01:54:36,430 --> 01:54:38,635
Can l trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1376
01:54:38,799 --> 01:54:40,001
Mal's gonna be down there.

1377
01:54:40,167 --> 01:54:42,606
l know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1378
01:54:42,770 --> 01:54:46,677
-How do you know?
-Because she wants me to come after him.

1379
01:54:46,841 --> 01:54:49,010
She wants me back down there with her.

1380
01:55:15,770 --> 01:55:16,805
All right?

1381
01:55:24,046 --> 01:55:26,717
-This is your world?
-lt was.

1382
01:55:27,515 --> 01:55:29,453
And this is where she'll be.

1383
01:55:30,252 --> 01:55:31,755
Come on.

1384
01:56:18,234 --> 01:56:20,706
Saito. Saito.

1385
01:56:21,137 --> 01:56:25,112
l need you to take care of Fischer
while l go set some charges, okay?

1386
01:56:25,276 --> 01:56:28,716
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1387
01:56:31,348 --> 01:56:32,516
Don't be silly.

1388
01:57:05,017 --> 01:57:07,087
You built all this? This is incredible.

1389
01:57:07,552 --> 01:57:09,588
We built for years.

1390
01:57:10,621 --> 01:57:12,625
Then we started in on the memories.

1391
01:57:19,665 --> 01:57:21,068
This way.

1392
01:58:02,742 --> 01:58:04,846
This was our neighborhood.

1393
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:07,349
Places from our past.

1394
01:58:07,514 --> 01:58:09,284
That was our first apartment.

1395
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:11,687
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1396
01:58:11,852 --> 01:58:14,388
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1397
01:58:14,554 --> 01:58:17,360
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

1398
01:58:17,524 --> 01:58:19,795
Like l told you, we had lots of time.

1399
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:21,562
What is that?

1400
01:58:23,097 --> 01:58:24,867
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1401
01:58:25,032 --> 01:58:27,469
-Well, will she be in there?
-No.

1402
01:58:27,801 --> 01:58:28,836
Come on.

1403
01:58:29,002 --> 01:58:32,341
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1404
01:58:32,506 --> 01:58:35,446
ln the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

1405
01:59:16,018 --> 01:59:18,054
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1406
01:59:18,453 --> 01:59:20,891
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1407
01:59:21,055 --> 01:59:22,458
What?

1408
01:59:23,459 --> 01:59:24,561
l'm gonna improvise.

1409
01:59:24,727 --> 01:59:29,403
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

1410
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:46,352
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

1411
01:59:47,183 --> 01:59:48,752
Highly contagious.

1412
01:59:48,918 --> 01:59:52,258
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1413
01:59:53,323 --> 01:59:55,293
lt can grow to define...

1414
01:59:56,326 --> 01:59:57,895
...or destroy you.

1415
02:00:01,031 --> 02:00:03,803
The smallest idea, such as:

1416
02:00:04,401 --> 02:00:06,772
''Your world is not real.''

1417
02:00:07,037 --> 02:00:10,811
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1418
02:00:12,042 --> 02:00:16,550
So certain of your world. Of what's real.

1419
02:00:16,713 --> 02:00:18,517
Do you think he is?

1420
02:00:20,318 --> 02:00:23,222
Or do you think he's as lost as l was?

1421
02:00:24,354 --> 02:00:25,857
l know what's real, Mal.

1422
02:00:27,925 --> 02:00:30,229
No creeping doubts?

1423
02:00:30,928 --> 02:00:33,565
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1424
02:00:33,865 --> 02:00:35,199
Chased around the globe...

1425
02:00:35,365 --> 02:00:38,038
...by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1426
02:00:38,202 --> 02:00:40,840
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1427
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:43,943
Admit it.

1428
02:00:45,244 --> 02:00:48,082
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1429
02:00:48,246 --> 02:00:49,781
So choose.

1430
02:00:49,947 --> 02:00:52,217
Choose to be here.

1431
02:00:52,717 --> 02:00:54,220
Choose me.

1432
02:01:20,078 --> 02:01:21,346
You know what l have to do.

1433
02:01:21,513 --> 02:01:24,186
l have to get back to our children
because you left them.

1434
02:01:25,518 --> 02:01:27,053
Because you left us.

1435
02:01:27,219 --> 02:01:29,022
-You're wrong.
l'm not wrong.

1436
02:01:29,187 --> 02:01:31,224
You're confused.

1437
02:01:32,325 --> 02:01:34,395
Our children are here.

1438
02:01:35,161 --> 02:01:38,433
And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?

1439
02:01:38,598 --> 02:01:41,670
Yes, but l'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.

1440
02:01:55,315 --> 02:01:57,318
Up above?

1441
02:01:58,217 --> 02:02:01,857
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1442
02:02:02,389 --> 02:02:03,758
Watch.

1443
02:02:04,258 --> 02:02:05,960
James? Phillipa?

1444
02:02:06,125 --> 02:02:08,562
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1445
02:02:08,729 --> 02:02:11,201
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

1446
02:02:11,365 --> 02:02:13,268
-No, l know it.
-What if you're wrong?

1447
02:02:13,667 --> 02:02:15,972
What if l'm what's real?

1448
02:02:17,171 --> 02:02:19,408
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1449
02:02:20,975 --> 02:02:23,212
But what do you believe?

1450
02:02:24,178 --> 02:02:25,413
What do you feel?

1451
02:02:27,549 --> 02:02:28,985
Guilt.

1452
02:02:30,185 --> 02:02:32,421
l feel guilt, Mal.

1453
02:02:32,954 --> 02:02:36,895
And no matter what l do,
no matter how hopeless l am...

1454
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:41,332
...no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

1455
02:02:41,496 --> 02:02:44,033
...reminding me of the truth.

1456
02:02:44,531 --> 02:02:45,833
What truth?

1457
02:02:48,269 --> 02:02:53,512
That the idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1458
02:02:56,878 --> 02:03:00,018
You planted the idea in my mind?

1459
02:03:01,516 --> 02:03:03,019
What is she talking about?

1460
02:03:03,918 --> 02:03:09,196
The reason l knew inception was possible
was because l did it to her first.

1461
02:03:10,225 --> 02:03:13,197
-l did it to my own wife.
-Why?

1462
02:03:13,929 --> 02:03:15,432
We were lost in here.

1463
02:03:16,365 --> 02:03:21,007
l knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

1464
02:03:24,206 --> 02:03:29,883
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

1465
02:03:30,646 --> 02:03:34,788
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1466
02:03:35,751 --> 02:03:37,888
And she couldn't break free.

1467
02:03:40,589 --> 02:03:43,329
So l decided to search for it.

1468
02:03:43,894 --> 02:03:48,769
l went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1469
02:03:48,931 --> 02:03:50,834
And l broke in...

1470
02:03:51,401 --> 02:03:53,571
...and l planted an idea.

1471
02:03:54,304 --> 02:03:58,078
A simple little idea
that would change everything.

1472
02:04:03,313 --> 02:04:05,684
That her world wasn't real.

1473
02:04:18,495 --> 02:04:21,702
That death was the only escape.

1474
02:04:29,107 --> 02:04:30,876
You're waiting for a train.

1475
02:04:33,177 --> 02:04:35,915
A train that'll take you far away.

1476
02:04:37,082 --> 02:04:40,087
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1477
02:04:41,185 --> 02:04:43,222
...but you can't know for sure.

1478
02:04:44,388 --> 02:04:45,923
Yet it doesn't matter.

1479
02:04:47,359 --> 02:04:50,531
-Now, tell me why!
-Because you'll be together!

1480
02:04:54,866 --> 02:04:58,941
But l never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1481
02:04:59,105 --> 02:05:01,509
...that even after she woke....

1482
02:05:04,409 --> 02:05:06,880
That even after
you came back to reality...

1483
02:05:09,815 --> 02:05:12,787
...that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

1484
02:05:15,555 --> 02:05:17,959
That death was the only escape.

1485
02:05:18,125 --> 02:05:20,795
Mal, no! Jesus!

1486
02:05:20,959 --> 02:05:24,667
-You infected my mind.
-l was trying to save you.

1487
02:05:24,831 --> 02:05:26,234
You betrayed me.

1488
02:05:27,067 --> 02:05:30,773
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

1489
02:05:30,937 --> 02:05:33,976
We can still be together, right here...

1490
02:05:34,141 --> 02:05:36,612
...in the world we built together.

1491
02:06:57,426 --> 02:06:59,763
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1492
02:07:00,630 --> 02:07:01,931
You can't have him.

1493
02:07:02,964 --> 02:07:06,405
-lf l stay here, will you let him go?
-What are you talking about?

1494
02:07:10,873 --> 02:07:12,710
Fischer is on the porch.

1495
02:07:13,276 --> 02:07:15,880
-Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
-Cobb, you can't do this.

1496
02:07:16,045 --> 02:07:18,683
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

1497
02:07:34,331 --> 02:07:37,437
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

1498
02:07:37,601 --> 02:07:41,274
You take Fischer with you, all right?
-You can't stay here to be with her.

1499
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:46,545
l'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1500
02:07:46,710 --> 02:07:50,217
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means l have to find him.

1501
02:07:52,216 --> 02:07:55,322
l can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

1502
02:07:55,485 --> 02:07:58,891
l'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

1503
02:07:59,056 --> 02:08:00,392
No.

1504
02:08:01,558 --> 02:08:02,994
l wish.

1505
02:08:04,595 --> 02:08:07,098
l wish more than anything, but...

1506
02:08:08,199 --> 02:08:10,937
...l can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

1507
02:08:11,101 --> 02:08:13,640
...all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1508
02:08:14,739 --> 02:08:15,774
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1509
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:17,777
Look at you.

1510
02:08:19,009 --> 02:08:23,953
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1511
02:08:24,382 --> 02:08:27,019
And you were the best
that l could do, but...

1512
02:08:27,852 --> 02:08:30,291
...l'm sorry, you're just not good enough.

1513
02:08:30,456 --> 02:08:32,090
Does this feel real?

1514
02:08:34,492 --> 02:08:37,096
-What are you doing?
-lmprovising.

1515
02:08:45,703 --> 02:08:47,406
No, no, no!

1516
02:08:48,374 --> 02:08:50,778
ln there, now. Go, go, go.

1517
02:09:35,623 --> 02:09:37,525
l was dis

1518
02:09:39,225 --> 02:09:41,563
l was dis - Disa

1519
02:09:42,429 --> 02:09:44,967
-l know, Dad.
-Dis

1520
02:09:50,970 --> 02:09:53,074
l know you were disappointed...

1521
02:09:53,874 --> 02:09:55,243
...l couldn't be you.

1522
02:09:55,643 --> 02:09:57,145
No.

1523
02:09:57,645 --> 02:09:58,880
No, no, no.

1524
02:09:59,914 --> 02:10:01,916
l was disappointed...

1525
02:10:03,651 --> 02:10:05,588
...that you tried.

1526
02:10:28,843 --> 02:10:30,513
What?

1527
02:10:39,956 --> 02:10:41,090
Come on, come on.

1528
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:12,823
Dad?

1529
02:11:51,161 --> 02:11:54,234
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1530
02:12:07,078 --> 02:12:10,518
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1531
02:12:10,681 --> 02:12:12,350
l will!

1532
02:12:52,091 --> 02:12:55,263
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1533
02:12:55,428 --> 02:12:56,530
Yes.

1534
02:12:56,695 --> 02:12:59,768
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

1535
02:13:02,469 --> 02:13:03,971
But we did.

1536
02:13:05,904 --> 02:13:08,275
We did. You don't remember?

1537
02:13:12,946 --> 02:13:15,784
l miss you more than l can bear...

1538
02:13:18,151 --> 02:13:20,154
...but we had our time together.

1539
02:13:21,489 --> 02:13:23,559
And l have to let you go.

1540
02:13:25,659 --> 02:13:27,463
l have to let you go.

1541
02:14:18,714 --> 02:14:20,015
l'm sorry, Robert.

1542
02:14:47,677 --> 02:14:51,351
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1543
02:14:52,415 --> 02:14:54,452
...not just to live for him.

1544
02:14:56,052 --> 02:14:58,589
That's what l'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1545
02:15:08,364 --> 02:15:09,601
What happened?

1546
02:15:10,067 --> 02:15:11,769
-Cobb stayed.
-With Mal?

1547
02:15:11,934 --> 02:15:13,202
No, to find Saito.

1548
02:15:15,471 --> 02:15:17,241
He'll be lost.

1549
02:15:19,777 --> 02:15:21,614
No, he'll be all right.

1550
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:39,599
Have you come to kill me?

1551
02:15:43,867 --> 02:15:46,338
l'm waiting for someone.

1552
02:15:50,808 --> 02:15:53,580
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1553
02:15:56,314 --> 02:15:57,717
Cobb?

1554
02:15:59,652 --> 02:16:01,421
lmpossible.

1555
02:16:01,953 --> 02:16:04,556
We were young men together.

1556
02:16:06,157 --> 02:16:08,494
l'm an old man.

1557
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:11,798
Filled with regret.

1558
02:16:14,934 --> 02:16:17,638
Waiting to die alone.

1559
02:16:20,806 --> 02:16:22,976
l've come back for you.

1560
02:16:26,245 --> 02:16:30,118
To remind you of something.

1561
02:16:33,385 --> 02:16:35,757
Something you once knew.

1562
02:16:38,625 --> 02:16:40,862
That this world is not real.

1563
02:16:45,765 --> 02:16:50,273
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1564
02:16:51,103 --> 02:16:53,876
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1565
02:16:59,979 --> 02:17:01,315
Come back...

1566
02:17:03,851 --> 02:17:07,223
...so we can be
young men together again.

1567
02:17:10,991 --> 02:17:12,961
Come back with me.

1568
02:17:16,062 --> 02:17:17,497
Come back.

1569
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:28,944
Hot towel, sir?

1570
02:17:29,577 --> 02:17:32,449
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1571
02:17:32,612 --> 02:17:34,917
Do you need immigration forms?

1572
02:17:37,017 --> 02:17:38,353
Thank you.

1573
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:40,455
Hot towel, sir?

1574
02:17:41,455 --> 02:17:44,460
-No.
-Do you need immigration forms?

1575
02:18:55,833 --> 02:18:56,901
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1576
02:18:58,034 --> 02:18:59,669
Thank you, sir.

1577
02:19:43,714 --> 02:19:45,084
Welcome.

1578
02:19:45,549 --> 02:19:46,952
This way.

1579
02:20:08,139 --> 02:20:11,612
James? Phillipa?

1580
02:20:15,346 --> 02:20:16,615
Look who's here.

1581
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:23,288
Hey.

1582
02:20:24,389 --> 02:20:27,095
-Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
Daddy! Daddy!

1583
02:20:27,259 --> 02:20:29,529
Daddy!
How are you?

1584
02:20:30,629 --> 02:20:32,232
Look what l've been building!

1585
02:20:32,398 --> 02:20:36,105
-What are you building?
We're building a house on the cliff!

1586
02:20:36,268 --> 02:20:39,140
On the cliff? Come on, l want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1587
02:20:39,305 --> 02:20:41,877
Let's go.
Come on, Daddy!
