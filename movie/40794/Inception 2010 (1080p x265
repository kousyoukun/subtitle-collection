1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:29,990
蓝光原盘 REMUX 国英双语版

2
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,250
他神智不清 却念着你名字

3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,350
带他来

4
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,720
他孤身带着这个

5
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,150
还有这个

6
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,640
你前来杀我?
Are you here to kill me?

7
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,820
我深知眼前何物
I know what this is.

8
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,060
多年前曾见过
I've seen one before. Many, many years ago.

9
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,570
隐约记得该物主
It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.

10
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,670
一个激进的男人
A man possessed of some radical notions.

11
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,420
世上适应力最强的附寄物是什么
What is the most resilient parasite?

12
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,050
细菌? 病毒?
A bacteria? A virus?

13
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,890
蛔虫
An intestinal worm?

14
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,260
柯布先生所指是...
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...

15
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,620
意识
An idea.

16
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,420
生生不息 极易感染
Resilient. Highly contagious.

17
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,590
其据脑海 安能根绝
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate.

18
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,310
一旦扎根 根深蒂固
An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks.

19
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,710
盘亘脑海
Right in there somewhere.

20
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,440
便于你们偷取
For someone like you to steal?

21
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,550
对 睡梦状态意识防卫会减弱
Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered...

22
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,150
便于我们从中盗取信息
...and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.

23
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,550
我们就是盗梦者
It's called extraction.

24
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,280
齐藤先生 我们训练你潜意识防卫
Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself...

25
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,950
去抵抗技艺超凡的盗梦者
...from even the most skilled extractor.

26
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,290
何以保证?
How can you do that?

27
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,290
因为鄙人是最技艺超凡的盗梦者
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

28
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,170
我知晓读心探密 洞悉其术
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

29
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,270
能授与你 虽处睡梦状态
And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep...

30
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,770
意识防卫亦不减弱
...your defense is never down.

31
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,580
若要我援手 要对我敞开心胸
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me.

32
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,110
令我更甚你的亲眷
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...

33
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,580
了解你为人
...better than your therapist, better than anyone.

34
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,680
假设这是场梦 你会有个装满秘密的保险箱
If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets...

35
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,190
然而我需要知道箱中何物
...I need to know what's in that safe.

36
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,820
若要达成目的 必须对我敞开心胸
In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.

37
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,330
晚上愉快 我会考虑你提议
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal.

38
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,830
被他识穿
He knows.

39
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,340
这里怎么了
What's going on up there?

40
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,190
齐藤洞悉此局 他在耍我们
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

41
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,930
没关系 会没问题 相信我
Doesn't matter. I can get it here. Trust me.

42
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,590
资料在那保险箱里
The information is in the safe.

43
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,930
当我提及秘密时 他看了它一眼
He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.

44
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,330
她来干什么
What's she doing here?

45
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,150
你回房间 我会处理
Just head back to the room. All right? I'll take care of this.

46
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,340
务必解决 我们是来工作
Okay, make sure you do. We're here to work.

47
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,460
若跳下去 还能保命吗
If I jumped, would I survive?

48
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,230
技术高的话 或许能保命
With a clean dive, perhaps.

49
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,060
梅尔 你在这干嘛
Mal, what are you doing here?

50
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,430
我以为你很想见我
I thought you might be missing me.

51
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,870
确实如此
You know that I am.

52
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,910
但我不再相信你
But I can't trust you anymore.

53
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,010
那又何如
So what?

54
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,780
真像亚瑟的品味
Looks like Arthur's taste.

55
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,580
目标特别偏爱战后大不列颠的画家作品
Actually, the subject is partial to postwar British painters.

56
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,980
请坐
Please, have a seat.

57
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,170
告诉我
Tell me...

58
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,130
孩子们想念我吗?
...do the children miss me?

59
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,170
对你日思夜想
You can't imagine.

60
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,440
你干嘛
What are you doing?

61
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,140
出外呼吸新鲜空气
Just getting some fresh air.

62
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,310
留在这里
Stay where you are, Mal.

63
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,980
该死的
Goddamn it.

64
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,410
转身
Turn around.

65
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,610
柯布 放下枪
The gun, Dom.

66
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,020
有劳
Please.

67
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,510
柯布先生 交出信封
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

68
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,310
她告诉你 抑或你早就知道
Did she tell you? Or have you known all along?

69
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,710
知道你是来偷东西 抑或知道我们现处于梦空间?
That you're here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?

70
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,220
谁指使你们前来
I want to know the name of your employer.

71
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,090
梅尔 梦中要挟他人毫无作用
Ah, there's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?

72
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,730
取决于你是怎么要挟
That depends on what you're threatening.

73
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,800
杀死他 只是唤醒他
Killing him would just wake him up.

74
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,730
但痛击他...
But pain...

75
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,580
他会感受到
Pain is in the mind.

76
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,480
依据室内摆设 我们处于你梦中?
And judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

77
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,990
- 你干嘛 时候过早 - 但梦空间已在崩毁
- What are you doing? It's too soon. - But the dream's collapsing.

78
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,600
拖延齐藤觉醒时间 我们快到手
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer. We're almost there.

79
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,770
梦空间要崩毁
He was close. Very close.

80
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,660
阻止他
Stop him!

81
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,650
估计成功 叫醒他
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

82
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,420
他还在梦空间
He won't wake.

83
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,190
- 堕醒他 - 什么
- Give him the kick. - What?

84
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,750
推进浴缸
Dunk him.

85
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,670
他醒了
He's out.

86
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,040
你有备而来?
You came prepared, hmm?

87
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,050
连我的保安主管都不知道该地 你如何得知
Not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it?

88
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:56,410
位高权重者私筑爱巢 难以不走漏风声
It's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret...

89
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,110
何况涉及已婚之妇
...particularly where there's a married woman involved.

90
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,260
- 她不会... - 事已至此
- She would never... - Yet here we are.

91
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,420
- 进退两难 - 他们逼近
- With a dilemma. - They're getting closer.

92
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,360
- 你已拿到想要 - 不
- You got what you came for. Well, that's not true.

93
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,190
你故意漏掉一条关键信息
You left out a key piece of information, didn't you?

94
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,560
你知道我们的目的 所以有所保留
You held something back because you knew what we were up to.

95
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,600
- 问题是为何你让我们入你梦中 - 试探
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all? - An audition.

96
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,740
- 试探什么 - 不要紧 你已失败
- An audition for what? - Doesn't matter. You failed.

97
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,610
我们已拿到你藏捏的秘密
We extracted every bit of information you had in there.

98
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,310
但你的骗局漏洞百出
But your deception was obvious.

99
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,630
- 让我走吧 - 你似乎仍不明白 齐藤先生
- So leave me and go. - You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

100
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,030
幕后指使者只许行动成功
That corporation that hired us, they won't accept failure.

101
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,330
否则我们亦命不久矣
We won't last two days.

102
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,470
柯布?
Cobb?

103
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,770
别不识抬举
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.

104
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,710
马上讲出你所知道
Tell us what you know! Tell us what you know, now!

105
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,950
最讨厌这地毯
I've always hated this carpet.

106
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,490
特别易脏和磨损
It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.

107
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,320
明显是羊毛毯
But very definitely made of wool.

108
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,860
但现在
Right now...

109
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,330
明显是聚脂纤维地毯
...I'm lying on polyester.

110
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,040
换言之这里不是我的私巢
Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment.

111
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,180
柯布 你果然名下无虚
You have lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb.

112
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,640
我仍在你设计的梦中
I'm still dreaming.

113
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,150
- 情况如何 - 不如意
- How'd it go? - Not good.

114
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,660
梦中梦 令我大开眼界
Dream within a dream, huh? I'm impressed.

115
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,430
不过在我梦中 必须按我规矩
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

116
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,870
没错 不过 齐藤先生
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

117
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,440
我们并非在你梦中
We're not in your dream.

118
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,170
而是在我梦中
We're in mine.

119
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,210
蠢材 你搞错了地毯
Asshole. How do you mess up the carpet?

120
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,690
- 不关我事 - 你是造梦师
- It wasn't my fault. - You're the architect.

121
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,990
我哪料到他能认出地毯材质
I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

122
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,250
够了
That's enough.

123
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,890
究竟怎样了
You. What the hell was all that?

124
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,270
- 皆在我掌握之中 - 你千万别失控
- I have it under control. - I'd hate to see you out of control.

125
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,200
没时间说这个 我在京都站下车
We don't have time for this. I'm getting off at Kyoto.

126
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,200
他不会搜索每节车厢
He's not gonna check every compartment.

127
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,000
总言之我不喜欢坐火车
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

128
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,940
各位各自保重
Listen. Every man for himself.

129
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,310
喂
Yes, hello?

130
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,120
- 嗨 爹地 - 嗨 爹
- Hi, Daddy. - Hi, Dad.

131
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,250
还好吗 在做什么
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you? How you doing, huh?

132
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,660
- 安好 - 还行
- Good. - Okay, I guess.

133
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,560
谁还行 是吉姆斯吗
Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James?

134
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,640
爸爸 你几时回家
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?

135
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,270
我一时之间不能回家
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't. Not for a while, remember?

136
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,780
为什么?
Why?

137
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,680
因为我要在这里工作
Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?

138
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,820
祖母说你不会回来
Grandma says you're never coming back.

139
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,390
是菲丽吗
Phillipa, is that you?

140
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,690
让祖母听电话
Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?

141
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,560
她不想同你聊
She's shaking her head.

142
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,190
总言之我会回家
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

143
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,260
爸爸
Daddy?

144
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,990
怎么啦 吉姆斯
Yeah, James?

145
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,830
妈妈和你在一起吗
Is Mommy with you?

146
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,670
吉姆斯 别旧事重提
James, we talked about this.

147
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,310
妈妈已不在世
Mommy's not here anymore.

148
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,610
去哪了
Where?

149
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,980
孩子们 该挂电话了
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

150
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,180
我会让外公捎带礼物给你们
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?

151
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,380
记住听话
And you be good, you be...

152
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,100
- 我们的飞机在屋顶 - 好
- Our ride's on the roof. - Right.

153
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,440
没事吧
Hey, are you okay?

154
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,480
没事 怎么?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

155
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,080
梅尔又在梦中出现
Well, down in the dream, Mal showing up.

156
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,480
- 拖累大家 甚感抱歉 - 以后不会了
- Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg. - Won't happen again.

157
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,250
- 情况越严重? - 我都道歉了
- It's getting worse, isn't it? - One apology's all you're getting, all right?

158
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,890
- 阿立在哪 - 还没到 要等吗
- Where's Nash? - He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

159
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,530
两小时前就该向康博公司
We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans...

160
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,460
报告计划进展
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.

161
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,860
他们现该知道我们失败 该逃命了
By now, they know we failed. It's time we disappear.

162
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,890
- 你要去哪 - 布宜诺斯艾利斯
- Where you gonna go? - Buenos Aires.

163
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,340
我先暂避风头 事后再谋生计 你呢
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?

164
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,700
美国
Stateside.

165
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,400
代我向家人问好
Send my regards.

166
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,310
他出卖你们 全盘托出以求苟活
He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.

167
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,290
给机会你们以手还手
So I offer you the satisfaction.

168
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,760
这不合我处事原则
It's not the way I deal with things.

169
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,910
- 你打算怎么处置他 - 没打算
- What will you do with him? - Nothing.

170
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,810
但我不担保康博公司会怎么处置你们
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

171
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,320
- 你想要我们做什么? - 植入意念
- What do you want from us? - Inception.

172
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,340
- 能做到吗 - 不可能
- Is it possible? - Of course not.

173
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,700
若能潜入梦境盜取意识
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind...

174
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,740
为何不能植入意念
...why can't you plant one there instead?

175
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,000
让我们给你植入意念
Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.

176
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,480
比如[别想大象」 你会联想到什么
I say, "Don't think about elephants." What are you thinking about?

177
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,670
大象
Elephants.

178
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,010
但这是我们给你的意念
Right. But it's not your idea, because you know I gave it to you.

179
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,190
人的意识往往会去探寻意念的源头
The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.

180
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,550
- 无可能导入假的意念 - 不一定
- True inspiration's impossible to fake. - That's not true.

181
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,190
- 你能实现? - 若你帮我脱险
- Can you do it? - Are you offering me a choice?

182
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,030
帮我避开康博公司的追杀
Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.

183
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,230
你似乎没有选择余地
Then you do have a choice.

184
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,170
那我可选择不干
Then I choose to leave, sir.

185
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,770
告诉机务人员你们要去哪
Tell the crew where you want to go.

186
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,110
好 柯布先生
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

187
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,350
想回家吗
How would you like to go home?

188
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,460
回去美国 陪在孩子身边?
To America. To your children.

189
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,230
你没可能做到
You can't fix that. No one can.

190
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,630
- 就像植入意念 - 快
- Just like inception. - Cobb, come on.

191
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,270
- 要植入的意念有多复杂 - 很简单
- How complex is the idea? - Simple enough.

192
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,970
要植入一个意念 没有简单一说
No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.

193
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,870
我主要竞争对手是個垂死的老翁
My main competitor is an old man in poor health.

194
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,820
他儿子很快要继承公司
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.

195
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,280
我要他解散他令尊的公司
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.

196
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,650
- 柯布 我们不要插手这事 - 稍等
- Cobb, we should walk away from this. - Hold on.

197
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,000
我帮你做事
If I were to do this, if I even could do it...

198
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,070
但我需要证明
...I'd need a guarantee.

199
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,500
- 证明你能帮我洗脱罪名 - 证明不到
- How do I know you can deliver? - You don't.

200
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,570
不过我可以保证
But I can.

201
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,740
你是选择孤注一掷
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

202
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,010
抑或抱恨终身
...or become an old man, filled with regret...

203
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,780
直至终老?
...waiting to die alone?

204
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,160
柯布先生 组建团队 慎重选人
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely.

205
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,100
我深知你归家心切
Look, I know how much you wanna go home.

206
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,640
但不可能植入意念
This can't be done.

207
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,070
行的 只要潜梦够深
Yes, it can. Just have to go deep enough.

208
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,800
何以得知
You don't know that.

209
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,980
我试过
I've done it before.

210
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,350
你对谁动手
Who'd you do it to?

211
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,580
为什么去巴黎
Why are we going to Paris?

212
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,890
我们需要新的造梦师
We're gonna need a new architect.

213
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,760
其实你从不喜欢待在办公室 对吧?
You never did like your office, did you?

214
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,600
人太多就没法思考
No space to think in that broom cupboard.

215
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,710
待在这儿对你来说安全吗
Is it safe for you to be here?

216
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,350
官僚主义对法国和美国間的引渡条约
Extradition between France and the United States...

217
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,750
根本没有办法
...is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.

218
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,650
我觉得他们会想办法引渡你
I think they might find a way to make it work in your case.

219
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,320
我买了些礼物 有机会你捎带给小孩
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance.

220
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,090
单凭送玩具
It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal...

221
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,230
就尽到为人父亲之责?
...to convince those children they still have a father.

222
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,230
我只是做我应该做的 你亦是这样教我
I'm just doing what I know. I'm doing what you taught me.

223
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,930
我没有教子为贼
I never taught you to be a thief.

224
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,300
你教我操纵人的意识
No, you taught me to navigate people's minds.

225
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,770
之后呢?
But after what happened...

226
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,500
现在这种手法却被认为不合法
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.

227
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,140
你前来做什么
What are you doing here, Dom?

228
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,660
我想已找到归途
I think I found a way home.

229
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,390
我帮一个位高权重之人做事
It's a job for some very, very powerful people.

230
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,030
他可以帮我撤销控罪
People who I believe can fix my charges permanently.

231
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,100
但我需要你帮忙
But I need your help.

232
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,100
你想来误我学生前程?
You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.

233
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,170
他们可以自行决定是否加入
You know what I'm offering. Let them decide for themselves.

234
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,810
- 钱财 - 不只是钱财
- Money. - Not just money.

235
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,310
你心知肚明
You remember.

236
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,710
他们有机会建造教堂、城市
It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities...

237
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,650
一系列不存在
...things that never existed...

238
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,010
现实不存在的事物
...things that couldn't exist in the real world.

239
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,350
你要我物色一个人与你潜入
So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?

240
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,490
他们不是真的进入梦空间
They don't actually come into the dream.

241
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,930
他们只是构建梦空间的层次和告诉做梦者
They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

242
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,330
你自己不动手?
Design it yourself.

243
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,490
梅尔会阻止我
Mal won't let me.

244
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,840
别痴人说梦
Come back to reality, Dom.

245
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,740
- 现实点 - 现实
- Please. - Reality.

246
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,640
现实是你的孙儿
Those kids, your grandchildren...

247
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,810
正等待父亲归家
...they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.

248
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,190
这项最后任务 事成便能回家
And this job, this last job, that's how I get there.

249
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,360
若有他法 亦不会苦苦哀求你
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.

250
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,430
我需要个和我同等级数的造梦师
I need an architect who's as good as I was.

251
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,630
有个比你还厉害
I've got somebody better.

252
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,830
阿丽雅德妮?
Ariadne?

253
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,970
认识下柯布先生
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

254
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,470
好荣幸认识你
Pleased to meet you.

255
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,310
若你有时间 柯布先生想要你接一份差事
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

256
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,510
你有空缺
A work placement?

257
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,220
不算是
Not exactly.

258
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,720
先考验你
I have a test for you.

259
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,520
先告诉我工作内容
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

260
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,320
讲之前 我要了解你能否胜任
Before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it.

261
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,700
- 为什么 - 严格来说此工作不合法
- Why? - It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

262
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,470
两分钟设计个需要一分钟破解的迷宫
You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.

263
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,540
停
Stop.

264
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,180
再来
Again.

265
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,650
停
Stop.

266
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,880
你可以做得更好
You're gonna have to do better than that.

267
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,170
挺像样
That's more like it.

268
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,260
当我们处于清醒状态时
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential.

269
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,120
我们只利用一小部分意识潜能
Now, that's when we're awake.

270
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,270
处于睡眠时 意识便能略有所展
When we're asleep, our mind can do almost anything.

271
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,460
例如
Such as?

272
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,630
想象你在设计楼宇 你有意识地设计每个细节
Imagine you're designing a building. You consciously create each aspect.

273
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,640
有时会觉得楼宇是一气呵成 明白吗
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself, if you know what I mean.

274
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,780
就像在不断发现
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

275
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,210
发现真正的灵感 对吧?
Genuine inspiration, right?

276
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,710
梦中 我们的意识不停活动
Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this.

277
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,520
同时创造和认知我们的精神世界
We create and perceive our world simultaneously.

278
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,090
过程如此畅顺 令人毫不知情
And our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.

279
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,990
因此我们有机会趁机入侵
That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.

280
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,530
- 怎么入侵? - 我们主导构造梦空间
- How? - By taking over the creating part.

281
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,330
所以才需要你
Now, this is where I need you.

282
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,870
你创造梦空间
You create the world of the dream.

283
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:55,410
我们将目标带进来 令其迁移意识到此
We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.

284
00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:00,240
梦境如何设计才令他们相信置身现实
How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?

285
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,870
发梦时总觉得是真的 对吧?
Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right?

286
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,750
梦醒时顿觉不妥
It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.

287
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,620
问你个问题
Let me ask you a question.

288
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,190
你不会记得梦是如何开始?
You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?

289
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,390
你总是出现于梦进展的中部
You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.

290
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,590
是
I guess, yeah.

291
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,320
那为什么我们会在这
So how did we end up here?

292
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,790
我们是从...
Well, we just came from the, uh...

293
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,440
好好想想 你怎么到这的
Think about it, Ariadne. How did you get here?

294
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,940
这是哪里
Where are you right now?

295
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,410
我们在梦中?
We're dreaming?

296
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,010
其实你在工作室睡着了
You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping.

297
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,150
这是共进梦空间的第一课 保持镇静
This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

298
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,620
若只是梦 那为什么你...
If it's just a dream, then why are you...?

299
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,470
不止梦那么简单 对吧
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

300
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,240
当你面前充满碎片 如置身地狱 感觉亦真亦幻
And a face full of glass hurts like hell. When you're in it, it feels real.

301
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,830
这是军队研发的技术
That's why the military developed dream sharing.

302
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,700
用来训练士兵射击、刺杀、束缚
It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

303
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,000
等格斗技法
...and then wake up.

304
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,100
造梦师的任务是什么?
How did architects become involved?

305
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,010
我们需要有人来设计梦空间
Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?

306
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,480
我们再试一次五分钟的梦
Why don't you give us another five minutes?

307
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,740
五分钟?
Five minutes?

308
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,450
刚刚在梦里至少聊一小时
What...? We were talking for, like, at least an hour.

309
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,850
在梦中人脑运作迅速
In a dream, your mind functions more quickly...

310
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,860
所以感觉时间过得较慢
...therefore time seems to feel more slow.

311
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,390
现实五分钟等于梦中一小时
Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.

312
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,190
要不要试试五分钟内妳能做多少事
Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?

313
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,040
基本布局有书店、咖啡室
You've got the basic layout. Bookstore, cafe.

314
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,870
大致差不多
Almost everything else is here too.

315
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,980
- 这些人? - 我的潜意识投射影子
- Who are the people? - Projections of my subconscious.

316
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,310
- 你? - 是
- Yours? - Yes.

317
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,010
你是造梦师 你创建这个梦境
Remember, you are the dreamer. You build this world.

318
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,850
我是目标人物 我的意识会迁移到此
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

319
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,920
你可以跟我的潜意识交流
You can literally talk to my subconscious.

320
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,990
这是一种意识盗取的方法
That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.

321
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,420
你还能做什么?
How else do you do it?

322
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,590
可建造某安全地方 银行保险库或监狱
By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail.

323
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,500
意识会不知不觉将保密的信息放进去
The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.

324
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,430
- 明白吗 - 然后你就入侵盗取
- You understand? - Then you break in and steal it?

325
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,630
嗯
Well...

326
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,300
本以为梦空间与现实大致相似便可
I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual...

327
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,340
且料更要有令人现实感触般的感觉
...but it's more about the feel of it.

328
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,940
若颠覆物理规则 会发生什么事?
My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?

329
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,850
神乎其技
It's something, isn't it?

330
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,260
是
Yes, it is.

331
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,710
为什么他们都望着我
Why are they all looking at me?

332
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,380
因我的潜意识察觉此梦空间是入侵者建造
Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.

333
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,860
梦空间变化幅度越大 影子们就越会关注你
The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you.

334
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,090
关注?
Converge?

335
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,320
影子们察觉到入侵者
They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.

336
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,160
影子们便如白血球攻击病毒般攻击你
They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection.

337
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,170
- 影子们要攻击我们 - 不是
- What, they're gonna attack us? - No, no.

338
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,300
是攻击你
Just you.

339
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,480
好极 我告诫过你 继续改变梦空间
This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this...

340
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,950
叫你潜意识放松点
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?

341
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,780
那是潜意识 非人为控制
It's my subconscious. Remember? I can't control it.

342
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,810
神乎其技
Very impressive.

343
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,080
我见过这座桥 真有此桥
I know this bridge. This place is real, isn't it?

344
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,590
我每日都穿过此桥上学
Yeah, I cross it every day to get to the college.

345
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,200
千万别利用真实记忆创造梦空间 要凭空想象
Never re-create places from your memory. Always imagine new places.

346
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,200
但一般都从熟悉的事物开始创作
You draw from stuff you know, right?

347
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,570
细节可用真实记忆填补 但别全盘照搬
Only use details. A streetlamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

348
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,870
- 为什么不行? - 用真实记忆创造梦空间
- Why not? - Building a dream from your memory...

349
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,530
极易令你真幻难分
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.

350
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,770
- 你试过? - 告诫你
- Is that what happened to you? - Listen to me.

351
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,940
做好你的份内事
This has nothing to do with me, understand?

352
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,090
所以才让我当你的造梦师
That why you need me to build your dreams?

353
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,780
别动她 退后
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.

354
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,580
- 柯布 - 放开她
- Cobb! Cobb! - Get off of her!

355
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,690
- 放开我 - 梅尔
- Let me go! Let me go! - Mal!

356
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,290
- 梅尔 - 柯布 清醒
- Mal! - Cobb! Wake me up!

357
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,260
醒醒
- Wake me up! Wake me up! - No!

358
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,920
- 梅尔 不要 - 我要醒
- Mal, no! No! - Wake me up!

359
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,530
没事啦
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. You're okay. You're okay.

360
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,940
- 嘿 - 为什么我醒不过来
- Hey. - Why wouldn't I wake up?

361
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,830
因校定的时间没到
There was still time on the clock.

362
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,540
除非你在梦中身亡
You can't wake up from within the dream unless you die.

363
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,300
- 她需要个标记 - 什么东西
- She'll need a totem. - What?

364
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,950
标记是...
A totem, it's a small personal...

365
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,640
全拜你潜意识所赐
That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!

366
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,650
那女人很凶
- She's a real charmer. - Oh.

367
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,450
- 你遇见了柯布太太 - 是他内人
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb. - She's his wife?

368
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,350
你需要标记 能帮你分辨梦境
Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy.

369
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,000
只有自己才知道其为何物
Something you can have on you that no one else knows.

370
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,430
- 硬币? - 不是
- Like a coin? - No.

371
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,230
要独一无二 比如特制骰子
It needs to be more unique than that. Like, this is a loaded die.

372
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,240
不能让你碰 不然就不起作用
No, I can't let you touch it. That would defeat the purpose.

373
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,610
只有我知道这骰子的平衡方式和重量
See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.

374
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,610
只要检查你的标记
That way, when you look at your totem...

375
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,870
可以确定是不是在别人的梦里
...you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.

376
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,620
不知道你是真不觉得还是假装不觉得
I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to...

377
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,320
柯布有很严重的问题 他想要葬身潜意识
...but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.

378
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,430
我不允许这样的人进入我意识
And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.

379
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,970
她会回来 阿丽雅德妮很有天赋
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.

380
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:46,640
当现实无法满足她 便会回来
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now, and when she comes back...

381
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,980
当她回来 你得教她建迷宫
When she comes back, you're gonna have her building mazes.

382
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,410
- 你去哪 - 我要拜访奕祠
- Where are you gonna be? - I gotta go visit Eames.

383
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,710
奕祠? 他在蒙巴萨 是康柏公司的据点
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa. It's Cobol's back yard.

384
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,480
值得冒险
It's a necessary risk.

385
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,120
- 有很多厉害的盗梦者 - 不止需要盗梦者
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves. - We don't just need a thief.

386
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,290
我们需要伪变术士
We need a forger.

387
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,560
玩这个很难有赚
Rub them together all you want, they're not gonna breed.

388
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,170
说不准
You never know.

389
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,140
请你喝杯
I'm gonna get you a drink.

390
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,680
好
You're buying.

391
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,450
- 你的拼写还是没进步 - 收声
- Your spelling hasn't improved. - Piss off.

392
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,590
书写呢
How's your handwriting?

393
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,590
- 没人能及 - 好
- It's versatile. - Good.

394
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,990
谢谢
Thank you very much.

395
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,030
植入意念
Inception.

396
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,100
不要跟我说不可能
Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible, let me...

397
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,570
万事皆有可能 只是很难成功
No, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult.

398
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,000
有意思 缘因亚瑟坚持认为不可能
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.

399
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,410
亚瑟? 你还和他共事?
Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud?

400
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,270
他精于所善 不是吗?
He is good at what he does, right?

401
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,510
不错 就是没有想象力
Oh, he's the best, but he has no imagination.

402
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,710
不像你
Not like you.

403
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,850
若要植入意念 需要有想象力
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception, you need imagination.

404
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,580
你以前做过植入意念吗
Let me ask you something. Have you done it before?

405
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,390
我们试过将意念植进去 但目标没接受
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn't take.

406
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,890
- 植入不够深? - 不是深度的问题
- You didn't plant it deep enough? - No, it's not just about depth.

407
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,060
所植入到意念信息要够简单
You need the simplest version of the idea...

408
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,900
自然而然令目标接受此意念
...in order for it to grow naturally in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

409
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,600
你要植入的是什么意念
So, what is this idea that you need to plant?

410
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,970
我们要让个继承人解散其尊的家业
We need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father's empire.

411
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,580
你可以找一堆政治动机
Right there you have various political motivations...

412
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,740
还有反垄断观点之类
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth.

413
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,750
不过一切都
But all of that stuff, it's, um...

414
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,790
按照目标个人喜好而定
It's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice, you see?

415
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,450
从最基本动手
What you have to do is start at the absolute basic.

416
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,180
最基本?
Which is what?

417
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,590
父子关系
The relationship with the father.

418
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,460
- 有药剂师吗? - 还没找到
- Do you have a chemist? - No, not yet.

419
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,690
我有人选推荐 佑沭
Right. Okay, well, there's a man here, Yusuf.

420
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,300
他有很多独门药剂秘方
He, uh, formulates his own versions of the compounds.

421
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,770
快引荐我
Why don't you take me there?

422
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,000
先甩掉那个跟踪你的人 吧台的那个男人
Once you've lost your tail. The man at the bar.

423
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,640
康博公司派来的
Cobol Engineering.

424
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,140
追缉令是留命还是留尸
That price on my head, was that dead or alive?

425
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,840
忘了 不知道会不会开枪
Don't remember. Let's see if he starts shooting.

426
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:07,650
你负责引开他们的注意力 半小时后在楼下酒吧会合
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?

427
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,810
- 回到这里? - 最危险之地亦是最安全
- Back here? - This is the last place they'd suspect.

428
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,690
好
All right.

429
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,690
非迪 你是非迪?
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

430
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,330
肯定是你
My God, it's you, isn't it?

431
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,930
我认错人
No, it isn't you.

432
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,540
你以为仍在梦空间啊
Not dreaming now, are you?

433
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,330
捉住他
Get him!

434
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,980
这里
There!

435
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,240
要杯咖啡
One cafe.

436
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,860
要杯咖啡
One cafe.

437
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,360
要杯咖啡
One cafe.

438
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,420
上车 柯布
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

439
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,120
- 你来蒙巴萨干嘛 - 我来保护我的投资
- What are you doing in Mombasa? - I'm here to protect my investment.

440
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,560
你就是用此法甩掉跟尾?
Ah. So this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?

441
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,750
简直死缠烂打
Different tail.

442
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,200
柯布说你回来
Cobb said you'd be back.

443
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,870
- 我也想不来 但... - 但其他没有如此刺激
- I tried not to come, but... - But there's nothing quite like it.

444
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,710
我只是
It's just...

445
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,550
纯粹创建
...pure creation.

446
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,210
我们来看看一些似非而是的建筑物
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?

447
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,380
若你要建立三个完整层次的梦空间
You're gonna have to master a few tricks...

448
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,080
你须要掌握一些窍门
...if you're gonna build three complete dream levels. Excuse me.

449
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,690
什么窍门
What kind of tricks?

450
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:04,350
在梦空间 你可天马行空设计建筑物
In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.

451
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,430
以于创造封闭式循环 如彭罗斯楼梯
That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps.

452
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,290
无尽之阶
The infinite staircase.

453
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,440
清楚吗
See?

454
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,670
似非而是
Paradox.

455
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,250
封闭式循环可以
So a closed loop like that...

456
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,510
助你隐藏梦空间的边境
...will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.

457
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,650
要弄多大的梦空间
But how big do these levels have to be?

458
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,950
可以小如一层楼宇 大如整个城市
It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.

459
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,560
但是结构需要复杂 才能令我们避开意识影子
They have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projections.

460
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,130
- 像迷宫? - 像个迷宫
- A maze? - Right, a maze.

461
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,630
迷宫越复杂
And the better the maze...

462
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,490
便能有更长时间避开影子攻击
Then the longer we have before the projections catch us?

463
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,930
没错
Exactly.

464
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,230
- 我潜意识看起来挺镇静 - 好话莫早说
- My subconscious seems polite enough. - Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

465
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,310
没人喜欢潜意识被入侵
No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.

466
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,570
柯布无法再建造梦空间?
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

467
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,240
关键是他不想
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

468
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,810
他觉得不知道梦空间布局反而对大家好
He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.

469
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,080
为什么
Why?

470
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,480
他没说 我猜是基于梅尔的缘故
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

471
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,220
- 他前妻? - 不是前妻
- His ex-wife? - No, not his ex.

472
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,550
- 他们至今还一起? - 不是
- They're still together? - No.

473
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,280
梅尔已经不在人世
No, she's dead.

474
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,990
你那时看到的 只是个投射影子
What you see in there is just his projection of her.

475
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,000
她在现实中是个什么样的人
What was she like in real life?

476
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,200
很可爱
She was lovely.

477
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,280
- 你在物色药剂师? - 是的
- You are seeking a chemist? - Yes.

478
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,570
配制任务要用到的药物?
To formulate compounds for a job?

479
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,120
还要我们同起进入梦空间
And to go into the field with us.

480
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,520
我不会进入梦空间
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

481
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,420
需实地考察才能配置出我们想要的药剂
Well, we'd need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs.

482
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,690
- 实地考察? - 深度梦空间
- Which are? - Great depth.

483
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,130
梦中梦? 两层?
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

484
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:48,920
三层
Three.

485
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,660
不可能 如斯多层次 梦空间会不稳定
Not possible. That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.

486
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,800
只要有镇静剂便成事
It is possible. You just have to add a sedative.

487
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,640
应该是强力镇静剂
A powerful sedative.

488
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,680
- 有多少个组员 - 五个
- How many team members? - Five.

489
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,580
六个
Six.

490
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,480
我也要进去 以便验收任务
The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.

491
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,750
这项任务不适合你参与
There's no room for tourists on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

492
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,290
就这样决定
This time, it seems there is.

493
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,960
我每天都在用这个 效果不错
This, I think, is a good place to start. I use it every day.

494
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,260
- 你用来干嘛 - 来看看
- What for? - Here, I'll show you.

495
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,300
还是不看为妙
Perhaps you will not want to see.

496
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,840
请带路
After you.

497
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,150
十、十二个 都连在一起
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.

498
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,090
他们每日都来此共进梦空间
They come every day to share the dream.

499
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,690
看 梦空间很稳定
You see? Very stable.

500
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,470
- 他们要做多久梦 - 每日三、四小时
- How long do they dream for? - Three, four hours, each day.

501
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,770
梦空间时间呢?
In dream time?

502
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,610
有这种配方 大概每日四十小时
With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day.

503
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:12,080
- 他们为什么做这个 - 柯布 告诉他
- Why do they do it? - Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

504
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,050
持之以恒的话 便只能以此方式做梦
After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream.

505
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,160
你还会做梦吗 柯布先生
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

506
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,190
- 他们每天来此入睡 - 不是
- They come here every day to sleep? - No.

507
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,630
来此是为等待被唤醒
They come to be woken up.

508
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,930
梦已成为他们的现实世界
The dream has become their reality.

509
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,240
所言不虚吧?
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

510
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,170
还是亲身体验为实
Let's see what you can do.

511
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,750
你知道如何找到我
You know how to find me.

512
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,350
你知道应该如何是好
You know what you have to do.

513
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,660
满意吧
Sharp, no?

514
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,080
柯布先生 没事吧
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

515
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,390
没事
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

516
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,530
费舍尔·非榭 非榭能源公司的继承人
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.

517
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,600
你与这位非榭先生有什么过节?
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

518
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,360
不关你事
That's not your concern.

519
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:45,140
齐藤先生 这不是你常用的商业间谍手段
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical corporate espionage.

520
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,900
是你要求我植入意念
You asked me for inception.

521
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:50,450
你要明白实行要求的后果
I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.

522
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:54,580
一旦在人的思想播种 便会发展为意念
Now, the seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

523
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,620
此意念会左右他
This idea will define him.

524
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,620
会改变...
It may come to change...

525
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,090
可能会改变他的一生
Well, it may come to change everything about him.

526
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:05,590
我司是唯一一间阻挡非榭能源公司垄断能源
We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.

527
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,820
不过我司以无抵抗之力
And we can no longer compete.

528
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,460
很快 非榭能源公司 会控制半个世界的能源供应
Soon, they'll control the energy supply of half the world.

529
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,000
最终非榭能源公司会成为大赢家
In effect, they become a new superpower.

530
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,740
总言之要令费舍尔改变想法
The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.

531
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,470
所以才需要我们
That's where we come in.

532
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,910
费舍尔与其父的关系如何
How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?

533
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,810
传闻话关系甚为复杂
Rumor is the relationship is quite complicated.

534
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,480
传闻不足为信
Well, we can't work based solely on rumor, can we?

535
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,850
有办法帮我接近布宁吗
Can you get me access to this man here? Browning.

536
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,190
费舍尔其父的得力助手 亦是费舍尔的教父
Fischer Senior's right-hand man. Fischer Junior's godfather.

537
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,630
应该可以 只要弄到有力的推荐书
It should be possible, if you can get the right references.

538
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:45,260
弄推荐书是我专长
References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

539
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,840
我不能对此案一笑置之 告倒他们
I'm not smelling settlement here. Take them down.

540
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,100
布宁先生
Mr. Browning...

541
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,110
麦利·非榭的政策倾向于回避诉讼
...Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation.

542
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:01,140
要不要直接跟麦利先生面谈
Well, shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly?

543
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,720
无此必要
Not sure that's necessary.

544
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,550
我觉得有必要
No, no, no. I think we should.

545
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,400
他怎样了
How is he?

546
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,010
若无必要 我不想打扰他
I don't want to bother him unnecessarily, but...

547
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:37,650
费舍尔 我告诫你不要来这里
Robert, I told you keep out the damn... Wait. So do it. Get...

548
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:41,020
- 非榭先生 - 听好了
- Mr. Fischer. - Put it through.

549
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,990
我没下令不准让他来
Never, never. Never do the same as I asked.

550
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:47,960
离开
Leave that.

551
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,040
这里
Here.

552
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,710
那定是他宝贵的回忆
Must be a cherished memory of his.

553
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,340
我摆放在他床边 他却无心暇顾
I put it beside his bed. He hasn't even noticed.

554
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,180
费舍尔
Robert...

555
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,950
我们要谈谈授权书的问题
...we need to talk about a power of attorney.

556
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,420
- 虽然很难决定 但势在必行 - 现在不行
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative... - Not now, Uncle Peter.

557
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,230
秃鹰虎视眈眈
The vultures are circling.

558
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,800
自从麦利病床 彼得·布宁的权力日益增多
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

559
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,370
我已观察多日
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning...

560
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:31,370
习惯他的外貌特征 行为举止等
... and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

561
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,410
因此梦空间第一层 我会伪装成彼得
So now in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning.

562
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,810
对费舍尔的意识稍作暗示
And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.

563
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,820
接着再带他进第二层
Then, when we take him a level deeper...

564
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,480
他潜意识映射出的彼得会如我们所料行动
...his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.

565
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:46,590
总言之他自己为自己植入意念
So he gives himself the idea.

566
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:50,990
没错 让他自然而然有此意念
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick. It has to seem self-generated.

567
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,560
奕祠 简直叹为观止
Eames, I am impressed.

568
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,290
你所谓的屈尊俯就亦令我叹为观止
Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

569
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,650
你刚刚进入自己的梦空间?
Were you going under on your own?

570
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,320
不 我只是在做些实验
No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments.

571
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,470
我不知道还有人在这
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

572
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,300
我刚才在做我的标记
Yeah, I was just... I was working on my totem, actually.

573
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,630
让我看看
Here, let me take a look.

574
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,100
学得不错
So you're learning, huh?

575
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,770
用标记来析别梦空间是个很好的方法
An elegant solution for keeping track of reality.

576
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,810
- 你想出来的? - 不
- Was it your idea? - No, it was, uh...

577
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,110
是梅尔想出来的
It was Mal's, actually. This...

578
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,580
这个是她的标记 梦中旋转永不倒
This one was hers. She would spin it in the dream and it would never topple.

579
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,690
永无止境地旋转
Just spin and spin.

580
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,160
亚瑟告知我 她已不在人世
Arthur told me she passed away.

581
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,120
迷宫设计得如何
How are the mazes coming along?

582
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,200
梦空间每层都紧紧关联
Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious...

583
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,830
我们将入侵目标的那部份潜意识
...that we are trying to access.

584
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:09,440
最低那层是医院 费舍尔会带其父到来
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so Fischer will bring his father.

585
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,570
不过我对此布局心存怀疑
You know, l... Actually, I have a question about this layout.

586
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:17,480
别告诉我细节 自己知道就行
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics. Only the dreamer should know the layout.

587
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,810
为什么
Why is that so important?

588
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,980
以防我们中有人将自己的潜意识影子带进来
In case one of us brings in our projections.

589
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,490
不能让他们知道迷宫的细节
We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.

590
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,360
你深怕梅尔会进来?
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

591
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,930
你控制不了她 对不
You can't keep her out, can you?

592
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,350
- 对 - 你无法筑梦
- Right. - You can't build...

593
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,830
是因你知道布局 梅尔也会知道
...because if you know the maze, then she knows it.

594
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:38,200
会破坏全局
Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation.

595
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,170
- 柯布 其他人知道吗 - 他们不知道
- Cobb, do the others know? - No. No, they don't.

596
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,570
你定要提醒他们 以免不可收拾
You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.

597
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,680
不会不可收拾
No one said it's getting worse.

598
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:50,180
当务之急 是我要回家
I need to get home. That's all I care about right now.

599
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,110
为什么你不能回家
Why can't you go home?

600
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,250
因为他们认为我杀了她
Because they think I killed her.

601
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,760
- 谢谢 - 干嘛
- Thank you. - For what?

602
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,230
没问我是否杀了她
For not asking whether I did.

603
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,560
我要摧毁家父的家业
"I will split up my father's empire."

604
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,930
很明显 费舍尔不会接受这个意念
Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject...

605
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,900
我们要将意念植入到潜意识深处
...which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious.

606
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,600
潜意识是由情感控制 而非理智?
The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason.

607
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:23,540
我们要将此意念情感化
We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.

608
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,150
怎样将此意念情感化
How do you translate business strategy into emotion?

609
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:29,910
问题关键在于此 至少我们得知
That's what we're here to figure out. Robert's relationship with his father...

610
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,820
- 费舍尔与其父关系紧张 - 何不利用这点
...is stressed, to say the least. - Can we run with that?

611
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,590
我们暗示他摧毁祖业 借以打击其父
We suggest breaking up his father's company as a "screw you" to the old man.

612
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:40,220
不行 我认为负面情感远不及正面情感
No, because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.

613
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,330
应该让他们和解如好
We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis.

614
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:48,270
继而令费舍尔顿悟出此意念
We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.

615
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,270
值得一试
All right, well, try this. Um...

616
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:55,180
[家父接纳我 同时我要另创天地 而非承袭父荫」
"My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

617
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,640
可能行得通
That might work.

618
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:59,980
可能? 须付诸可行
Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than "might."

619
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,120
有劳高见 亚瑟
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

620
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,220
我只是想知道具体点
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.

621
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,520
具体点
Specificity?

622
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,520
不需要植入很具体的意念
Inception's not about being specific.

623
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,650
当我们入侵他意识后 再见机行事
When we get inside his mind, we're gonna have to work with what we find.

624
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,960
在第一层 我们坦诚见谈父子关系
On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father...

625
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,200
[我不会承袭父荫」
...and say, "I will not follow in my father's footsteps."

626
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:25,040
第二层 我们播下[我要另创天地」
Then the next level down, we feed him, "I will create something for myself."

627
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,540
继而最后一层 使出杀手锏
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns.

628
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,110
- [家尊不愿我效他所为」 - 妙极
- "My father doesn't want me to be him." - Exactly.

629
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:36,480
若有一点动静 三层梦空间便会崩毁
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.

630
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:37,820
镇静剂
Sedation.

631
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,820
创造三层梦空间 前提是稳定睡眠状态
For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...

632
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,890
我们需要强力镇静剂
...we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.

633
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,400
晚安
Good night.

634
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,200
用来共进梦空间的配方
The compound we'll be using to share the dream...

635
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:02,310
有助增强做梦者之间的联系
... creates a clear connection between dreamers...

636
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,710
- 同时加速脑部运作 - 总言之 每层的时间会变长
...whilst accelerating brain function. - In other words, more time on each level.

637
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,050
梦空间的脑部运作比平时约快廿倍
Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.

638
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:13,710
当你进入梦中梦 运作速度亦倍增
And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded.

639
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,990
三层梦 所以是平时十小时乘以廿...
It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20...

640
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,060
我不擅长数数 究竟多久
Math was never my strong subject. How much time is that?

641
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,890
第一层约一星期
It's a week, the first level down.

642
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,430
第二层约六个月 至于第三层
Six months the second level down, and the third level...

643
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,040
约十年
That's 10 years.

644
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,840
谁会想困在梦空间十年?
Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?

645
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,400
那要看是什么梦
Depends on the dream.

646
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,880
一旦成功植入 如何撤离梦空间
So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?

647
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,380
有没有比打爆头更文雅的方法
I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.

648
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,320
- 堕醒 - 什么是堕醒
- A kick. - What's a kick?

649
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,180
阿丽雅德妮 这就是堕醒
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

650
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,020
坠落摇晃直到清醒
It's that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake.

651
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:53,430
- 瞬间醒梦 - 服用镇静剂 堕醒仍有效吗?
- Snaps you out of the dream. - We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

652
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:54,790
关键所在
That's the clever part.

653
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:58,200
我特制的镇静剂不会削弱听觉功能
I customized the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired.

654
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,210
无论如斯好睡 亦可感受到坠落感
That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling.

655
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,740
或者是翻倒
Or tipping.

656
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:10,540
实施堕醒同步化三层梦空间
The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.

657
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,610
可用音乐来倒计不同层次的堕醒
We could use a musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.

658
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,990
他最近没有预约手术 甚至预约牙医也没有
He hasn't got any surgery scheduled, no dental, nothing.

659
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,160
他本来不是要做膝关节手术?
Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?

660
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,560
找不到任何机会令他昏睡
Nothing. Nothing that they'll put him under for, anyway. And we need...

661
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,670
我们至少需要十小时
We need at least a good 10 hours.

662
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,170
悉尼飞往洛杉矶
Sydney to Los Angeles.

663
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,770
世上最长航线之一 他每两周要来回一次
One of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks.

664
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,110
他一定乘坐私人飞机
He must be flying private, then.

665
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,780
可以安排他的专机进行维修
Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.

666
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,180
- 最好他乘坐波音747 - 为什么
It would have to be a 747. - Why's that?

667
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,820
波音747的驾驶舱在上层
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

668
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,190
头等舱在其后面 闲杂人不得经过
...the first-class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through.

669
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:57,850
要买通机舱员工 包下头等舱
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.

670
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,590
我买下整个航空公司
I bought the airline.

671
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,960
何足挂齿
It seemed neater.

672
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,370
那我们有十小时时间
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

673
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:11,170
阿丽雅德妮 干得好
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

674
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,350
你深知如何找我
You know how to find me.

675
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,260
你深知如何是好
You know what you have to do.

676
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,560
仍记得你求婚时的话语吗
You remember when you asked me to marry you?

677
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,460
仍记得
Of course I do.

678
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,060
你说你梦见
You said you had a dream.

679
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,780
梦见我们白头偕老
That we'd grow old together.

680
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,910
我们皆可实现
And we can.

681
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,530
你不该在这
You shouldn't be here.

682
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:42,760
我只想知道你每晚独在这做什么实验
Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.

683
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,130
- 不关你事 - 当然关我事
- This has nothing to do with you. - This has everything to do with me.

684
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:52,110
- 是你叫我跟你共进梦空间 - 不是这些 这些是我自己的梦
- You've asked me to share dreams with you. - Not these. These are my dreams.

685
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,390
为何如斯困磨自己?
Why do you do this to yourself?

686
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,490
唯有此法我才能做梦
It's the only way I can still dream.

687
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,460
作梦有这么重要吗
Why is it so important to dream?

688
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,630
只有在梦中我们才在一起
In my dreams, we're still together.

689
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,710
并非梦般简单
These aren't just dreams.

690
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:36,540
这是你的记忆 你说过永不要用真实记忆创造梦空间
These are memories. And you said never to use memories.

691
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,780
我明白
I know I did.

692
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:42,950
你接受不到事实 你对她念念不忘
You're trying to keep her alive. You can't let her go.

693
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,120
你永不感受到 如斯时刻令我后悔莫及
You don't understand. These are moments I regret.

694
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,860
如斯回忆令我欲变难求
They're memories that I have to change.

695
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,570
下面是?
Well, what's down there that you regret?

696
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,100
你只需要明白一件事
Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me.

697
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,170
这是你家?
This is your house?

698
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,320
我和梅尔的家
Mine and Mal's, yes.

699
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,180
她在哪
Where is she?

700
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,850
她已经走
She's already gone.

701
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,120
这是我儿子 吉姆斯
That's my son, James.

702
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,390
他总喜欢掘蚯蚓之类
He's digging for something, maybe a worm.

703
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:25,900
这是菲丽
That's Phillipa.

704
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:28,300
我总想和他们
I thought about calling out to them...

705
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,240
齐享天伦之乐
...so they'd turn and smile and I could see...

706
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:37,070
可惜为时已晚
...those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late.

707
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,080
此时不走更待何时
Right now or never, Cobb.

708
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,350
此时我开始心乱
Then I start to panic.

709
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:49,220
最后一次再续天伦之乐
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...

710
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,390
否则我会遗恨终生
...that I need to see their faces one last time.

711
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:55,060
吉姆斯 菲丽 过来
James! Phillipa! Come on in!

712
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,260
时过境迁
But the moment's past.

713
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,840
纵使力挽狂澜 亦是无法挽回
And whatever I do, I can't change this moment.

714
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,900
当我呼叫他们之际
As I'm about to call out to them...

715
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,040
他们却远离我
...they run away.

716
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:14,050
若重拾旧景 我誓要回家
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again, I've gotta get back home.

717
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,580
而非凭梦牵挂
The real world.

718
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,630
你在这干嘛
What are you doing here?

719
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,560
我是
My name is...

720
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:05,030
我认识你 但你在干嘛
I know who you are. What are you doing here?

721
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,650
我只是想明白
I'm just trying to understand.

722
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,940
你无法明白
How could you understand?

723
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,280
明白何为两情相悦吗
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

724
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,420
明白何为命里佳人吗
To be half of a whole?

725
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,220
不明白
No.

726
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,690
猜个谜语
I'll tell you a riddle.

727
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,460
你等待一列火车
You're waiting for a train.

728
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:39,660
火车将带你远去他方
A train that will take you far away.

729
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,010
你深知前去何方
You know where you hope this train will take you...

730
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,310
同时你亦忧虑能否到达
...but you don't know for sure.

731
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:49,380
不过无关紧要
But it doesn't matter.

732
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,750
为何不著紧前往何方?
How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?

733
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,680
彼此相聚已胜一切
Because you'll be together.

734
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,820
- 柯布 为什么她会在这 - 这是哪
- How could you bring her here, Dom? - What is this place?

735
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,390
这是我们旧时庆祝结婚纪念日的酒店套房
This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary.

736
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,890
这里发生过什么
What happened here?

737
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,630
你说过我们会长厢思守
You promised! You promised we'd be together!

738
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,130
请你暂时留守于此
Please, I need you to stay here just for now!

739
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:15,530
你说我们要执子之手 与子偕老
You said we'd be together! You said we'd grow old together!

740
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,180
我会回来找你
I'll come back for you. I promise.

741
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,760
你真认为建个记忆监狱能关住她?
Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?

742
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,770
你真认为这样能困住她
Do you really think that that's gonna contain her?

743
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,930
是时候
It's time.

744
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:50,500
麦利·非榭刚在悉尼过逝
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

745
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,840
- 几时举行葬礼 - 星期二 于洛杉矶
- When's the funeral? - Thursday. In Los Angeles.

746
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,280
费舍尔最迟星期二要去送葬 我们要行动
Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.

747
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,910
好极
All right.

748
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,540
- 我陪同你去 - 不行
- Cobb, I'm coming with you. - I promised Miles. No.

749
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:04,850
队中得有人知道你的处境
The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.

750
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,590
不一定非我不可
And it doesn't have to be me...

751
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:13,060
你亦可以告知亚瑟一切
...but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.

752
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,530
再安插个座位
Get us another seat on the plane.

753
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,640
若我登上航班 你又不承诺协定
If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement...

754
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:31,480
登陆后 我就要到监狱度过余生
...when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life.

755
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,350
只要完成任务
Complete the job en route...

756
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:36,990
我一声令下
...I make one phone call from the plane...

757
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:40,060
你就可以顺利入境
...you have no trouble getting through Immigration.

758
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,300
- 借过 - 失礼晒
- I'm sorry. - Oh, yeah, absolutely.

759
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,030
有劳
Thank you.

760
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,940
是不是您的 应该是你掉的
Excuse me, I think this is yours? You must have dropped it.

761
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,010
想喝点什么吗
Would you care for a drink?

762
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,480
来杯水
Oh. Water, please.

763
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,950
我也是
Oh, um, same, please.

764
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,050
谢谢
Thank you.

765
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,090
真没法不注意到
You know, I couldn't help but notice...

766
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:50,850
你是否是麦利·非榭的亲眷
...but you wouldn't happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

767
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,520
是
Yes, he, um...

768
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,460
他是我家尊
He was my father.

769
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:59,930
他值万人敬仰 节哀顺便
Well, he was a very inspiring figure. I'm sorry for your loss.

770
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,570
- 给 - 谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

771
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,070
嘿
Hey.

772
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:08,100
敬令尊
To your father.

773
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,940
入土为安
May he rest in peace, huh?

774
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:21,720
- 入梦前就应该如厕 - 抱歉
- Couldn't have peed before you went under? - Sorry.

775
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,950
起飞前香槟喝太多
Bit too much free champagne before takeoff?

776
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,210
所言甚是
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

777
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,360
这种天气他肯定要找出租车
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.

778
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:44,060
- 蠢材 再来一次试试 - 走开
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try...? - Walk away.

779
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,360
通知他...我得走了
Just have him ca... I gotta go.

780
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,650
好极 出租车 有劳
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

781
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:09,460
第三街和汶克路交汇处 快
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.

782
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,370
- 你干嘛 - 抱歉 我还以为空车
- What are you doing? - Sorry, I thought it was free.

783
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:14,030
- 不是 - 或许我们一起坐
- It's not. - Maybe we could share.

784
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:17,040
麻烦靠边停车...
Maybe not. Can you pull over and get this...?

785
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,340
妙极
Great.

786
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,750
快
Come on.

787
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:41,490
这有500块 我钱包还更值钱
There's $500 in there. The wallet's worth more than that.

788
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,360
至少送我到站
You might at least drop me at my stop.

789
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,630
恐怕...
I'm afraid that it doesn't...

790
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,140
- 掩护他 - 快趴下
- Cover him! - Down! Down now!

791
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,940
究竟发生什么事
What the hell is going on?

792
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,920
我没设计这些
This wasn't in the design.

793
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,220
柯布
Cobb?

794
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:07,480
柯布
Cobb?

795
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,600
干掉他
Get him!

796
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:07,720
没事吧
Are you all right?

797
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:10,080
我没事
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

798
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,150
费舍尔没事 除非他晕车
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

799
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:13,550
齐藤?
Saito?

800
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:34,600
把费舍尔关到后屋
Get Fischer in the back room now.

801
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,610
- 关到后屋 - 究竟发生什么事
- Get him in the back room. Move. What the hell happened?

802
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,520
他中枪? 不会死吧?
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

803
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:41,410
- 我不知道 - 天啊
- I don't know. - Jesus Christ.

804
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,020
- 你们遇到什么事了 - 被火车堵住了
- What happened to you? - Blocked by a freight train.

805
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,160
干嘛在市中心放辆火车
Why put a train in a downtown intersection?

806
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:47,920
- 我没有 - 那它从哪来
- I didn't. Where'd it come from?

807
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,750
我们怎么会被袭击
Why the hell were we ambushed?

808
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:53,330
他们绝非普通的影子 个个训练有素
Those were not normal projections. They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

809
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:56,060
- 他怎会受过防御训练? - 费舍尔让盗梦者
- How could he be trained? - Fischer's had an extractor...

810
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,430
教他意识防卫 所以他有潜意识守护者
...teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized.

811
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,230
为什么调查时没发现
It should've shown in the research.

812
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:04,200
- 为什么没发现 - 冷静
Why the hell didn't it? - Calm down.

813
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:05,710
我简直冷静不下
Don't tell me to calm down!

814
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:08,810
这是你的本分事
This was your job, goddamn it! This was your responsibility!

815
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:11,040
你理应调查清楚
You were meant to check Fischer's background!

816
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:14,550
- 我们不知所措 - 之前也遇过类似情况
- We are not prepared for this! - We have dealt with sub-security before!

817
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,810
万事要步步为营
We'll be more careful and we're gonna be fine!

818
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,780
这并不在计划内 他快要死
This was not a part of the plan! He's dying.

819
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,010
让他醒过来吧
Put him out his misery.

820
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,020
- 不要 - 嘿
- No, don't do that! Don't do that. - Cobb, hey, hey.

821
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,290
他很痛苦 我要唤醒他
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

822
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,360
没用的
No. It won't wake him up.

823
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:31,130
什么意思 在梦空间死亡便能苏醒
What do you mean, it won't wake him up? When we die in a dream, we wake up.

824
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:32,560
这次不会
Not from this.

825
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,260
我们处于极度安稳沉睡状态
We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.

826
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,570
那在梦空间死亡会怎样
Right. So, what happens when we die?

827
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,570
- 会掉入潜意识边缘 - 说真的?
- We drop into limbo. - Are you serious?

828
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,270
- 潜意识边缘? - 意识混沌的空间
- Limbo? - Unconstructed dream space.

829
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:45,710
- 那里有什么 - 原始无尽的潜意识
Well, what the hell is down there? - Just raw, infinite subconscious.

830
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:49,080
那里只有曾被困住的人
Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind...

831
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:52,150
所遗留下来的意识
...by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.

832
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,220
看来就你去过
Which, in our case, is just you.

833
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,090
- 我们会被困多久 - 药效失效前
- How long could we be stuck? - Can't even think about...

834
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,660
- 根本无望离开 - 多久
...trying to escape until the sedation... - How long?

835
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,060
几十年 或许永远 问他 他去过
Decades. It could be infinite. Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

836
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,430
抬他上楼
Let's get him upstairs.

837
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,500
好极
Great.

838
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,970
多得你
Thank you.

839
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,910
现在我们困在费舍尔的梦空间 兼进行枪战
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army.

840
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,550
如果我们身亡
And if we get killed...

841
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,940
我们将迷失潜意识边缘直至消失 对吧
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

842
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,690
有人懂得抢救
Someone got first aid?

843
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:33,420
- 你明知有风险却不告诉我们 - 本来不会有风险
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us? - There weren't meant to be risks.

844
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:36,530
- 我怎料到会有枪战　 - 你应该事先告知
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire. - You had no right.

845
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:39,030
只有这样才能潜入三层梦空间
This was the only way to go three layers deep.

846
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,230
你知道这些还跟他一起来
You knew about this and went along with it?

847
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,430
我对他有信心
I trusted him.

848
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,510
他答应给你一半酬劳?
When? When he promised you half his share?

849
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:47,940
是给全部 他以前也试过
No. His whole share. Besides, he said he'd done it before.

850
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,170
以前和梅尔试过? 那次进展很顺利?
What, with Mal? Because that worked so good?

851
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:53,780
两者没关系 我只是一心想见孩子
That has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to to get to my children.

852
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,850
你令我们身陷险境
You led us into a war zone with no way out?

853
01:09:56,030 --> 01:10:00,050
还有办法 我们尽快完成任务
There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

854
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,560
接而如之前般用堕醒方法返回
...and we get out using the kick, just like before.

855
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,190
算了 我们走得越深 危险便越大
Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes.

856
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:07,230
我情愿留在这一层
I am sitting this one out on this level.

857
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,830
费舍尔的意识守护者已包围这里
Fischer's security is surrounding this place.

858
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,260
这一层的一个星期等于十小时飞行时间
Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.

859
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:16,170
这意味着我们难逃被杀
That means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

860
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:20,540
唯有尽快完成任务
We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.

861
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,580
唯今之计就是继续任务
Downwards is the only way forwards.

862
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,280
准备
Get ready.

863
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,650
你跟着来 把他弄醒
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

864
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,520
我投了一千万买绑架保险
I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million.

865
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:40,630
- 应该很容易得手 - 闭嘴
- This should be very simple. Shut up! It won't be.

866
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:43,060
令尊办公室书架下面
In your father's office, below the bookshelves...

867
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,290
有个私人保险箱 我们需要密码
...is his personal safe. We need the combination.

868
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,070
我不清楚
I don't know any safe.

869
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:51,140
那不代表你不知道密码
That doesn't mean you don't know the combination.

870
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,110
告诉我们密码
Tell us what it is.

871
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:56,710
我不知道
I don't know.

872
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,780
有消息来源说你知道
We have it on good authority you do know.

873
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,290
消息来源?
Yeah? Whose authority?

874
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,280
- 这东西值五百美元 - 里面有什么
- Five hundred dollars, this cost. - What's inside it?

875
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:15,330
现金 信用卡 身份证 还有这个
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

876
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,860
有用吗
Useful?

877
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:23,630
可能
Maybe.

878
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,910
轮到你 有一小时时间
You're on. You've got an hour.

879
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,330
一小时?
An hour?

880
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,910
我应该有整晚的时间
I was supposed to have all night to crack this.

881
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:33,680
齐藤也不该胸口中枪
And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.

882
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:37,010
只有一小时套料
You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please.

883
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:41,990
- 怎么回事 - 消息来源
- What's that? - Good authority.

884
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,930
彼得叔叔
Uncle Peter.

885
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,760
置停他们
Just make them stop.

886
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,400
- 密码 - 我不知道
- The combination. - I don't know it.

887
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:56,230
- 那为什么你叔叔说你知道? - 我不知道
- Why does Browning say you do? - I don't know.

888
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,880
让我跟他谈谈 我就能知道
Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.

889
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,940
一个小时 只许谈话
You have one hour. Start talking.

890
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,140
你没事吧
You all right?

891
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,350
你没事吧
You okay?

892
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:17,720
这帮混蛋囚禁我两天
Those bastards have had at me for two days.

893
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:20,860
他们有同党能出入令尊办公室
They have someone with access to your father's office.

894
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,900
- 他们想要打开保险箱 - 是啊
- They're trying to open his safe. - Yeah.

895
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,800
他们以为我知道密码 但我根本不知道
They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it.

896
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,700
- 我也不知道 - 什么
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so... - What?

897
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,700
令尊说当他离世后 便只有你能打开
Maurice told me that when he passed, you were the only one able to open it.

898
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,400
他从没告诉过我什么密码
No, he never gave me any combination.

899
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:40,280
或许他说过 你只是不知那是密码
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just didn't know it was a combination.

900
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,650
那会是什么
Well, what, then?

901
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:44,340
根据你和令尊相处所得
I don't know, some meaningful combination of numbers...

902
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:48,460
或许是有意义的数字组合
...based on your experiences with Maurice.

903
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:54,100
我们根本没怎么相处过
We didn't have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together.

904
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,300
也许在令堂离世后
Perhaps after your mother died.

905
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,100
家母离世后 你知道他说什么
After my mother died, you know what he told me?

906
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:08,360
费舍尔 我简直不知如何是好
"Robert, there's really nothing to be said."

907
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,880
他不善表达情感
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

908
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:13,740
那时我仅十一岁 彼得叔叔
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

909
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:17,750
- 他怎么样 - 他很痛苦
- How's he doing? - He's in a lot of pain.

910
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:21,510
待进入下一层 痛苦会减轻些
When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.

911
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,920
万一他死了
And if he dies?

912
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,560
最坏情况?
Worst-case scenario?

913
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:28,420
醒来后 意识全无
When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.

914
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:32,660
柯布先生 我仍会遵守协定
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

915
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,530
我相信你
I appreciate that, Saito.

916
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:38,760
但等你梦醒 你根本不会记得协定
But when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.

917
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,970
你会把潜意识边缘空间当作现实世界
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

918
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:44,910
你迷失于此 直至终老
You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.

919
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:46,710
心存遗憾?
Filled with regret?

920
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,240
孤独离世
Waiting to die alone.

921
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,010
不会
No.

922
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,210
我会回来
I'll come back.

923
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:56,680
我们再重回年轻那时
And we'll be young men together again.

924
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:03,720
呼吸
Breathe.

925
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,920
若不告诉他们密码 我们必死无疑
These people are gonna kill us if we don't give them the combination.

926
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,000
- 他们只求钱财 - 我听他们说
- They just wanna ransom us. - I heard them.

927
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:13,070
他们会把我们锁进货车 然后丢到河里
They're gonna lock us in that van, and then drive it into the river.

928
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,710
箱内有什么东西
All right. What is in the safe?

929
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,970
是给你的
Something for you.

930
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:21,740
令尊说过 那是给你最珍贵的礼物
Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.

931
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:25,540
- 一份遗嘱 - 他的遗嘱在律师那里
- A will. - Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

932
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:26,950
另一份遗嘱
That's an alternate.

933
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,490
这份具有优先法律效力
This would supersede the other if you want it to.

934
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:32,290
若你接受 会解体非榭公司
It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.

935
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:36,160
摧毁整家公司
It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.

936
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,800
毁掉给我的全部遗产?
Destroying my whole inheritance?

937
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,630
- 他为什么要这样 - 我不知道
- Why would he suggest such a thing? - I just don't know.

938
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,480
他痛惜你 费舍尔
He loved you, Robert.

939
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,670
以他的方式痛惜你
In his own way.

940
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,640
他的方式?
In his own way.

941
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,470
他弥留之际
At the end...

942
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:58,950
他叫我到床边
...he called me in to his deathbed.

943
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,290
他都说不出话
He could barely speak.

944
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:06,590
但他尽力说了句话
But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.

945
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,720
他拉近我
He pulled me close.

946
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:15,490
我勉强听到
And I could only make out...

947
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,800
两个字
...one word.

948
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,480
失望
"Disappointed."

949
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,310
你几时去过意识边缘
When were you in limbo?

950
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:35,380
你也许可以说服其他人继续任务
You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job.

951
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:37,920
- 因为他们不知道内情 - 什么内情
- But they don't know the truth. - Truth? What truth?

952
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:42,260
内情就是你随时可让火车穿墙而过
The truth that, at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall.

953
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:46,490
内情就是梅尔又会跑出来
The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.

954
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,070
内情就是越是深入费舍尔的潜意识
And the truth that, as we go deeper into Fischer...

955
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,030
同时亦会深入你潜意识
...we're also going deeper into you.

956
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,140
恐怕后果不堪设想
And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.

957
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,610
我们当时在一起工作
We were working together.

958
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:04,450
探索梦中梦的奥妙
We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.

959
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,910
我欲之过急
I kept pushing things.

960
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:09,460
我不断深潜梦空间
I wanted to go deeper and deeper. I wanted to go further.

961
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:14,840
当时我亦未明白
I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there...

962
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:17,740
梦里人生几般变
...that we could get trapped so deep...

963
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:21,880
直到最后我们潜入潜意识边缘
...that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious...

964
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:25,010
我们迷失于此
... we lost sight of what was real.

965
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,650
在那里我们费尽所思打造世界
We created. We built the world for ourselves.

966
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:37,290
所费数十载
We did that for years.

967
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,400
建造了属于我们的世界
We built our own world.

968
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,470
你们被困了多久
How long were you stuck there?

969
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:46,730
差不多五十年
Something like 50 years.

970
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,310
天啊
Jesus.

971
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:54,950
你怎么受得了
How could you stand it?

972
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:57,850
原先感觉高高在上
It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods.

973
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:01,050
问题在于我知道一切都非真实
The problem was knowing that none of it was real.

974
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:05,630
后来我终无法再继续如斯生活
Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that.

975
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,190
她呢
And what about for her?

976
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:14,570
她将其内心深处的想法深锁起来
She had locked something away, something deep inside her.

977
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:21,200
她本已知道事实 却选择遗忘
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.

978
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:26,640
她把那里当成现实世界
Limbo became her reality.

979
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:29,780
你们醒后发生何事
What happened when you woke up?

980
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:33,980
由漫长数十载的梦空间苏醒
Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades...

981
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:39,550
迟暮之年逆转为而立之年
... to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?

982
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:44,230
我知道她不对劲 可她就是不承认
I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn't admit it.

983
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:47,870
终于她道出实话
Eventually, she told me the truth.

984
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:51,670
她仍有所思疑
She was possessed by an idea.

985
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:57,540
极符其微的意念却足以改变一切
This one very simple idea that changed everything.

986
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:01,150
她思疑这个世界亦非真实
That our world wasn't real.

987
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:06,350
她很想重回现实世界
That she needed to wake up to come back to reality...

988
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,250
然而为了回到现实
...that in order to get back home...

989
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,290
我们就必须自杀
...we had to kill ourselves.

990
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:22,390
- 那你们的孩子呢 - 她认为都是潜意识投射影子
- What about your children? - She thought they were projections...

991
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:25,560
认为真正的孩子在现实中等待我们
... that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.

992
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,440
- 我是他们母亲 - 冷静
- I'm their mother! - Calm down.

993
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,870
我顿觉不妥
I can tell the difference.

994
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:31,380
若只是场梦 你可以控制它
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?

995
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,240
因为你不知周也
You don't know you're dreaming!

996
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:35,610
她态度强硬 我无法劝服
She was certain there was nothing I could do...

997
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:39,620
不管我苦苦哀求
...no matter how much I begged, no matter how much I pleaded.

998
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,620
她想轻生 又不愿独自黄泉路
She wanted to do it, but she could not do it alone.

999
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:52,290
她很爱我 因此在我们结婚周年有所行动
She loved me too much, so she came up with a plan on our anniversary.

1000
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:21,160
- 老婆 你在干什么 - 加入我
- Sweetheart, what are you doing? - Join me.

1001
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:25,600
先回屋内
Just... Just step back inside. All right? Just step back inside now, come on.

1002
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:30,200
不 我要跳下去 你跟我一起跳
No. I'm going to jump, and you're coming with me.

1003
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:32,070
不 我不会跳
No, I'm not.

1004
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,330
听我讲
Now, you listen to me.

1005
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:39,180
若跳下去 你永远不会醒过来
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up, remember? You're gonna die.

1006
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,280
先回屋内
Now, just step back inside.

1007
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:44,180
回屋内漫谈
Come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this.

1008
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,290
谈过多次了
We've talked enough.

1009
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:50,020
- 梅尔 - 爬到窗台上来
- Mal. - Come out onto the ledge...

1010
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,890
- 否则我马上跳 - 好的
...or I'll jump right now. - Okay.

1011
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:58,960
那我们谈谈
We're gonna talk about this.

1012
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:01,000
可以吗
All right?

1013
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:06,230
- 我要你孤注一掷 - 不行
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith. - No, honey.

1014
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,200
我不能那样做
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1015
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:13,140
稍微为我们的孩子着想
Take a second, think about our children.

1016
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:15,040
为吉姆斯着想
Think about James.

1017
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:17,410
为菲丽着想
Think about Phillipa, now.

1018
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,520
就算你不跳 孩子还会被带走
If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway.

1019
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,990
- 你什么意思 - 我留了封信给我们的律师
- What does that mean? - I filed a letter with our attorney...

1020
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,760
坦说我担心自身安危
...explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.

1021
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:32,130
你扬言杀我
How you've threatened to kill me.

1022
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:37,560
- 为什么要这样做 - 我好爱你 柯布
- Why did you do this? - I love you, Dom.

1023
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,500
为何如斯对我
Why did...? Why would you do this to me?

1024
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,540
你不必为离开孩子而自责
I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.

1025
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,740
我们是回家看望真正的孩子
We're going home to our real children.

1026
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,540
梅尔 求你听我讲
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me, all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1027
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:51,320
你等待一列火车
You're waiting for a train.

1028
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:55,370
- 梅尔 不要 - 火车将带你远去他方
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this! - A train that will take you far away.

1029
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,540
吉姆斯和菲丽等待我们
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1030
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:01,550
你深知前去何方 同时亦忧虑能否到达
You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1031
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:03,920
- 梅尔 看着我 - 不过无关紧要
- Mal, look at me! - But it doesn't matter.

1032
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,290
- 梅尔 听我讲 - 彼此相聚已胜一切
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me! - Because you'll be together.

1033
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:11,290
梅尔 不要
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1034
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:12,900
天啊
Jesus Christ!

1035
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:20,130
她有三位心理医生出具的精神证明
She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists.

1036
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,500
我没法解释她发疯原因
It made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness.

1037
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:25,900
所以我只好逃走
So I ran.

1038
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,980
此时不走更待何时
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1039
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:40,980
吉姆斯 菲丽 过来
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

1040
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:42,320
好 走
All right, let's go.

1041
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:46,660
我抛下了孩子 我一直很想回家
I left my children behind and I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.

1042
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:51,100
是你的自责感塑造了她
Your guilt defines her. It's what powers her.

1043
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,570
不要再耿耿于怀
But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.

1044
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:58,370
如果要行动成功
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1045
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:03,500
你要原谅自己 坦然面对她
...you have to forgive yourself, and you're gonna have to confront her.

1046
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,510
你不会独自面对
But you don't have to do that alone.

1047
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:07,950
- 不 你不必... - 我是紧张大局
- No, you're not... - I'm doing it for the others.

1048
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:13,720
因他们对跟你潜入梦空间的风险一无所知
Because they have no idea the risk they've taken coming down here with you.

1049
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,290
我们得走
We have to move.

1050
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,900
时间到了
Time's up.

1051
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,800
我真不知道密码
All right. I don't know any combination.

1052
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:28,060
- 完全没有印象 - 那用直觉猜
- Not consciously, anyway. How about instinctively, huh?

1053
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:32,180
我已派人在令尊办公室待命
I got somebody in your father's office right now ready to tap in the combination.

1054
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:35,240
你快想出六个数字
Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now.

1055
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,640
- 我真不知道 - 快
- I have no idea. - Right now!

1056
01:22:37,830 --> 01:22:40,050
快
I said, right now! Right now!

1057
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:44,120
五、二、八、四、九、一
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1058
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,980
早该如此
You'll have to do better than that.

1059
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:53,490
套起来 我们要上车
All right. Bag them. You're going for a ride.

1060
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:02,000
你们想杀人灭口?
We're worth more to you alive. You hear me?

1061
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:08,770
有什么收获
What'd you get?

1062
01:23:09,190 --> 01:23:11,710
他们父子关系比传闻还糟糕
Relationship with his father is worse than we imagined.

1063
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:12,910
对我们有用吗
This helps us how?

1064
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,180
越是这样 他就越需要精神发泄
The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis.

1065
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,480
- 我们怎么令他们和好 - 我在斟酌
- How are we gonna reconcile them? - I'm working on that.

1066
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:24,190
动作快 影子们逼近
Work faster. The projections are closing in quick.

1067
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:27,920
我们须在被围堵前突破出去
We gotta break out of here before we're totally boxed in.

1068
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,060
该死的
Damn it.

1069
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:07,230
只是场梦 不用较真
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.

1070
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:26,680
现我们要将他对父亲的怨恨转移到教父
We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.

1071
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:30,890
- 破坏他们叔侄友好关系? - 不 我们要揭露他叔叔的真面目
- Destroy his one positive relationship? - No, repair his relationship with his father...

1072
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:33,360
藉以修复他和父亲的关系
...whilst exposing his godfather's true nature.

1073
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:36,520
我们做这么多有益他的事 该收费
We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job.

1074
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,070
潜入越深 他的意识守护者就越多
His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper.

1075
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:42,030
- 我们得用查理先生那招 - 不行
- I think we run with Mr. Charles. - No.

1076
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:43,870
- 谁是查理先生 - 馊主意
- Who's Mr. Charles? - Bad idea.

1077
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:47,570
我们一抵达酒店 守护者就会堤防我们
The second we get into that hotel his security's gonna be all over us.

1078
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,840
然后我们就采取查理计划
We run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job.

1079
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:52,350
- 以前做过? - 但没成功
- You've done it before? Yeah, and it didn't work.

1080
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:56,010
目标人物意识到他在做梦 他潜意识在排斥我们
The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1081
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,210
好极 不过你们吃一堑长一智
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

1082
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,480
- 我需要有人引开注意 - 没问题
- I need some kind of distraction. - No problem.

1083
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,850
像以前那样 伪装成个美女如何
How about a lovely lady that I've used before?

1084
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,090
小心开车 知道吗
Listen to me. You drive carefully, all right?

1085
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:07,730
下一层会非常不稳定
Everything down there is gonna be unstable as hell.

1086
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,500
别太早冲下去 只能用一次堕醒
Don't jump too soon. We only got one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1087
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,970
时间一到 我用音乐提示你们 剩下的就靠你们
I'll play the music to let you know it's coming. The rest is on you.

1088
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:20,930
- 准备好吗? - 就绪
- You ready? - Ready!

1089
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:23,270
做个美梦
Sweet dreams.

1090
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:25,340
你觉得我很无聊吗
Am I boring you?

1091
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:29,840
你好像不喜欢听我的故事
I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn't to your liking.

1092
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:34,350
我现在心乱如麻
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

1093
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:37,480
查理先生出场
There goes Mr. Charles.

1094
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,820
你是非榭先生?
Mr. Fischer, right?

1095
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:48,490
乐意再见面 我是营销部的洛·葛明
Pleasure to see you again. Rod Green from marketing. L...

1096
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,630
- 你是? - 失陪
- And you must be? - Leaving.

1097
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,000
有空找我
In case you get bored.

1098
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,610
你被她迷倒
Must've blown you off.

1099
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:06,510
电话号码怎会只有6位数
That is, unless her phone number really is only six digits.

1100
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:13,120
假意结交 继而偷钱包
Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that.

1101
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:19,390
单钱包至少价值...
Goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least 500...

1102
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:20,690
五百美元?
About $500, right?

1103
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,830
别担心 我的人会帮你把钱包找回来
Don't worry about it. My people are already on it as we speak.

1104
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,940
查理先生到底是什么
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1105
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:29,830
就是挑拨费舍尔与意识守护者的关系
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.

1106
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,340
你为什么不赞成
And why don't you approve?

1107
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,500
这会告诉目标人物他置身梦中
It involves telling the mark that he's dreaming...

1108
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:35,810
也会引起注意我们
...which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.

1109
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:38,920
柯布不是说不能这么做吗
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that? - Hmm.

1110
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:40,850
现在你清楚柯布为人
So now you've noticed how much time...

1111
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:43,650
说一套做一套
...Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.

1112
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,150
齐藤先生 能和你谈谈吗?
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1113
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:49,760
- 抱歉... - 等等
- I'm sorry, but... - Hold on! Wait!

1114
01:26:51,110 --> 01:26:52,390
精神甚佳
You look a bit perkier.

1115
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:54,900
难以置信 奕祠
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1116
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:02,630
飞机遇到气流?
Turbulence on the plane?

1117
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,500
守护者快追上
No, it's much closer.

1118
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,340
佑沭还在开车
That's Yusuf's driving.

1119
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,150
抱歉 你刚说你是?
Um, I'm sorry. Who did you say you were?

1120
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:19,420
营销部的洛·葛明
Rod Green from marketing.

1121
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,180
其实没这个人 对不
But that's not true at all, is it?

1122
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,750
我是查理先生 还记得吗
My name is Mr. Charles. You remember me, don't you?

1123
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,930
我是你这里的保安主管
I'm the head of your security down here.

1124
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,140
去不同的楼层 别停下来
Get out on a different floor, keep moving.

1125
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:34,640
然后丢掉皮包 守护者会找的
Dump the wallet. Security will be looking for that.

1126
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:38,300
- 好的 - 我们要帮柯布争取多些时间
- Okay. - We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1127
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,500
保安?
Security, huh?

1128
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,110
- 你就职这家酒店? - 不是
- You work for the hotel? - No, no.

1129
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:52,880
我负责一种很特别的保安工作
I specialize in a very specific type of security.

1130
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,950
潜意识保安
Subconscious security.

1131
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,220
你想说这里是梦空间?
You're talking about dreams?

1132
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:00,260
有盗梦者入侵?
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

1133
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:02,700
我会保护你
I am here to protect you.

1134
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:18,670
非榭先生 我会保护你
Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you in the event...

1135
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:22,220
防止有人通过梦空间入侵你意识
...that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.

1136
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,020
你身处险境
You're not safe here.

1137
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,450
他们要来抓你
They're coming for you.

1138
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,840
天气异常 对不
Strange weather, isn't it?

1139
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:53,810
感觉到吗
You feel that?

1140
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:56,980
发生什么事
What's happening?

1141
01:28:57,170 --> 01:29:00,390
柯布让费舍尔觉得这梦空间很怪异
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream...

1142
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:03,430
所以他的潜意识在找造梦师
...which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.

1143
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,650
就是我 快吻我
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1144
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,540
- 影子们还关注我们 - 试试无妨
- They're still looking at us. - Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1145
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,230
我们最好离开这里
We should probably get out of here.

1146
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:37,090
感觉到吗 你曾受过训练
You feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1147
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:41,250
注意天气异常 重力变化
Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1148
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,600
一切皆是梦
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1149
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,640
最简单的梦空间测试就是
Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself...

1150
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:55,900
尝试回忆你是如何来到这家酒店
...is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?

1151
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,040
是的
Yeah, I...

1152
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:00,740
呼吸 回想训练
No, breathe, breathe. Remember your training.

1153
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:06,080
相信你置身梦空间 而我是来保护你
Accept the fact that you're in a dream, and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

1154
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:14,090
- 你不是真实的? - 没错
- You're not real? - No.

1155
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,630
我只是你潜意识的投射影子
No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.

1156
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:19,900
我是来保护安全
I was sent here to protect you in the event...

1157
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,970
防止盗梦者带你进入梦空间
...that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.

1158
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:26,370
然而事情已发生
And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1159
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:29,770
好的
Okay.

1160
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:31,910
好的
Okay.

1161
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:36,740
帮我离开这里
Can you get me out of here?

1162
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:40,250
现在 跟着我
Right away. Follow me.

1163
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,800
稍等
Hold on a second.

1164
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,580
你在干什么
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1165
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,010
这些人是来绑架你
These men were sent here to abduct you, all right?

1166
01:31:05,190 --> 01:31:07,740
要我帮你 你必须保持冷静
If you want my help, you have to remain calm.

1167
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,790
我需要你配合
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1168
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:27,100
若这是梦空间 我自杀就会清醒 对吧
If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?

1169
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,360
若我是你就不会这样做
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer.

1170
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:33,030
他们肯定给你注射镇静剂
I believe they have you sedated, and if you pull that trigger...

1171
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:34,370
自杀的话是醒不过来
...you may not wake up.

1172
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,810
会进入更深的梦空间 你应该明白
You may go into a further dream state. Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1173
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,810
回想训练的内容
You remember the training.

1174
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:46,360
回想我的教导
Remember what I said to you.

1175
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,390
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

1176
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:02,800
- 这房间刚好在五二八下面吗? - 没错
- This room should be directly below 528? - Yeah.

1177
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:13,670
努力回想
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1178
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:17,690
回想发梦前发生的事情
What do you remember from before this dream?

1179
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:20,680
枪林弹雨
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

1180
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:23,450
倾盆大雨
There was rain.

1181
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:25,590
彼得叔叔
Uncle Peter.

1182
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:29,490
- 我们被绑架 - 他们把你们关在哪
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped. - Where were they holding you?

1183
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:35,800
- 关在货车后座 - 难怪会有重力变化
- They had us in the back of a van. - That explains the gravity shifts.

1184
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:38,070
你现正在货车后座 继续
You're in the back of a van. Keep going.

1185
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:40,510
好像是...
It had something to do with, um...

1186
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,010
跟保险箱有关
Something to do with a safe.

1187
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:46,280
我总想不起来
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1188
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:49,150
就像梦醒却难以回忆当中
It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.

1189
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,050
需要多年时间训练
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1190
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:53,620
你和彼得被带到此梦空间
You and Browning have been pulled into this dream...

1191
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,560
因为他们要从你意识盗取某些信息
...because they're trying to steal something from your mind.

1192
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:00,290
你要集中精神记起究竟是什么信息
I need you to focus and try and remember what that is.

1193
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:02,090
是什么信息
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1194
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:06,000
密码 他们要我说出凭直觉想到的数字
A combination. They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.

1195
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,900
他们想从你的潜意识盗取数字密码
They're trying to extract a number from your subconscious.

1196
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:12,840
数字可以代表很多 就如我们在酒店
It can represent anything. We're in a hotel right now.

1197
01:33:13,650 --> 01:33:16,770
可以试下酒店房间号 密码是什么
We should try hotel rooms. What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1198
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,780
努力回忆 这非常重要
Try and remember for me. This is very important.

1199
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,280
五
Five.

1200
01:33:22,260 --> 01:33:24,690
五、二 很长的数字密码
Five, two... It was something, it was a long number.

1201
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:26,950
- 好 我们从这里找起 - 五楼
- That's good. We can start there. - Fifth floor.

1202
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:28,150
好的
Yep.

1203
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:32,350
- 用计时器? - 自己判断
- So do you use a timer? - No, I have to judge it for myself.

1204
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:35,830
当你们在五二八房入睡 我等候佑沭的堕醒信号
While you're all asleep in 528, I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1205
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,130
- 你怎么知道 - 会有音乐提示
- Well, how will you know? - His music warns me.

1206
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:42,240
要跟货车撞到桥栏的时间配合无误
And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1207
01:33:42,420 --> 01:33:45,600
才能同步堕醒
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1208
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:48,180
若太早 我们回不去
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.

1209
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:51,610
晚了 我无法堕醒你们
But if it's too late, I won't be able to drop us.

1210
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:55,580
- 为什么 - 因为到时候货车于自由落体过程
- Well, why not? - Because the van will be in freefall.

1211
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:58,950
- 没有重力配合实现堕醒 - 有道理
- Can't drop you without gravity. - Right.

1212
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:06,830
自己人
They're with me. Go on.

1213
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:32,180
查理先生
Mr. Charles.

1214
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:35,330
- 知道里面是什么吧 非榭先生 - 我知道
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer? - Yeah, I think so.

1215
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,550
他们想要把你带入梦空间
They were trying to put you under.

1216
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:40,050
- 我已在梦空间 - 再进去
- I'm already under. - Under again.

1217
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:42,790
你所指梦中梦?
What do you mean, a dream within a dream?

1218
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:45,870
你又扮鬼扮马
Hey. I see you've changed.

1219
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:47,660
不懂你说什么
I'm sorry?

1220
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:52,040
抱歉 认错人了
Oh, I'm sorry. I mistook you for a friend.

1221
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:53,470
哦
Oh.

1222
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:55,770
他肯定是大帅哥
Good-Iooking fellow, I'm sure.

1223
01:34:56,460 --> 01:34:59,380
那是费舍尔潜意识投射出来的彼得
No, no, no. That's Fischer's projection of Browning.

1224
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:01,420
跟着看他做什么
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.

1225
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,550
- 为什么 - 因为他的动作会告诉我们
- Why? - Because how he acts will tell us...

1226
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:07,050
费舍尔是否已对彼得起疑了
...if Fischer is starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to.

1227
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:08,250
嘘
Shh.

1228
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,320
- 彼得叔叔 - 你说你们一起被绑架
- Uncle Peter. - You said you were kidnapped together?

1229
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:18,940
事实是他们先绑架他 并折磨他
Well, not exactly. They already had him. They were torturing him.

1230
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:20,570
你亲眼目睹他们折磨他?
And you saw them torture him?

1231
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,940
绑匪是你安排?
The kidnappers are working for you?

1232
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:32,380
费舍尔
Robert.

1233
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,380
你想打开保险箱 拿遗嘱?
You're trying to get that safe open? To get the alternate will?

1234
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,020
公司是我毕生心血 我不容许你摧毁
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life. I can't let you destroy it.

1235
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:43,560
我岂会摧毁公司
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.

1236
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:47,890
我岂能让你再遭受令尊泼冷水
I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.

1237
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:51,730
- 泼冷水? - 那份遗嘱
- What taunt? - The will, Robert. That will?

1238
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:53,840
就是对你泼冷水
That's his last insult.

1239
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:57,630
他质疑你会有所建树
A challenge for you to build something for yourself...

1240
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:01,610
言下之意 你没资格继承公司
...by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.

1241
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:12,650
- 他对我很失望? - 很抱歉
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed? - I'm sorry.

1242
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:17,120
不过他错了
But he's wrong.

1243
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:20,490
果然青出于蓝而胜于蓝
You can build a better company than he ever did.

1244
01:36:20,670 --> 01:36:23,100
非榭先生 他说谎
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

1245
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,360
- 你怎么知道 - 相信我 我是行内人
- How do you know? - Trust me, it's what I do.

1246
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:28,300
我们要查出他在隐瞒什么
He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is.

1247
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,910
以其人之道 还治其人之身
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.

1248
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:39,540
我们潜入他潜意识找出当中所隐瞒
We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.

1249
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:42,290
好
All right.

1250
01:36:48,270 --> 01:36:49,520
- 他入睡了 - 等等
- He's out. - Wait.

1251
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:51,750
我们是要潜入谁的意识
Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?

1252
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:53,260
当然是费舍尔
We're going into Fischer's.

1253
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,130
我那样说 只是拉拢成为我们一员
I told him it was Browning's so he'd be a part of our team.

1254
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,630
他将帮我们潜入他的潜意识
He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.

1255
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:00,360
没错
That's right.

1256
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:02,600
守护者会狂追你
Security's gonna run you down hard.

1257
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:05,110
我会导演场猫鼠游戏
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1258
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:08,300
- 记得准时堕醒我们 - 奕祠 快睡觉
- Just be back before the kick. - Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1259
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:14,710
没事吧
You good?

1260
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,220
准备好没
Hey. You ready?

1261
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:22,990
我没事 可以就绪
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1262
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,870
柯布
Cobb?

1263
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,980
柯布 那边是什么
Cobb? What's down there?

1264
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,940
希望有我们想让费舍尔知道的真相
Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn.

1265
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:48,020
我所指 那里有什么你期待的
I mean, what's down there for you?

1266
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:26,370
看见没
Did you see that?

1267
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:46,690
奕祠 这是你的梦空间
Eames, this is your dream.

1268
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:49,960
你负责把守护者引离基地
I need you to draw the security away from the complex, understand?

1269
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:51,930
- 谁带领费舍尔进去 - 我不行
- Who guides Fischer in? - Not me.

1270
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:54,570
若我知道路线 行动必定失败
If I know the route, everything could be compromised.

1271
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:57,260
- 我设计这地方的 - 你要跟着我
- I designed the place. - No, you're with me.

1272
01:40:57,450 --> 01:40:58,970
我来
I could do it.

1273
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:01,840
告诉他怎么进入基地
All right. Brief him on the route into the complex.

1274
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:06,210
- 费舍尔 你跟着他 - 好 那你呢
- Fischer, you'll be going with him. - All right. What about you?

1275
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:09,220
戴好 全程保持联络
You keep this live. I'll be listening in the whole time.

1276
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:13,520
二楼的窗容许我在塔上掩护你
The windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1277
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:14,990
你不进去?
You're not coming in?

1278
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:17,490
为了找寻令尊的真相
In order to find out the truth about your father...

1279
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:20,690
你要独自潜入彼得的意识
...you're gonna need to break into Browning's mind on your own.

1280
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:23,030
快
Come on, Fischer!

1281
01:42:18,130 --> 01:42:21,780
- 通知警报 - 快 快
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm! - Go, go, go!

1282
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:23,480
行动
Move!

1283
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,090
快
Go!

1284
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:42,340
糟糕
Sod it.

1285
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:55,180
希望你们准备好
I hope you're ready.

1286
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:05,700
太早了
No, it's too soon.

1287
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:13,400
柯布 听到吗
Cobb, do you hear that?

1288
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:17,140
大约廿分钟前开始听到 我还以为是风声
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago, I thought it was the wind up here.

1289
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:20,170
我听到 是音乐
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

1290
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,750
怎么办
So, what do we do?

1291
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:23,320
动作快点
We move fast.

1292
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:31,060
十秒后佑沭就要开车撞桥栏
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1293
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:35,300
亚瑟有三分钟时间
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1294
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,330
- 嘿 - 是他
- Hey! - That's him!

1295
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,730
- 我们还剩多久 - 六十分钟
- Which gives us what? - Sixty minutes.

1296
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:44,170
- 他们能一小时内进去吗? - 他们还得爬中央平台
- Can they make that route in an hour? - They have to climb to the terrace.

1297
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:47,210
有没有捷径
Then they need a new route, a more direct route.

1298
01:43:58,430 --> 01:44:00,050
这里本来就设计成迷宫
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1299
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:02,690
一定会有捷径通过迷宫
There must be access routes that cut through the maze.

1300
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:04,450
奕祠?
Eames?

1301
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,810
奕祠有没有在迷宫加料
Did Eames add any features?

1302
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,450
我不可以告诉你
I don't think I should tell you.

1303
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:32,920
没时间 快告诉我
We don't have time for this. Did he add anything?

1304
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:36,120
他加了风道系统以便通过迷宫
He added an air-duct system that can cut through the maze.

1305
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:37,490
好极 叫他们换道
Good. Explain it to them.

1306
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:38,890
- 齐藤 - 收到
- Saito? - Go ahead.

1307
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:13,790
似非而是
Paradox.

1308
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,730
- 怎么会这样 - 开始堕醒
- What was that? - The kick.

1309
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:28,240
柯布 我们错过堕醒?
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1310
01:46:28,420 --> 01:46:30,100
我们错过堕醒了
Yeah, we missed it.

1311
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:31,470
天啊
Man.

1312
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:35,940
为什么不设计个海滩
Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh?

1313
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:40,280
那我们现在怎么办
Well, what the hell do we do now?

1314
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:42,280
下次堕醒前完成任务
We finish the job before the next kick.

1315
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:44,550
- 下次? - 货车冲击水面时
- What next kick? - When the van hits the water.

1316
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:10,850
如果想拨电话 请挂断再试
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.

1317
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:12,850
如果需要帮助...
If you need help, hang up...

1318
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:16,380
没有重力怎么实现堕醒
How do I drop you without gravity?

1319
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:21,550
亚瑟还剩几分钟 我们约有廿分钟
Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20.

1320
01:47:44,990 --> 01:47:46,640
没事吧
You okay?

1321
01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:54,990
返回基地
Run! Turn around! Move to base! Move to base!

1322
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:56,680
快 快 快
Go, go, go!

1323
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:00,020
有不妥
There's something wrong.

1324
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:02,530
他们如有所觉察 朝着你们方向前去
They're heading your way, like they know something.

1325
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:06,000
想办法争取多点时间
Just buy us more time, all right?

1326
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:08,000
- 快点 - 这就来
- Come on! - On my way.

1327
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:09,870
快
Come on! Move!

1328
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:35,580
好
All right.

1329
01:49:47,780 --> 01:49:50,570
这是保险库的前厅
Okay. That's the antechamber outside the strong room.

1330
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:54,230
- 保险库有窗吗 - 有的话就不叫保险库
- Does the strong room have windows? - It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1331
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:56,640
希望费舍尔可如愿以偿
Let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.

1332
01:49:58,290 --> 01:50:01,610
- 这些都是他潜意识的投射影子? - 是
- Are those projections his subconscious? - Yes.

1333
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:05,150
- 你在摧毁他部分潜意识 - 他们只是影子
- Are you destroying parts of his mind? - No. They're just projections.

1334
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:33,180
- 我们到了 - 目前安全 但要快点
- We're here. - You're clear, but hurry.

1335
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,180
整支部队朝你们那前去
There's an entire army headed your way.

1336
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:03,380
我进来了
I'm in.

1337
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:09,810
他在那
There he is.

1338
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:55,090
- 里面还有人 - 是陷阱 快走
- There's someone in there. - Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1339
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:58,830
拜托 再低点
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1340
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:05,730
柯布
Cobb.

1341
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:08,900
她不是真实的
No, she is not real.

1342
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,740
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

1343
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:14,540
她只是影子 费舍尔才是真实的
She is just a projection. Fischer. Fischer is real.

1344
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:20,080
你好
Hello.

1345
01:52:24,770 --> 01:52:27,960
奕祠 快赶到前厅
Eames! Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1346
01:53:11,890 --> 01:53:14,740
- 什么事 - 梅尔杀死费舍尔
- What happened? - Mal killed Fischer.

1347
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:19,040
我没法对她开枪
I couldn't shoot her.

1348
01:53:19,730 --> 01:53:23,080
无法救他 他的意识已被困在下一层
There's no use in reviving him. His mind's already trapped down there.

1349
01:53:23,260 --> 01:53:24,310
玩完
It's all over.

1350
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:27,680
言下之意 我们失败了?
So that's it, then? We failed?

1351
01:53:28,330 --> 01:53:30,490
好抱歉 我们失败了
We're done. I'm sorry.

1352
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:36,990
反正不是我不能回家
It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?

1353
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:41,600
好可惜 还想知道里面有什么
Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

1354
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:43,830
装炸药
Let's set the charges.

1355
01:53:45,690 --> 01:53:47,170
还有其他方法
No, there's still another way.

1356
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:51,880
- 我们只有跟费舍尔潜入下一层 - 时间不够
- We have to follow Fischer down there. - Not enough time.

1357
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:54,880
但在下一层有足够时间
No, but there will be enough time down there.

1358
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:57,110
我们会找到他
And we will find him.

1359
01:53:57,300 --> 01:54:01,220
一旦音乐响 就用电击器电醒他
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1360
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:04,290
同时我们在下一层堕醒他
We can give him his own kick down below.

1361
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:07,020
然后你就可以让他进去里面
Look, you get him in there.

1362
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:10,060
音乐一结束 你就炸掉基地
As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital...

1363
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:13,030
我们便能回到现实世界
...and we all ride the kick back up the layers.

1364
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:19,000
值得一试 我怕装炸药时 斋藤挡不住士兵
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges.

1365
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:21,270
齐藤能坚持吗
Saito will never make it, will he?

1366
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:25,780
- 我们一定要试试 - 好吧
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this. - Go for it.

1367
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:28,880
时间一到 我可不等你们
If you are not back before the kick, I am gone with or without you.

1368
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:32,280
她说得对 我们走
She's right. She's right. Come on. Let's go.

1369
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:38,720
我能相信你可应付接下来的事吗?
Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?

1370
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:40,090
梅尔一定在那里
Mal's gonna be down there.

1371
01:54:40,270 --> 01:54:42,700
我会找到她 她肯定和费舍尔一起
I know where to find her. She'll have Fischer.

1372
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:46,770
- 你怎么知道 - 因为她知道我会去找费舍尔
- How do you know? - Because she wants me to come after him.

1373
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:49,100
她要我跟她一起留在那里
She wants me back down there with her.

1374
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:16,890
没事吧?
All right?

1375
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:26,800
- 这是你们的世界 - 曾经是
- This is your world? - It was.

1376
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:29,540
她就在这里
And this is where she'll be.

1377
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:31,840
走吧
Come on.

1378
01:56:18,340 --> 01:56:20,800
齐藤
Saito. Saito.

1379
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:25,190
我装炸药 你负责看好费舍尔
I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?

1380
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:28,800
看来我真的不适合参与
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1381
01:56:31,450 --> 01:56:32,600
别傻了
Don't be silly.

1382
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:07,170
这些都是你们创建? 难以置信
You built all this? This is incredible.

1383
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:09,670
花费数十载创建
We built for years.

1384
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,700
那时我们凭记忆创建
Then we started in on the memories.

1385
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:21,160
这边
This way.

1386
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,930
这是我们的小区
This was our neighborhood.

1387
01:58:05,110 --> 01:58:07,430
根据昔日记忆创建
Places from our past.

1388
01:58:07,610 --> 01:58:09,370
那是我们第一套公寓
That was our first apartment.

1389
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:11,770
后来搬到旁边那栋大厦
Then we moved to that building right there.

1390
01:58:11,950 --> 01:58:14,470
梅尔有孕后 就住那
After Mal became pregnant, that became our home.

1391
01:58:14,650 --> 01:58:17,440
你们根据记忆记忆创建这一切
You reconstructed all of this from memory?

1392
01:58:17,620 --> 01:58:19,880
在这里我们有的是时间
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

1393
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:21,640
那是什么
What is that?

1394
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,950
梅尔成长的地方
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1395
01:58:25,130 --> 01:58:27,560
- 她会在那吗? - 不会
- Well, will she be in there? - No.

1396
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:28,910
快走
Come on.

1397
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:32,420
我们都想住别墅 但我们又喜欢这种风格的大厦
We both wanted to live in a house, but we loved this type of building.

1398
01:58:32,610 --> 01:58:35,530
现实世界只能二选一 但在这里任由我们主事
In the real world, we'd have to choose, but not here.

1399
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:18,130
我们怎么带费舍尔回去
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1400
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:20,980
我们要设法堕醒他
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick.

1401
01:59:21,150 --> 01:59:22,540
怎么堕醒
What?

1402
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:24,640
到时临场发挥
I'm gonna improvise.

1403
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:29,480
关于植入意念 我有件事你要知道
Listen, there's something you should know about me. About inception.

1404
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:46,430
意念如病毒顽强
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

1405
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:48,830
感染力强
Highly contagious.

1406
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:52,340
再细微的意念一旦植入 亦能萌芽成长
And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.

1407
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:55,380
它能成就你
It can grow to define...

1408
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:57,970
亦能摧毁你
...or destroy you.

1409
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:03,880
再细微的意念
The smallest idea, such as:

1410
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,850
如[我们的世界并非真实」
"Your world is not real."

1411
02:00:07,130 --> 02:00:10,890
极符其微的意念却足以改变一切
Simple little thought that changes everything.

1412
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:16,620
你肯定所处的世界是真实
So certain of your world. Of what's real.

1413
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:18,600
他也肯定吗?
Do you think he is?

1414
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:23,300
抑或他也和我一样迷茫?
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

1415
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:25,930
我能辨析真与幻
I know what's real, Mal.

1416
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:30,310
毫无私疑?
No creeping doubts?

1417
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:33,640
毫无困惑?
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1418
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,280
受诸通缉
Chased around the globe...

1419
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:38,110
亡命天涯
...by anonymous corporations and police forces...

1420
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:40,920
梦与实皆是这般
...the way the projections persecute the dreamer?

1421
02:00:42,540 --> 02:00:44,020
所言甚是?
Admit it.

1422
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:48,160
你根本不相信所谓的现实
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1423
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:49,860
做选择
So choose.

1424
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:52,300
选择留下与我
Choose to be here.

1425
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:54,290
长相思守
Choose me.

1426
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:21,420
你知道我身负重则
You know what I have to do.

1427
02:01:21,610 --> 02:01:24,260
我必须回到孩子身边
I have to get back to our children because you left them.

1428
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:27,130
皆因你抛弃我们
Because you left us.

1429
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:29,100
- 讲大话 - 我没讲大话
- You're wrong. I'm not wrong.

1430
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,300
你多疑
You're confused.

1431
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:34,470
我们的孩子在这里
Our children are here.

1432
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:38,510
想不想再看看他们
And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?

1433
02:01:38,690 --> 02:01:41,740
想 但我要回到现实世界去看他们
Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal.

1434
02:01:55,410 --> 02:01:57,390
现实世界?
Up above?

1435
02:01:58,310 --> 02:02:01,930
别痴人说梦 他们就在这
Listen to yourself. These are our children.

1436
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:03,840
看
Watch.

1437
02:02:04,350 --> 02:02:06,040
吉姆斯? 菲丽?
James? Phillipa?

1438
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:08,640
别这样 他们不是我的孩子
Don't do this, Mal. Please. Those aren't my children.

1439
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:11,280
你根本口说心非
You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it.

1440
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:13,350
- 我很清楚 - 如果你错了?
- No, I know it. - What if you're wrong?

1441
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:16,050
如果我才是真实的
What if I'm what's real?

1442
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:19,480
你不断灌输自己何为所信
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1443
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:23,290
究竟何为所信
But what do you believe?

1444
02:02:24,270 --> 02:02:25,490
何为所觉
What do you feel?

1445
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:29,060
自责
Guilt.

1446
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:32,500
我好自责
I feel guilt, Mal.

1447
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:36,970
无论我做什么 无论我多绝望
And no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am...

1448
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:41,410
无论我多迷惘 自责感总
...no matter how confused, that guilt is always there...

1449
02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:44,100
不断提醒我事实的真相
...reminding me of the truth.

1450
02:02:44,620 --> 02:02:45,910
真相?
What truth?

1451
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:53,580
是我让你怀疑一切
That the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me.

1452
02:02:56,970 --> 02:03:00,090
你对我植入意念?
You planted the idea in my mind?

1453
02:03:01,610 --> 02:03:03,090
她在说什么
What is she talking about?

1454
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:09,270
皆因我对她实验过 我才坚持植入意念是可行
The reason I knew inception was possible was because I did it to her first.

1455
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:13,280
- 我对内子植入意念 - 为什么
- I did it to my own wife. - Why?

1456
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:15,500
我们迷失于此
We were lost in here.

1457
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:21,080
我知我们须逃离梦空间 可她不允
I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it.

1458
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:29,950
她将其内心深处的想法深锁起来
She had locked something away, something deep inside.

1459
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:34,860
她本已知道事实 却选择遗忘
A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget.

1460
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,960
她不愿释放内心深处的想法
And she couldn't break free.

1461
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:43,400
所以我决定寻找她深锁的东西
So I decided to search for it.

1462
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:48,840
我潜入她意识 找寻深锁之地
I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.

1463
02:03:49,020 --> 02:03:50,910
我找寻到
And I broke in...

1464
02:03:51,490 --> 02:03:53,640
并植入意念
... and I planted an idea.

1465
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:58,150
极符其微的意念却足以改变一切
A simple little idea that would change everything.

1466
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,760
就是她所处的世界不是真实
That her world wasn't real.

1467
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:21,770
死亡是唯一逃离方法
That death was the only escape.

1468
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:30,950
你等待一列火车
You're waiting for a train.

1469
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:35,990
火车将带你远去他方
A train that'll take you far away.

1470
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:40,150
你深知前去何方
You know where you hope this train will take you...

1471
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:43,290
同时亦忧虑能否到达
...but you can't know for sure.

1472
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:45,990
不过无关紧要
Yet it doesn't matter.

1473
02:04:47,450 --> 02:04:50,600
- 告诉我为什么 - 彼此相聚已胜一切
- Now, tell me why! - Because you'll be together!

1474
02:04:54,950 --> 02:04:59,010
我不知此意念如癌症迅速扩散
But I never knew that that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1475
02:04:59,190 --> 02:05:01,580
甚至你醒来后
... that even after she woke...

1476
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:06,950
甚至你回到现实世界后
That even after you came back to reality...

1477
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:12,860
你仍相信所处的世界非真实
...that you'd continue to believe your world wasn't real.

1478
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:18,030
死亡是唯一逃离方法
That death was the only escape.

1479
02:05:18,210 --> 02:05:20,860
梅尔 不要
Mal, no! Jesus!

1480
02:05:21,050 --> 02:05:24,730
- 你潜入我意识 - 我本是想救你
- You infected my mind. - I was trying to save you.

1481
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:26,310
你背弃我
You betrayed me.

1482
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:30,840
你还来得及补救 来得及兑现誓言
But you can make amends. You can still keep your promise.

1483
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:34,040
留在我们创建的世界
We can still be together, right here...

1484
02:05:34,230 --> 02:05:36,680
一起双宿双栖
...in the world we built together.

1485
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:59,830
我们要去找费舍尔
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1486
02:07:00,710 --> 02:07:02,000
你们找不到他
You can't have him.

1487
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:06,470
- 若我留下 你可以让他离开吗? - 你在说什么
- Lf I stay here, will you let him go? - What are you talking about?

1488
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,780
费舍尔在走廊
Fischer is on the porch.

1489
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,940
- 检查他是否活着 - 你不能这么做
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne. - Cobb, you can't do this.

1490
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:18,750
快检查他是否活着
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

1491
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:37,500
他在这 时间到了 你得快来
He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!

1492
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:41,340
- 你带费舍尔回去 - 你不能跟她留在这
- You take Fischer with you, all right? - You can't stay here to be with her.

1493
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:46,610
齐藤死了
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1494
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:50,270
那他也在这地方 我得去找他
That means he's down here somewhere. That means I have to find him.

1495
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:55,380
我不会跟个虚幻的人留守此处
I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist.

1496
02:07:55,570 --> 02:07:58,960
我是你眼前唯一真实的人
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.

1497
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:00,460
错
No.

1498
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:03,060
敢情是
I wish.

1499
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:07,160
我好希望你是真实
I wish more than anything, but...

1500
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:11,000
我无法想象到完整的你
...I can't imagine you with all your complexity...

1501
02:08:11,180 --> 02:08:13,700
无法想象到理想的你与不理想的你
...all your perfection, all your imperfection.

1502
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:15,830
- 没事吧 - 没事
- You all right? - Yeah.

1503
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:17,840
看看你
Look at you.

1504
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:24,020
你只是个影子 只是我真实内子的影子
You're just a shade. You're just a shade of my real wife.

1505
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:27,080
是我想象出的最好投影影子
And you were the best that I could do, but...

1506
02:08:27,930 --> 02:08:30,360
很抱歉 你还不够好
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.

1507
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:32,150
这样感觉真实吗
Does this feel real?

1508
02:08:34,570 --> 02:08:37,160
- 你在做什么 - 临场发挥
- What are you doing? - Improvising.

1509
02:08:45,780 --> 02:08:47,470
No, no, no!

1510
02:08:48,450 --> 02:08:50,840
快进去
In there, now. Go, go, go.

1511
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:37,590
我很...
I was dis...

1512
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,630
很失望
I was dis... Disa...

1513
02:09:42,510 --> 02:09:45,020
我知道
- I know, Dad. - Dis...

1514
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:53,130
我知道你很失望
I know you were disappointed...

1515
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:55,310
我远不及你
...I couldn't be you.

1516
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:57,200
不对
No.

1517
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:58,940
不对 不对 不对
No, no, no.

1518
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:01,970
我之所以失望...
I was disappointed...

1519
02:10:03,730 --> 02:10:05,650
皆因你试图效我所为
...that you tried.

1520
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:30,570
什么?
What?

1521
02:10:40,030 --> 02:10:41,150
加油
Come on, come on.

1522
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:12,880
爸?
Dad?

1523
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:54,290
开始堕醒 阿丽雅德妮 快走
That's the kick, Ariadne! You have to go now!

1524
02:12:07,150 --> 02:12:10,580
别迷失自我 要带斋藤回来
Don't lose yourself! Find Saito and bring him back!

1525
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:12,410
我会的
I will!

1526
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:55,320
仍记得你求婚时的话语吗
You remember when you asked me to marry you?

1527
02:12:55,500 --> 02:12:56,580
仍记得
Yes.

1528
02:12:56,770 --> 02:12:59,820
你说你梦见们白头偕老
You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.

1529
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:04,020
我们皆可实现
But we did.

1530
02:13:05,980 --> 02:13:08,330
我们曾经白头偕老 还记得吗
We did. You don't remember?

1531
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:15,840
我想你想到无法忍受
I miss you more than I can bear...

1532
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:20,200
至少我们曾双宿双栖
...but we had our time together.

1533
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:23,610
我是时候放开你
And I have to let you go.

1534
02:13:25,730 --> 02:13:27,520
我必须放开你
I have to let you go.

1535
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:20,070
对不起
I'm sorry, Robert.

1536
02:14:47,750 --> 02:14:51,400
知道吗 那份遗嘱是要我另创天地
You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man...

1537
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:54,500
而非承袭父荫
...not just to live for him.

1538
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:58,640
我正有此意
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1539
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:09,650
什么事
What happened?

1540
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:11,820
- 柯布留在那里 - 和梅尔一起?
- Cobb stayed. - With Mal?

1541
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,260
不 是去找齐藤
No, to find Saito.

1542
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:17,290
他将会迷失自我
He'll be lost.

1543
02:15:19,850 --> 02:15:21,670
他会没事
No, he'll be all right.

1544
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:39,650
你是前来杀我
Have you come to kill me?

1545
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:46,390
我在等待一个人
I'm waiting for someone.

1546
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:53,630
一个隐约在梦中见过的人
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1547
02:15:56,380 --> 02:15:57,770
柯布?
Cobb?

1548
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:01,470
不可能
Impossible.

1549
02:16:02,020 --> 02:16:04,600
我们曾时值年轻
We were young men together.

1550
02:16:06,220 --> 02:16:08,550
我现已步入迟暮之年
I'm an old man.

1551
02:16:09,790 --> 02:16:11,840
终身抱怨
Filled with regret.

1552
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,690
孤独终老
Waiting to die alone.

1553
02:16:20,870 --> 02:16:23,020
我是回来找你
I've come back for you.

1554
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:30,170
帮你回忆一些事
To remind you of something.

1555
02:16:33,450 --> 02:16:35,810
一些你曾记得的事
Something you once knew.

1556
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:40,910
这个世界并非真实
That this world is not real.

1557
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:50,310
要我遵守协议
To convince me to honor our arrangement?

1558
02:16:51,170 --> 02:16:53,920
没错 冒险一试
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1559
02:17:00,050 --> 02:17:01,370
回去吧
Come back...

1560
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:07,270
重返年轻时
...so we can be young men together again.

1561
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:13,010
跟我回去
Come back with me.

1562
02:17:16,130 --> 02:17:17,550
回去
Come back.

1563
02:17:27,310 --> 02:17:28,990
先生 需要热毛巾吗
Hot towel, sir?

1564
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:32,500
飞机约廿分钟后会降落洛杉矶机场
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 20 minutes.

1565
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:34,970
需要入境登记表吗?
Do you need immigration forms?

1566
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:38,400
有劳
Thank you.

1567
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:40,500
先生 需要热毛巾吗
Hot towel, sir?

1568
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:44,500
- 不需要 - 需要入境登记表吗?
- No. - Do you need immigration forms?

1569
02:18:55,890 --> 02:18:56,940
欢迎回家 柯布先生
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1570
02:18:58,100 --> 02:18:59,710
多谢
Thank you, sir.

1571
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:45,130
欢迎
Welcome.

1572
02:19:45,610 --> 02:19:47,000
这边
This way.

1573
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:11,650
吉姆斯 菲利普斯
James? Phillipa?

1574
02:20:15,410 --> 02:20:16,660
看谁在这
Look who's here.

1575
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:23,330
嘿
Hey.

1576
02:20:24,450 --> 02:20:27,140
- 你们好 - 爹地
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you? - Daddy! Daddy!

1577
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:29,570
你们过得怎样
Daddy! How are you?

1578
02:20:30,690 --> 02:20:32,270
看我堆砌了什么
Look what I've been building!

1579
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:36,140
- 是什么 - 我们在悬崖上建了座房子
- What are you building? - We're building a house on the cliff!

1580
02:20:36,330 --> 02:20:39,180
悬崖上? 快带我去看看
On the cliff? Come on, I want you to show me. Can you show me?

1581
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:41,910
- 我们走 - 快点 爹地
- Let's go. - Come on, Daddy!

1582
02:20:56,390 --> 02:20:58,880
盗梦空间

1583
02:21:56,790 --> 02:21:58,950
盗梦空间

1584
02:27:55,020 --> 02:27:57,450
盗梦空间
