1
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:48,848
片名：蝙蝠侠

2
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,954
（高谭市）

3
00:02:57,101 --> 00:03:01,038
谢谢你，嗨
我要去亚道夫大饭店

4
00:02:57,136 --> 00:03:01,129
Thank you. Hi. I'd like
to go to the Adelphi Hotel.

5
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,007
抱歉，车子是我叫的

6
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,536
This is my cab.

7
00:03:04,043 --> 00:03:06,270
免了
我先来的呀

8
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,974
I was here first!

9
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:07,701
Oh, God.

10
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:08,073
天呀

11
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,805
计程车

12
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,080
计程车

13
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,813
走路过街吧

14
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,212
Let's go across. Come on.

15
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:21,556
We'll get one down the road.
Hurry.

16
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:22,057
到那边去叫，走

17
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:29,834
拜托，哈洛，快叫车呀

18
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,661
For God's sake, Harold,
can we please get a taxi?

19
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,857
我正在叫…计程车

20
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:31,563
I'm trying to get a--. Taxi!

21
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:33,898
We're going the wrong way!

22
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:33,921
方向错了

23
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:38,039
吉米，收起来
像土观光客似的

24
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:37,906
Put that away. We look like tourists.

25
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:39,072
嗨，甜心

26
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:40,902
Let's cut over to Seventh.

27
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:41,303
我们到第7街再说

28
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:44,206
-Seventh is that way.
-I know where we are!

29
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:42,742
第7街在那边

30
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:44,410
我知道方向

31
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,035
Hey, give me a dollar.

32
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,464
先生，赏一块钱吧

33
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:10,466
怎么样？一块钱而已

34
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:10,098
How about it? One dollar.

35
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:13,267
Are you deaf?
You don't speak English?

36
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,906
你聋了吗？不会说英语？

37
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:15,443
Come on! Up here.

38
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,314
快呀，到这里

39
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:20,615
Hey, lady...

40
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:23,873
女士，看小孩的份上
不要叫

41
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:23,220
...do the kid a favor. Don't scream.

42
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:45,530
收获不少

43
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:45,139
Hey, all right!

44
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:47,468
American Express card.

45
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:48,198
美国运通信用卡

46
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,744
"Don't leave home without it."

47
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,942
「出门别忘此卡」

48
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,413
Get out of here.

49
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,881
滚远点

50
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:57,645
I don' t like it up here.

51
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,083
说实话，我不喜欢这里

52
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:59,654
Are you scared of heights?

53
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,054
你有惧高症？

54
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:03,819
不知道，强尼的下场
使我害怕

55
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:03,484
I don't know. After what
happened to Johnny Gobs--

56
00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:07,996
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
took a walk off a roof. No big loss.

57
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:08,385
强尼是喝醉酒摔死的
没什么好伤心的

58
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:12,234
错了，我听说的不是这样

59
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:10,999
That ain't what I heard at all.

60
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:14,768
I heard that The Bat got him.

61
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:16,028
听说被蝙蝠侠抓走的

62
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:17,999
The Bat?! Give me a break, will you?

63
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,300
蝙蝠侠？得了吧

64
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:22,006
Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.

65
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:22,400
从4楼摔下去
一点血也没有

66
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:25,680
No shit. It was all over the pavement.

67
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:26,100
胡扯，人行道上一片红

68
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,284
-I'm getting out of here.
-Shut up. Listen to me.

69
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,554
我要走了
闭嘴，听我说

70
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:34,856
There ain't no Bat.

71
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,547
根本没有蝙蝠侠

72
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:39,461
You shouldn't have turned
the gun on that kid.

73
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:39,488
你不该用枪打那个孩子的

74
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:41,981
你究竟要不要你的钱？

75
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:44,533
You want your cut of this money
or not? Now shut up! Shut up!

76
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:45,005
大嘴给我闭上

77
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:29,994
别杀我

78
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,007
Don't kill me!

79
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,964
别杀我，兄弟

80
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:31,409
Don't kill me!

81
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,862
别杀我

82
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,008
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

83
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:37,086
I won't kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.

84
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,302
我不杀你，有事请你帮忙

85
00:06:37,256 --> 00:06:38,917
Tell all your friends about me.

86
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:39,576
带个话给你所有朋友

87
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:40,023
What are you?

88
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,442
你是什么东西？

89
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,006
我是蝙蝠侠

90
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,024
I'm Batman.

91
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:10,135
对全美国人而言
高谭市就是犯罪的代名词

92
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:05,606
Across this nation...

93
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,877
...the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.

94
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:15,005
街头暴力充斥
政府官员束手无策

95
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:14,221
Our streets are overrun, our
public officials are helpless.

96
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,394
As mayor, I promise to root out
the source of this corruption...

97
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:18,676
身为市长，我保证扫荡
犯罪的根源

98
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,621
...Boss Carl Grissom.

99
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:21,354
包斯卡尔格里森

100
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:24,299
Now, our new District
Attorney, Harvey Dent...

101
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,089
并由新任地方检查官
哈维丹特执行

102
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:27,298
...will carry out that promise.

103
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:27,581
哈维

104
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:32,983
谢谢

105
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:37,663
谢谢，布格市长，谢谢

106
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,912
Thank you, Mayor Borg.
Thank you.

107
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,633
高谭市民们

108
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:40,144
People of Gotham City...

109
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:43,144
...l'm a man of few words.

110
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:43,291
我一向言简意赅

111
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:48,099
不过却一言九鼎
言出必行

112
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:47,819
But those words will count,
and so will my actions.

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,597
Commissioner Gordon informs me that
he has targeted those businesses...

114
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:55,345
高登局长说他已经找出那些
为黑社会的非法营业

115
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,164
...suspected of fronting for
the syndicate in this city.

116
00:07:57,836 --> 00:07:59,497
Before this week is out...

117
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:03,060
这星期之内，我们将全面
大扫荡

118
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:02,997
...we are going to knock
down their doors...

119
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,689
直捣魔窟

120
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:07,676
...and shed the light of the
law on that nest of vipers.

121
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:12,197
只要大家团结

122
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:15,119
Together we can make this
city safe for decent people.

123
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:17,574
便可以建设成一个理性
高尚的城市

124
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:20,472
高尚的人不该住本市

125
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,280
Decent people shouldn't live here.

126
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:23,581
换个地方会更快乐

127
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:23,183
They'd be happier someplace else.

128
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:26,605
听说卡尔是个铁腕硬汉

129
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:26,027
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

130
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:28,362
Forget about it.

131
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,075
你放心好了

132
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,637
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.

133
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,756
那个小丑敢碰格里森一下
早就被我吊死了

134
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:37,038
If Grissom knew about us...

135
00:08:34,762 --> 00:08:41,128
格里森要知道你我的事
你也不会好过的

136
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,874
...he might hand you something.

137
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,311
Don't flatter yourself, angel.

138
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:45,155
你别往脸上帖金了

139
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,313
He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.

140
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:50,272
他已年迈花甲
缺了我，他控制不了本市

141
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:51,883
And besides...

142
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:52,671
再说嘛…

143
00:08:54,144 --> 00:08:56,371
他也不知道

144
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,887
...he doesn't know.

145
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,997
You don't worry about
anything, do you, Jack?

146
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,409
你真的毫不在乎？杰克

147
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,002
You look fine.

148
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:15,046
帅哥

149
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,363
我没问你

150
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,911
I didn't ask.

151
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:30,037
对，好好保重，保重

152
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:28,916
Yeah. Hanging on.

153
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,809
你别说，让我猜

154
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,929
Let me guess.

155
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:44,666
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.

156
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:45,285
一只巨大，超级动物
像只蝙蝠

157
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:47,673
That's it. What are
they seeing up there?

158
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,485
没错，上面怎么回事？

159
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,941
They're drinking Drano.

160
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,495
喝了通乐

161
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:51,342
It's weird.

162
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:54,053
有点怪异，警官
谢谢你的情报

163
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:53,106
Thanks for the tip.

164
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:56,443
Christ. Knox.

165
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,066
要命，又是诺克

166
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:59,786
Lieutenant, I hear we
had another Bat attack.

167
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:59,494
听说蝙蝠攻击人类

168
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:05,103
一个月之内连续八起
听说局长下令彻查呀？

169
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:04,860
That's 8 sightings in a month. I hear
the Commissioner's opened a file.

170
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:09,108
抱歉，诺克
这两个人踩香蕉皮跌死的

171
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,793
Sorry, Knox. These two
slipped on a banana peel.

172
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,216
我没骗你
是只巨大的蝙蝠

173
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:12,797
I'm telling you, a giant bat!

174
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,446
继续走

175
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:20,649
最后别登在报上
以免毁了报社的声名

176
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:20,809
Don't write about this. It will ruin
your already useless reputation.

177
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,372
Lieutenant, every punk
in this town is scared.

178
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:25,613
警官，全镇的游民都吓得
魂不守舍的

179
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:27,379
They say he can't be killed.

180
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:27,197
知道他们怎么说吗？

181
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:30,253
说他刀枪不入
专喝人血

182
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:29,643
They say he drinks blood.

183
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:33,051
I say you're full of shit, Knox.

184
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,798
还说…
我说，你满嘴狗臭屁

185
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:38,326
You can quote me on that.

186
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:38,697
这句话可以引述

187
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:42,232
Is there a 6-foot bat in Gotham City?

188
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:42,398
高谭市真的有只6尺
蝙蝠吗？

189
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:45,173
他是领警察薪水的吗？

190
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,662
Is he on the police payroll?

191
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:47,667
What's he pulling down, after taxes?

192
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:48,582
扣了税以后，年薪多少？

193
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:20,206
带给你的小点心，艾哈特

194
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:19,192
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.

195
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:24,098
-Why don't you broadcast it?
-Shut up and listen.

196
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:22,353
干嘛不去广播？

197
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:24,710
闭嘴听我说

198
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:29,273
Harvey Dent has been sniffing
around one of our front companies.

199
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,850
哈维丹特盯上了咱们一家
前卫公司

200
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:33,882
That's my territory.
If there's a problem, I deal with it.

201
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:34,219
我的地盘，任何问题我会
处理

202
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:38,161
你的问题也是我们的

203
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:36,544
Your problems are our problems.

204
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:42,562
我只对格里森负责
不是神经病

205
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,453
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.

206
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:44,960
You ought to think about the future.

207
00:11:42,608 --> 00:11:45,847
你该为未来想想

208
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:48,795
You mean when you run the show?
You got no future.

209
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:50,473
你以为你能接管？
你最好别做梦，杰克

210
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:53,560
You're an A-1 nut-boy,
and Grissom knows it.

211
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:54,383
你是神经加三级
格里森心里有数

212
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,849
考虑清楚哟

213
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:00,972
Better be sure.

214
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,179
瞧吧？

215
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:07,807
See?

216
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:11,581
You can make a good
decision when you try.

217
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:12,693
愿意的话是可以做出
明智的决定

218
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:22,161
Where you been spending your nights?

219
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:21,630
你在哪过夜的？

220
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:31,164
I don't care if this festival
is in debt, I want a parade.

221
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,512
我不管预算如何
我要举办游行

222
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:33,675
I want hot dogs, balloons, everything.

223
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,974
有热狗、汽球

224
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,946
热热闹闹地庆祝2百周年
纪念日

225
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:37,608
We'll celebrate this 200th
anniversary proudly and publicly.

226
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,823
还是庆祝破产吧

227
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:39,680
We may celebrate
in bankruptcy court.

228
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:42,690
债务已经25万
还没看见半个汽球

229
00:12:39,951 --> 00:12:43,284
It's $250,000 in debt and we
haven't seen one balloon.

230
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,632
只要把人找来
生意自然会有

231
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:46,958
You fill the square with people,
and businesses will come back.

232
00:12:46,928 --> 00:12:49,656
很多人会怕的躲起来

233
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:50,025
A lot of people may stay away.
They're scared.

234
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:53,357
有了格里森干地检
就不用怕了

235
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:53,196
They won't be scared when you
get Grissom in the courthouse.

236
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:55,865
I promised that, remember?

237
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:56,370
我承诺过，记得吗？

238
00:12:58,803 --> 00:13:01,135
Welcome, Count Dracula.

239
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,738
欢迎吸血爵士光临

240
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,631
Had any sightings of Big Foot lately?

241
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,762
最近有没「大脚」的消息

242
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:06,713
你的连载已被蝙蝠侠
取代了

243
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:07,305
-They buried your story on Batman.
-They bury garbage.

244
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:10,842
垃圾就该如此处理
可以得普立兹新闻奖的

245
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:10,308
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff.

246
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:12,646
I got something for you.

247
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:12,999
诺克，有东西给你

248
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,515
真好笑

249
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:19,287
Very funny. You should have
put more gore under the fangs.

250
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,714
獠牙下该画几滴口水的

251
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:21,652
What a dick.

252
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:22,019
傻乓桓

253
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:25,990
Hello, legs.

254
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,836
哈罗，长腿姊姊

255
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,231
I'm reading your stuff.

256
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:30,736
我在看你的报导

257
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:32,163
Well, I'm reading yours.

258
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:33,334
我在看你的美腿

259
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:34,504
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

260
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:35,406
嗨，我是维琪瓦尔

261
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:37,731
Yeah, photographer.
Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.

262
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,304
维琪瓦尔，流行和大都会
摄影师

263
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:41,172
If you want me to pose nude,
you'll need a long lens.

264
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:41,902
对，想拍我裸照的话
得把镜头拉长

265
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:44,010
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.

266
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:44,644
其实我正在拍战争的东西

267
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,409
拍那玩意会有危险的

268
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:47,675
You could get hurt doing this stuff.

269
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,513
What brings you here?

270
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,026
什么风把你吹来的？

271
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:53,688
I'm here to see the
wildlife in Gotham City.

272
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:54,039
来看高谭市野生动物的

273
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:56,416
Wildlife? Like what?

274
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:55,562
野生？

275
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:57,461
比方说…

276
00:13:58,096 --> 00:13:59,757
Like...bats.

277
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,524
比方说…蝙蝠

278
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,403
谁派你来的？

279
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:04,265
-Who sent you?
-Nobody, really.

280
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,696
没…没人

281
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:06,697
I just loved your story, and...

282
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:07,335
我喜欢你的报导…

283
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,668
我喜欢蝙蝠

284
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,597
...l like bats.

285
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:11,597
真的？

286
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,705
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.

287
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:17,070
我的照片加上你的报导
保证得奖，考虑看看

288
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:19,539
Okay, you're a visionary, and also
the only one who believes me.

289
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:20,375
算你有远见
也是唯一相信我的人

290
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:21,046
I need something tangible.

291
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,044
我需要确凿的证据

292
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,712
Gordon's got a file. I can't
even get him on the phone.

293
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,538
高登有档案
他连我电话都不接

294
00:14:25,557 --> 00:14:27,548
He'll be at Bruce
Wayne's benefit, right?

295
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:29,322
他会参加布鲁斯韦恩
慈善义演，你会去吧？

296
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:31,125
Yeah. I don't seem to be
on the guest list. No.

297
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,647
对，只是名单上没有我

298
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:33,660
没有

299
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:35,662
对，对

300
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:36,798
Yes, yes. Vale, will you marry me?

301
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:39,031
维琪，你愿意嫁我吗？
不要

302
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:39,126
-No.
-Buy me lunch?

303
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:49,112
请我吃饭？    有可能
我食量不大

304
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:41,895
-Maybe.
-I eat light.

305
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,241
Say this...

306
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:50,300
万一…

307
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,478
...son-of-a-bitch...

308
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:52,813
这个王八蛋

309
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:56,150
...makes a connection with
us and with Axis Chemical.

310
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:55,608
查出艾克斯化学厂

311
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,953
真不知后果会如可

312
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,753
What kind of damage
are we looking at?

313
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,353
万一被他查到了
咱们真的完蛋了

314
00:14:58,923 --> 00:15:02,256
If he ties us with Axis Chemical,
we're dead and buried.

315
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:04,826
We should move immediately.

316
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:05,452
我们该立刻采取行动

317
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,921
I say we break into the place...

318
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:08,474
我建议突击该厂

319
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,927
...trash the office...

320
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:10,686
把办公室捣烂

321
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:14,666
...and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.

322
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,688
把纪录毁掉，宣称是工业
间谍干的

323
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:20,528
聪明，这么做才对

324
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:20,444
Smart thinking. That's
the way to go. In fact...

325
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:25,436
我要你亲自指挥这个行动

326
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:24,012
...l'd like you to handle
this operation personally.

327
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:27,109
Me?

328
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:27,594
我？

329
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:35,521
哈罗，甜心

330
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:37,959
Would you mind waiting
in the next room?

331
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,118
你不介意去隔壁等吗？

332
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:55,030
没事，各位
谢谢光临，没事了

333
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:53,808
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
That's all.

334
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,012
可否派别人去？

335
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:09,989
Can somebody else do this?

336
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:14,485
我受不了化学味

337
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:13,562
The fumes in that place....

338
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,413
杰克

339
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:20,164
It's an important job. I need...

340
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,970
这次行动关系重大

341
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:22,496
...someone I can trust.

342
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,932
我需要个信得过的人

343
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:26,337
You...are my number one guy.

344
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:28,092
你是我的左右手

345
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:30,178
Now...

346
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,467
你…

347
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:33,177
...don't forget...

348
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:33,188
别忘了

349
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,977
你的幸运牌

350
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,348
...your lucky deck.

351
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:52,219
朋友，你就要走运了

352
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,361
My friend...

353
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:53,866
...your luck is about to change.

354
00:16:57,776 --> 00:16:59,266
Police Department.

355
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:59,121
警察局

356
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:01,943
Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

357
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,562
请接艾哈特警官

358
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,644
需要我效劳吗？先生

359
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:45,879
Can I help you, sir?

360
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,906
不用了，多谢你

361
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,607
赏你的

362
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:05,057
晚安，小姐
人多了点

363
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,572
-Good evening.
-A little crowded.

364
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,661
对不起，对不起…

365
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:19,133
请教布鲁斯韦恩是谁？

366
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:17,748
Could you tell me
which is Bruce Wayne?

367
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:21,082
我没把握

368
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:20,246
I'm not sure.

369
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:23,710
还是得谢你

370
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,623
Thanks anyway.

371
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:25,577
是呀

372
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,505
谢谢

373
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,011
快下注

374
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,544
8点

375
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:59,519
Eight. I can make that eight.

376
00:18:57,684 --> 00:18:59,546
我一丢就是8点

377
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:01,862
I can make that eight.

378
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:02,643
请下注

379
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:04,866
Commissioner!
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.

380
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:05,552
局长，高登太太
你真漂亮

381
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:08,537
Is it true the Commissioner
has a file on the Batman?

382
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:09,046
局长真的有蝙蝠侠的档案
不是真的吧？

383
00:19:08,806 --> 00:19:12,799
There is no Bat. If there were,
we would find and arrest him.

384
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:12,581
没有什么蝙蝠
有的话早抓走了

385
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:15,115
跟他坦白说，局长

386
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:15,376
Be straight with me, Commissioner.

387
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:16,897
手气还好吧？

388
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:17,205
How you making out?

389
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,221
糟透了

390
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:19,541
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.

391
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:20,828
丹特先生
我喜欢你的领带

392
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:23,309
We were discussing winged vigilantes.
What's your stand?

393
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:24,665
我们正在谈飞行义警的事
你的立场如何？

394
00:19:23,555 --> 00:19:26,046
We have enough problems
in this city...

395
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:27,574
诺克先生，本市的问题
已经够多了

396
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:28,815
...without worrying about ghosts.

397
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:30,137
没暇为鬼力乱神之事
操心了

398
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,551
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.

399
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,338
没错，我无法否认

400
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:35,643
失陪一下，我马上回来

401
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:35,494
Excuse me, I'll be back.

402
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,325
Won't anybody go on record?

403
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:37,614
有谁要公开发表一下的？

404
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:40,649
阁下，好棒的西装
无以置评

405
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,661
-Your Honor, great suit.
-No comment.

406
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:43,611
什么事？罗勃

407
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,571
What's up?

408
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:47,749
匿名情报
纳皮尔扫荡了艾克斯厂

409
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:46,835
Anonymous tip. Napier's
cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

410
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,029
为什么没人告诉我？
是谁负责的

411
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:56,918
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?

412
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,167
艾哈特
真要命

413
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:59,522
-Echkhardt.
-Oh, my God!

414
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:00,334
咱们走

415
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:01,190
Come on, let's go.

416
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,246
高登先生？

417
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,520
Mr. Gordon?

418
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,784
高登先生？

419
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:14,765
Mr. Gordon?

420
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:27,953
等一下，起居间？
餐厅？还是弹药库

421
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:27,214
Wait, wait. Living room,
dining room, arsenal.

422
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:29,616
Look at this stuff.

423
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,227
瞧瞧这些玩意

424
00:20:29,954 --> 00:20:31,945
Who is this guy?

425
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,426
这家伙是谁？

426
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:36,951
He gives to humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.

427
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,192
一个人道主义者
居然收集这种玩意

428
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:40,891
He probably does it to get chicks.
They like his charity balls.

429
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,799
还不是为了交女人
她们喜欢他的慈善舞会

430
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,965
Don't leave out
his very large bankroll.

431
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:44,968
别忘了他的存款数字

432
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:47,136
The more they've got,
the less they're worth.

433
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:48,285
越有钱，人越不值钱

434
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:50,805
This guy must be the most
worthless guy in America.

435
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:52,382
那么他八成是全美国
价格最底的人

436
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:55,739
Check this out. He must have been
the king of the Wicker People.

437
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:56,251
你瞧这个
他八成是稻草人之王

438
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:59,078
Where'd this come from?

439
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,119
这是哪来的？

440
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:01,224
我不知道

441
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:01,114
I have no idea.

442
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,228
是日本的

443
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:04,077
It's Japanese.

444
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,334
你怎么知道？

445
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:05,820
How do you know?

446
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:08,764
我打日本买的

447
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:08,485
I bought it in Japan.

448
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:10,703
你是谁？

449
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:12,154
-Who are you?
-Sorry. Bruce Wayne.

450
00:21:10,706 --> 00:21:13,434
抱歉，布鲁斯韦恩

451
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,207
亚历山大诺克

452
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:14,989
Alexander Knox.

453
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,408
我看过你的报导
佩服之至

454
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:19,000
I read your work. I like it a lot.

455
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,999
Thanks. Can I have a grant?

456
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:21,850
谢了，捐一点吧

457
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:23,849
维琪瓦尔

458
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:23,504
Vicki Vale.

459
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:26,319
嗨
布鲁斯韦恩

460
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:27,504
Are you sure?

461
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:29,220
没搞错吧？
对，错不了

462
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,681
Yeah. I've seen your pictures
from Corto Maltese, haven't l?

463
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:32,087
我看过你战争的作品

464
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:33,454
对

465
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,448
You've got a wonderful eye.

466
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,685
你的眼光独到

467
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:37,348
Some people think she has two.

468
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,093
该说是两只的

469
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:41,789
This is a wonderful house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime.

470
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:42,368
这栋房子好壮观
希望能有机会拍

471
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:43,433
韦恩先生

472
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:45,695
We need more champagne.
Is that all right?

473
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:46,402
我们还需要几箱香槟
可以吧？

474
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,691
Sure. Go ahead.

475
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,343
当然，请便

476
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:50,363
开几箱？6箱？

477
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,462
How many cases? Six? Six?

478
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,773
6箱，好，6箱好

479
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:53,136
Six is good.

480
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:54,148
可以

481
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:56,912
好的，6箱，谢谢

482
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,749
你会在高谭市待一阵吗？

483
00:21:56,974 --> 00:21:58,805
Will you be in Gotham for a while?

484
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:03,980
I plan to be. I'm intrigued
by Alex's giant bat stories.

485
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:01,302
我很愿意

486
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:05,378
我对亚历山大的蝙蝠报导
很有兴趣

487
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:06,479
Oh, right. The bat--. Batman.

488
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:07,515
对，蝙蝠侠

489
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:12,398
可以调剂一下战争的
火药味对吧？

490
00:22:08,986 --> 00:22:11,477
A bit light after the
war in Corto Maltese, no?

491
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,721
What do you do for a living?

492
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,523
你是干哪一行的？

493
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:15,827
我…

494
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:18,223
Commissioner Gordon
was compelled to leave.

495
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:18,424
高登局长想告辞了

496
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:20,090
好的，谢谢你

497
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:21,996
Very unexpectedly, sir.

498
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:22,791
相当出乎意料，先生

499
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:25,439
两位恕我告退了

500
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:25,058
Will you two excuse me?

501
00:22:25,473 --> 00:22:28,076
请这边走，先生

502
00:22:25,503 --> 00:22:28,165
I think perhaps this way, sir.

503
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:29,234
对

504
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,575
They need wine in the front room, and
a Mrs. Daley needs a copy of the menu.

505
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,448
前面还需要些酒
戴里太戈还需要一份菜单

506
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:38,785
对了，捐点钱给诺克

507
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:37,674
And give Knox a grant.

508
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:45,824
很高兴跟你聊，韦恩
富人…

509
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:44,014
Nice talking with you, Wayne.

510
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:45,920
The rich....

511
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:50,119
知道他们为什么怪异吗？
因为有钱经得起

512
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,421
Know why they're so odd?
They can afford to be.

513
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:51,192
Look at this mirror.

514
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:51,965
你看这面镜子

515
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:53,420
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.

516
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,792
该叫布鲁斯浮华的

517
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:33,827
罗勃    什么事？

518
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:34,966
-What's up?
-Anonymous tip.

519
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:35,339
匿名情报

520
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,469
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

521
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:38,404
纳皮尔扫荡了艾克斯厂

522
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:40,905
If we could get him,
we'd have Grissom.

523
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:41,844
好，只要逮了他
格里森也跑不了

524
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,076
为何没人告诉我？
谁负责的？

525
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:44,311
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?

526
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:47,142
-Eckhardt.
-Oh, my God!

527
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:46,243
艾哈特

528
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,308
要命

529
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:49,154
咱们走

530
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:48,976
Come on, let's go.

531
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,218
你看清楚了

532
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:01,823
就是他

533
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:04,304
（通缉犯：杰克纳皮尔）

534
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:06,129
看个清楚

535
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:06,093
Get a good look.

536
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,402
格杀勿论

537
00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:09,766
Shoot to kill.
You know what I mean?

538
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,132
懂我意思吧？

539
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,895
好了，出发吧

540
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:13,038
Let's move out.

541
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,531
我们被摆道了，各位

542
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:48,576
We've been ratted out, boys.

543
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:49,597
小心

544
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:49,905
Watch it.

545
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,177
不准动

546
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:57,414
Freeze!

547
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:17,322
你去右翼，快

548
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,771
You take the right. Move it.

549
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:20,136
怎么回事？

550
00:25:18,776 --> 00:25:20,437
What the hell's going on?!

551
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,607
你想干什么？泄底吗？

552
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:25,012
-What are you trying to do?
-I'm in charge, not Carl Grissom.

553
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:25,931
这儿由我负责
不是卡尔格里森

554
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:30,511
我是高登局长
我要抓活口

555
00:25:26,517 --> 00:25:30,510
This is Commissioner Gordon.
I want him taken alive.

556
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:32,148
重覆一次

557
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:35,521
I repeat. Any man who opens fire
on Jack Napier will answer to me.

558
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:36,317
谁开枪打伤杰克
就得对我负责

559
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:24,840
Let me down!

560
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:25,407
放我下来

561
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:27,190
放了我

562
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:27,337
Let me down!

563
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,296
放了我

564
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:30,839
Let me down!

565
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:33,477
天呀

566
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,906
Oh, my God!

567
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:43,266
到旁边的过道上

568
00:27:42,743 --> 00:27:46,180
你守那一边，务必小心

569
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:45,419
Get up on the catwalk on that side.

570
00:27:45,656 --> 00:27:48,147
You take that side. Be very careful.

571
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:48,338
千万别大意

572
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:04,750
老天爷

573
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:04,305
Jesus!

574
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:10,765
放了他
否则我就杀高登

575
00:28:06,677 --> 00:28:09,612
Let him go...or I'll do Gordon.

576
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,071
好漂亮的行头

577
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:22,951
Nice outfit.

578
00:28:35,658 --> 00:28:38,219
快呀，杰克，咱们走

579
00:28:35,873 --> 00:28:37,966
Come on, Jack, let's go!

580
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,487
快点，杰克

581
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:46,146
Come on!

582
00:28:47,764 --> 00:28:49,428
艾哈特

583
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:48,874
Eckhardt!

584
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:53,630
替未来想一下

585
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:52,888
Think about the future.

586
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:39,307
他妈的，已经到手了

587
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,932
Goddamn it, we had him!

588
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:41,311
不准动

589
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,761
Hold it right there!

590
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:57,304
那小子是谁？

591
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:58,381
-Who is this guy?
-I don't know.

592
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,859
不知道

593
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:03,498
I查明真相前，别说出去

594
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:03,053
Until we find him, keep a lid on it.

595
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:30,397
如果真没蝙蝠侠
是谁把杰克丢进硫酸中？

596
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:30,250
If there's no Bat, then who
dropped Napier into the acid?

597
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,757
自杀呀
等等，我要录音，好吧？

598
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:33,751
Suicide?! I want to get this on tape.

599
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:35,268
喂…

600
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:36,967
他挂了

601
00:30:35,593 --> 00:30:38,494
He hung up. What have you got?

602
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,709
你找到了什么？
这是市内

603
00:30:38,762 --> 00:30:40,423
Here's the inner city.

604
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:42,442
这是艾克斯厂
这是露面的地点

605
00:30:40,598 --> 00:30:42,327
Here's the sightings so far.

606
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:45,653
蝙蝠侠可能有固定的
飞行路线

607
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:46,428
Maybe Batman has some
sort of flight pattern.

608
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:48,549
这是我的想法
非常好，这样好了

609
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:50,936
This is very good. Tonight we'll go
to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.

610
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:51,574
今晚先请你去吃饭
然后去散个步

611
00:30:51,175 --> 00:30:53,769
No can do. I got a date.
Bruce Wayne.

612
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:54,951
不行，我和布鲁斯韦恩
先约好了

613
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:56,108
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!

614
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:57,685
韦恩，不行
你又能怎么样？

615
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:59,109
The guy's a stiff.
You could do much better.

616
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:00,029
那家伙是个呆头鹅
配不上你

617
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,611
Thanks for being so concerned.

618
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,658
谢谢你的关心，再见

619
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:18,402
汤还好吧？

620
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:17,697
How's the soup?

621
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:20,841
对不起

622
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,136
Excuse me?

623
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:24,871
The soup. How is it?

624
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:25,712
我说汤，怎么样？

625
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:27,515
太好了

626
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,640
It's great.

627
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:35,428
盐传过来好吗？

628
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:34,214
Could you pass the salt?

629
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:36,690
好的

630
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,844
我家好找吗？

631
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:56,899
Did you have trouble
finding the house?

632
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:59,751
很容易，没问题

633
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:00,907
-It was no problem.
-Good.

634
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:00,806
好

635
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:08,524
你喜欢在这儿吃饭？

636
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:07,248
Do you like eating here?

637
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:10,450
对

638
00:32:15,596 --> 00:32:20,001
老实说我以前没来过这里

639
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,592
I don't think I've been
in this room before.

640
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:23,036
你想去吗？

641
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:23,031
You want to leave?

642
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:24,058
对

643
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:24,527
Yes.

644
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,912
布鲁斯主人小时候

645
00:32:32,543 --> 00:32:34,875
There was young Master Bruce...

646
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:38,007
骑着一匹小灰马跟着我

647
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:38,113
...leading his grey pony
with me on its back...

648
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:41,991
像一袋刚挖出来的马铃薯

649
00:32:38,382 --> 00:32:42,944
...like a sack of old potatoes, covered
in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.

650
00:32:43,925 --> 00:32:47,925
那是我有生第一次教他
骑术

651
00:32:44,054 --> 00:32:48,047
That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.

652
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:52,721
那一次让他一直很尴尬

653
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:52,228
I think I've embarrassed
him for long enough.

654
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,817
我该去睡了

655
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,724
I'm off to bed.

656
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:58,759
拜托，不用动
我明早再收拾

657
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:58,630
Please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.

658
00:32:58,906 --> 00:33:00,602
晚安，小姐
晚安，阿福

659
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:02,772
晚安，先生
晚安，阿福

660
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:10,038
他真好

661
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:11,977
He's really wonderful.
He loves you a lot.

662
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:12,051
他很爱你

663
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:16,150
阿福是很棒
连袜子都得靠他找

664
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:16,083
Alfred's great. I couldn't
find my socks without him.

665
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,892
他令我想起我爷爷

666
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:19,653
He reminds me of my grandfather.

667
00:33:20,637 --> 00:33:22,416
你们很亲吗？

668
00:33:20,924 --> 00:33:22,323
Were you close to him?

669
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:26,033
对，我常和他及奶奶
一起过暑假

670
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:25,590
I used to spend summers with
him and my grandmother.

671
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:30,493
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...

672
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,433
他们住在湖边
虽比不上你家，可是…

673
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,634
很好玩

674
00:33:31,268 --> 00:33:32,667
...it was fun.

675
00:33:33,118 --> 00:33:35,835
不错嘛    对

676
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:34,995
That sounds nice.

677
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:39,933
你的家人呢？

678
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:39,436
What about your family?

679
00:33:41,615 --> 00:33:44,134
其实…只有阿福

680
00:33:41,678 --> 00:33:44,112
Actually, Alfred is my family.

681
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:52,618
这里的一切似乎跟你
很不衬

682
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:52,114
This house and all this stuff
doesn't seem like you at all.

683
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:58,086
有些东西很像我

684
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:57,353
Some of it is very much me.

685
00:33:58,766 --> 00:34:00,962
有些不是

686
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,360
Some isn't.

687
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:04,634
餐厅绝对不是

688
00:34:01,965 --> 00:34:04,798
That dining room
is definitely not you.

689
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,593
对，没错

690
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:06,466
The dining room isn't.

691
00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:17,102
（手术室）

692
00:34:29,732 --> 00:34:32,418
看看结果吧
好

693
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,858
Let's see how we did.

694
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,110
Oh, my God!

695
00:34:54,443 --> 00:34:55,649
镜子

696
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:55,607
Mirror.

697
00:34:57,258 --> 00:34:59,016
拿镜子来

698
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:58,946
Mirror!

699
00:35:08,102 --> 00:35:11,820
你知道神经已完全毁了

700
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:12,562
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed.

701
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,735
你也看到我用什么工具了

702
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:20,743
You see what I have
to work with here.

703
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:45,217
这地方到处是楼梯

704
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,599
There's an awful lot of
stairs in this place.

705
00:35:45,597 --> 00:35:47,793
两条腿快断了

706
00:35:45,836 --> 00:35:47,667
My feet are killing me.

707
00:35:49,235 --> 00:35:50,535
好了

708
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,843
我有点醉了

709
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:59,338
I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.

710
00:35:57,848 --> 00:35:59,106
你却没事

711
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,805
再一杯下肚就要飞了

712
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,277
One drink and I'm flying.

713
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:04,808
你害怕飞行不成？

714
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:04,513
Why are you afraid of flying?

715
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:37,078
是你吗？小甜点

716
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,983
That you, sugar bumps?

717
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:39,840
你是谁？

718
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:40,216
Who are you?

719
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,541
是我

720
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,648
It's me.

721
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:44,783
小甜点

722
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,821
"Sugar bumps."

723
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,322
谢天谢地，你没死
我听说你…

724
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,567
You're alive! I heard you'd been--

725
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:55,920
烤死了？
你是这么听说的？

726
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:53,894
Fried?

727
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:56,232
Is that what you heard?

728
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,902
为了一个娘们陷害我

729
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,834
You set me up over a woman.

730
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:01,602
一个娘们

731
00:37:00,077 --> 00:37:01,567
A woman!

732
00:37:02,106 --> 00:37:04,156
你八成是疯了

733
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:04,337
You must be insane.

734
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,847
免了吧

735
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:19,861
Don't bother.

736
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:23,319
你命狗屎不值

737
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:23,925
Your life won't be worth spit!

738
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,826
我已经死了一次

739
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,701
I've been dead once already.

740
00:37:27,964 --> 00:37:29,868
感觉很自由

741
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:29,936
It's very liberating...

742
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:34,059
不妨当做是一种…治疗

743
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:33,366
...if you think of it as...therapy.

744
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:37,824
杰克，听我说

745
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,210
Jack, listen.

746
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:42,870
或许咱俩可以谈个条件

747
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,874
Maybe we can cut a deal.

748
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:44,705
杰克？

749
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,280
Jack?

750
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,040
杰克早死了，朋友

751
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:47,554
Jack is dead, my friend.

752
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:51,701
叫我丑客好了

753
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:50,053
You can call me...

754
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,383
...Joker.

755
00:37:52,393 --> 00:37:57,413
你也看得出来
我比过去更快乐了

756
00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:54,457
As you can see...

757
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,392
...l'm a lot happier.

758
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,249
Oh, what a day.

759
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,199
光荣的日子

760
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:20,296
高谭市呀

761
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,309
Gotham City.

762
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:25,696
我一见你就笑

763
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:26,554
It always brings a smile to my face.

764
00:39:29,788 --> 00:39:31,713
飞行怪胎

765
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,485
"Winged Freak...

766
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:37,238
人心惶惶

767
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:37,226
...Terrorizes--"

768
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:43,942
还没见识过老子呢

769
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,169
Wait'll they get a load of me.

770
00:39:58,138 --> 00:39:59,500
我有个妙计

771
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:03,025
I've got an idea. How about lunch at
my place? I'll show you some photos.

772
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:03,242
到我家吃午饭
给你看些照片

773
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,750
Sure. Okay.

774
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:04,880
好呀，好…

775
00:40:04,883 --> 00:40:08,341
等一下，我不能去
我抽不出空

776
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:08,361
Wait a minute. No, I can't.
I can't make it.

777
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:11,344
好吧，晚点再去

778
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,527
Okay, we'll do it later in the day.

779
00:40:11,377 --> 00:40:16,784
不行，晚点也不成
今天有个重要的会议

780
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:16,205
I can't make it then, either. I've
got a very important meeting today.

781
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:18,548
怎么了？

782
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,930
What's wrong?

783
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,020
没什么

784
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,035
Nothing.

785
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:24,417
真的，我只想离开几天

786
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,612
I have to leave town for a few days.

787
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,933
好吧，等你回来再说

788
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:27,208
Okay, we'll do it when you get back.

789
00:40:26,935 --> 00:40:28,016
好的

790
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:30,998
我该走了，不早了

791
00:40:28,118 --> 00:40:30,211
I have to go. I'm late.

792
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:33,532
再见

793
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:46,105
阿福

794
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:49,879
真高兴又见到你，小姐
彼此

795
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,903
-Nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you, too.

796
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,975
I'll talk to you guys
when you get back.

797
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,822
等你们回来再说罗

798
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,886
回来？可能要好一阵哟

799
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:57,145
Back, Miss Vale? We'll be
here for quite a while.

800
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:01,058
好吧，再见

801
00:41:08,611 --> 00:41:09,931
甜心

802
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:14,257
You'll never believe what
happened to me today.

803
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:14,404
你绝不相信我今天的遭遇

804
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,282
各位，情况就是如此

805
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:32,975
So, gentlemen, that's how it is.
Until Grissom...resurfaces...

806
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:35,025
在格里森露面之前
我是代理董事长

807
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,077
...l'm the acting president.

808
00:41:35,063 --> 00:41:40,365
我决定在周年纪念日
攻击高谭市

809
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:38,810
And I say, starting with
this anniversary festival...

810
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:41,148
...we run this city
into the ground.

811
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,596
为什么不等格里森决定？

812
00:41:41,424 --> 00:41:43,415
Why don't we hear this from Grissom?

813
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,089
对

814
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,820
Yeah.

815
00:41:45,311 --> 00:41:48,205
他奸笑个什么劲？

816
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:47,927
And what's with that stupid grin?

817
00:41:49,305 --> 00:41:51,898
上帝对我很眷顾

818
00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:51,592
Life's been good to me.

819
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:58,152
如果我们拒绝呢？

820
00:41:55,605 --> 00:41:57,334
What if we say "no"?

821
00:41:59,856 --> 00:42:01,416
东尼呀…

822
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,880
没人喜欢战争

823
00:42:02,512 --> 00:42:04,673
Nobody wants a war.

824
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:07,391
生意不成仁义在

825
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:09,851
If we can't do business, we'll just
shake hands and that'll be it.

826
00:42:07,665 --> 00:42:09,214
是吗？

827
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,123
没错

828
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:11,081
Yeah?

829
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:23,500
还有电呢

830
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:23,984
I got a live one here.

831
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:34,374
本镇今晚有的瞧罗

832
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:35,656
There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight.

833
00:42:52,271 --> 00:42:55,927
东尼一定火冒三丈罗

834
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:56,111
Antoine got a little
hot under the collar.

835
00:42:56,712 --> 00:42:58,429
你疯了

836
00:42:57,622 --> 00:42:58,919
You're crazy.

837
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:05,205
你可曾听过一笑治百病
这句话？

838
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:05,018
Haven't you ever heard of the
healing power of laughter?

839
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,192
给我滚

840
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,371
-Now get out of here!
-Let's go! Move it!

841
00:43:13,196 --> 00:43:16,059
你们都听到了，快走

842
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:17,634
You think it over.

843
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:21,002
快走

844
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:33,565
巴勃

845
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,947
你去镜报跟踪诺克
带着照相机去

846
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:40,388
Go to the Globe, follow that
reporter Knox. Take your camera.

847
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:43,212
看他对蝙蝠侠知道多少

848
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:43,566
See what he knows
about this Batman.

849
00:43:43,985 --> 00:43:45,378
巴勃

850
00:43:44,836 --> 00:43:46,235
And, Bob...

851
00:43:48,761 --> 00:43:51,655
切记！你…

852
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:52,239
Remember...you...

853
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:56,096
你是我的左右手

854
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:56,069
...are my number one...

855
00:43:56,514 --> 00:43:58,004
...guy.

856
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,622
是的

857
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:00,907
Yes, sir.

858
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:19,546
我的朋友都不算坏人

859
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:17,528
Your pals...

860
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:20,030
...they're not bad people.

861
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:22,674
我们不妨…

862
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:22,933
Maybe we...

863
00:44:23,189 --> 00:44:27,168
给他们几天时间考虑一下

864
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:27,104
...ought to give them a
few days to think it over.

865
00:44:27,226 --> 00:44:29,088
不行？

866
00:44:27,879 --> 00:44:29,039
No?

867
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:36,166
现在就杀他们？

868
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:36,446
Grease them now?

869
00:44:38,372 --> 00:44:39,994
好吧

870
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,721
Okay.

871
00:44:42,104 --> 00:44:46,229
你是个大奸包，洛泰里

872
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:45,727
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.

873
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:48,804
你死了活该

874
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:49,463
I'm glad you're dead.

875
00:44:56,554 --> 00:44:58,448
你死了活该

876
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:58,739
I'm glad you're dead.

877
00:45:01,424 --> 00:45:04,455
你死了活该

878
00:45:01,646 --> 00:45:04,410
I'm glad you're dead.

879
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:12,056
我正需要

880
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:12,914
I need that.

881
00:45:13,436 --> 00:45:15,559
我快对你失去信心了

882
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:15,485
I'm losing confidence in you.

883
00:45:15,604 --> 00:45:17,643
我以为咱们是一伙的

884
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,218
I thought we were a team.

885
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,230
是你的私人问题吧？

886
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:20,153
Is this a personal issue for you?

887
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:22,471
我只要你尽到责任

888
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:22,331
I just want you to do your job.

889
00:45:22,516 --> 00:45:25,598
我是在尽责任
我也是，我在保护伙伴

890
00:45:22,667 --> 00:45:23,998
I am doing my job.

891
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:25,826
And I'm protecting my partner.

892
00:45:25,644 --> 00:45:28,549
档案中查不出任何照片
或资料

893
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:29,937
There's nothing in these files.
Who is this guy?

894
00:45:28,554 --> 00:45:31,240
他是什么人？
管他的

895
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:31,766
Who cares?

896
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,754
别管布鲁斯韦恩了
我要采访蝙蝠侠

897
00:45:33,844 --> 00:45:36,677
Forget Bruce Wayne.
I'm onto Batman.

898
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:32,427
他们马上就要出发
我等着听他们如何解释

899
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:31,884
They'll be out any second.
I can't wait to hear the explanation.

900
00:47:36,508 --> 00:47:37,766
他来了

901
00:47:39,835 --> 00:47:41,729
你公证什么文件？

902
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:42,234
What is this affidavit you filed?

903
00:47:41,773 --> 00:47:43,802
格里森把所有事业都
交给你了？

904
00:47:42,473 --> 00:47:44,304
Grissom gave you his business?

905
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:49,339
格里森先生以私情委托我
接管他的事业

906
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:47,643
Mr. Grissom asked me,
as a personal favor...

907
00:47:47,978 --> 00:47:51,141
...to take over all his
businesses until he returns.

908
00:47:49,343 --> 00:47:50,830
直到他回来为止

909
00:47:50,886 --> 00:47:54,656
这倒是个大人情
你俩关系八成不错

910
00:47:51,816 --> 00:47:55,809
That's a big favor. You two
must have been very close.

911
00:47:54,681 --> 00:47:57,878
很不错
小时候一起吃过牢饭？

912
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:58,419
Did you do time together as children?

913
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:44,298
我方的会计会查阅的
委任书是合法的

914
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:44,296
Our accountants are looking into it.
The affidavit is legitimate.

915
00:48:50,817 --> 00:48:53,378
我闻到墨水味
你能证明吗？

916
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:53,866
I smell fresh ink. You can prove this?

917
00:48:53,383 --> 00:48:55,308
我胡扯些什么？
他当然能了

918
00:48:54,145 --> 00:48:55,806
Of course you can.

919
00:48:55,342 --> 00:48:58,779
我们有证人
格里森的签名完全合法

920
00:48:56,046 --> 00:48:59,038
We have witnesses. Grissom's
signature is legitimate.

921
00:48:58,785 --> 00:49:00,512
是合法的

922
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:00,715
It is legitimate.

923
00:49:00,847 --> 00:49:01,979
我看见了

924
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:03,980
I saw it. I was there.

925
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:03,608
我在场

926
00:49:03,654 --> 00:49:05,620
全部看见了

927
00:49:04,555 --> 00:49:06,147
I saw it all.

928
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:09,884
他伸出死手
用鲜血签的

929
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:08,984
He reached up with his dead hand...

930
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:11,726
...and signed it in his own blood.

931
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:14,514
他用这支笔写的

932
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:15,054
And he did it...with this pen.

933
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,559
哈罗，文尼
我是你宾果叔叔呀

934
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,995
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.

935
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:21,364
该还债了

936
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:22,098
Time to pay the check.

937
00:49:27,739 --> 00:49:29,039
笔

938
00:49:28,412 --> 00:49:29,743
The pen...

939
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:31,812
的确比剑有力

940
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:32,511
...is truly mightier than the sword.

941
00:49:41,918 --> 00:49:43,071
趴下

942
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:50,022
Get down!

943
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:13,047
帮派火拼会影响周年纪念
活动吗？

944
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:13,784
Won't this gang war dampen
the city's 200th anniversary?

945
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:16,885
活动照常举行
警方会阻止那些歹徒

946
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:17,892
The festival opens. The police
will stop these gangsters.

947
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,875
丹特先生

948
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:22,826
你对蝙蝠侠是黑社会组织
的说法有何意见？

949
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:23,122
What about the theory that
the Batman is a mob enforcer?

950
00:50:22,864 --> 00:50:23,882
恕不奉告

951
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,061
I don't have any comment.

952
00:50:29,903 --> 00:50:31,056
蝙蝠侠

953
00:50:30,808 --> 00:50:32,139
Batman.

954
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,766
蝙蝠侠

955
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:34,633
Batman.

956
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:40,970
人穿蝙蝠装，这成了什么
世界呀？

957
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:39,582
Can somebody tell me what
kind of a world we live in...

958
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:42,809
...when a man dressed as a bat...

959
00:50:42,048 --> 00:50:44,473
抢尽我的风头

960
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:45,146
...gets all my press?

961
00:50:46,615 --> 00:50:49,448
本市需要通个便

962
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,582
This town needs an enema!

963
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:55,682
阿福

964
00:50:56,426 --> 00:50:57,579
给我杯水好吗？

965
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:59,158
May I have a glass of...water?

966
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:02,459
你回来令我很安慰

967
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:02,996
I'm relieved that you're home.

968
00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:06,620
瓦尔小姐来电话
她很关心呢

969
00:51:03,274 --> 00:51:07,267
Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.

970
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:10,729
她来过之后
好像安心多了

971
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:11,103
I feel there's a certain weight
that lifts when she is here.

972
00:51:11,076 --> 00:51:12,834
阿福…

973
00:51:12,283 --> 00:51:13,341
Alfred...

974
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:15,628
你干脆娶她算了

975
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:15,779
...why don't you marry her?

976
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:19,110
我没有这个打算

977
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:19,616
That's not exactly what
I had in mind, sir.

978
00:51:21,951 --> 00:51:23,678
不要

979
00:51:25,025 --> 00:51:28,138
我此刻无法思考这件事

980
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,964
I can't go over that right now.

981
00:51:28,197 --> 00:51:30,550
现在不想…

982
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:30,293
If not now...

983
00:51:32,023 --> 00:51:33,583
几时？

984
00:51:33,037 --> 00:51:34,026
...when?

985
00:51:36,392 --> 00:51:38,088
不知道

986
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,035
I don't know.

987
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:46,105
我听说杰克纳皮尔还活着

988
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,541
Jack Napier's still alive.

989
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:52,599
接管了格里森的事业
我需要一切警方的资料

990
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:52,648
He's running Grissom's men.
I need any information on him.

991
00:51:52,688 --> 00:51:53,769
是的

992
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:55,812
谢谢你

993
00:52:01,154 --> 00:52:02,641
阿福

994
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:06,217
她很棒对吧？

995
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:06,730
She is great, isn't she?

996
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,552
对

997
00:52:07,504 --> 00:52:08,562
Yes.

998
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:20,971
市政府，诺克
嗨

999
00:52:20,184 --> 00:52:21,173
Knox.

1000
00:52:20,975 --> 00:52:23,766
帮我查点资料好吗？
说吧

1001
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:23,847
Check something out for me.

1002
00:52:23,812 --> 00:52:27,645
查一下珍珠和菲力浦街
有什么不寻常的

1003
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:27,847
Find out what's special about
the alley at Pearl and Phillips.

1004
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:29,781
珍珠和菲力浦？
对

1005
00:52:28,092 --> 00:52:29,753
Pearl and Phillips?

1006
00:52:29,787 --> 00:52:31,149
没问题
好

1007
00:52:30,194 --> 00:52:31,252
You got it.

1008
00:52:31,183 --> 00:52:32,483
再见了

1009
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:42,054
韦恩先生

1010
00:52:41,372 --> 00:52:42,703
Mister Wayne.

1011
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:08,787
事情这么多
时间不够用的

1012
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:09,228
So much to do and so little time.

1013
00:53:08,822 --> 00:53:09,944
照片

1014
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:11,058
The photos.

1015
00:53:12,493 --> 00:53:15,284
那个废物是谁？
诺克

1016
00:53:13,404 --> 00:53:15,133
Who's that loss?

1017
00:53:15,406 --> 00:53:16,395
Knox.

1018
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,618
丑领带，没格调

1019
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,972
Bad tie. No style.

1020
00:53:21,627 --> 00:53:25,126
一切暂停，她是啥么人？
维琪瓦尔

1021
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,740
Stop the press!

1022
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:25,972
-Who is that?
-Vicki Vale.

1023
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:27,754
和诺克一起的摄影师

1024
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,241
The photographer
working with Knox.

1025
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,859
这姑娘有味道

1026
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:30,749
That girl has style.

1027
00:53:29,905 --> 00:53:31,809
乖乖隆地咚

1028
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:32,749
Jesus marimba!

1029
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:37,667
这么迷人的娘们
哪个男人见了不来劲的？

1030
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,752
A lovely beast like
that running around...

1031
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:38,484
...could put steam in a man's strides.

1032
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,682
她和一个叫韦恩的人一起

1033
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:40,992
She's dating some guy named Wayne.

1034
00:53:40,686 --> 00:53:42,643
她快要升级了

1035
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:43,096
She's about to trade up.

1036
00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:46,011
很难剪得齐

1037
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:46,828
It's hard to stay inside the lines.

1038
00:53:50,153 --> 00:53:55,111
我就要有…
新女人了，巴勃

1039
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:52,507
I'm about...

1040
00:53:54,178 --> 00:53:56,169
...to get a new girl.

1041
00:53:56,827 --> 00:54:00,128
我此时哈的要死

1042
00:53:57,781 --> 00:54:00,443
I'm of a mind to make some mooky.

1043
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:01,839
电话簿

1044
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:02,316
Phone book.

1045
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,194
遵命

1046
00:54:06,136 --> 00:54:08,969
事情这么多

1047
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:09,118
So much to do...

1048
00:54:09,004 --> 00:54:11,972
时间总觉不够

1049
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:11,790
...and so little time.

1050
00:54:19,088 --> 00:54:23,244
（艾克斯化学公司）

1051
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:39,029
你运出一百万桶了吗？

1052
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:39,380
Have you shipped a million of those?

1053
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:39,967
是的

1054
00:54:40,002 --> 00:54:44,699
全运出去
咱们要改变整个规模

1055
00:54:40,724 --> 00:54:45,218
Ship them all! We're going to
take them out a whole new door!

1056
00:54:47,113 --> 00:54:48,840
再十秒钟

1057
00:54:48,665 --> 00:54:50,292
Ten seconds to transmission.

1058
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:55,064
Five, four...

1059
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,080
音乐

1060
00:54:59,243 --> 00:55:00,835
Cue music.

1061
00:55:03,514 --> 00:55:05,004
Cue Becky.

1062
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:10,621
晚安，当今的流行界

1063
00:55:08,252 --> 00:55:11,585
Good evening. The fashion
world was stunned today...

1064
00:55:10,678 --> 00:55:15,230
因模特儿甘蒂华克和
艾曼达吉勒之死而震惊

1065
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:15,586
...by the sudden deaths of models
Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.

1066
00:55:15,276 --> 00:55:19,265
据说死因是因强烈的敏感
而引起的

1067
00:55:16,026 --> 00:55:20,019
Cause of death has been attributed
to a violent allergic reaction...

1068
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:24,038
当局却不排除服毒致死的
可能性

1069
00:55:20,264 --> 00:55:24,928
...although authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of drug use.

1070
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:25,176
彼得

1071
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:30,410
市长今天在揭幕式中宣布
周年活动按计划举行

1072
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:28,936
Plans continue for the
city's 200th birthday...

1073
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:32,107
...as Mayor Borg announced
today at the unveiling--

1074
00:55:31,718 --> 00:55:33,873
这是刚送来的

1075
00:55:32,709 --> 00:55:34,267
This just in.

1076
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:39,179
一家美容院一连发生三起
神秘死亡事件…

1077
00:55:35,279 --> 00:55:38,112
Three mysterious deaths
at a beauty parlor--

1078
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:45,259
高谭市一家美容院
今天发现…

1079
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:44,748
--were discovered today.

1080
00:55:45,898 --> 00:55:48,428
到底是怎么搞的？

1081
00:55:47,057 --> 00:55:48,456
What's going on?

1082
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,065
贝琪，这种行为太…

1083
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:51,387
This is hardly the--

1084
00:55:52,342 --> 00:55:53,891
贝琪

1085
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:58,030
摄影机关掉
我是蕾妮，在新闻摄影棚

1086
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:56,130
Kill the camera.

1087
00:55:56,633 --> 00:56:00,899
This is Rene on the news floor.
I need paramedics up here now!

1088
00:55:58,077 --> 00:56:00,409
我需要一些镇静剂

1089
00:56:05,354 --> 00:56:08,259
新上市丑客产品

1090
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:09,243
New and improved Joker products!

1091

内含秘密成份

1092
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:11,413
With a new secret ingredient.

「含笑素」

1094

Smylex!

1095
00:56:12,935 --> 00:56:14,829
怎么回事？

1096
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,981
What's that?

1097
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:17,584
Let's go over...

1098
00:56:15,363 --> 00:56:17,225
我们再继续…

1099
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,760
无偏见的口味

1100
00:56:18,322 --> 00:56:20,654
...to our blind taste test.

1101
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:22,156
我爱那个丑客

1102
00:56:20,824 --> 00:56:22,485
Love that Joker.

1103
00:56:22,205 --> 00:56:24,922
从哪来的？
不知道

1104
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:25,091
-Where's it coming from?
-I don't know.

1105
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:27,901
他不太快乐

1106
00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:31,491
He don't look happy.
He's been using brand X.

1107
00:56:27,938 --> 00:56:30,927
他使用的是X牌的

1108
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:35,109
有了丑客牌之后

1109
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:35,997
But with new Joker Brand...

1110
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:40,342
我脸上再度展露笑容
永不消失

1111
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,433
...l get a grin again...

1112
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:40,265
...and again.

1113
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:44,887
还有美丽的古铜色
宝红双唇

1114
00:56:41,778 --> 00:56:43,609
That luscious tan...

1115
00:56:44,114 --> 00:56:45,775
...those ruby lips...

1116
00:56:44,922 --> 00:56:50,912
还有自然的发色
只有殡仪馆的人才知道

1117
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:50,612
...and hair color so natural, only
your undertaker knows for sure.

1118
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:53,063
我懂你说些什么

1119
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:53,622
You're saying:

1120
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:57,931
我到哪去买这么好的货品

1121
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:57,122
"Where can I get these fine,
new items?"

1122
00:56:57,361 --> 00:57:01,798
That's the gag. Chances are,
you bought them already!

1123
00:56:57,966 --> 00:56:59,704
妙处就在这

1124
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,934
其实你已经买过了

1125
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:03,906
我爱丑客

1126
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,528
Love that Joker.

1127
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,731
别忘了

1128
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:06,199
Remember...

1129
00:57:05,776 --> 00:57:09,098
随时保持笑容

1130
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:09,462
...put on a happy face.

1131
00:57:12,845 --> 00:57:15,280
你要的资料，先生

00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:57,989
（化妆品带来恐慌）

1148
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,825
又有六人死亡

1149
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:05,025
...six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

1150
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:05,485
然而丑客的致命武器
仍无线索

1151
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:08,134
下毒的货品有哪些？

1152
00:58:06,263 --> 00:58:08,254
And what is the pattern?

1153
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:11,854
食物、酒精
美容及卫生产品

1154
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:12,601
Foods, alcohol, or beauty
and hygiene products?

1155
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:16,100
古龙水、漱口水
腋下除臭剂

1156
00:58:12,936 --> 00:58:16,599
Cologne, mouthwash,
underarm deodorant?

1157
00:58:16,145 --> 00:58:19,873
最糟的是
找不出固定的模式来

1158
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,773
Or worse yet,
there may be no pattern.

1159
00:58:19,908 --> 00:58:24,012
警方继续搜索高谭市
各个购物中心

1160
00:58:20,444 --> 00:58:24,107
The search goes on through
Gotham's shopping nightmare.

1161
00:58:24,049 --> 00:58:25,985
活动照计划举行

1162
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:29,616
We are having a festival if I have to
use a gun to get people there myself.

1163
00:58:25,987 --> 00:58:28,976
即使要我用猎枪
也在所不惜

1164
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:32,479
你听清楚了吗？
活动照常举行

1165
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:33,788
Do you hear the words coming from
my mouth? The festival is on!

1166
00:58:33,223 --> 00:58:38,390
你马上去查出那个疯子
用的是什么毒药，懂了吗

1167
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:37,049
Find out what this madman
is poisoning us with.

1168
00:58:37,294 --> 00:58:38,727
Do you read me?

1169
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:43,427
我们正在研究
我需要各方面的支援

1170
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:43,460
We're working on it.
I need all the help I can get.

1171
00:58:46,539 --> 00:58:49,298
布鲁斯，嗨，我是维琪

1172
00:58:47,637 --> 00:58:49,798
Hi, it's Vicki.

1173
00:58:49,342 --> 00:58:52,497
抱歉，我可能晚十分钟
才能到博物馆

1174
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:52,633
I'll be ten minutes late to the museum.

1175
00:58:52,544 --> 00:58:55,032
见面再谈，再见

1176
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:54,638
I'll see you when you get there.

1177
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:03,341
先生，是瓦尔小姐的口信

1178
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:03,483
A message from Miss Vale.

1179
00:59:03,387 --> 00:59:06,146
她会迟到十分钟

1180
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,482
She'll be late meeting
you at the museum.

1181
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:07,584
好的，谢谢你

1182
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,752
Okay, thank you.
Wait a minute, Alfred.

1183
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:11,256
等一下，阿福
我今天没有约她

1184
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:11,988
I'm not meeting her today.

1185
00:59:22,467 --> 00:59:26,332
杰克，你去哪呀？

1186
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,840
Jack, where are you going?

1187
00:59:27,346 --> 00:59:31,169
爹地要去创作艺术

1188
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:30,940
Daddy's going to make
some art, darling.

1189
01:00:04,872 --> 01:00:05,962
对不起

1190
01:00:05,649 --> 01:00:07,640
Mr. Wayne's table?

1191
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,310
韦恩先生的桌位

1192
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:10,475
He hasn't arrived yet.

1193
01:00:08,344 --> 01:00:10,040
他还没到

1194
01:00:10,085 --> 01:00:12,343
桌子已摆好了

1195
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:12,548
We have a table waiting.

1196
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,486
好的

1197
01:00:37,204 --> 01:00:41,162
瓦尔小姐，这是刚送到的

1198
01:00:38,081 --> 01:00:40,572
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.

1199
01:00:57,067 --> 01:00:59,294
（马上戴上去）

1200
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:44,371
各位

1201
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:44,975
Gentlemen!

1202
01:01:44,508 --> 01:01:48,404
我们来扩展一下见识
劳伦斯

1203
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:48,315
Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.

1204
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:10,488
刮个胡子

1205
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:11,100
Give him a shave.

1206
01:02:12,003 --> 01:02:14,293
泰伦斯，画笔

1207
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:14,607
Terence, brush.

1208
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:21,705
丑客在此

1209
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,543
一元钞票

1210
01:03:08,498 --> 01:03:10,159
The one-dollar bill.

1211
01:03:12,851 --> 01:03:14,255
等一下

1212
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:15,393
Hold it!

1213
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:18,584
我蛮喜欢这一幅的
别戳破

1214
01:03:16,172 --> 01:03:19,335
I kind of like this one. Leave it.

1215
01:03:32,777 --> 01:03:35,745
可以脱下来了

1216
01:03:33,757 --> 01:03:35,691
You can take that off now.

1217
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:39,299
你很漂亮

1218
01:03:38,762 --> 01:03:42,357
You're beautiful...
in an old-fashioned kind of way.

1219
01:03:39,346 --> 01:03:42,356
很有古典美

1220
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:45,712
我有办法让你更现代化

1221
01:03:42,599 --> 01:03:46,194
But I'm sure we can make you more...
today.

1222
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:51,686
是你的手提箱吗？

1223
01:03:49,773 --> 01:03:51,206
Your portfolio?

1224
01:03:51,722 --> 01:03:55,722
我约了人来看我作品的

1225
01:03:52,776 --> 01:03:55,711
I'm meeting someone who
wants to see my work.

1226
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,122
废物

1227
01:03:58,381 --> 01:03:59,370
Crap.

1228
01:03:58,636 --> 01:03:59,560
废物

1229
01:03:59,783 --> 01:04:01,614
Crap. Crap.

1230
01:04:00,198 --> 01:04:01,216
废物

1231
01:04:01,731 --> 01:04:02,655
废物

1232
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:04,549
Crap. Crap.

1233
01:04:02,878 --> 01:04:04,730
废物…

1234
01:04:07,102 --> 01:04:09,100
这是好作品

1235
01:04:08,058 --> 01:04:09,889
Now that's good work.

1236
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,332
骷髅，尸体

1237
01:04:13,296 --> 01:04:14,957
The skulls, the bodies.

1238
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:19,801
You give it such a glow. I don't
know if it's art, but I like it.

1239
01:04:15,455 --> 01:04:20,820
被你一拍就很惹眼
艺术我虽不懂，我很喜欢

1240
01:04:21,355 --> 01:04:23,874
让我告诉你我的想法吧

1241
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:24,633
Let me tell you
what I'm thinking about.

1242
01:04:23,919 --> 01:04:26,188
我有一天正在洗澡

1243
01:04:24,908 --> 01:04:26,739
I was in the bath one day...

1244
01:04:26,223 --> 01:04:30,317
突然发觉
自己天生就是个伟人

1245
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:30,742
...when I realized why I
was destined for greatness.

1246
01:04:30,362 --> 01:04:35,497
你知道一般人多注重外表
这个人迷人

1247
01:04:31,414 --> 01:04:34,474
You know how concerned people
are about appearances.

1248
01:04:34,918 --> 01:04:37,409
This is attractive, that is not.

1249
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:39,295
这个人很丑
那一切都过去了

1250
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:41,986
That is all behind me. I now do
what other people only dream.

1251
01:04:39,339 --> 01:04:42,130
我现在的一切是别人
梦想不到的

1252
01:04:42,176 --> 01:04:44,830
我创作艺术
直到有人死为止

1253
01:04:42,592 --> 01:04:45,254
I make art...until someone dies.

1254
01:04:44,877 --> 01:04:46,239
懂吧？

1255
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:46,754
See?

1256
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:52,640
我是世界第一个全自动化
自杀艺术家

1257
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:52,597
I am the world's first
fully-functioning homicidal artist.

1258
01:04:53,854 --> 01:04:56,175
你想干什么？

1259
01:04:55,004 --> 01:04:56,164
What do you want?

1260
01:04:56,951 --> 01:05:00,690
我的照片印在一元钞票上

1261
01:04:58,108 --> 01:05:00,008
My face on the one-dollar bill.

1262
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,379
笑话

1263
01:05:02,445 --> 01:05:03,844
You're joking.

1264
01:05:03,957 --> 01:05:06,331
我的表情像吗？

1265
01:05:05,014 --> 01:05:06,777
Do I look like I'm joking?

1266
01:05:06,355 --> 01:05:07,957
不像

1267
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:08,606
No.

1268
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:10,178
Listen.

1269
01:05:09,257 --> 01:05:10,744
听我说

1270
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:15,181
We mustn't compare ourselves with
regular people. We're artists.

1271
01:05:10,788 --> 01:05:13,880
我们不能和平凡人去比

1272
01:05:13,886 --> 01:05:15,582
我们是艺术家

1273
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:18,858
For instance, let me challenge
you with a piece I did.

1274
01:05:15,627 --> 01:05:18,917
比方说
我拿一幅作品跟你挑战

1275
01:05:18,923 --> 01:05:20,389
巴勃

1276
01:05:19,129 --> 01:05:21,290
Bob. Alicia.

1277
01:05:20,423 --> 01:05:21,983
爱莉雪

1278
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:24,996
你用照片纪录我的作品

1279
01:05:22,132 --> 01:05:24,623
You will photograph
and record my work.

1280
01:05:24,868 --> 01:05:29,202
You will join me in the
avant-garde of the new aesthetic.

1281
01:05:25,032 --> 01:05:28,594
跟我加入前卫艺术之列

1282
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:30,763
杰克

1283
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:33,973
Jack, you said I could watch
you improve the paintings.

1284
01:05:30,808 --> 01:05:34,068
你说我可以看你修改画的

1285
01:05:34,477 --> 01:05:36,809
I'm in trouble now.

1286
01:05:34,603 --> 01:05:36,444
出了点问题

1287
01:05:37,547 --> 01:05:39,538
Why is she wearing a mask?

1288
01:05:37,742 --> 01:05:40,636
她干嘛戴面具？

1289
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:42,144
She's just a sketch, really.

1290
01:05:40,682 --> 01:05:42,784
其实只是张草图

1291
01:05:42,385 --> 01:05:46,048
Alicia, sit down. Show the
lady why you wear this mask.

1292
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:44,474
爱莉雪坐下

1293
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:46,914
告诉她你为何戴面具

1294
01:05:46,322 --> 01:05:50,224
Alicia's been made over in
line with my new philosophy.

1295
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:50,947
你知道，瓦尔小姐
她和我有共同的人生哲学

1296
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:52,051
So now, like me...

1297
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:55,076
所以她和我一样
是幅活动艺术品

1298
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:54,659
...she is a living work of art.

1299
01:05:59,032 --> 01:06:02,990
我，不是毕卡索
不过你会喜欢的

1300
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:01,559
I'm no Picasso, but...do you like it?

1301
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:04,334
It's great.

1302
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:04,825
太棒了

1303
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:08,170
So...what can I do for you?

1304
01:06:06,447 --> 01:06:09,529
要我帮什么忙？

1305
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,571
A little song, a little dance.

1306
01:06:09,575 --> 01:06:12,063
唱首歌、跳支舞

1307
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:13,907
Batman's head on a lance.

1308
01:06:12,117 --> 01:06:14,939
蝙蝠侠的头吊在绳子上

1309
01:06:14,184 --> 01:06:16,243
What do you know about...?

1310
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:17,077
告诉我…你知道多少…

1311
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,419
I don't know anything.

1312
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:19,479
我对他一无所知

1313
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:21,586
真的吗？

1314
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:21,687
Really?

1315
01:06:21,628 --> 01:06:26,185
咱俩热呼一下如何？

1316
01:06:22,258 --> 01:06:24,590
Well, how about
a little "you and me"?

1317
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,595
你疯了

1318
01:06:27,263 --> 01:06:28,252
You're insane.

1319
01:06:28,637 --> 01:06:33,831
我以为我是双鱼宫的
来吧，咱们交合一下

1320
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:30,858
I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.

1321
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,762
Let's make up. Have a little...

1322
01:06:33,862 --> 01:06:36,271
闻闻我的小牡丹

1323
01:06:34,037 --> 01:06:35,868
...whiff of my posy.

1324
01:06:41,382 --> 01:06:43,947
救命呀

1325
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:43,110
Help me!

1326
01:06:43,948 --> 01:06:46,180
我快要溶化了

1327
01:06:44,047 --> 01:06:45,446
I'm melting!

1328
01:06:46,216 --> 01:06:48,946
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!

1329
01:06:46,493 --> 01:06:49,277
我快要溶化了…

1330
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:13,590
抱紧

1331
01:07:12,742 --> 01:07:14,073
Hold on.

1332
01:07:23,228 --> 01:07:25,960
他哪来的玩意？

1333
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:26,245
Where does he get
those wonderful toys?

1334
01:07:28,714 --> 01:07:30,017
上车

1335
01:07:29,158 --> 01:07:30,921
-Get in the car.
-Which one?

1336
01:07:30,018 --> 01:07:31,446
哪一辆？

1337
01:08:56,222 --> 01:08:57,212
快走

1338
01:08:56,646 --> 01:08:57,635
Let's go.

1339
01:09:12,545 --> 01:09:13,702
盾甲

1340
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:13,818
Shields.

1341
01:09:38,735 --> 01:09:40,497
你多重

1342
01:09:39,188 --> 01:09:40,678
How much do you weigh?

1343
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:42,844
108磅吧

1344
01:09:41,024 --> 01:09:42,685
About 108, I think.

1345
01:09:51,418 --> 01:09:52,888
抓稳

1346
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:53,029
Hold on.

1347
01:10:03,339 --> 01:10:06,144
抓住我腰带上的东西

1348
01:10:03,713 --> 01:10:05,704
Grab that thing on my belt.

1349
01:10:06,145 --> 01:10:07,605
别放手

1350
01:10:06,149 --> 01:10:07,138
Don't let go.

1351
01:10:21,832 --> 01:10:23,260
没有血

1352
01:10:22,165 --> 01:10:23,154
No blood.

1353
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,128
那家伙是谁？

1354
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:24,889
Who is this guy?

1355
01:10:25,068 --> 01:10:26,228
Check his wallet.

1356
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:26,932
查一下皮夹

1357
01:10:27,329 --> 01:10:28,799
等等

1358
01:10:27,837 --> 01:10:30,397
-Wait.
-What is that?

1359
01:10:29,248 --> 01:10:30,468
那是什么？

1360
01:10:30,499 --> 01:10:34,347
是胄甲，他终究还是个人

1361
01:10:30,673 --> 01:10:34,234
Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.

1362
01:10:34,348 --> 01:10:36,507
面具脱掉

1363
01:10:34,577 --> 01:10:35,839
Take off the mask.

1364
01:10:41,659 --> 01:10:42,712
开枪

1365
01:10:42,185 --> 01:10:43,243
Shoot her!

1366
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:47,701
盾甲开

1367
01:11:46,249 --> 01:11:47,477
Shields open.

1368
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:14,402
你不只108磅

1369
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:14,271
You weigh more than 108.

1370
01:12:14,403 --> 01:12:20,410
真的
快走

1371
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:16,535
-Really?
-Let's go.

1372
01:12:20,411 --> 01:12:21,641
停

1373
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:22,114
Stop.

1374
01:12:50,585 --> 01:12:52,524
我们去哪？

1375
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:52,538
Where are we going?

1376
01:14:11,825 --> 01:14:13,118
小心点

1377
01:14:12,128 --> 01:14:13,561
Be careful.

1378
01:14:22,471 --> 01:14:23,631
Bats.

1379
01:14:24,914 --> 01:14:27,135
生存能力很强

1380
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:26,799
They're great survivors.

1381
01:14:51,907 --> 01:14:53,669
这是什么玩意？

1382
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:55,169
-What is all this?
-The police have got it wrong.

1383
01:14:53,712 --> 01:14:55,818
警方搞错了

1384
01:14:55,819 --> 01:15:01,618
他们以为只有一种产品
丑客在上百种货品中下毒

1385
01:14:55,838 --> 01:14:57,931
They're looking for one product.

1386
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:01,337
The Joker's tainted hundreds
of chemicals at the source.

1387
01:15:03,224 --> 01:15:06,488
整批货都会有毒

1388
01:15:03,512 --> 01:15:06,174
Then whole shipments
would be poisoned.

1389
01:15:06,449 --> 01:15:08,110
And we'd all be dead.

1390
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:08,647
我们都会死

1391
01:15:08,835 --> 01:15:10,628
不会

1392
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:10,608
No.

1393
01:15:10,702 --> 01:15:13,226
成份混合后
毒药才会生效

1394
01:15:10,853 --> 01:15:15,517
The poison works when components
are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.

1395
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:16,147
喷发水单独不起作用

1396
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:20,285
But hairspray mixed with lipstick and
perfume will be toxic, and traceable.

1397
01:15:16,147 --> 01:15:20,736
但若和香水、唇膏混合
就会有毒了

1398
01:15:20,778 --> 01:15:23,051
你怎么知道的？

1399
01:15:20,963 --> 01:15:23,124
How did you figure this out?

1400
01:15:28,819 --> 01:15:31,520
这个拿去报社

1401
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:30,628
Take that to the press.

1402
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:34,691
这么做有点困难

1403
01:15:31,874 --> 01:15:33,967
I might have trouble with that.

1404
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:39,061
很多人认为
你和丑客一样危险

1405
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:38,207
A lot of people think you're
as dangerous as the Joker.

1406
01:15:39,176 --> 01:15:41,898
他是丧心病狂

1407
01:15:39,548 --> 01:15:41,209
He's psychotic.

1408
01:15:42,045 --> 01:15:45,705
也有人这么说你

1409
01:15:42,318 --> 01:15:45,048
Some people say the
same thing about you.

1410
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,906
什么人？

1411
01:15:46,222 --> 01:15:47,382
What people?

1412
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:50,816
面对现实吧

1413
01:15:48,391 --> 01:15:50,552
Well, let's face it.

1414
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:55,144
你并非正常人对吧？

1415
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:55,157
You're not exactly normal...are you?

1416
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,357
这也不算个正常世界

1417
01:15:55,898 --> 01:15:57,889
It's not exactly a normal world.

1418
01:15:58,234 --> 01:15:59,997
Why did you bring me here?

1419
01:15:58,555 --> 01:16:00,359
为何带我来此？

1420
01:16:00,336 --> 01:16:03,669
You could have sent that
stuff to the press yourself.

1421
01:16:00,568 --> 01:16:04,155
你大可自己送去报社的

1422
01:16:04,198 --> 01:16:06,190
说的对

1423
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:05,500
You're right.

1424
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,840
你拥有我要的东西

1425
01:16:07,009 --> 01:16:09,409
There is something
you have that I want.

1426
01:16:09,882 --> 01:16:11,144
什么？

1427
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:11,004
What?

1428
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:35,033
He took the film.

1429
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:36,134
他把底片拿走了

1430
01:16:40,182 --> 01:16:42,914
你去哪了？还好吧？

1431
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:44,042
Where have you been? Are
you okay? Should I come over?

1432
01:16:42,946 --> 01:16:44,354
要我过去吗？

1433
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,373
No, Allie.

1434
01:16:44,385 --> 01:16:47,075
不要了，亚历山大

1435
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:50,450
If I bring something to you,
can we make the evening edition?

1436
01:16:47,389 --> 01:16:52,051
如果我现在送新闻来
赶得上晚间版吗？

1437
01:16:52,093 --> 01:16:54,398
还来得及，好炒吗？

1438
01:16:52,121 --> 01:16:53,782
Just barely. Is it hot?

1439
01:16:54,429 --> 01:16:57,265
对，保证大炒

1440
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,122
Yeah, it's real hot.

1441
01:16:58,977 --> 01:17:11,920
校对
是的

1442
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:00,284
Copy!

1443
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,944
避免下列的合用情形

1444
01:17:12,308 --> 01:17:14,640
Avoid the following combinations:

1445
01:17:14,877 --> 01:17:18,369
Deodorants with baby powder,
hairspray, and lipstick.

1446
01:17:14,987 --> 01:17:19,232
除臭剂不兴婴儿粉
喷发水和唇膏并用

1447
01:17:19,048 --> 01:17:23,212
Safe products are flying in as
Gotham City goes on a forced fast.

1448
01:17:19,232 --> 01:17:23,132
安全产品在高谭市上空
大量空投

1449
01:17:23,174 --> 01:17:27,116
市民对这位蝙蝠侠
不知如何看待

1450
01:17:23,486 --> 01:17:26,649
And all of Gotham is wondering
what to make of Batman.

1451
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:28,550
Friend or foe?

1452
01:17:27,138 --> 01:17:29,662
是友还是敌？

1453
01:17:29,714 --> 01:17:34,115
我眼中长出一根刺
刺名蝙蝠侠

1454
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,491
I have given a name to my pain...

1455
01:17:33,662 --> 01:17:35,653
...and it is Batman.

1456
01:17:40,259 --> 01:17:44,024
要对抗痛苦首需力量

1457
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:44,002
You must possess strength
to inflict pain, Bob.

1458
01:17:44,024 --> 01:17:47,132
有只飞鼠待宰

1459
01:17:44,406 --> 01:17:46,897
We've got a flying mouse to kill...

1460
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:50,302
我要磨爪以待

1461
01:17:47,176 --> 01:17:49,838
...and I want to clean my claws.

1462
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,412
Sir, Miss Vale called again.

1463
01:17:54,913 --> 01:17:57,812
瓦尔小姐又来电了

1464
01:17:57,812 --> 01:18:02,380
你目前的行为
只会强化她的决心

1465
01:17:57,853 --> 01:18:00,913
Dare I suggest that your
present course of action...

1466
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:03,249
...might simply
strengthen her resolve?

1467
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:05,217
她很机巧

1468
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:06,020
She is quite tenacious.

1469
01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:08,023
说的对

1470
01:18:06,862 --> 01:18:08,022
You're right.

1471
01:18:08,024 --> 01:18:10,495
恕我直言，也很特别

1472
01:18:08,264 --> 01:18:12,758
And quite special. Perhaps you
could try telling her the truth.

1473
01:18:10,537 --> 01:18:13,895
不妨考虑对她说实话

1474
01:18:23,043 --> 01:18:24,451
来了

1475
01:18:23,379 --> 01:18:24,710
Coming.

1476
01:18:30,187 --> 01:18:31,449
嗨

1477
01:18:38,406 --> 01:18:40,523
可以进去吗？

1478
01:18:38,794 --> 01:18:39,624
May I come in?

1479
01:18:49,546 --> 01:18:52,174
好漂亮的房子

1480
01:18:49,972 --> 01:18:51,633
This is a nice apartment.

1481
01:18:53,384 --> 01:18:55,876
空间也好大

1482
01:18:53,809 --> 01:18:55,299
Lots of space.

1483
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:02,050
我是来…

1484
01:19:00,749 --> 01:19:02,580
Listen, I came over to...

1485
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:06,025
澄清几件事的
你自以为是什么

1486
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:05,749
-...clear--
-I don't know who you think you are!

1487
01:19:05,988 --> 01:19:07,649
-You hurt me.
-I know.

1488
01:19:06,067 --> 01:19:07,558
你伤了我
我知道

1489
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,238
我不断打电话给你
我知道

1490
01:19:07,923 --> 01:19:12,587
I called you and called you. And you
lied! You lied about leaving town.

1491
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:13,002
你却一直骗我
骗我说要出城

1492
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:15,093
-Let me tell you why.
-Let me tell you!

1493
01:19:13,044 --> 01:19:15,484
我告诉你原因吧
我告诉你好了

1494
01:19:15,331 --> 01:19:18,823
I thought we felt something.
And I trusted you.

1495
01:19:15,516 --> 01:19:18,311
你邀我吃饭
我以为彼此很投缘

1496
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:21,116
我相信你，跟你睡觉
我不信自己这么做

1497
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:20,762
I even slept with you.

1498
01:19:20,936 --> 01:19:24,599
Then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of jerk.

1499
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:23,850
你却连个电话也不回
你八成是个…

1500
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,112
变态

1501
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:27,928
你是个好女孩
我好喜欢你

1502
01:19:25,674 --> 01:19:29,667
You're a real nice girl and I like
you a lot, but right now, shut up.

1503
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:30,295
不过你先闭嘴

1504
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:32,830
我有话要说

1505
01:19:31,013 --> 01:19:32,844
I have something to tell you.

1506
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:45,377
你知道人的性格是多变的

1507
01:19:41,123 --> 01:19:45,457
You know how people have...
different sides to their personality?

1508
01:19:46,921 --> 01:19:48,944
有时候…

1509
01:19:47,296 --> 01:19:48,786
Sometimes...

1510
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:53,658
不得不过另一种生活

1511
01:19:49,632 --> 01:19:53,625
...a person will have to actually
lead a different life.

1512
01:19:54,034 --> 01:19:56,526
我的天，你结婚了

1513
01:19:54,203 --> 01:19:55,864
Oh, my God, you're married.

1514
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:58,369
No, I'm not married.

1515
01:19:56,569 --> 01:19:58,435
我没结婚

1516
01:20:05,445 --> 01:20:07,176
其实…

1517
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:06,707
You see...

1518
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:11,077
我的生活很…

1519
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:10,380
...my life is really...

1520
01:20:13,424 --> 01:20:15,624
复杂

1521
01:20:13,722 --> 01:20:14,711
...complex.

1522
01:20:17,627 --> 01:20:19,431
好，你听着

1523
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:22,724
All right, listen. You know how
a normal person gets up and...

1524
01:20:19,432 --> 01:20:23,019
你知道正常人一起床…

1525
01:20:23,072 --> 01:20:27,504
就下楼吃早饭…

1526
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:26,157
...goes downstairs...

1527
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:28,233
...and eats breakfast...

1528
01:20:28,172 --> 01:20:31,008
跟家人吻别…

1529
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:32,062
...and kisses somebody
good-bye, and goes to...

1530
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,315
去上班

1531
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:35,071
...a job, and, you know.

1532
01:20:34,315 --> 01:20:36,046
你懂

1533
01:20:36,182 --> 01:20:37,485
不懂

1534
01:20:37,517 --> 01:20:39,217
不懂？

1535
01:20:40,959 --> 01:20:43,013
好吧，听着

1536
01:20:41,183 --> 01:20:42,411
Look.

1537
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:48,959
我要说的是…

1538
01:20:46,088 --> 01:20:48,420
What I'm trying to tell you is...

1539
01:20:50,002 --> 01:20:51,326
嘿…

1540
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:52,353
Hey, it's okay.

1541
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:54,361
没关系，告诉我无妨

1542
01:20:52,594 --> 01:20:54,084
You can tell me.

1543
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:55,999
好的

1544
01:20:59,107 --> 01:21:02,016
我要说的是…

1545
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:01,359
What I'm trying to tell you is...

1546
01:21:02,049 --> 01:21:04,114
其实…

1547
01:21:04,281 --> 01:21:06,179
我马上回来

1548
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,101
I'll be right back.

1549
01:21:06,221 --> 01:21:07,556
好的

1550
01:21:16,672 --> 01:21:18,465
想我吗？

1551
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,212
Miss me?

1552
01:21:23,451 --> 01:21:27,466
你家真美，空间好大

1553
01:21:23,892 --> 01:21:27,225
Nice place you got here. Lots of space.

1554
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:31,121
Vicki, we've really got to talk.

1555
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:32,285
维琪，咱们得谈谈

1556
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:33,787
真气人

1557
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:37,656
我们吃过饭

1558
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:36,968
We were having dinner.

1559
01:21:37,688 --> 01:21:41,630
我一向在美女面前一把罩

1560
01:21:37,906 --> 01:21:41,239
I was a man doing well
with a beautiful woman.

1561
01:21:41,662 --> 01:21:49,004
你却一个抱歉也不说
就跟那个小瘪三走了

1562
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:44,301
And without so much as an apology...

1563
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:48,812
...you ran off with that
sideshow phony.

1564
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,346
你知道…

1565
01:21:53,589 --> 01:21:54,749
You know...

1566
01:21:56,587 --> 01:22:00,227
我最近发生了悲剧

1567
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,927
...l've recently had
a tragedy in my life.

1568
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:01,595
Alicia...

1569
01:22:00,228 --> 01:22:02,345
爱莉雪

1570
01:22:02,564 --> 01:22:05,234
跳窗自杀了

1571
01:22:02,765 --> 01:22:04,824
...threw herself out a window.

1572
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,158
Oh, my God.

1573
01:22:05,234 --> 01:22:07,059
天呀

1574
01:22:08,572 --> 01:22:10,230
可是…

1575
01:22:08,937 --> 01:22:10,268
But...

1576
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:13,505
塞翁失马焉知非福

1577
01:22:10,773 --> 01:22:13,936
...you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

1578
01:22:25,082 --> 01:22:27,522
瓦尔小姐呀…

1579
01:22:25,354 --> 01:22:26,946
Well, Miss Vale...

1580
01:22:27,554 --> 01:22:31,058
窝里还有只公鸡呀

1581
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:30,351
...another rooster in the hen-house?

1582
01:22:32,801 --> 01:22:37,327
简直令我伤心欲绝

1583
01:22:33,195 --> 01:22:36,187
Take thy beak from out my heart.

1584
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,634
布鲁斯

1585
01:22:42,344 --> 01:22:46,755
布鲁斯韦恩，对吗？

1586
01:22:42,538 --> 01:22:45,632
Bruce...Wayne, n'est-ce pas?

1587
01:22:47,684 --> 01:22:50,124
大部份时候是

1588
01:22:48,043 --> 01:22:49,203
Most of the time.

1589
01:22:55,361 --> 01:22:58,270
我知道你是谁

1590
01:22:55,717 --> 01:22:57,207
I know you.

1591
01:23:00,169 --> 01:23:04,132
我说给你听吧，杰克

1592
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:02,983
Let me tell you
about this guy I know.

1593
01:23:03,892 --> 01:23:07,225
Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.

1594
01:23:04,174 --> 01:23:06,333
下流、龌龊

1595
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:07,866
专门害人

1596
01:23:07,729 --> 01:23:09,560
I like him already.

1597
01:23:07,908 --> 01:23:10,640
我已经喜欢上他了

1598
01:23:12,675 --> 01:23:15,251
知道问题在那吗？

1599
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:15,165
You know what the problem was?

1600
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:17,420
他短路、阿达

1601
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:18,496
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.

1602
01:23:17,462 --> 01:23:23,135
他已经成不了气候了
满肚子烂肠烂肉

1603
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:22,495
He started to lose it. He had a
head full of bad wiring, I guess.

1604
01:23:22,732 --> 01:23:25,223
Couldn't keep it straight up here.

1605
01:23:23,136 --> 01:23:26,431
脑袋已经报销了

1606
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:28,833
He was the kind of guy who...

1607
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:33,273
他是个
不见棺材不流泪的人

1608
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:33,405
...couldn't hear the train
until it was two feet from him.

1609
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,173
You know what happened
to this guy?

1610
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:41,816
知道他的下场吗？

1611
01:23:42,859 --> 01:23:44,256
听着

1612
01:23:45,087 --> 01:23:47,021
He made mistakes.

1613
01:23:45,456 --> 01:23:47,719
他犯了错

1614
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:52,255
Then he ended up with his lights out!
Now you want to get nuts?

1615
01:23:48,856 --> 01:23:53,632
后来就发了疯
你也想发疯吗？

1616
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,189
Come on! Let's get nuts!

1617
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:56,230
来吧，大伙一起疯

1618
01:23:55,744 --> 01:23:58,202
告诉我件事

1619
01:23:55,765 --> 01:23:57,255
Tell me something.

1620
01:23:58,839 --> 01:24:02,735
可曾在月光下和魔鬼
共舞过？

1621
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:01,526
You ever dance with the
devil in the pale moonlight?

1622
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:03,537
What?

1623
01:24:02,735 --> 01:24:03,870
什么？

1624
01:24:03,903 --> 01:24:07,747
我经常这样问每一个人
枪下小狗

1625
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:06,602
I always ask that of all my prey.

1626
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:09,107
I just like the sound of it.

1627
01:24:07,748 --> 01:24:10,373
我只是喜欢听那种声音

1628
01:24:15,085 --> 01:24:18,169
不要随便挑人的针眼

1629
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:17,775
Never rub another man's rhubarb.

1630
01:24:24,849 --> 01:24:31,809
为什么每次找你
总是杀出程咬金来？

1631
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:28,728
Why is it every time I come for you...

1632
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:31,962
...somebody always gets in the way?

1633
01:24:32,081 --> 01:24:34,706
我需要独处一下

1634
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:34,462
I'll need a moment alone.

1635
01:24:36,854 --> 01:24:40,980
我只是皮笑肉不笑而已

1636
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:39,968
I'm only laughing on the outside.

1637
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:43,970
My smile is just skin deep.

1638
01:24:41,022 --> 01:24:44,856
内心痛苦无比

1639
01:24:45,056 --> 01:24:48,255
但愿你看得透我

1640
01:24:45,147 --> 01:24:46,808
If you could see inside...

1641
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:49,140
...l'm really crying.

1642
01:24:48,286 --> 01:24:50,286
心在哭泣

1643
01:24:50,152 --> 01:24:52,313
You might join me for a weep.

1644
01:24:50,287 --> 01:24:54,653
你会陪我痛哭一场的

1645
01:25:36,911 --> 01:25:39,838
说了你也不信

1646
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:39,294
You really wouldn't believe it.

1647
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:44,470
While you were entertaining, I've been
finding out about your street corner.

1648
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:43,017
你乐得去享受

1649
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:46,008
我却到处找你

1650
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:47,810
瓦尔

1651
01:25:48,187 --> 01:25:51,240
你朋友完蛋了

1652
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,968
I think your friend is screwed up.

1653
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:54,406
还有更精彩的

1654
01:25:51,881 --> 01:25:53,473
More good news.

1655
01:25:54,721 --> 01:25:56,179
你瞧

1656
01:25:56,919 --> 01:26:00,222
汤玛斯韦恩被害
儿子幸免

1657
01:26:01,192 --> 01:26:03,056
我的天

1658
01:26:01,557 --> 01:26:03,218
Oh, my God!

1659
01:26:03,287 --> 01:26:06,777
他父母在那被谋害

1660
01:26:03,726 --> 01:26:06,058
His parents were murdered
in that alley.

1661
01:26:06,850 --> 01:26:10,049
所以他才会去那

1662
01:26:06,996 --> 01:26:08,987
That's why he went there.

1663
01:26:13,364 --> 01:26:16,688
他当场目睹一切

1664
01:26:13,569 --> 01:26:16,231
He watched it happen in front of him.

1665
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:19,125
瞧他脸上的表情

1666
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:18,570
Look at the look on his face.

1667
01:26:19,127 --> 01:26:22,357
和在市政府时一样

1668
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:21,507
It was the same at City Hall.

1669
01:26:22,868 --> 01:26:27,733
这种事对孩子的影响
会有多大？

1670
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:25,673
What do you suppose
this does to a kid?

1671
01:26:29,371 --> 01:26:30,860
瓦尔

1672
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:33,227
别太感性了

1673
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,411
Don't get personal!

1674
01:26:45,106 --> 01:26:46,439
阿福

1675
01:26:47,045 --> 01:26:49,941
我父母的档案弄到了吗？

1676
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:49,327
The file on my parents?

1677
01:26:49,983 --> 01:26:52,077
全在你桌上

1678
01:26:50,005 --> 01:26:51,666
It's on your table.

1679
01:26:52,078 --> 01:26:53,692
谢谢你

1680
01:27:00,113 --> 01:27:02,873
你想些什么？

1681
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:02,077
What's on your mind?

1682
01:27:04,186 --> 01:27:08,179
I have no wish to fill my
few remaining years...

1683
01:27:04,187 --> 01:27:10,209
我不想在余年
再为朋友的死伤神

1684
01:27:08,591 --> 01:27:10,923
...grieving for old friends...

1685
01:27:14,754 --> 01:27:17,379
或者朋友的儿子

1686
01:27:15,197 --> 01:27:17,028
...or their sons.

1687
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:39,888
两百周年纪念活动
无限延期

1688
01:27:35,217 --> 01:27:39,881
The 200th anniversary birthday gala
has been indefinitely postponed.

1689
01:27:40,057 --> 01:27:42,932
我们无力保证大众的安全

1690
01:27:40,389 --> 01:27:42,380
We cannot guarantee public safety.

1691
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:44,286
Joker here.

1692
01:27:42,933 --> 01:27:44,297
我是丑客

1693
01:27:44,329 --> 01:27:47,131
有干扰，通知人去修

1694
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:45,924
We got interference.

1695
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:49,720
Now you fellows have said
some pretty mean things.

1696
01:27:47,164 --> 01:27:49,935
你们说了些丑话

1697
01:27:49,936 --> 01:27:52,258
有些是真的

1698
01:27:49,965 --> 01:27:53,401
Some of which were true
under that fiend...

1699
01:27:52,301 --> 01:27:56,197
由那个魔头
格里森口中说出

1700
01:27:53,636 --> 01:27:54,967
...Boss Grissom.

1701
01:27:55,237 --> 01:27:58,070
He was a thief...and a terrorist.

1702
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,729
他是个贼，也是恐怖份子

1703
01:27:58,307 --> 01:28:01,970
On the other hand, he had
a tremendous singing voice.

1704
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:02,003
不过嘛，他的歌声很美

1705
01:28:02,035 --> 01:28:07,265
他已经作古了
并交我接管

1706
01:28:02,244 --> 01:28:06,078
He's dead now, and he's
left me in charge.

1707
01:28:09,048 --> 01:28:12,174
我可能有点戏剧化

1708
01:28:09,418 --> 01:28:11,750
I can be theatrical...

1709
01:28:12,087 --> 01:28:14,578
...and maybe even a little rough.

1710
01:28:12,216 --> 01:28:15,008
也或许凶了点

1711
01:28:15,009 --> 01:28:19,448
不过我绝不是个杀人凶手

1712
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:17,490
But one thing I am not...

1713
01:28:17,827 --> 01:28:19,317
...is a killer!

1714
01:28:20,219 --> 01:28:22,990
我是个艺术家

1715
01:28:22,991 --> 01:28:25,470
我喜欢派对

1716
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,660
I love a good party.

1717
01:28:25,513 --> 01:28:27,743
和谈

1718
01:28:25,935 --> 01:28:27,493
So, truce.

1719
01:28:27,785 --> 01:28:31,441
周年庆照常举行

1720
01:28:28,103 --> 01:28:31,266
Commence au festival!

1721
01:28:31,984 --> 01:28:35,505
我有个惊喜送高谭市民

1722
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:35,333
And I've got a surprise
for Gotham City.

1723
01:28:36,289 --> 01:28:42,228
今天午夜我要当众
洒下两千万美元

1724
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:40,679
At midnight, I will dump
20 million in cash...

1725
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:42,314
...on the crowd.

1726
01:28:45,094 --> 01:28:48,084
不用担心，我多的是钱

1727
01:28:45,454 --> 01:28:47,854
Don't worry about me.
I've got enough.

1728
01:28:48,123 --> 01:28:51,183
We are not prepared
to discuss any deals.

1729
01:28:48,127 --> 01:28:51,388
我们绝不谈条件

1730
01:28:53,233 --> 01:28:56,816
各位听到了，两千万哪

1731
01:28:53,629 --> 01:28:55,961
You heard it, folks, 20 million.

1732
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,690
And there will be entertainment.

1733
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:59,297
还有余兴节目

1734
01:28:59,268 --> 01:29:03,932
The big dukeroo. With me in one
corner, and in the other corner...

1735
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,392
生死决战

1736
01:29:01,393 --> 01:29:03,757
一边是在下我

1737
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,904
另一边是…

1738
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:08,806
...the man who has brought
real terror to Gotham City...

1739
01:29:05,905 --> 01:29:09,426
给高谭市制造恐怖的人

1740
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:10,701
...Batman.

1741
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:11,125
蝙蝠侠

1742
01:29:11,167 --> 01:29:13,365
你听到了吧？

1743
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:12,703
Can you hear me?

1744
01:29:13,367 --> 01:29:15,231
你我俩决战

1745
01:29:13,382 --> 01:29:14,872
Just the two of us.

1746
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:17,141
Mano y mano.

1747
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:17,898
空手单挑

1748
01:29:17,932 --> 01:29:21,141
我以真面目相见

1749
01:29:18,153 --> 01:29:20,553
I have taken off my make-up.

1750
01:29:21,141 --> 01:29:25,162
看你有没有种

1751
01:29:21,557 --> 01:29:23,149
Let's see...

1752
01:29:23,392 --> 01:29:26,327
...if you can take off yours.

1753
01:31:38,262 --> 01:31:40,325
告诉我，小鬼

1754
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:40,518
Tell me, kid.

1755
01:31:40,533 --> 01:31:45,294
你曾在月光下和魔鬼
共舞过吗？

1756
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:45,524
Did you ever dance with the
devil by the pale moonlight?

1757
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,330
快走

1758
01:31:53,308 --> 01:31:54,866
Let's go!

1759
01:31:57,373 --> 01:31:59,342
快走，杰克

1760
01:31:57,813 --> 01:31:59,474
Let's go, Jack!

1761
01:32:02,543 --> 01:32:04,272
后会有期

1762
01:32:03,152 --> 01:32:04,710
See you around.

1763
01:32:31,179 --> 01:32:32,345
嗨

1764
01:32:34,056 --> 01:32:36,348
我疯了吗

1765
01:32:34,516 --> 01:32:36,347
Am I crazy?

1766
01:32:38,161 --> 01:32:42,120
今晚兴过去不一样吧？

1767
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:41,918
That wasn't just another night
for either of us, was it?

1768
01:32:43,351 --> 01:32:45,153
我是说…

1769
01:32:45,258 --> 01:32:49,446
我们拥有对方是吗？

1770
01:32:45,427 --> 01:32:48,419
We both got to each other, didn't we?

1771
01:32:51,136 --> 01:32:54,001
为何不接受我？

1772
01:32:51,366 --> 01:32:53,527
Why won't you let me in?

1773
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:55,991
为什么？

1774
01:32:58,201 --> 01:33:00,253
我接受了

1775
01:32:58,707 --> 01:33:00,197
You got in.

1776
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:08,205
第一次见面我就爱上了你

1777
01:33:05,047 --> 01:33:07,106
I've loved you since I met you.

1778
01:33:08,205 --> 01:33:10,497
但我想不透这一切

1779
01:33:08,617 --> 01:33:11,950
But I don't know what
to think of all this.

1780
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,300
真的不懂

1781
01:33:12,221 --> 01:33:16,885
Sometimes I don't know, either.
It's just something I have to do.

1782
01:33:12,342 --> 01:33:14,894
有时候连我也一样

1783
01:33:14,937 --> 01:33:16,906
我势必要做的事

1784
01:33:16,939 --> 01:33:18,428
为什么？

1785
01:33:17,126 --> 01:33:18,457
Why?

1786
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,491
因为没有别人能

1787
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:20,892
Because nobody else can.

1788
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:27,306
我企图逃避这一切
但我没办法

1789
01:33:24,233 --> 01:33:27,066
I tried to avoid all this, but I can't.

1790
01:33:27,307 --> 01:33:30,109
事情就是如此

1791
01:33:27,469 --> 01:33:29,300
This is how it is.

1792
01:33:30,072 --> 01:33:31,733
It's not a perfect world.

1793
01:33:30,152 --> 01:33:32,204
世界并不完美

1794
01:33:32,074 --> 01:33:34,907
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.

1795
01:33:32,205 --> 01:33:35,903
世界不必非完美不可

1796
01:33:38,489 --> 01:33:46,043
我只想知道
我们是否要彼此相爱？

1797
01:33:39,081 --> 01:33:43,245
I just have to know, are we
going to try to love each other?

1798
01:33:46,085 --> 01:33:48,950
我愿意一试

1799
01:33:46,655 --> 01:33:48,088
I'd like to.

1800
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:52,056
他还在外面猖狂

1801
01:33:49,591 --> 01:33:51,491
But he's out there right now.

1802
01:33:51,994 --> 01:33:53,757
And I've got to go to work.

1803
01:33:52,088 --> 01:33:54,057
我得做事了

1804
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:38,194
上天吧，小飞人

1805
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:38,590
Into the air, Junior Birdman!

1806
01:35:38,196 --> 01:35:39,925
失手了

1807
01:35:38,767 --> 01:35:40,098
Missed me!

1808
01:35:41,603 --> 01:35:43,537
Yeah! Watch me!

1809
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:43,905
瞧我的

1810
01:38:04,163 --> 01:38:06,247
快点拍

1811
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:07,374
Get them. Take the pictures.

1812
01:38:07,529 --> 01:38:10,227
高谭市民贪婪图

1813
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:09,781
Gotham's greed.

1814
01:38:37,771 --> 01:38:42,970
各位乡亲父老
该选最信任的人的时候了

1815
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,243
And now, folks...

1816
01:38:40,482 --> 01:38:42,916
...it's time for, "Who Do You Trust?"

1817
01:38:43,002 --> 01:38:46,034
钱钱钱呀，你们信任谁？

1818
01:38:43,185 --> 01:38:45,813
Money, money! Who do you trust?

1819
01:38:46,077 --> 01:38:47,045
我吗？

1820
01:38:46,088 --> 01:38:48,921
Me? I'm giving away free money.

1821
01:38:47,077 --> 01:38:49,307
我无条件洒钞票呀

1822
01:38:49,339 --> 01:38:52,245
而蝙蝠侠呢？

1823
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:52,492
And where...is the Batman?

1824
01:38:53,049 --> 01:38:55,705
他却在家里洗丝袜

1825
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:56,921
He's at home, washing his tights.

1826
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:09,045
大苍蝇夜空翱翔
却发现我早胸有成竹

1827
01:39:05,006 --> 01:39:09,443
Winged battle flies through
the night and finds me ready.

1828
01:39:09,087 --> 01:39:10,983
巴勃，面罩

1829
01:39:09,711 --> 01:39:11,702
Bob. Mask.

1830
01:39:12,025 --> 01:39:13,650
戴下面罩

1831
01:39:12,514 --> 01:39:14,505
Masks! Put them on now!

1832
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:26,989
现在是我要拯救你们
于无意义生活的时候了

1833
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:16,840
And now...

1834
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,847
...comes the part...

1835
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:23,288
...where I relieve you,
the little people...

1836
01:39:23,525 --> 01:39:26,221
...of the burden...of your failed...

1837
01:39:26,528 --> 01:39:28,223
...and useless lives.

1838
01:39:27,188 --> 01:39:30,220
正如我的美容师说的

1839
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:32,456
But, as my plastic surgeon always
said, "If you got to go...

1840
01:39:30,356 --> 01:39:32,398
既然非死不可

1841
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:34,420
就带着笑走

1842
01:39:32,868 --> 01:39:34,733
...go with a smile."

1843
01:40:05,183 --> 01:40:06,693
我的天

1844
01:40:05,767 --> 01:40:06,665
My God.

1845
01:40:06,746 --> 01:40:08,464
是毒气

1846
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:09,000
Smylex gas.

1847
01:40:08,508 --> 01:40:10,821
他要毒死大家

1848
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,165
He's going to kill everybody!

1849
01:40:10,821 --> 01:40:12,508
上车
不要

1850
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:14,069
Get in the car. Get in the car!

1851
01:40:21,617 --> 01:40:22,804
快呀

1852
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:23,647
Hurry!

1853
01:42:14,268 --> 01:42:15,663
我的汽球

1854
01:42:15,297 --> 01:42:16,457
My balloons!

1855
01:42:26,243 --> 01:42:28,066
是我的汽球

1856
01:42:27,142 --> 01:42:28,473
They're my balloons!

1857
01:42:54,514 --> 01:42:57,452
他偷我的汽球

1858
01:42:55,437 --> 01:42:57,564
He stole my balloons!

1859
01:42:57,579 --> 01:43:01,882
为什么没人告诉我
他有那玩意

1860
01:42:58,506 --> 01:43:02,670
Why didn't somebody tell me he
had one of those...things?!

1861
01:43:03,216 --> 01:43:05,247
巴勃，枪

1862
01:43:04,346 --> 01:43:06,337
Bob. Gun.

1863
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:14,522
给我一两分钟时间

1864
01:43:12,854 --> 01:43:15,345
I'll need a minute or two alone, boys.

1865
01:43:15,316 --> 01:43:16,662
快滚开

1866
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:17,521
Get out of here!

1867
01:44:08,776 --> 01:44:11,980
来呀，你这畜牲
过来呀

1868
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:13,407
Come on, you gruesome son-of-a-bitch.
Come to me.

1869
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:51,164
达令

1870
01:45:50,612 --> 01:45:51,943
Darling.

1871
01:45:53,232 --> 01:45:56,937
我得准时送你去教堂

1872
01:45:54,115 --> 01:45:57,050
I've got to get you to
the church on time.

1873
01:46:00,488 --> 01:46:01,646
什么事？

1874
01:46:01,918 --> 01:46:05,790
高谭市大教堂
两人份交通工具

1875
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:06,226
Gotham City Cathedral.
Transportation for two.

1876
01:46:05,791 --> 01:46:06,896
马上来

1877
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:08,793
-Right away, sir?
-Five minutes.

1878
01:46:06,898 --> 01:46:09,089
5分钟    5分钟

1879
01:46:13,244 --> 01:46:15,237
还是10分钟吧

1880
01:46:14,235 --> 01:46:15,532
Better make it ten.

1881
01:46:15,478 --> 01:46:17,116
好的，就10分钟

1882
01:49:46,741 --> 01:49:48,077
走吧

1883
01:49:47,515 --> 01:49:48,675
Let's go.

1884
01:49:55,761 --> 01:49:58,130
探照灯对着塔台

1885
01:49:56,624 --> 01:49:59,957
Point those searchlights
at the tower. Now! Move!

1886
01:49:58,162 --> 01:49:59,602
快，快

1887
01:50:30,232 --> 01:50:33,770
说我有点阿达的确不假

1888
01:50:30,324 --> 01:50:34,317
It can be truly said that
I have a bat in my belfry.

1889
01:50:42,602 --> 01:50:44,303
跳支舞吧？

1890
01:50:43,404 --> 01:50:44,894
Shall we dance?

1891
01:52:06,921 --> 01:52:09,082
You know, without you...

1892
01:52:07,444 --> 01:52:12,558
没有你…
我的日子怎么过？

1893
01:52:09,991 --> 01:52:12,824
...l just wouldn't want to go on.

1894
01:53:36,513 --> 01:53:39,039
我俩是天作之合

1895
01:53:36,577 --> 01:53:39,068
We were made for each other.

1896
01:53:39,081 --> 01:53:41,607
美女兴野兽

1897
01:53:39,513 --> 01:53:41,674
Beauty and the Beast.

1898
01:53:41,993 --> 01:53:48,903
如果有人当你是野兽的话
老子就挖出他的内脏

1899
01:53:42,416 --> 01:53:45,180
Of course, if anyone
calls you "Beast"...

1900
01:53:45,419 --> 01:53:47,751
...l'll rip their lungs out.

1901
01:54:18,135 --> 01:54:20,190
丑客先生

1902
01:54:18,452 --> 01:54:19,942
Mr. Joker?

1903
01:54:23,574 --> 01:54:26,882
你说话真动听

1904
01:54:23,724 --> 01:54:26,215
You say such beautiful things.

1905
01:54:27,628 --> 01:54:30,722
And you're so powerful.
And purple!

1906
01:54:27,697 --> 01:54:32,363
而你又如此强壮有力
一身大紫

1907
01:54:32,566 --> 01:54:33,726
I love purple!

1908
01:54:32,667 --> 01:54:33,073
我喜欢紫色

1909
01:54:33,073 --> 01:54:35,264
我喜欢紫色

1910
01:54:37,009 --> 01:54:41,748
对不起
可曾在月光下和魔鬼共舞

1911
01:54:37,138 --> 01:54:38,298
Excuse me.

1912
01:54:38,806 --> 01:54:41,240
Ever dance with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

1913
01:54:45,664 --> 01:54:47,960
我要你的命

1914
01:54:45,813 --> 01:54:46,973
I'm going to kill you.

1915
01:54:47,915 --> 01:54:49,576
You idiot!

1916
01:54:48,138 --> 01:54:52,637
白痴，也许
是你害的，记得吧？

1917
01:54:50,084 --> 01:54:52,143
You made me, remember?!

1918
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:54,411
You dropped me into the chemicals!

1919
01:54:52,668 --> 01:54:55,350
你把我丢进硫酸中的

1920
01:54:54,655 --> 01:54:58,819
That wasn't easy to get over!
And don't think I didn't try.

1921
01:54:55,351 --> 01:54:59,306
我再努力也无法忘怀
这一切

1922
01:54:59,093 --> 01:55:00,321
I know you did.

1923
01:55:28,058 --> 01:55:29,957
你杀了我父母

1924
01:55:28,189 --> 01:55:29,622
You killed my parents.

1925
01:55:29,857 --> 01:55:31,017
What?

1926
01:55:29,989 --> 01:55:31,387
什么？

1927
01:55:33,027 --> 01:55:34,863
你说什么？

1928
01:55:33,194 --> 01:55:34,183
What are you saying?

1929
01:55:35,029 --> 01:55:37,691
I made you, but you made me first.

1930
01:55:35,032 --> 01:55:38,977
我害了你
不过最初是你害我的

1931
01:55:39,082 --> 01:55:41,179
我当初只是个小孩

1932
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,961
I was just a kid.

1933
01:55:41,135 --> 01:55:43,626
I say you made me,
you say I made you.

1934
01:55:41,181 --> 01:55:44,458
我说你害我，你说我害你

1935
01:55:43,871 --> 01:55:46,032
How childish can you get?

1936
01:55:44,489 --> 01:55:46,723
我俩真幼稚

1937
01:55:46,307 --> 01:55:48,867
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses on.

1938
01:55:46,723 --> 01:55:49,457
你不会打戴眼镜人吧？

1939
01:56:05,097 --> 01:56:07,372
你笑什么？

1940
01:56:05,226 --> 01:56:07,057
What are you laughing at?

1941
01:56:14,235 --> 01:56:16,294
Let me lend you a hand.

1942
01:56:14,816 --> 01:56:16,225
我帮忙你

1943
01:56:24,212 --> 01:56:25,902
伸出援手

1944
01:56:24,411 --> 01:56:25,742
Lend you a hand!

1945
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:36,082
They don't make them
like they used to!

1946
01:56:33,858 --> 01:56:37,396
现在人最会偷工减料了

1947
01:56:39,994 --> 01:56:41,427
Hey, Batsy!

1948
01:56:40,037 --> 01:56:41,529
蝙仔

1949
01:56:54,904 --> 01:56:56,344
他在那

1950
01:56:55,109 --> 01:56:56,838
There he is! Down there!

1951
01:56:56,678 --> 01:56:58,243
在下面

1952
01:57:10,573 --> 01:57:13,140
我该下台了

1953
01:57:10,824 --> 01:57:12,155
It's time to retire.

1954
01:57:13,961 --> 01:57:16,293
Feel free to drop in.

1955
01:57:13,977 --> 01:57:16,680
有空随时来玩

1956
01:57:25,539 --> 01:57:28,201
Sometimes I just kill myself!

1957
01:57:25,574 --> 01:57:29,446
有时真会笑死我

1958
01:57:33,195 --> 01:57:34,520
抓稳

1959
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:34,708
Hold on!

1960
01:59:45,779 --> 01:59:50,273
Our police have rounded up
all of the Joker's men.

1961
01:59:45,953 --> 01:59:50,619
警方已将丑客的人
一网打尽

1962
01:59:50,617 --> 01:59:52,778
The reign of crime is over.

1963
01:59:50,652 --> 01:59:53,386
犯罪组织已消灭了

1964
01:59:53,287 --> 01:59:56,779
Public safety in Gotham City is
no longer a laughing matter.

1965
01:59:53,428 --> 01:59:57,373
高谭市的治安
已不再是笑柄了

1966
01:59:57,024 --> 01:59:59,618
Aren't you covering
the press conference?

1967
01:59:57,375 --> 01:59:59,963
你不要采访记者招待会吗

1968
02:00:00,015 --> 02:00:00,901
不要

1969
02:00:00,694 --> 02:00:02,685
What about our Pulitzer Prize?

1970
02:00:00,945 --> 02:00:03,575
我们的普立兹奖呢？

1971
02:00:03,364 --> 02:00:04,797
What about us?

1972
02:00:03,617 --> 02:00:05,766
我们的事呢？

1973
02:00:05,699 --> 02:00:07,360
What about your picture of Batman?

1974
02:00:05,767 --> 02:00:09,284
你说的蝙蝠侠照片呢？

1975
02:00:16,377 --> 02:00:17,469
Take care.

1976
02:00:16,385 --> 02:00:18,002
保重罗

1977
02:00:20,455 --> 02:00:23,920
我们收到蝙蝠侠的信了

1978
02:00:20,481 --> 02:00:22,813
We received a letter from Batman.

1979
02:00:25,038 --> 02:00:27,866
请转告高谭市民

1980
02:00:25,052 --> 02:00:27,486
"Please inform
the citizens of Gotham...

1981
02:00:27,721 --> 02:00:30,554
...that Gotham City's
earned a rest from crime.

1982
02:00:27,909 --> 02:00:31,541
高谭市已无犯罪事件

1983
02:00:31,492 --> 02:00:34,825
But if the forces of evil
should rise again...

1984
02:00:31,584 --> 02:00:35,550
万一歹徒敢再蠢动的话

1985
02:00:35,162 --> 02:00:38,063
...to cast a shadow on
the heart of the city.

1986
02:00:35,593 --> 02:00:38,692
为害高谭市

1987
02:00:38,499 --> 02:00:39,830
Call me."

1988
02:00:38,735 --> 02:00:40,926
请通知我

1989
02:00:40,167 --> 02:00:42,829
Question. How do we call him?

1990
02:00:41,878 --> 02:00:44,810
请问如何通知他？

1991
02:00:48,008 --> 02:00:49,839
He gave us a signal.

1992
02:00:48,016 --> 02:00:52,044
他要我们放出讯号

1993
02:01:25,446 --> 02:01:28,438
I thought champagne
would be in order, ma'am.

1994
02:01:25,838 --> 02:01:29,042
还是喝香槟比较适合

1995
02:01:28,782 --> 02:01:30,113
Hi, Alfred.

1996
02:01:29,043 --> 02:01:30,629
嗨，阿福

1997
02:01:39,126 --> 02:01:40,889
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you...

1998
02:01:39,231 --> 02:01:44,001
韦恩先生要我转告你…
他可能稍晚一点

1999
02:01:41,061 --> 02:01:43,052
...that he might be a little late.

2000
02:01:45,966 --> 02:01:48,230
I'm not a bit surprised.

2001
02:01:46,038 --> 02:01:48,543
我一点也不觉意外

2002
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:48,877
我一点也不觉意外
