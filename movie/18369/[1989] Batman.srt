1
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,680
Thank you. Hi.
I'd like to go to the Adelphi Hotel.

2
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,000
This is my cab.

3
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,320
I was here first!

4
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, God.

5
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,200
Taxi! Taxi!

6
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,400
Taxi!

7
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,240
Let's go across. Come on.

8
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,520
We'll get one down the road.
Hurry.

9
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,040
For God's sake, Harold,
can we please get a taxi?

10
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm trying to get a.... Taxi!

11
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,120
We're going the wrong way!

12
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,240
Jimmy, put that away.
We look like tourists.

13
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,960
Let's cut over to Seventh.

14
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,120
Seventh is that way.
I know where we are!

15
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,200
Hey, give me a dollar.

16
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,800
How about it? One dollar.

17
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,840
Are you deaf? You don't speak English?

18
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,920
Come on! Up here.

19
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520


20
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,960
Hey, lady...

21
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,400
...do the kid a favor. Don't scream.

22
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,400
Hey, all right!

23
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
American Express card.

24
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
"Don't leave home without it."

25
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,400
Get out of here.

26
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,400
I don't like it up here.

27
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
Are you scared of heights?

28
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know.
After what happened to Johnny Gobs--

29
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,320
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and
took a walk off a roof. No big loss.

30
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,400
That ain't what I heard at all.

31
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,960
I heard that the Bat got him.

32
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,920
The Bat? Give me a break, will you?

33
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,000
Five stories. Straight down.
There wasn't no blood in the body.

34
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,280
No shit. It was all over the pavement.

35
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,640
-I'm getting out of here.
-Shut up. Listen to me.

36
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
There ain't no Bat.

37
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,520
You shouldn't have turned
the gun on that kid.

38
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,360
You want your cut of this money or not?
Now shut up! Shut up!

39
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
Don't kill me!

40
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
Don't kill me!

41
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

42
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,840
I won't kill you.
I want you to do me a favor.

43
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,600
Tell all your friends about me.

44
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,880
What are you?

45
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,440
I'm Batman.

46
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
Across this nation...

47
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,200
...the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.

48
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,360
Our streets are overrun,
our public officials are helpless.

49
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
As mayor, I promise to root out
the source of this corruption...

50
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,520
...Boss Carl Grissom.

51
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,040
Now, our new District Attorney,
Harvey Dent...

52
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,920
...will carry out that promise.

53
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
Thank you, Mayor Borg. Thank you.

54
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,240
People of Gotham City...

55
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,120
...I'm a man of few words.

56
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,600
But those words will count,
and so will my actions.

57
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,000
Commissioner Gordon informs me...

58
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,320
...that he has targeted those businesses...

59
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,600
...suspected of fronting for
the syndicate in this city.

60
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,920
Before this week is out...

61
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,160
...we are going to knock
down their doors...

62
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,640
...and shed the light of the law
on that nest of vipers.

63
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,440
Together, we can make
this city safe for decent people.

64
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,720
Decent people shouldn't live here.

65
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,480
They'd be happier someplace else.

66
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,200
Pretty tough talk about Carl.

67
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,440
Forget about it.

68
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,520
If this clown could touch Grissom,
I'd have handed him his lungs by now.

69
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,760
If Grissom knew about us...

70
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,480
...he might hand you something.

71
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,800
Don't flatter yourself, angel.

72
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,600
He's a tired old man.
He can't run this city without me.

73
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
And besides...

74
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,840
...he doesn't know.

75
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,720
You don't worry about anything,
do you, Jack?

76
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,200
You look fine.

77
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,920
I didn't ask.

78
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,520
Yeah. Hanging on.

79
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,200
Let me guess.

80
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,640
Giant, menacing, supernatural form.
Kind of like a bat.

81
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,520
That's it. What are they seeing
up there?

82
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,680
They're drinking Drano.

83
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,200
It's weird.

84
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,960
Thanks for the tip.

85
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,920
Christ. Knox.

86
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,280
Lieutenant, I hear we had
another Bat attack.

87
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,000
That's eight sightings in a month.
I hear the Commissioner's opened a file.

88
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,760
Sorry, Knox.
These two slipped on a banana peel.

89
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,600
I'm telling you, a giant bat!

90
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,280
Don't write about this. It will ruin
your already useless reputation.

91
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,720
Lieutenant, every punk
in this town is scared.

92
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,600
They say he can't be killed.

93
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,760
They say he drinks blood.

94
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,040
I say you're full of shit, Knox.

95
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,080
You can quote me on that.

96
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,840
Is there a six-foot bat
in Gotham City?

97
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,160
Is he on the police payroll?

98
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,040
What's he pulling down, after taxes?

99
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,400
Brought you a little snack, Eckhardt.

100
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,960
Why don't you broadcast it?
Shut up and listen.

101
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,920
Harvey Dent has been sniffing
around one of our front companies.

102
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,360
That's my territory.
If there's a problem, I deal with it.

103
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,920
Your problems are our problems.

104
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,600
I answer to Grissom, not to psychos.

105
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,960
You ought to think about the future.

106
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,640
You mean when you run the show?
You got no future, Jack.

107
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,240
You're an A-1 nut-boy,
and Grissom knows it.

108
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,400
Better be sure.

109
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,880
See?

110
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,520
You can make a good decision
when you try.

111
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,520
Where've you been spending your nights?

112
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,360
I don't care if this festival
is in debt, I want a parade.

113
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,680
I want hot dogs, balloons, everything.

114
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,440
We'll celebrate this 200th
anniversary proudly and publicly.

115
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,800
We may celebrate
in bankruptcy court.

116
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,880
It's $250,000 in debt
and we haven't seen one balloon.

117
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,560
You fill the square with people,
and businesses will come back.

118
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,360
A lot of people may stay away.
They're scared.

119
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,560
They won't be scared when you
get Grissom in the courthouse.

120
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,960
I promised that, remember?

121
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
Welcome, Count Dracula.

122
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,520
Had any sightings of Big Foot lately?

123
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,640
They buried your story on Batman.

124
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,400
They bury garbage.

125
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,840
This is Pulitzer Prize stuff.

126
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,040
I got something for you.

127
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,400
Very funny. You should have put
more gore under the fangs.

128
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,680
What a dick.

129
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,840
Hello, legs.

130
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,080
I'm reading your stuff.

131
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,080
Well, I'm reading yours.

132
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,080
Hi, I'm Vicki Vale.

133
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,120
Yeah, photographer. Vogue, Cosmo. Yeah.

134
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,600
If you want me to pose nude,
you'll need a long lens.

135
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,200
Actually, I was in the Corto Maltese.

136
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,280
You could get hurt doing this stuff.

137
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
What brings you here?

138
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,400
I'm here to see the wildlife in Gotham City.

139
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,720
Wildlife?
Mm hmm.

140
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,880
Like what?

141
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,240
Like...bats.

142
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
-Who sent you?
-Nobody, really.

143
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,080
I just loved your story, and...

144
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,680
...l like bats.

145
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,120
Yeah?

146
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,520
My pictures, your words.
Pulitzer Prize material. Just think.

147
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,320
Okay, you're a visionary,
and also the only one who believes me.

148
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,160
I need something tangible.

149
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,360
Gordon's got a file.
I can't even get him on the phone.

150
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,040
He'll be at Bruce Wayne's benefit, right?

151
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,320
Yeah. I don't seem to be on the guest list.
No.

152
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,760
Yes, yes. Vale, will you marry me?

153
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,000
No.
Buy me lunch?

154
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,640
Maybe.
I eat light.

155
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,040
Say this...

156
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,800
...son of a bitch...

157
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
...makes a connection
with us and with Axis Chemicals.

158
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,800
What kind of damage are we looking at?

159
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,280
If he ties us with
Axis Chemicals, we're dead and buried.

160
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,600
We should move immediately.

161
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,600
I say we break into the place...

162
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,520
...trash the office...

163
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,040
...and make off with the records
and say it was industrial espionage.

164
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,600
Jack....

165
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,600
Smart thinking. That's the way to go.
In fact...

166
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,000
...I'd like you to handle
this operation personally.

167
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,000
Me?

168
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Hello, sweetheart.

169
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,400
Would you mind waiting in the next room?

170
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,600
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.
That's all.

171
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
Carl....

172
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,120
Can somebody else do this?

173
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,520
The fumes in that place....

174
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,200
Jack....

175
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,880
It's an important job. I need...

176
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,120
...someone I can trust.

177
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,800
You...are my number one guy.

178
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,480
Now...

179
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,360
...don't forget...

180
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,360
...your lucky deck.

181
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,800
My friend...

182
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,160
...your luck is about to change.

183
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,600
Police Department.

184
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,920
Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt.

185
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
Can I help you, sir?

186
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,920
Oh, thanks. Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.

187
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,680
Here you go.

188
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,960
-Good evening.
-A little crowded.

189
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,960
Excuse me. Excuse me.

190
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,800
Could you tell me who is Bruce Wayne?

191
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm not sure.

192
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,280
Thanks anyway.

193
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,680
Eight. I can make that eight.

194
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,920
I can make that eight.

195
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,960
Commissioner!
Mrs. Gordon, you look lovely.

196
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,320
Is it true the Commissioner
has a file on the Batman?

197
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,400
There is no Bat. If there were,
we would find and arrest him.

198
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,880
Be straight with me, Commissioner.

199
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,640
How're you making out?

200
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Mr. Dent, I love that tie.

201
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,480
We were discussing winged vigilantes.
What's your stand?

202
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,120
We have enough problems in this city...

203
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,760
...without worrying about ghosts.

204
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
Pardon me, but that's not a denial.

205
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
Excuse me, I'll be back.

206
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
Won't anybody go on record?

207
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,120
-Your Honor, great suit.
-No comment.

208
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,000
Robert, what's up?

209
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,040
Anonymous tip.
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

210
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
Why wasn't I told? Who's in charge?

211
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
-Eckhardt.
-Oh, my God!

212
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,800
Come on, let's go.

213
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
Mr. Gordon?

214
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,800
Mr. Gordon?

215
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,760
Wait, wait. Living room,
dining room, arsenal.

216
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,040
Look at this stuff.

217
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,280
Who is this guy?

218
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,080
He gives to humanitarian causes,
and then collects all this stuff.

219
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,000
He probably does it to get chicks.
They like his charity balls.

220
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,800
Don't leave out his very large bankroll.

221
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,960
The more they've got,
the less they're worth.

222
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,360
This guy must be the most
worthless guy in America.

223
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,120
Check this out. He must have been
the King of the Wicker People.

224
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,320
Where'd this come from?

225
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,240
I have no idea.

226
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,120
It's Japanese.

227
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,760
How do you know?

228
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,320
Because I bought it in Japan.

229
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,000
Who are you?
Sorry. Bruce Wayne.

230
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,800
Alexander Knox.

231
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,400
I read your work. I like it... I like it a lot.

232
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,520
Thanks. Can I have a grant?

233
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,520
Vicki Vale.

234
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,240
Hi. Bruce Wayne.

235
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,760
Are you sure?

236
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,560
Yeah... this time. I've seen your pictures
from Corto Maltese, haven't l?

237
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,200
You've got a wonderful eye.

238
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,320
Some people think she has two.

239
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,280
This is an amazing house.
I'd like to shoot it sometime if you...

240
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,240
Mr. Wayne, we need more champagne.
Is that all right?

241
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,920
Sure. Go ahead.

242
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,520
How many cases? Six? Six?

243
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,120
Six is good.

244
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,720
Six. Thanks.

245
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,720
Anyway, will you be staying in Gotham for a while?

246
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,280
I'd love to. I'm intrigued by
Alex's "giant bat" stories.

247
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,920
Oh, right. The bat.... Batman.

248
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,960
A bit light after the war
in Corto Maltese, no?

249
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,440
What do you do for a living?

250
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,200
Commissioner Gordon
was compelled to leave.

251
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,800
Very unexpectedly, sir.

252
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,960
Will you two excuse me?

253
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,720
I think perhaps this way, sir.

254
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,920
They need wine in the front room, and
a Mrs. Daley needs a copy of the menu.

255
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,840
And give Knox a grant.

256
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,200
Nice talking with you, Wayne.

257
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,760
The rich....

258
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,120
Know why they're so odd?
They can afford to be.

259
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,960
Look at this mirror.

260
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,960
Maybe it should be Bruce Vain.

261
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,800
What's up?
Anonymous tip.

262
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,360
Napier's cleaning out Axis Chemicals.

263
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,480
if we could get him, we'd have Grissom.

264
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,920
Why wasn't i told? Who's in charge?

265
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,480
Eckhardt.
Oh, my God!

266
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,440
Come on, let's go.

267
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,680
Take a good look.
This is the guy.

268
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,640
Get a good look.

269
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,160
Shoot to kill. You know what I mean?

270
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,280
Let's move out.

271
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,360
We've been ratted out, boys.

272
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,640
Watch it.

273
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,840
Freeze!

274
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,440
You take the right. Move it.

275
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,080
What the hell's going on?

276
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,960
What are you trying to do?

277
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm in charge, not Carl Grissom.

278
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,600
This is Commissioner Gordon.
i want him taken alive.

279
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,400
i repeat. Any man who opens fire
on Jack Napier will answer to me.

280
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,680
Let me down!

281
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,080
Let me down!

282
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,520
Let me down!

283
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,360
Oh, my God!

284
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,960
Get up on the catwalk, on that side.

285
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,560
You take that side. Be very careful.

286
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,120
Jesus!

287
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,120
Let him go...or I'll do Gordon.

288
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,040
Nice outfit.

289
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
Come on, Jack, let's go!

290
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,160
Come on!

291
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,880
Eckhardt!

292
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,920
Think about the future.

293
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,800
Goddamn it, we had him!

294
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,520
Hold it right there!

295
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,440
Who is this guy?
I don't know.

296
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,920
Until we find out, keep a lid on it.

297
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,000
If there's no Bat,
then who dropped Napier into the acid?

298
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,360
Suicide? I want to get this on tape.

299
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Hello?

300
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,880
He hung up. What have you got?

301
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,760
Here's the inner city.

302
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,960
Here's the sightings so far.

303
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,520
Maybe Batman has
some sort of flight pattern.

304
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,840
This is very good. Tonight we'll go
to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.

305
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,560
No can do. I got a date. Bruce Wayne.

306
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,800
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!

307
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,680
The guy's a stiff.
You could do much better.

308
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,160
Thanks for being so concerned. Bye.

309
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,600
How's the soup?

310
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,080
Excuse me?

311
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,360
The soup. How is it?

312
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,040
It's great.

313
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,360
Could you pass the salt?

314
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,440
Sure.

315
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,600
Did you have trouble
finding the house?

316
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,080
No....

317
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,400
It was no problem.
Good.

318
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,400
Do you like eating in here?

319
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,280
Oh, yeah.

320
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,880
I don't think I've been in this room before.

321
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,120
You want to leave?

322
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,560
Yes.

323
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,560
There was young Master Bruce...

324
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,600
...leading his gray pony
with me on its back...

325
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,240
...like a sack of old potatoes, covered
in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.

326
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,120
That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.

327
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,120
I think I've embarrassed him
for long enough.

328
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,520
I'm off to bed.

329
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,560
Please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.

330
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,120
Good night, miss.
Good night, Alfred.

331
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,080
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, Alfred.

332
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,080
He's really wonderful.
He loves you a lot.

333
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,000
Alfred's great. I couldn't find
my socks without him.

334
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,440
He reminds me of my grandfather.

335
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,200
Were you close to him?

336
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,280
I used to spend summers with
him and my grandmother.

337
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,840
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...

338
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,920
...it was fun.

339
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,280
-That sounds nice.
-Yeah.

340
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,400
What about your family?

341
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,880
Actually, Alfred is my family.

342
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,560
This house and all this stuff
doesn't seem like you at all.

343
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,600
Some of it is very much me.

344
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,480
Some isn't.

345
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,720
That dining room is definitely not you.

346
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,600
The dining room isn't.

347
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,680
Let's see how we did.

348
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh, my God!

349
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,680
Mirror.

350
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Mirror!

351
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,720
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed, Mr. Napier.

352
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,560
You see what I have to work with here.

353
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,520
There are an awful lot of stairs
in this place.

354
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,520
My feet are killing me.

355
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,560
I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.

356
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,480
One drink and I'm flying.

357
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,520
Why are you afraid of flying?

358
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,640
That you, sugar bumps?

359
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,760
Who are you?

360
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,080
It's me.

361
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,160
"Sugar bumps."

362
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,600
You're alive! I heard you'd been--

363
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,000
Fried?

364
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,120
Is that what you heard?

365
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,600
You set me up over a woman.

366
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,240
A woman!

367
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,880
You must be insane.

368
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,320
Don't bother.

369
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,680
Your life won't be worth spit!

370
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,280
I've been dead once already.

371
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,440
It's very liberating...

372
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,720
...if you think of it as...therapy.

373
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,400
Jack, listen.

374
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,880
Maybe we can cut a deal.

375
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,200
Jack?

376
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,320
Jack is dead, my friend.

377
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,720
You can call me...

378
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,080
...Joker.

379
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,960
As you can see...

380
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,800
...I'm a lot happier.

381
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,560
Oh, what a day.

382
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,280
Gotham City.

383
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,240
It always brings a smile to my face.

384
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,960
"Winged Freak...

385
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
"...Terrorizes...."

386
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,160
Wait'll they get a load of me.

387
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,720
Oooh....

388
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,200
I've got an idea. How about lunch
at my place? I'll show you some photos.

389
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,880
Sure. Okay.

390
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,320
Wait a minute. No, I can't. I can't make it.

391
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,520
Okay, we'll do it later in the day.

392
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,840
I can't make it then, either.
I've got a very important meeting today.

393
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,480
What's wrong?

394
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,480
Nothing.

395
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,920
I have to leave town for a few days.

396
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,200
-Okay, we'll do it when you get back.
-All right.

397
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
I have to go. I'm late.

398
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,440
Bye.

399
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,160
-Nice to see you again, ma'am.
-Nice to see you, too.

400
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,080
I'll talk to you guys when you get back.

401
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,120
Back, Miss Vale?
We'll be here for quite a while.

402
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,040
Well, bye.

403
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,400
Honey....

404
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,520
You'll never believe
what happened to me today.

405
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,480
So, gentlemen, that's how it is.
Until Grissom...resurfaces...

406
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,640
...i'm the acting president.

407
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,080
And i say, starting with
this anniversary festival...

408
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,440
...we run this city into the ground.

409
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,640
Why don't we hear this from Grissom?

410
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,840
Yeah.

411
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,800
And what's with that stupid grin?

412
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,320
Life's been good to me.

413
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,840
What if we say "no"?

414
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,080
Well, Tony....

415
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,880
Nobody wants a war.

416
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,840
If we can't do business,
we'll just shake hands and that'll be it.

417
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,200
Yeah?

418
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,040
Yeah.

419
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,040
I got a live one here.

420
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,840
There'll be a hot time
in the old town tonight.

421
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,760
Antoine got a little hot under the collar.

422
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,440
You're crazy.

423
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,320
Haven't you ever heard
of the healing power of laughter?

424
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,360
Now get out of here!
Let's go! Move it!

425
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,400
You think it over.

426
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,200
Go to the Globe, follow that reporter Knox.
Take your camera.

427
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,240
See what he knows about this Batman.

428
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,040
And, Bob...

429
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,560
...remember...you...

430
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,440
...are my number one...

431
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,120
...guy.

432
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,880
Yes, sir.

433
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,840
Your pals...

434
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,360
...they're not bad people.

435
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,000
Maybe we...

436
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,000
...ought to give them
a few days to think it over.

437
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,880
No?

438
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,960
Grease them now?

439
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,080
Okay.

440
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,880
You are a vicious bastard, Rotelli.

441
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,440
I'm glad you're dead.

442
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,320
I'm glad you're dead.

443
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,760
I'm glad you're dead.

444
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,920
I need that.

445
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,480
I'm losing confidence in you.

446
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,240
I thought we were a team.

447
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,880
Is this a personal issue for you?

448
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,200
I just want you to do your job.

449
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,680
I am doing my job.

450
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,480
And I'm protecting my partner.

451
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,240
There's nothing in these files.
Who is this guy?

452
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,000
Who cares?

453
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,720
Forget Bruce Wayne. I'm onto Batman.

454
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,320
They'll be out any second.
I can't wait to hear the explanation.

455
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,320
What is this affidavit you filed?

456
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,320
Grissom gave you his business?

457
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,280
Mr. Grissom asked me,
as a personal favor...

458
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,640
...to take over all his businesses
until he returns.

459
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,120
That's a big favor.
You two must have been very close.

460
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,640
Did you do time together as children?

461
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,960
Our accountants are looking
into it. The affidavit is legitimate.

462
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,800
I smell fresh ink. You can prove this?

463
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,680
Of course you can.

464
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,880
We have witnesses.
Grissom's signature is legitimate.

465
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,680
It is legitimate.

466
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,480
I saw it. I was there.

467
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,560
I saw it all.

468
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,280
He reached up with his dead hand...

469
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,920
...and signed it in his own blood.

470
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,120
And he did it...with this pen.

471
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,880
Hello, Vinnie. It's your uncle Bingo.

472
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,880
Time to pay the check.

473
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,200
The pen...

474
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,840
...is truly mightier than the sword.

475
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,000
Get down!

476
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,440
Won't this gang war dampen
the city's 200th anniversary?

477
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,360
The festival opens.
The police will stop these gangsters.

478
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,400
What about the theory
that the Batman is a Mob enforcer?

479
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,320
i don't have any comment.

480
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,040
Batman.

481
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,440
Batman.

482
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,160
Can somebody tell me
what kind of a world we live in...

483
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,280
...when a man dressed as a bat...

484
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,520
...gets all my press?

485
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,760
This town needs an enema!

486
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,960
May I have a glass of...water?

487
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,640
I'm relieved that you're home.

488
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,720
Miss Vale telephoned.
She was rather concerned.

489
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,400
I feel there's a certain weight
that lifts when she is here.

490
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,480
Alfred...

491
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,040
...why don't you marry her?

492
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,560
That's not exactly what I had in mind, sir.

493
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,800
I can't go on with that right now.

494
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,800
If not now...

495
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,400
...when?

496
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,680
I don't know.

497
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,400
Jack Napier's still alive.

498
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,040
He's running Grissom's men.
I need any information on him.

499
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,400
Yes, sir.

500
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,320
Thank you.

501
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,920
Alfred....

502
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,720
She is great, isn't she?

503
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,560
Yes.

504
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,160
Knox.
Hi.

505
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,320
Check something out for me.

506
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,120
Find out what's special
about the alley at Pearl and Phillips.

507
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,160
Pearl and Phillips?
Yeah.

508
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,760
You got it.
Okay. Okay, bye.

509
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,240
Mr. Wayne.

510
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,680
So much to do and so little time.

511
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,440
The photos.

512
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,320
Who's that loss?

513
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,680
Knox.

514
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,000
Bad tie. No style.

515
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,560
Stop the press!

516
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,880
Who is that?
Vicki Vale.

517
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,040
The photographer working with Knox.

518
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,280
That girl has style.

519
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,200
Jesus marimba!

520
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,080
A lovely beast like that running around...

521
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,720
...could put steam in a man's strides.

522
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,120
She's dating some guy named Wayne.

523
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,120
She's about to trade up.

524
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,720
It's hard to stay inside the lines.

525
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,160
I'm about...

526
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,680
...to get a new girl, Bobby.

527
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,760
I'm of a mind to make some mooky.

528
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,840
Phone book.

529
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,320
Yes, sir.

530
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,080
So much to do...

531
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,640
...and so little time.

532
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,280
Have you shipped a million of those?

533
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,320
Yes, sir.

534
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,720
Ship them all! We're going
to take them out a whole new door!

535
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,080
Ten seconds to transmission.

536
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,160
Five...four...three...two...one.

537
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,800
Cue music.

538
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,680
Cue Becky.

539
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,000
Good evening. The fashion world
was stunned today...

540
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,840
...by the sudden deaths of models
Candy Walker and Amanda Keeler.

541
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,080
Cause of death has been attributed
to a violent allergic reaction...

542
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,800
...although authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of drug use.

543
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,840
Peter.

544
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,640
Plans continue
for the city's 200th birthday...

545
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,840
...as Mayor Borg announced today,
the unveiling--

546
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,760
This just in.

547
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,800
Three mysterious deaths
at a beauty parlor--

548
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,800
...were discovered today.

549
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,360
What's going on?

550
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,160
This is hardly the....

551
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,080
Kill the camera.

552
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,280
This is Rene on the news floor.
I need paramedics up here now!

553
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,280
New and improved Joker products!

554
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,360
With a new secret ingredient.

555
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,320
Smylex!

556
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,760
What's that?

557
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,280
Let's go over...

558
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,200
...to our blind taste-test.

559
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,960
Love that Joker.

560
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,280
Where's it coming from?

561
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,200
He doesn't look happy.
He's been using brand X.

562
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,920
But with new Joker Brand...

563
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,280
...i get a grin again...

564
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,040
and again.

565
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,240
That luscious tan...

566
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,320
... those ruby lips...

567
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,640
...and hair color so natural,
only your undertaker knows for sure.

568
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,960
You're saying:

569
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,200
"Where can i get these fine, new items?"

570
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,680
That's the gag. Chances are,
you've bought them already!

571
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,280
Love that Joker.

572
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,000
Remember...

573
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,920
...put on a happy face.

574
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,320
The information you requested.

575
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,600
"Jack Napier, assault with
a deadly weapon, age 15.

576
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,200
"Results of psychological profile...

577
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,320
"...violent mood swings, highly intelligent,
emotionally unstable.

578
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,240
"Aptitudes include science,
chemistry, and art."

579
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,680
Chemistry.

580
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,400
Let's go shopping.

581
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,120
Yes, sir.

582
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,280
...six new deaths, with no clues
as to the Joker's deadly weapon.

583
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,400
And what is the pattern?

584
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,560
Foods, alcohol,
or beauty and hygiene products?

585
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,400
Cologne, mouthwash,
underarm deodorant?

586
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,440
Or worse yet, there may be no pattern.

587
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,600
The search goes on
through Gotham's shopping nightmare.

588
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:03,880
We are having a festival, if I have
to use a gun to get people there myself.

589
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,880
Do you hear the words coming from
my mouth? The festival is on!

590
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,120
Find out what this madman
is poisoning us with.

591
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,600
Do you read me?

592
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,160
We're working on it.
I need all the help I can get.

593
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,240
Hi, it's Vicki.

594
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,960
i'll be ten minutes late to the museum.

595
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,200
i'll see you when you get there.

596
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,360
A message from Miss Vale.

597
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,240
She'll be late meeting you at the museum.

598
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,360
Okay, thank you. Wait a minute, Alfred.

599
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,640
I'm not meeting her today.

600
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,800
Jack, where are you going?

601
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,680
Daddy's going to make some art, darling.

602
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,880
Mr. Wayne's table?

603
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,600
He hasn't arrived yet.

604
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,560
We have a table waiting.

605
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,440
Miss Vale, this just arrived for you.

606
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,200
Gentlemen!

607
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,400
Let's broaden our minds. Lawrence.

608
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,240
Give him a shave.

609
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,400
Terence, brush.

610
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,720
"All hail
The new king in town "

611
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,320
"Young and old,
Gather 'round

612
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,120
"Black and white,

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah "

01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,120
The one-dollar bill.

622
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,480
"Somebody holler
if you wanna party"

623
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,200
Hold it!

624
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,680
I kind of like this one. Leave it.

625
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,360
You can take that off now.

626
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,760
You're beautiful...
in an old-fashioned kind of way.

627
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,280
But I'm sure we can make you more...
today.

628
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,240
Your portfolio?

629
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,560
I'm meeting someone
who wants to see my work.

630
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,280
Crap.

631
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,240
Crap. Crap.

632
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,040
Crap. Crap.

633
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,160
Now that's good work.

634
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,040
The skulls, the bodies.

635
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,680
You give it such a glow.
I don't know if it's art, but I like it.

636
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,280
Let me tell you what I'm thinking about.

637
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,400
I was in the bath one day...

638
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,160
...when I realized
why I was destined for greatness.

639
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,720
You know how concerned
people are about appearances.

640
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,560
This is attractive, that is not.

641
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,920
That is all behind me.
I now do what other people only dream.

642
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,080
I make art...until someone dies.

643
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,520
See?

644
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,120
I am the world's first
fully-functioning homicidal artist.

645
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,760
What do you want?

646
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,360
My face on the one-dollar bill.

647
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,880
You're joking.

648
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,720
Do I look like I'm joking?

649
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,480
No.

650
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,960
Listen.

651
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,760
We mustn't compare ourselves
to regular people. We're artists.

652
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,440
For instance, let me challenge you
with a piece I did.

653
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,640
Bob. Alicia.

654
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,840
You will photograph and record my work.

655
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:46,200
You will join me in the avant-garde
of the new aesthetic.

656
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,800
Jack, you said I could watch you
improve the paintings.

657
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,520
I'm in trouble now.

658
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,280
Why is she wearing a mask?

659
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,760
She's just a sketch, really.

660
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,360
Alicia, sit down. Show the lady
why you wear this mask.

661
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,360
Alicia's been made over in line
with my new philosophy.

662
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,120
So now, like me...

663
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,640
...she is a living work of art.

664
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,240
I'm no Picasso, but...do you like it?

665
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,880
It's great.

666
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,560
So...what can I do for you?

667
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,840
A little song, a little dance.

668
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,080
Batman's head on a lance.

669
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,320
What do you know about...?

670
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,160
I don't know anything about Batman.

671
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,520
Really?

672
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,320
Well, how about a little "you and me"?

673
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,080
You're insane.

674
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,440
I thought I was a Pisces. Come on.

675
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,120
Let's make up. Have a little...

676
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,120
...whiff of my posy.

677
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,080
Help me!

678
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,320
I'm melting!

679
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,680
I'm melting! Help me! I'm melting!

680
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,760
Hold on.

681
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,440
Where does he get those wonderful toys?

682
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,640
Get in the car.
Which one?

683
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,160
Let's go.

684
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,960
Shields.

685
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,480
How much do you weigh?

686
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,280
About 108, I think.

687
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,200
Hold on.

688
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,560
Grab that thing on my belt.

689
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,280
Don't let go.

690
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,240
No blood.

691
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,760
Who is this guy?

692
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,280
Check his wallet.

693
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,040
-Wait.
-What is that?

694
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,720
Some kind of body armor.
He's human after all.

695
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,440
Take off the mask.

696
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,480
Shoot her!

697
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,920
Shields open.

698
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,760
You weigh more than 108.

699
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,800
Really?
Let's go.

700
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,600
Stop.

701
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,320
Where are we going?

702
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,080
Be careful.

703
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:18,880
Bats.

704
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,200
They're great survivors.

705
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,320
What is all this?
The police have got it wrong.

706
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,560
They're looking for one product.

707
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,840
The Joker's tainted hundreds
of chemicals at the source.

708
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,640
Then whole shipments
would be poisoned.

709
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,320
And we'd all be dead.

710
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,720
No.

711
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:08,440
The poison only works if the components
are mixed. Hairspray won't do it alone.

712
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:13,000
But hairspray mixed with lipstick and
perfume will be toxic, and traceable.

713
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,720
How did you figure this out?

714
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,440
Take that to the press.

715
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,120
I might have trouble with that.

716
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,160
A lot of people think
you're as dangerous as the Joker.

717
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,040
He's psychotic.

718
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,720
Some people say the same thing
about you.

719
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,320
What people?

720
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,000
Well, let's face it.

721
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,440
You're not exactly normal...are you?

722
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,280
It's not exactly a normal world.

723
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,320
Why did you bring me here?

724
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,720
You could have sent that stuff
to the press yourself.

725
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,760
You're right.

726
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,480
There is something else
you have that I want.

727
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,720
What?

728
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,680
He took the film.

729
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,480
Yeah?

730
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,320
Where have you been? Are you okay?
Should I come over?

731
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,560
No, Allie.

732
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,560
If I bring something to you,
can we make the evening edition?

733
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,640
Just barely. Is it hot?

734
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,840
Yeah, it's real hot.

735
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,000
Yeah, bye.

736
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:48,880
Copy!

737
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,800
Avoid the following combinations:

738
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,240
Deodorants with baby powder,
hairspray, and lipstick.

739
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,880
Safe products are flying in
as Gotham City goes on a forced fast.

740
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,160
And all of Gotham is wondering
what to make of Batman.

741
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,000
Friend or foe?

742
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,760
I have given a name to my pain...

743
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,800
...and it is Batman.

744
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,800
You must possess strength
to inflict pain, Bob.

745
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,600
We've got a flying mouse to kill...

746
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,400
...and I want to clean my claws.

747
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,680
Sir, Miss Vale called again.

748
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,200
Dare i suggest
that your present course of action...

749
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,560
...might simply strengthen her resolve?

750
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,920
She is quite tenacious.

751
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,920
You're right.

752
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:58,360
And quite special.
Perhaps you could try telling her the truth.

753
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,840
Coming.

754
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,480
Hi.

755
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,520
May I come in?

756
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,040
This is a nice apartment.

757
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,160
Lots of space.

758
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,160
Listen, I came over to...

759
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,200
-...clear--
-I don't know who you think you are!

760
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,000
-You hurt me.
-I know.

761
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,760
I called you and called you.
And you lied! You lied about leaving town.

762
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,160
-Let me tell you why.
-Let me tell you!

763
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,720
I thought we felt something.
And I trusted you.

764
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,600
I even slept with you.

765
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,280
Then you wouldn't return my calls.
You must be some kind of jerk.

766
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,120
You're a real nice girl and I like you a lot,
but right now, shut up.

767
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,280
I have something to tell you.

768
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:27,240
You know how people have...
different sides to their personality?

769
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,520
Uh huh.

770
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,440
Sometimes...

771
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:35,080
...a person will have to actually
lead a different life.

772
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,400
Oh, my God, you're married.

773
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,640
No, I'm not married.

774
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,640
You see...

775
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,160
...my life is really...

776
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,480
...complex.

777
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:03,000
All right, listen. You know how
a normal person gets up and...

778
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,280
...goes downstairs...

779
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,280
...and eats breakfast...

780
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,960
...and kisses somebody good-bye,
and goes to...

781
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,840
...a job, and, you know....

782
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,920
No.

783
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:18,920
No.

784
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,880
Look.

785
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,640
What I'm trying to tell you is....

786
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,400
Hey, it's okay.

787
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,120
You can tell me.
Okay.

788
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,200
What I'm trying to tell you is....

789
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I'll be right back.

790
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,320
Miss me?

791
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,840
Nice place you got here. Lots of space.

792
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,600
Vicki, we've really got to talk.

793
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,360
I'm very upset.

794
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,320
We were having dinner.

795
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:18,280
I was a man doing well
with a beautiful woman.

796
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,240
And without so much as an apology...

797
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:25,120
...you ran off with that sideshow phony.

798
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,240
You know...

799
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,200
...I've recently had a tragedy in my life.

800
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,800
Alicia...

801
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,920
...threw herself out a window.

802
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,280
Oh, my God.

803
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,120
But...

804
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,640
...you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

805
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,120
Well, Miss Vale...

806
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,360
...another rooster in the hen-house?

807
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,960
Take thy beak from out my heart.

808
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,120
Bruce....

809
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,040
Bruce...Wayne, n'est-ce pas?

810
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,960
Most of the time.

811
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,120
I know who you are.

812
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,680
Let me tell you
about this guy I know, Jack.

813
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,720
Mean kid. Bad seed. Hurt people.

814
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,960
I like him already.

815
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,360
You know what the problem was?

816
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,560
He got sloppy. You know, crazy.

817
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:56,040
He started to lose it.
He had a head full of bad wiring, I guess.

818
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,640
Couldn't keep it straight up here.

819
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,120
He was the kind of guy who...

820
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,480
...couldn't hear the train
until it was two feet from him.

821
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,360
You know what happened
to this guy, Jack?

822
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,880
Well....

823
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,560
He made mistakes.

824
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,560
Then he ended up with his lights out!
Now you want to get nuts?

825
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,520
Come on! Let's get nuts!

826
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,360
Tell me something.

827
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,240
Have you ever danced
with the devil in the pale moonlight?

828
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,360
What?

829
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,320
I always ask that of all my prey.

830
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,800
I just like the sound of it.

831
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:49,040
Never rub another man's rhubarb.

832
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,440
Why is it, every time I come for you...

833
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,640
...somebody always gets in the way?

834
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,040
I'll need a moment alone.

835
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,320
I'm only laughing on the outside.

836
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,160
My smile is just skin deep.

837
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,000
If you could see inside...

838
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,120
...I'm really crying.

839
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,160
You might join me for a weep.

840
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,400
You really wouldn't believe it.

841
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,160
While you were entertaining, I've
been finding out about your street corner.

842
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,400
I think your friend is screwed up.

843
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,800
More good news.

844
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,160
Oh, my God!

845
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,040
His parents were murdered in that alley.

846
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,680
That's why he went there.

847
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,640
He watched it happen in front of him.

848
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,280
Look at the look on his face.

849
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,680
It was the same at City Hall.

850
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,680
What do you suppose this does to a kid?

851
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,080
Vale....

852
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,080
Don't get personal!

853
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:12,360
Alfred....

854
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,560
Did you get the file on my parents?

855
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,760
It's on your table.

856
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,120
Thank you.

857
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,120
What's on your mind, Alfred?

858
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:32,440
I have no wish
to fill my few remaining years...

859
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,320
...grieving for the loss of old friends...

860
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,920
...or their sons.

861
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:01,160
The 200th anniversary birthday gala...

862
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,240
...has been indefinitely postponed.

863
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,360
We cannot guarantee public safety.

864
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,040
Joker here.

865
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,840
We got interference.

866
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,280
Now you fellows have said
some pretty mean things.

867
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,800
Some of which were true
under that fiend...

868
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,280
...Boss Grissom.

869
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:20,280
He was a thief...and a terrorist.

870
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:24,000
On the other hand,
he had a tremendous singing voice.

871
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,960
He's dead now,
and he's left me in charge.

872
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,400
i can be theatrical...

873
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,120
...and maybe even a little rough.

874
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,880
But one thing i am not...

875
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,640
...is a killer!

876
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,880
i love a good party.

877
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,480
So, truce.

878
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,840
Commence au festival!

879
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,000
And i've got a surprise
for Gotham City.

880
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,920
At midnight, i will dump
20 million in cash...

881
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,680
...on the crowd.

882
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,200
Don't worry about me.
i've got enough.

883
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:11,200
We are not prepared to discuss any deals.

884
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,800
You heard it, folks, 20 million.

885
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,800
And there will be entertainment.

886
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,440
The big dukeroo. With me in one corner,
and in the other corner...

887
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,080
...the man who has brought
real terror to Gotham City...

888
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,920
...Batman.

889
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,040
Can you hear me?

890
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,920
Just the two of us.

891
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,080
Mano y mano.

892
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,360
i have taken off my make-up.

893
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,840
Let's see...

894
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,880
...if you can take off yours.

895
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,880
Tell me, kid.

896
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:58,360
Have you ever danced
with the devil by the pale moonlight?

897
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,320
Let's go!

898
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,760
Let's go, Jack!

899
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,760
See you around.

900
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,120
Am I crazy?

901
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,440
That wasn't just another night
for either of us, was it?

902
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,680
We both got to each other, didn't we?

903
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,600
Why won't you let me in?

904
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,920
Why?

905
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,000
You got in.

906
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,600
I've loved you since I met you.

907
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:21,240
But I don't know what to think of all this.

908
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,960
Sometimes I don't know, either.
It's just something I have to do.

909
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,480
Why?

910
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,800
Because nobody else can.

911
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,920
Look....

912
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,720
I tried to avoid all this, but I can't.

913
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,880
This is how it is.

914
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,280
It's not a perfect world.

915
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,240
It doesn't have to be a perfect world.

916
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:51,240
I just have to know,
are we going to try to love each other?

917
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:55,880
I'd like to.

918
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,160
But he's out there right now.

919
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,400
And I've got to go to work.

920
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,960
into the air, Junior Birdman!

921
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,320
Miss me?

922
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,600
Yeah! Watch me!

923
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,520
Get them. Take the pictures.

924
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:06,840
Gotham's greed.

925
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,000
And now, folks...

926
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,760
...it's time for, "Who Do You Trust?"
Hubba, hubba, hubba!

927
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,400
Money, money! Who do you trust?

928
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,360
Me? i'm giving away free money.

929
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,800
And where...is the Batman?

930
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,040
He's at home, washing his tights.

931
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:04,040
Winged battle flies through
the night and finds me ready.

932
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,200
Bob. Mask.

933
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,880
Masks! Put them on now!

934
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,120
And now...

935
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,000
...comes the part...

936
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,320
...where i relieve you, the little people...

937
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,120
...of the burden...of your failed...

938
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,040
...and useless lives.

939
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:26,120
But, as my plastic surgeon always said,
"if you've got to go...

940
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,280
"...go with a smile. "

941
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,000
My God.

942
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,280
Smylex gas.

943
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,320
He's going to kill everybody!

944
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:06,000
Get in the car. Get in the car!

945
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:15,200
Hurry!

946
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:25,920
Aaa....

947
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,360
My balloons!

948
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,080
They're my balloons!

949
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:42,800
He stole my balloons!

950
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:47,680
Why didn't somebody tell me
he had one of those...things?

951
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,200
Bob. Gun.

952
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,840
I'll need a minute or two alone, boys.

953
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,920
Get out of here!

954
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,520
Come on, you gruesome son of a bitch.
Come to me.

955
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,000
Darling.

956
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,880
I've got to get you
to the church on time.

957
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,320
Yes, sir?

958
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,680
Gotham City Cathedral.
Transportation for two.

959
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,400
Right away, sir?
Five minutes.

960
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,800
Better make it ten.

961
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:17,240
Let's go.

962
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:27,800
Point those searchlights at the tower.
Now! Move!

963
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:01,000
it can be truly said
that i have a bat in my belfry.

964
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,040
Shall we dance?

965
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,640
You know, without you...

966
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,200
...l just wouldn't want to go on.

967
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,920
We were made for each other.

968
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,400
Beauty and the Beast.

969
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:03,760
Of course, if anyone calls you "Beast"...

970
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,240
...I'll rip their lungs out.

971
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:37,120
Mr. Joker?

972
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:43,120
You say such beautiful things.

973
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:47,440
And you're so powerful. And purple!

974
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,400
I love purple!

975
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,000
Excuse me.

976
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:58,400
Have you ever danced with the devil
in the pale moonlight?

977
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,480
I'm going to kill you.

978
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,520
You idiot!

979
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
You made me, remember?

980
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:10,320
You dropped me into the chemicals!

981
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:14,400
That wasn't easy to get over!
And don't think I didn't try.

982
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,840
I know you did.

983
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,040
You killed my parents.

984
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,240
What?

985
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:48,800
What are you saying?

986
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,640
I made you,
but you made me first.

987
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:54,800
I was just a kid.

988
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:57,360
I say you made me, you say I made you.

989
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,640
How childish can you get?

990
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,360
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses on?

991
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:20,040
What are you laughing at?

992
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,680
Let me lend you a hand.

993
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,720
Lend you a hand!

994
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:47,640
They don't make them
like they used to!

995
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,760
Hey, Batsy!

996
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,560
There he is! Down there!

997
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:22,440
It's time to retire.

998
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:26,200
Feel free to drop in.

999
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:37,640
Sometimes I just kill myself!

1000
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:43,880
Hold on!

1001
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:53,680
Our police have rounded up
all of the Joker's men.

1002
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:56,240
The reign of crime is over.

1003
01:54:56,720 --> 01:55:00,080
Public safety in Gotham City is
no longer a laughing matter.

1004
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,960
-Aren't you covering the press conference?
-No.

1005
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,760
What about our Pulitzer Prize?

1006
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,760
What about us?

1007
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:10,720
What about your picture of Batman?

1008
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:19,920
Take care.

1009
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,200
We received a letter from Batman.

1010
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:29,600
"Please inform the citizens of Gotham...

1011
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:32,480
"...that Gotham City's
earned a rest from crime.

1012
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:36,560
"But if the forces of evil should rise again...

1013
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,680
"...to cast a shadow
on the heart of the city...

1014
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,360
"...call me. "

1015
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:44,240
Question. How do we call him?

1016
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:50,960
He gave us a signal.

1017
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:28,080
I thought champagne would
be in order, ma'am.

1018
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:29,720
Hi, Alfred.

1019
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,000
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you...

1020
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,160
...that he might be a little late.

1021
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,960
I'm not a bit surprised.
