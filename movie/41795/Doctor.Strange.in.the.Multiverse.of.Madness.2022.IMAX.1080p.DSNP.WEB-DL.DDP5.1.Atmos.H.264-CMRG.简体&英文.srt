1
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,140
杀死它了吗
Did that kill it?

2
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,060
没有
No.

3
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,980
我们要那样杀它
That's how we kill it.

4
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,150
维山帝之书
The Book of Vishanti!

5
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,120
不能让它夺走你的能力 快去拿书
We can't let it take your power. Get to the book.

6
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
要怎么过去
How do we get across?

7
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,370
跳
Jump.

8
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,710
抓紧
Hold on!

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,040
不…
No, no, no!

10
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,460
它威力太强了
It's too strong.

11
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,250
我撑不住
I can't hold it.

12
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,450
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

13
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,280
这是唯一的办法
This is the only way.

14
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,450
你在做什么
What're you doing?

15
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,540
我不能让那怪物夺走你的能力
I can't let that thing take your power.

16
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,580
你控制不了它
You can't control it.

17
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,130
但我可以
But I can.

18
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,960
我们是朋友
But we're friends.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,420
你会杀死我
You're killing me.

20
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,670
我知道
I know.

21
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,720
但在多重宇宙的庞大计算里
But in the grand calculus of the Multiverse...

22
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,850
你牺牲的价值超过你的…
your sacrifice is worth more than your...

23
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,180
借过
Excuse me. May I?

24
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,350
谢谢
Thanks.

25
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,960

韦斯特医师
Doctor West.

27
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,250
有一阵子没见了
Haven't seen you in a while.

28
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,460
我有五年变成尘埃
Yeah, I was a little preoccupied being dust there for five years, so...

29
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,130
很多人也是
So were a lot of us.

30
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,510
我不在的时候…
While I was gone...

31
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,850
谢谢关心
thank you for asking...

32
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,680
我失去了两只猫
I lost both my cats...

33
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,270
和我弟弟
and my brother.

34
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,980
很遗憾
I'm very sorry.

35
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
谢谢
Thank you.

36
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,950
晚上睡不着时我常在想
I guess what keeps me up at night is wondering...

37
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,710
非得那样惨烈不可吗
did it have to happen that way?

38
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,790
有没有别的路可行
Was there any other path?

39
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,670
没有
No.

40
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,680
我用了仅有的方法
No, I made the only play we had.

41
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,800
那当然
Well, of course you did.

42
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,560
一流外科医师又是最棒的超级英雄
The best surgeon and the best superhero.

43
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,810
但你还是没掳获佳人芳心
But you still didn't get the girl.

44
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,240
麻烦一杯红酒
Glass of red, please.

45
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,410
我来效劳 小姐
Oh, allow me, miss.

46
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,410
太没创意了
Little too on the nose?

47
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,250
你 在我婚礼上
What? For you, at my wedding?

48
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,040
不 我觉得很完美
Nah. I think it was perfect.

49
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,920
恭喜
Congratulations.

50
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,210
谢谢
Thank you.

51
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,210
查理来了
There's Charlie.

52
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,590
介绍你认识 因为他…
I have to introduce you because he's kind of...

53
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,840
有点丢脸 他是铁粉
It's embarrassing, but he's a big fan, so...

54
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,050
克里斯汀
Hey, Christine.

55
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,060
我应该…
I should've...

56
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,100
真希望当初不是那样
I wish I'd have been different.

57
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,230
我始终关心着我们俩
I never stopped caring about us.

58
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,480
但我必须做出牺牲…
But I had to make sacrifices...

59
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,780
才能保护你
to protect you.

60
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,490
对不起
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,990
我们之间根本不可能
It was never gonna work out between us.

62
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,620
为什么
Why not?

63
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,660
因为 史蒂芬
Because, Stephen...

64
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,130
你非得掌控一切不可
you have to be the one holding the knife.

65
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,250
我一向尊重你 却无法因此爱你
And I always respected you for it, but I couldn't love you for it.

66
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,840
这句话你忍了多久
How long you had that one in the barrel?

67
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,310
很久了
Long time.

68
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,390
我想也是
Yeah. I bet.

69
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
听着
Look...

70
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,810
我真的很高兴你找到幸福
Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.

71
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,030
我很幸福
I am.

72
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,280
真的很幸福
I really, really am.

73
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,820
那就好
Good.

74
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,910
你呢
Are you?

75
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,870
我很幸福
I'm happy.

76
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,450
那就好
Good.

77
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,240
你值得幸福
You deserve it.

78
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,880
小心 那是什么
Oh, man. Look out! What is that?

79
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,880
老兄
Dude!

80
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
谢谢
Thank you.

81
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,430
哇
Wow!

82
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,400
不
No, no.

83
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,290
小心
Look out!

84
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

85
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,450
救命啊
Help!

86
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
别客气
You're welcome.

87
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,130
知道向至尊魔法师鞠躬是古老习俗吗
You know it's ancient custom to bow in the presence of the Sorcerer Supreme?

88
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,340
我懂习俗
Yeah, I'm aware of the customs.

89
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,510
撑住
Hold it, hold it!

90
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,370
不可思议
That's incredible.

91
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,790
是啊
Yeah.

92
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,170
天啊
Oh, God!

93
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,810
她是谁
Who's this?

94
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,100
我正想问同样的问题
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

95
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,610
小鬼
Hey, kid.

96
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,110
那只怪兽为什么要追你
What did that creature want with you?

97
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,280
你父母呢
Where're your parents?

98
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,610
我们送她回…
We'll take her back to the...

99
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,070
她拿走我的悬戒
She took my Slingie.

100
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,030
她拿走你的悬戒
She took your Slingie.

101
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,210
太夸张了
Yeah, it was crazy, man.

102
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,920
天啊
Oh, my God!

103
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,290
我不会杀你 小鬼
I'm not gonna kill you, kid.

104
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,880
我拼了命想救你 记得吗
I just bust my ass trying to save your life, remember?

105
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,340
巨兽我能对付
Giant monsters I can clearly handle...

106
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,760
困扰我的是昨晚你出现在我梦里
but what bothers me is that last night, you were in my dream.

107
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,390
那不是梦
That wasn't a dream.

108
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,440
那是另一个宇宙
It was another universe.

109
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,730
你们有多少多重宇宙的经验
How much experience do you guys have with the Multiverse?

110
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,780
我们有多重宇宙的经验
We have experience of the Multiverse.

111
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,030
最近有件事与蜘蛛侠有关
Most recently, there was an incident with Spider-Man.

112
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,450
什么人
What man?

113
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,410
-蜘蛛侠 他有蜘蛛的超能力　-所以叫蜘蛛侠
-Spider-Man. He has the powers of a spider. -Hence the name.

114
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,830
好恶心
Gross.

115
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,990
他长得像蜘蛛吗
Does he look like a spider?

116
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,120
不 比较像人
No. No, more like a man.

117
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,330
爬墙 射蜘蛛网
Climbs walls, shoots webs.

118
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,750
-答对了　-从屁股射吗
-Yeah. Bingo. -Out of his butt?

119
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,170
不是　-不是
-No. -No.

120
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,670
也许吧 我也不知道
Well, maybe, I don't know.

121
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,830
我真心希望不是
Honestly, I hope not.

122
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,040
超诡异
Super weird.

123
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,130
这样吃会肚子痛
You're gonna get a stomach ache.

124
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,840
我来自另一个宇宙
I'm from another universe.

125
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,680
你怎么知道我的肚子跟你一样
How do you know my stomach works the same as yours?

126
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,010
不知道
I don't.

127
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,390
我根本不知道你是否来自另一个宇宙
I don't even know if you're from another universe...

128
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,600
所以我还坐在这里等你开示
which is why I'm still sitting here, waiting for you to enlighten us.

129
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,680
我不得不说
Gotta say,

130
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,060
目前我见过的两个奇异博士
of the two Doctor Stranges I've met so far...

131
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,690
你不是我最喜欢的
you're not my favorite.

132
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,310
什么意思
Which means?

133
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,980
他不懂西班牙语吗
Does he not know Spanish?

134
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,900
我连他爱不爱说英语都不清楚
I'm not sure he even enjoys speaking English.

135
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,490
我离开一场美丽的婚礼
Look, I left a very nice wedding...

136
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,410
去救一个小屁孩 以免她被章鱼吃掉
to save a smart-ass kid from getting eaten by an octopus.

137
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,990
-谁的婚礼　-克里斯汀
-Whose wedding? -Now tell me... Christine's.

138
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,790
-你去了　-靠 你娶了克里斯汀
-You went? -Holy shit, you married Christine?

139
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,790
-能拍照吗　-不能
-Do you mind? -Yes, I do.

140
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,790
我没有 对
No, I didn't. Yes.

141
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,500
你得跟我解释怎么回事
You need to explain to me what's going on.

142
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,750
那只章鱼为什么想吃你
Why was that octopus trying to eat you?

143
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,670
那怪物想绑架我
That thing was trying to kidnap me.

144
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,170
它就像恶魔的爪牙
It's like a henchman who works for a demon.

145
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,010
我们只知道他们想夺走我的能力
All we knew is that they wanted to take my power for themselves.

146
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,350
什么能力
What power?

147
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,390
我能在多重宇宙间旅行
I can travel the Multiverse.

148
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,980
什么
What?

149
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,350
你能在不同宇宙间移动
You can physically move from one universe to another?

150
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,770
怎么做
How?

151
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,650
问题就是我不知道
That's the problem. I don't know how.

152
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,070
我无法控制它
Can't control it.

153
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,230
只有在我非常害怕时才有办法
Only happens when I'm really, really afraid.

154
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,530
我的分身能击败这个恶魔吗
Okay. And did Other Me know how to defeat this demon?

155
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,660
你们知道一本纯良魔法书
Well, you guys knew of this magical book of pure good...

156
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,870
它给魔法师击败敌人所需的指引
that gives a sorcerer whatever they need to defeat their enemy.

157
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,080
维山帝之书
The Book of Vishanti?

158
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,670
那不是真的
It's not real.

159
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,130
那是神话 不存在
It's a fairy tale. It doesn't exist.

160
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,290
其实它存在
Actually, it does.

161
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,920
成为至尊魔法师时拿到的秘笈中有写
I found out in the secret book you get when you become Sorcerer Supreme.

162
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,130
不可思议
Unbelievable.

163
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,590
你不是至尊魔法师
You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?

164
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,510
我不是至尊魔法师
No, I'm not the Sorcerer Supreme.

165
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,390
你的分身是他那个宇宙的至尊魔法师
Other You was Sorcerer Supreme of his universe.

166
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,430
是
Right. Yeah.

167
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,100
虽然它存在
Although it does exist...

168
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,310
维山帝之书据说无法取得
the Book of Vishanti is said to be unreachable.

169
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,940
没错 只是…
It is. Except...

170
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,110
我们取得了
we reached it.

171
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,860
结果那个恶魔追上我们
Then the demon caught up with us.

172
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,700
我以为你会保护我 可是…
I thought you'd protect me...

173
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,450
你没有
but you didn't.

174
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,160
那是我梦中的那场打斗
That was the fight in my dream.

175
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,080
那不是梦
That wasn't a dream.

176
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
证明给我看
Prove it.

177
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,970
那不是梦
It wasn't a dream.

178
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,470
这表示…
That means...

179
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,060
梦是窥探多重宇宙自我的窗口
dreams are windows into the lives of our Multiversal selves.

180
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,900
那是他的理论
That was his theory.

181
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,940
所以我裸体被小丑追的恶梦…
So, that recurring nightmare where I'm running naked from a clown...

182
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,570
在某个地方是真的
Somewhere out there, it's real.

183
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,490
我在那个地方绑马尾
Somewhere out there I had a ponytail.

184
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,160
可能会有更多怪兽来追杀她
There could be more creatures coming for her.

185
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,500
这能力在小鬼手中就够危险了
The power is dangerous enough in the hands of a kid.

186
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,960
要是被真正的威胁取得呢
Imagine if a real threat acquired it?

187
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,050
对了 年轻人 我们不知道你名字
It occurs to me, young one, we don't know your name.

188
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,680
阿美莉卡查维兹
America Chavez.

189
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,050
查小姐 愿意跟我们到卡玛泰姬吗
Miss Chavez, will you come with us to Kamar-Taj?

190
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,430
你在那里会很安全
You'll be safe there.

191
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,310
我怎么知道你不会跟他一样背叛我
How do I know you won't betray me like he did?

192
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,440
我想你只能相信我了
I guess you're just gonna have to trust me.

193
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,730
该拿他怎么办
What do we do with him?

194
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,950
这样违反规定
That's gotta violate an ordinance.

195
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,580
我埋过更糟的
Ah, I've buried worse.

196
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,620
杀死他的怪兽…
The creature that killed him...

197
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,790
有跟那只章鱼一样的记号吗
did it have the same markings as the octopus?

198
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,000
卢恩符文
Runes.

199
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,300
这不是魔法
This isn't sorcery.

200
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,630
是巫术
It's witchcraft.

201
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,640
有谁面对过这种东西吗
Do we know anyone who's faced such a thing?

202
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,970
我可能知道
I think I might.

203
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,350
巧克力
Chocolate!

204
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,980
我说什么
Hey! What did I say?

205
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,190
我们等不及了
But we couldn't wait.

206
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,610
我怎么说的
But what did I say?

207
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,110
去洗手
Go wash your hands.

208
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,910
妈 别这样 我们年纪太大了
Mom, come on. We're too old for that.

209
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,250
好吧
Oh, okay.

210
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,500
你能帮我盖被子 妈
You can tuck me in, Mom.

211
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,330
没问题
I will.

212
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,380
你知道 家人是永远的
You know, a family is forever.

213
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,380
就算想 我们也不可能真的离开彼此
We could never truly leave each other, even if we tried.

214
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,470
妈 我改变心意了
Mom, I changed my mind.

215
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,720
你要的话可以帮我盖被子
You can come tuck me in if you want.

216
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,060
好
Okay.

217
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,270
爱你
Love you.

218
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,640
苹果 对吧
Apples, right?

219
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,220
最后会长出来
Eventually.

220
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,400
-闻起来…　-香甜
-Smells... -Sweet.

221
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,520
我想说真实
I was gonna say real.

222
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,190
千真万确 谢谢
It's all very real, thanks.

223
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,150
我已经不碰魔法了
I've put the magic behind me.

224
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,530
看得出来
So I can see.

225
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,780
我知道你迟早会出现
Well, I knew sooner or later you'd show up...

226
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,950
想讨论西景镇发生的事
wanting to discuss what happened at Westview.

227
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,750
我犯了错 人们受到伤害
I made mistakes, and people were hurt...

228
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,670
但你最后拨乱反正 这点无庸置疑
But you put things right in the end, and that was never in doubt.

229
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,720
我不是来谈西景镇的
I'm not here to talk about Westview.

230
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
那你来做什么
Then what are you here for?

231
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,260
我们需要你帮忙
We need your help.

232
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,310
帮什么忙
With what?

233
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,470
你了解多重宇宙吗
What do you know about the Multiverse?

234
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,270
多重宇宙
The Multiverse.

235
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,440
幻视有他的一套理论
Vis had his theories.

236
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,610
他认为那是真的 而且很危险
He believed it was real, and dangerous.

237
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,270
这两点他都说对了
Well, he was right about both.

238
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,570
我们发现一个能在其中移动的女孩
We found a girl who can somehow travel across it...

239
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,240
但有人在追杀她
but she's being pursued.

240
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,950
-谁　-某种恶魔
-Pursued by who? -Some kind of demon.

241
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,070
觊觎她的能力
One that covets her power for itself.

242
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,500
我们带她去卡玛泰姬 虽然能自卫
We've taken her to Kamar-Taj, and we've got our defenses...

243
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,410
但我们用得上一个复仇者
but we could use an Avenger.

244
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,290
还有其他复仇者
There are other Avengers.

245
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,960
对 在留庞克头的弓箭手
Yeah, but given the choice between the archer with the mohawk...

246
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,250
几个与昆虫同名的打击犯罪高手
and several bug-themed crime fighters...

247
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,340
或是全球最强大的魔法师之间抉择
or one of the most powerful magic-wielders on the planet...

248
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,840
答案显而易见
it's an easy call.

249
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,100
到卡玛泰姬来
Come to Kamar-Taj.

250
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,480
你又能被印在便当盒上了
It'll get you back on the lunch box.

251
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,610
要是你带阿美莉卡过来呢
What if you brought America here?

252
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,690
来这里
Here?

253
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,030
我了解孤单无助
Yeah. I know what it's like to be on your own...

254
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,780
因天生的能力而遭猎杀的滋味
hunted for abilities you never wanted...

255
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,410
我能保护她
and I can protect her.

256
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,750
-你还没说她的名字吧　-没有
-You never told me her name, did you? -No.

257
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,750
我没说
No, I didn't.

258
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,590
咒圈不难应付
You know, the Hex was the easy part.

259
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,300
难的是说谎
The lying, not so much.

260
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,420
黑暗神书
The Darkhold.

261
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,960
你熟悉黑暗神书
You're familiar with the Darkhold?

262
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,960
我知道它是死亡之书
I know it's the Book of the Damned...

263
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,550
接触到它的一切都会堕入邪恶
and that it corrupts everything and everyone that it touches.

264
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,380
不知道它是否影响了你
I wonder what it's done to you.

265
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,930
黑暗神书只让我看到真相
The Darkhold only showed me the truth.

266
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,720
我能再拥有曾经失去的一切
Everything I lost can be mine again.

267
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,430
你想对阿美莉卡怎么样
What do you want with America?

268
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,480
你想如何利用多重宇宙
What do you want with the Multiverse?

269
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,940
我会离开这个现实
I'm going to leave this reality...

270
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,150
到能跟孩子在一起的那个现实
and go to one where I can be with my children.

271
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,610
旺达 你的孩子不是真的
Wanda, your children aren't real.

272
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,820
你用魔法创造了他们
You created them using magic.

273
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,610
每个母亲都是
That's what every mother does.

274
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,160
如果你知道…
If you knew...

275
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,160
有一个宇宙
there was a universe...

276
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,040
你在那里很幸福
where you were happy...

277
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,170
难道你不想去吗
wouldn't you want to go there?

278
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,170
我现在很幸福
I am happy.

279
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,090
我最清楚什么叫自欺欺人
I know better than most what self-deception looks like.

280
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,380
你公然违反所有自然定律
What you're doing is a flagrant violation of every natural law...

281
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,430
如果夺走那孩子的能力 她必死无疑
and if you take that child's power, she won't survive.

282
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,720
我并不乐意伤害人 史蒂芬
I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.

283
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,060
但她不是孩子
But she's not a child.

284
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,390
她是超自然个体
She's a supernatural being.

285
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,440
那么强大的能力足以破坏各个世界
Such raw power could wreak havoc on this and other worlds.

286
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,030
她牺牲小我…
Her sacrifice...

287
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,240
能完成大我
would be for the greater good.

288
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,900
你别想被印在便当盒上了
Well, you can kiss the lunch box goodbye,

289
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,700
那是我们敌人用的借口
'cause that's the kind of justification our enemies use.

290
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,370
那是你的借口吗…
Is it the one you used...

291
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,450
当你给灭霸时间宝石
when you gave Thanos the Time Stone?

292
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,630
那是战争 我是不得已的
That was a war, and I did what I had to do.

293
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,090
你破坏规则 成为英雄
You break the rules and become a hero.

294
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,170
我却变成敌人
I do it, and I become the enemy.

295
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,130
好像不太公平
That doesn't seem fair.

296
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,180
现在要怎样
What happens now?

297
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,930
回到卡玛泰姬
Return to Kamar-Taj...

298
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,230
准备在日落前交出阿美莉卡查维兹
and prepare to hand over America Chavez by sundown.

299
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,560
和平移交
Peacefully.

300
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,980
然后…
After that...

301
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,440
你再也不会见到我
You'll never see me again.

302
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,410
不然呢
And if we don't?

303
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,290
来找她的就不会是旺达
Then it won't be Wanda who comes for her.

304
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,790
而是绯红女巫
It will be the Scarlet Witch.

305
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,930
绯红女巫
The Scarlet Witch.

306
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,730
旺达不见了
Wanda's gone.

307
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,560
她取得黑暗神书 黑暗神书控制了她
She's got the Darkhold, and the Darkhold has her.

308
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,320
绯红女巫拥有深不可测的魔法
The Scarlet Witch is a being of unfathomable magic.

309
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,700
她能随意改写现实
She can rewrite reality as she chooses...

310
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,660
不是将统治宇宙
and is prophesized to either rule...

311
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,830
就是摧毁宇宙
or annihilate the cosmos.

312
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,170
她用意志力控制了整座小镇
She took over a whole town using her mind.

313
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,130
如果获得阿美莉卡的能力
If she gets America's power...

314
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,630
她就能征服多重宇宙
she could enslave the entire Multiverse.

315
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,380
所以你求助的对象
So, the person you went to ask for help...

316
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,760
不但知道我在哪里
and told exactly where I am...

317
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,390
也想杀我
is the person that's trying to kill me?

318
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,850
对
Yeah.

319
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,150
立刻暂停教学 武装学员
Suspend teaching at once and arm the students.

320
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,860
卡玛泰姬必须转为抗敌要塞
Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.

321
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,180
哇
Wow.

322
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,850
是香港和伦敦至圣所的大师
It's the masters of the Hong Kong and London Sanctums.

323
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,110
能再一次跟您并肩拚死 是我的光荣
It's an honor to court death alongside you once again.

324
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,440
也是我们的光荣
The honor is ours.

325
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,530
对于至尊魔法师的要求 使命必达
Whatever the Sorcerer Supreme asks of us, it shall be done.

326
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,700
待命魔法师 跟我来
Extra duty men, follow me.

327
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,910
这是古老习俗
It's ancient custom.

328
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,680
小心说话
Choose your words wisely.

329
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,140
多重宇宙的命运可能因此改变
The fate of the Multiverse may depend on it.

330
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,350
了解
Got it.

331
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,060
不要有压力
No pressure, then.

332
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,290
全是为了一个你昨天认识的孩子
All this for a child you met yesterday.

333
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,290
旺达 你有权利生气
Wanda, you are justifiably angry.

334
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,290
你不得不做出莫大的牺牲
You had to make terrible sacrifices.

335
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,170
我在爱人的头上炸出一个洞
I blew a hole through the head of the man I loved...

336
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,340
结果却毫无意义
and it meant nothing.

337
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,470
不要跟我谈牺牲 史蒂芬斯特兰奇
Do not speak to me of sacrifice, Stephen Strange.

338
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,520
如果你给我我要的
If you give me what I want...

339
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,360
我就送你去能和克里斯汀一起的世界
I'll send you to a world where you can be with Christine.

340
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,240
强大的卡玛泰姬会联合对抗你
The full might of Kamar-Taj stands against you.

341
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,160
就防守位置 准备
Defensive positions, now!

342
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,960
休想进入这些圣地
Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.

343
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,760
你不知道我有多讲理
You have no idea just how reasonable I have been.

344
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,760
对
Yeah.

345
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,590
死亡之书 自称女巫
Book of the Damned, calling yourself a witch,

346
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,970
召唤怪兽绑架少女
conjuring creatures to abduct a kid...

347
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,390
我不觉得那叫讲理
I don't exactly call that being reasonable.

348
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,390
派那些禽兽去追她 算我仁慈
Sending those creatures after her instead of myself was mercy.

349
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,480
尽管你如此虚伪 又羞辱我
And in spite of your hypocrisies, and insults...

350
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,740
我一直求你不要从中作梗
I have begged you to safely get out of my way.

351
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,200
你磨光了我的耐性
You have exhausted my patience...

352
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,790
但我很希望你了解 即使是现在
but I do hope you understand that even now...

353
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,500
即将发生的事
what's about to happen...

354
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,540
这就是我…
this is me...

355
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,380
在讲理
being reasonable.

356
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,640
撑住
Hold!

357
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,890
撑住
Hold!

358
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,820
搞定
Nailed it.

359
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,250
强化防护盾
Reinforce the shield.

360
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,410
强化防护盾
Reinforce the shield!

361
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,420
强化防护盾
Reinforce the shield!

362
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,020
她想干扰他们的想法
She's trying to get in their heads.

363
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,400
魔法师 巩固意志
Sorcerers, fortify your mind!

364
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,540
快跑
Run.

365
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,230
防护盾失效
The shield is down!

366
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,900
发射
Fire!

367
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,570
赞
Yes!

368
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,130
找掩护
Take cover!

369
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,930
任意发射
Fire at will!

370
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,100
撤退
Fall back.

371
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,320
王！
Wong!

372
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,610
快离开
Get out of here!

373
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,570
快走…
Go, go.

374
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,910
快走
Go!

375
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,780
阿美莉卡
America...

376
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,250
想要那个女孩 先过我这一关
You want the girl, you'll have to go through me.

377
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
好
Fine.

378
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,200
我们得马上带你离开
We gotta get you out of here. Now.

379
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,870
王 怎么回事
Wong, what happened?

380
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,620
卡玛泰姬沦陷了
Kamar-Taj has fallen.

381
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,140
反射
Reflections.

382
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,140
她利用反射影像 盖起来
She's using the reflections. Cover them.

383
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,010
你牺牲那些生命
You gave all those lives...

384
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,880
只为了不让我接近我的孩子
just to keep me from my children.

385
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,470
是你杀了那些人
You took those lives.

386
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,510
不能让你进入多重宇宙
You cannot be allowed to cross into the Multiverse.

387
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,720
我不是怪物 史蒂芬
I'm not a monster, Stephen.

388
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,470
我是母亲
I'm a mother.

389
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,440
旺达 你没有孩子
Wanda, you have no children.

390
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,690
他们不存在
They don't exist.

391
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,560
他们存在
Oh, but they do.

392
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,860
在其他每个宇宙里
In every other universe.

393
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,280
我知道他们在
I know they do.

394
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,780
因为我会梦到他们
Because I dream of them...

395
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,410
每天晚上
every night.

396
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,920
我们表演出来
We're gonna show it.

397
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,210
妈 你看我们
Mom, watch us. Mom!

398
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,090
跑远一点 回去…
Go long. Got it! All right, go on back, go on back.

399
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,460
好 不要…
All right, yeah. Don't...

400
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,300
梦到我的宝贝儿子
Of my boys.

401
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,550
比利 你敢！
Billy, don't you dare! No!

402
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,510
梦到我们一起生活
Of our life together.

403
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,800
-这里　-赞
-Here. -Yes!

404
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,180
然后回到前面
And then back to front.

405
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,930
回到前面
Back to front.

406
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
我能吃吗
Can I have some?

407
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
拜托啦
Please?

408
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,020
-你们好了吗　-没关系
-Are you guys ready? -It's okay.

409
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,150
我爱你 妈
I love you, Mom.

410
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,440
每天晚上
Every night...

411
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,230
相同的梦
the same dream.

412
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,530
每天早晨
And every morning...

413
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,620
相同的恶梦
the same nightmare.

414
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,000
要是你找到他们呢
What if you reach them?

415
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,670
另一个你会如何
What happens to the other you?

416
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,130
他们的母亲会怎样
What happens to their mother?

417
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,530
你还好吗
You okay?

418
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,490
你救了我
You saved me.

419
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,790
希望如此
I hope so.

420
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,580
你竟然没吐
Surprised you didn't puke.

421
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,500
这不是我第一趟怪异之旅
It's not my first weird trip, kid.

422
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,460
所以 这是纽约 在多重…
So, this is New York in the Multi...

423
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,510
对
Yep.

424
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,010
来了
There it is.

425
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,810
讨厌
Crap.

426
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,400
别闹了
Cut it out.

427
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,650
对 你伤痕累累
Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.

428
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,400
再帮你修补
We'll get you fixed.

429
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,110
好 阿美莉卡
All right, America.

430
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,990
你得打开一个入口 马上回去
You gotta open a portal and get us back there right now.

431
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,160
我不会
I don't know how.

432
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,450
你刚刚做到了
You just did it.

433
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,540
不是故意的
Not on purpose.

434
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,620
王单独对抗旺达 我是他唯一的希望
Wong is back there alone with Wanda, and I'm the only hope he has.

435
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,420
-我不能控制…　-你一定可以
-I can't control my powers... -You must be able to control it somehow.

436
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,540
就连我都可以…
Even I could...

437
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,510
抱歉
Sorry.

438
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,220
这个宇宙的你呢
Well, what about this universe's version of you?

439
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,090
或许她能控制她的能力
Maybe she could control her powers.

440
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,100
这个宇宙没有我
This universe doesn't have a me.

441
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,930
-什么　-全都没有
-What? -None of them do.

442
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,060
你怎么知道
But how do you know that?

443
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,770
因为我找过了
'Cause I've looked.

444
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,350
我也从来没做过梦
And 'cause I never dream.

445
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,160
没关系 小鬼
That's okay, kid.

446
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,410
就算你带我回去 我也无力对抗旺达
And even if you could get me back there, I have no way of fighting Wanda.

447
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,990
维山帝之书呢
What about The Book of Vishanti?

448
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
怎么样
What about it?

449
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,620
你的分身认为它能阻止追我的东西
Other You thought it could stop whoever was after me.

450
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,960
我的分身真厉害 但他不在这里
Yeah, well, good for Other Me. He's not here, is he?

451
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,920
我不知道它在哪 除非有另一个分身
I don't know where it is, so unless there's another Other Me...

452
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,510
我们得去找…
We need to go find...

453
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,800
我的另一个分身
Other Other Me.

454
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,670
红灯通行
We go on red?

455
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,420
记住多重宇宙旅行的第一个重点
Rule number one of Multiversal travel...

456
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,000
你什么都不懂
you don't know anything.

457
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,670
对
Right.

458
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,260
红灯了
It's red.

459
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,220
第二个重点是什么
So, what's rule number two?

460
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,640
阿美莉卡
America?

461
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,520
阿美莉卡
America!

462
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,570
第二个重点
Rule number two...

463
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,030
找吃的
find food.

464
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,150
最好是披萨 披萨球
Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.

465
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,240
你拿什么付钱
How'd you pay for that?

466
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,370
免费的
It was free.

467
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,780
其实大多数宇宙的食物都免费
Food's free in most universes, actually.

468
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,830
你们竟然得付钱 好怪
It's weird you guys have to pay for it.

469
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,830
-喂 你没付钱　-对
-Hey! You didn't pay for that. -Right.

470
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,120
完蛋
Crap.

471
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,500
或许这里不能吃免钱
Maybe it's not free here.

472
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,630
披萨老爸一定收钱
Pizza Poppa always gets paid.

473
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,750
披萨老爸 放轻松 她只是个孩子
All right, Pizza Poppa, relax. She's just a kid...

474
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,170
-她饿了　-你才放轻松 奇异博士
-She was hungry. -Relax yourself, there, Doctor Strange.

475
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,180
这披风哪来的
Where'd you get this cape from, anyway?

476
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,050
感觉很像真的
That feels authentic.

477
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,970
这不是披风 是斗篷 建议你放开
It's not a cape, it's a cloak, and I suggest you let go.

478
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,520
这套服装从奇异博物馆拿的吧
You took this whole suit from the Strange Museum, didn't you?

479
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,480
-奇异博物馆　-你手脚不干净
-Strange Museum? -You're a taker.

480
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,190
赏你芥末酱
Why don't you take some mustard, huh?

481
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,110
走吧 趁机快溜
Come on. It's not permanent.

482
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,910
他几分钟后就会停止
Like he'll stop in a few minutes?

483
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,330
大约三星期
About three weeks.

484
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,040
我们经过的那些宇宙…
Those universes we went through...

485
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,380
我们在其中一个是油漆吗
were we paint in one of them?

486
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,880
对 最好别困在里面
Yeah, you don't wanna get stuck in there.

487
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,590
要吃东西很难
It's really hard to eat.

488
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,300
你到过几个宇宙
How many universes have you been to?

489
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,800
72个
Seventy-two.

490
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,810
73 加上这个
Seventy-three, counting this one.

491
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,640
很多耶
That's a lot.

好高级的餐厅
This is pretty fancy.

497
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,040
你得再申请一笔学贷吗
Did you have to take out another student loan?

498
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,040
不用 我卖掉上周开刀的一颗肾脏
Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys that we operated on last week.

499
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,550
我要送你一样小礼物
So got you a little something.

500
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,930
恭喜
Congratulations.

501
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,720

What is it?

502

打开来看看
Open it and see.

503
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,020
克里斯汀 这…
Christine, this is...

504
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,980
太棒了 谢谢
This is amazing. Thank you.

505
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,070

Where's this?

510
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,750
我家
Home.

511
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,170
我的两个妈妈
My moms.

512
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,870
她们是我的妈妈
Son mis madres.

513
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,450
阿美莉卡
America!

514
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,310
你说得对 这是浪费时间
You know, you were right. This is just a waste of time.

515
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,520
小鬼
Hey, kid.

516
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,140
那是你第一次打开入口吧
That was the first time that you opened a portal, right?

517
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:10,310
不重要
Doesn't matter.

518
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,020
很重要 你失去了双亲
It does matter. You lost your parents.

519
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,480
我没失去她们 而是杀了她们
I didn't lose them. I killed them.

520
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,570
不 你没有 别这么想
No. No, you did not. Don't even think that.

521
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,490
我用无法控制的能力打开一个入口
Okay, I opened a portal with the powers I can't control...

522
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,530
送她们去一个致命的宇宙
and sent them to a random, probably deadly universe...

523
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,700
-无法逃脱　-听着
-with no way to escape. -Listen...

524
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,290
如果你妈妈跟女儿有一丁点像
if your moms are anything like their daughter...

525
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,620
她们就会活着
they survived.

526
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,580
相信你有一天会再见到她们
I'm sure you'll meet them again someday.

527
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:34,840
说得真好
Not bad.

528
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,550
谢谢
Thanks.

529
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,010
在你记忆银行里的女人
That woman in your memory bank thing...

530
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,470
是克里斯汀吧
that was Christine, right?

531
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,970
对 那是克里斯汀
Yes, that was Christine.

532
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,930
-你怎么认得她　-你的分身
-How do you know her? -From Other You.

533
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,640
他们在一起吗
Were they together?

534
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,270
没有 他们不联络了
No, they didn't talk anymore.

535
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
他搞砸了
He blew it.

536
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,610
当然
Of course.

537
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:56,530
你跟克里斯汀的关系也搞砸了吗
Did you blow it with your Christine?

538
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,900
对 我想是
Yes, I guess I did.

539
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,070
为什么
Why?

540
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,490
说来复杂
Complicated.

541
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,080
比在多重宇宙被女巫追杀还复杂
More complicated than being chased by a witch through the Multiverse?

542
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,200
对 是的
Yes, actually, it is.

543
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,110
（奇异博士奉献生命 击败灭霸）

544
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,950
（向地球最强英雄致上永恒谢意）

545
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,160
「奉献生命 击败灭霸」
"Gave his life defeating Thanos"?

546
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,330
看吧我们不全是坏蛋
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

547
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,460
如果你的分身死了
If Other You's dead...

548
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,420
那谁是至圣所大师
who's Master of the Sanctum?

549
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,390
糟糕
Oh, shit.

550
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,520
-你认识他　-对 莫多
-You know him? -Yeah. Mordo.

551
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,780
他是最早让我进入卡玛泰姬的人
He was actually the first guy who let me into Kamar-Taj.

552
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,820
太好了
Oh, great.

553
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,070
后来他性情大变 誓言追杀我
And then he snapped and dedicated his life to trying to kill me.

554
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,610
噢
Oh.

555
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,030
太好了
Great.

556
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,960
我始终认为这一天会来
I always suspected this day would come.

557
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,120
是吗
You did?

558
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,540
是
Yes.

559
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,170
因为你始终认为这一天会来
Because you always suspected this day would come.

560
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:50,510
我的兄弟
My brother.

561
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:55,850
好
All right.

562
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,230
进来
Come in...

563
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,650
跟我好好聊聊你的宇宙
and tell me everything about your universe.

564
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,620
红灯通行
You go on red.

565
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,410
你也挺令人佩服的
And you're quite formidable too, it seems.

566
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,250
多重宇宙旅人
A Multiversal traveler.

567
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,590
感谢你带奇异博士到安全之地
Well, thank the stars you brought Doctor Strange to safety.

568
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,050
逃离不代表安全
Well, just 'cause we jumped ship doesn't mean we're safe.

569
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,680
我们的旺达有能力召唤恶魔与怪物
Our Wanda has the ability to conjure demons and monsters...

570
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,180
在其他宇宙攻击阿美莉卡
to attack America in other universes.

571
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,810
她有黑暗神书
So she has the Darkhold?

572
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,470
你知道黑暗神书
Oh, you know of the Darkhold?

573
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,270
对 这个宇宙也有黑暗神书
Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold in this universe, too.

574
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,440
我这个至圣所守护着它
I guard it here in this Sanctum.

575
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,520
我们绝不让那危险武器落入敌人手中
We would never risk a weapon that dangerous falling into the wrong hands.

576
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:43,690
没错
Damn right.

577
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,150
如果你的黑暗神书跟我们的相似 恐怕她能做的
But if your Darkhold is anything like ours, I'm afraid she can do far worse...

578
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,870
会比召唤怪物来追你更邪恶
than just summon monsters to come after you here.

579
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,450
什么意思
What do you mean?

580
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,790
书里有一个咒语
There is a spell contained within those pages...

581
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,170
会侵蚀灵魂
corrosive to the soul...

582
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,300
亵渎现实
a desecration of reality itself.

583
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,220
梦行
Dreamwalking.

584
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,430
梦行中的魔法师会将自己的意识
A Dreamwalking sorcerer projects their own consciousness...

585
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,140
从他们的宇宙投射至另一个
from their universe into another...

586
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,060
占有另一个自我的身体
possessing the body of an alternate self.

587
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,110
他们可能操纵邪恶的分身
They may puppeteer this unholy doppelganger

588
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,280
从远方追杀敌人
and pursue their enemies from afar.

589
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,910
这种占有并非现实之间的永久连结
The possession is not a permanent link between realities.

590
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,660
他们在短短的梦行时间里
But in the fleeting time they Dreamwalk...

591
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,710
能对入侵的宇宙造成无法挽回的伤害
they can do irreparable damage to the universe they invade.

592
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,420
所以你面对的或许不是恶魔
So it may not be a demon that you face.

593
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,470
可能是绯红女巫
It may be the Scarlet Witch.

594
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,060
她为何不一开始就用这招
Why didn't she do that to begin with?

595
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,480
当时她还能讲理
Because that was her being reasonable.

596
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,270
你对维山帝之书了解多少
What do you know of The Book of Vishanti?

597
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,980
黑暗神书的反论
The Darkhold's antithesis?

598
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:08,440
它能给魔法师制敌所需的力量
It can give a sorcerer whatever power they need to vanquish their enemy.

599
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,780
我需要你帮我找到它
I need your help to get me to it.

600
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,620
抱歉 史蒂芬
I'm sorry, Stephen.

601
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,880
但我特别希望你了解
But I hope you, of all people, understand...

602
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:27,750
威胁我们现实的人不是旺达麦西莫夫
that it is not Wanda Maximoff who threatens our reality...

603
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,090
而是你们俩
it's the two of you.

604
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,590
-天啊　-茶里加了什么
-Oh, God. -What was in that tea?

605
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:41,190
王八蛋
You son of a bitch.

606
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,990
尼山迪之沙
The Sands of Nisanti.

607
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,950
我只是在做你会做的
I'm only acting as you would.

608
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,830
她来了
She's coming.

609
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:26,940
儿子 该上床睡觉了
Boys, it's time for bed.

610
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,730
我们能再吃一点冰淇淋吗
Can we have a little more ice cream?

611
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,110
-拜托啦　-拜托…
-Please. -Please, please, please!

612
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,610
-再一点点　-别逼妈妈当坏人
-A little more, please! -Hey, don't make Mom out to be the bad guy.

613
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,780
知道谁最棒吗
You know who's the best?

614
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,320
-谁　-2003年的老虎队
-Who? -2003 Tigers.

615
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,490
他们超逊的
They suck.

616
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,450
逊到爆
They're so bad they suck egg.

617
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,290
才怪 他们最棒了
No, they don't. They're the best.

618
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,250
-蠢蛋　-你才蠢
-Doofus. -Doofus 2.

619
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,170
你更蠢
Triple infinity doofus.

620
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:48,630
超级爆炸蠢
Infinity infinity googolplex quadruple doofus.

621
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:52,210
天下第一蠢到爆
Quintuple infinity... Crazy doofus.

622
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,880
宇宙无敌蠢
Googolplex doofus.

623
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,890
（生日）

624
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,270
妈
Mom?

625
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,280
什么事 亲爱的
Yes, sweetheart?

626
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,610
你要去哪里
Where are you going?

627
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,910
丢垃圾
Just to take out the trash.

628
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,700
我们能给你看一样东西吗
Can we show you something?

629
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:08,370
妈 快点
Mom, hurry, come on!

630
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,880
快来 很重要
Come on, it's important.

631
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:10,880
妈
Mom.

632
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,420
你一定喜欢
You'll like it.

633
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,420
来嘛 快点
Come on. Hurry up.

634
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,720
很重要
It's important.

635
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,470
妈 注意听
Okay, so, Mom, listen to this...

636
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,640
我先开始
I'm gonna start it.

637
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
不 我先开始
No, I wanna start it.

638
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,060
-我想先开始　-不 我先开始
-I wanna start it. I want to start! -No, I want to start!

639
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,180
-我先开始　-我先开始
-No! I want to start. -I want to start.

640
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,690
你们一起开始吧
Why don't you both start it...

641
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:33,070
不管是什么东西
whatever it is, together?

642
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,400
-好　-好
-Okay. -Okay.

643
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:36,820
-好了吗　-好了
-You ready? -Yeah.

644
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,700
三、二、一 开始
Three, two, one, go.

645
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,160
我们爱吃冰淇淋
We like ice cream

646
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:46,620
就跟每个小朋友一样
Like every child should

647
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:50,370
如果吃了冰淇淋
And if we get some ice cream

648
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:56,090
我们保证会听话
We promise to be good

649
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:24,870
你没死
You're alive.

650
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,580
对
Yes.

651
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,120
可是很多人死了
But so many others were lost.

652
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,420
放了我
Set me free.

653
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,080
我必须摧毁那本书
I need to destroy the book.

654
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,050
不 不能由你动手
No. It cannot be you.

655
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,510
莎拉 不要…
Sara. No, no!

656
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,200
妈
Mom!

657
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,580
怎么了
What happened?

658
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,250
-什么　-你还好吗
-What? -Are you okay?

659
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,380
比利 汤米
Okay. Billy, Tommy.

660
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
什么
What?

661
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,720
不…
No, no, no.

662
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,870
我需要黑暗神书的咒语
I need the Darkhold's spells.

663
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,500
你是至尊魔法师
You are the Sorcerer Supreme.

664
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,870
把你知道的告诉我
Tell me what you know.

665
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,460
那你得杀了我 女巫
You're gonna have to kill me, witch.

666
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,340
不是杀你
Not you.

667
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,010
杀他们
Them.

668
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,310
旺达 住手
Wanda, stop.

669
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,310
旺达 求求你
Wanda, please!

670
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,360
那本黑暗神书是复本
The Darkhold was a copy!

671
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,320
复本
A copy?

672
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,780
传说有一座山
Legend speaks of a mountain...

673
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,620
你要找的悲咒刻在山壁上
with the wretched spells you seek carved into its walls.

674
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,620
黑暗神书抄写在那里
It's there the Darkhold was transcribed.

675
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,830
万达格山
Mount Wundagore.

676
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:39,170
万达格
Wundagore?

677
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,800
没人成功抵达过
No one has survived the journey.

678
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,890
也许我们会是例外
Perhaps we will be the exception.

679
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,600
喂！
Hey!

680
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,650
喂！
Hey!

681
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,990
这个宇宙烂死了
This universe sucks.

682
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:17,960
斗篷呢
Cloak?

683
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,430
喂
Hey.

684
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,470
喂 白袍哥
Hey, lab coat.

685
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,310
这是什么地方
Where the hell are we?

686
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,690
我不知道你是谁 你想干什么
Look, I don't know who you are, or what you think you're trying to do here...

687
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:41,900
-但这种情况…　-谢谢
-but these situations don't usually... -Thank you.

688
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,650
对无名科学家通常不太妙
...work out well for the nameless scientists, so just...

689
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,450
克里斯汀
Christine?

690
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,370
你好 史蒂芬
Hello, Stephen.

691
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,040
查维兹小姐
Miss Chavez.

692
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,000
回答你的问题
To answer your question...

693
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,630
这是一个高度戒备的研究机构
you are in a highly secure research facility.

694
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:04,920
你们俩 加上你有知觉的斗篷
The two of you, along with your sentient cloak...

695
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:07,050
是来接受监视与检验的
are here for surveillance and testing.

696
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,260
检验
Testing?

697
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,930
对 你们是来自另一个宇宙的访客
Well, yes. You're visitors from another universe.

698
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,640
你们的磁迹可能有辐射
Your magnetic signatures could be radioactive...

699
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,430
你们可能有我们无法治疗的疾病
you may be carrying diseases we just don't have treatments for.

700
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:22,150
因此才用这些漂亮的聚碳酸酯鱼缸
Hence, these amazing polycarbonate fish bowls.

701
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,230
所以我该谢谢你啰
I assume I have you to thank for these then?

702
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:29,990
是 我用尼山迪之沙研发出来的
Yes. I developed those using the Sands of Nisanti.

703
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,450
838史蒂芬的魔法遗迹之一
One of 838 Stephen's magical relics.

704
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:33,570
838史蒂芬
838 Stephen?

705
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,330
那是我的机器人版还是…
Is that some kind of cyborg me, or...

706
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,240
我们宇宙是838
Our universe is 838,

707
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,790
你们宇宙的编号是616
and we've designated yours 616.

708
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,790
你们一定非常了解多重宇宙
You guys sure must know a lot about the Multiverse...

709
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,130
竟有人负责帮各个现实命名
if you got someone going around naming realities.

710
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,300
对
Yes.

711
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,300
就是我
Me.

712
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,380
我是巴克斯特基金会资深研究员
I'm a senior fellow with the Baxter Foundation...

713
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,590
专长是多重宇宙研究
and I specialize in Multiversal research.

714
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,930
你怎么会来这里工作
So, how'd you end up working here?

715
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,060
不管这是哪里
Wherever here is.

716
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,560
我自愿加入
Well, I volunteered.

717
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,520
在你的葬礼上
At your funeral.

718
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,060
谢谢你去参加
Thank you for going.

719
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,780
你们的伤都很像 但不完全一样
Your injuries, they're similar, but they're not identical.

720
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,190
很有意思
It's fascinating.

721
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,450
（98.6%相符）

722
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:20,290
我们在这个宇宙是什么关系
What were we to each other in this universe?

723
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,960
我们一直没搞清楚
We never quite figured that out.

724
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:27,380
是吗
Yeah?

725
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,090
这算是我们的共同点
Well, that's something we got in common.

726
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,140
克里斯汀 你得让我们出去
Christine, you gotta let us out of here.

727
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,600
现在人人深陷危机
Everyone's in real danger.

728
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,810
我知道你不了解我
Look, I know you don't know me...

729
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,940
我也不想
And I don't want to.

730
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,270
在你的宇宙里我是你的谁都不要紧
Whatever I was to you in your universe does not matter.

731
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,610
为什么
Why not?

732
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,320
因为你很危险 史蒂芬
Because you're dangerous, Stephen.

733
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,620
我的宇宙有人要抓那个女孩
Someone from my universe wants that girl...

734
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:03,500
对方会彻底摧毁这个地方
and she's gonna rip this place apart atom-by-atom...

735
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,080
不达目的绝不罢休
until she gets what she wants.

736
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,710
我不管你们来自复仇者联盟或神盾局
So I don't care if you're from the Avengers or S.H.I.E.L.D...

737
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,880
都不是
We're neither.

738
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,010
那是什么
Well, what then?

739
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,180
九头蛇
HYDRA?

740
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:22,430
光照会现在要见你
The Illuminati will see you now.

741
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,810
光照什么会
The Illumi-what-y?

742
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,530
别让人伤害那个小鬼
Don't let anyone hurt that kid.

743
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,240
不会有事的
It's gonna be okay.

744
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:11,360
你不能直接带我们上去吗
You couldn't portal us up there?

745
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,940
我的魔法只能带我们到这里
My magic can only take us so far.

746
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,610
秘术大师不该踏上…
Masters of the Mystic Arts weren't meant to tread...

747
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,160
万达格山禁地
upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore.

748
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:50,100
很久以前 第一个恶魔西索恩
Eons ago, the first demon, Chthon, carved his dark magic...

749
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:52,690
将他的黑暗魔法刻在这座陵墓上
into this tomb.

750
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:57,610
同样的咒语后来抄入黑暗神书
These same spells were later transcribed into the Darkhold.

751
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,550
外人无法得知里面有什么无情怪物
There's no telling what soulless monstrosities lie within.

752
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,970
它们一直在等我
They've been waiting for me.

753
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,020
这不是陵墓
This isn't a tomb.

754
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,770
而是王座
It's a throne.

755
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,520
史蒂芬斯特兰奇
Stephen Strange...

756
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,810
你被召唤到光照会面前
you are now called before the Illuminati.

757
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,730
我卡尔莫多男爵 至尊魔法师特此…
I, Baron Karl Mordo, the Sorcerer Supreme, do hereby...

758
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,030
卡尔
"Karl"?

759
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,870
卡特队长
Captain Carter.

760
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,240
第一位复仇者
The first Avenger.

761
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,040
布拉卡格博特贡
Blackagar Boltagon.

762
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,120
泰瑞根迷雾守护者 异人族国王
Keeper of the Terrigen Mists, the Inhuman king.

763
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,330
布拉卡格伏特加
Blackagar Boltagon?

764
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,040
我西迪威士忌
Hidigy hidithere.

765
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,380
惊奇队长 宇宙捍卫者
Captain Marvel. Defender of the cosmos.

766
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:27,470
以及当前最聪明的人
And the smartest man alive...

767
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,220
神奇四侠的李德理查斯
Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.

768
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:32,430
你好 史蒂芬
Hello, Stephen.

769
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,480
神奇四侠
"Fantastic Four."

770
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,100
你们的歌有上排行榜吗
Didn't you guys chart in the '60s?

771
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,310
抱歉 你觉得这是在搞笑吗
I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

772
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,730
有人头上有叉子
Well, there's a guy over there with a fork on his head...

773
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,270
对 有一点
so, yeah, a little bit.

774
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:44,280
你得感激黑蝠王没在谈话时插嘴
Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't engage you in conversation.

775
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,110
为什么他有口臭吗
Why? Does he have bad breath?

776
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,320
这个斯特兰奇比我们的更嚣张
This Strange is even more arrogant than ours.

777
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,530
不 只是更有活力
No, just more alive.

778
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,830
那是现在
For now.

779
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:57,290
史蒂芬 你来造成现实混乱与失稳
Stephen, your arrival here confuses and destabilizes reality.

780
01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:59,960
你留下的冲击越大
The larger the footprint you leave behind,

781
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,500
对撞事件的风险就越大
the greater the risk of an Incursion.

782
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:02,670
对撞事件
Incursion?

783
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,010
对撞事件就是两个宇宙的界线侵蚀
An Incursion occurs when the boundary between two universes erodes...

784
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,390
两者相撞
and they collide...

785
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:13,180
彻底摧毁其中之一或同归于尽
destroying one or both entirely.

786
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,520
你的分身创立了光照会
Your alternate self created the Illuminati...

787
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,230
要做其他人无法做的困难决定
to make difficult decisions that no one else could.

788
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,110
今天我们要决定如何处置你和那孩子
Today, we're here to determine what to do with you and the child.

789
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,900
在我们投票前
So, before we vote...

790
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,780
如果有认真的话想说 就趁现在
if you got anything serious to say, now's the time.

791
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,240
有
Yeah, I do.

792
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:31,700
如果你们担心对撞事件
If it's Incursions you're worried about...

793
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:34,490
你们真以为我的威胁比绯红女巫大
do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat than the Scarlet Witch?

794
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:37,710
如果小女巫决定梦行 我们能对付她
Oh, we can handle your little witch if she decides to Dreamwalk.

795
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:41,170
你们没办法 除非给我维山帝之书
No. No, you cannot. Not unless you give me The Book of Vishanti.

796
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,170
多谢关心 史蒂芬
We appreciate your concern, Stephen,

797
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,050
但我们担心的不是绯红女巫
but it's not the Scarlet Witch that we fear.

798
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:48,930
根据经验 多重宇宙最大的危险是…
From our experience, the greatest danger to the Multiverse, it turns out...

799
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:50,720
奇异博士
is Doctor Strange.

800
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,560
等等 你们的奇异博士
Wait. Your Doctor Strange?

801
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,350
击败灭霸而死的地球最强英雄
Earth's mightiest hero who died defeating Thanos?

802
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,230
我们应该告诉他真相
We should tell him the truth.

803
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,530
我们最后一位成员
Our final member...

804
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,610
查尔斯泽维尔教授
Professor Charles Xavier.

805
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:13,490
什么真相
What truth?

806
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,250
我们的斯特兰奇不是那么死的
That's not how our Strange died.

807
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,010
你在想现在会怎么样
You're wondering what happens now.

808
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,060
不是
No.

809
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,850
我已经接受了
That I've already accepted.

810
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,730
我真正想知道的是
But I do wonder...

811
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,780
你能逼阿美莉卡送你去任何宇宙
when you could force America to send you to any universe you want...

812
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:48,690
为何还要把她的能力占有己有
why take her power for your own?

813
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,610
你明知那样会害死她
You know it would kill her.

814
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,610
为了保护比利和汤米
For Billy and Tommy, to protect them.

815
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,160
要是他们生病呢
What if they get sick?

816
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,370
在无限的多重宇宙 每种病都有解药
In the infinite Multiverse, there's a cure for every illness.

817
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:04,000
每个问题都有解决办法
A solution to every problem.

818
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,260
我不愿再失去他们
I won't lose them again.

819
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,510
尽管尝试 但你控制不了一切
Try as you might, Wanda, you cannot control everything.

820
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,220
我可以
But I can.

821
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:15,010
看看你四周
Look around you.

822
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,890
它就刻在石头上
It's carved in stone.

823
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,310
我原本就该统治一切
I was meant to rule everything.

824
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,030
但那不是我要的
But that's not what I want.

825
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:30,860
我只要我的宝贝儿子
I just want my boys.

826
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,070
牺牲掉一个孩子的命
At the cost of a child's life?

827
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,200
即使不能和心爱的人在一起
Is there no peace in knowing that even though you can't be with the ones you love...

828
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,580
你们还是在某些世界里相聚
there are worlds where you are together?

829
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:41,750
那样还不够吗
Is that not enough?

830
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,790
不够
No.

831
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:24,080
我们的斯特兰奇并未因击败灭霸而死
Our Strange did not die defeating Thanos.

832
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:26,420
当时我们在作战
We were at war.

833
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,300
其他人团结起来阻止灭霸
While the rest of us banded together to try to stop Thanos...

834
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:34,420
史蒂芬却一如往常选择单独行动
Stephen, as always, chose to go it alone.

835
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:36,300
他求助于黑暗神书
He turned to the Darkhold...

836
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,050
开始梦行
began Dreamwalking...

837
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,760
希望答案就在多重宇宙里
in hopes that our salvation might lie in the Multiverse.

838
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,350
结果你猜怎么样
And guess what?

839
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,100
并没有 但他仍一意孤行
It didn't. But he kept doing it anyway.

840
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:47,190
一天晚上你召集我们
One night, you called us all together...

841
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,400
坦承你一直在梦行
confessed that you had been Dreamwalking...

842
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:52,860
你说的是「情况已经失控」
and in your words, "Things had gotten out of hand."

843
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:55,240
你从未告诉我们详细经过
You never told us the details of what had happened...

844
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,570
只有你不慎引发对撞事件
only that you had inadvertently triggered an Incursion.

845
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:04,450
朋友 你造成另一个宇宙毁灭
You, our friend, had caused the annihilation of another universe.

846
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,250
那个现实中的每个人都死了
Everyone in that reality died.

847
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,420
每一个人
Everyone.

848
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,750
史蒂芬否认黑暗神书的邪恶
Stephen renounced the Darkhold's evil...

849
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,050
帮助我们找到维山帝之书
and helped us find The Book of Vishanti...

850
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:17,340
我们共同把它当武器 击败灭霸
a weapon we did use together to defeat Thanos.

851
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,680
但还剩一个最终的威胁
But one final threat remained.

852
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:50,130
我会怀念你的 朋友
I shall miss you, my friend.

853
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,380
我准备好了
I'm ready.

854
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:05,680
对不起
I'm sorry.

855
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,960
你们告诉克里斯汀了吗
Did you tell Christine?

856
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:31,290
有
Yes.

857
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,880
那尊雕像…
The statue...

858
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,510
那尊雕像呢
What about the statue?

859
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:43,760
你们立了一尊雕像
You built a statue.

860
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,560
世界需要英雄
The world needs heroes.

861
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,430
我们做出困难的决定
We made the difficult choice

862
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,480
因为我们知道斯特兰奇的能耐
because we knew what our Strange was capable of.

863
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:55,230
或许是每个奇异博士的能耐
What, perhaps, every Doctor Strange is capable of.

864
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,360
大楼遭人闯入
The building's been breached.

865
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,990

回来
Get back!

869
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,050
停在原地
Stop where you are...

870
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,420
她要去找那孩子
She's heading for the child.

871
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,380
看好他 我们回来再投票
Watch him. We'll vote on our return.

872
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:24,930
史蒂芬 要是你逃离这房间
Stephen, should you manage to escape this chamber...

873
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,100
一定要引导阿美莉卡查维兹
you must guide America Chavez.

874
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,600
你在说什么东西
What the hell are you saying?

875
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:31,060
救那个女孩 去找维山帝之书
Save the girl and get to The Book of Vishanti.

876
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,600
那本书在这里

877
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:35,020
对 你建立了一个中继点
Yes. You built a waypoint.

878
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:37,360
查尔斯 我们不能相信他
Charles, we cannot trust him.

879
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,480
我想可以
I believe we can.

880
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,700
有人一时迷途
Just because someone stumbles and loses their way...

881
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,700
不代表他们会永远迷失
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

882
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:49,160
我们看看你是哪种奇异博士
We will see what kind of Doctor Strange you are.

883
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,100
谢谢
Thank you.

884

01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,960
-入侵者接近　-快点
-Intruder approaching. -Now!

889
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,380
是旺达
It's Wanda.

890
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,180

892
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:24,070
奥创命令你…

893
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:26,740
（压力密封解除）

894
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,740
快点…她来了
Hurry, hurry! She's coming!

895
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,460
糟了
Oh, no.

896
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,190
旺达 住手
Wanda, stop.

897
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,440
你掌控了一个无辜女人
You've possessed an innocent woman,

898
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,820
但还是能悬崖勒马
but you can still do the right thing.

899
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:02,900
放了她
Let her go.

900
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,070
求求你
Please.

901
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,780
我自己有小孩 能体会你的痛苦
I have children of my own. I understand your pain.

902
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,290
他们的母亲还活着吗
Is their mother still alive?

903
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,500
是
Yes.

904
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:16,670
很好
Good.

905
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:19,880
会有人留下来抚养他们
There will be someone left to raise them.

906
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,510
旺达 黑蝠王嘴巴张开就能摧毁你
Wanda, Black Bolt could destroy you with one whisper from his mouth.

907
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:29,430
什么嘴巴
What mouth?

908
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,650
带我去找维山帝之书
Take me to The Book of Vishanti,

909
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,610
我们一起对抗她
so that we can fight her together.

910
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,740
你没资格发号施令
You are in no position to give orders.

911
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,080
等他们回来 我这一票将终结程序
My vote will conclude these proceedings when they return.

912
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,680
你还没受够吗
Haven't you had enough?

913
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,260
我可以陪你玩一整天
Oh, I could do this all day.

914
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:32,260
滚出我的宇宙
Get the hell out of my universe!

915
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,840
他们不会回来了
They're not coming back.

916
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,220
你刚刚表明要杀死你朋友
And you just cast your vote now to kill your friends.

917
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:16,720
那以前也没为你带来困扰
Not that that ever bothered you before.

918
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:22,060
在我的宇宙 你恨我
You know, you hated me where I came from.

919
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:25,150
我敢说你在这里也偷偷恨我 兄弟
And I bet secretly, my brother, you hated me here.

920
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:27,270
你一定嫉妒死了
You must've been so jealous.

921
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,690
知道吗
Do you know what?

922
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,900
听到我如此堕落 你一定乐坏了
I bet you were thrilled when you heard I'd been corrupted.

923
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,900
你大概一开始就给了我黑暗神书
Hell, you probably gave me the Darkhold to begin with...

924
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,820
你完全不了解这个宇宙
You know nothing of this universe!

925
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:38,620
你杀死史蒂芬斯特兰奇才能掌控至圣所
I know that killing Stephen Strange was your ticket to getting the Sanctum...

926
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,240
成为至尊魔法师
to becoming Sorcerer Supreme...

927
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:43,080
加入你那个小丑马戏团 光照会
and to joining your little circus of clowns, the Illuminati.

928
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:44,710
我准备好…
I'm ready...

929
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:50,670
投下我这一票了
to cast my vote now.

930
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,700
我想我开始懂了
I think I'm beginning to understand...

931
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:01,830
你的莫多为何不太喜欢你
why your Mordo didn't like you very much!

932
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,250
你被封死了
You're sealed shut!

933
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,840
后退
Okay. Get back.

934
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,100
哇
Whoa.

935
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,150
哇
Whoa.

936
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,860
够了
Enough!

937
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:32,960
拜托救救我
Help me. Please.

938
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:36,960
旺达麦西莫夫 你的意志被分身挟持
Wanda Maximoff, your mind is being held hostage by your alternate self.

939
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:41,760
抓住我的手
Grab my hand.

940
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:45,010
或许 如果我把你从瓦砾中拉出来
Perhaps, if I can pull you from under the rubble...

941
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:46,680
咒语就会破除
the spell will break.

942
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,480
你们还好吗
Hey! You all right?

943
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:37,940
没事吧
You okay?

944
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,400

948
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,740
-谢谢　-别客气
-Thank you. -Yeah.

949
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,870
泽维尔说我建了维山帝之书的中继点
Xavier said I built a waypoint to The Book of Vishanti.

950
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,910
你能带我们去吗
Can you take us there?

951
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,080
我怎么能相信你
How am I supposed to trust you?

952
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,290
我知道怎么回事 很遗憾他那么做
I know what happened, and I'm sorry for what he did...

953
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,550
相信我 维山帝之书是唯一的办法
but believe me, The Book of Vishanti is the only way.

954
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:00,710
对 你的办法
Yeah. Your way.

955
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,050
你口气很像我的史蒂芬
You sound a lot like my Stephen right now.

956
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:06,930
他非掌控大局不可 结果害死一万亿人
He had to be the one holding the knife, and then that knife killed a trillion people.

957
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:08,760
这个史蒂芬不一样
This Stephen is different.

958
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,600
真的
He is.

959
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,560
其他的史蒂芬都不重要
It doesn't matter about all the other Stephens.

960
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:15,310
你跟他们不同
You're not like them.

961
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,400
聪明的小鬼
Smart kid.

962
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:25,950
手伸出来
Give me your hand.

963
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:32,410
别让我后悔
Do not make me regret this.

964
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:33,660
不会的
I won't.

965
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,920
-可以走了吗　-跟我来
-Okay, can we go now? -Yeah, follow me.

966
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:52,470
这条隧道通往哪里
Where's that tunnel go?

967
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,180
河底
Under the river.

968
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:03,360
快走…
Go, go, go!

969
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:50,530
（警告 防爆门）

970
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,840
她去哪里
Where did she go?

971
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,020
我警告过你
I warned you.

972
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,320
旺达分身 如果你在里面
Other Wanda, if you're in there...

973
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,530
憋住气
hold your breath.

974
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,200
-她死了吗　-没有 争取时间而已
-Did you kill her? -No, just bought us some time.

975
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,540
维山帝之书在里面
The Book's through here.

976
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:42,960
只有史蒂芬打开过
But only Stephen's ever opened it.

977
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,510
可恶
Shit.

978
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:57,970
专属我的魔法 只有我知道
An enchantment that's specific to me, something only I would know.

979
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,890
-等等 史蒂芬　-快想
-Wait. Stephen. -Come on.

980
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,640
快点
Come on.

981
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:04,310
史蒂芬
Stephen.

982
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:13,700
对
Yeah.

983
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,660
谢谢
Thank you.

984
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:19,750
不客气
Sure.

985
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:26,540
芝麻开门
Open sesame.

986
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,240
下来 小鬼
Come on, kid.

987
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,080
你可以
You got this.

988
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,120
我们可以
We got this.

989
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,590
对
Yeah.

990
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,640
没事吧
You all right?

991
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:18,930
没事
Yeah.

992
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:24,520
这是裂隙接点 宇宙之间的空间
This is the Gap Junction, the space between universes.

993
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,200
好 维山帝之书
All right, Book.

994
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:43,870
给我我需要的
Give me what I need.

995
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,430
-不　-不
-No! -No!

996
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,150
我的儿子
My boys.

997
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:11,380
这不是你孩子要的
This isn't what your children would want.

998
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,930
他们永远不会知道
They'll never know.

999
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,190
或许不会
Maybe not.

1000
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:31,770
但你会
But you will.

1001
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:36,980
不会吧
Oh, no.

1002
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,490
惨了
Oh, crap.

1003
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,870
这个现实好像自己瓦解
It's like this reality collapsed in on itself.

1004
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,120
对
Yeah.

1005
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:46,330
或两个现实相撞
Or two realities collided.

1006
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:48,620
快走
Come on.

1007
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:50,790
阿美莉卡时间不多了
America doesn't have long.

1008
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:52,500
那我们要去哪
So where are we going?

1009
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:55,960
如果这宇宙还有一个至圣所
Well, if there's still a sanctum in this universe...

1010
01:26:57,090 --> 01:27:00,630
那可能有另一个我的分身的分身
then there might be another Other Other Me...

1011
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,300
那是我们救她回来的最佳机会
and that's our best shot of getting back to her.

1012
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:19,110
我明白你们为何这么担心对撞事件
Well, I can see why you guys were so worried about Incursions.

1013
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,650
不管发生过什么事
Whatever happened...

1014
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:27,200
这个宇宙的你并未尽力阻止它
this universe's you didn't do a very good job of stopping it.

1015
01:27:37,630 --> 01:27:39,510
我会告诉他你这么说
I'll tell him you said that.

1016
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:41,070
有人吗
Hello?

1017
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:50,160
站住别动
Stop where you are.

1018
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,580
你怎么来的
How did you get here?

1019
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,670
歪打正着
By accident.

1020
01:28:58,670 --> 01:28:59,670
你是谁
Who are you?

1021
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:01,670
你是什么
What are you?

1022
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,920
我是我们之一
I'm just one of us.

1023
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,590
来自多重宇宙
From the Multiverse?

1024
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,970
没错
That's right.

1025
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,760
提出证明
Prove it.

1026
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:14,520
我们有个妹妹
We had a sister.

1027
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,060
唐娜
Donna.

1028
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:19,940
可是她…
But she...

1029
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,480
小时候就死了
She died when we were kids.

1030
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,650
怎么死的
How?

1031
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:33,830
我们在结冰的湖上玩耍
We were playing on a frozen lake and...

1032
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,830
她掉进湖里
she fell through the ice.

1033
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:48,010
我没办法救她
I couldn't save her.

1034
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,890
听起来没错
Sounds about right.

1035
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,020
但我们不谈那件事 对吧
But we don't talk about that, do we?

1036
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,520
对 不谈
No, we don't.

1037
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:03,770
我想你的现实并非一直如此
Suppose your reality wasn't always like this.

1038
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,400
我猜本来跟你的一样 直到…
I suspect it was somewhat like yours until...

1039
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:07,570
直到
Until?

1040
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:10,950
直到我迷失
Until I lost.

1041
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:13,990
因为谁
To whom?

1042
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:18,870
你想怎么样
What do you want?

1043
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,130
我想回家
I just want to get home.

1044
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:23,840
相信我
Yeah? Believe me...

1045
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,920
长久以来我一直想离开这里
I've been trying to leave this place for a long time.

1046
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,420
黑暗神书
Darkhold.

1047
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,340
你在这个宇宙里守护黑暗神书
You guard the Darkhold in this universe?

1048
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,550
对
Yeah.

1049
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,220
有充分的理由
For good reason.

1050
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:36,390
这是个开始
That's a start.

1051
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,600
我能利用它 帮我跟我的宇宙沟通
I could use it. It could help me to communicate with my universe.

1052
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:40,940
小心
Careful.

1053
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:44,360
黑暗神书会造成严重伤亡
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1054
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,440
不是我无情
I don't mean to be callous...

1055
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:50,490
还能有多严重的伤亡呢
but how much of a heavier toll is there left to exact?

1056
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:52,820
不只是对它的现实
Not just on its reality.

1057
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,450
还有对它的读者
On its reader.

1058
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,410
很遗憾你救不了你的宇宙
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't save your universe...

1059
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:00,120
或许你能帮忙救我的
but maybe you could help to save mine.

1060
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:05,090
你幸福吗 史蒂芬
Are you happy, Stephen?

1061
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,090
什么
What?

1062
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:12,340
你幸福吗 史蒂芬
Are you happy, Stephen?

1063
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,600
这个问题是…
It's the question that...

1064
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,770
克里斯汀帕尔默
Christine Palmer...

1065
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,230
在她婚礼上问我的
asked me at her wedding.

1066
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,730
我说我当然很幸福
I said, "Yes, of course I'm happy.

1067
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,190
我是力量强大的魔法师
"I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods.

1068
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:32,990
怎么会不幸福
What man wouldn't be happy?"

1069
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:38,910
然后我回到这间该死的鬼屋
And then I came back to this goddamn haunted house...

1070
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,500
坐下来
sat down...

1071
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,370
想着我为何说谎
and wondered why I'd lied.

1072
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,420
我根本无意让这一切发生
I never meant for any of this to happen.

1073
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:54,260
我在寻找一个不同的世界
I was looking for a world where things were different.

1074
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:59,930
在那里我有克里斯汀 我很幸福
Where I had Christine, where I was happy.

1075
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:03,520
但我没找到
But I didn't find it.

1076
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,310
只发现更多的我们
All I found were more of us.

1077
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:11,650
于是我帮那些史蒂芬一个忙
So I did those Stephens a favor.

1078
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,910
你是否做过那个坠落的梦
You ever had that dream where you're falling...

1079
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:19,790
彷佛你被推下高楼
as if you've been pushed off a tall building?

1080
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:24,620
那应该是我
That was probably me.

1081
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:35,720
黑暗神书会造成严重伤亡
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1082
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,340
好
Okay.

1083
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:40,850
这样更有理由别用它 交给我
All the more reason to give it a rest and let me have it.

1084
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:42,430
不如这样吧
Here's the deal.

1085
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,400
我让你用黑暗神书 你给我克里斯汀
I'll let you use the Darkhold if you give me your Christine.

1086
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:49,440
唉
Yeah.

1087
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:51,610
我想她不会同意
I don't think she's gonna go for that.

1088
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:52,780
是吗
No?

1089
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:55,240
我也觉得不会
Didn't think so.

1090
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,490
等着 我们来了
Hang on, we're coming.

1091
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,910
你要怎么用黑暗神书
What are you doing with the Darkhold?

1092
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,960
你要梦行吗
Are you going to Dreamwalk?

1093
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:39,380
比梦行再多一点
It's a little bit more than just Dreamwalking.

1094
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:41,840
你们斯特兰奇都一样
All you Stranges, you're the same.

1095
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:43,050
我知道
I know.

1096
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:46,220
你说得对
You're right.

1097
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:48,390
我们都一样
We are all the same.

1098
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:50,850
但现在那孩子需要我
But right now, that kid needs me.

1099
01:36:51,010 --> 01:36:54,690
没有你帮忙我绝对做不到
And I can't do any of this without your help.

1100
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:58,110
我在梦行时 请你保护我的身体
While I'm under, I need you to protect my body...

1101
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:00,270
以免他们因为我擅闯而攻击我
in case they attack me for trespassing.

1102
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:01,780
他们是谁
Who's "they"?

1103
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,740
地狱亡者的灵魂
The souls of the damned.

1104
01:37:27,970 --> 01:37:28,970
好
Okay.

1105
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:33,140
不是有一个你必须住在那个宇宙
But doesn't a version of you need to live in that universe...

1106
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:35,100
你才能梦行进去吗
so that you can Dreamwalk into them?

1107
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:38,600
谁说他们必须是活的
Who said they had to be living?

1108
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:54,220
史蒂芬斯特兰奇
Stephen Strange...

1109
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:57,100
占有亡者遗体是禁忌
possessing a dead body is forbidden.

1110
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:58,890
禁忌
Forbidden.

1111
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,480
擅闯者
Trespasser!

1112
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:02,100
擅闯者
Trespasser!

1113
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:07,730
停止梦行 否则就面对永恒的后果
Cease your Dreamwalk, or face the eternal consequences.

1114
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:17,790
史蒂芬
Stephen!

1115
01:39:18,450 --> 01:39:20,290
他们要把我拉下去
They're pulling me down.

1116
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:23,000
史蒂芬
Stephen!

1117
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,220
撑下去…
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1118
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:34,010
你在哪里
Where are you?

1119
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:02,620
波歌利亚火盆
The Brazier of Bom'Galiath.

1120
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,340
滚回地狱去吧
Go back to hell.

1121
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,070
史蒂芬
Stephen.

1122
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:30,860
我在这里
I've got you.

1123
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:34,450
你是秘术大师
You're a Master of the Mystic Arts.

1124
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:36,370
他们是幽魂
They're spirits.

1125
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:37,450
利用他们
Use them.

1126
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:43,790
利用他们
Use them.

1127
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:47,210
利用他们
Use them.

1128
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:05,190
不！
No!

1129
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:00,030
来啊
Come on!

1130
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,320
斯特兰奇
Strange!

1131
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:47,500
竟然梦行 你这个伪君子
Dreamwalking. You hypocrite!

1132
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:56,130
这次想要杀了我
This time, it's gonna take more than killing me...

1133
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:57,550
不能只杀了这个
to kill me.

1134
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:08,430
杀人凶手…
Murderer! Murderer!

1135
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:22,910
我根本不想知道
I don't even wanna know.

1136
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,260
不！
No!

1137
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:39,420
-不　-不
-No! -No!

1138
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:41,380
她挣脱了
She's breaking free!

1139
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:42,890
困住她
Hold her!

1140
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:45,470
斯特兰奇 利用阿美莉卡的力量
Strange, take America's power!

1141
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:53,020
没别的办法了
There's no other way.

1142
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:54,980
对
Yeah.

1143
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:56,770
这是唯一的办法
This is the only way.

1144
01:44:09,870 --> 01:44:12,500
是我 在我分身的身体里
It's me in Other Me's body.

1145
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:19,250
你是来夺走我的能力吧
You're here to take my power, aren't you?

1146
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:21,760
抢在旺达之前
Before Wanda can.

1147
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:24,800
没关系
It's okay.

1148
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,140
我现在懂了
I understand now.

1149
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:34,140
不 阿美莉卡
No, America.

1150
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:37,310
我是来告诉你要相信自己
I've come here to tell you to trust yourself.

1151
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,070
相信你的能力
Trust your power.

1152
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:41,240
我们就要这样阻止她
That's how we stop her.

1153
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:43,400
我无法控制它
I can't control it. I...

1154
01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:45,570
可以 你可以
Yes, you can.

1155
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:47,200
你始终都可以
You have been all along.

1156
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,290
每次你打开入口
Every time you opened a portal,

1157
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,660
就送我们到该去的地点
you sent us exactly where we needed to go.

1158
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,120
那第一次怎么说
What about the first time?

1159
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:58,790
那也带领你到现在这一刻
Even that led you to this moment...

1160
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:03,420
你即将痛宰那个女巫
when you're gonna kick that witch's ass.

1161
01:45:25,990 --> 01:45:27,070
我帮你
I've got you.

1162
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,540
我击败不了你
I can't beat you.

1163
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:22,090
那就给你想要的
So I'll give you what you want.

1164
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:38,480
比利 汤米
Billy. Tommy.

1165
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:41,230
妈咪 是女巫
Mommy! It's the witch!

1166
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:42,860
你做了什么
What have you done?

1167
01:46:43,110 --> 01:46:44,110
-妈　-妈咪
-Mom! -Mommy!

1168
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:45,320
等等 儿子
Wait! Boys!

1169
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:46,900
没事…
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1170
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:48,200
我是你们妈妈
I'm your mother!

1171
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:52,200
不准靠近他们
Get away from them.

1172
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:54,790
妈
Mom!

1173
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,500
不
No.

1174
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:57,620
还没
Not yet.

1175
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,330
妈咪
Mommy!

1176
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,670
别碰我们妈妈
Get away from our mom!

1177
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:01,920
-你不是我们的真妈妈　-住手
-You're not our real mom! -Hey, boys. Stop.

1178
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,960
-拜托…　-滚出我们家
-Please. Please. -Get out of our house!

1179
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:04,960
儿子 住手
Boys, stop it.

1180
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:06,630
你不是我们妈妈　-出去
-You're not our mom! -Get out!

1181
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:07,880
-走开　-快走
-Go away! -Go!

1182
01:47:08,050 --> 01:47:09,470
住手
Stop it!

1183
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:19,770
拜托别伤害我们
Please don't hurt us.

1184
01:47:20,140 --> 01:47:21,190
求求你
Please.

1185
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:23,940
我绝对不会伤害你们
I would never hurt you.

1186
01:47:24,110 --> 01:47:25,110
绝对不会
Never.

1187
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:29,070
我绝对不会伤害任何人
I would never hurt anyone.

1188
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:30,900
我不是怪物
I'm not a monster.

1189
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:32,360
我是…
I'm a...

1190
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,290
我是…
I'm...

1191
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:46,420
对不起
I'm sorry.

1192
01:47:54,430 --> 01:47:55,510
妈
Mom!

1193
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,310
-你还好吗　-嗨
-Are you okay? -Hi.

1194
01:47:58,270 --> 01:47:59,600
嗨 没事
Hi. Okay.

1195
01:47:59,770 --> 01:48:00,770
我没事
I'm okay.

1196
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:04,270
我没事
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1197
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,990
-妈 不要去　-妈 不要
-Mom, don't go. Don't go. -No, Mom. Don't.

1198
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,120
-没关系　-妈
-It's okay. -Mom.

1199
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:21,080
没关系
It's okay. It's okay.

1200
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,290
有人会爱他们的
Know that they'll be loved.

1201
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:46,290
现在呢
What now?

1202
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:47,790
离开这里
Get out of here.

1203
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:49,590
我再去找你
I'll find you.

1204
01:49:58,510 --> 01:50:00,260
我们该走了 快
We have to go. Now!

1205
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:14,570
我打开了黑暗神书
I opened the Darkhold.

1206
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,570
必须把它阖上
I have to close it.

1207
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:23,410
没有人会再受黑暗神书诱惑了
No one will ever be tempted by the Darkhold again.

1208
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,500
你还好吗
You all right?

1209
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:11,790
-结束了吗　-对
-Is it over? -Yeah.

1210
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:13,630
阿美莉卡没事吧
Is America okay?

1211
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:15,750
她正要过来接我们
She's on her way here to get us.

1212
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,220
旺达呢
Wanda?

1213
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:22,010
没有
No.

1214
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:33,900
她摧毁了每个宇宙的黑暗神书
So she destroyed the Darkhold in every universe.

1215
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:38,440
她做对了
She did the right thing.

1216
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,410
没错
Yeah, she did.

1217
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:51,250
你的宇宙是什么样子
What's your universe like?

1218
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:54,710
非常美
It's very beautiful.

1219
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:01,470
真希望我能带你去看
I wish I could show you.

1220
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:06,890
我很想去
I'd really like that.

1221
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:14,480
-但我该走了　-对
-But I have to go. -Yeah.

1222
01:52:15,730 --> 01:52:16,980
我知道
Yeah, I know.

1223
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:22,200
太可惜了
It's too bad, though.

1224
01:52:24,450 --> 01:52:26,410
原本可能会有一次对撞事件
Could've been one hell of an Incursion.

1225
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:31,250
我爱你
I love you.

1226
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:37,040
我在每个宇宙都爱你
I love you in every universe.

1227
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:44,380
我也想关心一个人或有人来关心我
It's not that I don't wanna care for someone or have someone care for me.

1228
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:45,760
只是…
It's just...

1229
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:50,470
我很害怕
I get scared.

1230
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:51,640
是
Yeah.

1231
01:52:54,730 --> 01:52:56,150
是啊
Yeah.

1232
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,490
面对你的恐惧
Face your fears...

1233
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:13,160
奇异博士
Doctor Strange.

1234
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:46,910
这怎么比多重宇宙入口还要难
How is this so much harder than a Multiversal portal?

1235
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:51,410
她需要放慢脚步 更有耐心
She needs to slow down and be more patient.

1236
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:55,120
让我想起另一个学生
Reminds me of another student I knew.

1237
01:53:57,620 --> 01:53:58,960
感觉如何
How you feeling?

1238
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:00,590
为何这么问
Why do you ask?

1239
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:05,510
你用黑暗神书梦行到自己的尸体里
You used the Darkhold to Dreamwalk into your own corpse.

1240
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,180
对喔
Yeah, right, that.

1241
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:10,180
没事
Fine.

1242
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:14,310
我倒是想问你一件事
But I do wanna ask you something.

1243
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:17,230
你幸福吗
Are you happy?

1244
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:20,440
这问题…
That's a...

1245
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:21,730
有意思
interesting question.

1246
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,110
原本以为拯救世界会获得幸福
You'd think that saving the world would get you there...

1247
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:27,990
并没有
but it doesn't.

1248
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:35,450
有时我忍不住会幻想其他宇宙的生活
Sometimes, I do wonder about my other lives.

1249
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:39,290
但我还是很感恩在这里
Yet I remain grateful in this one.

1250
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:42,090
即使有种种苦难
Even with its tribulations.

1251
01:54:44,090 --> 01:54:46,760
至少我们不必独自面对
At least we don't have to go through it alone, huh?

1252
01:54:46,920 --> 01:54:48,010
没错
No, we don't.

1253
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:01,150
等一下
Wait.

1254
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,570
你好
'Sup?

1255
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:05,730
你好
'Sup.

1256
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,360
我创造了一些火花
Made some sparks.

1257
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:09,990
很好
Great.

1258
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:12,200
你的双亲会很骄傲
Your parents would be proud.

1259
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,280
希望以后她们能看到
I hope you'll get to show 'em one day.

1260
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:16,410
史蒂芬
Stephen.

1261
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:23,340
我很高兴落入你的宇宙
I'm glad I fell into your universe.

1262
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:26,590
我也很高兴 小鬼
So am I, kid.

1263
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:29,970
我也很高兴
So am I.

1264
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:46,160
奇异博士2：失控多重宇宙

1265
01:58:55,670 --> 01:58:57,010
奇异博士
Doctor Strange?

1266
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:01,600
有什么事吗
Can I help you?

1267
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:03,720
你引发对撞事件
You caused an Incursion...

1268
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:05,520
我们必须解决
and we're gonna fix it.

1269
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:15,690
除非你怕了
Unless you're afraid.

1270
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:21,870
一点也不怕
Not in the least.

1271

1273
02:06:13,490 --> 02:06:14,700
结束了
It's over！
