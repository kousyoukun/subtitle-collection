Well, an arraignment is a

It's where you'll

Well, that's easy. I'm guilty.

162
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,902
But here you are,
back in New York.

163
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:51,601
But here I am...
back in New York.

164
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:56,693
About a year ago I
started having pain

165
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:59,130
down there.

166
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,916
Turns out it was a complication
from the procedure, um,

167
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,352
scar tissue.

168
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,441
Something called
Asherman's syndrome.

169
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,617
It's very expensive to fix.

170
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:11,012
So I called the doctor; He told
me to come back to New York,

171
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,536
let him have a look at it,
see if he could correct it.

172
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,498
I got on a bus,
stayed at a hotel.

173
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,171
And the morning of my
doctor's appointment,

174
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,805
I go to the office.

175
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,460
And I'm about to give
the receptionist my name

176
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,331
when I see something.

177
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:30,901
Behind her, I suddenly realized

178
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:35,210
that I can see into this
private office space.

179
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:38,474
And at first I think
I'm seeing things.

180
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,435
Beyond her through the
open door, there's Roger.

181
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,438
Just sitting there, looking
like a nervous puppy

182
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,092
and I'm thinking to myself,

183
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:51,574
what's he doing at a
women's health practice?

184
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:54,359
And after my appointment,
I waited across the street

185
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,579
for him to leave so I
could get a better look

186
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:58,668
and I saw he was with her.

187
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,584
I'm sorry. He was with who?

188
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:05,066
Emily. The girl
who killed herself.

189
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,285
Ah.

190
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:11,463
So were you jealous? Is that
what this was all about?

191
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,770
No, I was enraged.

192
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:15,772
I knew exactly why
he brought her there.

193
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:17,992
I could see the shame
written all over her face.

194
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:19,863
It was history repeating itself.

195
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:23,606
I realized we were in a cycle.

196
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,608
He used us both, he
was done with us both,

197
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,958
and this is how he
cleaned up his mess.

198
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,960
So, on the bus back to Ohio,

199
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,049
I did something I hadn't
done in four years.

200
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:34,617
I looked him up online.

201
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,576
I never wanted to know
if he had replaced me

202
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,665
with someone else, but

203
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,841
suddenly I was obsessed.

204
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:44,453
And it turns out I
was only one girl.

205
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,629
It was at least
four other girls,

206
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,850
all the same pattern, all with
him for six months to a year.

207
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:53,505
And then the girls, the
ones he would sponsor,

208
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:56,987
would suddenly
drop out of school,

209
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,555
never to be heard of again, just

210
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,645
another girl who tried to make
it in New York and couldn't.

211
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:06,649
Another sweet young thing
who hit her "sell by" date.

212
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:09,913
Then I, um, read that

213
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,567
Emily killed herself.

214
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,961
And I knew he would
go to the funeral.

She is two years
older than Holly,

225

Yeah. Hey, guys.

I think I may have
come up with a defense.

243
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:25,859
Hmm.

244
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:27,904
Defense of others.

245
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:30,298
Oh.

246
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,213
Okay.

247
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:35,825
I can't, for the life of me,
see how that applies here.

248
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,653
Uh, I second that.

249
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,002
Well, there were other girls.

250
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,406
We march them
through the courtroom

251
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:41,798
and we let them
tell their stories.

252
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,616
She did it for all of them.

253

In defense of others.

00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,421
Oh, come on, Bull.
You know that's not

255
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:48,925
what defense of others means.

256
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,058
We have no one to defend here.

257
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:53,234
And that other victim was
dead, lying in a coffin.

258
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:55,410
Yeah, and the other girls
that you're speaking about,

259
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,717
they were presumably no
longer involved with him.

260
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,849
There was no need
to defend them.

261
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:02,504
Ha. You call yourselves lawyers.

262
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,028
The reason there are judges,
the reason there are courts,

263
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,422
is because the law,
to be effective,

264
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,250
must be a living thing.

265
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:11,208
Each case is its own creature.

266
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,819
And that is why

267
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,559
it has to be interpreted,

268
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,779
not simply referenced
and then applied.

269
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,781
Now, I want to file
a motion in limine

270
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,130
and ask that judge
for permission

271
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:22,959
to put those other
girls on the stand.

272
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:28,312
Your Honor, in the matter of
The People v. Holly Kerrigan,

273
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:32,795
we contend that Holly
Kerrigan killed Roger Navarre

274
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,492
to prevent greater harm.

275
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,886
We believe, in fact,
that she was acting

276
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,192
in defense of others.

277
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,454
Now,

278
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:41,195
in order for us to
support this claim,

279
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,371
we are asking for the
court's permission to call

280
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:46,809
several of Roger Navarre's
scholarship students.

281
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:49,420
Now, they will testify
that the late Mr. Navarre

282
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:52,815
was involved in a systematic
pattern of seducing

283
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:57,559
and in many cases impregnating
young women he sponsored

284
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:01,302
at a variety of art
institutions here in New York.

285
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,739
15-year-olds, 16-year-olds

286
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,350
upending their lives and
destroying their futures.

287
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:08,091
Doing irreparable harm

288
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:10,746
to their physical
and mental health.

289
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,487
JUDGE: A.D.A. Conway,

290
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,488
your thoughts?

291
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:15,011
Your Honor.

292
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,970
The People don't
dispute the fact

293
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,842
that Roger Navarre may
have been a predator.

294
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:22,149
But that alone does not
give Ms. Kerrigan license

295
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:25,369
to gun him down in a
church full of mourners.

296
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:26,849
These women's experiences

297
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,025
are irrelevant to the crime.

298
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:30,548
Ms. Kerrigan is accused of.

299
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,376
In fact, we strongly
doubt that Ms. Kerrigan

300
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,860
has ever even met
these women before.

301
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,165
And that is why the People
strongly urge the court

302
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,384
to deny the defendant's motion.

303
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:43,692
Before I make my
ruling, I'd like to hear

304
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,520
from at least one
of these women.

305
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:47,783
BENNY: Would you
please tell the court

306
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,871
your name?

307
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,699
My name is Rachel Carter.

308
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,745
And what is your connection
to Roger Navarre?

309
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:58,533
Well, I had a number of
connections to Mr. Navarre.

310
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,535
I first met him when I applied

311
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,885
to the Manhattan
Institute of Ballet.

312
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,018
He saw a tape of my audition,

313
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,672
heard I'd been accepted,
and then reached out to me

314
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:09,892
and offered to
help with expenses.

315
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,808
I was very grateful.

316
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,028
And then, over time,

317
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:18,248
the relationship
became more personal.

318
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,250
Romantic?

319
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,557
I believed so at the time.

320
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,951
Looking back, from
Roger's point of view,

321
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:28,563
I'm sure it was
fundamentally sexual.

322
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,260
Now, let's start
from the beginning.

323
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:34,569
When Roger Navarre first
reached out, you were how old?

324
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,614
I was 14 years old.

325
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,486
Okay, and then you
moved to New York,

326
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,663
and about how long
before the nature

327
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:43,360
of the relationship changed?

328
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:46,407
About a year and a
half. [laughs softly]

329
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,497
He called me one night, asked
if I'd ever been to an opera.

330
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,325
I, of course, had not.

331
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:54,067
Not many operas pass through
Chaney, Texas, where I'm from.

332
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,200
And opera tickets here in
New York are very pricey.

333
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,507
And you went to Lincoln
Center and saw what?

334
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,555
Flew on his private jet to San
Francisco to see La bohème.

335
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,340
Wow.

336
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:09,082
So, did the relationship
change that night?

337
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,085
I wanted it to.

338
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:16,567
I was so consumed by
all of it. By him.

339
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:19,005
But no. He really took

340
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:22,008
his time. Really won my trust.

341
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:25,707
I think he wanted me to
believe it was all my idea.

342
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:30,755
I had never been with anyone
at that point in my life.

343
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,367
Anyway, it was about
two months later.

344
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,846
We were on a boat,

345
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,111
a sailboat that belonged
to a friend of his,

346
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,287
out in the middle of the ocean.

347
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,116
I had never done
anything like that.

348
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,640
Everywhere you looked,
you only saw water.

349
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,642
No land.

350
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:50,732
I found it very freeing.

351
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,082
I'll let you figure
out the rest.

352
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,997
And was there alcohol involved?

353
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:55,867
Yes.

354
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,913
And drugs? Yes.

355
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,317
And you were how
old at this point?

356
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:01,264
16.And when

357
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,788
the two of you had sex,
did he use protection?

358
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,181
He didn't like that.

359
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,096
BENNY: So, what happened?

360
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,793
How did it end?

361
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,405
[sighs]

362
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:14,321
Little less than a year
later, I got pregnant.

363
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:17,019
He said he'd take care
of the whole thing,

364
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,065
be with me the whole time.

365
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,892
Truth is...

366
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,720
Truth was

367
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:24,896
I didn't want it to
be taken care of.

368
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,030
I had this crazy teenaged idea

369
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,511
that we'd get married
and travel the world.

370
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:33,035
Just keep doing
what we were doing,

371
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,256
except I wouldn't be in school,
and we'd have this baby.

372
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,562
Made perfect sense to me.

373
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,347
Really freaked him out.

374
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,131
He said no.

375
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,003
It had to be taken care of.

376
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,267
Two weeks later, I

377
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,964
get a letter

378
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,533
explaining that his
"assistance" had run its course.

379
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:55,579
That I was free to apply
to other benefactors

380
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,320
should I so choose

381
00:16:57,364 --> 00:17:00,019
but that his assistance was
no longer available to me.

382
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,585
So what did you do?

383
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:04,632
I withdrew from school.
Got a place of my own.

384
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:06,155
Got a job dancing.

385
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,809
Dancing?

386
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:11,204
I lied about my age,
got a job dancing.

387
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,815
Topless. Then nude.

388
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,600
Now I do photography
and modeling.

389
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,863
Adult modeling.

390
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,083
BENNY: I see. Thank you.

391
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,780
No further questions,
Your Honor.

392
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,131
Here comes the moment of truth.

393
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,567
Thank you, Ms. Carter,

394
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,135
for telling the
court your story.

395
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,573
Your Honor,

396
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:36,403
we're all sorry for what
happened to Ms. Carter.

397
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:39,058
And I understand
that the defense

398
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,755
has lined up
additional witnesses

399
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,626
with similar accounts.

400
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,369
But the fact remains that
none of this is relevant.

401
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:48,241
Moreover, its probative value

402
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:50,112
is far outweighed by
the prejudicial effect

403
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,940
it would have on the jury.

404
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,376
This kind of evidence,

405
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,639
these kinds of witnesses
need to be excluded.

406
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:57,467
Your Honor, with
all due respect...

407
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,642
JUDGE: While I am not

408
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:01,254
unsympathetic to the facts,

409
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:04,126
I have to make my
ruling based on the law.

410
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,086
And the law agrees
with A.D.A. Conway.

411
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,610
We're not here to judge whether

412
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,134
the late Mr. Navarre
was an honorable man

413
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,962
or not. We are here

414
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:17,879
to decide whether Ms. Kerrigan
acted in defense of others.

415
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:20,142
And there is nothing in
the testimony that I heard

416
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:21,839
that suggests that is the case.

417
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:25,321
And for that reason, your
motion in limine is denied.

418
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:40,423
[Benny sighs]

419
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:44,645
[sighs]

420
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,647
It's not really all that bad.

421
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,778
Yeah, it is.

422
00:18:47,822 --> 00:18:50,041
Yeah, it is.Okay.

423
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,652
I asked

424
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:53,020
Marissa to reach
out to all the women

425
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,655
who were involved
with Roger Navarre,

426
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:57,048
see if they would be
available to sit in court

427
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,833
once the trial begins.

428
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,878
But it's COVID. No
public allowed.Yes.

429
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:03,054
I know. And I am
gonna go to the judge,

430
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:04,534
and I'm gonna make
a special plea.

431
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,884
Since these women were
not allowed to testify,

432
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:09,235
they should at least be
allowed to witness the trial.

433
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,845
The trial of a
woman who suffered

434
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,716
at the hands of the
same man they did.

435
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,242
And I will argue it will
help their mental well-being.

436
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,592
That's awfully nice of you.

437
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:21,247
Going to bat with the
judge to make that happen.

438
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,726
There's nothing nice about it.

439
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,598
I want them sitting
in that gallery.

440
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,382
I want the jury
wondering about them.

441
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,992
And I want you to find a moment

442
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,038
to point them out, to indicate

443
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:34,347
that they went through
the same version of hell

444
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,175
that Holly went through.

445
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,699
Agent Sturgeon, when
did Ms. Kerrigan

446
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:41,005
come to the FBI offices
to meet with you?

447
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,920
Holly Kerrigan first
came to meet me

448
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,705
a little over a year ago.

449
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,489
And what was the
purpose of that visit?

450
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,012
She alleged that Roger Navarre

451
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,971
had committed statutory
rape on her person

452
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:52,495
and, additionally, had
provided illegal substances

453
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:53,975
to a minor... her...

454
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,498
Over a period

455
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,152
of about 18 months.

456
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,130
CONWAY: And what did you
do with that information?

457
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,590
STURGEON: Well, I opened

458
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,592
a case file, started
looking into Mr. Navarre.

459
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,725
Tried to determine if
there was any truth

460
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:06,509
to what Ms. Kerrigan alleged.

461
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,337
And opening up a case file,

462
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:11,906
looking into someone
like Roger Navarre,

463
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:14,561
can you tell us
what that entails?

464
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,040
Let me be clear.

465
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,608
We didn't take these
allegations lightly.

466
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,437
But investigations like this

467
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,701
can go on for months,
sometimes years.

468
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:27,356
You have to make sure you have
all of your ducks in a row

469
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,315
before you start
indicting people,

470
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:31,447
particularly people
as well-connected

471
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:32,883
as Roger Navarre.

472
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,668
CONWAY: And did the defendant

473
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:36,974
continue to
communicate with you?

474
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,281
Yes, we spoke on a
number of occasions.

475
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,109
She would call and email

476
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:42,806
from Ohio.

477
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,983
And what was the purpose
of these calls and emails?

478
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:48,464
Did she have additional
information to offer

479
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,597
about Roger Navarre?

480
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,338
It's-it's my understanding that,

481
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,601
at that point, they were
no longer communicating.

482
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,777
Not for years.

483
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,822
No, the purpose of
these calls and emails

484
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,737
was primarily to
express her impatience

485
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:02,173
with the investigation.

486
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,915
Her frustration
with the process.

487
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:08,223
And, I suppose, her
frustration with me.

488
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,270
So were you surprised

489
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,576
when she took matters
into her own hands?

490
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,882
No.

491
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,100
Not entirely.

492
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:17,537
Thank you, Agent Sturgeon.

493
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,234
No further questions.

494
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,368
[Bull clears throat]

495
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:29,026
BENNY: Good morning,
Agent Sturgeon.

496
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,201
Good morning.

497
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,073
Now, point in fact,

498
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,641
my client Holly Kerrigan
wasn't the only person

499
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:37,513
that came to see you about
Roger Navarre, was she?

500
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,167
I believe it's time
for an objection.

501
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,690
CONWAY: Objection, Your Honor!

502
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,083
Relevance?

503
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,476
BENNY: Your Honor,

504
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,216
it's the A.D.A. who
called the witness

505
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,349
and opened the door to
the fact that the FBI

506
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:50,483
opened up an investigation
on Roger Navarre.

507
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:52,006
Objection overruled.

508
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,357
The witness will
answer the question.

509
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,316
I'm sorry, what
was the question?

510
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,230
Well, let me
refresh your memory.

511
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:01,798
I was asking if my
client, Holly Kerrigan,

512
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:04,366
was the only person
who came to the Bureau

513
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,846
about Roger Navarre?

514
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,239
No, she was not.

515
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:10,851
BENNY: No, in fact, a
number of other women

516
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:13,332
came to see you
personally to file

517
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,377
similar complaints
against Mr. Navarre.

518
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,161
Isn't that correct?

519
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:18,946
Yes, that's correct.

520
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,296
And I know they
are wearing masks,

521
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,690
but perhaps you
can point out, uh,

522
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:26,127
the ones that you have
spoken to in the past?

523
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,085
CONWAY: Again, Your Honor,
what is the relevance

524
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:29,565
of this line of questioning?

525
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,413
It sounds to me like the
defense is intentionally

526
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,134
making a mockery of
your earlier order

527
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,223
not to hear testimony from
anyone who may have been

528
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,138
involved with the
late Mr. Navarre.

529
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,835
My goodness, A.D.A. Conway

530
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,271
has quite a temper.

531
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:42,273
Objection sustained.

532
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:45,364
The jury will disregard any
remarks regarding the women

533
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,756
seated in the gallery.

534
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,889
And I'm putting the
defense on notice.

535
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,804
Any further shenanigans
of this type,

536
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:52,371
and I will rescind

537
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,373
my invitation to
these observers.

538
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,939
Am I clear?

539
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:57,941
Very clear, Your Honor.

540
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,117
Any more questions
for the witness?

541
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,163
No, Your Honor.

542
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:05,253
I believe we covered it all.

543
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,298
Yes, I believe we have.

544
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:14,088
She's all dressed.

545
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,313
Holly, I meant to
ask you this morning,

546
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:24,446
how was your first
night in prison?

547
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,187
It was fine.

548
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,842
They had me all by myself
and there's cameras.

549
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:31,105
Nobody wants me to kill myself
when they're not looking.

550
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:36,676
Holly, there's something I want
you to think about tonight.

551
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,785
You're very good at
telling people that,

552
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,245
without Roger Navarre,

553
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,073
you never would have
come to New York City,

554
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:44,640
you never would have
learned to dance.

555
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:48,005
But did it ever occur to you
that, without Roger Navarre

556
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,820
you never would have
picked up a gun?

557
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,518
You never would
have shot someone.

558
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:55,477
You never would have spent
a single night in prison.

559
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:58,915
If Roger Navarre had not come

560
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:02,484
into your life, if he had not
done the things that he did,

561
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:05,139
your life would
be very different.

562
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:08,490
And don't you think that's a
point worth making to this jury?

563
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,512
Don't you think your own
life is worth fighting for?

564
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:11,493
[knocking]

565
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:13,321
GUARD: Prison van's here.

566
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,647
I'll see you in the morning.

567
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,630
See you in the morning, Holly.

568
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,160
[exhales]

569
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:27,640
[phone ringing and buzzing]

570
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,903
[clicks tongue] Ah.

571
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:31,382
It's my favorite fiancée.

572
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:32,862
Hello, my dear.

573
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,082
I'm on my way home.
Your brother says hi.

574
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,650
What do you mean, your
"favorite" fiancée?

575
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:38,999
You win.

576
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,653
You're not my favorite.

577
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,829
Now I feel bad. You sound
like you're in a good mood.

578
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,265
Why? What's going on?

579
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:47,094
I take it that you
haven't seen the news?

580
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:49,923
I DVR'd something I thought
you'd want to know about.

581
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:52,186
And in legal news, turns out

582
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,275
that Holly Kerrigan,
the young woman who shot

583
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:58,018
and killed billionaire hedge
fund manager Roger Navarre

584
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,454
in front of 30-odd witnesses

585
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,630
at the funeral of a friend,

586
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:04,198
has a complicated
mental health history.

587
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:07,636
Investigators for the Manhattan
Daily Journaldiscovered

588
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,987
that she spent time in no less
than three Ohio mental health

589
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:13,337
and drug rehabilitation
facilities

590
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,557
prior to her 20th birthday.

591
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,516
Did you get all that?

592
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,866
Yeah. We got it.

593
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:21,694
All right, I'll see
you in a little bit?

594
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,826
See you in a bit. [Exhales]

595
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,263
Well

596
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:27,787
they didn't waste any time.

597
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,789
You think the D.A.'s
office put that out there?

598
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,921
Please, it's right
from the playbook.

599
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:34,010
The second we get
a little traction

600
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:37,536
by having those five previous
victims in the courtroom...

601
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,060
[sighs]

602
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,155
Okay. I think, at this
point, it's safe to assume

603
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:50,461
the jury knows that you have
spent some time in rehab,

604
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,681
as well as some
other institutions,

605
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,509
because of your
mental health issues.

606
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,251
The depression and
the suicidal thoughts.

607
00:25:57,294 --> 00:25:58,600
Okay.

608
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:00,689
But isn't that
just more evidence,

609
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:03,300
more proof that what happened
to me actually happened to me?

610
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:05,322
Okay, I promise you, I never
would have needed to go

611
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,478
to those places if I
hadn't met Roger Navarre.

612
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:09,045
BENNY: Sadly, almost certainly,

613
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:11,482
the jury isn't gonna
look at it that way.

614
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:13,809
That's why I want to discuss
a different strategy with you.

615
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:14,834
[inhales]

616
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:17,750
We would like you to consider

617
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:20,317
allowing us to pursue
an insanity defense.

618
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,364
But I'm not insane.

619
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:26,672
Okay, killing Roger wasn't
just some crazy, impetuous act.

620
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:28,519
In some ways, it was the
single most rational thing

621
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,371
I've ever done in my life.

622
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:32,218
And I don't want to spend the
rest of my life in an asylum.

623
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:34,157
Or in a prison, for that matter.

624
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:37,334
Well, that's good
to hear, Holly.

625
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:39,206
That sounds like progress.

626
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:42,035
Sounds like someone
who's starting to care

627
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:45,734
about what happens to them the
day after the trial is over.

628
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:48,041
BENNY: Holly,

629
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:50,391
choosing to mount
an insanity defense

630
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,480
does not mean that
you're insane.

631
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:56,005
It only means that you weren't
capable of rational thought,

632
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:58,355
of understanding the difference
between right and wrong

633
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,619
when you chose to
kill Roger Navarre.

634
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,882
And if the jury decides
to accept our defense

635
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,231
when they deliberate,

636
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,667
it often means,

637
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,713
after a proper examination

638
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:09,802
and you are found
to be of sound mind,

639
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:11,891
that you will be free to
live the rest of your life

640
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:12,979
as a free woman.

641
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,938
BULL: What do you think?

642
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:19,594
I really think this
is the move here.

643
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,075
Now that the prosecution
has rested their case

644
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,730
and the defense is about
to begin presenting theirs,

645
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:27,167
I've been informed
that Ms. Kerrigan

646
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,603
would like to change her plea

647
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,823
to "not guilty by
reason of insanity."

648
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:33,173
[murmuring]I need the
jury to understand

649
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:35,281
that this is simply an added
option when it comes time

650
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,003
to making a decision.

651
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:39,135
You can still find
the defendant guilty,

652
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,963
find the defendant innocent,

653
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:43,444
or, if you feel she meets
the threshold requirements...

654
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:45,794
Which we will discuss
during deliberations...

655
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:48,884
Not guilty by
reason of insanity.

656
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:50,320
All right, then.

657
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:51,582
Mr. Colón,

658
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,149
you may call your first witness.

659
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:55,064
Dr. Diposo,

660
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:57,719
would you please tell the jury
what it is you do for a living?

661
00:27:57,763 --> 00:28:01,418
I'm what they call a
forensic psychiatrist.

662
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,769
I deal primarily
in the assessment

663
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:06,467
and treatment of
people in prisons,

664
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,861
people in psychiatric hospitals,

665
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:11,907
and occasionally individuals
among the general public

666
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:13,909
who have mental health issues.

667
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:15,737
BENNY: And are you familiar

668
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,043
with Holly Kerrigan?

669
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:18,609
Yes, I am.

670
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:20,829
In fact, I met with her
personally this morning.

671
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:23,092
In addition, I've
studied the records

672
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,920
of the crime of
which she's accused.

673
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:26,617
Transcripts, police reports,

674
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:28,837
evidence files.

675
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:32,058
And have you come to any opinion

676
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,930
regarding Ms.
Kerrigan's mental health

677
00:28:34,974 --> 00:28:39,413
in the hours, days or even
weeks surrounding the killing?

678
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:40,849
I have.

679
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:42,982
Based on everything
that I've reviewed,

680
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:45,288
it seems fairly obvious to me

681
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:47,029
that, prior to the killing,

682
00:28:47,073 --> 00:28:51,512
she was suffering from
a profound case of PTSD

683
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:55,516
stemming from both her
relationship with Mr. Navarre

684
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,518
and its aftermath.

685
00:28:57,561 --> 00:29:00,651
And in the days and
weeks leading up to

686
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:03,263
and including the killing,

687
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:08,355
I believe her behavior fits the
legal definition of insanity.

688
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,793
BENNY: Right. I-It... You
hear about PTSD all the time.

689
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,490
Seems like it's everywhere.

690
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:14,840
Is it even real?

691
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:17,016
Does such a thing
actually exist?

692
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:19,453
Oh, it absolutely exists.

693
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,237
In fact, it's been recognized

694
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:23,370
for over a century
under different names.

695
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:26,808
In World War I, they
called it "shellshock."

696
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,375
In World War II,

697
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:31,030
they referred to it
as "battle fatigue."

698
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,683
It's all the same thing.

699
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:34,618
And it doesn't just happen
to soldiers in combat.

700
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:36,165
Anyone who's party to

701
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,210
or witnesses

702
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:39,168
a traumatic event

703
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,301
is a candidatefor it.

704
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,825
And does PTSD make you insane?

705
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,436
No, it does not.

706
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,439
And yet you began your testimony
by stating unequivocally

707
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:52,225
that Holly Kerrigan
was legally insane.

708
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:55,358
Or at least she was
in the days or hours

709
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,491
prior to Roger Navarre's death.

710
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:58,927
I do.

711
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:00,624
I think a simple
review of the facts

712
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,322
makes that abundantly clear.

713
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,019
How do you mean?

714
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,716
Put aside whether you believe

715
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,372
the act of murder is the
undertaking of a sane person.

716
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,548
Making a choice to kill a person

717
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:14,682
in front of so many
witnesses is not.

718
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,205
Add to that that,

719
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:17,816
once she pulled the trigger,

720
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,470
she made absolutely
no attempt to flee.

721
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,385
Add to that,

722
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,866
then she tried to kill herself.

723
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,520
That human being,

724
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:27,869
in that moment,

725
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:28,957
is not sane.

726
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:33,440
I see.

727
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,920
Thank you very much.

728
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:36,922
I have no further
questions, Your Honor.

729
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,662
CONWAY: Dr. Diposo,

730
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:41,535
you testified that you
met with the accused

731
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:43,798
for the first time this morning.

732
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,278
That's correct.

733
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,821
And what time did that
meeting take place?

734
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,064
We started around 10:00 a.m.

735
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:50,805
And how long did you go?

736
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,633
Little over two hours.

737
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:56,376
Okay. So, it's a
little after 2:00 now

738
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:59,248
45 minutes for lunch...
W... wouldn't you say

739
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:02,817
that you arrived at your
conclusions rather quickly?

740
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,342
Again, the accused's
behavior, in that moment,

741
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:08,040
says it all.

742
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,782
No matter how much time I
might have to contemplate,

743
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:14,394
it wouldn't change
my conclusions.

744
00:31:15,395 --> 00:31:16,918
John Wilkes Booth.

745
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:18,180
Insane?

746
00:31:18,224 --> 00:31:19,834
Excuse me?

747
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,856
John Wilkes Booth, the man
who shot Abraham Lincoln.

748
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,099
Did it in a theater
full of people.

749
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:26,928
By your definition,
wouldn't he be insane?

750
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:29,365
I'm not prepared to
render a decision on that.

751
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:32,064
I've never met with Mr. Booth.

752
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:34,066
Of course not. And he
did try to flee, so

753
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,241
never mind.

754
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:36,546
Objection, Your Honor.

755
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,374
Counsel is badgering
the witness.

756
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:39,941
CONWAY: My apologies,
Your Honor.

757
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:42,465
I'll withdraw the
question, Your Honor.

758
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:43,989
How about Sirhan Sirhan?

759
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:46,426
Shot Bobby Kennedy in
a room full of people

760
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:48,123
in a hotel in Los
Angeles... Insane?

761
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,951
Your Honor...

762
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:50,996
Ms. Conway!

763
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,867
How about all the terrorists

764
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,000
in all the planes that
attacked this country on 9/11?

765
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,653
Insane? Or impassioned?

766
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:57,698
Crazy? Or determined

767
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:59,047
to do something and willing

768
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,875
to get it done at
any cost? Your Honor,

769
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,617
counsel isn't even
addressing the witness.

770
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,141
She is testifying
directly to the jury.

771
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:07,553
JUDGE: Ms. Conway,
if you do not stop

772
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,492
and allow the witness to answer,

773
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:11,799
I will find you in
contempt of court.

774
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:13,844
That's all right, Your Honor.

775
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:15,846
My apologies, Your Honor.

776
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,587
I'll just withdraw the question.

777
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:21,069
And I have no more questions.

778
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,158
♪

779
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,605
Well, that's a terrific
closing argument, Benny.

780
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,087
It's beautiful, actually.

781
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:43,744
So you think it'll make
a damn bit of difference?

782
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,052
No, I don't.

783
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,491
[sighs]

784
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:53,275
I am absolutely certain

785
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,930
we don't have anywhere near
a dozen "not guilty" votes,

786
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,716
much less "not guilty
by reason of insanity."

787
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,892
And I'm reasonably sure
the A.D.A. doesn't have

788
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:04,199
a dozen jurors who want
to send Holly to prison

789
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,419
for the rest of
her life, either.

790
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:09,117
So you think we're
looking at a hung jury?

791
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,947
I'm afraid so.

792
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,645
Mr. Colón. Dr. Bull.

793
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,256
Rachel.Ladies.

794
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,345
None of us has a good
feeling about any of this.

795
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:22,391
Well, I'd love to disabuse
you of that feeling, but...

796
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:23,653
I can't.

797
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,876
We ought to head inside.

798
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,099
BENNY: Let me remind you

799
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:37,624
of the funeral in
which this all began.

800
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,757
The funeral of a young dancer.

801
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:43,499
17 years old.

802
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:46,285
Took her own life.

803
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:48,635
One can only imagine the pain

804
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:51,681
that must have been inflicted
upon this young woman,

805
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:54,771
to choose death by her own hand.

806
00:33:56,512 --> 00:34:00,299
I mean, how do we
make sense of that?

807
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:01,430
Seems

808
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:04,042
beyond comprehension.

809
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:07,219
But one person understood.

810
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:08,698
My client understood.

811
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:11,745
When she saw the young ballerina

812
00:34:11,788 --> 00:34:13,747
and her old boyfriend
on the street

813
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,749
making their way out
of a woman's clinic,

814
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:19,013
she knew instantly
what was happening.

815
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,798
You know why? Because
it happened to her.

816
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:24,410
And she knew at
that exact moment

817
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:27,282
that it was gonna keep
happening to other young women

818
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:30,024
unless she put a stop to it.

819
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,071
And that's exactly what she did.

820
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:36,857
Now, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

821
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,730
I know some of you may think
my client is a criminal.

822
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,821
Well...

823
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:47,346
I know some people who
think she's a hero.

824
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,046
And whatever side of that
question you land on,

825
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,701
one thing's undeniable,

826
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:58,748
and that is, my client's life
has been irreparably destroyed.

827
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,186
And there's no reason to
think that incarceration

828
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:04,667
for the rest of her life will
do anything other than make

829
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:07,844
whatever's already been
damaged even more so.

830
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:11,413
So, please

831
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,549
let's give this
young woman a chance

832
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:20,553
at finding the professional
help that she needs.

833
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:26,254
And at helping her forge
a future for herself.

834
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,475
Thank you for listening.

835
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,963
Ladies and gentlemen, you
may think she's a criminal.

836
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,923
That's what the attorney
for the accused just said.

837
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:45,186
Well, let me clear
that up for you.

838
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,188
She is a criminal.

839
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:50,104
People who shoot people
in the back of the head,

840
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,498
in our society, are criminals.

841
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,804
[chuckles]: And thank
goodness that's the case.

842
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:58,286
Look, no one's saying
that Roger Navarre

843
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,592
was a model citizen.

844
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:01,768
Clearly, he had a
lot of girlfriends,

845
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:04,771
many of them far
younger than he.

846
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:10,429
But only one of them
saw fit to end his life.

847
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,996
Only one of them saw fit
to sneak up behind him...

848
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,044
I was with Roger Navarre
for a year and a half,

849
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:19,481
and I drove Holly
from Ohio to New York

850
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:22,136
so she could shoot that
monster. Convict me.

851
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,722
Order! We're in the middle
of closing arguments.

852
00:36:23,746 --> 00:36:26,227
The court officer will
remove this woman...

853
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:27,968
I was with Roger Navarre
for seven months,

854
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:29,622
and I bought the gun.

855
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:31,232
Convict me.[gavel banging]

856
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:33,321
Order! I need this
court to come to order!

857
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:35,367
I was with Roger Navarre
for almost a year.

858
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,909
[gavel banging]I
paid for the bullets.

859
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,413
Convict me.

860
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:40,328
And I was with Roger
Navarre for ten months.

861
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:41,938
I told Holly all
about the funeral.

862
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:43,549
Where it was. When it was.

863
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:45,725
We're all as
responsible as she is.

864
00:36:45,768 --> 00:36:48,094
[gavel banging]If you convict
Holly, you should convict us, too.

865
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:50,686
JUDGE: I need these women to
be escorted from the courtroom

866
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,253
and held in contempt.

867
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:53,970
I need the accused to
be returned to holding.

868
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:56,257
And I need the
jury to be led back

869
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:58,409
to the jury room so that I can
have a private conversation

870
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:01,306
with counsel from both sides.

871
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:05,614
I need this court
to come to order!

872
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:07,834
So, what's your
pleasure, Ms. Conway?

873
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,488
The jury is tainted.

874
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:11,229
Are the People moving
for a mistrial?

875
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,057
I need a little time.
I need to call the D.A.

876
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:15,885
May I have 20 minutes?

877
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:19,062
Take an hour. I'll
be in my chambers.

878
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,716
Thank you, Your Honor.

879
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,154
I'll be in the conference
room if anyone needs me.

880
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,375
Well, you called it.

881
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:29,159
Looks like it's
gonna be a mistrial.

882
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:30,770
Maybe.

883
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:32,598
Maybe not.

884
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,253
[knocking]

885
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:37,298
This room is being used.

886
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,647
[door opens]

887
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,519
BULL: So, what's the verdict?

888
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:43,130
Take a guess. I'm-I'm trying
to write the press release now.

889
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:47,874
Ah, yes, so, the D.A.
wants a mistrial, right?

890
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,223
Eh, why not?

891
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,269
Another year, who's
gonna complain

892
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:53,923
that an accused killer
is staying behind bars

893
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:56,274
even though there's been
no verdict rendered?

894
00:37:57,318 --> 00:38:00,190
Is there anything else?
'Cause I'm really busy.

895
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:02,584
Yeah, actually,
there's one more thing.

896
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:05,283
And I only mention this
because you're really good.

897
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:07,285
You're very impressive.

898
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,417
I've watched you work twice now,

899
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,637
and you've got what it takes.

900
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:14,901
Okay.

901
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:17,382
[quietly]: Nobody
knows your name.

902
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:22,691
You didn't come all
this way for a mistrial.

903
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,780
I know you're ambitious.

904
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:26,826
I know you've got big plans.

905
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,698
Maybe city attorney.
Maybe mayor.

906
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,657
Where are you going
with this conversation?

907
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,156
Every challenge is a
hidden opportunity.

908
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,747
Okay, you know, I-I
hear you selling,

909
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,358
but I have no freaking
idea what the product is.

910
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:40,274
Four women stood up in court
today and said, "I did it, too."

911
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,058
How long you think
that's gonna stay secret?

912
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:45,192
Well, the truth is that only
one woman is responsible

913
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:46,846
for the death of Roger Navarre.

914
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:49,283
The truth.

915
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,807
The truth is, Roger
Navarre ruined lives,

916
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:54,201
and he was poised
to ruin many more.

917
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:55,768
He was a very bad man,

918
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:58,031
and there are a lot of men
out there just like him.

919
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:01,643
Women know the truth.
You know the truth.

920
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,645
You're the prosecuting attorney,

921
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:05,821
and you've just been
handed a do-over.

922
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:08,346
Don't you think,
knowing what you know

923
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,652
this would be a good time
to listen to your heart

924
00:39:10,696 --> 00:39:12,480
instead of your boss?

925
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,573
Do the right thing.

926
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:21,271
And, as an added benefit,

927
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:23,926
you make a little
noise for yourself.

928
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:35,416
Due to a series of outbursts
in the courtroom today,

929
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,897
a mistrial has been
declared in the matter

930
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,552
of The People v. Holly Kerrigan.

931
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:44,033
I want you to know that, as
the prosecuting attorney,

932
00:39:44,077 --> 00:39:47,689
I've elected not to retry
this case at this time,

933
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:49,691
and have agreed to
allow Ms. Kerrigan,

934
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:51,693
subject to
psychiatric evaluation

935
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:53,695
and a willingness to
enter pretrial probation,

936
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:55,697
to serve no jail time.

937
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:58,526
This will spare the People
both the cost of a new trial

938
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,399
and the expense of Ms.
Kerrigan's incarceration

939
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,531
until such time as
that trial begins.

940
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:05,141
To be clear,

941
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:09,581
while I do not condone
Ms. Kerrigan's actions

942
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:13,976
it became apparent over
the course of the trial

943
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:17,023
that her victim, Mr. Navarre,

944
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:20,983
was, in fact, an extremely
dangerous predator.

945
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:23,725
The kind of man
who takes pleasure

946
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:27,990
in laying waste to young
women's lives and futures.

947
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:31,864
And while that does not
excuse what happened here,

948
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:35,955
it does provide context
for Ms. Kerrigan's actions

949
00:40:35,998 --> 00:40:38,914
that we were
heretofore unaware of.

950
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,352
And for those of you

951
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:47,749
who have never met a
man like Roger Navarre

952
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:50,883
just ask your wives

953
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:53,276
your daughters

954
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,409
your mothers

955
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,455
your girlfriends.

956
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:01,154
I'm reasonably certain
that they have.

957
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:07,160
I'm Assistant District
Attorney Whitney Conway.

958
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,205
Thanks for your attention.
