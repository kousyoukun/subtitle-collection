check in about strategy,

159
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:19,553

an appearance at voir dire.

expediency's sake,

162
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,907
and now he's caught up in
the system and he can't get out.

163
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,300
Sounds like something
out of Kafka.
Exactly.

164
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:29,954
So who's the
public defender?

165
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:31,826
Oh, she's a kid.

166
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:34,176
I think she sat third chair
against us a couple of times.

167
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:37,222
Kind of reminds me
of me at that age.

168

Look, we won't even
have to go to court.

169
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:42,053
She just wants us to weigh in
on some strategy,

170
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:44,404
maybe show up for voir dire.

171
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,362
So what do you think?

172
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,712
And keep in mind
it's the holiday season.

173

Oh, it's okay, I'm already
on the naughty list.

Sure.

If we don't really
have to do anything.

176
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,938
Oh, a-and any way that I
could set up a meeting

177
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,940
between you and the A.D.A.?

178
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,682
See if maybe you could
sweet talk this ambitious punk

into dropping the charges?

180
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:06,904
Mm-hmm. What happened to "we
don't even have to go to court"?

181
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,384
Well, w-we don't.

182
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,387
I figured, if you powwow
with the A.D.A.

and he drops the case,

then we really
don't have to go to court.

My name's Dr. Jason Bull, and
I'm working with Chris Coleman.

You have a minute?

193
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,069
Dr. Bull. I know who you are.

Uh,

00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,987
welcome to misdemeanor row.
I'd tell you to pull up a chair,

you brought one with you.

You want mine?

No, I'm good right here. Thanks.

199
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,734
Wow.

200
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,214
It's the kind of office you
work like hell to get out of.

Yup.

203
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,874
Uh, what-what can I do
for you, Dr. Bull?

204
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,963
I know you didn't come
all this way to, uh,

205
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,835
check out the office, did you?

206
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:11,316
I was hoping to get you to drop
the charges against my client.

207
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,797
Why would I do that?

208
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:16,626
Because the only thing
he's guilty of is bad luck.

209
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,368
Well, that is your opinion,

210
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,544
and you're entitled
to it, certainly.

211
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,939
But from my vantage point,
from the city's vantage point,

212
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,331
he laid his hands on a guy

213
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,159
and that guy
subsequently died.

214
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:31,728
Mm, not exactly.

215
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:34,905
We both know if my client
had had $5,000 for bail,

216
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,298
he wouldn't be
in this situation.

217
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,996
He'd still be facing
manslaughter charges.

218
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,563
No, he wouldn't.

219
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,957
He wouldn't have pled guilty,
he would've pled innocent,

220
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,306
which is what he is.

221
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,003
And then he would've
explained to a jury that,

222
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,004
when he was
attacked, all he did

223
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,920
was protect himself.

224
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,400
The truth is, his guilty plea

225
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,445
is the only piece of evidence
you have against him.

226
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:56,057
Well, the good news is,
if he is innocent,

227
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,017
as you say he is, uh,
a jury will acquit him.

228
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:04,065
I'm guessing this
your first felony trial.

229
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:08,330
Everybody has their first,
Dr. Bull.

230
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:10,941
Absolutely.
Everybody has a first.

231
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,030
The important thing is,
once you get your shot,

232
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:14,205
you don't want to lose.

233
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:17,078
Oh, I'm not worried.

234
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:20,690
See, I have three witnesses and
a dead body and a guilty plea,

235
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:23,911
so I'm feeling pretty good.

Excellent.
I can't even begin to tell you

how important
your feelings are to me.

This is not a case I chased.

Nevertheless,
I would like to win,

252
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,016
and the only
argument we have,

253
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,149
the only one that makes
any sense at all,

254
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,891
is that this man
was given bad advice.

255
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:32,980
And that's not gonna ring
terribly true to the jury

256
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:35,156
if the person who gave him
that bad advice

257
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,811
is sitting next
to him in court.

Isn't that right?Yes.

And you did so even though
he insisted he was innocent.

the best course of action.

Isn't that correct?

voluntary waiver,
and his admission should stand.

291

that Mr. Coleman

Enough.

I agree with Mr. Colón that
this attorney's representation

was substandard.

I will be reporting her
to the state bar.

298

That said, however,
I find that the defendant

299
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,840
did, in fact, make

300
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,756
a knowing waiver of his rights,
and I'm denying

to revoke.

302

If my client had known it was
gonna turn into a homicide,

478
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,232
he would've pled not guilty.

479
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,364
Objection.

480
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,801
Sustained. Anything else?

481
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,629
Not at this time, Your Honor.

482
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,108
Thank you, officer...Well, no movement yet,

483
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,241
but positions
are definitely softening.

484
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:02,331
Nothing like a little common
sense to wake people up.

485
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:06,030
Do you see the man
who assaulted your friend?

486
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,423
Is he here in the courtroom?

487
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,251
That's him right there.

488
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,384
That's the guy who pushed
and punched Connor.

489
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:13,473
RUSSO: Let the record show
that the witness pointed
to the defendant.

490
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:16,389
Punched? Now I punched him?
I didn't punch anybody.

491
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:19,305
Just let them tell their story,
and then we will tell ours.

492
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,307
RUSSO: Can you tell me about
his demeanor that night?

493
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,352
How was he behaving?

494
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,354
He was pretty intense.

495
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:27,269
Uh, I think there might have
been something going on

496
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:28,488
between him and his wife.

497
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,272
And also, just my opinion,

498
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:33,188
I think he might have been
a little drunk.

499
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,234
[scoffs]

500
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:40,064
Hmm...

501
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,283
CHRIS:
Drunk.

502
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:42,893
Guy said I was drunk?

503
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:45,461
I haven't had
a drink in six months, man.

504
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:47,507
Like I told you in court,
they will tell their story,

505
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,422
and then we will tell ours.

506
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,772
Appearances are important.

507
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:54,296
The jury's always watching,
and every time they look at you,

508
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,951
they see an angry guy
who can't control his temper.

509
00:20:56,994 --> 00:21:00,737
W-Well, maybe it's 'cause I am
a really angry guy.

510
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,523
[sighs]

511
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,700
The man said I was drunk.

512
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:08,484
I just got my six month chip.

513
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:11,313
You know, you know
how hard I worked for that?

514
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,228
And I promise you,
we'll share that with the jury

515
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,577
when you testify.

516
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,318
In the meantime,
stop helping their case.

517
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:19,582
Lose the anger, lose the
attitude, and start behaving

518
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:22,324
like a guy who was buying
a present for his kid

519
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,413
and not a guy who was
looking for a fight.

520
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,023
Don't tell me how to act!

521
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm going through
hell right now, man!

522
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,161
I'm still in hell right now!

523
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:35,555
[sighs]

524
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:40,211
I just lost my apartment,
my job, my wife.

525
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:41,517
I'm about to lose my kid!

526
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:44,390
And I'm facing 20! 20 years!

527
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,348
20 years in prison!

528
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,524
And you two are what?
What are you doing?

529
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,700
What are you doing?
You're just sitting there!

530
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,355
You're just sitting there and
you're just watching it happen!

531
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,532
Mr. Coleman,
if you are at all unhappy

532
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:58,186
about the quality
of your representation,

533
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,536
your free representation...Bull...

534
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,059
[door opens]

535
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,365
Time to get
back on the bus.

536
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:05,498
[sighs] Just give me a minute.

537
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,935
Hey, you don't have a minute;
the bus needs to roll.

538
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:10,154
Hey, I'm talking to my lawyer!
What the hell is wrong with you?

539
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,547
BULL: He'll be right there,
Officer.

540
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:14,594
My fault,
I lost track of the time.

541
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,944
[sighs]

542
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,077
Thanks for dinner.

543
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,777
It's the least I can do.

544
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:29,609
Look, if you want to quit,
I'd totally understand.

545
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:32,786
I can fly solo
from here.

546
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:36,398
I honestly don't think
the guy did it, but...

547
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,226
he can't get out
of his own way

548
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:40,228
and I'm not sure I can help
someone like that.

549
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,622
[phone ringing]

550
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:43,797
Hello?

551
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,233
Speaking.

552
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,585
Oh.

553
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,108
Well, i-is he okay?

554
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:58,681
Will he be able to
come to court tomorrow?

555
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:00,291
[sighs]

556
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:02,337
I-I understand.

557
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,948
No, o-okay. All right.

558
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:07,124
W-We'll ask the judge
for a one day continuance.

559
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:10,214
Thank you for
letting me know.

560
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:14,088
[sighs]

561
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:17,221
Tha-That was,
that was the prison.

562
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,354
Chris is in
the hospital.

563
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,576
Someone picked a fight
with him in the cafeteria.

564
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,665
[scoffs]

565
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:30,452
Must've hit the guy pretty
hard; he broke his wrist.

566
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:33,281
Great. Now we can't
put him on the stand.

567
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:35,326
The second his ass
hits the chair,

568
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,111
the prosecutor will want
to cross-examine him

569
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:39,200
about the fact that he got
into another fight

570
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:42,551
and they will argue that he has
a propensity for violence.

571
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:47,164
And they'll be right.

572
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,346
[door opens]

573
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:59,263
Oh. It's nice of
you to show up.

574
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,396
I think so.

575
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,007
Well, uh, you're an hour
late, so let me just ask you,

576
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,879
when we ask you
to come to court,

577
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,141
are you gonna be on time?

578
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:08,838
Because a judge is not
gonna wait an hour.

579
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:11,275
My sitter cancelled.You have a cell phone.

580
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,887
As a matter of fact, I do.

581
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,845
But I ran out of minutes.

582
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,327
[phone thuds on table]

583
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,677
I need you to understand,
when I come see you,

584
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:23,810
when I come to court,
it costs me.

585
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:24,811
I get that.

586
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,465
No, I don't think you do.

587
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,468
My kid wants to know why his
father isn't coming to see him.

588
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,341
And now that Chris is in jail,
he can't pay child support.

589
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:36,213
We're trying to fix that, but
that's why we need your help.

590
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:41,828
I love him.

591
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:45,005
I really do.

592
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:48,617
But if it's not the drinking,
it's the temper.

593
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:50,619
And if it's not the temper...Everybody's lives

594
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:53,709
are gonna be better if we
can get him out of jail.

595
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:59,236
Look, the truth is,
I didn't see the whole fight.

596
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,022
I can't talk about
the part when

597
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,024
Chris pushed that man.

598
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:07,114
I saw the beginning and the end,
not the middle.

599
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,770
I was focused on finding help.

600
00:25:10,813 --> 00:25:14,338
So you can't testify
about how Connor fell?

601
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:17,385
I didn't say that.

602
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:20,170
E-Excuse me?

603
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:25,001
I could say that
it looked to me like...

604
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:29,702
...that guy Connor tripped.

605
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:33,575
That it had nothing to do
with Chris's shove.

606
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,186
Wait. A-Are you
talking about lying?

607
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,753
No.

608
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:40,190
We do not lie in
a court of law.

609
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,279
It never helps,
it only hurts.

610
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:45,065
Trust me, the last
thing you want is for

611
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:47,676
both of your child's
parents to be behind bars.

[gasps] Oh, what the
hell are you doing?
It's me.
It's me, it's me, it's me.

[groans]

617
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,362
DANNY: I've been trying
to get ahold of you

618
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,930
for the last 24 hours.

619
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,584
You want to tell me
about last night?

620
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:29,805
Yeah, sure. I-I had the chicken.

621
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,155
It was good.You know what
I'm talking about.

622
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:35,550
All of a sudden, you decide
to impersonate McDreamy

623
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,727
and perform an operation
in the middle of dinner,

624
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:40,947
and then it's "We got
to go, we got to go,"

625
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:43,993
and as soon as we grab an
Uber and I get in the car,

626
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,952
you ditch me.I did not ditch you.

627
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:48,345
You slammed the door closed
and headed for the subway.

628
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,957
Well, you know, we-we live
on different parts in the city.

629
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,176
Okay? It's just
more efficient that way.

630
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,222
You know, you're really
good with a bottle of vodka

631
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:58,138
and a table knife, but
you are a terrible liar.

632
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:00,444
Okay.

633
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:02,098
How did you know
how to do that?

634
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:05,885
How did you know how to
save that man's life?

635
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:08,104
I unclog toilets for a living.

636
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:10,280
It's-it's really not
that different.

637
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,285
What?Thanks for the company.
And the sex.

638
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,896
Okay, loo-- Stop!

639
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:19,681
Please, d-don't be so dramatic.

640
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:24,555
It was a simple
needle decompression.

641
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:28,081
Okay? Any doctor can do it.

642
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:30,083
What does that mean?

643
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:33,913
It means that
before I came here,

644
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:39,614
before all of this,
I was a surgeon.

645
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:44,488
A cardiothoracic surgeon.

646
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:48,275
But you say that like
it's a bad thing.

647
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,494
Why would you keep something
like that a secret from me?

648
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:53,454
Because I don't...
I don't want to go to jail.

649
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:55,238
Okay?

650
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:57,023
I don't want
to be sent back home.

651
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:00,156
'Cause I don't want to die.

652
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:04,378
They cut in front of us,

653
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:08,208
and then I said something

654
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,819
about going to the back
of the line.

655
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,778
And how did the men react?

656
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:16,042
The man that died,

657
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:19,480
he punched my husband,
right in the face.

658
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:21,482
BENNY:
You saw that?

659
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,876
GINA: Yes, I did. And then
they all surrounded him,

660
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,399
and I went to go get help.

661
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:28,141
Did you feel threatened?

662
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:30,143
Oh, my God, yes.

663
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:32,711
That's why I called
for security.

664
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,669
Nothing further, Your Honor.

665
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,932
We are batting .500.

666
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:39,021
I am feeling a little momentum.

667
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:40,849
This is the easy part.

668
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:44,287
Let's see how she
holds up on cross.

669
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:46,681
Mrs. Coleman, are you aware
that phone calls

670
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,030
at the jail are recorded?

671
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:51,425
No, I didn't know that.

672
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:53,993
Objection. Counsel's
badgering the witness.

673
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,429
What's the point here?

674
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:58,475
I'll cut to the chase,
Your Honor.

675
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:03,654
CHRIS [over recording]:
Did you meet with the lawyers?

676
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:05,787
Is that your husband's voice?

677
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,268
Yes.

678
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:12,098
GINA [over recording]:
Yeah. I talked to them.

679
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,753
I told them I'd do anything
to get you out of there.

680
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,233
I even told them I'd lie.

681
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,626
And that's you, isn't it?

682
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:20,106
BENNY:
Objection.

683
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:21,498
Move to strike.

684
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:23,283
Overruled. The jury may
consider the recording,

685
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,024
as it pertains
to the credibility

686
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:26,939
of the witness.

687
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,114
Anything else?

688
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,333
Just-just one more question.

689
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:33,162
How do we know
you're not lying now?

690
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,948
Because I'm not.

691
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:40,953
RUSSO: I have no more questions
for this witness.

692
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:42,998
MARISSA:
Remember those six greens?

693
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:46,959
Well, two of them
just turned red.

694
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:49,004
Terrific.

695
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,839
[sighs]The case isn't even over.

696
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,145
He's already celebrating.

697
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:01,930
Ah, that guy
oozes ambition.

698
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:03,714
An ugly ooze.

699
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:07,762
Probably keeps a running tally
of his cases on the wall.

700
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,372
A running tally?

701
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:12,593
Like a scorecard?
Like a fantasy football grid?

702
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:15,074
Oh, yeah. I've seen
all different kinds.

703
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:17,250
It's the A.D.A.s
on misdemeanor row.

704
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:19,382
They're itching to
get off of there.

705
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:22,081
Itching to work
felony cases.

706
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:24,083
They have a
scoring system.No kidding.

707
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:25,911
And the person with the most
points at the end of the week

708
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:27,651
wins a pot of money.

709
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:31,220
But more importantly, they're
one step closer to a promotion.

710
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:33,614
I guarantee you our
client is up there.

711
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,311
And I'll bet it
pays off big.

712
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:37,792
I suddenly remembered
I have an errand to run.

713
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,448
You go on in and I will
join you as soon as I can.

714
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:43,929
Whatever you say.

715
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,461
MAN:
Can I help you?

716
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:56,202
Frank's not here.

717
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:58,378
Really? You sure?

718
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,815
He told me to meet him here
for a conference.

719
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,382
Actually, he's in court.

720
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,384
Really? How is that possible?

721
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:05,907
I thought we were getting
a late start today.

722
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,387
I must have missed a text.Uh, must have.

723
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,867
Senior moment.

724
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,042
Hmm.

725
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:16,309
LEE: Mr. Colón,
call your next witness.

726
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:19,355
[clears throat]

727
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:22,576
The defense would like to call
A.D.A. Russo to the stand.

728
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:24,708
LEE: The defense
wants to call

729
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:26,319
the prosecutor to the stand?

730
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:28,103
BENNY: If it
pleases the court.

731
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:30,584
Objection, Your Honor.
I am not a witness.

732
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:33,108
I wasn't there. These guys
are playing some kind of game.

733
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:35,545
Both of you, get up here.

734
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:44,076
You want to tell me
what's going on, Mr. Colón?

735
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,991
Nothing's going on,
your Honor.

736
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:48,950
I know he's new at this, but
hopefully the prosecutor knows

737
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,299
that there is nothing
in the rules

738
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:52,606
that precludes us from
calling him to testify.

739
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,564
Respectfully, Judge...

740
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:57,132
Just go sit
in the witness box, Mr. Russo.

741
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,400
BENNY:
A.D.A. Russo,

742
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:07,012
you've been out
of law school, what,

743
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:09,623
a year?
18 months.

744
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,233
And I'm guessing
this is your first big case?

745
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:14,149
Can I object? Is this relevant?

746
00:32:14,193 --> 00:32:15,977
Mr. Colón?

747
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,761
I'd submit that it's
very relevant, Your Honor,

748
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:22,027
but I'd be happy to move on
if Your Honor prefers.

749
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,463
LEE:
Move along.

750
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,036
You recognize this?

751
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:36,215
Yes, I recognize it. It's, um,

752
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:39,131
well, it's a photograph of, uh,
something we use in the office

753
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:41,698
to track, uh, cases.

754
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,874
Kind of a scorecard, right?

755
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,659
Your Honor, I have to object.

756
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:46,921
Answer the question.

757
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:53,884
Kind of.
Um, it's common practice.

758
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:57,149
It's a performance
incentive chart.

759
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:58,933
BENNY:
Really?

760
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:03,459
Why are my client's
initials on it?

761
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,505
In the win column?

762
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:07,289
Next to a jackpot?

763
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,639
Um, I'm not sure
that's referring to your client.

764
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:13,034
Let me remind you that
you are still under oath,

765
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:15,428
Mr. Assistant
District Attorney.

766
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:20,128
Now, in keeping
with the holidays,

767
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:22,565
let's talk turkey.

768
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:26,178
This is your first big case,
which means if you win it,

769
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,006
my client will be your ticket

770
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:31,835
out of what young A.D.A.s
like to call "misdemeanor row."

771
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:34,534
Isn't that right?
I mean,

772
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:37,232
if you win this case,
in all likelihood,

773
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:39,669
you'll be promoted
to felonies, won't you?

774
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:41,802
You'd have to ask my boss.

775
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:44,065
I'm asking you what you think.

776
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,459
You believe this case
will help you

777
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:48,591
move you up the ladder,
don't you?

778
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:51,246
I suppose so, yes.

779
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,336
You suppose so?

780
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,471
Well, isn't this supposed to be
about justice?

781
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:01,604
Isn't this supposed to be
about innocence and guilt?

782
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:03,215
I never said it wasn't.

783
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:06,174
Look at this card and tell me,

784
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:08,133
tell the jury,
tell the man

785
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:11,092
that you're prosecuting,
that this is about the law,

786
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:16,141
that this is about faith,
honor and fairness,

787
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:17,794
and not about naked ambition,

788
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,667
that-that these...
these dollar signs

789
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,452
mean that you are here
to fight the good fight.

790
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:24,758
Tell them, A.D.A. Russo.

791
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:28,370
Never mind.

792
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:31,286
I withdraw the question.

793
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,203
Go ahead, cross-examine yourself
if you'd like.

794
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:37,553
I love when he gets
righteous like that.

795
00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:39,381
Makes the hairs
on the back of my neck

796
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:41,383
stand up and do a happy dance.

797
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,130
BULL:
So all that's left

798
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,219
is closing arguments,
and once that's done,

799
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:53,395
we wait.
Uh, for what?

800
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,005
The jury.

801
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:57,225
Okay, and, um, how long
does that usually take?

802
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,314
Varies. Could be
a couple of days.

803
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:00,620
Could be a couple of weeks.

804
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:02,404
Juries in
murder trials

805
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:07,192
want to come back with unanimous
verdicts. Guilty. Not guilty.

806
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:08,802
Most of the time,
they feel they've failed

807
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,847
if they can't come
to a decision.

808
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,240
And everybody has
their own theories

809
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:15,069
on what's a good sign
and what's a bad sign.

810
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,463
What does it mean
if they're out for a long time?

811
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:20,161
What does it mean if
they come back quickly?

812
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:22,598
And, uh, what's yours?
Uh, h-how do you think it works?

813
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:25,166
You think if-if they take
a long time, that that's, um,

814
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,169
it's good for us,
it's bad for us?

815
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:31,651
Look...

816
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:35,002
there is no science
to this at all,

817
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:37,309
but I tend to believe
that it is harder for a jury

818
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:40,138
to convict a man,
send a man to prison,

819
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,617
than it is to acquit

820
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:44,098
a man, so once
they've been out

821
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,189
for a couple of days,
I get nervous, but like I said,

822
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,408
that's not science.

823
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:51,497
Have you ever had it where,

824
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,194
right after you give
your closing arguments,

825
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:56,328
the jury right there goes,
"Boom, not guilty"?

826
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,068
No, that doesn't happen.

827
00:35:58,112 --> 00:35:59,940
'Cause I mean,
I didn't do anything.

828
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:04,292
I know, but that doesn't happen.

829
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:07,077
BENNY:
Y'all have been

830
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:10,211
sitting here
for almost a week now,

831
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:12,996
and here's what we know:

832
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,609
The only piece of evidence
they have against my client

833
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:18,045
is his guilty plea.

834
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:22,789
Hmm? So w-what informed
that guilty plea?

835
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:27,576
Was it a, uh, thorough
investigation of the facts?

836
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,275
Was that plea
arrived at after, uh,

837
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:34,235
hours of thought
and deliberation?

838
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:38,631
Was my client even allowed
to get a second opinion?

839
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:41,155
None of the above,
ladies and gentlemen.

840
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,551
That is because this plea
is not about justice.

841
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:47,292
It's not about the truth.

842
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:50,686
It's about allowing
everybody to go home

843
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,646
the day after Thanksgiving,
so that they could enjoy

844
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:55,430
what little they had left

845
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:59,347
of what should've been
a four-day weekend.

846
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:01,349
That's it.

847
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:03,264
So my client did
what he was told

848
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,701
because he wanted
to get out of there, too.

849
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:08,051
But keep in mind,

850
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:12,012
my client didn't actually do
anything wrong.

851
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:15,624
He defended himself.

852
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:18,453
He defended his wife,
and that's not against the law.

853
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:23,023
He pushed a man that
was coming at him.

854
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:26,244
A man that had already
punched him in the head.

855
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,289
A man that was bigger than him.

856
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:32,728
A man that was clearly
under the influence of alcohol.

857
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:34,382
I...

858
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:39,300
I'm sorry. I-I was just...

859
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:42,085
listening for a second.

860
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:44,871
I wanted to see
if I could hear it.

861
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,873
The-the thing that my client did

862
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:50,311
that was against the law.

863
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:53,967
Nope. Not yet.

864
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,838
B-But wait, wait, wait.

865
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:58,624
A week later,
the man that my client

866
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,627
was defending himself
against died.

867
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,411
And now, suddenly,

868
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:06,806
I-I guess because they had
his guilty plea,

869
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,416
the prosecutor decides,
let's call it

870
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,333
manslaughter and let's charge
Chris Coleman with it.

871
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:15,771
A-Are they saying
that-that-that the victim

872
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:18,121
was-was shoved to death?

873
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:21,124
No. He died of a brain injury.

874
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:23,866
What-what,
do they know?

875
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,956
Are-are they certain that the,
that the brain injury

876
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,524
was a result of the fall
he took that night?

877
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:32,484
I haven't seen any
evidence of that,

878
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:35,095
but-but let's give them
the benefit of a doubt.

879
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:37,358
My client didn't-didn't
trip him.

880
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:40,535
My client didn't push him
to the ground.

881
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:42,363
So why did he fall?

882
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:46,933
Was it perhaps because, uh,
he drank too much?

883
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:50,980
Was it perhaps because
the sidewalk was uneven?

884
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:53,809
Did he have a trick ankle?

885
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,985
Of course, none of these things

886
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:58,771
have anything to do
with my client.

887
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:01,774
So why is
my client here?

888
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:05,473
Well, because he-he
decided to plead guilty

889
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:09,651
to make it easy for everyone,
including himself, to get home?

890
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:12,524
Because an ambitious prosecutor

891
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:16,092
thinks that convicting
somebody, anybody,

892
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:17,442
will be good
for his career?

893
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:19,661
Wha... [stammers]

894
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:21,663
Because, uh-uh,
the world

895
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:24,840
needs to be saved from, uh, dads

896
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:27,539
trying to find good deals on
Christmas gifts for their kids?

897
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:30,455
Well, the point is,

898
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:33,414
any one of us could've been

899
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,938
standing in that line
that night.

900
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:39,812
Any one of us here.

901
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,205
Now staring at 20 years
in prison.

902
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:48,429
Still nothing.

903
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:51,693
I don't hear a thing.

904
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:54,174
I guess it's because
I have no idea

905
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:57,264
what this man
is actually guilty of.

906
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:59,309
Thank you.

907
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,530
CHRIS:
So now we wait.

908
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:05,490
So now we wait.

909
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:11,713
Thank you for those words.

910
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:14,368
And, uh,

911
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,415
thank you for
saying it that way.

912
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:24,857
How'd you feel if I came out
to the prison next week?

913
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,336
Just to visit.

914
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:29,514
Sure.
Yeah.

915
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:31,559
And with the holidays coming up,

916
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:34,736
I'll arrange for your wife
and son to come see you.

917
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,172
You're okay with that, right?

918
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:39,611
Yeah, that'd be great.

919
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:41,656
[knock at door]

920
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,400
The bus is here.

921
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,489
Oh, good, everybody's
still here.

922
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,925
Jury's back.

923
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:51,536
Excuse me?

924
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:53,407
Jury's back.
They have a verdict.

925
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,758
LEE:
Mr. Foreman,

926
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:58,717
in the matter of The State v. Chris Coleman,

927
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,240
what do you find?

928
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:02,285
We the jury find
the defendant...

929
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:06,376
...not guilty.

930
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,466
[gallery murmuring]

931
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,642
[crying]JUDGE LEE: Members of the jury,

932
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:11,643
thank you for
your service.

933
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:12,948
Court is dismissed.
[gavel bangs]

934
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,954
BAILIFF:
All rise.

935
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:36,276
Must be nice to breathe
free air again.

936
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,060
Yeah.

937
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:42,064
Look, um, look, I just,
I just want to apologize

938
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:46,416
for taking my anger out
on everyone back there.

939
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,507
No, it's you who's
owed an apology.

940
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,641
On behalf of the entire criminal
justice system, I apologize.

941
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,080
I think our work
here is done.

942
00:41:58,124 --> 00:42:00,561
Mr. Colón, may I offer you
a ride back to the office?

943
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:02,128
I'm in.
Lady.

944
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:03,956
Gentleman.

945
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,877
I know a little boy
who's dying to see you.

946
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,575
Yeah?

947
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:17,709
I think his mom would love
to have you for dinner.

948
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:23,584
I mean, if you want to.Yeah.

949
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:25,586
Yeah, I'd like that.
