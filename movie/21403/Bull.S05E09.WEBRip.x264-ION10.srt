1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:07,257
ANNOUNCER:
This is Justice in America.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,259
And I'm Madeline McBride.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:12,554
It has been 73 days
since the murder

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,264
of 11-year-old Kaylee Nagle.

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,892
Kaylee was found sexually
assaulted and stabbed to death

6
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,894
in her Westchester,
New York home.

7
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,439
And while the police have yet
to make an arrest,

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,858
there is one suspect from whom

9
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,276
we never hear.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,570
I'm talking
about Kaylee's stepfather,

11
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,572
Jeremy Brennan.

12
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,949
According to Jeremy's
statement to the police,

13
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,784
he picked up Kaylee after school

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,786
at soccer practice
and returned home.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,247
And while Kaylee's mother
was at work,

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,167
Jeremy claims
he went on a bike ride

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,253
and returned less than
an hour later to find

18
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,506
his stepdaughter
dead on the kitchen floor,

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,092
her soccer jersey ripped open,

20
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,262
her shorts pulled down
to her ankles,

21
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,847
and a kitchen knife

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,266
buried in her chest.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,145
Well, apparently, the police
are running out of ways

24
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,773
to get this man to talk,
and that is why

25
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:08,651
I am asking you,
for the 22nd night in a row,

26
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:13,448
to let Jeremy Brennan know
that you need to hear from him.

27
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,450
You want answers.

28
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,660
And he can't hide!

29
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,204
Let's keep up the pressure.

30
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,790
Let's bombard this man
with our tweets.

31
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,666
Let's demand
that he come forward

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,461
and answer some questions.

33
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,339
@JeremyBrennanRealty.

34
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:34,010
#StopHidingJeremy.

35
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,306
Dr. Bull, Mr. Colón.

36
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,016
I appreciate you
braving the pandemic

37
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,934
to meet me
this morning.

38
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,519
For the record,
I get tested every day.

39
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,978
The room is disinfected
every night.

40
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,480
So feel free
to leave your masks on

41
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,690
or take them off
as you see fit.

42
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,651
You gentlemen know
why you're here?

43
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,528
I'm guessing it's because

44
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,363
you have
a Madeline McBride problem.

45
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,824
She's being sued by that family
of the little girl

46
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,992
who was murdered.
And they want her

47
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,412
to stop encouraging her viewers
to harass the stepfather

48
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,248
on social media.

49
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,875
Please.

50
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,045
Well, you know...
this Madeline McBride issue.

51
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,673
She's picking a fight
with someone who,

52
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,258
who might be the guilty party,
but also someone

53
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,677
who could certainly be
perceived as the victim,

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,220
in that his stepdaughter was

55
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,055
the person
who died.

56
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,890
Can't pay them off--
they don't want money.

57
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,892
Can't ask Madeline to stop
what she's doing

58
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,228
without doing irreparable harm
to her brand,

59
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,896
which, as you know, is

60
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,565
the tough-talking, acerbic,

61
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,567
defender of those
denied justice.

62
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,193
Yada, yada, yada.
Long story short,

63
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,737
we're going to court,
whether we want to or not.

64
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,364
BENNY: So you
think the jury

65
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,242
just might side with
the family of the dead girl?

66
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,411
(sighs)
Our whole business is based

67
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,079
on the assumption that
the First Amendment gives

68
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,415
our air personalities
the right to express themselves

69
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,083
without fear of retribution.

70
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,751
And I don't want to give
the courts or a jury

71
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,795
any reason to second-guess that.

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,423
I'd just love to shut this down
sooner rather than later.

73
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,885
If you two were inclined
to lead the fight for us...

74
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,429
I'd certainly make it
worth your while.

75
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,097
You ever watch
that lady's show?

76
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,433
I have caught a little
of it here and there.

77
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,977
It's hard to believe that's
what the founding fathers

78
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,105
had in mind when they were
cooking up the Constitution.

79
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,775
Are you trying to tell me
you'd rather not be involved?

80
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,778
Madeline McBride is part of
this culture of evisceration

81
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,615
that takes over cable
television every night.

82
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,618
Whether it's politics
or celebrity stalking

83
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,995
or true crime,
it's just...

84
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:24,954
it's just mean, man.

85
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,915
Well, it might be mean,
but Madeline McBride

86
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,168
and WNN are on the right
side of this thing legally.

87
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,419
It's the First Amendment.

88
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,630
And the problem is...

89
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,465
if you don't stand up for
the people you don't agree with

90
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,675
when they're being silenced,
there might not be

91
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,969
a right to free speech
when they come after

92
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,971
the people
that you do agree with.

93
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,682
Right? No less a figure
than George Washington said,

94
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,769
"If freedom of speech is taken
away, then dumb and silent

95
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,563
we may be led
like sheep to the slaughter."

96
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,484
BENNY:
Your Honor, the law
of the state of New York

97
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,612
is very clear-- an injunction
can only be granted

98
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,697
if there's proof
that the party in question

99
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,991
is doing irreparable harm.

100
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,661
Counsel is correct
on that point.

101
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,163
Is your client suffering
irreparable harm?

102
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:09,332
Without question, Your Honor.

103
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,002
Jeremy Brennan is suffering
indescribable mental anguish

104
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,297
because of Madeline
McBride's relentless

105
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,675
and very
public attacks.

106
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,511
To be clear,
she's accusing

107
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,389
my client of the murder
of his stepdaughter

108
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,183
on national television,
virtually every night

109
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,726
for over a month now.

110
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,562
All this while he and his wife

111
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,649
are dealing with the anguish
of having lost

112
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,693
their only child in...

113
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,362
as gruesome and savage

114
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,531
a rape and murder

115
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,491
as I can ever recall.

116
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,660
She is using
her bully pulpit

117
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,329
to urge her viewers

118
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,665
to call him out
via social media.

119
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,875
My client receives
over a thousand

120
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,670
tweets a day--
all of them hostile,

121
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,548
many of them threatening--
and all of them mention

122
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,175
Ms. McBride and
her program by name.

123
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,053
Furthermore, Mr. Brennan is
a real estate agent.

124
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,057
His name... is an integral
part of his business.

125
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,686
Bus benches with
his name and photo

126
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,355
are being defaced
with the words "pedophile"

127
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,898
and "killer."

128
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,526
Mr. Brennan can't even go out
in public anymore.

129
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,570
And let's start
with the fact

130
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,739
that my client
has never

131
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,199
been arrested or charged

132
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,744
with any crime. None.

133
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,912
Furthermore, there
is clear evidence

134
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,582
that someone else
is the killer.

135
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,918
There was unidentified
DNA and skin cells

136
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,463
present under
Kaylee's fingernails.

137
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,924
Something Ms. McBride doesn't
even mention on her show.

138
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,053
BENNY:
Your Honor, the DNA found
underneath the victim's

139
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,264
fingernails could come
from anyone, anywhere.

140
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,224
Possibly even...

141
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,435
one of her friends
on the soccer field.

142
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,437
And isn't this ultimately

143
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,355
about the First Amendment?

144
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,609
No less a figure than
George Washington declared,

145
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,445
"If freedom of speech
is taken away,

146
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,822
"then dumb and silent,

147
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,451
we may be led
like sheep to the slaughter."

148
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,787
GODFORD:
Mr. Colón knows good and well

149
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,747
that not all speech

150
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,457
is protected
by the First Amendment.

151
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,627
The Supreme Court has
been very clear on that.

152
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,629
There's a reason
you can't yell fire

153
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,255
in a crowded theater.

154
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,884
Respectfully, Your Honor,
you can if there's smoke.

155
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,763
Personally, going forward,
I would encourage

156
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,015
Ms. McBride to show
a degree of sensitivity

157
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,352
to Mr. Brennan, who,
as Mr. Godford points out,

158
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,773
has not even been charged
with a crime at this point.

159
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,817
However, I am bound
by the State of New York

160
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,486
as well as the United States'
Constitution.

161
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,656
Madeline McBride has a
guaranteed First Amendment right

162
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,324
to state her opinion.

163
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,786
Therefore, I am denying
the request for an injunction.

164
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,038
Court dismissed.

165
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,171
Nice job, gentlemen.

166
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,507
Uh... I told you
we were in good hands.

167
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,385
That George Washington quote
was very moving.

168
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,471
We barely said hello,
but I'm very grateful

169
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,682
for what you did here today.

170
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,725
And...

171
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,562
I know that Kaylee is, too.

172
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,818
(elevator bell chimes)

173
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,032
Hi, hi, sorry!

174
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,534
Forgive me for ambushing you.

175
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,035
It's just that your place
was locked, but then...

176
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,871
the guard downstairs
recognized me

177
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,206
and he said that I could
wait here for you,

178
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,666
so...

179
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,210
What can I do for you,
Ms. McBride?

180
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,838
(sighs)

181
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,340
I got a phone call
about an hour ago.

182
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,052
Jeremy Brennan,
Kaylee Nagle's stepfather,

183
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,221
he...

184
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,350
...he killed himself last night.

185
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,484
♪ ♪

186
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,868
(phone ringing, buzzing)

187
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,541
Hello?

188
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,753
Yes, this is she.

189
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,964
Sorry, what hospital is this?

190
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,967
Oh, no, no, there must be
some mistake.

191
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,762
You're, like,
three blocks away from me.

192
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,889
My father lives in Louisiana.

193
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,225
Has for the last 15 years.

194
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,312
Wait, he what?

195
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,105
Tonight?

196
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,108
Day 42-- no response

197
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,152
from Jeremy Brennan
or his attorneys

198
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,113
regarding his availability
or willingness

199
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,740
to appear on this show.

200
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,117
No response from Westchester PD

201
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,453
as to what their plans
are moving forward

202
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,330
in regards
to the Kaylee Nagle case.

203
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,290
No response from the mayor.

204
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,793
No response
from the county supervisor.

205
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,630
And that is why I've applied
for a permit

206
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,465
for an organized rally
across the street

207
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,800
from the Brennan home.

208
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,095
The scene of Kaylee's death.

209
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,763
And if you live
in the tri-state area,

210
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,015
I do hope that you will
come down and join me

211
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,477
as we let the world know
that we have some questions.

212
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,771
And we want some answers!

213
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,690
Our client concluded
her broadcast,

214
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,984
this broadcast, at 9:59.

215
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,654
According to the Brennan cable
box, the program was viewed

216
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,698
in both the bedroom
and the family room.

217
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,326
Jeremy's widow tells us
she watched it alone

218
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,120
and fell asleep
shortly thereafter.

219
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,831
Apparently her late husband
never made it upstairs to bed.

220
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,834
Sometime between 2:00
and 3:00 a.m.,

221
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,128
he entered the garage,
climbed into his car,

222
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,171
started the engine...

223
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,007
but never opened
the garage door.

224
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,342
Just sat in the front seat and
waited for the carbon monoxide

225
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,512
to do its job-- no texts,
no note, no nothing.

226
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,515
BULL: Let's talk law--
the other side is gonna have

227
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:02,643
to prove Jeremy Brennan's
suicide was uniquely

228
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,896
a result of Madeline McBride's
on-air provocations.

229
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,149
And as disturbing
as what we just saw was,

230
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,694
that's gonna be a very,
very difficult thing to prove.

231
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,864
And yet, the six people
sitting in judgment of all this

232
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,866
may have a hard time
separating what Madeline did

233
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,910
from who Madeline is,
or who she appears to be.

234
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,871
Taylor, you have those Q scores?

235
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,788
"Q score"?

236
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,916
They measure the likeability
and familiarity

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,209
of a celebrity.

238
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,045
Madeline McBride has
an extraordinarily

239
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,504
high Q score, actually.

240
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,673
Over 80% of adults
who are between the ages

241
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,675
of 18 and 49
know who she is.

242
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,886
Additionally, two out
of three of those 80%

243
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,347
admit to watching her at
least three times a month.

244
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,557
Okay. She's popular.
We knew that.

245
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,017
Here's the fascinating part.

246
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,519
Two-thirds of that subset
that says they watch her,

247
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,396
admit they don't like her.

248
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,524
They find her shrill,
hysterical, judgmental, unfair.

249
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,569
Most repeated comment:
"She's not a nice person."

250
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,738
BULL:
And therein lies the problem.

251
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,616
That is our potential jury pool,
which is why

252
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,409
we have to make sure
this case doesn't devolve

253
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,661
into a referendum
on our client's personality.

254
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,539
Now, the other side's gonna
have their hands full

255
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,458
trying to prove causation,
which I'm fairly sure

256
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,086
we will be able
to defend against, but...

257
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,339
if this case becomes
about what that jury thinks

258
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:18,636
about McBride's behavior as
a TV personality, we will lose.

259
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,596
We can't play defense and win.

260
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,557
We have to make sure
this jury understands

261
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:28,020
this is much bigger
than a cable news TV show.

262
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,357
(melancholy, orchestral movie
music plays, bell tolls)

263
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,614
(knocking)

264
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,367
This better be important.

265
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,289
What can I do for you?

266
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,960
Any progress in the
Madeline McBride of it all?

267
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,628
Still in the midst.

268
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,966
Actually, I had a startling
revelation a little while ago.

269
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,634
Our client...

270
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,262
is the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

271
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,930
People see her--

272
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,142
they're appalled,
but they're also fascinated.

273
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,144
Same way they feel
about the Hunchback.

274
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,645
They can't look away.

275
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,773
So, what the novel does,
what the movie does

276
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,942
is it humanizes this person

277
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,153
that people find
so frightening, so terrifying.

278
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,405
It makes them care about him.

279
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,533
That's what we need
to do with Madeline.

280
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,660
Any idea how?

281
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,995
Not a clue.

282
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,830
Something will come to me.

283
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,666
But I suspect that is not why
you came to my office.

284
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,709
Actually, I was hoping

285
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,962
to get a couple of minutes
with the other Dr. Bull.

286
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,089
The psychologist.

287
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,012
(sighs)

288
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,514
What's going on?

289
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,975
My father passed away
last night.

290
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,019
COVID.

291
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,521
I'm so sorry.

292
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,521
No, it's fine.

293
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,356
I'm fine.

294
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,525
Didn't even know he was sick.

295
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,532
Haven't seen or spoken with him
in almost 15 years.

296
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,242
I thought he was

297
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,994
in New Orleans this whole time.

298
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,372
Turns out he was living
four subway stops away from me.

299
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,876
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

300
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,045
No. No.

301
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,797
Um, I wanted to talk about me.

302
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,428
So, I got the call
at 3:00 in the morning.

303
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,765
Hung up, went straight to sleep.

304
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,600
Didn't cry.

305
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,393
Just slept.

306
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,355
Then I got up, came to work.

307
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,815
Still haven't cried.

308
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,820
Is that crazy?

309
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,073
Well, there's a lot
I don't know,

310
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,158
but my suspicion is...

311
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,870
you're not reacting yet
to what happened.

312
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,374
And there's two reasons.
One, you're in shock.

313
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:57,711
And two, your father
already left you 15 years ago.

314
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,048
So, I suspect
you've been mourning him

315
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,801
on and off for years.

316
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,390
That makes sense.

317
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,643
Thank you, Dr. Bull.

318
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,774
Danny?

319
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,570
Sooner or later, you will cry.

320
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,116
I don't know.

321
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,618
He is my father.

322
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,581
And it's not like
I don't have any good memories.

323
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,626
But in a lot of ways,
he was a really bad guy.

324
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,462
I'm just telling you,
it could be tomorrow,

325
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,214
could be years from now.

326
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,174
You'll be walking
down the street,

327
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,219
and suddenly, it hits you.

328
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,931
I just want you
to know it's coming.

329
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,641
Okay.

330
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,311
I've been warned.

331
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,151
GODFORD:
And when did

332
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,154
the two of you become
aware that Madeline McBride

333
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,989
was implicating your husband

334
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,492
in the death of your child
on national television?

335
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,579
Were you regular viewers
of her program?

336
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,665
No, I had never seen it before,
I'd-I'd never heard of her.

337
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,836
Um, I'm guessing
the first time she mentioned it,

338
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,839
it was a Friday night,
because I remember

339
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:27,676
it was a Saturday morning
when we first got the tweets.

340
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,137
Um, my husband

341
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,181
had his own
Twitter account for,

342
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,183
uh, for his work.

343
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,020
And he woke me up
to show me the...

344
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,396
ugliest messages.

345
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,608
Um, and as I said,
it was a Saturday morning,

346
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,360
which are always the hardest,

347
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,820
because Saturdays
were Kaylee's days.

348
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:51,033
It was soccer and sleepovers,
and then...

349
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,869
there were just these long days

350
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:57,039
that we had to fill
by ourselves.

351
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,918
GODFORD:
And how did your life change

352
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,712
as Madeline McBride began

353
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,174
her nightly campaign
against your husband?

354
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,718
After she insinuated
on national television

355
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:14,640
that Kaylee's stepfather was
a pedophile and a killer?

356
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,893
(voice breaking):
My husband was vilified.

357
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,563
At the grocery store,

358
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,400
at his office,
everywhere he went.

359
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,276
They would call him names,

360
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,404
tell him to stop hiding.

361
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,030
And...

362
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,949
did you
and Mr. Brennan ever feel

363
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,411
that you were in any real danger
because of Ms. McBride?

364
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,579
We did, and we were.

365
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,749
In fact, the night before
Jeremy took his own life,

366
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,252
someone threw a brick
through our front window.

367
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,796
Your Honor,
we would like to introduce

368
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,757
into evidence
the aforementioned brick

369
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,301
that came
through the Brennans' window.

370
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,803
Objection, Your Honor.

371
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,973
A brick thrown by an unknown
perpetrator is not relevant

372
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,225
to statements made
by Ms. McBride,

373
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,770
and any attempt to connect
the two is speculative at best.

374
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,939
Actually, the two are
very much connected,

375
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,941
very much related,
Your Honor.

376
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,777
Sorry, Counselor.

377
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,238
I think we need
to see where this goes.

378
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,991
Overruled.

379
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,453
GODFORD:
The brick that
you're holding--

380
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,621
there's some writing on it?

381
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,084
Would you please read
what it says?

382
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,087
It says, "Stop Hiding Jeremy."

383
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,506
GODFORD:
And are you familiar
with that expression?

384
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,675
TRACY:
I certainly am.

385
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,303
"StopHidingJeremy"
was the hashtag

386
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:38,974
McBride told her audience
to tweet to Jeremy every night.

387
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,188
BULL:
You okay?

388
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,189
What do you mean?

389
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,566
Well, that had to be hard
to listen to in there.

390
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,068
Oh. Well, I'm fine.

391
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,697
I know, and I think
the jury sees,

392
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,991
that this is very
difficult for her.

393
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,577
She invited him
into her house.

394
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,204
She invited him
into her life.

395
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,123
And now her daughter is dead,
so she's lashing out at me.

396
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,210
It's-it's kind of
classic textbook.

397
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,586
Don't you think?

398
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,005
Oh. Do you disagree?

399
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,883
Well, for what it's worth,
that's not what I heard.

400
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,011
I heard her communicate--

401
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,555
and rather effectively,
I might add--

402
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,016
the impact your show had
on her life.

403
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:23,894
And, by extension,
her late husband's life.

404
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,147
That is what they heard.

405
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,942
Let's not confuse things,
Madeline.

406
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,862
Jury's not here to litigate
her late husband's guilt.

407
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,531
They're here to litigate yours.

408
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,534
I'm guilty of nothing.

409
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,035
I've killed no one.

410
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,496
All I've done is exercise
my First Amendment rights,

411
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,999
and, um, last time I checked,
that's not a crime.

412
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,711
So, don't you confuse things.

413
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,881
And don't forget
who you're here to defend.

414
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,092
(sighs)

415
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,225
Dr. Soto,
will you please tell the court

416
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,102
what it is you do?

417
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,770
I'm a licensed psychiatrist

418
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:07,729
in the state of New York

419
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,898
in private practice
in Westchester County,

420
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,734
and until his death,
I saw Jeremy Brennan once a week

421
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,362
for the past...
just about four years.

422
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,698
And can you give the court
some idea

423
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,117
why you were seeing
the late Mr. Brennan

424
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,577
these past four years?

425
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,745
SOTO:
Well, without going
into too much detail,

426
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,040
what brought Mr. Brennan
into my office was his struggle

427
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,293
with issues
involving generalized anxiety.

428
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,671
The stresses involved
with running your own business.

429
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,922
Pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.

430
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,384
And can you talk
about the impact

431
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,303
Kaylee's death had on him?

432
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,015
He was, uh, shattered.

433
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,933
Destroyed.

434
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,437
Uh, wanted to be
this strong anchor for his wife,

435
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,105
who obviously was devastated,

436
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,399
and felt ashamed
that he couldn't do it.

437
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,942
Couldn't function.

438
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,613
And then there was the
whole issue of responsibility.

439
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,115
Tracy was at work,
he was at home.

440
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:03,160
The way he explained it
to me was, he could have

441
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,120
just as easily been there,
been at the house,

442
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,663
maybe stopped it from happening.

443
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,665
But he was riding his bike.

444
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,085
At one of our last sessions,
he told me

445
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,795
it was an incredibly
beautiful ride.

446
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,549
And at the time,
it gave him enormous pleasure.

447
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,134
And he really had trouble
understanding

448
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:22,095
how he could experience
so much pleasure

449
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,433
when someone he loved so deeply
was experiencing so much horror.

450
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,477
Your Honor,
we mean no disrespect,

451
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,145
but it's hard
to see the relevance

452
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,647
of any of this testimony,

453
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,982
what bearing it has
on the case at hand.

454
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,484
GODFORD:
Your Honor, we believe
it's essential

455
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,693
for the jury
to understand

456
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,487
Mr. Brennan's state of mind

457
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,530
before Ms. McBride turned him

458
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,991
into the focus
of her broadcasts,

459
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,954
so they may better understand
the impact she had on him.

460
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,956
I agree,

461
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,375
but I feel confident
that you've done that.

462
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,669
If we could please

463
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,671
move it along.

464
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,671
GODFORD:
Beg the court's pardon.

465
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,382
If I could just ask
one last question...

466
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,133
Your Honor...

467
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,133
...about the days before

468
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:04,179
Ms. McBride made him the
centerpiece of her broadcasts?

469
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:06,306
One.

470
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,849
But keep it brief.

471
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,977
GODFORD:
During that period,

472
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,021
immediately after
Kaylee's death

473
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,191
but before Ms. McBride made him
topic number one

474
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:21,154
on her television show, did
he seem at all to you suicidal?

475
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,739
As his doctor,

476
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,993
were you ever really concerned
about his safety?

477
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,035
No.

478
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,788
He was depressed. He was angry.

479
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,832
He couldn't sleep or eat.

480
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,542
But he was also very clear

481
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,502
that he had to be there
for his wife.

482
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,546
GODFORD:
I see. And after

483
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,257
he was implicated
by Ms. McBride?

484
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,717
That was the first time I saw

485
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,344
anything even resembling
suicidal ideation.

486
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,514
She was on television
every night

487
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,224
implying awful things.

488
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,351
The unrelenting tweets.

489
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,603
The phone calls
in the middle of the night.

490
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,397
The brick
through the window.

491
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,234
This rally she wanted to have
across from his house.

492
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:02,029
I wish I hadn't been so timid
about it.

493
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,406
I wish I really had pushed

494
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,242
to have him hospitalized.

495
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,703
Nothing further, Your Honor.

496
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,955
(clears throat)

497
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,960
BENNY:
Hello, Dr. Soto.

498
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,046
So...

499
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,758
Are you familiar
with the concept of correlation

500
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,594
and how it's often confused
with causation?

501
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,596
I'm familiar with it, yes.

502
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,056
BENNY:
That even if there is

503
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,933
a correlation
between Ms. McBride's actions

504
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,936
and Jeremy Brennan's
depression and mental distress,

505
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,731
well,
that doesn't prove causation.

506
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,151
No one knows for sure
why Jeremy Brennan

507
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,320
did what he did.

508
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:48,116
You don't know why Mr. Brennan
did what he did, do you?

509
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,121
The witness will answer

510
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,915
the question, please.

511
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,915
BENNY:
Oh, that's okay,

512
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,917
Your Honor. (chuckles)
That's all right.

513
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,294
I-I think the jury gets it.

514
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:03,590
They know if the doctor, uh,
was certain about any of this,

515
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:07,094
she would have absolutely had
Mr. Brennan hospitalized.

516
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,137
A-And not just thought about it.

517
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,307
You know, like, done it.
Made it happen.

518
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,602
But she wasn't certain.

519
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,354
Were you?

520
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,940
No.

521
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:24,194
Okay, so, let's get back
to correlation and causation.

522
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,780
To the best of your knowledge,
did my client

523
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:30,408
tell Jeremy Brennan
to get on social media?

524
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,369
No, not that I'm aware of.

525
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,079
And, for that matter,
did my client

526
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,833
ever force Jeremy Brennan
to watch her TV show?

527
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,128
No, I-I can't imagine she did.

528
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,672
I can't imagine that, either.

529
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,507
Thank you.

530
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,175
No further questions,
Your Honor.

531
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,427
I need you to answer the door,
Marissa.

532
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,304
What? Answer the door?
What are you talking about?

533
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,639
What door?

534
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,891
Answer the door, Marissa.

535
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,853
Doubt has arrived.

536
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,361
Morning. Um, any way
we could have a chat?

537
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,821
Sure.

538
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,823
What's up?

539
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,492
Um, I need a favor.

540
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,245
My father passed away
earlier this week.

541
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,914
Oh, God, I...
Danny, I'm so sorry.

542
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,875
Were you close?

543
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,127
I barely knew him.

544
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:27,174
Well, that's not true.
I knew him.

545
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,093
And I loved him.

546
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,429
But he left us--
uh, my mom and me--

547
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,389
right before
I went into the police academy.

548
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:38,018
No goodbye. Nothing. Just, uh,
came home from school one day,

549
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,562
and he was... he was gone.

550
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,981
Took off with some woman.

551
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,068
I haven't spoken to him
in 15 years.

552
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,070
So the point is, um,

553
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,073
I, uh, I hired a-a company

554
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,576
to go into his apartment
and box up all his things.

555
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,995
Get them out of there
so the, uh, the landlord

556
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,580
can get the place ready
for a new tenant.

557
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,123
Anyway,

558
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,042
um, they just called,

559
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:06,087
and apparently,
it's about 20-some boxes.

560
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,632
And I just don't have
enough room

561
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,635
for all that stuff
in my tiny apartment, so...

562
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,554
Is there any way
that I could store them here,

563
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,431
out of the way?

564
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,433
(knock on door)

565
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,228
MAN:
Judge is on his way out.

566
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,228
We're coming.

567
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,813
After the other side
questions me,

568
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,566
you get to question me,
too, right?

569
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,235
Yes. That's how it works.

570
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,778
Okay. For your last question,

571
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,781
just make sure you ask me
how I got into all of this.

572
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,659
What makes me care so deeply
for victims of crime.

573
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:40,163
What makes me care so deeply
for people like Kaylee.

574
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,332
Hmm?

575
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,043
(door opens)

576
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,545
McBRIDE:
No evidence of forced entry.

577
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,423
No real alibi
for the time period

578
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,301
during which Kaylee was
sexually assaulted and murdered.

579
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,304
I mean, he claimed
he went on a bike ride,

580
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,181
but no one
actually saw him.

581
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,183
(chuckles):
So, he just seemed

582
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,144
like someone that you would want
to get answers from.

583
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,815
You know what they say
about walking like a duck.

584
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,025
SULLIVAN:
Any more questions

585
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,193
for this witness, Counselor?

586
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,113
Yes, Your Honor. Just one more.

587
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,657
So,

588
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,784
Ms. McBride,

589
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,619
we've all

590
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,162
seen you on television.

591
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,999
We've all seen you in action.

592
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,544
So, how did you come to this?

593
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,631
How did you come to be
a champion of justice?

594
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,385
A champion of victims
like Kaylee?

595
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,433
Like a lot of things in life...

596
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,270
...you never see it coming.

597
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,023
20 years ago,

598
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,692
I was married.

599
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,194
I was living in Indiana.

600
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,030
It was, like...

601
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:59,200
nine or ten weeks after 9/11.

602
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,911
It was Black Friday.

603
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,497
I was doing my patriotic duty

604
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,042
by getting some
early Christmas shopping done.

605
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,586
And my three-year-old,

606
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,380
David...

607
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,092
He was at that in-between age.

608
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,387
You know,
they want to be carried,

609
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,223
and, oh, no,
they want to walk on their own

610
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,600
or they want to hold your hand.

611
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,436
It's like, no, no,
they want to be free.

612
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,732
Anyway, my husband
at the time

613
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,276
was in some other part
of the mall.

614
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,572
And I saw
out of the corner of my eye

615
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,408
this robot pet

616
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,703
that was so popular that year.

617
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,956
I mean,
it was sold out everywhere.

618
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,168
(chuckles softly)
And then there it was.

619
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,798
Magically, right in front of me.

620
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,759
So, I grabbed David's hand,

621
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,845
and we walked over
to where they were.

622
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,226
I remember that the aisle

623
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,772
was so very crowded.

624
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,067
People and shopping carts

625
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,778
and winter clothes.

626
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,154
(sniffles)

627
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,241
(crying):
It seems so stupid now.

628
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,161
Anyway...

629
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,790
I grabbed the toy,

630
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,126
and then I realized that I...

631
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,670
I didn't want David to see it.

632
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,672
I didn't want him to know

633
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:40,135
that Mommy was getting him
the toy and not Santa.

634
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,805
So I switched hands
for a second.

635
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,807
And...

636
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,143
And then I looked down.

637
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,859
He wasn't there.

638
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,863
You can figure out the rest.

639
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,198
It was, like,
me, my husband,

640
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:06,536
the police--
we were all over that mall

641
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,205
until they locked the doors

642
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,292
and made us leave.

643
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,339
(crying):
He was just...

644
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,343
...gone.

645
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,388
BENNY:
I'm so sorry.

646
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,558
I was desperate,

647
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,685
so...

648
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,604
I went to the media.

649
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,981
I didn't even know
what the media was.

650
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,192
But...

651
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,862
I wanted David's picture

652
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,491
and his name everywhere.

653
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:49,329
You know, just in case
somebody saw him.

654
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:54,042
And I-I wouldn't let up.

655
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,961
Not even after my husband

656
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,547
stopped speaking to me.

657
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,927
Not even after he left me.

658
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,845
But...

659
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,223
(whimpers, sniffles)

660
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,310
I just couldn't stop.

661
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,399
My son's...

662
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,779
body washed up
on the shore of the Patoka Lake

663
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,906
a few weeks later.

664
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,075
And...

665
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,745
I guess everyone figured

666
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,914
that was that.

667
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,586
But not for me.

668
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,465
I went everywhere
there was a microphone.

669
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,134
Uh, radio stations.

670
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,469
Colleges.

671
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,557
I just... I kept pushing

672
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,310
because I wanted the scalp

673
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,106
of the man who kidnapped

674
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,276
my son and murdered him.

675
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,904
And then, finally...

676
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,701
I got it.

677
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,707
The police found him.

678
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,459
'Cause, you know,
they never dared stop looking

679
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,297
'cause I was screaming
from the rooftops.

680
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,885
I got justice.

681
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,642
I speak for the dead.

682
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,522
Like my son.

683
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,821
And like Kaylee.

684
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,784
Told you I knew
what I was doing.

685
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,828
That was quite a piece
of testimony.

686
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,622
Any of it true?

687
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,833
Yeah, step on in.
Close the door?

688
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:06,090
I'm here to inform you that WNN
is withdrawing from the case.

689
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,675
Excuse me?

690
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,510
Also that our lawyers are
on the phone with your lawyers

691
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,678
negotiating the dissolution

692
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,013
of your contract
with our network.

693
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,390
As of now,
you are off the air, Madeline.

694
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,643
What's going on?

695
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,353
The man who killed Kaylee?

696
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,854
They caught him
about an hour ago.

697
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:21,356
Confessed to everything.

698
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,857
What are you talking about?

699
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,318
The man who killed Kaylee
was her stepfather.

700
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,986
No, he wasn't.

701
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,739
Look, the word is starting to
get out, and people are starting

702
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,074
to gather
in front of the courthouse.

703
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,408
They're looking for you.

704
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,576
So I'd arrange for
some extra security

705
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,579
to get her out
of here? Yeah?

706
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,381
DANNY: The killer was a
man named Wayne Dixon.

707
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,715
He was working
a construction job

708
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,717
down the street
from the Brennan home.

709
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,429
Dixon had apparently targeted
Kaylee a few weeks earlier.

710
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,764
He was watching
the house

711
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,557
and saw Jeremy ride
away on his bike.

712
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,267
Dixon claims he
approached the house,

713
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,144
said he was a friend
of Kaylee's dad,

714
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,271
and she let him in,

715
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,108
which is why there is
no evidence of forced entry.

716
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,527
Is there anything in there

717
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,278
about how the police knew

718
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,780
to question Dixon
in the first place?

719
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,699
How did he come
to their attention?

720
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,284
Well, according to this,
they got a tip.

721
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,912
Dixon's girlfriend. Why?

722
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,039
We're in court at 11:00.

723
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,709
See if you can find
the girlfriend.

724
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,044
See if you can get her
on the phone with me.

725
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,714
Ms. James, stacked all
the boxes downstairs

726
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,048
in that courtroom
like you told me.

727
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,925
(exhales) Thanks so much
for all your help.

728
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,927
And I almost forgot.
The person who helped pack up

729
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,763
your dad's things wanted me
to give you this.

730
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,931
Thanks.

731
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,058
Have a great day.

732
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,270
BENNY:
Good morning, Ms. Cowley.

733
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,441
Now, could you please
tell the court what it was

734
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,734
that prompted you
to call the police

735
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,402
on your boyfriend
Wayne Dixon?

736
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,945
Uh, yeah, I-I don't know.

737
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:54,741
Um, Wayne was working
construction in Westchester,

738
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,493
and, uh, since he started,

739
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,329
he just seemed different,
distant,

740
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,248
you know,
like he was preoccupied

741
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,459
with something or-or someone.

742
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,961
And then,
a few nights later,

743
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:10,757
I found him out back,
burning his clothes.

744
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,968
I mean,
why would you burn your clothes?

745
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:17,805
He said he got some type of
toxic chemical on them at work.

746
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,642
But he does framing
and drywall. I-I don't know.

747
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,853
It just... it didn't seem right
to me.

748
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,230
Now, is that when
you phoned the police?

749
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,108
Uh, no, no, not yet.

750
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:34,155
Um, what really got me thinking
was, all of a sudden,

751
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,741
he wanted to start watching
Madeline McBride's show

752
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,742
with me all of a sudden.

753
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,578
Like, he never wanted
to watch that show before.

754
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,664
He did not like her.

755
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,832
No offense.

756
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,877
I'm sorry. I-I love you,
and I love your show so much.

757
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,629
BULL:
Go,

758
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,130
Quasimodo.

759
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,130
Um...

760
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,966
So, anyway, he started
watching it with me.

761
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,344
And whenever
she'd bring up the case,

762
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,972
he'd always say how he was
working in that neighborhood

763
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,684
and he knew the house that
she was talking about, and...

764
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,312
BENNY:
And did you know
your boyfriend was interested

765
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,564
in prepubescent girls?

766
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,234
(voice breaking):
I don't know.

767
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,821
We never talked about it.

768
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:22,119
But... whenever we were
at the beach or at the park...

769
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,996
(sniffles)

770
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,582
...I thought
I always saw him looking.

771
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,754
Then I thought
maybe it was just in my mind.

772
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,049
And what did you tell the police
when you called them?

773
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,884
I knew from her show

774
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,471
that Kaylee had DNA on her
that hadn't been identified.

775
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:44,225
So, I called them,
and I offered Wayne's hairbrush.

776
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,727
And how did you know to do that?

777
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,895
From her show.

778
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,773
She talked about how DNA
from a hairbrush caught a killer

779
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,776
she was profiling
a couple years back.

780
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:58,906
Well, it's lucky
you watched her show.

781
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,491
Did you know that tips

782
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,578
from Ms. McBride's viewers
have helped

783
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,372
in solving
over one hundred cases

784
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,749
since the show first aired?

785
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,793
No.

786
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,045
I just think she's really smart

787
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,256
and cool.

788
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,718
Just really good at her job.

789
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,637
(quietly):
Sanctuary.

790
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,682
(sighs)

791
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:42,283
"Dear Danny James, you don't
know me, but my name is Devon.

792
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,620
"Some years ago,
I got to know your father.

793
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,623
"We met and fell
in love in New York,

794
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,083
"and eventually,
I convinced him

795
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,129
"to come live with me
in Louisiana where I'm from.

796
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:59,634
"I did not know at the time
about you or your mother.

797
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:04,305
"Three months after we settled
down in Louisiana,

798
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,767
"your father confessed to me
about the family he had left.

799
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,770
"Told me that he could no longer
bear the guilt

800
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,481
"and needed to go back to you.

801
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:17,068
"I did not stand in his way.

802
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,695
"He told me
when he got to New York,

803
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,989
"your mother refused
to speak to him.

804
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,659
"Warned him that if he
tried to make contact with you

805
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,119
"that she would kill him.

806
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,332
"He told me he found
a small apartment

807
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,668
"and got a job working
teaching physical education

808
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,503
"at an art school.

809
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,673
"Even taught himself to sketch.

810
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,176
"Over the years he tried
to build up the courage

811
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:44,178
"to reach out to you,

812
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,681
"but he told me he was
so filled with guilt

813
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,183
"and shame for leaving you,

814
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,893
"he just couldn't do it.

815
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:55,690
"And then one day,
he was looking out his window,

816
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,191
"and there you were.

817
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,359
"Walking by.

818
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,902
"He figured you were probably
making your way home

819
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,737
"from the police academy.

820
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,658
"He said he saw you maybe ten
or 20 times from that window,

821
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,493
"but then, no more.

822
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,539
"I didn't hear from your father
again for many years.

823
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,834
"And then about three weeks ago,
he called

824
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,211
"to tell me he was very sick.

825
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:20,047
"I flew to New York,
but by the time

826
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,091
"I got there he was already
in the hospital.

827
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:27,221
So I'm writing to let you
know what he told me.

828
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:30,933
"That he wanted you to know
he was terribly sorry.

829
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,728
"And he wanted you to know

830
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,063
he loved you."

831
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,906
(sniffles)

832
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,744
BENNY:
Jeremy Brennan's suicide is

833
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,246
undeniably tragic.

834
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:55,207
And no one will ever
know with certainty

835
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,210
why he decided
to take his own life.

836
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,381
But you know what we do know
with certainty?

837
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,593
That Kaylee's killer was caught.

838
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,596
And that's,
at least in part, due

839
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,765
to Madeline McBride...

840
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,060
for keeping
Kaylee's story alive.

841
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,272
But she was only able to do it

842
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:22,109
because her freedom of speech
allowed her to do it.

843
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,737
See, that's the tricky thing
about freedom of speech.

844
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,572
It-it cuts both ways.

845
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,450
See, people have the freedom

846
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,787
to say whatever it is
they want to say.

847
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,664
And everyone else has
the freedom, uh,

848
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,292
not to listen, not to believe

849
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,127
and to do their own research

850
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,463
and come up
with their own conclusions.

851
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,632
I mean, that's
what Carla Cowley did.

852
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,133
You heard her.

853
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,177
She loved that woman.

854
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,638
But she did not
let the fact

855
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,973
that for over
a month, she heard

856
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,477
Madeline McBride,
who thought that Jeremy Brennan

857
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,937
probably committed the murder,

858
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,855
stop her from picking up
the phone

859
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:02,483
and calling the police
when she was convinced

860
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,152
my client was mistaken.

861
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,029
Look, I...

862
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,823
I get it.

863
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,117
Okay? I get it.
She was...

864
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,493
she was wrong.

865
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,828
Wrong on the facts.

866
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,621
Unnecessarily harsh.

867
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,665
And there were times
I felt that she took

868
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,792
way too much pleasure

869
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,170
in her ongoing campaign
against Jeremy Brennan.

870
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,881
But you know what?

871
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,176
That is not against the law.

872
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,679
And the problem is...

873
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,806
if you don't stand up

874
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,851
for the people you don't
necessarily agree with

875
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,978
when someone is trying
to silence them,

876
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:42,648
then there might not be
the right to free speech left

877
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,318
when they go after the people
you do agree with.

878
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:49,488
WOMAN:
In the matter
of Tracy Brennan v.

879
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,365
Madeline McBride
and the claim

880
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:53,993
of intentional infliction
of emotional distress...

881
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,912
we, the jury,
find Madeline McBride

882
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,706
liable.

883
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,706
(Tracy gasping)

884
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,085
And we award
Tracy Brennan damages

885
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:06,297
in the amount of two
and one half million dollars.

886
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,550
SULLIVAN: Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

887
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,385
thank you for
your service.

888
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,971
Court is adjourned.

889
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,894
Ms. McBride.
I'm very sorry.

890
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,897
Don't be, you
did your best.

891
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,193
But you lost your job.

892
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,069
You're about to get
a boatload of bad publicity.

893
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,614
And today is gonna cost you
two and a half million dollars.

894
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,741
Help me understand.

895
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,826
You seem to have made your peace

896
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,078
with this rather quickly.

897
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,289
Well, two and a half million?

898
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,751
That's why God created
personal liability insurance.

899
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,213
And the boatload of publicity?

900
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,089
I love it.

901
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,633
Good or bad,

902
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,426
it keeps me in the zeitgeist.

903
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:55,095
And it will come in handy

904
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,806
when I sit down
to cut my new deal.

905
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,351
A new deal?

906
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,105
See, people like me?

907
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,399
People who have
the courage to say

908
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,778
what everyone else is thinking
even if we're wrong?

909
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,448
We always draw a big crowd.

910
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,659
(laughs) And trust me,

911
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,036
after today...

912
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,497
the crowd will only
be bigger, huh?

913
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,999
Thank you, gentlemen.

914
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,501
Don't forget
to send me your bill.
