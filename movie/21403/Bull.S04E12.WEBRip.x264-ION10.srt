1
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:09,792
[grunting]

2
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:11,576
DAVIS:
Come on, man!

3
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,494
Escape!

4
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:18,496
Escape!

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,497
Roll out!

6
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,414
Roll out!

7
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,199
Roll out!

8
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:29,681
Get to your feet!

9
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:30,900
Come on!

10
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:35,122
[whoops]

11
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:41,041
[whistle blows]

12
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:47,830
[panting softly]

13
00:00:57,405 --> 00:00:59,363
[exhales]

14
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,148
[breathless]:
Come on...

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,806
[retching]

16
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:19,340
We're heading over to the
dining hall. You coming?

17
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:21,124
Nah, I think I'm gonna
stick around.

18
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:22,473
Still over?

19
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:23,648
Yeah.

20
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:27,652
We'll catch you later, then.

21
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,102
[beeping]

22
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:53,983
DAVIS:
Antonio.

23
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:07,214
You got to be kidding me.

24
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:09,477
You're still three pounds over.
We talked about this.

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,652
You said you had it
under control.

26
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,219
I thought I did.

27
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:13,829
Well, I guess you thought wrong,
didn't you?

28
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:20,531
I'm sorry, Coach.Yeah, I bet you are.

29
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:23,621
But it's your teammates
you should be apologizing to.

30
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,755
If we have to forfeit
your slot, again,

31
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:29,236
do you know how hard it's gonna
be for us to qualify for state?

32
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:32,630
You got two hours
before weigh-ins.

33
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:34,850
Maybe you can still fix this.

34
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:37,069
You know what you got to do.

35
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:57,394
[horn honking]

36
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,099
[panting]

37
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,979
[wheezing]

38
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,074
Antonio!

39
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,252
Hey. Antonio.

40
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,428
Come here. Look at me, kid.

41
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,213
BOY:
Is he okay?

42
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:36,912
Call 911. One of
you guys call 911.

43
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:38,392
CHUNK:
What about Emmet?

44
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,437
Man, if anybody was gonna
go pro, it was gonna be Emmet.

45
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:41,656
Oh, um,

46
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,874
he sort of went pro.

47
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:46,878
He is a sportscaster in Atlanta?

48
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:48,793
Uh, beautiful wife.
No gray hair.

49
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,839
Ah, okay.I hate him.

50
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:53,276
Well, those are all
very hateable qualities.Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,104
Wish I had accomplished enough
for somebody to hate me.

52
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,497
What?
Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,063
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,240
Man, you work at one
of the snootiest prep schools

55
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,850
in America.

56
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,373
I mean, I'm sure there's
plenty of people out there

57
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:04,809
that hate you.Maybe.

58
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,421
I don't know.
I'm a guidance counselor, Chunk.

59
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:08,857
[both laugh]

60
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,643
So, what can I do
for you, Reggie?

61
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,819
Well, what makes you think
I want something?

62
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,605
"Makes you think..." Well,
you called me out the blue.

63
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:20,216
I haven't seen you
in, what, eight years?What...?

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,826
You bring
your briefcase with you.Oh...

65
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,393
What, are you gonna try
to sell me something?

66
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:25,830
I wish. Um...[laughs]

67
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:30,531
Uh, it's a 16-year-old kid.

68
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:31,532
Um...

69
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:37,233
One of the students
at my school, and he died

70
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,017
while he was training,

71
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:40,105
of a heart attack;
he's a wrestler.

72
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:42,804
Seriously?

73
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:45,328
He's a scholarship kid,
uh, Latino.

74
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:48,505
And the school,
they can't get his parents

75
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:50,507
to sign a legal waiver
fast enough.

76
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,990
The school wouldn't think twice
about firing me

77
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:57,819
if they knew I was talking
to a lawyer about this.

78
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:01,649
He used to come by my
office quite a bit.

79
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:04,478
He grew up poor in Newark.

80
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:07,307
Trust me, there are
not many kids like that

81
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,787
at Dartwell Preparatory School.

82
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:11,746
I just want to even up
the odds a little bit.

83
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:14,575
I mean, not that the school's
doing anything wrong.

84
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,664
Everything's
very polished,

85
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,927
very appropriate,
very respectful.

86
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,059
So, what is it
you'd like me to do?

87
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,365
I want you to get involved.

88
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,541
This boy's parents,

89
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:26,326
these are good people.

90
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:27,675
But they're in
way over their head.

91
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,851
I know how Dartwell operates.

92
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:32,114
They're just gonna keep throwing
their fancy lawyers at them

93
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,072
and pressuring them
to sign away their rights.

94
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:36,510
Do everything they can

95
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,686
s-so they got zero chance
of getting a fair settlement.

96
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,689
Just because these people
are poor

97
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:43,517
and their boy was there
on a scholarship,

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,475
that doesn't mean that his life
was worth any less

99
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,911
than any other kid there.

100
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:52,090
Let me see what I can do.

101
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:54,397
CLAUDIA:
He was always good at sports.

102
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,181
At games.

103
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:01,012
But wrestling,
that was his favorite.

104
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:03,232
Last year, he was a freshman,

105
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,408
he wrestled for the public
school down the street.

106
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:08,019
They got into a
state tournament.

107
00:06:08,063 --> 00:06:10,108
First time it ever happened.

108
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:12,459
And everyone knew it
was because of Antonio.

109
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,025
That's when the calls started.

110
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,854
The calls?
Yes.

111
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,466
Schools wanting Antonio
to wrestle for them.

112
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,859
Expensive private schools.

113
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:24,122
Seven of them.

114
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,690
Three even offered
full scholarships.

115
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:28,736
That's very impressive.

116
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,390
We were thrilled.

117
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:33,218
This neighborhood
is not that safe.

118
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,742
The gangs,
they're everywhere.

119
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,396
Especially in the schools.

120
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,876
So why Dartwell?

121
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,271
We went and we looked.

122
00:06:42,314 --> 00:06:45,796
It was beautiful.
[laughs softly]

123
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,798
But most of all,
it was Coach Davis.

124
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,845
He sat there, right
where you're sitting.

125
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,977
Promised us that he would
take care of our boy.

126
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,111
And has the school been
forthcoming with you

127
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,634
since your son passed?

128
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:00,724
Yes and no.

129
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:03,640
Manuel and I have been there
at least a dozen times.

130
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,816
I don't know how many
phone calls we've made.

131
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,516
They all tell us how sorry they
are but there are no answers.

132
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:12,736
And no one will explain
how this happened.

133
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,217
And I've yet to get
a call back from Coach Davis.

134
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,220
His lawyers have probably
advised him not to call you.

135
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:20,875
BULL:
We took a look at the
documents you sent over.

136
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:24,313
The proposed
settlement agreement,

137
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,880
the medical examiner's report.

138
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:29,318
And the examiner found that
Antonio died of heart failure

139
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:34,584
brought on by heat exhaustion
and extreme dehydration.

140
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:39,241
But he also mentioned a
juvenile mitral valve murmur?

141
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:42,418
Yes. That was something
he was born with,

142
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,551
but the doctors said that
that disappeared years ago.

143
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,640
That has nothing
to do with this.

144
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,119
BENNY:
No, I'm sure
you're right.

145
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,992
But in the agreement,
the school's lawyers reference

146
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:54,648
an "undisclosed
congenital heart condition."

147
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,607
It's clear they're trying
to use Antonio's heart murmur

148
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,348
to shield themselves from blame.

149
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,784
BULL:
Regardless of that,

150
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,743
they are offering you
a half a million dollars,

151
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:06,311
which is certainly
a respectable place to start.

152
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:10,141
The catch, of course,
is to get it,

153
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:13,057
or wherever we might land
money-wise,

154
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,886
you are gonna have to sign
a no-fault agreement.

155
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,541
That's what I don't understand.
What does that mean?

156
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,108
It means they're paying you
to go away.

157
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,459
Once you take
the money,

158
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,765
they don't want to hear
from you again.

159
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:26,549
You can't sue them,
you can't complain,

160
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:27,811
you can't go to the press.

161
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:30,335
The matter is closed.

162
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:33,643
Which means that I can't sleep,
I can't eat, I can't breathe.

163
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,079
No.

164
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,472
I don't care

165
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,518
about the money.

166
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,563
I want to know why this happened

167
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,522
and I want to know
how this happened.

168
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:47,570
My son was a healthy teenager.

169
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:50,355
And healthy teenagers
don't have heart attacks.

170
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,010
Well, then the choice is simple.

171
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:55,752
If you folks want to force
answers out of the school,

172
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,580
your only option is to sue.

173
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,278
BENNY:
What we'd do is file

174
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,672
a wrongful death civil suit
on your behalf.

175
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:05,588
We'd effectively be suing
Dartwell Prep School

176
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,198
and Coach Davis.

with none.

No. Of course not.

They will always give it
the benefit of the doubt.

239
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,033
So they'll take
the school's word

240
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,340
that this was just
a tragic accident.

241
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,385

Good afternoon, folks.

Let's start with
a hypothetical.

245
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,919
You are on an airplane.

246
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,269

you've been instructed to

00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,575
put your cell phone
on airplane mode.

248
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:35,015
But you are in the middle of
a very important text exchange.

00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,320
What do you do?

00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,582
Ma'am?

Uh, turn it off.
Safety first.

if you left it on?

00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,591

I'm gonna turn it off.

00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,011
I just silence it.

267
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,448
They pretend like
it's about safety,

268
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,277
but really, it's just about them
not wanting us on our phones.

00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:34,596
a very public ten-year feud
with the health department.

274
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,252
Refers to health inspectors
as navel-gazing bureaucrats

275

Oh, my.
Welcome aboard, Randy.

00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,565
I've been thinking
about tomorrow.

279
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:50,003
I think maybe we attack

280
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,701
the school's narrative
right from the jump.

281
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:56,574
Put our medical expert
on first to dispel any idea

282
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:59,012
that this supposed heart
murmur had anything to do

283
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:00,709
with Antonio's death.
Mm.

284
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:04,713
Uh, I'm leaning towards

285
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,758
making Claudia,
Antonio's mother,

286
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:08,848
our opening act.Why is that?

287
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,111
When Dr. Barnes
takes the stand,

288
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,591
the last thing we need is
for the jury to be wondering

289
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,724
why the Garcias didn't
fill in the school.

290
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:19,380
So we put Claudia on first

291
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:20,947
and have her speak
directly to it.

292
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,166
They didn't tell the school,
because the heart murmur

293
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,909
disappeared sometime after
Antonio's third birthday.

294
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:29,520
So they didn't inform the school
because it was a nonissue.

295
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,348
Exactly.
Ah.

296
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:33,960
And we'll drive the point home
with our own medical expert.

297
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:35,178
BENNY:
Mrs. Garcia,

298
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,963
at what age was Antonio
diagnosed

299
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:39,095
with the mitral valve murmur?

300
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,532
Shortly after he was born.

301
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:44,274
He was three months when
they first noticed it, I think.

302
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:47,190
And after you received
that diagnosis,

303
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:48,844
were you aware of it
manifesting itself

304
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,020
in any way on your son?

305
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:54,415
Did he exhibit any symptoms?
Was he suffering in any way?

306
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,939
No. Never.

307
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,767
But we weren't surprised.

308
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,422
At the time of the diagnosis,
the doctors told us

309
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:02,858
that in all likelihood,

310
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,904
it would have no impact
on him at all.

311
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,689
In fact, in most cases,
it actually disappears.

312
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:10,997
Or "resolves itself,"

313
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,347
which I think is
how they put it.

314
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,218
Mrs. Garcia,
do you recall submitting

315
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:18,047
this health questionnaire
to Dartwell

316
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:20,093
with Antonio's admission
materials?

317
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,746
Yes, I do.

318
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,966
And on the questionnaire,
it asks

319
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,968
if the student had ever
been diagnosed

320
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,535
with a heart condition.

321
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,493
And you answered no
to that question.

322
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,800
Didn't you?Yes, I did.

323
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,584
Why would you do that?

324
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:37,197
Why wouldn't you include the
information on the heart murmur?

325
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,112
When he was five years old,

326
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:41,897
the doctors told us
that it was gone.

327
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,551
He didn't have
a heart condition.

328
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:46,075
All right, I understand that.

329
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:48,730
But the question was asking
if Antonio

330
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:52,342
had ever been diagnosed
with a heart condition.

331
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:55,955
I guess that you can
read it that way.

332
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,829
To be honest, I just
didn't think about it.

333
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:03,353
When he was born, they said
that he had something,

334
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,007
and then they said
that he didn't.

335
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,009
So, in my mind, he didn't.

336
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,620
Every year, he had a physical.

337
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:12,710
And even when the Dartwell
Preparatory School's doctor

338
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:16,236
examined him, before
he began at that school,

339
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,891
he said that my son was
completely healthy.

340
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:23,199
But of course, none of these
doctors anticipated

341
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:27,421
that my son would be made to run
behind a school bus

342
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,684
in a garbage bag,
like some kind of a dog!

343
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:32,165
Your Honor, the witness is
being inflammatory.

344
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,644
She's speculating about
the thoughts of others.

345
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:35,516
She's assuming facts
not in evidence.

346
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,650
Sustained. The jury will
disregard that last statement.

347
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,957
No further questions,
Your Honor.

348
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:50,400
Mrs. Garcia,
before Antonio enrolled,

349
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,923
were you aware of
how competitive

350
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,273
Dartwell's wrestling team was?

351
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,580
We knew that they won a lot.

352
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:59,235
We knew that winning
mattered to them.

353
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,845
We knew that it was
one of the reasons

354
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,630
why they wanted our son.

355
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,501
And it's one of the reasons
that you wanted Dartwell,

356
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,155
because it was one
of the best in the state.

357
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,331
Well, yes, of course.

358
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,855
Every parent wants the best
for their child.

359
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:13,336
So you must have been thrilled
when you got an offer from them.

360
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,339
Yes. We thought we'd
won the lottery.

361
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:17,384
We?

362
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:19,038
Yes, we.

363
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,388
The whole family was thrilled.

364
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:24,478
Antonio was thrilled,
and we were thrilled for him.

365
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:26,523
Well, and not just because
he'd get to wrestle,

366
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,395
but he'd also get
a better education.

367
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,440
Maybe even a chance to go
to a superior college.

368
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,051
Yes, of course.

369
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,662
Has anyone in your family ever
attended college before?

370
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:36,490
CLAUDIA:
No.

371
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:39,623
Antonio would have been
the first.

372
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,148
So there was a lot riding
on Antonio's success,

373
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:45,673
or lack thereof
at Dartwell, wasn't there?

374
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:47,414
For him, for the family.

375
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:50,460
I would think
for any child, yes.

376
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,028
Now, regarding
the mitral valve prolapse,

377
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,291
the questionnaire was not
the only opportunity you had

378
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,076
to disclose this condition,
was it?

379
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,340
There was nothing to disclose.

380
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:03,256
You accompanied Antonio to his
preliminary physical exam

381
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,735
at the school.

382
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:06,085
Did you tell the doctor
about it then?

383
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,869
No, but...

384
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:11,786
You spoke to Coach Davis on
no less than a dozen occasions.

385
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:12,961
Did you ever bring it up
with him?

386
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:14,267
Objection, Your Honor.

387
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,572
Asked and answered.

388
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,532
Not with regard
to Coach Davis it hasn't been.

389
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:19,924
Objection overruled.

390
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:22,057
The witness will
answer the question.

391
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,277
There was nothing to bring up.

392
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,453
The condition no longer existed.

393
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:28,542
And that's why you chose
not to include it

394
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:30,152
in the questionnaire.Yes.

395
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:32,241
Even though you knew
how rigorous

396
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:34,069
the Dartwell
wrestling program was,

397
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,985
you never thought to mention
a heart condition?

398
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,292
That's pretty reckless,
don't you think?

399
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,381
But there was no
heart condition.

400
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,383
Wouldn't you have wanted Antonio
to have the most thorough

401
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:44,819
physical exam possible?

402
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:46,255
Wouldn't you have wanted
that doctor to know

403
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,823
everything about your son?Of course.

404
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,912
MOSLEY:
Didn't they ask you
whether he'd had

405
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:51,826
the measles or the mumps?

406
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,697
Yes, of course.

407
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,525
And even though he no longer
had those diseases,

408
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,744
you answered those questions,

409
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:58,746
didn't you?BENNY: Objection!

410
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:02,271
Relevance. Counsel is conflating
contagious diseases

411
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,534
with genetic...Overruled.

412
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:07,189
Ask the question again, please.

413
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:11,367
Even though he no longer
had those diseases,

414
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:14,283
you chose to answer
those questions.

415
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,198
Didn't you?

416
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,203
The witness will answer
the question.

417
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,209
Yes.

418
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:32,214
MOSLEY:
So you understood the question,

419
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:35,261
but intentionally
misled the school

420
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:37,176
because you feared
if they knew the answer,

421
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,742
they might withdraw
the scholarship.

422
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:41,876
Objection.
Argumentative.

423
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,183
Counselor's badgering
the witness, Your Honor.

424
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,619
I'm trying to establish
that the witness applied

425
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:47,316
different criteria
to different questions.

426
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,057
That the witness knew full well
what the intention

427
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,493
of the question was,

428
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,799
but when it didn't
suit her purposes,

429
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:52,930
she didn't answer it.

430
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:55,106
There was nothing to answer.

431
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,804
He didn't have
a heart condition.

432
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:58,893
You lied, and your son died,
Mrs. Garcia.

433
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,895
[gavel bangs]

434
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:06,335
Ms. Mosley, I have given you
a wide berth of latitude today.

435
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,337
Don't give me reason
to regret it.

436
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,338
I withdraw the question,
Your Honor.

437
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:10,818
Nothing further at this time.

438
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:24,223
[elevator bell chimes]

439
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,441
TAYLOR:
I've been going through
the last three years

440
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,008
of Dr. Barnes'
testimony transcripts,

441
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:29,576
and I've come up empty.MARISSA:
Good news/bad news

442
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:30,794
is she never met

443
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:32,361
a paying gig
she didn't like,

444
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:34,842
so we have four or five more
years of material to go through.

445
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,670
Do we know when
she's gonna testify?

446
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,149
BENNY:
It's hard to say.

447
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:40,413
We could rest our case
as early as tomorrow.

448
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,023
I'll read fast.

449
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,939
Danielle James,
you're next in the Thunderdome.

450
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:46,549
[sighs] You ever
heard the expression

451
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:47,985
"no news is good news"?

452
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,857
Never. Never ever.Hmm.

453
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,685
Well, then you won't find what
I have to say very comforting.

454
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:55,645
So, uh, Antonio's teammates were
not particularly forthcoming.

455
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:58,213
I've never been "no, ma'amed"
so much in my life.

456
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,955
They acted like
the team's regimen

457
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,827
was no big deal,
just standard practice.

458
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,438
Yeah, been there and done that.

459
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,527
They're circling the wagons.
Team first.

460
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,398
That's how competitive
athletes think.

461
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:11,705
Anything else is disloyal.

462
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:14,360
And you, Mr. Palmer,
you dragged us into this.

463
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:15,883
Have you any light to shed?

464
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:18,320
Actually, I did find
something interesting.

465
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,931
It was in the discovery packet
the defense sent over.

466
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:24,152
These are the wrestling
team's rosters

467
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:27,634
and body measurement stats
for the last four years.

468
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,288
And why are we
looking at these?

469
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,159
You see last year's?

470
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:34,858
Now look at the rosters,
then look at each kid's weight.

471
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,556
Now...

472
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,166
look at the year before that.

473
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,298
[clears throat]

474
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,911
They look almost identical.
What's your point?

475
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:45,869
Now go back one more year.

476
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,876
I'm sorry.
They look virtually the same.

477
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,313
You're losing me, Chunk.

478
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,445
Now look at their heights.

479
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:01,320
They're growing, but they're not
changing their weight classes.

480
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,670
Bingo.

481
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,585
BENNY:
Coach Davis,
you have had

482
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:07,674
quite a run at Dartwell.

483
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:10,503
16 years as head coach.

484
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,809
Four years as an assistant
at other schools.

485
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:15,943
I've been very blessed.

486
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,380
BENNY:
And I'm guessing,
in your two decades

487
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,991
of working with young athletes,

488
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:24,778
you have learned a thing or two
about sports nutrition?

489
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:26,083
All part of the game.

490
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:29,609
Ah. So tell me,
how is it possible

491
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:33,395
that during some of your
wrestlers' prime growth years--

492
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:37,094
now, I'm talking
between 14 and 18--

493
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:39,096
they don't seem
to gain any weight?

494
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,578
I'm sorry,
I-I don't know what you mean.

495
00:22:42,622 --> 00:22:43,797
I apologize.

496
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,234
Let me get
a little more specific.

497
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,193
As it turns out,

498
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,935
I was able to get my hands
on the Dartwell wrestling team's

499
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:54,155
varsity roster
for the last three years.

500
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:55,548
Now, Coach Davis, are you aware,

501
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:59,247
according to your own
rosters and weight records,

502
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:04,078
from sophomore to senior year,
on average, only 12%

503
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:08,125
of the wrestlers on your team
changed their weight class?

504
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:09,692
Okay.

505
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:12,608
What-- You don't find that odd?

506
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,610
No. I don't.

507
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,699
A lot of it's genetics.

508
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:18,353
But wrestlers--

509
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,529
winning, competitive
high school wrestlers--

510
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,270
just tend to be
early developers.

511
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:24,620
It's the right body type
for wrestling.

512
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:28,276
So their growth just
isn't terribly dramatic,

513
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,452
because, by and large,
the bulk of it has happened

514
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:32,019
before they start
their work with the team.

515
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:33,281
Really?

516
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:37,241
Well, then,
how do you explain Lance Briles,

517
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:42,029
grew two inches in three years
and didn't gain any weight?

518
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:44,074
Clearly the bulk of his growth

519
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,076
didn't happen
before he joined the team.

520
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,254
Well, Lance, I mean, you're
talking about an outlier there.

521
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,952
That's not a typical situation.

522
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:53,388
I see.

523
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,738
And-and what about Ryan Tissen?

524
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:58,698
Grew four inches
but didn't gain a pound.

525
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:01,657
He an outlier, too?
What about Reese Nichols?

526
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:05,182
Grew five inches,
and no weight gain.

527
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:07,533
[chuckles]: I mean,
wrestler after wrestler.

528
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:10,100
Uh, these stats don't lie.

529
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:14,627
Although 80% of your wrestlers
grew at least three inches

530
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,629
during their time
on your team,

531
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:19,545
only 12% gained weight.

532
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:21,155
Now, I don't know about you,

533
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:24,419
but that seems
pretty strange to me.

534
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,595
Pretty scary, pretty dangerous.

535
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,249
Objection.
Counselor's testifying.

536
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,598
Mr. Colón.

537
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:30,730
Oh, that's all right,
Your Honor.

538
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,383
I'm gonna put a pin
in that for now.

539
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:34,124
Now, Coach Davis,

540
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,952
your success with the team

541
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:38,172
has started to wane
in the last few years.

542
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,043
You even failed

543
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,524
to qualify for state
in the last three.

544
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,961
Very tough competition.

545
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:47,224
Last three years
have been challenging.

546
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,313
Actually, in all three
of those years, you didn't have

547
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:52,229
a wrestler that qualified
in Antonio's weight class.

548
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,622
Am I right?

549
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,972
You had to
forfeit the slot.

550
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:57,234
Yes.

551
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,368
Probably didn't make
your bosses very happy.

552
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:04,372
Now, uh, were you aware
that the school's administration

553
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:06,983
had actually started
reaching out

554
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:08,811
to potential
replacement candidates

555
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,247
for your position?

556
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,249
I'd heard rumors.

557
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:14,034
But that's the nature
of athletics.

558
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:15,818
You don't bring home
the trophies,

559
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,211
people start to look elsewhere.

560
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:18,429
Yeah.

561
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:20,214
Well, it must have been
very exciting

562
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:23,043
when you were able
to recruit Antonio.

563
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:24,827
Great wrestler, perfect weight.

564
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:29,615
I had high hopes for Antonio.

565
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:32,095
Really believed in the boy.

566
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,923
BENNY:
So how did you feel
when he showed up

567
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,882
an inch and a half taller

568
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,884
and eight pounds heavier
than he was last May?

569
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,497
[chuckles]:
Obviously, I was surprised.

570
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,718
But... eight pounds

571
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:48,459
is not an insurmountable goal
for these kids.

572
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:49,635
BENNY:
Oh, I know.

573
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:50,810
Look at all
the athletes

574
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:51,724
you've worked with
in the past

575
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,682
that have grown
inches taller

576
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:56,206
and have gained
absolutely no weight.

577
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,817
And now here we are.

578
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:02,125
Let me ask you a question.

579
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:05,520
If you found out that some of
your athletes were doing things

580
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,958
that compromised their health
to keep their weight down,

581
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:13,049
maybe even put their lives
at risk, what would you do?

582
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:14,660
To stop them, I mean.

583
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:16,400
Objection. The attorney
is badgering the witness,

584
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:17,619
making up hypotheticals.

585
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:18,707
BENNY:
You're right.

586
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,710
Let's not be hypothetical.

587
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,973
Let's get specific.

588
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:27,629
What did you say or do
for Lance Briles?

589
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,283
Or Ryan Tissen?

590
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:31,024
Or Reese Nichols?

591
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,026
Or for that matter,
Antonio Garcia,

592
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,767
when you discovered
that they were getting taller?

593
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,420
Because let's be honest,

594
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,553
you can't get taller
and not gain any weight.

595
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,641
Did you tell them

596
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:40,947
to run behind
the team's bus

597
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,949
in a garbage bag?

598
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:51,479
Witness will answer
the question.

599
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:52,393
BENNY:
Oh, that's all right.

600
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,657
I'm making the coach
uncomfortable,

601
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:57,224
and I don't want to do that.

602
00:26:57,267 --> 00:27:00,401
I withdraw the question.
Nothing further.

603
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:02,185
DALTON:
Let's take
a ten-minute recess

604
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:03,752
and then continue
with defense's

605
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:06,146
cross-examination.

606
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:08,670
Any news on our friend
Dr. Barnes?

607
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,106
MARISSA:
Actually,

608
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,717
Taylor is waiting outside
in the hallway for you.

609
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,196
She thinks she found something.

610
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,024
TAYLOR:
I've looked through

611
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:17,461
everything Dr. Barnes
has ever written or said.

612
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:20,682
Every medical journal article,
every FDA drug testimonial,

613
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:23,119
every speech, every
seminar, every everything.

614
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:26,557
And believe it or not, I found
nothing about heart murmurs.

615
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:28,124
How is that possible?

616
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:30,561
But when I looked through
her corporate accounts,

617
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:33,347
I noticed she almost always
tries to time her vacations

618
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,958
with European
medical symposiums.

619
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:38,744
And then it occurred to me,
could it be that Dr. Barnes

620
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:41,529
offers her opinions
and expertise in languages

621
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:43,531
other than in English
and in countries other than

622
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,620
the United States?

623
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,493
Long story long, my three years
of high school German paid off.

624
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:52,540
Dr. Barnes was a speaker at
a cardiology trauma convention

625
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,977
in Munich two years ago.

626
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,718
This is a transcript
of her speech.

627
00:27:56,762 --> 00:27:58,328
What did it say?

628
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:00,679
I'll spare you
my terrible German accent,

629
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,507
but basically, she says
that mitral valve murmurs

630
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:07,555
have never-- I repeat, never
been shown to increase the risk

631
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:09,296
of myocardial infarctions,

632
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,907
regardless
of other externalities.

633
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:15,998
So in the words of the good
doctor, Antonio's heart murmur

634
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:18,000
couldn't have caused
his heart attack.

635
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:19,306
That's how I read it.

636
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:22,875
Ooh. Speak of the devil
and she will appear.

637
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:26,008
Jason.

638
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:27,227
Sandra.

639
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:30,839
Nice work, Taylor.

640
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:34,495
This is gonna be fun.

641
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,715
So, after examining
the original medical reports,

642
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,587
the toxicology results

643
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,068
and Antonio's personal
medical records,

644
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:44,113
what conclusions
were you able to draw?

645
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:46,115
Well, the first thing
to catch my attention

646
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,945
was Antonio's mitral valve
prolapse, his heart murmur.

647
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,382
That a girl, Sandra.
Come on in, the water's fine.

648
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:53,775
MARISSA:
Bull, you better watch out.

649
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,298
Your smug is showing.

650
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:57,431
MOSLEY:
So, in your
expert opinion,

651
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:59,563
you believe that
Antonio's mitral valve murmur

652
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:01,348
was the cause
of his catastrophic

653
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:03,002
heart event?

654
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:05,787
Actually, no.

655
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:06,875
[gallery murmuring]

656
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,529
No?No?

657
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,183
No?

658
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:12,141
And why is that?

659
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:13,969
The more I looked
at the medical reports,

660
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:18,060
the more I felt as though
something had been overlooked.

661
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:20,062
And then I realized.

662
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:21,847
It was lactic acidosis.

663
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,066
MOSLEY:
Lactic acidosis?

664
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,068
Could you explain to the jury
what that is?

665
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:28,723
Certainly.
When the body is under

666
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,291
extreme physical exertion,
as Antonio's was,

667
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:35,338
and it can't get enough oxygen,
it looks for alternate sources,

668
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,732
alternate pathways
to get its energy.

669
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,821
Anaerobic pathways.

670
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,040
The by-product
of this process

671
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,303
is lactic acid.

672
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:46,045
Lactic acidosis is simply
when this lactic acid

673
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:47,873
enters the bloodstream.

674
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,613
And why is this important?

675
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:53,617
Because in certain cases,
lactic acidosis can interfere

676
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:56,446
with a standard toxicology test.

677
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,535
Like the one performed
during the autopsy

678
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:00,363
in this case.

679
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:03,976
So I had some of the samples
rerun at a private lab.

680
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:05,325
And what were those results?

681
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:06,674
Objection, Your Honor.

682
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,023
This is the first
we've heard of these tests.

683
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,242
I'm going to allow this.

684
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:10,896
But I'll make sure
you have ample time

685
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:13,420
to conduct any confirmations
that you need, Counselor.

686
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:15,465
Overruled.MOSLEY:
And what

687
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,119
did these new tests show?

688
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:21,341
They showed that Antonio
was using amphetamines

689
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:23,125
at the time
of his death.

690
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:26,520
[gavel banging]

691
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,478
Now, how big a factor
would these amphetamines be

692
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:30,654
in causing
Antonio's heart attack?

693
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:32,874
Enormous.

694
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:37,009
In my opinion, it's the
amphetamines that killed him.

695
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:48,237
She's wrong. Antonio
would not use drugs.

696
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,152
I know my son.

697
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:52,024
BENNY:
We could go

698
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,416
to another lab.

699
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,027
An independent lab.

700
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,855
See if we get
a different result.

701
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:59,379
Benny, you don't understand.

702
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:03,644
My boy, he grew up around drugs.

703
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,125
Where we live,
there are drugs everywhere.

704
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:09,563
He grew up stepping over strung
out junkies on the sidewalk.

705
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:12,566
Does anybody honestly believe

706
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,437
that my boy would put in
all this hard work

707
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,875
to get to go to a
place like Dartwell

708
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,442
and then just throw it all away
just to get high?

709
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:22,793
I don't think they think
it's about getting high.

710
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:26,145
Athletes have been known to use
amphetamines to train harder,

711
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:28,582
to train longer,
to push themselves further.

712
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,411
Especially boxers and wrestlers.

713
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:33,021
Athletes looking to cut weight.

714
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,112
Well, then they made him do it,

715
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:40,986
because my son would never do
that unless somebody made him!

716
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:43,031
[Claudia crying]

717
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:47,340
[door opens, closes]

718
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:50,430
I think she's had enough.

719
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,998
I think we've all had enough.

720
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,130
Excuse me?

721
00:31:55,174 --> 00:32:00,701
She'll just keep fighting
and fighting till it kills her.

722
00:32:00,744 --> 00:32:02,485
Or kills us.

723
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,576
He was her everything.

724
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:12,060
He was my everything, too.

725
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,715
But the longer I think about it,

726
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:18,545
Antonio would've done anything
to stay in that school.

727
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,069
What are you trying to tell us?

728
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:24,551
Tell them we'll sign
the agreement now.

729
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:31,210
She'll hate me for the rest
of our lives together,

730
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:34,735
but I'll hate me
if I don't put a stop to this.

731
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:35,910
Manuel...Look,

732
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,173
I know money
won't bring back our son,

733
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:42,003
but at least it'll give Claudia
time to not work.

734
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,483
Time to heal.

735
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,617
Mr. Garcia, I sympathize.

736
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:49,837
But at the moment,
they're winning.

737
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,665
There's no reason
for them to settle.

738
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,841
And a "not liable" verdict
is gonna go a long way

739
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:55,408
to restoring their reputation.

740
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:57,845
Also, there's nothing

741
00:32:57,888 --> 00:33:00,587
I can do without
Mrs. Garcia signing off.

742
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,156
You filed suit together.

743
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,940
There's no way for me
to negotiate a settlement

744
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,420
without her approval, too.

745
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,945
TAYLOR:
More?

746
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,121
Employment records for everyone
in the athletic department

747
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:15,036
for the last seven years.

748
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,908
Every notation,
every complaint.

749
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,475
If there's any history
of amphetamine use

750
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,956
in that department, I have
to believe I will find it here.

751
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,566
What are you two up to?

752
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,787
Taylor got me into Antonio's
e-mails for the last two years.

753
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,355
I'm-I'm looking
for something, anything.

754
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:31,792
I'm going through
the social media accounts

755
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:34,186
of every wrestler at Dartwell,
and by the way,

756
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:36,623
teenage boys need to be rounded
up and kept under lock and key

757
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,016
until their early 20s.

758
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,017
[quietly]:
Oh, man.

759
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:41,628
Hey, if I want
to print something out,

760
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:43,064
do I do it the regular way

761
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:45,501
even though this is
kind of a bootlegged file?

762
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:47,547
Just press Command-P,
and it will be waiting
for you in the printer.

763
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:53,727
Good talking to you.

764
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,990
[phone ringing]

765
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,166
Yes. Oh, yes.

766
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,602
Sure. Send him in.

767
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:02,388
Hey.

768
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:04,564
You come by to give me
a progress report on the trial,

769
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,914
or did someone catch you smoking
out behind the field house?

770
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:09,134
Why didn't you tell me?

771
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:11,092
Tell you what?

772
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:14,704
Been going through
some of Antonio's e-mails.

773
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:17,751
Found this one, from you.

774
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:20,145
"Antonio,

775
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:21,885
"I want to make sure
that I was crystal clear

776
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,496
"in our meeting earlier today.

777
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:26,673
"What you are doing is not only
unfair and unsportsmanlike,

778
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:28,675
"it is extraordinarily
dangerous,

779
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:31,156
"as well as grounds
for expulsion.

780
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,593
"I told you that your secret

781
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:35,769
"was safe with me,
but only if you stayed true

782
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:37,510
"to your promise
and never again repeat

783
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:40,904
this behavior as long as you are
a student at Dartwell."

784
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:43,516
You knew that that boy
was taking drugs?

785
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,996
You wrote this three weeks
before he died!

786
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,694
Yes, but that didn't
have anything

787
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:50,088
to do with his death, did it?

788
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,611
I mean, I got him
to stop, Chunk.

789
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:53,047
That's why I wrote the e-mail.

790
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,875
Okay, the
medical report--

791
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:58,139
the one I read said that kid
was clean when he died!

792
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:01,055
The school just ordered
a new toxicology report, Reggie.

793
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,798
Antonio was using amphetamines
when he collapsed.

794
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:11,413
Oh, man.

795
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:20,161
I'm sorry, Chunk.

796
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:23,556
I would've never reached out
to you had I known...

797
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:26,646
How did you find out?

798
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,476
I guessed.

799
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,304
And then he-he fessed up.

800
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,784
That kid,

801
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:37,744
he would come here
all the time, Chunk.

802
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:39,789
All he wanted to talk about

803
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:43,532
was how he was terrified that
he wasn't gonna make weight.

804
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:45,360
You see, in his mind,

805
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:47,188
if he didn't make weight,
he couldn't wrestle.

806
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:49,886
And if couldn't wrestle, then
they'd take his scholarship,

807
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,584
so he'd have to leave school.

808
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:53,629
[quietly]:
Right?

809
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:56,197
But you know, he was,
he was sweaty, he was jittery.

810
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,068
So I knew he was on something.

811
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:01,028
And... I made him promise
he was done.

812
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,118
And you just took him
at his word?

813
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,903
He's 16. He thinks his life
is on the line.

814
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,775
How could you just
leave it at that?!

815
00:36:08,818 --> 00:36:12,213
I didn't. Yes, I didn't tell
anyone in the administration,

816
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,868
but I did tell
the one person in this school

817
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,044
who I thought
could make him stop.

818
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:18,654
I told Coach Davis.

819
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,403
DALTON:
Okay, Counselors,

820
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:30,362
we will proceed
to final arguments.

821
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,538
Actually, Your Honor, if I may,

822
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:34,583
the plaintiffs
would like to recall

823
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,498
defendant Wayne Davis
to the stand.

824
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,544
Objection, Your Honor.

825
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:39,936
The defendant
has already testified,

826
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,069
and the plaintiff has rested.

827
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:45,594
In light of the testimony
of Dr. Barnes, new evidence

828
00:36:45,638 --> 00:36:47,988
has been discovered
that we did not have the chance

829
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,163
to introduce earlier.

830
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:52,427
All right, Mr. Colón.
I'll allow it.

831
00:36:58,085 --> 00:36:59,434
I want to remind you

832
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:01,567
that you remain under oath.

833
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,395
You may proceed.

834
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,311
Now, Coach Davis,

835
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:08,704
I'm assuming
your team,

836
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:10,271
your school,
has some sort of policy

837
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:11,446
in place with regard to drugs.

838
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,665
Would you mind

839
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,101
sharing that with us?

840
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:15,929
Uh, it's simple.
No drugs allowed.

841
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:17,365
Okay.

842
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,845
And what if one
of your wrestlers

843
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:20,455
were to violate that rule?

844
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:21,978
Uh, immediate suspension.

845
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,632
Pretty
straightforward.

846
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:25,460
So let me ask you a question.

847
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:27,288
You ever drug test
Antonio Garcia?

848
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,508
No.

849
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,119
I don't test my wrestlers
unless I have a reason

850
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:34,121
to suspect something's going on.

851
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,819
Now, when you say
"reason to suspect something,"

852
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:39,953
I'm guessing you mean
unusual behavior.

853
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:42,303
Absences, maybe even
a worried teammate?

854
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:44,740
Yeah, sure. Any of those.

855
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:45,915
BENNY:
Now, Coach Davis,
do you recall

856
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,831
a conversation you had
with Reggie Baumann,

857
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,311
one of the school's
guidance counselors,

858
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:52,531
about Antonio Garcia

859
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:56,143
that took place about
two weeks prior to his death?

860
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:03,672
Um...

861
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:08,068
[clears throat]
It's hard to say

862
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:10,462
without knowing more
about the conversation.

863
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,246
BENNY:
Of course. My mistake.

864
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,074
Let me be more specific.

865
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:16,685
Let me see if this
will jog your memory.

866
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:19,862
Do you recall the conversation
you had where Reggie Baumann

867
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:23,431
told you that Antonio
was taking amphetamines

868
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:25,346
to drop weight
in order for him

869
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,043
to be able
to wrestle in the slot

870
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:28,697
that would be

871
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,786
most advantageous
for you and the team?

872
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:34,877
You told Mr. Baumann
that you'd take care of it.

873
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,662
That ring a bell?

874
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:39,795
The witness will answer
the question.

875
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:51,851
On advice of counsel,
I refuse to answer,

876
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:55,942
and invoke
my Fifth Amendment privilege.

877
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:59,075
[gavel banging]

878
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,687
You didn't take care of it,
did you, Coach Davis?

879
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,907
You didn't confront
Antonio Garcia,

880
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:06,692
a minor in your custody,

881
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:09,216
about his amphetamine use,
did you?

882
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:12,001
Because that would have meant
you would have had to bench him.

883
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:16,005
No. Instead you made him
run behind the team bus

884
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,833
because you needed him
to compete

885
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,835
if you had any chance
of making state.

886
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:22,534
If you had any hope
of salvaging the season.

887
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,753
If you had any chance
of keeping your job.

888
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:26,407
Isn't that what happened here?

889
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:31,369
Again, uh, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to plead the Fifth.

890
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,240
[gallery murmuring]

891
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:36,765
[gavel bangs]

892
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,772
We the jury find the defendants,

893
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:47,036
Wayne Davis and Dartwell
Preparatory School,

894
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,211
liable for the wrongful death

895
00:39:48,255 --> 00:39:49,778
of Antonio Garcia.

896
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:57,525
We the jury
award compensatory damages

897
00:39:57,569 --> 00:40:01,094
in the amount of $300,000
to the plaintiff.

898
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:03,575
Wha-- That is less
than the settlement offer.

899
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,272
But wait, there's more.

900
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:06,447
JURY FOREPERSON:
In addition,

901
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,971
we the jury also award
punitive damages

902
00:40:09,015 --> 00:40:11,365
in the amount of $5 million.

903
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,411
[laughs softly]

904
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,687
[inhales sharply]

905
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:33,996
Hmm.

906
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:37,260
All right.

907
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,524
Here we go.

908
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:42,309
[laughs]

909
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:45,007
Yeah.

910
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,488
CHUNK:
Oh, look.

911
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:50,535
You gave birth
to a sporting good.

912
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:53,451
What do you got, a
Wilson? A Spalding?

913
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:54,495
[laughs]

914
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,497
Can I help you?

915
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,108
Just thought you should know,
I just heard from Reggie.

916
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:01,720
The school officially
fired Coach Davis.

917
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:03,504
Sounds like the police
department is opening up

918
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,245
a criminal investigation
as well.

919
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:08,378
Hmm. And how's
your friend Reggie doing?

920
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:11,251
Mm.
[sighs]

921
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:13,906
He tendered his letter
of resignation today.

922
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:16,952
Said he feels like
he failed Antonio.

923
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:19,477
Well, let him know
he did his best.

924
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,088
I did. And I will.

925
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:26,048
And I appreciate you and
the firm diving in like you did.

926
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,572
Even though there wasn't

927
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:29,574
necessarily anything
in it for you.

928
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:32,490
For any of us. Thank you.

929
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:36,058
Getting ready to be a dad.

930
00:41:36,102 --> 00:41:38,060
Trying to build some good karma.

931
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:40,106
[chuckles]
I hear you.

932
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:42,717
Hey. Let me play
with Bull Junior.

933
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:48,070
Oh-- Oh...

934
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,029
Okay, I'd like
my boy back, please.

935
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,726
Are you sure you can
handle this?

936
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,382
It's like looking in a mirror.

937
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:57,036
[laughs]

938
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,605
Nice.

939
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:01,823
[gasps]

940
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:03,869
