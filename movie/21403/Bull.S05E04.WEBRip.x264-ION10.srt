1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:05,547
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas"
playing)

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,675
That's a very beautiful
engagement ring, sir.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:13,263
Honestly, it's the most
beautiful one we have.

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,099
Shall I take it
in back and wrap it up?

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,601
What if she says no?

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,061
Sir...

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,231
no one is going
to say no to this ring.

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,609
Can you guarantee it?

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,071
On second thought, maybe
you should just let this go.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,617
Why are you torturing
yourself like this?

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,870
Just let it go.

12
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,496
You have me.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,291
You have Astrid, I have Astrid.

14
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,084
I have you.

15
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,670
That's really all
the Christmas present I need.

16
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,092
(gasps)

17
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,515
(phone ringing)

18
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,189
(exhales)

19
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,151
Hello?

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,987
What do you mean
they just started heading up

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,280
before you could stop them?

22
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,157
You're the doorman.

23
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,157
(loud knocking)

24
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,993
Marissa Valerian?

25
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:17,994
Maybe.

26
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,872
Who's asking at 7:15
on a Saturday morning?

27
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,333
I'm Agent Williams with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

28
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,335
This is my partner Agent Ford.

29
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,878
I was wondering
if we could trouble you

30
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,838
to put on some clothes
and accompany us downtown

31
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,632
to Federal Plaza.

32
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,717
(indistinct chatter)

33
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,680
MAN:
Okay, this way,
Mr. Valerian.

34
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,182
Let's go.

35
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,975
Greg? Greg!

36
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,435
Greg!

37
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,522
Do you know what's going on?

38
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,981
What are you doing here?

39
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,192
What am I doing here?

40
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,611
Call your office,
tell them you need a lawyer.

41
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,113
And don't say a word
until he gets here.

42
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:58,034
So on the day
of the baptism,

43
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:00,995
you two, uh, the parents,
the husband and wife,

44
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,832
will stand here to the left
of the baptismal font.

45
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,416
Now, Mrs. Bull...

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,043
Uh, Colón.

47
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:08,878
Ms. Colón.

48
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,005
My-my apologies.

49
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,007
Ms. Colón, you'll be
holding the child,

50
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,009
so I need you to stand

51
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,553
closest to the font.

52
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,179
And you, Mr. Colón,

53
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,098
you'll be...

54
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,098
Bull.

55
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,224
I'm sorry?

56
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,685
You had it right the first
time-- Bull, Dr. Jason Bull.

57
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,813
This is Mr. Colón.

58
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,067
Once again, my apologies.

59
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,443
All right, then.

60
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,029
Uh, husband
and wife here.

61
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,365
Uh, uh, forgive me, Father.

62
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,284
But I'm not her husband.

63
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,244
I'm her brother.

64
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,081
Then why on earth
are you standing there?

65
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,959
Well, I'm going to be
the godfather of the child.

66
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,669
And, um... (clears throat)

67
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,087
well, you pulled me over here.

68
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,548
Ms. Colón and I are
the baby's parents.

69
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,258
And you're not married?

70
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,968
No, not married.

71
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,971
To be fair, we
used to be married.

72
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,641
I mean, we just aren't now.

73
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,019
Maybe you could put in a
good word for me, Father?

74
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,564
We're not here
to talk about us.

75
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,190
This isn't about you and me.

76
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,903
This is about our baby,
this is about purification.

77
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,654
This is about her introduction
to the Catholic Church.

78
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,908
I-I think I'm gonna go,
uh, stand over here.

79
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,076
(phone ringing)

80
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,078
Oh, my goodness,
I'm so sorry.

81
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,121
You should be.
You're ruining everything.

82
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,749
Okay, there you go.

83
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,084
It's off-- all good.

84
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,296
(phone ringing)

85
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,633
It's not me!

86
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,760
BULL:
Oh.

87
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,263
It's Marissa.

88
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,263
Ah.

89
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,265
Mine was Marissa, too, actually.

90
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,142
(phone vibrating)

91
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,852
Hey, do you mind
if I step away for a second

92
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,062
and see what this is all about?

93
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,062
BENNY: Hello?

94
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,481
I'd be thrilled
if you stepped away.

95
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,107
Far away.

96
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,027
Actually, we've covered all
the really important details.

97
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,320
The, uh, essentials.

98
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,823
I am so sorry
to break this up, uh...

99
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,200
That was Marissa.

100
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,619
She's, uh, in some trouble.

101
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,288
I'm gonna head
back home and...

102
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,458
rescue Astrid from
the babysitter. (sighs)

103
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,835
Benny, thank you so much

104
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,170
for coming today
and tell Marissa

105
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:17,632
whatever it is,
if I can do anything...

106
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,514
So tell me
about Marissa.

107
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,141
Sounds like she's
in a lot of trouble.

108
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,310
What kind of trouble?

109
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,310
Alphabet trouble.

110
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,896
The FBI showed up at her
apartment this morning,

111
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,523
and took her
into custody.

112
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,857
Are you serious?
For what?

113
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,318
I-- She claims
she has no idea.

114
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,321
Told them she wouldn't talk
to anybody about anything

115
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,156
without her attorneys
in the room.

116
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,033
God.

117
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,202
I've barely been up
three hours,

118
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,913
and this is already one of
the worst Saturdays of my life.

119
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,542
Well, no offense,
my friend,

120
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,293
but you were
asking for it.

121
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,007
I know you want to get married
and I think, deep down inside,

122
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,591
she does, too, but...

123
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,094
you know, you got to let her
come to it in her own time.

124
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,263
We have a child.

125
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,056
She knows that.

126
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,225
But it's not 1964.

127
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,228
A lot of people do it
without being married.

128
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,230
Not me.

129
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,733
Well, I hate to break
it to you, pal,

130
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,193
but you're doing
it right now.

131
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,572
Mrs. Valerian,

132
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,366
do you know a Douglas Scott?

133
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,576
Uh, not well.

134
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,370
Uh, maybe I was introduced
to him once

135
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,039
over drinks.

136
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:35,251
I believe he bought into
a restaurant my husband owns,

137
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,712
uh, sometime last year.

138
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,090
I think my husband might have
even taken him on as a partner.

139
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,384
That's our understanding,
as well.

140
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,470
Actually, according
to our investigation,

141
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,346
this Douglas Scott fellow
owns a third

142
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,931
of your husband's restaurant.

143
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,267
Your husband retains a third,
and you, Mrs. Valerian,

144
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,477
control a third.

145
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,104
I actually don't
control anything.

146
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,898
I'm his wife.

147
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,233
He opened the restaurant
when we were first married,

148
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,319
so we put it in both our names.

149
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,405
But I can't even tell you
where they keep the toothpicks.

150
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,282
Forgive me, gentlemen, but
where are you going with this?

151
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,493
Where we're going is:
Mr. Douglas Scott,

152
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,244
the Valerians'
business partner...

153
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,789
Well, he's not my...

154
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,789
...is a person known to the FBI

155
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,457
as a regional wholesaler
of high-end narcotics.

156
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,917
What?!

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,418
W-Wait a second, as I told you,

158
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,295
I barely know Douglas Scott.

159
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,964
And my husband would never do
business with drug dealers.

160
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,425
I mean, why would he?

161
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,425
The same reason anyone

162
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,469
does business with anyone--
there's a profit in it.

163
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,430
We believe that as soon as
Douglas Scott bought into

164
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,933
your restaurant, he began to run
cash from his drug operation

165
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,143
through the business--
his dirty money was mixed

166
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,978
with the restaurant's daily
receipts and deposited into

167
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,438
the restaurant's
commercial bank account.

168
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,357
Textbook money laundering.

169
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,985
Uh, but what does any
of this have to do with me?

170
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,739
Gentlemen, we are anxious to be
cooperative in any way we can,

171
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,492
but I think you know as well
as we do, that Marissa Morgan

172
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,870
is a co-owner of this
restaurant in name only.

173
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,789
She had no part in any of this,

174
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,332
and as she told you,
she barely remembers

175
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,834
even meeting Mr. Scott.

176
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,836
Whether she met
Mr. Scott or not,

177
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,963
both she and her husband
realized

178
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,007
a significant improvement
in their finances

is a federal crime.

182
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,305
So is bank fraud,
so is tax evasion.

183
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,016
You're easily looking
at ten to 15 years

our client gets good

187

us what you want,

188
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,527
and then we will tell you
if our client is

189
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,362
interested in helping you.

190
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,656

191
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,325
if your client were willing
to testify against Mr. Scott

192
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,995
and Mr. Valerian, we would
do everything in our power

193
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,498
to minimize, maybe even
dismiss the charges against her.

Before I got into business
with Mr. Scott,

262
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,575
I was one bad weekend--

263
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,870
one big snow storm away
from closing the place.

264
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,706
I guess at the end
of the day, I'm just not

265
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,875
a very good businessman.

266
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,211
The restaurant was
packed every night,

267
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,213
but I was still losing money.

268
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,882
And suddenly this guy sweeps in,

269
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,051
tells me how much
he loves the place.

270
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,762
And he says, "Let me take
over the business part

00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,556
"of the business, give
you a big cash infusion.

on really solid footing.

I'm saying to Marissa:

281
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:04,914
maybe we can start
looking at bigger apartments.

282
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,918

anything fishy?

the restaurant business,

285

and at the end of the night,

286
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,886
we're left
with a lot of stinky garbage.

287
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,722
And over the years,
what I've learned is

288
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,724
that no matter how bad
the mess smells...

289
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,353
...if you're determined
not to smell it...

290

00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,259
she doesn't want
to marry anybody.

352
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,719
She did that.
It didn't work.

353
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,597
She's a Catholic. She takes
that failure very seriously.

354
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,266
It wasn't a failure.

355
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,143
She had a miscarriage--
we had a miscarriage.

356
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,815
Yes, she did. Yes, you did.

357
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,733
But when you needed
each other the most,

358
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,819
you both turned around
and no one was there.

359
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,155
She's not evil, she's not mean.

360
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,907
She would never want
to do anything to hurt you.

361
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,033
She loves you.

362
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:32,913
But she's desperate not to
make the same mistake twice.

363
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,792
Particularly because
there's a child involved.

364
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,252
Now, you're a psychologist.

365
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,170
Certainly you can
understand that.

366
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,633
I'm just gonna
get her some lingerie.

367
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,762
Now you're talking.

368
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,555
(gavel bangs)

369
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,555
HATCHER: Ms. Tyler,

370
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,765
how long have you
been the hostess

371
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,809
at The Briarcrest Room?

372
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,603
Almost two years.

373
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,979
So you were there
when the ownership expanded

374
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,522
to include Douglas Scott?

375
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,316
Yes.

376
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,525
And did you notice any changes

377
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,235
once he joined
the ownership team?

378
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,945
Of course.

379
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,781
I mean, Mr. Valerian
still ran the restaurant.

380
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,492
It was just anything
involving money.

381
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,995
Uh, cashing out, the tip pool.

382
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,788
That was all Mr. Scott.

383
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,875
Also, before Mr. Scott,
we'd take turns

384
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,878
making the bank run
when we closed each night.

385
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,339
The canvas pouch filled
with the night's receipts

386
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,342
that would go into the bank's
night deposit box?

387
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,345
But after Mr. Scott's arrival,
he took care of that.

388
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,513
No one touched
those receipts but him.

389
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,307
Or someone who worked for him.

390
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,683
I see.

391
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,518
And were you aware
that Mr. Scott was not only

392
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,689
in the restaurant business
but also the narcotics business?

393
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,857
You mean drugs?

394
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,025
Exactly.

395
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,904
No. I didn't know he sold drugs.

396
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,864
But I sure knew he liked them.

397
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:49,907
How do you mean?

398
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,662
Well, if you were a pretty girl
and you worked

399
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,873
at the restaurant,
at some point Mr. Scott--

400
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:00,584
or one of the guys
who worked for Mr. Scott--

401
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,002
was going to come on to you.

402
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,881
Ask you if you wanted
to go out after.

403
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,426
Ask you if you wanted
to go home with them after.

404
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,096
And drugs were always
a part of that conversation.

405
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,974
But selling them?
No, I had no idea.

406
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,726
But do you think, perhaps,
Mr. Valerian

407
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,977
might have had an idea?

408
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,563
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

409
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,566
Objection sustained.
Do you want to rephrase?

410
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,068
Actually,
I have no further questions

411
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,986
for this witness at this time.

412
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,574
BENNY:
Ooh. Good morning,
Ms. Tyler.

413
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,912
Have you ever actually seen
Mr. Valerian do drugs?

414
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:40,332
Perhaps with Mr. Scott
or anyone from his team?

415
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,294
No. In fact,
I'm pretty sure Mr. Valerian

416
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,964
was not someone
who approved of drugs.

417
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,424
And what makes you say that?

418
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,760
Well, there was
another waitress. Stacy?

419
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,054
She'd been there
from the beginning.

420
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,890
She was the one
who trained the rest of us.

421
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,059
But when
Mr. Scott arrived,

422
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,730
she started getting
involved with one of his guys.

423
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,941
And for the first time ever,
she started missing work.

424
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:08,068
Sometimes she'd show up
and it was like

425
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,112
she hadn't gotten any sleep.

426
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,283
And ultimately, Mr. Valerian
had to fire her.

427
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,826
And I know
that really upset him.

428
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,204
And the day after
Stacy was fired,

429
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,583
Mr. Valerian
called an all-staff meeting.

430
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,420
Said how heartbroken he was,
how angry he was,

431
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,213
how much he adored Stacy,

432
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,300
but that drugs had no place
in any business he ran.

433
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,093
And if he became aware
of anyone

434
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,554
using drugs, selling drugs,

435
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,848
having anything
to do with drugs,

436
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,975
they would be
instantly terminated.

437
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:42,978
And was Mr. Scott or any
of his people in this meeting?

438
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:47,107
They were all standing
behind Mr. Valerian.

439
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,485
A couple of them
rolling their eyes,

440
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,362
trying not to smile.

441
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,074
I'm sure Mr. Valerian
had no idea.

442
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,951
I'm sorry.

443
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,829
BENNY:
Thank you.

444
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,875
I have no further questions
for this witness, Your Honor.

445
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,003
OLLIS:
The witness
is excused.

446
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,964
(gavel bangs)

447
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,964
Let's take a
15-minute recess.

448
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,014
BULL:
Hello? Is anybody here?

449
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,350
♪ ♪

450
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,477
(chuckles)

451
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,647
I remember you.

452
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,151
You didn't, by any chance
bring any food, did you?

453
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,778
Or... (sighs)

454
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,196
a cold martini?

455
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,782
I knew I forgot something.

456
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,038
You're home late.

457
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:47,876
Well, I had to return a
Christmas gift I got for you.

458
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,712
Mm.

459
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,712
Something I know
deep down inside

460
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,130
you really want,

461
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:56,093
but that you're just not
ready to accept from me yet.

462
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,387
Oh, my goodness.

463
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,387
Mm-hmm.

464
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,597
I wonder what that could be.

465
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,057
A table saw.

466
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,101
(laughs softly)

467
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,019
You so get me.

468
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,521
Mm-hmm.

469
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,441
So wait, I'm not
getting anything now?

470
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,736
Oh, I think it's gonna be a
mostly socks and underwear

471
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,405
kind of Christmas for you.

472
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,198
Socks?

473
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,117
Support hose.

474
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,743
Nothing but the best.

475
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,037
And underwear?

476
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,205
Flannel.

477
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,208
Made from real flan.

478
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,211
Mmm.

479
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,797
So...

480
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,800
what is our mini, artificial
Christmas tree doing in here?

481
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,802
Because I thought we
decided it was gonna live

482
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:42,055
in the living room where all
the artificial trees live?

483
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,267
(groans):
Yeah, that was the plan,

484
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,102
but then, once I set it up,

485
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,605
Astrid just refused to be
anywhere it wasn't.

486
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,440
So I just picked it up
and put it in here

487
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,567
and she fell asleep right away.

488
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,567
Huh.

489
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,860
No problem.

490
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,198
So, how goes the trial?

491
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,994
Oh, well, from a
legal standpoint,

492
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,455
not a huge breakthrough today,

493
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,833
but just before
court adjourned,

494
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:14,129
the estranged wife squeezed
her husband's hand.

495
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:17,090
And then, they actually turned
and looked at each other

496
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:21,136
in the eye for the first time
since the trial began.

497
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,262
It was the closest
thing I've seen

498
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,014
to a Christmas
miracle all season.

499
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,557
Hmm.

500
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,603
(laughs)

501
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,146
(gavel bangs)

502
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,439
HATCHER:
Mr. Walker,

503
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,815
can you tell the court
who you work for?

504
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,983
I'm an employee

505
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,152
of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

506
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,487
And what is it you do for them?

507
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,031
I'm what's called
a forensic accountant.

508
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,407
And what does that entail?

509
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,660
I'm kind of a money detective.

510
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,495
I examine bank records,

511
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,498
tax records, all kinds
of financial records

512
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,042
and see what kind
of story they tell.

513
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,169
Are there any irregularities?

514
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,880
Has some sort of criminal
malfeasance taken place?

515
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,173
And did you have occasion
to examine

516
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,300
The Briarcrest Room's
financial records?

517
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,343
I did.

518
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,136
And did they tell you a story?

519
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,513
They certainly seemed to.

520
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,058
In the ten months' worth
of records we examined,

521
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,520
we concluded that at least
$2,000 a day in funds

522
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:15,023
derived from sources that were
clearly not the restaurant

523
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,360
were being deposited in the
restaurant's account as though

524
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,904
part of the
day's receipts.

525
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,906
HATCHER:
No further questions,
Your Honor.

526
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,827
So, Mr. Walker.

527
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,329
Let me ask you something.

528
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,832
How many years did you have
to go to school

529
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,210
to become, uh,
what do you call yourself?

530
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,837
A forensic accountant?

531
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,047
Four years of undergrad work,

532
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,216
and then a two-year MBA program.

533
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,926
That's impressive.

534
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,178
And how long did you say
you studied

535
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,222
the financial records
of the restaurant?

536
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,225
Well, my office and I
went through them

537
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,395
with a fine-tooth comb
for over 15 weeks.

538
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,105
So almost four months.

539
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,565
Wow.

540
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,234
A-And not just you
but your entire team,

541
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:02,779
uh, went through these documents
to piece together

542
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,366
Douglas Scott's money
laundering scheme. Ha.

543
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,577
And yet, you believe
my clients--

544
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,039
two people who have had
exactly zero time

545
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,541
studying forensic accounting--

546
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,710
knew everything that
was going on around them?

547
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,171
WALKER:
Well, in May,

548
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,882
before Douglas Scott
bought into the business,

549
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,218
the restaurant turned 605 tables

550
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,305
for a gross monthly loss
of $7,000.

551
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:32,726
In June, one month after
Douglas Scott became co-owner,

552
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,229
the restaurant turned
545 tables.

553
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,066
Now, that's 60 tables less,

554
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,652
yet somehow they suddenly had
a $30,000 profit.

555
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,738
BENNY:
But you're not
answering my question.

556
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,239
WALKER:
I'm trying to.

557
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,992
This trend of fewer tables

558
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,953
yet greater profits continued
for the next ten months.

559
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,290
How is that possible?
The restaurant didn't

560
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,958
raise their prices.

561
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,795
You don't need to be
a FBI agent

562
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,588
nor a trained CPA
to do the math.

563
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,591
It just doesn't add up.

564
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,842
(phone vibrates)

565
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,563
Tough day, but that's
to be expected.

566
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,817
Prosecution's rested.

567
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,485
Tomorrow we
present our case.

568
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,153
You ready to take
the stand?

569
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,489
Ready as I'll ever be.

570
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,367
Hey, we're, uh, heading uptown.

571
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,076
Anybody need a ride?

572
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,621
Actually,
I feel like walking.

573
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,127
No, I'm, uh, heading
the other way.

574
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,211
But thanks.

575
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,088
See you
in the morning.

576
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:57,102
How could you
not have known?

577
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,230
How could you
not have known?

578
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,982
Oh, come on, Greg.

579
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,651
You know I never saw
a penny of that money.

580
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,028
It went into the joint
bank account.

581
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,197
(stammers) You paid the bills,
you wrote all the checks.

582
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,699
Yeah, "joint."

583
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,409
That means the two of us.

584
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,577
You could have looked
at the statements.

585
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,745
They'd sit on the kitchen table
for the entire month.

586
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,539
It's your restaurant.

587
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,499
I don't know how many tables
you're turning.

588
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,168
I don't know if you're making
a profit or not.

589
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,752
You don't tell me those things.

590
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,045
You don't ask.

591
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,173
And suddenly,
everything is better.

592
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,717
You're making money,
and it doesn't occur to you

593
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,552
to find out why? How?

594
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,387
Hell no.

595
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,723
When things are good, no,
I don't need to know why.

596
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,475
I just need for them
to not stop.

597
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,938
But you wouldn't
understand that.

598
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,650
No, I don't understand
that at all.

599
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,613
I trusted you.

600
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,698
It's like
the other day.

601
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,575
You said you
smelled the garbage,

602
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,827
but you didn't do
anything about it.

603
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,454
Why would I?

604
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,496
We were winning.

605
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,500
You don't check the weather
when the sun's out.

606
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,755
I do.

607
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,257
Especially if I've made plans
with someone

608
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,635
that I supposedly care about.

609
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,305
♪ ♪

610
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,486
So...

611
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,404
you made her something?

612
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,781
For Christmas?

613
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,741
Why do you sound so surprised?

614
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,535
I'm a clever, creative person.

615
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,664
Uh, well,
you're a 50-year-old man.

616
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,791
She's a 40-year-old woman.

617
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,584
What did you make her?

618
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,462
A birdhouse made out of
Popsicle sticks?

619
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,466
We're here.

620
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,803
Oh, my God. I'm not sure
I'm ready for this.

621
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,805
See you all inside.

622
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,517
(door opens, closes)

623
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,394
Now, before you go in there

624
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,813
and take the stand this morning,

625
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,524
I need to talk to you
about a couple of things.

626
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,652
As my client,

627
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,948
I need to remind you
to tell the truth.

628
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,284
Of course.

629
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,284
No.

630
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,537
It's more complicated than that.

631
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,331
The only certainty
in all this is

632
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,833
that they are gonna
ask you questions

633
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,501
that will pit you against Greg.

634
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,795
Questions that will make you
at least consider

635
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,171
fudging the truth,

636
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,340
shading the truth
to protect yourself,

637
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,175
to protect Greg.

638
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,220
It's a trap.

639
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,513
Bull, I am not a liar.

640
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,682
I am certainly not gonna lie
under oath.

641
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,559
And now is the part where
I talk to you like a friend.

642
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,812
Yes, they are trying
you and Greg together.

643
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,441
But the jury will be instructed
to decide your cases separately,

644
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,568
which means that Greg
can be found guilty

645
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,028
and you can be found innocent.

646
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,237
Not that I'm wishing that
on Greg.

647
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,489
God, no. Me, either.

648
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,489
But I believe

649
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,408
in your innocence.

650
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,077
And we need that jury
to believe in it, too.

651
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,622
And the way we get them
to believe in your innocence

652
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,416
is by believing you,

653
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,836
which means that you
are gonna have to share...

654
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,005
everything.

655
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,549
You're gonna have to
share it all,

656
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,217
even the embarrassing parts.

657
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,886
There are no embarrassing parts.

658
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,429
Oh, yes, there are.

659
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,599
You're a real smart person,
Marissa Morgan.

660
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,894
And that's not something you can
hide or cover up with makeup.

661
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,771
Smart just oozes out of you.

662
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,732
But you loved this man.

663
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,526
You trusted this man.

664
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,404
And that notwithstanding,
either he's far more ignorant

665
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,531
than he lets on or,
more than likely,

666
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,867
he was able
to persuade himself

667
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,744
that he didn't need
to confide in you

668
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,871
when he sensed something
illegal was going on.

669
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,375
Even though he was playing
with your money,

670
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,460
with your reputation.

671
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,380
With your future.

672
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,717
I'm sorry. It really is
as simple as that.

673
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:04,057
But the jury will never know
unless you tell them.

674
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,896
I guess we should get in there.

675
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:10,897
BENNY:
So...

676
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,774
you signed this?

677
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,567
Apparently, I did.

678
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,777
But you didn't read it?

679
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,613
No, not that I recall.

680
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,240
And you signed this?

681
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,409
Looks like I did.

682
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,744
Um, yes, that's my signature.

683
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:29,165
How about this
transfer of ownership?

684
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,960
Signing away a third of
your business to Douglas Scott.

685
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,587
You remember signing this?

686
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,799
Honestly, no.

687
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,009
I'd come out to the kitchen
table in the morning,

688
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,636
there'd be things to sign.

689
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,805
Little yellow Post-its
all over them.

690
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,307
My husband ran a restaurant.

691
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,517
He slept from 3:00
in the morning

692
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,352
until 11:00 in the morning.

693
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,647
I slept from 10:00 at night
until 6:00 the next day.

694
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,859
There was no time to discuss
what I was signing.

695
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,318
By the time he was awake,

696
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,653
I'd already been at work
for three hours.

697
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,155
It's just the way we did it.

698
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,823
Hmm. One last question.

699
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,159
You know,
the prosecution contends

700
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,660
that you profited handsomely

701
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,830
from this arrangement
with Mr. Scott.

702
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,540
Is that true?

703
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,626
It may be.

704
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,879
I really have no way of knowing.

705
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,006
All the money went
into a joint account

706
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,884
that my husband
and I had together.

707
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,511
Frankly, I almost never
looked at it.

708
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,138
Never even checked the balance.

709
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,348
When we'd talk,

710
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,517
he'd say the restaurant
was doing well.

711
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,060
We were doing well.
That's all he said,

712
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,688
and that's all I needed to hear.

713
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,523
Bills would come in.

714
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,817
None of them were overdue.
He wrote the checks.

715
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,487
I-I really didn't give it
much thought.

716
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,072
Thank you, Mrs. Valerian.

717
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,783
No further questions,
Your Honor.

718
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,163
HATCHER:
Mrs. Valerian,

719
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:53,666
you worked as a
senior-level analyst

720
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,544
for Homeland Security for
almost nine years, didn't you?

721
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,629
I did.

722
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,006
That's one of those jobs
where I have to believe

723
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,925
that the devil is
in the details.

724
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,051
Wouldn't you agree?

725
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,594
I would.

726
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,514
Tons of reading.
Scrutinizing documents.

727
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,724
Tens of hours of research.

728
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,727
And yet you're testifying

729
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,396
that you signed
countless contracts,

730
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,899
invoices, checks,
transfers of ownership

731
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,360
without ever once
actually looking at them?

732
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,779
Yes.

733
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,739
HATCHER:
And am I also to believe

734
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:26,574
that your husband
tells you

735
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,117
he's about to bring in
a new partner

736
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,036
to help run his business,
and you--

737
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,914
with all the resources of
the Trial Analysis Corporation

738
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,708
for whom you work, with all
of your past friendships

739
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,627
and relationships
at Homeland Security--

740
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,672
don't even bother to run
a background check on this man?

741
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,757
I did not.

742
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,384
For a woman
with your background,

743
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,802
that seems rather unlikely.

744
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,555
I don't know what to say.

745
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,557
It-it was my husband's
restaurant.

746
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,599
It was my husband's thing.

747
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,601
I trusted my husband.

748
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,311
Guess I'm a fool.

749
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,608
We were married.
I-- We are married.

750
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,569
Married to each other
for the second time,

751
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,279
as a matter of fact.

752
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,117
What is love if not surrender?

753
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,120
And what is surrender
if not the certainty of trust?

754
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,331
The absolute belief
that this other person

755
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,666
always has your back,

756
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,085
and you always have theirs?

757
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,629
HATCHER:
You're not answering
my question.

758
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,922
MARISSA:
I'm trying.

759
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,300
When we got married
for the second time,

760
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:29,012
I felt I needed to show him
that this time was forever.

761
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,639
So I signed over half
of my condominium--

762
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,850
by far my most
valuable possession--

763
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,810
to him.

764
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:37,854
My idea.

765
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:41,649
I wanted Greg to know
that what was mine, was his.

766
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,361
And then,
without me saying a word,

767
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,864
he signed over half
his ownership

768
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,867
in his new restaurant--
his baby-- to me.

769
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,993
Again...

770
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,662
the question is,
why wouldn't you run

771
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,664
a background check on a man
you were about to go

772
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,541
into business with?

773
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,006
I trusted my husband.

774
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,592
I trusted his judgment.

775
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,135
I knew he trusted mine.

776
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,304
I just wanted
to return the favor.

777
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,139
When it came to my condominium,

778
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,350
if there was
an unexpected assessment--

779
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,518
the-the building roof
started to leak last year.

780
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:21,272
That was $22,000
that we hadn't planned on.

781
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,024
I would just write out
a check and put it

782
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,984
on the kitchen table
for him to sign.

783
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,694
And he would just sign it.

784
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,197
No conversation.
Just blind trust.

785
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,200
I wanted to redo
the kitchen, and I did.

786
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,327
Not a peep.

787
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,704
Except to say
how much he loved it.

788
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,707
And, yes, could we get
the workers to show up

789
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,751
a little later
so he could sleep.

790
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,045
(chuckles softly)

791
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,339
That's all well and good,
Mrs. Valerian.

792
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,715
But you and your husband
ran a business

793
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,676
that consistently lost money.

794
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,719
And then one day it didn't.

795
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,389
And it's your testimony
that you never felt compelled

796
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,765
to ask about it?

797
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,518
And he never offered
an explanation?

798
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,609
Actually, I did finally ask him.

799
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,570
Just the other day,
right after court.

800
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,739
HATCHER:
You asked about how
the business was suddenly

801
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,742
making money when it was
seating fewer customers?

802
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,952
I did.

803
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,787
And what did he say?

804
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,833
He said he didn't know.

805
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,710
He said he didn't care.

806
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,173
He said you don't ask about
the weather when the sun is out.

807
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:34,011
You do if it's out
in the middle of the night.

808
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,224
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

809
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,601
OLLIS:
The witness
is excused.

810
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,229
Let's take a 15-minute break.

811
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,649
I did the best I could.

812
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,444
You hung me out
to dry, Marissa.

813
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,279
No, you hung me out to dry.

814
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,448
That's why we're here.
Or have you forgotten?

815
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,162
(slaps table)

816
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,794
Um, he knows he's the next
witness, doesn't he?

817
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,880
You better ask the judge if
she'll adjourn for the day.

818
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:12,341
I have a feeling Greg
doesn't plan on coming back.

819
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,469
(phone ringing)

820
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,515
(grunts)

821
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,311
Hello?

822
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,271
GREG:
Dr. Bull. It's Greg Valerian.

823
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,898
I just wanted to let you know,

824
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,983
after what happened today
in court,

825
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,528
I'm exploring my options.

826
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,322
I'm sorry, Greg,
can you repeat that?

827
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,823
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

828
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,450
I mean I no longer think
it makes sense

829
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,577
for me to be represented
by your firm.

830
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,871
By the firm that employs
the woman

831
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,457
I'm in the midst
of getting a divorce from.

832
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,460
I just didn't want you
to be blindsided in the morning.

833
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,670
Okay, Greg, can we talk
about this for a second?

834
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,339
I think you're making a mistake.

835
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,715
(chuckles)
That's okay.

836
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,509
Won't be the first.

837
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,344
Good night, Dr. Bull.

838
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,471
(exhales)

839
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,690
Now, my suspicion is,
when we get inside,

840
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,151
Greg will make a plea
for new representation,

841
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,528
maybe even a whole new trial.

842
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,654
That's crazy.

843
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,532
We're two-thirds of the way
through the proceedings.

844
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,034
Well, I'm sure that'll be the
judge's point of view as well.

845
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:22,411
He wants to stretch this out,

846
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,914
just like he's done
with our divorce.

847
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,082
(sighs)

848
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,251
Tell me one more time
how smart I am?

849
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,546
How'd I manage to do it?

850
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,757
Pick such a selfish person
to spend my life with?

851
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,884
Twice!

852
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,262
How could I have been so wrong?

853
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,013
I thought he actually
had my back.

854
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,099
I thought he actually
cared about me.

855
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:48,020
We should get inside.

856
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,022
OLLIS:
Before we begin
today's testimony

857
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,942
or invite the jury in,
I understand that the A.U.S.A.

858
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,735
would like to address the bench.

859
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:59,031
Your Honor,
I need to inform the court

860
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,701
that one of the defendants,
Greg Valerian,

861
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,953
reached out to me
early this morning

862
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,914
to inform me that he has
served verbal notice

863
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,083
that he wishes
to no longer be represented

864
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,626
by either
the Trial Analysis Corporation

865
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,297
or its attorney,
Mr. Benjamin Colón,

866
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,550
and moving forward,
chooses to represent himself.

867
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,094
OLLIS:
I don't see
Mr. Valerian here,

868
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:23,431
but if you would please
let him know that his request

869
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,808
is something I'm going to need
to take under advisement,

870
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,268
and given that this trial
is almost over...

871
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,644
There's more,
Your Honor.

872
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,938
Subject to your approval,
of course,

873
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,775
Mr. Valerian has offered
