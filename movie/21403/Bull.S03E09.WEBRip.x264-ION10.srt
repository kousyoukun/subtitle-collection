00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:24,199
But what are we
gonna do about you?

162
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,680
There's nothing to do.

163
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,465
They've got me dead to rights.

164
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,076
I've been here seven years;
no papers.

165
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,601
No papers, nothing?Hey...

166
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:37,473
trust me,
it wasn't the plan.

167
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:40,520
There was a time

168
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:45,046
I was a pretty big deal
surgeon back home.

169
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,874
I made a great living.

170
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:50,486
I, uh, did work that mattered.

171
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,532
I helped people and was happy.

172
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,711
And then...

173
00:08:57,754 --> 00:09:00,017
my home started changing.

174
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,587
Violence. Crime.

175
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,197
Poverty.

176
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:07,547
Hate.

177
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,549
It was everywhere.

178
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:12,595
And the government didn't mind;
they were doing fine.

179
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,205
Suddenly...

180
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:17,469
doctors, scientists,
any other educated people,

181
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,602
we became the bad guys,
you know?

182
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:22,605
It's like they thought
that anyone who could think

183
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,652
might question the regime.

184
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:29,351
So they eliminated the thinkers.

185
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,224
You know, my best friend
in medical school...

186
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,315
Government came,
middle of the night,

187
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:40,492
snatched him from his home,

188
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:43,408
put him on display
in the public square

189
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,281
and executed him.

190
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:50,285
Just like that, in front
of his wife and his little girl.

191
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:52,548
Oh, my God.

192
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:56,160
How did you get out?

193
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:57,640
When you have money

194
00:09:57,684 --> 00:10:00,338
and there's something
you want...

195
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,560
I found a lawyer.

196
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,216
I gave him every cent I had.

197
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,697
He promised
he could get me citizenship,

198
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,615
he promised he could get me a
spot at the university hospital,

199
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,878
that he could get me
recertified

200
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,967
in the United States.

201
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,971
He-he made it sound like
I would just be moving,

202
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,668
you know, but to
a better neighborhood,

203
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:28,410
that it might take me
a while to fit in,

204
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:29,803
but in time...

205
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:33,545
And, of course,
none of that was true.

206
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,593
He got me a tourist visa.

207
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,814
It was good for two weeks.

208
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:43,686
And you couldn't go back.

209
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,340
Not if I cared
about staying alive.

210
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:46,733
[lock buzzes]GUARD: All right,
time's up.

211
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,299
They told me you're going
to immigration court.

212
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,301
Do you have a lawyer?Yeah, absolutely.

213
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:52,216
I met him at the country club.

214
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,653
Everybody says he's great.
He's really nice.

215
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,176
It's not funny.

216
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,528
Why are you staring at me?

217
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:03,097
I'm just trying to lock in
your face. Your smell.

218
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,622
It might be a while, you know?

219
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,109
CHUNK:
$10 million?

220
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,372
That's an awful lot of money
for some acrylic on a canvas.

221
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,374
That's what a jury is
going to think, too.

222
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,942
They're gonna think this
is all about the money.

223
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:25,467
Funny thing is our client
doesn't need the money.

224
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,557
Geoffrey Schreiber is a VP

225
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,950
of International Marketing

226
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:31,429
for a huge hedge fund.

227
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:33,214
Splits his time between New York
and Frankfurt.

228
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,824
Even owns his own jet.

229
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,434
CHUNK:
Be that as it may,

230
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:39,002
I've never met a rich person
that didn't want more money.

231
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,700
And I'm sure the attorney
for the museum

232
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,136
is gonna make that point,
as well.

233
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,790
Our position will be...

234
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,923
the value of the portrait
is irrelevant.

235
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,664
It's what it represents
that matters,

236
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,361
and what it represents

237
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:53,016
is the indestructibility
of these two people's love.

238
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,670
They married,

239
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,759
divorced, and then planned
to marry again.

240
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:59,501
And the only thing
that stopped it from happening

241
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,285
was Melanie's death.

242
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:02,852
And in anticipation of that,

243
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,985
as a symbol of what they shared,

244
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:07,857
she wanted the painting
to reside with him,

245
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,598
forever and always.

246
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:12,732
Being the new kid, just curious.

247
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,603
This sounds like a tough sell.

248
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,605
How do you find jurors

249
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,476
who are gonna be sympathetic
to our client?

250
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,871
Excellent question. Ideally,
we'll be talking to people

251
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:25,875
who might be best described
as possessing evolved morality.

252
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,311
Evolved morality?

253
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,357
Smart people who understand
that romance,

254
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,795
that love,
that the ability to feel deeply

255
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,318
is all part
of the human equation,

256
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:37,408
and that if the law is made
to serve people,

257
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:38,975
there has to be
some accommodation

258
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,282
for their humanness.

259
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:43,806
That the answer
to every question is not found

260
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,809
within the four corners
of a document.

261
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:49,159
Morning, sir.Morning.

262
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,988
Let's imagine you pull into
a commercial parking lot.

263
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,947
You take a ticket,
find your space.

264
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,513
As you're getting out
of your car,

265
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,515
you can't help but notice
a big sign.

266
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,214
"We are not responsible
for damage to your vehicle."

267
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:02,999
You attend to whatever business
brought you to the neighborhood,

268
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:05,828
and when you get back,
your car window has been smashed

269
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:08,222
and some packages you had in
the back seat have been stolen.

270
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:09,876
What do you do?

271
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,878
Nothing you can do.

272
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:15,925
Like the sign says,
they're not responsible.

273
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,103
Your Honor, the defense
would like to thank

274
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:22,410
and excuse this juror.

275
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:23,890
Just because something's
written down,

276
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:25,456
whether it's a sign on the wall

277
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,110
or the particulars
contained in a will,

278
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:29,634
doesn't mean
you can't challenge it.

279
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:33,116
And people with an evolved
morality understand that.

280
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,205
How about you? It's your car.

281
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:38,121
Your window that gets smashed,
your things that get taken.

282
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,470
Do you have any recourse?

283
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:42,778
Is there one of those signs up?Nope. But...

284
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,475
the same warning is printed
on the back of the ticket

285
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,912
you take from the machine
at the entrance

286
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,217
that lets you in.

287
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,219
Oh.

288
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:51,221
I think you just have to eat it.

289
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,922
I don't care what it says
on the sign

290
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:59,839
or the back of the ticket.
I paid to park my car.

291
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:03,016
I have a right to expect
the place to have security.

292
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,845
I have the right to expect
the place to be well-lit,

293
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,281
to be safe.

294
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,587
You don't get to opt out
of your responsibility

295
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:12,329
just 'cause you put
some mumbo jumbo on a sign.

296
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,550
This juror is acceptable

297
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:16,986
to the defense,
Your Honor.

298
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,815
Now if we can just get four
or five more like him.

299
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,557
Are you the respondent
in this removal proceeding,

300
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,559
Gabriel Almonte?

301
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:25,908
Yes, I am, Your Honor.

302
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,127
Will you be needing
a translator?

303
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,085
No, Your Honor.

304
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,913
JUDGE: Mr. Almonte,
you're accused

305
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,872
of being an undocumented alien
living in the United States.

306
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:33,960
Do you understand that?

307
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:35,700
I do.

308
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,354
This is an immigration court,

309
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:39,922
and, as such, there is no right
to a court-appointed attorney.

310
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,882
Do you have representation?

311
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,362
No, Your Honor, I do not.

312
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:46,494
Would you like to present
a defense

313
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:47,843
before I rule on your removal?

314
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,976
Excuse me?

315
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:52,456
It seems as if you've
already made up your mind.

316
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,894
You already know you want
to send me back, right?Mr. Almonte,

317
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,026
unless you have proof
of citizenship

318
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,506
or a defense against removal,

319
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:01,988
then, yes, I'm ready
to rule right now.

320
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,859
[door opens]

321
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,863
Oh. My apologies, Your Honor.

322
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,953
Coming from another case
at the courthouse across town.

323
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:15,088
Uh, Benjamin Colón,
representing Gabriel Almonte.

324
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,916
Mr. Colón, I was just
asking your client,

325
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,570
who apparently didn't
know he had a lawyer,

326
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:20,963
if he would be presenting
a defense

327
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,617
to the accusations against him.

328
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,967
Yes, Your Honor.
Well, we will be filing

329
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,491
an application for asylum.

330
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,450
It is our position
that my client

331
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,495
should not be removed
from this country.

332
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:34,716
Okay. To the issue of bond.

333
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,370
Mr. Duncan?

334
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:40,635
Your Honor, Gabriel Almonte is,
in our opinion, a flight risk.

335
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,115
He was picked up
at Port Authority

336
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:43,986
attempting to run

337
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,510
and should not receive bond
under any circumstances.

338
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,121
Mr. Colón?

339
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,950
Gabriel Almonte has been in the
United States for seven years

340
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,995
and has no criminal record.

341
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,041
He eagerly looks forward
to arguing his case

342
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,391
in front of this court,
Your Honor.

343
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,959
Considering
the current overcrowding

344
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:03,484
in our detention center,
bond is set at $10,000.

345
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,922
The merit hearing will
begin tomorrow morning.

346
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,012
I do hope you're not wasting
this court's time, Mr. Colón.

347
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,188
Thanks so much for rushing over.

348
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:15,235
[exhales] I'm just glad I could
get here in time to secure bond.

349
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:17,106
All these judges want to do

350
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,500
is blast through as many cases
as they can,

351
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,068
and it's a lot easier to do
without a lawyer standing there.

352
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,157
Listen, thank you.
Thank you so much.

353
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,115
I'm Gabriel.Ah.

354
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,900
Benjamin Colón.
Saw you at Cable's funeral.

355
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:30,902
We work together, obviously.

356
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:35,037
And both of you,
thank you for the bond money.

357
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:38,171
Okay? I just... [sighs]

358
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,042
Well, you probably want
to thank Dr. Bull for that,

359
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,784
even though I'm sure he probably
doesn't know about it yet.

360
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:45,569
Then let him know, please,
I'll-I'll pay him back somehow,

361
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,136
some way.Will do.

362
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,138
Now, here's what
I need you to do.

363
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:52,054
I need you to go home
and put a list together for me

364
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:54,752
of people who are willing
to testify on your behalf,

365
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,537
talk about why
you should receive asylum

366
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,539
and be allowed to stay.Yeah.

367
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,932
Okay, I-I can do that. Sure.Great, great.

368
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:03,979
I got to run, but the two
of you have your homework.

369
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:09,028
Ah, nice to see you.

370
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,857
You do know
it's almost 10:00 at night?

371
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,946
Believe me, I'm well aware.

372
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,036
I just, I need to use
our computers and databases

373
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,038
to try and track down
some names Gabriel gave me,

374
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,866
people who can hopefully testify
in less than 12 hours.

375
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,869
That's very inspiring,
Ms. James. Nothing I like better

376
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,089
than a "snowball's chance
in hell" story.

377
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,442
I'm sorry.

378
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:35,228
It's late,
and I'm old and cranky.

379
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:38,361
No, you're not.
You're just too tired to lie.

380
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:41,060
And too smart
not to know better.

381
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,414
What do you really think
his chances are?

382
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,461
The awful truth?

383
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:54,116
Your friend picked
a terrible moment

384
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,162
in the history of this country
to be from someplace else.

385
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:59,382
But... you never know.

386
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,819
Desperate times call
for desperate measures,

387
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:04,300
and this country was founded
by desperate people,

388
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,563
so who knows?

389
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:11,612
You're right. Who knows?

390
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,976
I was just sitting there,
enjoying dinner with my wife,

391
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,848
and then suddenly I started
having trouble breathing.

392
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:34,504
Just couldn't
catch my breath.

393
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,550
And then my chest
started to hurt,

394
00:18:36,593 --> 00:18:38,856
and I guess I blacked out.

395
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,381
And when you regained
consciousness?

396
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:44,297
That guy was
standing over me.

397
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,300
Found out later
I had a collapsed lung.

398
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:49,737
He was the only one
who knew what to do.

399
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,218
The guy saved my life.

400
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:54,307
If it weren't for him,

401
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,831
I'd have never seen
my wife or kids again.

402
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:58,746
My oldest daughter's

403
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,748
expecting her first child.

404
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,706
Thanks to him,

405
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,405
I'll get to meet my grandson.

406
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:09,191
BENNY: No further questions,
Your Honor. Thank you.

407
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:12,586
BULL: Judge never made eye
contact with Gabriel, not once.

408
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:16,590
No change in posture
or facial expression.

409
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,549
[sighs] I don't think we've done
anything to change his mind.

410
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:23,597
Hmm. I'm not sure changing
his mind is even on the menu.

411
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,165
Guys like Wentworth,
I've seen them before.

412
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,949
He's dug in.

413
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:30,734
Prides himself on being
a law and order man.

414
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:32,867
Likes to brag
at cocktail parties

415
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,304
about being appointed
by the Department of Justice.

416
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,306
They don't listen to anybody.

417
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,003
Not even one of their own?

418
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,617
CLAUDINE:
I spoke to Melanie

419
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,445
the day after she came back
from the hospital.

420
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:48,404
She made it very clear to me
that she had given the portrait

421
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,450
to my brother.

422
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:52,191
Even told me she was
going to contact the museum

423
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,323
and amend her agreement
with them.

424
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,456
Do you know why
she never amended

425
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,805
her agreement with the museum?

426
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:01,374
I have no idea. My guess is...

427
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,767
she never got the chance.

428
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:06,640
The final stage
of her cancer was so...

429
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:08,642
aggressive.

430
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:12,167
She was too weak to do much
of anything those last days.

431
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,691
And then she was gone.

432
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:19,174
No further questions.

433
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,265
RIDENOUR:
Good morning, Ms. Schreiber.

434
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:28,227
You're very close
to your brother, aren't you?

435
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,272
Very, yes.

436
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:33,232
And it's not as if
your brother has any children.

437
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,452
No nephews or nieces
for you to fawn over?

438
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:39,063
No, he has no children.

439
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:41,501
And are there
any other siblings,

440
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:43,851
or is it just you
and Mr. Schreiber?

441
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:45,679
Just the two of us.

442
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,463
So is it safe to assume

443
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,944
his will names you
as his sole heir when he passes?[clears throat]

444
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:52,860
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

445
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,165
We're talking about a
$10 million portrait.

446
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:56,298
Isn't who may end up
owning it relevant?

447
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:59,562
Seems like a reasonable line
of questioning to me.

448
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:00,998
Overruled.

449
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:03,000
RIDENOUR:
So, again,

450
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:04,741
is it safe to assume

451
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:06,743
his will names you
as his sole heir when he passes?

452
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,832
That you will, in fact,
inherit the portrait

453
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:11,531
when and if your brother
should pass before you?

454
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:14,447
It's not something
we talk about, but...

455
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,753
I-I suspect that's true.

456
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:19,103
RIDENOUR:
No further questions.

457
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:23,978
Feels like our boat's
taking on water, Chunk.

458
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:25,980
You don't have to tell me.
I'm right here in it.

459
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,765
I've got the waterlogged
shoes to prove it.

460
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,203
[quietly]:
Look at me.

461
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,336
I know you've testified
tons of times.

462
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,772
Not for a friend.

463
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,600
Not when his life
is on the line.

464
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:39,428
All the more reason
to pay careful attention

465
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:40,603
to what you're gonna say.

466
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,213
Oh, I know what I'm gonna say.

467
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:43,954
I'm gonna ask that judge
how he sleeps

468
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,609
knowing he's sending people
to certain death.

469
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:48,132
Um, yeah, well,

470
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,874
I would urge you
to rethink that, Danny.

471
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:53,224
I'm putting you on the stand
'cause you're ex-FBI.

472
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:54,965
I'm hoping the judge
looks at you and thinks,

473
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:56,793
"Oh, she's one of us."

474
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:58,752
But you go in there
and lecture him,

475
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:00,275
game over.

476
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,930
We're all going home,
and Gabriel's in a C-130,

477
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:05,149
on his way to a
firing squad by sundown.

478
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:08,022
So let's take that anger
and put it somewhere else.

479
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,851
You want to make
that judge understand

480
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:12,156
why Gabriel
should be here,

481
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,465
not shame him for wanting
to send him away.

482
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,901
[sighs]

483
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,816
You need to go in there

484
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,036
and be that man's advocate.

485
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,690
Tell his story.

486
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,431
Talk about what makes him
special--

487
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,997
not what the judge
can do for Gabriel

488
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,521
but what Gabriel can do for us,

489
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:30,305
for this country,

490
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,568
all of us already here.

491
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,266
BENNY:
When you met

492
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,659
Gabriel Almonte,

493
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:38,922
what was your first impression
of him?

494
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,925
As a field agent for the Federal
Bureau of Investigation,

495
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:44,885
it was my job to be
a good judge of character.

496
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,061
I needed to be able
to distinguish people

497
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:48,802
who were authentic assets

498
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:49,977
from people who were not,

499
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,413
to be able to see
a person's essence,

500
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:52,936
even if they didn't want me
to see it.

501
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:01,423
I'd like to share
a little story, if I may.

502
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:05,253
I was out to dinner
with my new friend Gabriel.

503
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:08,604
It was... maybe the second time
we'd shared a meal together.

504
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,780
And... I did not know

505
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:13,870
that he was a heart surgeon
in his native country.

506
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:17,004
I did not know
he was here illegally.

507
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,223
I did not know
anything.

508
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,225
He was almost invisible.

509
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,706
Cute, funny,

510
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,795
good company.

511
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,406
But, quite honestly,

512
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:30,409
nothing exceptional.

513
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:34,108
Little did I know
that was the way he wanted it.

514
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:39,766
He needed to hide
his fierce intellect.

515
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,507
He needed to disguise

516
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,030
his superior
education.

517
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,945
So, that night at the
restaurant, when the man

518
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,033
next to us
could no longer breathe,

519
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:47,948
Gabriel had a tough choice
to make.

520
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,950
He knew instantly
what was wrong.

521
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,125
He knew instantly
what to do.

522
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:52,256
But...

523
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,042
he also knew, in doing it,

524
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,044
in getting up
and exposing himself

525
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:58,959
as somebody who knows his
way around the human body

526
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:00,700
in that high-profile
restaurant,

527
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,136
was sure to get
him in trouble.

528
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,007
And it did.

529
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,922
With me...
[chuckles]

530
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:08,490
and the government.

531
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,927
We all felt
we'd been duped a little.

532
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:13,539
But here's the point.

533
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:15,497
Here's-here's what
I need you to know.

534
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,109
That almost invisible man

535
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:21,590
didn't hesitate for a second.

536
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:24,811
He understood that,
in that moment,

537
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:27,422
the virtual certainty
of that man's death

538
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,033
mattered more than the illusion

539
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,035
that his life depended on.

540
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,430
So he did what we hope
every good neighbor,

541
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,650
every good citizen will do.

542
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:39,652
[chuckles softly]

543
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,961
And now I'd like you to imagine

544
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:47,311
how much better
all our lives might be

545
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:48,965
if he were allowed
to be visible,

546
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:51,794
to be as smart
as he truly is,

547
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,797
if he were able to offer
this country,

548
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:55,929
my country,

549
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:58,627
our country, his best,

550
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:00,803
instead of hiding in the shadows

551
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,240
and pleading for
the most basic of human rights,

552
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:05,286
the right to stay alive.

553
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:08,332
I'm... [chuckles]
I'm sorry.

554
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:09,725
Did I answer your question?

555
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,945
You sure did.

556
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:14,164
No further questions,
Your Honor.

557
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,472
You're a former FBI agent,

558
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,039
so let me ask you
a simple question.

559
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:21,911
Do you believe
Mr. Almonte understands the law?

560
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:24,174
I'm sorry,

561
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:25,567
you want me to speculate
on what someone does

562
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:26,655
or doesn't understand?

563
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:28,265
You just said he was brilliant.

564
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:30,093
All kinds of education.

565
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,268
A doctor.

566
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:32,966
Stands to reason
he probably knew

567
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,185
he was breaking
the law, right?

568
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:37,579
Again, I don't think
it's my place to...Well,

569
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,755
wh-what about you?
You think he broke the law?

570
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,280
Like I said,

571
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:46,588
I think he's a human being
trying to stay alive.

572
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:47,894
That's not what I asked,
Ms. James.

573
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:52,594
The witness will answer
the question.

574
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,030
That's all right.
I'll withdraw it.

575
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:56,076
Thank you,
Ms. James.

576
00:25:58,121 --> 00:26:00,123
Sit back down.
You have not been excused.

577
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:04,127
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

578
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:05,868
I'd like an answer
to the question.

579
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,392
As a former
law enforcement officer,

580
00:26:08,436 --> 00:26:10,917
did Gabriel Almonte
break the law?

581
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,397
A simple yes or no.

582
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,275
I'm waiting for an answer,
Ms. James.

583
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,673
Yes, Your Honor.
He broke the law.

584
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:30,501
The laws of the very country
he's asking to take him in.

585
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:32,678
Why should

586
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:35,115
we welcome someone in,
no matter what he has to offer,

587
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:38,814
if he's already proven he's
unwilling to follow our laws?

588
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:40,163
Objection, Your Honor.

589
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:42,122
Now, we all understand

590
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,950
that this is
a passionate debate...

591
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:44,994
Who are you
objecting to,

592
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:45,995
Mr. Colón?

593
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,041
Me? My passion?

594
00:26:48,084 --> 00:26:49,085
Overruled.

595
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:53,002
Why is it so difficult
for people to understand

596
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,743
that if we don't uphold
our laws,

597
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:58,007
then we maintain
no sense of country at all?

598
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,443
Now you're excused, Ms. James.

599
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:01,663
I'm ready to rule.

600
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,491
Your Honor,
if it pleases the court,

601
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,581
we have one more witness
that will be available tomorrow.

602
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,979
Is this man a part of your team,
Mr. Colón?

603
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:14,241
Does he speak
for you?

604
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:16,156
Uh, yes, he does,
Your Honor.

605
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,506
Fine.

606
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:21,248
I already have something
scheduled in the morning.

607
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,250
Your witness will
testify tomorrow

608
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,817
right after lunch,

609
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,427
and then I'll offer my judgment.

610
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,472
Court dismissed.

611
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:32,346
[quietly]:
And who is this mystery witness?

612
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,914
I have no idea.

613
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:36,742
But now everybody lives
to see another day,

614
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:38,265
and that certainly beats
the alternative.

615
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,402
MARISSA: There's got to be
someone we can put on the stand,

616
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:47,970
someone who can make
that judge see.

617
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:50,494
Judge can't see,
'cause he isn't looking.

618
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:53,628
There's only two things
he wants:

619
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,587
to deport Gabriel
and get on to his next case.

620
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,894
[sighs] You know,

621
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:00,287
when he first decided
to move here,

622
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,159
he-he thought he was doing
all the right things.

623
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:07,207
He hired this lawyer
that promised him the world.

624
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,817
The proper papers,

625
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:10,514
recertification
as a doctor.

626
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,692
Gabriel gave him
every cent he had.

627
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,694
But when he showed up
at the airport,

628
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:20,046
all that was waiting for him
was a two-week tourist visa.

629
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:24,659
Maybe there are other people
this lawyer scammed.

630
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,269
Maybe if...

631
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:28,184
if we could find one of them...

632
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:30,099
That's not gonna work.

633
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,188
You have to be a U.S. citizen

634
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:34,756
to testify
in immigration court.

635
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,976
Now, if you could find
that lawyer...

636
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,239
In 13 hours?

637
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:41,415
Who are we kidding?
It doesn't matter.

638
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,070
Wentworth doesn't care
what happened to Gabriel.

639
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,811
He has a job to do,

640
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:47,638
and he wants to get it done.

641
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:48,857
BENNY:
Well,

642
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:51,207
in the meantime,
I'll start putting together

643
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:52,426
the paperwork for an appeal.

644
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:54,602
But... [grunts]
without any new information,

645
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,169
we are likely to be denied.

646
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,998
[sighs] And, of
course, we'd have

647
00:28:59,041 --> 00:28:59,999
to get him back here,

648
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:02,131
and he'd have
to find a way to...

649
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:04,612
avoid authorities
in his home country

650
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,657
until we schedule
the hearings.

651
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,659
Lots of ifs.

652
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:11,401
We found some good news.

653
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,664
Unless, of course,

654
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,231
that isn't what y'all
are looking for.

655
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,494
We'll take all the
good news we can get.

656
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:19,888
I was able to access Melanie's
cellular records to see

657
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:21,890
who she might have spoken with
the week before she died.

658
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:23,849
She found a witness,

659
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:25,241
a woman that works
in a custom frame house.

660
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:26,721
TAYLOR:
A place that's done a lot

661
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,071
of business with Geoffrey's
ex-wife over the years.

662
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:31,421
She's willing to testify
first thing in the morning.

663
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:33,293
[knocking]

664
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:34,468
Who is it?

665
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:36,339
DANNY: It's me.[exhales]

666
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:37,819
I've been calling
and texting you all night,

667
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,603
and you haven't answered me,
so I just...

668
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,170
want to make sure
you're okay.

669
00:29:41,214 --> 00:29:42,781
Yeah, I'm okay.
[sniffles]

670
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,783
I'm okay.

671
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,177
You should just go away.

672
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:51,267
I think that this is all going
to be easier for me tomorrow

673
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,225
if you're not there.

674
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:54,793
Okay?

675
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,056
I just,

676
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,406
I don't want you
to see them take me away.

677
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:01,060
[sighs]

678
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:03,932
[keys jangle, lock clicks]

679
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:06,587
[sighs]

680
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,328
Gabriel,

681
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,896
will you please come over here
and unhook this door?

682
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:12,898
Go away, please, Danny.

683
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,551
Please, just go away.

684
00:30:14,595 --> 00:30:17,206
You and your friends have done
everything that you can for me.

685
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,077
Okay? Thank you.

686
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,079
But we're not done.

687
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:22,255
Yeah, I think that we are.

688
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,344
I'm not stupid.

689
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:25,867
You understand?
I'm not stupid.

690
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:27,347
That place is not a court.

691
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,349
That is a checkpoint.

692
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:30,872
By this time tomorrow,

693
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,265
I'm either going to be dead

694
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:34,745
or in a cell waiting to die.

695
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,138
No, you won't.

696
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:39,881
Just please come to the door.

697
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,492
Please?

698
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:44,059
[sighs]

699
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:46,061
Look, I have an idea.

700
00:30:46,105 --> 00:30:48,672
I just, I need
to tell you to your face.

701
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:51,719
[sighs]

702
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,330
[sniffles]

703
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:05,689
You're not going to invite me
out to dinner again, are you?

704
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:08,040
Let's get married.

705
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,173
City Hall opens at 8:30.

706
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:14,002
Court's not back
until after lunch.

707
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:17,701
By 10:00 a.m., you'll be
on a path to citizenship.

708
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:20,835
You're serious.

709
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,228
Of course I'm serious.

710
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:24,447
Do I look like I'm kidding?

711
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:42,291
You really sure
you want to do this?

712
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,694
[Danny sighs]

713
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:56,175
As soon as we're married,
we'll file for a marriage visa.

714
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:59,134
Judge Wentworth will have to
suspend the removal hearing

715
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:00,744
and the immigration officials
will investigate our marriage.

716
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:02,964
Oh, man. [sighs]

717
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,966
What?

718
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,621
I know about this.

719
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:12,191
I heard about this undocumented
guy who got married.

720
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:14,280
He and his wife had been
together for years.

721
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:16,325
They still,
still separated them

722
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,979
and interviewed them for hours.

723
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:19,676
Uh...

724
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,678
How are you going
to handle your finances?

725
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:23,985
What do you feel about
each other's in-laws?

726
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,640
What's each other's
favorite food?

727
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:28,468
Danny, I don't, I don't know
your favorite food.

728
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:29,948
I've never met your parents.

729
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:33,647
You've got to stop
thinking this way.

730
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,866
And we have to stop having
this conversation here.

731
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,478
Look...

732
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:42,047
If they don't give us
the marriage license,

733
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,614
go back to your country
for a few months.
[sighs]

734
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:46,965
Stay under the
radar and survive.

735
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:52,013
I'll go with you.

736
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,059
CLERK:
Number 22.

737
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,715
Okay.
Come on.

738
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:05,679
Hi. Uh, we, uh,
need a marriage license.

739
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:08,029
I need I.D. from
each of you.

740
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,423
Uh, yeah, of course.

741
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,995
There you go.
Mm-hmm.

742
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,692
Hmm. Danielle James.

743
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:20,346
New York State
driver's license.

744
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,435
And Gabriel Almonte.

745
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:27,135
NYC Municipal I.D. card.

746
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,015
Well, this all looks good.

747
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,627
You are good to go.

748
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,109
Once the 24-hour waiting period
is up, you're free to marry.

749
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:46,285
I'm sorry. We... [laughs]
We can't wait 24 hours.

750
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:48,852
We have to get married today,
this morning.

751
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:52,073
Well, that's not how it works
in the state of New York.

752
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:54,206
There's a 24-hour
waiting period.

753
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,338
If it's an emergency,
you could try

754
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,123
and get a judicial waiver,

755
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,951
but I wouldn't even know how
to tell you where to start.

756
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:08,046
Look, it seems like forever,
but it isn't.

757
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,005
Number 23!

758
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,182
And what was the nature
of Melanie's business

759
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:16,271
the last time she came
to your custom frame house?

760
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:19,231
She said she wanted
a new frame made

761
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,320
for a Cole Trumaine she owned.

762
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:23,235
She said it was
a portrait of her

763
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:25,324
that was commissioned shortly
before she was married.

764
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:29,284
Apparently, her husband never
really liked the gold leaf frame

765
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:31,939
the portrait was originally
mounted in.

766
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:36,074
She said Geoffrey preferred more
of a sleek, black, modern style.

767
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,119
Uh, she was giving it
to him as a gift,

768
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:39,860
and she was very particular.

769
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:43,211
She wanted to make sure that
everything was done just right.

770
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:47,172
And did any money change hands
the day she came to see you?

771
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:50,436
Yes. I prepared the work order
and she gave me a deposit.

772
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,655
I was waiting for her
to let me know

773
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,614
when I could pick the piece up,

774
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:57,530
but I-I'm guessing that's when
she took a turn for the worse,

775
00:34:57,573 --> 00:35:00,228
because I never heard from her.MACINTYRE: Thank you.

776
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:02,143
One last thing.

777
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,754
Did she happen to specify
where you were

778
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:07,148
to deliver the piece
once your work was completed?

779
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:10,630
Or were you simply gonna
return it to her home?

780
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:12,371
No. She was very clear.

781
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:14,155
The portrait was to be delivered

782
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,765
to Geoffrey Schreiber's
residence.

783
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,943
MACINTYRE:
Your Honor,

784
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:22,294
we would like to enter
this work order

785
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:24,905
and cancelled personal check
into evidence

786
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:27,777
as defendant's exhibits A and B.

787
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,998
The court will note
Geoffrey Schreiber's address

788
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,869
indicated as the
"delivery" address.

789
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:34,654
Additionally,
the court will note

790
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,351
the signature
of Melanie Schreiber.

791
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,921
So entered.

792
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,970
Well, uh, enjoy Germany.

793
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:49,451
I know that Melanie's portrait
is gonna love it there.

794
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,018
I can't thank you
both enough.

795
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,759
Well, I hate to
win and run

I just left Judge Wentworth.

With his permission, I went
ahead and made arrangements

you through security.
