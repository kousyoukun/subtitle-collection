Hmm...
And that gun should
have never been left

162
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,475
unsecured in the
first place.

163
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,780
The cop broke protocol

164
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:59,087
by removing it in an
unlocked public bathroom.

165
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,784
She created the threat.

166
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,657
True, but...
he tried to grab it.

167
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,876
She had to defend herself.

168
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,009
The police officer is the
one with the training.

169
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,314
There are a dozen ways

170
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,751
she could have de-escalated
that situation.

171
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:14,319
Hey, you may be right, but
I don't think it matters anyway.

172
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:17,671
As far as I know, we don't have
anything to do with this case.

173
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,977
[sighs heavily]

174
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:37,995
WOMAN: You're not gonna
take them all, are you?

175
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,214
Oh.

176
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,129
[laughs]

177
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,783
No. This is...

178
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:45,220
I just... Doesn't matter.

179
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,265
[chuckles]

180
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:48,571
Ms. Ford.
Mm-hmm.

181
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,573
I'm...
Dr. Jason Bull.

182
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:53,228
I know who you are,
and I know what you do.

183
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,925
How can I help you,
Dr. Bull?

184
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:58,450
Well, it's not me
that needs your help.

185
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:00,452
It's the City of New York.

186
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:04,108
They approached me,
and asked me to get involved

187
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,894
in this federal
civil rights suit

188
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:09,810
that you
and your client filed.

189
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,421
Frankly, I came over here
to see what I could do

190
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,988
to make the whole thing go away.

191
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:18,253
Well, you can get them to
offer my client $25 million.

192
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:19,689
[laughs]

193
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:22,823
What is it about that
figure that amuses you?

194
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,173
Well, that's a big number
for a flesh wound

195
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,175
that's probably gonna heal
before this case finishes

196
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,829
winding its way
through the courts.

197
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:31,875
And my bigger fear is that,
in the meantime,

198
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,139
jackasses will line up
on both sides of the argument

199
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:38,665
and use it as an excuse
to make more trouble.

200
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,014
Hmm.

201
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:42,103
I'd always heard

202
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:46,716
that you were this crusader
for civil rights, human rights.

203
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,546
I like to think I have
been a significant voice

204
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,548
in that conversation,

205
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,943
a meaningful advocate for people
whose rights have been violated.

206
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:59,163
And it may seem like just a
flesh wound to you, Dr. Bull,

207
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,601
but to me, it's a
bullet to the heart.

208
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,994
I'm reasonably sure if
that had been a white man

209
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,562
in that bathroom, there'd
have been no shots fired.

210
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,696
I've also learned over the years
that the only thing that changes

211
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:11,654
an entrenched institution

212
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:15,789
like the City of New York is a
big ding to their bank account.

213
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,921
And that's what
I'm really after.

214
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:20,010
Big change.

215
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,534
Then I guess
we're going to court.

216
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:25,450
I guess so.

217
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:30,238
You want the good news
or the bad news?

218
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:33,067
Just... give us the news.

219
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,243
We're going to trial tomorrow,
working on behalf

220
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,549
of Officer Tonya Harris
and the NYPD.

221
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,203
Oh, my God.

222
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:41,075
And our strategy is...?

223
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,643
Well, Malia Ford is obviously
gonna make this case about race.

224
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,296
So in choosing our jurors,

225
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,863
we are gonna do
everything we can

226
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,778
to make it about everything but.

227
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,475
And how do we do that?

228
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,174
Well, we want to concentrate
on the circumstances.

229
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,959
Not the people.

230
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,744
When you present
the circumstances,

231
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,615
there is a solid foundation
of facts

232
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,792
that supports the idea
that Officer Harris...

233
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:06,274
was reasonably in fear
for her life.

234
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:09,669
She shot Cal Peterson
in self-defense.

235
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,149
White or black, our ideal juror

236
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:16,066
is someone who would make
the same split-second decision.

237
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:19,026
Someone who doesn't take time
to think in a crisis

238
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:20,592
but reacts in a blink.

239
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:22,203
What I call a "Blink Reactor."

240
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:25,075
Okay. So now we're looking
for Blink Reactors.

241
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,860
Whatever those are.

242
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,079
BULL: We're not
simply relying on how

243
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,386
jurors tell us they'd react
in a crisis,

244
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:34,258
but also how long they take
to answer the question.

245
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:38,088
The main thing is we don't care
who these Blink Reactors are.

246
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:42,440
In fact, the more our jury looks
like a jury forCal Peterson,

247
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,704
the more we will have started

248
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,096
to convince everyone
in that courtroom,

249
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,751
most especially that jury,

250
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:52,494
that we're not trying a case
about race.

251
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:56,759
We're trying a case
about circumstances.

252
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:58,021
Hello, Miss Sloane.

253
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:01,024
I see that you are
a hair stylist.

254
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,983
Actually, I own my own salon.

255
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:04,506
That's terrific.

256
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,943
Now, let's say one day...

257
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:10,120
a gentleman comes
into your salon.

258
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:13,123
I don't know if he's crazy
or high on PCP,

259
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,212
and he grabs one
of your scissors,

260
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,779
and he starts
swinging it around.

261
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,215
Threatening you
and your customers.

262
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,001
What would you do?

263
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,571
Come on.
You a thinker or a blinker?

264
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:28,573
I want you on this jury.

265
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,401
MARISSA:
Seven seconds.

266
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:32,795
Eight seconds.BULL:
You can do this.

267
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,537
Throw bleach in his face.
Hit him with your hair dryer.

268
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,584
Move to strike,
Your Honor.

269
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,021
What we don't want

270
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,979
are people who lack
the confidence to take action.

271
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,938
Now, Mr. Sails,
you work the door

272
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,287
at a club.
Am I correct?

273
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,464
Yes, I do.Now, I bet when
it gets pretty late,

274
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,118
people have had
too much to drink,

275
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,033
gets kind of wild, huh?SAILS: It does.

276
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,643
BENNY:
So let me ask you:

277
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:57,254
what would you do if one of your
customers took a swing at you?

278
00:12:57,298 --> 00:13:00,736
I would make it my business to
see to it that he regrets it.

279
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,869
Instantly.

280
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,000
Without hesitation?

281
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,046
Instantly.

282
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,835
We also want jurors who believe
people have a fundamental right

283
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,968
to protect what's theirs,
whether it's their property,

284
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:18,232
their life or the lives
of their loved ones.

285
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,060
Have you ever had your home

286
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,931
or apartment broken into?

287
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:23,454
Yes, a couple of years back.

288
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:26,588
And were you there at the time?No, thank goodness.

289
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:28,459
Thank goodness
because you suspect the robber

290
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:29,852
might have hurt you or...?

291
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:32,202
Thank goodness because if
I would have been there,

292
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:35,075
there'd be one dead
robber right now.

293
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,469
This juror's acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

294
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,254
Ms. Ford?

295
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:43,300
This juror is acceptable
to the plaintiff, as well.

296
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,825
Then it looks
like we've got our jury.

297
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,090
I saw your boss on the
front page of the paper.

298
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,658
Sitting in court beside that
cop that shot Cal Peterson.

299
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:54,877
Okay.

300
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,096
CHUNK:
You know, Anna,

301
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,749
it's my job.
I don't run the company.

302
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,099
I just work there.

303
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:01,971
You can hear how pathetic
that sounds, right?

304
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:03,190
Actually, I can't.

305
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:06,236
'Cause I know how hard
good jobs are to get.

306
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,108
And I know how important
my job is right now,

307
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:10,197
seeing as that you're
the one going to school.

308
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,156
And yeah, I know
all about your scholarships,

309
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,203
but somebody's got to pay
for books and housing...

310
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,595
Still pathetic.

311
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,642
[sighs]

312
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:25,647
I ever tell you what my dad
gave me for my 14th birthday?

313
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,955
He gave me "The Talk."

314
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:31,740
Sat me down and told me
all about how I should act

315
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,350
around the police.

316
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:35,135
"Don't attract attention.

317
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:36,745
"Don't make them mad.

318
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,661
Do whatever they say
the second they say do it."

319
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,271
[scoffs]

320
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:44,622
And it all made me
so angry.

321
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,277
I was embarrassed that he
was telling me those things.

322
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,454
I was embarrassed
that he believed those things.

323
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,327
And I was enraged
that he accepted those things.

324
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:57,287
But deep down,

325
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,681
I knew what he was
trying to do.

326
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:03,337
He was trying to...
tell me the truth.

327
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,775
And I knew my white friends
weren't having that talk.

328
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:07,994
[scoffs]

329
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,256
Not on their 14th birthday.

330
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,648
Not on their 40th birthday.

331
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,737
So, then, how can you go

332
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:15,131
and defend a white cop
who shot one of us?

333
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:18,308
Well, this is what
I tell myself.

334
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,963
For the justice system
to really work,

335
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:24,097
it has to be colorblind.

336
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,013
Look, I don't know what
really happened that night.

337
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:29,363
Who's right. Who's wrong.

338
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,843
But me being a part of it,

339
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,977
me being involved
in the fact-finding process?

340
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:37,240
Well, I have to believe
that somewhere,

341
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,460
my dad is smiling.

342
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:45,553
DANNY:
Veronica Hill?

343
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,642
Ms. Hill. Hi.

344
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,165
My name is Danny James.

345
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,341
I'm an investigator working
on the Cal Peterson case.

346
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,561
The unarmed schoolteacher
who was shot

347
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,171
by the female police officer.

348
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,304
Okay, but I don't know anything
about that

349
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:58,870
other than what I read online.

350
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:02,004
Isn't it true that Cal Peterson
was your driver last year

351
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,875
after you summoned a rideshare
service on your phone?

352
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,530
I'm sorry. I don't
have time for this.

353
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:08,924
I have to pick something up for
my boss and get it back to him.

354
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,274
But I saw that you filed a
complaint against Mr. Peterson.

355
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:12,797
Do you mind
telling me what happened?

356
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:15,148
Look, I really don't want
to get dragged

357
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,237
into a big case like this.

358
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,543
Or I can subpoena you.

359
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:26,289
SCOTT:
That's the jury you picked?

360
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,248
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

361
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,599
Nope. A lot of this
is just dumb luck.

362
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,688
You still sure
you don't want to settle?

363
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:35,516
CAL:
I had been

364
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,040
to a big celebratory dinner
earlier in the evening.

365
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:40,564
Um, it was
a citywide celebration

366
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:43,263
honoring public education
and public schoolteachers,

367
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:45,047
and I actually received

368
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,006
a Teacher of the Year award
from the mayor.

369
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,703
And after this dinner,
what did you do?

370
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:50,357
Uh, went out
with some other teachers.

371
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,706
Had a few more drinks.

372
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:53,403
So, wait. Take us through this.

373
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,579
You're drinking with friends...

374
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:58,365
Well, uh...

375
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:00,541
this is embarrassing.

376
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:03,805
But the truth is I don't
normally drink very much.

377
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,068
So when I left my friends

378
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,331
and when I started to walk home,

379
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,074
I realized, um,
I was pretty messed up.

380
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,859
And then I started to get sick.

381
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,687
And I knew
I really needed a bathroom,

382
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:19,429
and there was that diner,
so I just ran in.

383
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:23,042
I tried the men's room first,
but it was locked.

384
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,479
I was feeling desperate.

385
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:29,222
I... I didn't want
to make a mess on the floor,

386
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,224
so I tried the door
to the ladies' room,

387
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,486
and it wasn't locked.

388
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,444
MARISSA: Surprise, surprise.
They like him.

389
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,664
Truth be told, I like him.

390
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,970
I don't recall anyone asking.

391
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:42,931
Okay, so, you open the door
to the women's restroom.

392
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,933
And what happened?

393
00:17:44,976 --> 00:17:46,413
Uh, there was a woman
on the toilet,

394
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:49,372
but then I saw the sink...She was on the toilet?

395
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,070
Just about.

396
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,420
She may have been
unbuttoning her pants

397
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,638
or something like that.

398
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:57,380
This woman, is she
here in the courtroom?

399
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:00,557
Right over there.

400
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,516
Officer Harris.

401
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,387
[gallery murmuring]

402
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:08,522
So, you move toward the sink.

403
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:09,914
And next thing I know,

404
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,395
she pulled her gun
and was waving it in my face.

405
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,832
And then, uh...

406
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:16,834
then she shot me.

407
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:19,620
MALIA:
Now, Mr. Peterson,

408
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:22,057
after Officer Harris grabbed
her gun but before she shot you,

409
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,017
isn't it true you grabbed
the barrel of that gun?

410
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:28,803
I did.

411
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,413
Can you tell us
why you did that?

412
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:35,679
I guess it was just instinct.

413
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,073
Seems like every time
you turn on the news,

414
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,380
you hear about
some unarmed black man

415
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,904
being shot by a white cop.

416
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:45,646
[gallery murmuring]

417
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,082
So when this white cop

418
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,432
was pointing her gun at me,

419
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:51,913
I knew.

420
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:55,177
I knew she was gonna shoot me.

421
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:58,398
So I grabbed the gun and tried
to aim it away from me.

422
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,443
And thank God I did.

423
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,317
She only got me in the arm.

424
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,146
Who knows what she would've hit
if I hadn't.

425
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,148
I could be dead.

426
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,150
Objection! Speculation.

427
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,325
Overruled.

428
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,283
We have no more
questions at this time.

429
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,939
[clears throat]

430
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,769
So...

431
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:24,032
we've heard a lot about...

432
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,339
how much you had to drink
the night of the shooting.

433
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,819
But I was wondering if you
could also tell me about...

434
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:31,779
the illegal drugs
you also ingested

435
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:33,389
that evening.

436
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:34,347
[gallery murmuring]

437
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,393
I'm sorry. I apologize.

438
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,352
Must be me.
I didn't hear an answer.

439
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:41,223
I didn't offer one.

440
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,051
I don't have one.

441
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:45,445
I didn't take any drugs
that evening.

442
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:47,708
I don't take drugs. Ever.

443
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,057
Oh, I'm sorry.

444
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,233
[exhales] Forgive me.

445
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:52,452
My mistake.

446
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:53,931
Ah.

447
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,543
I see what the problem is.

448
00:19:56,586 --> 00:20:00,329
I must have gotten thrown
off by this toxicity report.

449
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:02,244
Taken on the night
of the shooting.

450
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:05,160
See, they took you to
the hospital to stitch you up,

451
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,814
and they took some blood.

452
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:08,381
Remember?

453
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:11,166
Objection! I haven't seen
any toxicity report.

454
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,560
Defense didn't produce it
in discovery.

455
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,257
Again, I apologize.

456
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,520
I just got it
from the state lab last night.

457
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:18,826
They've been backed up.

458
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:21,176
That notwithstanding,
the plaintiff's counsel

459
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,091
had the same access
to this report

460
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:25,224
as I did, Your Honor.

461
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,099
I'll allow it.

462
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:32,970
Thank you, Your Honor.

463
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,189
Now, according to this report,

464
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,278
you weren't just drunk,
Mr. Peterson.

465
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,411
You were high on MDMA.

466
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:40,630
You know, MDMA?

467
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,197
Molly?

468
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,983
[scoffs]I need an answer, sir.

469
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,594
Is it still your testimony

470
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:49,378
that you didn't do any drugs
that evening?

471
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:51,815
And let me remind you
that you are still under oath.

472
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,557
No. I mean, yes.

473
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,517
I absolutely didn't take
any drugs that night.

474
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,128
All I can think of is maybe
somebody slipped something

475
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:03,523
in my drink, but I certainly
wasn't aware of it.

476
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:06,352
So someone slipped Molly

477
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,441
in your drink while you
were out celebrating

478
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:09,746
your Teacher of the Year award?

479
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,531
Objection. Argumentative.

480
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,228
Move it along, Mr. Colón.

481
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,058
Certainly, Your Honor,
certainly.

482
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:19,626
Th-The night that you charged

483
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:23,151
into Officer Harris's
bathroom...

484
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,631
that wasn't the first time

485
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,197
that you physically threatened
a woman,

486
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:28,330
was it, Mr. Peterson?

487
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,984
I don't know
what you're talking about.

488
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,378
Isn't it true that last year,

489
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,380
at this time,
you used the evening hours

490
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:38,427
to work as a driver for
a ridesharing company?

491
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:41,561
And isn't it true that a
complaint was filed against you

492
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:44,390
by one of your passengers?
A Ms. Veronica Hill?

493
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,043
Objection.
Your Honor, relevance?

494
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,350
The plaintiff's counsel
has gone to great lengths

495
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:51,179
to present the plaintiff
as a model citizen.

496
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:53,529
An honored teacher
who could do no wrong.

497
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,575
She opened the door
to character, Your Honor.

498
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,620
Overruled.

499
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:59,274
BENNY:
Thank you.

500
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,234
Now, let me refresh your memory,
Mr. Peterson.

501
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:05,889
Isn't it true
that Ms. Hill became

502
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:09,806
so uncomfortable
with the aggressive,

503
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,593
sexual passes you made
while you were her driver,

504
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:16,683
that she demanded you pull over
three and a half miles

505
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:18,511
before she reached
her destination?

506
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:22,515
She did ask me to pull over.

507
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:24,560
But I wasn't being aggressive.

508
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:27,128
It was really just
a misunderstanding.

509
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:28,695
Oh, just a misunderstanding.

510
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:32,655
But didn't you chase her on foot
after she exited your car?

511
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,657
I was trying to reason with her.

512
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:36,442
You were trying to reason with
her while you were chasing her,

513
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:37,704
screaming at her,

514
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:39,532
threatening her.

515
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:41,708
I wasn't threatening her.

516
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,537
I just...

517
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,887
I just didn't want her
to file a complaint.

518
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,542
I really needed that job.

519
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:53,633
You're a big guy, Mr. Peterson.

520
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:56,723
How big would you say
Ms. Hill was?

521
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,899
Would you, would you say
that-that she was

522
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:01,467
a... large woman?

523
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,425
Or would you call
her average?

524
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:08,038
Or-or-or might you use
the word "petite"?

525
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,997
Petite.

526
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,564
She was definitely petite.

527
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,044
Petite.

528
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,003
Got it.

529
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:20,573
No further questions,
Your Honor.

530
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:22,749
Let's take a 15 minute break.

531
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:27,057
Nice work.

532
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,016
You know...

533
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,628
...for the first time,
I think, uh,

534
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,717
we might actually have a
shot at winning this thing.

535
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:37,111
I think so, too.

536
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:39,679
And I think the plaintiff's
lawyer feels the same way,

537
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,811
which is why I would urge you
to authorize me

538
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,639
to use our newfound leverage

539
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:46,860
to try again
and broker a settlement.

540
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,433
Can you not feel the tension
in the air?

541
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,783
I don't think there is a good
ending for our city,

542
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,524
no matter which side wins.

543
00:23:58,567 --> 00:23:59,829
Dr. Bull,

544
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:02,353
I hired you to clear

545
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:04,921
this officer's good name.

546
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:09,317
Why don't you worry about that
and let me worry about the city?

547
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:19,153
When my client came through
the door, what state of dress

548
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:22,069
or undress were you in?

549
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:25,551
I had unbuttoned my pants and
I was pulling down my zipper.

550
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,379
You must have been terrified.

551
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:30,991
I was startled.

552
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:33,036
My first concern was for my gun.

553
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,430
It was on the sink
and I needed to secure it.

554
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,389
So you weren't scared?

555
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:40,522
There wasn't time to be scared.

556
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,829
And besides, it didn't seem like
he was coming for me.

557
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:44,657
It seemed like he was going
for my gun.

558
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,573
And why would he be
going for the gun?

559
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,923
And how would he have even
known that the person

560
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:53,230
in the bathroom had a gun,
much less put it on the sink?

561
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:57,713
That's a terrific question, and
one I don't have an answer to,

562
00:24:57,757 --> 00:24:59,672
except for the fact
that I could only deal

563
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:02,109
with the information
that was in front of me.

564
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:03,850
And the information
directly in front of me

565
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:05,286
was that there was a man

566
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:07,201
someplace he wasn't
supposed to be

567
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:09,029
and he seemed to be going
for my gun.

568
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,684
So that drove your
decision making?Absolutely.

569
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,990
It didn't occur to you that
he might have been sick?

570
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:16,384
That he might have been
going for the sink?

571
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:17,907
I had no way of knowing that.

572
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:20,606
He didn't look sick?

573
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:21,737
His head was down.

574
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:22,564
He stumbled, but...

575
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:24,566
Did he look drunk?

576
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,002
It was four steps between
the door and the sink.

577
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:27,613
Did he look black?

578
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:29,615
[sighs]

579
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:31,573
He was black. He is black.

580
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:34,358
Isn't that why you grabbed
for your gun?

581
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,186
No. That's ridiculous.

582
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,233
Without knowing what he
wanted, why he was there,

583
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:41,235
you grabbed for your gun
because a black man

584
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,585
was standing over you while
you went to the toilet,

585
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:45,761
isn't that right?With all due respect,

586
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,328
I was grabbing that gun
no matter who

587
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:49,460
was standing over me
while I go to the toilet.

588
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:52,594
[scoffs]
Did you struggle for the gun?

589
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,553
No. I got to it first.

590
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,250
I looked at the
bodycam footage.

591
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,948
Didn't look to me like he
was even going for the gun.

592
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:01,690
Is it possible
that you were wrong?

593
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:04,606
Is it possible that h-he
wasn't going for the gun?

594
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,607
You weren't there.

595
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:06,695
Did you think he had a gun?

596
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,524
It never crossed my mind.

597
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,483
My only concern was that
he didn't take my gun.

598
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,398
So I'm confused.

599
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:16,531
If you had your gun,
and you weren't thinking

600
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,141
about whether or
not he had one,

601
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,230
then why were you pointing
it at him at all?

602
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,406
Because...He was black?

603
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,626
No.

604
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,759
L-Look at the bodycam footage.

605
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:29,022
The second I had the gun,
he was on me,

606
00:26:29,065 --> 00:26:31,111
trying to take the gun from me.

607
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:33,635
Because you were
pointing it at him.

608
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,724
Because he didn't
want to get shot.

609
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:40,120
So the question is: why were
you pointing it at him at all?

610
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:42,557
If all you wanted to do
was secure it,

611
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,907
then why did you end up
pointing it at my client?

612
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:47,649
Why did you end up
shooting my client?

613
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:52,132
And isn't the answer
because he's black?

614
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:03,883
Let's t-- let's
take a break.

615
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:05,972
You okay?

616
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:11,368
I'm thinking this is,
uh, about a tenth

617
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:13,588
of what you can expect
to face on the stand

618
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,155
when Malia Ford
questions you.

619
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:17,679
You can't let her bait you.

620
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,768
You can't let her anger you.

621
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:22,728
This is her technique.
It's what she does.

622
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,947
She's famous for it.

623
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:27,558
You okay?
Mm.

624
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,650
Great.

625
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,042
Let's go to court.

626
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:36,219
[crowd shouting]

627
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:47,056
TONYA [on video]:
Halt! NYPD. Halt!

628
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,754
W-What are you doing?

629
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:51,713
Let go. Let go of the gun!

630
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,019
[groans]

631
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:55,848
CAL:
Oh, my God, you shot me!

632
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,458
You really shot me. Oh.

633
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:00,461
TONYA:
Precinct 55. Charlie to Cent...

634
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:03,072
Wow. That's quite a tape.

635
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:08,295
I'm sure you won't forget
anything about that night

636
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:10,166
for years to come.

637
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,821
Burned in my memory.

638
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:15,128
So what color jacket
was my client wearing?

639
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:16,912
Excuse me?

640
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:19,132
What color sports jacket?

641
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:21,134
Was it black?

642
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:23,527
Was it blue? Was it brown?

643
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,749
The witness will please answer.

644
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,795
MALIA:
It's all right.

645
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:32,362
I withdraw the question.

646
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,843
But do you happen to recall

647
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:37,411
the color of his shirt?

648
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:40,327
I don't know.

649
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,764
Mm. White?

650
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:43,939
Mm.

651
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:45,245
Yellow?

652
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:47,247
Mmm.

653
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,770
It was a very light blue.

654
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,772
Mm.

655
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,992
Now how about his face?

656
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,776
Objection, Your Honor.

657
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,822
Counsel is...[alarm blares]

658
00:28:57,997 --> 00:28:59,955
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've received a bomb threat.

659
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:01,652
We're gonna need everyone to
leave the courthouse right now.

660
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,138
CHUNK: According to
the commissioner's office,

661
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:12,751
the bomb threat was specifically
targeted to our courtroom.

662
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:15,405
Rather remarkable piece
of timing, actually.

663
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:18,365
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

664
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,978
That was not
great in there.

665
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:26,112
You... you were not
great in there.

666
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:29,158
I know.

667
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,508
She makes me nervous.

668
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:34,424
Well, maybe you want to
come down with something?

669
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,905
So you don't have
to continue today?

670
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:41,692
Boss. We got the all clear.
Everyone's headed back in.

671
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,871
I'm fine.

672
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:47,873
Are you sure?

673
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:50,092
I'm fine.

674
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:55,837
MALIA:
Now, where did we
leave off? Oh, yes,

675
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:58,797
I was asking if you remember the
color of Mr. Peterson's face.

676
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,582
It was black.

677
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,497
We all know it was black.

678
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,847
And it's your testimony that
that did not contribute

679
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:07,893
in any way to your decision
to shoot him?

680
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:10,809
Of course not.

681
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,072
So, then, logically,
what you're really saying is,

682
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:15,901
no matter who walked in
that room,

683
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:18,164
you were gonna react
the same way.BENNY: Objection.

684
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:20,383
Counsel is testifying.

685
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:23,778
Overruled.
You may answer the question.

686
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,830
Yes. No matter who
came through the door,

687
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:33,657
I would have reacted
the same.

688
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:35,094
An old woman?

689
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:38,184
Yes. I believe so.

690
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,447
You believe so?

691
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,883
What about a child?

692
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,972
A boy, a four-year-old boy?

693
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,974
Your Honor, these are all
ridiculous hypotheticals.

694
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:48,324
The attorney is badgering
the witness.

695
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:50,936
I sense the attorney is trying
to make a point; I'll allow it,

696
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:54,983
but let's get to it sooner
rather than later.

697
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:56,898
I was asking about a child.

698
00:30:56,942 --> 00:31:00,206
A four-year-old boy,
you'd still point your gun?

699
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,555
Of course not.

700
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:04,471
Then it's not true.

701
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,212
Despite your earlier testimony

702
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:08,040
that no matter who walked
through the door,

703
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,129
you were gonna behave
the same way.

704
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:12,653
For some people
you point your gun,

705
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:15,961
for others, no.
And, frankly,

706
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:18,224
I think that's good.

707
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:19,834
You're a professional.

708
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,444
You should apply
critical thinking

709
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,490
to a decision like this.

710
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,753
So...

711
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:29,365
at what age do you start
pointing your gun?

712
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,759
If a person's 12?BENNY: Objection!

713
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:34,153
JUDGE STALDER:
The point, please.14?

714
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:38,287
It's a 20-year-old boy
instead of a 38-year-old man,

715
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:40,159
you point your gun?

716
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:44,946
What if it's a
20-year-old black boy?

717
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,121
Come on.
BENNY:
Your Honor?

718
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:51,126
[sighs]
You want the truth?

719
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,258
Well, that would be nice.

720
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,999
You always apply
critical thinking

721
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:55,914
before you point your gun.

722
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,133
But where does that
critical thinking come from?

723
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:02,833
Two places-- your training
and your experience.

724
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:07,403
And I'm sorry.
In my experience doing this job,

725
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:10,580
if I'm in a women's bathroom,
and a man--

726
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:13,975
yes, a black man--
if a black man

727
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:17,674
walks into it at 2:00 in the
morning, and moves for my gun...[gallery clamoring]

728
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:19,633
[gavel bangs]...I'm gonna get it first,
and I'm gonna

729
00:32:19,676 --> 00:32:21,156
point it at him,
and anybody...[gavel banging]

730
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,071
...who does what I do
for a living

731
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:24,986
and says any different
is a liar!

732
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,988
[gallery clamoring]

733
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:29,382
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

734
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:43,091
I'm so sorry.

735
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:45,137
So, so sorry.

736
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,356
I can't believe I did that.

737
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,358
I just...

738
00:32:49,402 --> 00:32:51,404
I cracked.

739
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:57,584
How bad is it?

740
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:01,414
For our case?

741
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:03,982
I'd say it's
fairly catastrophic.

742
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,209
You want to tell me
what the hell happened

743
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:15,428
in court today, Dr. Bull?

744
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:17,343
No big deal.

745
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:20,172
It's just, your totally innocent
officer decided

746
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,826
to act on the stand
like she was... totally guilty.

747
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,480
It happens all the...

748
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:26,656
Wait. Actually,
it never happens.

749
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,310
Well, I'm glad you're so amused.

750
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:31,313
I've got reports that
my officers are being attacked

751
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,228
all over the city,
and right now,

752
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:37,058
I got a patrol car burning
in front of One Police Plaza.

753
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,060
We told you what to do.

754
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:41,149
Yes, you did.

755
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:43,760
You win. I give up.

756
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:46,589
You were right, so, let's
move to plan B, shall we?

757
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,591
Sit down and settle this thing.

758
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,071
Offer them
whatever you have to,

759
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:51,420
but just do it quickly.

760
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,293
We'll start making calls.

761
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,821
[line ringing]

762
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:06,000
On second thought, let's not
make any calls till morning.

763
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,483
What she said was indefensible.

764
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:11,701
I second that.

765
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:15,096
[sighs]
Indefensible. Absolutely.

766
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,794
The thing is, I'm not sure
I believe any of it.

767
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,145
What do you mean?

768
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,408
Well, in the car after court,

769
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,975
she was saying
how sorry she was.

770
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:27,108
She was shaking her head
the whole time,

771
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:29,110
and it's not an absolute,

772
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:31,982
but sometimes, that can indicate

773
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:35,160
a person doesn't believe
what they're saying.

774
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:37,466
Well, wait.
Why wouldn't she be sorry?

775
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,731
Her testimony basically
torpedoed the city's whole case.

776
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,603
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.

777
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:44,952
DANNY:
Please.

778
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:46,649
She's a racist.

779
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:48,303
Uh, people show you one face

780
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:50,697
when they know you're looking,
but the other one,

781
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,307
the real one--

782
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:55,136
it's always just peeking out
just a little bit,

783
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,269
laughing at you for getting
suckered by the mask.

784
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,140
If you say so.

785
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:02,404
It's not what I'm feeling.

786
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,279
Tomorrow?

787
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,237
Tomorrow.
[clears throat]

788
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,458
Danny, you have a copy
of that bodycam tape?

789
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:14,155
I want to give it another look.

790
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,288
Yeah, I'll send you the link.

791
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:17,637
One last thing.

792
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:24,122
Does anybody know where Cal
Peterson ended up throwing up?

793
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,689
Well, he was sick.

794
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:29,257
So sick he had to go
to the women's room.

795
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:32,304
But I don't recall hearing
about where he threw up.

796
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:35,481
You're right.
There was nothing about it

797
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:38,048
in the crime scene photos,
nothing in the notes.

798
00:35:39,485 --> 00:35:40,877
I get the feeling

799
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,358
we're not making any
settlement calls any time soon.

800
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,317
I get the feeling
we should order in.

801
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:48,189
[crowd shouting]

802
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,060
SCOTT:
Gentlemen?

803
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:51,845
Where are we?

804
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:54,195
Why am I totally
in the blind here?

805
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,066
Have we commenced
settlement discussions yet?

806
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,765
We have not.I don't understand.

807
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:01,898
You want the good news
or the bad news?Oh, come on.

808
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:03,857
I have finally come to believe

809
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,641
this case isn't
about race at all,

810
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:08,383
and I think that is cause
for celebration.

811
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:09,950
I'm not following you.

812
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:12,692
I think it's really about good
old-fashioned American greed.

813
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:15,651
And isn't it great
to know there exists

814
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,610
at least two people
in this world who can finally

815
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:20,526
look past race or skin color
or religious differences

816
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:23,268
long enough to try and rip off
the City of New York

817
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,183
for a few million dollars?

818
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:34,366
Now, from your
tox screen report,

819
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:36,411
we know that not
only were you

820
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,326
legally intoxicated
the night of the shooting,

821
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,067
but you were also high on Molly,

822
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,765
as well.

823
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,376
Mr. Peterson, I'm wondering

824
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:47,553
if you might have been high
and drunk that night on purpose.

825
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:50,730
I'm sorry.
I don't understand the question.

826
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:53,602
Well, I'm asking if perhaps
you drank to excess

827
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:55,517
and took some MDMA
in anticipation

828
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:56,997
of getting shot that night.

829
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,216
[gallery murmuring]

830
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,609
A little something
to numb the pain.

831
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:03,743
Objection! Now counsel is making
absurd assertions

832
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:05,745
in the hopes
of confusing the jury

833
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:08,008
and obfuscating facts
already in evidence.

834
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:09,749
Mr. Colón, I think

835
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,620
this courtroom has already seen
enough drama.

836
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:14,623
I agree, Your Honor,
but I promise if

837
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,582
you'll bear with
me a moment longer,

838
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,061
I will substantiate
my allegations.

839
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:20,934
Well, you'd better, or I will be
holding you in contempt.

840
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:23,502
It's a simple question,
Mr. Peterson.

841
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:26,287
Did you barge into that
bathroom that night

842
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:27,854
knowing full well
that you were going

843
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:29,638
to get shot by Officer Harris?

844
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:31,031
[scoffs]

845
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,642
Why would I want
to get shot by a cop?

846
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:37,907
So we could all end up here,

847
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:41,433
with you suing the City
of New York for $25 million.

848
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:42,738
[laughing]
That's ridiculous.

849
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:44,174
Well, yes.

850
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:47,439
Unless of course,
Officer Harris was in on it.

851

MALIA:
Your Honor, do I even

853
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,140
need to cite an objection?
This-this is outlandish![gavel bangs]

[gallery murmuring]

855
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:57,840
Yes, it is outlandish,
Your Honor, but I can assure you

856
00:37:57,884 --> 00:38:00,887
that I can prove that
Cal Peterson and Tonya Harris

857
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,368
are not the strangers
they've been pretending to be.

858
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:04,760
That, in fact,

859
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:07,328
they've been romantically
involved for months now.

860
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:08,721
[gallery clamoring]

861
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:10,636
What the hell is he doing?

862
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,726
You people are supposed
to be defending me.
Hmm.

863
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,989
Technically, the City of
New York is our client.

864
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:18,339
Since it seems you're
trying to swindle the city,

865
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:20,907
I fear you and I have a
serious conflict of interest.

866
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,300
[gavel banging]

867
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:24,519
Mr. Peterson, is this true?

868
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:25,825
Did you

869
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:27,653
plan this shooting
with Officer Harris?

870
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:29,655
Absolutely not.

871
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:31,526
Look at the bodycam footage.

872
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,006
I'm wrestling her for the gun.

873
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:35,095
Were you?

874
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:37,880
That's funny,
because the more I look at it,

875
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:41,406
the more it looks like you were
holding the barrel of the gun

876
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:43,495
to make sure
that the bullet went

877
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:45,323
into your arm
and not your chest.

878
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,107
[gallery murmuring]But...

879
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,588
that could just be me.

880
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,720
While you're thinking about it,
I'd like to enter

881
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:55,115
into evidence
this certified business record

882
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:59,032
of a history of Cal Peterson's
ridesharing customers.

883
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:00,816
And let the record reflect

884
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,340
that ten months ago,

885
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:05,691
he drove a Miss Tonya Harris.

886
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:08,084
Yeah. It's not surprising.

887
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:11,653
We all know he likes
to use the ridesharing vehicle

888
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:13,089
as his personal dating app.

889
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:16,876
I drive hundreds of women,
probably thousands.

890
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,878
[chuckles]

891
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:22,360
But in truth, I don'tremember
driving that woman.

892
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:31,194
BENNY:
Mr. Peterson,

893
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:34,937
would it surprise you
to know that the...

894
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:38,506
front desk clerk at the
Bridgecroft Motel in Astoria

895
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,988
remembers checking you in
at least 23 times

896
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,424
in the last
ten months?

897
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,905
No. It wouldn't surprise me.

898
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:48,081
My roommates can get loud.

899
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:50,736
Sometimes I rent a cheap room
to grade papers,

900
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:54,740
prepare lesson plans. Alone.

901
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,742
[inhales sharply]

902
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:58,439
Are you aware

903
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:00,920
that there is video surveillance
cameras in the hallways,

904
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:06,534
so the clerk can see if,
say, Tonya Harris decided

905
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:09,058
to join you
in your room?

906
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:11,496
I'd be happy to enter
the video surveillance cameras

907
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:12,975
into evidence if you'd like.

908
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:16,457
Or perhaps I can just call
Tonya Harris to the stand,

909
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:19,852
see what she has to say.

910
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:22,202
But...

911
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:24,726
you know,
as a former prosecutor,

912
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,730
I should tell you that
the person who confesses first

913
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:31,298
is usually the one
who gets the lighter sentence.

914
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:48,271
You are still under oath,
Officer Harris.

915
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:57,846
We were lying in bed one night
at the Bridgecroft Motel,

916
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:03,286
and he turned to me,
and he said...

917
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:08,378
"You know, darlin',
I'd take a bullet for you."

918
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:14,472
And the idea just grew
from there.

919
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:32,359
How many years you
think they'll get?

920
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,709
Whatever it is,
it's not long enough.

921
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:40,846
I'm not sure I ever
made it clear, but...

922
00:41:40,889 --> 00:41:43,588
I admire the
hell out of you.

923
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,636
[chuckles softly]

924
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,551
[sighs]

925
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:52,988
Would you like to get a drink?

926
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:58,864
I would love to
get a drink, but, uh...

927
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:00,082
[inhales sharply]

928
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:03,172
I'm sort of between drinks
right now.

929
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:08,482
If that circumstance
should ever change,

930
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,571
you can be sure
that I will, uh...

931
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:13,443
I'll call you first.

932
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:16,142
Well, we don't have to drink.

933
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:18,884
Oh, trust me. If you're gonna be
spending any time

934
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:21,451
with me at all,
you are gonna need a drink.

935
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:22,888
I have that on good authority

936
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:25,543
from a great
many women.[laughs]

937
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:31,244
Well, don't look now, but...

938
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:34,377
I just might call you.

939
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:39,513
Don't you threaten me,
young lady.[laughs]
