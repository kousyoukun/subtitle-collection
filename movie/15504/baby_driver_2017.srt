00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,811
... Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen now I will tell you about

5
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:48,442
... wonderful, and the strongest here

6
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:51,466
"Driver" Baby

<Font color="#FFFF00">"Baby" </ font>

8
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,838
Dear customer

9
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:29,981
Dear customer, can I ask your request

10
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:36,151
Yes, I want four cups of coffee

11
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:37,596
 The name? -
"Baby" -

12
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:38,638
"Baby"

13
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,576
(AFP)
"Baby"

14
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:49,357
"Baby"

15
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,540
<Font color="#FFFF00">Authorities say they stole $ 200,000 </ font>

16
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,743
What is this sermon?

17
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:10,713
Bibi, "four"
Seven thousand each

18
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,761
Doc "I mean he's disabled"

19
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,131
Disabled means slow
Is it slow?

20
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,801
Both-
So do not seem handicapped for me -


21
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:24,223
He is a good and excellent boy behind the wheel
What do we want from him after the hell?

22
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:29,041
So you do not think there are speeches in it
He never speaks

23
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:31,698
There is no problem with a little calm

24
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:35,954
You who I call "Bibi" true?
Even before you hear his first words

25
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:49,232
"So you are dumb, babe
is not it?

26
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:53,921
Are you dumb?
Both-

27
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:57,230
...So

28
00:09:57,677 --> 00:10:00,469
What are you listening to?
Music-

29
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,294
"That's right, tell him," Baby

30
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:09,370
In your Lord, "Grif" leave the boy alone


31
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:14,204
You can not be in the crime scene without being
A small criminal

32
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:17,152
I just want to find out
What is going on in this brain

33
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:21,634
...In addition to
Music (reggae) Egyptian

34
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:23,479
And what do you mean?

35
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:26,576
Just think that he thinks he is better than us

36
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:31,907
When he sits in his car keeping clean
His white shirt while we roll in the mud

37
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:38,221
Someday, "Bibi," your hands will be stained with blood

38
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,711
You will discover that this kind of dirt can not
Wash it on the sink

39
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:45,073
Calm down, the boy did his work

40
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,704
I never said that the boy is not good at work
On the contrary, I think he is a star

41
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:54,196
What if it is not?

42
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:02,764
We would have taken a vote

43
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:07,566
Either solid as nails
Or cowardly to the extreme

44
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:10,459
What is it?

45
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:28,099
"Do you think about this, babe?"
I mean pleasure in this

46
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:29,080
Enough

47
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,767
When will you stop this?

48
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:34,020
Here

49
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:40,142
Well guys, if you do not see me again
That means I have died

50
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:44,447
Tell me about the night, my darling

51
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:49,786
Tonight will be the greatest revolution
 Well worth doing

52
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:56,420
This is the greatest I have ever heard or passed

53
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:05,125
Well, sir, I'll pick up the girl for a while
Until the media is quiet about us

54
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:12,008
The "Baby" was well lit
When "Doc" calls you again, do not lift the speaker

55
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:14,678
Do not listen to him

56
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:23,914
Learn I enjoy too
By taking candy from kids

57
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:28,923
But, the most important part of the day
...And you

58
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:32,450
You are paid

59
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,639
Another task and the end of this -
Another task and being equal, is that good?

60
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:45,985
... I would say that we are equal but

61
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:48,002
this is for you

62
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,406
Now give me the damaged phone

63
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,395
I will need you behind the wheel very soon

64
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:58,599
call me

90
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:36,264
Sir, what will I bring you this beautiful morning?


91
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:42,430
It does not matter if I wait a bit
I have all the time in the world

92
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:45,241
Are you registering this?

93
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:48,196
Will my efficiency be evaluated?

94
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,029
Both

95
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:52,892
Open it, hello

96
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:56,460
How can I serve you this beautiful morning, sir?

97
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:02,018
It's kids meals on the idea

98
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:04,638
I have finished it

99
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,547
Has your day just begun, or are you finished?

100
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:11,308
I do not know if I can finish
They always call

101
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:15,916
What is your job?

102
00:18:17,173 --> 00:18:17,912
I am a driver

103
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,444
As a special driver
Reach important people

104
00:18:21,842 --> 00:18:24,389
I think it's like that -
Do I know these people?

105
00:18:24,592 --> 00:18:27,631
I do not know-
you are mysterious-

106
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:31,561
Maybe-
!Maybe-

107
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:34,177
When was the last time you drove the car?
For fun only

108
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,233
yesterday

109
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:42,655
I'm jealous, all I want is to go west by car
No one owns the planet

110
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:47,237
Just me and the music and the way -
I would also like this -

111
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:54,346
Have you decided to ask for something?
You are very beautiful-

112
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,804
I just decided this
OK thanks

113
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:01,398
You do not mean it for sure -
I really mean it -

114
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,289
Jonathan

115
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:08,140
Sorry this is not my card
I just started working here

116
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:12,578
"Is it" Jonathan -
"Order" Jonathan -

117
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,398
If you have more questions, call me

118
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,052
I have a question

119
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:24,950
What is the name of this song

120
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,024
<Font color="#FFFF00">I agree </ font>

121
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,313
<Font color="#FFFF00">on the song? </ Font>

122
00:19:57,469 --> 00:19:59,117
<Font color="#FFFF00">Girl </ font>

123
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,013
<Font color="#FFFF00">Here you are
"I called you" Baby </ font>

124
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,857
Right?

125
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,911
<Font color="#FFFF00">The hen's order has just put a big egg - </ font>

126
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,044
<Font color="#FFFF00">Are you involved? </ Font>

127
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:27,106
I will participate

128
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:30,794
<Font color="#FFFF00">was a metaphor
Baby "You're with us" </ font>

129
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:32,294
I will be here

130
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,701
Meet the new team

131
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:48,194
Here is the "hands" noseless
"Called" the hands of the nose

132
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:53,373
How did this happen-
Do not ask about this is my first rule -

133
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:56,678
This "Jay Di" put the Asians in an emergency

134
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:02,475
"Here's the unique" Bates-
No need for introductions "Doc" work will explain what our-

135
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:09,391
He's a true killer?
Who listens to music all the time

136
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,727
Good driver needs eyes and ears
These are the eyes

137
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:18,977
"Why do you listen to music all the time?"
Does he have mental problems?

138
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,742
Both I'm mentally ill in the group
Will not take my place

139
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:24,290
Has a buzz in the ear

140
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:25,672
He has what?

141
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:31,961
He was exposed to a small accident and he always heard the sounds of roads
And noise is heard for the music to fit

142
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,547
Do what pleases you

143
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:41,666
Cap?
Does tattoo mean hat?

144
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:47,573
So I wanted to tattoo the word hate
But because of the fiscal deficit they deleted the last letter

145
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:50,960
Does this benefit you?
I hate hats -

146
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:54,684
How many tasks did the boy do?

147
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:58,598
If you do not trust my words, promise
Go back where you came from

148
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:00,857
Have you ever heard of the spirit of the 85th Street?

149
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,965
Is this the?

150
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:07,708
The ghost who tricked the police on the streets of 130 and 85

151
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:14,231
Cutting off their contacts and taking them at a crossroads
He evades them every time

152
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:15,301
This is a gift

153
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:18,224
This is 10 years ago -
As I said it was a boy -

154
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:20,911
He maneuvered the cars without fear of death

155
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:27,286
I stole my Mercedes before my eyes and did not stop him
Because I admire this boy boldly

156
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:31,565
Of course he did not know who I was
Or even the value of the car that he stole

157
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:37,509
And when I followed him to tell him who I was
What I am capable of doing and how much he owes me

158
00:22:37,714 --> 00:22:40,714
As long as he can not pay, he sees me
What he can do

159
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:47,830
I have just charted the next process chart carefully
This is amazing, is not it?

160
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:52,283
Arise to discuss it
"Are you with us?"

161
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:38,231
We'll start in the morning
Are there any questions?

162
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:41,183
"I have a question," Doc

163
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,753
I think this arrogant did not score anything
Of the plan in his mind

164
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:47,418
He stayed still
He did not even listen

165
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,184
"Baby"

166
00:23:56,338 --> 00:24:02,612
The goal of our mission is to take money and form a path
To cross, we have someone inside information

167
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:07,199
The bank will be a joint in the haloin
So the process should be done within a minute

168
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:11,619
We also have a distraction team
We make some explosions to keep people busy

169
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:17,791
The costume is a mask (Michael Meyer) but do not bounce it off
At the same time it raises doubts

170
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:23,778
Auto replacement is ready in position
We should use cars that keep us safe for as long as possible

171
00:24:24,074 --> 00:24:27,840
Such as a family car
Or something that benefits us in congestion

172
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:34,004
A kind of solid car benefits us more
Whatever

173
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:37,449
We should be ready at 8:30 am
To start

174
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:39,864
any questions?

175
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:41,957
Cunning

176
00:24:42,387 --> 00:24:43,535
"This is" Bibi

177
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:45,309
Hurt your gesture

178
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:13,033
Everything inside
Back to us

179
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:20,299
It's our money, it's our right
They took it from us yesterday while we were asleep

180
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,877
They took what we deserved

181
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:28,330
Let's get back our right

182
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:33,969
What did you do?

183
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,227
"Austin Powers"

184
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,477
"He said," Michael Myers-
"This is Mike Myers-

185
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:41,431
It had to be a Halloween mask -
It's a Halloween mask -

186
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,651
 It should have been for the halo-
"So you are" Jason-

187
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,581
Both

188
00:25:46,924 --> 00:25:50,276
let's go-
Hey wait i have to fill this song first -

189
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:53,743
!What is that

190
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:57,067
Come on, go

191
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:31,772
Let's run away

192
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,357
I managed this

193
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,100
It's hard work

194
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,595
Whatch out

195
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,533
What is that
Our hero

196
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:01,607
"Come on, baby."
let's go

197
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:08,743
Be careful

198
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:44,281
What is still following us

199
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:25,763
We must disappear from this path

200
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:29,095
Let's go

201
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:37,118
Come on, guys, run
Move

202
00:28:37,423 --> 00:28:40,025
Say hello baby

203
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,024
Get out of the car

204
00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:46,422
I have a baby-
I have one too -

205
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:50,772
Come on
Let us move

206
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:57,742
The fastest thing to do
Baby "Get the baby out of the car"

207
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:03,492
Let's go

208
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,503
I left the gun

209
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:22,504
What?

210
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,504
I left my gun there

211
00:29:24,652 --> 00:29:27,964
Not a good movement
at all

212
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,863
Damn
They dropped

213
00:29:55,834 --> 00:30:00,147
<Font color="#FFFF00">To all units search for a stolen red car </ font>

214
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:16,887
Is this "Jay De" there?

215
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:18,497
"" Jay Di "and" Eddie

216
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:26,528
I have a question for you
Did you deliberately make me wrong that breakthrough?

217
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:33,236
come on man
tell me

218
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:35,970
Both

219
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:40,913
You are a good driver
But you do not know how to lie

220
00:30:43,764 --> 00:30:44,607
In this work

221
00:30:45,288 --> 00:30:49,772
The more you feel
The chance of receiving a shot increased

222
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:53,811
Now take the bag and go get the coffee

223
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,592
Come on

224
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,006
"Are you looking for" Jay De

225
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:38,457
mystery man
"Been gone a while ago," Bibi

226
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:59,201
This is the end
And I am at my time

227
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:04,217
And you are free now

228
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:06,701
That's it?

229
00:32:07,256 --> 00:32:11,194
Yes sure
Payment has been made, maybe we celebrate

230
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:12,881
Yes sure

231
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,615
Before he cheats on you

232
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:27,912
You have to hide that car

233
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:30,436
"Keep your safety" Bibi

234
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:09,673
I `m back-
Yes sure-

235
00:35:09,837 --> 00:35:15,744
For your knowledge only, sir, you will be my last customer
Because I will leave through the door after half a minute

236
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:17,611
Are you leaving?
Sir-

237
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,470
Can I go with you?
A. Do not have a job to do?

238
00:35:23,095 --> 00:35:25,970
Both
I've finished working

239
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,298
Look happy about this -
Yes sure-

240
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:31,360
I do not blame you

241
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:35,665
I welcome you with me, but I do not know
If you find it really exciting

242
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:38,056
Worth a bit

243
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,431
Think about what you want and I'll just get back to you

244
00:35:43,302 --> 00:35:46,154
coffee?-
Please, with generous and sugar-

245
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:49,013
How is it going?

246
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:52,239
good
It's a nice not like that?

247
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:56,834
It seems familiar
I think his mother was working here

248
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:03,925
Well what do you want?

249
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:09,160
Your Name?-
You will not get it for free -

250
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:12,199
"My name is Debbie
"Debra"

251
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:13,863
As in the song

252
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:15,105
That song?

253
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:19,964
(It was (d
(This is a dvr

254
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:20,894
I do not know this

255
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:23,300
OK then

256
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,248
"Jenny"

257
00:36:36,772 --> 00:36:41,318
"The song speaks of" Jenny "and her sister," Debre

258
00:36:41,623 --> 00:36:47,147
It's not about me originally about her sister
"My sister's name" Mary

259
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:49,130
She has several songs in her name

260
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:54,295
Many albums by her name

261
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,545
I was overwhelmed by this

262
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,647
She has a lot of songs
I have one

263
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:00,920
You have two songs

264
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:03,116
What else?

265
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,482
You know what I'm talking about
"Trix"

266
00:37:07,545 --> 00:37:08,397
"Te Perks"

267
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:13,045
Yup-
I heard it but I do not think it has a girl name -

268
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:22,361
Zebra?

269
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,431
As zebra as I think

270
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:27,556
well, okay
"You can call me" Debre

271
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,931
I think I should be busy

272
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:33,720
How many do you have of these?

273
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:38,298
I have several devices by mood and day

274
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:40,814
And you are in a bright pink mood now

275
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:42,689
Yup

276
00:37:45,802 --> 00:37:47,795
what is your name?-
"Baby" -

277
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:52,381
"Hey is your name" baby
(AFP)

278
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:53,052
Yup

279
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:57,942
You have all these letters (b)
There are not many songs for you

280
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:02,418
We can drive back and forth forever
"On the songs" Baby

281
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,614
As if I never occupy it

282
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,354
Did your mother use your "baby" when?
I was young ?

283
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:10,838
Sometimes

284
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:12,003
Are you still working here?

285
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:17,416
Sometimes
She was a singer in fact

286
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:19,792
What are you doing now

287
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:22,237
nothing

288
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:26,264
I do not know

289
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:29,592
"Debbie"
Gosh

290
00:38:32,384 --> 00:38:36,110
She filled me when I was not forced to advance
From here we agreed?

291
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:37,696
We agreed

292
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:40,368
Have not you decided what you want yet?

293
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,876
I want to leave here

294
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:05,410
OK
I really loved it

295
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:11,175
"So what's your story?" Baby
Are you from here?

296
00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:15,464
Yup-
Follow the conversation Haya-

297
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,823
You are here and the driver loves music
Do not talk too much

298
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:28,487
No, I talked to you more today than I do in a year

299
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,988
This is new information

300
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,378
I have hearing problems

301
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:41,378
I had an accident when I was young

302
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:44,996
Is this what happened to Lamk -
For this reason-

303
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:50,558
I'm sorry

304
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:56,565
No, not you, I live with my adoptive father
But it's big so I'm taking care of it

305
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:58,480
Learn how this looks

306
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:02,301
I took care of my mother when she got sick

307
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:04,863
I may sound strong now

308
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,785
But when you lose the person you care for

309
00:40:09,418 --> 00:40:11,496
There is no reason to stay

310
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:23,754
We may meet again at a different time and place

311
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:28,340
We mean to meet in a new laundry

312
00:40:28,418 --> 00:40:30,808
Maybe it's nice

313
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,933
Or we can go to

314
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:36,442
(Paquanilla)

315
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:39,145
I did not just visit it I heard it

316
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:43,637
It's the best place you can be

317
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:44,778
that's sweet

318
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:50,473
Currently I have to take care of some things
What do you think next week?

319
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:51,668
I do not know

320
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:54,770
We may drink something

321
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,239
No, it's not worth it

322
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:59,020
A no longer leads -
Both-

323
00:40:59,684 --> 00:41:02,332
I'm sorry-
No No You -

324
00:41:03,075 --> 00:41:04,676
You are not lucky

325

00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:58,931
Are you okay?
Your account has been paid in advance

342
00:43:59,322 --> 00:44:00,509
Mr?

343
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:03,585
who is this?

344
00:44:05,265 --> 00:44:06,343
Main

345
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:11,992
Excuse me for a moment

346
00:44:20,206 --> 00:44:23,823
"Good Meal Me" Baby
It seems that the water has returned to its sewer

347
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:25,057
Yup

348
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:27,481
You avoid seeing me why?

349
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:31,622
I said that you are free
But does this mean you're done?

three hundred fifty
00:44:33,028 --> 00:44:34,060
I think so

351
00:44:34,286 --> 00:44:38,481
I wanted to tell you good and bad news
But there is no bad news

352
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:44,442
Good news that you will make a lot of money
And the good news is that you will make a fortune

353
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:46,146
"I have a job" Doc

354
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:51,138
Jobs like pizza arrive pizza to save money a day
One here

355
00:44:51,591 --> 00:44:54,512
While you can do a great job with me

356
00:44:54,794 --> 00:44:58,473
Where you can go out to these places
Every day of the week

357
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:02,763
You paid your debts and it was time to collect profits
"This is the good side" Bibi

358
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:09,091
Once we finish the work you will become very rich

359
00:45:09,895 --> 00:45:11,044
what do you say
Are you with us?

360
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:13,161
Do I have to?

361
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:18,059
Do not ask me another question
Give me a yes or no answer

362
00:45:20,481 --> 00:45:21,309
Both

363
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:26,677
You know I'm not doing assignments
Same team twice

364
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:27,653
Yup

365
00:45:27,911 --> 00:45:30,622
But you've been the driver in all the tasks since we met

366
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:41,076
So I'm thinking of you as a magical bright
I will not do anything without you

367
00:45:42,287 --> 00:45:46,833
I do not want to go into the talk of your rejection and what will happen to you
Break your legs and kill everyone you love

368
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,670
Because you know this as Alice

369
00:45:52,123 --> 00:45:55,412
What is your answer, behind the wheel
Or the wheelchair

370
00:45:56,482 --> 00:45:57,396
First

371
00:46:00,084 --> 00:46:04,006
I'll call you in the morning
do not stay up too much

372
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:10,420
Your girlfriend and waitress are very nice
keep it safe

373
00:46:17,123 --> 00:46:20,873
It was a wonderful dinner and delight

374
00:46:21,123 --> 00:46:23,693
Your high-ranking friend has done his duty

375
00:46:24,388 --> 00:46:25,787
I do not know

376
00:46:28,482 --> 00:46:30,115
"All is well" Baby

377
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:34,787
Things will be fine

378
00:46:35,748 --> 00:46:42,873
Do you want to talk, make me coffee
I mean very bad coffee

379
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:47,326
I want this but I can not now

380
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,357
You do not have to worry about me
You can tell me anything

381
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:56,998
I'm not worried about you
I mean

382
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:01,662
 You are the best thing that has happened to me for a long time

383
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:05,677
I am worried about

384
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,716
I'm not suitable for you

385
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,630
I see you are cute
And different

386
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:23,396
I'll be beside you

387
00:47:35,642 --> 00:47:36,908
What are you doing tomorrow

388
00:47:39,571 --> 00:47:40,774
you tell me

389
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:04,938
good morning

390
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:09,945
This place never loses its value

391
00:48:10,258 --> 00:48:12,937
People do not realize that there is gold there

392
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:16,891
While performing non-profit jobs

393
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:21,266
We are supposed to be here tomorrow
But I want something from you today

394
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:23,398
Can not publicly show there while
You can

395
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:31,234
Go inside and know the number of cameras and their locations
Records, records, employees and customers

396
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,305
If there are armed guards
Or glass against lead

397
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:40,289
I bought some stamps
Unplug your headphones and remove the glasses

398
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:44,657
Take the child with you
Less suspicious

399
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:20,015
There is no insulating glass
And one armed security guard

400
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:22,554
Ten cameras and eight recorders

401
00:49:22,672 --> 00:49:25,524
2 customers and 11 customers
And four employees

402
00:49:27,032 --> 00:49:27,953
Thank

403
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,244
Stamps

404
00:49:36,884 --> 00:49:37,869
this is your son?

405
00:49:38,587 --> 00:49:39,275
Yup

406
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:42,728
How old is he?

407
00:49:44,392 --> 00:49:44,845
four

408
00:49:45,236 --> 00:49:45,853
eight

409
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,853
He grows up quickly

410
00:49:51,384 --> 00:49:52,626
What is his name?

411
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:55,150
A. Do not have a name?

412
00:49:55,634 --> 00:49:56,158
Poisonous

413
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,267
Well oh "Sam" I have a candy on them name

414
00:49:59,744 --> 00:50:02,150
"Do you have one on it" Sam

415
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:04,595
Nice

416
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:06,892
Are you here tomorrow?

417
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:09,189
Of course here
Always present

418
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:14,030
hard work
Good day

419
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:15,171
So it is

420
00:50:15,585 --> 00:50:19,726
Everyone wants happiness without pain
But you can not get a rainbow without rain

421
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:21,616
This is inevitable

422
00:50:22,997 --> 00:50:24,122
Yes sure

423
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:25,623
Good-bye

424
00:50:36,335 --> 00:50:37,014
speak

425
00:50:38,006 --> 00:50:38,983
No insulating glass

426
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:40,428
One armed guard

427
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:44,131
Ten cameras
Eight recorders

428
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:47,866
And 11 customers

429
00:50:51,764 --> 00:50:53,358
And four employees

430
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:54,530
any thing else?

431
00:50:56,264 --> 00:50:57,366
The employee looks nice

432
00:50:57,694 --> 00:50:58,655
She gave me candy

433
00:50:59,155 --> 00:51:00,014
Oh really?

434
00:51:00,241 --> 00:51:03,334
So there is no need to use the weapon with it

435
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:06,249
Just hide your voice and it will disappear

436
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,444
He seems to know it well

437
00:51:18,515 --> 00:51:19,726
In which floor is it?

438
00:51:21,132 --> 00:51:21,835
the first

439
00:51:22,522 --> 00:51:25,397
The stairs seem cumbersome to him

440
00:51:27,038 --> 00:51:30,124
It's my job to know everything
Is it like that?

441
00:51:31,382 --> 00:51:32,171
There is an elevator

442
00:51:35,077 --> 00:51:36,522
Let's see

443
00:51:37,944 --> 00:51:40,655
So, will I see you tonight?

444
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:42,733
Yup

445
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,233
You do not just say what I want to hear right?
You can be considered a friend

446
00:51:49,413 --> 00:51:52,663
You and I are a team
Nothing is more important than our friendship

447
00:51:53,827 --> 00:51:54,726
I was happy to hear this

448
00:51:55,530 --> 00:52:00,101
You will be out of this quagmire soon
You will have your own world

449
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,858
Head the restaurant with you
Please

450
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,257
Is Debra available?

451
00:52:13,905 --> 00:52:16,842
Debbie "Call for you"
Do not talk to me

452
00:52:18,577 --> 00:52:19,968
Hello-
"With You" Baby-

453
00:52:22,062 --> 00:52:23,554
What do I owe for this call?

454
00:52:24,983 --> 00:52:26,304
You just wanted to hear your voice

455
00:52:27,288 --> 00:52:28,554
Are we still on our date?

456
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:30,374
I returned to lead again

457
00:52:31,437 --> 00:52:34,593
OK
I thought you finished this work

458
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,858
me too

459
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:38,265
This is not what I want

460
00:52:39,296 --> 00:52:40,968
What do you want, Baby?

461
00:52:42,241 --> 00:52:44,312
I just want to go west

462
00:52:45,483 --> 00:52:47,265
Very expensive car

463
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,507
No one owns it

464
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:53,640
I kept walking nonstop

465
00:52:54,937 --> 00:52:57,327
are you serious?-
"Debra"

466
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:01,944
would you come with me?-
"Baby"

467
00:53:03,312 --> 00:53:04,194
see you soon

468
00:53:23,275 --> 00:53:24,416
Here it is

469
00:53:25,486 --> 00:53:26,861
"Hi baby

470
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,400
I knew he would return

471
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:30,471
Did you see the boy driving?
Yup-

472
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,829
I think Doc always needs him because he can
Corner of the car in the place for the disabled

473
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:36,048
Place for people with special needs

474
00:53:36,431 --> 00:53:39,259
It does not matter
This time is different

475
00:53:39,454 --> 00:53:43,368
He listens to music all day long
He drives the earphones in his ear

476
00:53:43,626 --> 00:53:49,228
Damn
Do you know who has the same qualities?

477
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:51,150
"Barbara Streisand"

478
00:53:51,298 --> 00:53:53,868
"Do not say it as if I knew nothing about Barbara
Damn these

479
00:53:53,915 --> 00:53:57,548
Pay attention to your character
You talk to a lady

480
00:53:57,689 --> 00:53:58,165
Yup

481
00:53:59,868 --> 00:54:00,697
Pay attention to your character

482
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:02,540
I am aware of what I want

483
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:12,498
Is it true that you listen to music all the time
Relieves noise

484
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,397
Keep me moving

485
00:54:16,092 --> 00:54:18,641
In order to escape
 I understood it

486
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,571
Hey yelled I saw all those hostile
... this hostility

487
00:54:21,743 --> 00:54:22,329
shut up

488
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,141
I used to drive around in my car

489
00:54:27,454 --> 00:54:29,993
I drive all night and listen to the radio

490
00:54:30,806 --> 00:54:33,001
There was that song

491
00:54:33,891 --> 00:54:37,407
That unleashes me
And make me the right car Do you have this kind?

492
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:39,048
Certainly

493
00:54:40,149 --> 00:54:41,040
What's her name?

494
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:42,352
(Raid & Rock)

495
00:54:42,548 --> 00:54:44,345
!What
(Queen)?

496
00:54:46,977 --> 00:54:48,961
With this huge guitar

497
00:54:49,126 --> 00:54:52,618
My brother used to do that kind of thing
Of songs

498
00:54:53,321 --> 00:54:54,282
Do you have one of them

499
00:54:54,634 --> 00:54:55,766
I have these

500
00:54:57,173 --> 00:54:59,446
Fill it
To see this passionate song

501
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:19,268
What are you listening to?

502
00:55:19,502 --> 00:55:20,447
(Queen)

503
00:55:21,525 --> 00:55:26,002
(Streisand) and (Queen)
Do you attack that we came to work for this?

504
00:55:26,487 --> 00:55:32,932
You do not need this nonsense just you
Dodge on the fuel and drive that damned car

505
00:55:33,986 --> 00:55:35,479
This music does not work in focus

506
00:55:38,057 --> 00:55:41,237
You are not a real man
If you do not have a luck song

507
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,010
Cigarette and music
And a glass of wine

508
00:55:45,627 --> 00:55:48,291
Certainly
But not during work

509
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,893
I have demons in my head
Play music all the time

510
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:53,307
We will believe this

511
00:55:53,448 --> 00:55:57,940
Know someone leaving the job. Did you know why?
There was a song on the radio that he did not like

512
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,049
We wanted to enter
He wanted to get off the car

513
00:56:01,534 --> 00:56:04,752
(Because the song (roads on the door of Paradise
She was working on the radio

514
00:56:05,263 --> 00:56:06,153
(It is said (Hexus

515
00:56:06,817 --> 00:56:10,583
This is the song "Hotel California" for the Falcons

516
00:56:10,817 --> 00:56:11,888
(It is said (Hexos

517
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:15,169
It seems like we're all going to die

518
00:56:15,435 --> 00:56:16,810
Do you want to quit work?

519
00:56:16,872 --> 00:56:20,989
Both I want to get money
All of us will die in the end

520
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:25,974
He became jittery at work
It no longer has to do with theft

521
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:29,169
Do all your stories end with someone dying?

522
00:56:30,466 --> 00:56:32,411
I think we just discovered this

523
00:56:34,763 --> 00:56:38,036
I have 4 pairs of eyes and three ears
Get ready

524
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:53,588
Mail services are now parked
People are no longer interested in it

525
00:56:53,971 --> 00:56:57,932
Fortunately
Their loss is our gain

526
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,924
Requests for money

527
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:05,978
Know someone who has a machine that can convert
The black leaves are green

528
00:57:06,112 --> 00:57:11,611
Each box contains 250 packages
Each package is equal to 1,000

529
00:57:11,948 --> 00:57:13,573
This means a quarter of a million in one fund

530
00:57:16,143 --> 00:57:17,526
Darling "go ahead"

531
00:57:17,854 --> 00:57:21,057
Paddy "is counting and then follow those who are inside"

532
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:26,393
These glasses are worn to jam the surveillance camera

533
00:57:26,698 --> 00:57:28,112
After you take the money

534
00:57:28,283 --> 00:57:31,564
Darling "Take Your Track"
Badi "Book a hostage and turn the gun towards his head"

535
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:34,330
This brings you guys to the back office

536
00:57:35,135 --> 00:57:37,510
Flag and execute

537
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,885
Baby "will remain in the download area"

538
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:45,127
Bates "uses this security card with the name"
An inside man has nose problems

539
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,291
In order to ensure crew passage

540
00:57:47,401 --> 00:57:52,221
And you young people brought the boxes and infiltrated
To "Bibi" where he is waiting for you

541

Companies Companies Companies Directory Directory Directory
Yup-

542
00:57:58,255 --> 00:58:01,103
There is something else
We must get some good weapons

543

00:59:12,864 --> 00:59:14,223
Definitely so

557
00:59:15,528 --> 00:59:16,996
We must stop that person

558
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:22,754
Any one of them, who stole you or who is your idol
The whore, or the one who scoffed at you

559
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,926
the last

560
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:26,090
Yup
Remember this

561
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:28,700
Bates "mocked me"

562
00:59:32,129 --> 00:59:33,489
"Do you want me to kill" Bates

563
00:59:34,426 --> 00:59:36,973
Not before we finish this

564
00:59:38,786 --> 00:59:40,965
"Do you think it is right to talk before" Bibi

565
00:59:41,457 --> 00:59:44,411
He will not say anything
"It's not like you," Baby

566
00:59:47,411 --> 00:59:48,301
Gosh

567
00:59:49,606 --> 00:59:50,926
Have you stolen all this?

568
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:53,707
I said you want gum
And I brought it to you

569
00:59:54,577 --> 00:59:55,342
Let's go

570
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,029
It seems that this will not end

571
01:00:10,397 --> 01:00:13,920
"Duke" said that we should see the butcher

572
01:00:50,403 --> 01:00:53,630
Come on with us
Will not remain lonely

573
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:05,445
He tried to hear us
In the event that things are done

574
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:09,375
Take this

575
01:01:10,047 --> 01:01:11,195
I do not know how to use it

576
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,500
You'll need it

577
01:01:13,453 --> 01:01:16,984
We had to wear proper clothes
So we do not seem to be a bunch of cowards

578
01:01:21,313 --> 01:01:24,039
What he wrote this
Do you score anything?

579
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:27,227
Listen to music -
So he loves his tunes -

580
01:01:27,899 --> 01:01:29,383
What do you listen to?

581
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,047
I do not know to see

582
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:37,294
(Takila)

583
01:01:38,939 --> 01:01:42,611
Reminds me of Mexicans when they throw
Their wives from the slope

584
01:01:44,697 --> 01:01:45,986
We met before true?

585
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,533
I do not know
Do you remember?

586
01:01:49,408 --> 01:01:50,681
I do not think we met

587
01:01:52,119 --> 01:01:54,072
Play

588
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:02,173
Welcome here

589
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:11,024
My Lady and Madam Madam, we have the best
The pieces in our humble home

590
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:19,954
I think your experience will make you aware that the pig
Whole cooking from nose to tail

591
01:02:20,048 --> 01:02:24,306
Offer you nine pieces at the best price

592
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:30,916
Since you are starving, this is the best option

593
01:02:31,462 --> 01:02:36,321
The shoulders and the heart came broken but strong
And good taste

594
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,478
These pieces are for those who prefer smoked meat

595
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:46,876
One piece or multiple pieces or some ribs
Everything we have

596
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:50,501
Definitely all delicious

597
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:55,048
Definitely order and we have a good selection of sausages

598
01:02:55,462 --> 01:02:56,181
I grew up

599
01:02:56,384 --> 01:02:57,275
Their taste is delicious

600
01:02:58,267 --> 01:02:59,830
So what is your choice

601
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:04,454
We will know this soon
Because I will prepare a chimney

602
01:03:44,302 --> 01:03:46,684
Woe to you what you did
I did not like this

603
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:48,934
Calm down, "Paddy" has taken over

604
01:03:49,012 --> 01:03:52,996
What have you done, scum?
I did not fire that way

605
01:03:53,044 --> 01:03:55,364
They were evil
Hey, what? It's fake

606
01:03:55,442 --> 01:04:00,645
(Look at the boxes it (APD
Sure, their intention was bad with this whole falsehood

607
01:04:00,888 --> 01:04:01,864
how do you know

608
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:09,669
I do not know anything about your sweetheart or your pride
If anyone tries to hurt me, I will

609
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,442
Baby "Do not let him run away"

610
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:26,343
"Take the car" Baby
let's go

611
01:04:26,585 --> 01:04:28,351
Let's move

612
01:04:58,962 --> 01:05:00,915
That was crazy

613
01:05:01,157 --> 01:05:03,711
If you do not want to undo
It would be crazy

614
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:07,353
I do not know, you're crazy
"But your real name is not Bates

615
01:05:07,509 --> 01:05:08,579
And so are you

616
01:05:08,642 --> 01:05:10,532
"Do you think my real name is" Darling

617
01:05:10,649 --> 01:05:13,056
"And even" Paddy
Both are titles

618
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:15,243
Symbolic names or signs

619
01:05:16,196 --> 01:05:18,196
So what is your real name?

620
01:05:18,743 --> 01:05:19,704
"Monica"

621
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:23,946
I do not think it's allowed to discuss names -
We do not discuss-

622
01:05:25,071 --> 01:05:26,876
Baby "What's your real name"

623
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:34,235
stop here
stop here

624
01:05:35,821 --> 01:05:37,337
I said stop I'm hungry

625
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:39,212
Both

626
01:05:39,931 --> 01:05:41,259
Park

627
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:46,681
Both?
You tell me both?

628
01:05:48,415 --> 01:05:50,431
I do not want to go there

629
01:05:52,642 --> 01:05:59,040
What's your "baby" paddy sitting in the back
They did not say a word, are you better than him or what?

630
01:06:00,781 --> 01:06:02,414
I do not want to go there
The place is disgusting

631
01:06:03,015 --> 01:06:06,226
Despite all this
We will go now

632
01:06:36,133 --> 01:06:39,047
Why are you always blamed?
Do not hurt if you are grateful

633
01:06:39,407 --> 01:06:41,023
With your work this

634
01:06:41,227 --> 01:06:43,391
I do my job as if it were the last

635
01:06:43,454 --> 01:06:46,133
What you do within the total is the result of all of us

636
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:49,102
Do not worry you'll get your share tomorrow
...In addition to

637
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,563
Fees at work

638
01:06:51,805 --> 01:06:53,406
Truly, Mr. Clean

639
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:56,040
I'll be what I want to be

640
01:06:57,085 --> 01:06:58,319
Do you bring something to drink?

641
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:02,217
I think soda will do the trick
(How do you say it?

642
01:07:02,859 --> 01:07:05,577
So we want 3 soda and one coke

643
01:07:05,632 --> 01:07:06,562
Four cups?

644
01:07:10,202 --> 01:07:13,514
Hear this
You are stealing to take drugs

645
01:07:13,812 --> 01:07:15,640
I'm taking drugs to steal

646
01:07:16,518 --> 01:07:19,674
These priorities
As long as you are in the case

647
01:07:19,752 --> 01:07:21,745
You question our abilities

648
01:07:21,892 --> 01:07:22,813
On (Wall Street) true?

649
01:07:22,854 --> 01:07:24,776
Duck "tell you the truth" -
He did not tell me anything-

650
01:07:26,648 --> 01:07:28,007
Educational skills

651
01:07:28,874 --> 01:07:30,218
I am an educated man

652
01:07:30,468 --> 01:07:32,741
These look fantastic ideas on all

653
01:07:33,226 --> 01:07:35,679
"Tell me where you are from."

654
01:07:36,624 --> 01:07:38,741
Maybe you have a different life
Kids maybe

655
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:43,226
Is that what I meant when I said
We work hard and sell ourselves, but we do more

656
01:07:43,905 --> 01:07:44,851
Your past is hidden

657
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,429
It was like a red Negro of shame

658
01:07:48,195 --> 01:07:51,171
Maybe you're making trouble wherever you go

659
01:07:51,476 --> 01:07:53,202
Perhaps you are dwelling in the desert

660
01:07:53,257 --> 01:07:54,569
Maybe you are dancing

661
01:07:54,632 --> 01:08:00,296
It may work to provide three things
Money, sex, drugs and excitement

662
01:08:02,718 --> 01:08:04,742
There is an increase

663
01:08:08,453 --> 01:08:10,874
So it seems
As if on a journey

664
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:16,632
(Stay away from Wall Street
It will be the biggest coward ever

665
01:08:21,058 --> 01:08:23,276
I will speak on our behalf

666
01:08:28,685 --> 01:08:31,365
You think you know
You do not know anything

667
01:08:33,115 --> 01:08:35,264
Think the latest crazy

668
01:08:36,873 --> 01:08:37,396
Both

669
01:08:38,771 --> 01:08:43,342
Believe me when I say I do not wish
To see "Paddy" has gone crazy

670
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:46,865
You did not see how excited he was

671
01:08:47,599 --> 01:08:53,841
When a bout of insanity comes
You will see nothing but blackness

672
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:01,146
It was a good offer

673
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:04,106
"Did you hear that nonsense?"

674
01:09:04,177 --> 01:09:06,021
The man seems to have talents

675
01:09:07,521 --> 01:09:10,841
He loves a woman
You are suitable for some

676
01:09:12,358 --> 01:09:13,296
I mean this

677
01:09:17,624 --> 01:09:19,694
What brings you food?

678
01:09:21,147 --> 01:09:24,249
Bring these cats heavy meals
I will pay

679
01:09:26,176 --> 01:09:26,910
"Debra"

680
01:09:28,481 --> 01:09:33,121
Another thing about my friend is he does not like the place
But I see it nice

681
01:09:34,028 --> 01:09:35,770
"So let me ask you," Debra

682
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:42,137
what's the problem?

683
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:49,950
Maybe your friend has effective suggestions
In order to enhance the efficiency of our service

684
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:00,256
Baby "Do you know this?"

685
01:10:02,233 --> 01:10:02,693
Both

686
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,169
I'll get rid of it

687
01:10:09,778 --> 01:10:11,848
What the hell is your problem?

688
01:10:22,573 --> 01:10:24,370
Go and give the tipping to the lady

689
01:10:56,622 --> 01:10:59,013
<Font color="#FFFF00">Midnight Land Trip </ font>

690
01:11:17,575 --> 01:11:18,513
Bananas

691
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:27,705
Mozat is a code used by my providers.
To indicate that the deal had been made

692
01:11:29,955 --> 01:11:32,884
I did not hear the code this time

693
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:36,056
So tell me who died

694
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,205
They have contacted the police

695
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:41,033
I know they were men

696
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:46,502
They started by shooting first, and you were not
Who will receive your shots, villains

697
01:11:46,908 --> 01:11:48,752
Is it true that they were fired first?

698
01:11:51,127 --> 01:11:51,814
Yup

699
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:04,123
"Baby"

700
01:12:04,217 --> 01:12:05,701
Ask someone who is on the ground

701
01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:07,717
I asked who I wanted

702
01:12:09,873 --> 01:12:11,092
Go home
Your job is over

703
01:12:11,233 --> 01:12:12,389
Hey wait a minute

704
01:12:12,905 --> 01:12:16,037
We have 24 hours to become wanted
Citywide

705
01:12:16,139 --> 01:12:20,131
These pigs are idiots
All they know about us is that we are strangers from somewhere

706
01:12:20,194 --> 01:12:23,310
Your name only needs four characters to pronounce

707
01:12:23,451 --> 01:12:25,319
Doc "Do not speak my real name"

708
01:12:27,108 --> 01:12:29,069
"It's over," Leon

709
01:12:30,561 --> 01:12:31,873
Get out of the city

710
01:12:34,735 --> 01:12:36,305
"Will I Run Away" Doc

711
01:12:37,094 --> 01:12:40,015
I drive with the storm
Surf the waves

712
01:12:40,672 --> 01:12:43,750
I am on an unusual beach
Drink unusual drink

713
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:46,953
He made unusual money

714
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:50,679
It will bring us requests
After you shot

715
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,148
Paddy "knows someone"

716
01:12:52,485 --> 01:12:56,539
(I think he has someone in Wall Street

717
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:01,977
Yes I have-
Let us do this -

718
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:07,321
There are three voices here and the last time
The fourth heard she was in the car

719
01:13:07,688 --> 01:13:12,484
Bibi "Your Role for Big Decision Making"
Do we do it or not

720
01:13:12,578 --> 01:13:14,485
The matter is resolved
We will do it

721
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:15,711
Let him speak

722
01:13:17,813 --> 01:13:21,742
I see that we get some rest
Let us prepare for this dreaded thing

723
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:48,695
<Font color="#FFFF00">Bebe Your Role for Decision Making

724
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,605
"Where are you going?" Baby

725
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,519
To bring coffee

726
01:15:03,847 --> 01:15:07,362
! At 2 am
Do not look smart plan

727
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:13,237
"I was worried about Bates
Now I have to worry about you too?

728
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:21,549
Please make me known, if you will send it
Go to the office, go now, fugitive

729
01:15:22,573 --> 01:15:23,698
And do not come back

730
01:15:25,894 --> 01:15:30,987
If you have subscribed to this order
Fun driving and excitement go

731
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:33,556
what are you doing here?

732
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:38,032
Just make sure he is ready for tomorrow

733
01:15:40,275 --> 01:15:43,298
Sounds like going somewhere
Right?

734
01:15:45,157 --> 01:15:45,822
Both

735
01:15:49,036 --> 01:15:49,849
this is good

736
01:15:52,216 --> 01:15:53,739
Because we have to discuss this

737
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,028
Let us listen to this now

738
01:15:59,005 --> 01:16:03,700
<Font color="#FFFF00">Bebe Your Role for Decision Making
Do we do it or not? </ Font>

739
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,739
Now tell me where you are aiming at this?

740
01:16:07,127 --> 01:16:09,729
I was just joking and recording in vain

741
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:11,955
Why do you record stuff?

742
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:14,323
For the police?

743
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:17,072

It is supposed to lead us in the right direction
 Not the police

744
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:18,190
"Speak" Bibi

745
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:24,791
I usually record conversations to make songs
Of their words by reintegrating them

746
01:16:26,994 --> 01:16:28,932
This justification is absolutely unacceptable

747
01:16:29,237 --> 01:16:33,603
To be fair, even the police can say
Better excuses than you, do you fool us?

748
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:34,697
I said reintegrated?

749
01:16:34,752 --> 01:16:36,502
All in my house

750
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:40,365
It seems we have a place to go
Come on

751
01:16:41,506 --> 01:16:42,991
I live in a very distant place

752
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:46,022
Neither is it

753
01:16:48,764 --> 01:16:51,709
"Wake up" Baby
Your role to explain to us

754
01:16:59,584 --> 01:17:02,037
No, where is the man what did you do with him?

755
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:07,170
Disabled?
Do not worry about it

756
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:08,827
Will not go away

757
01:17:09,475 --> 01:17:11,163
"Why do not you occupy us with something?"

758
01:17:39,623 --> 01:17:42,162
"That's really cool nonsense," Doc

759
01:18:01,129 --> 01:18:04,245
"Debra"
A waitress is not the restaurant?

760
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:07,316
I said you do not know that bitch

761
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:12,261
Why did you say that you do not know her?
Did you talk to Debra about us?

762
01:18:12,285 --> 01:18:14,207
I did not say anything-
OK we will see-

763
01:18:14,761 --> 01:18:15,691
He can not speak

764
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:17,769
But you can read his lips

765
01:18:18,308 --> 01:18:22,605
Book this fool and I'll find another driver

766
01:18:22,707 --> 01:18:25,159
I can take it and throw it out of the county

767
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:27,527
No, you will not come with a new driver

768
01:18:28,027 --> 01:18:29,738
I've been on every mission since we met

769
01:18:30,644 --> 01:18:32,886
I'm not driving you to the police
I drive in the right way

770
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:35,004
And I'm not slow
I am fast

771
01:18:36,752 --> 01:18:38,025
I will be your driver tomorrow

772
01:18:39,283 --> 01:18:39,963
I will lead

773
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:47,010
Did you hear the boy's words?
Will lead

774
01:19:14,607 --> 01:19:16,732
Here we have come to the place

775
01:19:16,811 --> 01:19:17,951
Yup

776
01:19:19,584 --> 01:19:20,615
Do we have money?

777
01:19:22,076 --> 01:19:23,740
They have our whole money

778
01:19:26,162 --> 01:19:29,701
So let's go in there and recover what we have

779
01:20:05,524 --> 01:20:09,476
It's a time of excitement, my dear
How do I look?

780
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:06,485
let's go

781
01:21:08,828 --> 01:21:10,383
Let's move quickly

782
01:21:10,446 --> 01:21:11,610
Move the car

783
01:21:11,805 --> 01:21:12,852
Baby "move"

784
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:14,985
Hush on hell fuel

785
01:21:15,133 --> 01:21:16,219
Come on

786
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:18,656
Move the car before you blow your head

787
01:21:20,055 --> 01:21:22,141
Move Come on

788
01:21:37,457 --> 01:21:39,434
Come give me your hand

789
01:21:41,309 --> 01:21:44,903
What did you stupid?

Throw your weapons

792
01:26:20,651 --> 01:26:22,464
Get out of the car

793
01:26:23,628 --> 01:26:24,839
Well I'll go out

794
01:26:27,105 --> 01:26:28,784
My bag

795
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:00,166
This is yours Madam

796
01:27:08,248 --> 01:27:09,685
what the hell

797
01:27:35,056 --> 01:27:38,205
Are you fine?
I am very sorry this is my fault

798
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:40,704
We must leave here

01:27:55,622 --> 01:27:57,459
I know, but I can not leave you here

802
01:28:06,273 --> 01:28:07,882
Restaurant (Bo) would you prefer

803
01:28:07,976 --> 01:28:09,140
Is Debra there?

804
01:28:09,218 --> 01:28:13,226
Debbie is "doing her job now"
Are you waiting?

805
01:28:14,109 --> 01:28:15,429
Just tell her that "Bibi" is coming

806
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,335

01:28:42,212 --> 01:28:42,923
Hello

809
01:28:44,306 --> 01:28:45,509
"My name is Joseph"

810
01:28:46,548 --> 01:28:48,126
On the Hawaiian station

811
01:28:48,775 --> 01:28:54,610
Also sometimes I love listening to Opera

812
01:28:56,158 --> 01:28:59,478
I love frozen beans
Pastries and white bread

813
01:29:00,259 --> 01:29:02,486
And nut butter

814
01:29:05,658 --> 01:29:07,032
Spread on the sides

01:29:09,556 --> 01:29:11,978
Please take care of me

Your buddy "Paddy" is here

She was a good girl

What about her?

830
01:31:15,733 --> 01:31:21,131
"What about Debra," "Baby
Is she a good girl and do you love her?

831
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:23,162
I loved her

832
01:31:24,819 --> 01:31:26,194
This is so bad

833
01:31:43,668 --> 01:31:45,380
Can I take the bathroom keys?

its enough

"I'm sorry," Bibi said

837
01:32:57,419 --> 01:32:59,942
You've got enough music

838
01:33:01,825 --> 01:33:03,583
Are you satisfied, sir?

839
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:06,599
We are ok
"It's not like you," Baby

840
01:33:13,908 --> 01:33:15,908
Let's go

01:33:16,592 --> 01:33:20,716
"You can not continue to run away" Bibi
You have no choice

842
01:33:20,787 --> 01:33:21,568
Let's get out of here

843
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:23,099
I will find you

"What's going on?"

Ali Al-Rahil-
No I'm coming with you -

He shot a man-

This

849
01:33:41,161 --> 01:33:43,365
The police here
On the ground

850
01:33:43,592 --> 01:33:46,044
Are you fine?
Can you show me the location of your injury?

"We have to leave here"
Ali did something before it -

858
01:34:17,841 --> 01:34:20,630
We would both be music on the road

859
01:34:21,075 --> 01:34:23,669
But we do not have a car or music

860
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,946
Yes, we have

861
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:33,360
Get out of the car

862
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:37,539
(See Bonnie and Clyde-
(They (Bonnie and Bonnie-

863
01:34:37,618 --> 01:34:39,821
Get out of the car -
you scared me-

864
01:34:40,578 --> 01:34:43,969
Have you used a weapon by my dear?
I've just done-

865
01:34:44,282 --> 01:34:45,953
Five minutes ago

866
01:34:57,293 --> 01:34:59,465
Can I get my phone

867
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:00,199
Both

868
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:36,372
You are not just a private driver
Clear this

869
01:35:46,912 --> 01:35:49,232
It's over, boy
We closed the shop

870
01:35:51,318 --> 01:35:54,435
I want tapes -
I will not give you the tapes -

871
01:35:55,912 --> 01:36:00,006
I have money and I want to kill him with tapes -
"I can not help you" Baby-

872
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:03,591
"Shot" Paddy

873
01:36:04,013 --> 01:36:09,388
Congratulations, every policeman here will follow you
Will you call me too?

874
01:36:10,748 --> 01:36:12,372
Both you and I are a team

875
01:36:12,412 --> 01:36:15,927
Do not say more of these lies
It angers me

876
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:21,779
"One of the buffers" Sam
I thought she was familiar with the scum

877
01:36:25,802 --> 01:36:27,568
I no longer kill the magician anymore

878
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:31,201
But I'm here to ask for help

879
01:36:33,193 --> 01:36:37,943
There is nothing I can help you with, boy
Why should I help you after all that you have done to me?

880
01:36:44,276 --> 01:36:45,807
There is nothing wrong
let's go

881
01:36:47,526 --> 01:36:51,135
Gosh
Look at your situation

882
01:36:52,565 --> 01:36:54,628
Well go and take your damned condition

883
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:08,540
It will take more than one tape player to get you out of
This is because the news is all bad

884
01:37:09,126 --> 01:37:12,634
There is some good news
They love driving

885
01:37:12,969 --> 01:37:16,173
Because you can not raise your foot on fuel
For the next 25 years

886
01:37:17,165 --> 01:37:21,048
This will be enough to cross the border
From there you will take care of yourself

887
01:37:21,266 --> 01:37:25,352
Do not trust anyone but you
Never look back

888
01:37:27,829 --> 01:37:29,329
I was always unknown

889
01:37:35,329 --> 01:37:36,259
Run away

890
01:37:46,965 --> 01:37:47,864
...I thought

891
01:37:55,332 --> 01:37:58,520
I think I told you to run away

892
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:05,901
Go, I'll take care of the police order

893
01:38:06,604 --> 01:38:08,705
This is not the police

894
01:38:09,371 --> 01:38:13,418
Listen to the song of death

895
01:38:56,636 --> 01:38:58,340
Bring the bag

896
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:52,185
We'll get out of here
I have a plan

897
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:06,305
"Get out, baby."

898
01:40:10,275 --> 01:40:11,649
(Get out, O Romeo

899
01:40:18,557 --> 01:40:19,401
Both

900
01:40:35,579 --> 01:40:39,610
"You are among the dead" Baby
Oh, the dreaded child

901
01:40:41,016 --> 01:40:42,665
Are you okay, yelled?

902
01:40:44,493 --> 01:40:45,727
Gosh

903
01:41:11,592 --> 01:41:12,678
Screw you

904
01:41:52,766 --> 01:41:54,188
Well done, boy

905
01:41:55,422 --> 01:41:57,774
But you took from me something I love

906
01:41:59,532 --> 01:42:01,524
He knows that he is an example

907
01:42:08,793 --> 01:42:11,285
I want you to be really there
To scream

908
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:17,074
Just watch

909
01:43:14,872 --> 01:43:15,857
what are you doing?

910
01:43:16,473 --> 01:43:19,513
I drive on the road and listen to music

911
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:24,263
Is this your mother's voice?

912
01:43:25,732 --> 01:43:26,263
Yup

913
01:43:28,326 --> 01:43:31,372
She has a beautiful voice

914
01:43:32,771 --> 01:43:33,654
I know

915
01:44:47,379 --> 01:44:48,763
You do not belong to this world

916
01:45:41,479 --> 01:45:45,901
How would you describe your relationship with the accused?

917
01:45:46,393 --> 01:45:50,432
we were friends
We wanted to be more than that

918
01:45:51,018 --> 01:45:55,065
He has trouble himself in trouble
I was trying to get him out of it

919
01:45:55,377 --> 01:46:00,416
The defendant is a good character
It does not deserve what happened to him

920
01:46:00,846 --> 01:46:08,478
The strangest thing is that he stopped and gave me my bag

921
01:46:09,182 --> 01:46:12,401
Then he said to me sorry

922
01:46:12,893 --> 01:46:18,033
He looked at me like he was telling me not to go
To income

923
01:46:18,322 --> 01:46:21,736
He was interested in saving me

924
01:46:21,908 --> 01:46:24,658
He made a mistake when he was younger

925
01:46:24,744 --> 01:46:30,299
They used him from his time, whenever he tried to get out
They were putting pressure on him and ordering him

926
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:34,768
It was never his fault
 He has a good heart

927
01:46:35,018 --> 01:46:37,830
For as long as it will be

928
01:46:38,119 --> 01:46:42,369
Refer to the provisions of item 1219
Case No. 21

929
01:46:42,916 --> 01:46:46,737
The accused was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment

930
01:46:47,526 --> 01:46:51,190
With the possibility of release
After five years service

931
01:47:06,344 --> 01:47:07,672
