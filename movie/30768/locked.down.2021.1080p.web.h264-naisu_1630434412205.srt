00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,917
我只有??司机
And I only have two fucking drivers.

393
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,502
所以你有什??法？
So what's your solution?

394
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,255
欺? 原? 救? 阿堵物
Deception. Forgiveness. Redemption. Bunce.

395
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,548
阿堵物是怎?？
What the fuck is bunce?

396
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,926
以前人常?的?
Old East End word for cash, Paxton,

397
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,594
?是用漫天?言 ?取的不?之?
in return for grand deception.

398
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,430
是我的?宏大量 与你的救?之路促成的
Facilitated by my forgiveness and your redemption.

399
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,973
好 ?重?‥?侃
All right, get there. Get there, Malcolm.

400
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,559
我弄了?身份安全值Ａ２的?件
I've printed off an ID with a security level A2.

401
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,436
?有前科 上面有你的照片跟名字
Clean. With your photo on it and a name.

402
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,562
不是你的名字
It is not your name.

403
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,023
我?法正式??你的?薪假 把工作派?你
I can't officially take you off furlough and give you this work,

404
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,942
因?你以前老是??搞事
because you used to be a bike slag,

405
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,028
我只能?你假?成?人 再用?金付薪水?你
so I will have to pretend you are someone else and pay you in cash.

406
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,406
你在公司?了七年的司机
You've worked for this company as a driver for seven years.

407
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,990
我?未听?任何客?抱怨?你
And I have never had a single complaint.

408
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,909
?然你都送低?价的物件
You've only ever driven low value packages,

409
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,954
但我相信你是?值得信任的人
but I believe you are a man who can be trusted.

410
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,374
我是
That I am.

411
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,044
我确?值得人信任
Yeah, I can be trusted.

412
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,629
那件事都多久以前了
I mean, what happened was a long time ago.

413
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,089
我不想知道
Yeah, I don't wanna to know.

414
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,757
那只是??党?手?的?突
No, it was biker versus biker.

415
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,136
上帝??恕你 公司也??恕你
The Lord forgives. B2B Pro Freight Services forgives.

416
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,554
要不是因?那晚的事被起?
If it wasn't for the fucking convictions from that night,

417
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,431
我的人生?完全不一?
my whole life would've been radically different.

418
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,765
日薪?百英??金
Two hundred a day in cash.

419
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,561
我不在乎?金 我要跟你??件 ?侃
I don't care about the cash. I wanna make a deal with you, Malcolm.

420
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,271
我只有一??件
Look, I will do this on the condition

421
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,482
搞定?件事后 你?考?升我做行政文?
that when this is all over, you will consider me for a clerical position.

422
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,902
就因?一晚的?? 我的人生就?了
My entire life has been fucked up because of things I did on one night.

423
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:32,197
我老婆‥已?放?我了
My wife...My wife has grown out of me,

424
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,825
因?我?是那? 只??卡?的??
because I am still Mr. Fuck-All behind the wheel of a van.

425
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,660
我不是笨蛋
I am not stupid.

426
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:37,786
我???
I read poetry.

427
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,955
－我能成材 －我有通??要接 帕斯?
-I could be someone. -I've got another call, Paxton.

428
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,125
?在很忙 西?要忙?了 你到底接不接？
It is a very busy time, the West End is going mad.Will you do it?

429
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,254
好 我要是接了?活儿 你要?到做到
All right, if I do this for you, Malcolm,I want you to practice what you preach.

430
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:51,216
?于原? 迷途羔羊 ?有救?那些的

all of it, and give me a chance to come off the road.

432
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,471
凡事都有可能 帕斯? 上帝保佑你
Everything is possible, Paxton.God bless you.

433
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,723
周四去塞?福裡百? 周五去夏菲尼高百?
Selfridges, Thursday. Harvey Nichols, Friday.

434
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,224

-Harrods on Saturday. - Right, yeah.

I will e-mail your full itinerary and your new identity.

436

Okay, okay. And after... After Harrods on Saturday...

437
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,523
上帝保佑你 帕斯?
God bless you, Paxton.

438
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,652
{\an8}吸?可?致肺癌

439
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,324
可?
Shit.

440
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,476
{\an8}?伊

441
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,985
琳? 封城?好?？
Hey, Linda, how's lockdown?

442
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,154
??的
It's pretty bad.

443
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,281
芝加哥怎??了？
How's Chicago?

444
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,825
我在弗蒙特
I'm in Vermont.

445
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,827
全家搬到弗蒙特
Yeah, moved the family out to Vermont.

446
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,580
大家在?裡都超?心的
We're all here crazy happy.

447
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:07,501
小孩很吵 所以我?了新耳机
Kids make a lot of noise, so I got these new AirPods Pro.

448
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,587
有降噪功能 真的很棒 我什?都听不到
Noise canceling. They work, like, you literally can't hear anything.

449
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,257
我?有那种耳机
No, I don't have those.

450
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,634
我?你的表情就知道
I can see in your face

451
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,219
你已?跟壹凡?的人???了
that you, uh, spoke to the guys at Events

452
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,595
也跟他?更新了??
and delivered the update.

453
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,016
更新 ? 我跟他?更新??
Update. Yeah. Yeah, I updated them.

454
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,811
你有?有?我的?息?他?听？
Did you read them my message?

455
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,355
”公司是大家庭”那封?？
The stuff about the Miracore family?

456
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,608
?有‥我?得?不?意‥
No, no, no, I didn't think that would translate. Um...

457
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,319
琳? 我是?自?心??封?息
Linda, I wrote that message from the heart.

458
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,904
我是真心的
I really meant what I said.

459
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,782
我真不敢相信你?念出?
I can't believe you didn't read it out to them.

460
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,785
我?得很不妥 ?什?”米拉克是?大家庭”
I didn't think it was appropriate to say that "Miracore is a family

461
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,038
”家庭?究?走到?一天”
and there comes a time in every family's life

462
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,832
”有些成?得?出?巢 才能?系美好家庭”
when it's best if some family members fly the nest."

463
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,418
哪裡不妥？
Why is that not appropriate?

464
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,753
因?他?不是?出?巢吧
Because they're not flying the nest, are they?

465
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:55,049
他?是被扔出?巢 砸到?下的?草中
They're being thrown out of the nest into the long grass under the tree.

466
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,301
?有?啊 哪裡?的?？
There's no tree. What tree?

467
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:01,263
是你??巢的 ?伊 有?巢的比喻就要有一棵?
It's your nest, Guy. You came up with the analogy of the nest.So there has to be a tree.

468
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,432
你是不是?子?坏了 琳?？
Do you have a temperature, Linda?

469
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,895
封城之前 本?安排了??大型活?
Um, there are two big events which were already set up when lockdown began.

470
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,063
一?在西田百?
One was at Westfield,

471
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,690
另一?是伊芙?沃 在哈洛德百?借???的活?
the other one was the Eve Schwarz store takeover at Harrods.

472
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,442
但西田跟哈洛德都??了
But both Westfield and Harrods have closed their door.

473
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,777
我好?哈洛德
I love Harrods.

474
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,071
我也是 我在哈洛德工作?五年
Yeah, I love Harrods, too.

475
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,614
那是我人生中最快?的?光
I worked there for five years, they were the happiest of my life.

476
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,991
?之伊芙?沃 ?次的系列?模盛大
Anyway, the launch of Eve Schwarz collection was going to be huge,

477
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,369
所以基于?地大小与保安 我?了哈洛德百?
so I chose Harrods because of its size and level of security.

478
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,455
你?的？ 我以?梅莉莎才是活?策略?
You chose? I thought Melissa was head of events strategy.

479
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,918
有?我??疑她的‥不重要
Yeah. Sometimes I questioned her... It doesn't matter.

480
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,004
你?著?部?太久了
You've been carrying that department a long time.

481
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:37,341
是啊 ?竟是大家庭嘛 家人不就是要???？
Yeah, well, they were family, weren't they?And that's what you do with family.

482
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,344
你?一直?助他? 直到收到芝加哥?部的裁?指示
You carry them until you get a direction from Chicago to drop them,

483
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,637
然后按令行事?除他?
and then you dutifully drop them.

484
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,349
?之我?在哈洛德放了 市价五百万的珠? 服?与首?
Anyway, at Harrods, we have five million dollars worth of jewelry,

485
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,851
都是?了品牌走秀 与借??展安置的
clothing and accessories already installed for the catwalk

486
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,353
都?于米拉克的保管?任范?
and store takeover under Miracore liability.

487
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,979
其中包括哈裡斯鑽石
And that includes the Harris Diamond

488
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,981
本?是要?走秀的重??
which was to be the centerpiece of the show.

489
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,235
哈裡斯鑽石 ?于我?的保??任？
The Harris Diamond is under our insurance liability?

490
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,529
是‥
It's, um...

491
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,949
鑽石目前安置在哈洛德的 安全金?中 ??
It's safe in the Harrods' secure vault, but, yes.

492
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,368
{\an8}弗蒙特去死

493
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,788
我已?向品牌提?
I suggested to the people at Eve Schwarz

494
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:12,084
?快?物件移至 哈洛德的保安??中直到‥
that we put everything into Harrods' secure storage as quickly as possible until this, um...

495
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,795
直到封城落幕
Uh, until this situation is ended.

496
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,007
但保?又有??? 就是‥
But we have a problem with insurance. You see...

497
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:26,015
伊芙?沃的保?上指出 品牌商品不得?行存放
So, Eve Schwarz's insurance policy means that they are not allowed to store their merchandise

498
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,892
除非在品牌自己的?管之下
except under their own corporate supervision.

499
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,937
因此要透?安全的移?方式 ?商品送出百?
So the merchandise will have to be taken out of the store in secure transportation.

500
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,313
{\an8}弗蒙特好?

501
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,649
?之 百?都在安排物件配送
Anyway, the stores are allocating for collection.

502
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,569
西田是周五 哈洛德是周六
We have Westfield on Friday, Harrods on Saturday.

503
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,989
接著我?要?? 你的?位与薪?
And then we discuss your role and your salary.

504
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,783
接下??有?多新的??
There'll be a lot of new responsibilities.

505
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,493
公司有重大改?
Things are changing.

506
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:50,330
真是好消息 ??
That's excellent news. Thank you.

507
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,458
?我跟?敦打?招呼
Say hello to London.

508
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,585
－好好享受弗蒙特 －?然
- Enjoy Vermont. - You bet.

509
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,046
{\an8}弗蒙特去死 弗蒙特好?

510
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,049
可? 搞什? ?死 昆恩
What? Oh, fuck! Quinn!

511
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,605
我要去?尸路超市?牛奶 我??需要什??？
I'm going to the land of the Walking Dead to buy some milk.Do we need anything else?

512
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,860
我?”我?” 不是要暗示我?是同心同体
I say the word "we" without any attempt to suggest a unified entity,

513
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,864
但我?分?趟各?各的?西 ?在很?意?
but there's no point in us both going separately to get our own provisions.

514
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,575
外面越?越危?了
It's getting rough out there.

515
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,953
而且我越??得 像我?种真的坐?牢的人
And increasingly, I think people like me who have spent time in real prison

516
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,081
在?种新生活中如?得水
are thriving in this new reality.

517
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,416
真的是‥帕斯? 算了 ??吧
Oh, you know what, Paxton, fuck it. Come in.

518
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,880
好的 帕斯? 是??的 除了牛奶
All right, Paxton, here it is. In addition to milk,

519
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,549
我?需要香?
I need cigarettes.

520
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,471
－什?？ －我本?想掩?自己??复?
- What? - I was trying to hide that I'm smoking again,

521
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,933
但反正我?已?分?了 ?件事也不重要了
but since we're no longer together, it doesn't really matter, does it?

522
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,768
你又抽?了？
You are smoking?

523
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,354
?? 我打算抽到封城?束
Yes. I plan to carry on just until this thing is over.

524
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,148
其??感?棒透了
It's magnificent, actually.

525
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,859
你什??候又?始抽?的？
And when did you start smoking again?

526
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,028
圣??前
Just before Christmas.

527
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,697
?何？
Why?

528
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,158
我去巴黎??始的
I started smoking again when I went to Paris.

529
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,994
－你去巴黎？ －? 我去了巴黎?跟你?
- You went to Paris? - Yes, I went to Paris.I didn't tell you I went to Paris.

530
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,288
?克埃辛邀我去巴黎 我就去了
Michael Essien invited me to Paris and I went.

531
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:19,378
我的?商?? ??叫自白?雪球
Okay, my therapist identifies these moments as confession avalanche.

532
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,673
?克埃辛是哪位？
Who the fuck is Michael Essien?

533
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,467
他是米拉克媒体公司的??人 德?富人排名第七
He is the founder of Miracore,seventh wealthiest man in Germany.

534
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,345
－你跟他去巴黎？ －不算
- And you went to Paris with him? - Not quite.

535
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:33,267
他邀?六??家的?行? 去巴黎?祝他的六十大?
He invited the CEOs from six countries to come to Paris for his 60th birthday celebration.

536
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,060
你介意我???？ 我已?熄了?次‥
Do you mind if I light this thing? I've put it out twi...

537
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:38,439
不?啊 ?是我的?人?? 我何必?你
And, you know what? Actually, it's my choice. Why am I even asking?

538
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:48,741
我到?店的宴??? ??了六?跟我一?的?行?
When I got to the hotel, there was this banqueting suite and I met six other CEOs just like me,

539
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,117
但??我?上任
only I had just become a CEO,

540
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,328
我??意?到自己的身份 直到我看到其他?行?
so I didn't realize exactly who I was until I saw the other CEOs,

541
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:57,624
我?才确?了?在的身份
and then I was like, "Oh, so that's who I am now."

542
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,710
我?坐在桌旁喝香?
And we sat around this table, drinking champagne,

543
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,004
??中充斥著小人物的附和
and the conversation was lots of little voices saying "yes,"

544
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,590
与一?大人物的?同 那是?克埃辛的?音
and one big voice saying "good," Michael Essien's voice.

545
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,760
大人物接著?了”新?市?” 然后我‥
And then the big voice said, "Emerging markets" and I...

546
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,472
你懂那种?人?得很抽象 但你?有?具体?面的感??？
You know how sometimes when people say something abstract, I actually see it?

547
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,640
我?以前的确抽了很多大麻
Well, we did smoke a lot of weed in the bad old days.

548
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:19,229
?他?”新?市?”? 我眼前浮?了??‥?西
When he said "Emerging markets," I saw this...

549
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:24,360
??形体?桌底冒出? 在我?的??游走
thing, this shape appearing from under the table and swimming around our legs.

550
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,029
我那晚好像真的??了
I think I actually did have a temperature that night. But, anyway,

551
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:31,075
然后他?了”香?与?品”
then he said "Cigarettes and pharmaceuticals,"

552
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,203
我喝了?香?? 又有人?”??人”
and I drank some champagne and someone said "facilitators,"

553
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,414
那些人???服政府 商品的安全?虞
that is people who persuade governments that products are safe and okay.

554
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:41,877
大人物接著???人 是整???的?接??
And the big voice said that facilitators were now a huge link in the chain

555
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,339
我就看?了爬?海藻的大??
and I saw this big chain dripping seaweed

556
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,217
接著大人物?杯向?腐致敬
and then the big voice raised a toast to corruption,

557
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,344
大家都嘲?地笑了 包括我
and everybody laughed ironically, including me.

558
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,471
帕斯? 看著我
Paxton, look at me!

559
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:59,561
然后??西 ?形体 在我??游走
And this thing, this shape, it was swimming around my fucking legs

560
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:03,941
大人物接著?新?市? 是米拉克的一大收益
and then the big voice said, emerging market were now some big percentage of Miracore's profits,

561
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,276
因此?洲分公司要?行 合理化的改革
and so there would have to be rationalization in Europe.

562
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,071
我有?想吐所以喝了?水 但又?得快?倒
And I drank some water, because I felt a little sick,

563
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,115
可是服?生?要不要白?地 我就?好
but also like I might pass out, but then the waiter said "brandy," so I said yes.

564
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,658
所以呢‥
And, so,

565
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:18,038
就在圣??前的巴黎餐桌上 敲定了合理化的改革
the rationalization was planned right there at that table in Paris before Christmas.

566
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,833
而我早上?除的那些好人
And the nice people that I fired earlier today,

567
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,293
他?才不是像我?那? 因?疫情才被?除
they weren't fired because of a virus, like I told them,

568
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,461
那都是假的
that was a lie.

569
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:28,048
他?都是因??鬼?西 才被?除的
They were fired because of this...this thing, this shape,

570
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,134
??西?著我回到房?
that swam with me all the way back to my room,

571
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,595
?了??它 我?拿了?丑陋的玻璃天?
and to get rid of it, I used the disgusting glass swan

572
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,848
朝著全身?砸下去
to smash a full length mirror,

573
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,683
但我可?打算整晚踩著碎玻璃
and rather then walk across broken glass all night,

574
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,852
所以我?定搭最后一班 往?敦的火?回家
I decided to take the last train home to London,

575
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:43,355
我抵?巴黎北站? 一名游民女子向前跟我要?抽
and when I got to the Gare du Nord station,a homeless woman cameand asked me for a cigarette.

576
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,233
我?我不抽? 但?是?她?了一包
I told her that I didn't smoke, but I decided to buy her a pack anyway,

577
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,528
想?也?小小的善? ???落至斯的我?得好一?
because I thought that maybe kindness might make me feel better about what

578
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:53,365
看她??? 我也?定?一根
I had become. And when she lit her cigarette,I decided to have a cigarette, too.

579
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,576
?我把?吸?去?
And when I drew in the smoke,

580
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,746
那?西就不?了
the thing stopped swimming.

581
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,710
然后我坐在?椅上等火?
So I sat down on the bench and I waited for my train.

582
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,256
那就是我??复?的原因
And that is why I started to smoke again.

583
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:16,472
但回到你??的??
But... to complete the answer to your original question,

584
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,932
除了牛奶与香?
in addition to milk and cigarettes,

585
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,642
我??需要面包
we need bread

586
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,062
?有葡萄酒
and fucking wine.

587
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,691
天啊
God!

588
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,902
怎?？
God what?

589
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,487
你听起?真的??了
Well, it sounds like you did have a temperature.

590
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,238
听?圣??前就有疫情了
You know, they say this thing was around before Christmas.

591
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,574
帕斯? 才不是 跟病毒完全??
Paxton, no! It's not about the virus.

592
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:40,120
而是我?于意?到自己的本? 与我的工作?何
It's about me realizing who I am and what I do for a living.

593
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:45,959
?然重新??人生 似乎是新冠疫情的副作用
Although a complete re-examination of one's life does seem to be a COVID side effect.

594
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:49,129
－你砸??子？ －?‥因?我看到自己的倒影
- You smashed a mirror? - Yeah.Yeah, because I was in it.

595
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,340
我?砸了香?酒瓶跟酒杯
I also smashed a champagne bottle,

596
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,050
本??要再砸? 玻璃?匹与?士
some champagne glasses, and I was about to smash a glass horse and jockey,

597
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,843
但我?定要留著
but then I decided to keep it,

598
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,929
?果?被我忘在火?上
but then I left it on the fucking train.

599
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:00,391
我就是像你以前?的那? ”暴怒?京人”
Basically, I went, what you used to call, "Full Viking."

600
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:05,396
其?我看到碎裂的?子中 自己?怒的倒影?想到了你
In fact, when I broke the mirror and I saw my furious face in the cracked glass,

601
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,106
真?心 感恩
That's very sweet. Thank you.

602
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,487
你?何不跟我?？
Why didn't you tell me?

603
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19,785
那?是初冬 我?的感情寒冬
It was the onset of winter. Our winter.

604
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,328
反正我也?跟任何人?
And anyway, I didn't tell anybody,

605
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:24,373
因?只要不?出去 ?件事就能???生?
because if you don't tell anybody, then it didn't happen.

606
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,293
－收到?子的???了?？ －帕斯?‥
- Did you get a bill for the mirror? - Paxton...

607
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:32,047
帕斯? 管那面?子去死 跟?子完全??‥
Paxton, fuck the mirror. It's not about the mirror, it's about...

608
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,265
以前要是?生?种事
Previously, at this point,

609
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,559
－我?抱抱你 －不用 ?必要
- I would've hugged you. - No, really, there's no need.

610
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,811
而且你也要去采?了
And anyway, besides, you're going shopping.

611
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:50,691
牛奶 面包 葡萄酒 香?
So, uh, milk, bread, wine, cigarettes.

612
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,359
可能?要??蛋
And probably eggs.

613
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,195
那我?要?小?面粉 我要做面包
I'm gonna put white flour on the list.I'm gonna make bread.

614
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,698
－拜托不要 －我?‥
- Please don't. - You know...

615
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,869
你??那段不是什?自白
what you just said wasn't a confession.

616
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,287
我又??是自白
I didn't say it was a confession.

617
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,457
－因?你?做?事 －不是 那段只是在解?
-'Cause you didn't do anything wrong. -No, it was an explanation.

618
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,917
你做的每件事都是?的
You did everything right.

619
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,129
你想听听什?叫自白?？
You wanna hear a confession?

620
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,090
我早上睡??是因?昨晚‥
This morning I overslept, because last night

621
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,010
我嗑了?片
I took opium.

622
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,888
真的
Yes!

623
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,641
是真的 比你抽??重多了
Yes.Much worse than your cigarettes.

624
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:29,188
我在花?裡的?色花苞上 舔了??片吃
I licked opium off little green bulbs from the garden.

625
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,857
真的 花?裡海洛因比比皆是
Yes, I did.Our garden is full of heroin.

626
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,650
晒衣?再?去一? 就是?粟花之?
You go beyond the washing line, it's like the Helmand Province.

627
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:38,405
－你都戒十年了 帕斯? －抽?也?好到哪裡去
-After ten years, Paxton? -Smoking isn't so great either.

628
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,783
我最近有?挫折
You know, I've had some setbacks lately.

629
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:41,909
我告?你 帕斯?
Yeah, well, you know what, Paxton?

630
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,787
?巴黎回?后 我每早喝的蔬菜果昔
You know that green smoothie that I have in the mornings since Paris,

631
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,955
裡面可?了?小杯伏特加 只有?杯喔
there's two shots of vodka in it.

632
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,791
－你?人 －并?有
- Just two but... - You are lying.

633
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,001
不是每天都有 但有?候?加
No, I'm not.Not every morning, but some mornings I do it. I have done it.

634
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:54,880
你以?我是因?不?升官 才???心又正常
You think I'm so happy and normal is 'cause I keep getting promoted.

635
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,048
人?真的?袋不清楚
People get confused.

636
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,634
?有 我?不??你快?又正常
No, I've never accused you of being happy and normal, Linda.

637
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,094
因?我就不是
'Cause I'm not!

638
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:04,598
懂? 我看得?抽象概念 真??去????家
All right? I see concepts.I should've been an artist.

639
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:08,936
以??事假幸福的女性角度?看 你感到不快?
You are unhappy in an outwardly "happy,let's pretend it's all fine" female way,

640
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:12,022
而我的不快?是以挫?‥

－不然呢？ －我是?了?更好的生活
-Otherwise? -I'm doing it for the opportunity to have a better life.

00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,493
?干你什?事？

琳?好像很抽离
And Linda seemed kind of detached from the whole thing.

775
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,261
很抽离？
Detached?

776
00:46:44,345 --> 00:46:46,555
－你好 琳? －我?正好聊到你

We were all just saying that we love that you're always so professional.

等等 很抽离是什?意思？
Detached from what whole thing?

779
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:56,774
我的意思是 你?理壹凡?一事?很理性
I was saying you handled the situation with Events without too much feeling getting in the way.

it says wine on the label but it tastes like something used to clean something off of a surface.

Why don't you go somewhere warm and count your grievances?

我跟他?最好不要
I advised him against it.

798
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:59,461
公?公不?你?种??罪犯 ?理高价?物是有道理的
B2B normally keep lowlifes like you away from high-value cargo for a reason...

803
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:16,020

I'm a different person now. Give me the fucking keys.

804
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:17,688
?侃可能?跟你?
Perhaps Malcolm didn't tell you.

805
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:22,818
今晚塞?福裡的? 估价是五万英?
The estimated value of tonight's cargo out of Selfridges is £50,000.

808

但周六晚上你要去哈洛德
But on Saturday night,when you go to Harrods,

809
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:33,871

you'll be driving away from the world's most glamorous department store

810
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:38,834
?著超?三百万英?的 珠?跟?品离?
with jewelry and accessories in your van worth over three million pounds.

811
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,837
想想看 你?戴著口罩和手套
Now think on this.You'll be wearing a mask and gloves,

812
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,881
用假身份
you'll be using a false identity.

813
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,424
街上空?一人
Outside, the streets will be empty.

What more could a lowlife need to pull off the perfect robbery.

816

你敢再叫我罪犯一次‥
You refer to me as "lowlife" one more time...

817
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:57,227
你就怎? 犯罪?？

罪犯
Lowlife.

820
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:05,027
?侃?接下?几晚 你若干得不?
You know, Malcolm told me that if you do okay in the next few nights,

他就要把你?去客服

而我?困在派遣部七年半
Whereas I've been stuck in dispatches for seven and a half years.

826
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,958
?老?得全世界跟你有仇 ?丁
You have to stop thinking the whole world's against you, Martin.

827
00:49:23,837 --> 00:49:25,130
下手吧 帕斯?
Do it, Paxton.

828
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:29,301
??天意 接?你的命?
Take the opportunity that fate has given you.

829
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:35,766
{\an8}公?公????公司

Harrods wants everything out of the store and it's our responsibility...

833

你停格了 琳?
Oh, you've frozen, Linda.

834
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:49,947
听得到?？
Can you hear me?

835
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:52,991

卡在你?火的表情
You've got this look of exasperation.

837
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:00,958
因?得有人去哈洛德打包商品
Uh, someone's gonna have to go into Harrods and pack the valuables up

838
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:04,003
清?并剔除多余的品?

而且要找值得信?的人
And it's gonna have to be someone that we trust.

Someone who is familiar with the stock,and knows how the Harrods system works.

841
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:11,593

So that means, inevitably, it's going to be me, isn't it?

842
00:50:11,677 --> 00:50:14,555
好吧 但打?你?有另一?目的
Okay, but there's this, another second reason for this call.

843
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:17,641
?克埃辛?定?你升?
Michael Essien has decided. He wants to give you a promotion.

844
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:19,643
他想?你回老家
He wants to bring you home.

845
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:23,272
回??管理?岸
Back to New York to run the East Coast.

846
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,650
天啊
Wow, God. Um...

847
00:50:27,151 --> 00:50:28,694
很??吧？
Exciting.

848
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:31,864
的确是跟便宜葡萄酒 很不搭?的惊喜
A unexpected turn of events and cheap wine don't pair well together.

849
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:35,284
我得好好考?一下?件事
Um, I'm gonna have to, uh, really think about this.

850
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:37,494
好吧 晚安
Uh, right, good night.

851
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:39,997
我是指??‥
Yeah, thank you.

852
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,415
看?琳?很激?‥
Linda, it's exciting...

853
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:48,422
卡在?火的表情
A frozen look of exasperation.

854
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:54,261
那就是他的二儿子 卡?菲利普艾曼?巴哈
...and that is his second son, Carl Philipp Emauel Bach

855
00:50:54,345 --> 00:50:56,221
?聆听他的第四?交?曲
and here's his Symphony No. 4.

856
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:59,702
昨晚通?后 我?有??心 帕斯?的心理??
It's just that after our call last night,we became worried about Paxton's state of mind.

857
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:01,745
他可能??爆或是爆?
We worry that he might implode or explode.

858
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:04,331
我???的帕斯?大概是?爆
Knowing Paxton, he'll probably implode rather than explode.

859
00:52:04,415 --> 00:52:06,959
－有什?差?？ －?爆的人?封?自己
-What's the difference? -When you implode, you withdraw within yourself,

860
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:09,545
爆??是向外宣洩
when you explode, you impose yourself on the outer world.

861
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:12,673
拿大??? 他生气???爆
David, for example, when he gets angry, he implodes.

862
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:15,718
－但我生气??爆? －必要?我也?爆?
-When I get angry, I explode. - I can also explode if I have to.

863
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:18,137
－很少吧 －你肯定?看我??商???
- Rarely. -You've obviously never seen me in business meetings.

864
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,805
封城后我其?看?
Well, actually I have. Since lockdown.

865
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:21,306
你只是隔牆听 ?看
You've heard me through the wall, you haven't seen me.

866
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,893
好吧 我?”听”?你爆? 我其?很意外‥
Okay, then, I haven't heard you explode.I've actually been very surprised

867
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:27,604
－你在??上那?听? －听?？
-about how submissive you are in meetings. - Submissive?

868
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:29,773
老板要有老板的?子 大?
You're the boss, David, you should act like the boss.

869
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:32,818
好吧 我只是想?帕斯??事
Anyway, just to reassure you, Paxton's okay.

870
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:35,404
而且他可能要升?了
In fact, Paxton maybe getting a promotion.

871
00:52:36,113 --> 00:52:38,157
琳? 你一?人喝酒?？
Linda, are you drinking alone?

872
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,993
?有 ?房有三?消防?在等我
No, I've got three firemen waiting for me in the kitchen.

873
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:43,579
封城后大??始狂喝
Since lockdown, David has been drinking so much more.

874
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:47,708
干得好 大? 感?很好吧？
Yes, David, isn't it wonderful?

875
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:50,127
我??在??算酒瓶量
We now keep a record. We count the bottles.

876
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,004
－我其?不在乎 －但你的身体在乎
- I don't care. - Your body cares.

877
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:54,757
你的肝髒一瓶一瓶?著呢
Your body counts the bottles and keeps an inventory in you liver.

878
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,176
大? 我的酒友啊
David, my fellow drinker,

879
00:52:57,259 --> 00:52:59,303
跟你??秘密
I'd like to tell you a secret.

880
00:52:59,386 --> 00:53:01,597
－什?秘密？ －听著 琳?
- What secret? - You know, Linda,

881
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,018
我喝了几杯酒 隔天醒?后的反?通常是
my life where I've had a few glasses of wine and in the next morning,

882
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:08,437
”天啊 我不??那种?”
I woke up like, "Golly. Wow. I wish I hadn't said that."

883
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,231
我也常常那?
Oh, I've done that so many times, too.

884
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:14,735
我的座右?是 ?用秘密配葡萄酒
You know, my mantra is, secrets and wine don't go great together.

885
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:16,987
－?她?完秘密 －他?喜???秘密
- Let her tell me the secret. -I think he's gonna like this secret.

886
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:19,365
－你?喜???秘密 大? －你不懂他喜?什?
-I think you're gonna like this secret, David, very much. -Something he's gonna like, you don't know.

887
00:53:19,448 --> 00:53:21,450
－他可能不喜? －你?到底在?什?？
- No, he might not. - What the fuck are you two talking about?

888
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:24,620
他?在不正常 他?看福斯
He might not be in a place where it's okay. He watches Fox.

889
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:28,165
是我要?帕斯?的重机
It is I who am buying Paxton's motorbike.

890
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:31,669

894
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,435
我知道我必?离?他 但‥
For a while I've known I had to leave him.But...

895
00:53:50,813 --> 00:53:54,108
但失去重机是件大事
But losing the bike, yeah, that's too much.

896

Since joining Miracore three years ago,I haven't told anyone I have a partner.

965
00:58:55,576 --> 00:58:58,370
部分是因?我想?分公私

966
00:58:58,454 --> 00:59:02,249
但主要是你?得 伴????很??
Yeah, but mostly because you were embarrassed to have a partner that drives a van.

979
00:59:53,425 --> 00:59:55,761
我和大家都互相??
I knew everyone. Everyone knew me.

980
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:58,514
－很多人都?在‥ －??能不能先回到我身上？
Most of them still work there... -Is there any possibility

981

So there is a way for you to make your pick-up deliver to Heathrow without getting caught.

985
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:12,528
你能?升? 我也能搬走存?
You will get your promotion and I will get my stock removed

986
01:00:12,611 --> 01:00:13,737
?人?知情
and no one will know.

987
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:15,656
但那???法
But we will be breaking the law.

988
01:00:15,739 --> 01:00:20,160
所以你要完全照我?的做
So you're gonna have to do absolutely everything I tell you to do.

I have an update about the Eve Schwarz clear-out on Saturday.

1028
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:16,151

You see, all the secure freight companies have been booked and it looks like our logistics

I know the Harrods security system and I'd like to run the checks on the driver myself.

1036
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,836
不用啦 那是伊姆?的工作
Oh, no, no, that's Imran's job. That's...

Tomorrow, I'll run you through the system myself and then get you into the store.

1043
01:02:49,935 --> 01:02:51,186
在那之后?能出什??？
After that, what can go wrong?

1044
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,063
太棒了 感?

The lockdown will eventually end.

1051
01:03:15,794 --> 01:03:17,338
然后‥
Then...

1052
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:20,758
我就?失去此生??
the love of my life will be gone.

1053
01:03:22,926 --> 01:03:26,138
帕斯? 你?放下?件事的 你?走出情?
Paxton, you will move on from this. You will heal.

1054
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:28,599
我的人生?多出巨大的空缺
There'll be a huge hole in my life.

1055
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:32,644
你?改?与成?
You'll change and grow. And...

1056

1057
01:03:37,066 --> 01:03:38,525
你?遇?新?象

你?的是那?机? ?吧？
You were talking about the bike, weren't you?

? 干嘛?？
Yeah. Why?

1060
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:54,541
那?机?是我人生的??之一
The bike is one of the loves of my life.

1061
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:57,127
－而我是空缺？ －你?然是最大的空缺
-And I am one of the holes? -Obviously you're the biggest hole.

1062
01:03:57,211 --> 01:03:58,796
真是??你

1063

街上空?一人
The streets are completely deserted.

1065
01:04:06,303 --> 01:04:08,764
我本?要趁封城?最后一回
I was gonna call it "Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1066
01:04:09,556 --> 01:04:10,974
我想?‥
I thought maybe...

1067
01:04:13,185 --> 01:04:14,645
我不能跟你去 帕斯?
Oh, no, I can't go with you, Paxton.

1068
01:04:14,728 --> 01:04:16,480
我有?重要的??

1069
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:23,654
??的道路和一?破碎的心
An open road and a broken heart.

1070
01:04:25,155 --> 01:04:26,699
??小心?
Don't kill yourself.

1071

1073
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:38,711
挺不好?的
You know, it's been quite difficult.

1074
01:04:39,712 --> 01:04:40,963
完全能想像
I can imagine.

1075
01:04:41,046 --> 01:04:42,506
我在山?上隔离
You know, I'm locked up on a mountaintop

1076
01:04:42,589 --> 01:04:44,717
只有老? 熊 ?有家人跟我作伴
with only eagles and bears and my family for company.

1077
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,885
拜托?自?
Please don't kill yourself.

1078
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:48,095
什?？
What?

1079
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:51,181
我?能有????一定很棒
I said it must be nice to have time to yourself.

1080
01:04:51,265 --> 01:04:56,270
?之 在我??? 你回到??的重大?定前
Anyway, before we get on to the exciting business decision to come home to New York,

1081
01:04:56,353 --> 01:04:59,732
有?好消息 哈裡斯鑽石有?家了
the good news is that we have found a buyer for the Harris Diamond.

1082
01:04:59,815 --> 01:05:01,150
其?我???定要回??
Uh, actually, I haven't decided to come home to New York.

1083
01:05:01,233 --> 01:05:04,737
?家在?上介?看到鑽石
The buyer saw the diamond on the virtual presentation

1084

1085
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:09,116
太棒了 ?家是?？
That's great. Who is it?

1086
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:13,037
琳?啊 在我?的新世界 是不??家身份的
In our new world, Linda,one does not ask who.

1087
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,788
他是匿名的 但我能告?你
He's anonymous.But I can tell you this. He's, um...

1088
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:18,459
他是某???的家族 令人??的成?
A very unpleasant member of a very unpleasant family

1089
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:22,338
那?家族用可怕的方式 ?治一???的?家
who run a very unpleasant country in a very unpleasant way.

1090
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,758
他?米拉克 在他的?家做生意
He is facilitating Miracore in his country

1091
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:29,094
所以我?自促成了????
and so I've brokered the purchase of the diamond personally.

1092
01:05:29,178 --> 01:05:31,764
哈洛德不愿意跟他扯上?系
Harrods themselves will have nothing to do with him,

1093
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:34,725
所以我就?中?人
so I have acted as go-between.

1094
01:05:35,893 --> 01:05:37,686
我?好棒 ?吧？
Hurray for us, no?

1095
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,313
? 我?好棒
Yes, hurray for us.

1096
01:05:40,147 --> 01:05:42,649
他?想?自?拿鑽石?？
Uh, will he be wanting to pick up the diamond in person?

1097
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:44,401
他不得入境英?
He is not allowed into the UK.

1098
01:05:44,485 --> 01:05:46,111
好像是跟‥
Something to do with, um...

1099
01:05:46,195 --> 01:05:48,697
洗?有? ?是侵犯人?？
Money laundering? Human rights abuses?

1100
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:51,867
?之 重要的??
Anyway, the big question, Linda,

1101
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,745
目前要??的?? 是琳?的未?
the issue at hand here is the future of Linda.

1102
01:05:54,828 --> 01:05:56,580
你什??候回家？
When will you be coming home?

1103
01:05:58,707 --> 01:06:03,671
我?定等封城?束 再?定要不要回??
Well, I've decided to leave my decision about New York until after lockdown is lifted.

1104
01:06:03,754 --> 01:06:07,049
我在?敦有很多??的人
I have lots of ties in London.

1105
01:06:08,217 --> 01:06:09,968
我听?你?身
Uh-huh. I was told that you're single.

1106
01:06:12,471 --> 01:06:15,391
其?不是的
Actually, that was never true,

1107
01:06:15,474 --> 01:06:17,893
但?在真的?身了
but actually now it is.

1108
01:06:17,976 --> 01:06:21,647
你?身是我希望 你???的理由之一
The fact that you are single is one of the reasons I want you to come to New York.

1109
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:23,941
我打算好好了解你
I'm planning to get to know more about you.

1110
01:06:24,024 --> 01:06:26,610
你令我著迷 琳?
You...You fascinate me, Linda.

1111
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:28,570
表面上如此?悍
So tough on the outside,

1112
01:06:29,321 --> 01:06:33,158
但你的?心也如此?？
but inside,are you tough?

1113
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,330
你??得你到巴黎的?候?？
Do you remember when you came to Paris?

1114
01:06:38,414 --> 01:06:39,957
?完?的那?晚上
That evening, after the meeting,

1115
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,126
我本?要?你去吃晚餐
I was going to take you out to dinner.

1116
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:45,879
我那晚本?想?惑你的
I was actually going to try to seduce you that night.

1117
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:50,426
我想不到那?晚上?怎??
Well, I can only speculate what kind of evening that might have been.

1118
01:06:50,509 --> 01:06:54,430
但我猜可能?有碎玻璃
But I suspect it would have involved broken glass.

1119
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:58,308
?之 我?把鑽石寄送到 可能?人如麻的老兄家裡
Anyway, uh, should I send the diamond to this probable mass murderer's home

1120
01:06:58,392 --> 01:07:01,395
?是直接送到他的拷?密室？
or should I send it straight to his torture chamber?

1121
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:03,147
什?？
What?

1122
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,232
我要把鑽石寄去哪裡？
Where would you like me to send the diamond?

1123
01:07:07,067 --> 01:07:08,402
寄到??
Ah, send it to New York.

1124
01:07:08,485 --> 01:07:09,737
因?疫情?系
Um, because of COVID,

1125
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:13,741
鑽石?直接送? ??街的安全金?
it will be couriered directly to a safe vault in Wall Street.

1126
01:07:13,824 --> 01:07:15,826
那裡?人能?查?品
There'll be no one to check it there,

1127
01:07:15,909 --> 01:07:20,205
所以?确保?明文件 都?在盒子裡
so please make sure that the verification papers are in the box.

1128
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:21,582
知道了?？
Got that?

1129
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:25,210
?我?很多的新客???
For many of our new wave of clients,

the act of acquisition is an end in itself.

1131

??? 琳? 保重
Okay. See you in New York, Linda. Take care.

1132

??了 琳?
Don't be ridiculous, Linda.

由于??用口罩缺? 民?用?衣服自制口罩
A shortage of medical masks,people are making their own from old clothing.

1135
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:26,438
但世???表示 不确定自制口罩是否‥
But the WHO said it doesn't know whether homemade masks...

1136
01:08:26,522 --> 01:08:27,564
你去哪儿了？
Hey.Where'd you go?

-What do you mean, you don't know? -I was just driving really, really fast,

1140
01:08:34,405 --> 01:08:36,156
因?警察追著我
because I was being chased by the police.

1141
01:08:36,824 --> 01:08:38,867
－什?？ －我在玩封城新游?
- What? - I was playing a new lockdown game.

1142
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:41,662
??停 ??行
Green for stop, red for go.

1143
01:08:41,745 --> 01:08:42,830
要死了

我是空城中 空??道路上的一道光
I'm a streak of light on an empty road in a deserted city.

1146

我是世上最后一?人
I'm the last man alive.

1147

我任由道路??我
I let the road direct me and I achieved that moment

1148
01:08:51,213 --> 01:08:55,467
?到了机?与人一体的?妙境界
of transcendence where the bike becomes part of your body.

1149
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:59,013
我?到了南?敦 某?有可??物?的都???
I found myself in South London on some sort of urban farm with a petting zoo

1150
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:00,139
我躲在山羊群裡
and I hid among the goats.

1151
01:09:00,222 --> 01:09:02,891
?得吧 我??异教徒? 山羊是我的???物
Remember the goat was my totem animal when we were pagans.

1152
01:09:02,975 --> 01:09:04,018
我跟山羊坐在一起
I sat with the goats and then resumed

1153
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:07,604
警?疾?而?后 我??踏上旅程
my journey as the police cars drove past.

1154
01:09:07,688 --> 01:09:08,939
我去了佩克?
I was in Peckham.

1155
01:09:09,398 --> 01:09:10,774
我?你?了香?
I bought you cigarettes.

1156
01:09:10,858 --> 01:09:12,234
自己也抽了一根
And I had one myself.

1157
01:09:12,776 --> 01:09:15,320
我十年?抽的第一根真?
My first real, real one in ten years.

1158
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:18,824
你?得? ?草有青春的味道
And you were right, tobacco tastes like youth!

1159
01:09:18,907 --> 01:09:21,243
真?就是真? 我?的是真?草
And real is real, and real tobacco is me really,

1160
01:09:21,326 --> 01:09:23,662
我?在就想再?一根 我要抽了
and I want another one right now and I'm gonna have one.

1161
01:09:37,718 --> 01:09:40,554
我好久都??? 你?在的眼神了
You have a look in your eyes I haven't seen in a long time.

1162
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:42,681
我不是故意要?你
I don't mean to frighten you.

1163
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:44,600
我?有?到
I'm not frightened.

1164
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,563
?得我跟你?? 巴黎的玻璃?和???？
Remember I told you about the glass horse and jockey in Paris?

1165
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:52,274
不?得 我?在想那些山羊
No, I'm still with the goats.

1166
01:09:52,358 --> 01:09:53,942
它?的眼睛是?的
They had blue eyes.

1167
01:09:54,026 --> 01:09:57,988
我抓著雕像??的部分 然后?了一圈‥
I held the horse and jockey by the jockey and swung it around and...

1168
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:00,741
我想起了??士的感?
And I remembered how it felt to be a rider

1169
01:10:00,824 --> 01:10:03,744
跟你?著的?西 合?一体的感受
and to feel like you're a part of the thing that you are riding.

1170
01:10:03,827 --> 01:10:05,537
那是一种如性?的感?
It's a sexual feeling.

1171
01:10:06,413 --> 01:10:07,706
??
Yeah, it is.

1172
01:10:08,749 --> 01:10:10,959
我?在后悔?跟你去了
I now wish I'd come with you.

1173
01:10:11,752 --> 01:10:13,295
是?？
Really?

1174
01:10:13,379 --> 01:10:15,214
帕斯?
Paxton,

1175
01:10:15,756 --> 01:10:19,176
很久以? 我都知道我??束了
for a long time, I've known that our relationship was over.

1176
01:10:19,259 --> 01:10:22,680
很?一段?? 我?之?只剩下性
And for a long time, the only unbroken thread between us has been sex.

1177
01:10:23,472 --> 01:10:24,890
???
Go on.

1178
01:10:24,973 --> 01:10:26,475
我?得?一刻十分?耐
I'm finding this moment difficult because...

1179
01:10:26,558 --> 01:10:29,561
因?我?誓? 不??生?种事
I made a vow this wouldn't happen,

1180
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:34,233
你能不能?掉皮外套 去拿一?茶巾？
so could you just take the leather jacket off and go hold a tea towel or something?

1181
01:10:34,316 --> 01:10:36,610
－拿茶巾？ －或去?牛奶 那就?大忙了
- Hold a tea towel? - Or buy some milk, it would help me.

1182
01:10:36,694 --> 01:10:38,070
－我?有牛奶了 －或烤面包
- We have milk. - Or bake bread.

1183
01:10:38,153 --> 01:10:39,279
那???能破坏气氛
That would definitely kill the moment.

1184
01:10:39,363 --> 01:10:41,532
我只想?上机? ?情??
I just want to get on my bike and ride

1185
01:10:42,074 --> 01:10:43,617
管全世界去死
and fuck the world.

1186
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:49,248
好了 帕斯? 是??的
Okay, Paxton, here it is.

1187
01:10:50,624 --> 01:10:52,418
?可能是封城造成的
Probably as a result of lockdown,

1188
01:10:52,501 --> 01:10:54,753
你?生了?????的?狂??
you have a mad urge to ride your motorbike through red lights.

1189
01:10:54,837 --> 01:10:56,630
而?小?前 我也有股?狂??
And as of two hours ago, I have a mad urge

1190
01:10:56,714 --> 01:10:59,425
想??人魔手中 偷走价值三百万英?的鑽石
to steal a diamond worth three million pounds from a mass murderer

1191
01:10:59,508 --> 01:11:01,760
－然后?掉工作 ???家 －什?？
-and quit my job and become an artist. -What?

1192
01:11:01,844 --> 01:11:05,723
但我?得要?洩?股?狂?? 最??的做法
But I think the most practical thing we can do to get this madness out of our system

1193
01:11:05,806 --> 01:11:06,890
就是我打破誓言
is that I break my vow

1194
01:11:06,974 --> 01:11:10,185
然后我?立刻上?去做?
and we go upstairs right now and have sex.

1195
01:11:10,269 --> 01:11:12,104
封城最后?一回
"Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1196
01:11:13,856 --> 01:11:15,607
先是山羊 ?在又??
Goats, now this.

1197

1198
01:11:26,744 --> 01:11:27,786

Oh, by the way,

1201
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:34,668
你听?一??人 埃德加??坡?？
you ever heard of a poet called Edgar Allan Poe?

1202
01:11:34,752 --> 01:11:36,670
－什?？ －算了 ?事
- What? - Yeah, never mind.

1203
01:11:36,754 --> 01:11:38,047
等一下
All right. One second.

1204
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,923
您收听的是 ”和多明尼克??”
You're listening to Drive Time with Dominic.

Uh, Linda, I'm just calling to say that

1208
01:12:02,988 --> 01:12:05,783
我知道今天下午 ?什?特?意?
I know this afternoon didn't mean anything,

1209
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:09,411
但我想告?你 那感?像是‥
but I want you to know that it would have felt like, uh...

1210
01:12:10,162 --> 01:12:13,165
南?科塔 那?下雨的下午
like South Dakota that afternoon when it rained.

1211
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:16,085
我?有一段?异的??
And also, I have this bizarre memory that just before

1212
01:12:16,168 --> 01:12:20,506
我?偏离正道之前 你提到要偷鑽石
we strayed from the path of righteousness,you said something about stealing a diamond.

1213
01:12:20,589 --> 01:12:22,675
你?什?要偷鑽石
...you said something about stealing a diamond.

1214
01:12:23,509 --> 01:12:24,885
是我幻想的?？
Did I imagine that?

1215
01:12:24,968 --> 01:12:27,805

No, Grandma, I am not seriously considering it.

1218
01:12:46,573 --> 01:12:47,616

Fuck.

1219
01:13:00,045 --> 01:13:03,924
病患?后通常在此休?
This is where the patients usually recover post-surgery.

1220
01:13:04,008 --> 01:13:07,845
但?在必?收容加?病房 ?法容?的新冠肺炎患者
But now, it's needed for COVID-19 overflow from intensive care.

This is just us organizing what it is that we're gonna do, okay?

1233
01:13:51,055 --> 01:13:53,223
不要想太多 好?？
It's nothing else.

1234
01:13:53,307 --> 01:13:54,767
不然是可以想什?？
Why, what else would it be?

1235
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,435
?什? 你干嘛?？
Nothing. Why do you ask?

1236
01:13:57,519 --> 01:13:58,854
－你?好?？ －我？
-Are you okay? -Me?

1240
01:14:07,196 --> 01:14:10,324
地表?都?外?放
The top part is the public area.

1241
01:14:10,407 --> 01:14:13,869
但地下?有七??
But below ground, there are seven floors.

1242

?裡是?? 有很多密道
Floors where merchandise is stored and lots of tunnels

哈洛德的保全非常?密
Security at Harrods is unbelievably tight,

1247
01:14:27,675 --> 01:14:30,469
?入偷?根本是不可能的事
it would be impossible to get inside to actually steal something.

1248
01:14:30,552 --> 01:14:31,637
偷？
Steal?

1249
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,764
??要偷?西了？
Who's talking about stealing anything?

1250

冷?? 帕斯? 不要大惊小怪好不好
Everything is normal. Paxton, stop being weird.

1251
01:14:36,684 --> 01:14:38,519
我才不是大惊小怪
It's not me being weird.

1252
01:14:39,687 --> 01:14:42,690
你分明?有用心 而且?欲??彰
I mean, you clearly appear to have a hidden agenda,which is not really that hidden,

1253
01:14:42,773 --> 01:14:46,485
我不知道那是什? ?有你的眼睛上有髒?西
but I don't know what it is.Also, you've got a smudge above your eye.

1254
01:14:47,236 --> 01:14:49,780

?有鑽石的事
And about a diamond.

1257
01:14:53,826 --> 01:14:55,744
帕斯? 你有什?毛病？
Paxton, what is the matter with you?

1258
01:14:57,037 --> 01:14:59,081
－我?有毛病 －你?真？
- There's nothing the matter with me. - Seriously?

1259
01:14:59,164 --> 01:15:03,043
昨天你?要偷鑽石
Yesterday, you were talking about stealing a diamond.

1260

你肯定?? 不是我自己?想
You were, I'm not imagining it.

1261
01:15:05,254 --> 01:15:09,633
今天你就?出哈洛德的地? 好像有什?秘密?划
And today, you are drawing Harrods like it's, uh,some kind of secret plan in

1262
01:15:09,717 --> 01:15:14,763
－好像劫?片一? －秘密?划哪??那?粗糙
-a secret heist movie. -How can you draw a rectangle like you're in a secret plan? I don't...

1263
01:15:14,847 --> 01:15:16,724
你有?有秘密?划嘛
Do you have a secret plan?

1264
01:15:17,474 --> 01:15:18,767

You know...

1265
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,812
我昨天?到我奶奶
I saw my grandmother's face yesterday.

1266
01:15:21,895 --> 01:15:24,273
我跟奶奶?我???
I told her, "It's okay, Grandma, I am fine.

1267
01:15:24,356 --> 01:15:26,483
??不?做出蠢事
I'm not going to do anything stupid."

1268
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:28,986
你?那?鑽石叫哈裡斯鑽石
You said the diamond is called a Harris Diamond.

1269
01:15:29,069 --> 01:15:30,154
拜托 帕斯?
Oh, Paxton, come on.

1270
01:15:31,655 --> 01:15:33,407
今天是周六 天亮了
It's Saturday. It's morning.

1271
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:38,787
凌晨四?的怪异幻想 早就?消云散了
All the weird 4:00 a.m. fantasies and options have gone away as they always do.

1272
01:15:38,871 --> 01:15:40,497
那是怎?的鑽石？
Tell me about the diamond.

1273
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:45,544
哈裡斯鑽石有??

1274

- What? - There are two Harris Diamonds, okay. God!

1275
01:15:49,923 --> 01:15:51,508
?什?有??？
Why are there two?

1276
01:15:52,343 --> 01:15:54,845
你以?我昨晚有睡?？
Do you think I slept at all last night, Paxton?

1277
01:15:54,928 --> 01:15:57,264
?有 整晚?睡
Well actually, no, I didn't.

1278
01:15:57,348 --> 01:15:59,224
那你?什?醒著？
And what was it that kept you awake?

1279

One is real,

1282
01:16:06,273 --> 01:16:08,984
另一?是假的
the other is fake.

1283
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:11,528
?种价位的鑽石不?展示真品
Whenever a diamond of this value is exhibited in store,

1284
01:16:11,612 --> 01:16:13,989
大家看到的一定是复制品
they use a replica of the real thing to put into the public area.

1285
01:16:14,073 --> 01:16:16,909
真品一定在金?的保?箱裡
The actual diamond is kept safe in the vaults.

1286
01:16:16,992 --> 01:16:20,746
?在复制品在?裡展示
Currently, the replica is on display here on

1287
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:22,373
位在一?
the ground floor.

1288
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:25,668
但是真品放在?裡
But your real Harris Diamond is here in the vaults.

1289
01:16:26,627 --> 01:16:27,961
?在金?
Tonight,

1290
01:16:28,045 --> 01:16:30,923
今晚七?整 保全??我??金?
at exactly 7:00 p.m.,you and I will be escorted to the vaults by security

1291
01:16:31,006 --> 01:16:32,633
拿取真正的哈裡斯鑽石
to collect the real Harris Diamond.

1292
01:16:32,716 --> 01:16:36,345
然后我?搭秘密?梯去一?
We will then go up the ground floor in a secure elevator where we add the diamond

1293
01:16:36,428 --> 01:16:38,681
并在?梯?把鑽石 放入伊芙?沃典藏?中
to the rest of the Eve Schwarz collection.

1294
01:16:38,764 --> 01:16:40,474
到了七?半
Then, right there at 7:30 p.m.,

1295
01:16:40,557 --> 01:16:43,143
我?手中?有真品 跟以假?真的复制品
we will have the real diamond and the very good replica diamond, side by side,

1296
01:16:43,227 --> 01:16:45,896
放一起的? 常人根本分不出真?
next to each other, almost indistinguishable.

1297
01:16:45,979 --> 01:16:47,606
而因?疫情封城
And because of COVID restrictions,

1298
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:51,944
只有你跟我?人?在?
the only people that will be there are you and me.

1299
01:16:52,027 --> 01:16:56,073
所以我?要把真的鑽石 放?保?箱 寄回??
So, then we put the real diamond into a secure box and send it to New York,

1300
01:16:56,156 --> 01:16:58,909
然后把玻璃复制品 放?我的包包 拿去?掉
and we take the glass replica and I put it in my purse, we take it away for disposal,

1301
01:16:58,992 --> 01:17:01,578
?就是我?的完整流程 ?有?的了
and that is what we are going to fucking do,exactly that and nothing else.

1302
01:17:01,662 --> 01:17:04,039
奶奶 我?你
Grandma, I love you.

1303
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,710
能??很明?的???？
May I ask a very obvious question?

1304
01:17:07,793 --> 01:17:08,961
不可以
No, you may not.

1305
01:17:09,044 --> 01:17:12,131
如果我?把复制品寄回??
What would happen if we sent the replica to New York

1306
01:17:12,214 --> 01:17:13,632
拿走真品
and kept the real thing?

1307
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:15,676
我想鑽石寄???后
I'm assuming that as soon as it got to New York,

1308
01:17:15,759 --> 01:17:18,303
一定?有人??是假?吧
someone would realize that it was fake.

1309
01:17:18,387 --> 01:17:20,681
不? ?有人???
No, they wouldn't.

1310
01:17:20,764 --> 01:17:23,017
所以我才?夜未眠
That is why I couldn't sleep.

1311
01:17:23,517 --> 01:17:25,769
不管我?寄哪一?去??
Whichever one we send to New York,

1312
01:17:25,853 --> 01:17:27,938
都?被直接送???街的金?
it will go into a secure vault in Wall Street

1313
01:17:28,022 --> 01:17:29,648
下次有人?看到它
and won't even be looked at by another human being

1314
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:32,359
可能是二十 五十 百年后的事了
for 20, 50, 100 years.

1315
01:17:32,443 --> 01:17:34,069
老天啊
Holy fuck.

1316
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:38,407
三百万英?
Three million pounds, tax free.

1317
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:40,868
不用抽? 不用付出代价
No consequences.

1318
01:17:40,951 --> 01:17:42,619
你一份 我一份 一份?健保局
One for me, one for you, one for the NHS.

1319
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:44,913
－你明明???念 －不行 我‥
-You have thought about this. -No, I can't

1320
01:17:44,997 --> 01:17:46,165
我要去冥想了
You know, I need to go meditate.

1321
01:17:47,124 --> 01:17:49,043
??真的不??查?？
Are you sure they won't check it in New York?

1322
01:17:49,126 --> 01:17:50,294
?嘴 我要冥想
Shut up. I need to meditate.

1323
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:52,212
你想表?什?？
What were you going to say?

1324
01:17:53,172 --> 01:17:54,923
鑽石的?家是??人
The man who bought the diamond is bad.

1325
01:17:55,007 --> 01:17:56,759
他是大?棍 我??是好人
He's really bad, and you and I are good.

1326
01:17:56,842 --> 01:17:59,053
健保也是好制度 全都比那??棍好
And the NHS is good. And good is better than bad.

1327
01:17:59,136 --> 01:18:02,139
我跟奶奶解?的?候 ?她都?有道理
When I explained all that to Grandma,even she said, "Well, yeah, that's true."

1328
01:18:02,222 --> 01:18:04,725
她可是喀?文教派的?杆信徒
And she was a Calvinist, straight as a rod.

1329
01:18:04,808 --> 01:18:08,062
不像我 ??容易受?惑
Unlike me, who is weak in the face of temptation.

1330
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,816
不放?毋宁死 琳?
Live wild or die, Linda.

1331
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,903
帕斯? 你忘了一件很重要的事
Paxton, you're forgetting something very important, okay?

1332
01:18:15,986 --> 01:18:18,113
假?‥我?真的行?
Assuming that we do this thing,

1333
01:18:18,197 --> 01:18:19,698
我知道?不可能
which we definitely won't,

1334
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,534
我???普通人
how would two ordinary people like you and me

1335
01:18:22,618 --> 01:18:26,330
去哪儿找?路 ??三百万英?的鑽石？
find a way to sell a three million pounds stolen diamond?

1336
01:18:27,081 --> 01:18:28,707
好的 就是?? 我使出?身解?
Okay, that was it. That was my last attempt

1337
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,334
?明我?不?做?种事
to find a logical reason why we shouldn't do this,

1338
01:18:30,417 --> 01:18:32,461
但你一定?? 找阿契布?斯 ?吧？
but you are going to say "Archie Bruce," aren't you?

1339
01:18:32,544 --> 01:18:33,921
??
Yes, I am.

1340
01:18:34,713 --> 01:18:36,173
阿契布?斯
Archie Bruce.

1341
01:18:37,424 --> 01:18:39,885
?几年我一直跟他有?系
Over the years, I've kept up with the guys.

1342
01:18:40,427 --> 01:18:46,642
阿契布?斯 ?摩托?偷到老??
I mean, Archie Bruce,he's graduated from stealing motorcycles to stealing vintage cars

1343
01:18:46,725 --> 01:18:48,102
?偷??品跟珠?
and fine art and jewelry.

1344
01:18:48,185 --> 01:18:53,232
他一定可以?松把鑽石 ?到莫斯科的某???公寓
I mean, he'd have Mr. Harris in a penthouse in Moscow before the banging of the next saucepans.

1345
01:18:53,315 --> 01:18:54,775
而且他一定?答?
And he'd do a preferential deal with you,

1346
01:18:54,858 --> 01:18:56,276
因?你那一晚挺身而出
because you stepped in one night and saved his life

1347
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:00,114
在沃福的酒吧救了他的命
at a roadhouse in Watford.

1348
01:19:00,197 --> 01:19:02,324
某种因果?回吧
Circle of life, something like that.

1349
01:19:03,826 --> 01:19:06,161
一切折磨因阿契而起
With Archie Bruce, the nightmare began.

1350
01:19:06,745 --> 01:19:09,164
?在由阿契?了?
Maybe with Archie Bruce, the nightmare ends.

1351
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:12,376
所以‥
So,

1352
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:16,130
我?要怎?? 琳?？
what are we going to do, Linda?

1353
01:19:19,133 --> 01:19:20,175
好吧
Okay,

1354
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:22,261
??吧 帕斯?
Paxton, here it is.

1355
01:19:24,221 --> 01:19:25,639
我?今晚?定
We decide tonight.

1356
01:19:26,682 --> 01:19:28,559
我?到哈洛德?眼看到鑽石
When we're there at Harrods with the diamonds,

1357
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:30,310
就?知道?怎?做了
we're gonna know what's right and what's wrong.

1358
01:19:30,394 --> 01:19:32,354
我????定
We'll decide in the moment.

1359
01:19:32,438 --> 01:19:34,606
或是?其自然
Or let the moment decide.

1360
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,484
有什?不同？
What's the difference?

1361
01:19:37,568 --> 01:19:39,611
一?是宿命 一?是自由意志
Fate versus free will.

1362
01:19:39,695 --> 01:19:41,572
?控制著我?的命?？
Who controls our destiny?

1363
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,908
一切都早已注定 或者我?自己搞砸了？
Is everything part of a plan or do we fuck things up for ourselves?

1364
01:19:46,535 --> 01:19:48,662
今晚七?半就?知道了
Tonight at 7:30, we find out.

1365
01:19:57,546 --> 01:19:58,964
你好 半?兄弟
Hey, half-brother.

1366
01:20:00,382 --> 01:20:01,759
什? ?在？
What, now?

1367
01:20:01,842 --> 01:20:03,385
你想要??？
You wanna Zoom?

1368
01:20:03,927 --> 01:20:05,220
好 等我一下
All right, give me a minute.

1369
01:20:13,812 --> 01:20:14,938
帕斯?
Ah, Paxton,

1370
01:20:15,022 --> 01:20:16,273
你好?？
how are you?

1371
01:20:16,774 --> 01:20:19,318
我?在有??豫不?
Actually, I am at a fork in the road.

1372
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:20,569
是?？
Really?

1373
01:20:20,986 --> 01:20:23,322
我要?的?准能?你 ?定?哪?路
Then perhaps what I have to say will have some bearing on which fork you take,

1374
01:20:23,405 --> 01:20:25,491
跟路?真有??系
because it is sort of road related.

1375
01:20:27,117 --> 01:20:30,537
前几天你?要把重机?掉
You see, Paxton, the other day when you said you want to sell your motorcycle,

1376
01:20:30,621 --> 01:20:34,416
我就?等等 ?那?急
I thought, "Wait a minute. Time out. Not so fast."

1377
01:20:35,542 --> 01:20:38,087
我挂掉??之后
And then, after I cut the call

1378
01:20:39,046 --> 01:20:41,340
－就想到老? －老?？
-I thought about Mom. -Mum?

1379
01:20:41,423 --> 01:20:44,385
你被迫?掉最珍?的?西 她?做何感想？
How she would feel about you having to sell

1380
01:20:44,468 --> 01:20:47,096
而我?在美?的哈得?谷快活
your most precious possession,while at the same time, over here

1381
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:50,849
你的异父兄弟?得?不?
in the beautiful Hudson Valley,your brother, your half-brother isn't having it so bad.

1382
01:20:50,933 --> 01:20:55,229
果?的?桃??出蕈?
You know, when the cherry trees in your orchard get a fungus,

1383
01:20:55,312 --> 01:20:58,232
是很不妙 但?有更糟的事
it sucks, but there are worse things.

1384
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:01,527
??桃???确?不是最糟
Yeah, not for the cherry tree.

1385
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:04,321
??桃??? 最糟的事 莫?于?治?盛?
Maybe worse for a cherry tree is the steady tread of George Washington

1386
01:21:04,405 --> 01:21:07,741
怀著好意拿著斧?出?
as he approaches with an axe in his hand and a head full of good intentions.

1387
01:21:07,825 --> 01:21:10,661
?之 我想到 老??希望我怎?做
Anyway, I wondered what Mom would want me to do.

1388
01:21:10,744 --> 01:21:13,664
老????希望你??短?
Well, remembering Mum,I think she'd want you to get to the point.

1389
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:17,209
好吧 帕斯?
Okay, Paxton,

1390
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:18,544
我就?了
here it is.

1391
01:21:19,795 --> 01:21:23,007
你的??重机是我?的
It is I who has bought your precious motorcycle.

1392
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:25,801
重机的?家就是我
The purchaser of your bike is me.

1393
01:21:25,884 --> 01:21:28,012
我要把???你
And I am giving it back to you.

1394
01:21:28,095 --> 01:21:30,639
一?善意 同母异父的兄弟情
My gesture, half-brother to half-brother.

1395
01:21:30,723 --> 01:21:33,684
你的重机回到你手中了
Your bike is yours once more.

1396
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:35,310
不要感?我 帕斯?
Don't thank me, Paxton.

1397
01:21:35,394 --> 01:21:36,854
真的 不需要
Please. No need.

1398
01:21:36,937 --> 01:21:40,274
我只有一件事有求于你
All I ask, the only thing I ask of you, Paxton,

1399
01:21:40,357 --> 01:21:43,318
?你??在?始善待自己
is that you are kind to yourself from now on.

1400
01:21:43,402 --> 01:21:46,572
?取教? 你要明白世界不跟你作?
That you learn from this.That the world does not hate you.

1401
01:21:46,655 --> 01:21:49,491
?? 命?有?很捉弄人
That, yes, sometimes fate seems harsh and cruel,

1402
01:21:49,575 --> 01:21:51,827
但要知道人性本善‥
but people really do what good...

1403
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:55,080
大? 我是琳? 你好
Hey, David, it's Linda. Hi!

1404
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:57,833
琳? 我正在跟帕斯???
Uh, Linda, I thought I was just speaking to Paxton.

1405
01:21:57,916 --> 01:22:00,127
我知道 我听?你的大善事了
Yes, I know. I heard, David, your magnificent gesture,

1406
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:03,547
我?在情不自禁 一定要?自跟你??
and I just... I couldn't stop myself,I couldn't help myself. I just had to jump on the call

1407
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:07,051
告?你我多感? 你真是?大好人
and say, "Oh, my God, David.What kind of a person are you?"

1408
01:22:07,134 --> 01:22:08,552
大??了我的重机
David bought my fucking bike.

1409
01:22:08,635 --> 01:22:11,722
我听?了 也听?他?教
Yes, I heard. I heard, and then I heard the sermon,

1410
01:22:11,805 --> 01:22:15,059
他不只花?不手?
and I thought, "Wow!Not only is he so generous with his cash,

1411

- Anyway, Paxton, there it is... - No, no, no.

1413

??我打??感人的一刻
Don't let me interrupt this meaningful moment.

1414
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:26,820
大? 你????的大道理‥
What is it that you were saying, David?Something about fate being harsh and...

1415
01:22:37,164 --> 01:22:38,999
－你干嘛?他?火？ －我?有啊
-Why were you mad at him? -I wasn't mad.

1416
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:40,209
明明就有
Yes, you were.

1417
01:22:41,502 --> 01:22:42,836
就是你
It was you.

你?走我的重机
You bought my bike.

1419

Paxton, don't be ridiculous. You heard what David said.

1420
01:22:48,926 --> 01:22:51,887
大?才不可能那?好心 倒是很??功?
David would never do something like that,but he would take the credit.

1421
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:56,058
你??做好事 又??人?走功?
Whereas you would do something like that and give the credit to someone else.

1422
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,435
是因?你可怜我吧
You did it 'cause you felt sorry for me.

1423
01:23:00,229 --> 01:23:04,274
? 我很?心 你失去一切后?怎??
Yes, I worried about what would happen if you lost everything.

1424
01:23:05,234 --> 01:23:08,195
其?主要?是我的良心?不去
Mainly because I didn't want anything bad on my conscience.

1425
01:23:08,278 --> 01:23:09,571
但同?‥
Confession avalanche, but also I...

1426

但你?可怜一? ???百万英?的男人?？
But would you still feel pity for a man who'd just stolen a million pounds?

1432

也?我?能一起?向夕?
Maybe we'd ride off into the sunset.

we will go our separate ways.

1439

有?了 表示我?都自由了
The money would mean that we're both free.

你差?害我脖子?了
I almost broke my fucking neck.

1800

若你?初要我?忙 我?拿梯子?你
If you'd asked me,I would have held the stepladders.

要是本?就在那裡 我?定?注意到
If it had been there "all along,"I would have noticed it.

但你?注意到 整理行李根本?用
But you haven't noticed that there was no point in packing a suitcase

1803
01:51:12,254 --> 01:51:14,673
因?你根本?地方可去
because there is nowhere you can actually go.

1804
01:51:15,591 --> 01:51:18,302
政府?延??周的封?

And

1808

因?今天是我的生日
because today is my birthday.

1809
01:51:39,448 --> 01:51:41,575
－??系‥ －我?得
-It's okay. - I know.

1810
01:51:41,658 --> 01:51:44,953
－我‥真的?得 －?人知道今天星期几
- It's lockdown. - No, I knew that.

1811

－我准?了?物 －日期就更??了
- Nobody knows what day it is, never mind the date. - And I got you something.

1812
01:51:46,872 --> 01:51:49,625
???物你肯定很想要
I got you something you really, really want.

1813
01:51:56,215 --> 01:51:57,758
?情??吧
Go crazy.

1814
01:52:00,803 --> 01:52:04,431
－竟然?要?周 －??
- Another two weeks? - Another two weeks.

1815
01:52:04,515 --> 01:52:09,603
看?又需要一首? ?慰受苦?久的人?
Well, then, my long suffering public may need another poem.

”?著?慢心跳 流血死去”
