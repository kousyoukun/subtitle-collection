00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:20,415
<i>Before you say anything, I'm not
your brother, I'm your half-brother.</i>

4
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:23,710
What was that? Why would you
begin a conversation like that?

5
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,713
Because you're about to ask me for money.
When I always say,

6
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:30,258
"Why should I give you money?" you
always say, "Because I am your brother."

7
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,886
And I never point out you're my
half-brother. I never say it.

8
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,472
- But things happening around here, they--
- Hi, Paxton.

9
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,098
How are your erratic head movements?

10
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:38,558
I ask because I read an article.

11
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,685
Yeah, they're under control.

12
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:42,411
How's the, uh...

13
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,314
cement artwork?

14
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:48,109
She just sold a piece for 50,000 dollars.

15
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:49,152
A frozen waterfall.

16
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,989
- It felt appropriate for the times.
- How is it appropriate for the times?

17
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:57,035
- You know, well, it doesn't matter.
- I was actually calling to see how you were.

18
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,371
- Because I heard it's bad in New York.
- It's bad.

19
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,373
They canceled the NBA.

20
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:04,417
We heard London's under total lockdown.

21
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,212
I've been furloughed, by the way.

22
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,672
- <i>That's great.</i>
- Yeah.

23
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,133
Now there is literally
zero purpose to my life.

24
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:17,972
- How's Linda?
- Yeah, she's somewhere in the house.

25
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,558
Well, is there some type of issue?

26
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:22,977
Is there an issue? Let me see.

27
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:28,274
Convenient lie to avoid forensic examination of
our domestic circumstances or tell the truth?

28
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:29,734
Okay, convenient lie.

29
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:30,944
No, there is no issue.

30
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,127
We are fine.

31
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:36,074
- Well, can you tell her I'm gonna Skype her?
- Also, David, I've sold my motorbike.

32
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,784
- You've what?
- I have a buyer.

33
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,494
He'll pay me when we are all unlocked

34
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:42,539
from this fucking prison
of psychological hell-chains,

35
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:45,375
the fucking flames of burning aloneness.

36
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,461
The screw of isolation
until you can't tell what is your body

37
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:49,754
and what is furniture.

38
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:52,382
No possibility of revving the engine
and riding away.

39
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,801
Am I conveying anything of my mood to you?

40
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,387
Why have you sold your bike?

41
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,013
<i>You are your bike, your bike is you.</i>

42
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,932
Yeah, I have sold myself.

43
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:04,018
I have sold my former self.

44
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,645
I felt sorry for the bike.

45
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,690
It deserved someone
who can do justice to its spirit.

46
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:11,609
Someone who still breaks the fucking rules.

47
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,863
So you and-- You and Linda, what?
You had a fight.

48
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,824
Linda said she was
planning to end our thing.

49
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,119
Our relationship, our...

50
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,873
whatever this ever was,
because we've grown apart.

51
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,834
Meaning that she had gone up
and I have gone down.

52
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,086
She planned to end it
before lockdown was announced.

53
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,131
In our conversation,
there were a lot of droplets

54
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,216
and moisture because we were shouting.

55
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:38,553
I said some things
and she said some things

56
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:41,598
and now we are stuck here together
with the things we said

57
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:45,226
echoing around the house
like fucking bells ringing.

58
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,064
For two weeks we are locked together here.

59
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:56,446
Anyway, truth be told,
I just wanted to hear someone's voice.

60
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,531
And you chose us?

61
00:03:58,615 --> 00:03:59,715
Yeah, why not?

62
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:02,911
- What happened to Mike? Your friend Mike?
- Oh, no, no.

63
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,706
Uh, Mike and I are no longer speaking.
He crossed-- It's my delivery.

64
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,336
He crossed an important threshold
when he said that the Covid virus

65
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:16,841
was the consequence
of the secret release by Jews of alien DNA

66
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:20,345
into the water sprinkling system
of a Chinese golf resort.

67
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,932
<i>It looks like your food has arrived,
so we'll let you go.</i>

68
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,391
It's not food, it's a sandwich.

69
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,726
Yeah, hang in, brother.

70
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,646
- Half-brother.
- Tell Linda I'm gonna call her.

71
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:32,607
Yeah, I'll leave her a note
just to compound the oddness.

72
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:36,235
<i>...the stark reality
of fighting coronavirus.</i>

73
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,740
<i>From Roundhay Park in Leeds,
one of the biggest in Europe,</i>

74
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:44,827
<i>almost deserted, to Trafalgar Square
in London, usually crowded.</i>

75
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,039
<i>Evidence of social distancing in action.</i>

76
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:52,001
<i>In this critically important time,
Prime Minister Boris Johnson,</i>

77
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,128
<i>himself infected, has been sharing...</i>

78
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,403
Maria, hey, is everything okay?

79
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:21,280
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, everything's great.
You know, we're staying strong.</i>

80
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:23,032
<i>Yeah, we just talked to Paxton.</i>

81
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,284
Mm. Yes, I heard, some of it.

82
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:26,828
I put a pillow over my head.

83
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,246
<i>He said you had symptoms.</i>

84
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,666
They passed, I think. I hope. I don't know.

85
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,584
<i>Oh, green smoothie.</i>

86
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,545
<i>You must send me that recipe.</i>

87
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:37,380
It's not a recipe, it's an action.

88
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:40,091
You just put the green stuff in,
press the on button.

89
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,052
<i>How are things with you and Paxton?
Is everything okay?</i>

90
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,265
You know everything is not okay.

91
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,934
Not only is everything not okay,
nothing is okay.

92
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,854
And everything is never okay.
Even his name is not okay.

93
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:53,855
This is him speaking.

94
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:56,315
He says even his name
is a predictor of doom.

95
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,942
That's how he is lately.

96
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,612
Oh, he's changed so much.

97
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,449
<i>Oh, we all change.
I mean, Linda, you've evolved.</i>

98
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,242
<i>He's mutated. He needs some help.</i>

99
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,537
<i>- I read an article...</i>
- He said the other day that any man over 35

100
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,457
- who rides a bus is a failure.
<i>- Things aren't okay with David and I.</i>

101
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,877
- He rides the bus. He does it to torture himself.
<i>- David thinks things are okay.</i>

102
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,047
<i>No man is fully conscious, not really.
I heard he's selling his motorbike.</i>

103
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,298
<i>That's a big step.</i>

104
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,216
Yeah, we agreed he needed some time,

105
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,303
so he was planning on using the money
from the bike to go to Kazakhstan

106
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,637
to think about his life.

107
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,056
<i>Why Kazakhstan?</i>

108
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,851
We went on a road trip there ten years ago.

109
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,077
Ten years ago?

110
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,438
- A million years ago.
<i>- Oh, God.</i>

111
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,524
Anyway, now he's stuck here
and I'm stuck here.

112
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,568
<i>Linda, is there someone else?</i>

113
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,361
Nope, just me and him.

114
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,863
<i>No, I mean like another man?</i>

115
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,589
No.

116
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,007
<i>Or a woman?</i>

117
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:48,925
What?

118
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,787
<i>I was just speculating.</i>

119
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,873
<i>Thinking about that night we came to London
and you and I went too far.</i>

120
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:58,544
Oh, that was just weed and curiosity.

121
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,505
<i>We both had orgasms, Linda.</i>

122
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,591
You know, they say these calls
aren't really the most secure.

123
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,426
<i>I think about that night sometimes.</i>

124
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,261
- You do?
<i>- Yeah, don't you?</i>

125
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,681
Mm, listen, Maria. I have been
on Skype and Zoom calls all day.

126
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,226
The office is locked down.
I really gotta get some sleep.

127
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,644
<i>- Okay, bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

128
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:15,827
<i>I love you.</i>

129
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,329
What?

130
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,947
God.

131
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,337
Paxton? Are you going somewhere?

132
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:46,008
- Where would I be going?
- Why is the hose in the exhaust?

133
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:47,969
I was just...

134
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,096
Oh, I was just gonna take a selfie.

135
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,974
Someone at work texted me
and asked how I was coping with lockdown.

136
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,517
I was gonna send a photo of myself

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,894
with a hose shoved up my helmet
by way of reply.

138
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:58,229
I thought it'd be funny.

139
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,941
An amusing expression of despair.

140
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,318
You were really just gonna take a selfie?

141
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,572
- I had the phone in my hand, didn't I?
- You weren't gonna start the engine?

142
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,532
And go where? You can't go anywhere.

143
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,370
I came in here and I could--

144
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,540
I could smell the garage and the bike,
and the smell, it...

145
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,960
It made me very sad for some reason.

146
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:24,547
That shelf's covered in oil.
You're gonna get your ass covered in oil.

147
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,674
Jesus, what a day.

148
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:27,857
Bad?

149
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:30,428
No, just work.

150
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,722
I had some bad news, nothing compared to...

151
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,182
everything.

152
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,642
I really was just gonna take a
selfie, by the way.

153
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:39,061
By the way, just so you know,
in case you were worried.

154
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,730
Oh, just-- Just a little game.

155
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,066
Or a rehearsal.

156
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:49,238
You know, I'm not... Please don't
think I'm looking for anything.

157
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,741
- Any emotion.
- Maria just called and said she loves me.

158
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:52,783
- What?
- I know.

159
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:56,078
Secrets coming out all over the place.
You have the key to get back in?

160
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:56,996
No.

161
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,748
I'll leave the door open for you.

162
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,661
What's wrong?

163
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:30,363
You playing with hoses and exhausts and
we carry on as if everything was normal.

164
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:35,993
I'm not normal lately, I know that.

165
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,163
I haven't been sleeping

166
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:41,348
at all.

167
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,920
I mean, I've never been normal,
but... I used to be quite proud of it.

168
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,103
Now I just...

169
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,548
- Just what?
- I don't know.

170
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,969
Now I'm just acutely aware
of the inconvenience it causes.

171
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:56,722
My superanalysis of every grain of sand.

172
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:58,615
Every word.

173
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,270
Being locked up is making it worse.

174
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,107
We have to find some way
of getting through this separately.

175
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,359
We're only together
because we're in the same house.

176
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:12,071
We can sort of move around each
other until we're free.

177
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,573
- What? What is it?
- No, nothing.

178
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,659
Good night.

179
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,661
There's a bit of Christmas decoration.

180
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,413
It's been there since Christmas.

181
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,709
My therapist says I should try to
tolerate it, to use it as a test.

182
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,004
Up until now I've been able to live with it
as a test to prove my progress.

183
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,756
Well, fuck progress.
Why don't you take it down?

184
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,466
- These tests--
- My therapist says I--

185
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,650
Fuck the therapist.

186
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,344
- Paxton--
- Well, you almost did.

187
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:38,389
Grow up. Take it down.
If it bothers you, take it down.

188
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,641
Christmas is not exactly
a great memory, anyway.

189
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:43,227
Christmas is not a great memory,
I agree with you.

190
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,564
It was the beginning of the end for us.

191
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,524
That was way before Christmas for me.

192
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,585
Sorry.

193
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,781
Why do people think honesty is good?

194
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,746
What are you doing about therapy, anyway?

195
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,789
I'm doing it on Zoom.

196
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:06,375
My therapist has antlers on his wall.

197
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,419
These are extraordinary
circumstances, Paxton.

198
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,881
You can't live with a woman who's
dumped you and tinsel on the ceiling.

199
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,550
- Have we decided to laugh about all this?
- Why not?

200
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,178
There's nothing else we can do there.
Do you want a chair?

201
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,154
Sure.

202
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,580
Bravo.

203
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:29,899
Fuck!

204
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,192
- Hang on.
- That's better.

205
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,285
You know,
when I saw you in the garage, I thought...

206
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:46,290
was it really me on the back
of your bike all those years ago?

207
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,683
Yeah, it was you.

208
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,421
Hanging on and screaming.

209
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,259
Well, that's what I'm doing now,
hanging on and screaming,

210
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:58,302
but you can't hear me.

211
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,012
Nobody can. Anyway, good night.

212
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,765
Screaming about what?

213
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,226
What are you screaming about?

214
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,978
I'm the one that's screaming!

215
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,095
Hello, stranger.

216
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,225
Hi.

217
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,627
How are you?

218
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,422
Terrible, you?

219
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,272
Awful.

220
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,097
Hello.

221
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,017
Does anyone here
on our lovely Portland Street prison

222
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,519
want to hear a little poem?

223
00:12:49,562 --> 00:12:50,813
I read a lot of poetry.

224
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:53,858
And I've read even more lately
'cause I can't sleep.

225
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,821
It's actually a nice way to discover that you're
not the only human being on Earth who's fucked up.

226
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,239
Paxton!

227
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:02,992
What the fuck are you doing?

228
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,619
I'm entertaining our fellow inmates.

229
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,622
This poem is called "Stand Up!"

230
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,375
It's by D. H. Lawrence, by the way.

231
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,794
By the way, just so you know,
in case you were worried.

232
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,173
All right, here goes.

233
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,343
<i>Stand up, but not for Jesus!</i>

234
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,679
<i>It's a little late for that.</i>

235
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,390
<i>Stand up for justice and a jolly life.</i>

236
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,157
<i>I'll hold your hat.</i>

237
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:32,688
<i>Stand up, stand up for justice,
Ye swindled little blokes!</i>

238
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:37,818
<i>Stand up and do some punching,
Give 'em a few hard pokes.</i>

239
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:39,737
<i>Stand up for a new arrangement</i>

240
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:43,282
<i>For a chance of life all round</i>

241
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,702
<i>For freedom, and the fun of living</i>

242
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,955
<i>Break in, and hold the ground!</i>

243
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:55,893
Thank you.

244
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,922
Well, sorry if I woke you.

245
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,591
But I am going slightly mad lately.

246
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,136
My advice to, uh, to everyone

247
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,057
is to use these strange times
we're all going through

248
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,143
to steal all the things
that you think life owes you.

249
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:14,355
- Go to sleep, you bloody tosser!
- Yeah, well, if I could, I would.

250
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,065
Hey, let him be, mate!

251
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,692
And if I come across any other good poems,
I'll share it.

252
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,069
Yeah, we love it!

253
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,155
- Good night, Portland Street.
- Good night, mate!

254
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:24,756
Thank you!

255
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,799
God, please let me sleep.

256
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,142
There's so many.

257
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,812
- What are you laughing at?
- Don't know.

258
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,439
- There's so many poppies.
- Let's pick.

259
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,233
- Lily! I'm going.
- Shh!

260
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,695
- Stop making so much noise.
- You're being so noisy, I swear.

261
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,697
What the fuck are you doing in my garden?

262
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,784
We weren't, like, robbing you.
We were just gathering these.

263
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,327
They're just poppies.

264
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,662
The bulbs of poppies.

265
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,789
All the dealers
in our estate have been arrested

266
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,542
because they're the only people
out on the streets, isn't it?

267
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,421
With these poppy bulbs,
you can make this, um, sort of opium.

268
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,715
You just slit the skins
and juice comes out.

269
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,009
How'd you know they were here?

270
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:29,179
Well, we live in that tower block up there,
bruv. Friend of ours has a telescope.

271
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,556
He's into stars and shit.

272
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,975
We've been looking down
on houses for a laugh.

273
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:36,312
Looking through windows and that.
Then we saw these growing in your garden.

274
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,231
What the fuck are they all doing
growing in my garden?

275
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:42,067
I think hippies used to squat
in these houses in the '70s.

276
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,486
- Didn't they grow them and they just went wild?
- Yeah.

277
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,323
- How do you refine the juice?
- You don't.

278
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,783
You just drip it onto tobacco
and then smoke it.

279
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,786
Or you can mix it with Coca-Cola
if you want and drink it.

280
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,955
Yeah, well, I don't smoke anymore.

281
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,125
Or drink Coca-Cola or do drugs of any kind.

282
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,713
But back in the bad old days,
I did smoke quite a lot of heroin.

283
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,507
This is not as strong as heroin.

284
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:06,842
It's quite a gentle hit.

285
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:08,719
It's organic, bruv.

286
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,137
- Organic?
- Yeah.

287
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,890
That would explain the hedgehog.

288
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:18,228
There's a hedgehog in this garden
who's unusually friendly and relaxed.

289
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,152
Would a very small amount

290
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,030
help you sleep, do you think?

291
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:31,700
You'll sleep like a baby.
It smooths everything out.

292
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,369
There's no mean voices in the night.

293
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,871
No mean voices in the night.
That would be nice.

294
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,389
Well, well, well.

295
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,332
Paxton!

296
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:42,146
Paxton, for fuck's sake!

297
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,561
Hey, Toby.

298
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,131
- Oh.
- Hey, how's the cough?

299
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,426
A bit better, I think. How are you?

300
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,427
I had it, I think.

301
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,053
But it's passed, I hope.

302
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,737
It's like a Valkyrie.

303
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:18,698
A what?

304
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:23,187
It's a Viking spirit who, before battles,
decides who will live and who will die.

305
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:24,954
Valkyries...

306
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,901
uh, make their choices with no reason.

307
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,487
No morality, no good or bad. It--

308
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,490
It's so unfair
how some people get so sick and some don't.

309
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,159
Toby, you're back. How are you?

310
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,244
Gangster, thank you.

311
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:40,428
Hello.

312
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,096
Donald.

313
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,458
You got a tie on.

314
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,043
It's one of my father's old ones.

315
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,755
I've become nostalgic
for old-fashioned formality.

316
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,925
On these Zoom things,
I always imagine every man has an erection.

317
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:58,222
- Donald, is that your house?
- Uh, no. I'm at my mother's.

318
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,891
Uh, Anthony threw me out.

319
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,188
That's not allowed, is it?

320
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,315
Ah, we had an awful night.

321
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,234
Everything came out.

322
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,613
We found out we hate each other, so...

323
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:15,796
Hi!

324
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,909
Uh-- Melissa, hey, how is Italy?

325
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,160
I hear it's bad there.

326
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,371
No, I'm in Sweden.

327
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,722
What?

328
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,140
Look.

329
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,627
You can go to bars here.

330
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,296
Mm. Is anybody obeying the rules?

331
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,646
After ten years sober,
that was fucking smart.

332
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,277
Wait, who are we waiting for?

333
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,362
Timothy, I think.

334
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,155
Oh, is Timothy okay?

335
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,032
Why wouldn't he be?

336
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,702
Well, he's got an
underlying health condition.

337
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,786
Do you know which one?

338
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,997
No. He just seems like the sort of person

339
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,374
who'd have an underlying health condition
of some sort.

340
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,710
Shall we just start without Timothy?

341
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:13,505
By the way, I am also wearing shoes.

342
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:17,885
Seriously, we should start. I have
something to say. Something important.

343
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,431
Oh, um, hang on, it's--

344
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,725
Oh, it's a message from Timothy. Uh...

345
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,160
God.

346
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:29,537
Has he got it?

347
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,357
"Dear Linda, as of 9 a.m. this morning,

348
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:35,235
I am resigning my position
at Miracore Media with immediate effect.

349
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,614
I have had time alone to think and I
have realized that what this company does

350
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:41,950
is self-indulgent media bullshit supporting
corrosive international capitalism

351
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,134
around the world.

352
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,621
We should be using our creativity
to save the planet,

353
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,124
not sell handbags
to the wives of fascist dictators.

354
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,307
Yours in isolation,

355
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,085
Timothy."

356
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:53,269
Just been...

357
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,924
watching David Attenborough documentaries,
I imagine.

358
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:58,383
He snapped.

359
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,803
Okay, so there's no need to wait
for Timothy. Let's get this done.

360
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,681
Sounds awfully grave, Linda.

361
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,643
- Daddy? Can we play cars?
- Shh. Daddy's on a call.

362
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,269
Just, um-- Just not now.

363
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,942
Yesterday, I had a very long Zoom call
with head office in Chicago.

364
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,069
All of the continents were represented.

365
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,321
And it seems that all over the world,

366
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,407
the company is facing the same issues
at this difficult time.

367
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,119
As CEO of Miracore U.K., it is my...

368
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,624
unfortunate duty to let you know

369
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:34,211
that there will be some furloughing
of employees across the board...

370
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:39,132
and also a number of compulsory
redundancies effective from today.

371
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,052
I assume the, uh...

372
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,683
Inuit system of leaving the old
on the ice will be in play.

373
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,268
Donald, please don't jump to conclusions.

374
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,853
Linda, what do you mean?

375
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:53,981
In normal times,
I would have gathered everyone

376
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,149
- into a room and I--
<i>- Everyone?</i>

377
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,490
Everyone on this Zoom call is on this call

378
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,451
because all of your positions
have been deemed no longer sustainable.

379
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,705
As of today, your contracts of employment
with Miracore will be terminated.

380
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,251
Okay.

381
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:18,338
I'm glad I'm home.
I'm going to feed the fucking chickens.

382
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,509
This is really bad, Linda.
How do you sleep?

383
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,111
Hello?

384
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,863
Hello.

385
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,767
Look at my dinosaur.

386
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:36,831
<i>Daddy.</i>

387
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,862
Malcolm, I thought being furloughed
meant that the government pays your wages

388
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,071
but you don't do any work.

389
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,489
<i>Yeah, it does.</i>

390
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,367
<i>But Covid makes everything different.
It's so sad.</i>

391
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:48,577
<i>So sad.</i>

392
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,039
<i>All of this is impacting
on everyone in my pastoral care.</i>

393
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:55,876
Yeah, but I'm not in your pastoral
care, right? I work for you.

394
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:59,921
And all I wanna know is, if I am
furloughed, why are you asking me to work?

395
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,299
- It's illegal, isn't it?
<i>- I'm a Christian man.</i>

396
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,176
We all know that you are a Christian man.

397
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,094
<i>You say it like I ram it down your throats.</i>

398
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,013
<i>I do not ram it down your fucking throat.</i>

399
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,682
Malcolm, just tell me,
what is it you want me to do?

400
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,642
<i>We have a situation, Paxton.</i>

401
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,978
I am leaving this call
unless you tell me, all right?

402
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:17,981
- I sat through your prayer.
<i>- I begin every FaceTime with a prayer.</i>

403
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,067
<i>My choice, right? I'm the boss.</i>

404
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,359
Yeah, you are the boss.

405
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,445
So, what do you want me to do, boss?

406
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:26,823
<i>Due to lockdown, all the major department
stores in the West End are closing.</i>

407
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,910
<i>B2B Pro Freight Services
are among several freight companies</i>

408
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:33,121
<i>which have been asked
to transport valuable retail items</i>

409
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,664
<i>from the West End outlets</i>

410
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,626
<i>to secure storage facilities
in shitholes like Dagenham.</i>

411
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,963
<i>The fabric, Paxton, of our society is torn.
You see that.</i>

412
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,632
<i>Fears of rioting and looting.</i>

413
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:44,815
<i>Pestilence.</i>

414
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,343
<i>Apocalyptic words.</i>

415
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,262
I'm giving you ten seconds to tell me
what it is you want me to do.

416
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,640
<i>- Because of the crisis, we need drivers.</i>
- Ten, nine...

417
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,308
<i>- Drivers like you.</i>
- ...eight, seven...

418
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:56,228
<i>- Stores will only allow goods to be transported...</i>
- ...six, five...

419
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:59,606
<i>- ...by drivers who do not have criminal records.</i>
- ...four, three, two--

420
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,665
<i>I'll repeat.</i>

421
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:06,571
<i>B2B Pro Freight Services have urgent
need for drivers registered to us</i>

422
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,324
<i>who do not have criminal records.</i>

423
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,701
So why are you talking to me?

424
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:16,039
<i>I've contracts to carry valuables
from 16 department stores across London.</i>

425
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:18,625
<i>They all want everything out
in the next four days.</i>

426
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,752
<i>And I only have two fucking drivers.</i>

427
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,087
So, what's your solution?

428
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,270
<i>Deception.</i>

429
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,131
<i>Forgiveness.</i>

430
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,314
<i>Redemption.</i>

431
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,134
<i>- Bunce.</i>
- Fuck is Bunce?

432
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,553
<i>Old East End word for cash, Paxton.</i>

433
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,263
<i>In return for grand deception.</i>

434
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:34,099
<i>Facilitated by my forgiveness
and your redemption.</i>

435
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,767
Get there, Malcolm, get there.

436
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:40,105
<i>I've printed off an ID with a security level
A-2, clean, with your photo on it and a name.</i>

437
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,148
<i>It's not your name.</i>

438
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:43,900
<i>I can't officially take you off furlough
and give you this work,</i>

439
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,527
<i>because you used to be a bike slag.</i>

440
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,655
<i>I'll have to pretend you're someone else
and pay you in cash.</i>

441
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:51,199
<i>You've worked for this company
as a driver for seven years,</i>

442
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,659
<i>I've never had a complaint.</i>

443
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:57,330
<i>You've only driven low-value packages, but
I believe you are a man who can be trusted.</i>

444
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:00,891
Yeah, I am.

445
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,962
Yeah, I can be trusted.

446
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,841
- What happened was a long time ago.
<i>- I don't wanna know.</i>

447
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,509
No, it was biker versus biker.

448
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,554
<i>The Lord forgives.
B2B Pro Freight Services forgives.</i>

449
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:16,266
If it wasn't for the convictions from that
night, my life would be radically different.

450
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,559
<i>Two hundred a day in cash.</i>

451
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:20,604
I don't care about the cash.
I wanna make a deal with you, Malcolm.

452
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,982
I will do this on the condition
that when this is all over,

453
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,193
you will consider me
for a clerical position.

454
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:29,529
My entire life has been fucked up
because of things I did on one night.

455
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,782
All right? My wife-- My
wife has grown out of me

456
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,744
because I am still Mr. Fuck-All
behind the wheel of a van,

457
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,329
but I am not stupid.

458
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:38,512
I read poetry.

459
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,664
I could be someone.

460
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:43,460
<i>I have another call. It's a very busy time.
The West End's going mad. Will you do it?</i>

461
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,670
All right, if I do this for you, Malcolm,

462
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:49,799
I want you to practice what you preach,
about forgiveness

463
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,468
and lost sheep and redemption,

464
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,845
all of it, and give me a chance
to come off the road.

465
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,139
<i>Everything is possible, Paxton.
God bless you.</i>

466
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,475
<i>Selfridges Thursday, Harvey Nichols Friday,</i>

467
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,726
<i>- Harrods on Saturday.</i>
- Yeah.

468
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,395
<i>I will e-mail you a full itinerary
and your new identity.</i>

469
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,774
Okay, okay,
and after, after Harrods on Saturday...

470
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:07,400
<i>God bless you, Paxton.</i>

471
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,674
Shit.

472
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,125
<i>Hey, Linda.</i>

473
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,211
<i>How's lockdown?</i>

474
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:53,921
It's pretty bad.

475
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,048
How's Chicago?

476
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,036
<i>I'm in Vermont.
I moved the family out to Vermont.</i>

477
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:01,762
<i>We're all here,</i>

478
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,639
<i>crazy happy.</i>

479
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:07,836
<i>Kids make a lot of noise,
so I got these, uh, new AirPods Pro.</i>

480
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:11,214
<i>Noise-canceling. They work.
Like, you literally can't hear anything.</i>

481
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,049
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- No, I don't have those.

482
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:17,721
<i>I can see in your face
that you spoke to the guys at Events</i>

483
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,222
<i>and delivered the update.</i>

484
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,683
Update? Yeah. Yeah, I updated them.

485
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,228
<i>Did you read them my message?</i>

486
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:28,606
The stuff about the "Miracore family"?

487
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,359
No. I didn't think that would translate.

488
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,946
Linda, I wrote that message from the heart.

489
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,448
I really meant what I said.

490
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:39,701
And I just-- I can't believe
you didn't read it out to them.

491
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,537
I didn't think it was appropriate
to say that Miracore is a family

492
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,581
and there comes a time
in every family's life

493
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:47,208
when it's best
if some family members fly the nest.

494
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,546
- Why is that not appropriate?
- They're not flying the nest, are they?

495
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:52,729
They're being...

496
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,633
thrown out of the nest
into the long grass under the tree.

497
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,844
There's no tree in-- What tree?

498
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,027
It's your nest, Guy.

499
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:02,015
You came up with the analogy of the nest,
so there has to be a tree.

500
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,600
Do you have a temperature, Linda?

501
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,521
Um, there are two big events
which were set up when lockdown began.

502
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,705
One was at Westfield.

503
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,317
The other one was the Eve Schwarz
store takeover at Harrods.

504
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,570
- Westfield and Harrods have closed their door.
<i>- I love Harrods.</i>

505
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,990
Yeah, I love Harrods too. I worked there
five years, the happiest of my life.

506
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,785
Anyway, the launch of Eve Schwarz
collection was gonna be huge,

507
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,412
so I chose Harrods
because of its size and level of security.

508
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:27,374
You chose? I thought Melissa
was head of Events Strategy.

509
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:31,628
Yeah, well, sometimes I questioned
her choi-- Yeah, it doesn't matter.

510
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,172
You've been carrying
that department a long time.

511
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:38,009
Yeah, well, they were family, weren't they?
That's what you do with family.

512
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,929
You carry them until you get a direction
from Chicago to drop them,

513
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,430
and then you dutifully drop them.

514
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,516
Anyway, at Harrods
we have five million dollars'

515
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,393
worth of jewelry, clothing and accessories

516
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:49,979
already installed for the catwalk and
store takeover under Miracore liability.

517
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:53,358
That includes the Harris diamond, which
was to be the centerpiece of the show.

518
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,861
The Harris diamond
is under our insurance liability?

519
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:02,367
It's, um... It's safe in the
Harrods secure vault, but yes.

520
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,124
I suggested to the people
at Eve Schwarz that we put everything

521
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:12,377
into Harrods' secure storage
as quickly as possible until this, um...

522
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,255
Uh, until this situation is ended.

523
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:18,049
But we have a problem with insurance,
you see, that...

524
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:25,723
So Eve Schwarz's insurance policy
means that they're not allowed

525
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,643
to store their merchandise
except under their corporate supervision,

526
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:32,897
so the merchandise will have to be taken
out of the store in secure transportation.

527
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,401
Anyway, the stores are
allocating for collection.

528
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,987
We have Westfield on Friday,
Harrods on Saturday.

529
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,240
And then we discuss your
role and your salary.

530
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,868
Gonna be a lot of new responsibilities.

531
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:46,635
<i>Things are changing.</i>

532
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:48,303
That's...

533
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,707
excellent news, thank you.

534
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,959
Say hello to London.

535
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,253
- Enjoy Vermont.
<i>- You bet.</i>

536
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:58,756
<i>Oh, gee.</i>

537
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,216
<i>Whoa-- Oh, fuck.</i>

538
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,400
<i>Quinn.</i>

539
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:15,023
I'm going to the land of the walking dead
to buy milk. Do we need anything else?

540
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:20,862
I say the word "we" without any attempt
to suggest a unified entity,

541
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:24,407
but there's no point in us both going
separately to get our own provisions.

542
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,243
It's getting rough out there.

543
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:30,622
And increasingly, I think, people like me
who have spent time in real prison

544
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,415
are thriving in this new reality.

545
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,792
You know what, Paxton, fuck it. Come in!

546
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,381
All right, Paxton, here it is.
In addition to milk...

547
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:42,842
I need cigarettes.

548
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:46,387
What?

549
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,348
I was trying to hide
that I'm smoking again,

550
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:51,100
but since we're no longer together,
it doesn't matter, does it?

551
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,061
You are smoking?

552
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,980
Yes, I plan to carry on
just until this thing is over.

553
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,274
It's magnificent, actually.

554
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,777
And when did you start smoking again?

555
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:02,820
Just before Christmas.

556
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:04,755
Why?

557
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,867
I started smoking again
when I went to Paris.

558
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,744
You went to Paris?

559
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,996
I went to Paris.
I didn't tell you I went to Paris.

560
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,999
- Michael Essien invited me to Paris and I went.
- Okay.

561
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:19,087
My therapist identifies these moments
as "confession avalanche."

562
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,550
Who the fuck is Michael Essien?

563
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:26,386
He's the founder of Miracore,
seventh wealthiest man in Germany.

564
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,972
- And you went to Paris with him?
- Not quite.

565
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,891
He invited the CEOs
from six countries to come to Paris

566
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,851
for his 60th birthday celebration.

567
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:36,229
You mind if I light this thing?
I've put it out twice--

568
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:39,065
You know what, actually,
it's my choice and I'm not even asking.

569
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,657
When I got to the hotel,
there was this banqueting suite

570
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,576
and I met the six other CEOs just like me.

571
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,620
Only I had just become a CEO,
so I didn't realize exactly who I was

572
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,206
until I saw the other CEOs,
and then, I was like:

573
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,209
So that's who I am now."

574
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,211
We sat around this table
drinking champagne.

575
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,839
And the conversation
was lots of little voices saying, "Yes,"

576
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,340
and one big voice saying, "Good."

577
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,425
Michael Essien's voice.

578
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:08,261
And then the big voice said
"emerging markets," and I--

579
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,098
Know how sometimes when people say
something abstract, I actually see it?

580
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:14,684
We did smoke a lot of weed
in the bad old days.

581
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,854
When he said "emerging
markets," I saw this...

582
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:21,399
thing, this shape,

583
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,986
appearing from under the table
and swimming around our legs,

584
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,905
and I think I actually did have
a temperature that night.

585
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:31,701
But anyway, then he said
"cigarettes and pharmaceuticals,"

586
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,954
and I drank some champagne,
and someone said "facilitators,"

587
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,249
that is, people who persuade governments
that products are safe and okay.

588
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:42,503
And the big voice said that facilitators
were now a huge link in the chain,

589
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:46,007
and I saw this big chain dripping seaweed.

590
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,718
And then the big voice raised a toast
to corruption,

591
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,137
and everybody laughed ironically,
including me.

592
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,320
Paxton, look at me.

593
00:32:56,351 --> 00:33:00,104
And this thing, this shape,
it was swimming around my fucking legs.

594
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:04,567
And then the big voice said emerging markets were
now some big percentage of Miracore's profits

595
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,986
and so there would have to
be rationalization in Europe,

596
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,156
and I drank some water because I felt sick
but also like I might pass out.

597
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:13,451
Then the waiter said, "Brandy?"
so I said, "Yes." And so...

598
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:18,790
the rationalization was planned right there
at that table in Paris before Christmas,

599
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:21,459
and the nice people that
I fired earlier today?

600
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:24,045
They weren't fired because of a virus,
like I told them.

601
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,004
That was a lie.

602
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,715
They were fired because of this thing,

603
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,718
this shape that swam with me
all the way back to my room,

604
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:34,222
and then to get rid of it,
I used a disgusting glass swan

605
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:36,391
to smash a full-length mirror.

606
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:40,478
Rather than walk across broken glass all night, I
decided to take the last train home to London.

607
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:43,981
When I got to the Gare du Nord station,
a homeless woman asked me for a cigarette.

608
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,526
I told her I didn't smoke,
but I decided to buy her a pack

609
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,195
because I thought that some
kindness might make me feel better

610
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,378
about what I had become.

611
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,991
And when she lit her cigarette,
I decided to have a cigarette too.

612
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:58,955
And when I drew in the smoke,
the thing stopped swimming.

613
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:02,709
So I sat down on a bench...

614
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,169
and I waited for my train.

615
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:09,340
And that is why I started to smoke again.

616
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,402
But...

617
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:17,181
to complete the answer
to your original question,

618
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:20,601
in addition to milk and cigarettes,
we need bread.

619
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,479
And fucking wine.

620
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:27,624
God.

621
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:29,584
God what?

622
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,321
It sounds like you did have a temperature.

623
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:34,407
They say this thing was around
before Christmas.

624
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,367
Paxton, no, it's not about the virus.

625
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:40,371
It's about me realizing who I am
and what I do for a living.

626
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:46,002
Although a complete reexamination of one's
life does seem to be a Covid side effect.

627
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,212
- You smashed a mirror?
- Yeah.

628
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:49,756
Yeah, because I was in it.

629
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,924
I also smashed a champagne bottle,
some glasses,

630
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:55,428
and I was about to smash a glass horse
and jockey, but then I decided to keep it.

631
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,263
But then I left it on the fucking train.

632
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:00,725
Basically, I went
what you used to call "full Viking."

633
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:05,062
In fact, when I broke the mirror and I
saw my furious face in the cracked glass,

634
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,063
I thought of you.

635
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:07,857
Oh, that's very sweet, thank you.

636
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,196
Why didn't you tell me?

637
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,825
It was the onset of winter.

638
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,285
Our winter.

639
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,038
And anyway, I didn't tell anybody,

640
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,041
because if you don't tell anybody,
then it didn't happen.

641
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,503
- Did you get a bill for the mirror?
- Paxton.

642
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:32,590
Paxton, fuck the mirror. Fuck the--
It's not about the mirror. It's about--

643
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:40,723
Previously, at this point...

644
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,059
I would've hugged you.

645
00:35:43,142 --> 00:35:44,352
No, really, there's no need.

646
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:50,149
And anyway, you're going shopping,
so, uh, milk, bread, wine, cigarettes.

647
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:54,695
- And probably eggs.
- I'm gonna put white flour on the list.

648
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:55,905
I'm gonna make bread.

649
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,088
Please don't.

650
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:58,673
You know...

651
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:02,370
what you just said,
you know, wasn't a confession.

652
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:03,871
I didn't say it was a confession.

653
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:07,250
- 'Cause you didn't do anything wrong.
- Hey, I said, no, it was an explanation.

654
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,668
You did everything right.

655
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,088
You wanna hear a confession?

656
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:15,508
This morning,
I overslept because last night...

657
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,109
I took opium.

658
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,237
Yes.

659
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,391
Yes.

660
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:25,268
Much worse than your cigarettes.

661
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:29,146
I licked opium
off little green bulbs from the garden.

662
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,275
Yes, I did. Our garden is full of heroin.

663
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,735
Beyond the washing line,
it's like the Helmand Province.

664
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:37,029
After ten years, Paxton?

665
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,948
Well, smoking isn't so great either.

666
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:41,492
You know,
and I've had some setbacks lately.

667
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,537
Yeah, you know what, Paxton?
That green smoothie I have in the morning?

668
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,956
Since Paris,
there's two shots of vodka in it.

669
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,457
- Just two, but--
- You're lying.

670
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:49,500
No, I'm not.

671
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,836
Not every morning,
but some mornings I do it, I have.

672
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:54,297
You know,
you think I'm so happy and normal.

673
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,841
It's because I keep getting promoted.
People get confused.

674
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,302
I'd never accuse you of
being happy and normal.

675
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:00,636
'Cause I'm not!

676
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,098
All right? I see... concepts.

677
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,474
I should have been an artist.

678
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:09,604
You are unhappy in an outwardly happy
"Let's pretend it's all fine" female way,

679
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:13,941
and I am unhappy in an obviously thwarted,
unfulfilled, castrated male way.

680
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:16,152
No, I can't go down this road again, okay?

681
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:17,403
Just go to the store.

682
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,489
Milk, bread, wine, cigarettes, eggs.

683
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:22,491
Yeah, and fuck you, I'm buying flour.

684
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:24,952
Fine. Wait, do you have a mask?

685
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:30,207
No, I don't have a mask.

686
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:33,544
Well, you have to tie something
around your mouth and nose.

687
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,555
Fuck.

688
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,476
- My old bandanna.
- Hmm.

689
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,395
Yeah, well,
it's no longer a symbol of rebellion.

690
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,939
It's now government advice.

691
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:05,910
You were wearing that
when I met you in Sturgis, South Dakota.

692
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,830
I thought you looked like a desperado.

693
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:13,125
- I was trying to get the dust out of my mouth.
- Don't spoil it.

694
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:19,465
Don't forget the milk and the
eggs, desperado.

695
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,489
Oi! Move forward!

696
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,800
Go ahead, then!

697
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:48,593
Fuck off.

698
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,500
- Wait, how many asses have you got?
- Fuck off.

699
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:44,858
Paxton?

700
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:50,973
Hearing the story about Paris out loud,
it made me think...

701
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:55,061
when lockdown's over,
I'm gonna think about leaving Miracore.

702
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,689
Why are you telling me?

703
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:24,632
You called?

704
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,634
Oh, Lord, who art in Heaven, I beseech you,

705
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:30,137
look favorably upon Paxton and myself
and forgive us the sin of deception

706
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:34,308
<i>which we are jointly about to commit in
pursuit of his ultimate redemption. Amen.</i>

707
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:36,936
Amen.

708
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,897
Every prayer is tailored
to suit the person I'm calling.

709
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,066
Either it's me writing
the words or it's Jesus.

710
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,360
What do you want, Malcolm?

711
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,821
<i>I've got your fake ID sorted.</i>

712
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:49,073
<i>Virginia is delivering the ID card.</i>

713
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,908
<i>I wanted to make sure you'd be in.</i>

714
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,369
You know what, Malcolm? Everybody's in.

715
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:55,079
<i>And I've sent you your new name.</i>

716
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,956
<i>I texted it to you. It's on your phone.</i>

717
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:58,848
Okay.

718
00:40:59,834 --> 00:41:03,170
A new name for the beginning of a new life.

719
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,757
And my new name is...

720
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:12,304
Edgar Allen Poe.

721
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:13,488
<i>Yeah.</i>

722
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:17,101
Yeah. Uh...

723
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:22,148
- Malcolm, I obviously can't use this name.
<i>- Why not?</i>

724
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,942
I'm hoping this is a joke,
but I know you, so it's probably not.

725
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:26,125
<i>What joke?</i>

726
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:28,445
Okay.

727
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:32,074
Edgar Allan Poe
is the name of a famous, like, a...

728
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:35,369
Like, a very famous
American novelist and poet.

729
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:36,552
Never heard of him.

730
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:42,960
Well, I assure you Edgar Allan Poe
is actually a very famous American writer

731
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,170
I'm actually very fond of.

732
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:47,381
<i>It was me that came up with "Edgar."
It's my granddad's name.</i>

733
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,634
- So who came up with the "Allen Poe" part?
<i>- Martin in Dispatch.</i>

734
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:51,818
Fuck.

735
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:54,597
Martin in Dispatch hates me.

736
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,267
He's deliberately suggested this
to make my life strange and unbearable.

737
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,352
<i>Well, the card's already been laminated.</i>

738
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:04,440
Malcolm, I can't go into expensive department
stores in the West End, all right,

739
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:08,736
and expect them to entrust me
with valuable clothing and jewelry

740
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:12,114
and tell them that my name
is Edgar Allen fucking Poe!

741
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:14,617
If he's so famous,
how come I've never heard of him?

742
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,244
- 'Cause you don't read books!
- I read the good book.

743
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,413
He's not in the Bible, obviously.
He's American.

744
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:23,375
Anybody here ever heard of a writer
called Edgar Allan Poe?

745
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:25,294
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
<i>- No?</i>

746
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:26,921
<i>No one. There you go.</i>

747
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,548
I know there's no one there.
They're all working from home.

748
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:32,927
<i>- Martin's here.</i>
- This was his idea!

749
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,262
Well, the card's already been laminated.

750
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:40,392
All right, look, I grant you
that 90% of the security guards

751
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:44,063
working the night shift in the West End
would not have heard of Edgar Allan Poe.

752
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:45,439
<i>Basically dealing with robots.</i>

753
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,274
But I'm an unlucky person.

754
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,277
Fate has a way
of doing these little experiments on me.

755
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,862
<i>Card's already laminated</i>

756
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:54,823
<i>and Martin has a new name badge
made for your uniform.</i>

757
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:56,200
<i>It's all in the envelope.</i>

758
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:58,494
By some chance, choosing the name

759
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:02,081
of a gloomy,
introspective peddler of darkness

760
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:05,209
is actually quite appropriate
to my character, but please...

761
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:09,338
just get me a new card
under a different name.

762
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:12,925
<i>The robots don't give a fuck about
the name. They just look at the photo.</i>

763
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:16,887
<i>You are due at Selfridges' Loading Bay B
at 1800 hours tonight.</i>

764
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,847
<i>Wear your uniform with your name tag.</i>

765
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:20,391
<i>- Flash your ID.</i>
- I...

766
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:23,519
<i>Look, if you want to back out, say so now.</i>

767
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:25,813
I can't get into trouble again.

768
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:30,401
This could be construed
as, uh, deception and attempted robbery.

769
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:31,819
<i>You counted me down.</i>

770
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:34,196
I'll count you down, you fucker.

771
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,325
Five, four, three, two...

772
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:40,411
Fuck. All right, I'll do it.

773
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:41,594
Good.

774
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:43,497
Details are on the text.

775
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:45,499
God bless you, Paxton.

776
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:01,515
No need to sign. I know him.

777
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:03,282
You his other half?

778
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:05,394
Yes, I am.

779
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:07,354
He's so dry, isn't he?

780
00:44:07,438 --> 00:44:08,314
Yes, he is.

781
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,774
Hello, Paxton.

782
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:13,235
I was just saying you're very funny.

783
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:14,862
Yes, I am, I'm hilarious.

784
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:18,282
We think he's too clever
to be driving vans.

785
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,743
We don't know why he
doesn't get a better job.

786
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:21,827
Oh, that's easy.

787
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,010
It's 'cause ten years ago

788
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:26,081
I beat a man senseless
in a bikers' roadhouse in Watford.

789
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:26,999
See?

790
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,376
He's always saying silly things.

791
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,045
He's so dry.

792
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:33,130
Give my regards to Martin,
would you, Virginia?

793
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,591
Tell him this won't be forgotten.

794
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:38,594
Okay. See you when the madness is over.

795
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:41,263
Yeah, well, for some of us,
the madness never ends.

796
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,939
Never forget,
the man you beat senseless deserved it.

797
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:53,067
Please don't talk about
people deserving things.

798
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,778
If it wasn't for you,
a man called Archie Bruce would be dead.

799
00:44:55,861 --> 00:45:00,282
- You'll be talking about justice next.
- I know that you had a bad break.

800
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:02,201
- But going forward--
- "Going forward"?

801
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:03,952
When lockdown is over and we are apart,

802
00:45:04,036 --> 00:45:06,246
you have to stop believing
that fate is against you.

803
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,458
You have to stop believing
the name Paxton is a precursor of doom.

804
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,710
Well, my name isn't Paxton.

805
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:15,396
Yeah.

806
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:35,526
You can't go through with this.
You're gonna get caught.

807
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,445
If you're doing it for cash,
I'll give you the cash.

808
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:39,822
I'm not doing it for the cash.

809
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:42,991
I'm doing it for the opportunity
to have a better life.

810
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:44,952
But why am I telling you?

811
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:54,352
Fuck.

812
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:35,309
Fuck them.

813
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:41,550
<i>And Linda seemed kind of detached
from the whole thing.</i>

814
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,318
Detached?

815
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,139
- Hi, Linda.
- We were talking about you.

816
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,975
We were saying that we love
that you're always so professional.

817
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,685
Sorry, detached from what whole thing?

818
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:54,521
I was saying you handled
the situation with Events

819
00:46:54,605 --> 00:46:57,316
without too much feeling
getting in the way.

820
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,750
You fired them well.

821
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,070
<i>I did.</i>

822
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:04,072
Thank you. Good.

823
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,341
Linda?

824
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:09,453
Is that a glass of wine?

825
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:10,913
Oh, yes, yeah, it is.

826
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:14,541
Well... it says wine on the label,
but it tastes like something

827
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,376
used to clean something off of a surface.

828
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,170
- Paxton chose it.
- Who's Paxton?

829
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,839
Mm. Anyway, we have a problem.

830
00:47:20,923 --> 00:47:22,023
So shall we get on?

831
00:47:29,181 --> 00:47:30,557
Hello, Martin.

832
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,450
Hello, Edgar.

833
00:47:33,227 --> 00:47:36,522
You know, from my observation of you
since I joined the company,

834
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:37,981
you represent the longest

835
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:41,193
and most well-managed
nervous breakdown in history.

836
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:44,238
Why don't you go somewhere warm
and count your grievances?

837
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:46,073
I've disinfected the van for you.

838
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,283
Everything you need is in there.

839
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:53,830
You know, when Malcolm told me he was
giving you an A-2 security clearance,

840
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:55,165
I advised him against it.

841
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:59,962
B2B normally keep lowlifes like you
away from high-value cargo for a reason.

842
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:00,879
Temptation.

843
00:48:00,963 --> 00:48:04,258
You forgot to put the keys to the van
inside the envelope, Martin.

844
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,928
I read your human-resources profile.

845
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:11,431
My personal record is
meant to be confidential.

846
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,394
But for your personal record,
Martin, I'm a different person now.

847
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:18,021
- Give me the fucking keys.
- Perhaps Malcolm didn't tell you.

848
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:22,818
The estimated value of tonight's cargo
out of Selfridges is 50,000 pounds.

849
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:26,029
The value of your collection
from Harvey Nichols on Friday

850
00:48:26,113 --> 00:48:27,823
is just under 100,000 pounds.

851
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:31,034
But on Saturday night,
when you go to Harrods,

852
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:34,496
you'll be driving away from the world's
most glamorous department store

853
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,792
with jewelry and accessories in your
van worth over three million pounds.

854
00:48:39,585 --> 00:48:40,794
Now think on this.

855
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:42,462
You'll be wearing a mask and gloves.

856
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:46,049
You'll be using a false identity.
Outside, the streets will be empty.

857
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:49,553
Store security on quarter staff
with big holes caused by absences.

858
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:53,181
What more could a lowlife need
to pull off the perfect robbery?

859
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:56,310
- You refer to me as "lowlife" one more time...
- You'll what?

860
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:57,769
Revert to type?

861
00:48:57,853 --> 00:48:58,953
Okay, here it goes.

862
00:48:58,979 --> 00:48:59,896
One more time.

863
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,080
Lowlife.

864
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:05,777
You know, Malcolm told me
that if you do okay in the next few nights,

865
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:07,821
he's gonna put you in Customer Services.

866
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:10,032
Going out and meeting clients.

867
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:13,702
Because you're so funny and you're
so dry and you make the girls laugh.

868
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,289
Whereas I've been stuck
in Dispatches for seven and a half years.

869
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:20,375
You have to stop thinking
the whole world's against you, Martin.

870
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:25,604
Do it, Paxton.

871
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:29,217
Take the opportunity
that fate has given you.

872
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:40,854
Exactly how much product
do Eve Schwarz have in Harrods?

873
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:43,690
Approximately three million pounds.
Jewelry and accessories.

874
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:46,193
Harrods wants everything out,
and it's our responsibility.

875
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:48,320
Oh. You're frozen, Linda.

876
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:51,865
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Yeah, I can hear you.</i>

877
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:56,453
It's just your face is frozen
with this look of exasperation.

878
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:00,374
Because someone's gonna have to go
into Harrods

879
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:02,918
and pack the valuables up
and check the inventory

880
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,171
and count everything out, and it's
gonna have to be someone that we trust.

881
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:09,633
Someone who is familiar with the stock
and knows how the Harrods system works.

882
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:12,010
So that means, inevitably,
it's gonna be me, isn't it?

883
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:15,180
Okay, but there's this 'nother
second reason for this call.

884
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:18,475
Michael Essien has decided
he wants to give you a promotion.

885
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:23,522
<i>He wants to bring you home.
Back to New York to run the East Coast.</i>

886
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:28,735
- Wow, God. Um...
- Exciting.

887
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:32,739
An unexpected turn of events
and cheap wine don't pair well together.

888
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:35,784
I'm gonna have to, uh,
really think about this.

889
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,411
Um, all right, good night.

890
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:41,373
- Yeah, thank you, I mean, I think...
<i>- Good night. Linda, it's excit--</i>

891
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:48,630
"A frozen look of exasperation."

892
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:54,803
<i>And that is his second son,
Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach,</i>

893
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,471
<i>and here's his Symphony No. 4.</i>

894
00:51:56,782 --> 00:52:00,285
After our call last night, we became
worried about Paxton's state of mind.

895
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,329
We're worried
that he might implode or explode.

896
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:04,873
<i>He'll probably implode
rather than explode.</i>

897
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:07,626
- What's the difference?
<i>- When you implode, you withdraw.</i>

898
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:09,836
<i>When you explode,
you impose yourself on the world.</i>

899
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,298
David, for example,
when he gets angry, he implodes.

900
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:14,841
When I get angry, I explode.

901
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:17,093
- I can also explode if I have to.
- Rarely.

902
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:20,096
- You've never seen me in business meetings.
- I have, since lockdown.

903
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,683
<i>- You've heard me. You haven't seen me.
- Okay. I haven't heard you explode.</i>

904
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:27,521
<i>I've actually been very surprised
about how submissive you are in meetings.</i>

905
00:52:27,604 --> 00:52:29,231
<i>- Submissive?
- You're the boss, David.</i>

906
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:30,565
<i>You should act like the boss.</i>

907
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:33,819
Anyway, just to reassure
you, Paxton's okay.

908
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:36,071
In fact, Paxton may be getting a promotion.

909
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:38,657
Linda, are you-- Are you drinking alone?

910
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,576
No, I've got three firemen
waiting for me in the kitchen.

911
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,579
Since lockdown,
David has been drinking so much more.

912
00:52:44,663 --> 00:52:47,541
Yes. David, isn't it wonderful?

913
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,710
We now keep a record. We count the bottles.

914
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:52,546
- I don't care.
- Your body cares.

915
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:55,382
Your body counts the bottles
and keeps an inventory in your liver.

916
00:52:55,465 --> 00:52:59,511
David, my fellow drinker,
I'd like to tell you a secret.

917
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:00,804
What secret?

918
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:03,640
You know, Linda,
there have been many occasions in my life

919
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:06,226
where I've had a few glasses of wine,
and the next morning,

920
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,396
I've woke up like, "Golly, wow,
I wish I hadn't have said that."

921
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:11,857
Oh, I've done that so many times too.

922
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,193
You know, my mantra is
"Secrets and wine don't go great together."

923
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:17,654
- Let her tell me the secret.
- He's gonna like the secret.

924
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:20,740
- You're gonna like the secret.
- No. You don't know. He might not.

925
00:53:20,824 --> 00:53:24,286
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- He might not be in a place where it's okay.

926
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,287
<i>He watches Fox.</i>

927
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,415
It is I who am buying Paxton's motorbike.

928
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,309
<i>What?</i>

929
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:36,756
When he said he was selling it,
I arranged a dealer to buy it anonymously.

930
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,967
I'm gonna buy it and give it back to him.

931
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,176
A parting gift.

932
00:53:46,391 --> 00:53:48,852
For a while I've known I
had to leave him, but...

933
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:54,316
But losing the bike, yeah, that's just--
That's too much.

934
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,236
And the bike means something
to me too, you know?

935
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,420
Youth.

936
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:01,448
Cigarettes.

937
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:02,631
Bad...

938
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:05,827
bad wine chosen by Paxton.

939
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:10,832
<i>Wow, that's...</i>

940
00:54:10,916 --> 00:54:12,667
- That's awesome.
- Here's the thing, David.

941
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:15,837
I want you to tell him it's you
who's buying the bike and giving it back.

942
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,547
I don't want him to know that it's me.

943
00:54:19,174 --> 00:54:20,274
<i>Why?</i>

944
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:23,402
It'll hurt him less.

945
00:54:24,888 --> 00:54:26,681
He really is quite prehistoric.

946
00:54:28,016 --> 00:54:32,062
I'm a bit drunk and I hate people
who get emotional on these things, so.

947
00:54:55,043 --> 00:54:56,143
Fuck.

948
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:12,268
Making noise for the NHS!

949
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,145
Thank you, NHS!

950
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:19,567
<i>We've got
Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3.</i>

951
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,863
Thank you!

952
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:10,493
- Couldn't sleep.
- Mm.

953
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:13,747
If the wine didn't work,
go and lick the garden.

954
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:16,624
How was it tonight?

955
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:21,421
Every other security person I met
was under the age of 12.

956
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:25,467
And every one of them was too busy playing
<i>Fortnite</i> to fully acknowledge my ID.

957
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:29,512
Anyway, I think for the young generation,
great literature is dead.

958
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:30,972
- Hmm.
- I could have had ID card

959
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:32,640
with "William Shakespeare" on it.

960
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:35,977
How many more pickups do you have?

961
00:56:36,061 --> 00:56:40,690
Um, tomorrow Harvey Nichols
and then Saturday Harrods.

962
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:45,570
- Harrods? Saturday night?
- It's all gone mad out there.

963
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,823
You know, one of the security guards
was telling me about

964
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:53,953
franchise managers are taking out
diamond rings and watches in plastic bags

965
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:55,330
and getting into Ubers.

966
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:56,915
What are you taking out of Harrods?

967
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:58,333
I don't know.

968
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:01,002
Martin says it's over three
million pounds' worth.

969
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:03,213
No codrivers 'cause of Covid.

970
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:04,464
Carrying it to where?

971
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:08,426
Uh, docket says Heathrow,
10:00 flight to New York.

972
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:13,765
Harrods to Heathrow Saturday night,
three million pounds, 10:00 flight.

973
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,391
Look. There's the hedgehog.

974
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:19,896
Oh, no, he's gone.

975
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:22,831
Ah, he's gone.

976
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:26,418
How was your evening?

977
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:29,823
Okay. Um, Paxton, here it is.

978
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:32,867
You can't do that pickup
at Harrods on Saturday.

979
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:36,204
- You really can't.
- What are you talking about?

980
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:39,207
Okay, do you remember once I asked you,
"Do you believe in God?"

981
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:42,752
and you said that you believe
that he's busy on another project

982
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:44,963
but occasionally
he puts his head around the door?

983
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:46,881
I think this may be one of those occasions.

984
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:50,802
God or fate or the virus or somebody
put our paths on the cross.

985
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:54,305
On Saturday,
I will be in Harrods packing up the cargo

986
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:56,057
that you are due to carry.

987
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:57,241
Fuck.

988
00:57:57,976 --> 00:57:59,394
What are you talking about? I...

989
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:02,564
I have to do the pickup.

990
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:05,692
If you do, you will be caught.
It doesn't matter what name you're using.

991
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:07,944
It's a fake name,
and I've implemented cross-checks.

992
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:12,699
You won't make it past the door. I know
because it's my system that'll stop you.

993
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:22,625
"I'm sorry" and "What the fuck?"
don't even begin--

994
00:58:22,709 --> 00:58:25,003
I can't fucking get anywhere!

995
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,400
I mean...

996
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:34,262
can't you just tell them that you know me?

997
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:37,724
That you know I can be
trusted, that I'm your--

998
00:58:40,018 --> 00:58:41,352
That I was your partner?

999
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:47,650
- What?
- It doesn't work like that.

1000
00:58:48,193 --> 00:58:49,293
And I--

1001
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:55,825
Since joining Miracore three years ago,
I haven't told anyone I have a partner.

1002
00:58:55,909 --> 00:58:59,037
Partly because I wanted
to keep work separate.

1003
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,039
Yeah, but mostly
because you were embarrassed

1004
00:59:01,122 --> 00:59:02,749
to have a partner that drives a van.

1005
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:07,212
Yes. All of the above. I--

1006
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:09,923
But now I'm looking at myself.

1007
00:59:10,006 --> 00:59:13,760
Since lockdown I am looking back at myself
like that was then and this is now.

1008
00:59:13,843 --> 00:59:14,943
Good for you, Linda.

1009
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,263
But if I don't make this collection
on Saturday night,

1010
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:20,433
then not only will Malcolm not promote me,

1011
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:21,616
he will fire me.

1012
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:25,647
I could always start dealing heroin.

1013
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,566
Lowlife is lowlife.

1014
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:32,836
No job.

1015
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,130
No bike.

1016
00:59:37,617 --> 00:59:38,717
No you.

1017
00:59:50,797 --> 00:59:52,840
When I worked at Harrods,
I had so much fun.

1018
00:59:54,092 --> 00:59:56,219
I knew everyone. Everyone knew me.

1019
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:59,389
- Most of them still work there.
- Any possibility we might get back to me?

1020
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:02,475
- I'm the one whose life is fucked.
- No, this is about you, all right?

1021
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:04,310
I know all the security guards, everyone.

1022
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:06,938
- I know the security systems.
- So?

1023
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:09,232
There is a way for you
to make your pickup at Harrods

1024
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:11,276
and deliver to Heathrow
without getting caught.

1025
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,612
You will get your promotion, I'll get
my stock removed, and no one will know.

1026
01:00:14,696 --> 01:00:16,698
But we will be breaking the law, so...

1027
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:20,493
you're gonna have to do
absolutely everything I tell you to.

1028
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:47,645
<i>Michael Morgan, acting deputy head
at Harrods Events Security.</i>

1029
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,689
Yes, you are in my old department.

1030
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:50,898
How's life at Harrods?

1031
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:53,860
I only just joined.
Because I used to be in the Royal Navy.

1032
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:55,236
Oh, quite a change, then.

1033
01:00:55,862 --> 01:00:58,114
Not really. No, Harrods is like a big ship.

1034
01:00:58,197 --> 01:00:59,297
Oh, okay.

1035
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:01,993
I mean, there are obviously,
you know, huge differences.

1036
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:04,078
- Course.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1037
01:01:04,162 --> 01:01:08,708
And not just in terms of shape of the
building or, uh, the fact it doesn't float.

1038
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:10,501
- You know, it's...
- Oh, yeah.

1039
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:13,296
Yeah, the working environment
must be very different, I imagine.

1040
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:14,922
Yes, it is. Lot of women here.

1041
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:16,549
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Yeah.

1042
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:21,304
Yeah, on the ship there was only four.
Two were called Karen, Karen 1 and Karen 2.

1043
01:01:23,389 --> 01:01:25,534
- I think Kate's meant to be joining us?
<i>- Kate Smith, yes.</i>

1044
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:27,268
Oh. When I knew her, she was Kate Wiley.

1045
01:01:27,352 --> 01:01:29,270
- She must have gotten married.
- Yeah, she did.

1046
01:01:29,354 --> 01:01:31,272
But it all went horribly wrong, I think.

1047
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:34,192
Oh. Sorry to hear that.
I wonder what happened.

1048
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:36,819
I don't know. They don't talk
to me about that sort of thing.

1049
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,571
Linda!

1050
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:39,754
Katie!

1051
01:01:40,073 --> 01:01:42,784
- Oh, my God, oh, my God, how are you?
- Oh, my gosh.

1052
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:45,620
- You know, I'm surviving.
- Linda, you have gone off like a rocket.

1053
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:47,330
- I mean, my God.
- Oh, stop.

1054
01:01:47,413 --> 01:01:50,541
When they said CEO of Miracore,
I thought, "Okay, God, some bald man,"

1055
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:51,918
but then I saw your name.

1056
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:54,420
Linda was just asking
what went wrong with your marriage.

1057
01:01:54,504 --> 01:01:56,798
- She was... just wondering.
- No.

1058
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:58,716
No, I wasn't-- I didn't--

1059
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,218
When a man is shorter than you

1060
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:03,596
and then suddenly decides
to let his beard grow out very, very long

1061
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:06,099
and then becomes obsessed
with so-called white magic,

1062
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:08,059
it can just get very creepy very quickly.

1063
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:10,061
<i>Anyway, what can we do for you?</i>

1064
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:12,313
I have an update
about the Eve Schwarz clear-out.

1065
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:14,482
All the secure freight companies
have been booked.

1066
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,567
Our Logistics department
was late to the party.

1067
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:18,111
Eve Schwarz, Miracore, here it is.

1068
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:21,614
They booked a freight company
I've never used, so that's why I'm anxious.

1069
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:25,326
- Lime green is the colors and...
- You're anxious about the freight company?

1070
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,703
- There's gonna be green arrows...
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1071
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:29,956
If it's okay,
I know the Harrods security system,

1072
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,083
and I'd like to run checks
on the driver myself.

1073
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:35,586
- Oh, no, that's Imran's job. That's...
- Do you remember Imran, Linda?

1074
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,880
- Imran is now head of Events Security.
- I love Imran.

1075
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:40,716
- He's Michael's boss.
- Got any questions, I can handle everything.

1076
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,219
- Let me text him.
- I'm the one with the arrows.

1077
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:47,974
Okay, done.

1078
01:02:48,057 --> 01:02:50,518
I'll run you through the system
and get you into the store.

1079
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,229
- After that, what can go wrong?
- Okay, great, thanks.

1080
01:02:54,397 --> 01:02:56,274
I really appreciate you doing this for me.

1081
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:00,862
- What's the matter?
- Oh, I don't know.

1082
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:03,114
Days are passing quickly.

1083
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:08,453
When I woke up this morning,
it really hit me for the first time.

1084
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:11,622
The reality of what's happening hit me.

1085
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:15,126
The lockdown will eventually end.

1086
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,310
And then...

1087
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:20,882
the love of my life will be gone.

1088
01:03:23,593 --> 01:03:25,511
Paxton, you will move on from this.

1089
01:03:25,595 --> 01:03:26,804
You will heal.

1090
01:03:26,888 --> 01:03:28,764
There'll be a huge hole in my life.

1091
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:32,852
You'll change and grow and...

1092
01:03:35,188 --> 01:03:36,355
eventually, you'll...

1093
01:03:37,648 --> 01:03:38,774
you'll meet someone else.

1094
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:46,908
You were talking about the
bike, weren't you?

1095
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:48,633
Yeah, why?

1096
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:52,622
I mean, the bike is...

1097
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:55,249
one of the loves of my life.

1098
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:56,542
And I'm one of the holes?

1099
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:59,086
- Obviously, you're the biggest hole.
- Oh, why thank you.

1100
01:04:01,339 --> 01:04:02,965
I was gonna take the bike out today.

1101
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:05,593
The streets are completely deserted.

1102
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:08,888
Was gonna call it "Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1103
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:11,072
I thought maybe...

1104
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:15,269
Oh. No, I can't go with you, Paxton.

1105
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:17,063
No, I have an important meeting.

1106
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,736
An open road and a broken heart.

1107
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:26,963
Don't kill yourself.

1108
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:34,247
- Linda!
- Michael!

1109
01:04:35,498 --> 01:04:36,707
How are you coping?

1110
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,126
You know, it's been quite difficult.

1111
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,587
I can imagine.

1112
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:44,715
You know, I'm locked up on a mountaintop
with only eagles and bears

1113
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,134
- and my family for company.
- Please don't kill yourself.

1114
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:48,735
What?

1115
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,764
I said it must be nice
to have time to yourself.

1116
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:54,934
<i>Well, anyway, before we get on
to the exciting business of you</i>

1117
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:57,061
<i>and your big decision
to come home to New York,</i>

1118
01:04:57,144 --> 01:05:00,314
<i>the good news is that we have found a buyer
for the Harris diamond.</i>

1119
01:05:00,398 --> 01:05:04,026
- I haven't decided to come home to New York.
- The buyer saw the diamond

1120
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:05,361
on the virtual presentation

1121
01:05:05,444 --> 01:05:07,572
that you put together
ahead of the store takeover.

1122
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:09,532
That's great, that's-- Who is it?

1123
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:13,536
<i>In our new world, Linda,
one does not ask "who."</i>

1124
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:15,329
<i>He's anonymous, but I can tell you this.</i>

1125
01:05:15,413 --> 01:05:19,375
He's a very unpleasant member
of a very unpleasant family

1126
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:22,587
<i>who run a very unpleasant country
in a very unpleasant way.</i>

1127
01:05:23,713 --> 01:05:26,507
- Oh.
<i>- He's facilitating Miracore in his country</i>

1128
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:29,760
<i>and so, I've brokered the purchase
of the diamond personally.</i>

1129
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:32,138
<i>Harrods themselves
will have nothing to do with him,</i>

1130
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:35,016
<i>so I have acted as go-between.</i>

1131
01:05:36,517 --> 01:05:37,810
Hurray for us, no?

1132
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:39,854
Yes, hurray for us.

1133
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:42,940
Um, will he be wanting
to pick up the diamond in person?

1134
01:05:43,024 --> 01:05:45,109
No, he's not allowed into the UK.

1135
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:46,652
Something to do with, um...

1136
01:05:46,736 --> 01:05:47,653
Money laundering?

1137
01:05:47,737 --> 01:05:49,280
Human rights abuses?

1138
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:51,907
<i>Anyway, the big question, Linda,</i>

1139
01:05:52,575 --> 01:05:55,494
<i>the issue at hand here
is the future of Linda.</i>

1140
01:05:55,578 --> 01:05:57,079
<i>When will you be coming home?</i>

1141
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:02,251
Um, well, I've decided to leave
my decision about New York

1142
01:06:02,335 --> 01:06:03,961
until after lockdown is lifted.

1143
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:05,603
- I have...
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1144
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:07,465
Lots of ties in London.

1145
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:10,176
<i>Uh-huh. I was told that you're single.</i>

1146
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,070
Well...

1147
01:06:14,513 --> 01:06:18,059
Actually, that was never true,
but, actually, now it is.

1148
01:06:18,601 --> 01:06:20,061
<i>Well, the fact that you are single</i>

1149
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:22,355
<i>is one of the reasons I want you
to come to New York.</i>

1150
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:25,066
<i>I'm planning to get to know more
about you, you...</i>

1151
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,234
<i>You fascinate me, Linda.</i>

1152
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:28,986
<i>So tough on the outside.</i>

1153
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:31,129
<i>But inside...</i>

1154
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:33,173
<i>Are you tough?</i>

1155
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:38,412
Do you remember when you came to Paris?

1156
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:42,500
<i>That evening, after the meeting,
I was going to take you out to dinner.</i>

1157
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:45,836
I was actually going to try
to seduce you that night.

1158
01:06:46,962 --> 01:06:51,133
Well, I can only speculate
what kind of evening that might have been.

1159
01:06:51,217 --> 01:06:54,345
But I suspect
it would have involved broken glass.

1160
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:59,058
Anyway, uh, should I send the diamond
to this probable mass murderer's home

1161
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,852
or should I send it straight
to his torture chamber?

1162
01:07:02,812 --> 01:07:03,729
<i>What?</i>

1163
01:07:03,813 --> 01:07:05,731
Where would you like me
to send the diamond?

1164
01:07:06,857 --> 01:07:10,444
<i>Ah. Send it to New York, because of Covid,</i>

1165
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:13,948
it'll be couriered directly
to a safe vault in Wall Street.

1166
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,450
There'll be no one to check it there.

1167
01:07:16,534 --> 01:07:20,788
So, please make sure that the
verification papers are in the box.

1168
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:21,971
<i>Got that?</i>

1169
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:25,918
- Um...
<i>- For many of our new wave of clients,</i>

1170
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:29,130

1171
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:30,965
<i>Okay, see you in New York, Linda.</i>

1172
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,299

Don't be ridiculous, Linda.

1181
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:22,057
<i>In a shortage of medical masks, people
are making their own out of old clothing.</i>

1182
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:25,728
<i>But the WHO said it doesn't know
whether these homemade masks...</i>

1183
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:28,105
Where'd you go?

1184
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:29,289
Peckham Rye.

1185
01:08:29,815 --> 01:08:31,317
- Why?
- I don't know.

1186
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:34,820
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I was just driving really, really fast

1187
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:36,655
because I was being chased by the police.

1188
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:39,450
- What?
- I was playing a new lockdown game.

1189
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:42,828
- Green for stop, red for go.
- Fuck!

1190
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:46,081
- Did they get your license number?
- No, I'm too fast for them.

1191
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:48,876
I'm a streak of light on an empty road
in a deserted city.

1192
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:50,461
I'm the last man alive.

1193
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:54,048
I let the road direct me
and I achieved that moment of transcendence

1194
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:56,175
where the bike becomes part of your body.

1195
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:59,762
I found myself in South London by some
sort of urban farm with a petting zoo,

1196
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:00,971
and I hid among the goats,

1197
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,516
remember, the goat was my totem animal
when we were pagans.

1198
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:06,227
I sat with the goats
and then resumed my journey

1199
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:08,187
as the police cars drove past.

1200
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,370
I was in Peckham.

1201
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:11,357
Bought you cigarettes.

1202
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,566
And I had one myself.

1203
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:16,737
My first real, real one in ten years
and you were right.

1204
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:19,365
Tobacco tastes like youth.

1205
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:21,909
And real is real,
and real tobacco is me really,

1206
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:24,328
and I want another one right now
and I'm gonna have one.

1207
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:27,498
<i>This idea is supported by some scientists,</i>

1208
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:30,751
<i>but it's not supported by the WHO
nor is it backed...</i>

1209
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,053
You have a look in your eyes
I haven't seen in a long time.

1210
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:43,222
I don't mean to frighten you.

1211
01:09:43,848 --> 01:09:44,948
I'm not frightened.

1212
01:09:46,976 --> 01:09:50,104
Remember, I told you about the glass horse
and jockey in Paris.

1213
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,439
No, I'm still with the goats.

1214
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,123
They had blue eyes.

1215
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:58,237
I held the horse and jockey by the jockey
and I swung it around, and...

1216
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:01,115
And I remembered how it felt to be a rider

1217
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:03,909
and to feel like you were part of the thing
that you were riding.

1218
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:05,703
It's a sexual feeling.

1219
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,137
Yeah, it is.

1220
01:10:09,456 --> 01:10:11,166
I now wish I'd come with you.

1221
01:10:12,334 --> 01:10:13,434
Really?

1222
01:10:14,044 --> 01:10:15,144
Paxton...

1223
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:19,592
For a long time,
I've known that our relationship was over.

1224
01:10:19,675 --> 01:10:22,761
And for a long time, the only unbroken
thread between us has been sex.

1225
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:25,196
Go on.

1226
01:10:25,681 --> 01:10:30,477
I'm finding this moment difficult,
because I made a vow this wouldn't happen.

1227
01:10:30,561 --> 01:10:34,940
So could you just take the leather jacket
off and go hold a tea towel or something?

1228
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:37,318
- Hold a tea towel?
- Or buy some milk, it would help me.

1229
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:38,611
- We have milk.
- Bake bread.

1230
01:10:38,694 --> 01:10:40,195
That'll definitely kill the moment.

1231
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:41,947
I just wanna get on my bike and ride.

1232
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:43,881
And fuck the world.

1233
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:47,745
Okay.

1234
01:10:47,828 --> 01:10:49,413
Paxton, here it is.

1235
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:52,833
Probably as a result of lockdown,

1236
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:55,502
you have a mad urge to ride your motorbike
through red lights.

1237
01:10:55,586 --> 01:10:59,089
And as of two hours ago, I have a mad urge to
steal a diamond worth three million pounds

1238
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:01,592
from a mass murderer
and quit my job and become an artist.

1239
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:02,509
What?

1240
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:06,388
But I think the most practical thing we can
do to get this madness out of our system

1241
01:11:06,472 --> 01:11:10,309
is that I break my vow,
and we go upstairs right now and have sex.

1242
01:11:11,018 --> 01:11:12,269
"Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1243
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:15,621
Goats, now this.

1244
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:17,999
What a fucking day.

1245
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:29,552
She's, uh, just changing.

1246
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:32,388
Oh, by the way...

1247
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:35,334
Have you ever heard
of a poet called Edgar Allan Poe?

1248
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:36,517
- What?
- Yeah.

1249
01:11:36,585 --> 01:11:38,337
Never mind, all right, one second.

1250
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:41,131
<i>Listening to "Drive Time" with Dominic.</i>

1251
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:44,969
<i>And this is George Frideric Handel.</i>

1252
01:11:57,106 --> 01:12:00,484
<i>Please hang up
or press the hash key for more options.</i>

1253
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:02,861
Hey, Linda, I'm just calling to say that...

1254
01:12:03,696 --> 01:12:07,574
I know this afternoon didn't mean anything,
but I want you to know that it...

1255
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:09,785
Well, it felt like, uh...

1256
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:13,455
like South Dakota
that afternoon when it rained.

1257
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:18,002
And also, I have this bizarre memory
that just before we strayed

1258
01:12:18,085 --> 01:12:21,255
from the path of righteousness, you
said something about stealing a diamond.

1259
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:23,215
<i>You said something about
stealing a diamond.</i>

1260
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:25,134
<i>Did I imagine that?</i>

1261
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,468
<i>Press one</i>

1262
01:12:26,552 --> 01:12:29,346
<i>- to re-record your message.</i>
- Oh, God. Thank you.

1263
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:34,909
No.

1264
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:36,812
Grandma, I'm not seriously considering it.

1265
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:48,297
Fuck...

1266
01:13:00,794 --> 01:13:04,089
<i>This is usually
where patients recover post-surgery.</i>

1267
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:08,093
<i>But now, it's needed for Covid-19
overflow from intensive care.</i>

1268
01:13:09,053 --> 01:13:12,389
<i>Hospitals are having to adapt
to their spaces and practices</i>

1269
01:13:12,473 --> 01:13:14,433
<i>to be able to deal with coronavirus.</i>

1270
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:18,771
<i>I've been a nurse in ICU for 18 years
and I've never seen anything--</i>

1271
01:13:26,862 --> 01:13:27,962
All right.

1272
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:30,006
Big Saturday.

1273
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:31,424
Harrods.

1274
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:35,011
The grand deception.

1275
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:38,582
You have to tell me exactly
what it is we have to do.

1276
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:40,766
Paxton...

1277
01:13:43,212 --> 01:13:44,505
Sit down. Wait there.

1278
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:52,221
This is just us organizing
what it is that we're gonna do, okay?

1279
01:13:52,304 --> 01:13:53,404
It's nothing else.

1280
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:55,140
Why? What else would it be?

1281
01:13:55,224 --> 01:13:56,767
Nothing. Why do you ask?

1282
01:13:58,268 --> 01:13:59,520
- Are you okay?
- Me?

1283
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:00,703
I am okay.

1284
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:03,690
I am intensely okay and normal.

1285
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:05,025
Okay. Background.

1286
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:06,819
Harrods.

1287
01:14:07,945 --> 01:14:11,240
The top part is the public area.

1288
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:14,159
But below ground, there are seven floors.

1289
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:17,955
Floors where merchandise is stored
and lots of tunnels

1290
01:14:18,038 --> 01:14:22,000
where expensive items such as jewelry
are transported to secure elevators.

1291
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:25,671
All grown up and glamorous above
and efficient and scary below.

1292
01:14:25,754 --> 01:14:28,215
Security at Harrods is unbelievably tight.

1293
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:31,176
It would be impossible to get inside
to actually steal something.

1294
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,595
Steal?
Who's talking about stealing anything?

1295
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,266
Everything is normal.
Paxton, stop being weird.

1296
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:38,725
It's not me being weird.

1297
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:42,312
I mean, you clearly appear
to have a hidden agenda

1298
01:14:42,396 --> 01:14:44,648
which is not that hidden,
but I don't know what it is.

1299
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:46,984
Also, you've got a smudge above your eye.

1300
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,945
Did you get my message
on your phone last night?

1301
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:52,114
About South Dakota?

1302
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:53,839
And about a diamond.

1303
01:14:54,867 --> 01:14:56,451
Paxton, what is the matter with you?

1304
01:14:57,744 --> 01:14:59,746
- There's nothing the matter with me.
- Seriously?

1305
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:03,333
Yesterday, you were talking
about stealing a diamond.

1306
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:05,836
You were, I am not imagining it.

1307
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,547
And today,
you are drawing Harrods like it's,

1308
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,340
uh, some kind of secret plan

1309
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:13,051
- in a secret heist movie.
- How can you draw a rectangle like,

1310
01:15:13,135 --> 01:15:15,429
like you're in a secret plan?

1311
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:17,097
- I don't--
- Do you have a secret plan?

1312
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,240
You know...

1313
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:22,477
I saw my grandmother's face yesterday

1314
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:24,980
and, I told her, "It's
okay, Grandma, I'm fine.

1315
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:27,107
I'm not going to do anything stupid."

1316
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:29,651
You said the diamond
is called the Harris diamond.

1317
01:15:29,735 --> 01:15:31,195
Oh, Paxton, come on. It--

1318
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:33,421
It's Saturday.

1319
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:36,491
It's morning. All the weird 4 a.m.

1320
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:39,453
fantasies and options have gone away
as they always do.

1321
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,205
Tell me about the diamond, Linda.

1322
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,210
There are two Harris diamonds.

1323
01:15:46,877 --> 01:15:49,004
- What?
- There are two Harris diamonds, okay?

1324
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,187
God.

1325
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:51,882
Why are there two?

1326
01:15:53,008 --> 01:15:55,510
Do you think I slept at
all last night, Paxton?

1327
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:57,763
Well, actually, no, I didn't.

1328
01:15:57,846 --> 01:15:59,473
And what was it that kept you awake?

1329
01:16:01,767 --> 01:16:03,810
Harris diamond one, Harris diamond two.

1330
01:16:04,853 --> 01:16:09,358
One is real, the other is fake.

1331
01:16:09,942 --> 01:16:12,069
When a diamond of this value
is exhibited in store,

1332
01:16:12,152 --> 01:16:14,863
they use a replica of the real thing
to put into the public area.

1333
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:17,616
The actual diamond is
kept safe in the vaults.

1334
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:19,159
Currently, the replica

1335
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:23,080
is on display here, on the ground floor.

1336
01:16:23,163 --> 01:16:26,083
But the real Harris diamond is here...

1337
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:28,293
in the vaults.

1338
01:16:28,377 --> 01:16:29,628
Tonight, at exactly 7 p.m.,

1339
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:33,382
you and I will be escorted to the vaults by
security to collect the real Harris diamond.

1340
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:35,300
We will then go up the ground floor

1341
01:16:35,384 --> 01:16:39,388
in a secure elevator where we add the diamond
to the rest of the Eve Schwarz collections.

1342
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:41,098
Then, right there at 7:30 p.m.,

1343
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:43,850
we will have the real diamond
and the very good replica diamond,

1344
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:46,728
side-by-side, next to each other,
almost indistinguishable.

1345
01:16:46,812 --> 01:16:48,272
And because of Covid restrictions,

1346
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:51,817
the only people
that will be there are you and me.

1347
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:56,238
So, then we put the real diamond
into a secure box and send it to New York

1348
01:16:56,321 --> 01:16:59,449
and we take the glass replica and I
put it in my purse and we take it away.

1349
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:02,411
That is what we are gonna fucking do,
exactly that, and nothing else.

1350
01:17:02,494 --> 01:17:04,162
Grandma, I love you.

1351
01:17:06,915 --> 01:17:08,458
May I ask a very obvious question?

1352
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:09,668
No, you may not.

1353
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:14,256
What would happen if we sent the replica
to New York and kept the real thing?

1354
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:16,383
I am assuming that as soon
as it got to New York,

1355
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:18,927
someone would,
would realize that it was fake.

1356
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:21,013
No, they wouldn't.

1357
01:17:21,096 --> 01:17:23,348
That is why I couldn't sleep.

1358
01:17:24,224 --> 01:17:26,059
Whichever one we send to New York,

1359
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:29,313
it will go into a secure vault in
Wall Street and won't even be looked

1360
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:33,108
at by another human being
for 20, 50, a hundred years.

1361
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:34,291
Holy fuck.

1362
01:17:36,361 --> 01:17:41,408
Three million pounds,
tax free, no consequences.

1363
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:43,285
One for me, one for you, one for the NHS.

1364
01:17:43,368 --> 01:17:46,330
- You have thought about this.
- You know, I need to go meditate.

1365
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:49,541
You sure they won't check it in New York?

1366
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:51,001
Shut up! I need to meditate!

1367
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:52,544
What? No. What were you gonna say?

1368
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:55,589
The man who bought the diamond is bad.

1369
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:56,506
He's really bad.

1370
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:58,425
And you and I are good.
And the NHS is good.

1371
01:17:58,508 --> 01:17:59,718
And good is better than bad.

1372
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:03,013
And when I explained all that to Grandma,
even she said, "Yeah, that's true."

1373
01:18:03,096 --> 01:18:05,307
And she was a Calvinist, straight as a rod.

1374
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:08,268
Unlike me,
who is weak in the face of temptation.

1375
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:13,398
Live wild or die, Linda.

1376
01:18:13,482 --> 01:18:16,568
Paxton, you're forgetting something
very important, okay?

1377
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:19,946
Assuming that we do this thing,
which we definitely won't,

1378
01:18:21,073 --> 01:18:23,283
how would two ordinary people
like you and me

1379
01:18:23,367 --> 01:18:26,745
find a way to sell
a three million pound stolen diamond?

1380
01:18:27,496 --> 01:18:30,874
Okay, that was it. My last attempt
to find a reason why we shouldn't do this,

1381
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:32,876
but you're gonna say Archie Bruce,
aren't you?

1382
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,059
Yes, I am.

1383
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,520
Archie Bruce.

1384
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:40,675
Over the years,
I've kept up with the guys and...

1385
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:44,429
I mean, Archie Bruce,
he's graduated from stealing motorcycles

1386
01:18:44,513 --> 01:18:48,809
to stealing vintage cars
and fine art and jewelry.

1387
01:18:48,892 --> 01:18:51,978
I mean, he'd have Mr. Harris
in a penthouse in Moscow

1388
01:18:52,062 --> 01:18:55,607
- before the banging of the next saucepans.
- And he'd do a preferential deal with you,

1389
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:59,903
because you stepped in one night and
saved his life at a roadhouse in Watford.

1390
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:02,781
Circle of life, something like that.

1391
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:06,326
With Archie Bruce, the nightmare began.

1392
01:19:07,411 --> 01:19:09,663
Maybe with Archie Bruce,
the nightmare ends.

1393
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:12,848
So...

1394
01:19:14,876 --> 01:19:16,128
what we gonna do, Linda?

1395
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,940
Okay.

1396
01:19:21,508 --> 01:19:22,676
Paxton, here it is.

1397
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:26,012
We decide tonight.

1398
01:19:27,347 --> 01:19:29,266
When we're there at Harrods
with the diamonds,

1399
01:19:29,349 --> 01:19:31,309
we're gonna know what's right
and what's wrong.

1400
01:19:31,393 --> 01:19:34,771
- We'll decide in the moment.
- Or let the moment decide.

1401
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:39,651
- What's the difference?
- Fate versus free will.

1402
01:19:40,444 --> 01:19:41,778
Who controls our destiny?

1403
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:45,615
Is everything part of a plan,
or do we fuck things up for ourselves?

1404
01:19:47,242 --> 01:19:48,785
Tonight at 7:30, we find out.

1405
01:19:58,253 --> 01:19:59,353
Hey, half-brother.

1406
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:02,231
What, now?

1407
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:03,691
You wanna Zoom?

1408
01:20:04,593 --> 01:20:06,052
All right, give me a minute.

1409
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:16,396
Ah, Paxton. How are you?

1410
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:19,316
Actually, I'm at a fork in the road.

1411
01:20:20,108 --> 01:20:22,360
Really? Perhaps what I have to say

1412
01:20:22,444 --> 01:20:25,989
will have some bearing on which fork you
take because it is sort of road related.

1413
01:20:27,657 --> 01:20:31,203
You see, Paxton, the other day when you said
you were going to sell your motorcycle,

1414
01:20:31,286 --> 01:20:32,537
I thought, "Wait a minute.

1415
01:20:32,621 --> 01:20:33,538
Time out.

1416
01:20:33,622 --> 01:20:34,831
Not so fast."

1417
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:38,668
And then, after I cut the call, I...

1418
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:41,671
- I thought about Mom.
<i>- Mom?</i>

1419
01:20:41,755 --> 01:20:45,133
How she would feel about you having
to sell your most precious possession,

1420
01:20:45,217 --> 01:20:47,928
while at the same time,
over here in the beautiful Hudson Valley,

1421
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:50,889
your brother, your half-brother
isn't having it so bad.

1422
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:55,393
You know, when the cherry trees
in your orchard get a fungus,

1423
01:20:56,061 --> 01:20:58,563
<i>it sucks, but there are worse things.</i>

1424
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:02,025
Yeah. Not for the cherry tree.

1425
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:05,028
Maybe worse for a cherry tree
is the steady tread of George Washington

1426
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:08,573
as he approaches with an axe in his hand
and a head full of good intentions.

1427
01:21:08,657 --> 01:21:11,284
Anyway, I wondered what Mom
would want me to do.

1428
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:14,746
Well, remembering Mom, I'd think
she'd want you to get to the point.

1429
01:21:16,498 --> 01:21:18,792
Okay, Paxton, here it is.

1430
01:21:20,502 --> 01:21:24,089
It is I who has bought
your precious motorcycle.

1431
01:21:24,172 --> 01:21:26,258
The purchaser of your bike is me.

1432
01:21:26,758 --> 01:21:28,718
And I am giving it back to you.

1433
01:21:28,802 --> 01:21:29,678
My gesture.

1434
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:31,429
Half-brother to half-brother.

1435
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:33,557
Your bike is yours once more.

1436
01:21:34,516 --> 01:21:35,892
Don't thank me, Paxton.

1437
01:21:36,393 --> 01:21:37,602
Please, no need.

1438
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:44,025
All I ask, the only thing I ask of you, Paxton,
is that you are kind to yourself from now on.

1439
01:21:44,109 --> 01:21:45,777
<i>That you learn from this.</i>

1440
01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:47,404
That the world does not hate you.

1441
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:50,240
<i>That, yes, sometimes fate
seems harsh and cruel,</i>

1442
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:52,450
but people really do want good

1443
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:55,745
- for people who--
- Hey, David, it's Linda! Hi.

1444
01:21:56,496 --> 01:21:58,498
Linda, I thought I was
just speaking to Paxton.

1445
01:21:58,582 --> 01:21:59,791
Yes, I know. I heard, David.

1446
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:02,252
Your magnificent gesture
and I just couldn't stop myself.

1447
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:04,963
I couldn't help myself.
I just had to jump on the call and say,

1448
01:22:05,046 --> 01:22:06,006
"Oh, my God.

1449
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:07,924
David, what kind of a person are you?"

1450
01:22:08,008 --> 01:22:09,259
David bought my fucking bike.

1451
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,552
Yes, I heard. I heard.

1452
01:22:10,635 --> 01:22:12,429
And then, I heard the sermon

1453
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:15,890
and I thought, "Wow, not only
is he so generous with his cash,

1454
01:22:15,974 --> 01:22:17,934
he is so free with his wisdom."

1455
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:21,479
<i>Anyway, Paxton, there it is.</i>

1456
01:22:21,563 --> 01:22:23,815
No, no, don't let me interrupt
this meaningful moment.

1457
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:27,527
What is it that you were saying, David?
Something about fate being harsh and cruel?

1458
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:38,887
Why were you mad at him?

1459
01:22:38,913 --> 01:22:40,540
- I wasn't mad.
- Yes, you were.

1460
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:43,308
It was you.

1461
01:22:44,753 --> 01:22:46,254
You bought my bike.

1462
01:22:46,338 --> 01:22:49,633
Paxton, don't be ridiculous.
You heard what David said.

1463
01:22:49,716 --> 01:22:52,719
David would never do something like that.
But he would take the credit.

1464
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:56,473
Whereas you would do something like that
and give the credit to someone else.

1465
01:22:57,098 --> 01:22:58,850
You did it because you felt sorry for me.

1466
01:23:00,894 --> 01:23:01,994
Yes.

1467
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:05,190
All right, I worried about
what would happen if you lost everything.

1468
01:23:05,649 --> 01:23:08,109
Mainly because I didn't want anything bad
on my conscience.

1469
01:23:08,193 --> 01:23:10,070
Confession avalanche. But, also, I--

1470
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:12,947
I did it because the bike represents us

1471
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,032
- and I--
- No, no.

1472
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:17,118
No, no, no. Pity is over here, all right?

1473
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:20,121
And love is way over here.
Don't pretend there's a bridge.

1474
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:26,670
But would you still feel pity for a man
who'd just stolen a million pounds?

1475
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:30,314
I'd be a millionaire.

1476
01:23:31,299 --> 01:23:32,926
And a bandido once again.

1477
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:36,513
Maybe you'd change your mind.

1478
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:39,766
Maybe we'd ride off into the sunset.

1479
01:23:40,684 --> 01:23:44,229
Paxton, whatever we decide to do tonight,

1480
01:23:45,021 --> 01:23:46,481
we will go our separate ways.

1481
01:23:46,564 --> 01:23:48,858
The money would mean that we're both free.

1482
01:23:52,404 --> 01:23:55,657
Well, I will factor that
into my decision-making process.

1483
01:23:58,118 --> 01:23:59,218
Thanks for the bike.

1484
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:13,550
- Om.
- Ladies and gentlemen!

1485
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:15,818
Fellow inmates!

1486
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:18,638
I have something for you.

1487
01:24:19,556 --> 01:24:22,934
Before I head off on the number 27 bus
to meet my destiny.

1488
01:24:24,561 --> 01:24:29,441
It's a passage from a poem,
written by T.S. Eliot

1489
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:33,027
who I'm sure no one has
ever heard of either.

1490
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:37,991
<i>She turns and looks a moment in the glass,</i>

1491
01:24:39,242 --> 01:24:41,494
<i>Hardly aware of her departed lover</i>

1492
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:46,791
<i>Her brain allows
One half-formed thought to pass</i>

1493
01:24:48,668 --> 01:24:52,213
<i>Well, now, that's done
And I'm glad it's over</i>

1494
01:24:57,177 --> 01:24:58,970
See you in the moment, Linda.

1495
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:19,073
This could be the last bus I ever take.

1496
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:39,719
Um, I've decided to drive myself. Thanks.

1497
01:25:39,803 --> 01:25:41,471
- Okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

1498
01:26:21,094 --> 01:26:22,387
<i>Do it, Paxton.</i>

1499
01:26:23,137 --> 01:26:26,099
<i>Take the opportunity

- <i>Paging Miss Harrison.</i>
- Hi, stranger.

1504
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:06,149
Oh, my God.

1505
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:07,510
I want to hug you.

1506
01:29:07,593 --> 01:29:10,555
But I can't hug you, I can't hug you.
I hate this virus.

1507
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:12,306
I'm blowing you kisses.

1508
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:13,766
- Thank you.
- Hey, stranger.

1509
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:18,062
- Hey! Oh. Let me get this back on.
- This place died when you left. How are you?

1510
01:29:18,146 --> 01:29:21,190
I need to know the name of your
personal trainer right now. Seriously.

1511
01:29:21,274 --> 01:29:22,984
I actually lost weight because of stress

1512
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:25,486
when I found out my girlfriend
was stealing money from me.

1513
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:27,030
- But that's a long story.
- What?

1514
01:29:27,113 --> 01:29:28,213
That's not for right now.

1515
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:29,532
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:29:29,615 --> 01:29:31,451
Terry? Yeah, Terry, yeah--

1517
01:29:32,285 --> 01:29:33,578
Guess who's here?

1518
01:29:33,661 --> 01:29:35,580
- Hi.
- Yeah, look, look at camera 14.

<i>- Cash office. Miss Harri--</i>

1521
01:29:43,171 --> 01:29:45,131
So, Linda, what are you doing here?

1522
01:29:45,256 --> 01:29:48,468
Oh, I'm not on the list, because I
made a special arrangement with Imran.

1523
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:51,721
I need a desk for five minutes.
Or three minutes. Charlotte, can I?

1524
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:54,599
- Come through.
- Okay. Oh.

1525
01:29:54,682 --> 01:29:56,392
I need to wait for my, um, driver.

1526
01:29:56,476 --> 01:29:57,602
Oh, hang on just a...

1527
01:30:00,313 --> 01:30:01,981
Hi, B2B Pro Freight Services?

1528
01:30:02,899 --> 01:30:04,817
- Yeah.
- For the Eve Schwarz collection?

1529
01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:07,653
Yeah? Okay, just wait here
for one second, okay?

1530
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:12,742
- We don't get our normal freight service.
- World's gone mad.

1531
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,994
I'm gonna have
to run a hundred checks on this guy.

1532
01:30:15,078 --> 01:30:16,245
We just need to see his ID.

1533
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:18,956
And Imran says we do need
to check the driver's ID.

1534
01:30:21,334 --> 01:30:22,434
Of course.

1535
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:23,768
Next. Come through.

1536
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:28,382
Yeah, can I see your ID?

1537
01:30:35,098 --> 01:30:36,198
Thank you.

1538
01:30:37,809 --> 01:30:38,909
Hi.

1539
01:30:41,062 --> 01:30:44,023
You know you have to sign back in
if you're coming back, okay?

1540
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:47,318
This all looks fine. Thank you so much.

1541
01:30:48,778 --> 01:30:50,071
Oh, my God, Charlotte.

1542
01:30:50,154 --> 01:30:51,322
I forgot I didn't tell you.

1543
01:30:51,405 --> 01:30:53,199
- You, of all people. I...
- What?

1544
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:56,410
It's just the most earth-shattering
life-changing amazing news.

1545
01:30:56,494 --> 01:30:57,745
I found someone.

1546
01:30:57,829 --> 01:30:58,746
- I met someone.
- No.

1547
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:01,290
- Yes.
- I thought you were gonna be single forever.

1548
01:31:01,374 --> 01:31:02,208
- What--
- Me too!

1549
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:05,461
- Dating app? Bumble? What is he like?
- Uh, he's...

1550
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:09,105
He's a poet.

1551
01:31:09,757 --> 01:31:12,260
Yeah, yeah, he's like this,
he's this really wild poet.

1552
01:31:12,343 --> 01:31:13,928
Oh, my God, that's so romantic.

1553
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:16,097
I know. I've got this slot
in the vaults at 7:00.

1554
01:31:16,180 --> 01:31:18,558
I've gotta get this guy processed,
but, thank you.

1555
01:31:19,684 --> 01:31:21,435
- Oh, Linda.
- I know. Life.

1556
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:23,855
Life, right?
You never know what's coming down the line.

1557
01:31:23,938 --> 01:31:25,189
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

1558
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:29,834
We're good.

1559
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:35,700
- Thank you, Mark.
- Anything for you, Linda.

1560
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:39,135
Okay...

1561
01:31:39,662 --> 01:31:43,541
I am going to generate you a Harrods pass
that will give you access to all areas.

1562
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:46,335
- Date of birth?
- January 19, 1809

1563
01:31:47,336 --> 01:31:50,339
But I didn't have my first poem published
till 1827.

1564
01:31:51,674 --> 01:31:54,927
Okay, that's good. You're taking
it lightly. You're not panicking.

1565
01:31:55,011 --> 01:31:56,971
January 19, 1980.

1566
01:31:57,471 --> 01:31:58,571
Height, six feet.

1567
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,558
- Build...
- Medium athletic.

1568
01:32:00,641 --> 01:32:02,476
And inside, I am panicking.

1569
01:32:03,019 --> 01:32:05,646
You do realize that we have both
gone fucking insane.

1570
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:07,940
We haven't done anything yet.

1571
01:32:08,024 --> 01:32:10,526
Criminal convictions, none.

1572
01:32:11,611 --> 01:32:13,237
So, when does the moment begin?

1573
01:32:14,322 --> 01:32:15,740
The moment we decide.

1574
01:32:15,823 --> 01:32:20,077
In the CCTV control room,
there is a deaf man who reads lips.

1575
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:22,455
Shut up, look here.

1576
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:25,291
Why are you good at this?

1577
01:32:25,374 --> 01:32:27,877
<i>Team B, can you get down
to the loading bay?</i>

1578
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,587
<i>We need help at the loading bay.</i>

1579
01:32:33,633 --> 01:32:36,928
Oh, Linda, I just need to get
the gentlemen's name in,

1580
01:32:37,011 --> 01:32:38,221
in case of a fire, so...

1581
01:32:39,847 --> 01:32:40,947
His name?

1582
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:43,074
Edgar Allen Poe.

1583
01:32:46,687 --> 01:32:47,787
Uh, Edgar...

1584
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:50,983
"Edgar Allen Poe."

1585
01:32:51,943 --> 01:32:53,043
Great. Thanks.

1586
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:55,738
Coming through.

1587
01:32:55,821 --> 01:32:58,908
This is the first time Harrods
has been closed in a hundred years.

1588
01:33:00,451 --> 01:33:03,287
Everything has to get packed up
and put into boxes.

1589
01:33:03,371 --> 01:33:05,957
Pearls, purses, fine art, fine jewelry.

1590
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,140
Diamonds.

1591
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:08,475
Yeah. Diamonds.

1593
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:16,008
Remember that game we used to play?

1594
01:33:16,092 --> 01:33:18,719
When we were alone in an elevator,
we ask each other questions.

1595
01:33:18,803 --> 01:33:20,763
We're only allowed to
tell the absolute truth.

1596
01:33:22,181 --> 01:33:23,281
Shoot.

1597
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:24,824
What went wrong?

1598
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:26,201
You and me.

1599
01:33:28,396 --> 01:33:31,148
When I met you,
I wanted wild and you were wild.

1600
01:33:31,232 --> 01:33:32,332
And then,

1601
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:35,528
I stopped wanting wild
and you stopped being wild.

1602
01:33:37,405 --> 01:33:39,198
- So, it should have worked.
- But it didn't.

1603
01:33:39,282 --> 01:33:40,700
- Why not?
- I don't know.

1604
01:33:42,368 --> 01:33:43,468
That's the truth.

<i>Doris, did you shut off the fridges...?</i>

1608

We have an hour
until our slot in the vaults, so...

1609
01:34:16,861 --> 01:34:19,488
What do you wanna eat, Paxton?
There is literally everything.

1610
01:34:23,242 --> 01:34:24,243
With the store closing,

1611
01:34:24,327 --> 01:34:26,871
Harrods is gonna give all of this food away
to a food bank.

<i>All premiers, please have your
pick-up documents available for inspection.</i>

01:34:33,836 --> 01:34:35,046
is there anybody watching?

1615
01:34:36,005 --> 01:34:37,105
Maybe.

1616
01:34:38,382 --> 01:34:39,482
Dream bigger.

1617
01:34:44,138 --> 01:34:45,348
Finest Beluga caviar?

1618
01:34:57,526 --> 01:34:58,903
So, is this the moment?

1619
01:34:59,653 --> 01:35:03,657
No. No, we gotta get something clear
before we make up our mind.

1620
01:35:04,658 --> 01:35:06,952
This is a black Périgord
truffle from Italy,

1621
01:35:07,036 --> 01:35:09,955
- it retails for 735 pounds.
- For a fucking mushroom?

1622
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:12,500
Okay. That is what we need
to get clear in our minds.

1623
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:16,253
What is the difference between the cost of
things and the value of things to you and me.

1624
01:35:16,337 --> 01:35:17,437
I'm gonna make a picnic.

1625
01:35:17,463 --> 01:35:21,175
A picnic which, under normal circumstances,
would cost about, oh, five thousand pounds?

<i>Doors closing.</i>

1627
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:53,332
My precious grandma was a racist.

1628
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:58,295
Yeah. And I've just decided to take her off
my in-head jury of people

1629
01:35:58,379 --> 01:35:59,797
who pass judgment on what I do.

1630
01:36:02,258 --> 01:36:03,634
So, who else is on the jury?

1631
01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:06,429
My dead mother, God, and you.

1632
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:09,515

<i>- Doors opening.</i>

Doors are open, I don't have to tell you.

01:36:23,696 --> 01:36:26,198
So which one of those
paintings do you want?

1636
01:36:26,282 --> 01:36:29,034
Uh... I don't wanna own one.

1637
01:36:30,536 --> 01:36:31,662
You want to paint one?

1638
01:36:33,664 --> 01:36:34,764
I just wanna paint.

1639
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,085
So, this is the moment.

Oh, wait, is the deaf guy looking?

1641
01:36:41,547 --> 01:36:42,647
What?

1642
01:36:42,965 --> 01:36:44,300
Oh! I made that guy up

1643
01:36:44,383 --> 01:36:46,260
- so you would stop talking.
- Ah.

1644
01:36:46,343 --> 01:36:47,928
Think about it.

1645
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:52,183
Hundred thousand pounds a year
for ten years or 50,000 pounds a year

1646
01:36:52,266 --> 01:36:54,810
- for 20 years. A million pounds?
- Twenty years. Yeah.

1647
01:36:54,894 --> 01:36:56,145
I mean, you could paint.

1648
01:36:56,228 --> 01:36:57,938
You wouldn't even need to sell anything.

<i>Doors closing.</i>

1650
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,194

- Yeah.

01:37:04,695 --> 01:37:05,988
- Never?
- Yeah.

1653
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:07,448
Went straight to the motorcycle.

1654
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:12,912

- Maria?

01:37:24,507 --> 01:37:25,607
- Really?
- Oh, Paxton.

1659
01:37:26,133 --> 01:37:29,053
Paxton, we are about to make
the most important decision of our lives.

1660
01:37:29,136 --> 01:37:30,513
Can you just concentrate?

1661
01:37:32,014 --> 01:37:33,114
Okay.

1662
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:36,101
In our decision-making process,
we haven't yet discussed morality.

01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:40,105
That's a whole city in lockdown.

1665
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:42,790
Hospitals can't cope.

1666
01:37:42,858 --> 01:37:44,151
A million pounds would help.

1667
01:37:44,235 --> 01:37:45,335
We'd be doing good.

1668
01:37:45,819 --> 01:37:48,322
I worked it out.
If it's in 50s, it all fits in one suitcase

1669
01:37:48,405 --> 01:37:50,616
and you leave it on the doorstep.
Take that, Grandma.

1670
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:53,160
- You got rid of grandma.
- Yes, I did. Thank you.

1671
01:37:53,244 --> 01:37:54,537
So, okay.

1672
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,180
We do it.

1673
01:37:57,998 --> 01:37:59,098
Fuck it.

1674
01:38:00,042 --> 01:38:01,142
We decide right now.

1675
01:38:02,628 --> 01:38:03,728
Okay.

1676
01:38:06,882 --> 01:38:08,592
Previously, I would have kissed you.

1677
01:38:11,095 --> 01:38:12,680
Why don't you see what happens?

1678
01:38:32,241 --> 01:38:33,450
- Okay.
- Fuck...

1679
01:38:34,868 --> 01:38:36,370
- Maria?
- Okay, it's time to go.

1680
01:38:36,453 --> 01:38:38,330
- Really?
- We gotta go to the vaults.

1681
01:38:40,541 --> 01:38:42,543
So, are we gonna do it or not?

1682
01:38:58,851 --> 01:39:01,186
- You okay?
- God, no.

1683
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:04,315
Is God really part of your in-head jury?

1684
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:09,528
And for the record, God is absolutely fine
with whatever it is that we decide to do.

1685
01:39:10,446 --> 01:39:11,697
That's good to know.

1686
01:39:13,449 --> 01:39:15,117
- Hi there. PJ, right?
- Yes, miss.

1687
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,910
- Lead the way.
- This way.

1688
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:21,665
Why does the name
Edgar Allen Poe ring a bell?

1689
01:39:28,547 --> 01:39:31,133
This must be Miracore.
I'll go get the Harris diamond.

1690
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:32,926
Come in. Don't drop it.

1691
01:39:35,888 --> 01:39:37,431
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1692
01:40:02,915 --> 01:40:04,583
<i>You're shipping that thing to New York?</i>

1693
01:40:10,297 --> 01:40:14,301
<i>Cartier representative,
please dial extension 352.</i>

1694
01:40:14,968 --> 01:40:16,970
<i>Cartier rep, please dial 352.</i>

1695
01:40:26,897 --> 01:40:30,109
<i>Cartier representative,
please dial extension 352.</i>

1696
01:40:31,235 --> 01:40:32,653
<i>Cartier rep, 352.</i>

1697
01:40:36,532 --> 01:40:38,242
- It's an underwater theme.
- Yeah.

1698
01:40:38,325 --> 01:40:39,702
- It's my idea.
- It's nice.

1699
01:40:40,828 --> 01:40:42,955
Very good at what you do. Or what you did.

1700
01:40:44,665 --> 01:40:47,543
Okay, so, we only need to pack up
the jewelry and accessories.

1701
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:50,045
Clothing all goes downstairs,
it shouldn't take too long.

1702
01:40:50,129 --> 01:40:51,964
Yeah, not too long. So, uh...

1703
01:40:52,881 --> 01:40:54,133
Should I take it out?

1704
01:40:55,342 --> 01:40:56,442
Yes, why not?

1705
01:41:05,436 --> 01:41:06,536
Yeah.

1706
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:09,288
Yeah.

1707
01:41:26,582 --> 01:41:28,625
- Do it quickly. The fish are piranhas.
- What?

1708
01:41:28,709 --> 01:41:31,044
It's meant to be symbolic.

1709
01:41:31,128 --> 01:41:34,131
- Symbolic of what?
- I don't remember, okay? Just do it fast.

1710
01:41:34,214 --> 01:41:35,314
You'll be fine.

1711
01:41:52,107 --> 01:41:53,317
So, this is the moment.

1712
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,460
Just...

1713
01:41:56,862 --> 01:41:57,962
seems so easy.

1714
01:41:58,572 --> 01:42:01,575
It's never been about "can we
do it," Paxton. It's about...

1715
01:42:01,658 --> 01:42:03,285
"should we do it" and "will we do it."

1716
01:42:03,368 --> 01:42:07,039
It's about you and me. And I am not
saying that we are going to do it.

1717
01:42:07,122 --> 01:42:10,751
But if we are, then you would need
to take one step to your left.

1718
01:42:13,712 --> 01:42:15,380
So, should I take the step?

1719
01:42:17,883 --> 01:42:19,176
Take the step, then we decide.

1720
01:42:23,931 --> 01:42:27,476
Linda, if we're deciding in the moment,
then I say we do it.

1721
01:42:28,519 --> 01:42:30,020
If we're letting the moment decide,

1722
01:42:30,103 --> 01:42:33,106
then in my opinion,
the moment is saying loud and clear:

1723
01:42:34,441 --> 01:42:37,653
"Put the replica in the fucking box
and put the real thing in your bag."

1724
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:41,130
Freedom, Linda.

1725
01:42:42,616 --> 01:42:43,951
In one beautiful moment.

1726
01:43:16,483 --> 01:43:18,068
- Yeah...
- You okay? Okay.

1727
01:43:19,319 --> 01:43:20,419
Okay.

1728
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:24,491
- It's under control.
- It's under control.

1729
01:43:24,575 --> 01:43:26,076
- Under control.
- Yeah.

1730
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:31,331
All right, I think that we should start
with the handbags

1731
01:43:31,874 --> 01:43:34,126
and, uh, we should get the dust bags.

1732
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:36,086
- They're around the corner.
- Linda!

1733
01:43:36,169 --> 01:43:37,269
- Linda, it's me.
- Donald!

1734
01:43:37,296 --> 01:43:41,008
I need to speak to you urgently. Um...

1735
01:43:41,091 --> 01:43:44,052
Excuse me, could you please take a stroll
or something for a moment?

1736
01:43:44,136 --> 01:43:46,513
I have some very important things
to say to my colleague.

1737
01:43:55,689 --> 01:43:58,233
Donald. Well, good-- I thought that...

1738
01:43:59,109 --> 01:44:00,903
I fired you, but you're here.

1739
01:44:00,986 --> 01:44:03,822
Linda, listen, uh,
someone made an anonymous call

1740
01:44:03,906 --> 01:44:05,449
to Miracore head office.

1741
01:44:05,532 --> 01:44:09,536
They said that the driver from B2B
who's carrying the Eve Schwarz collection

1742
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,204
is using a false name.

1743
01:44:11,288 --> 01:44:12,873
They said he's got a criminal record.

1744
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:16,043
Grandma, hey.

1745
01:44:16,126 --> 01:44:18,128
Well, I came as soon as I could.

1746
01:44:18,211 --> 01:44:19,671
- Thank God you're okay.
- I'm okay.

1747
01:44:19,755 --> 01:44:20,756
The police are coming.

1748
01:44:20,839 --> 01:44:23,216
- The police are coming and--
- They'll be here any minute.

1749
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:25,344
They'll be here any minute. Okay, that's...

1750
01:44:25,427 --> 01:44:26,678
Now, we're against the clock.

1751
01:44:26,762 --> 01:44:29,514
If he's innocent and who he says he is,
then everything will be--

1752
01:44:29,598 --> 01:44:31,808
Everything will be okay,
and it will be okay, Donald,

1753
01:44:31,892 --> 01:44:33,352
because I know what to do.

1754
01:44:33,435 --> 01:44:34,535
What--? What do you mean?

1755
01:44:34,603 --> 01:44:36,605
- What are you gonna do? Paxton?
- Paxton?

1756
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:41,026
Donald, Paxton.

1757
01:44:41,109 --> 01:44:43,403
- Paxton, Donald.
- Who are you?

1758
01:44:43,487 --> 01:44:44,821
I'm Edgar Allen Poe obviously.

1759
01:44:44,905 --> 01:44:46,073
She just called you Paxton.

1760
01:44:46,156 --> 01:44:50,494
Donald, this is Paxton
and I'm a woman called Linda Jarvis.

1761
01:44:50,577 --> 01:44:51,954
I'm an ordinary woman who,

1762
01:44:52,496 --> 01:44:56,083
60 seconds ago,
made an extraordinary decision.

1763
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:58,585
- What are you gonna tell him?
- What is it to do with you?

1764
01:44:58,669 --> 01:45:04,675
What it has to do with him
is that he is my partner and my lover

1765
01:45:04,758 --> 01:45:08,011
of ten years standing
and I think I'm still in love with him.

1766
01:45:08,095 --> 01:45:09,721
- Really?
- But most importantly,

1767
01:45:09,805 --> 01:45:11,598
he is also my accomplice.

1768
01:45:11,682 --> 01:45:13,976
You see, Donald, just now,
just one minute ago,

1769
01:45:14,059 --> 01:45:16,853
I decided, we decided to steal
the Harris diamond

1770
01:45:16,937 --> 01:45:18,772
- worth three million pounds.
- Oh, no. Fuck.

1771
01:45:19,272 --> 01:45:21,316
- Confession avalanche.
- It's okay. I know Donald.

1772
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:23,694
We don't have a choice
because Donald called the police

1773
01:45:23,777 --> 01:45:25,070
and they're about to arrive.

1774
01:45:25,153 --> 01:45:28,198
Like I said, it's going to be okay
because when the police arrive,

1775
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:30,575
we are not going to be here.
We are going to be gone.

1776
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:32,244
- You are?
- Yes, we are.

1777
01:45:32,327 --> 01:45:34,663
And Donald is going to tell them
that he talked to Linda

1778
01:45:34,746 --> 01:45:37,624
and she said that "Everything's fine.
It was all a misunderstanding."

1779
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:40,043
And then, he is going to give them this.

1780
01:45:40,711 --> 01:45:42,004
Your ID verification.

1781
01:45:42,421 --> 01:45:44,548
And you're gonna say
that you recognize that driver

1782
01:45:44,631 --> 01:45:47,467
from another assignment,
and then you're going to tell them a story.

1783
01:45:47,551 --> 01:45:50,804
You're going to tell them a story
about how this driver has an enemy at work

1784
01:45:50,887 --> 01:45:52,222
- who hates him.
- I am?

1785
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:54,558
Yes, you are.
You know why you're going to do

1786
01:45:54,641 --> 01:45:56,435
- all this, Donald?
- No, why?

1787
01:45:56,518 --> 01:45:57,728
Because we are good.

1788
01:45:59,146 --> 01:46:01,064
Paxton, Donald, we three are good.

1789
01:46:01,148 --> 01:46:04,526
And the bastards who told me to fire you
and the bastard who bought that diamond,

1790
01:46:04,609 --> 01:46:06,778
they won't even realize that it's gone.

1791
01:46:06,862 --> 01:46:08,989
- Mention the NHS.
- Yeah. Yes.

1792
01:46:11,825 --> 01:46:12,925
What do you say, Donald?

1793
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,537
Will you lie for us, Donald?

1794
01:46:18,165 --> 01:46:21,585
You see, all this anarchy
is because of lockdown.

1795
01:46:22,544 --> 01:46:26,006
Idiotic insane fucking lockdown
which has liberated us all.

1796
01:46:26,089 --> 01:46:28,050
We'll give you money.
I'll give you 200 grand.

1797
01:46:28,133 --> 01:46:30,343
I don't do this for money.
I do this for beauty.

1798
01:46:30,427 --> 01:46:33,680
Linda, you are wonderful, Linda.

1799
01:46:33,764 --> 01:46:36,266
And he is your secret bandit lover,

1800
01:46:36,349 --> 01:46:39,478
and you are gonna spit in the face
of the global monolith.

1801
01:46:40,145 --> 01:46:45,609
During lockdown, I've had time to think
and walk in the park near my mother's house

1802
01:46:45,692 --> 01:46:49,404
and, God, apart from the dog walkers
and the joggers breathing everywhere,

1803
01:46:49,488 --> 01:46:51,698
God, it is a beautiful world.

1804
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:56,369
Even before the fucking virus,
we were all locked down in our routines.

1805
01:46:56,453 --> 01:46:59,372
- Our versions of ourselves printed out...
- We have to get out of here.

1806
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,917
- Let Donald have his moment.
- I can never get to work.

1807
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,377
I only came here tonight
because I was worried about you.

1808
01:47:04,461 --> 01:47:07,089
I don't give a fuck about Miracore
or their fucking diamonds.

1809
01:47:07,172 --> 01:47:08,799
I don't care about that.

1810
01:47:08,882 --> 01:47:10,884
I want everything to be stolen.

1811
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:13,970
I will lie for you, Linda,

1812
01:47:15,013 --> 01:47:16,473
because this is my moment

1813
01:47:17,599 --> 01:47:20,143
to fucking do something!

1814
01:47:33,156 --> 01:47:35,158
- Mad, all this, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1815
01:47:36,284 --> 01:47:38,495
Who'd have thought a month ago
we'd be doing this?

1816
01:47:39,037 --> 01:47:40,137
Not me.

1817
01:47:42,457 --> 01:47:44,709
<i>Paging Edgar Allen Poe.</i>

1818
01:47:44,793 --> 01:47:47,546
<i>Edgar Allen Poe, please report to Security.</i>

1819
01:48:02,811 --> 01:48:07,107
<i>Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,
please report to Security, immediately.</i>

1820
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:08,358
I think we should speed up.

1821
01:48:08,441 --> 01:48:10,944
We don't need to rush!
We're not trying to evacuate Dunkirk!

1822
01:48:11,027 --> 01:48:12,195
- This is heavy!
- Stop there!

1823
01:48:12,279 --> 01:48:14,739
If you've got purple,
you should be on the starboard side!

1824
01:48:14,823 --> 01:48:17,534
- I need to get to where I'm going.
- You've been allocated purple.

1825
01:48:17,617 --> 01:48:18,994
Leave it, leave it!

1826
01:48:19,077 --> 01:48:20,704
- Honestly.
- Linda?

1827
01:48:22,038 --> 01:48:24,249
<i>Paging Edgar Allen Poe.</i>

1828
01:48:24,332 --> 01:48:27,502
<i>Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,
please report to Security.</i>

1829
01:48:27,586 --> 01:48:29,588
It's Michael with the arrows from Zoom!

1830
01:48:36,553 --> 01:48:40,807
<i>Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,
please report to Security immediately.</i>

1831
01:48:43,435 --> 01:48:44,535
Oh, fuck.

1832
01:48:45,478 --> 01:48:47,439
You'll have to turn in your Harrods pass.

1833
01:48:47,522 --> 01:48:50,025
You go. Save yourself.
It's me that fate is fucking with.

1834
01:48:50,108 --> 01:48:51,526
Just keep walking.

1835
01:48:53,862 --> 01:48:54,962
Edgar Allen Poe!

1836
01:48:59,910 --> 01:49:01,161
You left this at the office.

1837
01:49:02,621 --> 01:49:04,414
You'll need it at Heathrow.

1838
01:49:08,543 --> 01:49:09,643
Thanks very much.

1839
01:49:11,087 --> 01:49:13,340
Everybody says, uh, come back soon, Linda.

1840
01:49:14,174 --> 01:49:15,274
You know we all love you.

1841
01:50:21,616 --> 01:50:24,703
Since that night, we've established that
although we are now both rich,

1842
01:50:24,786 --> 01:50:26,788
and no longer have to do jobs we despise,

1843
01:50:26,871 --> 01:50:29,749
the strains of lockdown are still
severely testing our relationship.

1844
01:50:29,833 --> 01:50:33,295
"Happy ever after" cannot survive
someone hiding your bag of flour.

1845
01:50:33,378 --> 01:50:34,713
Okay, hold on, okay.

1846
01:50:36,089 --> 01:50:37,924
Here is your bag of flour. I just...

1847
01:50:38,675 --> 01:50:39,801
Promise me that you're not

1848
01:50:39,884 --> 01:50:41,803
- gonna make bread, okay? No--
- Why not?

1849
01:50:41,886 --> 01:50:45,348
Because of the mess and the pointlessness
and because it will be inedible.

1850
01:50:45,432 --> 01:50:47,851
Like all homemade bread,
it'll be a pointless cannon ball.

1851
01:50:47,934 --> 01:50:49,853
My dad used to make it
and we had to eat it.

1852
01:50:49,936 --> 01:50:54,065
Otherwise, he'd disappear into his workshop
and make these hopeless wooden toys.

1853
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:55,692
- Never again.
- You've lost your mind.

1854
01:50:55,775 --> 01:50:57,944
What? I lo-- You buried a hedgehog

1855
01:50:58,028 --> 01:51:01,698
- and said a eulogy over the fucking grave.
- And you deliberately stuck a piece of tinsel

1856
01:51:01,781 --> 01:51:04,367
- on the ceiling above the stairs!
- No, it was there all along!

1857
01:51:04,451 --> 01:51:06,286
- I almost broke my neck!
- If you'd asked me,

1858
01:51:06,369 --> 01:51:09,706
- I would've held the stepladder.
- If it was all along, I would've noticed it.

1859
01:51:09,789 --> 01:51:12,834
But you haven't noticed that there
was no point in packing a suitcase,

1860
01:51:12,917 --> 01:51:14,794
because there's nowhere
you can actually go.

1861
01:51:16,379 --> 01:51:18,965
They just extended lockdown
by another two weeks.

1862
01:51:22,427 --> 01:51:24,137
Oh, shit.

1863
01:51:26,598 --> 01:51:27,698
Well...

1864
01:51:29,851 --> 01:51:33,688
All that for a bag of flour and a
definitely pre-existing piece of tinsel.

1865
01:51:33,772 --> 01:51:34,981
And...

1866
01:51:36,566 --> 01:51:38,068
Because today is my birthday.

1867
01:51:40,111 --> 01:51:41,237
- It's okay.
- I know.

1868
01:51:41,321 --> 01:51:44,282
- It's okay. It's lockdown.
- No, I know-- I knew that.

1869
01:51:44,366 --> 01:51:46,993
- Nobody knows what day it is. Never mind.
- I got you something.

1870
01:51:47,077 --> 01:51:49,371
I got you something you
really, really want.

1871
01:51:57,003 --> 01:51:58,213
Go crazy.

1872
01:52:01,466 --> 01:52:04,010
- Another two weeks?
- Another two weeks.

1873
01:52:05,178 --> 01:52:09,391
Oh, then my long suffering public
may need another poem.

1874
01:52:12,185 --> 01:52:14,604
"Counting the Beats," Robert Graves.

1875
01:52:16,314 --> 01:52:19,818
<i>You, love, and I, you and I</i>

1876
01:52:20,443 --> 01:52:24,406
<i>And if no more than only you and I
What care you and I?</i>

1877
01:52:30,286 --> 01:52:31,788
<i>Counting the beats</i>

1878
01:52:33,206 --> 01:52:36,000
<i>Counting the slow heartbeats</i>

1879
01:52:36,876 --> 01:52:41,047
<i>The bleeding to death of
time in slow heartbeats</i>

1880
01:52:41,131 --> 01:52:42,757
<i>Wakeful we lie</i>

1881
01:52:43,633 --> 01:52:48,596
<i>Cloudless day and night
And another cloudless day</i>

1882
01:52:49,681 --> 01:52:53,309
<i>Yet, a huge cloud
Will burst upon their heads one day</i>

1883
01:52:54,144 --> 01:52:56,229
<i>And on that day, lockdown will end!</i>

1884
01:52:57,021 --> 01:52:59,107
<i>Not there, but here</i>

1885
01:52:59,816 --> 01:53:02,193
<i>Only here, as we are here</i>

1886
01:53:02,277 --> 01:53:07,824
<i>Together, now and here, always you and I</i>
