1
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,619
话说在前头 我们不是兄弟
Before you say anything, I'm not your brother.

2
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:23,374
－血缘只有一半 －搞什麽 干嘛一开口就这样？
-I'm your half-brother. -What was that?Why would you begin a conversation like that?

3
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:24,833
因为你打算跟我要钱
Because you are about to ask me for money,

4
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,960
我每次质疑为何要给你钱
and when I always say, "Why should I give you money?"

5
00:01:27,044 --> 00:01:29,713
你就会回答 因为我俩是兄弟
you always say, "Because I am your brother,"

6
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:32,174
我之前都没声明 血缘只有一半
and I never point out you are my half-brother.

7
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:33,801
”玛莉” 反正最近有些状况‥
I never say it. But things happening around here lately...

8
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:36,345
帕斯顿 你还会乱想吗？
Hi, Paxton. How are your erratic head movements?

9
00:01:36,428 --> 00:01:37,930
我看了文章才想问
I ask because I read an article.

10
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:40,432
好一点了
Yeah, they're under control.

11
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:44,103
水泥艺术品销路怎麽样？
How's the, uh, cement art work?

12
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:47,398
她刚卖了一个 拿到五万美元
She just sold a piece for $50,000.

13
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:50,734
主题是冻结的瀑布 很切合时事
A frozen waterfall.It felt appropriate for the times.

14
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:52,611
怎麽说切合？
How is it appropriate for the times?

15
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:56,907
－其实不重要 －我来电是想关心你们的近况
-You know what? It doesn't matter. -I was actually calling to see how you were.

16
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,575
听说纽约现在不太妙
'Cause I heard it's bad in New York.

17
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,745
是很糟 职篮比赛都取消了
It is bad. They canceled the NBA.

18
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,957
据说伦敦全面封城了
We heard London's under total lockdown.

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,543
说到这个 我正在放无薪假
I've been furloughed by the way.

20
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:08,961
－太棒了 －没错
- That's great! - Yeah.

21
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:12,548
我的人生已经彻底失去了意义
Now there is literally zero purpose to my life.

22
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,258
琳达怎麽样？
How is Linda?

23
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:18,137
总之在屋裡某个地方
Yeah, she's somewhere in the house.

24
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,888
你们闹僵了吗？
Is there some type of issue?

25
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:22,850
闹僵啊‥我想想
Is there an issue? Let me see.

26
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:26,687
瞎扯感情状况以免外界严密检视
Convenient lie to avoid forensic examination of our domestic

27
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,064
或者要照实说？ 还是瞎扯吧
circumstances or tell the truth?Okay, convenient lie.

28
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,734
我们没事 感情很好
No. There is no issue. We are fine.

29
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:35,237
－跟她说视讯上见 －大卫 我还卖了重机
-Can you tell her I'm gonna Skype her? -Also, David, I've sold my motorbike.

30
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,656
－什麽？ －已经成交了 对方会付钱
-You've what? -Yeah, I have a buyer. He'll pay me

31
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,952
只等心理炼狱的枷锁解开
when we are all unlocked from this fucking prison of psychological hell-chains.

32
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,705
我们捱过孤寂的火刑
Fucking flames of burning aloneness.

33
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:47,624
我已经隔离到分不清什麽是身体
The screw of isolation until you can't tell

34
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,001
什麽又是家具了
what is your body and what is furniture.

35
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,378
完全无法发动引擎 直接脱身
No possibility of revving the engine

36
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,965
你能感受到我的心情吗？
and riding away. Am I conveying anything of my mood to you?

37
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,717
你干嘛卖掉重机？
Why have you sold your bike?

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,260
你根本少不了它啊
You are your bike. Your bike is you.

39
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,304
没错 我把自己卖了
Yeah, I have sold myself.

40
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:03,432
抛售掉往日认同
I have sold my former self.

41
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:05,100
我觉得车子很可怜
I felt sorry for the bike.

42
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,145
应该有人珍惜这个自由的灵魂
It deserved someone who can do justice to its spirit.

43
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:11,857
突破重重制约
Someone who still breaks the fucking rules.

44
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,318
你跟琳达吵架了吗？
So, you and Linda, what, you had a fight?

45
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:18,405
琳达说本来打算跟我分手
Linda said she was planning to end our thing,

46
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,743
放下这段感情或诸如此类的关系
our relationship, our whatever this ever was,

47
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,286
因为我们渐行渐远
because we'd grown apart,

48
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,498
也就是她向上提升 我沉沦探底
meaning that she had gone up and I have gone down.

49
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,541
她原本打算在封城前走人
She was planning to end it before lockdown was announced.

50
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,505
我们互吼 口沫横飞
...droplets and moisture because we were shouting.

51
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:37,800
彼此都大放厥词
I said some things and she said some things

52
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:40,761
结果困在这儿 但话已出口
and now we are stuck here together with the things we said

53
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:45,432
就像锺声不断回荡
echoing around the house like fucking bells ringing.

54
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:50,145
我们被迫关在屋裡两周了
For two weeks we are locked together here.

55
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:56,193
老实说 我只是想听到人声
Anyway. Truth be told, I just wanted to hear someone's voice.

56
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,405
－结果你挑了我们吗？ －挺好的啊
- And you chose us? - Yeah, why not?

57
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:01,365
你的那个朋友麦克呢？
What happened to Mike? Your friend Mike.

58
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:04,702
不行 我跟麦克闹翻了
Oh, no, no. Mike and I are no longer speaking.

59
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,745
他踩了线‥外送来了
He crossed... My delivery!

60
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,624
麦克踩了大红线 他说肺炎病毒
Crossed an important threshold when, uh, when he said that

61
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:16,046
是犹太人秘密散布的外星基因体
the COVID virus was the consequence of the secret release by Jews of alien DNA

62
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,175
从中国高球场洒水器传播出来
into the water sprinkling system of a Chinese golf resort.

63
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:22,886
看来食物到了 我们先挂断吧
It looks like your food has arrived,so we'll let you go.

64
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,638
这不叫食物 只是个三明治
It's not food, it's a sandwich.

65
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,432
兄弟 撑著点
Yeah, hang in, brother.

66
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,934
－半个兄弟才对 －跟琳达说我会打过去
- Half-brother. - Tell Linda I'm gonna call her.

67
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,979
我会留纸条 搞得彼此更尴尬
Yeah, I'll leave her a note. Just to compound the oddness.

68
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:37,234
抗疫的代价一览无遗
The stark reality of fighting Coronavirus...

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,616
伦敦特拉法加广场原本人潮汹涌
...Trafalgar Square in London usually crowded.

70
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,369
社交疏离显然是进行式
Evidence of social distancing in action.

71
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,705
值此关键时刻
In this critically important time,

72
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:53,167
已确诊的鲍利强森首相公告‥
the Prime Minister Boris Johnson himself infected,but been sharing...

73
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:17,941
玛莉 你们那边好吗？
Maria, hey! Is everything okay?

74
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:20,319
都不赖 我们很健康
Oh, yeah, yeah. Everything's great.

75
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:22,821
刚才还跟帕斯顿通过电话
You know, we're staying strong. Yeah, we just talked to Paxton.

76
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:26,116
我拿枕头捂住还是隐约听到了
Hmm. Yes, I head. Some of it. I put a pillow over my head.

77
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,619
他说你有些症状
He said you had symptoms.

78
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:31,080
但愿已经没事了 难说
It passed I think. I hope. I don't know.

79
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,084
记得分享蔬果昔的食谱给我
Oh, green smoothie. You must send me that recipe.

80
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,794
不必食谱 做就对了
It's not a recipe, it's an action.

81
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:40,005
就扔点蔬果按钮绞成泥啊
You just put the green stuff in and press the on button.

82
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:43,217
你跟帕斯顿之间还好吧？
How are things with you and Paxton?

83
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,679
你明知一点也不好
You know everything is not okay.

84
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:49,431
不但一点也不好 还全都糟透了
Not only is everything not okay,nothing is okay.

85
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,101
每件事都烦 他的名字也一样
Everything is never okay. Even his name is not okay.

86
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:55,521
连他都说听到他的名字会倒楣
This is him speaking. He says even his name is a predictor of doom.

87
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,690
他最近就是这副德性
That's how he is lately.

88
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,859
他变了好多
He's changed so much.

89
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,695
人总是会变
Oh, we all change.

90
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,405
你和他都跟以前不一样了
I mean, Linda, you've evolved, he's mutated.

91
00:06:04,488 --> 00:06:06,407
他需要人拉一把 我之前看到‥
He needs some help.I read an article..

92
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,826
你知道他之前说男人过了３５岁
Do you know he said the other day

93
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:11,161
还搭公车就是废物吗？
that any man over 35 who rides a bus is a failure?

94
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,206
他以前每天搭公车 说这种话只是在自虐
He rides the bus every day. Or he used to.He does it to torture himself.

95
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,875
男人的头脑都不好使
No man is ever really fully conscious, not really.

96
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,670
听说他卖了重机 可喜可贺
So, I heard he's selling his motorbike.That's a big step.

97
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:21,797
我俩都觉得他该放个假
Yeah, we both agreed that he needed some time,

98
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,634
所以他要卖车去哈萨克整顿自己
so he's planning on using the money from selling the bike to go to Kazakhstan to think about his life.

99
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,095
为什麽选哈萨克？
Why Kazakhstan?

100
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,141
我们十年前到那裡自驾旅游过
We went on a road trip there ten years ago.

101
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:35,102
十年前吗？ 久到算不清了
Ten years ago? A million years ago.

102
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:38,272
结果现在我俩都困在这裡
Anyway, now he is stuck here, and I am stuck here.

103
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:39,857
琳达 还有别人吗？
Linda, is there someone else?

104
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,775
没有 就我们两个
Nope, just me and him.

105
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,154
－我是说其他对象 －我没有
-No, I mean, like, another man. - No.

106
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,281
那女人呢？
A woman?

107
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:48,657
什麽？
What?

108
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,117
只是乱猜而已
I was just speculating.

109
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,203
记得我们在伦敦 越了线的那晚吧？
Thinking about that night we came to London and you and I went too far.

110
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:57,916
我们只是呼麻后起了玩心
Oh, that was just weed and curiosity.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,044
琳达 我们都高潮了
We both had orgasms, Linda.

112
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,629
听说视讯通话其实有资安风险
You know they say these calls aren't really the most secure.

113
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,840
我有时会回忆那晚
I think about that night sometimes.

114
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,259
－是吗？ －对 你不会吗？
- You do? - Yeah, don't you?

115
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,678
玛莉 我整天都在跟人视讯通话
Mmm... Listen, Maria, I've been on Skype and Zoom calls all day.

116
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,389
因为公司不开门 我得好好休息
The office is locked down. I really gotta get some sleep.

117
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,974
－好 再见 －再聊
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

118
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,893
我爱你
I love you.

119
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,436
什麽？
What?

120
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:25,444
老天爷
God.

121
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,168
帕斯顿 你要出门吗？
Paxton, are you going somewhere?

122
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,090
－我能去哪裡？ －排气口为什麽接了管子？
-Where would I be going? -Why is the hose in your exhaust?

123
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:49,385
自拍一张而已
I was just gonna take a selfie.

124
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,346
有同事传讯问我怎麽熬过封城
Someone at work texted me and asked how I was coping with lockdown.

125
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:56,225
我要把废气接进安全帽自拍回覆
So I was gonna send a photo of myself with the hose shoved up my helmet by way of reply.

126
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:57,810
感觉很搞笑
I thought it'd be funny.

127
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,313
苦中作乐嘛
An amusing expression of despair.

128
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,732
你确定只是要自拍吗？
You were really just gonna take a selfie?

129
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,735
－我都拿了手机了 －不打算发动引擎吗？
-Yeah, I had the phone in my hand. -You weren't gonna start the engine?

130
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,946
但我哪裡也去不了啊
And go where? You can't go anywhere.

131
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,994
我一进来就闻到车库和摩托车味
I came in here and I could smell the garage and the bike.

132
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:20,833
那味道不知为何令人非常感伤
And the smell... it made me very sad for some reason.

133
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,836
柜子很油 你的屁股会沾得都是
That shelf's covered in oil, you're gonna get your ass covered in oil.

134
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,005
天啊 什麽日子嘛
Jesus, what a day!

135
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,798
不顺心吗？
Bad?

136
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:30,509
工作有些突发状况而已
No, just work. I had some bad news.

137
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:33,387
跟这一切比起来不算什麽
Nothing compared to... everything.

138
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,681
话说回来 我确实只打算自拍
I really was just gonna take a selfie, by the way.

139
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:37,933
话说回来 对了 不必担心‥
"By the way," "just so you know," "in case you were worried."

140
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,186
只是寻个开心罢了
Just... just a little game.

141
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:43,981
或者是预演
Or a rehearsal.

142
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,485
拜托你别认为我在图些什麽
I'm not... Please don't think I'm looking for anything.

143
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,071
你知道玛莉打来说她爱我吗？
You know Maria just called me and said that she loves me?

144
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,074
－什麽？ －我懂 到处有人跑来讲心底话
- What? - I know.Secrets coming out all over the place.

145
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,410
－你身上有家门钥匙吗？ －没有
-You got the key to get back in? - No.

146
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:58,287
那我就不锁门了
I'll leave the door open for you.

147
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,685
怎麽了？
What's wrong?

148
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,941
你拿排气管乱搞
You playing with the hoses and exhausts

149
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,235
我们却要装作没事
and we carry on as if everything was normal.

150
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,033
我最近是很不对劲
I'm not normal lately, I know that.

151
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,829
根本完全睡不著
I haven't been sleeping at all.

152
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,749
我一直有点怪
I've never been normal, but...

153
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,710
以前还引以为荣 但现在‥
I used to be quite proud of it. Now, I just...

154
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:53,050
－怎麽样？ －我彻底明白会搞得多麻烦了
- Just what? - I don't know.I'm just acutely aware of the inconvenience it causes.

155
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,804
我细密分析每一粒砂
My super analysis of every grain of sand.

156
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,347
每个词汇
Every word.

157
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,017
封城后变得更惨了
Being locked up is making it worse.

158
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,187
我们得想办法分开隔离
We have to find some way of getting through this separately.

159
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,272
现在只是恰巧困在同个屋簷下
We're only together because we're in the same house.

160
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:11,902
解封前就避开彼此‥怎麽了？
We can sort of move around each other until we're free...What? What is it?

161
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,320
没事
Oh, nothing.

162
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:16,115
晚安
Good night.

163
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:20,327
圣诞布置搞到现在还没收
It's a bit of Christmas decoration.It's been there since Christmas.

164
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,039
谘商师说学习容忍也算是测试
My therapist says I should try to tolerate it.To use it as a test.

165
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,167
我还捱得住就印证有进步了
Up until now, I've been able to live with it,as a test to prove my progress.

166
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,087
去他的进步 你拆掉就是了
Well, fuck progress.Why don't you take it down?

167
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,215
－可是谘商师说‥ －谘商师个鸟蛋 帕斯顿
- No, my therapist says... - Fuck the therapist. Paxton... - You almost did.

168
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:34,800
你就差点吃了
Grow up. Take it down.

169
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:37,344
别耍孩子气 看不顺眼就拆掉
If it bothers you, take it down, okay?

170
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,680
反正今年圣诞本来就不太愉快
Christmas is not exactly a great memory anyway, is it?

171
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,850
圣诞节确实闹得很不开心
Christmas is not a great memory. I agree with you.

172
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,686
我们从那时起就走不下去了吧？
Beginning of the end for us, don't you think?

173
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,022
我早在圣诞前就受够了
That was way before Christmas for me.

174
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,151
抱歉
Sorry.

175
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,612
怎麽会有人把诚实当上策？
Why do people think honesty is good?

176
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,285
你现在怎麽谘商？
What are you doing about therapy anyway?

177
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:03,203
我开视讯做谘商
I'm doing it on Zoom.

178
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,622
谘商师的家中牆上还挂了鹿角
My therapist has antlers on his wall.

179
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,666
帕斯顿 现在非比寻常
These are extraordinary circumstances, Paxton.

180
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,086
你本不该跟甩了你的女人同住 天花板上还留著金葱
You can't live with a woman who has dumped you and a piece of tinsel on the ceiling.

181
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,880
我们打算要一笑置之了吗？
Have we decided to laugh about all this?

182
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,674
有何不可 反正也没辄了
Why not?Nothing else we can do there, is there?

183
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,426
要椅子垫脚吗？
Do you want a chair?

184
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,635
好
Sure.

185
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,062
了不起
Bravo.

186
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,106
－该死 这样好多了 －等一下
- Fuck! That's better. - Hang on.

187
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,616
我在车库看到你时有个念头
You know, when I saw you in the garage I thought...

188
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,746
好几年前 跟你一起骑车的是我吗？
"Was it really me on the back of your bike all those years ago?"

189
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,332
是你没错
Yeah, it was you.

190
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,252
硬撑著大喊大叫
Hanging on and screaming.

191
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,256
我现在也硬撑著大喊大叫
Well, that's what I'm doing now.

192
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,175
但你或其他人都听不见
Hanging on and screaming, but you can't hear me.

193
00:11:58,258 --> 00:11:59,802
算了 晚安
Nobody can. Anyway, good night.

194
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,221
大喊大叫什麽？
Screaming about what?

195
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,557
你有什麽好大喊大叫的？
What are you screaming about?

196
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,185
要叫的是我吧
I'm the one that's screaming!

197
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:10,771
{\an8}抽烟可能致死 售价含税

198
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,203
陌生人
Hello, stranger!

199
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:29,748
你好
Hi.

200
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,208
你好吗？
How are you?

201
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,503
糟透了 你呢？
Terrible. You?

202
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:35,963
很惨
Awful.

203
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:42,970
大家好
Hello!

204
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:48,142
在这波特兰街监狱 有同胞想听我念诗吗？
Does anyone here in our lovely Portland Street prison want to hear a little poem?

205
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,769
我读了不少诗
I read a lot of poetry

206
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,564
最近失眠就又翻阅了不少
and I've read even more lately 'cause I can't sleep.How are you?

207
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,193
从此明白世上还有别人了无希望
that you're not the only human being on earth who's fucked up.

208
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,945
帕斯顿
Paxton!

209
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,656
你在搞什麽鬼？
What the fuck are you doing?

210
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,117
我在帮”狱友”解闷
I'm entertaining our fellow inmates.

211
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,038
这首诗提名”起身”
This poem is called Stand Up!

212
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,748
对了 作者是大卫劳伦斯
It's by D.H. Lawrence, by the way.

213
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,292
只是顺带一提 给想知道的人
"By the way," "just so you know," "in case you were worried."

214
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,588
好 我要朗诵了
All right, here goes.

215
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,550
”起身吧 但不为耶稣”
"Stand up, but not for Jesus!

216
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,719
”那为时已晚”
It's a little late for that.

217
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,305
”起身扞卫正义和幸福人生”
Stand up for justice and a jolly life.

218
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,848
”我会一起声援”
I'll hold your hat.

219
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:32,353
”小淘气们 起身扞卫正义”
Stand up, stand up for justice, ye swindled little blokes!

220
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,938
”起身奋力冲撞”
Stand up and do some punching,

221
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,316
”给他们颜色瞧瞧”
give 'em a few hard pokes.

222
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,943
”起身争取改变现状”
Stand up for a new arrangement for

223
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,072
”为所有人谋求机会”
a chance of life all round,

224
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,992
”力争自由和快乐”
for freedom and the fun of living,

225
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,037
”闯进去坚守阵地吧”
break in, and hold the ground!"

226
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,544
谢谢 吵醒各位真不好意思
Thank you.Sorry if I woke you.

227
00:13:57,961 --> 00:14:00,381
但我最近精神状况不好
But I am going slightly mad lately.

228
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,967
在此给大家一个忠告
My advice to everyone

229
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,388
善用我们共同经历的奇幻时光
is to use these strange times we're all going through

230
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,307
把人生应得的事物抢回来
to steal all the things that you think life owes you.

231
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,142
回去睡觉 蠢材
Go to sleep, you bloody tosser!

232
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,604
－我睡得著就会去睡 －老兄 就让他念吧
-Yeah, well, if I could I would. -Hey, leave him be, mate!

233
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,940
之后翻到好诗再来跟各位分享
And if I come across any other good poems, I'll share it.

234
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,983
念得好
We love it!

235
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,861
－波特兰街的大家晚安 －晚安
-Good night, Portland Street. -Night, night!

236
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,738
感谢你
Thank you!

237
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,505
老天爷 求求你让我睡著
God, please let me sleep.

238
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,349
好多喔

239
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,184
不要啦

240
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,520
可能有人听见了

241
00:14:56,603 --> 00:15:00,107
闭嘴 别把人引来

242
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,859
我对天发誓
I swear to God!

243
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,445
你们跑来我家院子做什麽？
What the fuck are you doing in my garden?

244
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:08,115
你还好吗？ 我们在采这东西
You all right?We're just gathering these.

245
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,993
只是罂粟的鳞茎而已
They're just poppies.They're bulbs of poppies.

246
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,078
我们社区的药头都被捕了
All the dealers in our estate have been arrested,

247
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,165
毕竟只有他们还上街活动
because they're the only people out on the streets, innit?

248
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,835
罂粟鳞茎是鸦片的原料
With these poppy bulbs, you can make a sort of opium.

249
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,004
划开表皮就能采收汁液
You just slit the skins and juice comes out.

250
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:27,092
－你们怎麽晓得这裡有？ －我们住在那边的大厦裡
-How did you know they were here? -We live in that tower block up there, bro.

251
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,803
朋友有望远镜 喜欢观星
Friend of ours has a telescope. He's into stars and shit.

252
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,139
我们用望远镜俯看房子找乐子
We've been looking down on houses for a laugh.

253
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,018
隔著窗户发现你家有罂粟
Looking through windows and then we saw all these growing in your garden.

254
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,771
我家庭院裡怎麽会长出罂粟？
What the fuck are they all doing growing in my garden?

255
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,565
７０年代有些嬉皮私占空屋
I think hippies used to squat in these houses in the '70s.

256
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:43,359
播种之后就任它们长了吧
I think they grew them and they just went wild.

257
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,778
－没错 －树汁要怎麽提炼？
-you 're right -How do you refine the juice?

258
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,906
不必提炼 滴在香烟上抽就好
You don't. You just drip it onto tobacco and then smoke it.

259
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,159
也可以混在可乐裡喝
Or you can mix it with Coca-Cola if you want and drink it.

260
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,287
我现在不抽烟或喝可乐了
Yeah, well, I don't smoke anymore or drink Coca-Cola,

261
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,374
也完全不嗑药
or do drugs of any kind,

262
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:03,045
但以前胡搞时会狂抽海洛因
but back in the bad old days I did smoke quite a lot of heroin.

263
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,797
这东西不像海洛因那麽猛
This is not as strong as heroin.

264
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,757
效果很温和
It's quite a gentle hit.

265
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,343
－算有机食材呢 没错 －有机啊？
- It's organic, bro. - Organic?

266
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,638
难怪那只刺蝟怪怪的
That would explain the hedgehog.

267
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:18,102
院子裡有只刺蝟超轻松随和
There's a hedgehog in this garden who is unusually friendly and relaxed.

268
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:27,986
你们觉得抽一点点能助眠吗？
Would a very small amount help you sleep, do you think?

269
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,031
睡得可香了 一夜到天明
You sleep like a baby. Smooths everything out.

270
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,783
什麽烦人想法都会不见
No mean voices in the night.

271
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,078
放下烦人事该有多好
No mean voices in the night.That would be nice.

272
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,539
这样啊‥
Well, well, well.

273
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,372
帕斯顿
Paxton!

274
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,727
帕斯顿 天杀的
Paxton, for fuck's sake!

275
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,043
托比
Hey, Toby!

276
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,213
你还会咳嗽吗？
Hey, how's the cough?

277
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,840
好一点了 你呢？
A bit better I think. How are you?

278
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,885
我应该中了 希望已经康复
I had it I think, but it's passed.

279
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,804
病毒就像女武神
I hope. It's like a Valkyrie.

280
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,389
什麽？
What?

281
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,559
维京传说中有种神祇 会在战前定人生死
It's a Viking spirit who, before battles, decides who will live and who will die.

282
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,190
女武神的决定毫无理由
Valkyries, uh, make their choices with no reason.

283
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,151
不讲道德 无关善恶
No morality, no good or bad.

284
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,946
大家得病与否简直莫名其妙
It's just so unfair how some people get so sick and some don't.

285
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,573
托比 你来了 最近怎麽样？
Toby, you're back. How are you?

286
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,492
”唐诺” 棒得很 谢谢
Gangster. Thank you.

287
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,160
大家好
Hello!

288
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,453
唐诺
Donald!

289
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,207
－你打了领带 －这条是我爸的旧领带
-You got a tie on. -One of my father's old ones.

290
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,961
我正缅怀老式礼节呢
I've become nostalgic for old-fashioned formality.

291
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:54,258
我在视讯时会想像男人都勃起了
On these Zoom things, I always imagine every man has an erection.

292
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,387
－唐诺 你在家裡吗？ －这是我妈的家
-Donald, is that your house? -Uh, no. I'm at my mother's.

293
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,431
安东尼把我赶出门了
Anthony threw me out.

294
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,478
这样违法吧？
Oh! That's not allowed, is it?

295
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,024
我们在某晚大吵 摊了牌
We had an awful night, and everything came out.

296
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,818
原来我们痛恨彼此
We found out we, uh, hate each other. So...

297
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,154
大家好
Hi!

298
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,073
梅莉莎 意大利还好吗？
Uh, Melissa. Hey, how is Italy?

299
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,034
听说很惨
I hear it's bad there.

300
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,119
不对 我正在瑞典
No, I'm in Sweden.

301
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,622
－什麽‥？ －你自己看
- What? - Look.

302
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,917
这裡的酒吧还开著门
You can go to bars here.

303
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,878
有人坏坏吗？
Hmm. Is anybody obeying the rules?

304
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,811
都十年不嗑药了 我可真聪明
After ten years sober, that was fucking smart.

305
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,108
我们还在等谁？
Wait, who are we waiting for?

306
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,152
应该是提莫西吧
Timothy, I think.

307
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,612
提莫西没事吧？
Oh, is Timothy okay?

308
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,908
－为什麽会有事？ －他有慢性病
-Why wouldn't he be? -Well, he's got an underlying health condition.

309
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,242
你知道是哪种病吗？
Do you know which one?

310
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:06,330
不晓得 他感觉就像 有慢性病的人
No.He just seemed like a sort of person who would have an underlying health condition.

311
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,083
我们能先不管提莫西吗？
Shall we just start without Timothy?

312
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,711
对了 我还穿了皮鞋
By the way, I am also wearing shoes.

313
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,549
我们该开始了 我有要事得宣布
Seriously, we should start.I have something to say. Something important.

314
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,972
等等 提莫西传讯息来
Oh, um, hang on. Oh, it's a message from Timothy.

315
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,768
天啊
God!

316
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,853
他中标了吗？
Has he got it?

317
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,522
”亲爱的琳达 从今早九点开始”
"Dear, Linda. As of 9:00 a.m. this morning,

318
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,441

I am resigning my position at Miracore Media

319
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,151
”我花了点时间独自思考”
with immediate effect. I have had time alone to think

320
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,238
”我发现公司只会制造 自肥的媒体新闻”
and I've realized that what this company does is just self-indulgent media bullshit,

321
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,449
”支持著侵蚀全世界的 国际资本主义”

”我们应该发挥创意拯救地球”
We should be using our creativity to save the planet,

not sell handbags to the wives of fascist dictators.

324
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,375
”隔离中的提莫西敬上”
Yours in isolation. Timothy."

325
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:56,880
想来是都在看 大卫艾登堡的纪录片
Just been watching David Attenborough documentaries, I imagine.

326
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,800
－他是崩溃了吗？ －好 不必等提莫西了
-Did he snap? -Okay, so there's no need to wait for Timothy.

327
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,760
赶快把会开完
Let's get this done.

328
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,971
听起来事态严重 琳达
Sounds awfully grave, Linda.

329
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:08,767
－爹地‥ －爸爸在开视讯会议 等等
- Daddy, Daddy. - Shh. Daddy's on a call.

330
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:14,273
昨天我与芝加哥总部开了场 很长的视讯会议
Yesterday, I had a very long Zoom call with head office in Chicago.

331
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,984
各大洲的代表都与会了
All continents were represented.

332
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:22,197
在这流年不利中 全球分公司都面临一样的问题
And it seems that all over the world the company is facing the same at this difficult time.

333
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,491
身为米拉克媒体 英国分公司的执行长
As CEO of Miracore UK, it is

334
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,076
我‥
my...

335
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,913
非常遗憾地通知各位
unfortunate duty to let you know

336
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:34,877
我们将针对部分董事会成员 实施无薪假
that there will be some furloughing of employees across the board.

337
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,589
并从今天起执行强制性裁员
And also a number of compulsory redundancies effective from today.

338
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:46,889
我想前浪势必要死在沙滩上了
I assume the Inuit system of leaving the old on the ice will be in play.

339
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,725
唐诺 不要贸然下定论
Donald, please don't jump to conclusions.

340
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,226
琳达 这话是什麽意思？
Linda, what do you mean?

341
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,646
正常来说我会召集大家来开会
Uh, in normal times, I would've gathered everyone into a room...

342
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,357
大家？
Everyone?

343
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,821
会召集诸位来开这场视讯会议
Everyone on this Zoom call is on this call

344
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,574
是因为各位的职位已无发展潜能
because all of your positions have been deemed no longer sustainable,

345
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,411
你们在米拉克媒体公司的 劳动契约将即刻终止
and as of today your contracts of employment with Miracore will be terminated.

346
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,085
好 真高兴我在家
Okay.I'm glad I'm home.

347
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,586
我去喂鸡了
I'm going to feed the fucking chickens.

348
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,421
{\an8}梅莉莎

349
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,216
这样真的很过分 琳达 你良心不会痛吗？
This is really bad, Linda. How do you sleep?

350
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,342
{\an8}娜塔莎

351
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,802

爹地‥
Daddy...

355
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,441
马侃‥我以为强制休假
Malcolm, I thought being furloughed

356
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,403
是指政府付薪水 我们不用做事
meant that the government pays your wages,but you don't do any work.

357
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,656
的确‥但疫情之下情况都变了
Yeah, it does, it does, it does.But COVID makes everything different.

358
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,449
很悲哀‥
So sad. So sad.

359
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,370
我教牧关怀的对象都深受影响
All of this is impacting on everyone in my pastoral care.

360
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,414
对 但我不是你教牧关怀的对象
Yeah, but I'm not in your pastoral care, right?

361
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,207
我是你的员工
I work for you.

362
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,584
我只想知道既然放了无薪假
And all I wanna know is,

363
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,212
你为何又叫我工作？ 这样不是违法吗？
if I am furloughed, why are you asking me to work?

364
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,422
我是基督徒
It's illegal, isn't it?

365
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,549
大家都知道你是基督徒
I'm a Christian man.We all know that you are a Christian man.

366
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,509
你说得像我在逼你信教
You say it like I ram it down your throats.

367
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,219
我没有逼你信教
I do not ram it down your fucking throat.

368
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:10,389
马侃 你就直说要我做什麽吧
Malcolm, just tell me, what is it that you want me to do?

369
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,974
现在出状况了 帕斯顿
We have a situation, Paxton.

370
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,101
你再不明说 我就要挂电话了
Yeah, I'm leaving this call unless you tell me.

371
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,394
我还听完你的祷告了
I sat through your prayer.

372
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,438
每次视讯我都会以祷告开场
I begin every FaceTime with a prayer.

373
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,356
这是我的个人选择吧 我是老板嘛
My choice. Right? I'm the boss.

374
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,776
对啊 你是老板 所以老板你到底要我做什麽？
Yeah, you are the boss. So what do you want me to do, boss?

to secure storage facilities in shitholes like Dagenham.

379
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,420
帕斯顿 你也看到了 我们的社会结构已然崩毁
The fabric, Paxton, of our society is torn, you see that.

392
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,917
我只有两个司机
And I only have two fucking drivers.

393
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,502
所以你有什麽办法？
So what's your solution?

394
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,255
欺骗 原谅 救赎 阿堵物
Deception. Forgiveness. Redemption. Bunce.

395
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,548
阿堵物是怎样？
What the fuck is bunce?

396
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,926
以前人常说的钱
Old East End word for cash, Paxton,

397
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,594
这是用漫天谎言 换取的不义之财
in return for grand deception.

398
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,430
是我的宽宏大量 与你的救赎之路促成的
Facilitated by my forgiveness and your redemption.

399
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,973
好 讲重点‥马侃
All right, get there. Get there, Malcolm.

400
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,559
我弄了个身份安全值Ａ２的证件
I've printed off an ID with a security level A2.

401
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,436
没有前科 上面有你的照片跟名字
Clean. With your photo on it and a name.

402
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,562
不是你的名字
It is not your name.

403
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,023
我无法正式终结你的无薪假 把工作派给你
I can't officially take you off furlough and give you this work,

404
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,942
因为你以前老是飙车搞事
because you used to be a bike slag,

405
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,028
我只能让你假装成别人 再用现金付薪水给你
so I will have to pretend you are someone else and pay you in cash.

406
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,406
你在公司当了七年的司机
You've worked for this company as a driver for seven years.

407
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,990
我从未听过任何客户抱怨过你
And I have never had a single complaint.

408
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,909
当然你都送低单价的物件
You've only ever driven low value packages,

409
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,954
但我相信你是个值得信任的人
but I believe you are a man who can be trusted.

410
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,374
我是
That I am.

411
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,044
我确实值得人信任
Yeah, I can be trusted.

412
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,629
那件事都多久以前了
I mean, what happened was a long time ago.

413
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,089
我不想知道
Yeah, I don't wanna to know.

414
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,757
那只是飞车党车手间的冲突
No, it was biker versus biker.

415
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,136
上帝会宽恕你 公司也会宽恕你
The Lord forgives. B2B Pro Freight Services forgives.

416
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,554
要不是因为那晚的事被起诉
If it wasn't for the fucking convictions from that night,

417
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,431
我的人生会完全不一样
my whole life would've been radically different.

418
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,765
日薪两百英镑现金
Two hundred a day in cash.

419
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,561
我不在乎现金 我要跟你谈条件 马侃
I don't care about the cash. I wanna make a deal with you, Malcolm.

420
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,271
我只有一个条件
Look, I will do this on the condition

421
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,482
搞定这件事后 你会考虑升我做行政文书
that when this is all over, you will consider me for a clerical position.

422
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,902
就因为一晚的错误 我的人生就毁了
My entire life has been fucked up because of things I did on one night.

423
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:32,197
我老婆‥已经放弃我了
My wife...My wife has grown out of me,

424
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,825
因为我还是那个 只会开卡车的烂货
because I am still Mr. Fuck-All behind the wheel of a van.

425
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,660
我不是笨蛋
I am not stupid.

426
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:37,786
我会读诗
I read poetry.

427
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,955
－我能成材 －我有通电话要接 帕斯顿
-I could be someone. -I've got another call, Paxton.

428
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,125
现在很忙 西区要忙疯了 你到底接不接？
It is a very busy time, the West End is going mad.Will you do it?

429
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,254
好 我要是接了这活儿 你要说到做到
All right, if I do this for you, Malcolm,I want you to practice what you preach.

430
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:51,216
关于原谅 迷途羔羊 还有救赎那些的
About forgiveness, and lost sheep and redemption,

431
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,010
给我一个回头是岸的机会
all of it, and give me a chance to come off the road.

432
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,471
凡事都有可能 帕斯顿 上帝保佑你
Everything is possible, Paxton.God bless you.

433
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,723
周四去塞尔福裡百货 周五去夏菲尼高百货
Selfridges, Thursday. Harvey Nichols, Friday.

434
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,224
－周六是哈洛德百货 －好
-Harrods on Saturday. - Right, yeah.

435
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,602
我把详细班表跟新的证件寄给你
I will e-mail your full itinerary and your new identity.

436
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:05,022
好‥周六送完哈洛德百货后‥
Okay, okay. And after... After Harrods on Saturday...

437
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,523
上帝保佑你 帕斯顿
God bless you, Paxton.

438
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,652
{\an8}吸烟可导致肺癌

439
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,324
可恶
Shit.

440
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,476
{\an8}盖伊

441
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,985
琳达 封城还好吗？
Hey, Linda, how's lockdown?

442
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,154
颇惨的
It's pretty bad.

443
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,281
芝加哥怎麽样了？
How's Chicago?

444
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,825
我在弗蒙特
I'm in Vermont.

445
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,827
全家搬到弗蒙特
Yeah, moved the family out to Vermont.

446
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,580
大家在这裡都超开心的
We're all here crazy happy.

447
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:07,501
小孩很吵 所以我买了新耳机
Kids make a lot of noise, so I got these new AirPods Pro.

448
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,587
有降噪功能 真的很棒 我什麽都听不到
Noise canceling. They work, like, you literally can't hear anything.

449
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,257
我没有那种耳机
No, I don't have those.

450
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,634
我从你的表情就知道
I can see in your face

451
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,219
你已经跟壹凡资的人们谈过了
that you, uh, spoke to the guys at Events

452
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,595
也跟他们更新了状况
and delivered the update.

453
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,016
更新 对 我跟他们更新状况
Update. Yeah. Yeah, I updated them.

454
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,811
你有没有读我的讯息给他们听？
Did you read them my message?

455
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,355
”公司是大家庭”那封吗？
The stuff about the Miracore family?

456
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,608
没有‥我觉得词不达意‥
No, no, no, I didn't think that would translate. Um...

457
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,319
琳达 我是发自内心写这封讯息
Linda, I wrote that message from the heart.

458
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,904
我是真心的
I really meant what I said.

459
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,782
我真不敢相信你没念出来
I can't believe you didn't read it out to them.

460
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,785
我觉得很不妥 说什麽”米拉克是个大家庭”
I didn't think it was appropriate to say that "Miracore is a family

461
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,038
”家庭终究会走到这一天”
and there comes a time in every family's life

462
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,832
”有些成员得飞出鸟巢 才能维系美好家庭”
when it's best if some family members fly the nest."

463
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,418
哪裡不妥？
Why is that not appropriate?

464
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,753
因为他们不是飞出鸟巢吧
Because they're not flying the nest, are they?

465
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:55,049
他们是被扔出鸟巢 砸到树下的杂草中
They're being thrown out of the nest into the long grass under the tree.

466
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,301
没有树啊 哪裡来的树？
There's no tree. What tree?

467
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:01,263
是你说鸟巢的 盖伊 有鸟巢的比喻就要有一棵树
It's your nest, Guy. You came up with the analogy of the nest.So there has to be a tree.

468
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,432
你是不是脑子烧坏了 琳达？
Do you have a temperature, Linda?

469
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,895
封城之前 本来安排了两场大型活动
Um, there are two big events which were already set up when lockdown began.

470
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,063
一场在西田百货
One was at Westfield,

471
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,690
另一场是伊芙许沃 在哈洛德百货借点举办的活动
the other one was the Eve Schwarz store takeover at Harrods.

472
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,442
但西田跟哈洛德都关门了
But both Westfield and Harrods have closed their door.

473
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,777
我好爱哈洛德
I love Harrods.

474
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,071
我也是 我在哈洛德工作过五年
Yeah, I love Harrods, too.

475
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,614
那是我人生中最快乐的时光
I worked there for five years, they were the happiest of my life.

476
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,991
总之伊芙许沃 这次的系列规模盛大
Anyway, the launch of Eve Schwarz collection was going to be huge,

477
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,369
所以基于场地大小与保安 我选了哈洛德百货
so I chose Harrods because of its size and level of security.

478
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:26,455
你选的？ 我以为梅莉莎才是活动策略长
You chose? I thought Melissa was head of events strategy.

479
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,918
有时我会质疑她的‥不重要
Yeah. Sometimes I questioned her... It doesn't matter.

480
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,004
你帮著这部门太久了
You've been carrying that department a long time.

481
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:37,341
是啊 毕竟是大家庭嘛 家人不就是要这样吗？
Yeah, well, they were family, weren't they?And that's what you do with family.

482
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,344
你会一直帮助他们 直到收到芝加哥总部的裁员指示
You carry them until you get a direction from Chicago to drop them,

483
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,637
然后按令行事开除他们
and then you dutifully drop them.

484
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,349
总之我们在哈洛德放了 市价五百万的珠宝 服装与首饰
Anyway, at Harrods, we have five million dollars worth of jewelry,

485
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,851
都是为了品牌走秀 与借点办展安置的
clothing and accessories already installed for the catwalk

486
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,353
都属于米拉克的保管责任范围
and store takeover under Miracore liability.

487
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,979
其中包括哈裡斯鑽石
And that includes the Harris Diamond

488
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,981
本来是要当走秀的重头戏
which was to be the centerpiece of the show.

489
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,235
哈裡斯鑽石 属于我们的保险责任？
The Harris Diamond is under our insurance liability?

490
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,529
是‥
It's, um...

491
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,949
鑽石目前安置在哈洛德的 安全金库中 没错
It's safe in the Harrods' secure vault, but, yes.

492
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,368
{\an8}弗蒙特去死

493
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,788
我已经向品牌提议
I suggested to the people at Eve Schwarz

494
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:12,084
尽快将物件移至 哈洛德的保安仓库中直到‥
that we put everything into Harrods' secure storage as quickly as possible until this, um...

495
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,795
直到封城落幕
Uh, until this situation is ended.

496
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,007
但保险又有个问题 就是‥
But we have a problem with insurance. You see...

497
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:26,015
伊芙许沃的保单上指出 品牌商品不得进行存放
So, Eve Schwarz's insurance policy means that they are not allowed to store their merchandise

498
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,892
除非在品牌自己的监管之下
except under their own corporate supervision.

499
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,937
因此要透过安全的移转方式 将商品送出百货
So the merchandise will have to be taken out of the store in secure transportation.

500
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,313
{\an8}弗蒙特好烂

501
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,649
总之 百货都在安排物件配送
Anyway, the stores are allocating for collection.

502
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,569
西田是周五 哈洛德是周六
We have Westfield on Friday, Harrods on Saturday.

503
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,989
接著我们要讨论 你的职位与薪资
And then we discuss your role and your salary.

504
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,783
接下来会有许多新的职务
There'll be a lot of new responsibilities.

505
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,493
公司有重大改变
Things are changing.

506
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:50,330
真是好消息 谢谢
That's excellent news. Thank you.

507
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,458
帮我跟伦敦打声招呼
Say hello to London.

508
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,585
－好好享受弗蒙特 －当然
- Enjoy Vermont. - You bet.

509
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,046
{\an8}弗蒙特去死 弗蒙特好烂

510
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,049
可恶 搞什麽 该死 昆恩
What? Oh, fuck! Quinn!

511
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:14,605
我要去阴尸路超市买牛奶 我们还需要什麽吗？
I'm going to the land of the Walking Dead to buy some milk.Do we need anything else?

512
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:19,860
我说”我们” 不是要暗示我们是同心同体
I say the word "we" without any attempt to suggest a unified entity,

513
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,864
但我们分两趟各买各的东西 实在很没意义
but there's no point in us both going separately to get our own provisions.

514
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,575
外面越来越危险了
It's getting rough out there.

515
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,953
而且我越发觉得 像我这种真的坐过牢的人
And increasingly, I think people like me who have spent time in real prison

516
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,081
在这种新生活中如鱼得水
are thriving in this new reality.

517
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,416
真的是‥帕斯顿 算了 进来吧
Oh, you know what, Paxton, fuck it. Come in.

518
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,880
好的 帕斯顿 是这样的 除了牛奶
All right, Paxton, here it is. In addition to milk,

519
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,549
我还需要香烟
I need cigarettes.

520
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,471
－什麽？ －我本来想掩饰自己烟瘾复发
- What? - I was trying to hide that I'm smoking again,

521
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,933
但反正我们已经分开了 这件事也不重要了
but since we're no longer together, it doesn't really matter, does it?

522
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,768
你又抽烟了？
You are smoking?

523
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,354
没错 我打算抽到封城结束
Yes. I plan to carry on just until this thing is over.

524
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,148
其实这感觉棒透了
It's magnificent, actually.

525
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,859
你什麽时候又开始抽烟的？
And when did you start smoking again?

526
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:03,028
圣诞节前
Just before Christmas.

527
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,697
为何？
Why?

528
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,158
我去巴黎时开始的
I started smoking again when I went to Paris.

529
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,994
－你去巴黎？ －对 我去了巴黎没跟你说
- You went to Paris? - Yes, I went to Paris.I didn't tell you I went to Paris.

530
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,288
麦克埃辛邀我去巴黎 我就去了
Michael Essien invited me to Paris and I went.

531
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:19,378
我的谘商师说 这样叫自白滚雪球
Okay, my therapist identifies these moments as confession avalanche.

532
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,673
麦克埃辛是哪位？
Who the fuck is Michael Essien?

533
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:25,467
他是米拉克媒体公司的创办人 德国富人排名第七
He is the founder of Miracore,seventh wealthiest man in Germany.

534
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,345
－你跟他去巴黎？ －不算
- And you went to Paris with him? - Not quite.

535
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:33,267
他邀请六个国家的执行长 去巴黎庆祝他的六十大寿
He invited the CEOs from six countries to come to Paris for his 60th birthday celebration.

536
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,060
你介意我点烟吗？ 我已经熄了两次‥
Do you mind if I light this thing? I've put it out twi...

537
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:38,439
不对啊 这是我的个人选择 我何必问你
And, you know what? Actually, it's my choice. Why am I even asking?

538
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:48,741
我到饭店的宴会厅时 认识了六个跟我一样的执行长
When I got to the hotel, there was this banqueting suite and I met six other CEOs just like me,

539
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,117
但当时我刚上任
only I had just become a CEO,

540
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,328
我还没意识到自己的身份 直到我看到其他执行长
so I didn't realize exactly who I was until I saw the other CEOs,

541
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:57,624
我这才确认了现在的身份
and then I was like, "Oh, so that's who I am now."

542
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,710
我们坐在桌旁喝香槟
And we sat around this table, drinking champagne,

543
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,004
对话中充斥著小人物的附和
and the conversation was lots of little voices saying "yes,"

544
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,590
与一声大人物的赞同 那是麦克埃辛的声音
and one big voice saying "good," Michael Essien's voice.

545
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,760
大人物接著说了”新兴市场” 然后我‥
And then the big voice said, "Emerging markets" and I...

546
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:11,472
你懂那种别人说得很抽象 但你却有个具体画面的感觉吗？
You know how sometimes when people say something abstract, I actually see it?

547
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,640
我们以前的确抽了很多大麻
Well, we did smoke a lot of weed in the bad old days.

548
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:19,229
当他说”新兴市场”时 我眼前浮现了这个‥东西
When he said "Emerging markets," I saw this...

549
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:24,360
这个形体从桌底冒出来 在我们的脚边游走
thing, this shape appearing from under the table and swimming around our legs.

550
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,029
我那晚好像真的发烧了
I think I actually did have a temperature that night. But, anyway,

551
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:31,075
然后他说了”香烟与药品”
then he said "Cigarettes and pharmaceuticals,"

552
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,203
我喝了点香槟时 又有人说”协调人”
and I drank some champagne and someone said "facilitators,"

553
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,414
那些人负责说服政府 商品的安全无虞
that is people who persuade governments that products are safe and okay.

554
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:41,877
大人物接著说协调人 是整间连锁的链接关键
And the big voice said that facilitators were now a huge link in the chain

555
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,339
我就看见了爬满海藻的大铁链
and I saw this big chain dripping seaweed

556
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,217
接著大人物举杯向贪腐致敬
and then the big voice raised a toast to corruption,

557
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,344
大家都嘲讽地笑了 包括我
and everybody laughed ironically, including me.

558
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,471
帕斯顿 看著我
Paxton, look at me!

559
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:59,561
然后这东西 这形体 在我脚边游走
And this thing, this shape, it was swimming around my fucking legs

560
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:03,941
大人物接著说新兴市场 是米拉克的一大收益
and then the big voice said, emerging market were now some big percentage of Miracore's profits,

561
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,276
因此欧洲分公司要进行 合理化的改革
and so there would have to be rationalization in Europe.

562
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,071
我有点想吐所以喝了点水 但又觉得快晕倒
And I drank some water, because I felt a little sick,

563
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,115
可是服务生问要不要白兰地 我就说好
but also like I might pass out, but then the waiter said "brandy," so I said yes.

564
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,658
所以呢‥
And, so,

565
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:18,038
就在圣诞节前的巴黎餐桌上 敲定了合理化的改革
the rationalization was planned right there at that table in Paris before Christmas.

566
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,833
而我早上开除的那些好人
And the nice people that I fired earlier today,

567
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,293
他们才不是像我说那样 因为疫情才被开除
they weren't fired because of a virus, like I told them,

568
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,461
那都是假的
that was a lie.

569
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:28,048
他们都是因为这鬼东西 才被开除的
They were fired because of this...this thing, this shape,

570
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,134
这东西随著我回到房间
that swam with me all the way back to my room,

571
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,595
为了摆脱它 我还拿了个丑陋的玻璃天鹅
and to get rid of it, I used the disgusting glass swan

572
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,848
朝著全身镜砸下去
to smash a full length mirror,

573
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,683
但我可没打算整晚踩著碎玻璃
and rather then walk across broken glass all night,

574
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,852
所以我决定搭最后一班 往伦敦的火车回家
I decided to take the last train home to London,

575
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:43,355
我抵达巴黎北站时 一名游民女子向前跟我要烟抽
and when I got to the Gare du Nord station,a homeless woman cameand asked me for a cigarette.

576
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,233
我说我不抽烟 但还是帮她买了一包
I told her that I didn't smoke, but I decided to buy her a pack anyway,

577
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,528
想说也许小小的善举 会让沦落至斯的我觉得好一点
because I thought that maybe kindness might make me feel better about what

578
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:53,365
看她点烟时 我也决定来一根
I had become. And when she lit her cigarette,I decided to have a cigarette, too.

579
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,576
当我把烟吸进去时
And when I drew in the smoke,

580
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,746
那东西就不动了
the thing stopped swimming.

581
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:04,710
然后我坐在长椅上等火车
So I sat down on the bench and I waited for my train.

582
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,256
那就是我烟瘾复发的原因
And that is why I started to smoke again.

583
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:16,472
但回到你刚刚的问题
But... to complete the answer to your original question,

584
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,932
除了牛奶与香烟
in addition to milk and cigarettes,

585
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,642
我们还需要面包
we need bread

586
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,062
还有葡萄酒
and fucking wine.

587
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,691
天啊
God!

588
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,902
怎样？
God what?

589
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,487
你听起来真的发烧了
Well, it sounds like you did have a temperature.

590
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,238
听说圣诞节前就有疫情了
You know, they say this thing was around before Christmas.

591
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,574
帕斯顿 才不是 跟病毒完全无关
Paxton, no! It's not about the virus.

592
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:40,120
而是我终于意识到自己的本质 与我的工作为何
It's about me realizing who I am and what I do for a living.

593
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:45,959
虽然重新审视人生 似乎是新冠疫情的副作用
Although a complete re-examination of one's life does seem to be a COVID side effect.

594
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:49,129
－你砸烂镜子？ －对‥因为我看到自己的倒影
- You smashed a mirror? - Yeah.Yeah, because I was in it.

595
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,340
我还砸了香槟酒瓶跟酒杯
I also smashed a champagne bottle,

596
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,050
本来还要再砸个 玻璃马匹与骑士
some champagne glasses, and I was about to smash a glass horse and jockey,

597
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,843
但我决定要留著
but then I decided to keep it,

598
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,929
结果却被我忘在火车上
but then I left it on the fucking train.

599
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:00,391
我就是像你以前说的那样 ”暴怒维京人”
Basically, I went, what you used to call, "Full Viking."

600
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:05,396
其实我看到碎裂的镜子中 自己愤怒的倒影时想到了你
In fact, when I broke the mirror and I saw my furious face in the cracked glass,

601
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,106
真贴心 感恩
That's very sweet. Thank you.

602
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,487
你为何不跟我说？
Why didn't you tell me?

603
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19,785
那时是初冬 我们的感情寒冬
It was the onset of winter. Our winter.

604
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,328
反正我也没跟任何人说
And anyway, I didn't tell anybody,

605
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:24,373
因为只要不说出去 这件事就能当没发生过
because if you don't tell anybody, then it didn't happen.

606
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,293
－收到镜子的赔偿单了吗？ －帕斯顿‥
- Did you get a bill for the mirror? - Paxton...

607
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:32,047
帕斯顿 管那面镜子去死 跟镜子完全无关‥
Paxton, fuck the mirror. It's not about the mirror, it's about...

608
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,265
以前要是发生这种事
Previously, at this point,

609
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,559
－我会抱抱你 －不用 没必要
- I would've hugged you. - No, really, there's no need.

610
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,811
而且你也要去采买了
And anyway, besides, you're going shopping.

611
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:50,691
牛奶 面包 葡萄酒 香烟
So, uh, milk, bread, wine, cigarettes.

612
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,359
可能还要买鸡蛋
And probably eggs.

613
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:55,195
那我还要买小麦面粉 我要做面包
I'm gonna put white flour on the list.I'm gonna make bread.

614
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,698
－拜托不要 －我说‥
- Please don't. - You know...

615
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,869
你刚刚那段不是什麽自白
what you just said wasn't a confession.

616
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,287
我又没说是自白
I didn't say it was a confession.

617
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,457
－因为你没做错事 －不是 那段只是在解释
-'Cause you didn't do anything wrong. -No, it was an explanation.

618
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,917
你做的每件事都是对的
You did everything right.

619
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,129
你想听听什麽叫自白吗？
You wanna hear a confession?

620
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,090
我早上睡过头是因为昨晚‥
This morning I overslept, because last night

621
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,010
我嗑了鸦片
I took opium.

622
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,888
真的
Yes!

623
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,641
是真的 比你抽烟严重多了
Yes.Much worse than your cigarettes.

624
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:29,188
我在花园裡的绿色花苞上 舔了点鸦片吃
I licked opium off little green bulbs from the garden.

625
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,857
真的 花园裡海洛因比比皆是
Yes, I did.Our garden is full of heroin.

626
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,650
晒衣绳再过去一点 就是罂粟花之乡
You go beyond the washing line, it's like the Helmand Province.

627
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:38,405
－你都戒十年了 帕斯顿 －抽烟也没好到哪裡去
-After ten years, Paxton? -Smoking isn't so great either.

628
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:40,783
我最近有点挫折
You know, I've had some setbacks lately.

629
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:41,909
我告诉你 帕斯顿
Yeah, well, you know what, Paxton?

630
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:44,787
从巴黎回来后 我每早喝的蔬菜果昔
You know that green smoothie that I have in the mornings since Paris,

631
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,955
裡面可掺了两小杯伏特加 只有两杯喔
there's two shots of vodka in it.

632
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,791
－你骗人 －并没有
- Just two but... - You are lying.

633
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,001
不是每天都有 但有时候会加
No, I'm not.Not every morning, but some mornings I do it. I have done it.

634
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:54,880
你以为我是因为不断升官 才这麽开心又正常
You think I'm so happy and normal is 'cause I keep getting promoted.

635
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,048
人们真的脑袋不清楚
People get confused.

636
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,634
没有 我从不会说你快乐又正常
No, I've never accused you of being happy and normal, Linda.

637
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,094
因为我就不是
'Cause I'm not!

638
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:04,598
懂吗 我看得见抽象概念 真应该去当个艺术家
All right? I see concepts.I should've been an artist.

639
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:08,936
以装没事假幸福的女性角度来看 你感到不快乐
You are unhappy in an outwardly "happy,let's pretend it's all fine" female way,

640
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:12,022
而我的不快乐是以挫败‥
and I am unhappy in an obviously thwarted,

641
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:15,526
－失败又没雄风的男性角度来看 －不行‥我不能再跟你吵这个
- unfulfilled, castrated male way. - I can't. I can't.Do not go down this road again, okay?

642
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:17,653

对啊
Hmm. Yeah,

652
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:52,646
现在戴这个不是抗争 而是服从政府了
well, it's no longer a symbol of rebellion.It's now government advice.

653
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,784
在南达科他州斯特吉斯 初见时你就戴那样
You were wearing that when I met you in Sturgis, South Dakota.

654
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,455
看起来像个亡命之徒
I thought you looked like a desperado.

655
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,331
我只是想挡沙尘
No, I was just trying to get the dust out of my mouth.

656
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:12,875
别毁了我的回忆
Don't spoil it.

657
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:19,256
记得买牛奶和鸡蛋 亡命之徒
Don't forget the milk and the eggs, Desperado.

00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,077
少烦我
Fuck off.

662
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,041

Paxton.

665
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:50,139
大声说出巴黎那件事后 我思考过了
Hearing the story about Paris out loud, it made me think...

666
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:54,309
封城结束后 我可能会离开米拉克
When lockdown's over, I'm going to think about leaving Miracore.

667
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,188
这干我什麽事？
Why are you telling me?

668
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,585
{\an8}马侃 拨号中

669
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,883
－你找我？ －我们的天父 我祈求你
-You called? -Oh, Lord who art in heaven, I beseech you,

670

垂怜我与帕斯顿 宽恕我们的欺瞒之罪

-Amen. -Every prayer is tailored to suit the person I am calling.

673
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:42,399
不是我就是耶稣写的
Either it's me writing the words or it's Jesus.

674
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,901
有什麽事吗 马侃？
What do you want, Malcolm?

675

I wanted to make sure you'd be in.

用这个新名字开启全新人生
A new name for the beginning of a new life.

681
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:06,590
我的新名字是‥

682
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,138
－埃德加爱伦坡？ －没错

683
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:16,392
这个‥

684
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:20,562
马侃 这个名字很显然不能用
Yeah. Malcolm, I obviously can't use this name.

685
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:21,689
为什麽不能？
Why not?

686
00:41:21,772 --> 00:41:24,191
我希望这是玩笑 但我知道你不来这套
I'm hoping this is a joke,but I know you, so it's probably not.

687
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,317
什麽玩笑？
What joke?

688
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:32,157
好吧 埃德加爱伦坡 是一个知名的‥

like a...like a very famous American novelist and poet.

690
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:36,245
从没听过他
Never heard of him.

691
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,788
我跟你打包票
Well, I assure you,

692
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:41,709
埃德加爱伦坡 是一个大红大紫的‥

693
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,585
我很喜欢的美国作家

694
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:46,797
埃德加是我想的 是我祖父的名字
It was me that came up with Edgar.It's my grandad's name.

695
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,175
－那爱伦坡又是谁想的？ －派遣部的马丁
-So who came up with the "Allen Poe" part? -Martin in dispatch.

696
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:51,427
该死
Fuck.

697
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,138
派遣部的马丁讨厌我
Martin in dispatch hates me.

698
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:57,683
他故意要让我别扭 害我不好过
He's deliberately suggested this to make my life strange and unbearable.

699
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,685
但识别证已经做好了
Well, the card's already been laminated.

700
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:03,731
马侃 我不能这样 走进西区的高级百货
Malcolm, I can't go into expensive department stores

701
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:05,858
还期望他们信任我
in the West End, right,and expect them to entrust me

702
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,027
让我保护高价衣服和珠宝
with valuable clothing and jewelry,

703
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,321
我的名字是该死的埃德加爱伦坡
and tell them that my name is Edgar Allen fucking Poe!

704
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:14,033
他若那麽有名 我怎麽没听过？
If he's so famous, how come I've never heard of him?

705
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:16,535
－因为你不看书 －我会看《圣经》
-'Cause you don't read books! -I read the Good Book.

706
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:18,662
他是美国人 当然不在圣经裡
But he's not in the Bible, obviously. He's an American.

707
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:23,375
有人听过 叫埃德加爱伦坡的作家吗？
Anybody here ever heard of a writer

708
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:22,692


709

－该死的东西 －没听过？
-called Edgar Allan Poe? -No?

710
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:27,296

-No one. There you go. -I know there's no one there.

大家都在家工作

好吧 我承认‥
All right, look, I grant you that 90%

715
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:41,101
西区九成的夜班保全
of the security guards working the night shift

716
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:43,312
不知道埃德加爱伦坡是谁
in the West End would not have heard of Edgar Allan Poe.

717
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:46,482
－把他们当机器搞定就行了 －但我很倒霉
-Basically dealing with robots. -But I am an unlucky person.

720
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:57,076
－全装在一个信封裡 －就算我承认‥
-It's all in the envelope. -By some chance,

721
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:01,413
这个忧郁 内省的黑暗传播者
choosing the name of a gloomy,introspective peddler of darkness is actually

722
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:03,207
名字跟我挺搭
quite appropriate to my character,

723
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,625
但我拜托你
but please...

724
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:09,129
给我换一张不同名的识别证
just give me a new card under a different name.

725
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:12,508
机器人才不管你叫啥名字 只会看照片
The robots don't give a fuck about the name,they just look at the photo.

726
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:16,261
今晚六点到塞尔福裡的卸货口Ｂ
You are due at Selfridges' loading bay B at 1800 hours tonight.

Wear your uniform with your name tag.

728

我不能再闯祸了 好吗？
I can't get into trouble again, all right?

731
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:27,648
我可能会被冠上‥
This could be construed as deception

732
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,692
诈欺以及窃盗未遂罪
and attempted robbery.

733
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:33,612
你要浪费我的时间 我就不跟你耗了 混帐

No need to sign. I know him.

739
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:03,058
你是他太太吗？
Are you his other half?

740
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:04,977
是的 我是
Yes, yes, I am.

741

－他很无趣 对吧？ －对
-He's so dry, isn't he? -Yes, he is.

742

你好 帕斯顿
Hello, Paxton.

743
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,568
我正说到你很幽默
I was just saying you're very funny.

744
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,695
我知道 我超搞笑
Yes, I am. I am hilarious.

745
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:17,656
你开货车真是大材小用了
We think he's too clever to be driving vans.

746
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,117
不懂你为何不找个更好的工作
We don't know why he doesn't get a better job.

747
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,326
答案很简单
Well, that's easy.

748
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,414
愚蠢如我 十年前在 沃福的飞车党餐馆揍了人
It's 'cause ten years ago, I beat a man senseless in a bikers' roadhouse in Watford.

749
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:28,834
看吧？ 他老是说蠢话
See?He's always saying silly things.

750
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,502
超没哏的
He's so dry.

751
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:32,921
帮我跟马丁问好 薇吉妮雅
Give my regards to Martin, would you, Virginia?

752
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:36,508
－告诉他 我记下了 －好
-Tell him this won't be forgotten. -Okay.

753
00:44:36,592 --> 00:44:38,177
等疯狂的时期结束再见了
See you when the madness is over.

754
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,263
对某些人来说 疯狂是家常便饭
Yeah, well, for some of us, the madness never ends.

755
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:50,314
记住 被你揍是他活该
Never forget, the man you beat senseless deserved it.

756
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,274
那不是你能决定的
Please don't talk about people deserving things.

757
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:55,069
若不是你 那个叫 阿契布鲁斯的小家伙早死了
If it wasn't for you, a little man called Archie Bruce would be dead.

758
00:44:55,152 --> 00:44:56,904
所以呢 我要击鼓申冤吗？
What you want, justice next?

759
00:44:57,488 --> 00:44:59,698
我知道你摔了大跟头
I know that you had a bad break,

760
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:01,533
－但你得振作‥ －振作？
- but going forward... - "Going forward"?

761
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:03,077
封城结束我们就会分开
When lockdown is over and we are apart,

762
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,579
拜托你不要再怨天尤人了
you have to stop believing that fate is against you. Okay?

763
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:08,415
别再怪”帕斯顿” 这个名字害你倒霉
You have to stop believing the name Paxton

764
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:12,002
”埃德加爱伦坡” 但我不叫帕斯顿
is a precursor of doom.Yes, well, my name isn't Paxton.

765
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:14,797
没错
Yeah.

766
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:22,096
{\an8}公对公 埃德加爱伦坡

767
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:35,234
帕斯顿 那行不通 你会被抓的
Paxton, you can't go through with this, you're gonna get caught.

768
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,695
你想要钱我可以给你
If you're doing it for cash, I'll give you the cash.

769
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,571
我不是为了钱
I am not doing it for the cash.

770
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:42,866
－不然呢？ －我是为了过更好的生活
-Otherwise? -I'm doing it for the opportunity to have a better life.

771
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,493
这干你什麽事？
But why am I telling you?

772
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:53,836
”埃德加爱伦坡” 该死
Paxton.Fuck.

773
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:34,626
管他们去死
Fuck 'em.

774
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:41,425
琳达好像很抽离
And Linda seemed kind of detached from the whole thing.

775
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,261
很抽离？
Detached?

776
00:46:44,345 --> 00:46:46,555
－你好 琳达 －我们正好聊到你
-Hi, Linda. -We were talking about you.

777
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:49,224
我们很敬佩你的敬业精神
We were all just saying that we love that you're always so professional.

778
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:51,185
等等 很抽离是什麽意思？
Detached from what whole thing?

779
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:56,774
我的意思是 你处理壹凡资一事时很理性
I was saying you handled the situation with Events without too much feeling getting in the way.

780
00:46:57,983 --> 00:46:59,401
你很会开除人
You fired them well.

781
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:03,030
的确 多谢称赞
I did. Thank you.

782
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:04,156
很好
Good.

783
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:09,244
琳达 你在喝葡萄酒吗？
Linda, is that a glass of wine?

784
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,455
是啊 这个嘛‥
Oh, yes, yeah, it is.

785
00:47:12,164 --> 00:47:15,417
标签上写葡萄酒 但喝起来像清洁用液体
it says wine on the label but it tastes like something used to clean something off of a surface.

786
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:18,253
－帕斯顿选的 －帕斯顿是哪位？
-Paxton chose it. -Who's Paxton?

787
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:19,463
回归正题
Mmm, anyway...

788
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,799
我们有问题得解决 开始吧
we have a problem, so shall we get on?

789
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,015
你好 马丁
Hello, Martin.

790
00:47:30,683 --> 00:47:32,267
你好 埃德加
Hello, Edgar.

791
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,938
自我加入公司以来对你的观察
You know, from my observation of you since I joined the company,

792
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:40,943
你打破神经衰弱发作 最完美又最持久的纪录了
you represent the longest and most well-managed nervous breakdown in history.

793
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:43,612
还不快进屋裡发你的牢骚
Why don't you go somewhere warm and count your grievances?

794
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:46,031
我帮你消毒好厢型车了
I've disinfected the van for you.

795
00:47:46,115 --> 00:47:47,950
你需要的都在这裡面
Everything you need is in there.

796
00:47:49,535 --> 00:47:52,996
马侃说要给你二区的安全许可时
You know, when Malcolm told me he was giving you an A2 security clearance,

797
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,665
我跟他说最好不要
I advised him against it.

798
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:59,461
公对公不让你这种败类罪犯 处理高价货物是有道理的
B2B normally keep lowlifes like you away from high-value cargo for a reason...

799
00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:03,716
－受不了诱惑 －你忘记放车钥匙了 马丁
-Temptation. -You forgot to put the keys to the van inside the envelope, Martin.

800
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:07,511
我看了你的人资档案
I've read your human resources profile.

801
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,432
我的个人经历应该是机密才对
My personal record is meant to be confidential,

802
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:13,559
但更新一下你的资讯 马丁
but for your personal record, Martin,

803
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:16,020
我跟以前不同了 把该死的钥匙拿来
I'm a different person now. Give me the fucking keys.

804
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:17,688
马侃可能没跟你说
Perhaps Malcolm didn't tell you.

805
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:22,818
今晚塞尔福裡的货 估价是五万英镑
The estimated value of tonight's cargo out of Selfridges is ￡50,000.

806
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:25,487
你周五从夏菲尼高运的那批
The value of your collection from Harvey Nichols on Friday

807
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:27,239
将近十万
is just under ￡100,000.

808
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:30,492
但周六晚上你要去哈洛德
But on Saturday night,when you go to Harrods,

809
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:33,871
从世上最奢侈的百货公司运货
you'll be driving away from the world's most glamorous department store

810
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:38,834
载著超过三百万英镑的 珠宝跟饰品离开
with jewelry and accessories in your van worth over three million pounds.

811
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,837
想想看 你会戴著口罩和手套
Now think on this.You'll be wearing a mask and gloves,

812
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,881
用假身份
you'll be using a false identity.

813
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,424
街上空无一人
Outside, the streets will be empty.

814
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:49,303
商店区的保全缺勤 处处是漏洞
Store security on quarter staff with big holes caused by absences.

815
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:52,598
根本是罪犯窃盗的最佳时机
What more could a lowlife need to pull off the perfect robbery.

816
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:54,933
你敢再叫我罪犯一次‥
You refer to me as "lowlife" one more time...

817
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:57,227
你就怎样 犯罪吗？
You'll what? Revert to type.

818
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:59,313
好吧 我再说一次
Okay, here goes, one more time.

819
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:00,814
罪犯
Lowlife.

820
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:05,027
马侃说接下来几晚 你若干得不错
You know, Malcolm told me that if you do okay in the next few nights,

821
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,321
他就要把你调去客服
he's gonna put you in customer services.

822
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:09,406
出去见客户
Goin' out and meeting clients.

823
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,283
因为你又酷又幽默
'Cause you're so funny

824
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:13,202
超会逗女生
and you're so dry and you make the girls laugh.

825
00:49:13,911 --> 00:49:16,955
而我却困在派遣部七年半
Whereas I've been stuck in dispatches for seven and a half years.

826
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,958
别老觉得全世界跟你有仇 马丁
You have to stop thinking the whole world's against you, Martin.

827
00:49:23,837 --> 00:49:25,130
下手吧 帕斯顿
Do it, Paxton.

828
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:29,301
顺从天意 接纳你的命运
Take the opportunity that fate has given you.

829
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:35,766
{\an8}公对公专业货运公司

830
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:40,354
伊芙许沃 在哈洛德的商品总价多少？
Exactly how much product do Eve Schwarz have in Harrods?

831
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:43,107
大约三百万英镑的珠宝和饰品
Uh, approximately three million pounds' jewelry and accessories.

832
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,068
我们要负责帮哈洛德全部清空
Harrods wants everything out of the store and it's our responsibility...

833
00:49:46,652 --> 00:49:48,404
你停格了 琳达
Oh, you've frozen, Linda.

834
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:49,947
听得到吗？
Can you hear me?

835
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:52,991
听得到 只是画面定格了
Yeah, I can hear you, just your face is frozen.

836
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:56,787
卡在你恼火的表情
You've got this look of exasperation.

837
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:00,958
因为得有人去哈洛德打包商品
Uh, someone's gonna have to go into Harrods and pack the valuables up

838
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:04,003
清点并剔除多余的品项
and check the inventory and count everything out.

839
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:05,504
而且要找值得信赖的人
And it's gonna have to be someone that we trust.

840
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:08,966
必须熟悉存货 还有哈洛德的运作方式
Someone who is familiar with the stock,and knows how the Harrods system works.

841
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:11,593
所以那个人就是我 对吧？
So that means, inevitably, it's going to be me, isn't it?

842
00:50:11,677 --> 00:50:14,555
好吧 但打给你还有另一个目的
Okay, but there's this, another second reason for this call.

843
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:17,641
麦克埃辛决定给你升迁
Michael Essien has decided. He wants to give you a promotion.

844
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:19,643
他想调你回老家
He wants to bring you home.

845
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:23,272
回纽约管理东岸
Back to New York to run the East Coast.

846
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,650
天啊
Wow, God. Um...

847
00:50:27,151 --> 00:50:28,694
很兴奋吧？
Exciting.

848
00:50:28,777 --> 00:50:31,864
的确是跟便宜葡萄酒 很不搭调的惊喜
A unexpected turn of events and cheap wine don't pair well together.

849
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:35,284
我得好好考虑一下这件事
Um, I'm gonna have to, uh, really think about this.

850
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:37,494
好吧 晚安
Uh, right, good night.

851
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:39,997
我是指谢谢‥
Yeah, thank you.

852
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,415
看来琳达很激动‥
Linda, it's exciting...

853
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:48,422
卡在恼火的表情
A frozen look of exasperation.

854
00:50:48,922 --> 00:50:54,261
那就是他的二儿子 卡尔菲利普艾曼纽巴哈
...and that is his second son, Carl Philipp Emauel Bach

855
00:50:54,345 --> 00:50:56,221
请聆听他的第四号交响曲
and here's his Symphony No. 4.

856
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:59,702
昨晚通话后 我们有点担心 帕斯顿的心理状态
It's just that after our call last night,we became worried about Paxton's state of mind.

857
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:01,745
他可能会内爆或是爆发
We worry that he might implode or explode.

858
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:04,331
我们认识的帕斯顿大概是内爆
Knowing Paxton, he'll probably implode rather than explode.

859
00:52:04,415 --> 00:52:06,959
－有什麽差别？ －内爆的人会封闭自己
-What's the difference? -When you implode, you withdraw within yourself,

860
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:09,545
爆发则是向外宣洩
when you explode, you impose yourself on the outer world.

861
00:52:09,628 --> 00:52:12,673
拿大卫来说 他生气时会内爆
David, for example, when he gets angry, he implodes.

862
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:15,718
－但我生气时会爆发 －必要时我也会爆发
-When I get angry, I explode. - I can also explode if I have to.

863
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:18,137
－很少吧 －你肯定没看我开过商务会议
- Rarely. -You've obviously never seen me in business meetings.

864
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,805
封城后我其实看过
Well, actually I have. Since lockdown.

865
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:21,306
你只是隔牆听 没看
You've heard me through the wall, you haven't seen me.

866
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,893
好吧 我没”听”过你爆发 我其实很意外‥
Okay, then, I haven't heard you explode.I've actually been very surprised

867
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:27,604
－你在会议上那麽听话 －听话？
-about how submissive you are in meetings. - Submissive?

868
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:29,773
老板要有老板的样子 大卫
You're the boss, David, you should act like the boss.

869
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:32,818
好吧 我只是想说帕斯顿没事
Anyway, just to reassure you, Paxton's okay.

870
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:35,404
而且他可能要升迁了
In fact, Paxton maybe getting a promotion.

871
00:52:36,113 --> 00:52:38,157
琳达 你一个人喝酒吗？
Linda, are you drinking alone?

872
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,993
没有 厨房有三个消防员在等我
No, I've got three firemen waiting for me in the kitchen.

873
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:43,579
封城后大卫开始狂喝
Since lockdown, David has been drinking so much more.

874
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:47,708
干得好 大卫 感觉很好吧？
Yes, David, isn't it wonderful?

875
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:50,127
我们现在会计算酒瓶量
We now keep a record. We count the bottles.

876
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,004
－我其实不在乎 －但你的身体在乎
- I don't care. - Your body cares.

877
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:54,757
你的肝髒一瓶一瓶记著呢
Your body counts the bottles and keeps an inventory in you liver.

878
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,176
大卫 我的酒友啊
David, my fellow drinker,

879
00:52:57,259 --> 00:52:59,303
跟你说个秘密
I'd like to tell you a secret.

880
00:52:59,386 --> 00:53:01,597
－什麽秘密？ －听著 琳达
- What secret? - You know, Linda,

881
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,018
我喝了几杯酒 隔天醒来后的反应通常是
my life where I've had a few glasses of wine and in the next morning,

882
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:08,437
”天啊 我不该说那种话”
I woke up like, "Golly. Wow. I wish I hadn't said that."

883
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,231
我也常常那样
Oh, I've done that so many times, too.

884
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:14,735
我的座右铭是 别用秘密配葡萄酒
You know, my mantra is, secrets and wine don't go great together.

885
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:16,987
－让她讲完秘密 －他会喜欢这个秘密
- Let her tell me the secret. -I think he's gonna like this secret.

886
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:19,365
－你会喜欢这个秘密 大卫 －你不懂他喜欢什麽
-I think you're gonna like this secret, David, very much. -Something he's gonna like, you don't know.

887
00:53:19,448 --> 00:53:21,450
－他可能不喜欢 －你们到底在讲什麽？
- No, he might not. - What the fuck are you two talking about?

888
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:24,620
他现在不正常 他会看福斯
He might not be in a place where it's okay. He watches Fox.

889
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:28,165
是我要买帕斯顿的重机
It is I who am buying Paxton's motorbike.

890
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:31,669
什麽？
What?

891
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:36,131
他说要卖时 我就安排了匿名的买家
When he said he was selling it,I arranged a dealer to buy it anonymously.

892
00:53:36,215 --> 00:53:38,467
我要买下来还给他
I'm gonna buy it and give it back to him.

893
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,052
作为分手礼物
My parting gift.

894
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,435
我知道我必须离开他 但‥
For a while I've known I had to leave him.But...

895
00:53:50,813 --> 00:53:54,108
但失去重机是件大事
But losing the bike, yeah, that's too much.

896
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:57,736
而且我也重视那辆重机
And the bike means something to me, too.

897
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,946
青春嘛
You know, youth.

898
00:53:59,655 --> 00:54:05,619
香烟跟帕斯顿选的超烂葡萄酒
Cigarettes. Bad, bad wine chosen by Paxton.

899
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:12,960
－琳达 那很好 －大卫 我想要你跟他说
- But here's the thing, David. I want you to tell him - Linda, that's awesome.

900
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:15,004
重机是你买的 由你还给他
that it's you who is buying the bike and giving it back to him.

901
00:54:15,087 --> 00:54:16,922
别让他知道是我
I don't want him to know that it's me.

902
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:19,675
为什麽？
Why?

903
00:54:21,635 --> 00:54:23,095
这样他好受一点
It'll hurt him less.

904
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:26,306
他挺古板的
He really is quite prehistoric.

905
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:29,018
我有点醉了 而且‥
I'm a bit drunk and I hate people

906
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:30,936
我讨厌为了这种事哭哭啼啼
who get emotional on these things,

907
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,062
我先‥
so...

908
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:55,586
该死
Fuck.

909
00:55:09,683 --> 00:55:11,643
为国家健保局欢呼
Making noise for the

910
00:55:11,727 --> 00:55:15,689
国家健保局‥
NHS.

911
00:55:15,773 --> 00:55:19,526
你现在聆听的是 贝多芬第三号钢琴协奏曲
We've got Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3.

912
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:09,535
睡不著
Couldn't sleep.

913
00:56:10,536 --> 00:56:13,497
喝酒没用 就去舔花园的罂粟吧
If the wine didn't work, go and lick the garden.

914
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:16,250
今晚如何？
How was it tonight?

915
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,213
我遇到的保全都是小学生
Every security person I met was under the age of 12,

916
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:23,340
大家都忙著打电玩
and every one of them was too busy playing Fortnite

917
00:56:23,424 --> 00:56:25,384
没空仔细核实身份
to fully acknowledge my ID.

918
00:56:25,467 --> 00:56:29,221
对年轻一代来说 文学巨作就是木乃伊
Anyway, I think for the young generation, great literature is dead.

919
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:32,599
依我看 识别证上写 ”威廉莎士比亚”也能过关
I could have had an ID card with William Shakespeare on it.

920
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:35,477
你还要送几趟？
How many more pick-ups do you have?

921
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:37,938
明天要去夏菲尼高接一件
Um, tomorrow, Harvey Nichols

922
00:56:38,022 --> 00:56:40,482
周六哈洛德一件
and then, Saturday, Harrods.

923
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:43,485
周六去哈洛德？
Harrods? Saturday night?

924
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:45,154
外面一片混乱
It's all gone mad out there.

925
00:56:45,738 --> 00:56:47,990
有个保全告诉我
One of the security guards was telling me about franchise managers

926
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:53,245
加盟经理把鑽戒和手表 装进塑胶袋
are taking out diamond rings and watches in plastic bags

927
00:56:53,328 --> 00:56:54,872
然后叫车离开
and getting into Ubers.

928
00:56:54,955 --> 00:56:56,874
你要去哈洛德百货接什麽货？
What are you taking out of Harrods?

929
00:56:56,957 --> 00:57:00,627
不知道 马丁说东西 价值超过三百万英镑
I don't know.Martin says it's over three million pounds worth.

930
00:57:00,711 --> 00:57:02,629
因为疫情关系 没有副驾驶
No co-drivers 'cause of COVID.

931
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:04,214
要载去哪裡？
Carrying it to where?

932
00:57:05,549 --> 00:57:08,802
移交纪录说是希斯洛机场 十点飞纽约的班机
Uh, the docket says Heathrow. Ten o'clock flight to New York.

933
00:57:08,886 --> 00:57:11,138
哈洛德百货到希斯洛 周六晚上
Harrods to Heathrow, Saturday night,

934
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:13,390
三百万英镑 十点的班机
three million pounds, ten o'clock flight.

935
00:57:13,474 --> 00:57:15,184
快看 刺蝟在那边
Look, there's the hedgehog.

936
00:57:17,978 --> 00:57:19,480
跑掉了
Oh, no, he's gone.

937
00:57:21,106 --> 00:57:22,399
不见了
Ah, he's gone.

938
00:57:24,568 --> 00:57:26,028
你今晚过得如何？
How was your evening?

939
00:57:27,112 --> 00:57:29,281
帕斯顿 听我说
Okay, um, Paxton. Here it is.

940
00:57:29,365 --> 00:57:31,909
你周六晚上 不能去哈洛德接货
You can't do that pick-up at Harrods on Saturday.

941
00:57:31,992 --> 00:57:34,495
真的不行
You really can't.

942
00:57:34,578 --> 00:57:35,621
你在说什麽？
What are you talking about?

943
00:57:35,704 --> 00:57:38,540
记得吗 我曾问过 你信不信上帝
Okay, do you remember once I asked you,do you believe in God,

944
00:57:38,624 --> 00:57:42,252
你说你认为 祂在忙别的企划
and you said that you believe that he's busy on another project,

945
00:57:42,336 --> 00:57:44,004
但偶尔会关注一下这个世界
but occasionally he puts his head around the door?

946
00:57:44,088 --> 00:57:45,714
我认为这就是那种状况
Well, I think this may be one of those occasions,

947
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:50,761
因为神 命运或病毒 或什麽人让我们困在一起
'cause God or fate or the virus or somebody put our paths on the cross.

948
00:57:51,345 --> 00:57:55,474
星期六 我会在哈洛德 打包你要运送的货物
On Saturday, I will be in Harrods packing up the cargo that you are due to carry.

949
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:57,184
该死
Fuck.

950
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:58,769
你在说什麽‥？
What are you talkin' about? I...

951
00:57:59,603 --> 00:58:01,897
我必须去载货
I have to do the pick-up.

952
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,691
你若去就会被逮到
If you do, you will be caught.

953
00:58:03,774 --> 00:58:05,693
你用什麽名字都没差 那是假名
It doesn't matter what name you're using.

954
00:58:05,776 --> 00:58:08,445
我让系统进行交叉检查 你根本进不了门
It's a fake name and I have implemented cross-checks.You won't make it past the door.

955
00:58:08,529 --> 00:58:12,241
我知道 因为会是我的系统挡下你
I know, because it's my system that will stop you!

956
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:21,834
对不起 该死 什麽都别说
I'm sorry. And what the fuck, don't even begin.

957
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:24,712
我哪儿都去不成
I can't fucking get anywhere!

958
00:58:29,717 --> 00:58:31,301
我是说‥
I mean...

959
00:58:31,885 --> 00:58:34,638
你不能就告诉他们 你认识我吗？
Can't you just tell them that you know me?

960
00:58:34,722 --> 00:58:37,474
就说你知道能信任我 我是‥
That you know I can be trusted. That I am your...

961
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:41,270
我曾是你的伴侣
That I was your partner.

962
00:58:45,399 --> 00:58:47,401
－干嘛啦？ －不能那样做事
- What? - It doesn't work like that.

963
00:58:47,484 --> 00:58:49,111
而且我‥
And I...

964
00:58:51,196 --> 00:58:54,867
自三年前进了米拉克后 我都没跟人提过我有伴侣
Since joining Miracore three years ago,I haven't told anyone I have a partner.

965
00:58:55,576 --> 00:58:58,370
部分是因为我想区分公私
Partly because I wanted to keep work separate.

966
00:58:58,454 --> 00:59:02,249
但主要是你觉得 伴侣开货车很丢脸
Yeah, but mostly because you were embarrassed to have a partner that drives a van.

967
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,211
对 以上都是
Yes. All of the above. I...

968
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:09,423
但现在我在自省
But now, I am looking at myself.

969
00:59:09,506 --> 00:59:11,216
自封城后 我好好自省
Since lockdown, I'm looking back at myself

970
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,135
区分了过去与现在的心态
like that was then and this is now.

971
00:59:13,218 --> 00:59:16,305
很好啊 琳达 但我周六晚上若不去载货
Well, good for you, Linda,but if I don't make this collection on Saturday night,

972
00:59:16,388 --> 00:59:19,767
马侃不只不会帮我升职
then, not only will Malcolm not promote me,

973
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,602
他会开除我
he will fire me.

974
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,481
我总可以开始卖海洛因
I could always start dealing heroin.

975
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:28,484
败类就是败类
Lowlife is lowlife.

976
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:34,823
没工作 没机车
No job. No bike.

977
00:59:36,992 --> 00:59:38,577
也没有你
No you.

978
00:59:50,047 --> 00:59:52,633
我在哈洛德百货工作时很开心
When I worked at Harrods, I had so much fun.

979
00:59:53,425 --> 00:59:55,761
我和大家都互相认识
I knew everyone. Everyone knew me.

980
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:58,514
－很多人都还在‥ －话题能不能先回到我身上？
Most of them still work there... -Is there any possibility

981
00:59:58,597 --> 01:00:01,558
－完蛋的是我 －不是的 这的确跟你有关
-we might get back to me for a moment? -No, no, this is about you.

982
01:00:01,642 --> 01:00:03,519
我认识所有保全
All right, I know all the security guards, everyone.

983
01:00:03,602 --> 01:00:06,522
－我很了解保全系统 －所以呢？
- I know the security systems. - So?

984
01:00:06,605 --> 01:00:10,275
所以有办法让你去哈洛德接货 并安全送到希斯洛机场
So there is a way for you to make your pick-up deliver to Heathrow without getting caught.

985
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:12,528
你能够升迁 我也能搬走存货
You will get your promotion and I will get my stock removed

986
01:00:12,611 --> 01:00:13,737
没人会知情
and no one will know.

987
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:15,656
但那样会违法
But we will be breaking the law.

988
01:00:15,739 --> 01:00:20,160
所以你要完全照我说的做
So you're gonna have to do absolutely everything I tell you to do.

989
01:00:44,143 --> 01:00:46,979
我是麦可摩根 哈洛德活动保全副组长
Michael Morgan. Acting Deputy Head, Harrods' Events Security.

990
01:00:47,062 --> 01:00:48,981
对 你在我以前的部门
Yes, you are in my old department.

991
01:00:49,064 --> 01:00:50,607
在哈洛德过得如何？
How's life at Harrods?

992
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:53,193
我才刚加入 我以前在海军
I only just joined. I used to be in the Royal Navy.

993
01:00:53,277 --> 01:00:55,154
差别满大的呢
Oh, quite a change then.

994
01:00:55,237 --> 01:00:57,573
也不会 哈洛德就像是一艘大船
Not really. No, Harrods is like a big ship.

995
01:00:57,656 --> 01:00:59,074
了解
Oh. Okay.

996
01:00:59,158 --> 01:01:01,660
当然是有些很大的差别
I mean, there are, obviously, huge differences.

997
01:01:01,744 --> 01:01:02,870
当然了
Of course.

998
01:01:02,953 --> 01:01:05,497
是啊 不只是建筑物的形状
Yeah, and not just in terms of the shape of the building

999
01:01:05,581 --> 01:01:08,167
或是百货不会漂浮这点
or the fact that it doesn't float.

1000
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,377
－就是‥ －对
- You know, it's... - Oh, yeah.

1001
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:12,588
工作环境一定很不一样
Yeah, the working environment must be very different, I imagine.

1002
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:14,423
没错 这儿很多女性
Yes, it is. Lot of women here.

1003
01:01:14,965 --> 01:01:16,216
对‥
Yes.

1004
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,302
船上只有四位女性
Yeah, on the ship, there was only four.

1005
01:01:18,385 --> 01:01:20,095
其中两位都叫凯伦
And, uh, two of them were called Karen.

1006
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:22,264
我们叫她们 凯伦一号和二号
Called them Karen one and Karen two.

1007
01:01:22,348 --> 01:01:23,891
凯特好像应该出席？
I think Kate's meant to be joining us?

1008
01:01:23,974 --> 01:01:25,517
对 壹凡资的凯特史密斯
Kate Smith, yes, from Events.

1009
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:27,519
我们认识时她还姓怀利 她一定是结婚了
When I knew her, she was Kate Wiley.She must have gotten married.

1010
01:01:27,603 --> 01:01:30,814
她的确结婚了 但婚姻好像很糟
Yeah, she did get married, yeah, but it all went horribly wrong, I think.

1011
01:01:31,523 --> 01:01:33,817
真是遗憾 不知道发生什麽事了
Oh, sorry to hear that.What happened?

1012
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:36,111
不知道 他们不跟我聊那种事
I don't know. They don't talk to me about that sort of thing.

1013
01:01:36,779 --> 01:01:37,821
琳达
Linda!

1014
01:01:37,905 --> 01:01:39,323
凯蒂？
Katie!

1015
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:40,991
天啊‥你好吗？
Oh my God, Oh, my God. How are you?

1016
01:01:41,075 --> 01:01:44,912
－天哪 你也知道‥ －琳达 你简直扶摇直上
-Oh, my gosh. You know, I'm surviving. -Linda, you have gone off like a rocket!

1017
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:46,288
－少来啦 －我的老天
- Oh, stop. - I mean, my God.

1018
01:01:46,372 --> 01:01:49,875
当他们提到米拉克总裁 我以为会是个秃头男
When they said CEO Miracore,I thought, "Okay, God, some bald man,"

1019
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,251
但接著我看到你的名字
but then I saw your name.

1020
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:53,921
琳达刚刚问到 你的婚姻怎麽了
Linda was just asking what went wrong with your marriage. She...

1021
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:58,008
没有 我没问‥
No. No, no, no. I wasn't. I didn't.

1022
01:01:58,092 --> 01:01:59,635
当男人比你矮
When a man is shorter than you

1023
01:01:59,718 --> 01:02:02,971
又突然决定要留大胡子
and then suddenly decides to let his beard grow very, very long

1024
01:02:03,055 --> 01:02:05,349
接著又迷上所谓的”白魔法”
and then becomes obsessed with so called "white magic,"

1025
01:02:05,432 --> 01:02:07,643
很快就会变得很诡异
it can just get very creepy very quickly.

1026
01:02:07,726 --> 01:02:09,436
回归正题 我们能如何为你效劳？
Anyway, what can we do for you?

1027
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,897
我接到周六 伊芙许沃清出库存的消息
I have an update about the Eve Schwarz clear-out on Saturday.

1028
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:16,151
所有安全的货运公司都订满了 看来我们的物流部门慢了一步
You see, all the secure freight companies have been booked and it looks like our logistics

1029
01:02:16,235 --> 01:02:17,611
伊芙许沃 米拉克 请看资料
Eve Schwarz, Miracore. Here it is.

1030
01:02:17,695 --> 01:02:19,488
他们预约了 我没用过的货运公司
They've booked a freight company that I've never used before,

1031
01:02:19,571 --> 01:02:20,948
所以我很担忧
so that's why I'm anxious.

1032
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:23,450
标莱姆绿的‥
Lime green is the color and, uh...

1033
01:02:23,534 --> 01:02:26,954
－你担心那家货运公司？ －会有绿色箭头指向‥
-So you're anxious about the freight company? -It's gonna be green arrows pointing...

1034
01:02:27,037 --> 01:02:28,372
如果可以的话
So if it's okay with you,

1035
01:02:28,455 --> 01:02:31,375
我了解哈洛德的保全系统 我想亲自检查司机
I know the Harrods security system and I'd like to run the checks on the driver myself.

1036
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,836
不用啦 那是伊姆兰的工作
Oh, no, no, that's Imran's job. That's...

1037
01:02:33,919 --> 01:02:35,254
记得伊姆兰吗 琳达？
Do you remember Imran, Linda?

1038
01:02:35,337 --> 01:02:37,423
－我好喜欢他‥ －他现在是壹凡资保全主管
-I love Imran... -Imran is now head of Events security.

1039
01:02:37,506 --> 01:02:40,050
－他是麦可的上司 －你有什麽问题我都能处理
-He's Michael's boss. -You got any questions. I can handle everything.

1040
01:02:40,134 --> 01:02:42,970
－我现在传简讯给他 －不用 拿箭头的是我‥
-Let me text him now. -Don't, I'm gonna be the one with the arrows. So...

1041
01:02:45,973 --> 01:02:47,099
好了 搞定
Okay. Done.

1042
01:02:47,182 --> 01:02:49,852
明天我亲自用系统跑你的资料 然后让你进入百货
Tomorrow, I'll run you through the system myself and then get you into the store.

1043
01:02:49,935 --> 01:02:51,186
在那之后还能出什麽错？
After that, what can go wrong?

1044
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,063
太棒了 感谢
Hey, great. Thanks.

1045
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:56,191
真的很感谢你为我这麽做
I really appreciate you doing this for me.

1046
01:02:58,444 --> 01:03:00,612
－怎麽了？ －我不知道
- What's the matter? - I don't know.

1047
01:03:01,155 --> 01:03:03,032
日子过得很快
Days are passing quickly.

1048
01:03:04,742 --> 01:03:08,162
我今早醒来时 第一次深深意识到这点
When I woke up this morning,it really hit me for the first time.

1049
01:03:08,912 --> 01:03:11,623
我意识到了此时的现实
The reality of what's happening hit me.

1050
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:15,002
封城总有一天会结束
The lockdown will eventually end.

1051
01:03:15,794 --> 01:03:17,338
然后‥
Then...

1052
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:20,758
我就会失去此生挚爱
the love of my life will be gone.

1053
01:03:22,926 --> 01:03:26,138
帕斯顿 你会放下这件事的 你会走出情伤
Paxton, you will move on from this. You will heal.

1054
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:28,599
我的人生会多出巨大的空缺
There'll be a huge hole in my life.

1055
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:32,644
你会改变与成长
You'll change and grow. And...

1056
01:03:34,438 --> 01:03:36,357
最后你会‥
Eventually you'll...

1057
01:03:37,066 --> 01:03:38,525
你会遇见新对象
you'll meet someone else.

1058
01:03:44,323 --> 01:03:46,784
你说的是那辆机车 对吧？
You were talking about the bike, weren't you?

1059
01:03:46,867 --> 01:03:48,535
对 干嘛问？
Yeah. Why?

1060
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:54,541
那辆机车是我人生的挚爱之一
The bike is one of the loves of my life.

1061
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:57,127
－而我是空缺？ －你当然是最大的空缺
-And I am one of the holes? -Obviously you're the biggest hole.

1062
01:03:57,211 --> 01:03:58,796
真是谢谢你
Oh, why, thank you.

1063
01:04:00,756 --> 01:04:02,716
我今天本来要牵车出去
I was gonna take the bike out today.

1064
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:05,636
街上空无一人
The streets are completely deserted.

1065
01:04:06,303 --> 01:04:08,764
我本来要趁封城疯最后一回
I was gonna call it "Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1066
01:04:09,556 --> 01:04:10,974
我想说‥
I thought maybe...

1067
01:04:13,185 --> 01:04:14,645
我不能跟你去 帕斯顿
Oh, no, I can't go with you, Paxton.

1068
01:04:14,728 --> 01:04:16,480
我有场重要的会议
No. I have an important meeting.

1069
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:23,654
开阔的道路和一颗破碎的心
An open road and a broken heart.

1070
01:04:25,155 --> 01:04:26,699
骑车小心点
Don't kill yourself.

1071
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:33,872
－琳达 －麦克
- Linda! - Michael.

1072
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,333
你都还好吗？
How are you coping?

1073
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:38,711
挺不好过的
You know, it's been quite difficult.

1074
01:04:39,712 --> 01:04:40,963
完全能想像
I can imagine.

1075
01:04:41,046 --> 01:04:42,506
我在山顶上隔离
You know, I'm locked up on a mountaintop

1076
01:04:42,589 --> 01:04:44,717
只有老鹰 熊 还有家人跟我作伴
with only eagles and bears and my family for company.

1077
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,885
拜托别自杀
Please don't kill yourself.

1078
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:48,095
什麽？
What?

1079
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:51,181
我说能有独处时间一定很棒
I said it must be nice to have time to yourself.

1080
01:04:51,265 --> 01:04:56,270
总之 在我们讨论 你回到纽约的重大决定前
Anyway, before we get on to the exciting business decision to come home to New York,

1081
01:04:56,353 --> 01:04:59,732
有个好消息 哈裡斯鑽石有买家了
the good news is that we have found a buyer for the Harris Diamond.

1082
01:04:59,815 --> 01:05:01,150
其实我还没决定要回纽约
Uh, actually, I haven't decided to come home to New York.

1083
01:05:01,233 --> 01:05:04,737
买家在线上介绍看到鑽石
The buyer saw the diamond on the virtual presentation

1084
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,989
就是你在发表会前做的介绍
that you put together ahead of the store takeover.

1085
01:05:07,072 --> 01:05:09,116
太棒了 买家是谁？
That's great. Who is it?

1086
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:13,037
琳达啊 在我们的新世界 是不问买家身份的
In our new world, Linda,one does not ask who.

1087
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,788
他是匿名的 但我能告诉你
He's anonymous.But I can tell you this. He's, um...

1088
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:18,459
他是某个讨厌的家族 令人讨厌的成员
A very unpleasant member of a very unpleasant family

1089
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:22,338
那个家族用可怕的方式 统治一个讨厌的国家
who run a very unpleasant country in a very unpleasant way.

1090
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,758
他让米拉克 在他的国家做生意
He is facilitating Miracore in his country

1091
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:29,094
所以我亲自促成了这桩买卖
and so I've brokered the purchase of the diamond personally.

1092
01:05:29,178 --> 01:05:31,764
哈洛德不愿意跟他扯上关系
Harrods themselves will have nothing to do with him,

1093
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:34,725
所以我就当中间人
so I have acted as go-between.

1094
01:05:35,893 --> 01:05:37,686
我们好棒 对吧？
Hurray for us, no?

1095
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,313
对 我们好棒
Yes, hurray for us.

1096
01:05:40,147 --> 01:05:42,649
他会想亲自来拿鑽石吗？
Uh, will he be wanting to pick up the diamond in person?

1097
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:44,401
他不得入境英国
He is not allowed into the UK.

1098
01:05:44,485 --> 01:05:46,111
好像是跟‥
Something to do with, um...

1099
01:05:46,195 --> 01:05:48,697
洗钱有关 还是侵犯人权？
Money laundering? Human rights abuses?

1100
01:05:48,781 --> 01:05:51,867
总之 重要的问题
Anyway, the big question, Linda,

1101
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,745
目前要讨论的议题 是琳达的未来
the issue at hand here is the future of Linda.

1102
01:05:54,828 --> 01:05:56,580
你什麽时候回家？
When will you be coming home?

1103
01:05:58,707 --> 01:06:03,671
我决定等封城结束 再决定要不要回纽约
Well, I've decided to leave my decision about New York until after lockdown is lifted.

1104
01:06:03,754 --> 01:06:07,049
我在伦敦有很多认识的人
I have lots of ties in London.

1105
01:06:08,217 --> 01:06:09,968
我听说你单身
Uh-huh. I was told that you're single.

1106
01:06:12,471 --> 01:06:15,391
其实不是的
Actually, that was never true,

1107
01:06:15,474 --> 01:06:17,893
但现在真的单身了
but actually now it is.

1108
01:06:17,976 --> 01:06:21,647
你单身是我希望 你来纽约的理由之一
The fact that you are single is one of the reasons I want you to come to New York.

1109
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:23,941
我打算好好了解你
I'm planning to get to know more about you.

1110
01:06:24,024 --> 01:06:26,610
你令我著迷 琳达
You...You fascinate me, Linda.

1111
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:28,570
表面上如此强悍
So tough on the outside,

1112
01:06:29,321 --> 01:06:33,158
但你的内心也如此吗？
but inside,are you tough?

1113
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,330
你还记得你到巴黎的时候吗？
Do you remember when you came to Paris?

1114
01:06:38,414 --> 01:06:39,957
开完会的那个晚上
That evening, after the meeting,

1115
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,126
我本来要带你去吃晚餐
I was going to take you out to dinner.

1116
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:45,879
我那晚本来想诱惑你的
I was actually going to try to seduce you that night.

1117
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:50,426
我想不到那个晚上会怎麽样
Well, I can only speculate what kind of evening that might have been.

1118
01:06:50,509 --> 01:06:54,430
但我猜可能会有碎玻璃
But I suspect it would have involved broken glass.

1119
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:58,308
总之 我该把鑽石寄送到 可能杀人如麻的老兄家裡
Anyway, uh, should I send the diamond to this probable mass murderer's home

1120
01:06:58,392 --> 01:07:01,395
还是直接送到他的拷问密室？
or should I send it straight to his torture chamber?

1121
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:03,147
什麽？
What?

1122
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,232
我要把鑽石寄去哪裡？
Where would you like me to send the diamond?

1123
01:07:07,067 --> 01:07:08,402
寄到纽约
Ah, send it to New York.

1124
01:07:08,485 --> 01:07:09,737
因为疫情关系
Um, because of COVID,

1125
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:13,741
鑽石会直接送进 华尔街的安全金库
it will be couriered directly to a safe vault in Wall Street.

1126
01:07:13,824 --> 01:07:15,826
那裡没人能检查货品
There'll be no one to check it there,

1127
01:07:15,909 --> 01:07:20,205
所以请确保证明文件 都装在盒子裡
so please make sure that the verification papers are in the box.

1128
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:21,582
知道了吗？
Got that?

1129
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:25,210
对我们很多的新客户来说
For many of our new wave of clients,

1130
01:07:25,294 --> 01:07:28,505
收购之举本身就是结果
the act of acquisition is an end in itself.

1131
01:07:28,589 --> 01:07:30,758
纽约见 琳达 保重
Okay. See you in New York, Linda. Take care.

1132
01:07:30,841 --> 01:07:32,176
我‥
Well, I...

1133
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:17,346
别闹了 琳达
Don't be ridiculous, Linda.

1134
01:08:17,429 --> 01:08:21,475
由于医疗用口罩缺货 民众用旧衣服自制口罩
A shortage of medical masks,people are making their own from old clothing.

1135
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:26,438
但世卫组织表示 不确定自制口罩是否‥
But the WHO said it doesn't know whether homemade masks...

1136
01:08:26,522 --> 01:08:27,564
你去哪儿了？
Hey.Where'd you go?

1137
01:08:27,648 --> 01:08:29,066
佩克汉莱
Peckham Rye.

1138
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:31,318
－为什麽？ －不知道
- Why? - I don't know.

1139
01:08:31,402 --> 01:08:34,321
－什麽叫你不知道？ －我骑得很快
-What do you mean, you don't know? -I was just driving really, really fast,

1140
01:08:34,405 --> 01:08:36,156
因为警察追著我
because I was being chased by the police.

1141
01:08:36,824 --> 01:08:38,867
－什麽？ －我在玩封城新游戏
- What? - I was playing a new lockdown game.

1142
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:41,662
绿灯停 红灯行
Green for stop, red for go.

1143
01:08:41,745 --> 01:08:42,830
要死了
Fuck!

1144
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:45,624
－他们看到你的车牌号码了吗？ －没有 我骑太快了
-Did they get your license number? -No, I'm too fast for 'em.

1145
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:48,168
我是空城中 空荡荡道路上的一道光
I'm a streak of light on an empty road in a deserted city.

1146
01:08:48,252 --> 01:08:49,920
我是世上最后一个人
I'm the last man alive.

1147
01:08:50,004 --> 01:08:51,130
我任由道路带领我
I let the road direct me and I achieved that moment

1148
01:08:51,213 --> 01:08:55,467
达到了机车与人一体的绝妙境界
of transcendence where the bike becomes part of your body.

1149
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:59,013
我来到了南伦敦 某个有可爱动物园的都会农场
I found myself in South London on some sort of urban farm with a petting zoo

1150
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:00,139
我躲在山羊群裡
and I hid among the goats.

1151
01:09:00,222 --> 01:09:02,891
记得吧 我们当异教徒时 山羊是我的图腾动物
Remember the goat was my totem animal when we were pagans.

1152
01:09:02,975 --> 01:09:04,018
我跟山羊坐在一起
I sat with the goats and then resumed

1153
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:07,604
警车疾驶而过后 我继续踏上旅程
my journey as the police cars drove past.

1154
01:09:07,688 --> 01:09:08,939
我去了佩克汉
I was in Peckham.

1155
01:09:09,398 --> 01:09:10,774
我给你买了香烟
I bought you cigarettes.

1156
01:09:10,858 --> 01:09:12,234
自己也抽了一根
And I had one myself.

1157
01:09:12,776 --> 01:09:15,320
我十年来抽的第一根真烟
My first real, real one in ten years.

1158
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:18,824
你说得对 烟草有青春的味道
And you were right, tobacco tastes like youth!

1159
01:09:18,907 --> 01:09:21,243
真货就是真货 我爱的是真烟草
And real is real, and real tobacco is me really,

1160
01:09:21,326 --> 01:09:23,662
我现在就想再来一根 我要抽了
and I want another one right now and I'm gonna have one.

1161
01:09:37,718 --> 01:09:40,554
我好久都没见过 你现在的眼神了
You have a look in your eyes I haven't seen in a long time.

1162
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:42,681
我不是故意要吓你
I don't mean to frighten you.

1163
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:44,600
我没有吓到
I'm not frightened.

1164
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,563
记得我跟你说过 巴黎的玻璃马和骑师吗？
Remember I told you about the glass horse and jockey in Paris?

1165
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:52,274
不记得 我还在想那些山羊
No, I'm still with the goats.

1166
01:09:52,358 --> 01:09:53,942
它们的眼睛是蓝的
They had blue eyes.

1167
01:09:54,026 --> 01:09:57,988
我抓著雕像骑师的部分 然后转了一圈‥
I held the horse and jockey by the jockey and swung it around and...

1168
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:00,741
我想起了当骑士的感觉
And I remembered how it felt to be a rider

1169
01:10:00,824 --> 01:10:03,744
跟你骑著的东西 合为一体的感受
and to feel like you're a part of the thing that you are riding.

1170
01:10:03,827 --> 01:10:05,537
那是一种如性爱的感觉
It's a sexual feeling.

1171
01:10:06,413 --> 01:10:07,706
没错
Yeah, it is.

1172
01:10:08,749 --> 01:10:10,959
我现在后悔没跟你去了
I now wish I'd come with you.

1173
01:10:11,752 --> 01:10:13,295
是吗？
Really?

1174
01:10:13,379 --> 01:10:15,214
帕斯顿
Paxton,

1175
01:10:15,756 --> 01:10:19,176
很久以来 我都知道我们结束了
for a long time, I've known that our relationship was over.

1176
01:10:19,259 --> 01:10:22,680
很长一段时间 我们之间只剩下性
And for a long time, the only unbroken thread between us has been sex.

1177
01:10:23,472 --> 01:10:24,890
继续说
Go on.

1178
01:10:24,973 --> 01:10:26,475
我觉得这一刻十分难耐
I'm finding this moment difficult because...

1179
01:10:26,558 --> 01:10:29,561
因为我发誓过 不会发生这种事
I made a vow this wouldn't happen,

1180
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:34,233
你能不能脱掉皮外套 去拿一条茶巾？
so could you just take the leather jacket off and go hold a tea towel or something?

1181
01:10:34,316 --> 01:10:36,610
－拿茶巾？ －或去买牛奶 那就帮大忙了
- Hold a tea towel? - Or buy some milk, it would help me.

1182
01:10:36,694 --> 01:10:38,070
－我们有牛奶了 －或烤面包
- We have milk. - Or bake bread.

1183
01:10:38,153 --> 01:10:39,279
那样绝对能破坏气氛
That would definitely kill the moment.

1184
01:10:39,363 --> 01:10:41,532
我只想骑上机车 尽情驰骋
I just want to get on my bike and ride

1185
01:10:42,074 --> 01:10:43,617
管全世界去死
and fuck the world.

1186
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:49,248
好了 帕斯顿 是这样的
Okay, Paxton, here it is.

1187
01:10:50,624 --> 01:10:52,418
这可能是封城造成的
Probably as a result of lockdown,

1188
01:10:52,501 --> 01:10:54,753
你产生了骑车闯红灯的疯狂冲动
you have a mad urge to ride your motorbike through red lights.

1189
01:10:54,837 --> 01:10:56,630
而两小时前 我也有股疯狂冲动
And as of two hours ago, I have a mad urge

1190
01:10:56,714 --> 01:10:59,425
想从杀人魔手中 偷走价值三百万英镑的鑽石
to steal a diamond worth three million pounds from a mass murderer

1191
01:10:59,508 --> 01:11:01,760
－然后辞掉工作 当艺术家 －什麽？
-and quit my job and become an artist. -What?

1192
01:11:01,844 --> 01:11:05,723
但我觉得要发洩这股疯狂冲动 最实际的做法
But I think the most practical thing we can do to get this madness out of our system

1193
01:11:05,806 --> 01:11:06,890
就是我打破誓言
is that I break my vow

1194
01:11:06,974 --> 01:11:10,185
然后我们立刻上楼去做爱
and we go upstairs right now and have sex.

1195
01:11:10,269 --> 01:11:12,104
封城最后疯一回
"Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1196
01:11:13,856 --> 01:11:15,607
先是山羊 现在又这样
Goats, now this.

1197
01:11:16,191 --> 01:11:17,985
今天真够精彩
What a fucking day.

1198
01:11:26,744 --> 01:11:27,786
你好‥
Hi. Yeah,

1199
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,580
她在换衣服
she's, uh, she's just changing.

1200
01:11:30,706 --> 01:11:31,874
对了
Oh, by the way,

1201
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:34,668
你听过一个诗人 埃德加爱伦坡吗？
you ever heard of a poet called Edgar Allan Poe?

1202
01:11:34,752 --> 01:11:36,670
－什麽？ －算了 没事
- What? - Yeah, never mind.

1203
01:11:36,754 --> 01:11:38,047
等一下
All right. One second.

1204
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,923
您收听的是 ”和多明尼克开车”
You're listening to Drive Time with Dominic.

1205
01:11:40,007 --> 01:11:42,509
为您播放韩德尔的作品
And this is George Frideric Handel.

1206
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,860
请挂断或按井字键 选择其他选项
Please hang up or press the hash key for more options.

1207
01:11:59,943 --> 01:12:02,446
琳达 我打来只是想说
Uh, Linda, I'm just calling to say that

1208
01:12:02,988 --> 01:12:05,783
我知道今天下午 没什麽特别意义
I know this afternoon didn't mean anything,

1209
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:09,411
但我想告诉你 那感觉像是‥
but I want you to know that it would have felt like, uh...

1210
01:12:10,162 --> 01:12:13,165
南达科塔 那个下雨的下午
like South Dakota that afternoon when it rained.

1211
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:16,085
我还有一段诡异的记忆
And also, I have this bizarre memory that just before

1212
01:12:16,168 --> 01:12:20,506
我们偏离正道之前 你提到要偷鑽石
we strayed from the path of righteousness,you said something about stealing a diamond.

1213
01:12:20,589 --> 01:12:22,675
你说什麽要偷鑽石
...you said something about stealing a diamond.

1214
01:12:23,509 --> 01:12:24,885
是我幻想的吗？
Did I imagine that?

1215
01:12:24,968 --> 01:12:27,805
－重播留言请按１‥ －天啊
-Press 1 to replay the message -Oh, God!

1216
01:12:27,888 --> 01:12:29,014
谢谢
Thank you.

1217
01:12:33,102 --> 01:12:36,772
没有 奶奶 我没打算认真考虑
No, Grandma, I am not seriously considering it.

1218
01:12:46,573 --> 01:12:47,616
该死
Fuck.

1219
01:13:00,045 --> 01:13:03,924
病患术后通常在此休养
This is where the patients usually recover post-surgery.

1220
01:13:04,008 --> 01:13:07,845
但现在必须收容加护病房 无法容纳的新冠肺炎患者
But now, it's needed for COVID-19 overflow from intensive care.

1221
01:13:08,345 --> 01:13:11,640
医院必须调整 空间使用方式及做法
Hospitals are having to adapt their spaces and practices

1222
01:13:11,724 --> 01:13:14,018
以因应新冠肺炎
to be able to deal with Coronavirus.

1223
01:13:14,143 --> 01:13:16,186
我在加护病房当护理师十八年了
I've been a nurse in ICU for 18 years

1224
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,813
第一次遇到这种‥
and I've never seen...

1225
01:13:26,155 --> 01:13:27,239
好
All right.

1226
01:13:28,157 --> 01:13:29,366
重要的周六到了
Big Saturday.

1227
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:30,743
哈洛德百货
Harrods.

1228
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,913
展开大骗局
The grand deception.

1229
01:13:35,456 --> 01:13:37,750
跟我说明详细的流程
You have to tell me exactly what it is we have to do.

1230
01:13:38,834 --> 01:13:40,169
帕斯顿
Paxton...

1231
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:43,881
先坐 等等我
Sit down. Wait there.

1232
01:13:48,594 --> 01:13:50,971
我只是想顺一顺我们的计划
This is just us organizing what it is that we're gonna do, okay?

1233
01:13:51,055 --> 01:13:53,223
不要想太多 好吗？
It's nothing else.

1234
01:13:53,307 --> 01:13:54,767
不然是可以想什麽？
Why, what else would it be?

1235
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,435
没什麽 你干嘛问？
Nothing. Why do you ask?

1236
01:13:57,519 --> 01:13:58,854
－你还好吗？ －我？
-Are you okay? -Me?

1237
01:13:58,937 --> 01:14:03,067
我没事啊 完全没事
I am okay. I am intensely okay and normal.

1238
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:04,860
说说场地
Okay. Background.

1239
01:14:04,943 --> 01:14:06,153
哈洛德百货
Harrods.

1240
01:14:07,196 --> 01:14:10,324
地表层都对外开放
The top part is the public area.

1241
01:14:10,407 --> 01:14:13,869
但地下还有七层楼
But below ground, there are seven floors.

1242
01:14:13,952 --> 01:14:17,289
这裡是货仓 有很多密道
Floors where merchandise is stored and lots of tunnels

1243
01:14:17,373 --> 01:14:21,460
珠宝等昂贵商品 会透过密道运至秘密电梯
where expensive items such as jewelry are transported to secure elevators.

1244
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:23,087
地表上都很庄重奢华
All grown up and glamorous above

1245
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:25,297
地面下则很有序而阴森
and efficient and scary below.

1246
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:27,591
哈洛德的保全非常严密
Security at Harrods is unbelievably tight,

1247
01:14:27,675 --> 01:14:30,469
潜入偷窃根本是不可能的事
it would be impossible to get inside to actually steal something.

1248
01:14:30,552 --> 01:14:31,637
偷？
Steal?

1249
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,764
谁说要偷东西了？
Who's talking about stealing anything?

1250
01:14:34,807 --> 01:14:36,600
冷静点 帕斯顿 不要大惊小怪好不好
Everything is normal. Paxton, stop being weird.

1251
01:14:36,684 --> 01:14:38,519
我才不是大惊小怪
It's not me being weird.

1252
01:14:39,687 --> 01:14:42,690
你分明别有用心 而且还欲盖弥彰
I mean, you clearly appear to have a hidden agenda,which is not really that hidden,

1253
01:14:42,773 --> 01:14:46,485
我不知道那是什麽 还有你的眼睛上有髒东西
but I don't know what it is.Also, you've got a smudge above your eye.

1254
01:14:47,236 --> 01:14:49,780
你昨晚收到我传的讯息了吗？
Did you get my message on your phone last night?

1255
01:14:49,863 --> 01:14:51,573
南达科他州的事？
About South Dakota?

1256
01:14:52,408 --> 01:14:53,742
还有鑽石的事
And about a diamond.

1257
01:14:53,826 --> 01:14:55,744
帕斯顿 你有什麽毛病？
Paxton, what is the matter with you?

1258
01:14:57,037 --> 01:14:59,081
－我没有毛病 －你认真？
- There's nothing the matter with me. - Seriously?

1259
01:14:59,164 --> 01:15:03,043
昨天你说要偷鑽石
Yesterday, you were talking about stealing a diamond.

1260
01:15:03,127 --> 01:15:05,170
你肯定说过 不是我自己乱想
You were, I'm not imagining it.

1261
01:15:05,254 --> 01:15:09,633
今天你就画出哈洛德的地图 好像有什麽秘密计划
And today, you are drawing Harrods like it's, uh,some kind of secret plan in

1262
01:15:09,717 --> 01:15:14,763
－好像劫盗片一样 －秘密计划哪会画那麽粗糙
-a secret heist movie. -How can you draw a rectangle like you're in a secret plan? I don't...

1263
01:15:14,847 --> 01:15:16,724
你有没有秘密计划嘛
Do you have a secret plan?

1264
01:15:17,474 --> 01:15:18,767
跟你说‥
You know...

1265
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,812
我昨天见到我奶奶
I saw my grandmother's face yesterday.

1266
01:15:21,895 --> 01:15:24,273
我跟奶奶说我没问题
I told her, "It's okay, Grandma, I am fine.

1267
01:15:24,356 --> 01:15:26,483
绝对不会做出蠢事
I'm not going to do anything stupid."

1268
01:15:26,567 --> 01:15:28,986
你说那颗鑽石叫哈裡斯鑽石
You said the diamond is called a Harris Diamond.

1269
01:15:29,069 --> 01:15:30,154
拜托 帕斯顿
Oh, Paxton, come on.

1270
01:15:31,655 --> 01:15:33,407
今天是周六 天亮了
It's Saturday. It's morning.

1271
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:38,787
凌晨四点的怪异幻想 早就烟消云散了
All the weird 4:00 a.m. fantasies and options have gone away as they always do.

1272
01:15:38,871 --> 01:15:40,497
那是怎样的鑽石？
Tell me about the diamond.

1273
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:45,544
哈裡斯鑽石有两颗
There are two Harris Diamonds.

1274
01:15:46,295 --> 01:15:49,465
－什麽？ －哈裡斯鑽石有两颗 不懂吗？
- What? - There are two Harris Diamonds, okay. God!

1275
01:15:49,923 --> 01:15:51,508
为什麽有两颗？
Why are there two?

1276
01:15:52,343 --> 01:15:54,845
你以为我昨晚有睡吗？
Do you think I slept at all last night, Paxton?

1277
01:15:54,928 --> 01:15:57,264
没有 整晚没睡
Well actually, no, I didn't.

1278
01:15:57,348 --> 01:15:59,224
那你为什麽醒著？
And what was it that kept you awake?

1279
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,603
哈裡斯鑽石一号
Harris Diamond one,

1280
01:16:02,686 --> 01:16:03,979
哈裡斯鑽石二号
Harris Diamond two.

1281
01:16:04,063 --> 01:16:06,190
一颗是真的
One is real,

1282
01:16:06,273 --> 01:16:08,984
另一颗是假的
the other is fake.

1283
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:11,528
这种价位的鑽石不会展示真品
Whenever a diamond of this value is exhibited in store,

1284
01:16:11,612 --> 01:16:13,989
大家看到的一定是复制品
they use a replica of the real thing to put into the public area.

1285
01:16:14,073 --> 01:16:16,909
真品一定在金库的保险箱裡
The actual diamond is kept safe in the vaults.

1286
01:16:16,992 --> 01:16:20,746
现在复制品在这裡展示
Currently, the replica is on display here on

1287
01:16:21,330 --> 01:16:22,373
位在一楼
the ground floor.

1288
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:25,668
但是真品放在这裡
But your real Harris Diamond is here in the vaults.

1289
01:16:26,627 --> 01:16:27,961
锁在金库
Tonight,

1290
01:16:28,045 --> 01:16:30,923
今晚七点整 保全会带我们进金库
at exactly 7:00 p.m.,you and I will be escorted to the vaults by security

1291
01:16:31,006 --> 01:16:32,633
拿取真正的哈裡斯鑽石
to collect the real Harris Diamond.

1292
01:16:32,716 --> 01:16:36,345
然后我们搭秘密电梯去一楼
We will then go up the ground floor in a secure elevator where we add the diamond

1293
01:16:36,428 --> 01:16:38,681
并在电梯内把鑽石 放入伊芙许沃典藏组中
to the rest of the Eve Schwarz collection.

1294
01:16:38,764 --> 01:16:40,474
到了七点半
Then, right there at 7:30 p.m.,

1295
01:16:40,557 --> 01:16:43,143
我们手中会有真品 跟以假乱真的复制品
we will have the real diamond and the very good replica diamond, side by side,

1296
01:16:43,227 --> 01:16:45,896
放一起的话 常人根本分不出真伪
next to each other, almost indistinguishable.

1297
01:16:45,979 --> 01:16:47,606
而因为疫情封城
And because of COVID restrictions,

1298
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:51,944
只有你跟我两人会在场
the only people that will be there are you and me.

1299
01:16:52,027 --> 01:16:56,073
所以我们要把真的鑽石 放进保险箱 寄回纽约
So, then we put the real diamond into a secure box and send it to New York,

1300
01:16:56,156 --> 01:16:58,909
然后把玻璃复制品 放进我的包包 拿去丢掉
and we take the glass replica and I put it in my purse, we take it away for disposal,

1301
01:16:58,992 --> 01:17:01,578
这就是我们的完整流程 没有别的了
and that is what we are going to fucking do,exactly that and nothing else.

1302
01:17:01,662 --> 01:17:04,039
奶奶 我爱你
Grandma, I love you.

1303
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,710
能问个很明显的问题吗？
May I ask a very obvious question?

1304
01:17:07,793 --> 01:17:08,961
不可以
No, you may not.

1305
01:17:09,044 --> 01:17:12,131
如果我们把复制品寄回纽约
What would happen if we sent the replica to New York

1306
01:17:12,214 --> 01:17:13,632
拿走真品
and kept the real thing?

1307
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:15,676
我想鑽石寄达纽约后
I'm assuming that as soon as it got to New York,

1308
01:17:15,759 --> 01:17:18,303
一定会有人发现是假货吧
someone would realize that it was fake.

1309
01:17:18,387 --> 01:17:20,681
不会 没有人会发现
No, they wouldn't.

1310
01:17:20,764 --> 01:17:23,017
所以我才彻夜未眠
That is why I couldn't sleep.

1311
01:17:23,517 --> 01:17:25,769
不管我们寄哪一颗去纽约
Whichever one we send to New York,

1312
01:17:25,853 --> 01:17:27,938
都会被直接送进华尔街的金库
it will go into a secure vault in Wall Street

1313
01:17:28,022 --> 01:17:29,648
下次有人类看到它
and won't even be looked at by another human being

1314
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:32,359
可能是二十 五十 百年后的事了
for 20, 50, 100 years.

1315
01:17:32,443 --> 01:17:34,069
老天啊
Holy fuck.

1316
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:38,407
三百万英镑
Three million pounds, tax free.

1317
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:40,868
不用抽税 不用付出代价
No consequences.

1318
01:17:40,951 --> 01:17:42,619
你一份 我一份 一份给健保局
One for me, one for you, one for the NHS.

1319
01:17:42,703 --> 01:17:44,913
－你明明动过贪念 －不行 我‥
-You have thought about this. -No, I can't

1320
01:17:44,997 --> 01:17:46,165
我要去冥想了
You know, I need to go meditate.

1321
01:17:47,124 --> 01:17:49,043
纽约真的不会检查吗？
Are you sure they won't check it in New York?

1322
01:17:49,126 --> 01:17:50,294
闭嘴 我要冥想
Shut up. I need to meditate.

1323
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:52,212
你想表达什麽？
What were you going to say?

1324
01:17:53,172 --> 01:17:54,923
鑽石的买家是个恶人
The man who bought the diamond is bad.

1325
01:17:55,007 --> 01:17:56,759
他是大恶棍 我们俩是好人
He's really bad, and you and I are good.

1326
01:17:56,842 --> 01:17:59,053
健保也是好制度 全都比那个恶棍好
And the NHS is good. And good is better than bad.

1327
01:17:59,136 --> 01:18:02,139
我跟奶奶解释的时候 连她都说有道理
When I explained all that to Grandma,even she said, "Well, yeah, that's true."

1328
01:18:02,222 --> 01:18:04,725
她可是喀尔文教派的铁杆信徒
And she was a Calvinist, straight as a rod.

1329
01:18:04,808 --> 01:18:08,062
不像我 这麽容易受诱惑
Unlike me, who is weak in the face of temptation.

1330
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,816
不放纵毋宁死 琳达
Live wild or die, Linda.

1331
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,903
帕斯顿 你忘了一件很重要的事
Paxton, you're forgetting something very important, okay?

1332
01:18:15,986 --> 01:18:18,113
假设‥我们真的行动
Assuming that we do this thing,

1333
01:18:18,197 --> 01:18:19,698
我知道这不可能
which we definitely won't,

1334
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,534
我们两个普通人
how would two ordinary people like you and me

1335
01:18:22,618 --> 01:18:26,330
去哪儿找门路 销赃三百万英镑的鑽石？
find a way to sell a three million pounds stolen diamond?

1336
01:18:27,081 --> 01:18:28,707
好的 就是这样 我使出浑身解数
Okay, that was it. That was my last attempt

1337
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:30,334
说明我们不该做这种事
to find a logical reason why we shouldn't do this,

1338
01:18:30,417 --> 01:18:32,461
但你一定会说 找阿契布鲁斯 对吧？
but you are going to say "Archie Bruce," aren't you?

1339
01:18:32,544 --> 01:18:33,921
没错
Yes, I am.

1340
01:18:34,713 --> 01:18:36,173
阿契布鲁斯
Archie Bruce.

1341
01:18:37,424 --> 01:18:39,885
这几年我一直跟他有联系
Over the years, I've kept up with the guys.

1342
01:18:40,427 --> 01:18:46,642
阿契布鲁斯 从摩托车偷到老爷车
I mean, Archie Bruce,he's graduated from stealing motorcycles to stealing vintage cars

1343
01:18:46,725 --> 01:18:48,102
还偷艺术品跟珠宝
and fine art and jewelry.

1344
01:18:48,185 --> 01:18:53,232
他一定可以轻松把鑽石 卖到莫斯科的某个顶层公寓
I mean, he'd have Mr. Harris in a penthouse in Moscow before the banging of the next saucepans.

1345
01:18:53,315 --> 01:18:54,775
而且他一定会答应
And he'd do a preferential deal with you,

1346
01:18:54,858 --> 01:18:56,276
因为你那一晚挺身而出
because you stepped in one night and saved his life

1347
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:00,114
在沃福的酒吧救了他的命
at a roadhouse in Watford.

1348
01:19:00,197 --> 01:19:02,324
某种因果轮回吧
Circle of life, something like that.

1349
01:19:03,826 --> 01:19:06,161
一切折磨因阿契而起
With Archie Bruce, the nightmare began.

1350
01:19:06,745 --> 01:19:09,164
现在由阿契来了结
Maybe with Archie Bruce, the nightmare ends.

1351
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:12,376
所以‥
So,

1352
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:16,130
我们要怎麽办 琳达？
what are we going to do, Linda?

1353
01:19:19,133 --> 01:19:20,175
好吧
Okay,

1354
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:22,261
这样吧 帕斯顿
Paxton, here it is.

1355
01:19:24,221 --> 01:19:25,639
我们今晚决定
We decide tonight.

1356
01:19:26,682 --> 01:19:28,559
我们到哈洛德亲眼看到鑽石
When we're there at Harrods with the diamonds,

1357
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:30,310
就会知道该怎麽做了
we're gonna know what's right and what's wrong.

1358
01:19:30,394 --> 01:19:32,354
我们当场决定
We'll decide in the moment.

1359
01:19:32,438 --> 01:19:34,606
或是顺其自然
Or let the moment decide.

1360
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,484
有什麽不同？
What's the difference?

1361
01:19:37,568 --> 01:19:39,611
一个是宿命 一个是自由意志
Fate versus free will.

1362
01:19:39,695 --> 01:19:41,572
谁控制著我们的命运？
Who controls our destiny?

1363
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,908
一切都早已注定 或者我们自己搞砸了？
Is everything part of a plan or do we fuck things up for ourselves?

1364
01:19:46,535 --> 01:19:48,662
今晚七点半就会知道了
Tonight at 7:30, we find out.

1365
01:19:57,546 --> 01:19:58,964
你好 半个兄弟
Hey, half-brother.

1366
01:20:00,382 --> 01:20:01,759
什麽 现在？
What, now?

1367
01:20:01,842 --> 01:20:03,385
你想要视讯？
You wanna Zoom?

1368
01:20:03,927 --> 01:20:05,220
好 等我一下
All right, give me a minute.

1369
01:20:13,812 --> 01:20:14,938
帕斯顿
Ah, Paxton,

1370
01:20:15,022 --> 01:20:16,273
你好吗？
how are you?

1371
01:20:16,774 --> 01:20:19,318
我现在有点犹豫不决
Actually, I am at a fork in the road.

1372
01:20:19,401 --> 01:20:20,569
是吗？
Really?

1373
01:20:20,986 --> 01:20:23,322
我要说的没准能帮你 决定选哪条路
Then perhaps what I have to say will have some bearing on which fork you take,

1374
01:20:23,405 --> 01:20:25,491
跟路还真有点关系
because it is sort of road related.

1375
01:20:27,117 --> 01:20:30,537
前几天你说要把重机卖掉
You see, Paxton, the other day when you said you want to sell your motorcycle,

1376
01:20:30,621 --> 01:20:34,416
我就说等等 别那麽急
I thought, "Wait a minute. Time out. Not so fast."

1377
01:20:35,542 --> 01:20:38,087
我挂掉电话之后
And then, after I cut the call

1378
01:20:39,046 --> 01:20:41,340
－就想到老妈 －老妈？
-I thought about Mom. -Mum?

1379
01:20:41,423 --> 01:20:44,385
你被迫卖掉最珍爱的东西 她会做何感想？
How she would feel about you having to sell

1380
01:20:44,468 --> 01:20:47,096
而我却在美丽的哈得孙谷快活
your most precious possession,while at the same time, over here

1381
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:50,849
你的异父兄弟过得还不错
in the beautiful Hudson Valley,your brother, your half-brother isn't having it so bad.

1382
01:20:50,933 --> 01:20:55,229
果园的樱桃树长出蕈类
You know, when the cherry trees in your orchard get a fungus,

1383
01:20:55,312 --> 01:20:58,232
是很不妙 但还有更糟的事
it sucks, but there are worse things.

1384
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:01,527
对樱桃树来说确实不是最糟
Yeah, not for the cherry tree.

1385
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:04,321
对樱桃树来说 最糟的事 莫过于乔治华盛顿
Maybe worse for a cherry tree is the steady tread of George Washington

1386
01:21:04,405 --> 01:21:07,741
怀著好意拿著斧头出现
as he approaches with an axe in his hand and a head full of good intentions.

1387
01:21:07,825 --> 01:21:10,661
总之 我想到 老妈会希望我怎麽做
Anyway, I wondered what Mom would want me to do.

1388
01:21:10,744 --> 01:21:13,664
老妈应该会希望你长话短说
Well, remembering Mum,I think she'd want you to get to the point.

1389
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:17,209
好吧 帕斯顿
Okay, Paxton,

1390
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:18,544
我就说了
here it is.

1391
01:21:19,795 --> 01:21:23,007
你的宝贝重机是我买的
It is I who has bought your precious motorcycle.

1392
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:25,801
重机的买家就是我
The purchaser of your bike is me.

1393
01:21:25,884 --> 01:21:28,012
我要把车还给你
And I am giving it back to you.

1394
01:21:28,095 --> 01:21:30,639
一点善意 同母异父的兄弟情
My gesture, half-brother to half-brother.

1395
01:21:30,723 --> 01:21:33,684
你的重机回到你手中了
Your bike is yours once more.

1396
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:35,310
不要感谢我 帕斯顿
Don't thank me, Paxton.

1397
01:21:35,394 --> 01:21:36,854
真的 不需要
Please. No need.

1398
01:21:36,937 --> 01:21:40,274
我只有一件事有求于你
All I ask, the only thing I ask of you, Paxton,

1399
01:21:40,357 --> 01:21:43,318
请你从现在开始善待自己
is that you are kind to yourself from now on.

1400
01:21:43,402 --> 01:21:46,572
记取教训 你要明白世界不跟你作对
That you learn from this.That the world does not hate you.

1401
01:21:46,655 --> 01:21:49,491
没错 命运有时很捉弄人
That, yes, sometimes fate seems harsh and cruel,

1402
01:21:49,575 --> 01:21:51,827
但要知道人性本善‥
but people really do what good...

1403
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:55,080
大卫 我是琳达 你好
Hey, David, it's Linda. Hi!

1404
01:21:55,622 --> 01:21:57,833
琳达 我正在跟帕斯顿讲话
Uh, Linda, I thought I was just speaking to Paxton.

1405
01:21:57,916 --> 01:22:00,127
我知道 我听见你的大善事了
Yes, I know. I heard, David, your magnificent gesture,

1406
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:03,547
我实在情不自禁 一定要亲自跟你视讯
and I just... I couldn't stop myself,I couldn't help myself. I just had to jump on the call

1407
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:07,051
告诉你我多感谢 你真是个大好人
and say, "Oh, my God, David.What kind of a person are you?"

1408
01:22:07,134 --> 01:22:08,552
大卫买了我的重机
David bought my fucking bike.

1409
01:22:08,635 --> 01:22:11,722
我听见了 也听见他说教
Yes, I heard. I heard, and then I heard the sermon,

1410
01:22:11,805 --> 01:22:15,059
他不只花钱不手软
and I thought, "Wow!Not only is he so generous with his cash,

1411
01:22:15,142 --> 01:22:17,519
还大方分享自己的智慧呢
he is so free with his wisdom."

1412
01:22:19,563 --> 01:22:21,023
－总之 帕斯顿‥ －别这样
- Anyway, Paxton, there it is... - No, no, no.

1413
01:22:21,106 --> 01:22:22,941
别让我打断这感人的一刻
Don't let me interrupt this meaningful moment.

1414
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:26,820
大卫 你继续刚刚的大道理‥
What is it that you were saying, David?Something about fate being harsh and...

1415
01:22:37,164 --> 01:22:38,999
－你干嘛对他发火？ －我没有啊
-Why were you mad at him? -I wasn't mad.

1416
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:40,209
明明就有
Yes, you were.

1417
01:22:41,502 --> 01:22:42,836
就是你
It was you.

1418
01:22:44,129 --> 01:22:45,464
你买走我的重机
You bought my bike.

1419
01:22:45,547 --> 01:22:48,842
帕斯顿 你乱讲什麽 你刚刚也听见了
Paxton, don't be ridiculous. You heard what David said.

1420
01:22:48,926 --> 01:22:51,887
大卫才不可能那麽好心 倒是很爱抢功劳
David would never do something like that,but he would take the credit.

1421
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:56,058
你则会做好事 又让别人抢走功劳
Whereas you would do something like that and give the credit to someone else.

1422
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,435
是因为你可怜我吧
You did it 'cause you felt sorry for me.

1423
01:23:00,229 --> 01:23:04,274
对 我很担心 你失去一切后会怎麽样
Yes, I worried about what would happen if you lost everything.

1424
01:23:05,234 --> 01:23:08,195
其实主要还是我的良心过不去
Mainly because I didn't want anything bad on my conscience.

1425
01:23:08,278 --> 01:23:09,571
但同时‥
Confession avalanche, but also I...

1426
01:23:10,364 --> 01:23:12,241
也因为这辆重机能代表我们
I did it because the bike represents us.

1427
01:23:12,324 --> 01:23:13,784
－才怪‥ －我是‥
- And... - No, no, no.

1428
01:23:13,867 --> 01:23:16,370
你就是可怜我
Pity is over here, all right,

1429
01:23:16,453 --> 01:23:18,414
离爱我还远得很
and love is way over here.

1430
01:23:18,497 --> 01:23:20,457
别假装两者间有一道桥
Don't pretend there is a bridge.

1431
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:26,213
但你会可怜一个 盗窃数百万英镑的男人吗？
But would you still feel pity for a man who'd just stolen a million pounds?

1432
01:23:28,465 --> 01:23:29,967
我会一夜致富
I'd be a millionaire,

1433
01:23:30,551 --> 01:23:32,678
同时变回一个恶棍
and a bandido once again.

1434
01:23:34,346 --> 01:23:35,889
也许你会回心转意
Maybe you'd change your mind.

1435
01:23:37,266 --> 01:23:39,226
也许我们能一起骑向夕阳
Maybe we'd ride off into the sunset.

1436
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:41,020
帕斯顿
Paxton...

1437
01:23:41,687 --> 01:23:44,314
不管我们今晚怎麽决定
whatever we decide to do tonight,

1438
01:23:44,398 --> 01:23:45,691
我们都会分道扬镳
we will go our separate ways.

1439
01:23:45,774 --> 01:23:48,902
有钱了 表示我们都自由了
The money would mean that we're both free.

1440
01:23:51,655 --> 01:23:55,784
好 这也许会影响我做的决定
Well, I will factor that into my decision-making process.

1441
01:23:57,453 --> 01:23:59,038
谢谢你的重机
Thanks for the bike.

1442
01:24:10,966 --> 01:24:12,593
各位先生女士
Ladies and gentlemen...

1443
01:24:13,969 --> 01:24:15,429
被隔离的同胞
fellow inmates...

1444
01:24:16,555 --> 01:24:18,390
我要送你们一份礼物
I have something for you

1445
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:22,561
在我搭上２７路公车 去面对命运之前
before I head off on the number 27 bus to meet my destiny.

1446
01:24:23,854 --> 01:24:26,315
送你们一首诗的节选
It's a passage from a poem

1447
01:24:27,107 --> 01:24:29,109
艾略特写的
written by T.S. Eliot,

1448
01:24:30,361 --> 01:24:32,446
我想你们都没听过他
who I'm sure no one has ever heard of either.

1449
01:24:34,281 --> 01:24:37,409
”她向酒杯瞬间一瞥”
"She turns and looks a moment in the glass,

1450
01:24:38,494 --> 01:24:41,205
”全无留意告辞的爱人”
hardly aware of her departed lover.

1451
01:24:42,664 --> 01:24:46,669
”她的脑允一丝 半成的思绪通过‥”
Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass.

1452
01:24:48,003 --> 01:24:49,380
”已然结束”
Well, now that's done,

1453
01:24:50,339 --> 01:24:52,174
”我为此欣喜”
and I'm glad it's over."

1454
01:24:56,345 --> 01:24:59,098
关键时刻见了 琳达
See you in the moment, Linda.

1455
01:25:16,365 --> 01:25:18,492
这可能是我此生 最后一次搭公车
This could be the last bus I ever take.

1456

1549
01:33:05,376 --> 01:33:06,502
还有鑽石
Diamonds.

1550
01:33:06,585 --> 01:33:08,087
没错 鑽石
Yeah. Diamonds.

1551
01:33:09,296 --> 01:33:10,756
电梯门要关了
The elevator door is closing

1552
01:33:13,676 --> 01:33:15,427
记得以前玩的游戏吗？
Remember that game we used to play

1553
01:33:15,511 --> 01:33:16,929
只要我们在电梯独处
when we are alone in an elevator,we ask each other questions,

1554
01:33:17,012 --> 01:33:20,391
就能互问问题 对方得完全如实回答
and we are only allowed to tell the absolute truth?

1555
01:33:21,517 --> 01:33:22,893
可恶
Shoot.

1556
01:33:22,976 --> 01:33:25,521
我俩之间出了什麽问题？
What went wrong with you and me?

1557
01:33:27,773 --> 01:33:29,316
我们初识时 我想好好疯一回
When I met you, I wanted wild and

1558
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,319
你也很疯 然后‥
you were wild.And then,

1559
01:33:32,403 --> 01:33:35,364
我不想疯癫了 你也收敛了
I stopped wanting wild, and you stopped being wild.

1560
01:33:36,824 --> 01:33:38,534
－这样很刚好啊 －并没有
- So, it should have worked. - Yeah, but it didn't.

1561
01:33:38,617 --> 01:33:40,786
－为什麽？ －我不知道
- Why not? - I don't know.

1562
01:33:41,704 --> 01:33:43,372
这就是实话
That's the truth.

1563
01:33:44,248 --> 01:33:46,041
电梯门要开了
Doors opening.

1564
01:33:47,459 --> 01:33:48,836
你饿了吗？
Are you hungry?

1565
01:33:48,919 --> 01:33:50,129
饿了
Yeah.

1566
01:34:12,151 --> 01:34:16,030
去金库之前还有一个小时
We have an hour until our slot in the vaults,

1567
01:34:16,113 --> 01:34:19,283
你想吃什麽？ 这裡什麽都有
so what do you want to eat, Paxton?There is literally everything.

1568
01:34:22,745 --> 01:34:26,707
既然百货要关闭了 这些都会送到食物银行
With the store closing, Harrods is gonna give all of this food away to a food bank.

1569
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:30,961
请各货运公司 准备好提领文件以接受检查
Please prepare the documents for inspection

1570
01:34:31,045 --> 01:34:32,713
我说‥
Fine.

1571
01:34:33,172 --> 01:34:34,715
根本没人在看
Is there anybody watching?

1572
01:34:35,382 --> 01:34:36,592
也许吧
Maybe.

1573
01:34:37,676 --> 01:34:38,927
眼光放远一点
Dream bigger.

1574
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:45,017
顶级鱼子酱如何？
Finest beluga caviar?

1575
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:58,822
决定时刻到了吗？
So is this the moment?

1576
01:34:58,906 --> 01:34:59,948
不是
No.

1577
01:35:00,032 --> 01:35:03,994
做决定之前 我们得先讲清楚
No. We gotta get something clear before we make up our mind.

1578
01:35:04,078 --> 01:35:08,499
这是意大利佩裡戈黑松露 要价７３５英镑
This is a black Perigord truffle from Italy.It retails for ￡735.

1579
01:35:08,582 --> 01:35:10,292
－这蘑菇太贵了吧 －好‥
- For a fucking mushroom? - Okay.

1580
01:35:10,376 --> 01:35:11,960
这就是我们得厘清的事
Okay, that is what we need to get clear in our minds.

1581
01:35:12,044 --> 01:35:15,422
对我们而言 价钱与价值有什麽差异
What is the difference between the cost of things,and the value of things to you and me?

1582
01:35:15,506 --> 01:35:16,548
我要准备野餐
So, I'm gonna make a picnic.

1583
01:35:16,632 --> 01:35:20,594
拿些平常要价五千英镑的食材
A picnic which under normal circumstances would cost us about ￡5,000.

1584
01:35:49,498 --> 01:35:50,666
电梯门要关了
Door's closing.

1585
01:35:50,749 --> 01:35:53,961
我心爱的奶奶会种族歧视
My precious grandma was a racist.

1586
01:35:54,044 --> 01:35:59,174
所以我脑中评判自己的 陪审团把她剔除了
And I've just decided to take her off my in-head jury of people

1587
01:36:01,593 --> 01:36:03,554
那这陪审团还有谁？
So, who else is on the jury?

1588
01:36:04,263 --> 01:36:06,598
过世的母亲 上帝 还有你
My dead mother, God and you.

1589
01:36:06,682 --> 01:36:09,309
－怎麽还有我？ －电梯门要开了
-How come I'm still there? -Door's opening.

1590
01:36:09,893 --> 01:36:12,021
门开了 我不必回答你了
Doors are open, I don't have to tell you.

1591
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:17,151
我以前午休会来这裡
I used to come in here on my lunch break.

1592
01:36:23,282 --> 01:36:25,242
所以你想要哪一幅画？
So which one of those paintings do you want?

1593
01:36:27,327 --> 01:36:28,704
我不想拥有一幅画
Uh, I don't want to own one.

1594
01:36:29,872 --> 01:36:31,331
你想自己画一幅
You want to paint one.

1595
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,376
我只是想画画
I just want to paint.

1596
01:36:36,462 --> 01:36:38,172
决定时刻到了‥
So, this is the moment.

1597
01:36:38,255 --> 01:36:39,923
等等
Oh, wait.

1598
01:36:40,007 --> 01:36:42,217
－那聋子在看吗？ －什麽？
- Is the deaf guy looking? - What?

1599
01:36:42,301 --> 01:36:45,137
那是我为了让你闭嘴胡诌的
Oh, I made that guy up so you would stop talking.

1600
01:36:46,347 --> 01:36:47,723
你想想看
Think about it.

1601
01:36:47,806 --> 01:36:50,601
每年十万英镑 乘以十年
￡100,000 a year for ten years.

1602
01:36:50,684 --> 01:36:52,311
五万英镑 乘以廿年
￡50,000 a year for 20 years.

1603
01:36:52,394 --> 01:36:54,229
－总共一百万英镑 －对
- A million pounds. - Yeah.

1604
01:36:54,313 --> 01:36:57,900
这样你就有本钱作画 根本不必卖出去
You could paint.You wouldn't even need to sell anything.

1605
01:36:57,983 --> 01:36:59,610
电梯门要关了
Door's closing.

1606
01:37:00,903 --> 01:37:02,780
我从来没学过骑单车
I never learned to ride a bicycle.

1607
01:37:02,863 --> 01:37:05,366
－什麽 从来没有？ －对
- What?Never?  - Yeah.

1608
01:37:05,449 --> 01:37:07,159
我直接学摩托车
Went straight to the motorcycle.

1609
01:37:08,702 --> 01:37:11,372
圣诞节前 我和玛莉滚过一次床单
Before Christmas, I had a sexual encounter with Maria,

1610
01:37:11,455 --> 01:37:14,249
－非常美妙 －电梯门要开了
-and it was great. -Door's opening.

1611
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:19,797
好了
Okay,

1612
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,299
目前的共识是 我们都渴望自由
so we've established that we both want freedom.

1613
01:37:22,383 --> 01:37:24,218
玛莉‥怎麽会？
Maria, really?

1614
01:37:24,301 --> 01:37:26,011
帕斯顿‥
Oh, Paxton.

1615
01:37:26,095 --> 01:37:28,430
我们在讨论 此生最重要的决定
Paxton, we are about to make the most important decision

1616
01:37:28,514 --> 01:37:30,391
拜托专心一点
of our lives. Can you concentrate?

1617
01:37:31,433 --> 01:37:32,559
好了
Okay,

1618
01:37:32,643 --> 01:37:35,896
在决策过程中 我们还没讨论过道德
in our decision-making process,we haven't yet discussed morality.

1619
01:37:35,979 --> 01:37:40,067
你看看 整座城市都封锁了
Look at that. That is...That's a whole city in lockdown.

1620
01:37:41,026 --> 01:37:43,362
医院忙不过来 一百万英镑会大有帮助
Hospitals can't cope. A million pounds would help.

1621
01:37:43,445 --> 01:37:45,239
这是做善事
We'd be doing good. Plus, I worked it out.

1622
01:37:45,322 --> 01:37:48,742
而且都是五十元钞的话 就能全装一只皮箱放门口
If it's in 50s, it all fits in one suitcase.You can leave it on a doorstep.

1623
01:37:48,826 --> 01:37:50,619
－去你的 奶奶 －你把她剔除陪审团了
-Take that, Grandma. - You got rid of Grandma.

1624
01:37:50,703 --> 01:37:52,955
没错 谢谢提醒
Yes, I did. Thank you.

1625
01:37:53,038 --> 01:37:54,581
好吧
So, okay,

1626
01:37:55,332 --> 01:37:57,209
就这麽做
we do it.

1627
01:37:57,292 --> 01:38:01,255
管它的 我们现在就决定
Fuck it.We decide right now.

1628
01:38:02,006 --> 01:38:03,340
好
Okay.

1629
01:38:06,218 --> 01:38:08,345
还没分手的话 我现在就会亲你
Previously, I would have kissed you.

1630
01:38:10,431 --> 01:38:12,391
不如试试看吧
Let's just see what happens.

1631
01:38:31,577 --> 01:38:33,370
－好了 －该死
- Okay. - Fuck.

1632
01:38:34,121 --> 01:38:35,789
－玛莉‥ －该走了
- Maria? - Okay, it's time to go.

1633
01:38:35,873 --> 01:38:37,916
－当真？ －要去金库那裡了
- Really? - We gotta go to the vaults.

1634
01:38:39,835 --> 01:38:41,795
所以我们到底要不要做？
So, are we gonna do it or not?

1635
01:38:58,187 --> 01:39:00,939
－你还好吗？ －糟透了
-Are you okay? -God, no.

1636
01:39:01,815 --> 01:39:03,692
上帝真的是 你脑中陪审团的一员？
Is God really part of your in-head jury?

1637
01:39:03,776 --> 01:39:05,194
没错
Uh-huh.

1638
01:39:05,277 --> 01:39:09,239
澄清一下 上帝对我们的行动 没有任何意见
And for the record, God is absolutely fine with whatever it is that we decide to do.

1639
01:39:09,865 --> 01:39:11,408
太好了
That's good to know.

1640
01:39:12,701 --> 01:39:14,411
－你好 你是皮杰吧？ －是的
- Hi, there. P.J., right? - Yes, miss.

1641
01:39:14,495 --> 01:39:16,747
－请带路吧 －这边请
-Please lead the way -Lead the way.

1642
01:39:18,665 --> 01:39:21,335
埃德加爱伦坡 怎麽有点耳熟？
Why does the name Edgar Allen Poe ring a bell?

1643
01:39:28,133 --> 01:39:30,260
拿著哈裡斯鑽石的感觉 一定很美妙
It must be wonderful to have Harris diamonds

1644
01:39:30,344 --> 01:39:32,763
给你 别掉了
Here you are. Don't drop it

1645
01:39:35,224 --> 01:39:37,142
－谢谢 －不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1646
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:04,211
你要把那东西运到纽约？
You're shipping that thing to New York?

1647
01:40:10,092 --> 01:40:14,138
卡地亚代表请拨３５２

1651
01:40:36,201 --> 01:40:39,747
－水底世界主题 我的点子 －真不错
- It's an underwater theme. - Yeah.

1652
01:40:40,205 --> 01:40:42,624
你以前做得真不错
You're very good at what you do. What you did.

1653
01:40:44,001 --> 01:40:46,795
我们只要收拾珠宝 饰品
Okay, so we only need to pack up the jewelry and accessories.

1654
01:40:46,879 --> 01:40:49,423
衣服会收到楼下 所以应该不会太久
The clothing all goes downstairs,so it shouldn't take too long.

1655
01:40:49,506 --> 01:40:51,300
好 应该是吧
Yeah, not too long, so, uh...

1656
01:40:52,217 --> 01:40:53,552
我该拿出来吗？
Shall I take it out?

1657
01:40:54,636 --> 01:40:55,971
当然 拿吧
Yes. Why not?

1658
01:41:25,834 --> 01:41:27,836
－动作快 那些是食人鱼 －什麽？
-Do it quickly, the fish are piranhas. -- What?

1659
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,506
这是个象征
It's meant to be symbolic.

1660
01:41:30,589 --> 01:41:32,424
－象征什麽？ －我忘了啦
- Symbolic of... - I don't remember, okay.

1661
01:41:32,508 --> 01:41:35,135
反正动作快一点就不会有事
Just do it faster.You'll be fine.

1662
01:41:51,402 --> 01:41:53,362
就是这个时刻
So, this is the moment.

1663
01:41:54,655 --> 01:41:57,908
原来那麽容易
Just seems so easy.

1664
01:41:57,991 --> 01:42:01,036
问题本来就不是能否做到 重点是‥
It's never been about can we do it, Paxton.

1665
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:03,747
该不该做 要不要做 还有我们俩
It's about... should we do it?And will we do it? It's about you and me.

1666
01:42:03,831 --> 01:42:08,002
我们不一定会这样做 但如果真要如此
And I'm not saying that we are going to do it,but if we are,

1667
01:42:08,085 --> 01:42:11,005
那你就得往左踏一步
then you would need to take one step to your left.

1668
01:42:13,007 --> 01:42:15,509
我该踏出这一步吗？
So, shall I take the step?

1669
01:42:17,219 --> 01:42:19,263
先踏吧 到时候再看看
Take the step. Then, we decide.

1670
01:42:23,308 --> 01:42:24,768
琳达
Linda...

1671
01:42:24,852 --> 01:42:27,896
如果要此刻决定 我支持这麽做
if we are deciding in the moment,then I say we do it.

1672
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:29,523
若要顺其自然
If we are letting the moment decide,

1673
01:42:29,606 --> 01:42:33,736
我认为此刻天时地利人和
then, in my opinion, the moment is saying loud and clear...

1674
01:42:33,819 --> 01:42:36,989
把假鑽放进箱子 真鑽放到你的包包
"Put the replica in the fucking box and put the real thing in your bag."

1675
01:42:39,366 --> 01:42:41,910
自由‥
Freedom,

1676
01:42:41,994 --> 01:42:44,371
尽在这美丽的一刻
Linda, in one beautiful moment.

1677
01:43:16,153 --> 01:43:20,074
－天啊 －好了‥
-god -Okay.

1678
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:25,579
都在掌控之中‥
It's under control.

1679
01:43:27,581 --> 01:43:31,043
好 我们先处理手提包吧
Yeah.I think we should start with the handbags,

1680
01:43:31,126 --> 01:43:33,921
应该用防尘袋套住‥
and, uh, we should get the dust bags...

1681
01:43:34,004 --> 01:43:36,590
－琳达‥是我 －唐诺
- Linda, it's me. - Donald.

1682
01:43:36,674 --> 01:43:40,344
我有急事要找你谈
I need to speak to you urgently.

1683
01:43:40,427 --> 01:43:43,889
不好意思 你能到旁边散散步吗？
Um, excuse me, could you please take a stroll or something for a moment?

1684
01:43:43,972 --> 01:43:46,350
我有重要公事要找同事
I have some very important things to say to my colleague.

1685
01:43:54,983 --> 01:43:58,445
唐诺 我以为‥
Donald...Well, goodness,

1686
01:43:58,529 --> 01:44:00,739
我开除你了 你怎麽还在这儿
I thought that I fired you,but you're here.

1687
01:44:00,823 --> 01:44:01,865
琳达 听著
Linda, listen.

1688
01:44:01,949 --> 01:44:04,702
有匿名人士打给米拉克总公司
Someone made an anonymous call to Miracore head office.

1689
01:44:04,785 --> 01:44:10,582
说载运伊芙许沃珠宝的司机 用的是假名
They said that the driver from B2B who is carrying the Eve Schwarz collection

1690
01:44:10,666 --> 01:44:12,835
还说他有前科
They said he's got a criminal record.

1691
01:44:13,836 --> 01:44:15,838
奶奶 够了
Grandma, hey.

1692
01:44:15,921 --> 01:44:18,173
我尽快赶来了 幸好你没事
I came as soon as I could. Thank God you're okay.

1693
01:44:18,257 --> 01:44:20,050
－我没事 －警察要来了
- I'm okay. - Well, the police are coming.

1694
01:44:20,134 --> 01:44:22,553
－警察要来了‥ －随时会到
- The police are coming and... - They'll be here any minute.

1695
01:44:22,636 --> 01:44:25,973
随时会到？ 那要跟时间赛跑了
They'll be here any minute. Okay, that's...Now we're against the clock.

1696
01:44:26,056 --> 01:44:28,559
如果他没说谎 真的是清白的‥
Uh, if he's innocent and who he says he is,then everything will...

1697
01:44:28,642 --> 01:44:30,644
那一切就会没事 一定会的
Everything will be okay.And it will be okay,

1698
01:44:30,728 --> 01:44:32,771
因为我知道该怎麽做
Donald, because I know what to do.What do you mean?

1699
01:44:32,855 --> 01:44:34,064
什麽意思？
What are you going to do?

1700
01:44:34,148 --> 01:44:35,858
－帕斯顿 －帕斯顿？
- Paxton? - Paxton?

1701
01:44:38,027 --> 01:44:40,362
唐诺 这位是帕斯顿
Donald. Paxton.

1702
01:44:40,446 --> 01:44:42,698
－帕斯顿 这位是唐诺 －你是谁？
-Paxton. Donald. -Who are you?

1703
01:44:42,781 --> 01:44:44,199
我就是埃德加爱伦坡
I'm Edgar Allen Poe, obviously.

1704
01:44:44,283 --> 01:44:45,325
她明明说帕斯顿
She just called you Paxton.

1705
01:44:45,409 --> 01:44:46,994
他是帕斯顿
Yes, Donald, this is Paxton.

1706
01:44:47,077 --> 01:44:50,831
而我是个普通女人 名叫琳达贾维斯
And I'm a woman called Linda Jarvis.

1707
01:44:50,914 --> 01:44:55,627
我六十秒前做了一个重大决定
I'm an ordinary woman who, 60 seconds ago,made an extraordinary decision.

1708
01:44:55,711 --> 01:44:57,046
琳达 你要说什麽？
Linda, what are you going to tell him?

1709
01:44:57,129 --> 01:45:02,134
－跟他有何关系？ －有关系的地方是‥
-What is it to do with you? -What it has to do with him is that...

1710
01:45:02,217 --> 01:45:05,429
他是我十年以来的 合作伙伴与伴侣
he is my partner and my lover of ten years standing,

1711
01:45:05,512 --> 01:45:07,514
－我觉得自己还爱著他 －真的吗？
-and I think I'm still in love with him. -Really?

1712
01:45:07,598 --> 01:45:10,893
但最重要的是 他也是我的共犯
But most importantly, he is also my accomplice.

1713
01:45:10,976 --> 01:45:13,354
唐诺 就在刚刚 一分锺之前
You see, Donald, just now... just one minute ago,

1714
01:45:13,437 --> 01:45:15,230
我决定‥我们决定
I decided... We decided

1715
01:45:15,314 --> 01:45:17,649
偷走价值三百万英镑的 哈裡斯鑽石
to steal the Harris Diamond worth three million pounds.

1716
01:45:17,733 --> 01:45:19,318
该死 又在告解了
Holy fuck. Confession avalanche.

1717
01:45:19,401 --> 01:45:21,695
没事的 我认识唐诺 我们也没退路了
No, it's okay, and I know Donald

1718
01:45:21,779 --> 01:45:24,323
毕竟唐诺已经报警 警察随时会来
and also we don't have a choice,because Donald called the police

1719
01:45:24,406 --> 01:45:26,450
－如我所说 一切都会没事 －该死
-and they're about to arrive at any second. - Oh, fuck!

1720
01:45:26,533 --> 01:45:29,828
等警察到这裡 我们也早就离开了
it's going to be okay, because when the police arrive be here, we are going to be gone.

1721
01:45:29,912 --> 01:45:31,830
－是吗？ －没错
- You are? - Yes, we are.

1722
01:45:31,914 --> 01:45:33,207
等会儿你就告诉警察
And Donald is going to tell them

1723
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:35,417
你已经和琳达聊过 她说一切安好
that he talked to Linda and she said that everything's fine,

1724
01:45:35,501 --> 01:45:36,960
这都只是误会
it was all a misunderstanding.

1725
01:45:37,044 --> 01:45:39,380
然后你再给他们这个
And then, he is going to give them this,

1726
01:45:40,005 --> 01:45:41,715
身份认证文件
your ID verification.

1727
01:45:41,799 --> 01:45:45,177
就说你在某次运送 看过那个司机
And you're going to say that you recognize that driver

1728
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:46,720
接著跟他们说一个故事
from another assignment.And then, you're going to tell them a story.

1729
01:45:46,804 --> 01:45:50,974
说这位司机在公司有个死对头
You're going to tell them a story about how this enemy at work who hates him.

1730
01:45:51,058 --> 01:45:52,267
－真要我这样？ －当然
- I am? - Yes, you are.

1731
01:45:52,351 --> 01:45:55,020
知道你为何要照做吗 唐诺？
And do you know why you're going to do all this, Donald?

1732
01:45:55,104 --> 01:45:57,690
－为什麽？ －因为我们是好人
- No. Why? - Because we are good.

1733
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:00,484
帕斯顿 唐诺 我们三个都是好人
Paxton, Donald, we three are good.

1734
01:46:00,567 --> 01:46:03,862
不管是叫我开除你的混帐 还是买鑽石的无赖
And the bastards who told me to fire you and the bastard who bought that diamond,

1735
01:46:03,946 --> 01:46:06,115
他们根本不会发现鑽石不见了
they won't even realize that it's gone.

1736
01:46:06,198 --> 01:46:08,701
－提一下健保局 －对‥
- Mention the NHS. - Yeah. Yes, ooh!

1737
01:46:11,161 --> 01:46:12,913
唐诺 意下如何？
What do you say, Donald?

1738
01:46:12,996 --> 01:46:15,708
你愿意为我们说谎吗？
Will you lie for us, Donald?

1739
01:46:17,543 --> 01:46:21,755
这一切混乱都是封城造成的
I see all this anarchy is because of lockdown.

1740
01:46:21,839 --> 01:46:25,634
封城既愚蠢又荒谬 却解放了我们所有人
Idiotic, insane fucking lockdown which has liberated us all.

1741
01:46:25,718 --> 01:46:27,136
我们分你钱 廿万元
Donald, we'll give you money. I'll give you 200 grand.

1742
01:46:27,219 --> 01:46:29,680
谁管钱 我不是为了钱 而是为了那一点美好
Fuck the money. I don't do this for money,I do this for beauty.

1743
01:46:29,763 --> 01:46:32,975
你们实在太棒了 琳达
Linda, you are wonderful.

1744
01:46:33,058 --> 01:46:35,644
你的这位秘密盗贼爱人
Linda, and he is your secret bandit lover,

1745
01:46:35,728 --> 01:46:39,648
两人携手反抗庞大的全球势力
and you are going to spit in the face of the global monolith.

1746
01:46:39,732 --> 01:46:42,151
封城期间 我有时间好好思考
During lockdown I've had time

1747
01:46:42,234 --> 01:46:44,903
在我妈住处旁边的公园散步
to think and walk in the park near my mother's house,

1748
01:46:44,987 --> 01:46:48,741
除了那些遛狗慢跑的人 到处呼吸吐气
and God, apart from the dog walkers and the joggers

1749
01:46:48,824 --> 01:46:51,410
老天 这世界美丽极了
breathing everywhere, God, it is a beautiful world.

1750
01:46:51,493 --> 01:46:55,914
就算是疫情前 我们也受限于日常琐事中
Even before the fucking virus,we were all locked down in our own routines,

1751
01:46:55,998 --> 01:46:58,667
－我们对自己的想像‥ －再不走就惨了
-our versions of ourselves... -Linda, we have to get the fuck out of here.

1752
01:46:58,751 --> 01:47:01,420
－让唐诺抒发一下 －从来不能工作
-Let Donald have his moment. -...never get to work!

1753
01:47:01,503 --> 01:47:03,464
我担心你 所以今晚才会来
I only came here tonight

1754
01:47:03,547 --> 01:47:06,467
我才不管米拉克或是臭鑽石
I don't give a fuck about Miracore,their fucking diamonds,

1755
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:07,968
我才不在乎
I don't care about them.

1756
01:47:08,052 --> 01:47:11,055
我希望所有东西都被偷走
I want everything to be stolen.

1757
01:47:11,138 --> 01:47:14,183
我愿意为了你说谎 琳达
I will lie for you, Linda,

1758
01:47:14,266 --> 01:47:20,147
因为我这个人终于能做点什麽了
because this is my moment to fucking do something!

1759
01:47:32,409 --> 01:47:34,995
－还真是一团乱 －是啊
-Mad, all this, isn't it? -Yeah.

1760
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:38,290
几个月前 谁想得到我们会这样？
Who'd have thought a month ago we'd be doing this.

1761
01:47:38,374 --> 01:47:40,167
我就料不到
Not me.

1762
01:47:41,835 --> 01:47:47,424
埃德加爱伦坡‥ 请至保全室
Paging Edgar Allen Poe.Edgar Allen Poe, please report to security.

1763
01:48:02,189 --> 01:48:06,568
埃德加爱伦坡先生 请立刻至保全室
Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,please report to security immediately.

1764
01:48:06,652 --> 01:48:08,404
我们得快一点
I think we should speed up.

1765
01:48:08,487 --> 01:48:10,823
急什麽 又不是在撤离敦克尔克
Don't rush. We're not trying to evacuate Dunkirk!

1766
01:48:10,906 --> 01:48:14,451
慢著 拿纸箱的话 应该要走右边
Stop there. If you walk,you should be on the starboard side.

1767
01:48:16,745 --> 01:48:18,163
别管了‥
Leave it. Leave it.

1768
01:48:19,498 --> 01:48:20,791
琳达？
Linda?

1769
01:48:21,375 --> 01:48:26,839
埃德加爱伦坡先生‥ 请至保全室
Paging Edgar Allen Poe.Mr. Edgar Allen Poe, please report to security.

1770
01:48:26,922 --> 01:48:29,591
我是麦克啊 跟你视讯过 拿箭头那个
It's Michael with the arrows from Zoom.

1771
01:48:35,973 --> 01:48:40,894
埃德加爱伦坡先生 请立刻至保全室
Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,please report to security immediately.

1772
01:48:43,313 --> 01:48:44,732
该死
Oh, fuck.

1773
01:48:44,815 --> 01:48:46,817
你得交出哈洛德百货的通行证
You'll have to turn in your Harrods pass.

1774
01:48:46,900 --> 01:48:49,319
你走吧 别管我 命运捉弄我一个人就够了
You go. Save yourself.It's me that fate is fucking with.

1775
01:48:49,403 --> 01:48:51,196
继续走就对了
Just keep walking.

1776
01:48:53,073 --> 01:48:54,324
埃德加爱伦坡
Edgar Allen Poe.

1777
01:48:59,204 --> 01:49:00,998
他把这个掉在办公室了
You left this in the office.

1778
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:04,293
在希斯洛机场会用到
You'll need it at Heathrow.

1779
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:09,214
感激不尽
Thanks very much.

1780
01:49:10,382 --> 01:49:13,469
琳达 大家都希望你赶快回来
Everybody says, uh, come back soon, Linda,

1781
01:49:13,552 --> 01:49:15,137
我们爱你
and we all love you.

1782
01:49:49,421 --> 01:49:53,133
{\an8}欢迎莅临希斯洛机场

1783
01:50:20,953 --> 01:50:23,997
那晚我们讨论过 虽然我们发大财了
Since that night, we've established that although we're now both rich

1784
01:50:24,081 --> 01:50:26,041
也不必再做自己鄙视的工作
and no longer have to do jobs we despise,

1785
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:28,919
封城造成的压力 还是大大考验了我们的感情
the strains of lockdown are still severely testing our relationship.

1786
01:50:29,003 --> 01:50:32,715
我们好聚好散 不要把面粉私藏起来
"Happy ever after" cannot survive someone hiding your bag of flour.

1787
01:50:32,798 --> 01:50:35,217
好吧 等等
Okay, come on. Okay.

1788
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:36,719
你的面粉在这儿
Here is your bag of flour. I just...

1789
01:50:36,802 --> 01:50:39,930
答应我 你不要做面包
I want you to promise me that you're not gonna make bread.

1790
01:50:40,014 --> 01:50:41,098
为什麽？
Why not?

1791
01:50:41,181 --> 01:50:43,350
因为会一团乱 而且毫无意义
Because of the mess and the pointlessness

1792
01:50:43,434 --> 01:50:44,852
做好的面包也不能吃
and because it will be inedible, and like all homemade bread,

1793
01:50:44,935 --> 01:50:47,312
手作面包就是 毫无意义的混乱
it will be a fucking pointless cannonball.

1794
01:50:47,396 --> 01:50:49,189
我爸以前会做面包 我们必须吃掉
My dad used to make it and we had to eat it,

1795
01:50:49,273 --> 01:50:53,402
否则他会躲进工作室 用木头做可悲的玩具
otherwise he would disappear into his workshop and make these hopeless wooden toys.

1796
01:50:53,485 --> 01:50:55,154
－别重蹈覆辙 －琳达 你疯了
- Never again. - Linda, you've lost your mind.

1797
01:50:55,237 --> 01:50:59,533
什麽‥你可是埋了一只刺蝟 还在墓旁念悼词
What? I've lost...You buried a hedgehog and said a eulogy over the fucking grave.

1798
01:50:59,616 --> 01:51:03,746
－你还故意在天花板贴金葱 －那本来就在那裡
-And you deliberately stuck a piece of tinsel on the ceiling - above the stairs.

1799
01:51:03,829 --> 01:51:05,080
你差点害我脖子断了
I almost broke my fucking neck.

1800
01:51:05,164 --> 01:51:06,832
若你当初要我帮忙 我会拿梯子给你
If you'd asked me,I would have held the stepladders.

1801
01:51:06,915 --> 01:51:09,335
要是本来就在那裡 我铁定会注意到
If it had been there "all along,"I would have noticed it.

1802
01:51:09,418 --> 01:51:12,171
但你没注意到 整理行李根本没用
But you haven't noticed that there was no point in packing a suitcase

1803
01:51:12,254 --> 01:51:14,673
因为你根本没地方可去
because there is nowhere you can actually go.

1804

该死
Oh, shit.

1806
01:51:29,021 --> 01:51:33,067
大吵大闹就为了一包面粉 还有本来就有的金葱
All that for a bag of flour and a definitely pre-existing piece of tinsel.

1807
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:35,235

1814
01:52:00,803 --> 01:52:04,431
－竟然还要两周 －没错
- Another two weeks? - Another two weeks.

1815
01:52:04,515 --> 01:52:09,603
看来又需要一首诗 抚慰受苦许久的人们
Well, then, my long suffering public may need another poem.

”等那天到来 封城就会终结”

”不是别处 就是这裡”
It's either somewhere else or here

1830
01:52:59,153 --> 01:53:01,488
