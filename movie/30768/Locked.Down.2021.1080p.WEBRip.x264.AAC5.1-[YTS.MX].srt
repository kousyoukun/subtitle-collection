1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Before you say anything,
I'm not your brother.

2
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm your half-brother.

3
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What was that?

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Why would you begin
a conversation like that?

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Because you are about
to ask me for money,

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and when I always say,
"Why should I

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
you always say,
"Because I am your brother,"

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and I never point out
you are my half-brother.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I never say it. But things
happening around here lately--

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hi, Paxton. How are
your erratic head movements?

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I ask
because I read an article.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, they're under control.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How's the, uh,
cement art work?

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
She just sold a piece
for $50,000.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
A frozen waterfall.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It felt appropriate
for the times.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How is it appropriate
for the times?

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I was actually calling
to see how you were.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
'Cause I heard
it's bad in New York.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It is bad.
They canceled the NBA.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We heard London's
under total lockdown.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've been furloughed
by the way.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's great!
-Yeah.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now there is literally zero
purpose to my life.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How is Linda?

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, she's somewhere
in the house.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is there
some type of issue?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is there an issue?
Let me see.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Convenient lie to avoid
forensic examination

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
of our domestic circumstances
or tell the truth?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, convenient lie.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No. There is no issue.
We are fine.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Can you tell her
I'm gonna Skype her?

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Also, David,
I've sold my motorbike.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You've what?

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, I have a buyer.
He'll pay me

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
when we are all unlocked

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
from this fucking prison
of psychological hell-chains.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Fucking flames
of burning aloneness.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The screw of isolation
until you can't tell

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
what is your body
and what is furniture.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No possibility
of revving the engine

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and riding away. Am I conveying
anything of my mood to you?

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why have you sold your bike?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You are your bike.
Your bike is you.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah, I have sold myself.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I have sold my former self.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I felt sorry for the bike.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It deserved someone who can do
justice to its spirit.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Someone who still
breaks the fucking rules.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So, you and Linda, what,
you had a fight?

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Linda said she was planning
to end our thing,

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
our relationship,
our whatever this ever was,

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
because we'd grown apart,

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
meaning that she had gone up
and I have gone down.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
She was planning to end it
before lockdown was announced.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
...droplets and moisture
because we were shouting.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I said some things
and she said some things

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and now
we are stuck here together

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
with the things we said

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
echoing around the house
like fucking bells ringing.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For two weeks
we are locked together here.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Anyway. Truth be told,
I just wanted

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
-And you chose us?
-Yeah, why not?

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What happened to Mike?
Your friend Mike.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, no, no. Mike and I
are no longer speaking.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He crossed...
My delivery!

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Crossed an important threshold
when, uh, when he said that

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the COVID virus
was the consequence

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
of the secret release by Jews
of alien DNA

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
into the
water sprinkling system

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
of a Chinese golf resort.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It looks like
your food has arrived,

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
-so we'll let you go.
-It's not food,

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, hang in, brother.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
-Half-brother.
-  Tell Linda

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, I'll leave her a note.
Just to compound the oddness.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The stark reality
of fighting Coronavirus...

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
...Trafalgar Square in London
usually crowded.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Evidence of social distancing
in action.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
In this critically
important time,

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the Prime Minister
Boris Johnson himself infected,

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but been sharing...

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Maria, hey!
Is everything okay?

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everything's great.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You know, we're staying strong.
Yeah, we just talked to Paxton.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hmm. Yes, I head. Some of it.
I put a pillow over my head.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He said you had symptoms.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It passed I think. I hope.
I don't know.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, green smoothie.
You must send me that recipe.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not a recipe,
it's an action.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You just put the green stuff in
and press the on button.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How are things
with you and Paxton?

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is everything okay?

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You know
everything is not okay.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Not only
is everything not okay,

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
nothing is okay.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Everything is never okay.
Even his name is not okay.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is him speaking.
He says even his name

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's how he is lately.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He's changed so much.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh, we all change.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I mean, Linda, you've evolved,
he's mutated.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He needs some help.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
-I read an article--
-Do you know he said

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
that any man over 35
who rides a bus is a failure?

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
-He rides the bus every day.
Or he used to.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
-He does it to torture himself.
-No man is ever really

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, I heard
he's selling his motorbike.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's a big step.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, we both agreed
that he needed some time,

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
so he's planning on using
the money from selling the bike

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
to go to Kazakhstan
to think about his life.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why Kazakhstan?

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We went on a road trip there
ten years ago.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ten years ago?
A million years ago.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Anyway, now he is stuck here,
and I am stuck here.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
-Linda, is there someone else?
-Nope, just me and him.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No, I mean, like,
another man.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
-No.
-A woman?

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was just speculating.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thinking about that night
we came to London

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, that was just weed
and curiosity.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We both had orgasms, Linda.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You know they say these calls
aren't really the most secure.

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think
about that night sometimes.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
-You do?
-Yeah, don't you?

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Mmm... Listen, Maria,
I've been on Skype

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The office is locked down.
I really gotta

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
-I love you.
-What?

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
-God.
-

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Paxton, are you
going somewhere?

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Where would I be going?

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why is the hose
in your exhaust?

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I was just gonna
take a selfie.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Someone at work texted me
and asked how I was

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
coping with lockdown.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So I was gonna send
a photo of myself

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
with the hose shoved
up my helmet by way of reply.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I thought it'd be funny.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
An amusing expression
of despair.

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You were really
just gonna take a selfie?

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, I had the phone
in my hand.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You weren't gonna
start the engine?

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And go where?
You can't go anywhere.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I came in here
and I could smell

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And the smell...
it made me very sad

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That shelf's covered in oil,
you're gonna get your ass

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
-Jesus, what a day!
-Bad?

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
No, just work.
I had some bad news.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Nothing compared
to... everything.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I really was just gonna
take a selfie, by the way.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
"By the way,"
"just so you know,"

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Just... just a little game.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Or a rehearsal.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm not-- Please don't think
I'm looking for anything.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You know Maria just called me
and said that she loves me?

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
-What?
-I know.

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Secrets coming out
all over the place.

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You got the key
to get back in?

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
-No.
-I'll leave the door

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What's wrong?

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You playing
with the hoses and exhausts

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and we carry on
as if everything was normal.

168
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm not normal lately,
I know that.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I haven't been
sleeping at all.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I've never been normal, but...

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I used to be
quite proud of it.

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
-Just what?
-I don't know.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm just acutely aware
of the inconvenience it causes.

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
My super analysis
of every grain of sand.

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Every word.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Being locked up
is making it worse.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We have to find
some way of getting

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We're only together because
we're in the same house.

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We can sort of move around
each other until we're free...

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
-What? What is it?
-Oh, nothing.

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Good night.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's a bit of
Christmas decoration.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's been there
since Christmas.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
My therapist says
I should try to tolerate it.

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
To use it as a test.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Up until now, I've been able
to live with it,

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
as a test
to prove my progress.

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, fuck progress.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
-Why don't you take it down?
-No, my therapist says--

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
-Fuck the therapist. Paxton--
-You almost did.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Grow up. Take it down.

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If it bothers you,
take it down, okay?

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Christmas is not exactly
a great memory anyway, is it?

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Christmas is not
a great memory.

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Beginning of the end for us,
don't you think?

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That was way before Christmas
for me.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Sorry.

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Why do people think
honesty is good?

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What are you doing
about therapy anyway?

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm doing it on Zoom.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
-My therapist has antlers
on his wall.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
These are extraordinary
circumstances, Paxton.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You can't live with a woman
who has dumped you

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and a piece of tinsel
on the ceiling.

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
-Have we decided
to laugh about all this?

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Nothing else
we can do there,

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Do you want a chair?

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Sure.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
-

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Bravo.

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
-Fuck! That's better.
-Hang on.

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You know, when I saw you
in the garage I thought...

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
"Was it really me
on the back of your bike

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, it was you.

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Hanging on and screaming.

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, that's what
I'm doing now.

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hanging on and screaming,
but you can't hear me.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Nobody can.
Anyway, good night.

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Screaming about what?

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What are you screaming about?
I'm the one that's screaming!

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Hello, stranger!

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hi.
-How are you?

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Terrible. You?

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Awful.

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Hello!

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Does anyone here in our lovely
Portland Street prison

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I read a lot of poetry

228
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and I've read even more lately
'cause I can't sleep.

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's actually quite a nice way
to discover

230
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
that you're not
the only human being on earth

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Paxton!

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What the fuck
are you doing?

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm entertaining
our fellow inmates.

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This poem
is called  Stand Up!

235
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's by D.H. Lawrence,
by the way.

236
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
"By the way,"
"just so you know,"

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
All right, here goes.

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
"Stand up,
but not for Jesus!

239
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's a little late for that.

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Stand up for justice
and a jolly life.

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll hold your hat.

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Stand up, stand up for justice,
ye swindled little blokes!

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Stand up and do some punching,
give 'em a few hard pokes.

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Stand up for a new arrangement
for a chance of life all round,

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
for freedom
and the fun of living,

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
break in,
and hold the ground!"

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
-

248
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Thank you.

249
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sorry if I woke you.

250
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But I am going
slightly mad lately.

251
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
My advice to everyone

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
is to use
these strange times

253
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
to steal all the things
that you think life owes you.

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Go to sleep,
you bloody tosser!

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, well, if I could
I would.

256
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Hey, leave him be, mate!

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And if I come across any other
good poems, I'll share it.

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We love it!

259
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Good night, Portland Street.

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Night, night!

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Thank you!

262
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
God, please let me sleep.

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I swear to God!

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What the fuck are you doing
in my garden?

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You all right?

266
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
-We're just gathering these.
-They're just poppies.

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
They're bulbs of poppies.

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
All the dealers in our estate
have been arrested,

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
because they're the only people
out on the streets, innit?

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
With these poppy bulbs,
you can make a sort of opium.

271
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You just slit the skins
and juice comes out.

272
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
How did you know
they were here?

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We live in that tower block
up there, bro.

274
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Friend of ours has a telescope.
He's into stars and shit.

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We've been looking down
on houses for a laugh.

276
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Looking through windows
and then we saw all these

277
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What the fuck are they all
doing growing in my garden?

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think hippies
used to squat in these houses

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I think they grew them
and they just went wild.

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
How do you refine
the juice?

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You don't. You just drip it
onto tobacco

282
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Or you can mix it
with Coca-Cola if you want

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah, well,
I don't smoke anymore

284
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
or do drugs of any kind,

285
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
but back in the bad old days
I did smoke quite a lot

286
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is not
as strong as heroin.

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's quite a gentle hit.

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
-It's organic, bro.
-Organic?

289
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah.

290
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That would explain
the hedgehog.

291
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There's a hedgehog
in this garden who is

292
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Would a very small amount
help you sleep, do you think?

293
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You sleep like a baby.
Smooths everything out.

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
-No mean voices in the night.
-No mean voices in the night.

295
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That would be nice.
Well, well, well.

296
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Paxton!

297
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Paxton, for fuck's sake!

298
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hey, Toby!

299
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
-Hi.
-Hey, how's the cough?

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
A bit better I think.
How are you?

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I had it I think,
but it's passed.

302
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's like a Valkyrie.

303
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What?

304
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's a Viking spirit who,
before battles, decides

305
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
who will live
and who will die.

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Valkyries, uh,
make their choices

307
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
No morality,
no good or bad.

308
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's just so unfair
how some people

309
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Toby, you're back.
How are you?

310
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Gangster. Thank you.

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
-Hello!
-Donald!

312
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You got a tie on.

313
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
One of my father's old ones.

314
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I've become nostalgic
for old-fashioned formality.

315
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
On these Zoom things,
I always imagine every man

316
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
-Ooh!
-

317
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Donald, is that
your house?

318
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Uh, no. I'm at my mother's.
Anthony threw me out.

319
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh! That's not allowed,
is it?

320
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We had an awful night,
and everything came out.

321
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We found out we, uh,
hate each other. So...

322
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Hi!

323
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Uh, Melissa.
Hey, how is Italy?

324
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, I'm in Sweden.

325
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
-What?
-Look.

326
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You can go to bars here.

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Hmm. Is anybody
obeying the rules?

328
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
After ten years sober,
that was fucking smart.

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Wait, who are we waiting for?

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
-Timothy, I think.
-Oh, is Timothy okay?

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Why wouldn't he be?

332
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, he's got
an underlying

333
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
-Do you know which one?
-No.

334
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He just seemed
like a sort of person

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
who would have
an underlying health condition.

336
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Shall we just start
without Timothy?

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
By the way,
I am also wearing shoes.

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
- Seriously,

339
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I have something to say.
Something important.

340
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
-

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, um, hang on.
Oh, it's a message

342
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
-God!
-Has he got it?

343
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
"Dear, Linda.
As of 9:00 a.m. this morning,

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I am resigning my position
at Miracore Media

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
with immediate effect.
I have had time alone

346
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and I've realized
that what this company does

347
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
is just self-indulgent
media bullshit,

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
supporting corrosive
international capitalism

349
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We should be using
our creativity

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
not sell handbags
to the wives

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yours in isolation. Timothy."

352
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Just been watching
David Attenborough

353
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Did he snap?

354
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Okay, so there's no need
to wait for Timothy.

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let's get this done.

356
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Sounds awfully grave, Linda.

357
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Daddy, Daddy.
-Shh. Daddy's on a call.

358
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yesterday, I had
a very long Zoom call

359
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
All continents
were represented.

360
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And it seems
that all over the world

361
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
the company is facing
the same issues

362
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
As CEO of Miracore UK,
it is my...

363
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
unfortunate duty
to let you know

364
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
that there will be
some furloughing of employees

365
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And also a number
of compulsory redundancies

366
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
effective from today.

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I assume the Inuit system
of leaving the old

368
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Donald, please don't jump
to conclusions.

369
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Linda, what do you mean?

370
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Uh, in normal times,
I would've gathered

371
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Everyone?

372
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Everyone on this Zoom call
is on this call

373
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
because all of your positions
have been deemed

374
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and as of today your contracts
of employment with Miracore

375
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Okay.

376
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm glad I'm home.

377
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm going to feed
the fucking chickens.

378
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
This is really bad, Linda.
How do you sleep?

379
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Hello!

380
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Hello.

381
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Look at my dinosaur.

382
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Daddy...

383
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Malcolm, I thought
being furloughed

384
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
meant that the government
pays your wages,

385
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
but you don't do any work.

386
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah, it does,
it does, it does.

387
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But COVID
makes everything different.

388
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So sad. So sad.

389
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
All of this is impacting
on everyone

390
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, but I'm not in
your pastoral care, right?

391
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I work for you.

392
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And all I wanna know is,

393
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
if I am furloughed,
why are you asking me

394
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's illegal, isn't it?

395
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm a Christian man.

396
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
We all know that you are
a Christian man.

397
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You say it like I ram it
down your throats.

398
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I do not ram it down
your fucking throat.

399
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Malcolm, just tell me,
what is it that you want me

400
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
We have a situation, Paxton.

401
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, I'm leaving this call
unless you tell me.

402
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I sat through your prayer.

403
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I begin every FaceTime
with a prayer.

404
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
My choice. Right?
I'm the boss.

405
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah, you are the boss.
So what do you want me

406
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Due to lockdown, all the major
department stores

407
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
B2B Pro Freight Services
are among several

408
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
which have been asked to
transport valuable retail items

409
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
to secure storage facilities
in shitholes like Dagenham.

410
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The fabric, Paxton,
of our society is torn,

411
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Fears of rioting and looting.
Pestilence. Apocalyptic words.

412
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm giving you ten seconds
to tell me what it is

413
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
-Ten, nine, eight...
-Because of this crisis,

414
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
-Drivers like you.
-...seven, six, five...

415
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Department stores
only allow their goods to be

416
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
-who do not
have criminal records.

417
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I repeat.

418
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
B2B Pro Freight Services
have urgent need for drivers

419
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
registered to us who do not
have criminal records.

420
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So why are you
talking to me?

421
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I have contracts
to carry valuables

422
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
across London, and they
all want everything out

423
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And I only have
two fucking drivers.

424
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So what's your solution?

425
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Deception. Forgiveness.
Redemption. Bunce.

426
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
What the fuck is bunce?

427
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Old East End word
for cash, Paxton,

428
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
in return
for grand deception.

429
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Facilitated by my forgiveness
and your redemption.

430
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
All right, get there.
Get there, Malcolm.

431
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I've printed off an ID
with a security level A2.

432
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Clean. With your photo on it
and a name.

433
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It is not your name.

434
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I can't officially take you
off furlough and give you

435
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
because you used to be
a bike slag,

436
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
so I will have to pretend
you are someone else

437
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You've worked for this company
as a driver for seven years.

438
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And I have never had
a single complaint.

439
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You've only ever driven
low value packages,

440
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
but I believe you are a man
who can be trusted.

441
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That I am.

442
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, I can be trusted.

443
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I mean, what happened
was a long time ago.

444
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Yeah, I don't wanna to know.

445
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
No, it was biker versus biker.

446
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The Lord forgives.
B2B Pro Freight Services

447
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
If it wasn't for the fucking
convictions from that night,

448
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
my whole life would've been
radically different.

449
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Two hundred a day in cash.

450
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't care about the cash.
I wanna make a deal

451
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Look, I will do this
on the condition

452
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that when this is all over,
you will consider me

453
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
My entire life
has been fucked up

454
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
because of things I did
on one night.

455
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
My wife...

456
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
-My wife has grown out of me,

457
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
because I am still Mr. Fuck-All
behind the wheel of a van.

458
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I am not stupid.

459
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I read poetry.

460
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I could be someone.

461
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I've got another call,
Paxton.

462
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It is a very busy time,
the West End is going mad.

463
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Will you do it?

464
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
All right, if I do this
for you, Malcolm,

465
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I want you to practice
what you preach.

466
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
About forgiveness,
and lost sheep and redemption,

467
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
all of it, and give me
a chance to come off the road.

468
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Everything
is possible, Paxton.

469
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
God bless you.

470
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Selfridges, Thursday.
Harvey Nichols, Friday.

471
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
-Right, yeah.
-I will e-mail

472
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and your new identity.

473
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay, okay. And after...
After Harrods on Saturday--

474
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
God bless you, Paxton.

475
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
-

476
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Shit.

477
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Hey, Linda,
how's lockdown?

478
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's pretty bad.

479
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
How's Chicago?

480
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm in Vermont.

481
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah, moved the family
out to Vermont.

482
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We're all here crazy happy.

483
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Kids make a lot of noise,
so I got these

484
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Noise canceling. They work,
like, you literally

485
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
No, I don't have those.

486
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I can see in your face

487
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
that you, uh, spoke
to the guys at Events

488
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Update. Yeah.
Yeah, I updated them.

489
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
-Did you read them

490
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The stuff
about the Miracore family?

491
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
No, no, no, I didn't think
that would translate. Um--

492
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Linda, I wrote that message
from the heart. I really meant

493
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I can't believe you didn't
read it out to them.

494
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I didn't think it was
appropriate to say

495
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and there comes a time
in every family's life

496
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
when it's best if some family
members fly the nest."

497
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Why is that not appropriate?

498
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Because they're not
flying the nest, are they?

499
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They're being
thrown out of the nest

500
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
into the long grass
under the tree.

501
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
There's no tree.
What tree?

502
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's your nest, Guy.
You came up with the analogy

503
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So there has to be a tree.

504
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Do you have
a temperature, Linda?

505
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Um, there are two big events
which were already set up

506
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
One was at Westfield,

507
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
the other one was
the Eve Schwarz store takeover

508
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But both Westfield and Harrods
have closed their door.

509
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I love Harrods.

510
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah, I love Harrods, too.

511
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I worked there for five years,
they were the happiest

512
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Anyway, the launch
of Eve Schwarz collection

513
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
so I chose Harrods
because of its size

514
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
You chose?
I thought Melissa was

515
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah. Sometimes I questioned
her-- It doesn't matter.

516
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You've been carrying that
department a long time.

517
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah, well, they were family,
weren't they?

518
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And that's what
you do with family.

519
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You carry them until
you get a direction

520
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and then
you dutifully drop them.

521
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Anyway, at Harrods,
we have five million dollars

522
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
clothing and accessories
already installed

523
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
and store takeover
under Miracore liability.

524
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And that includes
the Harris Diamond

525
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
which was to be
the centerpiece of the show.

526
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The Harris Diamond is under
our insurance liability?

527
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's, um...

528
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
It's safe in the Harrods'
secure vault, but, yes.

529
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I suggested to the people
at Eve Schwarz

530
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
that we put everything into
Harrods' secure storage

531
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
until this, um...

532
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Uh, until this situation
is ended.

533
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But we have a problem
with insurance. You see...

534
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Uh...

535
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So, Eve Schwarz's
insurance policy

536
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
means that
they are not allowed

537
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
except under their own
corporate supervision.

538
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So the merchandise

539
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
will have to be
taken out of the store

540
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Anyway, the stores
are allocating for collection.

541
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We have Westfield on Friday,
Harrods on Saturday.

542
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then we discuss
your role and your salary.

543
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
-There'll be a lot

544
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
-Things are changing.
-That's excellent news.

545
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Say hello to London.

546
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
-Enjoy Vermont.
-  You bet.

547
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What? Oh, fuck! Quinn!

548
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
- I'm going to the land

549
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
to buy some milk.

550
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Do we need anything else?

551
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I say the word "we" without
any attempt to suggest

552
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
but there's no point in us
both going separately

553
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's getting rough
out there.

554
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And increasingly, I think

555
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
people like me
who have spent time

556
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
are thriving
in this new reality.

557
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh, you know what, Paxton,
fuck it. Come in.

558
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
All right, Paxton, here it is.
In addition to milk,

559
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
-What?
-I was trying to hide

560
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
but since we're no longer
together, it doesn't really

561
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You are smoking?

562
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Yes. I plan to carry on
just until this thing is over.

563
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's magnificent, actually.

564
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And when did you
start smoking again?

565
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Just before Christmas.

566
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Why?

567
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I started smoking again
when I went to Paris.

568
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
-You went to Paris?
-Yes, I went to Paris.

569
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I didn't tell you
I went to Paris.

570
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Michael Essien invited me
to Paris and I went.

571
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Okay, my therapist

572
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
identifies these moments
as confession avalanche.

573
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Who the fuck
is Michael Essien?

574
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
He is the founder
of Miracore,

575
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
seventh wealthiest man
in Germany.

576
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
-And you went
to Paris with him?

577
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
He invited the CEOs
from six countries

578
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
to come to Paris for his
60th birthday celebration.

579
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Do you mind
if I light this thing?

580
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And, you know what?
Actually, it's my choice.

581
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
When I got to the hotel,
there was this

582
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and I met six other CEOs
just like me,

583
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
only I had just
become a CEO,

584
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
so I didn't realize exactly
who I was until I saw

585
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and then I was like,
"Oh, so that's who

586
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And we sat around this table,
drinking champagne,

587
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
and the conversation was
lots of little voices

588
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and one big voice
saying "good,"

589
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And then the big voice said,
"Emerging markets" and I...

590
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You know how sometimes
when people say something

591
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Well, we did smoke
a lot of weed

592
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
When he said
"Emerging markets,"

593
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
thing, this shape appearing
from under the table

594
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I think I actually did
have a temperature that night.

595
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
then he said "Cigarettes
and pharmaceuticals,"

596
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and I drank some champagne
and someone

597
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
that is people who persuade
governments that products

598
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And the big voice said
that facilitators were now

599
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and I saw this big chain
dripping seaweed

600
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and then the big voice
raised a toast to corruption,

601
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and everybody laughed
ironically, including me.

602
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Paxton, look at me!

603
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And this thing, this shape,
it was swimming around

604
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and then the big voice said,
emerging market

605
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
were now some big percentage
of Miracore's profits,

606
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and so there would have to be
rationalization in Europe.

607
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And I drank some water,
because I felt a little sick,

608
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
but also like I might pass out,
but then the waiter said

609
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And, so, the rationalization
was planned right there

610
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
at that table in Paris
before Christmas.

611
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And the nice people
that I fired earlier today,

612
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
they weren't fired because
of a virus, like I told them,

613
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
that was a lie. They were fired
because of this...

614
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
this thing, this shape,

615
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
that swam with me
all the way back to my room,

616
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
and to get rid of it, I used
the disgusting glass swan

617
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and rather then
walk across broken

618
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I decided to take
the last train home

619
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and when I got
to the Gare du Nord station,

620
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
a homeless woman came up to me
and asked me for a cigarette.

621
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I told her that I didn't smoke,
but I decided to buy her

622
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
because I thought that maybe
kindness might make me

623
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
about what I had become.
And when she lit

624
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I decided
to have a cigarette, too.

625
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And when I drew in
the smoke,

626
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
the thing stopped swimming.

627
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So I sat down on the bench
and I waited for my train.

628
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And that is why
I started to smoke again.

629
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But... to complete the answer
to your original question,

630
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
in addition to milk
and cigarettes, we need bread

631
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and fucking wine.

632
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
God!

633
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
God what?

634
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, it sounds like
you did have a temperature.

635
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You know, they say this thing
was around before Christmas.

636
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Paxton, no!
It's not about the virus.

637
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's about me realizing
who I am and what I do

638
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Although a complete
re-examination of one's life

639
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
does seem to be
a COVID side effect.

640
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
-You smashed a mirror?
-Yeah.

641
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, because I was in it.

642
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I also smashed
a champagne bottle,

643
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
some champagne glasses,
and I was about to smash

644
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
but then
I decided to keep it,

645
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
but then I left it
on the fucking train.

646
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Basically, I went, what you
used to call, "Full Viking."

647
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
In fact,
when I broke the mirror

648
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and I saw my furious face
in the cracked glass,

649
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
-I thought of you.
- That's very sweet.

650
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Why didn't you tell me?

651
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It was the onset of winter.
Our winter.

652
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And anyway,
I didn't tell anybody,

653
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
because if you
don't tell anybody,

654
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
-Did you get a bill
for the mirror?

655
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Paxton, fuck the mirror.
It's not about the mirror,

656
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Previously, at this point,

657
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
-I would've hugged you.
-No, really,

658
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And anyway, besides,
you're going shopping.

659
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So, uh, milk, bread,
wine, cigarettes.

660
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
-And probably eggs.
-I'm gonna put white flour

661
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm gonna make bread.

662
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
-Please don't.
-You know...

663
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
what you just said
wasn't a confession.

664
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I didn't say
it was a confession.

665
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
'Cause you didn't do
anything wrong.

666
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
No, it was an explanation.

667
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You did everything right.

668
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You wanna hear a confession?

669
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
This morning I overslept,
because last night

670
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yes!

671
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Yes.

672
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Much worse
than your cigarettes.

673
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I licked opium off little
green bulbs from the garden.

674
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

675
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Our garden
is full of heroin.

676
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You go beyond the washing line,
it's like the Helmand Province.

677
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
After ten years, Paxton?

678
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Smoking isn't
so great either.

679
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You know, I've had
some setbacks lately.

680
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, well,
you know what, Paxton?

681
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You know that green smoothie
that I have in the mornings

682
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
there's two shots
of vodka in it.

683
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
-Just two but--
-You are lying.

684
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
No, I'm not.

685
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Not every morning,
but some mornings I do it.

686
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You think I'm so happy
and normal is 'cause

687
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
People get confused.

688
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
No, I've never accused you
of being happy

689
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
'Cause I'm not! All right?
I see concepts.

690
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I should've been an artist.

691
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You are unhappy
in an outwardly "happy,

692
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
let's pretend it's all fine"
female way,

693
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
and I am unhappy
in an obviously thwarted,

694
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
-unfulfilled, castrated
male way.

695
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Do not go down
this road again, okay?

696
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Just go to the store.
Milk, bread, wine,

697
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah, and fuck you,
I'm buying flour.

698
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Fine! Wait.
Do you have a mask?

699
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
No, I don't
have a mask, no.

700
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Well, you'll have to tie
something around

701
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Fuck!

702
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
My old bandana.

703
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Hmm. Yeah, well,
it's no longer

704
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's now government advice.

705
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You were wearing that
when I met you in Sturgis,

706
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I thought you looked
like a desperado.

707
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
No, I was just trying
to get the dust

708
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Don't spoil it.

709
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Don't forget the milk
and the eggs, Desperado.

710
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Oi! Move forward.

711
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Oi!

712
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Go ahead then.

713
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Fuck off.

714
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Oi. How many asses
have you got?

715
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Fuck off!

716
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Paxton.

717
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Hearing the story about Paris
out loud, it made me think...

718
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
When lockdown's over,
I'm going to think about

719
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Why are you telling me?

720
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You called?

721
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh, Lord who art in heaven,
I beseech you,

722
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
look favorably upon
Paxton and myself

723
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and forgive us
the sin of deception

724
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
which we are jointly
about to commit

725
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
in pursuit of his ultimate
redemption. Amen.

726
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Amen.

727
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Every prayer is tailored
to suit the person

728
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Either it's me writing
the words or it's Jesus.

729
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
What do you want, Malcolm?

730
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I've got your fake ID sorted.

731
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Virginia is delivering
the ID card.

732
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I wanted to make sure
you'd be in.

733
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You know what, Malcolm?
Everybody's in.

734
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And I've sent you
your new name.

735
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I texted it to you.
It's on your phone.

736
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Okay.

737
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
A new name for the beginning
of a new life.

738
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And my new name is...

739
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Edgar Allen Poe.

740
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Yeah.

741
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, uh...

742
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah. Malcolm, I obviously
can't use this name.

743
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Why not?

744
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm hoping this is a joke,

745
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
but I know you,
so it's probably not.

746
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
What joke?

747
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Okay.

748
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Edgar Allan Poe is the name
of a famous,

749
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
like a...

750
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
like a very famous
American novelist and poet.

751
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Never heard of him.

752
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Well, I assure you,

753
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Edgar Allan Poe is actually
a very famous

754
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
American writer
who I'm actually

755
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It was me that came up
with Edgar.

756
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's my grandad's name.

757
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So who came up
with the "Allen Poe" part?

758
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Martin in dispatch.

759
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Fuck.

760
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Martin in dispatch
hates me.

761
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
He's deliberately
suggested this

762
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
and unbearable.

763
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Well, the card's
already been laminated.

764
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Malcolm, I can't go into
expensive department stores

765
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
in the West End, right,

766
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and expect them
to entrust me

767
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
with valuable clothing
and jewelry,

768
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and tell them that my name
is Edgar Allen fucking Poe!

769
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
If he's so famous,
how come I've never

770
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
'Cause you don't
read books!

771
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I read the Good Book.

772
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But he's not
in the Bible, obviously.

773
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Anybody here ever heard
of a writer

774
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
called Edgar Allan Poe?

775
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
No?

776
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
No one. There you go.

777
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I know there's
no one there.

778
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
They are all
working from home.

779
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Martin's here.

780
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This was his idea!

781
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Well, the card's
already been laminated.

782
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
All right, look, I grant you
that 90%

783
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
of the security guards
working the night shift

784
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
in the West End
would not have heard

785
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
of Edgar Allan Poe.

786
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Basically dealing with robots.

787
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But I am an unlucky person.

788
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Fate has a way
of doing these little

789
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Card's already laminated

790
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and Martin has
a new name badge

791
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's all in the envelope.

792
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
By some chance,

793
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
choosing the name
of a gloomy,

794
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
introspective peddler
of darkness is actually

795
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
to my character,
but please...

796
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
just give me a new card
under a different name.

797
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
The robots don't give
a fuck about the name,

798
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
they just look
at the photo.

799
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You are due at Selfridges'
loading bay B

800
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
at 1800 hours tonight.

801
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Wear your uniform
with your name tag.

802
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Flash your ID.

803
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Look, if you want
to back out,

804
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I can't get into
trouble again, all right?

805
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
This could be construed
as deception

806
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
and attempted robbery.

807
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You counted me down,

808
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'll count you down,
you fucker.

809
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Five, four, three, two...

810
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Fuck! All right, all right.
I'll do it.

811
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Good.

812
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Details are on the text.
God bless you, Paxton.

813
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
No need to sign.
I know him.

814
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Are you his other half?

815
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Yes, yes, I am.

816
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
He's so dry,
isn't he?

817
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Hello, Paxton.

818
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I was just saying
you're very funny.

819
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Yes, I am.
I am hilarious.

820
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
We think
he's too clever

821
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
We don't know why
he doesn't get

822
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Well, that's easy.

823
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It's 'cause ten years ago,
I beat a man senseless

824
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
in a bikers' roadhouse
in Watford.

825
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
See?

826
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
He's always saying
silly things.

827
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
He's so dry.

828
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Give my regards
to Martin,

829
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Mmm-hmm.
-Tell him

830
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Okay.

831
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
See you when
the madness is over.

832
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yeah, well, for some of us,
the madness never ends.

833
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Never forget,
the man you beat senseless

834
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Please don't talk about
people deserving things.

835
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
If it wasn't for you,
a little man called

836
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
What you want,
justice next?

837
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I know that you had
a bad break,

838
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
-but going forward--
-"Going forward"?

839
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
When lockdown is over
and we are apart,

840
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
you have to stop believing
that fate is against you.

841
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
You have to stop believing
the name Paxton

842
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
is a precursor of doom.

843
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Yes, well,
my name isn't Paxton.

844
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah.

845
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Paxton, you can't
go through with this,

846
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
If you're doing it for cash,
I'll give you the cash.

847
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I am not doing it
for the cash.

848
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I'm doing it
for the opportunity

849
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
But why am I telling you?

850
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Fuck.

851
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Paxton.

852
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Oh!

853
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Oh.

854
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Fuck 'em.

855
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And Linda seemed
kind of detached

856
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Hey.

857
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Detached?

858
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Hi, Linda.

859
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
We were talking about you.

860
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
We were all just saying

861
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
that we love that
you're always so professional.

862
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Detached from what
whole thing?

863
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I was saying
you handled the situation

864
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
with Events without too much
feeling getting in the way.

865
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You fired them well.

866
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I did. Thank you.

867
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Good.

868
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Linda, is that
a glass of wine?

869
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Oh, yes, yeah, it is.

870
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Well...

871
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
it says wine on the label

872
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
but it tastes like something
used to clean something

873
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Paxton chose it.

874
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Who's Paxton?

875
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Mmm, anyway...

876
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
we have a problem,
so shall we get on?

877
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Hello, Martin.

878
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Hello, Edgar.

879
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
You know,
from my observation of you

880
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
since I joined the company,

881
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
you represent the longest
and most well-managed

882
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
nervous breakdown
in history.

883
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Why don't you go
somewhere warm

884
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I've disinfected the van
for you.

885
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Everything you need
is in there.

886
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You know, when Malcolm
told me he was giving you

887
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I advised him against it.

888
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
B2B normally keep
lowlifes like you

889
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
away from high-value cargo
for a reason...

890
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Temptation.

891
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You forgot to put the keys
to the van inside the envelope,

892
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I've read your
human resources profile.

893
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
My personal record is meant
to be confidential,

894
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
but for your
personal record, Martin,

895
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I'm a different person now.
Give me the fucking keys.

896
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Perhaps Malcolm
didn't tell you.

897
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
The estimated value
of tonight's cargo

898
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
out of Selfridges
is 50,000.

899
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
The value of your collection
from Harvey Nichols on Friday

900
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
is just under G100,000.

901
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But on Saturday night,

902
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
when you go to Harrods,

903
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
you'll be driving away
from the world's most glamorous

904
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
with jewelry and accessories
in your van

905
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
worth over
three million pounds.

906
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Now think on this.

907
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You'll be wearing
a mask and gloves,

908
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
you'll be using
a false identity.

909
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Outside, the streets
will be empty.

910
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Store security
on quarter staff

911
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
with big holes
caused by absences.

912
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
What more could
a lowlife need

913
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
to pull off
the perfect robbery.

914
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You refer to me as "lowlife"
one more time...

915
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You'll what?
Revert to type.

916
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Okay, here goes,
one more time.

917
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Lowlife.

918
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You know, Malcolm told me
that if you do okay

919
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
he's gonna put you
in customer services.

920
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Goin' out
and meeting clients.

921
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
'Cause you're so funny

922
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and you're so dry
and you make

923
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Whereas I've been stuck
in dispatches

924
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
for seven and a half years.

925
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You have to stop thinking
the whole world's

926
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Do it, Paxton.

927
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Take the opportunity
that fate has given you.

928
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Exactly how much product
do Eve Schwarz

929
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Uh, approximately
three million pounds'

930
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Harrods wants everything
out of the store

931
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
and it's
our responsibility...

932
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Oh, you've frozen, Linda.

933
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Can you hear me?

934
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah, I can hear you,
just your face is frozen.

935
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You've got this look
of exasperation.

936
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Uh, someone's gonna
have to go into Harrods

937
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
and check the inventory
and count everything out.

938
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And it's gonna have
to be someone that we trust.

939
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Someone who is familiar
with the stock,

940
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
and knows how
the Harrods system works.

941
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So that means, inevitably,
it's going to be me, isn't it?

942
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Okay, but there's this,
another second reason

943
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Michael Essien has decided.
He wants to give you

944
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
He wants to bring you home.

945
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Back to New York
to run the East Coast.

946
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Uh...

947
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Wow, God. Um...

948
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Exciting.

949
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
A unexpected
turn of events

950
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and cheap wine
don't pair well together.

951
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Um, I'm gonna have to, uh,
really think about this.

952
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Uh, right, good night.

953
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Yeah, thank you.

954
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Linda, it's exciting--
-

955
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
A frozen look
of exasperation.

956
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
...and that is his second son,

957
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
and here's his  Symphony No. 4.

958
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's just that after
our call last night,

959
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
we became worried about
Paxton's state of mind.

960
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
We worry that
he might implode or explode.

961
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Knowing Paxton,
he'll probably implode

962
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
What's the difference?

963
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
When you implode,
you withdraw

964
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
when you explode,
you impose yourself

965
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
David, for example,
when he gets angry,

966
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
When I get angry,
I explode.

967
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
-I can also explode
if I have to.

968
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
You've obviously
never seen me

969
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Well, actually I have.
Since lockdown.

970
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
You've heard me
through the wall,

971
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Okay, then,
I haven't heard you explode.

972
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I've actually been
very surprised

973
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
about how submissive you are
in meetings.

974
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
-Submissive?
-You're the boss, David,

975
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
-Anyway, just to reassure you,
Paxton's okay.

976
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
In fact, Paxton maybe
getting a promotion.

977
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Linda, are you
drinking alone?

978
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
No, I've got three firemen
waiting for me in the kitchen.

979
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Since lockdown, David has
been drinking so much more.

980
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Yes, David,
isn't it wonderful?

981
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
We now keep a record.
We count the bottles.

982
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
-I don't care.
-Your body cares.

983
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Your body counts the bottles
and keeps an inventory

984
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
David, my fellow drinker,
I'd like to tell you

985
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
-What secret?
-You know, Linda,

986
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
there have been
many occasions

987
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
where I've had
a few glasses of wine

988
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I woke up like,
"Golly. Wow.

989
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh, I've done that
so many times, too.

990
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You know, my mantra is,
secrets and wine

991
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
-don't go great together.
-Let her tell me the secret.

992
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I think he's gonna
like this secret.

993
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I think you're gonna
like this secret, David,

994
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Something he's gonna like,
you don't know.

995
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
-No, he might not.
-What the fuck are you two

996
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The secret is this.
-He might not be in a place

997
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
where it's okay.
He watches Fox.

998
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It is I who am buying
Paxton's motorbike.

999
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
What?

1000
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
When he said he was
selling it,

1001
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I arranged a dealer
to buy it anonymously.

1002
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I'm gonna buy it
and give it back to him.

1003
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
My parting gift.

1004
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
For a while I've known
I had to leave him.

1005
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
But...

1006
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
But losing the bike, yeah,
that's too much.

1007
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And the bike means
something to me, too.

1008
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
You know, youth.

1009
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Cigarettes. Bad, bad wine
chosen by Paxton.

1010
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Wow, that's--
-Linda, that's awesome.

1011
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
But here's the thing, David.
I want you to tell him

1012
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
that it's you
who is buying the bike

1013
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and giving it back to him.
I don't want him to know

1014
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Why?

1015
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It'll hurt him less.

1016
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
He really
is quite prehistoric.

1017
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm a bit drunk
and I hate people

1018
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
who get emotional
on these things, so...

1019
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Fuck.

1020
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Making noise
for the NHS.

1021
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
We've got Beethoven's

1022
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Whoo!
-

1023
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Whoo!

1024
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Hey.

1025
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Couldn't sleep.

1026
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
If the wine didn't work,
go and lick the garden.

1027
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
How was it tonight?

1028
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Every security person I met
was under the age of 12,

1029
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
and every one of them
was too busy

1030
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
to fully acknowledge my ID.

1031
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Anyway, I think
for the young generation,

1032
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I could have had an ID card
with William Shakespeare

1033
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
How many more
pick-ups do you have?

1034
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Um, tomorrow,
Harvey Nichols

1035
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
and then,
Saturday, Harrods.

1036
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Harrods?
Saturday night?

1037
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's all gone mad
out there.

1038
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
One of the security guards
was telling me about

1039
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
are taking out diamond rings
and watches in plastic bags

1040
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
and getting into Ubers.

1041
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
What are you
taking out of Harrods?

1042
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I don't know.

1043
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Martin says
it's over three million

1044
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
No co-drivers
'cause of COVID.

1045
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Carrying it to where?

1046
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Uh, the docket says Heathrow.
Ten o'clock flight

1047
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Harrods to Heathrow,
Saturday night,

1048
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
three million pounds,
ten o'clock flight.

1049
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Look, there's the hedgehog.

1050
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Oh, no, he's gone.

1051
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Ah, he's gone.

1052
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
How was your evening?

1053
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Okay, um, Paxton.
Here it is.

1054
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
You can't
do that pick-up

1055
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
You really can't.

1056
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
What are you talking about?

1057
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Okay, do you remember
once I asked you,

1058
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
do you believe in God,
and you said that

1059
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
you believe that he's busy
on another project,

1060
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
but occasionally
he puts his head

1061
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Well, I think this may be
one of those occasions,

1062
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
'cause God or fate or the virus
or somebody put our paths

1063
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
On Saturday, I will be
in Harrods packing up

1064
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
that you are due to carry.

1065
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Fuck.

1066
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
What are you
talkin' about? I...

1067
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I have to do the pick-up.

1068
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
If you do,
you will be caught.

1069
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It doesn't matter
what name you're using.

1070
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
It's a fake name
and I have implemented

1071
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
You won't make it
past the door.

1072
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I know,
because it's my system

1073
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I'm sorry. And what the fuck,
don't even begin.

1074
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I can't fucking
get anywhere!

1075
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I mean...

1076
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Can't you just tell them
that you know me?

1077
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
That...

1078
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
That you know
I can be trusted.

1079
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
That I was your partner.

1080
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
-What?
-It doesn't work like that.

1081
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And I...

1082
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Since joining Miracore
three years ago,

1083
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I haven't told anyone
I have a partner.

1084
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Partly because I wanted
to keep work separate.

1085
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah, but mostly because
you were embarrassed

1086
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
to have a partner
that drives a van.

1087
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yes. All of the above.
I...

1088
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
But now,
I am looking at myself.

1089
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Since lockdown,
I'm looking back at myself

1090
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
like that was then
and this is now.

1091
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Well, good for you, Linda,

1092
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
but if I don't
make this collection

1093
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
then, not only will Malcolm
not promote me,

1094
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
he will fire me.

1095
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I could always
start dealing heroin.

1096
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Lowlife is lowlife.

1097
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
No job. No bike.

1098
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
No you.

1099
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
When I worked at Harrods,
I had so much fun.

1100
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I knew everyone.
Everyone knew me.

1101
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Most of them
still work there--

1102
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Is there any possibility
we might get back to me

1103
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I mean, I'm the one
whose life is fucked.

1104
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
No, no, this is about you.

1105
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
All right, I know
all the security guards,

1106
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
-I know the security systems.
-So?

1107
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
So there is a way for you
to make your pick-up

1108
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and deliver to Heathrow
without getting caught.

1109
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You will get your promotion
and I will get

1110
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
and no one will know.

1111
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But we will be
breaking the law.

1112
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So you're gonna have to do
absolutely everything

1113
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Michael Morgan.
Acting Deputy Head,

1114
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yes, you are
in my old department.

1115
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
How's life at Harrods?

1116
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I only just joined.
I used to be

1117
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Oh, quite a change then.

1118
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Not really. No, Harrods
is like a big ship.

1119
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Oh. Okay.

1120
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I mean, there are,
obviously, huge differences.

1121
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Of course.

1122
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah, and not just in terms
of the shape of the building

1123
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
or the fact that
it doesn't float.

1124
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
-You know, it's...
-Oh, yeah.

1125
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yeah, the working environment
must be very different,

1126
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Yes, it is.
Lot of women here.

1127
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
-Yeah.
-Yes.

1128
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Yeah, on the ship,
there was only four.

1129
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And, uh, two of them
were called Karen.

1130
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Called them Karen one
and Karen two.

1131
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I think Kate's
meant to be joining us?

1132
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
-Kate Smith,
yes, from Events.

1133
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
When I knew her,
she was Kate Wiley.

1134
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
She must have
gotten married.

1135
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah, she did get married,
yeah, but it all went

1136
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Oh, sorry to hear that.

1137
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
What happened?

1138
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I don't know.
They don't talk to me

1139
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
-Linda!

1140
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Katie!

1141
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Oh my God,
Oh, my God. How are you?

1142
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Oh, my gosh. You know,
I'm surviving.

1143
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Linda, you have gone off
like a rocket!

1144
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
-Oh, stop.
-I mean, my God.

1145
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
When they said
CEO Miracore,

1146
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I thought, "Okay, God,
some bald man,"

1147
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
-but then I saw your name.
-

1148
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Linda was just asking
what went wrong

1149
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
-  was just askin'.
-No. No, no, no.

1150
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
When a man is shorter
than you

1151
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
and then suddenly decides

1152
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
to let his beard grow
very, very long

1153
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
and then becomes obsessed
with so called "white magic,"

1154
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
it can just get very creepy
very quickly.

1155
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
-Anyway, what can we

1156
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I have an update about
the Eve Schwarz clear-out

1157
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
You see, all the secure
freight companies

1158
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
and it looks like
our logistics department

1159
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Eve Schwarz, Miracore.
Here it is.

1160
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
They've booked
a freight company that

1161
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
so that's why I'm anxious.

1162
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Lime green is the color
and, uh...

1163
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So you're anxious
about the freight company?

1164
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It's gonna be
green arrows pointing--

1165
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So if it's okay with you,

1166
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I know the Harrods
security system

1167
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
and I'd like
to run the checks

1168
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh, no, no,
that's Imran's job.

1169
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Do you remember Imran, Linda?

1170
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I love Imran...

1171
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Imran is now head
of Events security.

1172
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
He's Michael's boss.

1173
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
You got any questions.
I can handle everything.

1174
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Let me text him now.

1175
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Don't, I'm gonna be the one
with the arrows. So...

1176
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Okay. Done.

1177
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Tomorrow, I'll run you
through the system myself

1178
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and then get you
into the store.

1179
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
After that,
what can go wrong?

1180
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Hey, great. Thanks.

1181
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

1182
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
-What's the matter?
-I don't know.

1183
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Days are passing quickly.

1184
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
When I woke up this morning,

1185
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
it really hit me
for the first time.

1186
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
The reality of what's
happening hit me.

1187
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
The lockdown
will eventually end.

1188
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Then...

1189
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
the love of my life
will be gone.

1190
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Paxton, you will move on
from this. You will heal.

1191
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
There'll be a huge hole
in my life.

1192
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
You'll change and grow.
And...

1193
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Eventually you'll...

1194
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
you'll meet someone else.

1195
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
You were talking about
the bike, weren't you?

1196
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Yeah. Why?

1197
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The bike is one
of the loves of my life.

1198
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And I am one of the holes?

1199
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Obviously you're
the biggest hole.

1200
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Oh, why, thank you.

1201
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I was gonna take
the bike out today.

1202
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
The streets
are completely deserted.

1203
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I was gonna call it
"Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1204
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I thought maybe...

1205
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Oh, no, I can't
go with you, Paxton.

1206
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
No. I have
an important meeting.

1207
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
An open road
and a broken heart.

1208
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Don't kill yourself.

1209
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
-Linda!
-Michael.

1210
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
How are you coping?

1211
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
You know, it's been
quite difficult.

1212
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I can imagine.
-Mmm.

1213
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
-You know, I'm locked up

1214
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
with only eagles and bears
and my family for company.

1215
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Please don't kill yourself.

1216
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
What?

1217
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I said it must be nice
to have time to yourself.

1218
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Anyway, before we get on
to the exciting

1219
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
and your big decision
to come home to New York,

1220
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
the good news is that
we have found a buyer

1221
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Uh, actually,
I haven't decided to

1222
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
The buyer saw the diamond
on the virtual presentation

1223
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
that you put together
ahead of the store takeover.

1224
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That's great. Who is it?

1225
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
In our new world, Linda,

1226
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
one does not ask who.
He's anonymous.

1227
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
But I can tell you this.
He's, um...

1228
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
A very unpleasant member
of a very unpleasant family

1229
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
who run a very
unpleasant country

1230
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Oh.

1231
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
He is facilitating Miracore
in his country

1232
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
and so I've brokered
the purchase of the diamond

1233
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Harrods themselves
will have nothing

1234
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
so I have acted
as go-between.

1235
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Hurray for us, no?

1236
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Yes, hurray for us.

1237
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Uh, will he be wanting
to pick up the diamond

1238
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
He is not allowed
into the UK.

1239
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Money laundering?
Human rights abuses?

1240
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Anyway,
the big question, Linda,

1241
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
the issue at hand here
is the future of Linda.

1242
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
When will you
be coming home?

1243
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Um...

1244
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Well, I've decided
to leave my decision

1245
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
until after lockdown
is lifted.

1246
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
-Okay.
-I have lots of ties

1247
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Uh-huh. I was told
that you're single.

1248
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Actually,
that was never true,

1249
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
The fact that you are single
is one of the reasons I want

1250
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I'm planning to get to know
more about you.

1251
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
You...

1252
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
You fascinate me, Linda.

1253
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So tough on the outside,

1254
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
but inside,

1255
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
are you tough?

1256
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Do you remember
when you came to Paris?

1257
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That evening,
after the meeting,

1258
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I was going to take you
out to dinner.

1259
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I was actually going to try
to seduce you that night.

1260
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Well, I can only speculate
what kind of evening

1261
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But I suspect it would have
involved broken glass.

1262
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Anyway, uh, should I
send the diamond

1263
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
to this probable
mass murderer's home

1264
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
or should I send it straight
to his torture chamber?

1265
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
What?

1266
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Where would you like me
to send the diamond?

1267
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Ah, send it to New York.

1268
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Um, because of COVID,
it will be

1269
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
to a safe vault
in Wall Street.

1270
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
There'll be no one
to check it there,

1271
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
so please make sure
that the verification papers

1272
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Got that?

1273
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
-Um--
-For many of our

1274
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
the act of acquisition
is an end in itself.

1275
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Okay. See you
in New York, Linda.

1276
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Well, I...

1277
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
To mention

1278
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
On looking flash

1279
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
your attention

1280
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And your record collection

1281
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
You'll qualify

1282
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Old age pension

1283
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Your money or your life

1284
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
No bullet or a knife

1285
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Don't be ridiculous, Linda.

1286
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
A shortage of medical masks,

1287
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
people are making their own
from old clothing.

1288
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
But the WHO said
it doesn't know

1289
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Hey.

1290
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
-Where'd you go?
-

1291
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Peckham Rye.

1292
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
-Why?
-I don't know.

1293
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
What do you mean,
you don't know?

1294
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I was just driving
really, really fast,

1295
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
because I was being chased
by the police.

1296
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
-What?
-I was playing

1297
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Green for stop,
red for go.

1298
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Fuck!

1299
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Did they get
your license number?

1300
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
No, I'm too fast for 'em.

1301
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'm a streak of light
on an empty road

1302
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I'm the last man alive.

1303
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I let the road direct me
and I achieved that

1304
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
where the bike becomes
part of your body.

1305
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I found myself in South London
on some sort of urban farm

1306
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
and I hid among the goats.

1307
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Remember the goat
was my totem animal

1308
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I sat with the goats
and then resumed my journey

1309
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I was in Peckham.

1310
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I bought you cigarettes.

1311
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And I had one myself.

1312
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
My first real, real one
in ten years.

1313
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And you were right,
tobacco tastes like youth!

1314
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And real is real,
and real tobacco

1315
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and I want another one
right now

1316
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
and I'm gonna have one.

1317
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
You have a look in your eyes
I haven't seen in a long time.

1318
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I don't mean
to frighten you.

1319
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I'm not frightened.

1320
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Remember I told you
about the glass horse

1321
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
No, I'm still
with the goats.

1322
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I held the horse and jockey
by the jockey

1323
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
and swung it around and...

1324
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And I remembered how it felt
to be a rider

1325
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
and to feel like
you're a part of the thing

1326
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's a sexual feeling.

1327
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Yeah, it is.

1328
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I now wish
I'd come with you.

1329
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Really?

1330
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Paxton,

1331
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
for a long time,
I've known that

1332
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And for a long time,
the only unbroken thread

1333
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Go on.

1334
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I'm finding this moment
difficult because...

1335
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I made a vow
this wouldn't happen,

1336
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
so could you just
take the leather jacket off

1337
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
and go hold a tea towel
or something?

1338
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
-Hold a tea towel?
-Or buy some milk,

1339
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
-We have milk.
-Or bake bread. That would

1340
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I just want to get
on my bike and ride

1341
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
and fuck the world.

1342
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Okay, Paxton,
here it is.

1343
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Probably as a result
of lockdown,

1344
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
you have a mad urge
to ride your motorbike

1345
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And as of two hours ago,
I have a mad urge

1346
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
to steal a diamond
worth three million pounds

1347
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
from a mass murderer

1348
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
and quit my job
and become an artist.

1349
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
What?

1350
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But I think
the most practical thing

1351
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
we can do to get this
madness out of our system

1352
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
is that I break my vow
and we go upstairs

1353
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and have sex.

1354
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
"Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1355
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Goats, now this.

1356
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
What a fucking day.

1357
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Hi. Yeah, she's, uh,
she's just changing.

1358
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Oh, by the way,

1359
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
you ever heard of a poet
called Edgar Allan Poe?

1360
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
-What?
-Yeah, never mind.

1361
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
All right. One second.

1362
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You're listening to

1363
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And this is
George Frideric Handel.

1364
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Please hang up or press

1365
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Uh, Linda, I'm just calling
to say that

1366
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I know this afternoon
didn't mean anything,

1367
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
but I want you to know
that it would have

1368
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
like South Dakota

1369
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
that afternoon
when it rained.

1370
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And also, I have
this bizarre memory

1371
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
that just before we strayed
from the path

1372
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
you said something
about stealing a diamond.

1373
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
...you said something

1374
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Did I imagine that?

1375
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Oh, God!
-

1376
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Thank you.

1377
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
No, Grandma, I am not
seriously considering it.

1378
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Fuck.

1379
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
This is where the patients

1380
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
But now, it's needed for
COVID-19 overflow from

1381
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Hospitals are having
to adapt their spaces

1382
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
to be able to deal
with Coronavirus.

1383
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I've been a nurse in ICU

1384
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
-and I've never seen...
-

1385
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
All right.

1386
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Big Saturday. Harrods.

1387
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
The grand deception.

1388
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
You have to tell me
exactly what it is

1389
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Paxton...

1390
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Sit down. Wait there.

1391
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
This is just us organizing
what it is that

1392
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It's nothing else.

1393
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Why, what else
would it be?

1394
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Nothing. Why do you ask?

1395
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Are you okay?

1396
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Me? I am okay.
I am intensely okay

1397
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Okay. Background.

1398
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Harrods. The top part
is the public area.

1399
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
But below ground,
there are seven floors.

1400
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Floors where merchandise
is stored

1401
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
and lots of tunnels

1402
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
where expensive items
such as jewelry

1403
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
are transported
to secure elevators.

1404
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
All grown up
and glamorous above

1405
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
and efficient
and scary below.

1406
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Security at Harrods
is unbelievably tight,

1407
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
it would be impossible
to get inside

1408
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
to actually
steal something.

1409
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Steal?

1410
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Who's talking about
stealing anything?

1411
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Everything is normal.
Paxton, stop being weird.

1412
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's not me being weird.

1413
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I mean, you clearly appear
to have a hidden agenda,

1414
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
which is
not really that hidden,

1415
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Also, you've got
a smudge above your eye.

1416
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Did you get my message
on your phone last night?

1417
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
About South Dakota?

1418
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And about a diamond.

1419
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Paxton, what is
the matter with you?

1420
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
-There's nothing
the matter with me.

1421
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Yesterday, you were talking
about stealing a diamond.

1422
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
You were,
I'm not imagining it.

1423
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And today, you are drawing
Harrods like it's, uh,

1424
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
some kind of secret plan
in a secret heist movie.

1425
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
How can you draw
a rectangle like you're in

1426
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Do you have
a secret plan?

1427
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I saw my grandmother's
face yesterday.

1428
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I told her,
"It's okay, Grandma,

1429
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm not going to do
anything stupid."

1430
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
You said the diamond
is called a Harris Diamond.

1431
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Oh, Paxton, come on.

1432
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It's Saturday.
It's morning.

1433
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
All the weird 4:00 a.m.
fantasies and options have

1434
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Tell me about
the diamond.

1435
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
There are
two Harris Diamonds.

1436
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
-What?
-There are two

1437
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
-Why are there two?
-

1438
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Do you think I slept at all
last night, Paxton?

1439
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Well actually, no,
I didn't.

1440
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And what was it
that kept you awake?

1441
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Harris Diamond one,
Harris Diamond two.

1442
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
One is real,
the other is fake.

1443
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Whenever a diamond
of this value

1444
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
they use a replica
of the real thing

1445
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
to put
into the public area.

1446
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
The actual diamond
is kept safe

1447
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Currently, the replica

1448
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
is on display here
on the ground floor.

1449
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,000
But your real
Harris Diamond

1450
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Tonight,
at exactly 7:00 p.m.,

1451
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
you and I will be escorted
to the vaults by security

1452
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
to collect
the real Harris Diamond.

1453
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
We will then go
up the ground floor

1454
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
in a secure elevator
where we add the diamond

1455
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
to the rest
of the Eve Schwarz

1456
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Then, right there at 7:30 p.m.,
we will have the real diamond

1457
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
and the very good
replica diamond,

1458
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
next to each other,
almost indistinguishable.

1459
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
And because
of COVID restrictions,

1460
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
the only people
that will be there

1461
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
So, then we put
the real diamond

1462
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,000
and send it to New York,
and we take

1463
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
and I put it in my purse,
we take it away

1464
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and that is what we are going
to fucking do,

1465
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
exactly that
and nothing else.

1466
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
May I ask
a very obvious question?

1467
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
No, you may not.

1468
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
What would happen if we sent
the replica to New York

1469
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
and kept the real thing?

1470
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I'm assuming that as soon
as it got to New York,

1471
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
someone would realize
that it was fake.

1472
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
No, they wouldn't.

1473
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
That is why
I couldn't sleep.

1474
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Whichever one we send
to New York,

1475
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
it will go
into a secure vault

1476
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
and won't even be looked at
by another human being

1477
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
for 20, 50, 100 years.

1478
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Holy fuck.

1479
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Three million pounds,
tax free.

1480
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
No consequences.

1481
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
One for me, one for you,
one for the NHS.

1482
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
You have thought
about this.

1483
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You know,
I need to go meditate.

1484
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Are you sure they
won't check it in New York?

1485
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Shut up.
I need to meditate.

1486
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
What were you going to say?

1487
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
The man who bought
the diamond is bad.

1488
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
He's really bad,
and you and I are good.

1489
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
And the NHS is good.
And good is better

1490
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
When I explained
all that to Grandma,

1491
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
even she said,
"Well, yeah, that's true."

1492
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
And she was a Calvinist,
straight as a rod.

1493
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Unlike me, who is weak
in the face of temptation.

1494
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Live wild or die, Linda.

1495
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Paxton,
you're forgetting something

1496
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Assuming that
we do this thing,

1497
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
which we definitely won't,

1498
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
how would two ordinary people
like you and me

1499
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
find a way to sell
a three million pounds

1500
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Okay, that was it.
That was my last attempt

1501
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
to find a logical reason
why we shouldn't do this,

1502
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
but you are going to say
"Archie Bruce," aren't you?

1503
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Yes, I am.

1504
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Archie Bruce.

1505
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Over the years,
I've kept up

1506
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I mean, Archie Bruce,

1507
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
he's graduated
from stealing motorcycles

1508
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
to stealing vintage cars

1509
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
and fine art and jewelry.

1510
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I mean, he'd have Mr. Harris
in a penthouse in Moscow

1511
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
before the banging
of the next saucepans.

1512
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And he'd do
a preferential deal

1513
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
because you stepped in
one night and saved his life

1514
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
at a roadhouse in Watford.

1515
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Circle of life,
something like that.

1516
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
With Archie Bruce,
the nightmare began.

1517
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Maybe with Archie Bruce,
the nightmare ends.

1518
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
So, what are we
going to do, Linda?

1519
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Okay, Paxton, here it is.

1520
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
We decide tonight.

1521
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
When we're there at Harrods
with the diamonds,

1522
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
we're gonna know what's right
and what's wrong.

1523
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
We'll decide in the moment.

1524
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Or let the moment decide.

1525
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
What's the difference?

1526
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Fate versus free will.

1527
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Who controls our destiny?

1528
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Is everything
part of a plan

1529
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
or do we fuck things up
for ourselves?

1530
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Tonight at 7:30,
we find out.

1531
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Hey, half-brother.

1532
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
What, now?
You wanna Zoom?

1533
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
All right,
give me a minute.

1534
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Ah, Paxton,
how are you?

1535
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Actually, I am at a fork
in the road.

1536
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Really? Then perhaps
what I have to say

1537
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
will have some bearing
on which fork you take,

1538
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
because it is
sort of road related.

1539
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You see, Paxton,
the other day

1540
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
you want
to sell your motorcycle,

1541
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I thought, "Wait a minute.
Time out. Not so fast."

1542
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
And then,
after I cut the call

1543
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Mum?

1544
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
How she would feel
about you having to sell

1545
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
your most
precious possession,

1546
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
while at the same time,
over here

1547
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
in the beautiful
Hudson Valley,

1548
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
your brother,
your half-brother

1549
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
You know,
when the cherry trees

1550
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
it sucks,
but there are worse things.

1551
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Yeah, not for the cherry tree.

1552
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Maybe worse for a cherry tree

1553
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
is the steady tread
of George Washington

1554
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
as he approaches
with an axe in his hand

1555
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
and a head
full of good intentions.

1556
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Anyway, I wondered what Mom
would want me to do.

1557
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Well, remembering Mum,

1558
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I think she'd want you
to get to the point.

1559
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Okay, Paxton, here it is.

1560
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It is I who has bought
your precious motorcycle.

1561
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
The purchaser
of your bike is me.

1562
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
And I am
giving it back to you.

1563
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
My gesture,
half-brother to half-brother.

1564
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Your bike is yours
once more.

1565
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Don't thank me, Paxton.

1566
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Please. No need.

1567
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
All I ask, the only thing
I ask of you, Paxton,

1568
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
is that
you are kind to yourself

1569
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
That you learn from this.

1570
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
That the world
does not hate you.

1571
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
That, yes, sometimes fate
seems harsh and cruel,

1572
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
but people really do
what good--

1573
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Hey, David,
it's Linda. Hi!

1574
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Uh, Linda, I thought
I was just speaking

1575
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yes, I know. I heard, David,
your magnificent gesture,

1576
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
and I just...
I couldn't stop myself,

1577
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
I couldn't help myself.
I just had to jump

1578
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
and say,
"Oh, my God, David.

1579
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
What kind
of a person are you?"

1580
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
David bought
my fucking bike.

1581
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Yes, I heard. I heard,
and then I heard the sermon,

1582
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
and I thought, "Wow!

1583
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Not only is he so generous
with his cash,

1584
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
he is so free
with his wisdom."

1585
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Anyway, Paxton,
there it is--

1586
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Don't let me interrupt
this meaningful moment.

1587
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
What is it that
you were saying, David?

1588
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Something about fate
being harsh and...

1589
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
-...cruel?

1590
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Hmm.

1591
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Why were you mad at him?

1592
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I wasn't mad.
-Yes, you were.

1593
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
It was you.

1594
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Paxton, don't be ridiculous.
You heard what David said.

1595
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
David would never do
something like that,

1596
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
but he would
take the credit.

1597
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Whereas you would do
something like that

1598
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
and give the credit
to someone else.

1599
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
You did it 'cause you
felt sorry for me.

1600
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Yes, I worried
about what would happen

1601
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
if you lost everything.

1602
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Mainly because
I didn't want anything bad

1603
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Confession avalanche,
but also I...

1604
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I did it because
the bike represents us.

1605
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
-And--
-No, no, no.

1606
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Pity is over here, all right,
and love is way over here.

1607
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Don't pretend
there is a bridge.

1608
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
But would you still
feel pity for a man

1609
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
who'd just stolen
a million pounds?

1610
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I'd be a millionaire,

1611
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
and a  bandido  once again.

1612
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Maybe you'd change
your mind.

1613
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Maybe we'd ride off
into the sunset.

1614
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Paxton...

1615
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
whatever we decide
to do tonight,

1616
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
we will go
our separate ways.

1617
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
The money would mean
that we're both free.

1618
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Well, I will factor that

1619
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
into my decision-making
process.

1620
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Thanks for the bike.

1621
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Om...

1622
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Ladies and gentlemen...

1623
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
fellow inmates...

1624
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I have something for you

1625
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
before I head off
on the number 27 bus

1626
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
to meet my destiny.

1627
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's a passage
from a poem

1628
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
written by T.S. Eliot,

1629
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
who I'm sure no one
has ever heard of either.

1630
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
"She turns and looks a moment
in the glass,

1631
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
hardly aware
of her departed lover.

1632
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Her brain allows one
half-formed thought

1633
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Well, now that's done,
and I'm glad it's over."

1634
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
See you
in the moment, Linda.

1635
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
This could be
the last bus I ever take.

1636
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Oh, I've decided
to go by myself. Thanks.

1637
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
No problem.
-Thank you.

1638
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Do it, Paxton.
Take the opportunity

1639
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
-Hi, stranger.
- Oh, my God!

1640
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
-I want to hug you.

1641
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I can't hug you,
I can't hug you.

1642
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I hate this virus.

1643
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I'm blowing you kisses.

1644
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
-Oh, my God.
- Hello, stranger.

1645
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Hey, oh...
-

1646
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
This place died
when you left.

1647
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Oh, Charlotte,
I need to know the name

1648
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
of your personal trainer
right now, seriously.

1649
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I actually lost weight
because of stress,

1650
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
'cause I found out
my girlfriend

1651
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
was stealing a load of money
from me.

1652
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
What?
-Long story.

1653
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
-Hi!
-Hi.

1654
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Terry, yeah.
Terry, guess who's here?

1655
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yeah, have a little look
at Cam 14.

1656
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Oh, shit,
it's Linda.

1657
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
So, Linda,
what are you doing here?

1658
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Oh, I'm not
on the list, because I made

1659
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
a special arrangement
with Imran,

1660
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
so I just need a desk
for five minutes.

1661
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Or three minutes.
Charlotte, can I?

1662
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
-Come through.
- Okay. Oh!

1663
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I need to wait
for my, um, driver.

1664
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Oh, hang on.
Excuse me.

1665
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Hi.
B2B Pro Freight Services?

1666
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Yeah.

1667
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
For the Eve Schwarz
collection?

1668
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah?

1669
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Okay, just wait here
for one second. Okay.

1670
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
We couldn't get
our normal freight service.

1671
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
World's gone mad.

1672
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I'm going to have to run
a hundred checks

1673
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
We'll just need
to see his ID.

1674
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And Imran said we do need
to check the driver's ID.

1675
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Of course.

1676
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Yeah,
can I see your ID?

1677
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Thank you.

1678
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Oh, my God, Charlotte.

1679
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I didn't tell you.
You of all people.

1680
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
What?

1681
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It's just
the most earth-shattering,

1682
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
life-changing,
amazing news.

1683
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I found someone.
I met someone.

1684
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
-No.
-Yes.

1685
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Oh, my God.
I thought you were

1686
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
-Me, too!
-Dating app? Bumble?

1687
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
-What's he like?
- He's, uh...

1688
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
He's a poet.

1689
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
-Oh?
-Yeah.

1690
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Yeah, he's like
a really wild poet.

1691
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Oh, my God,
that's so romantic.

1692
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Hmm, I know.

1693
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
But listen, I've got a slot
in the vaults at 7:00.

1694
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
-I gotta get this guy
processed. Thank you.

1695
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
-Linda...
-Oh, life, life.

1696
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Right? You never know
what's coming down the line.

1697
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
-Mmm-hmm.
-Okay.

1698
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
We're good.

1699
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Thank you, Mark.

1700
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Anything for you, Linda.

1701
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Okay, I'm going
to generate you

1702
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
that will give you access
to all areas.

1703
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
-Date of birth.
- January 19th,

1704
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,000
But I didn't have
my first poem

1705
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Okay, that's good.
That's good.

1706
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
You're taking it lightly.
You're not panicking.

1707
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
January 19th, 1980.

1708
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Height, six feet.

1709
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
-Build--
-Medium athletic.

1710
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
And inside, I am panicking.

1711
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
You do realize
that we've both

1712
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
We haven't done
anything yet.

1713
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Criminal convictions, none.

1714
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
So, when does
the moment begin?

1715
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
-The moment when we decide.

1716
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
In the CCTV control room,

1717
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
there's a deaf man
who reads lips.

1718
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Shut up. Look here.

1719
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Why are you good at this?

1720
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Oh, Linda.

1721
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I just need to get
the gentleman's name

1722
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
in case of a fire, so...

1723
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
-His name?
- Mmm-hmm.

1724
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Edgar Allen Poe.

1725
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Uh, Edgar...

1726
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Edgar Allen Poe.

1727
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Great, thanks.

1728
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
This is the first time
Harrods has been closed

1729
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
in a hundred years.

1730
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Everything
has to get packed up

1731
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Pearls, purses,
fine art, fine jewelry.

1732
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Diamonds.

1733
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Yeah. Diamonds.

1734
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Remember that game
we used to play

1735
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
when we are alone
in an elevator,

1736
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
we ask
each other questions,

1737
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
and we are only allowed
to tell the absolute truth?

1738
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Shoot.

1739
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
What went wrong
with you and me?

1740
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
When I met you,
I wanted wild

1741
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And then,
I stopped wanting wild,

1742
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
-So, it should have worked.
-Yeah, but it didn't.

1743
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
-Why not?
-I don't know.

1744
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
That's the truth.

1745
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
-

1746
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
-Are you hungry?
-Yeah.

1747
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
We have an hour
until our slot

1748
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
so what do you want
to eat, Paxton?

1749
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
There is
literally everything.

1750
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
With the store closing,
Harrods is gonna give

1751
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
all of this food away
to a food bank.

1752
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Fine.

1753
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Is there anybody watching?

1754
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Maybe.

1755
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Dream bigger.

1756
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Finest beluga caviar?

1757
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
So is this the moment?

1758
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
No.

1759
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
No. We gotta get
something clear

1760
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
This is a black
Perigord truffle

1761
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It retails for G735.

1762
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
-For a fucking mushroom?
-Okay.

1763
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Okay, that is what we need
to get clear in our minds.

1764
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
What is the difference
between the cost of things,

1765
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
and the value of things
to you and me?

1766
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
So, I'm gonna
make a picnic.

1767
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
A picnic which
under normal circumstances

1768
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
would cost us about G5,000.

1769
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Door's closing.

1770
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
My precious grandma
was a racist.

1771
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

1772
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And I've just decided
to take her off

1773
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
my in-head jury of people

1774
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
who pass judgment
on what I do.

1775
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
So, who else
is on the jury?

1776
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
My dead mother,
God and you.

1777
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
How come I'm still there?

1778
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
-

1779
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Doors are open,
I don't have to tell you.

1780
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I used to come in here
on my lunch break.

1781
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
So which one
of those paintings

1782
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Uh,
I don't want to own one.

1783
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
You want to paint one.

1784
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I just want to paint.

1785
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
So, this is the moment.

1786
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Oh, wait.

1787
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
-Is the deaf guy looking?
-What?

1788
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Oh, I made that guy up
so you would stop talking.

1789
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Ah.

1790
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Think about it.

1791
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,000
G100,000 a year for ten years.
G50,000 a year for 20 years.

1792
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
-A million pounds.
- Yeah.

1793
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
You could paint.

1794
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
You wouldn't even need
to sell anything.

1795
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
-

1796
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I never learned
to ride a bicycle.

1797
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
-What?
-Yeah.

1798
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
-Never?
-Yeah.

1799
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Went straight
to the motorcycle.

1800
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Before Christmas,
I had a sexual encounter

1801
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
and it was great.

1802
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
-

1803
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Okay, so we've established
that we both want freedom.

1804
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
-Maria, really?
-Oh, Paxton.

1805
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Paxton, we are about to make
the most important decision

1806
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
of our lives.
Can you concentrate?

1807
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Okay, in our
decision-making process,

1808
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
we haven't yet
discussed morality.

1809
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Look at that. That is...

1810
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
That's a whole city
in lockdown.

1811
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Hospitals can't cope.
A million pounds would help.

1812
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
We'd be doing good.
Plus, I worked it out.

1813
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
If it's in 50s,
it all fits in one suitcase.

1814
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
You can
leave it on a doorstep.

1815
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
-You got rid of Grandma.
-Yes, I did. Thank you.

1816
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
So, okay, we do it.

1817
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Fuck it.

1818
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
We decide right now.

1819
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Okay.

1820
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Previously,
I would have kissed you.

1821
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Let's just see
what happens.

1822
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
-Okay.
-Fuck.

1823
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
-Maria?
-Okay, it's time to go.

1824
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
-Really?
-We gotta go to the vaults.

1825
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
So, are we gonna
do it or not?

1826
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
-Are you okay?

1827
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
God, no.

1828
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Is God really part
of your in-head jury?

1829
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Uh-huh.

1830
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
And for the record,
God is absolutely fine

1831
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
with whatever it is
that we decide to do.

1832
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
That's good to know.

1833
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Hi, there.
P.J., right?

1834
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Lead the way.

1835
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Why does the name
Edgar Allen Poe

1836
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
-

1837
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1838
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
You're shipping
that thing to New York?

1839
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
It's an underwater theme.

1840
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
-My idea.
-It's nice.

1841
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
You're very good
at what you do.

1842
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Okay, so we only need
to pack up

1843
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
the jewelry and accessories.

1844
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
The clothing
all goes downstairs,

1845
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
so it shouldn't
take too long.

1846
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Yeah, not too long,
so, uh...

1847
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Shall I take it out?

1848
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Yes. Why not?

1849
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Okay.

1850
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Do it quickly,
the fish are piranhas.

1851
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
-What?
-It's meant to be symbolic.

1852
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
-Symbolic of--
-I don't remember, okay.

1853
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Just do it faster.

1854
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
You'll be fine.

1855
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
So, this is the moment.

1856
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Just seems so easy.

1857
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
It's never been
about can we do it, Paxton.

1858
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
It's about...
should we do it?

1859
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
And will we do it?
It's about you and me.

1860
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
And I'm not saying
that we are going to do it,

1861
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
but if we are,
then you would need to

1862
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
So, shall I take the step?

1863
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Take the step.
Then, we decide.

1864
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Linda...

1865
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
if we are deciding
in the moment,

1866
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
then I say we do it.

1867
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
If we are letting
the moment decide,

1868
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
then, in my opinion,
the moment is saying

1869
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
"Put the replica
in the fucking box

1870
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
and put the real thing
in your bag."

1871
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Freedom, Linda,
in one beautiful moment.

1872
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Okay.

1873
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Okay.

1874
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
-It's under control.
-It's under control.

1875
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
-Under control.
- Yeah.

1876
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I think we should start
with the handbags,

1877
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
we should get

1878
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Linda!

1879
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
-Linda, it's me.
- Donald.

1880
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I need to speak to you
urgently.

1881
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Um, excuse me,
could you please

1882
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
or something for a moment?

1883
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I have
some very important things

1884
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Uh... Uh-huh.

1885
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Uh...

1886
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Donald...

1887
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Well, goodness,
I thought that I fired you,

1888
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
but you're here.

1889
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Linda, listen. Someone made
an anonymous call

1890
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
to Miracore head office.

1891
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
They said that the driver
from B2B

1892
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
who is carrying
the Eve Schwarz collection

1893
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
is using a false name.

1894
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
They said he's got
a criminal record.

1895
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Grandma, hey.

1896
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I came as soon as I could.
Thank God you're okay.

1897
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
-I'm okay.
-Well, the police

1898
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
-The police are coming and...
-They'll be here any minute.

1899
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
They'll be here any minute.
Okay, that's...

1900
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Now we're against
the clock.

1901
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Uh, if he's innocent
and who he says he is,

1902
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
-then everything will--
-Everything will be okay.

1903
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
And it will be okay, Donald,
because I know what to do.

1904
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
What do you mean?

1905
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
-What are you going to do?
-Paxton?

1906
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Paxton?

1907
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Donald. Paxton.

1908
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Paxton. Donald.

1909
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Who are you?

1910
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I'm Edgar Allen Poe,
obviously.

1911
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
-She just called you Paxton.
-Yes, Donald, this is Paxton.

1912
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And I'm a woman
called Linda Jarvis.

1913
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I'm an ordinary woman
who, 60 seconds ago,

1914
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
made an extraordinary
decision.

1915
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Linda,
what are you going

1916
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
What is it
to do with you?

1917
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
What it has to do
with him is that...

1918
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
he is my partner
and my lover

1919
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
and I think
I'm still in love with him.

1920
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
-Really?

1921
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
But most importantly,
he is also my accomplice.

1922
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
You see, Donald, just now...
just one minute ago,

1923
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I decided... We decided

1924
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
to steal the Harris Diamond
worth three million pounds.

1925
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Holy fuck.
Confession avalanche.

1926
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
No, it's okay,
and I know Donald

1927
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
and also we don't have
a choice,

1928
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
because Donald
called the police

1929
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
and they're about to arrive
at any second.

1930
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Oh, fuck!
-Like I said,

1931
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
it's going to be okay,
because when

1932
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
we are not
going to be here,

1933
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
-You are?
-Yes, we are.

1934
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
And Donald
is going to tell them

1935
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
that he talked to Linda

1936
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
and she said
that everything's fine,

1937
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
it was all
a misunderstanding.

1938
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And then, he is going
to give them this,

1939
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
your ID verification.

1940
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And you're going to say
that you recognize

1941
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
from another assignment.

1942
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And then, you're going
to tell them a story.

1943
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
You're going
to tell them a story

1944
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
about how this driver
has an enemy at work

1945
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
-I am?
-Yes, you are.

1946
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
And do you know why you're
going to do all this, Donald?

1947
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
-No. Why?
-Because we are good.

1948
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Paxton, Donald,
we three are good.

1949
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And the bastards
who told me to fire you

1950
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
and the bastard
who bought that diamond,

1951
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
they won't even realize
that it's gone.

1952
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
-Mention the NHS.
-Yeah. Yes, ooh!

1953
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
What do you say, Donald?

1954
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Will you
lie for us, Donald?

1955
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I see
all this anarchy

1956
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Idiotic,
insane fucking lockdown

1957
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
which has liberated us all.

1958
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Donald, we'll give you money.
I'll give you 200 grand.

1959
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Fuck the money.
I don't do this for money,

1960
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I do this for beauty.

1961
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Linda, you are wonderful.

1962
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Linda, and he is
your secret bandit lover,

1963
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
and you are going
to spit in the face

1964
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
of the global monolith.

1965
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
During lockdown
I've had time

1966
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
to think and walk in the park
near my mother's house,

1967
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
and God, apart from
the dog walkers

1968
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
breathing everywhere,
God, it is

1969
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Even before
the fucking virus,

1970
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
we were all locked down
in our own routines,

1971
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
our versions
of ourselves...

1972
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Linda, we have to get
the fuck out of here.

1973
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Let Donald have his moment.

1974
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
...never get to work!

1975
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I only came here tonight

1976
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
because I was worried
about you, Linda.

1977
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I don't give a fuck
about Miracore,

1978
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
their fucking diamonds,
I don't care about them.

1979
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I want everything
to be stolen.

1980
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I will lie for you, Linda,

1981
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:19,000
because this is my moment
to fucking do something!

1982
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Mad, all this, isn't it?

1983
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
-Yeah.
-

1984
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Who'd have thought
a month ago

1985
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Not me.

1986
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Paging Edgar Allen Poe.

1987
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Edgar Allen Poe,
please report to security.

1988
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,

1989
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
please report
to security immediately.

1990
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I think
we should speed up.

1991
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Don't rush. We're not trying
to evacuate Dunkirk!

1992
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Stop there. If you walk,

1993
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
you should be
on the starboard side.

1994
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Leave it.
Leave it.

1995
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Linda?

1996
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
-  Paging

1997
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,
please report to security.

1998
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
It's Michael
with the arrows

1999
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
-  Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,

2000
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
please report
to security immediately.

2001
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Oh, fuck.

2002
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
You'll have to turn in
your Harrods pass.

2003
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
You go. Save yourself.

2004
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It's me that fate
is fucking with.

2005
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Just keep walking.

2006
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Edgar Allen Poe.

2007
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
You left this
in the office.

2008
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
You'll need it at Heathrow.

2009
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Thanks very much.

2010
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Everybody says, uh,
come back soon, Linda,

2011
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
and we all love you.

2012
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Since that night,
we've established

2013
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
that although we're now
both rich

2014
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
and no longer have
to do jobs we despise,

2015
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
the strains of lockdown

2016
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
are still severely testing
our relationship.

2017
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
"Happy ever after"
cannot survive

2018
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
someone hiding
your bag of flour.

2019
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Okay, come on. Okay.

2020
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Here is your bag of flour.
I just...

2021
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I want you to promise me that
you're not gonna make bread.

2022
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Why not?

2023
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Because of the mess
and the pointlessness

2024
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
and because
it will be inedible,

2025
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
it will be a fucking
pointless cannonball.

2026
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
My dad used to make it
and we had to eat it,

2027
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
otherwise he would disappear
into his workshop

2028
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
and make these
hopeless wooden toys.

2029
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
-Never again.
-Linda, you've lost

2030
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
What? I've lost--

2031
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
You buried a hedgehog

2032
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
and said a eulogy
over the fucking grave.

2033
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
And you deliberately
stuck a piece

2034
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
-above the stairs.
-No, it was there all along.

2035
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
-I almost
broke my fucking neck.

2036
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I would have held
the stepladders.

2037
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
If it had been there
"all along,"

2038
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I would have noticed it.

2039
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
But you haven't noticed
that there was no point

2040
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
in packing a suitcase

2041
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
because there is nowhere
you can actually go.

2042
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
They just extended lockdown
by another two weeks.

2043
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Oh, shit.

2044
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Well...

2045
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
All that
for a bag of flour

2046
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
and a definitely
pre-existing piece

2047
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,000
And because today
is my birthday.

2048
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,000
-It's okay.

2049
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
-I know.
- It's okay.

2050
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
-It's lockdown.
-No, I knew that.

2051
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,000
-Nobody knows what day it is,
never mind the date.

2052
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I got you something
you really, really want.

2053
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Go crazy.

2054
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
-Another two weeks?
-Another two weeks.

2055
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Well, then,
my long suffering public

2056
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
may need another poem.

2057
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Hmm.

2058
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Counting The Beats
by Robert Graves.

2059
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
"You, love, and I,
you and I,

2060
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
and if no more
than only you and I,

2061
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
what care you and I?"

2062
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:35,000
"Counting the beats,
counting the slow heartbeats,

2063
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:40,000
the bleeding to death of time
in slow heartbeats,

2064
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
wakeful we lie.

2065
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Cloudless day, night,
and another cloudless day,

2066
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,000
yet a huge cloud will burst
upon their heads one day."

2067
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And on that day,
lockdown will end!

2068
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
"Only here,
as we are here, together,

2069
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:07,000
now and here,
always you and I."
