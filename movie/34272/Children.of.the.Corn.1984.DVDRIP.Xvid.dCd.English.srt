1
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,632
- Morning.
- Morning, priest.

2
00:01:24,444 --> 00:01:29,040
It was about 3 years ago. I was
the only kid in church that day.

3
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,415
The others were with Isaac
out at the cornfield.

4
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:35,243
I didn't get to go
'cause dad didn't like Isaac.

5
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:37,954
He was pretty smart, my dad.

6
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:42,285
After church we've been
to Hansen's, just like always.

7
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:46,690
Sarah was homesick with mom.
She'd turned down with a fever.

8
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,201
- Morning, Dave.
- Morning.

9
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,803
- How are your wife and Sarah?
- Dad was worried...

10
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,008
so he went to call mom
first thing.

11
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,238
- I'm gonna call your mom, ok?
- Okay!

12
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:08,514
- You want the usual?
- Yeah, strawberty shake.

13
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:11,386
That's when I saw Malachai
and the others.

14
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,558
I guess the meeting with Isaac
was over.

15
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,425
They were acting real creepy.

16
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:25,266
- There you go, Jobie.
- Thanks.

17
00:02:37,684 --> 00:02:41,313
- How is she?
- I'm worried, Dave.

18
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:45,383
The fever's gone
from 101 to 104.

19
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,758
Sure.

20
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,393
Okay.

21
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:29,468
Good coffee.

22
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,524
Oh, my God!

23
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,679
No!

24
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:51,444
It happened everywhere
in Gatlin that day.

25
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:55,579
That's when Sarah started
drawing these pictures.

26
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,853
Happy birthday!

27
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,452
What are you doing?

28
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:22,929
C'mon!
Make a wish.

29
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,942
What did you wish for?

30
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,253
To live happily ever after.

31
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:49,223
- Is that a proposal?
- No, it's not.

32
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:55,395
Well, I guess I'll
give you this anyway.

33
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,175
What is it?

34
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,707
- That's nice!
- Turn it over.

35
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:28,589
In honor of this special occasion
we'll have a birthday serenade.

36
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:34,570
1, 2.
1, 2, 3, 4.

37
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:37,569
No more books and studies

38
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:40,971
Now I can stay all day
With my buddies

39
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:46,310
I can do the things I wanna do
'Cause all my exams are through

40
00:08:47,186 --> 00:08:50,349
I can root for the Yankees
From the beaches

41
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:53,558
And don't have to worry
About teachers

42
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:56,851
And I'm so glad
That school is out

43
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,495
I could sing and shout

44
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,400
School is out
Everybody's gonna have some fun

45
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,502
Everybody's gonna jump and run

46
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,740
C'mon, people
Don't you be late

47
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:12,977
I just got time
To take my girl out today

48
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,780
You're whacko.

49
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,211
Holy cow!

50
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:31,587
We better get going now.
I got a lot of driving to do today.

51
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:34,556
Couldn't wejust say
the hell with it...

52
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:37,630
- and stay for a couple of hours?
- I wish.

53
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:42,037
Starting Monday I've got
fifty patients a day to look at

54
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:46,543
- I've some things you could look at.
- Is that right?

55
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,215
Hello?

56
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,819
Hello?
Maid service.

57
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:58,352
We'll be out in a minute.

58
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,486
We gotta get going.

59
00:10:02,328 --> 00:10:04,694
I'm gonna grab a quick shower
before we go, okay?

60
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:24,580
C'mon, honey! You're making
something out of nothing.

61
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,613
To me is something,
to you is nothing.

62
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,647
I'm just worried about this
internship, okay?

63
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:33,023
I've been working forthis
forfouryears.

64
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:34,987
I know.

65
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:38,721
I do understand.

66
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:43,791
Why do you have to be
such ajerk about it?

67
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:53,111
Welcome to Nebraska.

68
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:24,403
We weren't the only ones
who thought Isaac was weird.

69
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:27,675
One day Joseph told us
he was running away.

70
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:30,206
He said he couldn't
take it anymore.

71
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:33,017
He was pretty scared.
I wasn't.

72
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,583
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

73
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:37,480
There's nothing to be afraid of.

74
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:40,021
I said I'd come back foryou.
I promise.

75
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:42,591
- Can we go with you? Please!
- No.

76
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:44,556
I'd never make it with you two.

77
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:47,833
- But we don't like it here.
- I said you'll be alright!

78
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,464
As long as nobody finds
that pictures you've been drawing.

79
00:11:50,736 --> 00:11:52,226
She can't help it.

80
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:54,837
That won't matter
to Isaac and Malachai

81
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,667
They'll take it as a sign.

82
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:59,104
Anyway, you now crayons
and drawings are forbidden.

83
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:02,178
- Just like that record player.
- But we like it.

84
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:04,473
Isaac doesn't let us do anything.

85
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,150
Youjust better mind
until I get back.

86
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,149
Or else, you know what happens.

87
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:17,388
- Are you going through the corn?
- I can't go no other way.

88
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:19,992
- What if...
- I said it'll be alright.

89
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:24,030
- Unless you tell anybody I'm gone.
- We won't.

90
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:28,900
Cross your heat? Hope to die,
stick a needle in your eye.

91
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,239
You know what that means now?

92
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:34,708
If you tell, you're gonna burn in
a lake of fire for all eternity.

93
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,010
Make sure nobody's looking.

94
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:47,221
- Okay. Go!
- Nobody's looking.

95
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:35,203
I spy...

96
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,601
something that begins
with the letter "C".

97
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:41,273
- Corn.
- Right.

98
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:43,715
So now we know...

99
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,151
back roads are even less
interesting than the highways.

100
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,252
Maybe they've discovered music...

101
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:55,184
Hallelujah!
There are many Lord's mansions...

102
00:13:55,427 --> 00:14:00,160
but there's no room
for the fornicator!

103
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:03,026
- No room!
- No room...

104
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:06,136
- for the homosexual!
- No room!

105
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:10,236
No room
for the drugs user!

106
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:11,966
No room!

107
00:14:12,878 --> 00:14:15,312
Amen.
Peanut butter and white bread!

108
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:17,640
There's no room
forthe college graduated!

109
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,612
No room for people
who watch public television.

110
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,413
- No room for commitments!
- Amen!

111
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:28,087
C'mon!

112
00:15:34,193 --> 00:15:35,387
Here it is.

113
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:42,528
- I wonder how it got here.
- Not me.

114
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,367
It looks like this one
goes to Grand Island...

115
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:54,636
and this one
cuts up to the highway.

116
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:01,518
Where's this Gatlin that we've
been seeing the signs for?

117
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:06,681
- It's not on here.
- How come? It's gotta be.

118
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:08,883
Look out!

119
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:23,066
Hang on.
Let me check.

120
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:24,572
Let me check.

121
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:28,304
- Where? Right there?
- Yeah.

122
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:33,115
It was just a bump.
Just tty to relax.

123
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:38,114
That was an animal, right?

124
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:42,656
I gotta go back there, okay
Just stay here and tty to rest.

125
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:59,070
C'mon, buddy.

126
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:02,537
Oh God!

127
00:17:07,786 --> 00:17:10,949
- Is he...
- Oh yeah.

128
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:23,624
- Oh God!
- Easy, easy. C'mon.

129
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,267
Easy.
Don't look at him.

130
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:36,305
Now listen to me.
There's something vety wrong here.

131
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:39,577
So I want you to go back to the car
and wait for me there. Understand?

132
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:42,548
- And keep the doors locked.
- Why? Where are you going?

133
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:45,279
I'll tell you when I get back.
Just do what I say.

134
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,116
Burt.

135
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:12,069
Burt.

136
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,066
Burt.

137
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,819
Burt.

138
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:51,742
I'm so sorty.

139
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:57,213
- Vicky, c'mon.
- Burt!

140
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:00,809
- Easy. Calm down.
- I kneeled down next to him.

141
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:05,649
It's ok. Take it easy.
Take it easy and relax.

142
00:21:08,427 --> 00:21:12,557
It's okay, understand?
You're okay.

143
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:04,812
Me and Sarah were playing in our
old house. We play there lots.

144
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,346
Malachai said it was forbidden.

145
00:22:08,053 --> 00:22:11,022
But I think that's because nobody
ever asked him to play.

146
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,921
When I grow up, I'm gonna have
all the money in the world.

147
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:19,628
- Me too.
- You can't.

148
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,661
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm gonna have it.

149
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:25,094
- I'll get it first.
- Will not.

150
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:26,803
- Will too.
- Will not.

151
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:29,872
- Will too.
- Oh yeah? How?

152
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:42,351
Seven.

153
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:49,620
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

154
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,624
seven.

155
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,230
Alright! See?
Two hundred dollars.

156
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:57,435
No, Jobie!

157
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:05,333
How much?

158
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:10,771
- Thirteen thousand hundred dollars.
- Thirteen thousand hundred dollars?

159
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:14,184
Okay, two thousand.

160
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,244
I thought so.

161
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,592
One hundred, two hundred, three...
I gotta a great idea.

162
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:28,057
Let's pretend this guy is Isaac
and we'll put him injail.

163
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:31,730
What if he gets to get out
ofjail with a free card?

164
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:36,197
What card?

165
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:59,488
You think it might've been some
accident with farm equipment?

166
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:01,857
Not like that.

167
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:05,801
His throat was cut deliberately.

168
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:10,566
He was already dead
when he stumbled down the road.

169
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:13,905
Whoever killed him,
do you think he saw us?

170
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:18,340
- I felt like we're being watched.
- Possible.

171
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:22,411
Blood starts to coagulate
in four minutes.

172
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:25,651
When I went to get the suitcase
it was still fresh.

173
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:29,918
- He could have been out there!
- I couldn'tjust leave it there.

174
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:32,559
What if it holds
some sort of clue?

175
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,997
- Let's open it.
- No.

176
00:24:38,403 --> 00:24:41,372
Let's just get to a phone
or a house or some place.

177
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,403
Malachai took us
right to Isaac.

178
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:51,409
He'd finally convinced him
punishing us for being unbelievers.

179
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,480
Up to them, we've been forgiven
'cause we were in the corn...

180
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,653
the day that "He Who Walks Behind
the Rows" made himself known.

181
00:24:58,056 --> 00:25:01,856
That bothered Malachai.
He had a lot of problems.

182
00:25:10,602 --> 00:25:12,763
I found these two
in one of the old homes...

183
00:25:13,271 --> 00:25:15,569
they had a game, music...

184
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:20,101
and this.

185
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:25,549
They come already.

186
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,918
You have the gift of sight.

187
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:39,727
- This is a blessing, my child.
- I've seen this car up on the road.

188
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:44,391
Go to the old man.
Make sure he tells them nothing.

189
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,795
What about these two?

190
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:54,177
Take them back
where they were.

191
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:57,245
But they had a game and music.
They're forbidden.

192
00:25:57,482 --> 00:26:01,782
Question me not, Malachai.
I act according to His will.

193
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:23,000
It seems we are in the Moon.
We haven't even seen a truck.

194
00:26:23,174 --> 00:26:25,074
We'll be in Gatlin soon.

195
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,640
Do you think he lived there?

196
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:33,081
We may never knowthat.

197
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,017
I really thing we should open it.

198
00:26:38,823 --> 00:26:40,381
Okay.

199
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,228
Let's see if we can get
some news.

200
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:58,602
I'm getting tired of that crap.

201
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,140
What is it?

202
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,591
- Jesus Christ!
- Not in my Book.

203
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:20,254
- It looks like primitive folk art.
- I think it's repulsive.

204
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,471
Sarge, bring the number six.

205
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:38,580
Damn it!
You better give me the eight.

206
00:27:41,886 --> 00:27:44,684
C'mon.
We haven't got all day.

207
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,897
Good boy.

208
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,832
We'll have that transmission fixed
in no time...

209
00:27:57,502 --> 00:27:59,697
then, we'll get on the radiator.

210
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:04,530
Damn. This road is becoming
a bloody highway.

211
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:07,739
I think it's the third car
in a month.

212
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:10,708
We know what to do, don't we?

213
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:22,186
We better put that suitcase away.

214
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:27,831
I'll be right back.

215
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,735
- Hi, we got a...
- I ain't got no gas.

216
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:38,701
- I don't need gas.
- I ain't got no diesel.

217
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,844
- You don't understand. I need...
- lf you don't buy gas...

218
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:44,081
you can't use the rest room.

219
00:28:46,117 --> 00:28:48,244
- I need to use your phone.
- Telephone?

220
00:28:48,453 --> 00:28:50,614
I ain't got no telephone.
Sarge.

221
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,887
Sarge, you be still.

222
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:10,000
You have to go to Hemingford.
It's about 19 miles down there.

223
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:13,301
- What about Gatlin?
- There ain't nothing in Gatlin.

224
00:29:17,415 --> 00:29:19,383
What do you mean:
"There ain't nothing in Gatlin."?

225
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:22,618
Folks in Gatlin got religious.
They don't like outsiders...

226
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:25,288
and they probably won't have
a phone there either.

227
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:30,623
I'd like to stay here and talk,
but I got a transmission to fix.

228
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:34,993
If you get on that road
you'll be in Hemingford in no time.

229
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,896
- Right.
- Sarge, sit! At ease!

230
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:42,897
Thanks a lot.

231
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:48,207
Sarge!

232
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,575
Eitherthat man is senile, or he's
being out in the Sun fortoo long.

233
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:57,679
Sarge!
Come back here.

234
00:29:58,122 --> 00:29:59,453
Sarge!
Come back here!

235
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:07,224
Under the awning!

236
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,257
You hear me?
Come back here.

237
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,102
That's an order.

238
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,812
Who is it?
Is that you?

239
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,978
What do you want?

240
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:47,628
What are you doing there?

241
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:08,555
Well, there really isn't that much
stuff in here. Just kids' stuff.

242
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,489
Clothes, matches,
compass, pocket knife.

243
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,594
- I don't get it. Camping stuff?
- Yeah.

244
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:20,532
Oh, great!
This must be our day.

245
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:24,032
In the last sign we saw
Gatlin was 3 miles...

246
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:26,573
- and pointed that way?
- That's what I thought.

247
00:31:27,245 --> 00:31:31,113
- Did I miss a turn?
- No, we've been going straight.

248
00:31:32,116 --> 00:31:34,641
Somebody's been
messing with the signs.

249
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,811
Hemingford is gotta be
straight ahead.

250
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:48,356
Must have been the wind.

251
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:21,899
These latches ain't worth a damn.
Blow all for nothing.

252
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:38,212
I nevertold them nothing.
I swear it.

253
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,779
I kept our bargain
just like always.

254
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,517
Jesus Christ! Gatlin! What do they
have? Amonopoly on road signs?

255
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:52,523
What about Hemingford?

256
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,528
For people who don't like visitors
they sure do advertise enough.

257
00:32:59,537 --> 00:33:01,971
Overthere.

258
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:08,068
Of course, it's the wind.

259
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,470
Why did you have to go
afterthem, Sarge?

260
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:57,054
You bastards!
You can't do this to me.

261
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,189
I know you're in here.

262
00:34:36,968 --> 00:34:38,060
C'mon! C'mon!

263
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:52,544
I can smell you, you stinky
little skunks.

264
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:54,677
C'mon!

265
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:05,053
Murderers little devils!

266
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:08,525
C'mon!

267
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:36,590
- What was that?
- Probably my golf bag.

268
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:39,655
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean: "Am I sure."?

269
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:06,750
This isn't even a road.

270
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:09,559
- We'll never gotta get out of here.
- We'll too. Stop it.

271
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:14,663
Sorty.

272
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:19,598
- Just tell me where we are.
- I don't know.

273
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:35,449
We're back where we started from.

274
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:38,348
We never should have listen
to that old fool.

275
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:43,017
Hemingford is 19 miles,
Gatlin is only 3.

276
00:36:43,227 --> 00:36:45,889
I don't care how much religious
they've got. We're going there.

277
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:49,566
Don't ever show up
in my emergency room, buddy.

278
00:37:08,286 --> 00:37:10,117
Behold.

279
00:37:11,222 --> 00:37:16,785
Adream did come to me in the
night. And the Lord show all to me.

280
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:20,097
Praise God!
Praise the Lord.

281
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:23,060
Atime of tribulation has come.

282
00:37:24,068 --> 00:37:26,195
Atest is at hand.

283
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:31,000
- The final test.
- What has the Lord commanded?

284
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:32,700
In the dream...

285
00:37:33,344 --> 00:37:36,677
the Lord did come to me
and he was a shape.

286
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:40,148
It was He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

287
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:43,652
And I did fall on my knees
in terror and hide my eyes...

288
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:47,448
unless the fierceness of His face
struck me dead.

289
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:50,855
He told me all
that it since happened.

290
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:56,594
He said:"Joseph has taken his
things and fled this happy place...

291
00:37:56,934 --> 00:38:00,961
because the worship of me
is no more upon him...

292
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:05,899
so take you his life
and spill his blood".

293
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,609
- He did?
- Yes.

294
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:11,948
"But let not the flesh
pollute the corn.

295
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:15,218
- Cast him instead upon the road."
- And so was done.

296
00:38:15,486 --> 00:38:17,852
Joseph, the betrayer,
was cast out.

297
00:38:18,356 --> 00:38:21,223
And He Who Walks
Behind the Rows did say...

298
00:38:22,026 --> 00:38:24,893
"I will send outlanders
amongst you.

299
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:29,221
Aman and a woman.
And these outlanders...

300
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:32,630
will be unbelievers
and profaners of the holy".

301
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,406
- I thought Isaac never came here.
- But he's always been here.

302
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:39,107
Just like He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

303
00:38:39,377 --> 00:38:41,743
"And the man shall
sorely test you...

304
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:46,812
for He has great power. Even
greaterthan that of the blue man.

305
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:50,447
The blue man!
Yes, the blue man!

306
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:54,415
And just as the blue man
was offered upon to Him...

307
00:38:54,725 --> 00:38:59,594
- so shall be the unbelievers!
- Make sacrifice unto Him.

308
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,663
Bring the blood
of the outlanders.

309
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:05,028
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

310
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:07,999
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

311
00:39:08,272 --> 00:39:10,638
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

312
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:13,432
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

313
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:16,612
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

314
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:18,439
Let's get out of here!

315
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:21,315
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

316
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:24,146
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

317
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:02,521
It looks like a swinging place.

318
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:19,871
I guess nobody told them
we were coming.

319
00:40:20,344 --> 00:40:22,005
I hope not.

320
00:40:24,081 --> 00:40:25,878
I don't see anybody.

321
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:36,291
Town Hall.

322
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:40,029
Grocety store. Hansen's Cafe.
It seems they got a phone.

323
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:43,531
Unless a ghost is using it.

324
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:16,055
- What is it with this corn?
- You got me.

325
00:41:38,122 --> 00:41:41,455
Is dead.
Just like evetything else here.

326
00:41:44,728 --> 00:41:49,256
- A rat.
- Yeah. Just an ordinaty rat.

327
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,762
Now can we
get out of here, please?

328
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,165
Wait a minute!
Come back here!

329
00:41:58,776 --> 00:42:01,006
C'mon, Vicky. Hurty up.
I don't wanna lose them.

330
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,820
What are you gonna do
if you catch them?

331
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:19,220
Ask where we can get help.
What else?

332
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,791
They just got off that way.

333
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:27,497
Damn!
Where did they go?

334
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:33,305
We're already in the car. Why
wouldn't wejust go to Hemingford?

335
00:42:33,611 --> 00:42:36,102
- That would take us 20 minutes.
- We'd just found people.

336
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:38,941
Yeah, three kids
that tried to steal our car.

337
00:42:40,884 --> 00:42:43,079
There's something
vety strange about this town.

338
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,892
We'd be better off
in a biggertown anyway.

339
00:42:52,596 --> 00:42:55,258
- The size of Seattle.
- Yeah.

340
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:07,777
- Overthere!
- What?

341
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:11,980
- I just saw a door open and close.
- I didn't see anything.

342
00:43:13,617 --> 00:43:16,950
- Let's check it out.
- Why? I thought we were going.

343
00:43:18,088 --> 00:43:21,114
- Settle down.
- Don't patronize me.

344
00:43:21,325 --> 00:43:23,452
I'm not patronizing you. I just
wanna see if there's someone there.

345
00:43:32,336 --> 00:43:33,826
Hello?

346
00:43:40,644 --> 00:43:41,906
Hello?

347
00:43:45,482 --> 00:43:47,177
Anybody home?

348
00:43:50,187 --> 00:43:52,747
We've had an accident.
We need to use your phone.

349
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:57,320
Okay.
Now can we go?

350
00:44:03,734 --> 00:44:07,067
- Burt, this is somebody's house.
- I know. I just want a phone.

351
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,432
Hello?

352
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:39,533
Gross.

353
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:43,472
I'll check out the back.

354
00:44:57,121 --> 00:44:59,089
I found the phone.

355
00:45:01,191 --> 00:45:05,218
Matches the decor.
This is three years old.

356
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:12,528
I don't understand
what's going on here.

357
00:45:13,737 --> 00:45:16,103
Well, can we go?

358
00:45:23,781 --> 00:45:24,839
Burt!

359
00:45:43,901 --> 00:45:45,266
Hello?

360
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:56,002
Anybody here?

361
00:47:17,728 --> 00:47:21,289
Don't be afraid.
We didn't mean to scare you.

362
00:47:22,366 --> 00:47:24,095
Hi!

363
00:47:26,837 --> 00:47:29,738
- What's your name?
- Sarah.

364
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:32,874
Sarah!
That's a beautiful name.

365
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:37,642
- This is Burt and I'm Vicky.
- Are you here alone, Sarah?

366
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:42,008
Do you live here?

367
00:47:43,754 --> 00:47:46,314
Youjust come here to play?

368
00:47:48,892 --> 00:47:52,692
- Are your mommy and daddy around?
- They're in the corn field.

369
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:58,127
- What are they doing there?
- All the grown ups are there.

370
00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:02,004
Are they working there
or having a meeting?

371
00:48:02,773 --> 00:48:06,038
No. Isaac put them there.

372
00:48:06,743 --> 00:48:08,301
Who's Isaac?

373
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:14,839
- Sweetheart, tell us who Isaac is.
- Our leader.

374
00:48:15,452 --> 00:48:16,749
Leader of what?

375
00:48:18,288 --> 00:48:20,119
Evetybody.

376
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:23,148
Of course.

377
00:48:27,531 --> 00:48:30,261
Listen,
could you take us to Isaac?

378
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,735
- Why not?
- He's scaty.

379
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:39,566
It's vety important we speak to
some grown ups as soon as possible.

380
00:48:39,943 --> 00:48:43,037
- We're wasting ourtime, Vicky.
- Give her a chance.

381
00:48:43,981 --> 00:48:45,778
I'm gonna go look
at the Town Hall.

382
00:48:46,183 --> 00:48:48,048
Why?

383
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,014
Because we have a murder
to report...

384
00:48:51,288 --> 00:48:53,950
and we're walking in circles,
wasting ourtime.

385
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:57,756
- Maybe she can help.
- Fine. You stay here with her.

386
00:49:00,797 --> 00:49:03,322
Things aren't happening fast.

387
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:06,291
I'm gonna leave you the car.

388
00:49:06,603 --> 00:49:09,902
I won't be gone vety long.
If anybody comes, honk. Okay?

389
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:16,708
Are we safe?

390
00:49:17,981 --> 00:49:20,848
Yes. It's weird here,
but it's safe.

391
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,385
I'll be back.

392
00:49:41,705 --> 00:49:44,435
So, it looks like it's just
you and me.

393
00:49:46,376 --> 00:49:49,243
What were you doing here
by yourself? Just playing records?

394
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:54,416
Come on, you can tell me.

395
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,347
Drawing.

396
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:00,520
Drawing...

397
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:04,227
- what's so secret about drawing?
- I'm not supposed to.

398
00:50:04,828 --> 00:50:06,921
You're not supposed to draw?

399
00:50:08,065 --> 00:50:12,399
- Who says? Isaac?
- Malachai.

400
00:50:13,036 --> 00:50:14,833
Malachai?

401
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:19,469
Why don't you draw me a picture
we won't tell Isaac...

402
00:50:19,676 --> 00:50:21,610
or Malachai
or anybody?

403
00:50:21,778 --> 00:50:23,746
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

404
00:53:42,712 --> 00:53:45,647
- How's it coming?
- Fine.

405
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,950
- What did you draw?
- You.

406
00:53:50,453 --> 00:53:53,115
You did?
Can I see?

407
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:05,294
What is this?

408
00:54:06,736 --> 00:54:08,670
Burt?

409
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:18,009
Burt, is that you?

410
00:54:38,368 --> 00:54:39,562
Burt, is that you?

411
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:43,799
Somebody here?

412
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:50,573
Who are you?

413
00:54:51,881 --> 00:54:53,143
What do you want?

414
00:54:56,553 --> 00:54:59,147
We want to give you peace.

415
00:55:00,523 --> 00:55:02,582
Seize her.

416
00:55:03,126 --> 00:55:05,890
Come on! Get her!
Let's finish it!

417
00:55:16,473 --> 00:55:18,498
No!
No!

418
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:48,531
Burt!
Burt!

419
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:53,268
Burt!
Burt!

420
00:55:55,845 --> 00:56:01,511
- Are we safe?
- Yes, it's weird here, but it's safe.

421
00:56:12,362 --> 00:56:14,455
Help me!

422
00:56:15,465 --> 00:56:17,126
Where are you taking me?

423
00:56:20,203 --> 00:56:21,693
Help!

424
00:56:22,806 --> 00:56:24,603
Help!

425
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:39,988
Vicky!

426
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:49,625
Sarah, what happened here?

427
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:51,858
What happened?
Where's Vicky?

428
00:56:52,202 --> 00:56:53,863
You've gotta think.
Think.

429
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,828
What happened to her?
Please!

430
00:57:00,477 --> 00:57:02,035
Does He speak to you, Isaac?

431
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:07,275
He speaks to me always.
But today he's displeased.

432
00:57:07,817 --> 00:57:09,808
He's displeased with you,
Malachai.

433
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:12,485
What have I done?

434
00:57:13,423 --> 00:57:15,323
Question Him not in vain.

435
00:57:15,525 --> 00:57:18,551
Do you not know you sacrificed
Joseph without an offering?

436
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:21,192
And did you not spill the blood
of the old man...

437
00:57:21,498 --> 00:57:24,092
when his oil and gasoline
were still useful to us?

438
00:57:24,334 --> 00:57:26,461
We have our own fuel now
from the corn.

439
00:57:26,769 --> 00:57:30,170
Sow not your pride, Malachai.
We have not enough.

440
00:57:32,709 --> 00:57:35,041
Maybe He's displeased
that we have not offered Him...

441
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:38,712
- Sarah and Jobe.
- Sarah has the gift of sight.

442
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:42,015
She warned us of the coming
of the interlopers.

443
00:57:42,552 --> 00:57:45,316
Question not my judgment,
Malachai.

444
00:57:46,122 --> 00:57:48,090
I am the giver of His word.

445
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:53,158
Go you and bring me the husband.

446
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:56,294
We must offerthem tonight
when Amos leaves.

447
00:57:59,669 --> 00:58:02,137
Sarah, come on.
Tell me what happened to her.

448
00:58:03,573 --> 00:58:06,633
Look at me!
Think!

449
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:09,472
- What?
- Malachai.

450
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,070
Who's Malachai?
What do you mean?

451
00:58:29,098 --> 00:58:30,429
Vicky?

452
00:58:36,739 --> 00:58:38,070
Vicky?

453
00:58:44,814 --> 00:58:46,179
Vicky?

454
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:43,437
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

455
00:59:43,673 --> 00:59:46,904
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

456
00:59:47,143 --> 00:59:50,306
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

457
00:59:50,546 --> 00:59:52,673
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

458
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:55,373
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

459
00:59:55,618 --> 00:59:58,678
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

460
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:05,622
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

461
01:00:46,569 --> 01:00:49,333
Nowthe blood of Amos
will be shared.

462
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,301
Stop it!
Stop that!

463
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:54,532
Hold the outlander!

464
01:01:01,084 --> 01:01:02,711
What the hell is going on here?

465
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,049
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

466
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:08,515
My passage.
It's my birthday.

467
01:01:08,758 --> 01:01:10,988
You've got a pretty sick way
of celebrating it, pal.

468
01:01:12,428 --> 01:01:14,658
Silence, interloper!

469
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:18,695
Your presence profanes
this holy place.

470
01:01:19,068 --> 01:01:22,003
- He will wreck with you.
- Great. I don't know who He is.

471
01:01:22,238 --> 01:01:24,706
Maybe He'd like to discuss
what's going on here with me.

472
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,599
- It says it should be...
- Amos!

473
01:01:26,843 --> 01:01:29,141
- It says it is written.
- Speak no more to him!

474
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:32,779
He is an unbeliever.
Hurty, get Isaac!

475
01:01:33,082 --> 01:01:37,985
No! Wait!
Bring Malachai.

476
01:01:42,959 --> 01:01:45,985
What do you mean: "As it's
written? "Written where?

477
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:53,330
What? In this?

478
01:01:54,237 --> 01:01:57,070
Are you rewriting the whole thing
orthe parts that suit your needs?

479
01:02:05,214 --> 01:02:07,614
- Back off!
- Sit down!

480
01:02:09,986 --> 01:02:11,851
What do we have here?

481
01:02:12,622 --> 01:02:15,591
Nineteen, eighteen...
What is this?

482
01:02:16,058 --> 01:02:18,253
- These people died so young!
- Not died.

483
01:02:18,661 --> 01:02:21,824
We go to Him the first night
of our nineteenth year.

484
01:02:22,131 --> 01:02:23,257
Who the hell is Him?

485
01:02:23,499 --> 01:02:25,330
He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

486
01:02:25,568 --> 01:02:27,058
Malachai comes!

487
01:02:29,906 --> 01:02:31,271
Seize him!

488
01:02:33,609 --> 01:02:35,236
Back off!

489
01:02:55,097 --> 01:02:57,827
Seize him.
Do not let him escape.

490
01:03:07,476 --> 01:03:11,344
Where is he?
Come on!

491
01:03:12,181 --> 01:03:15,878
There he is. Go get him!
You! Go that way!

492
01:03:36,439 --> 01:03:39,431
I need your help!
Come on!

493
01:03:39,642 --> 01:03:41,769
Come on, help me
Help me!

494
01:03:42,011 --> 01:03:44,775
Outlander!
He's here.

495
01:03:58,427 --> 01:04:00,691
- Got you.
- This isn't a game.

496
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:02,863
Back off!

497
01:04:08,871 --> 01:04:11,396
Outlander!

498
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,570
Go get him!

499
01:04:32,628 --> 01:04:33,856
Check the doors!
Check the doors!

500
01:04:40,569 --> 01:04:44,096
You guys go back to the alley.
You, overthere. You two follow me.

501
01:04:59,322 --> 01:05:00,687
Shit!

502
01:05:55,111 --> 01:05:56,271
Damn it!

503
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:18,966
Hey, mister!

504
01:06:20,202 --> 01:06:23,194
I know a place to hide.
But we gotta hurty.

505
01:06:23,539 --> 01:06:27,498
- Who are you?
- Jobe. Stop asking questions.

506
01:06:34,016 --> 01:06:35,108
Come on!

507
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:40,285
Will you come on?

508
01:06:55,337 --> 01:06:56,668
Careful.

509
01:06:57,773 --> 01:06:59,673
Don't be a scared cat.

510
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:04,236
- Come on. It's only me and Sarah.
- Sarah?

511
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,414
Yes, my sister.

512
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,786
Isn't that nice?

513
01:07:12,054 --> 01:07:13,112
My dad built it...

514
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:15,584
when the communists launched
theirfirst strike.

515
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,285
I don't think it's the communists
we have to worty about.

516
01:07:20,763 --> 01:07:23,596
Don't worty.
Nobody knows about this place.

517
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,498
It's secret.

518
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,027
- Those guys are friends of yours?
- No way!

519
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,670
They listen to Isaac
and Malachai.

520
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:35,943
- Who are Isaac and Malachai?
- Isaac started the whole thing.

521
01:07:36,479 --> 01:07:39,004
If he hadn't come,
this would never have happened.

522
01:07:39,281 --> 01:07:41,146
When he was young,
he was a preacher...

523
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:42,874
so evetybody believed him.

524
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,053
They thought he had
a great spirit.

525
01:07:45,721 --> 01:07:47,518
I thought he was weird.

526
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:00,928
We must sacrifice
them both tonight.

527
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,066
Amos will satisfy Him.
We need the woman.

528
01:08:04,273 --> 01:08:06,434
- She'll bring the man to us.
- No.

529
01:08:06,675 --> 01:08:08,438
He must be taken
without her.

530
01:08:08,677 --> 01:08:11,111
We cannot remove her
from this place. It is holy.

531
01:08:11,413 --> 01:08:14,246
We'll bring the Lord two
by using one.

532
01:08:14,483 --> 01:08:15,973
Do not blaspheme, Malachai.

533
01:08:16,252 --> 01:08:19,153
You know not the laws.
He speaks them only to me.

534
01:08:19,388 --> 01:08:20,616
I think not, Isaac.

535
01:08:20,856 --> 01:08:22,687
You are the one who's lost
favor with Him.

536
01:08:22,925 --> 01:08:25,826
He's a God of blood
and sacrifice, not ceremonies.

537
01:08:26,028 --> 01:08:28,895
Sacrilege!
Down on your knees, heretic!

538
01:08:29,098 --> 01:08:32,329
Shut your mouth, Isaac!
You've grown proud farfrom us.

539
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:37,930
He Who Walks Behind The Rows
will decide yourfate.

540
01:08:38,574 --> 01:08:41,737
Don't you sit there, seize him!
Punish him, cut him down.

541
01:08:41,944 --> 01:08:43,536
I command you!

542
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:46,043
I am the word and the giver
of His laws.

543
01:08:46,248 --> 01:08:48,546
Disobedience to me
is disobedience to Him.

544
01:08:48,918 --> 01:08:51,079
Do it now oryour punishment
will be a thousand times...

545
01:08:51,353 --> 01:08:54,413
a thousand deaths, each more
horrible than the last.

546
01:08:54,623 --> 01:08:57,615
They're tired of yourtalk.
I've showed them what I can do.

547
01:08:57,927 --> 01:09:01,795
Cut the woman down.
Put Isaac in her place.

548
01:09:02,064 --> 01:09:04,692
We'll see howthe Lord
favors you.

549
01:09:04,967 --> 01:09:06,696
Dare not to blaspheme.

550
01:09:06,936 --> 01:09:09,063
He will punish you.
The God of hell will devouryou.

551
01:09:09,371 --> 01:09:10,736
All of you!

552
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,636
No! No!
No! No!

553
01:09:16,178 --> 01:09:20,638
When my dad wouldn't get up
I ran from Hansen...

554
01:09:21,016 --> 01:09:23,348
to get Officer Hodgekiss.
But it was too late.

555
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:25,018
Why?
What happened to him?

556
01:09:25,254 --> 01:09:27,313
He got away at that time.

557
01:09:27,523 --> 01:09:30,185
He went to the barn
after he talked to the minister.

558
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:31,892
Minister?

559
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:35,153
- What happened to the minister?
- Malachai.

560
01:09:37,733 --> 01:09:40,429
Outlander!

561
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,829
Outlander!

562
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:47,608
You, overthere.
He's coming.

563
01:09:48,043 --> 01:09:49,806
You, overthere.

564
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:51,808
Outlander!

565
01:09:55,084 --> 01:09:57,075
Outlander!

566
01:09:57,386 --> 01:10:00,913
We have your woman.
She still lives.

567
01:10:02,725 --> 01:10:05,922
Outlander!
Maybe you don't hear so well.

568
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:13,400
Her blood will spill
unless you give yourself up.

569
01:10:13,636 --> 01:10:16,503
We won't wait much longer.

570
01:10:17,072 --> 01:10:20,337
The night is coming.
Night is His time.

571
01:10:20,809 --> 01:10:23,539
Outlander!
Come on!

572
01:10:23,812 --> 01:10:26,610
Come on, outlander!

573
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:38,718
Are you looking forthat lady?

574
01:10:39,061 --> 01:10:41,757
- Yes, you know where she is?
- They took her out to the clearing.

575
01:10:41,997 --> 01:10:44,397
- What clearing? Where?
- In the corn field.

576
01:10:44,967 --> 01:10:48,027
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

577
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,101
I followed them,
just like I followed you.

578
01:10:50,339 --> 01:10:51,363
Show me.

579
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:55,571
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

580
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:57,244
Okay.

581
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:02,748
Quiet.

582
01:11:06,689 --> 01:11:07,656
Come on.

583
01:11:09,825 --> 01:11:11,486
Follow me to the barn.

584
01:11:12,928 --> 01:11:14,190
Careful.

585
01:11:27,242 --> 01:11:29,870
I'm ready to celebrate
my birthday.

586
01:11:30,145 --> 01:11:32,170
Malachai!
He will not forgive you.

587
01:11:32,481 --> 01:11:36,212
None of you will be forgiven.
All of you shall feel His wrath!

588
01:11:36,518 --> 01:11:38,918
We have a surprise foryou,
Amos.

589
01:11:39,455 --> 01:11:43,152
Isaac is gonna keep you company.

590
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:47,584
I am the word
and the giver of His laws.

591
01:11:47,963 --> 01:11:49,624
This is the end!

592
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,818
Come on.

593
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:25,525
Over here.

594
01:12:28,203 --> 01:12:30,137
You can see evetything from here.

595
01:12:39,014 --> 01:12:40,276
Okay, you two...

596
01:12:41,617 --> 01:12:43,551
you stay here and wait for me.
All right?

597
01:12:43,752 --> 01:12:45,720
But if anything happens to me...

598
01:12:45,988 --> 01:12:48,752
you get to Hemingford
as fast as you can.

599
01:12:49,057 --> 01:12:52,151
You get on that road
and don't get off it. Understand?

600
01:13:01,103 --> 01:13:03,367
Go past the irrigation pump.

601
01:13:41,944 --> 01:13:43,377
It's Him.

602
01:13:45,914 --> 01:13:47,711
He's come for me.

603
01:13:49,918 --> 01:13:51,146
He's come for me.

604
01:13:54,256 --> 01:13:56,121
He's come to welcome me.

605
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,734
I'm here, Lord.

606
01:14:08,604 --> 01:14:11,539
I'm here, Lord.

607
01:14:12,674 --> 01:14:14,574
I'm ready.

608
01:14:15,511 --> 01:14:17,411
Take me now, Lord.

609
01:14:19,781 --> 01:14:23,308
Your will, Lord.
My passage.

610
01:14:40,469 --> 01:14:44,371
I did it right.
I swear it.

611
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:48,104
I swear it.

612
01:14:50,646 --> 01:14:52,739
I did evetything You wanted!

613
01:14:57,452 --> 01:15:00,148
No! No!

614
01:15:05,294 --> 01:15:08,559
Stop!

615
01:15:20,175 --> 01:15:21,904
Vicky, come on,
run to the barn!

616
01:15:25,948 --> 01:15:28,348
He hit Malachai!

617
01:15:30,252 --> 01:15:33,244
- Seize him.
- Take that.

618
01:15:34,022 --> 01:15:35,819
Vicky, get out of here!

619
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:38,191
Was it like that with your
parents? Was it?

620
01:15:41,129 --> 01:15:43,723
Just because some suck
proclaims himself a holy man...

621
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,967
and says God commands?

622
01:15:47,035 --> 01:15:50,994
What kind of God tells children
to kill their parents?

623
01:15:51,273 --> 01:15:52,740
Answer me that, buddy.

624
01:15:53,442 --> 01:15:56,275
Did you hearthat
before Isaac? Did you?

625
01:15:58,413 --> 01:16:00,142
I can't believe
you're this blind.

626
01:16:03,151 --> 01:16:05,449
Maybe you've been listening
to this holy roller so long...

627
01:16:06,955 --> 01:16:10,220
that all starts to sound the same.
But it's not!

628
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:16,229
Any religion without love
and compassion is false.

629
01:16:17,232 --> 01:16:18,665
It's a lie!

630
01:16:58,407 --> 01:16:59,965
Is he dead?

631
01:17:04,179 --> 01:17:05,806
Is this what you want?

632
01:17:07,549 --> 01:17:09,039
Is it what He commands?

633
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:21,053
I don't think so.

634
01:17:21,797 --> 01:17:23,230
Get him!

635
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:25,832
Stop him!

636
01:17:26,702 --> 01:17:28,192
Kill him!

637
01:17:29,304 --> 01:17:31,704
Malachai!

638
01:17:37,846 --> 01:17:41,714
He wants you too, Malachai.

639
01:17:46,188 --> 01:17:48,884
He wants you too.

640
01:18:27,028 --> 01:18:30,259
- Vicky?
- Burt? Over here!

641
01:18:31,266 --> 01:18:33,097
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

642
01:18:37,472 --> 01:18:39,497
Get down.

643
01:18:39,975 --> 01:18:42,000
Get some help and get
those doors closed. Quick.

644
01:18:43,111 --> 01:18:44,578
Rudolf, Robert, come on!

645
01:18:44,813 --> 01:18:46,940
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

646
01:18:47,449 --> 01:18:49,212
If I knew what it was,
I could tell you.

647
01:18:49,484 --> 01:18:51,918
It's He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

648
01:18:52,254 --> 01:18:54,814
What if we tried to make it
to the road?

649
01:18:55,357 --> 01:18:57,348
I think we're safer here,
for now.

650
01:19:02,464 --> 01:19:05,456
Has anybody evertried
to hurt the monster?

651
01:19:05,767 --> 01:19:07,928
Any of the adults, your parents
before they were killed?

652
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:09,432
The Blue Man!

653
01:19:09,638 --> 01:19:11,401
Who is the Blue Man?
What did he do?

654
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,574
Officer Hodgekiss.
I told you.

655
01:19:13,809 --> 01:19:16,539
He came down here
after he talked to the minister.

656
01:19:16,845 --> 01:19:19,109
He was reading a page
torn out from the Bible...

657
01:19:19,481 --> 01:19:21,949
and it was working
with distil.

658
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:26,319
What was he reading
at the Bible?

659
01:19:26,488 --> 01:19:27,978
What was it?
Do you know?

660
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:33,788
You have it?
Hurty up. Where is it?

661
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:36,720
"And the devil
that deceived them...

662
01:19:36,932 --> 01:19:39,400
was cast into the lake of fire
and sulphur.

663
01:19:39,868 --> 01:19:43,099
Where the beast and the false
prophet shall be tormented...

664
01:19:43,338 --> 01:19:46,034
day and night,
for ever and ever."

665
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:47,731
What's that supposed to mean?

666
01:19:53,381 --> 01:19:56,714
What was the Blue Man
doing at the distil?

667
01:19:56,985 --> 01:20:00,011
He hooked the hose
and he was ttying to roll it out.

668
01:20:00,388 --> 01:20:03,152
- What stopped him?
- Malachai.

669
01:20:03,525 --> 01:20:06,892
Lake of fire. Fire!
He was gonna burn the field.

670
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:10,926
Oh, yes.
The alcohol from the distil.

671
01:20:11,132 --> 01:20:13,327
- How?
- Never mind, never mind.

672
01:20:13,902 --> 01:20:16,234
Kids, you bring me as many hoses
as you can find. Quick!

673
01:20:17,672 --> 01:20:20,140
Jobie and Sarah. Find me a bottle.
Aglass bottle.

674
01:20:20,342 --> 01:20:22,037
Quick!
Move!

675
01:20:23,411 --> 01:20:24,742
Vicky, come here!

676
01:20:31,286 --> 01:20:32,844
Over here!

677
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,813
It doesn't fit.

678
01:20:36,224 --> 01:20:38,089
There's gotta be a connector
here somewhere.

679
01:20:39,327 --> 01:20:41,352
Tty this.

680
01:20:54,142 --> 01:20:56,076
Get somebody
to hold this on tight.

681
01:20:57,045 --> 01:21:00,606
- Okay.
- Hang on to it. You got one. Good!

682
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:06,750
Vicky, see if you can find me
a thick rag.

683
01:21:07,222 --> 01:21:08,951
Jobie, come here.

684
01:21:10,659 --> 01:21:12,183
Hey, this is not a rag.

685
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:21,600
Get them to hold on that tight.

686
01:21:22,938 --> 01:21:24,371
Open it up when I get there.
All right?

687
01:21:24,506 --> 01:21:25,768
All right.

688
01:21:27,108 --> 01:21:28,439
Be careful.

689
01:21:29,744 --> 01:21:31,439
I love you, Vicky.

690
01:22:30,839 --> 01:22:32,306
What are you doing here?

691
01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:34,633
Get back to the barn.
Hurty up!

692
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:36,065
Go on!

693
01:22:36,478 --> 01:22:37,911
Move! Now!

694
01:22:43,718 --> 01:22:45,151
Excuse me!

695
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,273
Get that valve. Quick.

696
01:23:19,454 --> 01:23:22,014
Do you know howto run
this thing?

697
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:24,019
- Crank it!
- What?

698
01:23:24,225 --> 01:23:26,022
Crank it.

699
01:23:34,936 --> 01:23:37,063
Push the button at the top.

700
01:23:38,106 --> 01:23:39,368
Now!

701
01:24:21,449 --> 01:24:24,384
- Get the bottle!
- Okay!

702
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,699
Jobie!

703
01:24:41,402 --> 01:24:43,131
Come back here!

704
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:55,106
Jobie!

705
01:25:02,857 --> 01:25:05,621
Run, come on, run!

706
01:25:05,827 --> 01:25:09,058
- Jobie!
- Here's the bottle!

707
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:15,194
Throw it!
It's the right time!

708
01:25:15,503 --> 01:25:17,164
Throw it!
Throw it!

709
01:25:37,358 --> 01:25:38,518
Burt!

710
01:25:44,432 --> 01:25:45,194
Jobie!

711
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,195
Burt!

712
01:25:47,735 --> 01:25:49,566
Jobie!

713
01:25:50,972 --> 01:25:52,462
- Vicky!
- Sarah!

714
01:25:54,576 --> 01:25:56,976
Jobie!
Jobie!

715
01:26:03,618 --> 01:26:04,846
Look!

716
01:26:19,267 --> 01:26:20,859
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

717
01:26:34,082 --> 01:26:37,176
- Is he dead?
- I think so.

718
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:40,048
Then why are we still running?

719
01:26:40,255 --> 01:26:43,281
- Just keep going!
- Where did you get this guy?

720
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:15,487
Hemingford is 19 miles
right?

721
01:27:15,923 --> 01:27:20,053
- We'll walk?
- Sure.

722
01:27:21,429 --> 01:27:23,226
Are you sure
you're strong enough?

723
01:27:23,931 --> 01:27:28,561
I'm okay. And you?
Are you okay?

724
01:27:28,736 --> 01:27:31,466
I'll make it.
I got a great doctor.

725
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:43,615
Jealous?

726
01:27:44,752 --> 01:27:47,118
So what do we do with these
two little kids?

727
01:27:47,855 --> 01:27:49,186
I don't know.

728
01:27:49,457 --> 01:27:51,482
You guys wanna stay with us
for a couple of days?

729
01:27:53,494 --> 01:27:55,018
How about a week?

730
01:27:56,764 --> 01:27:58,595
Okay.

731
01:27:59,067 --> 01:28:00,830
- How about a month?
- No.

732
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:05,904
All right. All right.
I'll grab the map.

733
01:28:06,674 --> 01:28:10,110
- Interloper! No!
- God!

734
01:28:16,184 --> 01:28:17,515
You must die!

735
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:23,214
Oh, boy!

736
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:33,790
She's out cold.

737
01:28:34,802 --> 01:28:36,565
What are we gonna do now?

738
01:28:36,938 --> 01:28:40,396
Send her a card from Seattle.
Let's get out of here.

739
