1
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,907
It was about 3 years ago. I was
the only kid in church that day.

2
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,143
The others were with Isaac
out at the cornfield.

3
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,855
I didn't get to go
'cause dad didn't like Isaac.

4
00:01:31,186 --> 00:01:33,455
He was pretty smart, my dad.

5
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:37,608
After church we've been
to Hansen's, just like always.

6
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:41,832
Sarah was homesick with mom.
She'd turned down with a fever.

7
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,117
- Morning, Dave.
- Morning.

8
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,612
- How are your wife and Sarah?
- Dad was worried...

9
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:51,726
so he went to call mom
first thing.

10
00:01:52,303 --> 00:01:54,823
- I'm gonna call your mom, ok?
- Okay!

11
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:02,759
- You want the usual?
- Yeah, strawberty shake.

12
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:05,513
That's when I saw Malachai
and the others.

13
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:08,555
I guess the meeting with Isaac
was over.

14
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:14,181
They were acting real creepy.

15
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:18,823
- There you go, Jobie.
- Thanks.

16
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:34,211
- How is she?
- I'm worried, Dave.

17
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:38,113
The fever's gone
from 101 to 104.

18
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:44,226
Sure.

19
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,603
Okay.

20
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,387
Good coffee.

21
00:03:42,113 --> 00:03:43,455
Oh, my God!

22
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:10,453
No!

23
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,995
It happened everywhere
in Gatlin that day.

24
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:42,960
That's when Sarah started
drawing these pictures.

25
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,635
Happy birthday!

26
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:58,045
What are you doing?

27
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:04,255
C'mon!
Make a wish.

28
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,611
What did you wish for?

29
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:22,785
To live happily ever after.

30
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:29,469
- Is that a proposal?
- No, it's not.

31
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:35,388
Well, I guess I'll
give you this anyway.

32
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,807
What is it?

33
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:52,947
- That's nice!
- Turn it over.

34
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:07,218
In honor of this special occasion
we'll have a birthday serenade.

35
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,953
1, 2.
1, 2, 3, 4.

36
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,829
No more books and studies

37
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:19,091
Now I can stay all day
With my buddies

38
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:24,211
I can do the things I wanna do
'Cause all my exams are through

39
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:28,084
I can root for the Yankees
From the beaches

40
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:31,161
And don't have to worry
About teachers

41
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,318
And I'm so glad
That school is out

42
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:36,854
I could sing and shout

43
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:40,598
School is out
Everybody's gonna have some fun

44
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:43,573
Everybody's gonna jump and run

45
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:46,678
C'mon, people
Don't you be late

46
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,782
I just got time
To take my girl out today

47
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,429
You're whacko.

48
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:59,595
Holy cow!

49
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:07,627
We better get going now.
I got a lot of driving to do today.

50
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,474
Couldn't wejust say
the hell with it...

51
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:13,422
- and stay for a couple of hours?
- I wish.

52
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:17,648
Starting Monday I've got
fifty patients a day to look at

53
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:21,969
- I've some things you could look at.
- Is that right?

54
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,366
Hello?

55
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:30,863
Hello?
Maid service.

56
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,292
We'll be out in a minute.

57
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:36,298
We gotta get going.

58
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:39,374
I'm gonna grab a quick shower
before we go, okay?

59
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:58,443
C'mon, honey! You're making
something out of nothing.

60
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:01,351
To me is something,
to you is nothing.

61
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:04,260
I'm just worried about this
internship, okay?

62
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:06,539
I've been working forthis
forfouryears.

63
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:08,422
I know.

64
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:12,003
I do understand.

65
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:16,864
Why do you have to be
such ajerk about it?

66
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:25,801
Welcome to Nebraska.

67
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:55,808
We weren't the only ones
who thought Isaac was weird.

68
00:10:56,742 --> 00:10:58,945
One day Joseph told us
he was running away.

69
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:01,372
He said he couldn't
take it anymore.

70
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:04,068
He was pretty scared.
I wasn't.

71
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:06,528
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

72
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,347
There's nothing to be afraid of.

73
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:10,784
I said I'd come back foryou.
I promise.

74
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:13,248
- Can we go with you? Please!
- No.

75
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,133
I'd never make it with you two.

76
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:18,275
- But we don't like it here.
- I said you'll be alright!

77
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:20,798
As long as nobody finds
that pictures you've been drawing.

78
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:22,488
She can't help it.

79
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:24,991
That won't matter
to Isaac and Malachai

80
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:26,746
They'll take it as a sign.

81
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,083
Anyway, you now crayons
and drawings are forbidden.

82
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,031
- Just like that record player.
- But we like it.

83
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,231
Isaac doesn't let us do anything.

84
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:36,798
Youjust better mind
until I get back.

85
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:39,674
Or else, you know what happens.

86
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:46,616
- Are you going through the corn?
- I can't go no other way.

87
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:49,113
- What if...
- I said it'll be alright.

88
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,985
- Unless you tell anybody I'm gone.
- We won't.

89
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:57,655
Cross your heat? Hope to die,
stick a needle in your eye.

90
00:11:58,142 --> 00:11:59,898
You know what that means now?

91
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:03,224
If you tell, you're gonna burn in
a lake of fire for all eternity.

92
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:05,431
Make sure nobody's looking.

93
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:15,223
- Okay. Go!
- Nobody's looking.

94
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,233
I spy...

95
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,492
something that begins
with the letter "C".

96
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:07,054
- Corn.
- Right.

97
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:09,396
So now we know...

98
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:12,690
back roads are even less
interesting than the highways.

99
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:16,623
Maybe they've discovered music...

100
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:20,393
Hallelujah!
There are many Lord's mansions...

101
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:25,165
but there's no room
for the fornicator!

102
00:13:25,426 --> 00:13:27,913
- No room!
- No room...

103
00:13:28,146 --> 00:13:30,895
- for the homosexual!
- No room!

104
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:34,827
No room
for the drugs user!

105
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:36,486
No room!

106
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,694
Amen.
Peanut butter and white bread!

107
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,927
There's no room
forthe college graduated!

108
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:44,777
No room for people
who watch public television.

109
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:47,463
- No room for commitments!
- Amen!

110
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:51,944
C'mon!

111
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:56,479
Here it is.

112
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:03,327
- I wonder how it got here.
- Not me.

113
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:12,762
It looks like this one
goes to Grand Island...

114
00:15:13,476 --> 00:15:14,937
and this one
cuts up to the highway.

115
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:21,537
Where's this Gatlin that we've
been seeing the signs for?

116
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:26,487
- It's not on here.
- How come? It's gotta be.

117
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,599
Look out!

118
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:42,199
Hang on.
Let me check.

119
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,643
Let me check.

120
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:47,222
- Where? Right there?
- Yeah.

121
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:51,835
It was just a bump.
Just tty to relax.

122
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:56,629
That was an animal, right?

123
00:15:57,853 --> 00:16:00,984
I gotta go back there, okay
Just stay here and tty to rest.

124
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,724
C'mon, buddy.

125
00:16:18,587 --> 00:16:20,048
Oh God!

126
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:28,115
- Is he...
- Oh yeah.

127
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:40,269
- Oh God!
- Easy, easy. C'mon.

128
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,803
Easy.
Don't look at him.

129
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:52,429
Now listen to me.
There's something vety wrong here.

130
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:55,566
So I want you to go back to the car
and wait for me there. Understand?

131
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:58,415
- And keep the doors locked.
- Why? Where are you going?

132
00:16:58,646 --> 00:17:01,034
I'll tell you when I get back.
Just do what I say.

133
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:09,372
Burt.

134
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:21,793
Burt.

135
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,585
Burt.

136
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:38,814
Burt.

137
00:19:58,462 --> 00:19:59,836
I'm so sorty.

138
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:05,082
- Vicky, c'mon.
- Burt!

139
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:08,530
- Easy. Calm down.
- I kneeled down next to him.

140
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:13,171
It's ok. Take it easy.
Take it easy and relax.

141
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:19,796
It's okay, understand?
You're okay.

142
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:09,903
Me and Sarah were playing in our
old house. We play there lots.

143
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:12,333
Malachai said it was forbidden.

144
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:15,858
But I think that's because nobody
ever asked him to play.

145
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:21,515
When I grow up, I'm gonna have
all the money in the world.

146
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:24,111
- Me too.
- You can't.

147
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:27,019
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm gonna have it.

148
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,352
- I'll get it first.
- Will not.

149
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:30,991
- Will too.
- Will not.

150
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:33,934
- Will too.
- Oh yeah? How?

151
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,900
Seven.

152
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:52,870
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

153
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,751
seven.

154
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,250
Alright! See?
Two hundred dollars.

155
00:21:58,477 --> 00:22:00,364
No, Jobie!

156
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:07,938
How much?

157
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:13,152
- Thirteen thousand hundred dollars.
- Thirteen thousand hundred dollars?

158
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:16,425
Okay, two thousand.

159
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:18,400
I thought so.

160
00:22:20,746 --> 00:22:24,488
One hundred, two hundred, three...
I gotta a great idea.

161
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:29,728
Let's pretend this guy is Isaac
and we'll put him injail.

162
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:33,250
What if he gets to get out
ofjail with a free card?

163
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:37,534
What card?

164
00:22:56,486 --> 00:22:59,868
You think it might've been some
accident with farm equipment?

165
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:02,139
Not like that.

166
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:05,921
His throat was cut deliberately.

167
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:10,490
He was already dead
when he stumbled down the road.

168
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:13,692
Whoever killed him,
do you think he saw us?

169
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,945
- I felt like we're being watched.
- Possible.

170
00:23:19,394 --> 00:23:21,849
Blood starts to coagulate
in four minutes.

171
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:24,956
When I went to get the suitcase
it was still fresh.

172
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:29,047
- He could have been out there!
- I couldn'tjust leave it there.

173
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,580
What if it holds
some sort of clue?

174
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:36,794
- Let's open it.
- No.

175
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:40,031
Let's just get to a phone
or a house or some place.

176
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:45,814
Malachai took us
right to Isaac.

177
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,655
He'd finally convinced him
punishing us for being unbelievers.

178
00:23:49,982 --> 00:23:52,600
Up to them, we've been forgiven
'cause we were in the corn...

179
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:55,643
the day that "He Who Walks Behind
the Rows" made himself known.

180
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:59,673
That bothered Malachai.
He had a lot of problems.

181
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,132
I found these two
in one of the old homes...

182
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,823
they had a game, music...

183
00:24:15,674 --> 00:24:17,168
and this.

184
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:22,393
They come already.

185
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:31,377
You have the gift of sight.

186
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:35,988
- This is a blessing, my child.
- I've seen this car up on the road.

187
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:40,460
Go to the old man.
Make sure he tells them nothing.

188
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,766
What about these two?

189
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,844
Take them back
where they were.

190
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,786
But they had a game and music.
They're forbidden.

191
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:57,137
Question me not, Malachai.
I act according to His will.

192
00:25:14,003 --> 00:25:17,483
It seems we are in the Moon.
We haven't even seen a truck.

193
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,472
We'll be in Gatlin soon.

194
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:23,850
Do you think he lived there?

195
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:27,150
We may never knowthat.

196
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:30,924
I really thing we should open it.

197
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,150
Okay.

198
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:44,551
Let's see if we can get
some news.

199
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:51,622
I'm getting tired of that crap.

200
00:25:58,381 --> 00:25:59,809
What is it?

201
00:26:04,172 --> 00:26:06,954
- Jesus Christ!
- Not in my Book.

202
00:26:08,556 --> 00:26:12,384
- It looks like primitive folk art.
- I think it's repulsive.

203
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,223
Sarge, bring the number six.

204
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,958
Damn it!
You better give me the eight.

205
00:26:33,128 --> 00:26:35,811
C'mon.
We haven't got all day.

206
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,645
Good boy.

207
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:47,460
We'll have that transmission fixed
in no time...

208
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:50,207
then, we'll get on the radiator.

209
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:54,841
Damn. This road is becoming
a bloody highway.

210
00:26:55,301 --> 00:26:57,918
I think it's the third car
in a month.

211
00:26:58,661 --> 00:27:00,765
We know what to do, don't we?

212
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:11,772
We better put that suitcase away.

213
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:17,185
I'll be right back.

214
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:24,764
- Hi, we got a...
- I ain't got no gas.

215
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:27,608
- I don't need gas.
- I ain't got no diesel.

216
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:30,622
- You don't understand. I need...
- lf you don't buy gas...

217
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,767
you can't use the rest room.

218
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,759
- I need to use your phone.
- Telephone?

219
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,032
I ain't got no telephone.
Sarge.

220
00:27:42,942 --> 00:27:45,047
Sarge, you be still.

221
00:27:50,814 --> 00:27:57,621
You have to go to Hemingford.
It's about 19 miles down there.

222
00:27:57,852 --> 00:28:00,787
- What about Gatlin?
- There ain't nothing in Gatlin.

223
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:06,619
What do you mean:
"There ain't nothing in Gatlin."?

224
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:09,721
Folks in Gatlin got religious.
They don't like outsiders...

225
00:28:09,947 --> 00:28:12,281
and they probably won't have
a phone there either.

226
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:17,397
I'd like to stay here and talk,
but I got a transmission to fix.

227
00:28:17,594 --> 00:28:21,587
If you get on that road
you'll be in Hemingford in no time.

228
00:28:21,882 --> 00:28:26,289
- Right.
- Sarge, sit! At ease!

229
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,167
Thanks a lot.

230
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,258
Sarge!

231
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,447
Eitherthat man is senile, or he's
being out in the Sun fortoo long.

232
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:43,341
Sarge!
Come back here.

233
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,042
Sarge!
Come back here!

234
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:52,494
Under the awning!

235
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:56,361
You hear me?
Come back here.

236
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:58,130
That's an order.

237
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:09,359
Who is it?
Is that you?

238
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,395
What do you want?

239
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:31,238
What are you doing there?

240
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:51,305
Well, there really isn't that much
stuff in here. Just kids' stuff.

241
00:29:51,597 --> 00:29:55,077
Clothes, matches,
compass, pocket knife.

242
00:29:55,404 --> 00:29:58,055
- I don't get it. Camping stuff?
- Yeah.

243
00:29:59,724 --> 00:30:02,790
Oh, great!
This must be our day.

244
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:06,146
In the last sign we saw
Gatlin was 3 miles...

245
00:30:06,412 --> 00:30:08,583
- and pointed that way?
- That's what I thought.

246
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:12,936
- Did I miss a turn?
- No, we've been going straight.

247
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:16,319
Somebody's been
messing with the signs.

248
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,359
Hemingford is gotta be
straight ahead.

249
00:30:27,944 --> 00:30:29,471
Must have been the wind.

250
00:30:57,381 --> 00:31:01,635
These latches ain't worth a damn.
Blow all for nothing.

251
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:17,278
I nevertold them nothing.
I swear it.

252
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:19,740
I kept our bargain
just like always.

253
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,119
Jesus Christ! Gatlin! What do they
have? Amonopoly on road signs?

254
00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:31,001
What about Hemingford?

255
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,883
For people who don't like visitors
they sure do advertise enough.

256
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:40,061
Overthere.

257
00:31:43,998 --> 00:31:45,907
Of course, it's the wind.

258
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:17,937
Why did you have to go
afterthem, Sarge?

259
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:32,881
You bastards!
You can't do this to me.

260
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,777
I know you're in here.

261
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,202
C'mon! C'mon!

262
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:26,091
I can smell you, you stinky
little skunks.

263
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:28,136
C'mon!

264
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:38,086
Murderers little devils!

265
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,415
C'mon!

266
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:08,327
- What was that?
- Probably my golf bag.

267
00:34:09,226 --> 00:34:11,266
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean: "Am I sure."?

268
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:37,248
This isn't even a road.

269
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,941
- We'll never gotta get out of here.
- We'll too. Stop it.

270
00:34:43,942 --> 00:34:44,836
Sorty.

271
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,568
- Just tell me where we are.
- I don't know.

272
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:04,768
We're back where we started from.

273
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:07,547
We never should have listen
to that old fool.

274
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:12,025
Hemingford is 19 miles,
Gatlin is only 3.

275
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:14,779
I don't care how much religious
they've got. We're going there.

276
00:35:15,938 --> 00:35:18,304
Don't ever show up
in my emergency room, buddy.

277
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:38,011
Behold.

278
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:44,405
Adream did come to me in the
night. And the Lord show all to me.

279
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:47,581
Praise God!
Praise the Lord.

280
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:50,422
Atime of tribulation has come.

281
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:53,428
Atest is at hand.

282
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:58,036
- The final test.
- What has the Lord commanded?

283
00:35:58,652 --> 00:35:59,666
In the dream...

284
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:03,480
the Lord did come to me
and he was a shape.

285
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:06,808
It was He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

286
00:36:07,419 --> 00:36:10,168
And I did fall on my knees
in terror and hide my eyes...

287
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:13,808
unless the fierceness of His face
struck me dead.

288
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:17,075
He told me all
that it since happened.

289
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:22,578
He said:"Joseph has taken his
things and fled this happy place...

290
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:26,766
because the worship of me
is no more upon him...

291
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:31,501
so take you his life
and spill his blood".

292
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,100
- He did?
- Yes.

293
00:36:34,455 --> 00:36:37,302
"But let not the flesh
pollute the corn.

294
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,437
- Cast him instead upon the road."
- And so was done.

295
00:36:40,694 --> 00:36:42,963
Joseph, the betrayer,
was cast out.

296
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:46,195
And He Who Walks
Behind the Rows did say...

297
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:49,715
"I will send outlanders
amongst you.

298
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:53,865
Aman and a woman.
And these outlanders...

299
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:57,134
will be unbelievers
and profaners of the holy".

300
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,755
- I thought Isaac never came here.
- But he's always been here.

301
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:03,345
Just like He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

302
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:05,872
"And the man shall
sorely test you...

303
00:37:06,227 --> 00:37:10,733
for He has great power. Even
greaterthan that of the blue man.

304
00:37:11,186 --> 00:37:14,219
The blue man!
Yes, the blue man!

305
00:37:15,122 --> 00:37:18,024
And just as the blue man
was offered upon to Him...

306
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:22,990
- so shall be the unbelievers!
- Make sacrifice unto Him.

307
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:25,933
Bring the blood
of the outlanders.

308
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:28,201
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

309
00:37:28,432 --> 00:37:31,049
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

310
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:33,580
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

311
00:37:33,871 --> 00:37:36,259
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

312
00:37:36,494 --> 00:37:39,309
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

313
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:41,061
Let's get out of here!

314
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,818
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

315
00:37:44,046 --> 00:37:46,533
Praise God!
Praise The Lord!

316
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:23,331
It looks like a swinging place.

317
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,968
I guess nobody told them
we were coming.

318
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:42,015
I hope not.

319
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:45,729
I don't see anybody.

320
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:55,714
Town Hall.

321
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:59,298
Grocety store. Hansen's Cafe.
It seems they got a phone.

322
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:02,656
Unless a ghost is using it.

323
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,844
- What is it with this corn?
- You got me.

324
00:39:55,004 --> 00:39:58,200
Is dead.
Just like evetything else here.

325
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:05,681
- A rat.
- Yeah. Just an ordinaty rat.

326
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,043
Now can we
get out of here, please?

327
00:40:12,282 --> 00:40:14,224
Wait a minute!
Come back here!

328
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,948
C'mon, Vicky. Hurty up.
I don't wanna lose them.

329
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:32,112
What are you gonna do
if you catch them?

330
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:34,414
Ask where we can get help.
What else?

331
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,879
They just got off that way.

332
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:42,350
Damn!
Where did they go?

333
00:40:43,862 --> 00:40:47,920
We're already in the car. Why
wouldn't wejust go to Hemingford?

334
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,602
- That would take us 20 minutes.
- We'd just found people.

335
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:53,324
Yeah, three kids
that tried to steal our car.

336
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,292
There's something
vety strange about this town.

337
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:05,743
We'd be better off
in a biggertown anyway.

338
00:41:06,418 --> 00:41:08,971
- The size of Seattle.
- Yeah.

339
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,975
- Overthere!
- What?

340
00:41:21,297 --> 00:41:25,006
- I just saw a door open and close.
- I didn't see anything.

341
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:29,772
- Let's check it out.
- Why? I thought we were going.

342
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,764
- Settle down.
- Don't patronize me.

343
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:36,006
I'm not patronizing you. I just
wanna see if there's someone there.

344
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:45,954
Hello?

345
00:41:52,492 --> 00:41:53,702
Hello?

346
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:58,757
Anybody home?

347
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:04,098
We've had an accident.
We need to use your phone.

348
00:42:05,963 --> 00:42:08,483
Okay.
Now can we go?

349
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:17,829
- Burt, this is somebody's house.
- I know. I just want a phone.

350
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:20,097
Hello?

351
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:48,961
Gross.

352
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:52,738
I'll check out the back.

353
00:43:05,827 --> 00:43:07,714
I found the phone.

354
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:13,591
Matches the decor.
This is three years old.

355
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:20,601
I don't understand
what's going on here.

356
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,029
Well, can we go?

357
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:32,406
Burt!

358
00:43:50,685 --> 00:43:51,993
Hello?

359
00:44:00,794 --> 00:44:02,288
Anybody here?

360
00:45:20,656 --> 00:45:24,071
Don't be afraid.
We didn't mean to scare you.

361
00:45:25,104 --> 00:45:26,762
Hi!

362
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:32,173
- What's your name?
- Sarah.

363
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:35,180
Sarah!
That's a beautiful name.

364
00:45:36,174 --> 00:45:39,752
- This is Burt and I'm Vicky.
- Are you here alone, Sarah?

365
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:43,939
Do you live here?

366
00:45:45,613 --> 00:45:48,068
Youjust come here to play?

367
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,184
- Are your mommy and daddy around?
- They're in the corn field.

368
00:45:55,916 --> 00:45:59,395
- What are they doing there?
- All the grown ups are there.

369
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:03,113
Are they working there
or having a meeting?

370
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:06,981
No. Isaac put them there.

371
00:46:07,657 --> 00:46:09,151
Who's Isaac?

372
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:15,421
- Sweetheart, tell us who Isaac is.
- Our leader.

373
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:17,252
Leader of what?

374
00:46:18,728 --> 00:46:20,484
Evetybody.

375
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,388
Of course.

376
00:46:27,591 --> 00:46:30,209
Listen,
could you take us to Isaac?

377
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,499
- Why not?
- He's scaty.

378
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:39,132
It's vety important we speak to
some grown ups as soon as possible.

379
00:46:39,493 --> 00:46:42,460
- We're wasting ourtime, Vicky.
- Give her a chance.

380
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:45,089
I'm gonna go look
at the Town Hall.

381
00:46:45,477 --> 00:46:47,265
Why?

382
00:46:48,484 --> 00:46:50,109
Because we have a murder
to report...

383
00:46:50,372 --> 00:46:52,925
and we're walking in circles,
wasting ourtime.

384
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:56,574
- Maybe she can help.
- Fine. You stay here with her.

385
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,912
Things aren't happening fast.

386
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,759
I'm gonna leave you the car.

387
00:47:05,058 --> 00:47:08,221
I won't be gone vety long.
If anybody comes, honk. Okay?

388
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:14,748
Are we safe?

389
00:47:15,968 --> 00:47:18,718
Yes. It's weird here,
but it's safe.

390
00:47:19,744 --> 00:47:21,150
I'll be back.

391
00:47:38,718 --> 00:47:41,335
So, it looks like it's just
you and me.

392
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:45,946
What were you doing here
by yourself? Just playing records?

393
00:47:49,052 --> 00:47:50,906
Come on, you can tell me.

394
00:47:53,116 --> 00:47:54,676
Drawing.

395
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:56,760
Drawing...

396
00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:00,314
- what's so secret about drawing?
- I'm not supposed to.

397
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:02,898
You're not supposed to draw?

398
00:48:03,995 --> 00:48:08,150
- Who says? Isaac?
- Malachai.

399
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,484
Malachai?

400
00:48:11,897 --> 00:48:14,930
Why don't you draw me a picture
we won't tell Isaac...

401
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:16,983
or Malachai
or anybody?

402
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,031
- How's that sound?
- Okay.

403
00:51:29,822 --> 00:51:32,636
- How's it coming?
- Fine.

404
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:36,763
- What did you draw?
- You.

405
00:51:37,245 --> 00:51:39,798
You did?
Can I see?

406
00:51:49,371 --> 00:51:51,476
What is this?

407
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,714
Burt?

408
00:52:01,946 --> 00:52:03,669
Burt, is that you?

409
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:24,336
Burt, is that you?

410
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:28,399
Somebody here?

411
00:52:33,302 --> 00:52:34,895
Who are you?

412
00:52:36,149 --> 00:52:37,359
What do you want?

413
00:52:40,629 --> 00:52:43,116
We want to give you peace.

414
00:52:44,436 --> 00:52:46,410
Seize her.

415
00:52:46,932 --> 00:52:49,582
Come on! Get her!
Let's finish it!

416
00:52:59,731 --> 00:53:01,672
No!
No!

417
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:30,471
Burt!
Burt!

418
00:53:31,534 --> 00:53:35,014
Burt!
Burt!

419
00:53:37,485 --> 00:53:42,918
- Are we safe?
- Yes, it's weird here, but it's safe.

420
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:55,330
Help me!

421
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,891
Where are you taking me?

422
00:54:00,842 --> 00:54:02,271
Help!

423
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:05,061
Help!

424
00:54:18,407 --> 00:54:19,814
Vicky!

425
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,055
Sarah, what happened here?

426
00:54:29,255 --> 00:54:31,196
What happened?
Where's Vicky?

427
00:54:31,526 --> 00:54:33,119
You've gotta think.
Think.

428
00:54:33,509 --> 00:54:35,003
What happened to her?
Please!

429
00:54:39,461 --> 00:54:40,955
Does He speak to you, Isaac?

430
00:54:42,052 --> 00:54:45,980
He speaks to me always.
But today he's displeased.

431
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,409
He's displeased with you,
Malachai.

432
00:54:48,707 --> 00:54:50,976
What have I done?

433
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:53,697
Question Him not in vain.

434
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:56,793
Do you not know you sacrificed
Joseph without an offering?

435
00:54:57,154 --> 00:54:59,325
And did you not spill the blood
of the old man...

436
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:02,106
when his oil and gasoline
were still useful to us?

437
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:04,378
We have our own fuel now
from the corn.

438
00:55:04,673 --> 00:55:07,934
Sow not your pride, Malachai.
We have not enough.

439
00:55:10,369 --> 00:55:12,605
Maybe He's displeased
that we have not offered Him...

440
00:55:12,864 --> 00:55:16,125
- Sarah and Jobe.
- Sarah has the gift of sight.

441
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:19,293
She warned us of the coming
of the interlopers.

442
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,458
Question not my judgment,
Malachai.

443
00:55:23,231 --> 00:55:25,118
I am the giver of His word.

444
00:55:28,222 --> 00:55:29,978
Go you and bring me the husband.

445
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:32,985
We must offerthem tonight
when Amos leaves.

446
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:38,588
Sarah, come on.
Tell me what happened to her.

447
00:55:39,965 --> 00:55:42,899
Look at me!
Think!

448
00:55:43,036 --> 00:55:45,621
- What?
- Malachai.

449
00:55:46,203 --> 00:55:48,113
Who's Malachai?
What do you mean?

450
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:05,717
Vicky?

451
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,044
Vicky?

452
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:20,820
Vicky?

453
00:57:12,944 --> 00:57:15,726
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

454
00:57:15,952 --> 00:57:19,050
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

455
00:57:19,279 --> 00:57:22,312
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

456
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:24,582
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

457
00:57:24,782 --> 00:57:27,171
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

458
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:30,340
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

459
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:36,999
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

460
00:58:16,264 --> 00:58:18,914
Nowthe blood of Amos
will be shared.

461
00:58:20,135 --> 00:58:21,760
Stop it!
Stop that!

462
00:58:22,471 --> 00:58:23,899
Hold the outlander!

463
00:58:30,182 --> 00:58:31,742
What the hell is going on here?

464
00:58:33,285 --> 00:58:34,943
Are you crazy?
What do you think you're doing?

465
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,308
My passage.
It's my birthday.

466
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:39,679
You've got a pretty sick way
of celebrating it, pal.

467
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,198
Silence, interloper!

468
00:58:43,492 --> 00:58:47,070
Your presence profanes
this holy place.

469
00:58:47,427 --> 00:58:50,242
- He will wreck with you.
- Great. I don't know who He is.

470
00:58:50,467 --> 00:58:52,834
Maybe He'd like to discuss
what's going on here with me.

471
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,649
- It says it should be...
- Amos!

472
00:58:54,883 --> 00:58:57,086
- It says it is written.
- Speak no more to him!

473
00:58:57,346 --> 00:59:00,575
He is an unbeliever.
Hurty, get Isaac!

474
00:59:00,865 --> 00:59:05,567
No! Wait!
Bring Malachai.

475
00:59:10,337 --> 00:59:13,238
What do you mean: "As it's
written? "Written where?

476
00:59:18,591 --> 00:59:20,281
What? In this?

477
00:59:21,151 --> 00:59:23,868
Are you rewriting the whole thing
orthe parts that suit your needs?

478
00:59:31,677 --> 00:59:33,979
- Back off!
- Sit down!

479
00:59:36,253 --> 00:59:38,041
What do we have here?

480
00:59:38,781 --> 00:59:41,628
Nineteen, eighteen...
What is this?

481
00:59:42,076 --> 00:59:44,180
- These people died so young!
- Not died.

482
00:59:44,572 --> 00:59:47,605
We go to Him the first night
of our nineteenth year.

483
00:59:47,899 --> 00:59:48,979
Who the hell is Him?

484
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,967
He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

485
00:59:51,195 --> 00:59:52,624
Malachai comes!

486
00:59:55,355 --> 00:59:56,664
Seize him!

487
00:59:58,905 --> 01:00:00,466
Back off!

488
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:22,128
Seize him.
Do not let him escape.

489
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:35,090
Where is he?
Come on!

490
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:39,438
There he is. Go get him!
You! Go that way!

491
01:00:59,154 --> 01:01:02,023
I need your help!
Come on!

492
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,265
Come on, help me
Help me!

493
01:01:04,497 --> 01:01:07,147
Outlander!
He's here.

494
01:01:20,238 --> 01:01:22,409
- Got you.
- This isn't a game.

495
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:24,492
Back off!

496
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,675
Outlander!

497
01:01:34,093 --> 01:01:35,718
Go get him!

498
01:01:53,034 --> 01:01:54,212
Check the doors!
Check the doors!

499
01:02:00,649 --> 01:02:04,031
You guys go back to the alley.
You, overthere. You two follow me.

500
01:02:18,631 --> 01:02:19,940
Shit!

501
01:03:12,128 --> 01:03:13,240
Damn it!

502
01:03:33,629 --> 01:03:35,003
Hey, mister!

503
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:39,057
I know a place to hide.
But we gotta hurty.

504
01:03:39,388 --> 01:03:43,184
- Who are you?
- Jobe. Stop asking questions.

505
01:03:49,435 --> 01:03:50,482
Come on!

506
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:55,446
Will you come on?

507
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,156
Careful.

508
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,037
Don't be a scared cat.

509
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:18,413
- Come on. It's only me and Sarah.
- Sarah?

510
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:20,501
Yes, my sister.

511
01:04:24,246 --> 01:04:25,653
Isn't that nice?

512
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:26,924
My dad built it...

513
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:29,295
when the communists launched
theirfirst strike.

514
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:33,802
I don't think it's the communists
we have to worty about.

515
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:36,977
Don't worty.
Nobody knows about this place.

516
01:04:38,484 --> 01:04:39,760
It's secret.

517
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:42,185
- Those guys are friends of yours?
- No way!

518
01:04:42,964 --> 01:04:44,720
They listen to Isaac
and Malachai.

519
01:04:45,075 --> 01:04:48,817
- Who are Isaac and Malachai?
- Isaac started the whole thing.

520
01:04:49,331 --> 01:04:51,752
If he hadn't come,
this would never have happened.

521
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:53,806
When he was young,
he was a preacher...

522
01:04:54,002 --> 01:04:55,463
so evetybody believed him.

523
01:04:55,698 --> 01:04:57,553
They thought he had
a great spirit.

524
01:04:58,193 --> 01:04:59,916
I thought he was weird.

525
01:05:10,736 --> 01:05:12,775
We must sacrifice
them both tonight.

526
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:15,785
Amos will satisfy Him.
We need the woman.

527
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:18,055
- She'll bring the man to us.
- No.

528
01:05:18,286 --> 01:05:19,977
He must be taken
without her.

529
01:05:20,206 --> 01:05:22,540
We cannot remove her
from this place. It is holy.

530
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,546
We'll bring the Lord two
by using one.

531
01:05:25,774 --> 01:05:27,202
Do not blaspheme, Malachai.

532
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:30,252
You know not the laws.
He speaks them only to me.

533
01:05:30,477 --> 01:05:31,655
I think not, Isaac.

534
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:33,640
You are the one who's lost
favor with Him.

535
01:05:33,869 --> 01:05:36,650
He's a God of blood
and sacrifice, not ceremonies.

536
01:05:36,844 --> 01:05:39,593
Sacrilege!
Down on your knees, heretic!

537
01:05:39,788 --> 01:05:42,886
Shut your mouth, Isaac!
You've grown proud farfrom us.

538
01:05:45,323 --> 01:05:48,257
He Who Walks Behind The Rows
will decide yourfate.

539
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,908
Don't you sit there, seize him!
Punish him, cut him down.

540
01:05:52,106 --> 01:05:53,633
I command you!

541
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:56,037
I am the word and the giver
of His laws.

542
01:05:56,233 --> 01:05:58,437
Disobedience to me
is disobedience to Him.

543
01:05:58,794 --> 01:06:00,866
Do it now oryour punishment
will be a thousand times...

544
01:06:01,129 --> 01:06:04,063
a thousand deaths, each more
horrible than the last.

545
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:07,133
They're tired of yourtalk.
I've showed them what I can do.

546
01:06:07,432 --> 01:06:11,142
Cut the woman down.
Put Isaac in her place.

547
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,920
We'll see howthe Lord
favors you.

548
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:15,841
Dare not to blaspheme.

549
01:06:16,071 --> 01:06:18,111
He will punish you.
The God of hell will devouryou.

550
01:06:18,406 --> 01:06:19,715
All of you!

551
01:06:20,007 --> 01:06:24,414
No! No!
No! No!

552
01:06:24,934 --> 01:06:29,210
When my dad wouldn't get up
I ran from Hansen...

553
01:06:29,573 --> 01:06:31,809
to get Officer Hodgekiss.
But it was too late.

554
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:33,410
Why?
What happened to him?

555
01:06:33,637 --> 01:06:35,611
He got away at that time.

556
01:06:35,812 --> 01:06:38,365
He went to the barn
after he talked to the minister.

557
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:40,002
Minister?

558
01:06:40,227 --> 01:06:43,129
- What happened to the minister?
- Malachai.

559
01:06:45,603 --> 01:06:48,188
Outlander!

560
01:06:49,954 --> 01:06:51,448
Outlander!

561
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:55,072
You, overthere.
He's coming.

562
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:57,180
You, overthere.

563
01:06:57,442 --> 01:06:59,100
Outlander!

564
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:04,150
Outlander!

565
01:07:04,448 --> 01:07:07,831
We have your woman.
She still lives.

566
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:12,634
Outlander!
Maybe you don't hear so well.

567
01:07:16,063 --> 01:07:19,804
Her blood will spill
unless you give yourself up.

568
01:07:20,031 --> 01:07:22,780
We won't wait much longer.

569
01:07:23,326 --> 01:07:26,456
The night is coming.
Night is His time.

570
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:29,527
Outlander!
Come on!

571
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:32,472
Come on, outlander!

572
01:07:42,075 --> 01:07:44,082
Are you looking forthat lady?

573
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:46,996
- Yes, you know where she is?
- They took her out to the clearing.

574
01:07:47,226 --> 01:07:49,528
- What clearing? Where?
- In the corn field.

575
01:07:50,074 --> 01:07:53,009
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

576
01:07:53,242 --> 01:07:54,997
I followed them,
just like I followed you.

577
01:07:55,226 --> 01:07:56,208
Show me.

578
01:07:57,625 --> 01:08:00,243
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

579
01:08:00,473 --> 01:08:01,847
Okay.

580
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:07,125
Quiet.

581
01:08:10,904 --> 01:08:11,831
Come on.

582
01:08:13,911 --> 01:08:15,504
Follow me to the barn.

583
01:08:16,887 --> 01:08:18,097
Careful.

584
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:33,132
I'm ready to celebrate
my birthday.

585
01:08:33,396 --> 01:08:35,338
Malachai!
He will not forgive you.

586
01:08:35,636 --> 01:08:39,214
None of you will be forgiven.
All of you shall feel His wrath!

587
01:08:39,507 --> 01:08:41,809
We have a surprise foryou,
Amos.

588
01:08:42,324 --> 01:08:45,869
Isaac is gonna keep you company.

589
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:50,119
I am the word
and the giver of His laws.

590
01:08:50,482 --> 01:08:52,075
This is the end!

591
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:20,069
Come on.

592
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:26,501
Over here.

593
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:30,923
You can see evetything from here.

594
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:40,646
Okay, you two...

595
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:43,786
you stay here and wait for me.
All right?

596
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,866
But if anything happens to me...

597
01:09:46,123 --> 01:09:48,773
you get to Hemingford
as fast as you can.

598
01:09:49,066 --> 01:09:52,033
You get on that road
and don't get off it. Understand?

599
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:02,788
Go past the irrigation pump.

600
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,154
It's Him.

601
01:10:43,587 --> 01:10:45,310
He's come for me.

602
01:10:47,426 --> 01:10:48,604
He's come for me.

603
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:53,374
He's come to welcome me.

604
01:11:02,176 --> 01:11:04,510
I'm here, Lord.

605
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:08,159
I'm here, Lord.

606
01:11:09,247 --> 01:11:11,069
I'm ready.

607
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,789
Take me now, Lord.

608
01:11:16,062 --> 01:11:19,444
Your will, Lord.
My passage.

609
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:39,642
I did it right.
I swear it.

610
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:43,221
I swear it.

611
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:47,666
I did evetything You wanted!

612
01:11:52,185 --> 01:11:54,770
No! No!

613
01:11:59,705 --> 01:12:02,836
Stop!

614
01:12:13,975 --> 01:12:15,633
Vicky, come on,
run to the barn!

615
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:21,812
He hit Malachai!

616
01:12:23,638 --> 01:12:26,507
- Seize him.
- Take that.

617
01:12:27,253 --> 01:12:28,976
Vicky, get out of here!

618
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,250
Was it like that with your
parents? Was it?

619
01:12:34,068 --> 01:12:36,555
Just because some suck
proclaims himself a holy man...

620
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,707
and says God commands?

621
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:43,527
What kind of God tells children
to kill their parents?

622
01:12:43,795 --> 01:12:45,202
Answer me that, buddy.

623
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:48,591
Did you hearthat
before Isaac? Did you?

624
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:52,299
I can't believe
you're this blind.

625
01:12:55,185 --> 01:12:57,388
Maybe you've been listening
to this holy roller so long...

626
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,963
that all starts to sound the same.
But it's not!

627
01:13:02,576 --> 01:13:07,725
Any religion without love
and compassion is false.

628
01:13:08,687 --> 01:13:10,061
It's a lie!

629
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:49,664
Is he dead?

630
01:13:53,705 --> 01:13:55,265
Is this what you want?

631
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:58,366
Is it what He commands?

632
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:09,886
I don't think so.

633
01:14:10,599 --> 01:14:11,973
Get him!

634
01:14:13,127 --> 01:14:14,469
Stop him!

635
01:14:15,303 --> 01:14:16,732
Kill him!

636
01:14:17,798 --> 01:14:20,099
Malachai!

637
01:14:25,989 --> 01:14:29,698
He wants you too, Malachai.

638
01:14:33,988 --> 01:14:36,573
He wants you too.

639
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:16,248
- Vicky?
- Burt? Over here!

640
01:15:17,214 --> 01:15:18,970
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

641
01:15:23,165 --> 01:15:25,107
Get down.

642
01:15:25,565 --> 01:15:27,507
Get some help and get
those doors closed. Quick.

643
01:15:28,572 --> 01:15:29,979
Rudolf, Robert, come on!

644
01:15:30,204 --> 01:15:32,244
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

645
01:15:32,732 --> 01:15:34,423
If I knew what it was,
I could tell you.

646
01:15:34,683 --> 01:15:37,017
It's He Who Walks
Behind The Rows.

647
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,794
What if we tried to make it
to the road?

648
01:15:40,315 --> 01:15:42,224
I think we're safer here,
for now.

649
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,999
Has anybody evertried
to hurt the monster?

650
01:15:50,297 --> 01:15:52,370
Any of the adults, your parents
before they were killed?

651
01:15:52,602 --> 01:15:53,812
The Blue Man!

652
01:15:54,009 --> 01:15:55,700
Who is the Blue Man?
What did he do?

653
01:15:55,929 --> 01:15:57,784
Officer Hodgekiss.
I told you.

654
01:15:58,009 --> 01:16:00,627
He came down here
after he talked to the minister.

655
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,091
He was reading a page
torn out from the Bible...

656
01:16:03,448 --> 01:16:05,815
and it was working
with distil.

657
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:10,005
What was he reading
at the Bible?

658
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:11,596
What was it?
Do you know?

659
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:17,167
You have it?
Hurty up. Where is it?

660
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:19,979
"And the devil
that deceived them...

661
01:16:20,182 --> 01:16:22,548
was cast into the lake of fire
and sulphur.

662
01:16:22,997 --> 01:16:26,096
Where the beast and the false
prophet shall be tormented...

663
01:16:26,325 --> 01:16:28,910
day and night,
for ever and ever."

664
01:16:29,108 --> 01:16:30,537
What's that supposed to mean?

665
01:16:35,955 --> 01:16:39,151
What was the Blue Man
doing at the distil?

666
01:16:39,411 --> 01:16:42,313
He hooked the hose
and he was ttying to roll it out.

667
01:16:42,674 --> 01:16:45,325
- What stopped him?
- Malachai.

668
01:16:45,682 --> 01:16:48,911
Lake of fire. Fire!
He was gonna burn the field.

669
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:52,779
Oh, yes.
The alcohol from the distil.

670
01:16:52,977 --> 01:16:55,081
- How?
- Never mind, never mind.

671
01:16:55,633 --> 01:16:57,869
Kids, you bring me as many hoses
as you can find. Quick!

672
01:16:59,248 --> 01:17:01,615
Jobie and Sarah. Find me a bottle.
Aglass bottle.

673
01:17:01,808 --> 01:17:03,434
Quick!
Move!

674
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:06,027
Vicky, come here!

675
01:17:12,303 --> 01:17:13,797
Over here!

676
01:17:15,182 --> 01:17:16,644
It doesn't fit.

677
01:17:17,038 --> 01:17:18,826
There's gotta be a connector
here somewhere.

678
01:17:20,013 --> 01:17:21,955
Tty this.

679
01:17:34,219 --> 01:17:36,074
Get somebody
to hold this on tight.

680
01:17:37,003 --> 01:17:40,418
- Okay.
- Hang on to it. You got one. Good!

681
01:17:43,179 --> 01:17:46,309
Vicky, see if you can find me
a thick rag.

682
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:48,420
Jobie, come here.

683
01:17:50,058 --> 01:17:51,519
Hey, this is not a rag.

684
01:17:57,288 --> 01:18:00,549
Get them to hold on that tight.

685
01:18:01,832 --> 01:18:03,206
Open it up when I get there.
All right?

686
01:18:03,336 --> 01:18:04,546
All right.

687
01:18:05,831 --> 01:18:07,107
Be careful.

688
01:18:08,359 --> 01:18:09,984
I love you, Vicky.

689
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:08,350
What are you doing here?

690
01:19:08,607 --> 01:19:10,581
Get back to the barn.
Hurty up!

691
01:19:11,006 --> 01:19:11,955
Go on!

692
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:13,725
Move! Now!

693
01:19:19,293 --> 01:19:20,667
Excuse me!

694
01:19:40,123 --> 01:19:42,839
Get that valve. Quick.

695
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:56,016
Do you know howto run
this thing?

696
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,938
- Crank it!
- What?

697
01:19:58,136 --> 01:19:59,859
Crank it.

698
01:20:08,407 --> 01:20:10,446
Push the button at the top.

699
01:20:11,446 --> 01:20:12,657
Now!

700
01:20:53,009 --> 01:20:55,823
- Get the bottle!
- Okay!

701
01:21:10,126 --> 01:21:11,468
Jobie!

702
01:21:12,142 --> 01:21:13,800
Come back here!

703
01:21:23,789 --> 01:21:25,283
Jobie!

704
01:21:32,715 --> 01:21:35,366
Run, come on, run!

705
01:21:35,563 --> 01:21:38,661
- Jobie!
- Here's the bottle!

706
01:21:41,578 --> 01:21:44,545
Throw it!
It's the right time!

707
01:21:44,842 --> 01:21:46,434
Throw it!
Throw it!

708
01:22:05,799 --> 01:22:06,911
Burt!

709
01:22:12,582 --> 01:22:13,313
Jobie!

710
01:22:13,606 --> 01:22:15,231
Burt!

711
01:22:15,749 --> 01:22:17,505
Jobie!

712
01:22:18,853 --> 01:22:20,282
- Vicky!
- Sarah!

713
01:22:22,309 --> 01:22:24,611
Jobie!
Jobie!

714
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:32,157
Look!

715
01:22:45,986 --> 01:22:47,512
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

716
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:03,159
- Is he dead?
- I think so.

717
01:23:04,255 --> 01:23:05,913
Then why are we still running?

718
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:09,013
- Just keep going!
- Where did you get this guy?

719
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:39,896
Hemingford is 19 miles
right?

720
01:23:40,314 --> 01:23:44,274
- We'll walk?
- Sure.

721
01:23:45,594 --> 01:23:47,317
Are you sure
you're strong enough?

722
01:23:47,993 --> 01:23:52,432
I'm okay. And you?
Are you okay?

723
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,218
I'll make it.
I got a great doctor.

724
01:24:05,559 --> 01:24:06,868
Jealous?

725
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:10,227
So what do we do with these
two little kids?

726
01:24:10,934 --> 01:24:12,210
I don't know.

727
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,412
You guys wanna stay with us
for a couple of days?

728
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:17,802
How about a week?

729
01:24:19,477 --> 01:24:21,232
Okay.

730
01:24:21,685 --> 01:24:23,376
- How about a month?
- No.

731
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:28,241
All right. All right.
I'll grab the map.

732
01:24:28,979 --> 01:24:32,274
- Interloper! No!
- God!

733
01:24:38,099 --> 01:24:39,375
You must die!

734
01:24:43,858 --> 01:24:44,840
Oh, boy!

735
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,981
She's out cold.

736
01:24:55,952 --> 01:24:57,642
What are we gonna do now?

737
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,316
Send her a card from Seattle.
Let's get out of here.
