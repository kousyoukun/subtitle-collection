173
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,498
Well, you just let me know

[slams telephone receiver]

Miss Davies.

177
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:06,632
I trust that
my detective

178
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,634
is giving you
everything you need.

179

[clears throat]

181
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,478
Miss Davies,
I just want to remind you

182
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:18,181
that the body that
you saw was a person.

183
00:15:19,235 --> 00:15:22,524
With a family,
friends, a life.

184
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:25,731
So I trust that you'll treat
anything that you saw

185
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,942
with absolute sensitivity.

186
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:29,321
Definitely.

187
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:32,325
And you know, the mayor
may have signed off

but I didn't.

189
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,501
If you print anything

190
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:42,422
that compromises the work
of my detectives in this case,

191
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,966
you will find yourself
standing in a court of law.

192
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:47,009
Do I make myself clear?

193
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,928
Yes.

194
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,263
"Yes, Captain."

195
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,091
Yes, Captain.

196
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,892
Can you excuse us, please?

197
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,345
Thank you.

198
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,101
Let me talk to you
about Archer.

199

Uh, you know,

Oh, you know, Ruiney tried
that joke on me earlier.

204
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:21,082
Ah, damn it. Didn't work then. Hi.

205
00:16:21,172 --> 00:16:24,381
So good to see you.
It's just like old times.

206
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:27,426
[Archer]
I missed your hugs.

207
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,218
So...
Oh.

208
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,671
Whoa.
Sorry.

209
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:34,257
Yeah, get that press pass
out of my face.

210
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:38,095
Last time we had paparazzi on
a case, evidence went missing.

211
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:41,064
Sir, I've been nominated
for a Pulitzer.

212
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,312
[Ruiney] Archer. Yeah.

213
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,643
You recognize her?

214
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:48,150
No, I don't.

215
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:52,776
Kerry Cooper, 24.

216
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,658
Foreign language teacher.
No record.

217

Parents filed a Missing Persons
three days ago.

218
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,326
Right...

219
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:03,210
So, Abby,
what do you got to say?

220
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:05,835
Oh, well, cause of death
is definitely asphyxiation,

221
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,793
which isn't at all,
you know, surprising.

222
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:10,002
Time of death?

223
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:14,339
Well, the body was still
warm when it got to us.

224
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,676
I'd say sometime between
10:30 and midnight.

225
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:24,688
And I can tell you she was actually
still alive when this happened.

226
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,861
You see the uneven strokes?

227
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,358
<i>She struggled.</i>

228
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:32,824
Any idea what was used?

229
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,618
A large knife.
A box cutter maybe?

230
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:38,447
I can't be sure until I have
something to compare it to.

231
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,874
Oh, also, it looks like

232
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,202
the killer redressed her
after the fact.

233
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,962
Meticulous.
Purposeful.

234
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,873
Oh, and also, uh,

235
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:52,132
you know, she has seen her
fair share of the inside of ER.

236
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:56,215
She's had everything from a broken
pelvis to several broken ribs.

237
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,889
They've healed,
but they're all fairly recent.

238
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:03,221
What are you thinking?
Like, what, domestic violence?

239
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,729
Uh... perhaps.

240
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,240
What about these, uh,
contusions here?

241
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,362
Oh, uh, severe blows
to the head.

242
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:19,071
I mean, I can only presume that
was to knock Miss Cooper out.

243
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,075
Okay.
Thanks, Abby.

244
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,376
Yeah, sure.

245

You know, parents
didn't give me much.

They said they knew him,
but they never met him.

00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,193
Look, I've been doing
so good.

321
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:30,525
Okay? I just been clean
for a couple months,

322
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:32,326
and I just slipped up.

323
00:24:32,412 --> 00:24:33,528
"Slipped up"?

324
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:35,454
That's a bit of an
understatement, don't you think?

325
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,166
What are you talking about?

326
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:40,410
I'm talking about
your girlfriend,

327
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:42,086
Miss Kerry Cooper.

328
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,839
[stammers]

329
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:49,803
No, no. She liked it rough sometimes.

330
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,596
Okay? And you have it
backwards. She was the aggressor.

331
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,559
You don't think I have my own
bumps and bruises from her?

332
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,386
It went both ways.

333
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,688
Well, that's comforting
to hear.

334
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:06,311
Look, I don't expect you
to understand.

335
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:08,195
I don't.

336
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:09,655
I never met
anybody like her.

337
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,199
And she didn't treat me
like I was some screw-up.

338
00:25:12,285 --> 00:25:15,278
Yeah. So I was scared
I was gonna lose her.

339
00:25:16,707 --> 00:25:19,324
I freaked out, okay?
We got into a fight...

340
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:25,333
Did it get physical?

341
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,837
Yeah, yeah, but it
wasn't like that. Okay?

342
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:30,551
And I apologized
like crazy.

343
00:25:30,637 --> 00:25:32,253
And we're working
things out.

344
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:35,511
When was the last time
you saw her?

345
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:38,184
Last week.

346
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:39,768
Dropped her off
at the school.

347
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:41,221
She said she would call,

348
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:44,349
but... she just needed
some time.

349
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,309
Look, call her.

350
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:50,021
You'll see. I didn't
hurt her again. I swear.

<i>[Archer]

352
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:57,278

00:25:57,414 --> 00:25:58,655
I think it's too late.

That's not...
That's not her.

It's what we're dealing
with here. That's not...

No, no, no.
That's not Kerry.

What's the matter
with you?

360
00:26:21,063 --> 00:26:22,349
I need to see her.

Right now! I need
to see her right now!

362
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,016
Is she dead?

363
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:30,148
Yes, she's dead.

No.
She's not dead.

That can't happen.
Please.

Let's just, uh,

That's not her.

You want a drink?

How 'bout I get you
a water or a soda?

379

I'll get you a soda.

380
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,500
So...

381
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:30,122
You still think
she did it?

382
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,458
Well, she just admitted
to playing rough.

383
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,339
But does that
make her a murderer?

384
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,802
I don't know.
Who knows?

385
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,297
You know, sometimes
they start playing and then

386
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,348
it escalates.

387
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:42,800
I've seen it.

388
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,601
No, this doesn't track.

389
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:47,556
Habitual domestic violence
is impulsive in nature.

Our perp is calculated,

Especially with Lois Lane
outside your door.

I'm sorry. I screwed up.

Yeah, you're damn right
you screwed up.

402

Look, Ruiney. I know what you're
still going through, all right?

<i>But you have got to get

<i>In this case.</i>

Or you're gonna have to take
some more time off.

No, I got this.
It's good. I got it.

407
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:12,398
So do you have any idea,
Captain, how the girl's doing?

408
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,568
The doctor said she was touch and
go for a while, but she's stable now.

409
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,486
That's good.

410
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:21,065
She was also able to give
an alibi, which checks out.

411
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,369
And Ray, you're here
as a courtesy.

412
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:31,076
You're not a cop anymore.
So don't push it.

413
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:33,414
Okay, Captain.

478
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:29,947
Two? I don't...
I don't follow.

479
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:32,946
You see, Reverend,
there's a dead guy

480
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:34,610
swinging in your church.

481
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:37,196
You knew him, right?
Gene Wilson?

482
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:39,574
Yeah, he was the janitor.

483
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:42,375
What was he doing here
so late?

484
00:33:42,462 --> 00:33:44,670
He cleans whenever he can.

485
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:49,342
He... he was just released and
was looking for a fresh start.

486
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,052
What are you thinking?

487
00:33:58,311 --> 00:33:59,643
Uh...

488
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:01,854
[chuckles]

489
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,183
Reverend, we're gonna need
you to write down

490
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:09,187
exactly your whereabouts
the last three days.

491
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,613
Okay. Yeah,
that's not a problem.

492
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,907
Um, I was in Springfield,

493
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:15,242
uh, giving a guest sermon

494
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,578
at the Unitarian
Universal Church.

495
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:21,954
Um, I just got back tonight...
Okay. Okay.

496
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:25,377
How about
Miss Kerry Cooper?

497
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,874
How did you know her?

498
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,754
Cooper, I don't... I don't...
I don't believe I do.

499
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:32,926
You don't know her? [Green] No.

500
00:34:33,012 --> 00:34:35,846
Well, you're gonna have
to do some explaining then

501
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:37,389
because your blood

502
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,717
<i>was in her apartment.</i>

503
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:42,435
My blood in her...
I don't... I don't have...

504
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:50,903
Y- Y-You're not
gonna believe this.

505
00:34:53,783 --> 00:34:58,073
Frankly, I... I... I still
don't understand it myself.

506
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,654
But, um,
a couple of months ago,

507
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:02,660
I woke up in the middle
of the night

508
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,537
with someone
standing over me.

509
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:06,118
A man.

510
00:35:06,212 --> 00:35:07,794
And he... I struggled,

511
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:12,713
but he put something over...
over my face.

512
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:15,590
And eventually,
I passed out.

513
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,967
<i>[exhales]
When I woke up...</i>

514
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:22,885
...there was... there was blood
coming out of my arm.

515
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:24,845
I mean,
it was dripping down my arm.

516
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:27,647
<i>Like I'd gotten a shot
or something. So...</i>

517
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:32,236
Okay, so you're
telling us that a guy

518
00:35:32,322 --> 00:35:35,565
broke into your house
and stole your blood?

519
00:35:35,658 --> 00:35:36,739
That's the story
you're telling?

520
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:40,285
That's... I told you... I told
you you wouldn't believe me.

521
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,123
Well, I've heard
some stories.

522
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:48,331
<i>But you know,
this rings a bell to me.</i>

523
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:51,209
Yeah, it's kind of a coincidence
when you think of it.

524
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:53,416
Last Thursday...
I don't know if I told you.

525
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:57,128
<i>I woke up
in the middle of the night.</i>

526
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,463
And for some reason,

527
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,264
I had a pink tutu on.

528
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:06,808
And a serious fuzzy feather
sticking out of my ass.

529
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,309
[chuckling]

530
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,563
You know, you're right.

531
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:13,770
I don't believe you.

532
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:16,321
[indistinct chatter]

533
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:58,447
These days, you know, he can't bring
himself to look inside that file.

534
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,114
But he's unable
to let it go.

535
00:37:04,414 --> 00:37:06,531
That's why
he keeps it so close.

536
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:11,827
Archer, there's something that
I think you need to look at.

537
00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:15,335
You want me
to look at that?

538
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:18,293
[sighs]
Please.

539
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:24,723
You and I both know you're not
supposed to be anywhere near here.

540
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,223
This is important
to this case.

541
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:31,354
Please.

542
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:39,776
At first, it just looks like
random slash marks.

543
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:41,694
Oh, shit!

544
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,824
I don't know.
I think...

545
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:49,406
I'm so... so sorry.

546
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:58,423
I missed it.

547
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,297
[sighs]
I missed it.

548
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:05,548
So much was going on at the
time, you know, it was...

549
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:08,475
It was all...

550
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,057
You had no way
of knowing then.

551
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,148
[sighs]

552
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,987
You know, I introduced
them to each other.

553
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,495
She asked me
to walk her down the aisle...

554
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:36,582
...to give her away.

555
00:38:40,009 --> 00:38:42,342
I don't see how

556
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,802
I could have missed it.

557
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,343
You didn't even know what you
were looking for back then.

558
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:50,683
You were too close to it.

559
00:38:56,776 --> 00:38:58,392
Okay.

560
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,198
Good work, Christi.

561
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:15,159
[sighs]

562
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:21,293
[Ruiney] There are at
least a dozen witnesses

563
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:23,967
that can place him
in that church in Springfield.

564
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:27,091
And I checked out the report
from three months ago.

565
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:30,265
Turns out Reverend Green
is telling the truth.

566
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:33,185
Lab found traces
of chloroform in his blood.

567
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,020
No items
were reported missing?

568
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:37,935
The only thing missing
was his DNA.

569
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:39,812
This doesn't make
any sense.

570
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:41,359
No, Captain, it does.

571
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:44,104
He wanted us
to go to that church.

572
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:46,611
This guy is definitely
a psychopath.

573
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:49,284
But I would classify him
as an organized killer.

574
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:52,954
There's nothing random or spontaneous,
frenzied, about these attacks.

575
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,249
They're planned. He leaves a
controlled scene for us to find.

576
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:59,373
I think we're looking
for a white male, 25-to-35.

577
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,579
Extremely high IQ.

578
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:03,708
And what about this...
this pig head business?

579
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:08,679
Pigs. Cops. Maybe he's
just taunting you guys.

580
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:11,507
Okay, this information doesn't leave
this room. Do you understand me?

581
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:13,684
Of course. If the media
gets a hold of this,

582
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:15,726
they're gonna turn this
into a frenzy in seconds.

583
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:19,056
And if I had it my way,
you would go home now.

584
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,815
So with Reverend Green's alibi
checking out, then what does that mean?

585
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:26,563
I mean, does this mean
we're back to square one?

586
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,362
We're not even
on square one.

587
00:40:31,412 --> 00:40:34,280
You see, it's all about
the hangman game.

588
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,919
So far, we have
two homicides.

589
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:45,291
But... we have three letters.

590
00:40:45,384 --> 00:40:47,000
Which means...

591
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,963
we haven't even found
the first victim yet.

592
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:55,263
And, judging
by the game board...

593
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,396
he's gonna kill
seven more people.

594
00:40:59,482 --> 00:41:03,567
Same pattern
as previous victim.

595
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:05,440
Petechial hemorrhages
in the eyes,

596
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:08,188
look, the ligature marks
around the neck.

597
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:13,448
[sighs] Cause of death
was asphyxiation again.

598
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,120
<i>[Ruiney] Our perp's been
leaving us clues to the next vic.</i>

599
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,290
So far, we haven't
got much to go on.

600
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,709
Have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary?

601
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:23,412
No, nothing.
Time of death?

602
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:26,715
Uh, sometime between ten
and midnight last night.

603
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:29,669
It was eleven p. m. sharp.

604
00:41:29,762 --> 00:41:33,426
Well, it's a little difficult
to be that precise.

605
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:38,056
Well, his Rolex broke.
Right there. Eleven p. m.

606
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:41,104
But clearly last night,
that watch didn't fit him.

607
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,022
I don't know too much
about Rolexes,

608
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:46,643
except I do know janitors aren't
running around wearing them.

609
00:41:48,197 --> 00:41:49,529
That's not his watch.

610
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:53,029
Yeah. You want to dust
this for prints? Sure.

611
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,903
No, he's too smart
for that.

612
00:41:56,038 --> 00:41:57,904
Tell me.
Eleven p. m.,

613
00:41:57,999 --> 00:42:00,742
that'd fit into the time frame
for all the victims, right?

614
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:03,327
Yeah. That would be correct, Detective.

615
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:10,588
What?
Twenty-four hours.

616
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:18,221
Hangman is gonna kill someone
at eleven p. m. every 24 hours.

617
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:22,350
So that gives us two and a half
hours before the next victim falls.

618
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,815
Come on, guys. What are we missing?
There's got to be something.

619
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:28,063
Oh, wait.
Uh, the ligature marks,

620
00:42:28,195 --> 00:42:31,279
they weren't like
the previous victim.

621
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:33,027
Why?
Well, okay,

622
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:37,073
see, they were made
of the pigskin.

623
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:38,324
Pigskin?
Yeah.

624
00:42:38,414 --> 00:42:40,747
I think I can help here.

625
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:45,791
The FDA stamps serial numbers
on all their meat,

626
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,715
so in case of contamination,
they can trace it.

627
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:53,293
That's it.

628
00:42:53,387 --> 00:42:55,800
Let's get the captain
to wake up the FDA.

629
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,598
Good stuff, Abby.

630
00:43:04,857 --> 00:43:07,895
[cows mooing]

631
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,567
[Ruiney] You okay?
[Archer] Yeah.

632
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,530
I just need to talk to you

Hey, how come the meat
isn't frozen?

666
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,984
How cold is it in here?

667
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,077
There's a thermostat
over there.

668
00:46:48,163 --> 00:46:49,825
It's, uh, 37 degrees.

669
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:53,667
Oh, well none of that meat's
frozen in there.

670
00:46:53,794 --> 00:46:56,377
So how come our guy's
frozen stiff?

671
00:46:56,463 --> 00:47:00,252
[Abby stammers] Well,
he's not a-a slab of meat.

672
00:47:00,342 --> 00:47:03,631
And he has more
water density.

673
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:06,464
So, any prolonged exposure,
even at that temp,

674
00:47:06,598 --> 00:47:08,180
would cause him
to decompose.

675
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:10,429
Well, hasn't been
here long, has he?

676
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:14,479
How long has he been here?
This place been open all day.

677

you would think someone

might have seen a stiff,
dead guy hanging in here.

679
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:24,114
Don't you think?
I agree, yes.

680
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:27,992
Now, if his body was wet,

681
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,990
would that
make him freeze faster?

682
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,242
Yes, of course it would.

683
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:34,325
Archer, what are you thinking?

684
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,455
Well, I'm thinking...

00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:41,248
when I want my beer
to chill faster,

686

I wrap it
in a wet paper towel.

687
00:47:45,304 --> 00:47:47,512

No, Arch, no. This is... What?

718

This is a completely different
MO, Archer. She wasn't hung.

Archer, it's a different MO.
She wasn't hung.

721

She wasn't hung because...

722
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:46,630
he was interrupted
from his ritual.

723
00:49:48,135 --> 00:49:50,969
He didn't get a chance
to hang her, you understand?

724
00:49:54,475 --> 00:49:56,512

You know,
just like I used to.

735
00:50:43,148 --> 00:50:47,188
That would've given him a
chance to know someone was there,

736
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,018
and that
would've stopped him.

01:05:44,424 --> 01:05:47,838
I just feel like we
were lucky, you know?

951
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:50,836
One scar's enough already.

952
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:54,424
<i>[Archer] Hey, babes, we gotta move.</i>

953
01:05:55,935 --> 01:05:57,801
So what are we gonna do
with the captain?

954
01:05:57,937 --> 01:06:00,020
I mean, I think
she should be questioned.

955
01:06:00,106 --> 01:06:01,722
She's the only one
who saw the Hangman.

956
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:03,648
Already did.
She didn't get a look.

957
01:06:03,776 --> 01:06:05,438
She was jumped from behind.

958
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,815
What a fight
she put up, huh?

959
01:06:07,905 --> 01:06:09,362
In a wheelchair.

960
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:13,443
Yeah, wheelchair, no wheelchair,
that's one tough cop.

961
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,825
Got nothing from the motorcycle.
Stolen. No prints.

962
01:06:16,914 --> 01:06:18,496
Figures with this guy.

963
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:27,832
How you doing, Christi?

964
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,128
<i>You okay?</i>

965
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:40,553
I was doing this piece
on drug cartels,

966
01:06:40,646 --> 01:06:43,013
and it was in the middle
of nowhere, and...

967
01:06:44,525 --> 01:06:46,687
<i>I was going to my car
late at night.</i>

968
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,229
And...

969
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:54,157
I just felt like something bad
was gonna happen.

970
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:58,988
There was this guy,

971
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,324
and he just came up,
um, behind me

972
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:05,286
and he knocked me down and...

973
01:07:06,964 --> 01:07:09,001
he just started
beating me.

974
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:13,298
He had a knife
to my neck.

975
01:07:13,387 --> 01:07:16,255
<i>I didn't know
if I was gonna live or not.</i>

976
01:07:19,227 --> 01:07:21,685
The detective who
was assigned to the case...

977
01:07:23,689 --> 01:07:25,521
Detective Michaels,

978
01:07:27,151 --> 01:07:29,985
he vowed to find the guy
who did this to me.

979
01:07:32,156 --> 01:07:33,567
I don't know why.

980
01:07:35,201 --> 01:07:38,535
I don't know
why he cared so much.

981
01:07:43,709 --> 01:07:46,543
But he did. He found
him. He found the guy.

982
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,882
And the guy shot him.

983
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:57,297
Detective Michaels
had a wife...

984
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,386
...and a little girl.

985
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:09,395
People don't understand

986
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:12,478
why you guys
do what you do.

987
01:08:12,572 --> 01:08:15,610
<i>They don't understand
how much you give up</i>

988
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:17,778
<i>and how much
you sacrifice.</i>

989
01:08:20,871 --> 01:08:22,988
So, this story,

990
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:26,750
it's not about me,
it's about...

991
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,626
It's about him.
It's about you.

992
01:08:31,757 --> 01:08:33,965
It's about you guys.

993
01:08:35,136 --> 01:08:36,252
[sniffles]

994
01:08:36,429 --> 01:08:38,546
So I'm not...
I'm not giving up.

995
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:44,134
I guess you guys
are stuck with me.

996
01:08:47,898 --> 01:08:49,264
Okay.

997
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:59,357
[starts car]

998
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:04,363
[Archer] He's killed
four people in four days,

999
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:06,699
one every 24 hours.

1000
01:09:06,792 --> 01:09:09,409
He doesn't stop.
That's part of the game.

1001
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:13,463
He kills Jessica and
he stops... for a year.

1002
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:17,133
You want to put a new team
on Jessica's murder?

1003
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,960
Archer, we had four homicides
in four days.

1004
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:21,388
We don't have the resources
to put a team on a homicide

1005
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:24,308
that happened a year ago. Please,
it not about resources, man.

1006
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:26,851
Something happened.
It's very obvious.

1007
01:09:26,937 --> 01:09:28,894
Look, I agree with you.
There's a gap...

1008
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:32,190
I know, there's a gap...between
murders. So let's just talk about it.

1009
01:09:32,318 --> 01:09:35,152
What does it mean?
Okay, look.

1010
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:39,865
There are only three reasons
why a serial killer stops.

1011
01:09:39,992 --> 01:09:41,824
One, they die.
That hasn't happened.

1012
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:45,655
Two, we catch them.
That hasn't happened.

1013
01:09:46,957 --> 01:09:48,664
Or three,

1014
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,664
they're in prison
on an unrelated charge.

1015
01:09:53,381 --> 01:09:55,589
Well, sounds possible.

1016
01:09:55,675 --> 01:09:59,214
In jail for some
unrelated charge.

1017
01:09:59,345 --> 01:10:01,837
So, why don't we get
one of the techies

1018
01:10:01,972 --> 01:10:04,180
to look at everybody
who was put in prison

1019
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:05,677
from the time
that Jess was murdered

1020
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:07,472
to the time Reverend Green's
blood was taken?

1021
01:10:07,561 --> 01:10:08,847
Nine-month period.

1022
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,351
That's gonna yield hundreds,
maybe thousands.

1023
01:10:11,482 --> 01:10:13,690
Yeah, that's the problem.
We don't have the time.

1024
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:16,234
So we need to figure out a way
to refine the search.

1025
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,529
But, I think that this is
personal to you guys.

1026
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:22,403
He put your badge numbers
on that desk for a reason.

1027
01:10:22,535 --> 01:10:24,527
She's right.
He called us out.

1028
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:29,869
So, let's refine
the search to us.

1029
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,492
Everyone you arrested
this past year,

1030
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:35,245
and everyone I arrested.

1031
01:10:35,339 --> 01:10:36,546
Detectives?

[indistinct chatter]

1034
01:12:24,824 --> 01:12:27,658
That son of a bitch
killed Joey,

1035
01:12:27,785 --> 01:12:32,029
as a payback to us
for saving the captain.

1036
01:12:32,164 --> 01:12:34,497
He's that kinda guy.

1037
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,415
Please, tell me
you got something.

1038
01:12:36,502 --> 01:12:39,916
I searched the records and used the
filters for the date range you gave me.

1039
01:12:40,005 --> 01:12:42,998
Yeah, and? 26 arrests
in your time parameters.

1040
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,799
Five released
in time to be your guy.

Put it up.
That's all right.

1042
01:12:49,306 --> 01:12:50,513
So...

1043
01:12:51,642 --> 01:12:54,555
who might that be
fits the profile.

1044
01:12:54,645 --> 01:12:58,104
Adam Kellerman.
Adam Kellerman.

1045
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:59,897
Pull up Adam Kellerman.

Yeah, here we go. Kellerman,
Adam. Assault with a deadly weapon.

1048
01:13:07,575 --> 01:13:10,238
Look at his address.
And home.

1049
01:13:10,327 --> 01:13:11,443

1050
01:13:11,537 --> 01:13:15,907
Eric Anderson. Eric Anderson's
basement was full of toys.

1051
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:19,034
Give us those shots
from, uh, from Anderson.

1052

Son of a bitch sold it to him, I'll bet.

Get the prints off the wall.

1063

Run 'em against Kellerman.

1064

This is Ruiney.

1065
01:14:21,231 --> 01:14:24,190
Let's get Forensics up here.
We have a deceased male.

<i>[Ruiney]
No powder residue on his face.</i>

And residue on his hands.

Oh.
Got his paint bucket there.

Yes, it could be.

01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:21,053
I should check down
at the station house

<i>Officer, make sure she gets
back to her place safely.</i>

This guy went to extreme
lengths to get our attention.

Made sure we followed
every lead, found every victim.

01:17:04,561 --> 01:17:08,475
So why off yourself before
the game is finished?

<i>I mean, we don't even know
what the word is.</i>

So what
are you saying to me?

1097

You want this thing
to make some kind of sense?

<i>Tie it up in some way?</i>

That's not the world,

You're still young enough
to believe it is,

but things

01:17:41,348 --> 01:17:43,715
they quit
having any effect.

1104

I could never look at things from

<i>I'm not asking you to.</i>

01:17:49,857 --> 01:17:53,066
Maybe you're not ready
to let this whole thing go.

1107
01:17:53,152 --> 01:17:54,939
Because that would mean,
in a way,

1108
01:17:55,028 --> 01:17:58,647
that you're giving up
on Jessica.

1109
01:18:03,829 --> 01:18:05,741
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1110
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:10,917
Maybe I'm not.

1111
01:18:11,003 --> 01:18:14,838
But I need
to be sure, Archer.

1112
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:16,880
I need to be sure.

1113
01:18:18,844 --> 01:18:23,760
That's an impossible wish,
but go for it.

1114
01:18:23,849 --> 01:18:26,091
Let's go see Christi.

1115
01:18:26,185 --> 01:18:29,849
Listen to her recordings.
Maybe she's got something.

1116
01:18:30,981 --> 01:18:33,018
Sure, why not?

1117
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:36,689
Spirit of sense and logic.
I will go.

1118

I know who the killer is.
Call dispatch.

1146

Have them run a check on the
guy that sideswiped me last year.

1147
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:40,225
I wouldn't move around
too much if I were you.

1148

You know something?

1149
01:20:48,618 --> 01:20:51,656
We have a lot more in
common than you realize.

01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:01,796
Hmm... So, I think,

1153
01:21:01,882 --> 01:21:05,592
seeing as you've had to focus
on me this whole time,

1154
01:21:05,677 --> 01:21:08,920
that it's only fair
that I turn the camera on you.

1155
01:21:09,056 --> 01:21:10,467
So come on, Christi.

1156
01:21:10,557 --> 01:21:13,766
Let's have a little smile.
Our viewers are waiting.

1157

They're gonna track that feed,
and they're gonna come for me.

Can you hear them?
Can you hear them coming?

Never came for me.

You think
I didn't think of that?

You see, the thing is...

But, um, unfortunately,
you don't.

Next of kin, next of kin.

How about birth parents?

Hung himself.

I think I know where he's
gonna take her, and why.

What's the date
of his father's death?

Wait a minute.
October 9, 1998.

He did it at one
of them pig farms off 28.

Pig farm off 28?
Archer, Christi's not there.

What do you mean?

1186

God. Ruiney, where's he buried?</i>

1200
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:06,788
Where's his father buried? Okay,
so it's the state's responsibility

1201
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:09,169
to bury the destitute
in a public graveyard.

1202
01:23:09,301 --> 01:23:11,167
So where's the closest
public graveyard?

1203
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:13,924
Public mortuaries. We got
St. Catherine's, St. Joseph's.

Only we got to beat
his timeline.

1209

That's how he knew
the Reverend Green.

Approximately 20 minutes out.

Come on, Christi.

1217
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:47,169
You haven't

<i>Why the... Why the game?
Why the hangman game?</i>

I dunno. This one just
kinda stuck with me.

1220
01:23:56,848 --> 01:24:00,512
And also, there's a slight
thrill in being in control.

1221
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:03,686
You know, it's an exhilarating
feeling, you know,

1222
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:06,890
being able to tell
who lives and who dies.

1223
01:24:06,983 --> 01:24:09,191
<i>And that justifies killing
innocent people?</i>

1224

You should really
feel privileged

a double value letter.

I have more questions.

01:24:19,871 --> 01:24:22,454
Why do you redress
the-the people?

1229
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:24,578
If you just kill them,
why do you redress them?

1230
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:29,495
I used to work nights
in a department store.

S- So it's all about control.

And I get that.
I get that.

1236

Something happened

I mean, I'll flick the switch
now. I don't have to wait!

Ten fifty-eight.
Two minutes.
