00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,402
<i>thought I was crazy
to move back here.</i>

165
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:19,403
<i>A demotion in their eyes.</i>

166
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:22,974
<i>But, you know, for
me it's all the same.</i>

167
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:25,777
<i>Still, uh, catching bad guys.</i>

168
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:26,848
[Christi] <i>What brought you back?</i>

169
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:33,217
<i>Personal reasons.</i>

170
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:36,388
<i>Look, let's just keep
this about the job, okay?</i>

171
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,792
[Christi] <i>I'm just trying to get
a better sense of who you are.</i>

172
00:14:40,794 --> 00:14:43,798
<i>Audiences really connect with
personal stories of their subjects.</i>

173
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,200
<i>Yeah, I'm sure they do.</i>

174
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:53,138
[typing]

175
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,072
- [man] <i>There's no information.</i>
- Oh, am I bothering you?

176
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,774
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
There's no information.</i>

177
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,744
Well, you just let me know when finding out

178
00:14:58,746 --> 00:15:01,178
what happened to my wife
is a priority, asshole.

179
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,248
[slams telephone receiver]

180
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,350
Miss Davies.

181
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:07,852
I trust that my detective

182
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,988
is giving you everything you need.

183
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,456
Oh, yeah. We're, uh, tethered at the hip.

184
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,192
[clears throat]

185
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:16,495
Miss Davies, I just want to remind you

186
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:20,264
that the body that you saw was a person.

187
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:23,835
With a family, friends, a life.

188
00:15:23,837 --> 00:15:26,904
So I trust that you'll
treat anything that you saw

189
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:28,440
with absolute sensitivity.

190
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,808
Definitely.

191
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,278
And you know, the mayor may have signed off

192
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,016
on this all access pet
project, but I didn't.

193
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:40,152
If you print anything

194
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:43,288
that compromises the work of
my detectives in this case,

195
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,023
you will find yourself
standing in a court of law.

196
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:48,159
Do I make myself clear?

197
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,730
Yes.

198
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:52,364
"Yes, Captain."

199
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:53,965
Yes, Captain.

200
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,966
Can you excuse us, please?

201
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:58,036
Thank you.

202
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:59,907
Let me talk to you about Archer.

203
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:08,379
[woman on P.A.] <i>Dr. Parker, please
report to pathology, room number one.</i>

204
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,482
- Hello. Anybody home?
- <i>Dr. Parker.</i>

205
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:13,552
[laughs]

206
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:16,221
Uh, you know, most people go fishing.

207
00:16:16,223 --> 00:16:19,124
Oh, you know, Ruiney tried
that joke on me earlier.

208
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:23,327
- Ah, damn it.
- Didn't work then. Hi.

209
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,462
- So good to see you.
- It's just like old times.

210
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:27,400
[Archer] I missed your hugs.

211
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,302
- So...
- Oh.

212
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:32,070
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

213
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:35,539
Yeah, get that press pass out of my face.

214
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:39,211
Last time we had paparazzi on
a case, evidence went missing.

215
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:42,214
Sir, I've been nominated for a Pulitzer.

216
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:44,416
- [Ruiney] Archer.
- Yeah.

217
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:45,386
You recognize her?

218
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,923
No, I don't.

219
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:53,524
Kerry Cooper, 24.

220
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:56,894
Foreign language teacher. No record.

221
00:16:56,896 --> 00:17:00,065
Parents filed a Missing
Persons three days ago.

222
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,533
Right...

223
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,402
So, Abby, what do you got to say?

224
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:07,205
Oh, well, cause of death
is definitely asphyxiation,

225
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:10,041
which isn't at all, you know, surprising.

226
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:11,876
Time of death?

227
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:15,547
Well, the body was still
warm when it got to us.

228
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,350
I'd say sometime between
10:30 and midnight.

229
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:25,923
And I can tell you she was actually
still alive when this happened.

230
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:28,425
You see the uneven strokes?

231
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,097
She struggled.

232
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:34,098
Any idea what was used?

233
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,667
A large knife. A box cutter maybe?

234
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:39,403
I can't be sure until I have
something to compare it to.

235
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:42,073
Oh, also, it looks like

236
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,978
the killer redressed her after the fact.

237
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,413
Meticulous. Purposeful.

238
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,448
Oh, and also, uh,

239
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,451
you know, she has seen her
fair share of the inside of ER.

240
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:57,388
She's had everything from a broken
pelvis to several broken ribs.

241
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,259
They've healed, but
they're all fairly recent.

242
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,362
What are you thinking? Like,
what, domestic violence?

243
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,867
Uh... perhaps.

244
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,372
What about these, uh, contusions here?

245
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:16,540
Oh, uh, severe blows to the head.

246
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,946
I mean, I can only presume that
was to knock Miss Cooper out.

247
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,416
Okay. Thanks, Abby.

248
00:18:25,418 --> 00:18:26,152
Yeah, sure.

249
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:41,465
[Christi] Looks like
she was quite the smoker.

250
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,468
Nasty habit.

251
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,372
So what is it you guys
are looking for exactly?

252
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:51,643
Well... I'm not quite sure.

253
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:53,981
We're just looking.

254
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:59,116
Oh, look at this.

255
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:01,054
Look what I found.

256
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:06,360
Joey Truman.

257
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,394
Her parents said

258
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:12,463
she went out on a date with Joey.

259
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,633
- Joey...
- Archer.

260
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:19,073
Hey, Ruiney. Let's get an
address on this guy Joey.

261
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:34,088
I think I'm gonna be sick.

262
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:36,624
[imaginary screams]

- [imaginary screams continue]
- [imaginary punches landing]

266
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:11,524
Joey.

267
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:15,259
You think that's our guy?

268
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:16,998
Oh, I don't know.

269
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:22,767
You know, parents didn't give me much.

270
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,239
They said they knew him,
but they never met him.

271
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:30,411
Oh, hello.

272
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:45,126
Let's get Forensics in here.

273
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:06,211
- Then why the badge numbers?
- [Archer] I don't know why,

274
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:09,480
but it's big enough to
get me out of retirement.

275
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:11,449
[woman] Help you with something?

276
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:14,486
Yeah, you can.

277
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:18,388
I'm looking for a fella named Joey Truman.

278
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,458
Would he be around somewhere?

279
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,694
[woman] What do you want with Joey?

280
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,530
I don't want anything,
just want to talk to him.

281
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:29,701
Huh. Yeah, yeah, he's inside.

282
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:31,135
Knock yourself out.

283
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,238
- Oh, okay. Thank you.
- Wait here.

284
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,407
Hey, Joey! The cops are here!

285
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:38,643
Police! Don't move!

286
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:39,747
Don't move!

[Joey grunting]

288
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,785
- Stay down!
- [Joey grunts]

289
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:49,686
- [Joey] I didn't do anything.
- [knee thuds]

290
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:51,291
Shut up! Stay down!

291
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:03,634
[Christi] Detectives!

292
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:05,369
Detectives!

293
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:07,440
[both grunting]

294
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,843
- [Ruiney] You all right?
- Yeah.

295
00:22:11,845 --> 00:22:14,115
[dramatic music]

296
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,330
- I'm sorry.
- Joey, what's wrong?

297
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:35,735
- Joey.
- I'll explain later. I'll explain later.

298
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:45,245

00:22:55,222 --> 00:22:58,224
Hey, I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!

- [tires squeal]
- [grunts]

302

- Hey!
- [woman] Whoa, whoa!

303
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:23,250
Help me out, guys! Help me out!

00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,596
- [groaning]
- [Archer] Okay, honey. Honey!

307
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,266
- Honey, hold it, hold it...
- All right!

308
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:43,034
Still prefer retirement, Archer?

309
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:45,539
- I never preferred retirement.
- [grunts]

310
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,875
Well...

311
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:54,545
it looks like the abuse

312
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:55,913
wasn't the only thing

313
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:57,684
Kerry kept from her parents.

314
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:02,386
[Christi] She doesn't look worried.

315
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:05,690
Yeah, she didn't even ask
why she was being brought in.

316
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:08,292
Better let me do the questioning,

317
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,827
otherwise her attorney
will have a field day.

318
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:13,867
Your show, buddy. Your show.

319
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:22,006
Look, I'm sorry I ran. Okay?

320
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:23,740
I was scared.

321
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:25,843
You didn't look scared.

322
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,511
Right, you didn't look scared.

323
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,681
Look, I've been doing so good.

324
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:31,548
Okay? I just been clean
for a couple months,

325
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,718
and I just slipped up.

326
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,586
"Slipped up"? That's a bit of an
understatement, don't you think?

327
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:39,390
What are you talking about?

328
00:24:39,392 --> 00:24:40,791
I'm talking about your girlfriend,

329
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:42,795
Miss Kerry Cooper.

330
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:46,897
[stammers]

331
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:50,968
No, no. She liked it rough sometimes.

332
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,038
Okay? And you have it
backwards. She was the aggressor.

333
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,607
You don't think I have my own
bumps and bruises from her?

334
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,544
It went both ways.

335
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,515
Well, that's comforting to hear.

336
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:07,518
Look, I don't expect you to understand.

337
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,420
I don't.

338
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:10,988
I never met anybody like her.

339
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,423
And she didn't treat me
like I was some screw-up.

340
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:17,461
- Yeah.
- So I was scared I was gonna lose her.

341
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:20,434
I freaked out, okay? We got into a fight...

342
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,002
Did it get physical?

343
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:29,039
Yeah, yeah, but it wasn't like that. Okay?

344
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,041
And I apologized like crazy.

345
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,478
And we're working things out.

346
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,383
When was the last time you saw her?

347
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,083
Last week.

348
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:40,785
Dropped her off at the school.

349
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:42,119
She said she would call,

350
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:45,458
but... she just needed some time.

351
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,726
Look, call her.

352
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:50,798
You'll see. I didn't
hurt her again. I swear.

353
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:56,099
[Archer] So...

354
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:58,435
should we ask her now?

355
00:25:58,437 --> 00:25:59,473
I think it's too late.

356
00:26:03,943 --> 00:26:05,910
[quiet sob]

357
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,348
This is not Kerry.

358
00:26:10,783 --> 00:26:13,151
That's not... That's not her.

359
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:15,019
- It's what we're dealing with here.
- That's not...

360
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:16,788
- No, no, no.
- That's not Kerry.

361
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,591
What's the matter with you?

362
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,528
I need to see her.

363
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,829
Right now! I need to see her right now!

364
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:28,766
Is she dead?

365
00:26:28,768 --> 00:26:31,067
- Yes, she's dead.
- [sobs]

366
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,770
No. She's not dead.

367
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:36,173
Please don't tell me that.
Please don't tell me that.

368
00:26:36,175 --> 00:26:40,010
That's not Kerry. That's not her!

369
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:42,613
I need to see her right now!

370
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:44,147
Let me see her!

371
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,817
- That can't happen.
- Please.

372
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:48,786
Please don't tell me that she's...

373
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:50,855
Archer.

374
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:53,691
[gasps] Please tell me...

375
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:54,862
[sobs]

376
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:03,201
Let's just, uh,

377
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:04,471
take a little break here.

378
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,738
That's not her.

379
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,105
You want a drink?

380
00:27:09,107 --> 00:27:11,642
How 'bout I get you a water or a soda?

381
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:13,079
I'll get you a soda.

382
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,959
So...

383
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:31,194
You still think she did it?

384
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:34,598
Well, she just admitted to playing rough.

385
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,133
But does that make her a murderer?

386
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:37,902
I don't know. Who knows?

387
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:40,637
You know, sometimes they
start playing and then

388
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:42,138
it escalates.

389
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,807
I've seen it.

390
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:45,876
No, this doesn't track.

391
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:48,813
Habitual domestic violence
is impulsive in nature.

392
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:51,051
Our perp is calculated, methodical.

393
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:55,185
She's not our guy.

394
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:57,855
[Christi] Oh, my God. Detectives!

395
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:58,923
Oh, my God!

396
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,159
[Archer] Fuck!

397
00:28:30,857 --> 00:28:32,658
[no audible dialogue]

398
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:41,767
What the hell were you two thinking
leaving a soda can in the room?

399
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,835
Especially with Lois
Lane outside your door.

400
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:46,136
Have you ever heard of a paper cup?

401
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:49,039
Because we have 150 of
them in the break room.

402
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,275
Yeah, look. I'm sorry. I screwed up.

403
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:52,980
Yeah, you're damn right you screwed up.

404
00:28:55,213 --> 00:28:58,281
Look, Ruiney. I know what you're
still going through, all right?

405
00:28:58,283 --> 00:29:01,018
But you have got to get
your head in the case.

406
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,321
In this case.

407
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:06,891
Or you're gonna have to
take some more time off.

408
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:09,926
No, I got this. It's good. I got it.

409
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:13,830
So do you have any idea,
Captain, how the girl's doing?

410
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:16,767
The doctor said she was touch and
go for a while, but she's stable now.

411
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:18,669
That's good.

412
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:22,173
She was also able to give
an alibi, which checks out.

413
00:29:22,175 --> 00:29:26,078
And Ray, you're here as a courtesy.

414
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:32,115
You're not a cop anymore. So don't push it.

415
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:34,951
Okay, Captain.

416
00:29:34,953 --> 00:29:37,957
Both of you, get the hell out of
my office before I change my mind.

417
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:52,336
So, Forensics found traces of human blood

418
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:56,007
mixed with animal blood in Kerry's bedroom.

419
00:29:56,009 --> 00:30:00,144
Got a DNA hit on it, and comes up...

420
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:03,314
a felon named David Green.

421
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:06,049
This is the right place?

422
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:09,086
I don't know, honey. Your
guess is as good as mine.

423
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:12,423
I looked in the PO file
and this was the address.

424
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:14,224
This place has become quite popular

425
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:16,292
with ex-cons over the past year.

426
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:19,763
[Archer] Ex-cons finding Jesus.

427
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:22,602
- I like that.
- [Ruiney] Hallelujah.

428
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:39,282
[hinges squeal in distance]

429
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,218
Did you hear that?

430
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,688
Yeah.

431
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,022
Where's it coming from?

432
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:47,194
Yeah, this way.

433
00:30:58,404 --> 00:31:03,809
Oh, God. I can't believe
I'm back in the church again.

434
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:09,880
[wire snaps]

435
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:11,184
- [thud]
- [grunt]

436
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,750
Archer!

437
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:15,019
- You okay?
- Oh, you okay?

438
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:17,954
Yeah. What happened?

439
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:19,490
You stop right there!

440
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:22,326
Don't you move! Christi, how's Archer?

441
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:24,428
- Don't move, don't move, don't move.
- Christi?

442
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,298
- I don't know, maybe he...
- No, it's my back, my back.

443
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,301
- Your back? Ruiney!
- I think I may have... just, just my back.

444
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:34,337
- Come here.
- Dispatch, we got an officer down at Sacred Heart Mausoleum.

445
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:36,307
- Suspect on foot. Over.
- What do we got here?

446
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:38,843
What is that?

447
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:41,181
[Christi] I... I don't know.

448
00:31:48,154 --> 00:31:51,221
[Archer] So, you see anything?

449
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:55,893
I didn't get a good look
at him. It was too dark.

450
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:57,528
What about you, Ruiney?

451
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,431
No, I was too busy saving your ass.

452
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:02,335
Thank you.

453
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,038
Well...

454
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:08,942
it does confirm it, doesn't it?

455
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:14,278
What?

456
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,213
Monroe's got a serial killer.

457
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:20,017
Yeah.

458
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,153
- [man] Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

459
00:32:22,155 --> 00:32:24,387
The victim was Gene Wilson.

460
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:27,391
Recent parolee who did a
three-year stint for armed robbery.

461
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:31,060
Okay, get a BOLO out on David Green.

462
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:34,097
- No need to, Detect...
- Hmm?

463
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:37,567
Sorry, old habits. He just got here.

464
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:41,905
- He's here?
- He's over there.

465
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:46,277
[Archer] Uh, David Green? That's you?

466
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:49,413
- Yes, that's, uh...
- You're David Green?

467
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:51,981
Yeah, I'm David Green.

468
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,287
Well, that's good.

469
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:59,792
"God... who gives joy".

470
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:05,328
So Reverend, how does a convicted felon

471
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,498
become a reverend?

472
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,134
[sighs] God forgives.

473
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:14,038
The church? Not so much.

474
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,538
I had to jump through a lot of hoops

475
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,441
in order to do the Lord's work.

476
00:33:17,443 --> 00:33:20,411
Um, even now, I'm only
allowed to work with ex-cons

477
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:23,012
trying to start over.

478
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:26,150
Well, Reverend, we got a problem here.

479
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:28,484
Actually, we got two problems.

480
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,321
Two? I don't... I don't follow.

481
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:34,124
You see, Reverend, there's a dead guy

482
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:35,859
swinging in your church.

483
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:38,061
You knew him, right? Gene Wilson?

484
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:40,631
Yeah, he was the janitor.

485
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:43,433
What was he doing here so late?

486
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:45,435
He cleans whenever he can.

487
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:50,075
He... he was just released and
was looking for a fresh start.

488
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:56,916
What are you thinking?

489
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:01,317
Uh...

490
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:03,287
[chuckles]

491
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,356
Reverend, we're gonna
need you to write down

492
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:10,227
exactly your whereabouts
the last three days.

493
00:34:10,229 --> 00:34:12,395
Okay. Yeah, that's not a problem.

494
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:15,065
Um, I was in Springfield,

495
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,366
uh, giving a guest sermon

496
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:18,635
at the Unitarian Universal Church.

497
00:34:18,637 --> 00:34:20,403
Um, I just got back tonight...

498
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:23,039
Okay. Okay.

499
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:26,109
How about Miss Kerry Cooper?

500
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:28,279
How did you know her?

501
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:31,247
Cooper, I don't... I
don't... I don't believe I do.

502
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:34,250
- You don't know her?
- [Green] No.

503
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:37,053
Well, you're gonna have
to do some explaining then

504
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:38,488
because your blood

505
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,424
was in her apartment.

506
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,363
My blood in her... I
don't... I don't have...

507
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:52,004
Y-Y-You're not
gonna believe this.

508
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:59,176
Frankly, I... I... I still
don't understand it myself.

509
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:01,712
But, um, a couple of months ago,

510
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:03,714
I woke up in the middle of the night

511
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:05,549
with someone standing over me.

512
00:35:05,551 --> 00:35:07,183
A man.

513
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:09,352
And he... I struggled,

514
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:13,723
but he put something over... over my face.

515
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:16,660
And eventually, I passed out.

516
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:19,064
[exhales] When I woke up...

517
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:25,368
...there was... there was blood coming out of
my arm. I mean, it was dripping down my arm.

518
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,705
Like I'd gotten a shot or something. So...

519
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:32,977
Okay, so you're telling us that a guy

520
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:36,513
broke into your house and stole your blood?

521
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:37,982
That's the story you're telling?

522
00:35:37,984 --> 00:35:40,017
That's... I told you...

523
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:41,120
I told you you wouldn't believe me.

524
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,290
Well, I've heard some stories.

525
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:49,459
But you know, this rings a bell to me.

526
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:52,428
Yeah, it's kind of a
coincidence when you think of it.

527
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,499
Last Thursday... I
don't know if I told you.

528
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,301
<i>I</i> woke up in
the middle of the night.

529
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:00,404
And for some reason,

530
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,075
I had a pink tutu on.

531
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:07,644
And a serious fuzzy feather
sticking out of my ass.

532
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:09,446
[chuckling]

533
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:12,348
You know, you're right.

534
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,584
I don't believe you.

535
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:17,056
[indistinct chatter]

536
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:58,298
These days, you know, he can't bring
himself to look inside that file.

537
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:04,368
But he's unable to let it go.

538
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,373
That's why he keeps it so close.

539
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:12,544
Archer, there's something that
I think you need to look at.

540
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:16,446
You want me to look at that?

541
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,050
- [sighs]
- Please.

542
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,557
You and I both know you're not
supposed to be anywhere near here.

543
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:29,095
This is important to this case.

544
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:32,164
Please.

545
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:40,437
At first, it just looks
like random slash marks.

546
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:42,442
Oh, shit!

547
00:37:44,176 --> 00:37:45,645
I don't know. I think...

548
00:37:47,646 --> 00:37:49,281
I'm so... so sorry.

549
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:58,624
I missed it.

550
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:02,792
[sighs] I missed it.

551
00:38:02,794 --> 00:38:06,566
So much was going on at the
time, you know, it was...

552
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,202
It was all...

553
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:15,742
You had no way of knowing then.

554
00:38:22,314 --> 00:38:23,249
[sighs]

555
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:29,218
You know, I introduced them to each other.

556
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,258
She asked me to walk her down the aisle...

557
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:37,363
...to give her away.

558
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:43,299
I don't see how

559
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:44,868
I could have missed it.

560
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,774
You didn't even know what you
were looking for back then.

561
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:51,477
You were too close to it.

562
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,185
Okay.

563
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:06,292
Good work, Christi.

564
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:15,667
[sighs]

565
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:22,573
[Ruiney] There are at
least a dozen witnesses

566
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:24,975
that can place him in
that church in Springfield.

567
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:28,377
And I checked out the
report from three months ago.

568
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:31,480
Turns out Reverend Green
is telling the truth.

569
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:34,850
Lab found traces of
chloroform in his blood.

570
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:37,254
No items were reported missing?

571
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:39,223
The only thing missing was his DNA.

572
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:40,857
This doesn't make any sense.

573
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,526
No, Captain, it does.

574
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:45,328
He wanted us to go to that church.

575
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,830
This guy is definitely a psychopath.

576
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:50,566
But I would classify him
as an organized killer.

577
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:54,004
There's nothing random or spontaneous,
frenzied, about these attacks.

578
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:57,640
They're planned. He leaves a
controlled scene for us to find.

579
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,910
I think we're looking for
a white male, 25-to-35.

580
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:01,778
Extremely high IQ.

581
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,281
And what about this...
this pig head business?

582
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:09,953
Pigs. Cops. Maybe he's
just taunting you guys.

583
00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:12,855
Okay, this information doesn't leave
this room. Do you understand me?

584
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,725
- Of course.
- If the media gets a hold of this,

585
00:40:14,727 --> 00:40:16,859
they're gonna turn this
into a frenzy in seconds.

586
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,566
And if I had it my way,
you would go home now.

587
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:24,901
So with Reverend Green's alibi
checking out, then what does that mean?

588
00:40:24,903 --> 00:40:27,703
I mean, does this mean
we're back to square one?

589
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,742
We're not even on square one.

590
00:40:32,711 --> 00:40:34,714
You see, it's all about the hangman game.

591
00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:41,685
So far, we have two homicides.

592
00:40:41,687 --> 00:40:45,258
But... we have three letters.

593
00:40:46,658 --> 00:40:48,658
Which means...

594
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,029
we haven't even found the first victim yet.

595
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:55,935
And, judging by the game board...

596
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,569
he's gonna kill seven more people.

597
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:04,674
Same pattern as previous victim.

598
00:41:04,676 --> 00:41:06,575
Petechial hemorrhages in the eyes,

599
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:09,613
look, the ligature marks around the neck.

600
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:14,817
[sighs] Cause of death
was asphyxiation again.

601
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,354
[Ruiney] Our perp's been
leaving us clues to the next vic.

602
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:19,723
So far, we haven't got much to go on.

603
00:41:19,725 --> 00:41:21,825
Have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary?

604
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:24,560
- No, nothing.
- Time of death?

605
00:41:24,562 --> 00:41:27,830
Uh, sometime between ten
and midnight last night.

606
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,801
It was eleven p.m. sharp.

607
00:41:30,803 --> 00:41:34,571
Well, it's a little
difficult to be that precise.

608
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:39,075
Well, his Rolex broke.
Right there. Eleven p.m.

609
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:42,345
But clearly last night,
that watch didn't fit him.

610
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:44,680
I don't know too much about Rolexes,

611
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:47,452
except I do know janitors aren't
running around wearing them.

612
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:50,687
That's not his watch.

613
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:54,091
- Yeah. You want to dust this for prints?
- Sure.

614
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:56,859
No, he's too smart for that.

615
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:59,062
Tell me. Eleven p.m.,

616
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,131
that'd fit into the time frame
for all the victims, right?

617
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:04,437
Yeah. That would be correct, Detective.

618
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:10,475
- What?
- Twenty-four hours.

619
00:42:13,812 --> 00:42:19,149
Hangman is gonna kill someone
at eleven p.m. every 24 hours.

620
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:24,888
So that gives us two and a half
hours before the next victim falls.

621
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,656
Come on, guys. What are we missing?
There's got to be something.

622
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:29,125
Oh, wait. Uh, the ligature marks,

623
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:32,028
they weren't like the previous victim.

624
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,131
- Why?
- Well, okay,

625
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:38,000
see, they were made of the pigskin.

626
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:40,002
- Pigskin?
- Yeah.

627
00:42:40,004 --> 00:42:41,971
I think I can help here.

628
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:46,910
The FDA stamps serial
numbers on all their meat,

629
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:49,915
so in case of contamination,
they can trace it.

630
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:54,084
That's it.

631
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:56,388
Let's get the captain to wake up the FDA.

632
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:00,459
Good stuff, Abby.

633
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:08,999
[cows mooing]

634
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:11,066
- [Ruiney] You okay?
- [Archer] Yeah.

635
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:13,705
I just need to talk to you
about something after this.

636
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,720
[thunder rumbles]

637
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:50,008
Go that way. Stay here.

638
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:02,488
Well, this is fun.

639
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:17,836
Guys?

640
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,582
[water dripping]

641

642
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:48,033
[Ruiney] Archer!

[mechanical whirring, clanking]

646
00:45:24,736 --> 00:45:26,172
Did you guys do that?!

647
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:33,646
Guys!

648
00:45:36,214 --> 00:45:37,517
Guys!

649
00:45:39,984 --> 00:45:41,750
Holy...!

650
00:45:41,752 --> 00:45:43,285
[gasps]

651
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,223
Christi!

652
00:45:48,026 --> 00:45:48,995
[gasping]

653
00:46:00,238 --> 00:46:02,104

[grunts, stammers]

656
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:08,278
- I saw... I saw him! I saw him, I saw him!
- You all right?

657
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,714
I think I saw him.

658
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:13,652
[indistinct chatter]

659
00:46:15,787 --> 00:46:19,055
[man] Yeah, because I
did lock it up at night.

660
00:46:19,057 --> 00:46:22,024
[Archer] We got rigor mortis already?

661
00:46:22,026 --> 00:46:24,861
[Abby] Uh, no. He's actually frozen stiff.

662
00:46:24,863 --> 00:46:27,229
Identifying our vic is gonna take time.

663
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:29,265
I'll have to warm up the
body before doing the autopsy.

664
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:30,933
That could take up to a week.

665
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:33,770
Wait. We don't got a week.

666
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:35,071
I know.

667
00:46:35,073 --> 00:46:36,805
We're lucky we even have 24 hours.

668
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:38,140
Eh, Will?

669
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:43,081
Hey, how come the meat isn't frozen?

670
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:47,017
How cold is it in here?

671
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:49,084
There's a thermostat over there.

672
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:51,120
It's, uh, 37 degrees.

673
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:54,957
Oh, well none of that
meat's frozen in there.

674
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,993
So how come our guy's frozen stiff?

675
00:46:57,995 --> 00:47:01,330
[Abby stammers] Well,
he's not a-a slab of meat.

676
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:04,868
And he has more water density.

677
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,303
So, any prolonged
exposure, even at that temp,

678
00:47:07,305 --> 00:47:08,904
would cause him to decompose.

679
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:11,674
Well, hasn't been here long, has he?

680
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:15,678
How long has he been here?
This place been open all day.

681
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,015
You know, you would think someone

682
00:47:19,017 --> 00:47:22,185
might have seen a stiff,
dead guy hanging in here.

683
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:25,790
- Don't you think?
- I agree, yes.

684
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:29,091
Now, if his body was wet,

685
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:31,361
would that make him freeze faster?

686
00:47:31,363 --> 00:47:33,729
Yes, of course it would.

687
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:35,330
Archer, what are you thinking?

688
00:47:35,332 --> 00:47:38,033
Well, I'm thinking...

689
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:42,272
when I want my beer to chill faster,

690
00:47:42,274 --> 00:47:46,776
I wrap it in a wet paper towel.

691
00:47:46,778 --> 00:47:48,243
He was already wet before
he was brought in here.

692
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:49,749
There you go.

693
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:56,218
I think this boy wants
us to sweep the river.

694
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,657
[indistinct chatter]

695
00:48:03,095 --> 00:48:05,761
[Christi] Archer, I
think you should tell him.

696
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:09,966
Yeah. You know how many
hundreds of families

697
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:13,403
I had to tell these grotesque stories

698
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:15,807
of how their loved ones died.

699
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:19,345
But it was nothing like this.

700
00:48:22,847 --> 00:48:25,180
Okay, so, uh, can you give me a minute?

701
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:26,515
Yeah, of course.

702
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:28,319
- Yeah.
- Here's the photo.

703
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:32,857
[clears throat]

704
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:41,363
This is taking too long.

705
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:44,366
Eight hours, 46 minutes left.

706
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:46,372
Bullshit game.

707
00:48:49,207 --> 00:48:52,341
I know that look, Archer.
Just say what you got to say.

708
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,313
I need to... I need to show you something.

709
00:48:57,082 --> 00:48:59,381
- What?
- From Jess's file.

710
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:01,283
Jess's file?

711
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:03,453
It's a photo.

712
00:49:03,455 --> 00:49:04,988
A photo from Jess's file?

713
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,923
Archer, what the hell are you doing?

714
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:09,158
Well...

715
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,361
look, we both know she put up a fight.

716
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,196
We missed it.

717
00:49:14,198 --> 00:49:15,365
Missed what?

718
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:16,901
Here.

719
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:24,240
There's a letter "V" carved in her chest.

720
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:27,176
This was his first victim.

721
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:30,180
- No, Arch, no. This is...
- What?

722
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:32,182
This is a completely different MO, Archer.

723
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:33,816
She wasn't hung.

724
00:49:33,818 --> 00:49:36,451
We didn't know the MO
at the time we found her.

725
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:39,189
Archer, it's a different
MO. She wasn't hung.

726
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:42,895
She wasn't hung because...

727
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:49,165
he was interrupted from his ritual.

728
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:51,937
He didn't get a chance to
hang her, you understand?

729
00:49:55,573 --> 00:49:57,841
Why don't you walk me through what happened

730
00:49:57,843 --> 00:50:01,013
right before you went through the door.

731
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:05,917
Go ahead.

732
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:13,925
[exhales deeply]

733
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:20,395
Jess called me up...

734
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:23,198
and told me to come home.

735
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,236
Said we should try and work things out.

736
00:50:27,238 --> 00:50:32,441
So, I got home, I parked
my car in the driveway...

737
00:50:32,443 --> 00:50:35,912
went down the back,

738
00:50:35,914 --> 00:50:39,885
picked some... tulips to give her.

739
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:44,419
You know, just like I used to.

740
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:47,223
That would've given him a
chance to know someone was there,

741
00:50:47,225 --> 00:50:49,828
and that would've stopped him.

742
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,167
Or he was still in the house
while she was in my arms.

743
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,439
[no audible dialogue]

744
00:51:19,691 --> 00:51:22,392
[cop] Guys, get me somebody to...

745
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:23,459
Move!

746
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:24,997
Whoa! Whoa!

747
00:51:40,412 --> 00:51:42,948
Eric Anderson.

748
00:51:54,392 --> 00:51:56,426
[Archer] Easy, Ruiney, easy.

749
00:51:56,428 --> 00:51:58,026
No time, Archer.

750
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:02,365
- [wire snaps]
- [whirring sounds]

751
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:03,602
Where's that sound...

752
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:06,604
...coming from?

753
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:13,211
Basement.

754
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:22,521
[rodents squeaking]

[toy train whistle blows]

756
00:52:46,211 --> 00:52:47,546
Oh, man.

757
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:51,513
Look at this.

758
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:54,450
This is Cooper's school.

759
00:52:54,452 --> 00:52:57,488
This is a replica of Monroe.

760
00:53:00,158 --> 00:53:02,424
I think I know now

761
00:53:02,426 --> 00:53:04,694
where we're gonna find our next victim.

762
00:53:04,696 --> 00:53:06,966
This is the Fostoria Line. Let's go.

763
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:13,571
[whistle blows]

764
00:53:15,573 --> 00:53:17,506
[train whistle blows]

765
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:20,676
NS/Fostoria Line at Columbia and Harrison.

766
00:53:20,678 --> 00:53:23,214
This is an emergency. Shut that line down.

767
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,651
He may still be alive, because
we beat this psycho's timeline.

768
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:30,520
- Ruiney!
- [Ruiney] Yes, I see it.

769
00:53:30,522 --> 00:53:33,192
- [crossing bell dings]
- There he is.

770
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:40,264
[Archer] Ruiney. Ruiney,
there's nothing you can do!

771
00:53:41,633 --> 00:53:43,135
Ruiney! The train!

772
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:48,770
- [man grunts]
- He's still alive!

773
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:51,339
- We need to get up there to help him!
- [Ruiney] It's a steel cable!

[tires squeal]

775
00:53:56,414 --> 00:53:58,413
- Come on!
- [man struggling]

776
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:01,551
- [Archer] Get him!
- Come on, get it off your neck!

777
00:54:01,553 --> 00:54:04,453
- [grunting]
- Get it off your neck! Come on!

778
00:54:04,455 --> 00:54:05,754
- [train whistle blows]
- Gotta get off the track!

779
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:07,557
I'm not leaving him!

780
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:09,625
- Train's coming! Come on!
- I'm not leaving him!

781
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:11,694
Archer!

782
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:13,863
Freeze now! Freeze!

783
00:54:13,865 --> 00:54:16,399
- Freeze!
- Come on, you guys! We got to go!

784
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:19,201
[Ruiney] Just get it off! Get it off!

785
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:21,537
- We got to go!
- I'm not leaving him!

786
00:54:21,539 --> 00:54:24,272
Ruiney! We got to get off that track now!

787

[whistle blowing]

- Christi!
- Christi?

789
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:51,600
Guys! Are you okay?

790
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:53,401
Holy shit!

791
00:54:53,403 --> 00:54:55,540
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

792
00:55:06,517 --> 00:55:08,618
What the hell were you doing?

793
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,319
I could've saved him.

794
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:13,622
He was dead before the train hit him.

795
00:55:13,624 --> 00:55:15,524
That is bullshit!

796
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:17,627
You're the only one who
could've been saved here.

797
00:55:17,629 --> 00:55:20,196
That was not your call to make.
It was not your call to make!

798
00:55:20,198 --> 00:55:23,799
It was my call. You know,
I'll tell you what my call is.

799
00:55:23,801 --> 00:55:27,636
My call is... that you're chasing a ghost.

800
00:55:27,638 --> 00:55:30,173
You're chasing a ghost, buddy.

801
00:55:30,175 --> 00:55:32,810
And that will get you
killed. That's for sure.

802
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:38,381
Is that what you want?

803
00:55:38,383 --> 00:55:39,881
Look, I don't give a fuck.

804
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:41,484
That's right, don't give a fuck.

805
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:43,553
Don't give a fuck about what? Your life?

You don't care if you die, do you?

Let's all die. Come on. That's easy.

Then we don't have to
worry about Jessica anymore.

You're rewriting history!

821

to you to catch this guy.

You understand?

832
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,654
I loved Jessica...

833
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:55,790

We're gonna find this guy.
You understand what I'm saying?

00:57:05,937 --> 00:57:08,337
I messed up, man. I messed up. I'm sorry.

messing with us, Ruiney.

We outsmarted him at the track.

You outsmarted him. Got

She was jumped from behind.

964
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:09,011
What a fight she put up, huh?

965
01:06:09,013 --> 01:06:10,511
In a wheelchair.

966
01:06:10,513 --> 01:06:14,515
Yeah, wheelchair, no
wheelchair, that's one tough cop.

967
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:17,218
Got nothing from the
motorcycle. Stolen. No prints.

968
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,022
Figures with this guy.

969
01:06:26,229 --> 01:06:28,296
How you doing, Christi?

970
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:29,934
You okay?

971
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:41,609
I was doing this piece on drug cartels,

972
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:45,613
and it was in the middle of nowhere, and...

973
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:47,417
I was going to my car late at night.

974
01:06:49,419 --> 01:06:52,620
And...

975
01:06:52,622 --> 01:06:54,958
I just felt like something
bad was gonna happen.

976
01:06:57,361 --> 01:07:00,127
There was this guy,

977
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:03,365
and he just came up, um, behind me

978
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:06,104
and he knocked me down and...

979
01:07:07,937 --> 01:07:10,040
he just started beating me.

980
01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:14,109
He had a knife to my neck.

981
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:17,080
I didn't know if I was gonna live or not.

982
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:24,453
The detective who was
assigned to the case...

983
01:07:24,455 --> 01:07:28,156
Detective Michaels,

984
01:07:28,158 --> 01:07:31,196
he vowed to find the
guy who did this to me.

985
01:07:33,097 --> 01:07:34,499
I don't know why.

986
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:38,836
I don't know why he cared so much.

987
01:07:44,908 --> 01:07:47,177
But he did. He found him. He found the guy.

988
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,048
And the guy shot him.

989
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:57,155
Detective Michaels had a wife...

990
01:08:00,423 --> 01:08:02,159
...and a little girl.

991
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:10,464
People don't understand

992
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:13,567
why you guys do what you do.

993
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:16,537
They don't understand how much you give up

994
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:18,508
and how much you sacrifice.

995
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:25,479
So, this story,

996
01:08:25,481 --> 01:08:27,985
it's not about me, it's about...

997
01:08:29,953 --> 01:08:32,587
It's about him. It's about you.

998
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:35,026
It's about you guys.

999
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:37,492
[sniffles]

1000
01:08:37,494 --> 01:08:40,031
So I'm not... I'm not giving up.

1001
01:08:43,066 --> 01:08:44,968
I guess you guys are stuck with me.

1002
01:08:48,404 --> 01:08:49,670
Okay.

1003
01:08:49,672 --> 01:08:51,242
[starts car]

1004
01:09:01,217 --> 01:09:05,519
[Archer] He's killed
four people in four days,

1005
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:07,421
one every 24 hours.

1006
01:09:07,423 --> 01:09:10,524
He doesn't stop. That's part of the game.

1007
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:14,563
He kills Jessica and
he stops... for a year.

1008
01:09:14,565 --> 01:09:18,300
You want to put a new
team on Jessica's murder?

1009
01:09:18,302 --> 01:09:20,669
Archer, we had four homicides in four days.

1010
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:23,005
We don't have the resources
to put a team on a homicide

1011
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:25,439
- that happened a year ago.
- Please, it not about resources, man.

1012
01:09:25,441 --> 01:09:27,608
Something happened. It's very obvious.

1013
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:30,411
- Look, I agree with you.
- There's a gap...

1014
01:09:30,413 --> 01:09:33,314
- I know, there's a gap.
- ...between murders. So let's just talk about it.

1015
01:09:33,316 --> 01:09:36,518
- What does it mean?
- Okay, look.

1016
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,389
There are only three reasons
why a serial killer stops.

1017
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:43,392
One, they die. That hasn't happened.

1018
01:09:43,394 --> 01:09:46,463
Two, we catch them. That hasn't happened.

1019
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:50,098
Or three,

1020
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,403
they're in prison on an unrelated charge.

1021
01:09:54,404 --> 01:09:56,670
Well, sounds possible.

1022
01:09:56,672 --> 01:10:00,509
In jail for some unrelated charge.

1023
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:03,344
So, why don't we get one of the techies

1024
01:10:03,346 --> 01:10:05,346
to look at everybody who was put in prison

1025
01:10:05,348 --> 01:10:07,081
from the time that Jess was murdered

1026
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,582
to the time Reverend
Green's blood was taken?

1027
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:10,385
Nine-month period.

1028
01:10:10,387 --> 01:10:12,754
That's gonna yield
hundreds, maybe thousands.

1029
01:10:12,756 --> 01:10:15,090
Yeah, that's the problem.
We don't have the time.

1030
01:10:15,092 --> 01:10:17,792
So we need to figure out
a way to refine the search.

1031
01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:21,095
But, I think that this
is personal to you guys.

1032
01:10:21,097 --> 01:10:23,532
He put your badge numbers
on that desk for a reason.

1033
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:26,801
She's right. He called us out.

1034
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:31,173
So, let's refine the search to us.

1035
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:33,442
Everyone you arrested this past year,

1036
01:10:33,444 --> 01:10:34,379
and everyone I arrested.

1037
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:37,315
Detectives?

1038
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:43,086
<i>[clock ticking]</i>

1039
01:12:13,377 --> 01:12:15,513
[indistinct chatter]

1040
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:28,756
That son of a bitch killed Joey,

1041
01:12:28,758 --> 01:12:31,561
as a payback to us for saving the captain.

1042
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:35,429
He's that kinda guy.

1043
01:12:35,431 --> 01:12:38,366
Please, tell me you got something.

1044
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:40,902
I searched the records and used the
filters for the date range you gave me.

1045
01:12:40,904 --> 01:12:44,238
- Yeah, and?
- 26 arrests in your time parameters.

1046
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,773
Five released in time to be your guy.

1047
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:47,511
- Put it up.
- That's all right.

1048
01:12:49,579 --> 01:12:52,680
So...

1049
01:12:52,682 --> 01:12:55,684
who might that be fits the profile?

1050
01:12:55,686 --> 01:12:58,819
- Adam Kellerman.
- Adam Kellerman.

1051
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:00,688
Pull up Adam Kellerman.

1052
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,925
[typing]

1053
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:06,564
Yeah, here we go. Kellerman,
Adam. Assault with a deadly weapon.

1054
01:13:08,699 --> 01:13:11,499
Look at his address. And home.

1055
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:13,635
Toys N More.

1056
01:13:13,637 --> 01:13:17,339
Eric Anderson. Eric Anderson's
basement was full of toys.

1057
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:19,443
Give us those shots
from, uh, from Anderson.

1058
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:25,815
This familiar?

1059
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:29,783
Train set.

1060
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:32,823
Son of a bitch sold it to him, I'll bet.

1061
01:13:46,837 --> 01:13:48,372
Let's go.

1062
01:13:50,406 --> 01:13:51,676
[grunts]

1063
01:13:56,445 --> 01:13:57,845
[man] Clear!

1064
01:13:57,847 --> 01:13:59,583
It's clear, Detective!

1065
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:05,756
[chatter on police radio]

1066
01:14:09,726 --> 01:14:11,362
[Christi] Holy shit!

1067
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:16,764
Get Westlin down here.

1068
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:19,401
Get the prints off the wall.

1069
01:14:19,403 --> 01:14:20,702
Run 'em against Kellerman.

1070
01:14:20,704 --> 01:14:22,903
This is Ruiney.

1071
01:14:22,905 --> 01:14:25,275
Let's get Forensics up here.
We have a deceased male.

1072
01:14:34,818 --> 01:14:37,320
No powder residue on his face.

1073
01:14:41,091 --> 01:14:43,261
And residue on his hands.

1074
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:02,446
Oh. Got his paint bucket there.

1075
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,949
[sighs]

1076
01:15:15,025 --> 01:15:18,462
Oh, look what we found.

1077
01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:22,600
Will? Will?

1078
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:51,696
I think we got the son of a bitch.

1079
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:57,732
You know, maybe it's
not the way we wanted it,

1080
01:15:57,734 --> 01:15:59,704
but it's better than him...

1081
01:16:02,806 --> 01:16:06,006
...winding up in some prison
playing cards every night

1082
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:07,877
to his heart's content.

1083
01:16:09,044 --> 01:16:10,681
So it's over?

1084
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:14,549
Over?

1085
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:16,818
Yes, it could be.

1086
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:19,754
I think maybe

1087
01:16:19,756 --> 01:16:22,189
I should check down at the station house

1088
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:24,928
and go over Kellerman's background.

1089
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:32,966
You know, Christi, why don't
you go on back home, honey?

1090
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:35,737
I think, uh, it's been a long day.

1091
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:38,376
I'll get an officer here to take you back.

1092
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:43,911
Call me if you guys find anything.

1093
01:16:43,913 --> 01:16:46,050
Yeah, sure.

1094
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:52,655
Officer, make sure she gets
back to her place safely.

1095
01:16:55,225 --> 01:16:59,861
This guy went to extreme
lengths to get our attention.

1096
01:16:59,863 --> 01:17:03,100
Made sure we followed every
lead, found every victim.

1097
01:17:05,735 --> 01:17:09,804
So why off yourself before
the game is finished?

1098
01:17:09,806 --> 01:17:11,973
I mean, we don't even
know what the word is.

1099
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,108
Guys like this,

1100
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:16,710
like Bundy, Gacy, Ramirez,

1101
01:17:16,712 --> 01:17:18,715
they don't just stop, Archer.

1102
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,483
So what are you saying to me?

1103
01:17:22,485 --> 01:17:27,221
You want this thing to
make some kind of sense?

1104
01:17:27,223 --> 01:17:29,957
Tie it up in some way?

1105
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:32,960
That's not the world, you know.

1106
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:35,496
You're still young enough to believe it is,

1107
01:17:35,498 --> 01:17:38,933
but things like sense and logic,

1108
01:17:38,935 --> 01:17:42,569
well, they, uh...

1109
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:46,508
they quit having any effect.

1110
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:49,710
I could never look at things from
your perspective. I never will.

1111
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:51,578
I'm not asking you to.

1112
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:54,515
Maybe you're not ready to
let this whole thing go.

1113
01:17:54,517 --> 01:17:55,950
Because that would mean, in a way,

1114
01:17:55,952 --> 01:17:59,457
that you're giving up on Jessica.

1115
01:18:04,793 --> 01:18:06,863
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1116
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:11,965
Maybe I'm not.

1117
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,969
But I need to be sure, Archer.

1118
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:17,707
I need to be sure.

1119
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:24,912
That's an impossible wish, but go for it.

1120
01:18:24,914 --> 01:18:27,615
Let's go see Christi.

1121
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:30,952
Listen to her recordings.
Maybe she's got something.

seeing as you've had to
focus on me this whole time,

1160

that it's only fair that

He's celebrating the anniversary

He did it at one of them pig farms off 28.

Pig farm off 28? Archer,

that Christi is still alive

1200
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:51,344
from a live feed that he is
broadcasting on the Internet.

1201

Son of a bitch. You
guys got a trace on that?

No time for a trace,

- Oh, my God. Ruiney, where's he buried?

1206
01:23:04,994 --> 01:23:07,995
- Where's his father buried?
- Okay, so it's the state's responsibility

1207
01:23:07,997 --> 01:23:10,363
to bury the destitute
in a public graveyard.

1208
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:12,500
So where's the closest public graveyard?

1209
01:23:12,502 --> 01:23:15,068
Public mortuaries. We got
St. Catherine's, St. Joseph's.

He wants us there, Ruiney.

01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:26,546
Only we got to beat his timeline.

1215
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:28,616
That's how he knew the Reverend Green.

1216
01:23:28,618 --> 01:23:31,251
- How far away is SWAT?
- Approximately 20 minutes out.

1217
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:33,187
So please, please tell me
that you guys are closer!

Now! Go! Go! Go!

1221
01:23:41,064 --> 01:23:44,130
Let's have a talk.

1222
01:23:44,132 --> 01:23:46,166
[sighs] Come on, Christi.

1223
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:49,937
You haven't figured this out yet?

1224
01:23:49,939 --> 01:23:53,006
Why the... Why the game?
Why the hangman game?

1225
01:23:53,008 --> 01:23:57,344
I dunno. This one just kinda stuck with me.

1226
01:23:57,346 --> 01:24:01,581
And also, there's a slight
thrill in being in control.

1227
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:04,885
You know, it's an
exhilarating feeling, you know,

1228
01:24:04,887 --> 01:24:08,288
being able to tell who lives and who dies.

1229
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,323
<i>And that justifies
killing innocent people?</i>

1230
01:24:10,325 --> 01:24:12,660
You should really feel privileged

1231
01:24:12,662 --> 01:24:15,196

you a double value letter.

I have more questions.

1234
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:23,970
Why do you redress the-the people?

1235
01:24:23,972 --> 01:24:27,008
If you just kill them,
why do you redress them?

1236
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:30,544
I used to work nights
in a department store.

1237
01:24:30,546 --> 01:24:34,081
<i>I used to dress the mannequins.</i>

<i>They had to be perfect.</i>

1239
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:39,319
And I was in control.

1240
01:24:39,321 --> 01:24:43,057
[stammers] S-So it's all about control.

1241
01:24:43,059 --> 01:24:45,393
And I get that. I get that.

1242
01:24:45,395 --> 01:24:47,661
Something happened to you in your past,

1243

and you want to make it right.

1244

You think you understand?

01:24:52,135 --> 01:24:53,533
You think you understand?

You want to see control?!
You want to see control?!

1249
01:25:01,043 --> 01:25:03,710
I mean, I'll flick the switch
now. I don't have to wait!

1250
01:25:03,712 --> 01:25:05,947
Ten fifty-eight. Two minutes.

1251
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:08,081
I don't need that. You want to see control?

Oh, oh, Jimmy. No, no, no.

[Archer] Let's just talk for
a minute. You and I, Jimmy.

1272

I remember the last time I saw you.

1273
01:26:16,586 --> 01:26:17,718
You were just up to here.

1274
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,356
Just a little boy.

1279
01:26:32,702 --> 01:26:34,602
I washed my hands of you.

1280
01:26:34,604 --> 01:26:36,036
I did. I know I did.

1281
01:26:36,038 --> 01:26:38,505
And I know now that was a mistake.

1282
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:40,541
It was a tragic mistake.

1283
01:26:40,543 --> 01:26:43,411
Jimmy, I remember those little eyes

1284
01:26:43,413 --> 01:26:47,514
looking at me as if...

1285
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:49,649
I was the one who killed
your father. But I didn't.

1286
01:26:49,651 --> 01:26:50,718
I didn't do it.

1287

He hung himself.

1288
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:54,721
I was there, Jimmy.

1289
01:26:54,723 --> 01:26:57,323
I was there witnessing that trauma

1290
01:26:57,325 --> 01:26:58,792
that changed your whole life.

1291
01:26:58,794 --> 01:27:00,795
Don't you patronize me.

1292
01:27:00,797 --> 01:27:03,397
Oh, come on now. You don't need to do it.

1293
01:27:03,399 --> 01:27:05,232
- I'm not gonna do anything!
- Don't you take another step!

What am I gonna do to you? You tell me.

1295
01:27:07,302 --> 01:27:09,370
I left you, Jimmy. I know.

1296
01:27:09,372 --> 01:27:13,773
And I forgot whatever
happened to that little boy.

1297
01:27:13,775 --> 01:27:15,843
[Jimmy] You want to know what
happened to that little boy Jimmy?

After losing my father and that house

1299
01:27:21,316 --> 01:27:25,251
I went through years of brutal pain.

1300
01:27:25,253 --> 01:27:28,154
Pain that you could only read about
in your stupid fuckin' police files.

1301
01:27:28,156 --> 01:27:31,559
But you got no idea, do you? No idea.

If I'd have done something,
if I had followed through,

1304
01:27:35,597 --> 01:27:38,832
if I had inquired even about
how you were you doing, it was...

1305
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:42,335
- It would've been different, I'm sure...
- You know what, fuck you!

And you know what? You know
who's to thank, Detective?

1309
01:27:51,213 --> 01:27:55,483
You know who kept me going through
all those years of abuse and neglect?

1310
01:27:55,485 --> 01:27:57,154
You know who that was?

1311
01:27:58,855 --> 01:28:03,691
It's you, Detective Archer. It's you.

1312
01:28:03,693 --> 01:28:07,495
I could've helped you. I know
that deep inside my heart.

Let me take this young woman's place.

Don't.

1315
01:28:14,803 --> 01:28:17,505
I was too damn callous.

1316
01:28:17,507 --> 01:28:19,473
I had no empathy.

1317
01:28:19,475 --> 01:28:22,242
And that is unforgiveable.

1318
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:26,714
I'm not asking for forgiveness. All
I'm asking you to do for me now...

01:28:26,716 --> 01:28:29,383
